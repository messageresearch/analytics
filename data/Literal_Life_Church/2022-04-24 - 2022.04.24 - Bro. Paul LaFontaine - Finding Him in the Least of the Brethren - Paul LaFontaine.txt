========================================

angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world for i have a hundred hungered and you gave me meat i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in now notice jesus is using this he's using the word i and as if he was the one that's hungered he's the ones that's thirsty in these conditions he's saying i was hungry you gave me me i was thirsty and you gave me a drink i was a stranger and you took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came unto me then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee a hundred hungered and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you in so much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me amen heavenly father we're grateful to be in your house today and there's something lord so powerful in all these themes that we sing about and we worship with lord they're not just songs but they're themes that come from an experience that we've had with you lord it's one thing to sing about something it's one thing to read the word and to read the stories in the bible it's another thing lord where we're living out what the bible says we're experiencing lord some things even that you went through and lord even this week i see that i can look to your example and know how to respond to certain things that i go through because lord we're living out those pages in our own lives i thank you lord that we can come and have this place to learn of you to sit quietly lord and just have you speak to let you do your eternal work or through the gospel preaching lord i'm thankful that we're still knowing that your holy spirit is calling souls this morning we're thankful for that and lord if you're calling may we all respond to the call lord jesus we pray you'll bless the word anoint it father and may we learn of you this morning as we commit the service and the souls here in your hands in jesus name amen amen god bless you may be seated last sunday easter sunday we were very blessed to be able to see mary magdalene and to see the the special place that god gave mary magdalene and that special calling or that special place that he gave her kind of surprised us all i never looked at it that way maybe you had before but we were very blessed and very surprised to see who it was the least likely person at the end at the very closing hours of jesus earthly journey and just before the the resurrection the least likely person at the end got to got the first view of his glory in the resurrection the least likely person and it's not because that mary magdalene was better or it's not because she had a good past because she did not have a good past it's not because that she had done anything better than the disciples it's not because of any of her merit it's not because of any of her background uh it wasn't because any of that it was just god's grace and god's mercy but it teaches us something that god is not a god of position and rank and how much you do or how little you do or we how many know that this gospel is not based upon how many works you do to gain entrance into the kingdom and god doesn't judge you according to your works can you say man god does not look at things that way and this is an example that surprised us to see her to be able to view the glory of god as the first one in the resurrection not because she was better or she had a great past but i believe was because she was just simply focused on the right thing mary magdalene in the closing hours of jesus life was focused on the right thing and incidentally the other disciples were not focused on the right thing they were focused on their carnality they were focused focused on losing jesus they weren't focused on the promise and i don't know how much revelation that mary had but she had enough of her that she wanted to stay close to the lord stay close to his body even though he had already passed on as what we know it it was a lifeless body but she she was focused on the right thing and she was faithful to the right thing and she was staying close to the right thing i wonder if god looks at it that way it's not so much that we have a lot of works to bring to him but that we in this closing hours and how many believe we're in the closing hours of time that we would be focused on the correct thing that we would be faithful to the right thing that we would stay close to the right thing and to not judge ourselves someone was asking for prayer last week is that they continually be beat up by the enemy and beat themselves up that i'm not doing enough and i don't seem to be enough doing enough to please the lord and the devil's always doing that but when it comes to god's grace friends god is not judging by our works but i wonder if it's just as simple as mary magdalene she just basically focused on the right thing at the right hour she was focused on the right thing how many would raise your hand this morning say god in these closing seconds of time don't let me be diverted by anything of this world don't let me try to work my way into heaven but lord let me just be focused on the right thing and let me be faithful and consistent to you lord even when it looks like the lord's gone and it looks hopeless let me be faithful anyway can i get an amen even it looks like that's why the other disciples they're disappointed i'm going back to my career i'm going back to this but there was something about harrison even though his body was dead i'm going to stay faithful to him i'm going to stay close to him even though this tragedy has happened in my life i'm going to stay consistent with the lord i'm going to can you say i'm going to stay coming to church i'm going to stay close to him even though i might not feel him right now i'm going to stay close to him because when jesus body was dead he couldn't touch her like he used to he couldn't lay his hands on her like like he used to it was a lifeless body but nevertheless something in her said listen he raised me up one day there was something in him that raised me out of my dirty life it raised me something raised me up there's something about this man and even though he's dead i know there's resurrection power in that i want to stay close to the right thing like she did can you say man because if he could raise and raise her life out of sin that he could do more so the least of the followers of jesus got written in the story of the resurrection the least of the followers of jesus got written in the story of the resurrection i'll tell you don't let my name be in anything else except for let it be in the closing hours at resurrection time let my name be attached to that and let me be in that resurrection my name don't have to be in lights they're not anyway but my name don't have to go i don't care i don't have to be invited to another convention i'm perfectly happy just to preach the gospel here to my own people this morning and serve the lord i am so happy to be here and just feeling his presence with you i don't need my name out i don't even know i just want my name attached to the lord i want to be close to him so it's it's it's she was chosen the least of the followers how many of you kids or how many of you adults experience uh when the team got chosen brother tom was just talking about this the other day when the team is lined up there and all the people are lined up and you're going to choose them it's kind of the worst way to do it to choose them out because somebody always ends up the last one and you can't help but judge there's a reason that they were chosen last they just don't have what it takes they don't have the talent so how many would say i'm one of those because i'm raising my hand right away i was the young redhead that was chosen last most the time so there's three or four of us come on be honest now and there's nothing worse than that feeling is that that that coach or that person goes through i'll take you and then the other team says i'll take you and i'll choose you i'll choose you and it keeps going down and you're looking around and going and it's becoming more lonely all the time and all of a sudden you're the last one there and you're chosen you are chosen but you're the last one chosen it's not fun but it's terrible but but the surprise in god's choosing is he picks the least first in god's kingdom he and i can show you other examples in scripture he he seems to choose the least uh the least that would have the credibility for it or that would have the background for it or that would have what the what they need for it and that's when you're playing baseball or volleyball these different things you're being judged about your talent and so you're the last one to get chosen because you don't have what it takes like the other ones have and the coaches are choosing based upon i got to get this done so i'm choosing the very best of the best based on that but when we come into the kingdom of god then god looks at character god looks at what he needs god looks at somebody teachable and you could take somebody you don't have a clue about volleyball and you can start teaching them all of a sudden within a few months probably under the care of brother tom or somebody like that they can excel everybody else in volleyball and surprise everybody did anybody do that when you were in school did you do that not really but in the kingdom he chooses even even though you would think think like you're the worst player even though you would think like you're the worst christian the thing about it is is that this coach he sees your potential he sees what you will become and so we find this in other places in the bible um related to the end time and i'm going to reference a couple of them today related to the end times related to the last closing hours we see other examples where of god's choosing and also we see the least of the brother and that's kind of my theme this morning finding him and the least of the brother and we find that at the end there's a choosing there's a there's a choosing the least of the brother and god emphasizing that and we find other places related to the end and so one of the one of them i'll reference right now and that's the parable of the wedding invitation given by the king jesus talks about there was a king he sent out invitations to a wedding feast and so we we find that the who was chosen first is the normal people to be chosen the normal ones that get would get an invitation to this wedding and this wedding feast and so he sends out the invitation and and uh and so uh then and brother branham deals with this and is your life worthy he talks about it and he references how jesus said there was invitations that went out to the normal people and all of a sudden the normal people begin to make excuses it says i i'm too busy i can't come i've got this to do and i've got that to do and an invitation has come to this great weapon and it's a great privilege and honor to be invited to this king's feast but and it used to be an honor to some of these people it used to be an honor to be invited to this king this is pretty important and so it used to be top priority but something happened in their lives that it's not a priority more i can take it or leave it it's at the bottom of the list now because their lives have become busy i'm prepared for no amens their life had become so busy where the invitation to the king's feasts was not quite as at the top of the priority as it used to be so the bible says they all with one accord begin to make excuses i have bought a piece of land i need to go view that i need to look at the closing papers i need to view that i just i can't make it i can't come i've got this and the other one says i've purchased a cow a big cow and that's going to bring beef for my family and it's going to be great for me and i've got to go and i've got that appointment set at that date so i'm not going to be able to make that invitation and they made an excuse of that and this is the subject now is is your life worthy is your life deserving of the invitation is your life responding that's worthy of the imitation you're getting the third one made an excuse i have married a wife and he's really the only one that had an inch of a value to his excuse just kidding so you can see those three things kind of cover all the stuff that we can be distracted by a wife the busyness of getting the cow the business the purchase of a piece of land but and all that is perfectly fine okay but when it makes you turn down the invitation amen that's another story these parables are for the end time because why we're headed to a marriage feast he invites you to a feast a wedding feast and so now we've come to the word the full opening of the word he's invited you to a feast he's invited you to the full word and then there's a marriage supper of the lamb this every time i preach i'm giving an invitation to you to come to this wedding feast every time i preach it's a calling to you can you say amen every time we meet together every time god you get in the word of god god is calling you he's inviting you can you say amen and so then what we have happened i've got to move along the story i've got a lot of hay on my fort today but you see now what happened is that the king said if they won't come he says i want you to go out i want you to get the lame the halt the sick all the ones out there that you can find and i want you to invite them those people to the wedding feast because the rest of them wouldn't come so i want you to go out and get others that surprise surprise they wouldn't normally be invited to the feast but the king says i'm going to invite them because of the excuses of other people don't be surprised if you keep turning down the lord that god fills your seat at this church with somebody very unlikely because remember brother ron spencer said something i believe it was the word of the lord and god is going to fill every one of these seats all the way to the front with a lot of people and prostitutes and people delivered of drugs and people delivered of alcohol god's gonna fill these seats with maybe not the normal people that we would think i wonder how you're gonna feel about that if you come and you can't find a seat yourself when you come once a month or whenever you come listen i wonder how you're going to feel i say it's under the scripture it's going to happen that way and then when they all came the halt it's kind of like a second bowl healing revival and brother brown uses the term there was three poles first to the normal the ones then the lame and the halt and then the third one he says i still have room for my feast he said now i want you to go out into the highways into the byways i just want you to go out and make the invitation to them so as servants they go out and the least the least expected to be invited now god at the end time starts to call them because a bunch of others turned it down it's in time scriptures and the people that will come in the third poll would be the least likely that would have been invited to this invitation can you say amen many every service you're being invited to the marriage supper of the lamb some feel they don't need it that they're different they're under a different category all this is fine brother paul but i'm under different rules i don't need to rsvp to this oh yes you do so they made excuses and god begins to fill it it still was not enough so god says i want you to call and i want you to call and and all the other people that rejected him all of a sudden these others from the highways and byways begin to come i'll reference another scripture of first samuel 22 and verse 2 and these are the people in david's rejection who's a type of christ in david's rejection as a king when all the normal people the normal israel rejected him as king then this is what it says about the people that gathered around him and everyone that was in distress and everyone that was in debt and everyone that was discontented gathered themselves together unto david and he became a captain over them and there were with him about 400 men first corinthians 1 26 says for you see your calling brethren how that many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh i'm going back to verse 27 but god has chosen the foolish things in verse 26 for your see your calling brother and how that not many wise men after the flesh and so in other words in our view of who should be called it's different than what god would choose not you said not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called and then you jump to the end verse 28 base things of the world things which are despised have god chosen yea and things which are not to bring not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence there there is a a word of the lord i believe for you today to realize that at the end at the end no flesh no talents no gifts no position will glory or take any glory away from him he will choose based upon who he chooses and it will bring glory only to him but who he chooses is a surprise to us sometimes some of you were a surprise to all of us you don't have seniority because you grew up in the message you don't have position in the rapture because you grew up in the message or that you had a christian home can you say amen everybody needs a new birth everybody needs a relationship with jesus christ can you say amen and so god chooses not sometimes on the noble or the ones we but no no flesh and glory in his presence we glory in certain people we glory in certain things we choose based on certain things but at the end when all this is over he starts to choose ones that we would be surprised by because you see at the least of the brethren at the least of the brethren in the worst cases they come and they're delivered and god gets the glory become naked destitute look at the people that i read in the text there's the least of the brethren jesus called him his brother and but look at their condition it seems like it would be the elite because remember that's the bride he's speaking about and that it's the bride because the the the sheep that he had was actually the the not the bride but the ones who ministered and did good things to the bride but look look at who they are here's you think this is the elite people this is the people of god this is christ himself and the people but look at their look at their conditions naked destitute hungry thirsty that's the last ones who came i refer back now to matthew 24 and 25 if you have your bible open and i just have to give something we read uh wednesday night matthew 24. it's all of the end time events and i'll just go quickly for those who are know that the seven seals which the the the six the seven seals which revealed the history of the church and spiritually what was happening and runs all the way through the coming of the lord in the end of millennium all those things were revealed in the seals and and as we see then you can take and layer these seals right on top of matthew 24 as jesus asked questions about what will be the sign of the end time he begins to give all the characteristics of the signs of the end time you can read it when you get home and you could take all six seals and layer them on top of matthew 24 and the prophet does this for us he shows us those different attributes that are there that are being described is exactly the first horse rider the second horse rider the conditions that the church went through it's it's all laying there in matthew 24 and uh and then we get to matthew 25 so we're taught that the six seals are being expressed by jesus in matthew 24 uh and then we know that the seventh seal is the coming of the lord the last seal is the coming of the lord and when they when when it comes to the day or the hour of his coming jesus said nobody knows that it's a secret it's a mystery jesus himself said he didn't even know the day or the hour so you pick it up in matthew 24 and verse 36 but of the day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only so that one statement shows us when we get to revelations eight and verse one and there's only one verse about the seventh seal uh and it just simply says behold there was silence in heaven for a space of a half hour so the seventh seal is a space of time but it's a complete secret secret there's not one symbol of it there's not one thing to show what it is because god completely hit it the day of the hour god completely healed the seventh seal and so i'm going somewhere with this i know you're wondering but i'm going somewhere so i want you just hold tight and so verse 36 the day of the hour knoweth no man not the angels of heaven but my father only so now but when when it's so specific in matthew 24 to give the conditions of each time during the seal and the tribulation period and all that but then when it breaks into the seventh it goes silent and it goes into parables because he's got to hide it again all right so that's what happens in matthew 25 once you get to explaining the seventh seal you can't it breaks into mysterious parables it's not specific like the other seals and now we have the specifics of what the first six seals were in the revealing john now jesus said these things i got to take my time and qualify this jesus spoke of these things for the end time then john picks it up and he sees it all happening and he begins to write and he writes the first it was still in symbol but he writes it first seal and it's the first it was a white horse rider second seal red horse rider and he writes it all down and so now he's given the symbols of what the seals are but yet even when it was all done in revelations 10 he says seal up those things john seal them up in other words what the meaning of was each of those seals would still be sealed up until 2000 years later till our day he says that's when i'll release the meaning of each seal how many knows that so even though he wrote the symbols out and he says he's about to write he was about to write and he said no no no no we'll save it to the end time and i'll seal up all those things and we'll break it all forth in the end time and so then in revelations 10 it gives the the time frame of when he's going to do it in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound so that gives us the time frame so you'd have to find out if you're listening if you want to find out how he's going to use what vocal cords he's going to use for the lamb to break the seals in the end time you'd have to find out who the seventh angel is because the bible says that's who he's going to bring those seven thunders through and when it comes to seven thunders it's not going to be a symbol anymore it's going to be blasting out the voices of what the seals mean seven thunders right in a row bang bang bang bang bang voices thunders or voices thundering out blasting out what what the meaning of the seals he did it friends but when you get to the seventh seal brother branham starts to talk a little bit and he says now it says there's three parts to the sixth seal there's three purposes of the fifth seal there's three person purposes these are and there's three parts to the seventh and he says i seen the first one but i couldn't make out the weather because there's still a mystery behind this seventh seal that god didn't even show the prophet he said i looked across it there by vision and i just i just i couldn't make it out and he says i got in my notes stop right here because why if he lets it out satan can get a hold of it misinterpret it misdirect the people i'm leaving this alone and it's going to be here's how it's going to happen it's not going to be something that's written it's going to be something that's caught by revelation in the soul of the bride that's it she'll catch the revelation of the coming of the lord and she'll so catch it she knows what she needs to do to get ready for the coming of the lord she knows what she needed to have rapturing faith to be a part of the coming of the lord she's going to catch it i've held this secret i've not shown any man i didn't even sow jesus christ himself in his earth did not even know it because i'm holding it to the end time until right now when i burst those seven thunders forth and they keep echoing out and they keep the bride keeps feeding on it and keeps feeding on it it's gonna grow into a revelation of the resurrection it's going to break forth now the seventh seal is a span of time so i believe it be there's a beginning to it and there's a span of time he said that and so now just like the first coming of the lord was not just the one event of his birth but it was a it was many events together that was part of the first coming of the lord so the second coming is just not just the rapture but it's many events happening real close together so i can safely say to you because the thunders have were uttered because the mysteries have been revealed we're already in the first we're in the cycle of the coming of the lord we're living in the time of the seventh seal see why i don't feel my new body yet no but we're in the cycle of getting a new body so you say why in the world are you talking about this very important the seventh is the coming of the lord and so the seventh holds the mystery so matthew 24 deals with the six and then it goes into these parables there's a parable of the fig tree so now now when he comes to the seventh seal because i got to hide it now in a parable it'll be by revelation that they catch the parable the disciples ask him one day he says why do you speak in parables and he gave the reason he says because i speak in parables on some things because it is given to you to know the mysteries so it's given to a certain group to catch it by revelation so he doesn't throw it out there real plain he throws it in a parable because it can't come by just intellectual learning especially this mystery it cannot it will not come by intellectual learning so those are beating yourself up over i don't have enough knowledge of the message i don't have another knowledge of the scripture i'm not getting enough keep feeding on it keep reading on it can you say amen but don't you ever judge yourself by how much you have knowledge of this because especially this mystery will not be based upon some intellectual capacity that you have it will be a soul revelation once god thinks rapture and the bride connects with that sod it's a done deal oh my glory be to god it's not based upon theological learning how much you know of the message don't stop studying the message don't stop studying your bible because it's good to get those things in your mind that it can drop to your heart but he hides it because this will not be something that will be how much intellect you get through it this would be something different so he he puts it in parables it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom it's given but it's not given to some so that may be unfair to you but that's just the way it is because if god left it up to intellectual knowledge then anybody that was smarter than you could catch these things and god said i'm not setting it up based upon the smart catch it quicker than the dumb which i'll raise my hand i'm one of the dumb i my mind doesn't work like some of the high iq my iq is probably very low so thank god you know god didn't choose us based upon our iq that's not what this message is about can you say that thank god that i i can't preach things like a lot of other ministers in the message but i thank god for them i garner so much for it but i can't be them i got to be me and and i sometimes i get it simple but it's not based upon intellect it's based upon revelation and he's because if he didn't do that then a smarter person than you would make it in the rapture before you you might not even make it it was based upon intellect as i've said if it was based upon who was smart probably not a lot of you would make it in the rapture if it was based upon those who are good looking i wouldn't even make it and you that are laughing wouldn't have made it either thank god this isn't based upon what clothes i wear or how beautiful i look or how much intellect i have or how disciplined into my life thank god this is not based upon how disciplined i am in my christian walk thank god it's not based upon that thank god it's what brother joe is saying when we get to this i'll stand there by the grace of the lord i submit myself i read i pray i want to be better i told her brother a few weeks ago i said at breakfast i said i just still feel like i fail in the consistency in doing my devotions i want to get better and i am getting better but never judge yourself about that how much time you spend it's a relationship with the lord and you could be out camping and not even have your bible oh i forgot my bible and guess what you can talk to the lord and he can drop a revelation in your heart i'm glad this wasn't based upon choosing who the smartest was so because it's in parables we'll catch it by revelation so that no flesh glory is in his presence that somebody else doesn't make it and get chosen before you based upon their intellect so he's got the here we go you read your bible first one the parable of the fig tree which speaks about israel so now even though he says no man knows the day of the hour i'm going to lay some parables in i'm gonna lay some hints in it talks about the fig tree this generation don't pass till all these things will fulfill so you watch the fig tree israel coming into your homeland all that that's the thing then he goes on get your bible read with me matthew 24 verse 37 look at this hint that he drops as in the days of noah so shall also the coming of the son of man be for as in the days that it were the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that o noah entered in the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be so even he says we don't know the day or the hour but we'll know the season by the signs it'll be like the days of noah and guess what wake up wake up because as he is they're living a party life not thinking he's coming the seventh seal is written right in the ark how many has visited the the ark encounter down there all right somebody please take me i haven't been able to go yet i hear it's a great thing to see how big it was that ark when you look at it is a type of the seventh seal because judgments come into the world god gives grace for an ark for his people and they actually get in that and they're in a span of time in the ark with the door closed for seven days sealed up i tell you we need to be sealed by the holy ghost everyone else need to be sealed by the holy ghost and know where we stand god seal me up seal christ with me seal the devil out can you say amen look at these signs though look at these little things these hints so the or the the ark closes the verse 40. then shall two be in a field the one shall be taken the other one left i want you to notice now here's the hour something's going to happen there's a separation one shall be in a field the one should be taken another left we can think of that as rapture because that's going to happen some are going to go some are going to stay and not necessarily unbelievers and believers but christians without the holy ghost will stay through tribulation and those that have the holy ghost will go in the rapture so one shall be taken the other one left it's all given hints of the seventh seal coming of the lord how it's gonna be two women shall be grounding at the meal the one shall be taken and the other left watch therefore for ye know not what hour the lord cometh but know this that if the goodman of the house had known and which watched the thief would come he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh so you may not all intellectually know the details of when the day he's coming to the moment is coming but i can tell you you can keep watching and you can be ready because jesus said i could watch and be ready when who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat and due season i want to be a faithful and a wise servant hopefully i'm feeding you his meat in due season i see myself in that scripture blessed is that servant who is lord when he cometh shall find so doing verily i say to you that he shall make him rule over all his goods but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to now look at this now look at this attitude i've been around this many years and they keep preaching the coming of the lord you know what i think the lord delaith is coming so i'm just going to go party for a while i'm going to go wear what i want to wear i'm going to do what i want to do i'm going to feed on the movies i want to feed on that's not watching and be ready that's the attitude he delayeth is coming and i'm okay to live a worldly life for a while because he delayeth his coming bear listen to your pastor god help you you better not have that attitude he's delaying his coming so i'm gonna just dabble in some things of the world that's what you're doing some of you that's what you're doing you need an altar look what they do though it's not just that they say the lord delay is coming and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken so these people that are saying he delayeth is coming maybe even this message isn't true i grew up in it but it's not true anymore it's not good enough for them just to leave but they're smiting they're persecuting the fellow servants of the lord they're taking shots at the true believers the lord that servant shall come in a day when he look enough for him in an hour that he is not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth so that we see that picture now matthew 25 two more parables and the ones familiar to you all about the seventh seal he doesn't say it outright but here we have the parable of the five wise virgins and the five foolish virgins can you say man both of them are virgins can you say amen and so now this parable is revealing the time of the seventh seal the next parables reveal the time of the seven sail he just said one shall be taken the other one left so now that seems to be under this this time of the seventh seal this time before the coming of the lord it seems to be in these parables there's two groups in them in the why in the in the ten virgins there's two of them but they're all virgins they're all christians and the only distinction is one has oil and one doesn't have oil it's these two groups that i'm talking about during the time of the seventh seal it's not unbelievers and believers no no it's it's all in the christian group but one will go through tribulation because they were lacking the oil so we got to look at that as this time of the seventh seal the coming of the lord we've got to look at it as as being an important thing it reveals that there's two groups here so you could speak more about this uh let me just come back to my notes here we live in that the span of time of the opening of this seventh seal so now we have this this uh parable uh just moving down quickly here uh this parable of the wise and foolish virgins i don't have to speak much about it you've read it over and over again you see it but i just want to make sure when you read it that you know this is what's revealing that time of the coming of the lord this isn't a parable back for another time it's for the time you're living in right now that's why preachers will preach you need the holy spirit that's why we'll emphasize the oil because that's that's a it's gonna in these parables it's gonna bring the essentials what do we need what do we need to be prepared what do we need during this time of the coming of the lord well number one you need to say lord if i don't have the oil please give me the oil and they said when some recognized they didn't have it they tried to piggyback off of the other ones you can't piggyback off of mom and dad you can't piggyback off of the pastor you can't say i'm good because i go to literal life you've got to say to the lord god i want to know that i have this oil myself please if you haven't said that urgent cried prayer to god say it to him say lord there is nothing more important to me than the oil and i can't piggyback i can't they said go we give us off some of your oil you can't do it they said we have not enough for ourselves go to them that sell when they went to themselves too late the most important thing in our lives right now during the time the last hours one of the most important things is that we know that we have the oil i might go into a series on the holy ghost that we understand what that is i find one of the most confusing things that satan's still confusing people over is the new birth and the holy ghost i i want people to be able to understand because satan does his job to confuse people about it god is not the author of confusion but there's such even until today such different slants on the new birth and what the holy ghost is and the evidence sometimes people preachers will preach and if you do this then you'll then you have the holy ghost and it becomes a sanctification thing but you see the prophet told us what the evidence of the holy ghost was and we need to preach the balanced word of god for the people's sake for the young people's sake how many want to know what the holy ghost is how many want the holy ghost in your life without a shadow of a doubt god bless you god bless you i mean you pray you say lord and you've got evidences of you in your life praise the lord say god and then you that have it say i want more of it see the thing is friends god doesn't just make it confusing to us that we're always in this i'm lacking i'm lacking i'm lacking no it's just whatever we do lack just keep going before god and say lord whatever i lack fill me with it if it is the holy spirit fill me with it let me be obedient to you make me ready lord the next parable is in matthew 25 and verse 14 and unfortunately today i have to summarize i'll get to another sermon on it but now this parable under the seventh seal says that this master or king came he gives talents different talents to people and then he leaves and he comes back later to find out what they did with those talents it's a strange mysterious thing but it is in the seventh seal and it is have related to the coming of the lord so the first essential thing you got is oil the next thing is god's gonna hand you something and you know under the five wise and five fuller virgins having the oil we know brother branham preached the the essential thing of having the holy ghost he preached those things but then under this parable brother brandon preached investments right so now here you take the talents and something's given to you and it's not talents it's not we think gifts and talents no it's something spiritual that he gives you but then he comes back later says what did you do with what i gave you did you invest it did it multiply did it become more or did it come back like some of the servants says we hid it we we hit it we put it away and we had certain reasons and we just and they never got anything more than what god gave them 30 years later in the message they're in the same spot never grown an inch never went anywhere with it never sought god for more still still right at that same spot borderline believers just kind of there you know i've been in the message for years still you know have struggling over the fashions of this world never growing and he's coming to say i gave you something how have you grown with it what have you done with what i've given you and because i'm i'm really in the same state that i was it's time to pray just like you prayed for the oil now you need to pray say god i've been blessed to see the message of the hour i've been blessed to be handed something here but lord i don't want to hide it i don't want to hold it i want to invest it and let it become more one of those guys got two talents i think and it it was multiplied 100 fold when the king came back he said lord your your talents he didn't call him his he says your talents look how much they've gained your talents your growth your grace in my life look where it's gone and he was so pleased he says enter into the joys of the lord you inherit all kinds of on the other side because why you took what you had and say lord i don't want to stay this speaks of adoption do you realize that the end time is adoption time that we're not just to have the holy spirit but we're to see the holy spirit bring an overcoming life we're to see the holy spirit bring more in our lives more fruit in our lives the time of the seventh seal the time of the coming of the lord where we're given something we're given something and the talents become multiplied i wish i had more time on that but i have to move on is anybody getting something out of this today this is seven seal parables this is where we're living right now isn't it great that it's not complicated i need to go by find my lord before my lord say lord let me know that i know that i know that i have that amen are on the inside that says amen to the word of god there's no resistance on a soul level the flesh bucks up against it but in here it says amen to every word of god i got to know that i have that as the evidence of holy ghost believing every word of god for your age not just believing it up here but really from my heart i believe this lord i woke up the last oh wasn't it nice this morning to just have some warm weather and i was on my porch for the first time it's almost may and the first time i'd be able to be on my porch it was so nice to hear the birds singing and just fellowship but i've been waking up say lord thank you for this message thank you for this word grow it in me lord the things that you've given me are so incredibly blessed and i feel blessed the saints that you've given me to fellowship with is such wonderful saints i'm a blessed man so then we come to i wish i had more time on the talents because it's so important that we see that god preached that to us in investments that they're given something he leads and returns this speaks of an increased faith that's why brother brown preached perfect faith it speaks of investments he preached in investments investments mature over time this speaks of boldness to take his word and see it do more that's why he preached why christ speak amen it's not waiting around for god to do it for you can you say amen you've given me faith you've given me something let my faith create increase why cry speak and go forward so it's the boldness it's adoption that's what we need more of can you say man we we need to realize what this new birth is doing to us growing more than just salvation when you come back to god are you gonna hand him back say i gave my heart to the lord and that was it i gave my heart to the lord at a camp when i was 10 years old and you hand back and it's all you have is salvation that's what i hand back to you no no no we want to say when he comes back that that thing that he gave me that that power that he gave me it's grown into a full mature son and daughter of god it's grown into something lord look what you gave me but look what it's grown into that's what i want to be able to say and it won't be me that's grown it's that you've done it all by your grace lord but look i never dreamed that i could overcome things like this i never dreamed that i could go this far in the lord and then it speeds ahead to the last thing in matthew 25 to judgment day which is our text and i know for those doctrinally would check me out i know this is not the bride here this is speaking of the sheep and goats and speaking of those who be separated those that were good to the bride those who were respectful to the bride and incidentally i just want to bring it out and divide that properly because you see it's still when this goes on where they're being good to the bride and naked i clothed you and and i fed you when you're thirsty they're doing good works and guess what because they do good works to the bride they are granted eternal life on judgment day they don't have eternal life but they are granted eternal life the sheep are because of their works now they didn't do that by the holy ghost they did it just by works and they were given eternal life later and i want you to notice the connection they were making and that is with the least of the brethren so they're even by mechanics even by doing works they were able to recognize unconsciously not that it was the lord they were doing it to but they were able to give and they were able to respect and they were able to give towards the least of the brethren now most of us would ignore the least of the brethren most of us would ignore the naked the thirsty the hungry the ones in prison the the the ones that are distressed the ones are in these terrible conditions under most cases we kind of have an arm's length with people like that they might smell too much they've got a lot of hang-ups that they've come from under normal circumstances that's not the people we're going and visiting that's not the people we're reaching out to that's not the people we're coming to in gorge towards them but but they're doing it i want to just say if i can divide this properly that if that eternal life is granted to them for for reaching out to those least of the brethren jesus said that was me when you reached out to them you were reaching out to me if they're doing that and get eternal life shouldn't we be reaching out when we already have eternal life so this is the time of the seventh seal all this is going on not at judgement day when the separation sheep goes this is during this time this is happening and actually the bride members is who they're ministering to but some of those bride members came in conditions that were completely sometimes intolerable to deal with broken distressed in prison addictions and if we have eternal life i'm going to read it to you in a minute you must understand eternal life is not something that we get someday it's something that we have now so it will be bringing eternal life to broken lives it will be imparting eternal life to the ones of the least of the brethren not the best of the brethren but all the brethren that are his brethren that are actually when you did this you did it to me can you say praise the lord this group ministers to the least we can attach this to those who are granted eternal life but yet we hear in this hour we have but this isn't it surprising the people in their conditions at the very end naked and this could be spiritually naked spiritually in a few weeks i want to have a subject of naked and modesty i want to talk about modesty i want to title it who decides what's modest who decides what's modest how many knows modesties in the bible see that's not the question who decides what's modest i was going to do it today but the lord wouldn't let me i still got to finish this up who decides what's modest you want me to let you know what sunday so you can be a little sick this is sunday we're taking a trip somewhere you gotta ignore modesty you can't ignore it and you can't interpret what it is for yourself but i was looking into a little bit and it's just spiritually the reason the world has gone naked is because they're naked spiritually and you've got to have the right kind of covering on your soul and you have the right kind of covering on your soul then you have the right righteousness of god you have protection with it but if it's this is if these people are spiritual conditions of being naked hungry thirsty in prison in chains of something bound by something spiritually and they're sick whether physically or emotionally i'm telling you friends we're living in an hour i spoke of it wednesday night we're living in a time that people are coming and there's there's situations people share with me that i'm overwhelmed sometimes to the the damage that satan has done to the emotions and the people's lives there isn't anybody even sitting here that's had a perfect background had a perfect family spoke on betrayal there isn't anybody that hasn't been betrayed by somebody you will be betrayed but it's not about that it's about what you're going to do with it but we're having broken people come to us and guess what i'm one of them you're one of them and the quicker we can quit judging people on the other side and say i'm coming broken they're coming broken the quicker we can see what our calling is these people are coming naked and destitute and bound by addictions and bound by things and under depression we can't beat somebody up from that but i can tell you this i can tell you this if that's who's coming if that's the last group there's a there's a there's a bride who has eternal life she has the answer amen and there isn't any addiction there isn't anything that you went through in your past or present there is anything plaguing your mind that is too big for the message that i'm preaching and the power of god that's available there's anything too big for i have confidence in that here they come this is the way they come and if they come in spiritual conditions like this and they give a ten we give attention to those needs so needy so needy and this is the bride in these conditions but in a natural way she's needy not i shouldn't say in a natural way but even spiritually she comes needy and this group ministers them respects them and meets some of the needs but the people with eternal life listen this is the one we don't run from people like that we don't run away we don't distance ourselves we don't no no no we're saying this is the body of christ and eternal life is working among us working in us in the closing seconds of time can you say amen question is if he said you did it to me and they were granted eternal life shouldn't we who already have eternal life be sensitive to these conditions to minister to them now hopefully i've divided that scripture properly i'm going to read a quote here to finish this up could it be that if we miss the least of the brother and the least likely we miss him could it be that if we miss the least of the brethren we miss him on that day of calvary brother brown says look what that day on calvary did to you it paid your price it settled the question there's several elements of calvary that he brings out in this message and one of them it settled the question settled the sin question your sin be a scarlet they're as white as snow red like prince of white as wool then you have no sin you are perfectly sinless no matter what you've done or what you do you're still sinless as long as you've accepted jesus christ as your savior your sins are forgiven anything is forgiven is remitted and forgot about then what does it do it gives you after that condition it gives you his spirit to follow him and to do as he did for others who are following on he was a ju just one man the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing i want to say is jesus never lived for himself so stop right there see so calvary the power of calvary when we come in face to face with and it's come in our life by experience we know the first thing is it settles the sin question it settles the sin question forever he paid for my sins that's the results of calvary i know you've heard that a million times girl but don't lose the meaning of it because the devil's going to attack you with it i need to hold on calvary paid for my sins he settled the sin question that's not to be brought up anymore can you say amen he's washed away my sin but he said that's not the only thing the power of calvary brings that day of calvary brought us more than just the settlement of sin and that's where you have a lot of denominational churches stop right there our sin has been settled we preached calvary today because he went to the cross the sin says sin question has been settled that's all the further they go but see there's a life that comes from calvary and that is we receive his spirit to follow in the ways that he would be can you say amen now he goes into this subject of the way it will be jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life so what's he saying eternal life is not something we get someday but eternal life came from the power of calvary and we will receive that life in us and it's not it what kind of life was it it was not a selfish life you never get a self-focused selfish life out of the power of calvary if you've experienced calvary you don't get a selfish life you get eternal life and eternal life is an unselfish life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when it come in the lamb of god opens up our understanding of what eternal life is eternal life is an unselfish life eternal life comes through the word of god comes to christ comes from calvary it's not just something we get someday to live eternally in the millennium or any other time it's it's something that we receive by the holy ghost now and we have that life but what is it it's an eternal life and i i just bring you back to what jesus on wednesday night jesus did to handle the betrayal all of his disciples paid to hate him judas betrayed him he was left alone nobody was there i'm saying how did he handle that how did he respond to it he loved them until the end his love didn't stop it didn't go up and down can you say a man they were up and down all the time they were committed to him denied him their emotions were everywhere and that's that's all understandable i i see but i want to be like our lord that was consistent and faithful in his love to them it didn't go up and down i told somebody yesterday on the phone i said if i were to go on people's comments from week to week and the bipolar situation sometimes people are i would have left church a long time ago i'm not depending on the up and downs of people's emotions or their comments against me or the ups and downs of my emotions i want to be consistent and faithful and love god's people until the end my love should never stop because it's eternal and it's unselfish love he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself and he lived for others you receive eternal life by receiving that that day and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others someone said how can you stand and let anybody call you such bad names you don't live for yourself there's a really simple answer to that and he just gave it how can you stand and let somebody call you bad names and not respond none of that's ever happened to you guys when it started to happen to me a lot in my life didn't happen a lot in my life but it happened a lot when i became a landlord brother brother quinlan daryl boy i tell you i found out i heard words i never heard in my life and they were calling me those words praise the lord you live in this world and sometimes people say things stupid within the church i can never guarantee people aren't going to say stupid things against you but i can guarantee you there's an eternal life that knows how to respond that's what i want how do i respond he loved them till the end you live for others that you might redeem that man you become sons and the trouble of it is the church has forgotten they were sons you're a son you're taking christ's place you're a son so don't live to yourself live for others or brother brahma i can't live for this man he said i can live for this man because he sure is a nice man that's not it live for that man who hates you live for that person who would kill you if they could what they done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you that's in your bosom you're facing heaven then stop right there don't go any further listen this is eternal life it's not just that we believe he paid for our sins but that's life is coming through us and working through us that it makes us cause us to live live for a man that hates us to live a person who would kill us if they could that's what it done to him they killed him and he died that he might save them that's eternal life when you that's in your bosom you're facing heaven them how many want that in your bosom but you sacrifice your own things give them up like the sheep gives its wool you look on towards calvary i hope this helps you to get in a place that's what the tabernacle that's what all people has got to do is find out what you are and what's the purpose church isn't going to church the church isn't going to church just to play music sing songs church is a place where correction judgment begins in the house of god if the church can ever come to those fundamental facts that it's not something you try to do you work yourself up to do it's something that's born in you forgive me my pentecostal friend i am pentecostal but my pentecostal friends has got to a spot to where it has to be a lot of fast music beating some bands or clapping hands or tambourines to bring up a shout out that's only emotion they play in the bands before they go to battle they get people in the emotion of battle i believe in music i believe in clapping hands but i believe in these things stop right there go back he's correcting pentecostals not because he's against emotion but when that begins to be worked up by the music we're off track when we're working up emotion and say if we can do this then we've had a good service we're getting off track and there's hundreds of quotes that brother brown is correcting the pentecostals and i think sometimes we should read those because it could correct us sometimes who get off track when we're pushing for such emotion it misdirects people to think that because i'm emotional that i'm getting the holy ghost that's not true usually the motion comes after we've been delivered usually the motion comes after we've heard the word we're stimulated by the word of god and let the emotion flow but when emotion is worked up by the music or by the preacher we cross the line a little bit if we're not careful because the emotion becomes the definition of whether god's doing something or not so to try to keep a balance to say what he's saying a lot of fast music beating some bands clapping cancer to bring up a shout that's only motion may god help us never to go down that path we don't want to do that you never have to bring up a shout of people who are being delivered you never have to work up a shout or work up emotion or work the people into a frenzy and then say we've had a good service i'll tell you we have we there's services i've been in not here other places even in services and it you just here's what we need to do we need to let god do what he wants to do and not pull it our way just let god do what he wants to do let him do his work and that might be a very exuberant emotional service but it might be just a quiet service but god dropped some real solid bombs on the enemy can you say amen and some revelations into the heart of the people that overcoming power is going to make them stand the sons and daughters of god don't ever stop entering into worship remember the bible says the sacrifice of praise so you need to come and bring the sacrament it's the sacrifice work out all that tiredness work out all that thing all the week has been a rough week you're coming the song leader's got to cut you know he's singing and pulling sometimes he shouldn't have to do that you should say this is my time to worship the lord and you should enter in sometimes you shout sometimes a person just sits and cries sometimes they just ponder don't look to the next person and try to copy the next person just yield to the lord and worship him is that okay with everybody i got hundreds of quotes from brother bran corrected the pentecostals but we need to read it ourselves sometimes because we get off track of the imbalance of where things are going we don't have to work anything up because eternal life is working through the word of god and the new birth of the people and he can come and deliver somebody in a moment's time without any emotion involved how many believe that you don't put a a certain thing on god say he has to do it this way or nobody got deliverance sometimes i know people that are in the most emotional services in this message and because i know their lives they didn't get nothing out of that some are getting delivered praise god but i know some and they can't even talk to somebody else that's another brother said i will never talk to them again but boy they shouted all over that building won't talk to another christian i'll never talk to them again they're not getting anything they're just being worked up brother brahman says don't dance or shout any higher than what you're living every day go ahead and dance he never said don't stop dancing shout but don't dance or shout any higher than what you're living can't even talk to another brother holding grudges for years and you're the greatest shouter something's wrong with that something's desperately wrong i'll say this too that we must be careful how we misdirect our young people sometimes because someone who's crying for god might think that if i get it i have to get it like that person over there that's just screaming and shouting they may be getting the genuine thing but you should never feel like i have to do that in order to get something real can i hear something from somebody we have to be so careful of that because he got sincere hearts looking for god and crying for god but young people you you enjoy all the camps and enjoy the presence of the lord here and enjoy and listen don't ever disrespect don't speak against the emotion somebody speaks in times tongues don't speak against it respect it just say praise the lord somebody's being blessed somebody's screaming somebody's getting delivered praise the lord but don't ever be intimidated by that that somehow you didn't get nothing the same god that's making them shout is the same god that can give you something real in your heart as well [Applause] we can't interpret the holy ghost as being an emotion emotion comes with the holy ghost but you could have all the emotion and not have the holy ghost is that okay with everybody so he's correcting the pentecostal exactly exactly true we're going to end here in a minute we ought to have that but you have left the great things undone is that self-sacrifice life that god lives in you automatically doing that which is right because it's right just going on don't even think about it just living it now what jesus said watch how he stated it the works that i do he's doing them right now the works that i'm doing now healing the sick raising the dead opening of the eye is blind these works shall you do also he'll do if you believe in me you do these works and then greater than this shall you do for i go to my father so now he's pointing to the miracles the signs the raising the dead he says the works i do shall you do also i can say in the last 50 60 years while i have been around i have watched the dead raised i've watched the blind eyes open i've seen the same works that jesus did not only in brother branham but in our church cancer delivered can you say man he has fulfilled this in the bride the works that he did we're doing also and it's still going on but jesus said greater works will you do greater than a healing line greater than physical deliverance what could be greater than that the greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer cast out devils by prayer but to impart eternal life what is the greater works that you have the power to impart eternal life to someone else glory be to god the holy ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impart life that's why god come and fill them with the holy ghost not just to do signs not to cast out devils not just but to impart eternal life to someone else because they had eternal life they can impart it to the least of their brother to the least to the worst drug addict to the prostitute can you say that to the mary magdalenes you have to be able willing to reach out to mary magdalene if you have confidence you have eternal life you can't hold it back for certain ones that smell bad to you the greater works was to have the power in the church the holy ghost was coming and giving it to the hands of the church to impart our life oh that's what calvary meant it took stooped degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of god to heal the sick to impart eternal life by giving the holy ghost to obedient believers men who were once unbelievers be made believers and in part spiritual eternal life that's the greater works how much greater is it to say this sick woman laying here i can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he's doing then that's what we're going to do in a minute we're going to have prayer and pray over the sick that's a great thing this sick woman i can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great that's what he's doing then but said greater than yeshua you do i'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while but to give him eternal life which will be eternal forever poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what the greater thing is that's the greatest thing could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him impart that to others amen and amen praise be to god father just had a this phone call this week and said if you'll pray for the sick god's going to do miracles so lord we obey you today but i just don't want to ask for the sick to come but anyone who has a need they don't have that eternal life they don't have that holy spirit within them lord i can lay hands in the sick but i also can lay hands on someone and the life that's in the word that i preach can come in them granted father granted father lord we don't recognize the power that's in the church and lord may we learn that it's it's sometimes the broken that come it's sometimes the least of the brethren the ones that were are least likely to succeed or the least talented or the the least the ones with all the complexes the ones with all the fears the ones that are depressed and distressed it's the ones lord that are naked and afraid and fearful sometimes it's the ones that are in prison and bound by certain things that's the ones that you said when you did it unto them you did it unto me lord i pray that you will call us to reach out and to extend this life to others that we think would be the least to receive it may we be a witness to them as well and impart eternal life to them in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask it amen
