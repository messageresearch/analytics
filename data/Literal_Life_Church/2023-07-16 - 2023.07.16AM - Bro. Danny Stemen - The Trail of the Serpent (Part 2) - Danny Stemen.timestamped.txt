[0:04] with you brother Paul thank you for your
[0:06] hospitality and the love you've shown us
[0:07] and I mean just really nice to reconnect
[0:10] with so many people that we've known
[0:12] through the years and so we just want to
[0:13] say God bless you and we love you with
[0:15] the love of the Lord and amen just
[0:17] appreciate this opportunity to come
[0:19] together amen because we have one thing
[0:21] in common we come from all walks of life
[0:23] and we may not even amen another past
[0:26] life wouldn't even like each other amen
[0:29] but what we have in common draws us
[0:31] together and that's that's and that's
[0:33] the goal of the Gospel is the you until
[0:36] we all come the body of Christ amen not
[0:39] every church but the body the body of
[0:41] Christ come in unity of his faith amen
[0:44] and that's what he's at work doing and
[0:46] so amen it's only he that can do that so
[0:49] God bless you this morning let's just
[0:51] bow our heads for a word of prayer our
[0:53] heavenly father what a privilege it is
[0:55] to Stand Here Lord to minister the word
[0:58] Lord we just pray that you would get me
[1:00] out of the way I do not want to project
[1:02] my own thinking or thought for that
[1:04] would not help the people but Lord we
[1:07] want to glorify your name and lift you
[1:09] up Lord and Lord bring the word let me
[1:12] be planted in your in the people's
[1:14] hearts father and may you have complete
[1:17] control and preeminence if there would
[1:18] be anything Lord any hindering thought
[1:21] or Spirit may it be bound Lord in the
[1:24] name of Jesus Christ father for Lord
[1:26] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:28] Liberty father now I pray Lord that
[1:31] you'd have your way we love you father
[1:33] in Jesus name amen amen God bless you if
[1:37] you turn in your Bibles to the Book of
[1:39] Revelations the 12th chapter
[1:41] last night I I was speaking on the trail
[1:44] of The Serpent and I'm kind of at a at
[1:46] uh it's kind of difficult at times as as
[1:49] a minister when you travel out because
[1:51] at home you can just spend brother
[1:54] Brandon you can just spend as many
[1:55] services you want preaching on a subject
[1:57] and then amen and ice been a number of
[2:00] months speaking on this Trail of the
[2:02] serpent then you come and try to speak a
[2:04] couple services on it and then you
[2:06] basically have spam amen so you just
[2:09] condense everything down and just try to
[2:11] put out a few things but we trust the
[2:13] Lord will take it all and just put it
[2:15] where it needs to be and because he
[2:17] knows the people's hearts and I don't
[2:19] and he does so we just have have
[2:21] confidence in that amen Revelations 12
[2:23] 1-5 we'll read this and let you be
[2:26] seated there appeared a great Wonder in
[2:28] heaven a woman clothed with the sun and
[2:31] the moon under her feet and upon her
[2:32] head a crown of 12 stars and she being
[2:35] with child travail travailing cried
[2:38] travailing in birth and pain to be
[2:41] delivered and there appeared another
[2:43] Wonder in heaven and behold a great red
[2:45] dragon having seven heads and ten horns
[2:48] and seven crowns upon his head heads and
[2:51] his tail drew the third part of the
[2:54] stars of heaven and did cast them to the
[2:56] earth and the dragon stood before the
[2:59] woman which was ready to be delivered
[3:01] for to devour her child as soon it was
[3:04] as it was born and she brought forth a
[3:07] man-child who was to rule all nations
[3:09] with a rod of iron and her child was
[3:11] caught up unto God into his throne you
[3:14] can be seated may the Lord bless the
[3:16] reading of his word
[3:18] last night we had read as a couple of
[3:21] our opening scriptures Isaiah 14. amen
[3:24] where where Isaiah had said what was in
[3:29] This Heart of Lucifer and then we read
[3:34] out of first Thessalonians uh where Paul
[3:37] was speaking and seeing the desire of of
[3:40] Satan's Heart come to fruition and Satan
[3:44] come to that position that he desired to
[3:47] be in uh it had to do uh Paul was
[3:51] comforting the people and he was
[3:53] comforting them with the revelation of
[3:55] the Rapture the coming of the Lord
[3:57] talking to them about the order of of
[4:00] what it would be
[4:02] um and and so forth but he describes to
[4:04] them how this man of sin would be
[4:07] revealed and and he he says in that time
[4:11] of revealing he called it the mystery of
[4:14] an of iniquity working he said there
[4:18] would be a feeling of the son of man and
[4:20] he said at the same time there would be
[4:22] a falling away
[4:23] amen so you have a falling away and at
[4:26] the same time there is a revealing of
[4:28] not the son of man but the man of sin
[4:30] I'm sorry who's be called the the Son of
[4:33] Perdition and and this son of perdition
[4:35] he would come in such a deception his
[4:38] deception would be after the working of
[4:41] Satan with all power and signs and lying
[4:44] wonders with all deceivableness of
[4:47] unrighteousness in them that perish
[4:49] because they receive not the love of the
[4:53] truth now notice he said they had the
[4:56] truth but they didn't love it
[4:59] so if you don't love the truth the value
[5:01] of it is not there for you as you spoke
[5:03] of last night and Satan can rob the
[5:07] effect and I think about that brother
[5:08] Paul the effect of the truth upon the
[5:11] people Jesus said You shall know the
[5:14] truth and the truth shall what set you
[5:17] free so that effect is here this morning
[5:20] that comes with the truth but Satan will
[5:23] try through his deceiving and cooling
[5:26] off of the heart to rob you of the
[5:29] effect of the truth because if he robs
[5:31] you of its effect you'll walk away from
[5:33] it
[5:35] so keep in mind then uh these
[5:38] descriptions of of Lucifer we we spoke
[5:41] about them last night the old serpent
[5:43] the serpent the dragon each one of them
[5:45] with with maybe a a little bit uh
[5:49] description but it's all describing the
[5:51] same person
[5:53] and and he can he can he changes his
[5:55] labels but it's the same person
[5:57] right he's Lucifer son of the morning a
[6:01] worshiper amen but when he fell he
[6:05] became Satan the Devil the serpent
[6:08] because he wasn't the serpent he became
[6:11] the serpent because that's what he used
[6:14] amen he was the old serpent he was
[6:17] abandoned he was a pollen amen and here
[6:20] in Revelations 12 he's a dragon now a
[6:24] dragon is a serpent
[6:25] but he's much larger
[6:28] he's not just in one vessel
[6:31] now he's in a power
[6:33] and I want you I just want to use one
[6:36] thing out of the scripture to describe
[6:38] what I what I want to talk about because
[6:40] uh this is the dragon he's a serpent
[6:44] working now here in Revelations 12
[6:47] through political
[6:49] and religious powers to kill Jesus At
[6:53] Birth
[6:54] remember and and we read it last night
[6:56] and we spoke about this Trail of the
[6:59] serpent and I'm in no means trying to uh
[7:02] assert brother Branham and preach a
[7:04] sermon he never preached at all he
[7:05] didn't preach it so let me preach it I
[7:07] just thought it was a good title
[7:09] you know somebody should use it right
[7:11] Amen brother Alex amen we use that title
[7:14] because it's a good one the trail of the
[7:16] serpent I'm no ways trying to stand up
[7:18] here and say oh this is what brother
[7:19] Madam means you know I'm just taking
[7:21] that title and taking what he said and
[7:23] about it and then we just go from there
[7:26] now he said it was Matthew 24 24 he said
[7:31] it was a Pentecostal move oh a Pentecost
[7:33] was the birth
[7:36] right it was the birth of the church
[7:40] and that's where Satan came in to
[7:43] deceive and we will find from Genesis to
[7:45] Revelations that's always where
[7:48] he corrupted
[7:50] was at the birth
[7:52] because if he can get it stir it to a
[7:55] wrong birth because because be sure
[7:58] every church can produce a birth
[8:02] denominations can produce a birth
[8:05] but it's a church birth
[8:08] but there's one birth that we are
[8:11] interested in and that is the birth the
[8:14] New Birth by the word of God
[8:17] is that right if you have a church birth
[8:20] it'll produce a church action you act
[8:22] like that church you have the same
[8:24] mannerisms of that church you have the
[8:26] same characteristics of that church
[8:28] because that's what you were birthed
[8:29] under that church doctrine but if you
[8:32] come by the word I don't care where that
[8:34] word is it can be in any country but if
[8:37] it's birth under the word it will have
[8:39] the same characteristic and that is the
[8:41] life of Jesus Christ because the
[8:44] interest of the holy spirit is always to
[8:46] teach you the truth of the word
[8:50] it's a corrector
[8:51] Holy Spirit he is the spirit of Truth
[8:54] lead you and guide you into all truth so
[8:58] brother Madam said it's the same he said
[9:01] it is the same the deception in this
[9:03] hour is it is the same betting ground
[9:06] the same church
[9:09] but it is two different fathers
[9:13] now we're we're in the layout of seeing
[9:15] age and I'm not going to get caught up
[9:16] in all the all the political moves that
[9:19] are around our rank so we got to call it
[9:21] this age we've got to call it that age
[9:22] this is the layout of C and H
[9:25] there's a layout has seen age that we
[9:26] are raptured out of
[9:28] and I'm not I'm not just talking about
[9:30] spiritually I'm talking about we are
[9:31] physically raptured out of this age this
[9:34] age is also known as The Rapture time it
[9:37] is also known as the Harvest age is that
[9:39] right it is known as the bride age why
[9:42] is it called all these things because
[9:43] this is the maturing of the word the
[9:46] word could not mature under denomination
[9:49] or organizational system and the Holy
[9:52] Ghost was bound at the door of all these
[9:55] systems Through the Ages that's why we
[9:58] had a period called the Dark Ages
[10:00] it suppressed everything and if you go
[10:03] if you go if you've ever went to any of
[10:06] these art galleries and everything when
[10:07] they come through the Dark Ages you can
[10:09] see the perception of these religious
[10:10] men that would paint it was it was a
[10:12] corrupted version of what God looked
[10:15] like and who he was and it's because
[10:17] they were suppressed even the Bible was
[10:19] kept out of their hands
[10:21] and the only interpretation of the Bible
[10:24] was the priesthood interpreting to them
[10:27] the words
[10:28] so the Holy Ghost was bound
[10:31] but in this age it's come back
[10:34] for a full restoration with the
[10:37] restoration comes the power of the word
[10:39] behind it
[10:40] and the power of the word has a purpose
[10:45] come on Church the power of the word is
[10:47] full Redemption
[10:50] and it's his purpose this morning amen
[10:53] is is brother Branham said that in the
[10:55] Harvest Time which is our time he said
[10:58] there had to come teachers that would
[11:00] bring that false Vine to to a full uh
[11:04] maturity
[11:05] and the only the only only person could
[11:09] bring the the bride to the full maturity
[11:12] had to come through a prophet
[11:15] surely the Lord will do nothing except
[11:19] he revealeth his secrets to his servants
[11:21] of prophet Satan knows this
[11:24] Satan knows this so this this I wanted
[11:27] to put this picture in your mind of what
[11:29] we read there in Revelations 12 here is
[11:31] the dragon this Force this power
[11:33] standing before the church to kill the
[11:37] life
[11:39] as soon as it's birthed
[11:43] amen
[11:45] there's a beast at the beginning it's a
[11:47] beast at the end
[11:49] you see at the beginning we are given
[11:51] the serpent we are shown the serpent God
[11:53] exposes his work and we'll go back to
[11:55] that in a minute he exposes him out of
[11:57] that comes the mark of what the mark of
[12:00] the beast
[12:02] well the mark of the beast has to follow
[12:04] what God is doing
[12:07] he had the Seal of God and you have the
[12:09] mark of the beast
[12:11] Amen brother bam said you had twins he
[12:14] had natural twins amen and twins come in
[12:17] every Revival
[12:19] and we're in the bride's Revival
[12:22] the bride's Revival is amen the word
[12:25] Revival
[12:26] that amen was promised for this hour
[12:30] amen and brother Branham he spoke about
[12:32] it you can go back and read it in excuse
[12:35] me the third seal he said why is
[12:36] everybody crying he said they're crying
[12:38] out for a Revival
[12:41] he said he'll take those seven on
[12:43] unknown Thunders to wake the bride up
[12:47] she's not awake it's going to take these
[12:50] to wake the bride up he said we haven't
[12:51] had a move of God yet to wake her up
[12:56] hope you're listening
[12:57] it would take those Thunders to wake her
[13:00] up
[13:01] a year later recognizing your day in
[13:03] this message he's preaching again and he
[13:05] says why is everybody crying he said you
[13:07] listen they're saying we need a Revival
[13:08] we need a Revival fast pray we need a
[13:10] Revival he said why do they do that he
[13:13] said they have not recognized The
[13:15] Awakening of the Bride now a prophet
[13:18] said it would take the seven unknown
[13:20] Thunders to wake him up God did not
[13:22] leave that up to an organization neither
[13:24] did he leave it up to a special Apostle
[13:26] he brought it through the ministry of a
[13:29] Vindicated Malachi for a prophet and the
[13:32] Thunders were uttered their voices
[13:33] through that Ministry and that's what
[13:36] wakes us up that's the only thing that
[13:39] can breed a bride to birth
[13:43] I'm not here Amen to preach a bunch of
[13:45] Doctrine but we're here to show that why
[13:47] there is a revival going on in the bride
[13:51] and it's a word Revival
[13:56] it's not stirring us back to something
[13:58] Foreigner it's stirring us ahead to the
[14:02] Fulfillment of Prophecy
[14:04] Hallelujah now you just watch the
[14:06] brother bam said to you watch how
[14:08] cunning he is he said it's it's two
[14:11] together he said you had Esau Jacob you
[14:13] had you had uh Cain and Abel you have
[14:15] Judas and Jesus they're just brothers in
[14:18] the same tribe he said even the Holy
[14:20] Ghost
[14:21] in the Antichrist are twins
[14:25] praise the Lord
[14:27] so with this Junction
[14:29] amen it's this Junction that I'm reading
[14:31] to you in Revelation 12. that was a
[14:33] junction of time
[14:34] it was a time of transition
[14:36] for here you have the woman amen and she
[14:39] she and I just need to you just forgive
[14:42] me here as I go back to it because I got
[14:44] to keep keep it before me because I
[14:47] can't all remember it all anymore
[14:49] amen just something that happened
[14:52] I don't know what it is
[14:54] but the scripture says there's a great
[14:56] Wonder in heaven
[14:59] amen notice where she's at she's in
[15:01] heaven
[15:03] a woman clothed with the Sun
[15:06] she's clothed with the sun and the moon
[15:09] is under her feet so she's in a
[15:12] dispensation a transition
[15:14] the law which is the moon is passing
[15:18] away
[15:19] it's changing now she's clothed in the
[15:22] sun they're moved into the the coming of
[15:25] the Lord
[15:26] right amen she's crowned with 12 Stars
[15:30] that's the apostolic doctrine that is
[15:33] coming I'm only quoting to you a prophet
[15:35] amen he's now so the church is bringing
[15:39] forth Jesus Christ but notice the
[15:42] position of the Red Dragon
[15:45] he stands in front of the church
[15:48] to hinder the church
[15:51] and when the birth is coming forth he's
[15:53] going to devour it now we read the
[15:55] scripture and we said it last night
[15:57] Satan tells you he's going to do
[15:59] something to you and he's very good at
[16:01] doing it I know I mean he has ordered
[16:03] your life and told you what's going to
[16:05] happen he's he's or he knows all about
[16:07] your genealogies he studied him I know
[16:09] hey you might be on An ancestry kick or
[16:11] something like that Satan already knew
[16:14] your ancestors he knows all your
[16:16] genealogies he knows the downfalls he
[16:19] knows amen the bad apples and he tells
[16:21] you you're that one and you're this one
[16:23] and that one and because I know your
[16:25] past I can tell you what your future is
[16:27] but Jesus says when he says a lie he is
[16:30] speaking of himself
[16:32] so when he's telling you something it's
[16:34] not the truth
[16:37] all right amen he'll tell you you can't
[16:40] get the Holy Ghost he tell you you've
[16:42] sinned away your day of Grace well
[16:43] there's a reason he's telling you that
[16:45] that's his problem that's not my problem
[16:48] amen he send away his day of Grace but
[16:51] there's Grace for you
[16:54] there's nobody without hope here this
[16:57] morning
[16:58] and it's our it's our Command as a
[17:01] minister to bring that hope to you and
[17:03] send it out so that the eye of faith can
[17:05] see it and the Hand of faith can reach
[17:08] out and take it
[17:09] [Applause]
[17:10] God wants you to see it and if you see
[17:12] it he wants you to say it
[17:15] what do you see Jeremiah I see an almond
[17:18] Rod he said I will watch over my words
[17:21] and perform it but you have to say it
[17:25] so there it was
[17:27] amen the Orthodox Church passing away
[17:29] the Apostolic Church coming in
[17:32] in brother Branham he pinpoints us down
[17:35] to this time the Roman Empire issued a
[17:37] proclamation to kill all the children
[17:39] from two years old and down to kill
[17:41] Christ Jesus now
[17:44] I want to I want to pay attention here
[17:47] because in the Garden of Eden we see a
[17:50] serpent
[17:52] now here's it's a dragon the garden it's
[17:55] a serpent
[17:57] the Bible says he's more subtle
[18:00] and all the beasts of the field
[18:03] and the prophet said he had
[18:04] characteristics physical characteristics
[18:07] that Satan took advantage of it tells us
[18:10] Satan's a planner
[18:12] he watches physical characteristics
[18:16] and he plans around that for the
[18:19] downfall listen and you don't feel sorry
[18:21] for the serpent but it was the downfall
[18:23] of a serpent
[18:26] right and he took advantage of that
[18:29] and you can see and he used those
[18:32] characteristics with great success
[18:34] against the woman
[18:38] we can see the subtlety and the cunning
[18:40] of Satan that he deceived Eve you you
[18:42] see now listen uh you know if everything
[18:44] was going right in my life and and the
[18:47] atmospheres were perfect and I had a uh
[18:49] my whole family was serving God I I know
[18:52] I would serve him and well hold on a
[18:55] minute
[18:56] because the Bible says
[18:58] shows us that Eve is in the midst of
[19:01] paradise
[19:02] amen with perfect atmosphere
[19:05] perfect Fellowship Perfect Harmony in
[19:09] marriage
[19:10] perfect health they had the power and
[19:14] authority by the word of God
[19:18] they lacked nothing God came down in the
[19:21] cold of the evening and fellowship with
[19:24] him and in that kind of atmosphere
[19:28] the spirit of a twin
[19:32] came in
[19:37] I remember where the revealing is of the
[19:40] man of sin there's a falling away
[19:45] where the word is
[19:47] there is a deception
[19:50] that will come in
[19:53] amen
[19:55] I want to want to see this because if
[19:58] you notice the Canon of Satan he not
[20:00] only studied the physical
[20:01] characteristics of of the serpent he
[20:03] studied the physical characteristics of
[20:05] the woman
[20:06] because he had knowledge of the woman
[20:09] before Adam did
[20:11] and he used that knowledge to bring this
[20:14] Union a false Union
[20:17] but why was he doing that we'll come to
[20:20] that in a minute because he knew the
[20:22] prophecy the command he attacked the
[20:25] message of the hour to multiply
[20:30] he attacked the birth
[20:36] so he done it with a false Union
[20:39] that brings forth life and even deceives
[20:43] the church till she says I have gotten a
[20:45] man from the Lord
[20:48] this birth is of the Lord
[20:52] brother Branham said she actually
[20:54] believed that at first
[21:00] um
[21:01] so we can see that he comes this is the
[21:04] tactic he used to just he deceived the
[21:06] woman he knew he could not deceive Adam
[21:14] so he come to the woman who who he knew
[21:17] was weaker and could be deceived the
[21:20] woman is a type of the church
[21:23] so we're not discriminating between men
[21:25] and women here now that's for a marriage
[21:27] sermon that brother Paul can preach
[21:29] we're talking about the church and the
[21:32] church is weak in the sense she can
[21:35] listen to Doctrine that's not of God and
[21:38] be convinced to go another way
[21:42] you cannot deceive the man Christ Jesus
[21:46] because he said Satan has no part in me
[21:51] he is not on my level he's not in my
[21:53] equal he wants you to think he has power
[21:56] to to make your life better he does not
[21:59] have power to make your life better
[22:00] there's one man in this room this
[22:03] morning who has the power to change your
[22:06] life to lift it up
[22:10] Glory
[22:14] we don't have much more information than
[22:17] on the serpent other than what we see we
[22:21] see a serpent he's more subtle than than
[22:23] all the beasts we know he's upright we
[22:25] know he can talk we know he can reason
[22:26] we know that his blood could and did
[22:29] Mingle
[22:30] with the human race
[22:33] right but now in Revelations 12 and
[22:36] Revelations 13 we are seen by Vision a
[22:39] more developed serpent
[22:42] he's more developed now he's called the
[22:44] dragon it's more description of the
[22:47] Beast
[22:48] you know the church will not make the
[22:51] connection with the dragon
[22:52] in the garden
[22:54] it takes a prophet to do that
[22:57] Amen in this chapter we may see as in a
[23:01] Revelations 12 we may see is in a
[23:03] panorama the entire conflict between the
[23:07] principles of Good and Evil between God
[23:09] and Satan
[23:11] we have set before us the old original
[23:14] quarrel between the woman and the
[23:16] serpent
[23:19] which was
[23:21] I'll put enmity between thee and the
[23:24] woman between thy seed and her seed
[23:26] there'll always be an enmity
[23:30] and and so you can see you can see by
[23:33] scripture how both have developed
[23:36] now we're in Revelation
[23:38] and both have developed
[23:40] and one has become a queen
[23:44] decked with with the celestial
[23:48] amen and the other is a python with a
[23:51] tail so vast
[23:53] that he threatens to to destroy the
[23:56] stars with it
[23:57] with his sweep and he's successful in
[24:00] taking
[24:01] a great number of them brother random
[24:03] said it wasn't the tale t-a-i-l he said
[24:06] it was the t-a-l-e that he told in
[24:09] heaven now he's still telling a tale
[24:14] who do you think he's going to attack I
[24:17] do not see Satan out there trying to
[24:19] destroy the reputation of of Billy
[24:21] Graham
[24:23] amen there's not a hatred toward Billy
[24:25] Graham
[24:26] like there is toward William Branham but
[24:29] why is there a hatred towards William
[24:31] Branham amen it wasn't Billy Graham that
[24:33] preached the serpent seed amen but the
[24:37] serpent seed was revealed under the
[24:39] opening of those Thunders and Satan
[24:42] knows that when he's exposed he loses
[24:44] trophies now here's the thing about God
[24:46] Amen Satan can have a trophy room and
[24:49] you may be the centerpiece of that
[24:51] trophy room but God has the power to go
[24:54] into that trophy room and take it out of
[24:57] Satan's home
[24:59] oh Hallelujah
[25:01] Satan amen amen he does not open the
[25:05] door of his prison but God has the keys
[25:07] to it
[25:10] amen
[25:13] so we see now the church is developed
[25:16] but here's one more thing I want to show
[25:18] about this Dragon before we go back to
[25:20] the the beginning
[25:22] the python is red
[25:25] he's the Red Dragon
[25:28] red is the color of Edom
[25:31] one of the twins
[25:34] the adversary of the Lord the adversary
[25:35] of Israel
[25:39] it's the color of the Antichrist
[25:42] amen what was Edom Edom was the name the
[25:46] name change of Esau
[25:49] right and it signified he got his name
[25:53] changed when he sold out his Birthright
[25:57] [Music]
[25:59] he was already read
[26:02] but when he he sold out his Birthright
[26:04] they changed his name to Edom
[26:07] amen because now he has sold it out for
[26:11] his Passions
[26:13] for his appetite
[26:16] see it was the appetite that Satan
[26:19] introduced to Eve
[26:23] and the appetite has has the ability to
[26:27] change your life path
[26:30] why did the Lord say oh taste and see do
[26:34] you know when David wrote that
[26:37] you know when David wrote Oh taste and
[26:39] see that the Lord is good when he had
[26:41] been out of the will of the Lord and was
[26:44] down in the Philistines Camp amen he was
[26:46] going to help them fight Israel and some
[26:49] of the men amen are the princes of of
[26:51] the Philistines looked at David and said
[26:54] is this not the one they were singing
[26:56] songs about
[26:59] you know a Believer can get out of
[27:00] position
[27:02] amen but God has said something over
[27:05] their life
[27:06] that can never be taken away from them
[27:09] hallelujah amen and God spoke it amen
[27:12] they sung amen Saul has us thousands and
[27:15] David has his is this not the one they
[27:18] said would be the king of Israel
[27:20] and David changed himself in that moment
[27:23] and acted like a madman and scrabbled at
[27:25] the door and spit and he was running
[27:27] down his beard and he escaped and he
[27:30] went to the cave of agilom and there he
[27:33] wrote
[27:34] oh taste and see
[27:36] that the Lord is good
[27:39] Hallelujah why because you eat the word
[27:42] it also changes your life
[27:46] we said last night Amen to eat the word
[27:49] and it's a command of our day to eat the
[27:52] book to eat the book is a change it'll
[27:56] change you he's not telling you just
[27:58] nibble on it
[28:00] just taste it and put it back on the
[28:02] Shelf he's telling you eat it to develop
[28:04] an appetite for the words
[28:06] [Applause]
[28:09] praise the Lord
[28:11] we only see this
[28:13] spirit is one that rejected the
[28:15] birthright for the appetite
[28:17] amen and that is the embodiment of
[28:20] Esau's character it's a religious
[28:22] character but it's a spirit that God
[28:23] hates
[28:25] amen
[28:28] here's here's Satan's intention in the
[28:30] in the song of Moses
[28:33] it's a Red Sea Moses saying these words
[28:36] the enemy said I will pursue
[28:39] I'll overtake
[28:40] I'll divide the spoil my lust shall be
[28:43] satisfied upon them I'll draw my sword
[28:46] and my hand shall destroy them that's
[28:49] his mind
[28:52] that's his spirit
[28:54] that's the spirit of the enemy
[28:56] who opens not the house of his prisoners
[29:00] somebody can be sitting here this
[29:02] morning without hope
[29:03] because he doesn't open up the house
[29:07] of his prisoners
[29:08] he's a real enemy
[29:11] and all these names that I described to
[29:13] you and we mentioned them last night and
[29:14] spoke of some of them this morning it
[29:16] shows how much of an enemy he is because
[29:19] of his adaptability he adapts
[29:24] he adapts
[29:27] he presents himself a man as an angel of
[29:30] Light he adapts
[29:32] he he presents himself as a minister
[29:36] somebody who cares for you
[29:38] he will present himself as a believing
[29:41] church member
[29:45] because he has studied characteristics
[29:49] and he knows how dangerous it is to
[29:52] reason
[29:57] you remember Judas was one of the twelve
[30:00] if I would ask every one of you to to
[30:03] paint a picture of What Judas looked
[30:05] like you would probably not be very
[30:08] flattering in your depiction
[30:10] right
[30:12] because of his reputation
[30:15] you would want to put something in there
[30:17] that would look like he was capable of
[30:21] doing what he's doing what does a Trader
[30:22] look like to you
[30:25] you know you're not going to put him up
[30:27] there amen as one of the 12 working
[30:30] miracles
[30:32] preaching a sermon like this morning and
[30:34] people praising the Lord
[30:36] but that was Judas
[30:39] Judas was also under the command of the
[30:42] word go out and heal the sick and cast
[30:44] out devils
[30:45] announce my coming to the cities as you
[30:48] go
[30:50] Judas did not have a devilish Ministry
[30:52] he didn't want slouch around and and try
[30:55] to whisper in people's ears he had a
[30:58] holy ghost Ministry
[31:00] [Music]
[31:04] that's right the only thing he could not
[31:06] do is come up to birth
[31:11] right he could not come up to birth and
[31:13] because he had that characteristic that
[31:15] he could not receive all of the word
[31:19] Satan capitalized on that
[31:23] I can use this man
[31:25] and that man somebody in the message
[31:28] church will fulfill my words
[31:32] sell me for 30 pieces of silver the
[31:36] price of a Slave
[31:38] [Music]
[31:41] and Judas was a message believer
[31:43] who could sell the Lord
[31:46] back to the religious system
[31:49] because he knew the places Jesus was
[31:52] he could point out the quotes he didn't
[31:54] agree with
[31:58] and he became a betrayer
[32:00] the the thing with Cain and the thing
[32:03] with Judas is they recognized what they
[32:06] done
[32:07] after it was too late God have mercy on
[32:10] these men and women who are spouting out
[32:12] nonsense and they know nothing about
[32:14] what they're talking about I don't care
[32:16] what I do not care what the internet
[32:18] says or what somebody acts like they
[32:20] have all the information on William
[32:21] Brown I'm like we never had that before
[32:23] I want to tell you what God uses a
[32:26] prophet as a channel for himself to come
[32:28] down and meet you personally all you
[32:31] telling me is you never met God
[32:33] [Music]
[32:35] oh
[32:36] and I challenge you where do you go
[32:41] I'm screaming too loud ain't I but I
[32:43] found out with Satan he's deaf at times
[32:46] and I'm sick and tired of his hold over
[32:48] people's lives and the lies he tells to
[32:51] you I want you to know you do not have
[32:53] to live under that kind of lie
[32:55] I stake my life on this word
[32:58] [Applause]
[33:00] this word is the truth
[33:03] and it don't have to be filtered through
[33:05] another Channel
[33:12] this is how Satan hides Satan hid behind
[33:15] Judas
[33:19] Jesus was so lovely
[33:21] that even served communion to this man
[33:25] knowing what this man would do to him
[33:29] amen it was in that time of communion
[33:31] that Saint had entered in
[33:34] amends
[33:36] but God has exposed Satan
[33:39] by sending Messengers
[33:41] that would unmask him
[33:43] and if you want to find his Trail
[33:46] you can see it
[33:48] because God has sent his word so you can
[33:50] see it
[33:53] Satan has proven over and over what a
[33:55] champion he is
[34:00] as it was said in the days of Goliath
[34:01] he's been a champion from his youth
[34:04] it's his early days
[34:06] but the thought of his Hearts has been
[34:07] revealed just as the syrians told their
[34:09] King in the days of Elisha he said the
[34:11] even the word spoken in his bed chamber
[34:13] are there known
[34:15] that's what Isaiah did he exposed the
[34:17] thoughts of his heart
[34:20] I'll exalt my throne above the Stars ah
[34:22] of God I'll sit upon the Mount of the
[34:24] congregation the sides of the north I'll
[34:26] Ascend above the heights of the clouds
[34:27] I'll be like the most high but the
[34:29] response of the holy spirit is on
[34:31] Satan's declaration of war is you shall
[34:34] be brought down to Hell once you know
[34:36] hell was not created for you
[34:40] it was created for the devil and his
[34:42] angels
[34:44] come on the Lake of Fire was not created
[34:46] for you it was created for the devil and
[34:48] his angels
[34:52] amen but brother random said that first
[34:54] battle is in heaven
[34:56] said he was cast out and now it has
[34:59] fallen on human beings you are fighting
[35:03] battles this morning that first waged
[35:05] war Before Time
[35:09] that's why it's something that's hard to
[35:12] grasp and has such ability to pull down
[35:15] because if it could pull down Angels it
[35:17] can pull down your emotions
[35:20] it can meddle in your families
[35:23] it'll meddle in your hunger your
[35:25] spiritual hunger and in your walk with
[35:27] God
[35:28] it will focus your attention on failures
[35:31] and not on victories
[35:37] because he's a champion
[35:41] he knew what it meant for a giant to
[35:44] strut for in front of sons of God for 40
[35:47] days and not one of them would move out
[35:50] of fear
[35:52] because of the words
[35:56] what have you done since Satan began
[35:58] talking to you
[35:59] he just holds you powerless sitting
[36:01] there in the tent sons of God sitting in
[36:04] the promised land and refusing to fight
[36:06] the enemy because he's not going to stop
[36:08] with you he's going to take your spouse
[36:10] and he's not going to stop with your
[36:12] spouse he's going to take your children
[36:13] and he's not going to stop with your
[36:15] children it's going to come into your
[36:17] grandchildren and then the next
[36:18] Generation that's his desire
[36:21] hey man but there's some Davids in here
[36:23] that can hear the words when that enemy
[36:27] speaks out it strikes something in my
[36:29] heart that's not my God
[36:32] how dare the enemy challenge the armies
[36:35] of the Living God I want you to know
[36:38] what army I'm associated with I'm
[36:40] associated with the armies of a living
[36:42] God
[36:45] by God's Alive
[36:47] Amen in the book of uh in the church age
[36:50] book The thyatar and church age there's
[36:52] there's that portion of they have not
[36:54] known the depths of Satan he's speaking
[36:56] to them in a thought Iron Age and he
[36:59] said the depths of Satan is very simple
[37:02] Amen to to to understand he said when a
[37:06] man experiences the depth of God in his
[37:10] life it is an actual personal experience
[37:13] of the spirit of God indwelling him and
[37:17] in his mind in his mind is illuminated
[37:20] by the wisdom and knowledge of God
[37:22] through the word but the depth of Satan
[37:26] will be that he will attempt to destroy
[37:28] this reality
[37:30] he will always attempt to make a
[37:32] substitute for the reality of God
[37:35] there's the twin
[37:38] how will he do it he will take away the
[37:41] knowledge of the truth
[37:44] why do you think he's attacking the way
[37:46] he is today
[37:48] because he's trying to take away the
[37:50] knowledge of the truth because if you
[37:52] lose confidence in the truth you won't
[37:54] search out the truth and you lose the
[37:57] knowledge of the truth and here destroy
[37:59] the word by then putting forth his
[38:02] alternative
[38:07] he was talking to message Folk
[38:14] and then
[38:15] he will say yea hath God said is this
[38:18] what he said
[38:20] he'll then substitute the personal
[38:22] Christ in your spirit
[38:28] and the born-again experience that's
[38:32] what he did with Israel he caused Israel
[38:34] to do the same by a human being reigning
[38:37] as king
[38:39] instead of God
[38:43] the born-again experience will be
[38:45] rejected
[38:46] in favor for church joining
[38:51] Satan came to destroy
[38:53] God's purpose
[38:56] and that is to attack the anointed sons
[38:58] of God what did John say the Book of
[38:59] John first John
[39:01] he said beloved now
[39:03] we are the sons of God
[39:06] Satan's attacking that position
[39:13] I won't hold you much longer
[39:15] I forgot to set my clock
[39:22] so the word exposes Satan now I just
[39:25] want to speak about Adam and Eve before
[39:27] it closed
[39:29] we do not read of Adam and Eve having
[39:31] the knowledge of The Serpent and his
[39:34] characteristics that could be used
[39:36] against them why didn't God tell them
[39:44] you see God don't tell you things
[39:47] that will test you
[39:50] because they're there
[39:52] to test you
[39:57] I want you to know
[39:59] God has never lost a test
[40:02] you may have but God never has
[40:13] we do know
[40:15] and Adam would have had knowledge of
[40:17] this
[40:19] that he had Dominion
[40:22] over the serpent
[40:29] remember
[40:30] he had Dominion
[40:33] the Beast beginning is a beast at the
[40:35] end if he had Dominion then Gus Dominion
[40:37] now
[40:40] to beast in the Garden of Eden and the
[40:43] Beast and Satan's eaten
[40:45] because that was the Garden of Eden
[40:46] perfect atmosphere
[40:48] perfect health
[40:52] perfect communion Perfect Harmony
[40:56] we're not in that Garden
[41:00] we're in Satan's Eden
[41:02] we struggle with health
[41:05] marriage is struggle
[41:09] the harmonies get mixed up
[41:12] communion between Brethren gets divided
[41:17] Satan's Eden and Satan's Eden he is
[41:20] actually attacked the very command and
[41:22] creation of God by denying that we are
[41:26] creation of God and that no matter what
[41:29] you were at Birth you can be whatever
[41:31] you want to be you can be fluid you can
[41:35] choose if you want to just think in your
[41:38] mind
[41:39] oh you thought that way didn't you Satan
[41:43] why does he try to change the stature of
[41:47] a man to a woman and a woman to a man
[41:50] because in his heart he wants to be a
[41:52] son of God
[41:55] and he cannot be
[41:57] and this whole age of Satan's Eden is
[42:00] shouting out the sin in the garden
[42:02] because it's nothing but sexual
[42:05] perversion and it's permeated the
[42:08] atmospheres and and permeated culture
[42:11] and permeated politics and permeated the
[42:15] church there'll only be one righteous
[42:19] that sons of God that amen came under
[42:22] the blood that was shed amen and brother
[42:25] Branham says you can fall to one another
[42:27] but to God he can only see you through
[42:30] the blood amen Satan attacks the power
[42:33] of the blood by trying to say he's off
[42:35] The Mercy Seat he's not mediating
[42:37] anymore but I see where brother banham
[42:39] said amen get the book of redemption is
[42:42] still being read and it's when the last
[42:45] one comes in is when we leave I want you
[42:48] to know the book of redemption is still
[42:50] being read this morning brother Doug
[42:52] he's reading it over your life
[42:55] it might have started out in darkness
[42:57] and confusion but as he reads that book
[43:00] it comes up
[43:02] Hallelujah
[43:04] I'm about to act non-mennonite
[43:10] hmm
[43:12] two times we get stirred
[43:17] tacking your position when you say son
[43:19] of God put yourself there because that's
[43:21] who you are I don't care what the
[43:23] devil's lied to you and even where
[43:25] you're at in your life God has said over
[43:27] you you're a Son of God he didn't say
[43:29] that when you were born again he said
[43:31] that while you were yet in sin when the
[43:34] Holy Ghost fell upon them in Corinth
[43:36] when it fell upon them in Pentecost it
[43:38] fell upon Sons
[43:40] [Applause]
[43:42] you did not become a son by the Holy
[43:45] Ghost
[43:45] you were already sons and he knows his
[43:49] sons and his daughters that are here
[43:51] this morning and the same word that
[43:54] brought him to life there is the same
[43:56] word this morning
[44:00] praise the Lord
[44:02] if you look at the origins of man Adam
[44:04] was the Son of God the attribute of
[44:06] God's Own thought placed on Earth the
[44:08] Bible says and he's a secondary god with
[44:10] jurisdiction over everything pertaining
[44:13] to Earth
[44:14] Superior he's Superior to all things of
[44:17] the on Earth
[44:19] no I am not equal to a ear of corn
[44:24] do not care what the scientists say or
[44:26] any movement I am not equal to a cat
[44:30] or a dog
[44:32] come on I have more value our babies
[44:34] have more value than the life of a dog
[44:37] I'm sorry dog lovers
[44:41] come on Church
[44:43] we have more value because we have a
[44:45] soul
[44:47] that Soul was placed here to have
[44:49] jurisdiction over animal life
[44:54] amen
[44:56] he was God's Own expression his God's
[44:59] Own thoughts living in flesh
[45:01] Superior to everything on Earth
[45:04] everything obeyed Adam
[45:07] because God gave him power over it all
[45:12] but where Adam fell
[45:15] was in the power that he had to make of
[45:18] his own self
[45:22] the Brennan spoke that and fundamental
[45:24] Foundation of faith said that's where
[45:26] Adam fell
[45:27] the power to make his own self
[45:32] I want I want to put this out here for
[45:34] you
[45:35] because where that power was and it's
[45:37] the word that gives you that power
[45:40] where that power was this position
[45:44] of a son is where he fell he fell in his
[45:48] identity
[45:51] you see this is why God is against
[45:52] organization
[45:55] this is why he's against Church
[45:57] identities
[46:01] amen because you fail to reach
[46:06] what God has ordained for you
[46:10] Adam's own God's Own thoughts Living In
[46:13] the Flesh of Adams Superior to animalize
[46:15] Superior to the winds and elements
[46:17] Superior to all plant life everything
[46:18] obeyed Adam
[46:20] amen but he fell in that place of his
[46:23] identity and he lost fellowship with his
[46:26] father and when he did he lost power
[46:29] over the Earth and lost his friendship
[46:31] with God and I want you to notice what
[46:33] Adam fell before he fell before the
[46:35] serpent
[46:38] a beast of a lower order
[46:45] amen
[46:47] something of a lower order
[46:50] was the cause of the woman being
[46:53] deceived something Adam had power over
[46:57] is what he felt too
[47:01] and I want to say that this morning to
[47:03] you as sons of God you are not here to
[47:06] be held captive by something of a lower
[47:09] order
[47:11] something of the flesh
[47:14] passions of the flesh
[47:16] lust of the eyes the pride of life all
[47:20] these are lower order
[47:22] you're not made to be captive to a
[47:24] genealogy of of Fallen parents and the
[47:27] Fallen order of this Earth we are not
[47:30] made to be captive to somebody of a
[47:33] lower order
[47:36] we're thinking that that lower order has
[47:39] power over you to keep you
[47:44] but this serpent who is of a lower order
[47:48] brother Branham said in one place and I
[47:52] can't remember exactly where it is and
[47:53] I'm not going to say false Doctrine you
[47:55] can go look it up
[47:57] he said that the serpent was more
[48:00] attractive
[48:04] than Adam
[48:08] well that's a marriage seminar isn't it
[48:14] could you be attracted to a serpent
[48:19] because he didn't look like what they do
[48:21] now
[48:27] and tell you this about your friends
[48:29] of a lower order they're not your
[48:31] friends
[48:35] brother Branham said in the falling part
[48:37] of the world he said this Jezebel system
[48:39] of the devil's Got the Whole World in
[48:40] corruption and not a sound place in it
[48:42] it's all putrefied sores of cancer
[48:45] malignancy of the devil eating the very
[48:47] core out of the systems that they've got
[48:49] set up here Satan is a vulture feeding
[48:52] upon his own kingdom he's a devil he's
[48:55] impure he's the father of a lie and he
[48:58] feeds upon the Flesh of his own Dev of
[49:01] his own people that's the devil your
[49:04] so-called friend
[49:06] feeds upon your flesh
[49:13] the Garden of Eden is a place of
[49:14] Fellowship
[49:16] the Garden of Eden was actually called
[49:19] The Doorway to heaven
[49:21] that's what the Garden of Eden is the
[49:23] doorway to heaven the place where God
[49:25] came to fellowship with his people
[49:29] it's a place where he God had
[49:31] commissioned the couple to multiply and
[49:34] replenish the Earth and subdue it
[49:37] the commission to Adam the man was to
[49:41] multiply and replenish if you study that
[49:44] that meant he was charged with
[49:46] cultivating it and bringing out more
[49:49] than what the eye sees
[49:51] you see we look at the scripture and
[49:53] we're commanded to do as Adam is
[49:55] commanded we're we're commanded to
[49:58] multiply and replenish
[50:01] and cultivate the word of God don't let
[50:04] it just set in the pages and be read let
[50:08] it multiply in the people's life and
[50:10] bring forth fruits that is there you're
[50:13] commanded as a Son of God to cultivate
[50:16] the word
[50:21] amen you have that power
[50:25] it's placed there by God in men
[50:29] Eden means it's a delightful place this
[50:32] place with God is delightful it's a
[50:35] place of pleasure it's a place of
[50:36] paradise
[50:38] it wasn't that that place was a better
[50:40] piece of ground than anywhere else but
[50:42] it was where God came
[50:44] it's where he fellowshipped
[50:46] amen
[50:47] amen God also told him to keep it to
[50:50] preserve it to guard it keep it and
[50:52] guard it
[50:54] Judas tells us to contend
[50:56] for the original faith
[50:58] not for your church Faith brother
[51:00] Branham said he said we must be stable
[51:03] but don't be stable in your church
[51:05] doctrine
[51:06] we can be stable in church doctrine he
[51:08] said but you must be stable in Bible
[51:11] Doctrine
[51:13] you'll find somebody they're messed up
[51:15] in their life it could be marriage and
[51:17] divorce or someone they're going to go
[51:18] around as preachers and find out who
[51:20] supports their situation it's not
[51:22] looking for the they're looking for a
[51:24] church doctrine by they're not looking
[51:26] for Bible doctrine that can correct
[51:27] their life
[51:29] so we're not to be stable in church
[51:32] doctrine or men's thoughts
[51:35] don't get messed up with William
[51:37] branham's preaching and think it's men's
[51:39] thoughts we have not followed cunningly
[51:42] devised Fables
[51:46] this is the word of God
[51:51] we find out that as soon as the church
[51:53] or the woman comes on the scene we're
[51:55] introduced to the serpent
[51:57] and we know what happened
[52:00] in one day
[52:02] one day
[52:04] an action that took place a deception
[52:07] that resulted in adultery in one day
[52:11] turned all the potential Lane out there
[52:14] turned it into a waste howling
[52:16] wilderness
[52:19] the first Adam did that
[52:21] everything changed on that day
[52:23] a man who was Superior to what happened
[52:26] to him
[52:27] fell
[52:31] we know how Adam was
[52:34] because of how Jesus was
[52:37] Jesus walked on water Adam walked on
[52:39] water Jesus could speak to the elements
[52:41] Adam could speak to the elements
[52:45] Adam was the first Adam Jesus is the
[52:47] second Adam
[52:48] he was given jurisdiction
[52:51] over everything Superior
[52:53] God
[52:56] of the Earth
[53:02] there's attributes in God
[53:05] that God is going to use to expose the
[53:08] trail of the serpent
[53:10] and to show that no matter how close
[53:13] that trail weaves its way into your home
[53:17] the attribute of God
[53:20] will expose it
[53:22] and show that it does not have the power
[53:26] to have the last word
[53:28] the book of redemption
[53:30] is still being read
[53:33] what do you mean brother Danny when Eve
[53:35] comes back
[53:37] Adam
[53:38] and says
[53:40] what has happened to me
[53:43] she's convinced that what has happened
[53:45] to her is good
[53:52] she gives it to Adam she's convinced
[53:55] what she's heard she doesn't realize and
[53:57] I'm going to call him what brother
[53:59] random called him he said the serpent
[54:01] became Eve's interpreter
[54:08] another interpreter to the church
[54:11] other than God's word
[54:14] oh that's not what brother Branham meant
[54:16] no no he didn't say it uh brother
[54:18] Branham prophesied this show me where it
[54:20] happened
[54:21] brother random said this if he's a man
[54:24] of God well I'll tell you what I'm just
[54:26] going to make a statement here this
[54:27] morning you can hate me if you want if
[54:29] you leave William Branham you leave
[54:30] Moses you leave Jesus you leave every
[54:33] one of these other prophets because
[54:34] every one of them had same flaws except
[54:36] Jesus and Jesus spoke in Parable so that
[54:39] the Believers couldn't even understand
[54:40] themselves until he told them plainly
[54:42] And when everybody that started leaving
[54:45] him because of what he preached he
[54:47] turned around to the 12 and said you're
[54:48] going to leave too
[54:50] I'm on Church you would have left them
[54:53] there you leave them here you leave them
[54:55] there but I'm telling you I want to stay
[55:00] you're safe oh brother banham brother
[55:02] Danny excuse me I'm not brother random
[55:03] brother Danny you shouldn't say that the
[55:05] devil will hear you well he already
[55:07] knows it
[55:15] Eve did not know what she was doing
[55:22] Adam knew exactly
[55:25] what he was doing
[55:27] when he listened to what Eve had to tell
[55:31] him
[55:32] he knew what he was about to do was
[55:34] wrong
[55:37] it was while he was still god of the
[55:40] Earth
[55:41] that he made that decision
[55:46] to step out with his wife
[55:50] he did not make that decision as a
[55:52] fallen man he became a fallen man after
[55:55] he made that decision when his wife came
[55:58] to him and said what she had done Adam
[56:00] knew it was adultery and he knew that
[56:04] this woman would have to be burnt
[56:09] but he loved her
[56:13] the trail of the serpent had the serpent
[56:15] had weaved its way right into Adam's own
[56:17] home
[56:19] there's only one way to save his wife
[56:26] and that was while he's God of the Earth
[56:29] to know what he's doing step out and
[56:32] partake of her Fallen condition
[56:35] Prophet said he took her quickly he
[56:38] intervened Adam intervened
[56:42] and took her quickly to himself
[56:47] knowing what he was doing would result
[56:49] in a falling condition but he loved her
[56:52] and he wasn't willing
[56:53] to lose her
[56:57] he's not willing
[57:00] to lose you
[57:02] your Fallen condition
[57:04] is not what stops him
[57:11] it's a lie from the trail of the serpent
[57:14] that tells you there's no hope and that
[57:16] you cannot be forgiven and that you're
[57:18] worthless and that you're no good it's a
[57:21] lie from the trail of the serpent that
[57:22] tells you that this message is not true
[57:24] because he knows that it's the love of
[57:27] God that has intervened in your life if
[57:31] the love of God had not intervened in my
[57:33] family I would be sitting down there in
[57:35] a lie to Ohio and Sharon Mennonite
[57:37] church with my arms folded gone amen but
[57:40] because the love of God intervened Amen
[57:43] I am now known as a son of God
[57:46] [Applause]
[57:48] I'm not a Mennonite I'm not an
[57:50] organizational man I come from the mind
[57:53] of God and what was in his mind is now
[57:56] in my body
[57:57] foreign
[58:01] he wants it to be flesh in yours
[58:05] Adam intervened
[58:09] can you imagine
[58:10] and I said I'm closing it's just taking
[58:13] a while
[58:15] to get down
[58:17] can you imagine
[58:19] they've made their own fig leaves now
[58:21] presenting themselves they didn't need
[58:24] that covering before but now they need a
[58:26] covering and they make up their own
[58:28] covering to meet God
[58:30] and they're trying to meet him
[58:32] they've covered up the place of
[58:34] multiplication and replenishing
[58:37] with their own fig leaves
[58:42] not put them over their mouth they made
[58:43] aprons
[58:51] and they meet God
[58:53] Adam what have you done this is not the
[58:55] same atom that stepped out for his wife
[58:57] and took her to himself
[58:58] now he blames her
[59:02] the woman you gave me
[59:04] it's not only her fault it's your fault
[59:07] how many people in here ah God you don't
[59:09] love me come on I want to say something
[59:13] about God and you
[59:14] if it wasn't for God you wouldn't even
[59:16] be here to have the nerve to say it
[59:18] God is your creator he's your owner he
[59:20] owns you he birth you he gave you life
[59:23] he gave you will he gave you a tongue
[59:25] that you use against God
[59:28] but it's God that gave that to you
[59:31] you're not God well if God really loves
[59:34] me why did my baby die God really loves
[59:35] me why did I go through this if God
[59:37] really loves me
[59:42] come on Church
[59:43] speaking with brother Brandon there amen
[59:46] back there and listen to brother random
[59:48] say this he said I was coming down off a
[59:50] hill he said I guess he'd been hunting
[59:51] or something I'm coming off a hill and
[59:52] I'm thinking about all I had went
[59:54] through in my early life and he said I
[59:56] lost my wife I lost my my baby and I I
[59:59] at my you know and at that time his
[1:00:01] church was dwindling he lost his father
[1:00:02] shortly before that and other people in
[1:00:04] the family a brother and so so he lost a
[1:00:06] lot he was scarred amen and he's
[1:00:09] thinking himself he said I don't think I
[1:00:10] could ever go through that again I don't
[1:00:12] want to ever go through that again and
[1:00:14] he said and something spoke to my heart
[1:00:15] and said well what of all the thousands
[1:00:17] that have come to the Lord because of
[1:00:19] the testimonies about your baby
[1:00:22] and he said and I stopped and I said
[1:00:25] then Lord I'd do it all over again
[1:00:29] that's a surrendered life not a
[1:00:31] resentful life we strut around like we
[1:00:33] got that kind of power to tell God what
[1:00:35] to do God is sovereign
[1:00:37] nobody can tell him what to do and
[1:00:39] nobody can tell him who to save
[1:00:42] and nobody can tell him though this
[1:00:44] one's no good it's God that intervened
[1:00:47] not you it was God that shed his blood
[1:00:49] not you
[1:00:51] it was God's amen Jesus that gave his
[1:00:54] life we strut around and act like we got
[1:00:56] power over him
[1:01:02] and he lined him up
[1:01:04] Adam Eve and the serpent
[1:01:09] the man of the home he said this is the
[1:01:10] principle in counseling
[1:01:12] you speak to the man of the home first
[1:01:14] because it's his
[1:01:16] his jurisdiction
[1:01:19] you're responsible for everything under
[1:01:21] that roof
[1:01:24] he didn't ask the woman first he asked
[1:01:26] the man
[1:01:28] I just got to stop and say I said I'm
[1:01:30] closing but it's a long Runway we got a
[1:01:32] jam up there at the thing so amen
[1:01:36] foreign
[1:01:38] I had a couple in the office one time
[1:01:40] married many years had four Sons
[1:01:43] and they couldn't get along with one
[1:01:45] another they had come to a point in
[1:01:47] their relationship they couldn't even
[1:01:48] look at one another
[1:01:50] and they sat in my office
[1:01:53] with their backs to one another at an
[1:01:55] angle they set at an angle and looked at
[1:01:57] me but they wouldn't look at one another
[1:01:58] they sat like they had their positions
[1:02:00] like this and he was positioned that way
[1:02:02] they're looking at me
[1:02:04] and I'm thinking this is really weird
[1:02:06] foreign
[1:02:08] you wondered what pastors are thinking
[1:02:09] in the office that's what it is
[1:02:14] we're not sitting there with Halos and
[1:02:23] and they begin to run each other down
[1:02:25] run each other down there was nothing
[1:02:28] good being said about each other nothing
[1:02:31] the man she's this she's that Jesus this
[1:02:34] isn't and he's doing this and he's doing
[1:02:35] this he's doing that and she's doing
[1:02:36] this he's doing this I got fed up with
[1:02:38] it you wanna know pastors get fed up
[1:02:41] I got fed up with it
[1:02:43] I said do you think we're actually going
[1:02:45] to accomplish anything here by telling
[1:02:48] each other's faults
[1:02:49] I said number one you can't even look at
[1:02:52] one another
[1:02:53] I said turn around
[1:02:56] and take each other's hands and look
[1:02:58] each other in the eyes I wish we had
[1:03:01] some kind of Orchestra or something
[1:03:02] playing because it took a while
[1:03:07] turned around
[1:03:10] they took each other's hands now it's
[1:03:12] hard to take each other's hands look
[1:03:14] each other in the eye
[1:03:16] and say how miserable they are
[1:03:21] so I said now you've been telling me
[1:03:22] nothing bad about that person
[1:03:24] because you're the man of the house I
[1:03:27] want you now to start telling me every
[1:03:28] good thing you can about this woman to
[1:03:30] me tell me every good thing now this is
[1:03:33] going to be funny
[1:03:35] and it was funny
[1:03:39] God moves in mysterious ways his wonders
[1:03:42] to perform and you're going to find out
[1:03:44] he looked at her and he looked at me and
[1:03:47] he looked at her and he looked at me and
[1:03:48] he looked at her and it's like it was
[1:03:49] like it was going to take a while
[1:03:52] because you're coming from Mountain
[1:03:54] resentment going down through the valley
[1:03:55] of I can't think right now now you got
[1:03:57] to go up to the other Mountain of Love
[1:04:00] and it's hard to get there sometimes
[1:04:02] it's a toll road and then the bridge is
[1:04:04] out and
[1:04:08] he finally got there and this is what he
[1:04:10] came up with
[1:04:11] she makes good cookies
[1:04:18] thank God for chocolate chip cookies
[1:04:25] now you don't think God can't move in
[1:04:27] that when they started talking like that
[1:04:29] God dropped right down between them if
[1:04:33] it takes talking about cookies let's
[1:04:34] talk about cookies
[1:04:37] I'll let you know my God will move
[1:04:40] in your home
[1:04:44] here's Adam I'm getting there
[1:04:46] the Jam's leaving at the gate and here's
[1:04:49] Adam he's standing there God looks at
[1:04:51] him and says what have you done he said
[1:04:52] you know the woman you gave me
[1:04:58] she gave me this and I ate it
[1:05:00] he's a fallen son he forgot why he
[1:05:03] intervened
[1:05:10] so God he just does the order he turns
[1:05:12] to the woman
[1:05:13] why did you do this the woman is usually
[1:05:16] the truthful one of the bunch
[1:05:19] she opens up her mouth
[1:05:21] well you know what it was it was a
[1:05:23] serpent he beguiled me and I ate it and
[1:05:24] it was good and I took it back to Adam
[1:05:26] and he ate it too Hallelujah
[1:05:32] yep
[1:05:34] and
[1:05:37] God turned to the serpent it was more
[1:05:39] subtle
[1:05:40] than any beast of the field he could
[1:05:41] talk
[1:05:43] now he's anointed of the devil
[1:05:45] I can guarantee you if he's got that
[1:05:47] much time in a counseling session he's
[1:05:49] working up his reason
[1:05:52] I'm getting ready to tell why I did what
[1:05:55] I did the devil made me do it
[1:05:59] but when God turned to that instrument
