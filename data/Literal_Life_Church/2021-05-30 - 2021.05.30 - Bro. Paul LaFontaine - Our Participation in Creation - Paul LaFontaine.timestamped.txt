[0:00] from matthew chapter 16 and just a
[0:03] portion of scripture that we
[0:04] is very familiar to many of us that
[0:07] have a revelation and the way that god
[0:10] described
[0:12] how he would set up his kingdom and
[0:13] that's by revelations not human
[0:15] intellect but it's by revelation that
[0:17] comes directly from the father
[0:19] and so we're appreciative of that it's
[0:21] nice to have jason and adam with us here
[0:24] this morning visiting again they were
[0:25] with us wednesday night
[0:26] god bless you for being with us and and
[0:28] we appreciate all the visitors
[0:30] i hope i don't miss anybody but god
[0:31] bless you this weekend i didn't expect
[0:33] quite as big a crowd just
[0:34] memorial day weekend so many going on
[0:36] vacations and different things but
[0:38] it's a joy to be with you in the house
[0:39] of god this morning i trust that god
[0:41] will help me in my
[0:42] my feeble way to say something if i if i
[0:46] don't have it for you
[0:47] there's a god that's here that knows
[0:48] your needs and if you
[0:50] you'll you'll just give yourself this
[0:52] morning god knows you better than you
[0:54] know yourself
[0:55] amen matthew chapter 16 and verse 13
[0:58] when jesus came into the coast of
[1:00] caesarea philippi
[1:02] he asked his disciples saying whom do
[1:04] men say that i
[1:05] the son of man am and they said some say
[1:08] that thou are john the baptist
[1:10] some elias and others jeremiah's or one
[1:13] of the prophets
[1:14] he saith unto them but whom say ye that
[1:17] i
[1:18] am and simon peter god always asks
[1:21] personally what what
[1:22] you're saying that i am and here jesus
[1:24] asked his disciples
[1:26] whom say ye that i am and simon peter
[1:29] answered and said
[1:30] thou art the christ the son of the
[1:32] living god
[1:33] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:35] blessed art thou
[1:36] simon barjona for flesh and blood hath
[1:39] not revealed it unto you
[1:41] but my father which is in heaven
[1:43] revealed it unto you
[1:45] and i say unto thee that thou art peter
[1:47] and upon this rock i will build my
[1:49] church
[1:50] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:53] against it just so we understand
[1:56] that the rebel the church is not built
[1:58] upon peter
[1:59] that's what the catholic church says
[2:00] it's built on peter as the
[2:02] they call him the first pope that's not
[2:04] what jesus is saying here
[2:06] the the the rock is built upon he says
[2:09] this rock i will build my church and it
[2:11] was upon the revelation
[2:13] that god gave peter of who he was that
[2:16] is the foundations for the church a
[2:18] revelation
[2:19] and the and when you have that
[2:21] revelation the gates of hell
[2:23] cannot prevail against him amen that's
[2:26] pretty powerful
[2:28] and i will give this is go further now i
[2:30] will give unto thee the keys of the
[2:33] kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou
[2:35] shalt bind on earth
[2:37] shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever
[2:39] thou shalt loose on earth shall be
[2:41] loosed in heaven
[2:43] then charged he his disciples that they
[2:45] should tell no man that he was
[2:48] jesus the christ let's pray together
[2:50] heavenly father
[2:51] we gather today lord asking for your
[2:53] help and strength and
[2:55] your revelation the lord as we uh we
[2:58] just come
[2:58] father we know that what you have given
[3:00] us in the past is
[3:01] secure but lord we look to you again in
[3:04] our hunger we look to you to speak to us
[3:07] we look to you lord in this quiet place
[3:09] that we have just reserved
[3:11] this sanctuary this house of god we look
[3:14] for you to meet us here
[3:16] and to speak to us lord to our
[3:18] individual needs
[3:19] and lord jesus i pray every heart
[3:21] whether or listening online or here in
[3:23] this building
[3:24] would be open lord that you they would
[3:26] remove every wall
[3:27] every hindrance every hesitance and i
[3:30] just pray they would give an open heart
[3:32] not to me today as such but who it is
[3:35] that can speak through me
[3:37] i pray that you'll bless every life you
[3:39] know where they're at you know where
[3:40] they stand
[3:41] and i pray father that you'll just bless
[3:44] us in the service lord in a special way
[3:46] that we can learn of you today in jesus
[3:49] name we ask it
[3:50] amen amen once you shake somebody's hand
[3:53] now that we're allowed to do that
[3:55] say god bless you this morning
[3:58] amen i think that's the first time i've
[4:00] asked for that in
[4:02] over a year
[4:07] amen god bless you all
[4:14] i'm going to bring us back into uh the
[4:17] thoughts and
[4:17] the channel uh a little bit that brother
[4:20] andrew
[4:22] was bringing us into last sunday if you
[4:24] weren't here you can catch it on the
[4:25] archive but it was a wonderful service
[4:28] and i'm going to bring us a little bit
[4:30] back into that
[4:32] and brother andrew last sunday i'd never
[4:34] seen a sermon in my life dedicated
[4:37] to that one thought the prophet
[4:40] proclaimed that we
[4:41] operate the gift of god if god sends a
[4:44] gift
[4:45] it's one thing but we are the ones that
[4:47] operate that gift
[4:49] and i've heard that said before i know
[4:51] the prophet said that
[4:52] but i've never heard an entire sermon
[4:54] dedicated in the way that he did it was
[4:56] a wonderful service if you didn't get it
[4:58] it would benefit you to listen to it but
[5:01] i want to bring us back in that channel
[5:02] again to talk about that a little bit to
[5:04] realize
[5:05] the significance and just maybe look at
[5:07] it in a deeper reality uh
[5:10] that tells us that when we no matter how
[5:13] powerful gifts god sends us that
[5:16] it depends on what we how we react to it
[5:18] and how we exercise our faith to that
[5:20] gift
[5:21] to operate it that we get the benefit
[5:23] from it
[5:24] and we are you know i love how brother
[5:27] andrew said it that we're not
[5:28] poverty-stricken in our pulpit in our
[5:30] lives in the last days
[5:32] god has blessed us incredibly with the
[5:35] word being open like it has we're not
[5:38] we're not um searching we're not uh
[5:41] we're not hurting at all
[5:42] we're not in poverty at all and how many
[5:45] would say that god
[5:47] has sent you wonderful gifts in your
[5:49] life to be able to help you in the
[5:50] kingdom of god in your christian journey
[5:53] if it hadn't been for the gifts that he
[5:54] sent
[5:55] starting with jesus christ and then all
[5:57] the other gifts of the fivefold ministry
[6:00] gifts within the body different ones
[6:02] it's god that sends these gifts
[6:04] and how many can raise your hand in your
[6:05] christian journey i wouldn't be where
[6:07] i'm at today
[6:08] unless god had blessed me with gifts in
[6:10] my life
[6:12] and so that's an important thing can you
[6:13] say amen and it and we realize
[6:15] that these gifts when they come to us
[6:17] they can be among
[6:18] us but if we if we look at them too
[6:21] carnally we will miss the benefit
[6:23] sometimes
[6:23] because we don't see it as god sending
[6:25] that gift and we can have the most
[6:28] powerful gifts that god can sin
[6:30] and yet we have to exercise our faith
[6:34] and look and watch our response to that
[6:36] gift
[6:37] we pull out of that gift the power of
[6:40] how much it can affect us
[6:43] so it brings the responsibility back on
[6:46] us
[6:46] that the the the greatest gift and
[6:49] that's proven right back to jesus christ
[6:51] that the greatest gift god ever sent to
[6:54] man
[6:55] was right there amongst the church and
[6:57] in the jerusalem and in bethlehem
[6:59] god sent the greatest gift he'd ever
[7:01] given and most of the world missed it
[7:03] and when they seen it most of the world
[7:05] rejected that gift
[7:07] the greatest gift god could send and
[7:09] they rejected it
[7:11] they should have been latching on to
[7:12] that they should have been saying thank
[7:14] god he said something to us
[7:15] they should have been saying this is my
[7:16] gift god sent me what can i do and
[7:19] giving their faith to it to believe it
[7:20] but most people didn't
[7:22] and so we are the ones if we can bring
[7:24] this closer now we pull out the power in
[7:27] a gift
[7:28] by our attitude towards a gift by our
[7:31] response towards a gift
[7:32] and i'm not talking about the person
[7:35] because that's where we get hung up is
[7:37] the person sometimes
[7:38] it's always been the the skin test in
[7:41] every age
[7:42] people stumble at the skin that god is
[7:45] hiding in
[7:46] god hides himself behind skin in the old
[7:49] testament god hid
[7:50] himself in the tabernacle behind animal
[7:53] skins
[7:54] badger skins that's a type can you say
[7:57] man
[7:58] that god she kind of glory rested in
[8:00] that place
[8:01] covered and hidden by badger skins
[8:04] animal skins
[8:05] god hides himself in badger skins today
[8:08] we without god we're animals can you say
[8:11] man i said without god you're just an
[8:13] animal
[8:15] you don't hear too many preachers saying
[8:16] that but without god
[8:18] we're just animal skins and we're
[8:20] animals but when the glory of god comes
[8:22] down
[8:22] it's god hiding behind animal skins
[8:26] but we stumble at the skin it's always
[8:28] been a preacher said one time
[8:30] it's always been the skin test with the
[8:32] prophets he sends
[8:33] with jesus and with you and i and with
[8:36] preachers
[8:36] it's always been the skin test people
[8:39] stumble at the skin that god is hiding
[8:41] in
[8:42] but if they could get past the skin test
[8:46] they could see god is speaking to me
[8:51] god is visiting me god
[8:54] is making himself personal to me
[8:58] so then we have this truth that brother
[9:00] andrew brought that
[9:01] that is so wonderful that we uh
[9:04] how much priority we give in we we
[9:07] operate
[9:08] this and i like to use the term unlock
[9:11] what's in the gift instead of operate we
[9:14] unlock it and i'm taking it from my text
[9:17] when jesus said to peter and the
[9:19] disciples with this revelation it's what
[9:21] i'll build my
[9:22] kingdom on and he says if you have that
[9:24] revelation
[9:25] the gates of hell shall not prevail
[9:27] against it and i will give you the keys
[9:30] now when you have the keys
[9:32] that means you're going to unlock
[9:34] something
[9:37] keys mean you have access to unlock
[9:40] something and he not only gave the keys
[9:43] of the kingdom to peter
[9:45] but he gave them to all believers who
[9:47] have the holy ghost
[9:48] he gives you something to unlock so just
[9:51] like we
[9:52] operate the gift and we pull the christ
[9:54] out of a minister
[9:55] we pull the christ out of someone we
[9:57] unlock christ and release christ
[9:59] and bring it to us and the benefit of
[10:01] everyone else we we
[10:03] we not only operate it but we unlock it
[10:05] he says it and let me just word it i
[10:07] will give you the keys of the kingdom
[10:09] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[10:12] shall be bound in heaven
[10:13] and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[10:15] shall be loosed in heaven oh i wish i
[10:18] could preach that as powerful as i want
[10:20] to preach it
[10:20] that is the par and that's a revelation
[10:23] from god that you hold in your heart
[10:25] look at the power that goes with it why
[10:27] would
[10:28] we be afraid of the devil why would we
[10:31] be afraid of his demons
[10:33] why would we be afraid of of anything
[10:36] the devil has for us
[10:37] when we hold a revelation the gates of
[10:39] hell cannot prevail against it
[10:44] so how many times in history if we if we
[10:47] had god send something
[10:49] and hardly anyone recognized it or gave
[10:51] themselves completely to it
[10:54] respecting it fully and pulling from it
[10:56] everything they could pull from it
[10:58] you know we are so cynical today
[11:02] there's such a lack of trust today
[11:05] can i get an amen the the devil is
[11:09] trying to talk us
[11:10] when god sends a gift the devil's trying
[11:12] to talk
[11:13] everybody out of it the devil's trying
[11:16] to put it down the devil's trying to
[11:17] create a scenario again i shouldn't say
[11:20] create but to bring a scenario against
[11:22] it to cause people to doubt
[11:24] cause peter lacquer even towards a
[11:25] pastor or any other gift
[11:27] the devil's worked overtime to try to
[11:29] talk us
[11:30] out of things even talk us out of the
[11:32] fulfillment of malachi 4 5 and 6.
[11:34] look at the devil trying to talk people
[11:36] out of it
[11:37] trying to take away the validity of it
[11:39] we're some 60 years past that visitation
[11:42] now
[11:42] of malachi 4 being fulfilled and the
[11:44] devil doesn't care
[11:46] he's still trying to talk people out of
[11:48] trusting that this
[11:49] is the gift god sent us here 60 years
[11:51] ago and he's finished his work but
[11:53] the devil tries to talk us out of and
[11:55] cause us to have a lack of trust
[11:57] and even though the devil talks to
[11:59] people and makes them cynical
[12:01] and skeptical and lack of trust i want
[12:03] to proclaim today
[12:05] no matter what the devil did or what
[12:07] he's done god
[12:08] went ahead and did what he said he would
[12:10] do and he has done it
[12:12] he has said elijah and there's nothing
[12:14] you can do to stop it
[12:16] how many believe that with me this
[12:17] morning see the devil puts a little
[12:19] doubt and oh yeah
[12:20] well this that and the other putting
[12:22] dates together he had his dates wrong
[12:23] and all the other things
[12:24] that's the devil's work he either said
[12:26] elijah he didn't ascend elijah and if he
[12:29] sent elijah he brought the word to bring
[12:30] us back to this
[12:31] bible can you say man i was sharing that
[12:34] with the brother the other night the
[12:35] the young brother that was here and i
[12:37] was just saying we're so blessed in the
[12:39] last days because god
[12:41] is restoring back to his truths that got
[12:43] lost and he did that through malachi 4
[12:46] 5. god went ahead and did it
[12:51] but the devil's trying to talk us out of
[12:53] these gifts that god sends
[12:55] and when he does that i mean he's doing
[12:57] the greatest damage he can do because
[12:58] when people lose trust
[13:00] i don't know about that i don't know
[13:01] about this i don't know about these
[13:03] i don't fight for a mission i don't even
[13:05] know about brother paul
[13:09] devil works overtime and he works right
[13:12] mainly in that vein you know the devil's
[13:14] not trying to get you to smoke or drink
[13:15] or wear a miniskirt
[13:18] that might be part of it but he's trying
[13:20] to get you to lose
[13:21] trust in the gifts that god sends
[13:25] i'm telling you friends the bible says
[13:26] in john 1 he says
[13:28] there was a man sent from god and his
[13:30] name was john he named him
[13:32] and so if god can do that in the bible
[13:34] he can do it again there's a man
[13:35] sent from god whose name was
[13:39] but the devil's work is to cause us to
[13:41] lose trust in that
[13:42] in the gifts that he sinned and the
[13:44] greatest gifts that he can send
[13:46] if people begin to not operate it and
[13:48] utilize it and have a right attitude
[13:50] towards it
[13:51] and say you know what i believe this
[13:52] thing i believe it can help me
[13:54] i believe god can i may not be perfect i
[13:57] mean
[13:57] i have a lot of problems and a lot of
[13:59] questions but if i can trust what god
[14:01] sins at least trust that and say god
[14:03] i trust it i know that you
[14:06] said it and faith begins to move we
[14:09] operate
[14:10] the gift to be a benefit to us and that
[14:12] wasn't just happening back 60 years ago
[14:14] that's actually happening while i'm
[14:16] preaching this morning
[14:20] because you can look at this big bigger
[14:22] bigger preacher
[14:25] it's just quiet i'm allowed to say
[14:27] you're not allowed to say amen to that
[14:33] especially after yesterday and all that
[14:35] good food that my wife cooked
[14:37] ooh that was good costs a lot of money
[14:41] too
[14:43] you know i don't understand one thing is
[14:46] how
[14:46] we spend all this money for this big
[14:48] open house and all this food
[14:50] and all this entertainment all this
[14:53] thing
[14:53] and free rides on the john deere for the
[14:56] kids
[14:58] we pay all this money for a food and
[15:01] that girl
[15:02] opens the cards and she gets to
[15:04] gallivant and take off with all the
[15:05] money
[15:09] i was trying to figure that out this
[15:10] morning how does that work i don't know
[15:13] you're gonna hightail it out of town
[15:14] tomorrow to arizona go to the camp
[15:16] he's probably taking every bit of that
[15:18] money with her and we're stuck with the
[15:19] bill i don't
[15:23] how does that fit into what i'm
[15:24] preaching here i don't have a clue where
[15:26] i'm at
[15:31] do you think do you think god as brother
[15:34] andy was saying
[15:35] is we're not poverty-stricken do you
[15:37] have god has a you think god has any
[15:39] less of supply right now in your life
[15:43] do you think god is lacking in the gifts
[15:45] and let me say this is that people have
[15:47] so much confidence in elijah and
[15:49] brother bran i'm fulfilling that and if
[15:51] you don't understand that this morning
[15:53] be glad to spend whatever time show you
[15:55] scripturally that god was supposed to
[15:56] send
[15:57] malachi 4 elijah in the last days to and
[16:00] so that work is finished now
[16:01] but a lot of people said they trust that
[16:03] gift but they don't trust the gifts that
[16:05] are speaking now
[16:06] our god's not that little and they
[16:10] somehow lift that gift up way up into
[16:12] you i can trust that i can trust that
[16:14] but now listen you are limiting god god
[16:17] is big enough in this service can you
[16:19] say amen
[16:20] and god has sent you gifts in your life
[16:22] right now that if you'll believe and
[16:24] operate those gifts
[16:25] you can move on with the lord
[16:30] amen so there are resources in the body
[16:33] of christ now can you say amen
[16:35] the spoken word coming into his people
[16:37] is an abundant supply
[16:39] it's an inexhaustible fountain the
[16:41] prophet called it
[16:42] we have today an inexhaustible fountain
[16:46] to drink from
[16:47] if it can't run out can you say man it
[16:49] is rich i'm
[16:50] rich in faith and hope and love and the
[16:53] word of god i'm not poverty-stricken
[16:55] this morning
[16:56] i have access to the riches of heaven
[16:59] but
[16:59] people if you don't tap into it you can
[17:01] have resources all
[17:03] all around you gifts all around you but
[17:06] you have to have the right attitude
[17:07] towards it
[17:08] you have to operate it in order for it
[17:11] to help your life
[17:13] you have to join in you have to give can
[17:15] you say that
[17:16] and our brother's using saving last week
[17:18] as an evangelist
[17:19] you have to amen there's something about
[17:20] an amen that says sick them to a
[17:23] preacher
[17:23] there's something about amen that
[17:25] operates the gift and allows us to
[17:27] preach more freely
[17:29] i still ain't saying amen i still had
[17:31] and i don't feel like it
[17:32] uh you know i had a rough day yesterday
[17:34] you didn't have as rough day as i had
[17:36] yesterday
[17:37] in the last three weeks
[17:41] yeah uh we feel pretty rough
[17:45] i'm already given out here this morning
[17:49] everybody say praise the lord i get to
[17:50] get a drink
[17:54] i don't feel like coming i don't
[17:58] i'm really tired from yesterday so i'm
[18:00] not going to show up to church today
[18:02] listen i'm not so sure you wouldn't be a
[18:04] little backslid because i don't care how
[18:06] tired a believer is
[18:08] there is priorities that i'm going to
[18:10] come and hear the word of god
[18:13] uh drink coffee get yourself awake
[18:16] splash cold water on your face
[18:19] have some red bulls
[18:22] brother lucas i want to hear the word of
[18:26] god
[18:27] i may not make any other events this
[18:28] week but there's i'm not going to
[18:31] miss this event right here because the
[18:33] lord has his gifts in the body
[18:35] and i want to be around those gifts and
[18:38] i want to tap into those gifts
[18:41] praise the lord he's an inexhaustible
[18:43] fountain
[18:44] and you know that that young boy
[18:46] wednesday night
[18:48] at the service he tapped into something
[18:52] he broke in conviction and repentance
[18:55] we prayed with him we talked to him
[18:57] after i tell you friends
[18:59] you need to look at church the right way
[19:01] that's the reason why we're here
[19:03] can you say man i don't know how you
[19:06] look at the politics or you look at the
[19:07] thing and
[19:08] did everybody make decisions just right
[19:10] what happened wednesday night
[19:11] with the broken heart of that young man
[19:14] that's why we're here
[19:15] [Applause]
[19:16] his hungry heart tapped into something
[19:18] and a gift brother brandon speaking
[19:20] holy spirit came in that place and i
[19:22] want to compliment the congregation
[19:24] too that wasn't in a rush to leave
[19:25] because we got some spirit-filled people
[19:27] here that can sense when god is moving
[19:29] and they stayed and they stayed and they
[19:31] kept praying and kept worshiping
[19:33] thank you all for not being in a rush in
[19:35] your life because that's what's
[19:37] important
[19:38] that's what we're here on this earth for
[19:41] is the holy spirit and his gifts that he
[19:43] sends
[19:43] and we tap into them to see
[19:47] lives changed to see his hearts broken
[19:49] in contraction
[19:53] that's why we're here it's not the
[19:55] church buildings and administrations and
[19:57] who has the next position
[19:58] i care nothing about that that the holy
[20:01] spirit comes in revelation
[20:03] and convicts hearts changes lives
[20:06] that's why that's what the message is
[20:08] for that's why we gather can you say
[20:10] amen
[20:12] we should pray for our children to have
[20:13] an experience with almighty god
[20:16] you can give your children everything
[20:18] else in life and not
[20:20] pray for them to receive the holy ghost
[20:22] that's the most important thing
[20:26] but a gift working is what would and us
[20:28] activating that gift
[20:30] and and and there was a gift working
[20:32] there wednesday night
[20:33] and that's why you can take it or you
[20:35] can leave it based upon this based upon
[20:37] your feelings sometimes
[20:39] you can push it off but it's it's it's
[20:41] it's you know it
[20:42] we must realize that when god's gifts
[20:46] are speaking
[20:47] then we we should respond
[20:51] activate them praise the lord
[20:54] begs the question what potentials
[20:58] are still untapped
[21:02] and and you know i could speak about
[21:05] something past and speak a lot about
[21:08] brother branham's life
[21:09] but we're not there anymore
[21:14] we're here and we draw faith and things
[21:17] from those stories but
[21:18] i won't spend a lot of time on that
[21:20] because we're he's fulfilled his
[21:22] ministry can you say amen and no so i
[21:25] asked the question
[21:26] when you speak about operating the gifts
[21:28] that god sends you
[21:29] or is it how much potentials are still
[21:33] laying in the body and in the gifts of
[21:35] god untapped
[21:39] this morning how much potential how much
[21:42] of christ
[21:42] in you is still untapped how much is
[21:46] still in me that's untapped
[21:48] when he preached last sunday that's the
[21:50] question i was asking
[21:51] by our hesitance or by our cynicalness
[21:55] or or by our approach to christ that's
[21:58] hesitant
[21:59] how how much is still untapped of the
[22:02] glory of god
[22:03] through the gifts of god and we don't
[22:05] tap into it
[22:06] because we're hesitant
[22:11] i i think of the woman at the well and
[22:14] uh
[22:14] so many times the prophet telling the
[22:16] story and i believe it's because
[22:18] she was the type of the bride of christ
[22:20] today
[22:21] she was a harlot she was a harlot and
[22:25] and he said well that's a type of the
[22:26] bride of christ yes because
[22:28] spiritually we're all harlots
[22:31] boy you won't every preacher say that
[22:33] we're hard because we got all this mixed
[22:36] ideas and religions and all this thing
[22:38] and if it's not religion you came from
[22:40] it's dabbling in the things of the world
[22:42] so your spirit is a harlot spirit it's
[22:44] it's dirtied by the world you just give
[22:47] your soul and your spirit to all kinds
[22:49] of dirtiness and
[22:50] filth on the internet and movies and all
[22:52] this stuff that's that's what you
[22:53] spiritually do to your system
[22:55] that's a harlot and so spiritually that
[22:57] one with the well represents this bride
[22:59] we all come as harlot spiritually and
[23:02] when she came to that well
[23:04] jesus was already there waiting for her
[23:06] and she
[23:07] she came up to him and he said can you
[23:09] give me a drink and i'd like to bring
[23:11] this out
[23:11] and show it he he asked something from
[23:14] her
[23:14] and jesus he's seen the response he
[23:17] asked something of her
[23:18] and asked a drink of her and she she's
[23:21] she
[23:22] defaults back to what the norm is
[23:25] and she's going back to everything she's
[23:27] heard it's not
[23:28] normal for me a samaritan and you and i
[23:31] to even be talking with one another
[23:33] we don't have the norm is is that we
[23:36] don't connect and we don't do things and
[23:38] you're asking me for a drink and i
[23:40] probably shouldn't do that
[23:41] that's how people are they're they're
[23:43] motivated by the past and by the norm
[23:46] but when jesus comes the gift comes he
[23:49] doesn't want you to operate but what
[23:51] you've heard him but the past is
[23:52] and by the norm he doesn't want you to
[23:54] operate that way
[23:56] because he had something in that woman
[23:58] that he had to tap into
[24:01] and if she would have held he had a gift
[24:04] for her
[24:04] she had something within her her and he
[24:07] had something within her
[24:08] and that needed to come if she'd held on
[24:10] to her past
[24:11] idea she'd have never got it
[24:15] because his response is when when she
[24:17] asked for a drink
[24:18] he asked for a drink he said
[24:21] here's the words i want you to get if
[24:24] you knew
[24:25] who it was that was speaking to you
[24:34] now let's not apply that to the woman
[24:35] with well it's quiet this morning
[24:39] if you knew who it was that's speaking
[24:42] right now you see that statement
[24:46] i could preach a whole sermon the
[24:48] sermons could be preached on because
[24:49] that's our world that's the cynicalness
[24:51] of this world
[24:53] his gifts are laying right there around
[24:55] them
[24:57] but jesus said if you knew who it was
[25:00] that was speaking
[25:03] do you know who's speaking to you do you
[25:05] know what god has blessed you with gifts
[25:07] in your lives
[25:08] and i'm not talking about just the
[25:09] pastor and all the wonderful gifts we
[25:12] have in ministry here at the church
[25:14] a lot of different ministries a lot of
[25:15] different gifts but even you as a
[25:17] believer
[25:17] you have something within you to give to
[25:19] the rest of the body
[25:20] and i'm not talking about stacking
[25:22] chairs
[25:24] you have a portion of christ within you
[25:26] and for some of you it's not tapped yet
[25:28] because you've got so much hesitance but
[25:30] you have something in you that i need
[25:34] you have something in you brother paul
[25:36] you need something i cannot get by
[25:38] without the body of christ
[25:40] i was going to talk to a man a few weeks
[25:41] ago i said you know he doesn't
[25:43] attend church at all and but he believes
[25:45] this message and i said you know
[25:47] i just wanted to say to him hey you know
[25:48] what you and i believe the same message
[25:50] probably being the rapture of being
[25:51] heaven together and given that given
[25:53] that because
[25:53] he's a brother he believes like i do i
[25:56] said i i felt
[25:58] the difference in you and me is i need
[26:01] i need the fivefold ministry
[26:05] i need it and i need the body of christ
[26:09] they are my family more than even my own
[26:13] personal family i need them just as much
[26:16] as my personal family
[26:17] my granddaughter she's here this morning
[26:20] i love her to death
[26:21] you should have seen her face on that
[26:22] tractor yesterday i love her that's
[26:24] family emotion i love her to death but
[26:26] listen
[26:27] i would i would never trade and ditch
[26:29] the body of christ
[26:30] because this is my royal family right
[26:32] here and i need you i need the gift
[26:35] that's in you
[26:36] when i'm around you you have something
[26:38] to contribute
[26:39] and when that comes out i get blessed by
[26:42] it
[26:43] see when you look at church it's all a
[26:45] nicolaitan thing that all the holiness
[26:46] is in the pulpit we got to get away from
[26:48] that
[26:49] this is a body ministry this isn't even
[26:51] about william branham completely anymore
[26:53] this is about a body ministry and you
[26:56] are a part of that body
[26:59] no matter what the devil has told you
[27:01] there's something in you
[27:02] that's untapped and i need the body of
[27:06] christ
[27:06] i need the fifo ministry i need my
[27:09] family
[27:10] with all of your corpse and different
[27:12] personalities that sometimes this kind
[27:14] of
[27:15] we clash and we clash sometimes not
[27:18] because of your personality because of
[27:19] my personality
[27:21] with all of that i still love you and i
[27:23] need you
[27:24] and i need to be around the body of
[27:26] christ i draw
[27:28] strength from the christ that's in you
[27:35] and jesus said if you only knew
[27:38] who it was that was speaking to you why
[27:41] was she clouded in that idea
[27:43] because she was reaching from all that
[27:46] she had heard
[27:48] this isn't appropriate we can't talk to
[27:50] one another
[27:51] i'm in a different category not just a
[27:53] harlot but she's a samaritan
[27:55] the jews looked down on the samaritans
[27:57] she took all of that norm and she's
[27:59] using that
[28:00] and if she'd held on to that she would
[28:02] have never
[28:03] seen who it was that was speaking to her
[28:05] she would have never
[28:06] been delivered are you thinking about
[28:10] what i'm saying
[28:11] she would have never went any further in
[28:13] her life pastor harlotry or
[28:14] any of that if she'd held that thought
[28:17] that you know i'm less than you
[28:19] and jews look down on us and we don't
[28:21] believe the same we don't worship in the
[28:23] same way
[28:24] you can't hold on to any of that
[28:27] you're prejudiced looking at the church
[28:30] that there's
[28:31] in crowds and circles in the church that
[28:33] i'm not a part of and all the other
[28:34] things
[28:35] yeah fleshly fleshy things can get in
[28:37] and people have
[28:38] clicks and stuff but if they start up
[28:41] too much i just preached against him
[28:43] because it's of the devil to have clicks
[28:45] so the devil have people think in the
[28:47] church that they're better than
[28:48] everybody else
[28:49] there's certain families or whatever
[28:51] that are better it's wrong
[28:53] it's the world it's satan trying to
[28:55] divide there isn't anybody here better
[28:58] than the next person
[28:59] we're all sinners saved by grace we're
[29:02] all born as i told the young boy there
[29:04] on
[29:04] wednesday night we're born with a
[29:06] serpent nature we're all under the same
[29:08] category
[29:09] born in sin we all need the cross we all
[29:13] need the blood
[29:14] we need the gift of jesus christ we need
[29:16] the gifts of the fifo ministry but we're
[29:18] not gonna get out of here
[29:20] you are in the same don't get lifted up
[29:23] and say i don't need the body i don't
[29:24] need to be around you
[29:26] don't do that you need it just as much
[29:28] as i need it
[29:29] the gifts that god sends in his body you
[29:33] need it so much so that he said the
[29:36] pastor
[29:37] if you give him respects he'll lead you
[29:39] through to the other side
[29:41] that's pretty powerful now when i think
[29:43] about that i'm not thinking about myself
[29:45] personnel and myself paula fontaine
[29:47] because i guarantee you i i don't even i
[29:49] don't know how to do it i wouldn't know
[29:50] how to
[29:51] i don't know how to get you to the other
[29:52] side but the gift in me if god speaks
[29:55] through it
[29:55] it'll get you in a rapture
[29:59] if you give it respects if you say this
[30:02] is the gift that god has put among us
[30:04] this gift god has put us and many other
[30:07] gifts god
[30:08] will work through his gifts as you tap
[30:10] into them and unlock them can you say
[30:12] man
[30:14] i want to let me say one more thing
[30:15] about the woman at the well
[30:17] and she says if you only knew who it was
[30:20] that's speaking to you
[30:21] you would ask him for a drink
[30:27] so now if you recognize somebody else is
[30:30] speaking to me other than
[30:32] just this flesh vessel in front of me
[30:36] now you got to ask and so that's
[30:38] everything that andrew preaches right in
[30:40] there because
[30:41] she's going to activate she's going to
[30:44] she's going to bring out she's going to
[30:47] unlock
[30:48] by her response and her attitude she's
[30:51] going to unlock
[30:53] he said if you if you ask me for a drink
[30:56] i'll give you waters of everlasting life
[31:00] i'll give you eternal life you have to
[31:04] ask
[31:07] you have to uh
[31:10] operate the gift the gift can be the
[31:13] greatest gift in the world but you have
[31:15] to operate it
[31:16] right you have to show an attitude
[31:17] that's correct towards it
[31:19] you have to keep your attitude right can
[31:21] you say amen
[31:22] a lot of people are still christians but
[31:24] their attitude has become just
[31:26] hard it's all right it's quiet here a
[31:32] lot of people are still christians but
[31:33] they've let their
[31:34] they've got what my dads used to call
[31:36] the disease hardening of the attitudes
[31:43] a hard heart you're christians
[31:46] but their attitude towards the gifts of
[31:48] god
[31:49] has changed and he says if you ask me
[31:54] for a drink if you knew who was speaking
[31:57] and if you asked me for a drink
[31:58] that's the problem we don't know who is
[32:00] speaking to us
[32:02] and if she did jesus said you would ask
[32:05] if she understand who was speaking jesus
[32:07] said you would ask me if you understand
[32:09] who it is speaking to you
[32:11] you would be asking everybody understand
[32:14] if you understood who it is speaking
[32:16] you'd be asking
[32:18] you'd be probing lord i need this in my
[32:20] life
[32:22] you would pull on eternal life and you
[32:24] would operate
[32:25] all the things that's laying there and
[32:27] you would get everything you can
[32:29] by asking by believing by entering in
[32:33] and then she unlocked what he had in him
[32:37] by just simply asking and she started to
[32:40] talk with him she started to open her
[32:42] heart then he discerned her heart
[32:43] and she because she did if she'd have
[32:46] kept that mindset
[32:47] that we're not supposed to be talking to
[32:48] each other and i'm blocking you out
[32:52] she'd have never got deliverance because
[32:54] she but because she
[32:56] she started to ask and she kept talking
[32:58] in
[33:00] god settled all of her questions god set
[33:02] her free
[33:06] god gave her deliverance you know why
[33:09] she got deliverance because there was a
[33:10] gift in her
[33:12] there was a portion she was a seed of
[33:14] god all the outside she was a harlot
[33:17] everything everybody's seen but in this
[33:19] inside only god could discover
[33:21] and this is what i'd like to make the
[33:23] point too it didn't take
[33:25] 10 years
[33:28] in a seminary
[33:31] to get this woman delivered
[33:34] it didn't take a psychological seminar
[33:37] to get her out of her harlotry
[33:40] one moment in the presence of god and
[33:42] her identity was revealed
[33:44] she tapped into him and he tapped into
[33:48] that gift in her
[33:49] and she tapped into the gift in him and
[33:51] when that connected in one moment
[33:53] her harlotry and her lifestyle was
[33:56] finished with the things of the world
[33:58] finished now i know we grow in the lord
[34:00] and i know
[34:02] certain habits but on the inside she was
[34:05] changed on the inside come see a man
[34:08] that's told me all the things
[34:09] this is isn't this the very messiah just
[34:11] one moment in his presence friends
[34:14] but you see if we hold and hesitate and
[34:17] we don't
[34:17] operate the gifts when he's present
[34:19] among us if we don't pour ourselves
[34:21] in then we won't get the benefit of what
[34:24] god has for us in that gift
[34:26] and we can't tap into the potentials i
[34:29] believe in my congregation
[34:31] every one of you sitting here and those
[34:33] that are listening i believe
[34:34] there is untapped potentials in every
[34:37] one of you
[34:38] you're only going so far because of your
[34:40] past because of your hesitance
[34:42] and i'm gonna love you right through all
[34:44] of it because i've got that too
[34:46] but i'm here to tell you you have you
[34:48] haven't capped out yet
[34:49] you haven't tapped out yet you have so
[34:52] much more
[34:53] potential in you for christ
[34:56] i've told women that were baxted i said
[34:59] you know what i see something in you
[35:01] and if you would get rid of this and
[35:02] give this to the lord i see you as a
[35:04] pillar in the house of god
[35:06] filled with the holy ghost
[35:11] there's more potential in this room
[35:13] there's more potential in your life and
[35:15] some of you think well i'm old and i've
[35:17] had my days of shouting and i've had my
[35:19] days and
[35:19] yes i believe this and and you've heard
[35:22] all the quotes and you're sitting there
[35:23] this morning
[35:23] i know where he's going next and yeah i
[35:25] know that quote that's coming up now
[35:27] this is all become old to you i'm
[35:29] getting too old to respond and all
[35:31] my goodness do like my wife has to tell
[35:34] me
[35:34] quit acting like you're 80 years old
[35:37] you're only 55.
[35:40] your life is not over that's what she
[35:42] tells me your life is not
[35:44] i'm just like last night i'm just barely
[35:46] making it to my bed
[35:49] and i said han just go tell those kids
[35:53] to turn that fire off and quit
[35:55] go to bed
[36:01] and you know what she got all these
[36:04] things and she's just as tired as i am
[36:05] but she's got all these
[36:06] comments to me

[36:56] journey you've ever taken

[37:06] glories for you just down the road

[37:09] given you and tap into that which is
[37:12] within you

[37:15] not done yet
[37:16] oh the glory days of the camp meeting

[37:20] presence
[37:21] you can feel his presence this morning
[37:23] if you just healed yourself
[37:26] your spiritual life is not over yet
[37:29] the best is yet to come i feel tired
[37:32] this morning
[37:33] and i'm going to quit here in a minute
[37:35] but i'll tell you i'll just say to the
[37:36] devil
[37:37] my best years of ministry are yet to
[37:39] come
[37:41] my best songs that i've ever written are
[37:43] yet to come
[37:44] there's inspiration to tap into there's
[37:46] things laying within me
[37:48] that still got to come out and it's the
[37:51] same with you
[37:54] giving up just trying to give up say
[37:57] it's all over now and just
[37:59] you become some warmer you ought
[38:01] to defy the devil and get up and say i'm
[38:04] not no bench warmer i'm a participator
[38:10] hallelujah i'm a participator
[38:14] brother brahman says if you get that
[38:15] quote brother kyle whoever's up there
[38:17] today
[38:18] a greater witness than john he says but
[38:20] now you yourself you are christians
[38:23] and you pull that gift out see it isn't
[38:25] me
[38:26] it's your faith that does it if it don't
[38:28] have no faith there's nothing can be
[38:29] done
[38:30] it's your faith that operates the gift
[38:32] just like christ when he was here on
[38:34] earth
[38:34] this little gift to me this little you
[38:37] talking about his own gift
[38:38] this little gift to me is just like a
[38:39] little spoonful out of the ocean here
[38:41] and christ was like the whole
[38:43] ocean he's calling his gift just a
[38:45] spoonful
[38:46] christ was the whole ocean now i happen
[38:49] to believe his gift was a little bit
[38:50] more than a spoonful
[38:52] that's what he said his gift was and so
[38:55] he goes on to say
[38:56] is that he says it's not it's just not
[38:58] as much of it you see so it's
[39:01] that's the way a gift of god is now it's
[39:03] your faith that operates that gift
[39:05] the woman touched his garment jesus
[39:07] never said oh i
[39:08] no jesus said no i did something he said
[39:11] thy
[39:12] faith he looked at the woman says your
[39:14] faith has activated this gift
[39:16] thy faith has made you whole there's
[39:19] what brother andrew preached
[39:21] that's what brother andrew preached it's
[39:22] in this in it with the woman
[39:24] with the woman that touched him of his
[39:26] garment she's saying oh you healed me
[39:28] lord no
[39:28] thy faith has healed you you
[39:32] operated the gift
[39:37] and guess what she didn't have to have
[39:39] an interview with him
[39:40] she didn't have to to to have two hour
[39:42] session with him
[39:44] she she had sex faith she said i don't
[39:48] have to touch his body
[39:49] because people always they want to get
[39:50] close to got to touch something and
[39:52] sometimes that's needed
[39:53] but this woman said i can't get to him
[39:55] the crowd's pressing
[39:56] i can't hardly get to him i'm not going
[39:58] to have an interview with him that's not
[39:59] going to happen
[40:00] he doesn't have time for that but her
[40:02] faith risen that i don't even have to
[40:04] touch
[40:05] his body we would think we got to touch
[40:07] jesus body
[40:08] i don't have to touch his body if i just
[40:10] touch the bottom part of his clothes
[40:13] if i could just press through the crowd
[40:16] and just touch the bottom part of his
[40:19] clothes
[40:19] i don't even need to touch his body i
[40:21] don't need to talk to him
[40:26] she just touched it she's completely
[40:28] whole
[40:31] and then he says thy faith has healed
[40:34] you
[40:36] not i've healed you thy faith tapping
[40:39] into the gift
[40:40] you operated the gift what you need this
[40:44] morning from the lord
[40:46] will come to you as you operate the
[40:49] gifts
[40:50] that god has given to you
[40:54] i want to turn this around just for a
[40:56] minute here
[41:01] just like you operate my gift you stir
[41:04] it up when you say
[41:05] man you stir it up when you you stir me
[41:07] up when you text me
[41:09] and say go get them brother paul
[41:13] thank you so much stand for the word
[41:16] keep preaching
[41:18] sometimes even from ministers different
[41:20] places it's such an honor to get a text
[41:22] listen again god bless you thank you i
[41:25] don't give any glory to myself it's of
[41:27] the lord
[41:28] but i uh we all like to have a
[41:30] compliment don't we
[41:32] but it's but you operate the gift
[41:35] you stir me up when you say amen but
[41:38] when i preach
[41:40] did you know i'm stirring up something
[41:41] in you
[41:43] that is untapped in you and your flesh
[41:46] resistance sometimes your flesh is i can
[41:48] see it on your faces
[41:52] because this flesh is not born again
[41:55] but if you only knew who was speaking to
[41:57] you the gift
[41:59] is trying to tap into something that's
[42:02] in you
[42:03] in your soul deeper and if you can get
[42:06] past
[42:07] all the stuff boil out all the fluff and
[42:09] all that stuff
[42:10] you can see what's really happening here
[42:13] i'm actually
[42:14] operating something in you and stirring
[42:17] something in you
[42:18] didn't paul say to timothy stir up the
[42:19] gift that's in you
[42:22] i'm stirring something up in you so i
[42:23] want to turn this around
[42:25] one of the reasons god fills us with his
[42:27] power is to use us to affect those
[42:29] around us
[42:32] one of the reasons god fills us with his
[42:34] power is to affect others around he
[42:36] doesn't give us this power
[42:37] for ourselves he gives it to speak words
[42:40] of life
[42:41] to others his presence comes to affect
[42:44] us but the true evidence of being in his
[42:47] presence
[42:47] is us recognizing and using our
[42:49] influence to see
[42:51] others changed as well is this okay his
[42:54] presence
[42:55] changes us and causes us to help change
[42:58] others
[43:06] death and life is in the power of the
[43:08] tongue
[43:11] so i i'm i'm going to title this our
[43:13] participation in creation
[43:16] and i'm going to finish here in a minute
[43:17] because i don't have the strength to go
[43:18] on but
[43:20] but i'm going to finish it maybe next
[43:21] sunday our participation
[43:23] in creation when he says i'm giving you
[43:27] the keys to the kingdom
[43:28] to unlock to lock that's pretty powerful
[43:34] and most of what god gives us this for
[43:37] is to speak the words
[43:40] of life and creative power
[43:44] there was the word the logos and the
[43:47] thoughts of god
[43:48] coming into the logos in the beginning
[43:50] and he spoke it
[43:53] let there be
[43:56] there it was it was the logo speaking it
[43:58] that's how god works
[44:00] comes from the thought comes the word
[44:02] and then it's spoken
[44:03] and when it's spoken it has creative
[44:05] power in it it begins to create what was
[44:07] spoken
[44:08] so he's standing there at the beginning
[44:10] but did you know in the new testament
[44:12] did you know that we have a
[44:14] participation
[44:15] in creation
[44:19] when the early church came brother
[44:21] abraham says the seed comes through his
[44:23] body it's because
[44:24] somebody else spoke the word that
[44:26] somebody else is going to get it
[44:29] not necessarily speaking through angels
[44:31] and speaking through a cloud and
[44:32] speaking
[44:32] all the old testament all the other
[44:34] things he can do that but in mostly in
[44:36] the new church
[44:37] it's the creative power we're
[44:38] participating in god's creation because
[44:40] in the new testament
[44:41] it's new creations it's not the moon and
[44:43] the stars and the light and the
[44:45] and creation it's the new creation and
[44:47] that's in you
[44:48] we are new creations will you
[44:50] participate in someone else coming to a
[44:52] new creation
[44:54] you participate in creation
[44:57] so we have power in our words what we
[44:59] say
[45:01] all right let's make it simpler we're
[45:04] all here today
[45:06] in our lives we have what we have and we
[45:09] have our marriages and our families
[45:13] you know where it all started with words
[45:18] if nobody would have said nothing we
[45:20] wouldn't have what we have
[45:23] right so there's a certain creative
[45:27] power that happens that you're with the
[45:28] wife that you're with
[45:30] and you've got the family it all has
[45:32] developed and you've got the house and
[45:34] everything else
[45:35] but it came if nobody would have spoken
[45:37] something it would have never happened
[45:39] on a level like that the power of it
[45:42] let me get simpler i have four beautiful
[45:46] children i have a beautiful grandbaby i
[45:49] have a
[45:51] strong bodybuilding son-in-law
[45:54] i have a beautiful wife i have a
[45:58] nice home i have a nice truck
[46:03] i have a john deere tractor i'm just
[46:06] listing this stuff
[46:07] my world is just full of things now and
[46:10] i
[46:10] miss mostly a beautiful family and you
[46:12] know what
[46:13] i have all that today and even a lot of
[46:16] the
[46:17] ah never mind let's not go into that
[46:21] the financial benefits is more because
[46:23] she's better at that stuff than me
[46:26] but all i have all this because
[46:31] one day on the phone with becca
[46:36] i said the words i'm interested in you
[46:39] and i'm going to be spending more time
[46:41] with you
[46:45] that's what started it just a sentence
[46:48] and i got all this
[46:51] if i hadn't said that i wouldn't have
[46:53] all this
[46:54] look at all this i am a blessed man
[46:58] but i realize wow young people should
[47:00] watch what they say
[47:04] over the phone if you say i love you you
[47:06] better mean it
[47:08] but i said i'm interested in you and i'm
[47:12] going to be spending more time with you
[47:14] i was very confident
[47:15] i'm interested in you i'm going to be
[47:16] spending more time with you
[47:18] well she said the feeling is mutual
[47:24] and i said praise the lord
[47:30] do you have the holy ghost do you like
[47:33] freckles
[47:35] important questions before you get
[47:36] started
[47:39] but just think about i have all this and
[47:41] it's all
[47:42] that one sentence on the phone i've
[47:44] looked at that a lot how powerful
[47:46] are our words to actually create things
[47:49] in this realm
[47:51] and create our future by what we say
[47:54] so death and life in the power of the
[47:55] tongue we better watch what we say
[47:58] we better say lord let me say the right
[47:59] things let me be like hattie wright and
[48:01] say the right thing
[48:04] it actually and so that happens with my
[48:06] wife but look at hattie wright
[48:07] she said brother branham that ain't
[48:09] nothing but the truth
[48:11] triggered the holy spirit coming in that
[48:13] place just a simple little statement
[48:15] he said i give you the salvation of your
[48:17] two sons right now until she said the
[48:18] right thing in the presence of the lord
[48:21] she said it and so how
[48:24] powerful is our words to stir up the
[48:27] gift
[48:28] and what it is of christ in other people
[48:31] i think of peter that was standing there
[48:33] when jesus
[48:34] said i'll give you the keys to the
[48:36] kingdom and just a few days later
[48:38] there's several thousand people asking
[48:40] peter
[48:41] what do we need to do can you imagine
[48:43] being a place what do we need to do to
[48:45] be saved
[48:46] hundreds of thousands of people what do
[48:48] we need to do to be saved and guess what
[48:51] somebody was there with the keys to
[48:53] unlock to all of those people
[48:56] peter had to say it he's the one that
[48:59] had the words
[49:00] to unlock christ in that whole crowd
[49:05] and if you think that's different today
[49:07] it's not any different you have
[49:09] the keys of the kingdom i've been in
[49:12] situations in the last few years
[49:14] and i'm just casually talking and
[49:15] sharing my heart with someone
[49:17] in the grocery and the different things
[49:19] and i realized
[49:20] god was speaking to me through that they
[49:23] get back with me i see him again saying
[49:25] you know what you said one sentence
[49:27] there
[49:27] and you didn't realize what you were
[49:29] saying but it's changed my world
[49:33] it's happening now we have the creative
[49:35] power of god upon our lips
[49:37] and if there is a part of christ in us
[49:41] then what we say can stir it up and
[49:43] unlock it
[49:45] and bring it out you have the power to
[49:48] do that
[49:48] that's why he saved us that's why he
[49:50] fills us with the holy ghost and peter
[49:51] says
[49:52] yes repent and be baptized he had the
[49:55] keys to unlock
[49:57] salvation in the holy ghost to all of
[49:59] these people
[50:00] because he said i loose the kingdom of
[50:02] god to you now he
[50:03] he says he he just preached the word he
[50:05] just told the word
[50:06] he didn't necessarily the words say the
[50:08] words i loose the kingdom of god to you
[50:10] to be saved in jesus name no
[50:12] he just preached repentance and he
[50:15] preached the word
[50:16] and that's what unlocked to them the
[50:17] potentials of salvation
[50:20] brother brahma says in attitude in 1950
[50:22] i'm afraid
[50:23] that the church if you have that quote
[50:26] i'm afraid that the church
[50:28] doesn't know their authority i'm afraid
[50:31] that holy ghost
[50:32] born men doesn't realize their authority
[50:35] or the authority
[50:36] that god has permitted to his church
[50:38] i'll give unto thee
[50:40] the keys of the kingdom whatever you
[50:42] bind on earth
[50:43] will be bound in heaven whatever you
[50:45] loose will be loosed
[50:47] acts 1 and verse 8 if you have that
[50:49] scripture up there acts 1 and verse 8
[50:51] says
[50:52] ye shall re and ye shall receive power
[50:55] acts 1 and verse 8 ye shall receive
[50:58] power after which the holy ghost has
[51:01] come upon you how many is glad for the
[51:03] power
[51:05] the holy ghost brings power to live an
[51:07] overcoming life but ye
[51:08] shall receive power after the holy ghost
[51:12] has come upon you
[51:13] but it's not over and
[51:16] ye shall be witnesses unto me
[51:20] so god fills you with the holy ghost not
[51:22] just for power
[51:24] but that now you're going to be speaking
[51:26] as a witness
[51:29] you're going to bring it to someone else
[51:31] you're going to tap into what that
[51:33] christ is in someone else
[51:36] i trust this week that you can practice
[51:38] with this
[51:39] watch your words and say god anoint my
[51:41] words to say something
[51:42] to somebody in kindness in the holy
[51:45] spirit love can you say amen
[51:47] that would draw something in them of god
[51:49] out of them
[51:51] we have the power to do it creation is
[51:55] calling for something
[51:57] that is not there let there be light
[52:00] this this that its creation is calling
[52:03] for something that's not there
[52:05] if there's no love we bring it on by our
[52:08] words
[52:10] creation is something that's not there
[52:12] but we speak it and then it's there
[52:14] if there's no love we bring it on by our
[52:16] words no one will do it for us
[52:19] sons of god make it happen by faith
[52:22] religious people will for will wait
[52:24] religious people
[52:26] are always waiting for god to do it for
[52:30] them
[52:30] or someone else but jesus said if ye
[52:34] say to this mountain be thou removed
[52:41] believers call jesus on the sea and
[52:42] others want a distance between them and
[52:45] god if there's no peace we call for it
[52:49] if there's no happiness we call for it
[52:53] we ask for it we create it by the word
[52:56] of god
[52:58] some wait for god to deliver them from
[53:00] habits
[53:02] some say there's going to be a feeling
[53:04] sweep over me someday
[53:06] and i'll be delivered from this habit
[53:09] you might wait for a long time but i
[53:12] wonder if you just start speaking the
[53:14] positive word of god over your life
[53:18] and that habit will be done sometimes i
[53:21] speak it
[53:22] and habits are done by something i speak
[53:27] we have to recognize that death and life
[53:29] are in the power of the tongue
[53:31] and if you say to this mountain how many
[53:34] years did abraham declare things that
[53:35] were not as though they were
[53:40] too many in the church and in the
[53:42] message depend on others for other
[53:44] things
[53:44] and waiting for others but this is the
[53:47] hour of a personal revival
[53:49] not a national revival or even
[53:51] necessarily a church revival
[53:53] nobody's going to speak changes to
[53:56] things
[53:58] but when we begin to speak the word the
[54:01] positive attitude towards it
[54:03] we begin to bring out things in other
[54:05] people
[54:08] the more i look at it seems that we have
[54:09] a huge part in pulling the potentials of
[54:11] christ out of others
[54:12] we are handed the keys to unlock the
[54:15] kingdom within
[54:17] in this work of new creations god uses
[54:20] his own people to speak just the right
[54:21] words
[54:22] and to bring others and bring their
[54:23] potentials out in the first creation he
[54:26] by his word spoke
[54:27] unseen things into existence in this new
[54:30] creation
[54:30] he's still speaking it but on whose lips
[54:34] if something is laying there that is
[54:35] untapped
[54:37] if the word is to be may come flesh who
[54:39] is it that pulls this out
[54:41] god working through his body
[54:46] the bride is making a transition she's
[54:48] been making it for years
[54:50] and i believe it's these things chris
[54:52] the next chapter i'm going to take and
[54:53] joshua shows us
[54:54] the thing the land that was taken under
[54:56] moses and then the land that was taken
[54:58] under joshua
[54:59] there was just different stuff taken
[55:01] under moses and his leadership
[55:03] but everything changed under joshua and
[55:04] there was more land taken under joshua
[55:07] the bride is under the joshua commission
[55:09] and i believe that we're moving past
[55:12] just an emphasis on what the prophet
[55:15] was and all that the bride it's a body
[55:17] ministry
[55:18] you have to see that this word
[55:21] is in you and it must be spoken
[55:28] to untap the resources
[55:34] you're sitting there today i don't know
[55:35] who you are but you're saying that i've
[55:37] got a lot i'm bound by a lot
[55:38] my past everything i'm here to tell you
[55:41] that it can be gone in a moment's time
[55:43] your past
[55:44] it can be gone if you latch onto the
[55:46] word and say i believe this
[55:48] word i believe god is speaking to me and
[55:50] i believe my future
[55:51] is in the hands of god you'll watch
[55:54] those things fade away so quickly
[56:00] we have a participation in the creative
[56:02] work of god and i'm going to get into
[56:03] this in detail in another service
[56:05] but you wouldn't believe the power of
[56:07] the tongue
[56:08] to speak life to another individual
[56:13] that's why the body of christ is
[56:15] important
[56:16] we are participating in the very
[56:18] creation of god
[56:21] if it had been like that in the
[56:22] beginning he would have had us alongside
[56:26] as he spoke those things into existence
[56:30] if we'd have been there in these bodies
[56:31] he had us standing there
[56:33] and speaking those things with him today
[56:36] he's doing it
[56:37] in this new creation he's adding a stand
[56:40] there with the same word
[56:42] speaking life speaking the word into
[56:45] existence
[56:46] i just feel his presence here this
[56:48] morning these are deep thoughts but i
[56:51] think it's where the bride is going the
[56:52] bride of christ
[56:53] is moving past just an emphasis on the
[56:56] man
[56:57] william branham please understand not
[57:00] there's no disrespect but we're moving
[57:03] we're not moving past the message
[57:06] we're moving past the emphasis of what
[57:08] god did through him
[57:10] and taking this word and realized we
[57:13] are little creators
[57:18] and if you want to change in your home
[57:20] if you want to change in your life
[57:23] begin speaking the word
[57:28] sometimes inspiration hits you and you
[57:30] hold back and i don't say
[57:32] that sounds a little strange don't hold
[57:33] back if he puts something there
[57:35] speak it watch it
[57:39] develop watch it
[57:42] just cultivated and developed and
[57:44] materialize
[57:46] look what he said here in the third seal
[57:47] and i'm closing on this
[57:49] sir just see just stay behind the word
[57:54] that's all
[57:55] christ retreated to the word himself
[57:57] it's written see
[57:58] now stay behind the word but eve
[58:02] she began to kind of let down she never
[58:04] let it all down
[58:06] she only let one little phrase down and
[58:08] that's what satan wanted her to do
[58:10] he got her from behind god's promise by
[58:13] reasoning
[58:14] don't never try to reason god's word
[58:16] just believe it
[58:19] you see see we're taught by culture no
[58:22] no you don't do
[58:22] you don't ever do that and that's the
[58:25] problem with the culture that teaches it
[58:27] because that may be true with teachers
[58:30] that are teaching your children in
[58:31] school
[58:34] the government that's issuing things to
[58:37] us that
[58:38] from one day to the next change no trust
[58:41] in that
[58:43] when when covert was around we're
[58:44] supposed to trust the science trust the
[58:46] science trust the science
[58:50] stick with the science and then when the
[58:53] science is out about whether a guy is a
[58:55] guy or not and a girl's a girl or not
[58:58] ignore the science completely
[59:02] stupid
[59:05] just stupidity i have zero confidence in
[59:09] the
[59:09] political system the cdc none of it
[59:14] i'll follow certain rules but i'm
[59:16] telling you they don't know what they're
[59:17] doing
[59:19] they don't know because they're godless
[59:20] can you say man
[59:22] i got one trust and that's the god of
[59:24] this bible that's what i trust in
[59:27] but they teach us to be cynical towards
[59:30] everything the problem with being that
[59:32] way
[59:32] and just having this principle just
[59:34] believe it if god said it just believe
[59:37] the problem is if we use the world's
[59:38] mentality we'll talk ourselves
[59:40] and disbelieve the very gift and the
[59:43] very word he sent us
[59:45] and if we disbelieve that we're in
[59:47] trouble be skeptical
[59:49] be this be hesitant be not when it comes
[59:52] to the pure word of god
[59:56] that's the devil talking to you if it's
[59:58] the word believe it
[1:00:00] receive it and watch it materialize in
[1:00:02] your life
[1:00:03] praise the lord
[1:00:08] let me finish this quote he says now
[1:00:15] he got her from behind god's promise by
[1:00:17] reasoning don't never try to reason
[1:00:18] god's word just believe it
[1:00:19] so she stepped out from there and before
[1:00:22] adam
[1:00:22] ever got to her for a wife she was
[1:00:25] already defiled by satan
[1:00:27] and she and did you notice christ did
[1:00:29] the same thing
[1:00:30] exactly now for redeeming now he's in
[1:00:33] the subject of redeeming now
[1:00:35] god had to be there first and did you
[1:00:38] notice mary
[1:00:39] before she come to joseph the holy
[1:00:40] spirit had done
[1:00:42] got there amen see that's where the
[1:00:44] redeemer come
[1:00:45] that's a powerful point is that the
[1:00:47] serpent got to eve this proves
[1:00:49] serpentine
[1:00:50] the serpent got to eve before adam did
[1:00:55] so when he reverses it all back for
[1:00:56] redemption
[1:00:58] god got the seed into mary before her
[1:01:01] husband joseph
[1:01:03] and it was a physical seed talked to
[1:01:06] someone a few weeks ago
[1:01:07] was it a physical serpent seed yes it
[1:01:08] was physical not just a spiritual
[1:01:10] it was a physical seed why because
[1:01:13] mary had a physical seed put in her the
[1:01:16] very supernatural god
[1:01:18] and she had a baby and it was christ she
[1:01:21] had a real baby she didn't have a
[1:01:22] spiritual baby
[1:01:25] so if she had to have a real baby then
[1:01:28] it must have been a real baby that come
[1:01:30] out of the serpent
[1:01:33] i know we said the serpent nature and
[1:01:35] the spirit of it and all those other
[1:01:36] things
[1:01:37] but it wasn't adam who had cain
[1:01:43] it was not just a spiritual deception
[1:01:45] going on with eve
[1:01:46] it was a physical deception and a sex
[1:01:49] act
[1:01:50] and and before adam got to her with his
[1:01:53] seed
[1:01:54] the serpent got to her so how do i know
[1:01:57] that
[1:01:58] because when he comes to mary he gets to
[1:02:01] her
[1:02:01] before joseph
[1:02:05] i just settled so much in my heart just
[1:02:07] now excuse me a minute while i shout a
[1:02:09] little bit
[1:02:09] because i was trying to explain that to
[1:02:11] somebody and and that just opened up to
[1:02:13] me so
[1:02:14] real that if the serpent got to to eve
[1:02:18] before her husband did then god had to
[1:02:21] get to mary's room with a physical
[1:02:23] seed before
[1:02:26] her husband joseph all right praise god
[1:02:31] now notice i know i said i was stopping
[1:02:33] about 45 minutes ago
[1:02:35] i'm all over the place today i don't
[1:02:37] even know i'm just tired that's all
[1:02:39] there is to it
[1:02:40] but in my soul i'm ready to shout praise
[1:02:43] the lord brother ray
[1:02:47] all right notice the natural woman fell
[1:02:49] and god made a way for her to be
[1:02:51] redeemed
[1:02:51] although she had fallen he made a way
[1:02:54] now that was the first bite on earth
[1:02:55] fell before her husband
[1:02:56] and her were married she fell by the
[1:02:58] reasoning instead of staying with the
[1:03:00] word she fell and she fell to death
[1:03:02] eternal separation with her she took her
[1:03:05] husband and everything else there was on
[1:03:06] the earth she fell
[1:03:07] but now but god full of mercy made a way
[1:03:10] to redeem that woman
[1:03:12] and now he promised her notice now how
[1:03:14] did that entire fall take place
[1:03:16] it started with words from the serpent
[1:03:20] words how powerful was the words of the
[1:03:23] serpent
[1:03:24] to deceive eve and reason with the word
[1:03:26] it started right there with a little
[1:03:28] sentence
[1:03:30] and the fall of the entire creation took
[1:03:32] place
[1:03:33] because satan misinterpreted the word
[1:03:36] how powerful is it in your life
[1:03:38] when you say sentences i'm going to get
[1:03:41] into it
[1:03:41] i'm going to get into these little
[1:03:43] arguments and these little things that
[1:03:45] you say to tear down people
[1:03:46] and these gossips don't come next sunday
[1:03:49] if you want to preach
[1:03:50] gossip preached on i'm going to preach
[1:03:52] on it because i don't care what you say
[1:03:54] here in church
[1:03:55] what you're saying at home in your home
[1:03:56] creates an atmosphere in your home
[1:03:59] what you're saying to your children
[1:04:00] creates an atmosphere and creates their
[1:04:02] future many times
[1:04:07] the true word would be known to her now
[1:04:09] remember because he promised christ to
[1:04:11] the woman and christ is the word
[1:04:12] saint john 1 in the beginning was the
[1:04:13] word was with god and the word was god
[1:04:15] and the word became flesh and dwelt with
[1:04:16] us
[1:04:17] god dwelt with us in flesh he was the
[1:04:19] word i'm coming to the point
[1:04:21] before a word it's a thought and a
[1:04:24] thought
[1:04:25] has to be created okay
[1:04:29] how is that created before the word it's
[1:04:32] a thought and a thought has to be
[1:04:33] created all right so god's thoughts
[1:04:34] become
[1:04:35] creation when it was spoke by a word
[1:04:40] that's when he presents it to you as a
[1:04:42] thought
[1:04:44] his thoughts and it is revealed to you
[1:04:47] now stop right there a lot of people
[1:04:49] even in the message
[1:04:50] stop right there his thoughts
[1:04:54] we're hearing his thoughts preached
[1:04:55] every sunday when we get into the word
[1:04:58] we're hearing his thoughts preached
[1:05:00] and then things are revealed to us but
[1:05:01] that's not the end
[1:05:03] his thoughts is revealed to you
[1:05:06] then it's still a thought until
[1:05:10] you speak it
[1:05:16] it's where the bride is that's where the
[1:05:17] bride's going
[1:05:19] because they're reading their helmet
[1:05:21] preach preaching conventions all the
[1:05:22] thoughts of god oh we're rejoicing the
[1:05:24] thoughts of god thoughts of god
[1:05:26] and uh listen if you're not bringing it
[1:05:27] down personally to you and speaking
[1:05:29] those things
[1:05:30] you're missing something right it still
[1:05:34] stays in thought form until you speak it
[1:05:39] don't you see where jesus said if i say
[1:05:40] to if you say to this mountain
[1:05:42] not if i say jesus jesus but if you say
[1:05:44] to this mountain be moved
[1:05:45] and the first thing i guess in moses
[1:05:47] time big old green fly
[1:05:50] i don't know where that quote is but i'm
[1:05:51] skipping down here
[1:05:56] he can do what he wants to he's god the
[1:05:58] creator the only thing he can do is just
[1:06:00] speak it
[1:06:00] that's right he's this creator
[1:06:04] what's the next one you have brother
[1:06:05] kyle is there another one or not
[1:06:07] okay i'll get it here
[1:06:11] notice that god told eve that after so
[1:06:13] long a time the word is coming back to
[1:06:14] you
[1:06:15] now how did she fall i want my class to
[1:06:17] say it what did she fall from
[1:06:19] what did eve fall from the word
[1:06:24] is that right the word and god said he'd
[1:06:27] make a way to redeem her back
[1:06:29] to the word again all right after so
[1:06:31] long a time
[1:06:32] the word would be known to her all right
[1:06:34] the word would come for one purpose now
[1:06:37] redemption how do we get back how are we
[1:06:41] redeemed
[1:06:42] how does all this work its way back
[1:06:46] we have the word we speak the word
[1:06:50] we fell from the word he gives us this
[1:06:53] word back again
[1:06:55] we bring it into our lives and we speak
[1:06:57] it
[1:06:58] and we say lord when i spoke this i'm
[1:07:00] waiting for it to materialize
[1:07:03] it's going to start happening just like
[1:07:04] when he said let there be light as
[1:07:06] soon as it's spoken by holy ghost the
[1:07:08] holy ghost
[1:07:09] it starts to develop and materialize and
[1:07:12] become
[1:07:12] what it needs to become
[1:07:15] if you have something
[1:07:19] impossible i'm preaching to you
[1:07:23] a god that nothing is impossible
[1:07:27] and your way out is a lot easier than
[1:07:30] what
[1:07:31] the devil making the devil make it he's
[1:07:32] making it complicated
[1:07:34] but you're way out of things and you're
[1:07:35] changed and you're
[1:07:38] it's a lot simpler than what you're
[1:07:40] making it we have the word
[1:07:42] and if we have the word we put that upon
[1:07:44] our heart and we put it upon our lips
[1:07:47] and we watch god friends
[1:07:50] this message in this word is not church
[1:07:56] it's not another movement
[1:08:00] it's not another hatched teaching from a
[1:08:03] man out of a denomination
[1:08:05] please this doesn't even have to do
[1:08:09] very much with william branham
[1:08:14] this is god's word restored back to us
[1:08:17] and when we have the word back and we
[1:08:20] take it
[1:08:21] and we speak it it will do all the
[1:08:23] things that are impossible to us
[1:08:27] if if i didn't know that i wouldn't
[1:08:30] preach
[1:08:32] because i'd just be another preacher
[1:08:33] that's waiting for my seminary notes to
[1:08:35] come from things and
[1:08:37] no life in it this is not that
[1:08:41] this is the spoken word of god the
[1:08:44] original thoughts of god
[1:08:46] coming to his people again
[1:08:49] is that too deep for everybody that's
[1:08:50] not too deep is it eve fell from the
[1:08:52] word god gave it back to us
[1:08:54] when we speak it watch it do its work
[1:08:58] and i want to get into the power that
[1:09:00] you have with the holy ghost
[1:09:02] to speak life to someone and we shut our
[1:09:06] mouths
[1:09:06] my mom used to have a song unspoken
[1:09:08] words how my life is so filled with
[1:09:10] unspoken words we hesitate
[1:09:12] we hold back we don't need to hold back
[1:09:14] i'm not talking about being belligerent
[1:09:16] but i'm saying you have something within
[1:09:18] you and sometimes you just speak that
[1:09:21] word
[1:09:22] and you you'll see things begin to stir
[1:09:24] up
[1:09:26] in another life your teenager your child
[1:09:30] your coworker he has it
[1:09:34] oh i'm not a preacher no no this doesn't
[1:09:36] have to do with preachers now
[1:09:37] this is the life in his body you could
[1:09:40] have
[1:09:40] speak the creative word of god
