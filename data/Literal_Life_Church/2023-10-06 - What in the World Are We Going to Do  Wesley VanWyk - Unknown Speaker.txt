What In The World!

Lyrics:
Verse 1
He walked the road of suffering
Yet He walked upon the water
He held out a loving hand
When no one else would bother
He gave His life, a sacrifice 
To redeem His sons and daughters
And He lived His life to show us
How to live a life for others

Chorus
What in the world are we gonna do? 
What in the world are we gonna say? 
When He comes for His chosen few,
Would He be proud of us today? 
Even though we're not of this world, 
Even though we're not here to stay, 
He has placed us where we stand, 
To be a light and show the way

Verse 2
Sometimes in our suffering 
We forget we can walk on water
We justify our idle hands
And say we're too busy to bother
But we're called to live in sacrifice
To bless His sons and daughters 
So I ask you, as you live your life,
Are you living it for others?

Chorus
What in the world are we gonna do? 
What in the world are we gonna say? 
When He comes for His chosen few,
Would He be proud of us today? 
Even though we're not of this world, 
Even though we're not here to stay, 
He has placed us where we stand, 
To be a light and show the way

Bridge
Jesus came into the world but not for no good reason He came to give eternal life to those who would just listen Just because He lives in you that doesn't change His mission So go ye into all the world and give what you've been given
