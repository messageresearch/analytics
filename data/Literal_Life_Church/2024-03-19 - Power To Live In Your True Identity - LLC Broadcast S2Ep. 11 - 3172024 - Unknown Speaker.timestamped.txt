[2:14] Jesus will sing and Sh the
[2:19] [Applause]
[2:21] Victory and when he had taken the book
[2:23] The Four beast and 4 and 20 Elders fell
[2:26] down before the lamb having every one of
[2:28] them Harps and golden V full of odors
[2:31] which are the prayers of the Saints and
[2:33] they sung a new song saying Thou Art
[2:35] Worthy to take the book and to open the
[2:36] seals thereof for thou was slain and H
[2:39] has redeemed us to God by thy blood out
[2:42] of every Kindred and tongue and people
[2:43] and nation and Hast made us unto our God
[2:46] Kings and Priests and we shall reign on
[2:48] the earth and I beheld and I heard the
[2:51] voice of many angels round about the
[2:52] throne and the beasts and the elders and
[2:55] the number of them was 10,000 time
[2:57] 10,000 and thousands of thousands saying
[2:59] saying with a loud voice Worthy is the
[3:01] Lamb that was slain to receive power and
[3:04] riches and wisdom and strength and honor
[3:07] and glory and blessing and every
[3:09] creature which is in heaven and on the
[3:10] earth under the Earth and such as are in
[3:12] the sea and all that are in them heard I
[3:16] saying blessing and honor and glory and
[3:19] power be unto him that sth upon the
[3:20] throne and unto the lamb forever and
[3:23] ever in the four Beast said amen and the
[3:25] four and 20 Elders fell down and
[3:27] worshiped him that liveth forever and
[3:29] ever chapter five is the emphasis and
[3:31] the theme about this book of redemption
[3:35] and so because of that I want to look at
[3:37] it because it's important to us and to
[3:39] realize that uh Revelations 5 becomes an
[3:43] emphasis on this book and Revelations 10
[3:46] is an emphasis on the book Because when
[3:48] he came down that same book was open in
[3:50] Revelations 10 so uh what we have
[3:53] learned is that it can be called The
[3:55] Book of redemption but I'm calling it
[3:57] The Book of our true identity this is
[3:59] the book of our true identity because it
[4:01] says our names are in the Lamb's Book of
[4:05] Life before the foundation of the world
[4:08] so it is our name it is our part not
[4:10] necessarily our physical name but it is
[4:13] our identity in Christ is our identity
[4:16] in him so I'm calling it not just a book
[4:18] of redemption but a a book of our true
[4:20] identity isn't it amazing that God
[4:23] allows us to look upon our true identity
[4:27] in Jesus Christ isn't it a part ful
[4:30] thing to see who you really are because
[4:32] you've been told a lot of different
[4:34] things in your life and you've believed
[4:35] a lot of things about yourself but when
[4:38] God says no no wait a minute let me look
[4:40] at what I thought of you before the
[4:41] foundation of the world it is there's
[4:43] power in knowing your position there's
[4:46] power in in in knowing your true
[4:48] identity and that's what I want to talk
[4:50] about tonight power to live in your true
[4:52] identity I'll say it again the power to
[4:55] live in your true identity because once
[4:58] you begin to catch it you can live every
[5:01] day not just at church not just at camp
[5:04] but to live in your true identity every
[5:06] day confident perfect Faith walking no
[5:10] devil can tell you otherwise when you
[5:12] really know who you are no devil can
[5:14] tell you no you're not that you're
[5:16] something else no you say to the devil I
[5:18] Know Who I Really
[5:19] Am amen so there's power there there's
[5:22] power and position there's power in
[5:24] knowing who you I've of often used the
[5:26] illustration many times of someone who's
[5:28] adopted by a family and they never knew
[5:30] their true father or mother and uh I
[5:33] I've used examples where you know years
[5:34] ago they would bring these people and
[5:37] they would do research and find their
[5:38] true father find their uh True Mother
[5:41] and many times they'll bring them
[5:42] together on a television show and it's a
[5:44] big event first time they ever met one
[5:46] another you know and they'll make a big
[5:48] deal out of it Hollywood likes to do
[5:49] that but you can do that you can pay the
[5:51] money you can track it down if you never
[5:53] knew your true daddy never knew your
[5:55] true mama and there's something
[5:57] interesting if you watch some of these
[5:59] uh uh these uh reunions or these times
[6:01] they come together it really has an
[6:03] effect on them and they of course the
[6:05] initial reaction is a lot of tears and
[6:07] their embracing and to meet your true
[6:09] dad and who you really uh came from not
[6:12] just your adopted parents but you see
[6:14] and and and then they'll show sometimes
[6:16] where you get together with them and you
[6:18] have dinner with them and what happens
[6:20] is is normally what happens is as you're
[6:23] with them the more that you're with your
[6:24] true daddy the more you look at yourself
[6:27] and you say hey I'm recognizing
[6:29] characteristics that is in me that's in
[6:32] my
[6:33] father after you're with him a while you
[6:35] realize I understand why I act this way
[6:39] I understand why I have this little uh
[6:41] thing that I do I understand why this
[6:43] look my eye a certain way or twitch my
[6:46] nose a certain way I understand because
[6:48] your characteristics and even your
[6:49] character and everything that you are
[6:51] begins to come out and you never knew
[6:53] why you acted that way but when you're
[6:55] with your father you start to say now I
[6:57] know who I really am I can see the image
[7:00] of myself in my father and that's what
[7:03] this book is about being revealed it is
[7:05] your true identity and there's power to
[7:08] live in that every
[7:11] day and you start to wash away the old
[7:14] you and what you are nothing the Bible
[7:16] says he that comes to Christ he's a new
[7:18] creature old things pass away and All
[7:21] Things become new well that means your
[7:22] identity is being revealed to you and
[7:25] you don't live like you used to live you
[7:27] don't act like you used to act you don't
[7:29] play out something that said you're
[7:31] supposed to be a drunk because all your
[7:32] family was drunk you you play out this
[7:34] oh they they go to depression and so
[7:36] that's the way I lean because it's in my
[7:38] jeans well I'm here to tell you you got
[7:40] some other genes tonight you got some
[7:42] spiritual genes and they're more
[7:44] powerful than your family jeans
[7:47] Hallelujah and you start to look at this
[7:49] book and you realize we are learning our
[7:52] true identity and our true name is in it
[7:55] our spiritual part of Christ so when you
[7:57] think about uh what happens here in the
[7:59] Book of Revelations and Revelations 5
[8:01] when you're at this point of Revelations
[8:03] 5 you realize that there have been 2,000
[8:06] years of Mighty works of the Holy Ghost
[8:09] in the church that's a lot of years of
[8:12] God performing a lot of things to show
[8:15] he's real 2,000 years of Mighty works of
[8:18] the Holy Ghost and the church acting out
[8:20] who she was even under the worst Dark
[8:23] Ages there would be still a little bit
[8:25] of light that would shine in each age
[8:27] and there was some manifestation of God
[8:30] even though they weren't able to look at
[8:31] their full place in The Book of Life
[8:33] they caught it because they were a seed
[8:35] they caught the age that they were
[8:36] living in they believe with all their
[8:38] heart and there was some manifestation
[8:40] of God in their life and God did Mighty
[8:42] things through the Believers from the
[8:44] book of Acts all the way through for
[8:46] 2,000 years he did Mighty powerful
[8:48] things how many believe that even in the
[8:50] Dark Ages he did powerful things but see
[8:53] now and in Dark Ages and and and in the
[8:56] thousands of Miracles and many w wonders
[8:59] and signs were done and it become very
[9:02] strained and limited there was less
[9:04] signs and wonders there was less that
[9:06] the power of God shown in the Dark Ages
[9:08] because of tre Creeds and dogmas but
[9:11] then in the in the Reformation age then
[9:14] we find it begin to burst out of this
[9:16] bondage of creed and dogs and begin to
[9:18] burst out in in the pieces of
[9:20] reformation it begin to burst out and
[9:23] express itself again and then uh Luther
[9:26] and then Wesley's day bursted out a
[9:28] little bit more that we begin to see
[9:30] these lights of God and God doing things
[9:32] and so as a whole God did many things
[9:34] for 2,000 years there was a lot of
[9:36] rejoicing there was more and more
[9:38] worship and then in the next chapter in
[9:41] time we find the attention after 2,000
[9:44] years the attention turns to a
[9:49] book now if we're looking for the next
[9:52] thing we're going wh what's what's
[9:55] taking place here why why a book why
[9:57] does that come into the symbolism
[9:59] because it was symbolism this book of
[10:00] redemption it's not a physical book
[10:02] somewhere it's your life before the
[10:05] foundation of the world your name
[10:07] written in Christ so it's a spiritual
[10:10] connotation but we've realized it the
[10:12] the symbolism come in Revelations 5
[10:14] there's a book there's a book all the
[10:16] things God did but here's now a book and
[10:18] it's the book of redemption it's got
[10:20] names in it it's still sealed with Seven
[10:22] Seals so the final thing God as we get
[10:24] to the final stages of the age the book
[10:27] has to come in play and explained it in
[10:29] the first service you can go back I I
[10:31] laid out a lot of things about this book
[10:32] of redemption but the reason I had to
[10:35] come back to the church is because it's
[10:36] a title deed and Adam lost it in the
[10:39] garden ever since the garden Adam lost
[10:41] the title deed to this earth he lost his
[10:43] power he lost his possession over this
[10:45] Earth he lost his position can you say
[10:47] amen and somewhere along the line God
[10:50] had to give this title deed back to the
[10:53] people of God again so now this title de
[10:56] or this book has to come back in the
[10:58] hands of the people but it couldn't
[11:01] could not come in back in our hands by
[11:03] ourselves we needed a an intercessor we
[11:06] needed an in between we needed someone
[11:09] that was worthy to come and take the
[11:11] book and that was our kinsman redeemer
[11:13] Jesus Christ Redemption is not just
[11:16] paying the price Redemption is the power
[11:19] to bring you and claim you and bring you
[11:22] back so after Seven Ages he had paid the
[11:25] price and he was the only one worthy to
[11:27] take this book of redemption in the name
[11:28] of that were in the book and claim them
[11:30] back for himself and bring them to a
[11:32] millennium and bring them to Kings and
[11:34] Priests again he was the only one worthy
[11:36] and that's why when you get to
[11:38] Revelations 5 the book comes into play
[11:41] and the book gets into the hands of our
[11:43] Kinsmen and worship spontaneous worship
[11:46] just breaks out like never
[11:49] before not because necessarily the power
[11:51] of God but the power of what this book
[11:55] can do to your life blessed be his name
[12:00] amen that's exactly where the last days
[12:04] comes into is this revealing of the book
[12:06] and it becomes such a huge thing as a
[12:09] whole God did many things there was a
[12:11] lot of rejoicing there was more and more
[12:13] worship and then we find a book that's
[12:16] sealed and it's amazing the worship that
[12:18] came from the land I just read it to you
[12:20] in Revelation 5 it is amazing the
[12:22] worship that came from the lamb taking
[12:24] this book and then it being opened the
[12:26] worship was amazing going to some points
[12:29] now worship and power at this point was
[12:33] at a whole new
[12:36] level worship and power was at a whole
[12:39] new level than what it was before it was
[12:44] greater it was greater than just the
[12:47] blessings of the Holy Ghost
[12:50] amen the blessings of the Holy Ghost are
[12:53] wonderful and I thank God when they come
[12:57] I I'll say this sometimes they come
[13:00] sometimes you feel God sometimes you
[13:03] don't I've been in some great meetings
[13:05] and on Monday I didn't feel God at all
[13:08] and that's when I had to know who I was
[13:10] in the book of
[13:11] Redemption how am I going to defeat a
[13:13] devil if I'm looking for the same
[13:15] feeling that I had at some meeting I I I
[13:17] can't go on a feeling I'm going to have
[13:19] to know something deeper My Worship is
[13:21] going to have to continue on Monday can
[13:23] I get an amen My Worship and my
[13:25] overcoming and my power has to continue
[13:28] on Monday not just the
[13:30] weekend and here we find the worship and
[13:33] power when this book was open the
[13:36] worship and the power was at a whole new
[13:38] level it was greater it was greater than
[13:40] a blessing it's greater than the power
[13:43] for miracles that's what they had all
[13:45] during the ages is the powerful Miracles
[13:48] but this was a greater worship and even
[13:50] a greater power and that's why I'm
[13:52] talking about the power to live with
[13:54] this book of identity the power to live
[13:56] it because we got to do more than shout
[13:58] of about it we've got to live
[14:00] it it's got to affect us in such a
[14:03] powerful way that's
[14:05] true the worship in Revelations 5 the
[14:08] worship was related to this book coming
[14:11] back into the hands our of Our Redeemer
[14:14] and that means the Redeemer could claim
[14:16] back who was written in there he could
[14:18] give back our inheritance he could
[14:20] restore us to our true identity and we
[14:23] could look at it and see it the worship
[14:26] going on was about this book that it was
[14:29] in the hands of Our Redeemer that he was
[14:31] the only one that would tear the seals
[14:32] off it and reveal it he he could give it
[14:35] back to those who that inheritance he
[14:37] could restore us to our true identity no
[14:39] wonder the worship become exuberant at
[14:42] the opening of this
[14:43] book amen Worship in Revelations 5 at
[14:48] the end time was about this book being
[14:52] revealed and it when it begin to break
[14:55] then we realize from verse 11 to verse
[14:58] 14 I read the rest of the chapter it
[15:00] wasn't just the elders we find in um
[15:04] verse 9 if you just have your Bible
[15:05] still open verse 8 when he had taken the
[15:07] book The Four Beast four excuse me the
[15:10] Beast and the four and 20 Elders fell
[15:11] down having every one of them Harps and
[15:14] golden vials full of oders which are the
[15:15] prayers of the Saints because now you're
[15:17] dealing with the past who had gone to
[15:19] the Grave already in Christ and they
[15:21] pray their prayer was actually that that
[15:25] their lamb would step forth and make
[15:26] claims and bring them to be Kings and
[15:28] Priests and the Millennium their prayer
[15:30] was that and now their prayers are
[15:31] coming up because now the lamb is
[15:34] initiating this whole thing of claiming
[15:36] all these back even the ones that were
[15:37] already in the grave and all their
[15:40] prayers are coming up and everything is
[15:41] rushing up because here we are our lamb
[15:44] took the book this is the time
[15:46] everything I prayed for I brought my
[15:48] prayers I brought my peirs but I wasn't
[15:50] at the time of the Rapture I wasn't at
[15:52] the time of the opening of the book I
[15:54] didn't see everything of who I really
[15:55] was but the last days we'll see the book
[15:58] and when the lamb takes it then all
[16:00] those prayers came up oh my prayer is
[16:02] going to be
[16:04] answered my redeemer like job said with
[16:07] all his trouble he said you can tell me
[16:09] I'm sinning all you want you can put me
[16:11] down you can make me depressed I can I
[16:14] can be all a mess can you say Amen but
[16:16] he said I know my redeemer lives and
[16:19] he'll stand for me in that day I have a
[16:23] redeemer he hasn't come yet but I know
[16:26] he lives and he's going to stand for me
[16:27] in that day amen glory be to
[16:31] God it was how many two thou 2,000 years
[16:34] later and he says I know my redeemer
[16:36] lives the answer is going to be he sent
[16:39] up that prayer he knew what was going to
[16:40] happen and now it's happening he's
[16:42] taking the book he's opening the seals
[16:44] all the prayers come up but it wasn't
[16:45] just that verse 11 behold I heard the
[16:48] voice of many angels round about the
[16:49] throne and beasts and the elders the
[16:51] number of them was 10,000 times thousand
[16:53] that's a lot of people worshiping it's a
[16:55] pretty big
[16:56] convention thousands of thousands begin
[16:59] to worship at this time when this book
[17:02] is open saying with a loud voice worthy
[17:04] the lamb that was slain and then verse
[17:07] 13 John take John is a personal thing
[17:10] now something happened to him every
[17:12] creature was in heaven Earth under the
[17:14] Earth in the sea Every Creature heard me
[17:17] saying it says saying but if every
[17:19] creature heard him he was not saying he
[17:21] was screaming and
[17:26] shouting how loud was he he was pretty
[17:29] loud and he said how loud he was I'm
[17:32] telling you I shouted so loud until
[17:34] everything under the sea heard me
[17:37] shout and what was it about what was the
[17:39] shout
[17:41] about just thought of that make sure you
[17:44] know what your shout is
[17:47] about that's my subject tonight is the
[17:49] motive of our worship and I'm telling
[17:52] you the motive of this worship was not
[17:54] just that God was powerful to cast out
[17:57] Devils but the motive motive of this
[17:59] worship was this book of identity being
[18:03] revealed that I can
[18:05] say I know who I am I'm starting to see
[18:09] who I really
[18:10] am and that has more power over the
[18:12] enemy than
[18:14] anything true a confident son or
[18:17] daughter of God in perfect Faith stable
[18:20] knowing their place in the word and
[18:22] knowing they're of God the devil the
[18:25] devil can't do much with
[18:27] them
[18:28] that's true because they're starting to
[18:30] see their true identity see then the
[18:32] reason for all of this worship is the
[18:35] Redeemer opening up our true life to us
[18:39] we can see it our true identity the
[18:42] power our our true inheritance he gives
[18:45] it back to us the power of seeing it
[18:48] will raise us up to adopted sons and
[18:51] position of confidence not arrogance but
[18:55] confidence I want to draw a distinction
[18:58] between arrogance and
[19:01] confidence true Godly humility emerges
[19:06] from this book because the kinsman
[19:08] redeemer had the character of
[19:11] humility he was the lion and he was the
[19:15] lamb yes and so the revealing of this
[19:18] comes with the revealing of Christ's
[19:20] character that humility comes with it
[19:23] can you say Amen but faith comes with it
[19:26] adopted Sons comes with it position and
[19:29] it's a position of perfect faith and
[19:32] confidence in who you are perfect faith
[19:35] in perfect humility the motive behind
[19:38] the worship is not that God is doing
[19:43] Miracles the worship is going on not
[19:47] because God is doing the Miracles now
[19:49] don't ever stop praising God for him
[19:52] doing
[19:53] Miracles I'm not talking about that we
[19:56] should always thank God and I don't care
[19:59] if he heals through medicine or music
[20:00] however he heals or laying hands
[20:02] whatever it is we should give the glory
[20:04] to
[20:05] God
[20:06] hallelujah we should be rejoicing can
[20:09] you say Amen but I want to point out to
[20:11] you that this rejoicing this worship
[20:13] isn't just that God is a god of Miracles
[20:16] because he's been a god of Miracles for
[20:18] 2,000 years he's raised the Dead He's
[20:21] healed the sick he's healed cancer he's
[20:23] opened up the blinded
[20:25] eyes and so this worship goes deeper
[20:28] than just he's a god of Miracles because
[20:31] I can tell you A lot of people can get
[20:34] excited and happy when God does a
[20:36] miracle even
[20:39] unbelievers true are are you holding on
[20:42] tonight even unbelievers can get excited
[20:45] and maybe even lift their hands and
[20:47] praise God because God did a
[20:51] miracle but they have no intention of
[20:54] getting into the kernel of the life of
[20:56] this and that's why say say I say this
[20:59] is a power to live the life this isn't
[21:01] just a power for miracles the motive
[21:04] behind the worship is not that God is
[21:06] doing Miracles not that God is doing
[21:08] things through us that's not it the
[21:10] motive behind is I am not what I thought
[21:12] I was the motive behind the worship is
[21:14] that I'm not what I thought I was I'm a
[21:16] CH I am a child of God I'm a Child of
[21:19] God by my spiritual genetics that's the
[21:22] exuberance of worship I'm recognizing
[21:25] I'm a Child of God listen if you're at
[21:27] one sign that you're not recognizing
[21:29] that is you're dabbling in you're having
[21:31] an identity crisis and you're still
[21:34] trying to copy someone
[21:36] else you don't know who you are but this
[21:39] Revelation comes with a power that says
[21:41] I am who I am by the grace of God I am a
[21:43] child of God by spiritual genetics my
[21:46] DNA has been revealed to me my true DNA
[21:49] has been revealed and that's why I'm so
[21:54] happy the book of identity and seeing my
[21:57] name there is the motive behind my
[22:00] praise not that I have power to cast out
[22:04] Devils now you just put your seat Bel on
[22:06] here okay because I'm a pastor teaching
[22:08] something here it's all biblical okay
[22:11] but I'm going to teach you something
[22:13] Jesus had to direct and correct the
[22:16] worship of his disciples that got
[22:20] misdirected the worship got
[22:24] misdirected and Jesus had to correct the
[22:27] worship because it was getting
[22:30] imbalanced Mark chapter 6 I want you to
[22:33] see it in the Bible Mark chapter 6 this
[22:35] is when he sent sent his 12 disciples
[22:38] out Mark 6 and verse 7 and he called
[22:42] unto them the 12 and began to send them
[22:44] forth two by two and gave them power
[22:47] over unclean spirits and commanded them
[22:50] that they should not take take nothing
[22:51] for their Journey save a staff only no
[22:53] strip no bread no money for their purse
[22:56] but he Shaw with sandals and but be shod
[22:59] with sandals and not put on two coats
[23:00] and he said in what place soever you
[23:02] enter in that house there abide till you
[23:04] depart from that place and whosoever
[23:06] shall not receive you nor hear you when
[23:08] you depart then shake off the dust under
[23:10] your feet for the testimony against them
[23:11] verily I say unto you it shall be more
[23:13] tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in that
[23:15] day of judgment than for that City and
[23:17] they went out and preached and men that
[23:19] men should repent and they cast out many
[23:22] devils and Anointed with oil many that
[23:25] were sick and healed them
[23:28] praise be to God if you get sent from
[23:31] God that's what's going to
[23:32] happen and we praise the Lord for it he
[23:36] sent his disciple he didn't go with them
[23:38] he sent his disciples out to cast out
[23:40] devils in his name and they anointed
[23:44] people and they were healed praise the
[23:47] Lord
[23:48] amen can I point out that this is before
[23:51] the holy ghost in the upper
[23:54] room that this power was given
[24:00] so the power that came from The Upper
[24:02] Room must have been a deeper power than
[24:06] this power that he gave them to cast out
[24:09] Devils then you pick it up over in Luke
[24:12] 10 and verse one we have the same thing
[24:14] he sends them out I want to read this
[24:16] account of it after he sent out the
[24:19] disciples 2 by two after these things
[24:21] the Lord appointed other 70 also and
[24:24] sent them two by two before his face
[24:26] into every city and place whether
[24:28] himself would come therefore he said
[24:30] unto them the Harvest is truly great but
[24:32] the labors are filled pray ye therefore
[24:34] the lord of the Harvest that he would
[24:36] send forth labors into the Harvest go
[24:38] your ways behold I send you forth as
[24:40] Lambs Among Wolves and then he gives a
[24:42] lot of the same instructions you know
[24:44] not to what not to take what to take and
[24:47] the house that you remain in and those
[24:48] that receive you and so I'm skipping now
[24:51] all the way down to verse 17 after they
[24:54] went out and the 70 returned again with
[24:59] Joy saying Lord even the devils are
[25:02] subject unto us through thy name they
[25:06] were
[25:07] rejoicing because the Devils were
[25:09] subject to them and they
[25:13] were they had power over
[25:17] devils and he said unto them I beheld
[25:20] Satan as lightning fall from Heaven
[25:22] behold I give you power to tread on
[25:25] serpents and scorpions and Over All all
[25:28] the power of the enemy and nothing shall
[25:30] by any means hurt you stop right
[25:34] there now if you know your Bible like
[25:38] this is the 70 that's called out to do
[25:40] all these
[25:42] things
[25:44] and but isn't this the 70 that left him
[25:48] in John chapter
[25:52] 6 and there was only 12 left and one of
[25:55] the ones that were In This Crowd that
[25:56] was casting out Des was
[25:58] Judas so these 70 said this is too when
[26:02] the word came this is too hard of a
[26:04] saying yes sir we'd like to just stick
[26:07] with the casting out Devils come on now
[26:11] don't get mad at me on we'd like to
[26:14] stick with that it seems a lot more
[26:17] exciting but when he began to bring the
[26:19] word and said I and my flesh are one he
[26:22] began to bring them deeper then they
[26:23] said this is a hard saying and many
[26:26] therefore of his disciples took an exit
[26:28] from there the same ones that were given
[26:30] power over the
[26:32] enemy so all I'm saying now and I'm
[26:34] bringing you the scripture is that
[26:36] there's got to be something deeper in
[26:38] our lives there's got to be a power
[26:41] deeper in our lives just to cast out
[26:44] Devils there's got to be a power that's
[26:46] greater than doing Miracles and I know
[26:49] some preachers would say and I agree
[26:50] with them listen we Miracles listen we
[26:53] should pray Faith to the people we
[26:55] should always believe that God is a
[26:57] miracle working God if we stop believing
[27:00] that then that we limit what God can do
[27:03] can you say Amen but there has to be a
[27:05] life of power that we find in our
[27:07] identity in The Book of Life he said
[27:10] notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that
[27:13] the spirits are subject to you don't
[27:15] worship because Spirits are subject to
[27:17] you but rather worship for this motive
[27:21] because your names are written in the
[27:25] Lamb's Book of Life right so Revelations
[27:29] 5 goes to the book as being the motive
[27:32] of our worship and Jesus Takes those
[27:35] that are worshiping about Devils being
[27:36] cast out and he directs them where to
[27:39] the book that's right because this
[27:42] worship is the most important this
[27:45] rejoicing is the most important he says
[27:48] Rejoice don't Rejoice because Spirits
[27:50] are subject to
[27:52] you if you go that direction then that's
[27:56] that's that's not the way to to go your
[27:58] motive and your rejoicing and your
[28:01] worship motive should be because you've
[28:04] seen your name in the Lamb's Book of
[28:08] Life thank you for watching our message
