========================================

chapter 5 i'm picking up the scripture that i left off with last sunday second corinthians chapter 5. and we'll read together starting at verse 14. for the love of christ constraineth us that means the love of christ controls and compels us how many want to be compelled by the love of christ the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which live should from should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh ye though we know have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more so we don't know christ in the flesh christ is not in his own flesh of 2000 years ago here today we don't know him that way but we know him by revelation we know he's real we know he's a person uh he's just as real the only part that's missing he's not in his flesh he fulfilled those days for a certain time uh i believe it was three and a half years of ministry we had 33 years on earth so we don't know him we never knew christ in that flesh body we will see him someday but we don't know him but we know him by revelation can you say amen but also paul's teaching us that from henceforth we know no man in other words we don't look at one another by the flesh as christians we're not viewing one another by the flesh by but by the seed that's on the inside the christ that's inside someone and you say well i know people they don't have christ but always always the potential is there that they're a seed that's not been dramatized yet so even with an unbeliever we're always praying and looking at them through eyes of christ to say is the potential there you see so and and how many knows that's the way god looked at us it's a good thing some of you in the world some of you out there and i mean you know you're the least likely to receive this and yet you're here today hungry for the word of god somebody looked at you beyond your faults and saw your need and somebody seen that you were seen of god and god was the first one that looked at you that way if god looks at that's us that way then we have to look at one another that way now i want to add in a scripture back in the book of romans just one scripture and uh paul says something here um that adds with the strip the subject this morning and i just want to title this relationships i've been speaking on relationships relationships that look past the flesh relationships that look past the flesh and paul says romans 7 and verse 18. now he's talking about himself for i know paul's talking about himself for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not and so i want you to just remember the first part there this is a prophet how many believe paul was a prophet and the prophet says about himself not the self that's the part of christ but he says i know and this is almost a revelation that you have to have about yourself first and others i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing that's a prophet talking so how much confidence should we put in the flesh if there's no good thing it's nothing we can offer to god it's it's a mess can you say the only hope that the flesh has is that you have the holy ghost controlling the flesh and bringing it under subjection but in it in itself there's no good thing in it even a prophet of god and if he said that about himself then certainly if he was a prophet and there was no good in his flesh there's certainly no good in our flesh whatsoever amen it's only through christ that anything good can come out of us amen father bless your word today as we teach it to the people and you know my prayers today going up before your throne that lord the things that are impossible to change you'd change them through the glory of your word and lord i've i've presented to you also my incapabilities lord and my weakness to help these souls and these people lord if we invite you on the scene today and you break through the every barrier lord you'd come and feel welcome among us as we invite you lord you can do miraculous things through your word thank you for your word thank you gave us our the word the best thing you could have given us lord because when we preach your word and you come and identify yourself with it then your presence comes and begins to do what we can't do so we'll preach it lord but we're asking for you to show up today we're asking you to break through every wall every barrier we're asking father that you would take those things lord that seem impossible to us and you make them possible lord through the word we love you father we're thankful to serve you today bless every family every heart that's here everyone listening i just pray you'll bless them encourage them and strengthen them in the word in jesus name amen god bless you once you shake hands again to guinea and probably had you do that but god bless you this morning as i ended the service last sunday my conclusion coming to that was speaking about the condition that adam and eve were in before the fall just before the fall and i'll just summarize from last sunday to say again that just before the fall adam could not look at eve any other way except as being a part of him when he looked at her he did not see necessarily just the flesh although the flesh was there she was a different vessel but the way he viewed her was to be one with him in other words you are bone of my bone you are flesh of my flesh we're not two separate individuals in the sense of by spirit in spirit we are one and so thus in order to see that he could not stumble or he couldn't look at just the flesh he had to be looking at just that she was one with him and uh and in that she was never a separate entity or treated like a separate entity even though by vessel she was god had separated the masculine and feminine we know that but just before the fall adam was not looking at the flesh he was looking at something deeper and i would like to just today go further unto the into this subject and talk a little bit about how much we look at the flesh because whether we want to admit it or not we still are very much fleshly prone even though that we may be in christ but we're you see in christ we're learning that we cannot judge things by the flesh we cannot look at an individual and make a a judgment or a diagnosis just based upon the flesh if god looks at us that way and if adam looked at his wife that way then we have got to grow out of viewing things and looking at the flesh can you say amen and so i want to go into how much we still look at the flesh and then how that affects relationships because if we're only fleshly driven for example if a husband only looks at a a wife and her weaknesses and he begins to dishonor her and only views her according to the flesh he will become disappointed he will be angry he will be upset if a wife looks at her husband only according to his fleshly ways or just the way that he is she will become disappointed and guess what happens the relationship starts to get broken because you lose honor for what you really are a lot of a lot of times marriages just lose their original romance they lose their original attraction to one another because why for years you look at the flesh and you know the flesh now and the flesh begins to smother out the way that you should look at one another brother brown says that we should as long as we're married we should treat them as a son and daughter of god as a sister in christ as a brother in christ that's the highest honor no matter how much daily life goes on and you have differences and you might have even little uh disagreements we've got to keep honor and respect at how we look at one another that this is a daughter of god and she is to be treated like a daughter of god this is the son of god and he is to be treated like a son of god amen and it goes in churches as well is that if you only look at the flesh of your congregation or your church if you keep viewing things if you look at your pastor only by the flesh then that will be smothering out what his position really is who he is as the son of god a pastor can't help you anymore if you only view him by the flesh a congregation cannot help you anymore if you only look at all the flesh of the people and all their quirks and all their personality differences and all the things that irritate you i know none of that happens with any of you nobody's ever irritated you but things irritate me i'm being honest today but if we take this it applies to relationships because if we're only looking at the flesh it will affect relationships and i'm going to show at the end some examples in jesus showing the contrast in himself because when jesus came of course he was the perfect son of god and he began to be christ the mystery of god revealed he was the the mystery of what god wanted to express through man he was the first time we began to see what god looks like in flesh because we've never seen it in its fullness before jesus was christ with mystery it was the mystery of god revealed we never got to see what god would look like in flesh until jesus came on the scene we finally get to see what does god look like in flesh and when he began that he began a whole kingdom of sons and daughters of god who would be in the flesh who would be in sin born bodies who would be born in sin shaped in iniquity saved filled with the holy ghost and then with the holy ghost they still live in their flesh in other words they still have the potential to walk in the flesh instead of the spirit and with all of that because of the perfect example of jesus christ he came into viewing and seeing things by by a vision by the righteousness of god in other words jesus was viewing everybody he's seen not through the lens of flesh because there's some people that came to him if he had been looking at the flesh he would have never given them the hope of what god could bring to them but because he was looking beyond the flesh he knew and he could see whether they were a seed of god or not he could see whether they were a god of god nobody else they were looking at the woman at the well nobody else could see she was a daughter of god but because jesus was not looking at the flesh he could look inside and see there's a seedling there this is the daughter of god if jesus did that then we have to do it as well i'm talking about relationships i'm talking about growing into christ's likeness and how we view things so at the end if i get to it and i want to i want to show a contrast between how jesus was seeing things and how the pharisees were viewing things because the most religious people on the face of the earth viewed everything according to the flesh and when somebody didn't line up their only answer was is that if they need to line up with a with the law they need to line up with the law they need to lie because they were all about appearance they were all about flesh this person's flesh is the meth and their only hope is to get under our religion and line up with all the do's and don'ts and then we'll be happy then they'll be right they had no vision for the righteousness of god they had no vision for the seed of god they're the daughters of god that this did not come by a law but it came by the spirit of life coming in an individual and changing their lives transforming their lives so let's not put it on the pharisees let's say how much do us sometimes look religiously like the pharisees and view everything according to how we see in the flesh i'm believing that this series would help build stronger marriages build stronger church build stronger relationship with with children and parents that's my prayer in this series because once we understand god's oneness and god's glory coming in us we'll never view things the same we're looking for god's glory in the next individual praise the lord so now i want to get into those things but we were looking at before the fall and i just would like to just take first because i read the quotes last week but i want to go into another quote let's just take a quick look at how god viewed eve before the fall and i particularly mentioned eve because we know that he created man a spirit man he was created in the image of god so he was a spirit man first before he was a flesh man and i keep repeating these things because i want everybody understand include including the children when god created a man he says i created him in my own image and so god was a spirit so the first man adam adam created was not a body like you see it was a spirit man like god then the next thing in genesis 2 then he takes that he breathes life into a vessel and adam had a had a body now so he took that and he put it in there and so then in that body was both masculine and feminine eve was inside of him so then after and later on in the chapter god takes the next step and listen now when he takes eve out of from the rib of adam performs surgery on him and takes him out and adam wakes up and last sunday i elaborated on the first words he said to her and the first time he's seen eve and all that i won't get into that but when he takes her out and he wakes up and he sees eve in front of him bone oh my bone flesh of my bless now we have and this is the way the prophet described it she was not in the original creation as far as this vessel she was in the original creation by spirit she was in adam but now we have a byproduct off of adam made from adam with a different vessel and he puts that feminist part in that different vessel which means that she would be different she would think about things different she would look at life a bit different yet even though she's different there'd still be one so there had to be honor and respect and that respect and that's what adam had so now when he brings that vessel out i want to read a quote here in masterpiece because the way god viewed them in just before the fall god viewed when he looked at adam and eve there in two different vessels we know that when he created adam he created his masterpiece he created the animals he brought all these things on the earth of the world but when he got to adam was god's masterpiece adam was the ultimate adam was the apex adam was everything it was god's masterpiece and he looked at him but look at in this quote when the two separate vessels were there and now to make the two one he put them like any other great sculptor he put them in a place that's beautiful a sculpture wouldn't make a great great masterpiece and then take it and set it in an alley somewhere or hide it behind buildings as our lord told us a man doesn't light a candle and put it under a bushel when we become god's masterpieces we're not hid in an alley somewhere we must give light so we see that after that i love that don't you is that when god had a masterpiece it was so special to him he placed it in a beautiful atmosphere of a garden of eden god didn't place it in an alley can you say amen isn't it wonderful that when we come to the lord and god begins to mold our lives and god looks at the masterpiece he's building in our lives he doesn't want us in some dirty atmosphere he puts us in the very presence of the lord he puts us in good atmospheres at church he puts us in good atmospheres at home that's why the music you play at home and the atmosphere you create at home is ever so important how you grow in the lord because if you believe you're a masterpiece of god and you're a handiwork of god you god wants to put you in the right atmospheres as well so he says there now i want you to notice so we see that he after he had made this masterpiece he placed it up here on the earth and put it in the most beautiful place it was in the garden of eden he placed his masterpiece the two being one so god's looking at two but he is still seeing it as his masterpiece you see what are you trying to say well i'll tell you here in a minute he put he said he placed his masterpiece the two now we would think well it's just a few scriptures before that god's looking at the masterpiece adam no no he's looking at both vessels separate now and he's still viewing it as his masterpiece even though eve is a byproduct say why are you preaching this brother ball because i'm looking at how god sees us because brother brahm said we're a by-product like eve was we're a byproduct we're born in sin shaped in iniquity can you say amen we are we're not we're we're not what we originally should have been so now we're a byproduct but when god looked at adam and eve in two separate vessels he's still before the fall he's still seen them as the masterpiece that he had created even though she's a byproduct now so let me finish the quote he says now how how it must have pleased him that he saw this masterpiece as well he after that we find out that he rested he was so pleased with his work so he's referring to just before the fall which is what i've been preaching on not adam is one vessel with masculine and feminine but two vessels separated two vessels and god is still looking at it as his masterpiece i want you to notice even now before the fall he's looking at it and now i want to take it further to say even after the fall because the prophet taught us that when the masterpiece was marred and they fell in the garden of eden and he began to restore them from that point on he began to do the work of redemption god even looked and he refers to michelangelo doing the statue of moses and one day michelangelo i'm just telling this for those who don't know one day michelangelo is creating that that that statue of moses and one day it just becomes so perfect and so real to him and he just strikes it with one of his tools he said speak he was so inspired that it was so real he strikes it and then there was a flaw in the masterpiece and brother bradham taught us later that it was the flaw in the masterpiece that actually made it a masterpiece now we don't think that way we think if there's a flaw we're looking at the flesh but even with the flaw and that's when he brought christ christ was god's masterpiece he was perfect but then at calvary it was like michelangelo took that that spirit the soldier took the spear and pierced him and he made a fall and water and blood came out and now the masterpiece is flawed can you say man but that which came out of him actually made it the masterpiece to make up a bride so god calls his bride masterpiece it doesn't matter that she's a byproduct she's received the spirit of god and god says that's actually what makes her the masterpiece what are you saying redemption is powerful enough to take someone from the miry clay it's actually more powerful to take somebody that's flawed and born in sin shaped in iniquity and raised them up and that flaw that flaw god raises it to redemption and he says when i look at her i look past the flaw and i see a masterpiece [Applause] that's great to talk about that about christ and his bride but what about relationships if god were to keep looking at flaws then it doesn't look like much a masterpiece does it hard to conclude that this is a masterpiece and so he looked at it that way before the fall and i want you to notice something about uh eve when god looked at eve in that different vessel before the fall being a byproduct she had within her the potential to leave the word she had within her the weakness which we know now she did she left the word she fell and left the word and that's how every all of humanity fell but when god looked at her he knew even that she had something within her that could leave the word that could make a mistake and god still would not look at that part in this quote he's looking at her with adam one with adam this is still my masterpiece now he must look at that because i've always said that we might be critical of other people and critical of the shooter this week that showed that shot the 18 19 children just evil minds and i could say a lot about that i've been very angry at that because we never hear in the news ever what the kid fed on for the last 18 years i can almost guarantee what he fed on it's tragic it's absolutely tragic because they have no intent now just murdering but see we could take someone like that it's how is a person capable of doing that how in the world could they come to such a spot to take a gun and just mow down children like that in a school and we think the most evil thing in the world but i want to let you know all of you holy people without christ you're capable of the same thing i'm offended at that well that's your problem too is you got pride paul said in my flesh dwelleth no good thing and the flesh without the holy ghost is capable of any thing so maybe you haven't murdered somebody physically like this boy but without the new birth you're capable of doing anything in your flesh capable of taking drugs capable of being coming addicted to things this is the addictive generation addicted to everything can you say man you're capable of all that that's why we have millions falling to addiction they don't have christ they go for an alternative i got to get some relief so i'm going to take drugs to get high and feel a relief everybody's turned into alternatives because this generation is just about completely dead and gone insane because it's without the lord without any hope can you say amen without without anything substance of them to change them thank god for christ today thank god that we have a token thank god that we have the power of the cross to change our lives and offer it to someone else without it there is no hope that's what the world needs i just make one more comment i am so sick of every time we have a shooting all the political debate and the democrats say we need to get rid of guns but the republicans say it's mental health we need to deal with and all of them it's always the same answer and first of all nobody talks about the demons on somebody because the world has no concept of spirit so they're not going to call it a demon which it is it's demon possession and they have no holy spirit to cast it out but at the very least at the very least could you please come to the conclusion that it's not just the mental health issue but it's what they fed on their whole life and what you feed on you actually become and you live out if you're on the video games blasting cop killer and blasting people that you don't even know on the screen and blasting everybody people then you're going to become numb and you're going to take the spirit that you can walk into a school and kill people that you don't know it's the what you fed on can you say man never never come never talk about the conclusions that we need to make i heard one politician say we're in moral failure in this country and we have spirits that are taking over i said wow can you that's a spirit wow somebody calls it a spirit and we have a moral failure in our country we have a moral crisis you're not going to hear very much of that when you hear it you ought to say amen we're not going to bring back this world it's headed for tribulation but here in our little group and little places around the world we have the access to the holy ghost how many believe we still have access to the cross to the power of cross we better be crying out to god for our children we better be crying to god for deliverance in our whole life we better be crying out for a personal revival in our lives how many you say i commit myself to a personal revival in my own life we need god more than we've ever needed before the masterpiece became flawed and even with that even after the fall when god started to you know what even after the fall and men fell and they lost their glory of god and they lost their fellowship then god god began to build a nation with abraham and when he began to build a nation with abraham he began to look at them as their potential because remember i said you have the potential without the new birth of doing the worst capable things oh there's a good person there's a good people praise the lord you know i thank god for good people but without the new birth all the good that they do they have resident within their flesh the potential to do the most dastardly things dastardly is that a word i don't know they have and you have that this morning you have it within you and you know what i think killing somebody's influence is worse than killing somebody physically it's the same spirit but you'll do it because without something to bring that in control you go down all those directions but when he began to build a nation in abraham he began to look at them now here's here's we see you have the potential for evil but when you when god looks at you he begins to see the potential by his grace and he begin to see the potential of his people and when he seen the flaws he still called it a masterpiece in the beginning the flaw made it the masterpiece because the redemption power of god is stronger than the flaw let me say it again why does god look at us he can see who we are in our potential and god can look past the fall because he knows the power of redemption will always be greater than the flaw and god's prophets even seemed indifferent look at here brother i was talking about pharaoh if you look at this next quote this is how pharaoh viewed the israelites in egypt now we find out moses when he fought later how he built he saw israel moses the great prophet he looked out the windows and then then he'll be referring to pharaoh here but pharaoh he was raised in pharaoh moses was raised in pharaoh's courts and he looked out the window pharaoh looked out the window when pharaoh looked out the window at god's people he saw a bunch of mud daubers that's nothing but a bunch of half-dressed people with lashes of whips upon their back no way at all for to be ever ever to be delivered that's when you're looking at the flesh this is god's people and they look like that a bunch of slaves in bondage this is when when pharaoh looked out his window he's seen he's seen a bunch of mud dabbers or slay that's all he seen now we found out moses we found out later he built he saw israel going on to the next quote if you would but moses knew the word of god and he looked upon them he looked out the same window brother brandon says he looked out the same window and he looked upon them as a promised people he looked upon them as a people that had a promise no matter how much the world that day looked down upon them as a bunch of mud daubers or slaves he looked upon them as a people having a promise pharaoh looked upon them out of the same window but he's seen slaves moses seen the victory why he had focused himself though being a prince though heir to the throne of egypt he focused himself away from the lust of the world he focused himself away from the beauty and the power that he had within his own potentials to receive he focused that out until he seen a blessed people yonder by the promise of god he focused in because he know that god promised abraham that he would visit his people if you'd have been looking at the flesh like pharaoh was these people were nothing these people had no potential but when you're looking through god's eyes you look past the flesh and see them as a people of promise they weren't even delivered yet but the way moses god's prophet looked at the people he seen them by grace and said they no matter how much enslaver they are no matter how much downtrodden they are no much no no matter how much in the flesh they are they're holding a promise i'm glad god looked at me that way one day whatever he's seen in flesh he had to look past it and say but that boy is a he's holding a promise literal life no matter how much you view them a certain way there are people of promise and through the throughout the bible balaam tried to curse israel because balak and balaam were looking at their hinder parts i'm recording the bible were viewing this group of people these are just a bunch of people that's messed up and i don't like and going on and on and when god and the prophet looked at them balaam try balak tried to say i'm looking at their hindu parts and they've got some problems they've got some weaknesses they've got some things going on internally in the camp that isn't right they judged them for their hinder parts and then because balak seemed that they tried to get the prophet hired a prophet to curse them curse this people cursed them and he couldn't curse them you can't curse what god has blessed despite their weaknesses despite what they look like despite their hinder parts they were the people of god oh i ought to get a bigger amen than that despite their weaknesses despite what flesh you see despite all the things they're still the people of almighty god and there are people holding a promise i'm preaching to a people today that's holding a promise of a rapture and you may say i never see them going in the rapture all i see is flesh well because you're looking at the flesh and not the promise i'm preaching to a people that hold a promise of a rapture i'm preaching to a people that hold the promise of adoption and sons of god are going to come to adoption despite what the devil says blessed be the name of the lord i love that i love it pharaoh looks out the window and sees mud daubers maybe you look out your window and you look at this church and view it a certain way but i can tell you god views it in a different way praise the lord quiet today but when you're talking about relationships and you get down to the nitty-gritty sometimes you're not going to have a shouting dancing service we have those we have them sometimes but you see i don't think that we should always want to have a shouting dancing service and say we haven't had church till we have that i don't believe that god speaks in different ways sometimes you just need to be taught a little bit sometimes you just need to sit at jesus feet and just learn of him bible says learn of me jesus said learn of me for i am meek and lowly praise the lord i need that respectfully i want it all i want the blessings i want to shout i want to dance i'm not afraid of the gifts of the spirit we had a healing line because god directed it three weeks ago and friends i don't have the time we'll do it at communion next month but we're going to go through the the the so many people that were miraculously healed through that healing line that we called we believe in the power of god around here we believe in this change he still heals physically can you say amen but i'm here as a pastor to tell you we we may not have that every service but other healing will take place healing of the spirit healing of the motions mental healing can you say man people that don't have a sound mind god can come down and give them a sound mind again that they're thinking properly don't limit god to just certain things can you say amen let god be god let him do what he wants to do we might not always have an altar call but may the same jehovah god come on the scene and do his work praise the lord god looked at the people different than what pharaoh saw them moses looked at the people he didn't look at the flesh can i correct something right here i'm going to go ahead and do it anyway you better be careful what you say about god's people yep i'm gonna go ahead you better watch your tongue at home and on the phone and be careful what you say about god's people and that correction is for me for you or for anybody lately i've i've heard this for years but they i heard it recently someone on the phone with me it's the message people that i have issues with not the unbelievers i can get along with them and i'm going wow not the unbelievers i'm just thinking you're lumping a whole lot of folks in with the three people that hurt you in the message and i think that's a very dangerous thing to do i know for me i don't like to be lumped in and categorized or put in a category because i might preach a certain way i hate to be lumped in with a certain category preachers preach against things and say no if i say something and lean a certain way then they quickly put me in a care i don't like that you don't like that and i think we should be careful when three or four people have hurt you that you don't judge the whole congregation by it and the whole message by it you're lumping a whole lot of good holy ghost-filled people in with your hurt the pharisees who judged you and that's a lot of times what it is because we have pharisees in the message i'm getting in trouble right now you don't think we have pharisees in the message who are all about religion and made this message of religion we have pharisees i've dealt with them for 30 40 years we have pharisees in the message we have sarah's sadducees the pharisees are fair you see and the sadducees are sad you see trying to simplify it for the kids but we have them and they're more about religion they're more about the dress code than they are about the power of god there are more about appearance in my mentioning is this what jesus said about the pharisees they're more about appearance than they are the power of god they're more about putting on righteousness on the outside than the righteousness of god we have them in the message and they have made the message a code they made the message something other than the righteous of god righteousness of god all i want to say about it we've had that for years all i want to say and you can get offended all you want to but i'm going to tell the truth and that is it is not fair to take the pharisees in this message who maybe have hurt you and criticize you and judge the whole message by it and everybody in the whole message by it and the message itself because we do have people now who have exited the message based upon those things and i think that's a real serious thing to blanket the whole thing and all of god's restored truth and everything god has done through this prophet and is doing now through this ministry of the last days i think it's a it's immature it's juvenile to lump the whole message and the whole crowd into a few pharisees there's pharisees in every group but it's not the whole group can you say amen somebody didn't teach you that people can be fleshly in any church whether it's denomination or here people can live in the flesh and be very fleshly and very carnal even paul said that the corinthians ye are carnal and they were a message church yeah the corinthians were a message church but they were just immature and he says you're carnal you're his big he never talked to the ephesians that way but this church is a book of correction i've got to correct you on this i got a question and one of the things is you're babies you're acting as babes you're choosing favorite preachers you're choosing the elite preachers the supreme preachers the supreme ministries in this message and i'm a paul i'm of ces i'm i'm cephas i'm as this i'm that and so all this immaturity going on and he said you're just being carnal you're being fleshly and i'm gonna stay preaching to you and to grow out of your immaturity and grow as sons and quit judging the people of god by the flesh can i get an amen this morning quit judging the people of god by the flesh but somebody didn't teach you that people can be fleshly in any church that's why people some of them when they leave and they experience about five ten years of going out to other other churches besides the message they begin to discover people can be fleshly out there too they've got pharisees too they've got imbalanced people too and then they go to walmart and they get into it with somebody and they realize wow there's people who walk in the flesh even at walmart and you just you just exited the message and it's the message people are all these other things and then you walk in and you realize people are people everywhere when they get in the flesh but we're not judging by the flesh we're looking for the pillar of fire we're looking for the joy in the camp we're looking for the is the holy spirit moving and i say if the holy spirit is doing his work in his people we should be careful what we say about the people of the lord balaam got in a lot of trouble by trying to curse israel a person that just complains and says it's these message people i can't take care of i just can't handle and i'm just gonna say respectfully many times a person like that is is looking for a reason to leave they're looking for a reason to exit the message and they're looking for excuses and they're looking for something so fleshly that they can feel good about exiting i've got something now but you'll never take that to the judgment day it'll never be a good enough excuse because you set aside the people you set aside the flesh and you'll have the word through the messenger that you will face because god will judge this world by one standard and that's his word not by denominations not by the sign on the door whether it's a message sign or whether it's a baptist sign god will not judge it by any church even message church he'll judge it by the word not by denomination it's not the whole group you can have it fleshly people at walmart you can be with fleshly people as you click on facebook i just feel that if a person is isolating just message people and not as critical about everybody else they're looking for an excuse to go they got to have a reason to exit why be miserable if you're not happy why be miserable people already decided in their hearts years ago to exit and just looking for a reason to go i had a man one time years ago probably 30 years ago and he started to bring his wife to church he was a believer he believed that the message of christ for the last days but his wife didn't and they were they're already married she had grown up pentecostal girl and so he wanting to come to the church that was preaching the message of the last days he brought her to our church and kept bringing her and i began to notice she didn't want to be there and he was dragging her to come you know this was the truth of the last day she was coming but she didn't want to be there she hated it she hated to hear the name william branham she hated every time i said it she got resentful you could tell it by her body language and after a few months i went to him and i said brother i said why are you doing this to her not everybody is called to the same thing why why are you forcing this on her i said well it's the truth it's the truth of the last days but you have to respect her and where she's at i said she grew up and he called so here's what you need to do you need to go take her to a place and you could come here sunday morning take her to a church that she grew up in maybe some type of church a pentecostal church take her sunday night and you guys could go there and then go that's what i suggested it might be uncouth it may be different than what you suggested but i just said why do you want to make a person miserable why do you want to sit in the church and make a person miserable don't you understand that that as i was saying last sunday god has a change in his pocket some are quarters some are civil dollars some are pennies but they're all of value they're all in god's hands some people just aren't called and so why do they continue being miserable and you see and so i said take her and you know he did it and she was happy as a little lark matter of fact when she'd come to our services she was happier because she had something that was ministering to her how could that be ministering to her it's not up to me to decide what god's going to use to minister somebody brother paul used somebody to send somebody back to the nominees i wasn't sending her to a denomination i was teaching a husband to be respectful that you don't force this on anybody why do you want to sit there and be miserable and have her miserable she was happy as a little lark and she didn't have to hear the name william branham or a preacher preaching on her dress or whatever was happening she didn't have to hear that she was she was just in a place and she could grow in the lord at her level there praise the lord i get myself in trouble every sunday now why aren't you happy are you going to support a church and support the holy spirit moving in that church then you ought to be happy going to that church you're going to give us your tithes and your offerings you ought to be supportive not only in your tithes and offerings but you support it and you're happy and you're growing in the lord if you're not growing in the lord please find the place that you'll grow in the lord it's all about all of us growing in the lord and one thing don't judge god's people according to the flesh judge it by his righteousness and what he's doing in the work of the lord to transform lives i haven't given that advice to 10 people that i gave to that man so just know that i'm not you know i just felt it was a unique situation that why why does she have to sit and be miserable somebody bring their drag their husbands along get them injured why he doesn't like being in church he doesn't like me or he doesn't like something why oh he needs to get to he yeah i know he needs a lot but he needs the lord because obviously he don't have a value yet when he gets a value and christ comes deeper in his life he'll get a value to come to church it comes with the territory how many who love to come to church would raise your hand and say i don't do this just so brother paul don't preach on me i am here because i love the lord i'm here today because i love being here this is me now i'm not speaking for you i love being here more than anywhere else and i don't have to be preaching i just want to see the glory of god i just want to raise my hands and sing i just want to start the week right i'm here because i love being here i really mean that this is my life this is my obsession there isn't any business opportunity that gives me a thrill like it does being in the house of god somebody being healed somebody being changed somebody crying and weeping in the presence of god that's what i love to see you know we're making a few business decisions doing other things and you know this that and the other and it's just like okay all right all right yes i see the opportunity we're doing it that's fine but you know what it's all a sideshow it's all gonna burn someday no no this is my passion the word the presence of god and i can say that sometimes coming to church with you people who are in the flesh some of you i can still love coming to church because if i'm preaching i'm going to preach you out of the flesh if i can but some of you come sometimes and some times i come disgruntled wednesday night i was as tired as a i was dog-tired only took me about 10 minutes and i just revived and said this feels good brother daniel's preaching my tiredness is smothered out amen i think it should be a passion and if it's not a passion find something that you're growing by that the lord is a passion to you i think that we should enjoy the church that we attend can you say mom i think we should enjoy it see paul you preach that way some people might leave listen i want you to be happy i want you to support the ministry that you're under and a confidence not in my flesh nothing good in my flesh confidence in the gift that's feeding you and the brothers you're feeling the ministry i'd be here i want you to have confidence in that and if you don't say brother paul you're you're making your church you might be making your church smaller i'm not about numbers if you don't know that i'm not about numbers sometimes it can go up and down that's that's fine i want to i want to love the lord i want to see people changed but i certainly want to see people who are happy and excited and passionate about gathering together is that okay now there's something i read last sunday and um there's no way that we can have oneness true oneness if we view each other according to the flesh we'll never come to it and i said something last sunday that we're all so used to looking at people by the flesh we've had six thousand years of only seeing the flesh and we're actually taught to view and judge a person by what we see we actually bestow honor in the wrong places and we lift up the rich ones we lift up the highly gifted ones the highly gifted people get more praise become our become celebrities it's just how we're taught you know there's there's people that get more honor and the people that don't have the greatest gifts and they don't have a lot of money or they don't they're not successful in in what the world sees we tend to okay they're okay but these are the real people that get more of our honor that's a shame because paul taught us in the body of christ in in your bible he taught in the body of christ he said the ones that seem least likely the lesser ones the parts of the body that are not seen and don't have that great of a function he said but they're essential to the body that's how the body of christ function but the world has taught us we lift up the wrong ones we certain ones superstars movie stars and and then we put down others and this run writer a christian writer colin smith he was talking about this scripture second corinthians 5 what does it mean to regard someone according to the flesh from here from from now on regard no one according to the flesh and uh it's he says he quotes from first samuel man looks at the outward appearance but god looks at the heart it is natural for us to form impressions from the most obvious things about other people and so then he he mentioned some things here that i'm just going to use the 10 things this is how we judge according to flesh number one we judge by appearance how many would say that's true we we have been taught to judge people by their appearance and that can go from uh you know uh just are they ugly are they good looking um are they wearing the right clothes are they not wearing the right clothes it can be i don't want to spend a lot of time with this because you know we but we judge we categorize we put someone in a place based upon their appearance and that's judging according to the flesh and we do that as human beings and and sometimes we do it and you know are they are there a certain height are they a certain weight we've judged for years people that are that are how should i say it overweight or rotund huh obese is it i'm recalling brother dana when you were young and my dad was preaching and he was looking for the word a polite word to say a person was overweight and he was looking for obese and you yelled out rotund you remember that my dad always told that story and my dad said no i don't think that's the word i'm looking for rotund but uh we judge the weight you know and and i'm always working on that you know and and i found those uh i found those um oreo cookies but they're thins are you shaking your head for bread just kidding so it's about appearance number two we judge according to ability gifts talents abilities that each of us has we're gifted in different ways uh in sports in arts in music and so we live in a world that's just how good are they in this how much have they excelled in this and i think all of us should excel in our different things that god has given us and gifts but i think we should do it to the glory of god our musicians are always probing to get better and better but it's not to show off it's the bible says to play skillfully upon the instruments so take your gift and make something more there was a young boy that drew some art and for brother for brother branham and he says i'd love to have the money to send that boy to college to further his gift so he's always encouraging you got a gift but make it better for the glory of god but but we can't judge a person's soul or who they are by their gift that's all flesh so whether they were highly gifted or they didn't they didn't they didn't have a great gift and no we don't judge them by that we we're looking through the eyes of christ we judge people according to age paul says to timothy let no man despise your youth so we look down on the ones that are younger sometimes and all that and then we look at down on the older the our generation actually looks down on the gray-haired older people and won't take wisdom from them i think that's a shame i think the bible teaches otherwise that the young people should be hanging around the older people to get some of their wisdom i think young mothers should ask the mothers who raised your children how can you help me i've got this child that's doing this have you been through this and you'll find mothers in the church yeah i've been through that been there done that got the t-shirt but the young mothers are too proud to ask the older ones and i think that's sad there's a lot of wisdom there but we live in a young generation that we don't need the older ones we just we're going to do our own thing i think that's not scriptural but we judge people according to their age where they're at you know they're they're less if they're older and they have that gray hair the bible speaks different we judge people based upon the friends that they keep the associates that they keep we judge people based upon race how many know we judge people according to their rates we we have had distinctions in that and divisions that have come it was in the bible between jews and gentiles they're judging according to race and different things we judge people according to gender god has made us male and female and he distinguishes the difference in male and female but we tend to judge things and and i got into some things about how sometimes we're lacking in our groups in looking down and belittling the woman as some lesser creature and i got some response from it because it's not talked about a lot i know she's the weaker vessel but paul said to the husbands to honor her as the weaker vessel and she's the weaker vessel and vessel but she's co-heirs together with you in christ he said you better he said paul said you better treat her right as a daughter of god and don't disrespect her because she's a weaker vessel you better honor her or your prayers will be hindered so once again you're not looking at the flesh she's a weaker vessel she's a nobody i don't even want her input that's not that's not i don't care if that comes from a message thing whatever that is not the word of god she's not a doormat we judge people according to their work what's their work what's education what's their business what's their health we look down on them if they don't have an education what's that what are they doing their work are they successful in their work we judge people according to their home the the people the car that they drive the vacations that they go to the restaurants they frequent we judge people according to that the communities they're a part of we judge people according to their family and of origin where they come from did they have a popular family do they have a family that's not popular and all these things and then he says we judge people by experience our experiences shaped us not only by genes but also the environment and so we come as a product of our environment that we grew up in whether it was in the message or not we come as a product of our environment and we come as a product of the genes that are in us from our former history brother bram talked about it the only thing that crests the bad part of our history you might have a line of alcoholics you might have a line of someone that's given to depression only thing that corrects it is the lord's power from calvary can you say amen how many can raise your hand and say that god has broken the cycle of a family history through the power of the cross you're sitting here today he broke the cycle amen sometimes it takes years but god says i have power i can break that cycle and your future is going to be much better than your past amen but we judge people according to their families and are they this and are they that and we judge all these things and i could reflect on this but he goes into another part he says christ changes how you see others and i agree with them it's christ that changes how you view others and we don't view according to the flesh but something much much deeper and then the real revelation comes as we see how christ sees us because when we see how christ sees us then we can look at others if you judge yourself according to the flesh either you will always be looking down on others because you see yourself as having more going for you than they do or you will always be losing heart because others have more gifts and more talents and more advantages and more opportunities than you i'm going to read that again if you judge yourself according to the flesh or others either you will always be looking down on others because you see yourself as having more going for you it's pride or if you're living the flesh you will always be losing heart because others have more gifts and more talents and more advantages and more opportunities than you here's the good news christ does not regard you according to the flesh and he ends it by saying and i am in harmony with what he says here when jesus christ is your sovereign lord what he thinks of you is first and ultimately the only thing that really matters i believe that when jesus becomes lord what he thinks of you is first i talk to some young girls lately about confidence in god and confidence in themselves as a daughter of god rough situations where they have been belittled by parents and then they've been with men and different things and it all starts because they didn't get the honor as a young girl and they view themselves so belittled and i said you may never have a daddy come to you and give you that affirmation but i can tell you you have a big a big father and you stay in this word he's going to give you the confidence that you have lacked and that you are fearfully and wonderfully made in the image of god [Applause] what he thinks of you god is ultimate ultimately because you may never get enough likes on the internet those of you who are striving to get that crossover point of having 100 likes you may never get it you might get more dislikes i know if i had a facebook i would have so many dislikes i would be blocked constantly and i would start out with 300 000 followers and then it would just keep whittling down to nothing and i would have to have my confidence in the lord or i would crash and be there on the couch with a whole gallon of ice cream i would good thing my confidence is in the lord and that's what he's saying here he's saying that when he's yourself lord what he thinks of you is first can you say amen and the only thing that really matters a change in how you see jesus will lead to a change in how you see others and a change in how you see yourself so that you will not lose heart the book of redemption has been opened to the bride of jesus christ brother brahm said he is the book and she is the words in the book hallelujah and when we see inside that and begin to look at it we are no longer looking at the flesh at all we're seeing christ the mystery of god revealed and its influence from that book of life that's open should be re-teaching us how we view people and it'll be more powerful than anything that we've ever learned in our life to view people according to the flesh when you get your eyes in that book of life in this word there's a powerful vision that comes that you'll never see yourself never see others like you've seen them before you'll get honor you'll get respect you'll be looking for the seed in somebody you'll be looking for the christ in somebody you look beyond the flesh can you say man you view your husband different you view your wife different i got this guy going to straighten him out all the time and man he's just you better just be careful and start looking for that part of christ that honor the more honor you give for that man you say well i don't even have a i have an unsaved husband i i have a i have a tyrant or i have whatever you disrespect and you honor and watch god begin to do the work might take years but you just you got to maintain that level of respect and certainly don't become like him don't become like him that's where you draw the line don't become like her if she's a tyrant if she's got a temper problem and it's from something she hasn't brought to the lord don't judge her according to the flesh be loving be kind draw her out of it pray for her but don't ever disrespect her keep an honor and respect and don't become like her because if you have two tempers going it's going to be bad now i don't have time to go to jesus example i'll go there next sunday if i'm preaching next sunday i think i am jesus says two places though i'm just mentioning it and we'll close i'm doing good it's only 20 to 1. jesus said and both times he's speaking to the pharisees okay religious people he says ye judge according to appearance but god judges according to the heart so he's talking about judging people and he was saying don't judge by the flesh don't and then another place is it he said to the phrase you judge by the flesh but he says i don't judge men jesus actually said he says i don't judge men by the way that you judge them and that incident he said that was just a few scriptures after the woman was taken in adultery and brought by the pharisees straight up and says we found her in the very act and she's a mess and the law says the law says we stone her putting the test to jesus and i've preached this the only difference is that jesus is viewing the bigger picture of who this woman really is and if you were to judge her they had every right even by the law of the word what to do with this woman but even with the law they were judging everything by flesh and what they seen and you can't do that jesus said you're judging by just the flesh he said i don't judge any man we must get a revelation of who this person is and because it was jesus he knew who she was you know what he did he went there and began to write in the ground and whatever he wrote in the ground all of a sudden they become convicted and all of a sudden they're judging you people you ones that judge too much to the flesh and just write everybody off and just remember god has a way of correcting you when you're so critical of other people i find with critical people sometimes the very thing that they're so critical of other people they're doing themselves and they're requiring all this of somebody else and yet they're doing it themselves if you judge according to the flesh then god's going to find something in your life that's humbling to say i need to humble myself because i've been guilty of this you see so he wrote down things in the ground and they must have been convicted and they all backed off and began to drop their stones and and begin to exit and begin to walk away because they were convicted and the bible says he's she's left alone with jesus she's left alone with jesus it's just the two of them and he said where are your accusers and she says i don't have any more he said then i don't accuse you go and sin no more now wait a minute he had the law there but you see the law viewed only through flesh will get you in trouble god never meant for the law and the things god gave us in the law and the principles to live by and the dress and all of that he never wanted pharisees to make it into something that that's how we judge people and if we can get them just dressed right we'll feel better jesus said you're all about appearance and not about the heart if we could just get them down the other situation is where he said jesus said you you hate me and you want to kill me and they said oh that's not true yeah i just till i just went by the pool of bethesda a few days ago and you all wanted to kill me and guess guess why i remember brother daniel i'm closing i remember brother daniel wednesday night if you were here if you heard it online it was so wonderful because he's talking about the blind man and the pharisees were trying to get out of him do you believe this prophet do you believe this prophet and that was the important point is that if you believe them you know and they were getting ready to write them off do your parents believe in this prophet jesus do you believe in it and the subject was more about do you believe the prophet or not than his healing i loved it when brother daniel and the man answer says you know what i don't even know this man i don't even know who it was he met him later i guess he said i don't i don't even know who he is or who his ministry is all i know is i was blind for 30 years and i can see and pharisees looking at the flesh want to make it about was it done right you know what they criticized and the man healed the pool of bethesda they overlooked the healing and he says he healed him on the sabbath day and he told him to pick up his bed and started to walk he's working on the sabbath day can you imagine men so fleshly that they completely miss a man's healing who was sick for 38 years jesus walks in and says do you want to be healed he said he said pick up your bed and he walked away and the pharisees woke up and said but he did it on the sabbath day he worked he picked up his bed on the sabbath day and the guy said yeah because the same man who told me i'm healed is the same man who told me to pick up my bed i think i'm going to pick up my bed because he healed me and so i'm going to obey him as far as picking up my bed whether i violated the law or not hey guys hello i'm healed after 38 years how blind can people be by the flesh that they miss the moving of god in the congregation over stupid critical things of how people are treating them the glory of god is among us and despite my flesh and despite your flesh he says if we'll keep yielding to the lord god's glory will be shown in the congregation and that's what i'm here for it's not about your flesh not about my flesh it's not about william branham's flesh it's not about william branham's flesh can you say man we have movements in the message that are promoting him and make him as if he's still alive and all this other friends no no no no no it's not about william branham it's about our the person of the lord jesus christ becoming real to us i mean that with no respect to the prophet i'm not exiting anything i feed on this message more than anything else i love it that's why i don't like to be criticized to say he preaches this and he preaches that and he don't preach the message what do you mean i've been preaching this message and quoting it for 33 years now i believe it with all my heart but the flesh of william branham and and his position and all that he introduced me to a further relationship with jesus christ so like john said i must decrease but christ must increase i'm wondering if that needs to happen in the message because they're looking at the flesh of william branham and the flesh of the people and the flesh of the preachers maybe it's all the flesh must decrease and he must increase in my eyes stop looking and criticizing the flesh say god give me a revelation to see even the person at walmart that i begin to talk with could there be something in them that would respond to truth amen you've been such a good audience that's why i keep preaching because even after an hour and a half you're still mostly still receptive some of you are on a clock and you got to go but that's all right that's all right i love you too i love all of you okay please keep coming if you want to keep coming i'll i'll preach better i'll get better at this i promise you i love you more i do everything i can i'm going to tell you the truth but i love each of you and i appreciate you coming and the reason i can go on a hard half if you weren't saying amen and have a heart that's saying i really want to grow in the lord it would be difficult to go this long so i'm actually blaming you for preaching an hour and a half let's stand and rejoice hallelujah let's give him praise [Applause] amen give him praise [Applause] rejoice look what the lord has done oh he drove away the darkness at the rising of the sun rejoice rejoice look where he's brought us from just stop and think about it what the lord has done rejoice for rejoice look what the lord has done he drove away the darkness at the rising of the sun rejoice rejoice look where he's gonna [Music] stop and think about it what the lord has
