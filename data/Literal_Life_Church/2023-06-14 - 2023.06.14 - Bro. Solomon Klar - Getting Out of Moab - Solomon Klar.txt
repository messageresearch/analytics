========================================
[Music] amen God bless you tonight welcome to the service we're so thankful to be here this evening with you to speak with you and just deliver something from the Lord this evening or say thank you brother Paul for having me to speak this evening God richly bless you we're going to turn in our scriptures to tonight to Exodus the third chapter and we're going to read verse 16 and 17 together amen Exodus 3 16. go got go and gather the Elders of Israel together and say unto them the Lord God of your fathers the god of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob appeared unto me saying I have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in Egypt verse 17 says and I have said I will bring you up out of the afflictions of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the hivites and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful for this word Lord that we could read together Lord we thank you that it speaks to our hearts tonight father and we ask you to open it up into our hearts Lord that we could Minister this evening Lord Words of Life words of Peace Lord words of healing from this scripture Lord that it would be embedded into our hearts Lord take me aside tonight Lord let it be my mouthpiece only that's speaking for you father O Lord that I'd be a blessing to these people of yours we pray we love you and we thank you for this gathering tonight in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen you may take your seats tonight so we read here in the in the book of Exodus Israel was previously in bondage we understand that from the context and Moses has gone up up to the mountain to meet the Lord and he's met with the pillar of fire and here's the Lord speaking into him and he's telling him that he's going to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt and deliver them from their enemies and he lists them here in the scripture and so Israel had to find their position with God and it took some time for them to do that Moses brought them a promise when he left the mountain when he had communed with God and he went back into Israel and he found the children the Elders of the people and he went back with them with a promise telling them that they would come out of the of the Egypt and they would go into the Wilderness and soon they would come to a Promised Land which was called Canaan and that promised land was ahead of them as a promise unto what they could look to and so we understand that there there are three stages in our Christian walk to come into salvation we have justification we come through sanctification and then of course we have to be baptized by the Holy Spirit to come into our Arcanine and so Israel as a type of the church we want to look at this tonight and see that the children of Israel were found in the same three stages in Exodus that they had to come through brother Branham says in the adoption series number 11960 if you noticed Israel was brought up out of Egypt and there are three stages of their Journey one stage was leaving Egypt the next stage was the Wilderness and the third stage he said the next stage was Canaan one stage was leaving Egypt which types justification the second one was where they had exitedly Egypt and went into the Wilderness and they're going through a sanctifying process and the third stage was entering Canaan by and and we're going to type that as the Holy Spirit receiving the Holy Spirit so they've come into their promise of their day and they're walking towards their baptism of the Holy Spirit or into their promise which is Canaan land so we're going to look at the three stages this evening together and just see what the Lord could speak to our hearts the first they had to leave Egypt they had to get out of their routines they had to accept the fact that Moses had brought them uh Moses who was a son so to speak of the House of Egypt he had been grown up in in the lands as a as a as an Egyptian in the house of pharaoh and he had they had to come and accept the promise that he was delivering to them from God so they had to come out of it they had to come and leave their Comforts of this land they have so many Comforts in Egypt they were really relaxed they had gotten into routine although the the bondage was hard and the work was hard but they had certain Comfort levels that they maybe didn't even know yet that they that they had that they had lived in this lifestyle for so many years and so just the same we have to leave our Egypt we have to leave this a place of unbelief where we feel comfortable in our in our sin and many of us have already done this and we have we are called by the Lord and we have to accept this promise to leave our Egypt we realize what a horrible condition we were living in and we've realized what sin that we were in and and the place of of horribleness that the devil had tempted us or that we had been brought up in in our in our natural flesh and we had to come to a point where we could realize this horrible condition and we could repent and we could come and choose we had to make a choice just like the children of Israel had to choose and the elders had to choose to accept the word from the Lord from Moses we had to make a choice a conscious choice to live for Christ and to choose Christian Faith by the message of the hour the children of Israel realized this condition they were living in and they were oppressed they felt the oppression and when they came to that realization they accepted the promise that Moses brought them and and they chose to come and uh to leave Egypt and go into the Wilderness with Moses now when we all made that first decision decision to follow Christ it wasn't really always the easiest decision maybe we had to leave family we had to leave friends we had to leave things of the world behind but once we made that decision we knew that we were right on the right path I mean I in my own life as when I grew up in the message I was I was cutting bread from a message Pew but when I made that choice to to follow Christ and to have an experience with him that made the exact difference and what I I felt like I was going in the right direction and if you came from that place or if you came from a past of sinful living you knew exactly that you're in the right calling of the Lord when you when you made that choice for him and so when we made that decision life is amazing we're following God he's blessing us we feel the goodness raining out in the services and we're just pressing into the word and we're so strong but that first easy com that first step can become easier over time but then it becomes harder as as tests and Trials come upon us and the devil is tempting us as a child of God and he's throwing fiery darts and arrows trying to trip us up and get us down and have us fail so that we do not press on to our final destination and so as we've been now we've been we've left Egypt and we've come to this part where we're dying out to Christ and we've we've made this uh We've made this decision and we've made the recognition that we are in this this uh condition now we've we've passed through justification we've asked for repentance and now we've come into the second stage with the children of Israel have left Egypt and they've gone and they've passed the Red Sea where the Lord did the miracle there and now we're Into the Wilderness stage and so the second stage once we've we've left Egypt we found ourselves sometimes alone in the wilderness with Satan just like Jesus was there in the time of of the New Testament and we have to fight off the devil we have to overcome and the way that we can overcome is with the word with the Bible with the message of the hour and God provided in in the children of Israel in the Old Testament God provided a pillar of fire that led them day by day a pillar of fire and a cloud of smoke by night and the scriptures and and the message today can be likened unto that in which this is our guide the the word is our guide and it is by which we we follow and we which why we read and we take the promises to our hearts so that we can be anchored in the scriptures so that we can overcome the devil we can overcome Satan and his enemies we need to take the word and every every scripture every line and bury it into our hearts and put it inside deep concreted into our lives so that we can come when the Devil comes to Temp us we can do like Jesus said and say it is written it is written by the scripture Satan get behind me and the Wilderness got hard for the Israelites tomb they began to complain to Moses and they began to imagine two million people almost complaining to one man amen and and the Wilderness got hard and they were longing back for Egypt they were they were telling Moses we want to go back to Egypt back to the place where they had come and because the the temp the the the trials and the struggles were so difficult that they felt that they needed to go back they were longing for those that leaks and the garlic and the onions and the cool water that they once drank out of Egypt but when God called you out of your Egypt when he called me out of my Egypt there was no promise that it would really would be easy passed through our sanctification we're being asked to cut away things of the flesh were being asked to wash out ourselves we're being asked to die out to ourselves and and accept the promises of God and die out to him so that he could fill us up it's like brother Branham said he's it's not a picnic time we're living in but this is a battle it's a war it's not promised to be easy it's not promised to be relaxed time where we can just relax with our families but it's a war and we need to be have our guards up and we need to be watching out for what the devil could pull on us as they traveled and they wandered in the wilderness for 40 years they they were yet blessed by God when I remember the Lord is always blessing us through this time he's still with us he hasn't abandoned us he hasn't sent allowed Satan to tempt us and he hasn't allowed trials to come on us without being right next to us and right by our side and we see that in the in the story in the count with the children of Israel he was he was blessing them yet with a quail and with manna and brother Branham says in the Intervale 1956 there's three stages of the journey represented here today just the same and we're entering in the last stage of the journey God promised to supply everything physically that he had need of the the meat to go through there the Mana began to fall through Heaven which was a type of the holy spirit so we see in in our time now as you're going through this process of sanctification the holy spirit is still reigning with you he's still with you he's still your comforter he's still your guide and he's not left you but he's yet there blessing you as you are walking through these trials and these tests as he's accompanying you and so we know that the man is still falling the Holy Spirit still falling today he's still in the church today can you say amen and God Is providing for us he's never left us he's been so faithful time and time again and there is a true word still being poured out from pulpits from churches across message across the message world today day and across the United States and all over the world in Canada anywhere the Lord is still pouring out a storehouse of of message of word from Vindicated from the Vindicated prophet of the day and from our faithful pastors and Ministers of the Gospel I mean we've not been left here to fend for ourselves Without A word without the holy spirit to guide us to lead us so now as we've left our sin and we've come to be washed we're called in to live a Sanctified life and we're coming into sanctification and sanctification is that clean holy life before the Lord getting rid of the Customs that we once had like we already said and it's coming to the Lord and he wants to take it from you he wants to take all the things that you were once in he wants to he wants to better than you then you know he wants to take it from you and there's a way through and it's through the word Colossians 2 13 and you being dead in your sin and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all the trust all trespasses blotting out the handwritten of ordinance that was against us which was contrary to us and it took out the way nailing it to the Cross verse 15 he says and having spoiled principalities and Powers he made us Sue of them openly triumphing over them in it so he's made a way through the word through through the crucifixion that that we could bring our sins that we could bring our faults to him and that he could nail them to the cross that he could take them from us and that is how the sanctification sanctification sanctificating process takes us is we can take our burdens we can take our sin we can take our past and nail it to the cross with the blood of Jesus Christ and it is all it is all passed over as we go into the third stage God let the children of Israel wander in the wilderness as he was teaching them and getting ready getting them ready and finally when they decided and the Lord leaded them LED them to to travel northward they came to a point in their Journey where they had to cross Jordan and this is outlined in in Joshua 4 in the scripture we won't go through it just to to keep going but in in the passage there there decide they're going to to travel up northward into Canaan into the promised land is where they're headed and so to get to Canaan they had to come across Jordan they had to cross Jordan and we know that Jordan represents death and then it's the cusp here of moving from the second stage of sanctification into the third stage now where we're receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit or having receiving our promise in the Old Testament they were going to be receiving the promised land where they would there live but you in our day today we're going to we can have the ability to receive the Holy Spirit and have that the Lord come and live directly into our hearts and so you must come to Jordan you must come to the death death by the Watergate and water baptism as we understand in the name of Jesus Christ and we witnessed that here last Sunday it was so wonderful a young brother gave his life to the Lord and went through this channel of water baptism death to his flesh to receive the Holy Spirit and so when we die out to ourselves we've washed away all the sin and we've come through repentance and now we're ready to cross over Jordan This watery gate and receive the Holy Spirit 1947 experiences brother Branham says remember their leader Moses all the time was a type of Christ the spirit today is that right but Moses never took the people across Jordan there was a new order that came in was that right Moses took the the people across Jordan the church manager he called him and Joshua took the people across that's right and Friends great organizations is not going to take the church across Jordan now remember that Joshua coming on the scene see God is going to send this nine spiritual gifts to the church it's going to pull together and she'll Cross Jordan remember he said rise now and let's Cross Jordan he said to Joshua so we we learn here from what brother Branham speaking is that it's not going to be any church organization that's going to take us over into eternal life it's not going to be any of our friends or any of our our groups that we can we can rely on that's going to take us over into our promised land it's not going to be the pastor that can take you it's not going to be a spiritual leader in the church you attend it's not going to be your family your mom or your dad grandma or Grandpa there's nobody that can take you across Jordan except for Jesus Christ because the blood that was shed there on Calvary Jesus is Calling You to rise to cross your Jordan tonight and possess your inheritance by the blood of the Lamb 53 God talked to Moses now as Israel made her journey going to the promised land it had three stages he's just repeating that again and coming out of Egypt kadish barnia the Judgment Crossing into the promised land and that's just exactly three churches and After the Dark Ages the three churches then next the Philadelphian church then next to the laodicean church that's us today then she crossed over beautiful he says today as laodicean we're in stage three where we need to make sure that we are Crossing Jordan we need to make sure that we've made the commitment and that we've we've come through justification that we've been Sanctified that our lives are clean before him and that we're moving over and Crossing Jordan and that we're we're checking that we have the Holy Spirit living on the inside of our lives so the Church of the Bride of Jesus Christ was called up there and and will cross over the veil raptured and we are required to have the token this in filling of the Holy Spirit if you turn in your Bibles with me to Psalms 108 I'd like to read a Psalm David wrote giving praise to the Lord amen we'll read the whole we'll read the whole Psalm oh God my heart is fixed I will sing and give praise even with my glory awake Sultry and heart by awake myself early I will praise thee O Lord among the people and I will sing praises among thee among unto thee among the Nations for thy mercy is great above the heaven and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds be thou exalted o God above the heavens and thy Glory above all the Earth that thy beloved may be delivered saved with thy right hand and answer me God has spoken in his Holiness I Will Rejoice I will divide shechem and meat out of the valley of success Gilead is mine manasa is mine Ephraim is also the strength of my hand Judah is my lawgiver Moab is my washpop over Edom will I cast out my shoe over philistia I will Triumph who will bring me into the Strong City who will lead me into Edom wilt thou o God who has cast us off and will not thou o God go forth with our hosts giving us help from trouble for vain is the help of man through God we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread down our enemies so David is writing here and he he's saying I will praise you among the people I will praise you among the Nations and I believe that we can learn from David and he's always praising the Lord every time he's writing the Psalms and he's praising the Lord he's giving worship to the to the Lord and he's continually in song and in prayer and in meditation and in in today's time where we live and we live in such a secular world where nobody cares to worship God anymore people are ashamed to put themselves in a vulnerable position where they're surrendering themselves people I find sometimes don't want to lift their hands in church anymore because it feel awkward because they're having to surrender it's a sign of surrender to the Lord Jesus and instead of surrendering to the lord they're they're having the tendency to now put up Idols in their life and worship those Idols because it fits their flesh a little bit better it feels a little bit nicer there's no there's no awkwardness to them because they can do it privately uh in their own time or they can worship a sports star that everybody's famous to or they can look up to a music store or a movie star and people start even acting like that they start dressing like that they start talking and they the reason they do that is because they try to run to something that gives them self-gratification they're looking to something that can lift themselves up because they don't they don't feel adequate and rather when they come in and they worship these Idols these these material things are these other people really they're pushing themselves down in their spirit because it is not the way they were not made to worship idols but they were made to worship God brother Branham says God's way that in God's way that's been made for us 52 now I want you to watch God's way LED right up the gangplaint Gangplank I can see Shadrach Meshach and Abednego walking the Death March I can hear Shadrach say a Bendigo did you pray through yep all right then are you sure we're in God's way yes sir and God said in his word for us not down to Bow not to bow down to idols and we won't do it God is able to to Deliver Us from this fiery furnace but if he don't what of it we're not going to bow down we're going to go we're going God's provided way and I can hear somebody saying are you sure he got this his provided way and brother Branham says yes hallelujah amen and and we don't want to bow down to the idols of the world like like and be a testimony in in today's day like Meshach uh Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and we don't want to bow down to the as Idols but we want to have confidence in the word and in confidence in the Lord that he's going to take us through through his provided way in worshiping him King Nebuchadnezzar was putting up an idol in those days and they chose again to not to bow down to that Idol and it's the same way we have to make a conscious decision in today's world that we're not going to bow down to things that of this world of this flesh we have to make a conscious decision to not spend more time on our phones or our Electronics than in time in the word or time worshiping the Lord we need to make that conscious decision to spend time where it's due fit with the Lord and in worship and in fellowship with him it's a choice to go against the ways of the world it's easier to go with the world it is easier it's easier to just go with the trends what everybody's doing you just go that way because it's just easier nobody's pointing fingers at you nobody's looking at you but it takes the Holy Spirit and it takes the word of God to push you in the direction and to stand confident with the Lord and to stand exactly where he's telling you because of the word what the word tells you and we need to stand boldly in the face of Satan and reject his lies it took confidence for the the Hebrew children to walk straight into the fire I tell you would have been really scary thing to be thinking you're going right into some Flames sometimes we we read this story and it's it seems really God's saving power that kept them but if we think just for a moment in our natural flesh if we had to walk directly where we knew that everybody else would has died in this fire before us everyone else has passed away nobody else has made it through even the guards who are standing next to us making sure that we don't get rid of our our little ropes they're passing right off the side of the the balcony there and they're dying from the Heat and so that would be a terrible thing to just walk straight but the word of God held them in confidence to to walk forward and to walk directly into the promise that the Lord had promised them they were walking not only because of a promise which is true but they were also walking because of their relationship with God they had such a relationship with the heavenly father that they knew and they were confident that because they had stayed true to the word and they had stayed true to not bowing down to this Idol and taking idol worship that the Lord would see them through and it takes Fellowship to be able to have that confidence in the word of God it does not come just by rhetoric this does not come simply by reading but we have to have a fellowship with the Lord and worshiping him and having a relationship with the Lord that we receive this confidence and and worship is fellowship fellowship and worship are very similar in in David when he wrote The Psalm he had Fellowship because he was continually worshiping the Lord and he had a relationship with Christ in this Fellowship brother random says Fellowship by Redemption 1955. now in the beginning when God made man to worship Him and live God taking care of him fed him man had perfect fellowship with God there was nothing wrong and God came down in the evening and talked to Adam and Eve and what a beautiful picture so Adam and Eve and in the beginning of time they had a fellowship with the Lord because they would worship Him and they would commune with him and they would have have sweet fellowship with him and human flesh was created for that one purpose to worship God and worshiping God is fellowshipping him and building a relationship with Christ and through that we would do sing and we will have prayer and we can through meditation in the quietness of our heart and through service we We Worship the Lord and we fellowship and our fellowship builds our confidence so that when we come into a Triumph when we come into a test we can confidently know that the Lord is going to take us through we've read the scriptures and now we have the confidence in the author behind those scriptures to move forward and just to press on with the Lord what the Lord's telling us through the word it's a daily thing we can't just worship on Sundays and Wednesdays we need to find ourselves in a secret place every day of the week on our knees before the Lord and we need to find ourselves in devotion and and really devote Our Lives to this gospel and devote our our families and devote everything that we can't think about to the word and to the Lord so that when we come into a trial when we want to have the the supernatural power of the holy ghost acting in our situations it's because the we've been faithful to the Lord and he'll be faithful to us amen David wrote about this too in the scripture we read he wrote Rising early and worshiping the Lord for Glory and his Mercy David was a worshiper and we could see the Lord really worked in his life and when and the Lord was faithful to him and he had confidence and he had confidence in the word of God amen when we're thinking about idols two of the first Commandments that God gave Moses the first was to have no other gods before me and the second was you shall not have make Idols so the word in God himself that was made flesh now that dwells amongst us he he he commissioned Moses these things and and he asked that we would make no other gods before him and that we would not build up idols and worship them and so it must become our passion it must become the love and the admiration of our hearts and it is God that we put first to worship that it's the word it's the scriptures that we worship him because he is all that is to us and it's if our minds and our hearts can be consumed and filled and Anointed with the things of God our whole lives will become an incense of praise and an incense of worship before him so that when when we come and we Fellowship him we're just closer than a brother like a father would be to us and we can just have this Fellowship this relationship with him and we want the genuine if we want the genuine moving of the Holy Spirit we can't let this Sodom condition of all these Idols to seep into our our lives and pollute our experience with the holy spirit because when we start taking away the focus from the Lord and we start taking away the focus from God and the scriptures and the things of of the lord we we will automatically turn to something else because we need to fill a void and that's human nature within us and so if we can make the focal point of our lives and the focal point of our experience this uh commit this communication with the Lord in this reverence and relationship I believe we will see the anyone moving of the holy spirit in our churches in our homes and in our private lives 1961 brother Brenham says in expectations I believe in old-fashioned Pentecostal sky blue skin sin killing religion yes sir I believe in being Gun Barrel straight and preaching it the same way and living it the way you preach it and just jump as high as you can live amen formal dead religion is not going to cut it for us we need to have this life in our in our beings and we need to get that from from the word of God and we need to have that from that fellowship if you have fellowship with the Lord and continual uh conversation with him and you have that relationship with him the things of the word are not going to be boring to you the things of the message they're going to spark in your heart and they're going to keep you alive and and keep you keep you living so this formal dead religion won't cut it and and although theology is good and and we want to understand the scriptures and we don't understand the history behind things and those are all good things to know as a Believer but it's the real solid understandings and the comprehension of the word that is gonna that is Gonna Keep Us Concrete in the message and it's going to keep us tied to our anchor that when we when we are are meeting our creator on our knees then we know exactly what we're what we're talking about and we can just have fellowship with him it's the best thing when you get together with a friend and you begin to talk about things and and you can really relate on the same level amen you can really talk about uh the same subject matter or you can talk about the same the same things and and you can Bond over that and it's the same in the natural as a spiritual if we could really understand the scriptures and we could really know uh what the word says we can we can talk to the Lord about it in our private times and we can ask him Lord what did you mean by this and Lord I I want to I want to go deeper in this thing I wanna I wanna have a greater experience in this area Lord Jesus and he can we can have that relationship a close bond with him that will that will give us strength to live on in this life it goes beyond knowing uh just the things that our Sunday school teachers tell us it goes beyond the things that our youth leaders and we learn in youth meetings it even goes beyond the services but we have to have that in our private time where we're just gleaning from the word of God and we get hit away in the secret place and we worship and fellowship with the Lord if we make room for this genuine moving of the holy spirit in our lives and just worship him we can let praise come out and get in touch with Jesus and I believe that this outpouring and God moving in our in our midst Miracles are going to happen heal greater healings are going to take place and it's all because our faith just needs to be kicked into action I mean we believe that our faith is already within us like brother random tales of the acorn that the faith is within our hearts and it's there it just needs to grow up and it comes it needs to come and take action in our lives Amen brother Branham says in Fellowship 1960 I want to call to your attention hear one thing especially that is on the hyssop hyssop was the applying the blood was applied with with uh by with hyssop and hyssop is as common as weeds and the blood is applied by faith something common reach out and get it anywhere see that's how the blood is applied you don't have to go someplace to get it you just take the weeds the common things by simple faith in Christ and believe and the blood is applied to the door of your heart by simple Faith just Faith just believe him brother Brenham says in nothing and not nothing you have to get any different just the faith that you got now so it's it's the common things that we have in our lives it's just faith is common brother Brenham is typing here and in this in that sermon fellowship and it's it in in the children of Israel's time it was in Egypt and he's talking about this um in the scripture to to apply the doorpost with hyssop of the blood of the Lamb and hyssop was just a common weed that was growing in in Egypt and in Goshen at the time and so all they had to do was take that plant and dip it in the Lamb's blood and paint it over the doorpost that was the instruction and so they had to apply the blood but through faith because the death angel was going to pass and they had to have the faith in the word of God through Moses the the prophet that he he was telling the children of Israel to paint their doors with this Lamb's Blood using the hyssop and they had to apply it but through faith so Faith was really the tool by which they applied the token to their lives it was through faith that they applied this token and so we already have the faith in growing in the Common Grounds of Our Lives it's already there and it's all around us we just have to take it up and we have to paint the blood over the doorpost of our hearts and we need to walk in into the the promises of God and it is it there it is it takes uh spiritual Revelation for you to harvest that hyssop around you and take it up and with action of Faith apply it to your trouble or a try apply it to your trial or your your situation that you're going through and so we've moved into a a New Covenant as as Jesus died on the cross and this blood that was shed for us brings us into a new covenant where now previously was the blood of the bulls and goats that that could take away the sin and brother Branham says now in I am the resurrection and the life 52 we know this that in the Old Testament the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sin it's only covered sin it only covered sin so it could not take away the sin but it could just cover it for the time being and the living was just waiting in Paradise for the day that sin could be taken away but when Jesus came the Son of God the Messiah he took away sin he divorced it never covered it but he took it away and Christ Jesus never covered sin when he came but it was removed completely gone I like what brother Branham says he divorced Sin from us he cannot come back it's gone forever and calling Jesus on the scene 64. now remember every Redemptive blessing you has already been purchased the price is paid there is only one way you'll ever ever be able to receive it it's to believe it and to accept it he's the high priest of our confession the Hebrew says there the Hebrew letter says he's the high priest of our confession to profess and confess is the same thing of course so we he is the high priest of our compassion therefore he cannot do anything for us until we first confess that he has done it so we need to take the faith in our lives and apply it and just confess exactly what we have needed we have to confess our healing we have to confess our breakthrough in our situation we have to confess the peace that is flowing over us and it just takes that one thing brother random says is to confess it receive it and believe it Romans 8 29 and 30. for whom he did for no he also did Pro destinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called he also justified in whom he justified he also glorified God called you he didn't call anybody else but he called you he planned this all for you and he had you in mind salvation is for you sometimes people want to push off salvation to somebody else and they want to say well I'm not good enough and I've done all these things in my life and I I had such a horrible past and I've done such horrible things but there's no need to doubt tonight because the Lord Jesus Christ ordained this this justification and desanctification and he called you the scripture says he called you and he predestinated you that means from the beginning of time he put your name in that book and he called you for salvation there's not one person here tonight or listening to this service that the Lord has called you by accident the Lord doesn't make accidents he he he ordained everything from the beginning of time and your name is there for a purpose and it has a job you have a job to do for him and the Lord wants to speak to you so you need to listen for your calling sometimes we we feel like we'll just come to church and we'll just come Sunday Wednesday and we'll do our devotions but we're not looking for what what we could do for the Lord I believe we need to be always watching Lord what can I do for you today Lord where can I speak to somebody where where could I my life be a testimony sometimes we don't always have the opportunity to speak directly to somebody vocally but if our lives can just be a shining testimony and we can reserve ourselves Lord let my life be a light in the in the places I go today that he could work through you because he has a job for you to do Jesus is Calling out to you the mighty hand of Jehovah's is knocking and Revelations 3 20 says behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him I will sup with him and he with me and that's what the scripture says there and and Jesus is God in flesh it's him who's knocking at your door if you just imagine for a moment it's not just anybody who's knocking at your door but it's Christ Jesus the one who died on the cross he's there knocking on your heart's door and he's asking you to let let him in he says I will come into him and I will sup with him and he with me it's God in flesh the same one who created the world the one who created the flowers of of the garden and the ocean and all the fish in the sea and imagine all the the sky he created and every bird and every animal that would fly in them he created that's the same God that created our bodies he's the same one today that's calling you he's knocking on your door and if you'd only receive him tonight that he could move in your situation he could move in your life and young people if he could just give you the Holy Spirit tonight that he could fill you from your top of your head to your bottom of your toes this evening he's more than able he can feel you right now and those who need something from the Lord you could just reach out and grab it because it's waiting for you he's calling you he's asking you to let him in and he's going to tell you exactly your position in him he wants to have fellowship with you sweet communion so we just want to let the Lord come into our hearts and to speak to us speak into our hearts Lord tell us what we need to do is our prayer we want to look at David just a moment again and David in his young age he he learned the ways of God from a very young age he would go out and he would tend to his father's sheep when he was just a young boy and he would worship there in the field and he would fellowship with the Lord as he's keeping the sheep and his confidence in the Lord be in God became to grow stronger as his relationship it grew stronger as he was spending more time with with God and and he then grew the confidence to be able to be commissioned to go take Goliath in in the battle at the time and David in the Bible was he was meeting on the way to meet his brothers and he was bringing food and that's what he was he was called to do in his timing he thought he was called to just take a lunch up to his brothers and then he he was he saw uh Goliath there and he he felt in his heart all of a sudden now he needs to do something he needs to act on this and this this Philistine is is making fun and he's gawking at the children of Israel who are called they're the people of God and so in his heart he he went after this and he said his brother Branham says here in the great warrior David 55 and when David went to meet Goliath Goliath looked at him and laughed and said why what am I a dog to you you coming out to meet me like that a little old Ruddy boy looking he was ready little you know what Saul called him said who is this Stripling that's what Saul said and who is this Stripling out there just a little old kid you know a little looking fellow probably shoulder stooped over sometimes this is what the devil tells us he tells us like like uh Goliath was saying to David or even like Saul the king he tells us you're nothing but weak you're nothing but a failure you're nothing but a mess up and he says you could never take on this task you could never overcome this thing in your life you could never beat this the devil is stronger than you and he's just trying to get up in your head and talk you down out of your position in the Lord he's trying to talk you out of your position as a child of God as the bride but I want you to remember that God chose you tonight you're God's child and you're the elect Bride for this hour brother Branham continues here and he says and here he come with this little sling but he know God that's the main thing he was a Believer he was elected he was called and he was anointed and he was placed Hallelujah and tonight you know God you are called and you are anointed for the work of the Lord you are anointed for what God's given you and you are placed he's placed you with an anointing to continue on with his work brother banham continues in the same quote you say can that well brother Branham I wasn't called to be a preacher I you might be called to be a housewife but you got your position in Christ by the Holy Ghost amen you're just as much David as the rest of them one was he said so you might not be called to be a preacher you might not be called to be a worship leader or even on the musician team or something you might not be called to be a Sunday school teacher or somebody that's working actively every day in the church but that doesn't mean you're not called that's not the requirement to be called you might be called just to be a prayer Warrior or like brother Branham says a housewife making your house a Godly environment for your children to grow up in you might be called to be helping with the elderly in the church and working with the widows perhaps maybe God's called you just simply to be an amen corner to be an amen and a visual witness in the house of God so that when this gospels preached and an unsold unsaved Soul walks into this house they see Christ on display in this very sanctuary but one thing for sure is that God called you he chose you he predestinated you from the foundation of the world to be working for him and that's your position you've been called and it is in Christ Jesus we move forward amen I just want to go back here to Psalms 108 7 8 and 9. and look at something just the Lord placed on my heart God hath Psalms 108 verse 7 God has spoken in his Holiness I Will Rejoice I will divide shechem and meet out of the valley of sucketh Gilead is mine Manasseh is mine Ephraim is also the strength of my hand Judah is my lawgiver Moab is my washpot over Edom I will cast out my shoe over philistia I will Triumph I want to look at this certain phrases Moab is my wash pot and when I first read this scripture in my devotion I was I was uh kind of stumped over like what is a wash potting and why is the scripture referring to Moab this place in the scripture as a washpot and so I did a little bit of looking and I found that a washpot is not like something for the dishes for the kitchen but rather it is a a big pot they used to use in the Bible times to wash the feet of the people when they would come into the house and we know that that was a tradition they had is because they walked in sandals their feet were dirty and so they would they would come before coming into the house they would sit there and they'd often have what we returned as a foot wash flunky and to wash their feet before they would go into the house and so I looked at this statement Moab is my wash pot and Moab was a territory ruled by a king and the children of Israel were often held captive by this by the nation and Edom was a neighboring territory and and which the children of Israel were kind of spread out through the land living there and the and the scripture tells us that after the children of Israel were scattered through the land um they were kind of being persecuted and they were having uh all these trials and tests in this time so I would like you to turn with me to Judges chapter 3 and we're just going to read a passage of scripture just to understand the context of of what's happening in the scripture with the children of Israel so Judges chapter 3 will start from verse one I apologize for the lengthy reading we're going to read 15 verses now these are the nation which the Lord left to prove Israel by them even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan only that the generation of the children of Israel might know to teach them War at the least such as before knew nothing thereof namely five Lords of Philistines and of the Canaanites in the city of knights and the hivites that dwelt in Mount Lebanon from Mount belarherman unto entering unto the entering of hamath and they were to prove Israel by them to know whether they would hearken unto the Commandments of the Lord which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses and the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites Hittites and amorites and parasites and hivits and jebusites and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel who delivered them even athenil the son of kanaz Caleb's younger brother and the spirit of the Lord came upon him and he judged Israel and went out to War and the Lord delivered king of Mesopotamia into his hand and his hand prevailed against shushan rishtiyam and the land had rest 40 years and othniel the son of kanaz died and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord strengthened eglon the king of Moab against Israel because they hadn't done evil in the sight of the Lord and He gathered unto him the children of Iman and amalik and went and smote Israel and possessed the city of the palm of palm trees so the children of Israel served eglon the king of Moab 18 years but when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord the Lord raised them up a deliverer Ehud the son of Guerra a benjaminite a left-handed man and by the by the children of Israel sent a present unto eglon the king of Moab and so the rest of the passage of the scripture goes on to tell the finishing of the story where he was a deliverer and he delivered the children of Israel out of their situation of bondage and so the we see in this In this passage here the children of Israel as a nation they're living in amongst their enemies and they're continually in these lands and they were in this win-lose cycle they were they were doing well for the Lord and they were on fire and then something would happen and the scripture says they would sin before the Lord and the Lord would allow their their captors or their oppressors to oppress them for a certain amount of time and so time would pass we see eight years of bondage and then 40 Years of freedom and a cycle continues again they had 18 years of bondage and I believe four score years which would be 80 of Freedom so continually up and down there through this cycle they're cycling they're they're winning and they're losing and this this cycle of sin would continue and they would cry out for God to Mercy and God was faithful I'm thankful the Lord's faithful sometimes we do the same sometimes we're found in this download place where we're just not on fire for the Lord and maybe we're not doing completely right before the Lord and we have to continually ask for forgiveness as we do daily and we ask the Lord forgive us and his grace and mercy is faithful each time and we're so thankful for that but we see in the in this the passage here of the children of Israel they're in this up and down up and down up and down and so David writes here in the Psalms 108 God spoke saying Moses is my wash pot and a wash pot we said was a water basin in which they washed the feet and so Moab was this place where the the children of Israel were in this continually continual cycle of getting dirty again and then re-washing the Lord was allowing them to be oppressed by their captors they were being uh in bondage for so many years and then the Lord would raise up a deliverer and they would wash them off in his life that sanctifying process over and over and over and over again in Moab and so we understand then why why David says Moab is my wash pot because it's this place where the soul is being washed or the children of Israel are being washed off continually and and it's a Sanctified entrance for for the sin and so we we come into Moab the washbottom we are washed and washed from our sin but then we need to come out of Moab we need to come on come out of Moab and continue on like the children of Israel did and go up to Jordan where we can cross the river and where we can receive eternal life and where we can receive our promises if we're always stuck in Moab we're just continually in this cycle of winning and losing and we're we're never getting anywhere for the Lord we're never making a stand we're not progressing in our spiritual walk and so we need to get out of Moab and so I want to kind of title this service getting out of Moab that we that we could come through the sanctification process because we need to we need to die out and we need to cleanse our our souls and our lives and we need to make things right before the Lord and live in sanctification but Moab is not the stopping place for us it's not the place that we stop and we continually live in this uh Sanctified Place although when we do come up to uh Jordan we cross over we're still living the Sanctified life we're just not going back to the muck of sin continually and we're not going back to the new the old things that we we once did and we're not getting ourselves dirty in the old things we did but rather we just continue on living our Sanctified life in our position of sanctification and so that his time is a call this evening to come and get out of Moab come and get out of Moab and cross into Canaan line step out of the filth of your life step out of the trials step out of the the situations that you're in and overcome with the word of God and walk forward in cleanness of not of life there is forgiveness that's available but it's time that we left Moab It's Kind it's time to come into our Salvation in full and it's time to receive that baptism of the Holy Spirit if you've not had it and it's time that we we must wash we must attend that wash pot but it's not time to stay there but it's time to continue on there are only one way to enter the promised land of eternal life and that is the sealing of the Holy Ghost God himself so that we can know God in our position then with the spirit of God and we can confidently say because of our fellowship because of our relationship we can confidently say as the scripture says Gilead is mine manasa is mine these are all the things that the the the the enemies of the children of Israel these are all the things that the the people the the Nations that they could uh conquer because of of the the spirit of the Lord that was with them because of the grace of the Lord so with confidence with the Holy Spirit and with the confidence because of our fellowship that we've had with him through our worship and with our our devotion to him we can say Gilead is mine and Manasseh is mine all things in Christ are ours by faith we just need to kick our faith into action tonight and all the promises of our ours of the Lord get out of Moab walk clean before the Lord in faith worshiping him in fullness and in truth will we stand together tonight dear heavenly father Lord thank you for this word that you've delivered to us father Lord you see the burden of my heart is to get closer to you Lord Jesus not only Lord to have a a routine of going to church and a routine of serving you Lord although we love to be in the house of the Lord and we love to be in your word but father would you just dive us deeper tonight Lord Jesus when we take this little idea Lord of of getting out of Moab Lord and will we just exit the routines that we've made so common Lord Jesus and maybe try to start Lord and walk more in fullness of of consecration Lord Jesus Oh father would we devote more time in our days Lord to really get in relationship with you Lord would we worship you more as David did Lord in the scripture that our lives would be an incense of Praise daily father before your throne that we could worship and fellowship with you grow our relationships with you Lord we want to get to know you more father we pray each one of us does we want to get closer to you Lord so that we can reunite with you once again we love you Lord thank you
