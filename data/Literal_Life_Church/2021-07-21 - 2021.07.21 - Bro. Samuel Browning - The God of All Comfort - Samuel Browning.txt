TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's go to second corinthians i want to just bring greetings from church and family and and second corinthians and i want to begin at verse in chapter one and verse three paul writing here blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort who comforteth us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by christ and whether we be afflicted it's for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings so shall you be also of the consolation amen i'd just like to just take a little thought here just for a few moments and just speak on the god of all comfort amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i wonder if we could if we just go to saint john chapter 14 as well i want to i want to pull from there just to read this for a background here just a moment in saint john 14 verse 12 and i don't know if the brothers are putting it up there or not and it's okay not to add pressure on you uh but i just want to refer to that i know sometimes on the midweek services it allows us to kind of move a little bit with those verses up there verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son and if ye shall ask anything in my name i will do it if you love me keep my commandments and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you yet a little while the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also and at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you and he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father i will love him and will manifest myself to him so when we look here as paul is bringing this here in second corinthians and he's dealing with the god of all comfort we recognize there's a lot of comfort and from a lot of different areas we can receive comfort from sometimes the things that comfort that a person can receive is not really comfort because it doesn't it doesn't point them in the right direction it's not really it's not really of a true comfort it'd be like if you know somebody's going in the wrong or they're headed down the wrong way and instead of just really you know being able to mention something to them to encourage them in the right direction maybe of their focus instead just to go along with it not to upset the apple cart that's not really a comfort but this comfort that that paul is dealing with here it's a comfort that is it is made known as paul would deal with this who comforteth us in all our tribulation and we know that in the christian journey in our life you know there's many times when you start out in your walk with god and my goodness from when your life is surrendered to the lord and my it just seems like you know here you are just skipping on the clouds and everything is just going you know just going so smoothly but then there's tests and there's trials and and all of those things are are are pronounced that they would come our way jesus said in john 16 33 be of good cheer for i've overcome the world and he said in this world you're going to have tribulation paul even went to the churches in the book of acts and admonished them you're going to have persecution you're going to have tribulation you see one of the greatest tactics of the enemy is to get us isolated and make us think things are going on in our life that are out of the ordinary it's out of the normal there's just something wrong with you but remember that's always the enemy's tactic the bible tells us paul would lead us back and say there's in samples of how that there's always been tests and trials you know being in god's will does not mean that we're exempt from testing and trying but being in the will of god actually invites the testing and trying because it's testing and trying that proves it's god's will not man's will because god's will is not something that we can pry into or get into but god's will is what's sovereignly revealed to your eyes it's like when you're praying about you know a job or a situation you know in your home and you're asking for the will of god you might be praying and praying and you're thinking my i just don't seem like i'm getting any answer what should i do at that time just be patient because there's a testing and a trying going on remember god his ear is open to your prayer and god knows exactly what you have need of he's not forgotten he's not away on a vacation he knows exactly what your need is and sometimes god will allow a situation to go on that you're praying about maybe you've set the prayer request here that the song leader could say no need to write i've got it remembered up here you always write the same one every service but it doesn't matter the length of time god is still god he cares he's mindful of our needs and so you know as we come into that because satan's objective is always to try to get things in a place to where our spirits get all anxious and we get into a place to where we're tore up and we really can't receive from god what we really want to receive let me just say this and you know this as believers god is not obligated just on sundays to come and reveal his will he's not obligated just on wednesdays to come and reveal his will there are things that as the word is being ministered right here and you're taking that word in it can be a word that you've received from god and here you are maybe right in the middle of target doing your shopping and it drops from here to there and you realize oh my this is the will of god this is what god's desire was you see god was mindful even though it dropped on thursday morning but god here always knew about it it may have been spoken on sunday morning but it finally dropped it's god letting you know i've got this under control i'm watching over every situation so testing trials as they come our way persecutions adversity comes our way and and satan is always at it to try to bring a place to where to isolate us to make us think that well this is just happening to you because of you or or this is going on but we recognize that peter would even stand there and and these were necessary things to put the believer in mind of you know it's something about it when you get around somebody else and you start hearing different testimonies let me just step back a minute there's times where you know even as i've heard it from other veterans and things like that of ministers and you begin to hear things that they've gone through and things that they have have dealt with and went through and then you begin to realize wow you would never even see it or know it but then you recognize there's things that they've went through there's things here and there and you know what that does it just further edifies that you're not the only one because see when peter would write he would say think not that that fiery trial is is some strange thing that has happened to you because our thoughts many times can get in the way our thoughts themselves it can be an effect of our attitude or it will affect our attitude on how we're looking at things but remember the test and trial peter would write it this way it is come to try our faith it's not trying our flesh it's not trying our spirit because there's no test or trial that that or our flesh or our spirit can prevail over a test or trial it's got to take something deeper than our flesh to prevail even when we're standing there and we don't have the answers we don't know what's coming next but there's a faith on the inside it's not a faith that's given by man it's the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me it's the faith of the living god who would stand there in our lives the same god who spoke his word and step back and believe it is the same god that resides inside the heart of the believer and we are comforting in these things as peter said that that thinking not some strange thing because the trial the test it's what has come to prove us you see the faith is the real it's the real gold of almighty god and that the trial the test it comes to prove what is really there sometimes even in the midst of it is we're looking at it if we could see the real victory within it it's that which is standing in the midst and how that there's an anchor that's there that when you don't know what's going on you don't even know the outcome you don't even know the next step to take but you're standing there saying god that brought me this far he will make a way and he'll take me the rest of the way how's it going to be i don't know but back how he brought me from where i was i don't know how that took place but i know it happened and so the where i'm standing now is not man-made ground it is ground that has sacredly been given to me by god himself i'm not here by an accident i'm not here by a hamper stance i'm here by the forenation and the plan of almighty god you say what are you doing we're drawing comfort in these times and this is where paul was writing that this this this this tribulation if you if we look in the scriptures once again who comforteth us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by christ so the trials the tests and those things that comes our way the adversity is opportunities for god to manifest his consolation and his comfort to you and i you you see you and i many times as a father or as a husband or a parent there's times that things that you know our children can go through they can experience and here they are they're experiencing it you're not approaching it from book learning you're looking at it and saying god how do i minister to this need right now how do i speak to this need right here because there's a need for comfort in that situation there's a need for consolation so that they can move on in the right direction and this is where we have to say lord help me guide me in the midst of this time you know what that's just like noah was noah was noah had to look to god in every step of the way but noah had a direct word from god when things got tough when things got hard when adversity came his way he had a direct word from god that he could depend on and he could go to you say what are you saying brother samuel i'm saying that in every situation that you and i go through there's a place that we can come back to it's a place where we can abide that god himself has brought a comfort in our lives we at one time were dead in sin and trespasses but he has quickened us from death unto life we haven't brought ourselves here you see the battles that we face we're not going off of of new things we are facing every battle like moses faced it from the sacred sands of god's grace where we have met god and that's a comfort remember moses ran one time but after moses was there in the presence of god that time when he went down into egypt the next time as he went down in there when the situations didn't turn out exactly like he thought it was going to be but it didn't cause him to run he had a comfort from god who god said i will surely be with you you see there's something that you and i have that's it's so much greater than even what abraham had and and what moses had and all of the old testament saints and we can look at their lives and think my goodness what heroes of faith and they were heroes of faith there's god's will was revealed to them but remember they did not have the privilege like you and i have to actually come to a place to have a new birth to actually be changed to be transformed in our life to receive a comfort that it surpasses every every other comfort they didn't have that but they were a type and a pressing to that place to that comfort that you and i have the privilege and the opportunity to abide in tonight you see that that comfort where you know brother graham could tell us they could look back to this one and see how this one took the word and this one took the word there were examples they could look at just like there's examples that you and i can look at there's examples all across this room here tonight there's examples here tonight that though you or i may not be able to see or to look down in somebody's life we don't have to do that but just to know that you're sitting here tonight you've had to press your way through to be here tonight there might be some of you sitting here tonight that there has been news that you've received this day or other days and it might be devastating news it might be news that would so break your spirit and seem like your will but there is something greater inside of you that's pressing you on because you could say if i can just make it to the house of god i've i've got a hope that god's gonna speak to my heart god's got something for me he's not left me alone he knows exactly where i'm at hallelujah this is god him walking right among us knowing the very needs of our life and paul is writing this that this this tribulation that we're experiencing that with that tribulation comes the comfort of almighty god god takes what what the the world or i would say what satan looks at let me bring this and remember he cannot bring anything your way unless he first gets permission he's not doing this on his own god does not you know tests and trials that come our way remember brother branham lays it out very clearly and we see in the scripture that tests and trials they are predestinated from the hand of almighty god there are things that you and i experience and there might be things i experienced that might be different from you brother there might be things that you could look at in my tester trial and say ah why don't brother samuel just just come on press on through that and yet there's times where you feel like in your tester trial my i don't feel like i can press on through this but you see god knows it's our molding our makeup our shaping that's taking place in our life character and you know this character is not a gift the holy ghost is the gift of god it's the act of god you can't earn it you can't merit it the holy ghost is the sovereign grace of god that comes to your life to lead you to a place of surrender that he might step in and finish a work within your life to where you're no longer your own but now you belong to him and the word that was out here is now dwelling inside of your life in a real comfort and that holy spirit in our life is the gift of almighty god but character is not a gift [Music] character is a victory it's things that it's things that remember at the very character of our lives is molded by the life that's within us you see the preaching that's why it doesn't matter you know what what text your pastor would take when he stands here he can stand here and take a text on marriage and divorce and the holy spirit will bring new birth in the congregation because the spirit of god comes to the word it's the spirit of truth and it's reconciling us unto himself and so when we're looking here into the word how the holy spirit he will come right down and he'll he'll minister ever so personally to our lives and there's molding and shaping that goes on in our lives but the character molding if we had if we had the opportunity there's a lot of things brother kenny we'd have said i'll bypass that one but you see this isn't an extra value menu where you pick i'll take the 99 cents version i'll take this we can't do that you know there's tests and trials there's things that you might look at in your life and say well you know why did i make this decision we understand not every decision even from a predestinated son and daughter of god we cannot claim that every decision oh it was completely influenced by god sad to say there's been some decisions that we have to man up and say that was not god that was me but god can teach us in those situations he can bring comfort to our lives to let us see you got off track here but i never left you i said i'll never leave you i never forsake you what is it it's comfort then if we can allow the holy spirit in the midst of tests and trials and things that's going on in our life even to come and to teach us in those times he will let us know i've been right here the whole time i'm not the one who went away you did but i never took my eye off of you glory be to god that's real comfort amen even when you know you feel like as a young person you feel i feel like i'm all alone but you know what you're not alone you're not alone you stand for him he stands for you there's opportunities that you have to stand for the lord tests and trials will come your way things that will come to really to really test you see what the enemy's doing he's not coming against your flesh and your spirit he's testing to see where is that word at in your life if that word is only there in your mind quickly you'll deviate from it when pressure comes but you see don't don't look around and say well i never had anything in the beginning but take that as as an evidence to say i need to go deeper you see we we're not ignorant of satan's devices he likes to try to bring things and say well you know there was another nothing ever to it let me tell you something every one of your experiences from justification to sanctification to the baptism of the holy ghost is predestinated experiences by the hand of almighty god you say what is it brother samuel it's talking about just taking a hunger for the things of god that lord the comfort i've received in justification i want to be further comforted with a cleansed life lord and further comforted where the comforter himself the word becomes preeminent in my life i want the god of comfort in my life i want the depth of the holy spirit in my life that when tests and trials and situations come when friends go a certain way when others depart this way there's something there's an anchor in your life and there's a place you can draw strength from brother you're tapped into a network it's got a powerhouse of joy and glory i'm talking about the holy ghost tonight it's the real comfort of almighty god that's given to you and i because sometimes there's things that come our way there's adversities there's all types of situations and things that that we can face we're not exempt from those things and i know we know this but it just you know from what's burning in my heart to just bring that and to encourage in that way we're not exempt from those things you know even when you think of how daniel daniel made a stand as a young person i'm just going to go with it he made a stand as a young person he was not going to be a partaker of the king's meat he said i'm not going to be a partaker from his table i'm not going to do it and because he made that stand the devil made him prove it so what happened the stand that he took now invited grounds for that stand to be proven on so when god does something in your life it can be something right in the service of be setting sin or something is cut away don't walk out of the doors and expect well there's not going to be any temptation there's going to be proving crowns but god will invite and say come on devil there's been a real work that's taken here there's proving grounds right here in their lives amen because you know the source the source of strength is in him paul writing this you know of this of this comfort and you know a lot of times we you know we we like comfort but this comfort as paul would write of it it's the same word that jesus is referring to i believe it's the word paracletos which is one who is called to the aid of one one who comes to give strength you see you and i we can't we can't do this on our own we can't live it on our own there's no way as we look around this room here tonight we're looking at lives that are not living this on their own amen it won't work by our intellect it won't work in that way it takes a living experience with the living god to where when situations arise that you don't know the answer to you don't know which way to take you don't know the direction let me just say this to you you already know this as a church but marriage you can't get marriage out of a book you can't get even children and children raising out of a book there's things out there sure that you know that you can read but i can tell you right now it takes a time of waiting on god because listen when god brought samson on the earth before he ever did it the angel of the lord came to his mama and let her know there's a purpose for this young man let me just say that that's why you're not here by a chance tonight god has a purpose for your life are you with me god has a purpose for your life he has a purpose that that even as you came here there's a reason and there's a reason why as young people that satan is after you he's after you but why your strength your stamina your life he would like to try to wreck your life and try to twist it up to where you can't even look up but he underestimates the power of god upon a seed of almighty god brother there's something about it you can be all tore up but you get in the presence of almighty god there's something about the light of the s-o-n that begins to move across that seed it'll bring comfort it'll bring courage where you looked at yourself i can't go there i cannot confess that i cannot but there's a comfort because the holy spirit is not a condemning spirit he brings conviction with the comforting of his presence he wants to draw us he wants relationship he don't want distance you see when he convicts you maybe because of what's on your phone or whatever more that's conviction it's not to shame you it's not condemnation it's conviction satan is the one i've just got to go with this satan is the one who will inspire it to be done and then turn around and hang condemnation over your head but god he'll stand right there and say i know about it that's why i've had my servants just strike on it and hit at it because i have loved you i care about you let me tell you something there is not a filthy enough demon to keep god away from his child that that young man the prodigal was down in the pig pen he was covered with mud but he probably would not even let him in this congregation tonight unless we gave him a bath and perfumed him up real good but the age of the lord went there and spoke to his heart because you see brother braham tells us there was a mother and a father who were down and having prayer in their living room you see that mother and father was taking comfort from the word they had received an experience and they know i couldn't bring myself to this i'm not the one who did this i didn't change my life but it's god who changed my life and this is how a mother and father would pray lord you're the one to change their lives you're the one to bring that change and the angel of the lord went and dealt with his life i tell you there's promises we have as parents you might say my child is so far gone this way but they can't outrun god amen david said surely goodness and mercy shall follow me that means chase after me all the days of my life amen i shall dwell in the house of the lord forever it doesn't matter where they're at you can just stop right now and say lord i send the holy spirit out after him lord maybe it's a wife maybe it's a husband lord i send the holy spirit out why you've got a comfort of his word and his word is your comfort and you know that god cannot fail oh my what a comfort that we have amen in the lord and you find this consolation that that we have received from god it's a strength that keeps us it keeps us day after day year after year you know it's something that's that's that's very deep in our life it's something that's that's greater than than even our resolve i remember as a young person i had a lot of resolve i went to i went to a youth camp i gave my life to the lord i had a lot of resolve i wanted to serve god i didn't want to go back out around the things of the world that resolve was good but i needed to go deeper what is it just keep walking in the same one who's touched your life remember the holy ghost is not is not a thought but the holy ghost is the person the same god who's dealt with your life what do i do keep walking and keep seeking after him how long do i seek after him seek until you're satisfied amen where you you have that satisfaction it's no longer me my life has been changed and transformed by his life that's a comfort in our lives you see brother branham would put it like this in the message of living dying buried rising and coming and he's saying i'm so glad to know that he can be found amongst the brokenhearted in our sorrows he's not one that would leave us jesus don't leave you when times get tough that's when he he takes an opportunity remember he'll manifest one of his seven compound redemptive names every situation is an opportunity for god to manifest himself the sickness that has come your way the doctor's report it's not by chance it's an opportunity for jehovah rafa to reveal his love and his care to you what do i do take the comfort of the word that's in your heart where he said i'm the lord that healeth all light diseases by his stripes i am healed he never said sickness wouldn't come but he said when it does come i will take it away it's a comfort notice he says he stands by us when all has failed and the last hopes of earthly reaching has come to its end he is still god and he loves us he was he was the expression of god oh he says i believe that he longs for his people to be so anointed i want you just to listen this i believe he longs for his people to be so anointed with his spirit that we could go to each other in trials and in troubles and give the expression of his sympathy as it pours from our hearts that's been born of his spirit to reflect in the church the love of the living god so as he was an expression to you and i get into where where we had the word there was no doubt you know they could look at the word they had experiences with god lord god had said and god would keep his word but here came the day where the word itself was no longer just a letter but thou the word had become flesh and that word that had become flesh that had expressed himself to david to gideon to daniel to abraham to moses to noah that same god now had come down in a form under the anointing of redemption to express that he is the god who's been right there the whole time as a matter of fact when they were down in egypt in bondage he was right there he was right there the whole time looking on remember he heard their groanings he earned their sufferings but something changed what changed their prayers their prayers started changing and that drew god on the scene god began to deal with his servant out here and god also dealing down there with his people their prayers within the situation change you know it's one thing you know to experience a little difficulty and then it gets all smoothed out and you forget about it we've seen that happen in this nation as well i mean everybody got religious after 9 11. i mean people got reliant all kinds of religious things you let some kind of catastrophe happen but after a period of time it all subsides why religion doesn't work religion is only a covering but you see god doesn't come to cover he comes to deal with the root and the source of the problem that we might be comforted when situations arise we've got a consolation that he said i'll never leave you nor forsake you amen what a comfort that we have in him paul experienced the sufferings many times paul would you know look at it and take the sufferings and what was taking place and paul would say we're bearing about in our body the dying of the lord jesus why that the life might be made manifest so there's a need for the molding the shaping that goes on in our life i know these things these are these are very uh common places that we've tread upon but i'm thankful every once in a while that god reminds us of this you know what god's letting us know you're not alone what you're dealing with or what you're going through or what you are coming to because this is how it is with trials you're either in one out of one coming to one that's that's certain ground right there but in the midst of the time we're being molded and shaped it's intestine trials where the frailty of our humanity shows up i mean there's nobody in here signing up for a test or trial tonight you know lord it's been an awful long time something's wrong because brother brown tells us and how can i overcome when the testing is taking place that's one sure evidence that god is with us you want evidence that god's with you look at the tests or trials that's coming your way you say brother samuel what what will i do with that well i would just go into the scripture and i would conduct myself with joy joy doesn't necessarily mean bubble dancing joy is a condition in your soul that while all of this out here can be fading away things crumbling but you've got to settle peace that i know that i know that i know i know in whom i have believed and i am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed to him against that day that's a comfort to you and i because when god makes it on his will like he did to noah no one was going to be tested on it god's not afraid for his word to be tested he's not afraid as a matter of fact it's an opportunity to show that this is not humanity that's standing it's deity inside of humanity think of how this you know you and i we had something that was of great value or very precious you wouldn't put it in a fragile pot would you do that you wouldn't put it in something fragile would you you'd want to make sure man it's something that if i drop it like your phone or if you got a phone or whatever you have you know i don't want to crack that screen so you don't want to make sure man i want the best otterbox there is i want to otterbox a sledgehammer and everything else can protect it and and you know monster trucks can run over it isn't that right and they got these cases now life lock life proof and and everything else you know think about it god chose to place his life the excellency of his power inside of earthen vessels you would think there surely would be another place that you could display the excellency of his power but if it was a great glorious vessel if the vessel had all kinds of strength and this vessel can't break and this vessel's not weak and this and that then the excellency of the glory can never be actually manifest but god chose to display his deity his life the excellency of his power brother henry inside of our frail vessels at times if there's times of no doubt you're saying you know what i i just feel so weak or maybe you get discouraged there is none of us exempt from being discouraged sometimes discouragement can hit you can see things this way or see things this way you say brother samuel what must i do don't deal dwell on that thought very long because it'll continue to bring you right down what must i dwell on dwell on the god who has brought you to where you are knowing that the same god he never led you here by coincidence it's not a happenstance he didn't make a mistake we have followed his leading what are we doing drawing comfort from him he knows exactly where each of us are at now to think of this in our lives that expression that has come to us that that same expression now might be in our lives to one another now let me just try to move this down a little bit here you see brother brown let me read it one more time he longs for his people to be so anointed with his spirit that we could go to each other in trials and in troubles and amazing brother bram never said i wanted i want that we could be so god longs for people to be so anointed with his spirit that they go out here and walk on lake michigan we'd all sign up for that i mean lord that's no problem but here the prophet places it that we could be so anointed with his spirit to go to others that are in a test or in a trial brother samuel that ain't very spiritual really who was the one in need we were and he came down to you and i we weren't worthy of how he came to us and there's many times as he's come to us and we haven't been worthy can i just preach for a minute we haven't listened to a certain quote of tapes that week we haven't maybe read you know of this chapter this chapter in my if you're like man you know i'm worthy for him could come tonight or i'm worthy for him to come but he shows up at times that you don't feel worthy why does he do that he's showing you and i it's not about you you are my work oh what does that do it draws comfort brings comfort to our lives that we could be so anointed with his spirit to be able to go to one another to be to be that sensitive to i could be that sensitive to say you know what we're getting i don't know but let me just tell you something god loves you he's mindful of your need to just be that sensitive now when we talk about being anointed of his spirit it isn't walking over to brother guinea and say hey what's going on oh this ah you get over it that ain't being anointed with his spirit anointed with his spirit is where what you've received see what's happening paul said where we've been comforted what's he saying i'm only a conduit can i preach for just a minute you see paul in the midst of his tests and trials you see a test or trial situation could come your way and you could become bitter and if you become bitter it's like it stalls right there the comfort you're not receiving the comfort the word even as it's coming it's precious it's pure it's sweet david said it's pure that's honey but yet there's a bitterness that's inside of you that for the test or trial or where you're sitting and you're not receiving the real satisfaction and the joy it isn't that the word has changed it's to say god this condition that's in my life where the acidity in my life has changed lord i need a refilling of the holy spirit i need a neutralizer of the acids in my body so i can enjoy the word of the lord the way that i need to lord because you're anointed to be a conduit that the comfort of god can flow through brother paul is a pastor here and there's supporting ministry and deacon but let me tell you something every one of you are called to this he said brother sam i'm just a young man you're a young man that's called to it there's other young men there's other young people that's in the church and there's things that you could have experienced that you know there's certain encouragements that's needed what must i do say lord let me be so anointed of the holy spirit that i could go to them and say hey i'm praying for you or just be a buddy right there that just can put your shoulder right next to him what is it it's the comfort of almighty god that's moving through your life because you and i both know you've been around people sometimes that and look when i say people they didn't like boy brother simon you're exempt no it's not that any of us are exempt but the thing that we you and i we experience certain things where there's things sometimes where you've asked people hey how's things going and you wish you hadn't asked because you're already going through things you wish you hadn't asked i mean you didn't say this is not a dumping yard we were just trying to you understand what i'm saying but you also realize you know what it's easy it's easy for somebody to get down it's easy for discouragement it's easy for things and bitterness it's not hard for those things to set in but there is a neutralizing to it if you can just open to the lord and be honest with god say lord you know what i don't understand this of what's taking place i don't understand what's going on but if you can just say lord will you show me lord and lord will you just direct me i put my trust in you forgive me for the wrong attitude i've had you see start right there repentance forgive me for the wrong attitude lord i've been looking at this as though you were against me or or this happened or the church is against me or brother paul's against me or the deacon's against me but lord i'm looking at this the wrong way i'm asking you to forgive me lord i'm going to trust you because let me tell you something every trial and every test that comes our way you know brother brown tells us he says he says we ask god for the best he says and he gives us the best he gives us the best he could test and trials he said that's better than peace he said because the test and trials is a molding and a shaping and our peace and all of that comes just beyond the river this is all the proving grounds right now this is the testing grounds right now god's got to have young people that'll stand in the midst of this hour where the spirit of god is dwelling in them that god can say in this generation when there's young people that'll rise up and say you don't know how bad everything is you don't know how great and how hard the pressures were in college but god's got to have young men and young women that can stand there and say it's true the pressures were great the temptations and everything was there but i'm here as a witness that god is greater than every situation god's got to have witnesses there sometimes you wonder why the classes you're in you're wondering why the professors you come in contact with or the teachers or you wonder why different ones that you're around it's there as a proving ground and that your life might be a lie you might say brother samuel they've never asked me they've never come here to church they've never sought anything out but there's a light that is within you that's bearing witness in this hour they may not be able to put their finger on your life or where what this is or what that is but there's something about it your life they know that's different and that's what god does in a life he puts a difference it's a real comfort in our life my goodness where does time go jesus said you know he spoke of us having love one for another you know you can live in a time where dismissal prayer is given and it's like a people could actually make the olympic trials as fast they get to their cars clock them hey you passed the trials you're on the team we're busy yeah right busy and this and that let me say this this is where this is where you get strength if there's people brother alex said i want to be around i want to be around believers if there's a place i want to be when i when i'm weak i'm going to be here i may not be dancing in the house that serves but i want to be here because i know where the bible said where two or three are gathered together in my name i will be in their midst also i know god comes here he comes by way of his word i know that the man of god that god places right here in this assembly and wherever you go to church at but god directs and he speaks specifically to your life there's a lot of things you're blessed by my i'm blessed by this blessed by that but there's a certain sounding to that trumpet it's dialed right into your life what is that that's god's working brother paul can't do that that's god that's done that that's god's order you see what god's desire is that you would know the will of god you know where you belong and it wouldn't matter who comes along it won't matter what comes your way you know hey you know what this is where god's will is for me i'm dialed right in because the spirit of god is speaking directly to my life i'm glad for that aren't you i'm glad so we're not wondering am i here where i am i have my there i understand sometimes that there might be this some move here and through there we understand that and i know that you understand that as well but i appreciate how god is so specific to our lives how that he cares so greatly what is that it's the comfort of the holy spirit because god's desire is that we would mature we grow and you can't grow if you're always wondering the only way you grow is where it's a settlement said you know what i know this is where i belong i'm in christ that's the first place to be because you can't mature until you're first born again that's that's the real comforter you can hear the word being preached but when it becomes inside of you that's when it becomes the comforter to you personally that no matter where you go you could be standing in the midst of the fire he's right there when they stood before the king and the king said what's your decision they said look we've prayed but we didn't pray whether or not we should bow we just had a little time of prayer just to we were just you know building up just just just talking to the lord thanking him for all of his goodness for all these days down here thanking him for providing for us down here in babylon what do you mean i sent that down no no god provided for us we're just giving thanks to god and so do you mean you didn't pray about whether or not to battle the image or go in the fire no no we weren't praying about that because there's no that that as far as we're concerned there's no choice in that our choice has been made a long time ago you see we've been redeemed we don't want our own choice it's a resolve that's in our life so they were just taking a time of prayer before they walked into the fiery furnace what was it it was comfort prayer is a time of comfort sometimes i understand you go go down through this congregation you say brother samuel shu there's times i mean in my prayer clause or this or that i just don't i don't know it's just not seem like it's times it's been a little hard to press through yeah what do i do well maybe get out and go for a drive go for a drive and just stop by the just start praying and start talking to him i'm not saying you have to do that you can stay right there in that car as well but i'm saying there's something about it with you that you desire to have fellowship with him and there's something about it that his presence it means everything to you when you're going through something his presence means everything that's why when moses could come back to this place he comes back here with all the people and god visits him and god lets him know my presence will go with you my angel i have sent he will keep you in the way and he will bring you unto the place that i have prepared for you what did moses do he rested in that promise he rested in the word of the lord you it was something that was per personal to him yes let me can i read just one more thing to you may have to give me a minute to find it but let me just let me just read it here you think of how that brother branham you know you would remember how he would talk about we're talking about being so anointed with the spirit of god where we're able to to be sensitive and as i said this is a time that we're it's not just now that we're in brother branham would deal with it in the age where he was that too where people were so busy and things and i also believe there's a lot of things prophetically that was seen but there's so much that when things themselves sometimes seem to be presented to us anymore that this is going to make life easier what it actually means is we're going to take more of your time you know what i mean we're bringing robots into work oh go go good that means i'm going to do five men's jobs everything becomes what's supposed to be easier becomes more pressure and more and everything around us and we have to fight through that pressure you have to fight through that pressure unless think of it as young people going to college and different ones college and trade schools hey there's things that that you that you have to do that when i went through college bachelors and masters i never had to do probably sister rebecca either we hey listen when we took a test it was in class it wasn't we're going to take every class day up and you'll take the test on sunday night online you know what i mean so everything is it's your time i mean used to be we can have certain times and have certain things here and there and there's pressure that comes our way brother simon what do i do draw comfort draw comfort that god knows exactly where you're at in the time of your life and i know some of you've heard me say this before and your pastor no doubt has said it many times it's not quantity it's quality you can give you could have a large quantity and it'd be no quality in it it's quality and sometimes in our life that's where it comes down to and every time it's quality but sometimes we have less time than others so don't let the enemy beat you up if oh i've got this all stacked up and i'm not able to listen to a message it might be a message that's taken you a month to get through but you're gleaning you're gleaning what are you doing drawing comfort you're drawing comfort through the midst of it so don't allow the enemy to beat you up about that way you've not done this and you no draw comfort i mean you could take two words in there in the scriptures jesus stood before lazarus jesus weapon you can whip the devil with it god became flesh amen god became me so i remember brother brahm talks about that that woman she saw that where brother brown was talking about compassion being in the body and you know you know there's a difference in in words they have the word uh empathy and sympathy sympathy is have been there been there empathy is i haven't been there but i feel for you and some of you probably have changed doctors because there's no empathy or sympathy everybody a bedside manner you know i remember honey if you're watching tonight forgive me i mean i remember you know what and this i guess this is the difference between man and woman you know for me i will go to the doctor okay come on let's go let's get it on you know let's go forward you know i was happy anyhow let me go on the you know you just want to move things on and i remember the one doctor that i had when we first got married well naturally my wife started going to that doctor and my wife had said honey she said i don't know he says she says i just don't care for that doctor it just seems like they just everything is just so you know no bedside manner and of course me you know i said would did you expect them to roll out the red carpet i didn't i didn't say it meaningfully you know so let's just sweeten it up a little bit you know but i you know brother kenny i didn't think like that to me it's just okay let's go i got things i want i want to move on you know but you begin to realize that with nurses josh isn't in here now but you got nurses that you know empathy and sympathy if you have somebody that comes in kind of gruff yeah i don't want them drawing blood from me give me the one who cares a little bit about i don't want to look like swiss cheese when i get out of here apparently we didn't get it that time i'll tell you what boy something wrong with your arm i think no you want somebody who cares you want somebody who takes a little bit of time and shows some empathy maybe they've never had that situation or something that's happened to them that's how it is among a body of believers as a local body of believers you know you say brother sam we're part of a worldwide we are we are brothers and sisters in christ but right here in this local fellowship this is where you hear prayer requests this is where you see the needs this is where you see one another this is where god puts a burden on your heart for somebody else god has assembled it that way that the members might have the same care one for another and have the same compassion it's like sometimes you have people that come by at a funeral and they'll say you get over it why didn't you just go on why did you even come through the line did it go on i mean people sometimes people that sometimes if you're one of those people forgive me but say god help me i mean you don't we don't know how one another's you don't know how somebody's feeling you don't know but the thing the greatest thing we can say is you know what i'm praying for you brother sister i'm praying for you you don't have we don't even have to know oh tell me all your troubles no i'm praying for you i'm praying for you send them a text praying for you i'm praying for you and when you receive the text don't don't let the enemy put it on your shoulder they must think i'm a backslider they must say no reject that devil god is ministering the care he's got others right here that are that are sensitive they may not have even seen you they're setting up three rows here and you're sitting back there but the spirit of god is mindful in the local body of jesus christ and he'll lay that upon our heart he'll move you hear out brother i'm talking about how if god would do that in a situation where brother random gets isolated in prayer would not come out for that meeting and he hears he hears somebody speaking in an unknown tongue in german language come to find out it was the spirit of god interceding for a sister who had got into an accident and god spared her life it's the spirit of god that moves through us to intercede on the behalf for one another there's experiences there's places where we've walked that it's true we've walked that way but just remember the test and the trial everything that's come your way it's not that tester trial was not just for you that was a testimony that can be shared to the glory of god because there could be somebody else in the assembly that's going through something and the enemy's trying to isolate them and here you give up and you stand up and give that testimony and the enemies told you oh there's nothing to it that ain't that much of a testimony but it means something to you and you watch as you give that testimony it'll poke holes in the enemy's artillery there's a compassion that goes out remember he talked about that woman i'm coming down i'm coming down that woman he talked about that baby remember brother having said how that that one woman she got up she kept feeling to pray for that baby and she finally went and she prayed for that baby and you remember when she came to the platform the spirit of god declared it your baby was already healed out here brother brown made the statement he said that mother because it was a mother she would have more compassion than i could have ever had it wasn't that brother none of us would call into question that brother branham had compassion but you see how god will use things this was a mother same thing god will use a father god will use a young person maybe i should say you know an older young person because brother kenny i'm still young 45 still consider myself young god will use us right brother paul we're still young so you can still do that to encourage to know those pathways there's a compassion that goes out let me close with this and it comforts us this is from bro this is brother neville he's praying i love this prayer this is in five definite identifications of the true church i mean my what what a title and what how brother neville prays here brother neville says father the great problems and the trials of tomorrow will seem as nothing as we're able to hold by hand and walk through with thee brother bram says truly lord the devil says we pray lord that thou would give us a deep seated compassion one for the other knowing that while one is in the deepness of trial and the hardness of testing that we too one of these days shall go through like circumstances god give us the spirit of jesus in us till we feel for each other enough until there will be unity between us and until we can serve thee together that's powerful it's the comfort of god you see paul as we read in our text here paul received comfort from god paul received comfort that even when they were in the midst of tests and trials titus coming to them and say hey paul the church is down there they're thriving he was in the midst of a test of a trial persecutions everything was all around him but here titus could come and say hey the church over there in thessalonica paul they're standing steadfast that was a comfort to him it's strengthening you you see what i'm saying he was he received sometimes there's things that we sometimes deal with having problems receiving god's sending us comfort god ministering things to us what should i do receive it receive it god dealing with dealing with your your son or your daughter and they start wanting to you know come around well brother samuel they're not in the house oh lord receive the comfort that they're contacting you that the god who's leading them to contact you is the same god that'll lead them the rest of the way you're the point of contact you're the you're the place where there can be a deep seated compassion where the comfort of the holy spirit because there's no comfort out here in this world the only place of comfort is in the house of god in the bride of jesus christ it is in the word of god and that's where comfort is but samuel they're you know wanting to come around what do i do just just take it for the comfort of the lord receive it someone sent me a card by the same what did i do receive it they sent me a text what i do receive it it's god being mindful of your needs it's the god of all comfort who comforteth us let's pray heavenly father lord jesus you're so mindful lord of our needs you're mindful of every situation and we believe that lord we we believe that as believers we know that to be the truth lord there's times that we you know lord where it just seems like lord sometimes we're maybe we're all alone but we're not alone it's a time lord that when feelings or thoughts or things arise that's the time lord the word of god is our comfort you said you'd never leave us nor forsake us now lord that's your word what if there's a young person here tonight middle age older i don't know i don't know but that promise lord is a promise you made and it cannot fail because you can't fail so lord i pray that god in your tender mercy may the comforter who's in the building right now that you would just go and minister to that heart to let them know that you've been right there you've been watching over their life lord that even though they went astray let them know that lord jesus your care your love for them is just as great let them know lord jesus that what you said in your word that as paul would write what can separate us from the love of god lord they may have looked at something and said lord i thought i had a real experience in my life but lord i went all this way i went clear back out just head long into the world but may they just take the whisper of the comforter right now that lets them know there's a deeper work that lord that you've called there's a deeper work of the holy spirit in their life to where that word it becomes a living anchor in their life lord where it's not their strength any longer if they can just receive that comfort and say lord i want that comfort in my soul i want that comfort lord of the god of all comfort i want that comfort as a young person the passing from death unto life i want that comfort and when i walk in this life as i go through this journey i want that comfort lord jesus grant that this evening because every head is bound would there be one to say lord that's what i want god bless you that's what i want lord that's what i want god bless you just just continue just to invite him heavenly father i know that lord i'm standing here and there's there's brothers and sisters lord older than me some much older than me some younger lord no matter the age there's tests and trials that that lord we face sometimes there's things that come our way oh my that lord discouragement can come elijah got discouraged john got discouraged the disciples got discouraged so lord we we're so thankful that those examples were included in there that you could point us to and let us and help us to see that that's your humanity that you battle against discouragement sometimes frustration let down but i'm so grateful that there's one that's here that's greater than our humanity the comforter himself lord that you can speak to our lives like you did to the hebrew children you never stopped the fire but you met him right there in the fire lord when i think about how your prophet said they went in there with bands on their wrist they couldn't raise their hands but when they got there in the midst of that fire what a paradox the fire did not burn their clothes they didn't even have the smell of smoke but the fire loosened the bands that was around their life lord jesus [Music] i can't explain it but i i know it to be the truth i believe it i know it lord i know there's other witnesses right here with me as well how that lord through the midst of tests and trials it's lord you take lord of that fiery trial lord god it releases the bands from our lives lord jesus i pray right here tonight may the lord god just move to every heart right now i don't know what the need is the lord maybe it's lord with parents father mother maybe it's lord of marriage maybe lord it's a troubled soul maybe it's lord god financial situation i don't know but lord it's all met in you and i pray father right now that lord god where bitterness has wanted to collect where things lord god where the enemy has wanted to isolate it cause them to think that this is just happening to you you don't really belong to god look at these situations look at these things taking place around in your life and then lord as they begin to listen to it then things can begin to mount with the complex they begin to look at things differently and they're not able to receive things lord that they ought to receive coming from you satan i want you to know you're exposed tonight you're exposed for all of your lives what you've tried to hold over the head you're exposed in the name of the lord jesus christ we rebuke you take your hands off your thoughts every bit of your lies that you've told in the name of jesus christ we dismiss you from this place lord i pray right now may lord that same presence of the comforter may the lord god just invite you just to minister healing to their life lord you walking lord god as your prophet would describe it right there in the midst of the seven golden candle sticks and you would tell the sumerian age i know i know i know i know that poverty i know that tribulation i know and lord god it would as your prophet lord be led by your spirit would pick it up he said oh how this sometimes it troubles the person where they would think why doesn't he step in and stem the tide [Music] but lord you're right there you're watching there is strength that lord god that has given i know lord every one of us in this building there's tests lord there's trials that we've either been in in or will come to then lord we try our best to dodge them [Music] i think of lord how your prophet told us and souls in prison now he said jesus prayed to dodge the cross [Music] lord jesus our flesh and our spirit does not want the tests and trials but the inner man the inner man is the one lord his truth the inner man is renewed day by day lord god with job lord would get so weak but yet the inner man lord god would be renewed lord i pray right here lord god this evening lord jesus as your children lord may they receive that renewing of the holy spirit lord god oh father maybe their flesh their mind their spirit lord god would seem so weak lord god from the test and trial but god they're receiving a renewal lord god on the inside a strengthening and refreshing from the god of all comfort a consolation lord god lord i ask right now lord god the lord you would just pour out of your spirit lord jesus just grant lord a fresh refilling of the holy spirit lord grand lord god right among us tonight lord jesus just a fresh charge lord grant lord god are pouring out of your spirit lord in hearts and lives that are made available to you lord we welcome you we welcome you lord we welcome you lord to receive and that our lives would be a conduit a channel as your prophet called it a chain of sympathy that could move from one to the other that our lives lord could be yielded as vessels that as you came down to express and bring this comfort to us lord this is our desire help us lord i pray forgive us lord when we've complained forgive us lord when we've complained about things forgive us lord and we've asked why lord jesus we want to take this moment and say thank you for encouraging us thank you for coming by our way thank you lord for leading a man of god to speak to our hearts thank you lord for causing a brother or sister to send a text a card lord someone to reach out to us thank you for that lord you're so mindful we love you lord we draw comfort from your word we know we're not what we want to be no but we are so thankful we're not what we used to be we can draw comfort lord to know you changed us lord you changed your life you changed the circumstances and the course where we were headed lord you stepped in lord you're the same god in this test in this trial in the name of jesus christ you are
