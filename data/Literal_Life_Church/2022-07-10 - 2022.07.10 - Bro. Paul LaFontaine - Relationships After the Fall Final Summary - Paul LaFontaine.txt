TRANSCRIPT
========================================
colonians chapter 2 and verse 1 through 17 i know it's lengthy but i want to catch all of this and that way i can refer back to it and how many just really love the lord this morning hungry for his word amen so we have that in common this morning i think we think that we're in the right place at the right time and god knows our hunger and he knows what we need and i pray this will be a blessing to you this morning as we yield to the lord i want to thank the lord for the opportunity to minister to that age group at byc this year it was a great joy the kids took to it very well i was speaking to the 14 to 18 year olds it's about 225 of them there and man they just took to it real well and responded and i went there particularly for them and we had a real nice time of teaching in the lord and they responded very good hearing a lot of good things back not only from them but some of the ministers and pastors who were listening in i didn't know it was live but i guess it was a lot listening in and so we're thankful for the support that we have and that's my little niche there is to speak to young people that age group i really like to grab them and get their attention through the word of god so we had a real good time it was actually fun i enjoyed it having more fun than a human being should be allowed to have and we just had a great great time with them and we appreciate the opportunity to catch these souls and there's great challenges to our young people today the devil's fighting harder and is harder the battle's harder than it's ever been before if you run out of things to pray about you should pray for our young people and the hour that they live in that god will give them a chance and call their hearts and give them the atmosphere that they can receive the lord it's so important today that they go on with the lord because they cannot i don't think they can go against the challenges that we have today without a true birth of the holy ghost and so we pray them through to that and teach them and train them and and create the right atmosphere you can do that this morning in the service can you say man god can do many things if you'll put in and create a right atmosphere make the lord welcome he can do many things while the words being preached second thessalonians chapter 2 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by the gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letters as from us as that the day of christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition so we're talking about the last days here and it is a day of deception and it is a day that many shall fall away so they were they were with the truth but there will be many fall away because it's an hour of deception that's that's prophecy for our time and then he speaks of the son of perdition who opposeth and exalted himself above all that is called god and in his worship so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and now we know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way and that's saying that the spirit of the antichrist was already working in paul's day the mystery of iniquity was already working and although he's talking about the day when the antichrist becomes incarnate and his characteristics there will be a time that the antichrist spirit will be exposed by the message of the hour before it's incarnate in a man we see that the spirit will be exposed and we see the spirit is all the ways back in paul's day as he's writing to the thessalonians it's already beginning to work in the church verse 8 and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness brightness of his coming even him now listen now even him who's coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders lying wonders in other words we live in the age of lies satan is the father of lies so one of the distinction is we live in the age of lies and he'll do lying wonders that's why the deception is there it'll be a lie it won't be the truth but it will be so close in the evening time it'll look like the truth look like the real thing but that's the most deceiving you can get is that it looks like the truth and yet it's a lie and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved so here's the problem is that you cannot go up against this lying age unless you receive something and what you receive is a love for truth how many want that this morning not up here but a love and a desire i'm going to pursue truth i want to know the truth if you don't have that a love for truth then you'll be succumbed by lies but if god puts by the holy ghost within you a love for truth you're always going to be pursuing the truth whether it's in god's word or in relationships what i'm going to talk about this morning in relationships my bottom line is that if you love the truth and you're always pursuing truth even in relationships with one another you're waiting to get to the truth and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion because they won't receive the love of the truth some they'll they'll come under a strong delusion that they should believe a lie so a lot of people will will swallow the lies because they haven't received the love of the truth and because actually god sends a strong delusion over them that they might all be damned who believe not the truth once again they didn't believe the truth but had pleasure and unrighteousness all right so that's that all looks pretty uh pretty dim pretty uh negative it's truthful but it's this is what has is happening but i thank god for the rest of these scriptures because he says verse 13 but we are bound to give thanks always to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and what belief of the truth i'm going to say the same thing that paul said here i'm going to say i thank god every day that there's some individuals on the face of the earth that are called from the foundation of the world and they in this age of lies are going to believe the truth i am thankful i want to just thank god thank you lord that you're going to have a bride in the last days thank you i'm thankful i'm thankful for my congregation this morning i'm thankful for your lives i'm thankful you're here i'm thankful for your hunger in this age we live in where there's a famine in the land for the hearing of the word you're here hungry to hear the word of god i'm thankful for you this morning i'm thankful for the bride of jesus christ i'm thankful for people who through that have been chosen from the foundation of the world through and through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which he have been taught whether by word or by epistle people make traditions a bad word there's some good traditions and that's the word of god and he says in this hour you better hold fast to them don't move the boundary lines don't move uh don't don't try to change standards just leave them the way they are now our lord jesus christ himself and god even our father which hath loved us has given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word heavenly father bless your word as we enter into it we pray that lord you'll send your great holy spirit into our hearts and father may you break the bread of life to us lord give us a good day lord as we partake of your supper tonight together wash one another's feet we pray you'll just bless the whole day bless your word bless our fellowship lord we're looking forward to just spending the entire day in worship to you in testimony to you lord we're just looking forward to it may you bless each one of us our visitors and those that are listening online this morning i pray that you'll anoint the word that someone could be helped in the kingdom of god in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you may be seated now this morning i feel uh that i'm going to try my best to summarize and finish up this little series that we've been on talking about relationships after the fall and the fall i'm referring to in the beginning when we fell and i've been talking a little bit about relationships that took that were different before the fall and everything changed after the fall i'm going to do my best to summarize that this morning and wrap it up because i really believe that a great part of this is coming if the lord will allow us as we begin to talk about relationships after redemption you know it's one thing to talk about all the things that we fell from and how it makes us act and the serpent nature that we were born with and uh to to be real honest with you it's quite a burden on a minister and i lean a certain way i'm different than other ministers every minister is different but it's it's quite a burden when you go through a series that's laboring on things that are really bad things that we do and bad interactions with others and relationship those aren't really shouting services you're not going to have people hanging from the rafters and dancing and shouting and it's quite a burden and quite a labor on me to labor in those things because the response may not be quite as exciting as when you're talking about the joy of the holy spirit i can preach on the joy of the holy spirit and i will again but and but we tend to enjoy things that are that bring the joy of the lord and the joy of the spirit and and and and that's all fine uh but when you're on these things just laboring and plowing with it it's more planting seeds and it's not the greatest shouting services and when we feel the conviction of the holy spirit rather than the joy of the holy spirit it's a bit different the joy is a lot more popular today can you say man the the joy is a lot more popular and i enjoy the joy of the lord but it's good to see sometimes where we're short where our shortcomings are because the devil actually he doesn't like things to be talked about where we're short he doesn't like that because if you get victories in the areas where you're short that's when the devil is really on the run when people will come under conviction and say i've been a christian for years but i'll tell you i'm really learning something from the lord here that i need to i need to give this to the lord i've given all this i've given my my tithes i've given my all these other things but i i realized an area today that i'm doing to my family or my children in my relationships or my relationship to god and i realized i recognize an area where i'm sure and brother branham actually said that he says we don't come to church to get patted on our back or to hear all the good things we actually come to hear our short areas our shortcomings where we can say where we can yield more can i get an amen this morning that's that's really why we come to church and so it's good to see where we're short and not just where we're thriving and that way we can keep growing how many want to keep growing this morning we want to keep growing and a constant atmosphere of energy that says we're right we're right we're right a constant atmosphere all the time of that that we're right may bring pride and that we are the only ones that are right and that we can never be wrong let me say it again if you only have an atmosphere where you're preaching you're right you're right you're good you're good you're the bride you're the bride and never cr never any correction in our lives it can tend to lead to a pride that people start thinking well we must be the only ones that are right and we could never be wrong i'm always right and that is a deception let me say this way so the kids can understand it some medicine that you take doesn't really taste well going down but it's what the doctor ordered and you need it can you say amen so i'm gonna i'm gonna bring this down after these weeks and bring it down to a summary and talk about relationships after the fall and summarize so adam and eve and just tell the story just real quickly okay and this all we've been preaching on adam and eve who enjoyed a perfect oneness with god brother brahman says they were in perfect harmony perfect oneness perfect fellowship not only with god but with one another there was no shame there was no guilt it was a perfect oneness with god before the fall they had unhindered fellowship and love with god and love with one another and and it was unhindered there was nothing there was no guilt there was no shame there was nothing there and so they had unhindered fellowship and love with god and love with one another and then we know that something come to break that nothing could break it before that something but something come to break all that up and all of it was lost all of this oneness was lost and broke by one thing and that is a eve listen to a lie eve the how this all started was eve listened to a lie she had the truth she had the word but then in a vulnerable state satan comes and he whispers and says to her a lie or we could call it a false interpretation instead of the truth of god's word it was a false interpretation of what god said and so we we might make the comment that you can't help but say it this morning and add that most of our troubles many times in life begin with misunderstandings with one another misinterpretations of things that get said many times our troubles begin with misunderstandings with one another or a situation being falsely interpreted to us or maybe uh reposted to us or re-said to us if i had this morning i say something to brother zach i'd say something to him or he said something to me to say something to brother ike and so now if i became the messenger of that he would have to trust me to be a messenger because if he told me what to say to brother ike in the process of me walking across the room and talking to him depending on my character that may not be get said exactly as how he meant it to say it's called misunderstanding it's called misinterpretation of what should have been said he's going to speak the truth but the messenger in between it is very important because it might get misinterpreted this happens every day in our life misunderstandings misinterpreted things things that are read wrong between one another can you say amen how many believe that god that people today misunderstand god's word misunderstand what it means brother brandt preach the message god being misunderstood it's a wonderful message god being misunderstood and because people haven't been taught right and the word pure purely presented to them they misunderstand god they misunderstand what god meant in the bible they have a misinterpretation and a lot of that work is has satan's hands on it because he's the misinterpreter of this word he did it in the garden he's still doing it today he's taking the truth of god's word which is pure has power in it will set you free but if it gets into satan's voice and whispers to you it's going to be misinterpreted and so thus we have the beginnings of the fall was a lie that was told to eve can you say amen one one person said it takes two to speak the truth one to speak and another to hear mark twain said get your facts first and then you can distort them as much as you please now mostly in this life people don't do that they don't seek the facts first they go ahead and misinterpret they go ahead and read the story read what they hear right off the bat and it gets misinterpreted and like the old phone thing that we used to play as it goes around the room to everybody you say something and it's so funny and so sometimes embarrassing what it ends up at the end of the of the phone call all of you have done that we we did that as a kid it was very funny and it's amazing you're sitting right in front of one another and whispering things and it's amazing how twisted that story is at the end so most of us we we don't take the truth most of us will take hearsay and then we'll misinterpret it even more mark twain says get your facts first and then you can distort them but but say i would say satan is more like this than anyone and that is that the truth is there the truth has been told the truth is present it's been spoken to his people and that's when satan comes in and starts to misinterpret the word and so um they so i'll read it as brother braham said it here in oneness he says now when adam and eve listened to the lie of the devil the holy image of god left them and their fellowship was broken with god their fellowship i don't know if you guys have that quote their fellowship was broken with god their fellowship of oneness with god was broken the very minute they listened to the lie of the devil that broke their fellowship and the very minute that you listen to the lie of the devil it'll break your fellowship that's the very minute that you go out from the presence of god like she did is when you failed to take god's word just as it is leave it alone just as it is leave it alone just as god said it you may not understand it you may not see it all yet but leave it alone don't ever misinterpret it and don't let satan whisper in your ear and misinterpret the message the word of god leave it the way it is can you say amen this is what he did to eve is what he said it didn't really mean what god said there it meant this and that's where you have your trouble that's when they broke fellowship a lie was told and the holy image of god left them their fellowship was broken in god their fellowship of oneness with god was broken and the very men they listened to the devil of the lie of the devil that broke their fellowship and the very minute you listened to the live the devil it'll break your fellowship so i'm trying to make it simple this morning is that fellowship and oneness with god and one another is broken by real simple things but they're important things and that's when the lies come in and start to unravel the truth that we already have that's when things begin to break up that's when splits happen that's when fellowship is broken and then because everything broke away then we find adam and eve and king right away right away acting different than what they did living under the word and living under truth they started to act different and and when you live in truth and live in the protection of truth there is a protection with it there's a shield against the enemy when you just simply live in truth once you step out of it and listen to other voices interpreted to you you're on dangerous ground but if you live in truth and you trust it even sometimes when you don't fully understand it but they say this is from god this is truth i'm gonna live in truth because truth truth is will always be truth can you say amen as i said last sunday the truth is marching on satan's trying to to take truth away in every generation destroy the value of the promised word of the age in every age he's tried to do it and yet yet satan i'll tell him this morning and yet all of these generations for 6 000 years truth still prevails he was never able to get rid of truth it's still alive today because truth when it is believed it may look like satan is going to trample upon it under his feet but truth will always prevail and truth will always be truth and you're going to be freer and you're going to be have more victories if you live in the truth all the time is that okay with everybody and so there you have a shield you have a protection from the enemy when you just simply say i'm going to live in truth i'm going to pursue the truth i'm going to find the truth i want to live in that protection of it there's a shield and so now when all this happens now another nature is driving them because they listen to a lie we have the fall of man and they listen to a lie about the truth now another nature and characteristics to that nature is driving them and they're acting all out of sort so i'm going to summarize now the first thing they started to do was lie themselves because they're under the spirit of satan which is lying they started to lie they started to blame one another instead of standing for one another i preached on that last sunday the blame game and blaming other people for things so they started lying they started blaming one another instead of standing for one they started hiding their sten instead of bringing it to god i said they started this is characteristics of the fall they started to hide from the presence of the lord instead of run towards the presence of the lord could everybody agree that when they failed the best place that they could be running to is back into the presence of the lord but our nature is to run from it to hide from it some people don't realize that when you're in trouble or you've made mistakes the best place that you can run to is the presence of the lord the best place they can get to is the house of god where the gospel is being preached but you know what most people run from that that's the first thing that they strike off their list i ain't going there and i'm going to go hide somewhere i'm going to go i'm going to take a big vacation that's not the way to deal with your struggle with your relationship with god if they should have been running back to the presence of the lord side god we've made a mistake here god have mercy on me but our nature where's all this nature come from to hide from god it's all from a fallen nature we tend to hide and they started hiding their stint instead of bringing it to god listen to this they took time and sewed fig they didn't just hide in the bushes they took time to sew fig leaves together i love how that's worded they they sewed the bible says they sewed fig leaves and aprons together they did it together now they have no oneness anymore but they somehow found oneness to sew fig leaves together so they got some oneness but it's really strange because they're they're they're saying let's let's do this and and let's and so they're gonna find creative ways to run from god and hide their shame and they're going to do it together in their marriage before they prayed together they fellowship together in purity they were openly in his presence and now they were finding ways to be out of church and hide from his presence don't forget i told you these type of services you're not going to see anybody shouting and running the aisles unless you get a victory this morning and when victory comes you could be running the isles because if the devil is exposed in your life and you respond and say god i want that kind of victory in my life i don't want some old nature guiding me i want the nature of the holy spirit living in me that's a victory can you say man that's when you shout but they're sowing and i can spend a lot of time on that because it come open last night how that a couple together working to hide from god and find creative ways to be away from god and away from there's a lot in there but they found ways together to be out of things and out of the present and so then the re then the rest of the fruit came out later because sometimes things don't manifest until over time and the bible says in the process of time then twins were born to eve then in the process of time it was these twins that grew up and they began to show more fruits from the fall i want to talk about that in the process of time the boys here wanted to worship and one boy brought fruit to worship with and one boy brought blood to worship with and the bible says here's some more characteristics cain was wroth and things extremely angry cain two brothers now twins from the same womb two brothers cain became roth at the worship of abel because god accepted abel's worship and he rejected cain's and cain became wrath he became angry angry anger wroth a a temper where does all that come from i'm going to make it real clear this morning all these characteristics do not originate in god they came from a person and that's satan don't ever justify and say i don't have to repent of these characteristics because they don't come i remember brother branham saying talking about it was either his wife or his daughter or someone you know and they got their temper up they slammed the door and he just makes this little comment he said now that's the devil it's just so crystal clear that's the devil and if you act that way it's the devil but i'm a christian well you got the devil on you okay i'm not trying to de-christianity but don't don't don't make it something well i just made a little mistake he said that's the devil making you act that way it can't come from god it can't come the fruits i don't find temper in the fruits of the holy spirit it's not in galatians i don't feel blowing off and and and writing people often saying all these bad things i don't find that in the fruits of the spirit but i do know the author of that i can go through satan's josiah satan's story satan's history and i can find gossip i can find lies i can find blaming can you say man i can find a murderous spirit all these things that came it came from somebody and it came from a nature and it came from the serpent nature don't ever justify it call it what the prophet said that's the devil and when you go to repent you can say i made a mistake because i yielded to the devil and my temper uh went off and uh i know there's some that say that you know hey uh i i i don't i got the holy ghost i i never get angry well you're already in your glorified body and i'm wondering how you got there before me because my bible says that i have an infirmity of the flesh i live in a flesh man that's not born again okay and i'm not justifying temper i'm not justifying sin but we make mistakes that we have to quickly bring to to repentance to one another and to god and with the repentance if you're really sincere you're saying god whatever it is if this keeps popping up god i want you to deal with it that i won't do that again that i stop doing that because it's destroying relationships in my life where's the source of this anger is anybody asking where's the source of my anger and if you keep peeling back the layers sometimes you can go back years and find there's something eating at you on the inside and you're blowing off at everybody else and you're getting mad at the traffic cop and you're getting mad because somebody pulled in front of you and you're not going to the source you think that's the problem you're blaming that light and you're blaming that person that drove out in front of you for your anger and you're not getting to the source of it when you come in christ you say lord get to the source of why i'm angry and dissolve it why am i bitter where's the root of bitterness god take your holy spirit and burn that bitterness out of me yes yes and so in the process of time case what king was wroth and there this is very not normal that he detested just detested abel for this sacrifice anyone should be happy when someone else is blessed normal people especially that have the holy ghost the normal response is if someone else is blessed and someone else is accepted and someone else prospers prospers under god and someone else is promoted and god accepts their sacrifice normal response should have been praise be to god you found the key praise be to god i rejoice with you abel praise the lord i i'm your brother here and i said it last sunday if god said even said to cain who was a directly from the serpent and we know that he said to him if you'll go and take the way of your brother i'll accept you if you'll bring blood i'll accept that's serpency talk about god's grace talk about god's mercy but he wouldn't do it his anger his raw he was he resentful he couldn't stand that god accepted him that able and didn't accept him you think this happened back in the garden it happens every day in relationships anybody should have been happy when someone's accepted and honored and promoted by god and someone goes a higher level because god blesses their life we should be standing as cheerleaders instead of getting resentful at that person getting mad so young people get mad cause somebody else gets married before you you get resentful towards god where did they get god i've been praying for 30 years i know what it is to be despised and rejected of all men they get more and more bitter and angry at the whole thing because somebody else was blessed and i've been asking god for years for this it's terrible we should be rejoicing when god blesses somebody we should be rejoicing when somebody gets the holy ghost we should be rejoicing when somebody's changed in their life we should be rejoicing some of you got on your schedule you're ready to leave somebody's down here repenting and getting through to god we should be staying and rejoicing with them [Applause] you know what did you live by your schedule but let me tell you the schedule that's most important it's the kingdom of god his clock his timepiece is the most important schedule and you ought to let everything in your life be secondary to god's kingdom we ought to rejoice when someone rejoices paul said it in the body of christ when one suffers we all suffer when one rejoices we all rejoice but no cain he is bitter towards towards abel and and so he's wroth and you know i would say i know we get angry sometimes because anger is a part of our emotions paul taught us that in ephesians who said be angry and sin not you're going to be angry at some things but this was more how do we know it was more this wasn't just anger in cain this was more because it acted out something in its anger and when your anger is ready to act out and get back and kill your anger's out of control and i'll say it i think i said last sunday brother brown makes a comment elect doesn't persecute elect there's something desperately wrong when you're calling yourself elected bride and you're persecuting another elect whether online on your post or whatever it is elect doesn't persecute elect praise the lord everybody still love me i'll finish this up and then i'm gonna i got a positive i got something positive at the end you know the word jealousy is not mentioned here in the bible but brother branham said this is where it started it was jealousy and cain everything begins to break down a lot of times you tie back to jealousy it started and you can't see jealousy it starts in someone's heart they're jealous of somebody else someone else is getting more praise someone else is getting it someone else is being accepted someone else is getting more attention over the pulpit so it's a jealousy that rises up somebody else has this and i don't have it so jealousy is one of the worst things and people become green with jealousy i can safely say that cain had become green with jealousy towards abel jealousy is something that eats at us it eats at us and then it makes us angry at someone and then when we're so angry because of our jealousy we act out something i hate this person now i'm so mad at this person and i'm gonna do something about it what he did about it is that he just basically killed him so it's really easy for us to say amanda where's murder come from don't come from god it comes from satan he murdered his own twin brother there his own he he martyred he killed him his angers got so out of control and his resentment and his jealousy he just murdered him but i got a quote here to bring it up to date a little bit because i know none of you people would murder other people of course not we're too good for that but this second quote says maybe you haven't read it for years maybe you've never read it before brother brown says and you people with these saw blade tempers that's always spouting off in the mouth at somebody can't put up and things like that be careful you're guilty if you speak a word against your brother that's not right not just not just go around and tear it down it you don't have to stick a knife in a man's back to kill him you can break his character and kill him and kill his influence modern-day murder modern day violence modern day murder is that you give yourself permission and you're angry at somebody i know how i'm going to do this i'm going to say some things and i know it's going to kill because i can't stand his influence i can't stand all all that's happened and so i'm just going to say some things here out of my anger and what you don't realize is that your words have power to them and it's going to kill somebody's influence a murderous spirit didn't come from god comes from the serpent shall we finish the rest of the quote speak against your pastor here say something bad about him you just might as well have shot him told something that wasn't right about him well it'll kill his influence with the people and things like that and you're guilty of it that's why i mentioned my dad used to teach and tell people that be careful what you say against the ministers because that minister may be the only one that can help your child someday when you can't help them god may use that minister and you've already destroyed their influence in your child's minds you've talked about things in your home and you put down the ministry and you've said things loosely and all the while little ears are listening where they'll never have confidence in that man even when he's preaching the gospel like this they don't have confidence i say us parents ought to grow up and be careful what we say against other believers in the body of christ can i get an amen i say and i'm preaching to myself we need to be more careful about what we say against other members of the body of christ because you won't go shoot them with a gun but you can kill them with your killing their influence all these attributes came out and guess what all of these attributes were not learned some of these attributes were almost immediate and they didn't adam and eve blaming one another they didn't go to classes before they started to manifest these attributes isn't that amazing i'm going to bring a point here that is this isn't about that where they were taught this is about something got in their nature that was wrong it was deep down in their nature now and so now everything that they started to manifest it wasn't taught they didn't take lessons in it they didn't adam and eve didn't go through a 10-week process to learn how to become fussing and arguing with another and fighting they didn't they didn't they didn't it was all within them to fight for their own way to stand for themselves instead of tell the truth to blame one another to lie to hide from god they weren't taught that it just came with this whole fall in the garden it was inherent in the nature they were lying and they didn't learn how to lie and the best example of that is a little two-year-old that uh when when they when they got a cookie and you know they did but they're you go over to them say did you steal that cookie and they're they're looking there and they're saying no i not me no and they have they have crumbs coming out of their mouths me no johnny did it johnny did it not me that kid did not go especially at two years old to a 10-week seminar and learn how to lie and yet they're such good ones at two years old already they're professional liars they're better than some adults they know how to blame someone else and they know how to do this and deny it deny it there's no evidence of it then just breathe bring it show me i mean i'm telling it's amazing and guess what they didn't learn it it comes in the nature that they're born with it's by nature that these characteristics come so whose nature is it didn't come from god so this means that when they fell from truth and listened to a lie they took on not just did they fall and lose everything they had with god they took on a nature and attributes that can only originate in one and that's satan himself he's the father of lies he's a false interpreter of the word he's the blamer of someone else he's the gossiper he is jealous of uh jealous wasn't wasn't lucifer jealous of the position of god and wanted to be worshiped like god he's the originator of jealousy and he drew a per he had influence on the third part of the stars and so he rose in jealousy to take away the kingdom from god even before we got to earth he is he was he's jealous of god but guess what satan's really jealous of he's a great jealousy over the believer's position in christ he's been always jealous of your creative power because god gave creative power to adam and when god gave that full power on the earth to adam satan was jealous of that creator he's never had creative power can you say about he never will have it he can't create anything he only perverts what god brings out he has always wanted access to that creative power and guess what god gives it to sons and daughters of god he gives creative power to you no wonder he's jealous of you and puts a believer in his position in christ by the holy ghost he stands as a powerhouse against the enemy and satan says i can never have that so the only thing i can do is fight against this believer try to tell them they're not a believer try to belittle them try to put them down try to find their mistakes and capitalize he's trying because he's jealous of your position in jesus christ you have something that he can never have and that's why satan hates you it's not your personality he hates it's not your mannerisms it's not only it's what you have in god inside of you that's what he's jealous of so who's the author of jealousy satan himself he's jealous of other believers and that's why who is it that becomes jealous of other believers in the body of christ who is it it's not you my brother said that's satan anointing you that's satan annoying you whoever it is on the online whatever church it is if there's splits and divides going on and it starts with jealousy and satan working that satan is the author of that that's what's working god's not working among you it's satan trying to divide you because you're jealous of one another's positions i can say a lot of things here i put a brother in place it's amazing the resentment that rises up against that brother i just let of the lord you know we don't have politics around here i just do things as i feel led of god i really do and people make it personal and put this brother and it my assistant takes some heat sometimes and some brothers i put in positions i say why are people saying that against them why are people doing that it's like we're not being led and we want to be led by the holy ghost here but it's amazing the jealousies and the resentment that rises up sometimes i tell you i just want to say a simple church led by the holy ghost you can say anybody can say what they want to say but i'll tell you you know let's just remember that this thing to divide originates in satan i'm not calling you satan but i'm just saying be careful what you're influenced by satan is jealous of believers satan's angry the bible says he's a roaring lion satan's are off with you he's wroth with god he's the one who's out to steal to kill and destroy none of those attributes come from god always remember that but then deeper than that now i'm just taking this on and if if if if this is not taught and this is why it'll get so good when we get to the the characteristics and relationships after redemption because if this all comes by nature and you weren't taught it then we realize what we're going to talk about down the road what comes with the nature of the holy spirit is not you trying to do it but if you got that nature in you then you already have the power to manifest those things in your life by nature not by rules and regulations not by do's and don'ts power because of nature so here then god is providing something let me just say it this way if this is deeper and it's by nature and they weren't taught this then god has to provide something so deep as to go into the very nature of us and change it when you're talking about inheriting something that you didn't even give yourself you were born with it that goes pretty deep what you inherited from your family traits goes so deep some of those things you can't change those inherent things that come from your family members now if they're of the devil that's one thing but some things you're just they're just going to be in you so if the power of of taking something from what we were born with and we have the nature before we even we didn't ex we didn't even accept that it came with the nature of it and if that power is so strong then when god deals with us and he's to deal with these characteristics and he's going to deal with our lives then god would have to provide something so deep as to go into the he can't provide a denomination he can't provide just education he can't provide just psychology because this goes so deep within us it's going to have to go to our very nature can i get an amen this morning god would have to provide something so deep that it goes to the very core of our nature and changes our nature so that other characteristics will come out that's why man in denominations try their best to take the trouble of man his characteristics his jealousy and his murderous all these other things and try to reform him through education try to reform it change his mind mind over matter can you say amen he tries his best to do it but it's god who provides us and god would have to go so deep within us to change our very nature how many would raise your hand this morning and say i know god has done that in my life my desires have been changed praise the lord then god has to provide something and when you're when it's inherited you don't change that by intellect by mind by education so nicodemus comes to jesus by night i don't know why he came by night but he maybe was taking it easy and hiding nicodemus comes to jesus by night a religious leader and he says lord jesus we we've watched your ministry we like your style boy we really believe now you come from god we like your church it's got good music i like the youth group i'm thinking about changing churches just thinking about it your coffee's really good i love your worship i think i want to attend your church i'm thinking about it i'm coming to you by night because i'm still in the process of thinking about it i like your style boy and jesus response was nicodemus you have to be born again wow that's rough i'm not being that rough this morning am i he just told him straight let's not talk about what you think and what your counsel has said and you've concluded that you must be of god and let's talk about you and before you come something has to happen because if god doesn't rebirth you by a new birth and change your nature you could accept this up here and you're going to have still all the characteristics of the serpent nature coming out of your life you're going to eventually deny this word because satan denies the word you're going to eventually get jealous over things because satan gets jealous you're a visit because all those characteristics are all there in your nature and he just answers them by saying you must be born again can you imagine nicodemus and what he says what in the world have you just said and he actually said how can i do that do i jump back inside my mother's womb and then i jump back out again that's what he said he don't have a clue what he's saying but he would know later and the church would know later he's saying the right thing you cannot get this through education you cannot get this through just changing your mind you have to start somewhere god has to go to the core of your nature and change it you have to be born again young people you must be born again it's not just like in the music and liking the youth group you must be born again you say god come and change my nature god give me a conversion deep on the inside why haven't some of you done it yet i don't know all the reasons but i encourage you in the lord don't let the devil whisper in your ear like it did to the prophet he said i would have given my heart to the lord at 12 years old but there was a spirit hung over me that kept saying to me just wait a little longer guess who was whispering to brother branham at 12 years old the same serpent that was whispering in eve's ear young person recognized who's whispering in your keeping you back from a new birth it's the devil lying to you and you rather believe his lies than to say the truth i need god i need a birth i'm going to cry out to the lord not my mom not my dad it's not about anymore i need what god provided through calvary i need a change can i get an amen this one i need to be changed i need god to go very deep as deep as he can go into my life that's the trouble when people struggle with the message all these years they struggle with it they struggle with the dress code and they struggle with this you you need to look at where your nature is because if your nature still desires the things of the lord and you're trying to smear on the message on the outside you're going to be the most miserable person on the face of the earth why not look at your life and say do i have a nature change i'm a good person i give my tithes i do it praise the lord god bless you god will bless you for that but only you can answer the question has my nature been changed has my nature been changed only you can answer that question and only you can call out to god for it how many message people growing up in the message are recognizing many times i've done the right things i've done all that i was supposed to do and i'm starting to see i i don't have the change of desires that god provided at calvary i can preach it up here and you might get mad at me but it's the day when you start to examine your life and if you've got desires you've got that desire to serve the lord same end of the word of god and you love it you love truth you love truth if you can say you love truth from the inside of the inside then let god take over the outside and do what he needs to do but you need to be real honest if you can i'm saying i don't have this by nature within me can you still come to church yes please we love you come to church this is where you need to be until god just begins to work and change and do these things yes we got all kinds here all kinds of different stages of their life i would never isolate and say well it's only people that are filled with the holy ghost can come here that's not a that's not a church can you say man it's only people that come to full adoption that can come to this year no no no we want god to come and meet you where you're at with the holy ghost without the holy ghost without salvation without we want god to be personal to you and find you where you're at and you get a hunger i need more of god how many would agree and say we need an atmosphere here we just went on commercials on the local television they were just on yesterday we're running i'm inviting as much as funds have i had i'm inviting people out to church i'm inviting everyone just to come and be in the presence of the lord they went on a couple days ago and i walked into the bank and said hey hey i've seen you preaching this morning something just i've had a rough week this week but i'll tell you that was a blessing to me praise be to god somebody heard me preaching a few words brother kyle sister laura put it together and i'm preaching he takes out a few lines there some key lines a little bit of singing on there 30 second commercial and i'm praying i prayed this morning let that 30 seconds catch a seat of god put a hunger in their heart to come and visit it's not about us foreign no more here friends and it might make you feel uncomfortable who comes through the doors but i'm praying they'll come in these doors whatever condition they're in you can come in whatever condition you're in god loves you and he wants to take you further in your walk with god and if i have that love which i believe i do i love you the same and i want you to overcome your hurdles i ask people sometimes after years of struggling with this message i said can i help what's your hurdles what is there anything i can help answer because sometimes the devil just has one lie there that's keeping them to stepping onto further victory can i help you in any way to tear down the walls that you trust the lord with your life and you find a further victorious holy ghost filled walk that's what we desire for your life can anybody hear my heart here this morning i know that this is the vision can you say amen and it's not about us for no more it's not about the politics out in the churches i am becoming less and less interested in being involved in any of that i want to focus on the holy spirit and what he wants to speak to us here and i'm crying i'm praying god bring more souls into the kingdom of god bring the hunger bring the last elected seed to us let the music draw their attention that that things will attract and brother rep said healings and and singings are the bait on the hook to draw them in that the music cuts their attention but let them come and then recognize the state that they're in and that calvary the power of calvary is available to them hallelujah let's give the lord a handcuff of grace that's what i desire that's my vision for the lord he gave me that vision i'm not concerned about the politics and everything else that goes on i just i just want to focus on what the kingdom of god and what we should be focused on hallelujah so jesus said you must be born again it has to be deeper has to be deeper what time is it has to be deeper it's the nature it's it's taken you'd have to change the nature of a pig to be a different animal or he's going to be a pig even if you wash him up and put him on the front row and give him a position or make him a deacon or no you must be born again well i got a gift i can sing oh let's put them up there let's do it no no no no are they coming for the word have they been changed by the word well they got a gift the gift is not more important than a new birth the gift is never more i don't care how well they play how good they sing i don't care if they sing in the biggest venues in the world listen have you been born again we don't lift up the gifts even the gifts of preaching we're not lifting up the gifts we're lifting up jesus christ and the changing power transforming power of the holy ghost that's what the nomination has become is it's all the surrounding of a bunch of gifts and who has the best gifts and it's glorifying gifts and a lot of people are not even living the life sometimes even our own ranks the gifts are great but they're not living the life there's no holy ghost there but they they're so interesting if we can just let the gift work and they can sing really good and the anointing can come then we're okay with it i'm not okay with that you must be born again your nature has to be changed because if your gift is taken away from you you're going to continue and go on with god serving him with all your heart what if you lose your voice and you don't have a gift anymore what if something happens to your body you're not able to do your gift out there anymore you're not able to work anymore you do you lose everything in christ no you've got to have a nature chains does anybody listen to me this morning you got to have a change of a nature you must be born again amen if if the fall happened in the garden by believing a lie then it's pretty simple that the way back starts with believing the truth and i don't mean intellectually just saying now i believe this i'm talking about what he said in my text they need to receive the love the nature the love of the truth and because they wouldn't receive the love of the truth by the holy ghost then there come under a delusion to believe any lies but if the way out of eden was believing a lie then the way back starts with believing the truth the truth receiving the truth the love of the truth when we get a true experience of the holy ghost in our soul we have received a love for truth what's the evidence of the holy ghost when we've received the holy ghost we receive a love for truth you love truth and sometimes it doesn't matter the vessel that it comes through that's besides the point it doesn't matter what avenue it doesn't matter if you find that it's truth you love it you say amen to it the evidence of the holy ghost is saying amen to every word of god of this age by nature it just it just it just says amen it may not say it here but it says amen amen evidence of the holy ghost it's not shouting it's not dancing that's the joy of the holy ghost you get stimulation of revelation you're going to shout and dance sometimes or you may just cry not everybody will shout and dance is it okay to say that not everybody may shout and dance but you're going to be there's going to be a reaction emotionally when you're stimulated by the revelation but the evidence of having the holy ghost is not an emotion it is your nature has been changed that you begin to love the truth even in family relationships you'll stand back and say now you've just said something to me against a brother you've just said something to me and we heard something and a believer will stand back because he's a lover of the truth he won't jump right in and say well tell me more i want to hear more i think we should stand back and say i'm going to wait and pray about this and make sure that we have the truth it's a love of truth whether it's doctrinal truth whether it's in the bible whether it is and even if it's the truth about your condition you're hiding something in your life and the truth comes and exposes you if you're hiding it and you're doing it then that's the truth and because you're a lover of truth you'll find an alter and repent god i've been exposed it's the truth i'm backslidden i'm away from you you've got to admit it's true to get anywhere but then you grab on to the other truth that says he that re he that asks forgiveness god's faithful and just to forgive him of his sins then you grab ahold of that truth have i repented god's forgiven me i'm going to stand and go on i'm going to go forward that's the truth and god says he'll fill me god says you'll save me god says to me take me to adoption these are promises these are truths in god you can now that's a holy truth because you're a lover of truth now someone can tell a lie on you there's a power i'm good i'm doing good here it's 12 40. um i got the time is fine all right i'm amazed how quickly i'm moving through this i know you're not amazed at but i'm amazed at it it's incredible a lie has power in it to bind you and put a cloud over you and a lying it's not just satan tells lies on you but there's a power satan's power that goes with a lie that's been told on you that binds you and sometimes for years people are bound i've i've talked to sisters and brothers that something was said from their daddy or their mommy when they were a little kid and that thing hangs right with them we got some sitting here i would never mention their names but they've been destroyed in their confidence because daddy put a cloud over their lives so you'll never be anything you're you're not nothing you're just this and play favorites with the kids and all that happens in a lot of families it's not just that it's lies that satan has told on you through someone else but the cloud that you live under something always starts somewhere and you're bound by that now there was a woman in the um the only film that we have i think of of brother branham is the deep call to the deep and if you watch it in there you'll see a woman coming up all nervous and she's got health problems and she's she's just shaking a bit i think if i remember that it's been a while since i've seen it but she comes up and the the problem with her after it was revealed by the holy spirit was not just their physical problems or nervousness it came from somewhere and what it came from is he says he says i know what it was and brother brandon gets stern with his i know what's happened god showed me somebody's total lie on you sister somebody told a lie on you so her nervousness her physical condition all these things happening to her began with the power of a lie that she was believing about herself and she'd been under it for years and now under the presence of god there's a victory coming because god's going to bring the truth to this woman and i love it in the film i do remember this party it says satan say someone's to lie someone said you're a witch and she was a woman of god i can't remember what she did for the lord but they said they've called somebody's called you a witch isn't that true and she starts to break down it's exactly the truth someone years ago had called her a witch now she comes she's broken down and she realizes that that's where this lies started that's where i'm bound that's why i'm coming down that's why i'm being defeated and once she realizes it then he looks and he points that finger sister you go in grace and believe in god you he looks her in the eye you are not a witch i love that part you are not a witch that's a license go in victory go serving the lord you are not a witch she was believing it but it was a lie but if lies have power over us remember the other sister all nervous all these other things and trying to get a hold she'd been to other preachers and her nervousness said well you got doubles you've got 10 doubles you got 12 devils i'm going quickly through the story and all these preachers have said you got different devils and she come to blood right and says i really don't know how many devils i have but i got some devils because preachers told me i have devils and after he sat in the room with her he realized she was going through menopause and at the end of it he says you don't have any devils at all and she said but but what about the the thing she's so scared she's calling it the thing it's like there is no thing you're going through a time of life which any sisters that go through that you can feel pretty upset and pretty squirrely i can't find the right word i'm not going to try to say it because i've never been through it i only have been around sisters who have and i don't want to laugh at it even okay it's not funny it's a real thing but you can feel a lot of things you can feel defeated christian you can feel everybody's against you you can feel people are gossiping about you when there's nobody gospel you can just have a devil's talking to you like crazy and and women hit it a lot sooner these days brother brown said than you imagine yep i'd advise you to just settle down you saw don't try to do a lot of things enjoy your life enjoy your grandkids and maybe not say a whole lot why am i giving advice for menopause why am i doing that but if you hit it i mean you better pray hopefully you have an understanding husband but brother brown was very supportive of the women who go through it because it's real but you know what he told this woman he said she said what about the the thing he said you don't have any devil's sister don't you know you're going through the time of life every woman goes through it she said well what do i need to do he said go home clean your house because he said her house he must have seen that in the vision or something her house was a mess go home clean up your house serve your husband and make your husband a big apple pie just staggering counsel you know she's if she's amongst the pentecostals she's looking for you fast for three weeks sister you get to that tent meeting you get to that camp just go home and get back into your life get back into the flow of things serve the lord make your husband a big pie sweetie i just realized that's good counsel i like that quote see i know my wife what she's thinking right now she's saying you don't need any apple pie that's like the last thing you need sweetie but i'm holding on to that quote i'm going to be quoting that to you this week pull it up on the phone and text it to you but that's not the biggest part he said that's astounding for him to give that advice astounding scott in simplicity and you know friends let me say something this was churning on me this morning i said to my wife and last night i said paul said i fear lest by any means you would be beguiled like eve i've talked about eve this morning paul feared that their that their minds would be taken from the simplicity in jesus christ and i feel there's a lot of confusion even in our ranks the young people get confused i'm saying this i don't even know if i'll let this out but i'm saying there's a lot of confusing things that happen sometimes even in our ranks but let's not forget that satan's work to make divide to make kids confused to make young people confused god is not the author of confusion and if we can have one resolve amen amen if we could have one resolve in our heart that we latch a hold of the simplicity that is in jesus christ you say well the message the message to me the message is the simplicity in christ it's people who have made it complicated god sent back his simplicity after 2 000 years of denominations confusing people misdirecting people god sends a message to bring back the simplicity of christ the simplicity of calvary the power of calvary pouring the holy ghost back into the church that we just serve god in truth every day say well what if i'm not doing this right what if i'm doing that right stay in truth stay following truth and the power of god will change your life what if i come from his background and i don't feel worthy stay in truth he'll tell you you're worthy by the cross of jesus christ i'm only interested in one thing and that's what god said about me not what the devil said about me not what you say about me what did god say about me because that's the truth hallelujah i fear that god that satan would pervert and subtly change your minds and mess with your minds and he said i'm the simplicity he said that you would be taken from the simplicity i'm i'm paraphrasing the scripture the simplicity in gene how many want the simplicity in jesus christ such confusion sometimes but i just want to serve the lord i mean i tell you i just lately i don't want to be involved in all the the drama i just think satan is because he's the you know he's probably the originator of soap operas that didn't come from god so if he come up with soap operas the days of our lives and as the stomach turns or whatever it's called if satan come up that doesn't come from god comes from hollywood which goes back to satan soap operas then if he's the author of it he tries to bring soap operas into church drama yes i am so tired of it i just want to serve the lord i want to love truth and i'll wait till the truth comes out because god always bring the truth out i dealt with two or three or four situations recently still dealing with some of them very private situations and they're so tedious that i just said lord i don't really know how to take a next step on this but these these are lies that has been told and i could have jumped on it really quick but i just said we're going to wait because of this principle i'm teaching you truth truth will always come out and if we jump in and fight too quickly to defend ourselves or defend anybody else we can kind of ruin it because you don't need to vindicate yourself because truth has a way of vindicating itself over time and it comes out and i'm so excited because there's one situation to me the truth the truth is going to be told and i'm rejoicing in that if you jump onto things too quickly and you fight back let the lord fight your battles let the lord be the defender let the lord defend you can you say amen vengeance is mine saith the lord don't take it into your own hands but i want us i just want to be a lover of truth there's a scripture that i want to close on here that speaks my heart above all things today psalms 119 verse 29 psalms 119 verse 29 how many believe we should be lovers of truth and we should have the patience to protrude excuse me patience to pursue truth in our whole life whatever it is pursuing truth in god's word pursuing truth with other people wait truth is our channel and escape out of horrible situations we should be lovers of truth but look at this scripture psalms 1 19 29 remove from me remove from me the way of lying remove from me how many would share my desire this morning i'm only interested in one thing that's the truth remove from me the way of lying because we're living in the age of lying and grant me by law graciously and then the next one says next scripture i have chosen the way of truth judgments have i laid before me i have chosen the way of truth i'm going to hear things people will say things people will peg things on me people will peg things on you people will put me in a certain category truth will be hard sometimes truth will convict sometimes truth will embarrass sometimes but even if it embarrasses it's always the best way i didn't finish my story didn't i you know what the last powerful thing brother brahman said to that woman good thing i remembered this you know what he said to her go make him a pie he quotes the scripture that jesus said ye shall know the truth and the truth will set you free because in that brother brahms says when i told her the truth he said she began to settle down he said she hadn't ate in days and he said to her she began to settle down as soon as he exposed the enemies that you don't have demons he said i noticed are you a little hungry said she said yeah i'm hungry now. and she starts to smell the food that his wife said we'll go in and have something to eat start to settle down on our nerves and his last thing you see you shall know the truth brothers and sisters you shall know the truth and the truth will make you free i'm wrapping this up by saying relationships only really work when there's a pursuit of truth and willingness to be patient for truth to come out truth will be vindicated every time truth will always speak for itself truth will always be truth it'll never change and it will show itself as truth truth is marching on can you say amen truth is marching on i told you a few months ago i'm going to bring up again you can stand with me there was somebody in the in the news or something i seen on my phone in the news and it was this man black man who was in prison for i it had to be at least 30 years and somebody when i told you sorry you remember it i think he was some arkansas or somewhere there and he was in prison for 30 years and all that time he knew that he was not guilty of the crime that he committed that he they said he committed and the court went through and he was guilty and all of that see sometimes you can have a court and the court doesn't come up with the right resolution people can have a court against you and sometimes they don't come out with the truth but god god knows the truth and it was so neat to watch this guy because some lawyer began to look at the case after 30 40 years and she looked at it she did some research she began to uncover some things and found out that guy was innocent he never did any of it can you imagine living for 30 40 years knowing in your heart what the truth was and not being able to because you put it been put under a lie from somebody that long and bound by a lie and i just loved watching the video of how he was acting when he began to find out i'm going i seen the video when he's going to the court case and it looked pretty good he was going to get he was going to get free and sure enough he had it and i seen the video coming coming out of that he he i don't know if he's a christian but he
