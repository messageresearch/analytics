you Lord Jesus thank you Lord amen Leviticus 23 verse 1 says and the Lord spake unto Moses Moes saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them concerning the Feast of the Lord which ye shall Proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my Feast so they're holy convocations I want you to remember that term God calls these Feast holy convocations even these that are my feasts six days shall work shall work be done but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest a holy convocation youu you shall do no work therein it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings these are the feasts of the Lord even holy convocations which ye shall Proclaim in their season I didn't realize till today that when I speak about the Holy con uh convocations that God has here he called them holy convocations he called these seven feasts that he said that would be three times a year the children of Israel would come and visit Jerusalem three times a year and there would be a celebration there would be a feast and every one of these feasts are different the first three happened together and then just a little while after the fourth one happened and then later in the season in the fall they would come back for the last three but three uh they had to visit Jerusalem and come for these these celebrations and these things that a acknowledged God and what God was doing got what God did and so now I didn't realize uh when it was speaking about convoca convocation I thought it was like our modern day graduation but I realized there's a different difference between a convocation and a graduation and I'm going to get to that in a little bit so we know the difference between a convocation that's the term God is using here and a graduation so it's uh graduations are pretty exciting and those that are graduating it's it's means that you finish something and there's celebrations for that and there's appreciations for it there's an event you attend the event and uh but but the convocation is something much much deeper has a deeper meaning than just the graduation ation and so this will be spilling over tonight a little bit from my theme that I had on Sunday and that is that we must be personally connected to what Calvary did for you every believer every young person every person must have a personal connection with what Calvary means to you and what he did for you at the cross less it becomes a ritual less it becomes a tradition and uh so we don't want that to happen so there must be a personal connection and there must be a feeling of it there must feel that you feel what God has done for you and feel it personally to you and that there's a power that will come in your life because of the sacrifice of Calvary every believer every person needs to have a personal connection with that and so this will spill over into that theme tonight as we talk about those things now I just want to take a moment in couple of these slides and bring back the seven feasts and this will be real basic so everybody even the child can understand it and I want to bring up that first slide and show you and this is I was borrowed this today from somebody because because then I didn't have to do the work of putting them all together and you'll read it in Leviticus 23 um you'll read all these feasts that's where you find it you want to read it on your own and these are the seven feasts that God set up for the children of Israel to come and to uh gather together and to C and every one of these had a meaning to them I think a uh a few of these had the Lamb with it most of these had the lamb where they brought the sacrificial lamb for their sins and the priest would bring it in but these were the biblical he calls them biblical holidays and they have actually become that more and more the Jews still celebrate these things the true Jews and they're holidays they're times set aside just like our American holidays and so there is a meaning behind them and so the first four happened in the spring uh spring days in that season and the first one was the Passover uh and then the second one was the UN Feast of unleavened bread and the third one was the first fruits and then the fourth one was the Feast of Pentecost and every one of these had uh different something similar they did when they come to Jerusalem and then sometimes they had different things they did in each one and if you study them and if you got an open heart every one of them has a meaning every one of them has something significant and every one of them point to Christ and not just Christ it points to Christ in our own lives and so that's the first four and then there's a space of time there that goes to the fall and then the other three are picked up now to me that says to me that you have something happening early on that's a fulfillment and Christ fulfilled them and then you have a space and then at the end time this would be the end time this would be the last days and this fellow said historically these were fulfilled during Jesus first coming he's exactly right these four feasts were had the the spiritual fulfillment of them the Jews did the ritual the Jews did the actual a feast days but there was a fulfillment spiritually that happened in each of these where once the once the spiritual fulfillment was there happening once the true Passover Lamb was there once the true unleavened bread was there once the the resurrection took took place and once there was a Pentecost then you had the spiritual fulfillment you didn't go back and like the Jews are doing today because they don't see the Messiah they're still celebrating the old ritual but once the spiritual thing comes along then you don't go back to the ritual it's kind of like what happens in our lives and that is that once there's a new birth once there's a real New Birth it's not a ritual anymore it's not a duty anymore it's not a dress code anymore can you say Amen something has happened and Christ has become real to you and the message and the word and everything is a manifestation out of you it's not something you're trying to do on the outside I'm supposed to do this these probably people probably thought I got to get to that Jerusalem I'm supposed to do this this is a duty and so they got the family together and got in their minivan three times a year whether they wanted to or not not some years and they did it as a ritual but once the spiritual part took place then it was no longer a ritual it was an experience it was a reality can you say Amen so in the Old Testament they did that but Christ fulfilled all these and then all of a sudden because this speaks of the end time then he says to be fulfilled during the second coming of Christ and he's exactly right because now we go 2,000 years in between this spot this was a year for the Jews so you figure the first three months there and you can look up which months they which dates they uh celebrated and then there's a space of time of about 3 months or four months then it picks up the Feast of trumpets Feast the Feast of atonement and the Feast of Tabernacles so it all speaks to these last three happening at the end time our ears should be perked up because we live in the end time we live in the last days and so we see then that these are the ones that become significant to us because these are already fulfilled now we still sing about Christ's death we still celebrate what he did at the cross we still celebrate the resurrection we we we still celebrate that he's the bread the unleavened bread how many know Christ is those things and we C celebrate the original Pentecost but but traditionally we don't want to keep looking back to that we've got to find the season that God is in right now cuz the same God that fulfilled those feasts right now is ready to fulfill these so once again the Bible says Seasons you have to be in the season there's a lot of Christianity that's still celebrating you know uh in in the in what was done 2,000 years ago and they're still celebrating it but they don't realize prophets being is being fulfilled right now and the same God that fulfilled those feasts now is ready to fulfill these and is already spiritually fulfilling them I don't know what else to say except for as far as on this part it's just I wanted a visual for everybody to be able to see this is what they look like and this is the time span between the first four and the last three first three were fulfilled Christ fulfills all seven he's the Fulfillment of all the seven feasts but he fulfills the first three in his in his body in other words Jesus of Nazareth he fulfills the first three but he fulfills the last four actually in the body of Christ his people amen and how do I know that we may still be looking at these here but I know that it was Christ coming on the day of pentec cost and it was him fulfilling the Feast of Pentecost but what body was he using 120 in the upper room being filled with the Holy Ghost so that day and incidentally if you read Acts chapter 2 and verse one it says and and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they're actually meeting on the day that the Jews were celebrating Pentecost the very day when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were in an upper room and they were praying in one Accord and God fulfilled the spiritual meaning of Pentecost on the very same day that others were going to the ritual God was fulfilling the Fulfillment he was doing it Christ but where was he doing it filling his people with the Holy Ghost here's another way that we know that is that he fulfilled this in his body because this is unleavened bread and unleavened bread is with 11 is sin so there was no sin in this bread that's right okay that means it had to be that body of Christ cuz he's the only one without sin when we come to the Feast of Pentecost in that feast in the Jews they used leaven bread that means sin was in it that means it wasn't the body of Christ it was our body because he filled 120 believers who were born in sin shaped in iniquity and he still saved them still filled them with the Holy Ghost and gave them the Conquering power over sin in their lives so that was leaven bread that's why I know that couldn't have been the actual Body of Christ it was the people of God fulfilling the day of Pentecost and every one of them back in those four happened on the very day that the ritual and the F the the the old holiday was being celebrated God was filling it fulfilling it on the very day and I don't know if I'll get through this scripture but Jesus attended all these Jesus attended the synagogues Jesus went to church that's right Jesus attended and he's he C catch this now he's attending all of these feasts and he's there he's present and yet while he's walking in the door and walking into the temple and around and while he's doing all that he knows in his heart he's the Fulfillment amen he's the Fulfillment of this Feast praise God Amen how be it tonight if we could catch a revelation that when we're coming to church we're not just coming to church that's right amen we're not here to hear a sermon but I want to be the actual fulfillment of what's being pre preached can you say amen I want to be what's being preached I want to live that out I want to be Christ and whatever Feast he's fulfilling whatever God's doing I want to be the manifestation of what God's doing I don't want Church to become a ritual I'm going to talk about that more here in a little bit so that's it I hope that's a good visual for you that's how you kind of see these broken down so if we go to the next one then I broke these down later to realize that Christ is the Fulfillment here's some scriptures that show that Purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us that's the scripture identifies he's the Fulfillment of the feast to Passover so the Feast of unleavened bread is that did Christ fulfill that John 6 I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the Lord how may raise your hand say he's the Fulfillment of that Feast of unleavened bread amen if you don't if you read the Old Testament don't forget now and don't see Christ it's all Christ being revealed okay it goes from the ritual to the reality 1 Corinthians 15:20 but now is Christ risen from the dead Feast of fruits first fruits in the Old Testament means that they had to take whatever crop whatever come out of the ground first whatever was resurrected first they took the first fruits and they gave it as a tithe the first fruit so Christ was the first one that come out of the Grave from the dead that's what it says so he's the Fulfillment of this Feast of first fruits but now has Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept Christ is the Fulfillment of the Feast of first fruits on Resurrection Day He fulfilled that feast and we'll have a part in that when we resurrect someday the Feast of Pentecost acts 2:14 says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is Christ it's not the third person of the Trinity it's Christ Christ was fulfilling the Feast of Pentecost where in the people you Lord so the ritual was over with can you say amen and the reality had come to pass and they were there and Christ was fulfilling it through his people Feast of trumpets Matthew 431 and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other now this is fulfilled every one of these are fulfilled had a fulfillment for the Jews who are God's people and he then he allowed the Gentiles a bride to come in so we have two sides of it going to be see the spiritual fulfillment and that this Feast of trumpets will gather the people from the four corners of the earth that are his people that have been scattered because remember they were pushed out of Jerusalem their Temple was destroyed so they ended up going over Generations around the world but God says I'll use my trumpets to gather the people back into their Homeland again for the purpose of bringing them to the the six feasts and so the purpose of gathering the people together is to bring them back into the home Homeland so he can reveal himself someday to the Jews and they can realize oh we killed our Messiah oh we didn't know they'll mourn for days and they'll come back to what our atonement is not in the blood of BS and goats but are we killed the atonement he was crucified for us and actually the two prophets that come to Israel will give them the revelation of all seven of these feasts and the elect will catch it and say my I've been worshiping under a ritual all these years I realize Christ is the Fulfillment to all these and they will begin to have a Revival again because they realize Christ is fulfilled thankfully the bride is already recognizing these things I'm preaching it to you tonight but one day the Jews are going to catch the same thing the Feast of atonement he gathers them together to the Feast of atonement and not only so but we also joy in God through Lord Jesus Christ by whom we all now have the atonement there's more to there's more scriptures to the atonement there's more scriptures to what the meaning of the atonement is because it doesn't necessarily mean that uh Christ has to die for our sins again he already did but it's coming to the full revelation of what the atonement is the Jews will come to that but the bride is coming to that now true realization and revelation of what Christ did for me at Calvary and what that means to me in life in power in overcoming complexes and overcoming h family habits inherent habits can you say Amen the power of Calvary will dissolve it all that's right amen that's our atonement and if we're not living in our atonement we'll keep keep keep those habits we'll keep those little those flaws and those things that are there we'll hold on to them but the power of Calvary the atonement you got a revelation of it you're going to be released of all these things that you can't overcome yourself lot more scriptures to that but he is the Fulfillment of the Feast of atonement and that's happening that's you want to know the season for this this is happening right now because we've already been gathered we've already been our Feast of trumpets spiritually but now we're we're celebrating and we're worshiping under this Feast we're we're coming to church and we're in the word every day because Lord show me the power more and more of what you've done for me at Calvary and let me live in it in Victory forget this traditional idea that I'm just thinking about some you know some Christ of history let me live in the power and reality of what the cross has done for me and then the last one is the Feast of Tabernacles which is a great study 2 Corinthians 51:4 we know that if our Earth House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens so this is the final Revelation that we will dwell if you go in the Book of Revelations God shall Tabernacle himself with his people that's the final Feast of Tabernacles is that he'll put us back in a millennium and God will his Tabernacle is with men and in men can you say Amen but right now we're catching the Revelation and hearing from our theophanies that we have an eternal body just in the next Dimension that we will go to someday it's a tabernacle not made with hands it's a tabernacle it's another body can you say Amen that Christ has given us it's a part of Christ and we will go to that you talk about celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles we're awful close to a Rapture when we go into another body so you can see by this these things that he fulfills them all now when God speaks of a holy convocation it's not church as usual it's a personal connection with you amen that's right that's a holy convocation and uh in other words this convocation was more important than just the general meetings of his people they had more meaning to it a religious character in other words character was involved I would say that this way is that you can come and attend a congregation and be around the social part of it and develop friendships or not develop friendships whatever you want to do you can enjoy the benefits of all that that's wonderful but I can tell you God wants to have a holy convocation with you personally and if that doesn't happen all the congregational Gatherings will do you no good right amen so when he speaks of this it's more important than just a general meeting it's more important that you just make it to all the camps for the summer you should go to camps Jesus attended there's a scripture that says that as his custom one was he went in the synagogue he attended these things but it wasn't just attending a ritual to him it wasn't just a synagogue to him the word was becoming alive he was the word and it was being manifested in his life it doesn't matter that you make it to all the camps this summer if you're going to go go because Jesus went but you ought to be saying Lord let that camp be a holy convocation for my life praise the Lord they had more meaning to them a holy convocation and I want to say there's a regular meeting of people of God that has happen almost every week for centuries do you realize that they met on the first day of week the early Christians met on the first day to cele C Celebration Church on Sundays has been going on for centuries now there's a general meeting of the people of God but then but then there are significant movements or connections God makes with his people that are above the regular and so these were movements or connections God made with his people above the regular they are spoke of in the Bible these holy complications they are crucial that we catch them and gather around these things spirit St you can come to church and read your Bible your whole life and still not be connecting with Christ or what he is doing now so these were so important and they become even more important after Jesus comes because he comes to bring the spiritual fulfillment of every one of these feasts as I said Israel did them as a law and they acted out these gatherings every year even The Seven Feast become a ritual to them but he didn't intend for that to happen he said I want you to be sober about this I want you to come together and when you come three times a year to Jerusalem I want it to be a holy convocation I want you to know the meaning of what you're doing and I want I want to connect with you I don't want it to be church as usual so I'm bringing this back up what is the difference in a a graduation and a convocation then graduation is a term used to acknowledge that you have met your requirements and you have been approved to graduate from the program convocation refers to the ceremony it's a different ceremony refers to the ceremony where your credential will be conferred and confirm means you are granted or you're bestowed a title a degree a benefit or a right now I'm going to preach because you can go to graduations all day long and if you don't have you haven't been conferred the rights of what that degree has given you you ain't got everything yet this holy convocation is something deeper than a graduation it's something deeper than just coming and celebrating can you say Amen but it's something that it says that grants you it's the convocation refers to the ceremony where the credential will be conferred to you the rights everything will come over to you so if you don't realize that the bride is the final voice to the final age and this Christ that you believe is not some form that's up in the air somewhere it's living in his people and if you don't believe that's the final voice of the final age you don't know your Bible amen cuz it's the spirit and the bride at the last that say come thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting
