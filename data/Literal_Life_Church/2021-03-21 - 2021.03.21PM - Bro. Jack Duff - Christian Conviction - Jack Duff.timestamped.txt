[0:00] um i want to preach a sermon tonight and
[0:03] hopefully this will be something that
[0:04] the youth will be able to identify with
[0:07] something that i was inspired by from a
[0:10] trip that i took to israel
[0:12] a few years ago and something that i saw
[0:14] while i was there and
[0:16] this sermon just kind of developed and
[0:18] um
[0:19] i think i might have only preached it
[0:20] once but i pres i pray tonight that
[0:23] it'll be a blessing to your heart
[0:25] shall we stand and we'll just read just
[0:27] a couple verses
[0:29] from the book of daniel chapter six
[0:32] and again i thank god for my wife my
[0:35] daughter
[0:36] and uh my one of my other daughters had
[0:38] to fly back this afternoon sarah had to
[0:41] go back home
[0:42] she has to be to work tomorrow but i was
[0:44] glad she was able to be here
[0:45] last night and amen the last few days as
[0:47] well as this morning so
[0:49] i trust that god will give her traveling
[0:51] mercies amen
[0:58] all right um daniel 6
[1:02] and i want to start reading at verse 10.
[1:09] it reads now now when
[1:12] daniel knew that the writing was signed
[1:16] he went into his house and his windows
[1:19] being open
[1:20] in his chamber toward jerusalem
[1:23] he kneeled upon his knees three times a
[1:26] day and prayed
[1:27] and gave thanks before his god as he did
[1:31] a fourth time then these men
[1:35] assembled and found daniel praying
[1:40] making supplication before his god then
[1:43] they came
[1:43] near and spake before the king
[1:45] concerning the king's decree
[1:48] has thou not signed a decree that every
[1:51] man that shall ask a petition of any god
[1:53] or man
[1:54] within 30 days save thee o king shall be
[1:57] cast into the den of lions
[1:59] the king answered and said the thing is
[2:02] true
[2:03] according to the law of the medes and
[2:05] persians
[2:06] which altereth not verse 13 then
[2:10] answered they and said before the king
[2:13] that daniel which is of the children of
[2:17] the captivity of judah
[2:20] regardeth not thee uh
[2:23] o o king nor the decree that thou has
[2:26] signed
[2:27] but maketh his petition three times
[2:31] a day shall we just bow in a word of
[2:33] prayer father we thank you for the
[2:34] reading of the word of god
[2:37] may the holy spirit now come and make
[2:39] what we've read
[2:41] applicable to our lives even today lord
[2:44] use the scripture to quicken us
[2:47] and god may you have your way in the
[2:49] service and the preaching of the word
[2:50] that you've had
[2:51] your way in our time of worship be
[2:54] glorified be magnified we take every
[2:55] spirit that's against the spirit of god
[2:57] underneath the control of the holy
[2:58] spirit even right now
[3:00] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[3:04] amen god bless you can be seated our
[3:06] title
[3:07] tonight amen is simply christian
[3:11] conviction amen christian
[3:14] conviction um just want to
[3:18] start us by reading um something here
[3:22] from
[3:22] the message witnesses brother branham
[3:25] preaches this in 1953
[3:27] uh april 5th uh 1953 it says
[3:32] then these children of israel these
[3:35] shadrach and meshach and abednego
[3:39] god's witnesses says god's never been
[3:42] without a witness
[3:44] he always now here i want you to get
[3:46] this real close
[3:47] god has never at any time been without
[3:51] a witness on earth
[3:54] praise god so that means in every
[3:56] generation
[3:57] uh god is going to have at least one
[3:59] person that he can put his finger on and
[4:02] say
[4:02] that's my witness right amen
[4:06] and my encouragement is you be that
[4:08] person
[4:09] that god can say this is my witness
[4:13] glory to god amen he says uh i want you
[4:16] to get this real close
[4:17] god has never at any time been without a
[4:19] witness on earth
[4:20] he always had at least one man
[4:24] he could put his hands on and say that's
[4:26] my witness
[4:27] it's come down to one man
[4:30] one time and job was his only
[4:33] witness now think about that um god's i
[4:37] mean here brother branham's told that
[4:38] god
[4:38] god thought that job was his only
[4:41] witness
[4:42] oh my now job's friends that came and
[4:44] approached him
[4:45] he would make it uh they would make us
[4:47] think that they were more righteous than
[4:49] joke
[4:50] right they were i mean just the way that
[4:52] they were handling job and the way they
[4:53] were talking to them and
[4:55] and everything but but but what god says
[4:57] through his prophet is that job was the
[4:59] only
[4:59] witness at that time and the other thing
[5:02] that we need to know about job's
[5:03] situation is that
[5:04] before job went through the trial
[5:08] there was a conversation that was
[5:10] conducted in heaven
[5:12] amen and it was god himself that asked
[5:15] satan have you considered my servant job
[5:19] and then what i want you to get get from
[5:21] that is that before you go through the
[5:23] trial
[5:24] god has probably already had a
[5:25] conversation about you
[5:27] have you considered this brother have
[5:29] you considered this
[5:30] it's because god has confidence and he
[5:33] knows that you have the strength to make
[5:35] it through
[5:36] whatever it is that's coming your way
[5:38] all things will work together for good
[5:40] because you love
[5:41] god and you are called according to his
[5:44] purpose
[5:45] he says have you considered my servant
[5:47] job he says there's not a righteous one
[5:49] like him
[5:50] on the earth he was god's witness
[5:53] look at this the prophet says it's come
[5:55] down to one man one time and job was his
[5:57] only witness
[5:58] and abraham in the land but god had a
[6:01] witness
[6:02] somebody's going to witness for god
[6:05] somewhere
[6:07] somebody's going to witness for god
[6:09] somewhere now after a while
[6:11] we find out uh what a witness really is
[6:13] of the
[6:14] of this day all right notice these men
[6:17] as they went down there
[6:18] they refused to eat the king's meat
[6:21] drink his wine and they refused to bow
[6:24] to his image
[6:25] they were a genuine true witness of god
[6:29] now brother branham's just talking about
[6:31] the three hebrew boys and you know and
[6:33] um
[6:34] the hebrew boys as they were coming into
[6:36] this land
[6:37] that uh they were not born in uh this
[6:40] was a land of captivity it was a land of
[6:42] bondage
[6:43] that the children israel found
[6:44] themselves in but in the midst of being
[6:47] in this this place the three hebrew boys
[6:49] had a certain level of conviction
[6:52] hallelujah amen and what i want to get
[6:55] you to uh to see conviction
[6:56] is a fixed or firm belief
[7:00] conviction means fixed or firm
[7:03] belief and and it's one thing for your
[7:06] your parents to have conviction
[7:08] but it's another thing when the young
[7:10] people begin to stand up with their own
[7:12] convictions
[7:13] hallelujah it's a fixed or firm belief
[7:16] that no i will
[7:17] not do this and no i will not do that
[7:20] no it's not because mama said noah daddy
[7:23] said no it's because there's something
[7:24] on the inside of me
[7:26] that says no to what the devil's
[7:28] offering me
[7:29] the hebrew boys demonstrated this you
[7:32] know and
[7:32] uh and this quote that brother branham
[7:34] has given us uh they showed that when
[7:36] they were called there
[7:37] uh into the land of babylon uh in a
[7:40] nation that uh
[7:42] again it's a nation where they're
[7:43] experiencing bondage but it come to a
[7:45] point where here they got brought before
[7:47] the king's presence the king said you
[7:49] know what these are some very wise men
[7:51] and
[7:52] and i want to give them some of my food
[7:53] i want to do this and i want to do that
[7:55] and they say uh no we don't want your
[7:57] meat
[7:58] we don't eat that they have certain laws
[8:00] that they were living by
[8:01] as children of israel said we're not
[8:02] going to do that even though we have a
[8:04] certain status
[8:05] in the kingdom we're still not going to
[8:07] accept what you are presenting to us
[8:09] they say now just let us eat the pulse
[8:11] and amen which was vegetables and things
[8:13] of that nature
[8:14] let us eat that and prove us in 10 days
[8:16] to see if we're just as healthy as the
[8:18] other men
[8:19] that are here and and and the the guard
[8:22] allowed them to just the guard accepted
[8:24] the challenge and allowed them to do
[8:25] this
[8:26] and god proved that he was with those
[8:27] hebrew boys but the reason that they did
[8:30] that is because they had a conviction
[8:34] they were still abiding by the laws of
[8:37] god
[8:38] even though they were not in the land
[8:39] that they were born in
[8:41] hallelujah amen it goes to show as the
[8:44] scripture says
[8:45] thy word have i hid in my
[8:48] heart that i might not sin against you
[8:51] and as
[8:51] young people i want to encourage you
[8:53] hide the word of god
[8:54] in your heart because you will be tried
[8:57] on what you believe
[8:58] and you have to be able to stand on your
[9:01] personal convictions
[9:05] it goes on in this quote says then
[9:07] there's something
[9:08] he said in there sometimes a penalty
[9:12] goes with a witness says sometimes a
[9:15] penalty
[9:16] goes with a witness if you if you choose
[9:19] to be a witness sometimes there's going
[9:21] to be a penalty
[9:22] that comes along with that it's not
[9:23] going to be easy all the time
[9:25] right sometimes you're going to have to
[9:27] suffer some things to be a witness
[9:29] for christ there's these sensed in there
[9:31] sometimes a penalty goes with the
[9:33] witness
[9:34] sometimes when you witness with god you
[9:36] have to suffer a little bit
[9:38] hey man he says you remember when mother
[9:40] told you that you couldn't stay around
[9:42] home
[9:43] as long as you read the bible and
[9:45] carried on so you know there
[9:46] uh he's he's using a a a a a situation
[9:49] here where maybe a young person gets
[9:51] kicked out of the house
[9:52] because they're standing for christ this
[9:54] happens everywhere
[9:56] all over the world young people get
[9:57] kicked out of get get kicked out of the
[9:59] the home uh the the song that we sing uh
[10:05] oh lord help me with that uh
[10:08] it'll come to me oh
[10:12] my my my uh the story is there was a man
[10:16] in
[10:16] india oh the song is i have decided
[10:20] to follow jesus i have decided no
[10:23] turning back no turning back
[10:25] the the cross before me of the world
[10:28] behind me no turning back no turning
[10:29] back
[10:30] they said that the way that that song
[10:31] was birthed the way that song was
[10:32] written is because
[10:33] this man had decided that he was going
[10:36] to follow christ and they the
[10:37] the leaders of this tribe say hey if
[10:39] you're going to follow christ i'm going
[10:40] to have to kill your family
[10:42] and now they bring his children before
[10:44] and uh he starts singing a song
[10:46] i have decided to follow jesus i have
[10:48] decided to follow jesus
[10:50] uh no turning back no torment are you
[10:52] sure about your conviction he says yes
[10:54] i'm
[10:54] i'm very sure he says we're going to
[10:55] have to kill your kids all of them die
[10:58] right down the spot he says
[10:59] the cross before me the world behind me
[11:02] the cross before me the world behind me
[11:04] and says okay we got to take your wife
[11:06] next
[11:06] are you sure you want to follow jesus he
[11:08] said yes i'm sure i'm going to follow
[11:10] jesus
[11:10] then they took his wife out and he just
[11:13] you know just burst after verse begin
[11:16] no turning back no turning back no
[11:18] turning back no you know no matter what
[11:19] i got to go through no turning back
[11:22] it says if you're if you're not willing
[11:23] to denounce this we're going to have to
[11:24] take your life as well it says that's
[11:26] fine it's no turning back he had a
[11:29] conviction
[11:30] but his man lost his family lost his
[11:33] wife
[11:33] even lost his own life but after he died
[11:36] the king of that tribe said you know
[11:38] what
[11:38] you know the leader of the tribe he says
[11:40] if this man is willing to give his life
[11:42] for this
[11:43] for for christianity then i want the
[11:45] whole
[11:46] tribe to change and start following
[11:48] christianity
[11:49] because this man was willing to be a
[11:51] witness
[11:53] no turning back no turning back
[11:55] sometimes to be a witness
[11:57] it causes you to suffer
[12:02] the prophet says you remember when
[12:03] mother told you you couldn't stay around
[12:05] home and
[12:06] as long as you read the bible and
[12:07] carried on or some of the neighbors said
[12:09] of the children said at school
[12:11] you was a fanatic it says or something
[12:14] because you were you was a true witness
[12:16] remember on the job how all the men
[12:18] laughed at you because you
[12:19] was a real witness see how on the
[12:21] streets you were made fun of with
[12:23] when you give a testimony but that's a
[12:25] genuine sign of a real true witness
[12:28] god wants witnesses
[12:32] says now some people say i testify in
[12:34] church that's good
[12:36] it says but brother let your light shine
[12:38] in the dark places
[12:40] where it's really needed out in the
[12:42] hedges and the highways
[12:43] in the bar rooms out down on the street
[12:45] everywhere you're at let your light
[12:47] shine as a witness
[12:48] amen noticed in the fiery trial come on
[12:51] and every man that a witness with god
[12:53] will have to go through
[12:54] fiery trials
[12:58] we have to tell it like it is
[13:00] christianity
[13:01] amen there's a cause for us to even be
[13:05] christians
[13:06] christ had to give his life in order for
[13:08] us to be able to accept eternal life
[13:11] hallelujah so it's got to be a cost on
[13:13] our part
[13:14] hallelujah amen in order to serve him
[13:17] and we have to be determined that we're
[13:18] going to stand as witnesses
[13:20] for this day we must have christian
[13:22] conviction
[13:24] it says uh god every man that a witness
[13:28] with god will have to go through fiery
[13:29] trials isn't it strange
[13:31] how god leads his people very strange
[13:34] again conviction is a fixed or
[13:37] firm belief now um i want to just say
[13:42] it seems as the world gets further and
[13:45] further and closer and closer to the
[13:46] coming of the lord further and further
[13:47] along
[13:48] seems our conviction levels are
[13:51] dwindling
[13:52] hallelujah things we would have never
[13:55] done years ago
[13:57] are being done now with no conviction
[14:01] it's the truth anyhow
[14:03] i won't necessarily go through a whole
[14:04] list i'll just make the statement
[14:06] things that amen that would have never
[14:09] been done years ago
[14:10] we seem to do it now with no conviction
[14:13] at all
[14:14] hallelujah uh i want to say this
[14:16] sometimes young people will come from
[14:18] overseas
[14:19] and uh you know they have certain
[14:21] convictions in the countries in which
[14:23] they live but when they get here in this
[14:24] culture they begin to compromise a
[14:27] little bit and their convictions
[14:29] begin to just kind of dwindle and they
[14:31] don't have any conviction anymore
[14:33] and we say this everybody else is doing
[14:35] it see
[14:36] everybody else might not be a true
[14:38] witness but god is looking for one
[14:40] person that will rise up
[14:42] and say i will be your witness
[14:46] you know if god has one witness in your
[14:49] city that one witness will testify
[14:51] their life will testify against
[14:53] everybody else
[14:54] god only needs one
[15:00] i remember uh you know i'll use this as
[15:04] an example something
[15:06] where conviction is dwindling i was i
[15:08] was eating one day at a chick-fil-a
[15:11] and i noticed this um the worker at
[15:13] chick-fil-a
[15:14] see you know uh back in our when i was a
[15:17] younger person
[15:19] we didn't have these devices uh you
[15:21] didn't go to work with this in your
[15:23] pocket
[15:24] that was a that was no you would never
[15:26] be caught talking on the telephone
[15:28] right around the boss you never you
[15:30] never see that happen
[15:31] but now uh as i was at the at the
[15:34] restaurant sitting i saw the young lady
[15:36] sneak out to go take out the garbage now
[15:38] it looked like she was working
[15:40] that she was taking out the garbage but
[15:42] really her purpose for getting to
[15:44] the trash is so she can pull out her
[15:46] phone and start doing certain things on
[15:48] the phone
[15:48] and she's just kind of looking around
[15:49] and saying well who's looking at me you
[15:51] know
[15:51] i don't want to get caught because i
[15:52] might lose my job they'll see that i'm
[15:54] on my phone and i'm not really working
[15:56] see i mean now there was something there
[15:58] telling her that what she was doing was
[15:59] wrong
[16:02] something began to tell her that what
[16:03] she's doing is wrong that's why she's
[16:04] looking around hallelujah
[16:06] many of you hey man you go through
[16:07] certain things like that in your life
[16:09] and you know something in you is telling
[16:10] you that you're doing wrong
[16:11] it's good when you have something in you
[16:14] to tell you that you're doing wrong
[16:16] when you really have a problem is that
[16:18] when that when that thing is not there
[16:20] anymore
[16:21] to tell you that you're doing wrong
[16:22] because you have accepted it as normal
[16:25] behavior
[16:28] we got to have christian conviction
[16:31] there was a time where people would not
[16:33] even take pit paper
[16:35] or a pen from their job
[16:38] because they considered that stealing
[16:42] now young people probably say oh that
[16:44] that's just too much this was the level
[16:46] of conviction right i'm not gonna i
[16:49] didn't buy the paper
[16:51] i didn't buy the pen so why am i taking
[16:54] it from somebody that i
[16:55] did not buy from that was stealing right
[16:58] this was christian conviction i'm
[17:00] talking about maybe 30 years ago 40
[17:02] years ago
[17:03] that was the level of conviction can i
[17:05] go a little further
[17:07] you know brother branham has some
[17:08] conviction his conviction was way
[17:10] up here one time brother branham
[17:15] was crossing the border and he had uh
[17:19] his luggage in the car and the border
[17:22] patrol
[17:22] so happened to ask him say do you have
[17:24] any peanuts or anything in your car
[17:26] he says no i don't i don't have peanuts
[17:27] in my car nope i didn't pack anything so
[17:30] i'm let let's go on he says okay go on
[17:32] through he drove three hours from the
[17:34] border
[17:36] when he got three hours and got to his
[17:38] hotel i'm talking late at night
[17:40] maybe 12 1 o'clock in the morning he
[17:42] arrives at the hotel
[17:44] he starts unpacking the luggage to get
[17:46] into the hotel and at the very
[17:48] bottom of his luggage
[17:51] were peanuts so he told his son
[17:54] now hallelujah how many can really be
[17:57] honest
[17:59] and say that our level conviction i'll
[18:00] be honest i'll be the first one to admit
[18:02] it both hands up
[18:03] god i don't know if my conviction is
[18:05] there right

[18:12] got to go back to the border patrol
[18:14] for what it says i told the man of the
[18:17] border patrol that i didn't have peanuts

[18:30] just to report that i have
[18:33] peanuts not that i stole money not that
[18:36] i have
[18:37] peanuts i told you that i didn't have
[18:39] them and i do
[18:40] have them his level of conviction
[18:44] was something that we all need to have
[18:50] he turned around took the peanuts back
[18:52] and then came three
[18:53] six hours added to the trip
[18:56] that's the level of conviction
[18:58] hallelujah
[19:00] recently uh and i'll just have to be
[19:02] honest because something happened to me
[19:03] i was
[19:04] i was um i went in through the line
[19:07] at chipotle to get something to eat and
[19:10] and i paid for the food
[19:12] and i forgot to tell them i mean i had
[19:14] already eaten and everything was already
[19:16] home
[19:16] and i forgot to tell them that i had um
[19:20] cauliflower rice in there useful to tell
[19:22] them that because they're going to
[19:23] charge you extra money
[19:24] i actually forgot to tell them so i
[19:27] didn't know how to go back
[19:29] and tell them uh i need y'all to charge
[19:31] me
[19:32] a little extra money because i i i did
[19:35] get cauliflower rice
[19:36] and um you didn't charge it for i didn't
[19:38] know how to how
[19:40] how's this going to work when i go back
[19:41] in here they're probably going to look
[19:43] at me and say this guy is really strange
[19:47] but the next time i went in i just told
[19:49] i did i i got cauliflower rice
[19:51] i didn't have it i was paying for when i
[19:54] had before
[19:55] i had cauliflower rice the last time
[19:58] charged me
[20:01] i wanted to get that off my conscience
[20:04] it's
[20:04] only two dollars but i didn't want two
[20:07] dollars to hinder a blessing
[20:11] [Applause]
[20:17] we didn't go certain places because of
[20:19] our convictions
[20:22] we didn't hang out in certain
[20:23] atmospheres
[20:25] because of our convictions
[20:31] we didn't use certain language
[20:34] because of our christian conviction amen
[20:39] we actually didn't even take certain
[20:40] jobs
[20:44] because of our convictions certain
[20:46] careers we wouldn't go
[20:48] into because of our convictions
[20:51] hallelujah we didn't listen to certain
[20:53] music
[20:56] because of our convictions and so we got
[20:58] to keep this level of conviction
[21:00] because we want the presence of god to
[21:02] dwell with us wherever we are
[21:05] hallelujah i remember while i was in
[21:07] israel
[21:09] i was standing in the city of caesarea
[21:13] caesarea philippi i believe it uh no no
[21:16] caesarea just caesarea
[21:18] uh and as i was standing there they had
[21:20] the the palace ruins
[21:22] of herod and our guide that was leading
[21:25] us through
[21:26] uh israel he was telling us he says this
[21:29] is where
[21:30] um gladiators would fight animals
[21:34] and uh and then eventually the
[21:36] gladiators start fighting one another
[21:38] this was the sport of the day
[21:40] and as i was sitting there and listening
[21:42] to what the guy was saying
[21:43] i i recall a particular quote where
[21:45] brother random talked about a man
[21:47] that was a gladiator that refused to do
[21:49] something because of his conviction
[21:52] i want to read this to you in the
[21:53] message the testimony of a true witness
[21:56] brother randall says becky my daughter
[21:57] was reading to me the gladiators the
[21:59] other night
[22:00] said listen to this daddy i cannot at
[22:02] this time i'm sorry i can't
[22:03] call the name but a young christian had
[22:05] been thrown out as a gladiator to fight
[22:07] at the roman
[22:08] arena it says i've stood in that arena
[22:11] praying
[22:11] the old walls are falling in and and
[22:13] when they could set there
[22:15] uh they just loved to see them they had
[22:17] to kill one another
[22:19] god speaking in the old days they just
[22:21] meet one another and kill one another
[22:23] and that was it
[22:24] god was against that
[22:28] god was against that it says in one
[22:31] uh one of the very first signs of
[22:34] christianity
[22:35] i want you to catch this statement one
[22:37] of the very first signs of christianity
[22:40] uh is to refuse to kill a man that's
[22:43] right
[22:44] you can kill him more ways than just
[22:46] sticking him
[22:47] with a knife speaking against his
[22:50] character
[22:51] many ways you can do it
[22:54] it says but this gladiator they turned a
[22:56] loose i mean they turned a lion loose on
[22:59] him
[22:59] and with the strength and power of god
[23:02] he killed that lion with a sword and
[23:04] knife
[23:05] says the people clapped it was gallant
[23:07] they stood up
[23:08] they turned another one loose and they
[23:11] killed it with the sword
[23:12] and they turned a man a loose
[23:16] a great big tall dark african pagan and
[23:19] this christian had to fight him
[23:21] which he didn't want to do but in the
[23:23] fight he knocked the african down
[23:25] had his sword right up over him of
[23:27] course the african said
[23:28] sir kill me quickly so i won't suffer
[23:31] don't torture me kill me quickly
[23:34] the christian threw over his sword took
[23:36] off his armor
[23:37] walked out before the emperor and said
[23:39] emperor i'm a christian
[23:41] and my lord and savior forbids us to
[23:42] take one another's life
[23:44] i'll take the life of a wild beast but
[23:47] not of my brother
[23:51] he says i refuse to kill a man
[23:55] the emperor at the time was
[23:58] pretty upset that this man refused to
[24:00] kill another man he says you're going to
[24:01] defy
[24:02] our laws and the things that we set in
[24:04] place they what we what we want we want
[24:06] to see people die you kill the animals
[24:08] now kill this man
[24:09] he says i'm a christian this was his
[24:12] conviction
[24:13] i'm a christian and i refuse to kill a
[24:15] man thou shalt not kill
[24:16] i'm gonna exercise my right to follow
[24:19] the word of god
[24:22] he says you know what since you won't
[24:23] kill him he
[24:25] told he spoke to the other guy says his
[24:27] opponent get up and kill the christian
[24:29] you know what he did got up and killed a
[24:31] christian and the christian died with
[24:32] his arms
[24:33] outside says god i honor your word
[24:38] he had conviction
[24:42] look at this hallelujah
[24:46] i was um
[24:50] just thinking on this and you know when
[24:53] we think about conviction that we we
[24:54] just don't want to lose it brother
[24:55] branham was talking to a man
[24:57] in this little quote here he's talking
[24:58] to a man and the man was explaining to
[25:01] him what
[25:02] what what conviction is he saying you
[25:03] know what a conscience is he says yeah i
[25:05] think i know he said but what is it to
[25:07] you he says you know a conscience is
[25:08] like
[25:09] four points that's over your heart and
[25:12] it says those four points
[25:14] when something happens and you know
[25:16] something has gone wrong in life it says
[25:17] they they turn
[25:19] and they just kind of it gives you that
[25:21] feeling on the inside
[25:22] it just that conscious is turning it
[25:24] says it says what happens you do
[25:26] something else wrong and
[25:27] maybe you lie about something it turns
[25:28] again
[25:30] it says and and you lie about another
[25:31] thing and it turns again it says
[25:32] eventually it keeps turning
[25:34] until it just kind of cuts a little
[25:35] space in your heart that you don't feel
[25:38] anything anymore
[25:44] brother branham gave the testimony
[25:46] brother billy paul i believe
[25:47] shared this now and i'll share this and
[25:49] i'll move on a little further
[25:50] in this we gotta have christian
[25:52] conviction he talked about
[25:55] you know when we talk about losing
[25:56] conviction there's a story brother
[25:58] brandon brings out about these sisters
[26:00] that were
[26:00] sunday school teachers and um
[26:04] you know they would they would when they
[26:05] were at church they were very
[26:07] righteous very holy but when they got
[26:10] away from
[26:11] church they lost their religion
[26:14] so they got into hotel rooms and and
[26:16] then they would do certain things at the
[26:18] hotels that
[26:18] you know the husband wasn't there
[26:21] parents weren't there they did all kinds
[26:22] of things that were against god's word
[26:24] and they would just run down the hotel
[26:25] room with a bottle of a liquor in one
[26:27] hand and maybe a cigarette another hand
[26:29] they just said
[26:30] yippee this is life brother branham says
[26:33] he pulled one up to the side and said no
[26:34] this is not life this is death
[26:37] this life that you're living is going to
[26:39] lead you to a hell that you don't want
[26:41] to go to
[26:41] they say you say this is death it's not
[26:44] life
[26:44] after they got a hold of him and began
[26:46] to witness to him the conviction set in
[26:50] and they began to make things right with
[26:51] god i want to tell you don't don't uh
[26:54] don't ever get yourself into a situation
[26:56] where you have allowed those four points
[26:58] to turn
[27:00] till you get to a spot where you no
[27:01] longer have any convictions
[27:07] the story of these parents young parents
[27:11] brother branham told the story about
[27:13] them in ohio he's in this message
[27:15] life it says a few days ago down in ohio
[27:18] in a court they said that all children
[27:20] had to be sent to college
[27:22] they they want no illiteracy in ohio
[27:26] and the amish people don't send their
[27:28] children to these modern high schools
[27:30] and they've never had on record of all
[27:32] the amish history
[27:33] of one case of juvenile delinquency it
[27:35] says let them dress
[27:37] different and act different and be
[27:39] peculiar
[27:40] and act and they haven't had no juvenile
[27:42] delinquency
[27:43] not one case on their records of america
[27:46] they don't send them
[27:47] they don't send them to them kinds of
[27:49] places and they pass the law that they
[27:51] had
[27:52] they had they have to go uh their own
[27:55] high schools and colleges
[27:56] it says and the old mother and father
[27:58] was was called in because they didn't
[28:00] send their son
[28:01] and the judge said you'll either send
[28:03] them or you'll serve two years in prison
[28:06] i was in middletown ohio at the time it
[28:08] happened and the father said i refuse to
[28:11] do it sir
[28:12] not for being different but but because
[28:14] that i come to america
[28:16] thinking that this was freedom of
[28:17] religion we don't have no more democracy
[28:20] brother branham says
[28:21] he says freedom of religion he said
[28:23] you'll either abide by
[28:24] our laws or you'll pay the penalty like
[28:27] the rest of them would
[28:28] he said i refuse to send them
[28:32] the judge says so i sent us you and the
[28:34] mother two years
[28:36] in the penitentiary so because he
[28:38] refused to send his kids to the public
[28:39] school he was just gonna homeschool them
[28:41] that was a parent's choice nothing wrong
[28:43] with that but because he refused to do
[28:45] it according to the law
[28:46] this was his conviction they said we're
[28:49] going to sentence you to penitentiary
[28:52] here brother branham say the last flower
[28:54] democracy
[28:55] faded in that courtroom the father got
[28:57] up and said very well
[28:59] i'll spend it to save my son
[29:03] it says i don't want any of your rock
[29:05] and rolls in your nonsense
[29:07] and when he started out the unjust judge
[29:09] tried to
[29:10] justify himself by saying that remember
[29:14] and this is what happens with you know
[29:16] when the devil tries to get you into
[29:17] a certain spot the devil will actually
[29:20] quote scripture
[29:22] to you to try to justify what he's
[29:25] trying to trap you in
[29:26] that's why you have to know the
[29:27] scripture for yourself
[29:30] in order to combat the enemy
[29:33] so so the judge to justify himself he
[29:35] just yells out while they're sending the
[29:37] young
[29:37] this this father to the penitentiary
[29:39] along with his wife
[29:40] he says he says it says remember
[29:45] the scripture says give caesar's what
[29:48] caesars
[29:51] hallelujah and he turned around and his
[29:54] father turned around
[29:56] and he said and and to god was god's
[30:01] that was his conviction say yeah
[30:03] remember to give
[30:04] caesar's what deceivers but the rest of
[30:06] that scripture says give
[30:08] to god was god's and these children that
[30:11] god gave me i gave them back to god
[30:14] hallelujah that was his conviction
[30:17] and because he stood on his conviction
[30:20] they
[30:20] overturned his case
[30:28] we read there in the book of daniel
[30:32] daniel had to stand on his conviction
[30:35] hear these leaders
[30:39] these guys have high ranking positions
[30:44] and but they just had a problem with
[30:47] daniel remember
[30:48] sometimes as a witness we have to suffer
[30:50] things
[30:52] daniel was there and uh
[30:55] amongst all these leaders and you know
[30:57] daniel was already very
[30:58] well liked in the kingdom but daniel had
[31:01] a conviction that he was going to pray
[31:03] three times a day and according to the
[31:04] scripture
[31:05] he always turned towards jerusalem to
[31:06] pray
[31:08] hallelujah because he knew that there
[31:09] was a promise that god gave solomon
[31:11] that if the people were in any kind of
[31:13] condition they just turned towards
[31:15] jerusalem
[31:16] that god would hear the prayer so daniel
[31:18] prayed three times a day
[31:19] underneath that promise well these guys
[31:23] didn't like them
[31:24] they come up with a scheme and i'm gonna
[31:26] tell you young people that's working
[31:27] you go through things in your job where
[31:29] people will begin to scheme against you
[31:32] i am a witness i lost two jobs because
[31:36] people were scheming against me
[31:39] one of my jobs i had 14 years i had rave
[31:42] reviews and everything and and all of a
[31:44] sudden i got a boss that just came
[31:46] up out of nowhere and said we just want
[31:47] to get rid of you took me through
[31:49] everything that
[31:50] that you can imagine hallelujah i had no
[31:53] idea the reason that i was being tried
[31:55] like that on the job is so god could
[31:56] move me to where he really wanted me to
[31:58] be
[31:59] and i want to give you good news tonight
[32:00] if you're having a trial like that on
[32:02] your job don't quit just
[32:03] just get ready god's going to move you
[32:05] to where he wants you to be
[32:13] while daniel's there in the kingdom and
[32:17] this these guys came up with this law
[32:19] that you know if anybody pray to any
[32:21] other god outside of
[32:23] king darius you know they're gonna have
[32:25] to be cast into the lion's den they said
[32:27] you know what we got a plan we're going
[32:28] to get rid of this guy daniel
[32:30] we're tired of him always kind of
[32:32] showing us up
[32:34] here daniel sees the decree has been
[32:37] signed by the king
[32:39] and he knew that the king probably
[32:40] didn't think this through
[32:42] but he signed it anyway because oh look
[32:44] at the glory that i'll get for the next
[32:46] 30 days
[32:47] but didn't realize that he had a really
[32:48] good friend that was going to pray
[32:50] regardless of what the king signed
[32:52] hallelujah glory glory
[32:55] and here here here uh darius has it
[32:57] signed and he's just get you know he's
[32:58] just really thinking about all this
[33:00] adoration all the praise everything he's
[33:02] going to get
[33:02] and then these these leaders they walk
[33:05] around at the sign and daniel sees it
[33:07] sign but daniel does not stop praying
[33:09] daniel goes and
[33:10] not only not only does he not stop
[33:12] praying he
[33:13] opens the windows like he always did
[33:18] i want you to be able to see me here on
[33:20] my knees i
[33:21] i'm not changing because the law has
[33:23] been signed
[33:24] as christians we can't change because
[33:26] certain laws
[33:28] change we have a certain conviction to
[33:30] the word of god
[33:31] and we're going to stay with what the
[33:32] word says
[33:35] we may suffer a little bit for it
[33:39] daniel they're praying and
[33:42] first time of the day second time of the
[33:44] third time that he's still praying and
[33:45] finally these guys say you know wait a
[33:46] minute let's go and tell the king king
[33:48] king king
[33:49] didn't you uh sign a decree saying that
[33:51] if anybody got caught
[33:52] praying you know that uh if they didn't
[33:55] pray to you or pray to this
[33:56] you know it's gonna it's gonna be
[33:58] trouble they gotta go into the lines
[33:59] they say then you sign they say yes sir
[34:00] assange whatever king actually signed
[34:04] it was good as gold couldn't be altered
[34:07] couldn't be changed
[34:09] king said yes i signed he says well you
[34:11] know we you know
[34:12] that daniel i love the way the scripture
[34:15] just kind of
[34:16] puts puts it in those terms that daniel
[34:19] which which
[34:20] daniel not you know the daniel we're
[34:21] talking about that daniel
[34:26] he's still praying three times a day to
[34:27] his god now didn't you say have to go
[34:29] into the lion's den
[34:30] that's exactly what i said and it was at
[34:31] that moment let's pick it up in
[34:33] scripture
[34:34] so at that moment the king began to
[34:35] realize what had happened to him so
[34:37] let's speak it up here
[34:38] in daniel chapter 6
[34:41] oh hallelujah verse 12
[34:45] then they came near and spake before the
[34:46] king concerning the king's decree
[34:48] has to not sign the decree that every
[34:50] man that shall ask a petition of any god
[34:52] or man within 30 days save of thee o
[34:55] king
[34:56] shall be cast into the dead of lions the
[34:57] king answered and said the thing is true
[34:59] according to the law of the means and
[35:01] persians which altereth not
[35:04] then answered they and said before the
[35:06] king that
[35:07] daniel which is of the children of the
[35:10] captivity of judah
[35:11] regard of not the o king nor the decree
[35:14] that thou has signed but maketh
[35:16] his petition three times a day then the
[35:19] king when he heard
[35:20] these words was so displeased with
[35:24] himself
[35:25] and set his heart on daniel to deliver
[35:28] him and he labored to the going down of
[35:30] the sun to deliver him
[35:32] this king is trying to figure out how
[35:33] can i get daniel out of this
[35:36] hallelujah glory to god sometimes god
[35:39] will
[35:40] you know give you people that he'll just
[35:42] give favor give you favor in their life
[35:44] they're not even christians but he'll
[35:46] give you favor with those people
[35:48] oh hallelujah glory to god
[35:51] some people appreciate your stand listen
[35:54] he says uh it goes on um verse 15 then
[35:57] these men assembled unto the king and
[35:59] said unto the king
[36:01] know o king that the law of the means
[36:03] and purges is that
[36:04] no decree nor statue which the king
[36:08] established
[36:09] may be changed they're reminding him of
[36:11] what he said
[36:13] what he wrote glory to god verse 16 then
[36:15] the king commanded and they brought
[36:17] daniel
[36:18] and cast him into the den of lions now
[36:20] the king spake and said unto daniel
[36:23] thy god i love this
[36:27] thy god whom thou serve is continually
[36:30] he will deliver thee think about this
[36:33] this man that signed the decree
[36:36] is also encouraging him and let them
[36:38] know i know what your
[36:40] god can do hallelujah i don't even serve
[36:44] your god
[36:44] but i nobody can do and i got confidence
[36:47] that he
[36:48] will deliver you daniel
[36:51] because you're able to stand on your own
[36:52] convictions
[36:55] look at this and a stone was brought and
[36:57] laid upon the mouth
[36:59] of the dead and the king sealed it with
[37:01] his own signet
[37:02] and with the signature of his lords and
[37:04] the purpose that the purpose might not
[37:06] be changed concerning daniel
[37:07] then the king went to his palace and
[37:09] passed the night
[37:10] fasting
[37:14] neither were instruments of music
[37:16] brought before him and his sleep went
[37:18] from him you talking about a man that's
[37:19] up all night praying
[37:21] the king was in that position after he
[37:23] signed his decree but he says i know
[37:25] your god gonna deliver you
[37:26] he couldn't wait for the sun to rise the
[37:28] next morning
[37:29] look at him watch him in scripture now
[37:31] he says then the king rose
[37:32] very early in the morning and went in
[37:36] haste unto the dead of lions
[37:38] and when it came to the dam he cried
[37:40] with a lamentable voice
[37:41] unto daniel and the king's faking said
[37:43] to daniel oh daniel servant of the
[37:45] living god is thy god whom thou serve is
[37:48] continually
[37:48] able to deliver thee from the lions you
[37:51] got to see this guy on the outside of
[37:53] this lion's den
[37:54] crying in a lamentable voice
[37:58] hallelujah look at it then said daniel
[38:01] to the king
[38:03] o king live forever my god
[38:07] you told me that my god was going to
[38:09] deliver i want to tell you how he did it
[38:12] my god have sent his
[38:15] angel and have shut the lion's mouth
[38:18] that they have not
[38:19] hurt me for as much as before him in an
[38:22] innocency
[38:22] was found in me and also before the old
[38:25] king have i done no hurt
[38:27] god made a way for daniel then was the
[38:30] king exceeding glad for him and
[38:32] commanded that they should take
[38:33] daniel up out of the den so daniel was
[38:35] taken up out of there and no man and no
[38:37] man of hurt was found upon him
[38:38] because he believed in his god because
[38:40] of his conviction
[38:41] he was preserved
[38:46] god knows how to turn on his enemies
[38:50] because the lions were still hungry
[38:54] hallelujah and those guys that came up
[38:56] with this scheme would never live again
[38:58] to set up another scheme
[39:00] because when they got when daniel got
[39:02] released they received a prison sentence
[39:05] and they went into the den of alliance
[39:07] and lost their lives
[39:08] god knows how to turn things around all
[39:10] you have to do is stand
[39:12] upon your convictions
[39:15] hallelujah
[39:19] let me just uh
[39:22] read you a couple other things here and
[39:26] oh my the message the uncertain sound
[39:30] it says daniel went in without any
[39:32] uncertainty
[39:34] god is able to deliver me from them lot
[39:36] from the lions but they threw him
[39:38] and but they threw him in the fire
[39:39] furnace and i believe when them lions
[39:41] started up there
[39:42] they look at him there's still a halo of
[39:44] fire
[39:45] around daniel any animal is scared of
[39:49] fire
[39:49] you know that those lions backed off
[39:51] what was it the hidden power
[39:54] that was in daniel's heart came come out
[39:57] and clothe him all over you actually
[40:00] have a hidden power in your heart
[40:02] it's the holy spirit and when you're
[40:04] going through trial when you're
[40:05] suffering a little bit it'll come
[40:07] out and be your protection
[40:10] he says it was it was that hidden power
[40:12] that blessing of god
[40:13] that was upon the prophet's life that
[40:14] and surrounded him with the flaming fire
[40:16] like down at dothan that day when gehazi
[40:18] looked and saw
[40:19] what was around elijah angels of fire
[40:21] chairs and fire there that hidden power
[40:24] was around daniel there's a story one
[40:28] time of
[40:29] some martyrs there's 40 of them
[40:33] and they told him so if you're going to
[40:34] denounce christ if you won't denounce
[40:36] christ we're going to have to throw you
[40:37] in this freezing water
[40:39] and they would die by being frozen to
[40:40] death
[40:42] and they just one 40 of them stood there
[40:44] and soldiers
[40:46] carried them out to be martyred and and
[40:48] um
[40:49] the first one said are you going to
[40:50] denounce christ no
[40:52] threw him in the water he died instantly
[40:54] second one comes up you're gonna
[40:55] denounce christ
[40:56] no threw him in the water he died
[40:58] instantly third one comes up fourth one
[41:00] comes up
[41:01] everyone no no no they died instantly
[41:04] when they get to the 40th one so you're
[41:07] going to announce christ
[41:08] yes he watched everybody else die say i
[41:11] don't want to die like that
[41:12] i denounce christ right now he says okay
[41:14] you're free you can go on back to do
[41:16] whatever you were doing
[41:17] well there was a soldier that saw him he
[41:19] says
[41:21] start taking off his gear and his sword
[41:24] and shield and laying it down and taking
[41:26] off everything
[41:28] and it says it was 40 that came and i'm
[41:30] gonna be the 40th
[41:33] i'm going to accept christ and i'm
[41:35] willing to die with these others right
[41:37] now
[41:38] so you got to have a conviction
[41:42] no matter what's going on around you you
[41:43] got to keep that conviction
[41:46] no matter where you find yourself
[41:50] keep that conviction
[41:54] while i was in israel
[42:00] they took us to
[42:03] um like a museum
[42:07] and uh at this museum where a lot of
[42:10] military
[42:11] airplanes and things like that so they
[42:12] had military people there stationed at
[42:14] this museum
[42:16] just kind of watching over everything
[42:19] and the first time i went to israel
[42:23] they gave us a tour guide and and and in
[42:26] israel what happens is when you turn i
[42:27] believe that age

[42:40] the military
[42:40] at the age of 18 boy or girl didn't
[42:43] matter
[42:44] so they gave us this tour guide and
[42:45] we're seeing all these soldiers walking
[42:47] around and they got guns and everything
[42:49] and

[43:27] that really spoke volumes i i it was
[43:30] really hard to focus on the tour

[43:38] tour just everybody noticed this
[43:40] this soldier coming out here with a
[43:42] skirt so uh

[43:54] district and we went shopping and
[43:56] and uh and abigail happened to be
[43:58] walking through the district
[43:59] with her skirt we knew who it was hey

[44:18] is what we believe that
[44:20] women are supposed to suppose excursions
[44:21] said but you're in the military
[44:23] says well this is what we told them this
[44:24] was our conviction
[44:26] we don't mind serving in the military to
[44:28] do our duty to the nation
[44:29] but if we're going to do it we have to
[44:31] stand on our convictions you got to
[44:32] allow us
[44:33] to wear our skirts
[44:37] they agreed to do it so i went back a
[44:40] second time and i told my wife and some
[44:42] of the others that whitman said there's
[44:43] this girl abigail

[44:51] and she was there
[44:52] in a skirt well when we get there this
[44:54] time it wasn't just
[44:56] abigail in the skirt there were other
[44:58] young ladies in the military
[45:00] and skirts one person could change a
[45:03] whole
[45:04] number of them god only needs one
[45:06] witness
[45:07] that young lady was standing on her
[45:10] conviction
[45:11] even in the military
[45:13] [Music]
[45:17] god needs young people like that
[45:20] abigail doesn't even know anything about
[45:22] this message that we know about
[45:24] but she had enough in her to say i want
[45:26] to follow my convictions
[45:29] even in my job
[45:32] i want to follow my convictions
[45:35] god needs young people to be the same
[45:37] way i don't care what career god blesses
[45:39] you with remember it's the blessing of
[45:41] god
[45:42] but hold to your convictions not what
[45:44] mama said well my mom won't let me do
[45:46] this
[45:46] my dad won't no no no your own personal
[45:49] convictions because you see it in the
[45:50] word of god
[45:53] let me read a couple more things and i'm
[45:54] going to wind this up
[45:58] and god's provided place of worship
[46:00] brother branham said we find that in
[46:01] each age when god said a certain thing
[46:03] would happen
[46:04] here come that man along and manifested
[46:06] that here come their people
[46:07] alone and live that that was god himself
[46:11] living in the people because it was an
[46:13] answering to his word
[46:15] see we live the way that we live because
[46:16] we're answering back to god's word
[46:19] amen now god's only provided way and
[46:21] only provided plan today is his son
[46:23] through his word for this age quickened
[46:24] by the spirit
[46:25] of his life quicken now there's a
[46:27] statement made by charles finney
[46:31] and charles fenney says revival
[46:35] this is his statement about revival says
[46:37] revival is a renewed
[46:40] conviction amen
[46:44] that's what we need just a renewed
[46:48] conviction you see there were things
[46:52] that we
[46:53] the holy spirit used to deal with us
[46:54] about years ago now we just let it just
[46:56] kind of
[46:58] it's okay but no god wants a renewed
[47:01] conviction it says revival is a renewed
[47:05] conviction of sin and repentance
[47:07] followed by an intense desire
[47:11] to live in obedience to god
[47:14] so so what after god washes you and
[47:17] cleans you up
[47:18] and does all these things what follows
[47:20] that is a intense
[47:22] desire to live in obedience to god
[47:26] it's giving up one's will to god in deep
[47:30] humility brother branham says this in
[47:34] the message the presence of god
[47:36] unrecognized
[47:38] says i watched i watched one time at the
[47:40] seashore
[47:42] where wind was blowing and it was just
[47:45] shaking
[47:46] why it wasn't a seashore it was up at
[47:49] lake michigan
[47:51] i was standing out there watching the
[47:53] waves as they would come in
[47:54] and oh that sea was a jumping and all
[47:57] the waters are jumping
[47:58] and the boats are rocking and i thought
[48:00] what is that going on i thought
[48:02] why the lake is having a revival
[48:06] that that's it is jumping and shaking
[48:09] why
[48:09] there's a rushing mighty wind coming
[48:11] down on it i thought
[48:12] well you know what there isn't one more
[48:14] drop of water in it right now
[48:17] than what it was when it was perfectly
[48:19] still
[48:21] he says no more water in it it's just
[48:22] all stirred up well now
[48:24] what's stirred up about it says you know
[48:26] what a stirring up of the water does
[48:29] washes all the trash out of it
[48:34] up on the bank and that's where we want
[48:36] the trash
[48:38] up on the bank not in our hearts not in
[48:40] our lives let's
[48:41] let the trash go up on the bank
[48:44] he says that's what we need a washing of
[48:47] unbelief
[48:48] out on the bank let the word of god have
[48:51] preeminence
[48:52] that's what we need a revival
[48:56] a wash all the unbelief out in all the
[48:58] bugs and superstitions and things
[49:00] come out and see that god is still god
[49:04] that's what we have revivals for
[49:12] i believe god wants to send somebody
[49:14] their own personal revival
[49:17] i believe god wants to remind us that he
[49:19] wants us to live
[49:20] such pure and unadulterated and clean
[49:22] lines before him
[49:23] and this is not a life because mom and
[49:26] daddy
[49:27] want us to do it but it's a life because
[49:30] god
[49:30] himself has dealt with our hearts and we
[49:33] have our own personal conviction
[49:37] i don't know what you're facing or what
[49:38] you're going through but i know god
[49:40] still wants to be god and he wants to be
[49:42] in control of your life
[49:44] and god wants the heart that is
[49:45] surrendered to him
[49:50] i pray that god will provide that
[49:51] revival
[49:53] the renewed conviction in every heart
[49:56] tonight
[49:58] as the musicians come let's pray
[50:12] i didn't ask the pastor this but i just
[50:14] feel led of the spirit to do it

[51:03] fall on the ground and return void
