TRANSCRIPT
========================================
just something in my study of Esther that I've really caught my attention and I felt like is is important to set the scene for where I want to go with Esther So Daniel chapter 10 and I just pray the Lord will help us tie in everything and if you're in the back I don't know if you guys I'll let you decide if you want to put the scripture up or if you want to put my first slide it's up to you Daniel chapter 10 and verse 10. are you happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen so be maybe a little bit more of a teaching but I'll try not to bore you too much and we'll just keep clipping along and and believe that the Lord will will feed you tonight Daniel 10 10. and this is starting as as I believe Daniel's in a vision and behold a hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands and he said unto me o Daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that I speak unto thee and stand upright For unto thee and my now sin and when he had spoken this word unto me I stood trembling then said he unto me fear not Daniel for from the first day that thou did a set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy God thy words were heard and I am come for thy words so if you remember I think this is 21 days and I thought it was 21 days and another spot when I read it I thought maybe it was 24 doesn't matter it was longer than a day and we're not used to that as Americans are we and I am come for thy words but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one in 21 in 20 days 21 days there it is but Lo Michael one of the chief princes came to help me and I remain there with the kings of Persia now I want you to catch that now so first in verse 13 at the beginning we have but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one in 20 days and then he says uh Michael one of the chief princes came to help me and I remained there with the kings of Persia now this isn't referring I don't believe to physical Kings and a physical Prince this is a spiritual warfare in response to Daniel's prayer these these the Prince of Persia and the kings of Persia were withstanding the angels from getting to to Daniel to meet his need to to minister to him and verse 14 says now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days so as we start in Esther the very first thing you read is is the setting of The Story of where it's taking place and uh for them in the back I'm just going to title this tonight Esther and Sousa Persia Esther and Susa Persia and it starts describing the kingdom just a little bit vaguely I think there was some 127 different promises and uh provinces sorry and it's just this vast Kingdom and in the Persian Empire in it and as you as you read Esther 1 and it's describing the kingdom that she's going getting ready to it describes the King Xerxes um and and vashti and then what Esther's going to be queen of it describes this very uh illustrious and and ginormous Kingdom and this ginormous Palace Sousa is also called shushan The Palace in the story of Esther um so it's it's all described here and it's and it's in during the the the reign of the Persian and media uh Empire uh media Empire and um it's just interesting to me that before before I think Esther is actually set before the Book of Daniel I think if I'm I'm remembering right in the butt in your Bible but yet Daniel is give is before Esther and he's giving a vision of of the kingdoms that are to come and one of those kingdoms is the Persian median Empire so it's what Esther's going to go into and yet what I what I think is what is just I guess what's striking me so much about this is God giving Daniel a vision of of what's going to come before it happens and I know that's the way God works with prophets but it's just so astounding down to the detail to where I think it was Isaiah who saw also saw this uh unfold and he even names the king who's going to come and take it from Babylon from Nebuchadnezzar Isaiah sees the king and and names him in Prophecy and it happened just exactly so and when you start researching this so this is this is the Mead and Persian Empire um it's it gets a little confusing with you know the Mead and the Persian how they they join that's everyone conquering everybody and they all want a piece of the pie and it ends up being the Pete the medes and Persian Empire so that's about my extent of my knowledge of it through all the studying that I've done but uh actually Brother Kyle told me that what you see right here in this outline kind of the the little bit orange or outline is actually just slightly less than the size of the United States so um so we see how vast and how big this was and then I I don't know if I have the scriptures in here but just describing this further it was uh yeah it's next so Daniel chapter 8 and verse 2. let me see what my next slide is here okay let's hold on to that Daniel chapter eight and if you want to keep your Bibles handy I'm going to be referring to a lot of scriptures tonight Daniel chapter 8 and verse 2. and says and I saw in a vision and it came to pass when I saw that I was in shushan in the palace which is in the province of Elam and I saw in a vision and I was by the river uh ulai and and again I maybe I'm just a nerd but this is fascinating he he sees this Vision in shushan the palace this is where Esther's going to be and this is I want to say it's about 200 years it's little little between 100 100 and like 130 years probably 140 years before that Daniel's seeing this then I lifted up my eyes verse 3 and Saul and behold there stood before me the river uh before the river a ram which had two horns and the two horns were high but one was higher than the other and the higher came up last I saw the ram pushing Westward and northward and Southward so that no Beast might stand before him neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand but he did according to his will and became great so what these two horns represent here is actually like I told you it's I believe it started as the medes they started destroying people and taking land and then the Persians came and said hey we own you now and so you have a little horn the Meads and then you have a greater horn rise up the Persians and it becomes the meat and Persian Empire so that's why there's the two horns but the Persian is the greater it's it just becomes this huge vast Kingdom are you following me so far okay this might might make sense today but if you come back on January 1st then it'll maybe I'll make more sense so this is a little bit of background of the Persian Empire and if you want to go ahead and stick um let's go ahead and stick those other slides back up though modern uh Persia is actually Modern Day Iran uh or what I guess came to be it was a Global Hub of culture religion the Global Hub of culture religion science art and technology for more than 200 years so the Mead's Persian Empire went about 200 years I believe it was if I'm you know everything I'm understanding and it became a hub and and again I want to tie I want to tie Esther with our day and as I do that as I'm reading this I'm seeing that this describes the United States so if you watch what Esther's going through this is the same thing to me as what is is the culture that's surrounding us it's it's the the nation that we live in Persia actually became the world's first superpower this median Persian Empire there wasn't a superpower they didn't really use that term until the Persian Empire it was the largest Empire of its time uh I largest Empire of its time I'll just leave it at that unified through introducing a standard currency they did weights and measures they made an official language and they they built a lot of big and vast roads it was the first people to establish uh regular routes of communication between three continents Africa Asia and Europe and they built many New Roads and developed the world's first postal system so you see how this this nation this Kingdom this culture is just it's just advancing they each King that came up in the Persian Empire each one made it that much bigger that much wealthier and and that much stronger ah the main religion was um it sounds like Zorro Zorro is as strainism one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions the Kings ruled by the uh zoroastrian law of Asha which means truth and righteousness he um and it wasn't imposed necessarily upon the people um they let the people keep their own religions okay so you have this one uh vast great superpower and they kind of have their own religion but everybody can have their own religion so you start just building uh you know however many hundreds of thousands of religions we have today probably let alone just in the United States and you see the Persian Empire had had the same thing it was just this this thing that they were building this this power this Beast as we find in Daniel uh Hebrew scripture Praises Cyrus the Great for freeing the Jewish people of Babylon from captivity and allowing them to return to Jerusalem again he's got his own religion but it was just for some reason the people they conquered they let them have their own ways one of the great beliefs of this religion is is fire along with water are seen as symbols of purity uh this religion uh places of worship are called sometimes called fire temples each Fire temple contains an altar with an eternal flame that birds continuously and is never extinguished now I don't want to offend anybody but if you go and you find the Catholics and the and I believe it's Catholic I know it's Lutheran they have a flame burning up at the behind the Altar and that flame is is like an eternal flame as long as that Flame's burning they believe that the holy spirit's there according to Legend three ancient uh fire temples known as the great fires were said to have come directly from the zoroastrian god ahura Mazda which is actually what the Japanese named the Mazda car after which is interesting at the beginning of time archaeologists have searched for these places it's unclear whether they ever existed but it's or whether it's purely uh mythical so it's just interesting because it starts to blend a little bit into to me take it for what it's worth almost into a Catholicism okay because now we have we've got three temples now it's monotheistic but yet they start introducing other gods the the uh the gentleman who founded it is is his name it's named after him um they kind of look to him as a God but yet and then they have Idols this Idol of this man with a son it just gets crazy but supposedly it's monotheistic so bear with me a little bit longer uh so they gave they gave their dead Sky burials they built a circular flat top Towers called uh I can't pronounce that or towers of Silence their corpses were exposed to the elements and local vultures until the bones were picked clean and bleached and then they placed them and and collected lime pits uh so this is all this Persian vast Persian median Empire and this is what Esther is thrust into in the story of Esther this is what she she enters into now Israel has been under bondage from Daniel remember Daniel's taking the three Hebrew children they're under um Babylon Rule and then the medes in Persian take them so if we go to this slide here you'll recognize this and this is put in I think two or three of the visions of Daniel together but the first vision is Nebuchadnezzar sees this remember Daniel interprets it as the the statue of gold and each of these Empires I want to get into the because Daniel says that the Prince of Persia and and so to me this is the spiritual realm this is spiritual fighting going on so there's Spirits upon that nation and their Spirits upon every nation and every Kingdom and so each of these and I'm quoting now without uh giving you the direct quote but each of these kingdoms Babylon meets Persia Greece and Rome each of them exhibit the nature of the metal that they're made out of okay and so gold is the softest metal and as you go down it becomes more and more Fierce more and more strength to it in each metal and so if you move over to another Vision that um Daniel sees he sees the the lion with the wings of an eagle and and that's the Babylonian Empire well when the medes in Persian come and take it Daniel sees that the the eagle's wings are plucked off the Lion's back and and uh you know the lion loses its power and then this bear comes up and he's got three ribs and this is just this is fascinating to me because when you get into the prophets of the Bible and how maybe they didn't know exactly what they were seeing but with Daniel each Vision he he saw he's asking for the interpretation and there's the angel giving him the interpretation so this bear is is a great strength and the three ribs in its mouth historians believe are the Babylonian the medes and the Persian Empires that you know they everyone fighting taking everybody's power so you just see the the accuracy of the vision of a prophet amen and then so on and so forth and and of course the last Beast uh the Roman is is the you know great a Great Dragon and it's it's uh Daniel describes it as a troubling Beast because it's the power is so great and it's so diverse then you have the the RAM and as we read the the two horns on the ram the one smaller the one larger so but the natures of these kingdoms coming down is is the nature of of the metal they're made out of and so silver is obviously not the the hardest metal but it's a stronger metal and so Esther's being raised up in this and she's being raised up in this this uh so-called religious and and diverse and and uh ever expanding wealthy Kingdom and this is what Esther's growing up in so as as I was reading Esther I started thinking well what's the what's the spirit of what's the spirit of that Nation what would the what would the spirit of that Nation look like there was a hierarchy of Elites who hold the power it was it was a a a king or uh yeah a king and under that King there was nobleman and princes set up over all of these vast provinces uh so it'd be like the United States we got the president and then you got all the governors of all the states and they they were the elites they held the power they hold the wealth and it sounds just like today it was a very rich and glorious Kingdom there was a spirit on this Kingdom of expensive party the king wasn't just saying you know hey let's party he was bringing out the best of everything he got everything just the drapery the the fine Linens the the the gold and silver was just beautiful and and artistic and and uh you know the craftsmanship there was a spirit of great pride that we see on the Persian Empire there was a spirit of excess and what I'm going to say what I'm going to label as addiction and and drunkardness because the king says hey whatever these guys want give them absolutely everything they want to drink Don't Force It on them but don't withhold it from them and it actually says according to the state of the king so this guy must have been drunk off as rocker a spirit of uh heathenism even though it was mono uh you know believed in one God yet you see something very very similar to um you know the Greeks with all of their gods and and dare I say that you know the Catholic church with their Saints and and you know it becomes blurred and yeah we believe in one God but yet he's he's three different persons well no he's not and you know so you get into this Hedonism and and that's what's being described in their religion and it's actually as as uh the words we use today inclusive and and you know people have their freedoms and things yet the medes and Persians held to their laws so tightly that that not even the king when a law was enacted not even the king could change it not even the king could change the law so they were forcing laws and as you see in the story of Esther they actually used those laws force it on others but you see it particularly forced on on God's people and it's trying to control them into ungodly ways and and to the end is destruction because you remember Haman wrote and enacted a law uh tricked the king actually enacted a law and said you know this people we need to wipe them off the face of the Earth they're not they're they're they're trying to overthrow you they have their own government and and so it's trying they're writing laws to try to control the people and and force them into against their religion and force them into destruction it was an age from what I can gather of of beautiful women in a spirit of immodesty I imagine they said you know when in Esther when the the uh the all the women that they take all the young virgins and they're presenting them before the king they do their purification time and then before they go into the king they say you can pick whatever you want to go in well keep in mind that this is the this is they're trying to please the king they want to be Queen so I imagine that they're not dressing the most modest they're dressing to appeal there's a spirit of anger and rage and murder in the Persian Empire the King has a short temper it seems like all the time he's getting mad and he's getting so mad that he has to you know run out of the room because he's so mad uh Haman when Haman gets uh you know he he's he's Mordecai won't bow to him and he gets so angry he comes into his household and he's just he's he's a raging lunatic and you know and what are we gonna do how are we going to fix this what are we going to do to get rid of Mordecai all the way to you know what let's just let's just murder him just murder all the Jews and start building The Gallows for Mordecai it's a spirit of rage and anger and murder it's a spirit of compromise when you look at the history and things the the the the temple is is during um from what I can tell there's a certain part of Queen Esther being there on the throne that the temple is actually being um I think I think it was the wall at the beginning and then the temple at the end and they rebuilding the temple well once the Temple's rebuilt the walls are repaired the city of Jerusalem hey guys it's time to go home we're free to go some of the Jews a lot of the Jews stayed back because they enjoyed the I'm going to call it the laodicean lifestyle the the lukewarm the blending well you know these guys believe in one God anyway so it's not really that bad you know when they when they had the freedom they had the promises that that God said hey you're going home I I I'm giving it back to you you're gonna rebuild this thing and yet they said well you know what we're we're good just just let us stay here so I think these are my last two slides now this this hurt my eyes to look at but I just I just wanted to show you that you have uh Daniel down here at the bottom and just the again my my nerdiness I don't know but you watch how these start overlapping and and I don't know if if these different ones you know heard of each other but I could imagine that if they would have they would have been thrilled to know that there was other believers who believed like them in in such a time as this so you have Daniel here Ezra comes in um the the building of the Temple um let's see Esther's right a little over offset to the middle then you have the rest of the book of Ezra right into Nehemiah and and the return to Jerusalem under Nehemiah so it's it's to me it's just remarkable to see the the prophecy the Fulfillment of Prophecy the the timeline how this stuff starts overlapping and you know if you know your your church ages and your seals you start seeing the you know brother Branham will talk about how they they overlap one with the other a little bit and everything so I I mean to me when I look at this I just see it perfectly I'm not be able to understand it fully and explain it maybe I'm making you confused but it's just maybe the visual and then this scrunches it down just a little bit they don't put Daniel in here I wish they would have but um you know you can see a little bit more zoomed in I guess on the Temple completed the decree of Cyrus and all through that is just amazing I've mentioned it here before how uh you know um Ezra would would raise up and these guys I and I don't know why this is but they're all it's all people who are close to a King it's all people close to a King maybe it's because it's it's types and shadows of our position in Christ we're close to the king and so uh Ezra Nehemiah Esther being Queen um Daniel uh you know it's just again it's just amazing to me but you have men if you go read Ezra you have men coming to the king you know the king says oh yeah you know what you go and go do what's in your heart you know this is the Persian Empire and and they're saying you know you believe that way go ahead go go do it some Kings even saying hey write it write it in the law give them everything they need to fulfill this thing and then somebody raises up to you know uh two two little spiritual you know demons and they say you know hey King these guys are doing bad and so the king says well stop them and then God gives favor again and it rises up and so it's just this back and forth and if and if I can say it without it losing the the importance and and the spiritual aspect of it it's just a battle constantly of Good and Evil and we see that so that's the last slide I have to control up here guys so Esther this is what Esther grew up in this is what Esther becomes queen of and so I just as I was as I was studying this and and just this and I'll just be honest it's pressing on my heart and I don't even know fully how to explain what it is that's pressing but I got to thinking about the spirit of America and I didn't get to go through uh as extensively as I wanted to but again here we find similar traits we find um a spirit of access or of well you have access to you have access to a lot of things that you don't want to have access to or shouldn't but excess you have a spirit of excess of of of drunkenness everybody drinks every you know you go out to a a company lunch and hey guys boss says everyone can have a drink it's like that's the thing that you live for that's the thing that you want to do how much can you drink I've had people say man I great time it was a great time well what what'd you do oh we got drunk I don't even remember the evening sounds like a great time but you know not I I I don't mean to poke fun I shouldn't poke fun because that's that's what they have that's what they have that brings them pleasure they're they're they're actually we've heard it before they're they're missing something they're they're craving something and somehow the the alcohol is what fulfills it or they think fulfills it temporarily the spirit of America is is a spirit of lust and immorality and sexuality it's it's a it's a we we have a spirit of uh you know women worship and we have um a want a spirit of want for entertainment and entertainment not the gospel you know if if you're gonna have me come to church then give me a show not the gospel are you with me tonight are you picking up what I'm laying down we have a spirit of scoffing at the word of God of of scoffing at religion and and you know it it's it's having compassion for these people because there's there's lots of people who have been hurt by religion or who don't understand religion and we don't want religion here it's not religion that we're after we're after we're after Faith we're after Jesus Christ we're after a person not a religion we don't we don't want we don't want members we don't need numbers we want the quality of the spirit of Jesus Christ we want spirit and Truth but the world the spirit of America they don't want that they don't want the truth they don't want you to tell them who they are or or what they are they want to tell that they want to make it up for themselves they we have a spirit of of uh of comfort we have a spirit of comfort in that we have um extravagances we have that excess access we have the Comforts of of living and we become soft from it and then we get comfortable and satisfied with sin it's a spirit of comfortable and satisfaction with sin well that that don't really bother me I can handle that everybody else is doing it it's comfort with extravagance and convenience we have a spirit of self-seeking seeking after temporal fleeting things that have no lasting Joy what what what pleases me right now what makes me happy now we have a spirit of pride and arrogance in this country we have a spirit of uh don't turn me off we have a spirit of insanity and uh mentally unstable it's it's a spirit it's it's a it's a there's an anxiety there's a spirit of anxiety in in the culture around us and listen we have a spirit of irreverence but what I want you to catch is I don't want you to I don't want you to say boy brother Brandon you're making me feel really bad I want you to go back to Daniel and I want you to realize that if Persia had a prince then the United States has a prince and Europe has a prince and France has a prince amen you see the spiritual warfare there's there's There Were King spiritual Kings in Persia that were warring against the spirit and yet in all of that that just a beautiful picture of us there's the beautiful there's there's a there's a Remnant there there's a there's a there's a light in the midst of Darkness that's there and you have these spirits that are fighting but they have to be fighting something and they're fighting against their warring against you they're warring against the spirit of Christ trying to get to you you cry out and you say you know father I'm I'm I'm drowning in the spirit of of excess uh father I'm dealing I feel that Spirit of lust I I feel the doubt sometimes in the word of God I feel that but I know it's not me but yet it's pressing on my mind I I I feel uh Pride I feel arrogance father help me deliver me from that help me out of this thing Lord I Need you and you're crying out and remember that the spirit says I heard you from the first day you lifted your voice I heard you the very moment that you cried out but I got caught up fighting against the spirit of America I got caught up fighting against the prince and power of the air which is the devil in the scripture and yet we have this and I'm clipping along real good so I promise I might even be done in 45 minutes not from now total so you have this Spirit of America you have the spirit of Persia you have you have the spirit that that Esther but if you look at Esther what a beautiful image of the bride of Christ what a beautiful depiction it says that that God is is is not mentioned his name is not mentioned they're not I imagine in the Jewish it would be Yahweh it would be it would be Jehovah and it's not mentioned once in the Book of Esther but yet it's it's one of the most it's one of the most beautiful and moving love stories I've ever seen and if you catch it from the spiritual side it's it's the most beautiful one of the most beautiful depictions of Jesus Christ and his bride a king and a bride an enemy good versus evil you have all of these playing out and yet you have Esther with with a with an atmosphere around her something that when she gets she gets she's it says that even before she's taken she's she's loved she's beautiful she's loved by everybody around her and then she gets taken and and immediately the the the one set above her I believe it's uh pronounced hagai or Hagee eye um the over the concubines and he's in charge of prepping these young virgins for the king and immediately she finds favor with him and we said it before she she says you know what give her seven servants seven Church age Messengers and and and and let them Let The Messengers dress her let them be the ones who get her prepared for the king and she's just she's catching everyone's attention and then she goes before the king and she's she's the fairest she's the chosen just he's just so caught by her beauty but it says when all of these other women they're they're picking what they want to take in before the king and you know I told you they're probably you know dressing down instead of dressing up but you know give me all the gold because if I can keep it when I'm done we're loaded for bear just in case I don't get chosen but but you know she's she's she expresses to to who I I'm calling the prophet in the story hagiai the one who's dressing her the one who knows the king and she says no you pick what I wear you pick what I take with me you know him more than I do you tell me what should I take before the king and she relies on his word and she does it and it catches the king's attention and this is in the midst of this Persian Empire this is in the midst of this this this Prince of Persia of these Kings of Persia of this this Spirit on this nation of Persia but I just I didn't want to leave you with that and and end right there I I was I was searching a message and you know trying to find where brother Branham talked about the the spirit of America the spirit on a nation and I found something and it was I only got through one message and not even the whole thing it was just you know sometimes in in study that you know the Lord will just start firing things and so we have the spirit of Persia we have the spirit of America and how they link so closely together but then there's this Spirit from above in the midst of this there's a spirit from above it's a spirit of of of judgment and warning and the scripture says judgment begins at the house of God it's a spirit of righteousness Spirit of above it's of righteousness not of our own but of his it's a spirit of of the power of the Holy Ghost and Resurrection that you have access to a spirit from above it's a spirit where comes into you and you're born from above this world is not our home we're just passing through we're pilgrims and strangers in this land just like Esther was a pilgrim and Stranger in Persia uh we're seeking a land to come not seeking worldly pleasures the spirit from above is a new creature in Christ it's a changed nature it's so that you don't have to be bound by the nature of America you can be bound by the spirit of above you could be become a love slave from above it's a spirit of morality and modesty it's a spirit that cannot fail though you may fail from time to time this Spirit can never fail and if the spirit can never fail and the spirit is in you you cannot fail it's a spirit of of not fear but it's a spirit of power and of love and of a sound mind in a nation that's going and saying that's gone it's gone it's insane in the nation that's full of anxiety and things that feed anxiety in a nation that that you know it's just it's become coveted to me was such a turning point for everything supply chain uh people's attitudes patience a a temper and yet in the midst of all that you can have a spirit above that says peace I give unto you not as the world give us gives peace but peace I give unto you that passes all understanding power Love A sound mind peace and a calm in the midst of the storm a calm in the midst of the spirit of America that's what you have access to tonight you have absolute access to it can you put up my uh my first slide Brother Kyle said this when he mentioned that the the size of this was just a little bit smaller than than the United States you remember he said this a given credit I guess you remember the king says Esther what do you want I'll give you up to half of my kingdom so take the United States split it in half take the kingdom of God that has no boundaries there are no borders to the kingdom of God and and Esther is not put in the Bible just as as some story a fairy tale to make you give you reading pleasure at night to help you fall asleep if this if this was a natural King offering Esther half of his kingdom then we're given we're we're offered half of the kingdom of Jesus Christ that doesn't have any borders can you imagine if you're offered now that doesn't even make good math you're offered a kingdom that doesn't have borders and boundaries and you're offered half of it you know what you get eternity you get eternity if there is no beginning and end of this Kingdom and you're offered half of it then you get eternity you have full access to everything from above you have full access in a in a I want to drive it home if you have access in a nation and in a spirit that that's warring against your your flesh is constantly before you you flesh your spirit is constantly oppressing you because Satan has access to that but yet in your soul you have the spirit of God you have full access to Everything Jesus Christ died for you have full Redemptive rights that have been given to you take up to half of the Kingdom if you want it go to Daniel 7 with me Daniel 7 and verse 13. I'm going to read you a couple more scriptures that we're closing on this Daniel 7 13.
