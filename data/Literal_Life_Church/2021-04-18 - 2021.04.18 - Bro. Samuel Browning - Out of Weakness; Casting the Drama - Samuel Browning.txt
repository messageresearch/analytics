========================================

if we could say i just i see different brothers and different ministers i start calling names i'll probably miss somebody and i don't want to do that but i i just so i want to tell you i i love each and every one of you amen i just think it's just an honor to be able to stand and serve in the same army of the living god and may god bless you god bless the wives and everything god bless you hebrews 11 verse 32 and what shall i say more for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and of barack and of samson and jephthah of david also and samuel and of the prophets who through faith that's very important who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection what we just read was just as glorious as kingdoms being subdued god's got to have vessels that stand no matter what's taking place they're standing for the lord jesus others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sold as under were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins being destitute afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and all these and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated paul is is writing here and letting the generation be known of those that have come before all through the old testament that this these great mighty acts that were were done that it was through faith it was through faith in a living god but it was not just the faith of those people but it was god's faith that was released to them that would that so superseded their own faith and it was god working through their lives to achieve and by yielding to that they obtained a good report paul speaking of the anticipation that those who were they were looking for a coming event of the messiah and the outpouring of the holy spirit they they they stayed they stayed steadfast and they looked for the promise in their in their time they were steadfast with that but in that in that time we realized that many of them has as they had went on by way of the grave but yet god as he came within that set time to raise up and make that promise now of the outpouring of the holy spirit after the lamb had been offered up and crucified buried resurrected ascended on high and i want to just say in in this manner all of this that we've read about here it was a drama the whole the whole bible is a drama it is as brother branham would allude to it many times it is a it's a drama that has been laid out and many times you'll find in the lives of of some of the people that we refer to and even haven't referred to here in this scripture they didn't altogether speak things of prophecy but sometimes it was simply their life as it was yielded to god would speak out in prophecy that there were going to be others that would come that would actually be the fulfillment of the types and different things that lay within their life now you know a drama when we begin to look at a drama there has to be a casting of that drama and to think of how that what was what what how paul would write this he would speak of different ones that already served their part in the drama in the shadows and types and and they fulfilled their part within that drama now i want you to remember one thing as we think about this god doesn't hold tryouts this drama god is not saying well i'll just see who's gonna we'll see if this one will do it no god already has his cast chosen they're not a cast that maybe somebody else would pick or say i think this one will make a good fit god's not considered anybody else's opinion god already has his cast and his cast is his children those genes those seed of his own choosing of his own substance of his own loins it's all laid out in a bed of time just like in that of that play and that drama paul would write it like this and say in first corinthians you see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to not things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence but of him are you in christ jesus who of god has made unto us wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption that according as it's written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord now i want to speak here just just a few moments on on a thought out of weakness but i want to look at it of out out of weakness but with the thought of casting the drama and when we we think of this you know perhaps maybe in school and you know in school or other things you know that you've had to do maybe in a in a bible play or whatever there's been parts that's been rolled out and somebody tries to look and say who can we get that would fit this part sometimes they can look for maybe somebody let's say somebody they want to play mary and they could say maybe not that little girl she's kind of she's a little rough she went i don't think you want her playing mary i don't know if she'd be able to handle it real good nothing wrong with the little girl she might fit better in another role but you see god specializes in looking deeper than what you can even see about yourself you see our understanding of our self is limited but god can see to the depth of that which is already sown within our life that maybe hasn't come to an expression but god knows what's there and it takes somebody to take an interest in you that knows about you to tell you really who you are to let you know the potentials that lay within you and so when we think of this of weakness i know that's not a term especially that likes to be used even when we think about it in the world it's not even a term that if you are going to choose people it's not a term that you would think about you would not choose about the choosing people who are weak whether it's emotionally physically or whatever you'd say i don't want nobody's weak but god chooses and desires weakness but it's not weakness like you and i think of it god when god is speaking of weakness as the scripture says out of weakness we're made strong god is speaking of a complete surrender you see it when we look at the word surrender it's there's a word that very similar with it is yielding you see god when he's cast this drama god is not interested in somebody trying out for the part and telling him i think it would be better if i did it this way or if i stood over here but god god doesn't need nobody to tell him how to run his business as a matter of fact god doesn't even need you to tell him how to meet your needs he already knew your needs he knew what your need would be right here tonight god already had it in mind it's already in the script god has the drama everything is set sometimes you might be waiting and you're looking and saying well where is these pieces coming together but remember as god taught us through the prophet's ministry be patient you wait on god whoever has to sit in that chair the handkerchief has to be here glasses here this person's in the room just be patient because if you're looking to god you cannot miss what god has for you the bible says in psalms 1 19 you can do no iniquity when you're seeking after god when you're when your heart is set on god everything that god has for you he will make sure you don't miss it he'll make sure that you catch each part of the junction and what it is that you have need of what we read about was god's heroes these are heroes and i want to say it like this i believe right now as i can look around this room even of of of i think the different brothers you know brother paul brother ron different ones that's around some of some of the veterans around in here and and others oh god doesn't just have heroes back here on the pages there's heroes that's standing in this hour in the face of satan's eden let me just say it to you like this for you as a young person to stand in the midst of satan's eating this is the most deceptive age that's ever been upon this earth and for you to make a declaration that i'm going to serve god you might say i'm not where i need to be but there's a pulsation in your heart that says i want to serve god i'm telling you right there that's something god can work with god put that inside of you it's god drawing that out of you it's god who's already casted the drama now he's just assembling his subjects he's assembling those that are in need for the part to be acted out through before these as we look before they ever could ever be strong they had to first get weak they had to first get weak you see brother brown would tell us like this he says out of weakness and humility you know humility ain't you or me walking around with somebody can walk around like this and inside there like this then humility is not the position of the body humility is the condition of the heart it's not thinking it's not thinking it's not thinking less of yourself looking down on yourself it's just you're not putting yourself up there you put yourself under the word it's not belittling yourself out of weakness and humility god chose to build his kingdom out of isn't it a coincidence god will choose he will choose those to bring forth promises that you and i could look at and say god to bring forth a promised son and you choose a man by the name of abraham and his wife is barren oh there's been some mix-up in the cast here something's not right but you see god doesn't choose us based on our strengths he knows your abilities because he put them in you he knows your talents don't despise your talents but don't ever try to take your talents and serve god without having them surrendering and let god use them god knows what they are because he put them in you college didn't put them in you teachers didn't put them in you all they did is tap into a channel and there's an interest that was already sown in there it's just like when somebody goes to be an engineer hey there was already traits and things that even when they were a baby and other things start coming out later on they love math that's why i'm not an engineer i don't like math i mean i like math when it comes to one one one boneless chicken breast another boneless chicken breast i'm that kind of math but but the other kind of math i'm not an engineer that way but god knows these things as they lay within our life and to think brother brown would say like this he said if we ever make it to heaven we'll stand in a with a bunch of people that's been weak and rejected and cast out by the world and knowing nothings [Applause] there's something within us we like to be accepted that's not an ungodly thing it's just having that channeled in the right way if you have to be accepted and you compromise in order to be accepted you're really not being accepted are you hearing me but you see it's within you to desire to be accepted so how then what is the right acceptance is to be really who you are and say god if you find yourself saying you know i need some real i need some real good people in my life i need some real christian people in my life then you look to god and say god i want to meet some individuals lord that really i can be myself brother samuel that seems awful simple god cares about you he cares about these little things sometimes we're putting things so far way out there that we forget to ask him because he's mindful of every decision and every part of our life god cares think about it god you know when you look at all the rest of the other animals you know like brother graham says a horse can run a lion can bite you and you know and a bear and things like that squirrel can go up a tree he said but a sheep stands helpless and that's the way god wants us is to realize that we're totally insufficient then god takes that person and begins to mold himself into that person now let me just qualify this not that i need to but this is not where you look at it and say oh i've tried to serve god i just can't do it that's not what he's saying he's saying that when you would come to a place to recognize lord i can't do it on my own you put this desire in me it's you that put it in me it's magnetized to you lord i'm trusting in you to give me the strength in my life what's needed lord god that my life might be filled and satisfied that's when you see yourself insufficient and you realize yourself as a sheep what does a sheep do a sheep know my voice a sheep that can be led is that right think of it then god when he comes into your life remember when god comes in he comes into the very depth of your life god deals with that soul that first nature god wants that first nature to agree with him when it finally starts to agree with him and it comes in agreeance god kills it right there and god raises up that seed on the inside by the quickening power that's the temple not made with hands this body and this human spirit then becomes the visible like this is right here it becomes the visible display of what is on the inside that's why paul said no you're not your body is a temple of the holy ghost see god dwelling within your life so it's not you or me trying to act out the word it's not that at all it's not us looking at the word i mean you know they talk about when people take apart i i don't know i'm not an actor but what i've understood is that some when they try to get somebody they have to take a part in the script and somehow they have to so immerse themselves into a place to where they actually take on the identity of that character they have to take on the persona of it they have to take on how that person talks and you know how they act and they conduct and and the thought process they have to be willing if they are going to uh you know be in whatever that is that play they have to be willing to do that they can't bring just their own self and expect that part of the drama to be granted to them let me just tell you god he's not holding tryouts but god in himself he draws you and i to that place to where that we can actually surrender and say lord i don't know how to fulfill the part i don't know how to fulfill this i i don't know how to make this live god said it's getting right it's getting right it's about time for them to step on stage why because you're getting to a place of where you know you can't do it in yourself you're realizing that my knowledge of the message knowing the doctrines know and do this and do that you realize that ain't going to work i need something that's deeper than that i'm tired of acting the part i need god to come and act through my life hallelujah and that invites god's presence hallelujah let me just say it like this everyone down through there don't worry i ain't gonna be real long but just remember this the bible said with elijah men subject to like passion such as we are he had his ups and downs he had days that he felt like he was on the mountain he had other days he felt like he was underneath the the the water was flowing in the valley that's the outer part of an individual i'm speaking because i know that i know all the way through this congregation there's one different different places where you're at but i want you to understand that a man the way they were men subject to like passion such as we are when god when god is assembling his cast remember he's already chosen but god has to bring him to a place of weakness you take for example let's look at a few characters gideon god says gideon right here in this role this is what the role says you're a mighty man of valor get in sin must be another gideon around here somewhere because he sure ain't talking to me god wasn't talking to that outward man he wasn't talking to that first birth are you hearing me because that first birth it was a coward but god was looking deeper in gideon's life so what would gideon have to do eventually get in he has to settle down and this is where god works on his life to get him to look beyond his complexes my family is the least family and this he's what's he doing the word keeps coming and what's the word doing the word is actually unfolding the very position in the drama and that word as he's receiving it it's dismissing complexes where he's had fears and he's timid the word holds the power within it to bring him in position and dismantle every bit of doubt who does that god does it gideon never stepped up and said i can do this but god knew what lay within him he had to work with gideon a lot you see it ain't the same let me just sound like this it ain't always the same ways or maybe pattern or length or whatever it ain't always the same but god knows each and every one of us god even knows even the situations and things in your life let me tell you something you realize you can look in your life and say you don't know the times that i've tried to serve god and how many times i've failed you realize that god allows you to fail because the course you were on was one of your own strength god allowed moses to build himself up in understanding in wisdom he knew about the deliverer he he believed well i'm to be that one but he lacked what was necessary in order for that to be fulfilled god was not asking moses to fulfill it it finally came to a place when god got moses in a place where moses looked at the roll and moses said i can't do that god said that's where i want you now it's ready for you you're getting ready now to step on the stage you see god is the one who brings you and i to a surrender it's not you that does it it's god working on your life it's god that deals with your life that brings you to that place god don't force nobody on stage sometimes you ever seen little kids i i don't think none of y'all look okay i think everybody's big but you're seeing a little kid they got a part sometimes they have an apartment they don't really want that part and they've got that part they're not they're not real too happy about that part that they've got but they'll go ahead and do it let me just say this when god brings us to that place and through that surrender we're happy with that part if it's no more than just to say amen whatever the party is we're so delighted that god has so dealt in our life to bring us to the place a position that he might perform his word through our life god allowed moses to fail god allows god allows those things you you see you can look and say well i've been raised around the message i i've listened i've listened to tapes all my life i told you the other night i could finish quotes i could finish quotes that when you know when when i really wasn't in in good good positions of mind from hearing them played in the car playing in the home but just hearing it didn't do it did i believe brother rahm was a prophet i did believe he was a prophet but that didn't do it what had to happen there had to be a meeting with god i didn't force that meeting with god i'm going to tell you that meeting right there god arranged that meeting [Music] [Applause] i didn't know what was going on i didn't know why my desires were being turned i didn't know why i started to look at things differently why i started to notice things in the world and say i can't trust this i can't trust that i didn't know that but it was god that was dealing with my heart what was god doing he was drawing me to a place of surrender like what he had to do for moses he let moses know i don't need your intellect i don't need your strength i just need to borrow your body i already put you in the drama you're already cast in the drama all i need is you for you to let me bring you into position what do i have to do just surrender i'll do it jephthah a lot of these a lot of these there in the scripture jeff doing different ones jephthah you look at his background he was a son of a harlot he didn't have a great pedigree oh he you know he couldn't look back and say boy i'll tell you all the way through everything just it lined right up man with the law everything know as a matter of fact there were things in the law that was stacked against him but god was for him you say why would god include that for you and me to let you and i see that god's grace is so rich it's unsearchable that when you think you've gone too far god says my grace goes further yet [Applause] [Music] when you would have wrote yourself out of the script but god knows it's not your nature it's not that real you on the inside are you hearing me you would have wrote yourself out of the script i would have wrote myself out of the script i'm not worthy i'm not worthy to be called your son i'm not worthy to be in this drama but god as though he don't even hear that he keeps dealing with our life he keeps sending word after word and ministering to us why he's got confidence that seed on the inside will respond to that voice what i have to do like mary be it unto me according to the script samson the first gold gym picture boy you know better if it would have been samson's physique they would have for gold's gym nobody would go there to pump iron brother brown called him a curly headed little shrimp scrawny this will help some of you boys out mama's boy hey that ain't number one ain't nothing wrong being a mama's boy you look at mama mama will help you decide and know what wife you should choose later in life are you with me but think of it god chose him to go and fight the philistines like he chose gideon he chose a guy who's a coward god's looking deeper what is wrote there in the script god's the one who brings forth the character that is wrote within that word god brings forth that character by the character of his own life david we looked at him on friday night he was a youth aren't you glad that god had some young people included in there if you really studied in the scriptures there you find that there's a lot of young people that's that's men that's actually mentioned in the in the in the field of boaz young men joshua had young men is that right there were young people that were included within that and david is known as looked upon here he is a youth he's ruddy i mean he david wasn't even the pick of the prophet come on now showing let me tell you what that means to me it shows that the natural eyes of man is not what chose you and i gloria because there could have been a lot of individuals that could have looked to you and i and said i don't know how i don't know if there's anything there but god said yes sir there's something there inside of their life all it takes is for me to get in contact with them and something starts to move and things start changing the lord jesus well there was no weakness in him but how brother branham describes it he was a spindly fella so if you're a real skinny guy he was a spindly fella but you can't put me out for being a chunky one spindly fellow he didn't look like a king sometimes you know we have images of how people ought to look paul wrote letters and when paul came among them they said this can't be the guy because the letters we wrote mighty men of god a man seven feet tall it wasn't the mightiness of paul it was the mighty god oh my great big things come in small packages [Applause] look at peter in them they never get invited to a spelling bee i don't mind you laughing because but it ain't trying i'm not trying to be funny i'm just trying to point out to you if you're looking at things that could be picked out brother brown tells us they couldn't even read their name if it was wrote out on a boxcar i've seen people who who've never been able to read and you write their name in from they don't know what it is then when you go to tell them this is your name right here wow this is what it looks like god chose men like that he didn't choose them because they were illiterate but god was showing that his choosing and the acting out of his drama he doesn't need somebody that can read the script and try to come into imaginary way god doesn't need that he doesn't even need our efforts he only needs our yielding and remember he said you've not chosen me but i've chosen you i'm glad about that because how many times we try to get out of the parts that god wants us god said this is what i have for you lord how can this be how can i do this how can i god that's where that's a place he wants us but it's to say lord i can't do this on my own i need you i'm not only talking about before you get the holy ghost i'm talking about after you get the holy ghost because the holy ghost isn't something that you put in your hand in control he comes and controls you it's him that we're surrendering to he directs our life he's the one that changes maybe ambitions and objectives and a lot of things that we have and when he comes into our life the desire that we have is to please him in such a way that when he begins to deal with our life sure there might be things that are disappointing to us things pathways that we wanted to go maybe career paths or other things like that but when he begins to deal with our heart and our heart has been changed brother there's a desire that means more to us than anything and that's what is my father's will we may have to die and we do have to die paul said i have to die daily let me just tell you something god when you're part god don't accept no god don't take his drama and say let's see now i've got to find who am i going to get to fill that part good job god don't accept no he might have to work with us a little bit like you seen gideon and the rest of them he came to our prophet he told him you're going to be praying for kings and monarchs you're going to take a message that's going to going to announce and forerun the second coming of the lord what did what did brother graham say i told him i would not be able to do it then he told me brother braham goes on to it he began to tell me of the signs that would be given to me he began to unfold what did brother brahm say he begins to unfold the places in the word questions that brother brahm had god don't mind questions with the right motive god don't mind questions god god will take those questions that you've got on your heart and god will answer them those questions that arise in your heart is an opportunity for god to unfold himself to you and god began to unfold the word to brother branham this is this place in the scripture this is where this is being fulfilled this is where this has taken place god has so placed it house as he would say in his word we have this treasure in earthen vessels i know now they've got a lot of different flower pots but do any remember them clay flower pots that they would have i mean they look uh well they look a clay color like a reddish color you know man i remember my mom used to have those things you didn't knock them over you knocked them over they broke they are fragile that's how our lives are like earth and vessel it's very fragile but we have this treasure in earth and vessels it's not the earth and vessel that's the treasure it's what it is housing on the inside that the not the excellency of the power of god it might be of god and not of us so they became empty vessels by yielding to the lord how many know that that where the where the scripture said not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord how that he would reveal himself in the book of revelations walking in the midst of the church he would reveal himself as the one who is declaring the victory in the midst of his brother you see what this is saying god's not interested in just being somebody who's close by he wants to be in the midst of your life he wants to be the strength of your life he wants to be the one who is living and acting his word right through your life this is why after all was said and done and after the resurrection of the lord jesus that word began to gather the disciples with a purpose to let them know that because what they had been doing they were looking at the lord jesus they were walking with them it was necessary they observed that ministry it was necessary that they would catch many of the things that were happening but there were some things they didn't catch because it wasn't time yet but when he got up on that easter morning he never forgot about the cast that was part of that drama there were already witnesses that were chosen that he would reveal himself to and you know what that word coming on display did it made an announcement there that your time is now on it's time for you to step on the stage and that's what the holy spirit what he not only did through the ministry of the prophet in this hour but that same living god as he comes right down into your life he's assembling the cast members that was in his mind before the foundation of the world what's he assembling us to he's assembling us to the promise that he would pour out himself he would pour out the holy ghost which is the strength of our lives now the scripture says it like this can i have just a few more moments you i know you're probably familiar with this remember now the creator in the days of thy youth lest the evil days come not you know what evil days are let me see here anybody how can i cover myself anybody 45 years and over just cover your ears it's when you get older the evil days when you you've been doing a little bit of working oh man oh i feel that but i got to get some ointment on where's the advil those are evil days you start feeling the effects of those things but notice what it says remember thy creator in the days of thy youth in lamentations 3 7 it's good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth you know in your youth you've got a lot of strength and stamina you do you've got a lot of strength god wants to use your strength there's a lot of things to be done in this final stretch of the race god wants to use your strength your vigor where some of us that are older we get a little tired after a little bit and our words get crossed up but god looks in and says here i need your strength i want that youthfulness i want that energy but god doesn't want us taking our energy and trying to do it he wants it yielded he won't take nothing from you he won't demand it he wants you to surrender it the bible says in isaiah 40. let me refer to this isaiah 40 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall isaiah by the spirit of god is pointing it out that just mere strength alone in youthfulness is not going to be able to get the job done you'll grow theory and you grow faint and weary why because you're not fighting against flesh and blood you can't overcome these devils with knowledge you've got to have a great big god on the inside you've got to have a strength and brother what is that strength where the inside desire has been changed and the devil can do whatever he wants to do but your appetites have been changed your desires are different that's the work of almighty god that's when like the song brother paul wrote there when it drops from the head down to the heart it's no longer you acting it out but once it gets down here it's where god has put on the vesture and it's god acting out his word through your life even your peculiarities god has made you that way so even the youth so strength alone won't do it they'll utterly fail but they that have wait on the lord shall renew their strength and they shall mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint to wait is to be yielded to god god asked you and i to separate ourselves from the world god don't come down and do that for us he asks you and i to do that how do we separate ourselves paul said purge ourselves from other vessels in the house how do we do that by his word if god had not given a word in this hour we would be just like the rest mixing in with everything else but in that word it holds a call it holds a mystery it holds the unfolding of who you are it's calling you in position and god don't ask you to figure it out god don't ask you to say i want you to study this script over and i want you to memorize the lines i want you to have this gods and god god doesn't have sunday school charts with golden stickers on it god's not asking that you and i memorize it all god wants us to do is yield ourself to him invite him in that he can come and perform his word we looked at that even with moses and seeing that with how god allowed moses to get to that place the bible would write to the right right in the book of john i think brother ron read this scripture i don't know if it's morning or last night but he wrote how remember how john wrote to the young men it was young people in general he would say you've overcome the wicked one i write to your little children because you've known the father i've written unto your fathers because you've known him that is from the beginning i've written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of god abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one what's he dealing with he's talking about not their earthly or their physical strength their strength is the word of god abiding in them that's their strength to where it's not it's not a letter it's not what i know but it's the reality of that word of the person of jesus christ himself where in your life you know there's been a passing from death unto life you say how do how do i know that look at what your life produces what is the very desires of your life remember what brother brown tells us in desperation he said people say i've seen a lie i've seen this i've seen that he said that's all fine and good but what is your life after all of that is that right he said god comes down in other places and he says god will come down and he whispers in your heart it's finished and when god whispers that in your heart it's finished it's done it's over brother there's been a transformation that takes place in the depths of your life the desire of sin has ceased sure you can be tempted but there's a resistance on the inside you've got a strength there's already been an overcomer on the inside that's moved in there might be snags and traps along the way but you're not a piece of driftwood floating down the stream you've been brought into the ark of the lord you've got a power behind you that when things would come about when discouragement comes your way you've got a strength that's behind you what is that that ain't human power that's the power of the holy ghost hallelujah god will have to allow jacob to get to that place jacob had met god but jacob didn't he he wasn't changed at that first time in bethel but he did he he told god when i returned he got to that place at night what he'd been running from and that night he was left alone and there god came and he wrestled with god jacob had a lot of strength now let me just say this jacob had grown tired of being jacob he got to a spot he said i'm tired of being jacob i'm tired of this and god's saying yes yes he's realizing he's tired of being jacob so at that time god shows up like you heard the lord speaking through brother ron it was an arranged moment that night and in that moment of wrestling when finally jacob himself he had no more strength it was in that time he was asking for what is your name that when god asked him what's your name are you hearing me god asked him what's your name he identifies i'm jacob he wasn't trying to make excuses for it i'm the deceiver i'm a supplanter and i'm sick of it and god said now's the time that i can step on the scene i've got a part in this cast that's got to be fulfilled and god said you're right in the right place that's repentance recognizing that i'm jacob and god said you shall no longer be called jacob but now thou shalt be called israel for as a prince you've got power with god a moment of weakness he wasn't standing on excuses lord i've tried i've tried lord i just can't do it i don't have the stamina he's still not ready but when he finally came to a time i'm jacob god said that's the time this is what i've been waiting on and it wasn't like god was just waiting around like well i wish you'd hurry up everything was in his time god brings his children to a place to where they recognize the only place they can stand is on the word of god that's where faith comes in through faith they subdued kingdoms through faith righteousness through faith it was not because they were some great people within themselves no it was because they came to a place of yielding to god that god could step inside of them and you know that's that's what god's desire is that that's what the new birth is it's you coming to a place to say i'm jacob i'm jacob lord i need delivered lord i need set free maybe you've already come to that place but in your life right now maybe there's things that making some choices on your own and you're just kind of looking at things and saying well you know i think i can do this or i think i'm going to do that i'm not talking about sin i'm not i'm speaking about now or you start realizing and you start looking at it and say wait a minute here there was a surrender in my life and god took control of my life that don't stop the surrender when the lamb of god was sought out by the spirit of god and he was brought to the river jordan in perfect obedience right at the right time he was baptized by the prophet john not because he was a sinner he had to be washed as the sacrifice as even as that of the priest is that right and here he comes into that place and john says oh no no no no no far be it no no i need to be baptized to you but jesus standing on the word said it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness and following in obedience to the word oh my brother and sister this is one thing young people you could never get around obedience to the word the holy ghost does not come upon disobedience he giveth the holy ghost to them that obey him you might even have things on your phones right now you might have things in your bedroom that you say i wouldn't want nobody to know about but god's talking about an obedience down here when he gets that lined up your phone will change your bedroom will change those things will take care of itself why because there's a new man on the inside and that man that's in there says i don't like those things we don't do those things why you've got a new man inside this temple let's stand [Applause] god's cast that he's drawn to himself god's assembled you in this hour we're not here by chance we're not here by chance in this moment and in this time we're not here by chance in this service tonight we've heard that here this weekend and you we have heard that throughout we've we've heard that we believe that but this is a reality this is a moment right now remember god is god does not take no for an answer you belong within that caste ordained to be in that position god deals and he works on your heart he might have to work on your heart like he did gideon where he dealt with getting with the sacrifice in the rock then and then it was right after that tearing down the altar then it was you know the the the piece of sheepskin do on it the next night do all around and knit dry but you know what god is going to prove himself and his desire is is to get you to believe him if you can believe what he saith unto thee that's all god wants you go to believe in that and you start saying yes lord yes lord a pulsation starts yes lord yes lord beyond your thoughts remember how the holy spirit spoke here this morning think beyond your thoughts look beyond what you see i'm telling you to see yourself don't look at yourself as a devil can point you put you down like oh you're nothing you know you're too young or you're just trotted out you've made too many mistakes in your past i want you to look there through that blood and see a real son and daughter of god and know that that's where you're standing and know that god's desire is for you to be placed right there god didn't choose you because you'd be mistake free and you'd come in this way he know what that seed laying on the inside and all it takes is in his presence where our life says yes lord be it unto me and god steps down and here we are brother paul can you come help me for a moment i would have brother boaz but here i am i say lord i want you to i want you to help me lord i want you to help me lord help me lord jesus help me lord help me lord i i really want to overcome this lord help me what's wrong here i'm not standing still i've got one arm in it feels pretty good kind of straddling the fence i'm kind of it feels pretty good but i need help getting my arm in this other one stand still see how he took my hand there that feels so much better that's what god does with a complete surrender i mean you're willing to just you're willing to die out to yourself say i had enough and even if you you've come to that place you don't stop dying there's something within you that desires more of god lord let me die more to my will let me be led lord let me be so yielded to you experience i wonder how many hearts in sincerity to the lord you realize brother samuel i believe i'm part of that cast god's dealing with my heart god bless you it's him it's not a man it's him i'm part of that cast now your hands up to the lord you say lord put me there lord take me there i i've got my hand lord to put it in your hand take me there lord jesus i can't do this on my own strength i've tried but lord in humility and weakness i'm just going to stand on your word just to believe you lord surrender myself if there's something to lay down just dial to it right now make it make it right before god let it be cleaned out right now just just lay everything down on the line god will come right there to that place he'll come right there heavenly father lord you see father the hearts of your children there's lives lord god of precious young people lord the lord jesus that satan he'd love to have but we want to announce to satan you can't have them lord jesus they believe lord god they feel that pulsation it ain't about what they can explain but they sense that pulsation of the quickening power of god they sense that dealing with their life and they lord it something that's moving them beyond doubt beyond worry be on fear lord god there's a yes on the inside there's a believing on the inside there's a part lord moving on the inside the lord when you spoken lord and they lord god can say i'm jacob and your voice responds back thou shalt no more be called jacob thou shalt be called israel granite lord in the name of the lord jesus christ satan we rebuke you you're a liar you come with fear you come with condemnation you come with all these traps there in sin but in the name of the lord jesus christ under the authority of the atonement and the holy spirit we assure you according to these hearts that are made a stand on the word of god take your hands off in the name of jesus christ for the glory of almighty god hallelujah oh let's just worship him you just enter in personally right there with him just enter in personally with him right there just to let

turning your heart he's been changing even your outlook you maybe wouldn't even be here tonight but he's already been dealing with your life over a course of days and weeks maybe months it's god himself that's been working and turning your heart you can look and say brother samuel my heart was so hard a month ago but look where it's at tonight who did that one who loves you the lord jesus to
