[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine
[0:02] and Literal Life Church in Petersburg,
[0:04] Michigan would like to invite you to
[0:06] take the next half hour and enjoy some
[0:08] time in the word of God. If you're
[0:11] hungry for more God, we believe you can
[0:13] be fed. And we pray that you'll be
[0:16] blessed. Visit our website for more
[0:18] information at literalife.urch.
[0:21] May God bless you, my friend. May the
[0:23] music and message encourage you today.
[0:27] When we come together with our licks of
[0:31] fire,
[0:33] two or three gathered or more
[0:38] all in your name in one accord, you're
[0:43] gracious to meet us here, Lord.
[0:47] And then as I leave, I take you with me.
[0:52] I know what awaits past those doors
[0:57] and I'll not take your presence for
[1:00] granted
[1:02] anymore.
[1:07] It's not just about the feeling,
[1:12] but I love to feel you.
[1:17] So many souls are seeking.
[1:22] They land what matters most.
[1:26] Your mercy and grace has followed my
[1:30] days. I'm blessed just to be near you,
[1:34] Lord.
[1:36] And I'll not take your presence for
[1:39] granted
[1:41] anymore.
[1:42] [Music]
[1:46] Without a strong power to run to, to
[1:49] hide. In my own strength, I'd fall prey.
[1:55] To darkness and harm, fear over faith.
[2:00] But in you, I know I am safe.
[2:05] I can imagine. I don't want to know what
[2:10] a life without you would afford.
[2:14] And I'll not take your presence for
[2:17] granted
[2:19] anymore.
[2:24] It's not just about a feeling,
[2:29] but I love to feel you close.
[2:34] So many souls are seeking.
[2:38] They lack what matters most.
[2:43] Your mercy and grace has followed my
[2:47] days. I'm blessed just to be near you,
[2:51] Lord.
[2:53] And I'll not take your presence for
[2:56] granted
[2:58] anymore.
[3:01] [Music]
[3:02] On the wings of the morning, to the
[3:05] depths of the sea,
[3:08] wherever I go, you are with me. My rise
[3:13] to the heavens. Make my bed down in
[3:16] hell. Still you are there.
[3:20] Still with me. You dwell.
[3:27] It's not just about a feeling.
[3:31] Lord, I love to feel you close.
[3:37] So many souls are seeking.
[3:41] They l what matters most.
[3:46] Your mercy and grace has followed my
[3:50] days. I'm blessed just to be near you,
[3:54] Lord.
[3:55] And I'll not take your presence for
[3:58] granted.
[4:00] No, I'll not take your presence
[4:03] for granted. No, I'll not take your
[4:07] presence for granted.
[4:10] [Music]
[4:12] anymore.
[4:15] [Music]
[4:19] In thee, oh Lord, do I put my trust. Let
[4:22] me never be put to confusion. You know,
[4:26] when we're trusting the Lord completely,
[4:28] then we won't live in confusion. How
[4:30] many know the Bible says God is not the
[4:33] author of confusion? If you're confused,
[4:36] it comes from the enemy's side. It comes
[4:39] from the devil. God's not the author of
[4:41] confusion. And so when we put our trust
[4:43] in him, he said, "Let me never be put to
[4:46] confusion. Deliver me in thy
[4:49] righteousness, and cause me to escape.
[4:53] Incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
[4:56] Be thou my strong habitation where to I
[5:00] may continually," Everybody say
[5:03] continually.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Continually resort. We'll talk about
[5:07] that in a minute. But David said,
[5:09] "You're my habitation. You're that place
[5:11] that I want to go to. You're the place I
[5:13] want to default to. And I don't want to
[5:15] just go there every uh few months when I
[5:18] need it. I want to continually resort to
[5:21] this habitation. I want to continually
[5:24] to default into this secret place."
[5:26] That's the way we want to live.
[5:28] Continually, may I continually resort.
[5:31] Thou hast given commandment to save me,
[5:34] for thou art my rock and my fortress.
[5:39] Can you imagine? God has given a
[5:42] commandment to save you from whatever
[5:44] you need to be saved from. It's not you
[5:46] going saving yourself. It's not you
[5:48] running to something you don't get no
[5:49] help. He's already got a commandment.
[5:51] He's got a word over your life. He's got
[5:53] a covenant over your life. And God's
[5:56] covenants cannot be broken that he makes
[5:58] himself. You remember the covenant he
[6:00] made with Abraham? He says, "I will do
[6:01] this. I will do this. I will do this."
[6:03] First one he made with man. It was like
[6:05] a deal. If I do this, will you do this,
[6:07] Adam? If I do this, and man always
[6:09] fails. When he come to Abraham and says,
[6:11] "I'm going to bless you. I'm going to
[6:13] give you a land. I'm going to do this."
[6:15] And that's the covenant. It's not it's
[6:17] not contingent upon your mistakes. God
[6:21] will hold his covenant over you your
[6:23] whole life. And God will fulfill his
[6:26] covenant. God has a commandment over
[6:28] your life to save you.
[6:31] &gt;&gt; And if we have that assurance, then we
[6:33] ought to just rest in that rock and that
[6:35] fortress that he has given us. Can you
[6:37] say amen? We're going to pick up where
[6:39] we left off in talking a little bit
[6:41] about he shall hide me. He shall hide
[6:44] me. And this will be part three. And we
[6:46] want to talk a little bit about these
[6:48] different scriptures. And we David is
[6:50] the one in the Bible we said that wrote
[6:52] so much about this mystery of a hiding
[6:55] place in Christ. Even though he didn't
[6:58] fully have access to it in mystery, he
[7:00] began to write about it. He began to
[7:02] know about it. And and uh the reason
[7:04] that he wrote about it is some of the
[7:06] reason he wrote about it is God allowed
[7:08] experiences
[7:09] in David's life to teach him that there
[7:12] is really at the end of the day there's
[7:14] really only one place to run into where
[7:17] we are safe. And David was allowed to go
[7:21] through many experiences in his story
[7:24] that taught them. He he learned a lot,
[7:26] but he really learned and that's why
[7:28] David kept referring to a rock, a
[7:31] fortress, a hiding place, a secret
[7:34] place, a secret place of his tabernacle.
[7:37] That's just some of the terms he used.
[7:38] And he mentioned those terms more than
[7:40] anybody in the Bible because God allowed
[7:44] him to go through experiences that he
[7:46] learned. There is a place to go to.
[7:48] There is a place of safety. There is a
[7:51] place that is a default place that today
[7:54] especially friends we need to know that
[7:57] every time something comes up in life
[8:00] there's one place that we run to. It's
[8:02] not something of the world but we run it
[8:04] back into this place with Christ.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; And so but there was a lot of things
[8:10] that taught David that run to that
[8:12] place. But the fact is we learn too in
[8:14] our lives and we learn by seeing all the
[8:17] places that we run to. One of the things
[8:19] I'd like to us to learn and and to
[8:22] ponder in this is that we begin to see
[8:24] in our life especially as we go down the
[8:26] road the places that we develop that we
[8:28] run into uh that we escape into that we
[8:32] go into we run and we learn all those
[8:35] places fail us all those places are not
[8:38] assur asssuring all those places aren't
[8:41] the protection that God gives there's
[8:43] only one place that we can come and get
[8:45] true satisfaction
[8:47] &gt;&gt; and when we're running from something
[8:49] then we want to choose the place that
[8:51] that's really safe that's really
[8:53] protected there there are two things
[8:56] that I want to probe at this morning a
[8:57] little bit is that we all run from
[9:00] things we are all prone to run from
[9:02] things we all tend to in our human
[9:05] nature to run from stuff but then we all
[9:08] choose things to run to something that
[9:11] we run to so how many would all agree
[9:14] that's the way we are in our human
[9:15] nature when trouble come when People
[9:18] treat us wrong. We have a nature about
[9:21] us that we mostly will run. They have a
[9:23] thing called fight or flight. We either
[9:26] fight for ourselves or we'll run away. A
[9:28] lot of times we run away. We don't want
[9:30] the the the confrontation. We don't want
[9:32] to do that. But we run. We run in our
[9:35] nature and we all run to something that
[9:38] we think probably will be our escape.
[9:41] David says here in Psalm 71, "Lord, I
[9:44] want you to be my ultimate escape. I
[9:48] want you to become my escape. I want you
[9:50] to be the one that I run to." Is he the
[9:53] one you run to when you want to go hide?
[9:57] But we run from and we avoid a lot of
[9:59] things in life. And even Christians
[10:02] sometimes are running from something.
[10:04] They're avoiding talking about
[10:06] something. They're avoiding things. And
[10:07] they'll go for years running from
[10:09] something. him. And then we have to
[10:11] bring up the prophet Jonah. Here's
[10:13] Jonah. He was not a back he was not
[10:16] backslid as we would think he was, but
[10:18] he was running from the responsibility
[10:20] and the presence of the Lord. I want you
[10:22] to remember that he was running from the
[10:25] presence of the Lord. He received a
[10:27] commission, a calling. Go tell the
[10:29] Ninevites and get them to repent and
[10:31] preach the the message to them. But what
[10:33] was he running from? The presence of the
[10:35] Lord. When you run from the
[10:37] responsibility of what the word is being
[10:39] presented to you even today, then it's
[10:41] not you're running from Paul Fontaine.
[10:43] It's not that you're running from some
[10:45] religion, but you're running from the
[10:46] presence of the Lord because in the word
[10:49] is the presence of the Lord. And as Sher
[10:52] Song said, we never want to take it for
[10:54] granted. Can you say amen? We don't want
[10:56] to do that anymore because we could be a
[10:58] Jonah that's running from the presence
[11:00] of the Lord. In the presence of the Lord
[11:02] is where we need to be and where we need
[11:04] to live. And Jonah, you know, think
[11:07] about, you know, I try to be nice to
[11:08] him, but and I've said before that I
[11:10] need to apologize to him because some of
[11:12] the sermons I've been pretty critical.
[11:14] Jon Jonah only has four chapters on his
[11:17] life, but sure has provided a lot of
[11:20] sermons for me in that short four
[11:22] chapters. I'll tell you, there's a lot
[11:23] of sermons it's provided us. We are bent
[11:26] towards running from things. It's human
[11:29] nature. But then it it's it's you know
[11:32] if we're going to run sometimes it's
[11:35] it's what we run to that counts. It's
[11:37] what we run to. Sometimes we run into
[11:41] something else that's not Christ and
[11:43] then it turns out worse. How many has
[11:45] ever experienced that you run to
[11:47] something thinking that's the answer and
[11:49] you find out it everything turns out
[11:51] worse than what it was at the beginning
[11:53] because you ran to the wrong thing. Why
[11:55] does it turn out? We didn't run to
[11:57] Christ. But why did it turn out we ran
[12:00] to the wrong thing? We escape, but we
[12:02] escape into the wrong thing or things.
[12:05] If we run, we should run into something
[12:08] that God has provided. I trust you're
[12:11] listening to me this morning because we
[12:13] live in Leodysia. We live in the closing
[12:16] seconds of time. And I have never seen
[12:19] so many things offered to us, even
[12:22] believers, that are escapes, that are
[12:24] things to run into. There are things to
[12:26] relieve our nerves. There are things
[12:28] that we got because the trouble is too
[12:31] much. I know there's some out there
[12:32] they're turn they'll turn to drinking to
[12:34] relieve their nerves. They'll turn to
[12:36] smoking to relieve their nerves.
[12:38] Christians, they they don't want to do
[12:39] that. They want to put that aside. But
[12:42] even Christians that don't smoke or
[12:43] drink, you better be aware of all of
[12:46] Satan's devices that we're running to
[12:49] something where we should be running to
[12:51] that secret place. I could take another
[12:53] sermon on all the things that we run to.
[12:55] I can name them. All the things that we
[12:57] run to that are our satisfaction. And
[13:00] many times we run because we're having
[13:02] trouble. Someone doesn't like us.
[13:04] Something happened. Some people are
[13:05] still running from their past. They're
[13:07] still running from it. They're not
[13:08] facing it. They're not bring it to the
[13:10] Lord. They're not finding deliverance
[13:12] over it. They're still running from
[13:14] their past. We tend to run to the wrong
[13:17] thing. We escape, but we escape into the
[13:19] wrong thing or things. And if we run,
[13:22] then we should run into something God
[13:24] has provided a place of strength that
[13:28] the next time if we run into Christ's
[13:30] place of strength in that secret place
[13:33] that that habitation of a a rock in in a
[13:37] weary land, a place of strength that the
[13:40] next we should run into a place of
[13:42] strength from the Lord so that the next
[13:45] time we face things, we face it better.
[13:48] This is what David found. This is what
[13:51] he learned. People
[13:54] will treat you a certain way. You will
[13:56] have ups and downs in life. And when
[13:59] that happens, it creates
[14:02] emotional instability. You don't feel
[14:04] stable. You don't feel you feel the
[14:06] ground is shaking a little bit. You feel
[14:09] uh not not physically, but your emotions
[14:11] are are instable because we are
[14:15] emotional people. God knew that. God
[14:18] understood that we are an emotional
[14:20] people and so Satan abuses that to like
[14:24] life will happen. Satan will do things
[14:26] but even life itself and the way people
[14:29] treat you and the way things people say
[14:31] about you and the unrealistic
[14:34] expectations of people all can create
[14:37] emotional instability in our lives. And
[14:40] when we begin to run from that
[14:42] instability to something else instead of
[14:44] Christ, then we find we can find we we
[14:47] we can realize even more emotional
[14:50] instability and it doesn't get any
[14:52] better. But we should run into a quiet
[14:55] place with him because we know that that
[14:58] is going to bring stability emotionally.
[15:01] Couple years ago, I preached on where we
[15:04] find emotional stability. And I read the
[15:06] scriptures to show that there's a place.
[15:10] There's a place that I'm preaching that
[15:12] you can run to to stabilize things,
[15:16] &gt;&gt; to make things more consistent, to just
[15:18] to to to rest. The Christian life is
[15:22] based solidly upon rest.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; Rest in what God does. Rest in the word
[15:28] that he said from the beginning. He he
[15:30] said, brother uh Steven said it w uh
[15:33] Wednesday night is that even God rested
[15:35] from his own works. He spoke it once the
[15:37] word was spoken. He had such confidence
[15:39] in what was spoken. He rested the
[15:41] seventh day. All the works were finished
[15:43] before before the foundation of the
[15:44] world. But when he spoke it, it was
[15:46] really settled. He could rest completely
[15:48] in his own word. And now we can rest in
[15:52] God's word and find a place of rest when
[15:55] ships are tossed. When our life is
[15:57] tossed, when people have persecuted you
[16:01] and spoken wrong things against you,
[16:03] when you have done wrong things to other
[16:05] people, you can feel unsettled about it.
[16:07] But there's a place of repentance and
[16:09] there's a place of rest that brings
[16:11] emotional stability. Husbands can create
[16:14] stability in their family or they can
[16:16] create instability by their doubts, by
[16:19] their fears, by their inconsistency. You
[16:21] don't have the family in church once a
[16:23] month, whatever it is. And the whole
[16:25] family feels unstable because daddy is
[16:28] not creating stability. Our great daddy,
[16:30] our great Christ, our husband, when he
[16:32] went to Calvary, he created the greatest
[16:35] stability for the bride ever before.
[16:38] that we rest not in our own works, but
[16:41] we rest in a finished work of Calvary.
[16:44] He's already done it. It creates
[16:46] stability. Our groom, Jesus Christ,
[16:49] creates stability and peace,
[16:52] consistency.
[16:54] The Christian life is based upon rest in
[16:57] that secret place. The work's already
[16:59] done.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; And there isn't any turbulence
[17:04] in this life, no matter what happens.
[17:07] I've preached to people here for 36
[17:09] years and I'd never seen such things hit
[17:12] their life that you go oh no you one
[17:17] thing you say they don't they didn't
[17:19] deserve that it seemed like somebody
[17:20] else deserve that some rotten person you
[17:23] know that that's lived here's a faithful
[17:25] Christian to the Lord and something
[17:28] strikes their life or those that family
[17:31] those kids life they never expected
[17:34] we're living in that power
[17:36] &gt;&gt; and that's why I create keep preaching.
[17:40] Are you listening?
[17:41] &gt;&gt; There's a place that you can run to.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; I can't change situations.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; I can't change what's happened to you,
[17:50] but I can point you to a secret place.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; I can point you to a place that has
[17:54] rapturing faith. This was amazing. Smith
[17:57] Smith Wigglesworth, a great preacher. He
[17:59] said, "It is in the secret place." Smith
[18:03] Wigglesworth said, "It is in the secret
[18:06] place where God begins to unfold his
[18:09] mysteries to your spirit. It is in the
[18:13] secret place where you get to discover."
[18:17] These are wonderful words. It is in the
[18:19] secret place where you get to discover
[18:20] who you are in Christ. People will
[18:23] wonder where you get your boldness, your
[18:25] understanding, your peace of your heart.
[18:28] The secret place is the place where you
[18:30] get to study the word, meditate on the
[18:32] word, pray it through into your spirit
[18:34] man, man. It is a place of honor. It is
[18:37] a place of glory. A place where things
[18:40] are created. Can you say amen? What a
[18:42] place.
[18:44] A place where things are created and
[18:46] called forth. Many of us today have
[18:49] forsaken the secret place and are busy
[18:52] chasing after the shadow,
[18:55] leaving the real substance behind. We
[18:58] need to get back to the secret place and
[19:00] build ourselves in the most holy faith
[19:04] through the word and prayers.
[19:07] Let Smith Wigglesworth
[19:09] correct us and set us on the right
[19:11] course. We get so busy, we'll choose
[19:14] something shallow or choose a shadow.
[19:16] Listen, you don't have to choose a
[19:18] shadow. You can choose the realities of
[19:21] God. With David, what he learned is he
[19:23] didn't, you know, David, he didn't run
[19:25] from the enemy. He didn't run from
[19:27] Goliath. He ran towards Goliath. So, we
[19:30] were talking about when David, it was uh
[19:34] what David was running from many times
[19:36] is not the enemy, but it was running in
[19:39] the first case with from a backsliden
[19:42] believer that turned against him.
[19:46] a man in authority, a man who was God's
[19:48] anointed, a man who was in the king of
[19:52] Israel. It was him who turned against
[19:55] David. There's not too many things that
[19:57] cut to the core of hurtful situation
[20:00] than someone within the body of Christ
[20:02] or some preacher that says the kind of
[20:05] words to be a Saul to you and to hurt
[20:08] you and actually to try to kill your
[20:10] influence as Saul tried to kill David.
[20:12] And all this time David's learning, I
[20:14] need a place to run to. I need to get
[20:16] away with it because I can't really come
[20:18] against God's anointed. And so he was in
[20:20] there playing music and anointed in
[20:22] music actually relieved Saul of his evil
[20:25] spirits that had got actually from the
[20:27] Lord because he had been rebellious. God
[20:29] sent he allowed evil spirits to come to
[20:31] him. Then they bring in David. He plays
[20:33] anointed music. It refreshes him. He
[20:36] gets re relieved temporarily. But in
[20:38] those moments, he comes around the
[20:40] corner throwing javelins. Throwing
[20:42] javelins at the new anointed, the the
[20:45] David. David didn't do anything wrong,
[20:47] but he's throwing javelins. And it's
[20:49] coming from somebody within the body of
[20:52] Christ.
[20:54] I'm calling it that to bring it up to
[20:55] date. It's coming from God's anointed
[20:58] king before. It's coming from a
[21:01] preacher. Do I have your ear this
[21:03] morning? These things are more trying
[21:06] sometimes than receiving persecution
[21:10] from the world. When I receive the
[21:12] criticism of lies that are told about
[21:14] me, it hurts more when it comes within
[21:16] our own ranks. It I'm just being honest
[21:18] with you. It hurts. And yet a Saul rises
[21:21] up and he rebelss against God, takes a
[21:24] wrong spirit. You know what he turns his
[21:26] javelin towards? He turns it to some
[21:28] somebody God is beginning to work with
[21:31] and anoint and be refreshed and kill the
[21:34] Goliaths. And Saul gets jealous of that.
[21:37] And instead of saying, "I submit. I'm
[21:39] going to come to your church and I'm
[21:41] going to say David is the God's man and
[21:44] I'm going to submit myself to it." He
[21:45] turns his javelin and starts throwing
[21:48] pot shots at David. That's what David
[21:50] dealt with. Could speak a lot more about
[21:52] it, but a man who wanted to kill him and
[21:55] kill his influence. It was an internal
[21:57] pressure that affected David most. Not
[21:59] the Goliaths of life. Listen now. God
[22:03] gives us strength many times to defeat
[22:04] the Goliath of life. You should never be
[22:06] afraid of a Goliath. Can you say amen?
[22:09] God has called you against the Goliath
[22:11] of life. I tell young people, listen
[22:13] now. David was on the back side of the
[22:15] desert and he was training when there
[22:17] was a bear, when there was a lion, and
[22:19] he took him. He was gaining testimonies
[22:22] cuz someday he didn't know he was going
[22:24] to meet a Goliath.
[22:26] God was teaching that man as he was
[22:28] young as he teaches young young people
[22:30] how to get a hold of God. How to get in
[22:32] the presence of God, how to get into my
[22:34] Bible.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; What are you doing young people? Are you
[22:37] in your phone all day? Get into their
[22:39] Bible. Get into the word of God.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; While you got time because if you get
[22:43] married, your time's cut in half.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; With each kid, the pie's cut even more.
[22:51] You don't have time hardly at all to
[22:53] have those moments to be alone with God.
[22:55] And when you were single, you got them
[22:56] all. Don't waste those moments with God.
[22:59] And David spent time with God. He
[23:01] learned about the anointing. He learned
[23:03] how to sing under the anointing. He
[23:05] learned how to drive away evil spirits.
[23:08] You don't think God's doing something in
[23:09] your life right now, young people, and
[23:11] the trials you're going through. He's
[23:12] training you. How do I get in the
[23:14] spirit? How do I learn how to defeat the
[23:16] enemy? How do I kill this lion? He's
[23:19] preparing you for the Goliaths that are
[23:22] coming in your life.
[23:26] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. He's preparing you for
[23:28] the Goliaths. And God gives the
[23:30] strength. But there's nothing ever more
[23:32] so confusing. Seems like not a Goliath,
[23:36] but fighting being falsely accused,
[23:39] fighting jealousy from others, cruelty
[23:42] from others, unfair conclusions about
[23:44] oursel. It was a a bitter, unsatisfied
[23:48] king. It's bitter, unsatisfied people
[23:52] that was the challenge. It's bitter
[23:54] people in their life. They've always
[23:56] been bitter and they haven't overcome
[23:57] it. It's those bitter people that'll
[24:00] take shots at you. And you know what it
[24:01] is? They want to make you bitter, too.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; And David said, "Lord, help me. Hide me.
[24:11] Let me run from this spirit because I
[24:13] may not be perfect, but I don't want to
[24:16] become a Saul.
[24:18] Can I get an amen this morning?
[24:20] &gt;&gt; God, help me in my character. I don't
[24:23] want to become a Saul. David had his
[24:25] mistakes. David was young. David wasn't
[24:29] perfect by any means, but he fought
[24:31] against becoming. He ran from I don't
[24:34] want to hang around that because I don't
[24:36] want to become a Saul.
[24:39] In the message, we have Sauls.
[24:42] In the message ranks, we have Davids. We
[24:44] have Saul's. We have two different types
[24:45] of leadership. I trust you'll choose the
[24:48] Davids in your life because the under
[24:50] the leadership of David's, you will come
[24:52] into the character for a kingdom age.
[24:54] Can you say amen? If you're under the
[24:56] ministry of a Saul who has become
[24:58] bitter, you'll become that yourself. CJ
[25:01] Williams has really narrowed this down
[25:03] that a way that like the three things he
[25:06] summarized this well. three things and
[25:08] he made the point. He said unbelievers
[25:11] and the world when they run into this
[25:14] these type of three types of trouble he
[25:16] said they run a certain way but we
[25:18] Christians we're to run and flee to
[25:21] Christ. The first trouble is worry.
[25:27] This includes all of the whatifs. Now I
[25:30] want you to listen closely because I'm
[25:32] closing but don't miss these parts. This
[25:34] includes all the what-ifs that we
[25:37] entertain all the time. What if
[25:41] &gt;&gt; the bad possibilities we play out in our
[25:44] minds and all the variables of life that
[25:48] we cannot control.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Fear is a powerful force of the enemy.
[25:55] Fear of the future. Fear of things that
[25:57] haven't even happened yet. And guess
[25:59] what? Probably 95% of them don't ever
[26:01] happen. But you played it out in your
[26:03] mind as if it was going to happen. I got
[26:06] some of your number. I got my number
[26:08] this morning. I hope you're gonna say
[26:09] amen. Listen,
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Satan uses worry and fear of things
[26:14] that's never even happened yet. The next
[26:16] thing is conflict.
[26:20] If you are at odds with someone and you
[26:23] find yourself angry and fed up, I know
[26:26] none of you people in literal life
[26:28] church every has felt this way about
[26:31] someone. So just try to act like you
[26:35] understand this.
[26:37] If you are at odds with someone and you
[26:39] find yourself angry and fed up, you
[26:42] don't need to stew over the situation
[26:44] and plot your next move.
[26:47] You need the guidance of the Lord and
[26:49] the spiritual composure to re-engage the
[26:52] problem with the grace and love that
[26:56] comes from the Holy Ghost.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; Before you go back to that person, first
[27:03] go hide yourself in the Lord.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't run and hide
[27:09] yourself in the Lord, you're putting on
[27:12] the boxing gloves. We get mad at
[27:15] conflict in life and we put the boxing
[27:16] gloves on. Take the gloves off. The last
[27:19] one is weariness.
[27:23] This may be another pandemic around us.
[27:27] People are busy and people are too busy
[27:32] which makes them weary in body, weary in
[27:36] spirit, weary in emotion, on edge,
[27:41] burning their candle at both end. We
[27:44] need to do better at focusing on what is
[27:46] really truly important. But the fact is
[27:49] that if you seek to be faithful and
[27:51] diligent in your calling, you will have
[27:53] a busy life. God designed it that way.
[27:56] but also gave us himself as a hiding
[27:59] place. If you ever find yourself feeling
[28:02] just plain tired,
[28:06] hide yourself in Christ.
