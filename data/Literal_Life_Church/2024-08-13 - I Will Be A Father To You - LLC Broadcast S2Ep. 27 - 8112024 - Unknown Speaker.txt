I've learn that I can always count it all Grace count it [Music] all count it all gra count all joy 2 Corinthians chapter 6 if you turn with me and would just read this portion of scripture starting at verse 14 be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath right ousness with unrighteousness what communion hath light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with baale and what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel so the Lord is calling for a separation here because you have to realize if you are saying you have Light Within you you can only go so far in a union and a fellowship with someone who don't have light this is not to make us better but this is God calls for a separation from Darkness God calls calls for separation from friendships that is unequally yolked God calls for that can you say amen and what Concord that Christ with Baal what part he that believeth with an Infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God ha go as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them he doesn't dwell in Idols he dwells in men Sons and Daughters of God I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out come out from among them and be ye separate sayith the Lord and touch not the unclean things so the association or the blending of something that's not you has a potential of you touching the wrong things in your life touching something unclean come out of that touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and this is the part that I want to get to when you come out of that when you're willing to come out really feel the call hear the call and when you're willing to come out guess who's waiting to receive you God said I'll receive you and I will be a father to you because I think when you take the painful journey of coming out of all that you're going to need a father to guide you you don't need a dictator can you say Amen am but you need a father and he says I will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty to say the words that I will be a father to you it's pretty personal it's pretty intimate um it it it's it's not something coming from a system or a denomination or uh something that would be insensitive or something that's not a feeling but when you use the term of Father and Sons and Daughters you're talking about a family you're talking about one of the most intimate things that you can have because we all have our families and so God is being very close to uh by saying this word and if God could just drop in our hearts this morning sitting here the significance of when he says to us I will be a father to you I just pray that drops in your heart because most of us in this generation do not not have the greatest image of a father matter of fact every Father Here is in all that his his strengths he has flaws he's not the perfect father I know that every man in here if they raise a hand and say I'm not a perfect father but there is a perfect heavenly father and the reason that we have it is there's a craving within us to have a father guide us and to have a true father and God says to your life today I don't care who you are I want to be a father to you in a generation that most did not have a good image of a father he says I will be a father to your life and so he doesn't say here that I I will be go a God to you uh because that's more distant how many knows what the meaning to God is God just means an object of worship and so God can be God to us but he doesn't say here I will be God to you because that is a more distant relationship this what he says when I'll be a father is more relational it it's it's it's closer can you say Amen it's not just he's this distant object of worship that we get on our needs and we bow before him and we worship him but he's a distant God matter of fact I've said this before matter of fact the world actually likes a God that's distant how many know that they don't want a God that's personal and gets in their personal life they don't want a God that lives in their home by his presence they haven't invited a god like that so they create their own God that they can do what they want in their lives but they can still go to church and worship him I'll tell you I don't want to serve a god like that I don't want my God distant I want him to be a supernatural God in my life every day guiding me in every decision that I make and if he has to correct me of son I'd rather have my correction from the heavenly father than anyone else because I know he does it for loving his heart towards me so people would say I don't want to God that distant I mean I remember B Midler she wrot she wrote a song or she sang a song it was at the top of the church in the world from a distance God is watching us and it was such a uh it was a tear jerker it just moved your heart that they could be singing from a distance God is watching us God is watching us God is watching us from a distance and it was warm and fuzzy and everybody cried and oh oh God is watching us from a distance and I just sang A secular song in church and I'm going to get in trouble please don't be offended at that but I'm songs in the world tell where they're at and they don't want a God that's a supernatural God living with you every day and God involved in your life they don't want a god they create their own Jesus they create their own God and they want him to be distant but this is not the God we serve this is a God that's a personal God if you're listening online today or wherever you're listening on the broadcast God had a family from the beginning God predestinated a world of Sons and Daughters of God God has a family God has an offspring God has his own Sons and Daughters just like fathers this morning have their own Sons and Daughters God has Offspring God has sons and daughters and he had him in his mind before the foundation of the world God has an offspring he was the first father the term father was created by God himself none of us know how to do the father thing right without catching a proper image of the heavenly father and so you need a revelation that he is your father that he says I'm your father but here he says I will be a father to you and you will be my sons I will be a father and you might draw a quick lesson that there's a difference in just having children to give you the title of father or being a father to those children right right God says I'll be a father to you whatever a father means I'm going to be that to you I'm going to supply that need in your life I'm not just distant saying that I'm your you know I'm your father you're my son no I want to be a father I want to be Hands-On I want to be give you guidance can you say Amen but here he says I want to be a father to you and so you have to look at these words uh before now as we look at the context here of 2 Corinthians and we look at what Paul was talking about as I said he's calling for a separation Paul is ministering and calling for a separation how many knows that God calls for separations in our lives God called for separation in our Father Abraham from his Kindred from his people and and and he could not move on to the blessings until he separated himself from his Kindred he said I I'm calling you into another land and so he shook hands politely with all of his family members and said I love you and I I never lack loving you matter of fact he never lost his love for lot he never lost his love for a family he prayed for them he was the only one that was praying when lot was getting ready to come under judgment the only one praying for his family members was Lot may God help us never to give up on our family members may God help us to never give up on a wayward son or a daughter may we continue to bring him Before the Throne of God may you never give up on that husband may you never give up on that wife sometimes you're the only hope that they have is that you're bringing their name before the throne and Abraham's lot's Only Hope was Abraham praying for the Deliverance of lot so he loved him when he shook hands with him and said listen I'm going God is calling me out I've got to go there had to be a separation and how many know there was fighting between lot's herdsman and Abraham's heardman tension was in the camp and nobody really knew what the tension was all about but God come down and says it's time for you to separate time for you to move on God bless you lot I've got to go my we got to go our separate ways God calls for separations in our lives and now I could do another hour sermon on what he calls for separations from and you'd be very surprised praise the Lord because if God knows you have he has something better in mind for you then he calls for a separation how may believe that Christians are called to separate from the things of the world that's basic you say well I want to be a Christian but I want all this worldly stuff no no God calls for a separation does he do it to be mean to you no he has it because he's got something better in mind for you and anybody that can go through the pain of laying things down I'm through with this I'm done with this as of this day I'm finished with this God I love you more than I love this habit I love you more and I'm I'm looking forward to what you have for me better than I do this habit so today I'm laying it down I'm separating from it because I love you more than this worldly thing that's when we're talking about setting you up for a candidate for the Holy Ghost and everybody here needs the Holy Ghost it's the oil can you say Amen five virgins didn't have oil they were Christians but they didn't have oil and five had oil and when the call came to go out then they were caught up in a Rapture only for one thing all of them were good Christians but one had five hat oil and if we want to set ourselves for a candidate to receive the spirit of God you can do it this morning by coming to an altar in your heart are coming to this alt say I am through and finished with the things of the world because I know what God has for me me is better than what I'm holding on to somebody ought to say praise the Lord God calls for separation from things of the world God calls from separation from friends that are not doing you very well God calls for a separation not that he hates you but that he loves you oh he calls us away from his separation from false unions the wrong Fellowship this is what Paul's talking about you can't be unequally Yol with somebody you can't be unequally Yol you can't claim Christianity and claim to pornography it doesn't work that way you can't you you you can't form close relationships that are unions that are unequal with where you want to go unequally yoke is to to uh oxes that are trying to go separate ways they can't go forward at all you see it's an unequal Yol or the different weight is a different thing and so you know all about that but you can't you can't be unequally yolked false unions the wrong Fellowship touching an unclean thing an unequal yoke then listen now when you are I wish I had another hour on that but listen now I'm going to be short so you need to really listen to everything I'm saying is that when God calls for a separation and you're willing to do it it's going to be painful your life is going to hurt a little bit your flesh is going to feel feel the pain your flesh is going to resist because remember this flesh doesn't ever want to serve God never will want to serve God this flesh cannot inherit the kingdom of God your mind has to be G brought under subjection because your mind doesn't want to serve God that's right the only hope is the Holy Ghost brings this body under subjection and said listen you're going to go and do what the Holy Ghost tells me to do not what my flesh says but if the painful thing God calls for a separation I wonder if the emotions hurt Abraham as he's shaking hands with lot and saying I've got to go God's called me to something here and I've got to separate but emotionally family members separating that's a tough thing it plays on our emotions but there has to be something deeper than emotional friendships that friendship is not based on something solid it it's just a shallow Rel relationship and there has to be something deeper in your life that if God calls our separation the emotions might hold you together I think of a a young guy and young girl and there's no solid base for them to be together as boyfriend and girlfriend or for a marriage it's just an emotional or it's sexual or fleshly it's just there's there's no God in it at all it's just an emotional attachment or or sexual attachment I can tell you you have no foundation for a marriage can you say Amen you're setting yourself up for failure but when two people get the Holy Ghost they got the foundation something to start on then when they connect emotionally then eventually after their wedding day they connect sexually then all that has meaning to it because you have a foundation to build off of sometimes God calls for separations and it's painful and maybe that's why if he says come out of her my people come out of all that separate you're you're my people you're my sons and daughters you're not that you're this and it hurts so bad to come away maybe that's why he's at the other side saying you know what I'm here waiting for you can you say Amen it's kind of like a breakup when we come out of a breakup we're missing things we're feeling bad we're feeling a void we're feeling hurt how many girls have ever had a breakup and you go through those days of feeling aoid you feeling something's missing you feel hurt humans keep forming bad relationship and then breakup after breakup after breakup and they get harder and harder cuz they keep forming bad relationships all right you can get quiet on me that's fine I know I'm telling the truth I know this is scriptural I know this is true from evidence and none of us are exempt from the human feeling of a breakup or a cutting off of a wrong friendship or a wrong relationship none of us are immune for not feeling that and it leaves a void it leaves something missing but I'm here to tell you if he's waiting at the other end of it he's ready to be a father to you and feel what you're missing in your life can you say Amen our Lord the heavenly father he's ready to be a father to you why do we have all these breakups and a a a divorc world and why do we have this it's an adulterous world yes it is it's an adulterous generation it's an adulterous world that destroys true Healthy Families It's a cruel world it kills us inside it kills families it kills marriage relationships it's it's shallow relationships and so but it kills it's an adulterous re uh generation and so you have this whole thing that I could spend more time on but I just want you to listen this morning that you live in a an adultery type generation and and an adultery generation breaks up families it breaks up good relationships it it breaks up things and gives you the wrong relationships ones that aren't committed ones ones that fail can you say Amen just it's all full of because an adulter adultery is something that a man would go with another M woman and not keep his commitment to his wife and so he goes with another one the woman goes with another man it's an adulterous generation that's why we have the divorce is because it's adulterous it's it's not committed can you say Amen it's lacking these true strong bonds and when you have now 50 60 70 80 years I'll just put that timeline on it you have broken families you have broken marriages It's a cruel world it kills us on the inside and the music world is full of songs about breakups and hurts can you say Amen it's an insensitive cruel world of friendships going cold and trust is lost and you have all these songs that endorse or actually I should say help you to come through the emotional time of breakups uh Taylor Swift has a ton of them these songwriters have a ton of them and they're all talking and it helps supposedly they help young people somebody understands the breakups the breakups have you ever thought of getting a hold of Christ that you don't have any more relationships that the guy uses you and leaves you have you ever thought of a father that loves you that will not give up on you have you ever thought about a relationship that would not uh turn you down but would stay with you and be committed to you and love you can you say Amen you need that first in your life or you're going to get hurt in the world you might get hurt in the church if you have the wrong relationship but I'll be a father to you just all these songs you know it's like you know I Young people when they go through these things and it's a wrong right shap and God orders a separation it's so painful and you get and you the girls she she's on the couch eating ice cream for 14 days she's cry she's grabs her little guitar I'm going to send him a song he did I thought he loved me you're the reason for the tear drops on my guitar and she sings the whole thing she puts it on her phone she sends it to him I'll get back at him and he gets the he gets the text and she she's he's listening you're the reason for the tear drops on my guitar and he's he's on the end so he calls her up he leaves a message here's a quarter call someone who cares insensitive cruel listen we got thousands of songs that endorse all this stupidity absolute stupidity and let me go further to say it's filth it's broken relationships it's a broken world do you want that or do you want something better that I'm preaching in the gospel this morning a father who loves you a father who's committed to you a father who went to the cross for you can you say Amen a father who sacrificed his life for you you make the choice but it's a broken world and you can't find any stability out there you find instability in emotions and sometimes even in the church if you choose the wrong relationships and you'll find songs to sing along with it Sons and Daughters of God to come in the church today and raise their hands freely and I don't have to get in between you and your relationship with God that you can raise your hand and say you know what church is about today it's not coming and watching other people at the church it's not depending on just the friendships in a church praise the Lord if get friendships but I don't come to this church and bring my family and do this because I'm depending on whether you like me or not I come to fellowship with the father and worship him I come to get a better relationship can I get an amen this morning this is the reason why we come to a church are they preaching the word and can I come into relationship with the heavenly father because I believe I'm a son and if I'm a son I want to hear from my father this morning somebody say praise the Lord that's what a church should be can you say Amen it's not who's the biggest church it's not who's got all the singing and the music that's all a sesh can you say Amen it's about are you in a relationship with this father glory be to God I think of the prodical son and it said speaks everything of the Revival of today some brothers asked me a few weeks ago what's the final Revival I took the prodical son because you know what the prodical son he's out there messing his life up doing all this stuff the Elder son he actually got critical cuz he's doing his duty and doing everything right and this guy he spins his inheritance he runs away and when the prodical son came to him himself I've got to go back he had no intentions of having a relationship with the father he just wanted to go back like a servant he said cuz I was eating better there I was doing better and so I'll go in in humility and repent and say listen I just want to work in the barn I just want to work in the manure I know that I have ruined my place as a son even though I am a son I've ruined that I'm not coming so he comes in hum and he starts to walk towards his father in humility and his father his father starts running towards him bring the fatted calf let's start a celebration let's start a Revival what's the Revival about Sons coming back into relationship with the father I didn't have a good home life I didn't have a good domestic life I suffer all the time because of it there's a family breakup all the time seems like taking place but I can hold to an anchor this morning I have a father he knows my name somebody ought to praise this the Lord this morning for the Revelation that if everything breaks up I have a father who will never leave me one of the greatest downfalls of this nation number one is to leave the word of God but second of all when that happens fatherhood is broken and we're heading towards a figure of 50% of children children without a father figure in their life and then a bunch more who have a father figure who's abusing them and when you have that for 50 60 years however been longer than that you have a breakdown of the entire world and men in prison 80% of men in prison did not have a good relationship with their father or didn't have a father and it has fruits that come from it and in that generation of this downfall there's Redemption because I can tell you if you didn't have a good one he's standing here today saying I will be a father to you thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall life. church and if you would
