[Music] [Applause] Jesus Jesus oh Jesus [Music] come here to me closer to me [Music] Jesus Jesus here in Deuteronomy chap 1 and verse 34 says and the Lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth and swear saying surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which I swear to give unto your fathers now this is a pretty stern word from the Lord and if you if you know the setting this is speaking to the new generation and it's speaking also to the generation that came out under a prophet and they had acted so childish and dealt with the message so wrong that God says that generation they're not even going to be able to go into the land he says this he called it an evil generation I didn't but it became evil and these were people that had come under a prophet's message but they became an evil generation and they shall not see the good land which I swear to give unto your fathers save Caleb the son of Jep he he shall see it and Caleb was old so he's one of the old guys that got included and to to him will I give the land that which that he hath trotten upon and to his children because he hath wholly followed the Lord now here's the distinction an old man gets in out of the old generation for one thing he's wholly followed me in other words you can't do this by being one foot in and one foot out God knows that you can't be second guessing the rest of your life you got to be all in and all that old generation one day one day they were in one day they were out if they ran out of food they say oh we should have been back in Egypt and they're up and down you don't know where they stand from day to day but there's some old guys like Caleb and said I'm all in I'm ready to go to my promise so because he wholly followed the Lord and it's just that simple he was Allin I believe this thing 110% I believe the promise of us going in land I don't want to go there so Caleb you get included and also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes Moses said the the Lord got angry with me saying thou also shall not go in Moses said God told me I can't even go in Prophet can't even go in because of his anger but Joshua the son of none which shall stand standeth before me he shall go in thither encourage him for he shall Co cause Israel to inherit it so the the the Holy Ghost Ministry after the prophets gone will be used the Joshua ministry will be used to help encourage and bring the people into the land moreover there's another class included your little ones the new generation I'm including them they get to go in praise be to God your little ones which he said should be a prey remember back in Egypt and they ran out of water and they do and in front of their kids they said we should go back to Egypt our kids are going to be appr prey to all the animals and they're all going to die and and they were complaining that's what their fathers were saying but God said no they're still here and guess what they get to go in and you don't hate to be so Stern about it that's what God's saying your little ones that you said would be destroyed in the wilderness they weren't destroyed because I was watching over them and guess what I'm taking them into the Promised Land by the way they didn't earn anything those kids to get that place in the pr land God's grace just said I'll take them in he said which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil look at the children they had no knowledge between good and evil they shall go in thither and unto them will I give it and they shall possess it praise the Lord now I want to add in Hebrews chapter 3 in Hebrews Paul refers to this generation that God was grieved with Hebrews chapter 3 and verse 8 and throughout the Bible God in Psalms in Proverbs All Through the Bible he refers to the fathers Jesus referred to the Jews fathers your fathers and most of the time it wasn't good your fathers because I want to talk about this morning moving on from fathers who messed it up that's my title moving on from fathers who mess it up because it keeps returning referring to the fathers the fathers did this so the new generation had a challenge that they had to respect their fathers but they could not move on to their promise unless they exited certain characteristics of their fathers and Jesus was Stern about it he looked at the Jews and says your fathers ate Mana in the wilderness and they're dead I am the bread of life I'm not a temporal blessing that you get and then when you don't get it oh what happened God where's the Mana they ate off a Mana but it's only a temporal blessing this group shall not eat off a temporal blessing they'll eat off the Eternal bread of life amen he said Harden not your hearts verse 8 as in the provocation that's from the word provoke the people provoking God in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when the your fathers tempted me your fathers I want you to remember that term your fathers tempted me proved me and they saw my works for 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said how do they do always air in their where there's something wrong with the heart there's air in their heart and they have not known my ways this is a generation that could celebrate the works they love the works of God but they never learn the ways of God his character so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my arrest take heed Brethren lest there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief and departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin remember that's not sin smoking and drinking that's unbelief unbelief hardens your heart you start to disbelieve things of God you start getting your heart hardened don't do that don't let your heart become hard your heart's supposed to be free can you say Amen but unbelief if you keep holding on to it will harden your heart don't let that happen take e brotherr lest there be an evil any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but exhort one another daily wi do called today lest any of you should be hardened to the deceitfulness of sin for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast Until the End while it is said today if ye will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as in the provocation so I want to speak on the new generation a little bit last Sunday we talked about fathers and God being a father to you I will be a father to you but I do want to speak about the new generation in the relation to what they had to deal with in the their fathers and uh you know God always has his eye on the new generation am God does not hold the sins of the fathers on them uh but he gives them a chance to make it better I know the scripture many of you thought of when I said that is what about the scripture that says the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children to the third and fourth generation how many know that scripture some of you thought of that when I said that God doesn't hold the sins of the father on the new generation but he gives them a chance to make it better I know the scripture that says the sins of the fathers and actually that scripture shows us the power of a of the father's influence upon a life that if the father's not right or does some things wrong it has residual effects for many generations can you say amen that's Bible now it has the residual effects for many many generations and it it shows how powerful the residual effect can be the sins of the father fathers can be visited and that's why our family life in America is broke down today that's why marriages are broke down today many times it goes back to men who lose their place men who lose men who exit the home last Sunday we talked about God talking about the fatherless he always was concerned about the fatherless there's something about it that the fatherless whether by uh whether by death or whether by exiting the home or whether not being the right kind of father or whether it's Father's abusing the family or whether the father's provoking the children how many you know the Bible talks about that there's several reasons why a child can be fatherless even when a father is physically in the home and this has residual effects I'm I'm reading an article here that I will not comment too much about this morning because it's 27 pages but I've been very moved by some of the statistics and the the the emphasis this man this professor gives about he calls this article a world without fathers and in the 1990s he goes goes back and does the statistics starting from the 1960s when we began with a lot of divorces we then the 70s and ' 80s we got into a lot of unwed mothers in other words there was somebody who fathered them but he was ex he wasn't a part of the family so now you keep going to abuse and you keep going to women now that live on their own and you got many scenarios that remove the father actually Hollywood uh discredit the position of a father seemed like I should be having some more amens here this morning this generation has had an attack and not only the families and the word of God but the residual effect of that is to attack the fathers that children most of us did not grow up with a perfect father most of us grow up fatherless even if you had a good father you're still spiritually fatherless because you haven't met your true Heavenly Father until you come back in contact with him and he tells you I will be a father to you glory be to God aren't you glad if you didn't have a good father this morning he said I will be a father to you you'll be my children I'll take you in my arms and I'll nurture you whatever you were missing I'll provide through my fatherhood glory be to God and so now this I I like I said I don't want to read much of it the decline of fatherhood is one of the most basic unexpected and extraordinary social trends of our time its Dimensions can be captured in a single statistic in just three decades between 1960 and 1990 the percentage of children living apart from biological fathers more than doubled from 177% to 36% by the turn of the century nearly 50% of American children may be going to sleep each evening without being able to say good night to their dads no one predicted this trend few researchers or government agencies have monitored it and is not widely discussed even today but the decline of fatherhood is a major force behind many of the most many of the most disturbing problems that plague American society crime and delinquency premature sexuality out of wedlock births to teenagers deteriorating educational achievement depression substance abuse an alienation among adolescents and the growing number of women and children in poverty and this is through research this many of these things came because a father wasn't present that's right the current generation of Children and Youth may be the first in our nation's history to be less well off psychologically socially economically and morally than their parents were at the same age the United States observes Senator Daniel Patrick he said may maybe this may be the first Society in history in which children are distinctly worse off than their adult than the adults even as This calamity unfolds our cultural view of fatherhood itself is changing few people doubt the fundamental importance of mothers but fathers more and more the question of whether fathers are really necessary is being raised many would answer no and maybe not and to the degree that fathers are still thought uh and to the degree that and to the to the degree that fathers are still thought necessary fatherhood is said by many to be merely a social role that others can play mothers can play it Partners stepfathers uncles and aunts grandparents perhaps the script can even be Rewritten and the whole role changed or dropped this is the devil's work because when you re remove the true image of a father you removing something that God created from the beginning and every human being needs it or they feel insecure they have fears they can't approach life with security when the father's absent or they don't have a right father they were abused by their father there was a time in past when father lessness was far more common than it is today but death was to blame back in the 17th century they hit a time and and when we went through the wars there was a lot of women a lot of men were killed so because of death the fathers weren't present but today not divorce dissertion out of wedlock births in early 17th century Virginia only estimated 31% of white children reached 18 uh with both parents still alive that percentage climbed to 50% by the early 18th century to 72 72% by the turn of the present century and close to its current level by 1940 today well over 90% of Americans youngsters reach 18 with two living parents almost all of today's fatherless children have fathers who are alive well and perfectly capable of shouldering the responsibilities of fatherhood but they have exited for many reasons they have exited they're physically alive somewhere but they're not not being fathers so you know I could go on and on but you you can read these things it's it's called A World Without fathers and we live in a world without fathers and so now I want to take the spiritual side today but most of the generation most of the generation has daddy issues and that affects them most of our generation including within the church has daddy issues sometimes unresolved from the past and besides all the the absent father the dead father the divorced father the father that's alive but he won't come and see his children then you have fathers living in the home that are not taking up their role as fathers they're they're they're they're working but they're not connected at all with their children so you got that issue so they're there but they're not really there then you have abuse which I have things that show the fruits from a father abusing the kids whether physically or abusing the mom physically or abusing them mentally or of using them economically where he's not providing so you have that and then let me bring up just one in the Bible That's not mentioned by this professor and that is fathers who provoke their children to anger this is detrimental and God said in Ephesians it says that fathers don't provoke don't stir up don't do the things that make more anger in your children teach them gu give them guidance rebuke them but love them can you say Amen give affection to them them but don't provoke them and God says that because even when he's pre present provoking the children this can have long-term effects by how the father acts is this okay with everybody so you know going back to the scripture the the is true that that the if you bring up Exodus 25 we have that scripture because some of you may be thought of it the iniquities of the fathers and sins of the fathers of built is is trickles down to the the uh the children to the third and fourth generation I want to just clarify it though because Exodus 20 and verse 5 if you guys have that back there we'll just read it I didn't have it here Exodus 20 and verse 5 let's see if that's the one and thou shalt not bow thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me now that's that let's skip to Exodus 34 and7 and see how it's worded Exodus 34:7 so these are saying that just because you're a third and fourth generation doesn't mean you get a free pass the sins of the fathers can be visited upon you how many's ever known people that can't stand their father but they start acting like him and they start abusing their children the power effect I don't want to do that I hate that and they start doing it themselves they start treating their children the same way because see without without the Holy Ghost without a power the life of Jesus Christ in you there's nothing to break that but thankfully for the blood of Jesus Christ there's something that can brace the curse this is but look how it's worded here keeping Mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty so in other words he's a loving father he's he forgives iniquity in transgression and sin will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children upon the children's children upon the unto the third and fourth generation it says it again but it's it's prefaced it's it's it's the verse thing he says is that God is a merciful god he forgives iniquity so when when the new generation can come to God and say God forgive me let me not continue this God forgives the iniquity of the fathers and doesn't visit it upon the children God's Mercy is the answer can you say amen amen in other words mercy and forgiveness has the power to break curses I'm going to say it again as simple as it is you were looking for a great Revelation this morning and a great thing here's a revelation for you take a hold of it can you say Amen that that that mercy and forgiveness true mercy and forgiveness with God and with fathers and with parents has the power to break curses if you go to the mercy and forgiveness of the father it can break curses generational curses are broken by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ gener I don't care how deep it is I don't care how bad it is generational curses are broken by the blood of Jesus Christ God DS in in a realm of motives and intense the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any s and deserves the thoughts and intents of the heart the motives the intents the deeper part why am I doing this why do I have such nervousness it may be for other reasons why am I feeling insecure my whole life why am I fearful all the time and you have to go deep within yourself God reveal it to me so that something deep down there the motive the attent is just this thing that keeps irritating me and making me emotionally unstable for Life go to the core and go with God and say God reveal it to me and if something has been done in the past that is affecting me I need to find the power of the cross of Jesus Christ Lord you've forgiven me but I need more of the power of the cross I need it to help my anxiety can I get an amen this morning I need more than just to know I'm forgiven and that's good but I need the power to relieve me of past anxiety that I can be what I was supposed to be and that's free free in my heart free in my mind and then when I come up against it again because we can be set free and the devil's got something for something else tomorrow for us because he don't want you free so something else pops up that's when you have the courage to say the same God that delivered me yesterday is the same God can help me today and Christ can come and change impossible things I love to be around more and more a group of people and we have some sitting here this morning the curses of their fathers have been broken from their lives they live in Victory they they come from a divorced home they come from a father that didn't do it right but they're living in Victory as a Christian because it's not a death it's not a death sentence on their life God brought life to them and I can live with Joy about the future I'm moving on can you say Amen I'm moving on Hallelujah this word is taking me somewhere I'm not bound to the pulpit I'm not bound to the pulpit this word says I can move on even when I'm getting wore out I can still keep running cuz I'm excited the word is taking me somewhere thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our
