[11:01] There

[11:07] river that
[11:11] flows from
[11:14] deep
[11:16] within. Oh, has you have you touched
[11:18] that water? Oh,
[11:23] there
[11:25] is a
[11:28] fountain. What does it do that

[11:51] waters. Oh, there
[11:55] is a
[11:58] vast
[12:01] sun. Thank you, Lord. We know
[12:07] there
[12:09] is a
[12:14] river that
[12:18] never
[12:20] shall run on
[12:23] dry. Next one.
[12:26] Oh, there were
[12:29] there
[12:31] thirsty
[12:36] woman who was
[12:39] drawing
[12:42] from the
[12:45] well. Oh, hallelujah.
[12:48] Her
[12:50] life was
[12:52] ruined and
[12:58] wasted. Her
[13:00] soul was
[13:03] bound for heaven. Think about your
[13:07] testimony in that woman. Oh, but
[13:11] then she
[13:14] met the
[13:16] master. Aren't you glad tonight? Oh, who
[13:23] told of
[13:25] her great
[13:28] sin. Oh yes, Lord. He said, "Oh, he he
[13:32] said, if you
[13:36] drink this
[13:41] water, for you'll
[13:43] [Music]
[13:45] never
[13:47] thirst
[13:49] again. And there is a river tonight
[13:53] for
[13:56] there
[13:58] is a
[14:01] river. It flows and it
[14:06] flows from
[14:08] [Music]
[14:09] deep
[14:11] within. Hallelujah.
[14:15] And
[14:18] there
[14:20] is a
[14:22] [Music]
[14:22] [Applause]
[14:25] fountain that
[14:28] frees the
[14:30] soul from sin. Hallelujah. Yes, Lord.
[14:35] Oh, come tonight. Oh, just
[14:39] come
[14:42] to these
[14:46] waters. Oh, there
[14:50] is a
[14:53] vast
[14:56] supply. Yes, Lord. Oh, and
[15:02] there there is a
[15:08] river that
[15:12] never
[15:14] shall run
[15:18] dry. Hallelujah. Let's all stand
[15:20] tonight.
[15:23] Over and
[15:25] over he molds me and makes
[15:32] me
[15:34] into his
[15:37] likeness. He
[15:39] fashions the clay.
[15:43] What I Oh, the
[15:45] soul of
[15:49] honor I
[15:51] am today. All because and it's
[15:56] all because my
[15:59] Jesus didn't throw the cliff. We take it
[16:03] up
[16:06] one. Empty and broken.
[16:10] empty and
[16:13] broken. I came back to
[16:19] him of the
[16:21] soul
[16:25] unworthy. So scarred by
[16:29] sin, but he did
[16:32] not despair.
[16:35] He started
[16:37] over again. And I blessed the day. Oh,
[16:42] and
[16:43] I bless the day. He didn't
[16:48] throw
[16:50] away. And over and
[16:54] over and over.
[16:58] He holds me and makes me a slord
[17:05] into his
[17:07] likeness. He
[17:10] fashions the
[17:13] clay of the
[17:16] soul
[17:19] of I
[17:22] am today.
[17:25] And it's all because
[17:29] Jesus didn't throw the clay
[17:36] away. Oh, can we sing this last one? He
[17:39] is the potter. He is Hallelujah. the
[17:44] potter. I am the
[17:48] clay. Yes, Lord.
[17:51] molded in his
[17:55] image. He wants me to
[17:59] stay. But when I
[18:03] stumble and
[18:05] fall and my
[18:09] vessel breaks. Yes, Lord. He just picks
[18:14] up the pieces.
[18:17] He got to
[18:19] throw his car
[18:22] away
[18:25] over and
[18:27] over. Oh, he holds me and
[18:34] embracing
[18:36] into his likeness.
[18:40] He
[18:41] fashions the
[18:44] clay of the
[18:47] soul of
[18:50] honor. I am
[18:58] today
[19:02] [Music]
[19:06] Jesus. He holds me.
[19:10] and raise
[19:12] me
[19:14] into his
[19:17] likeness. He
[19:20] fashioned the
[19:23] clay, a
[19:26] vessel of
[19:29] honor
[19:30] I am
[19:34] today. And it's
[19:36] all because
[19:40] Jesus didn't
[19:42] throw the clay away once
[19:46] again
[19:49] over and over.
[19:53] He molds me and makes
[19:58] me
[20:00] into his
[20:03] likeness. He
[20:05] fashions the
[20:09] clay of
[20:12] vessel of
[20:14] honor. Lord Jesus, I
[20:18] am
[20:20] today. And it's
[20:22] all because
[20:26] Jesus didn't
[20:28] throw the clay
[20:33] away. Thank you, Lord. Amen. 1 Peter
[20:36] chapter 5 verse
[20:39] 5-7. 1 Peter chapter 5 verse 5-7.
[20:45] And likewise, ye younger, submit
[20:47] yourselves unto the elder. Yay, all of
[20:51] you be subject one to another, and be
[20:54] clothed with humility. For God resisteth
[20:58] the proud, and giveth grace to the
[21:01] humble. So if you're looking for a
[21:04] channel, if you're looking for an inlet,
[21:06] if you're looking for the the basics,
[21:09] the basics of how to move the heart of
[21:11] God and him to move towards you or to
[21:14] move towards your need, it's the first
[21:16] thing they give and that is that he
[21:18] resists the proud. But when there's true
[21:20] humility shown, then you're going in his
[21:22] direction. And when you're going in his
[21:24] direction, he starts coming in your
[21:26] direction. You see how this works then?
[21:28] And there's so that shows us there's
[21:30] certain things there's certain attitudes
[21:32] there's certain things that we if we
[21:34] hold on to that it's it's not going to
[21:36] draw the heart of God. And so we have to
[21:39] be very um mindful of these things. So I
[21:42] love these scriptures because humble
[21:43] yourselves there therefore verse six
[21:45] humble yourselves therefore under the
[21:47] mighty hand of God. How many believe
[21:48] he's a mighty a mighty God? Yeah. And
[21:51] he's able to step in with his mighty
[21:54] hand. Humble yourselves therefore under
[21:56] the mighty hand of God that he may exalt
[21:59] you in due time. All this is about your
[22:02] it's it's about you coming towards him
[22:04] and then him coming toward you. Casting
[22:07] all your care upon him for he carth for
[22:12] you. Amen. May God bless the word
[22:14] tonight in the name of Jesus Christ. You
[22:16] may be seated.
[22:20] I want to thank God tonight that I can
[22:23] have 100% freedom to preach all that God
[22:27] has put on my heart without pressure
[22:30] from a denomination or from inter
[22:33] internal expectations from you or
[22:35] anybody. I I want to really thank God
[22:38] for that. We don't thank God for enough
[22:39] for these freedoms and blessings that I
[22:41] could actually take my Bible and
[22:43] whatever God inspires me out of the
[22:44] word, I can preach on it tonight with no
[22:47] denominational limitations. And we there
[22:49] was a ministers meeting a few uh months
[22:51] ago. I think it was last year actually.
[22:53] And we're having some good regional
[22:55] ministers meetings. So real healthy and
[22:56] good fellowship. And each time the
[22:59] brothers get up and do a presentation of
[23:00] a certain subject and we all learn from
[23:02] it. And so one time they had the subject
[23:04] of the sovereignty of the local church.
[23:06] And they wanted each minister to speak.
[23:08] What does it mean the sovereignty of the
[23:09] local church? Because brother Bram says
[23:11] each church is sovereign under God.
[23:13] Under God and the pastors the head.
[23:15] We're not under a denominational head of
[23:17] headquarters. And so each church is
[23:19] sovereign. So they wanted to preach on
[23:20] they want us to each one preach. And so
[23:22] nobody was jumping up. So I said, "Well,
[23:24] I'll talk a little bit about Well, then
[23:25] when I realized that I would talk about
[23:27] it, um I hadn't really studied. I didn't
[23:29] know too much about it." So I basically
[23:31] got up and I did what I did tonight. I
[23:33] said, "Brothers," I said, "I I don't
[23:36] I'll just give a few scriptures on it
[23:38] that I believe it's important that each
[23:40] church is not under some headquarters
[23:41] somewhere." But I said, 'I can tell you
[23:44] that for 35 years being a pastor, I have
[23:47] enjoyed the benefit of God's each church
[23:49] being sovereign. And I said, I want to
[23:52] thank God for that. That I know what it
[23:54] feels like to not be under somebody's
[23:56] thumb telling me what to do, pressuring
[23:59] me what to do. You can't preach on that,
[24:00] you can preach on this. So, I just
[24:02] wanted to echo that to you again tonight
[24:03] and to God. I'm thankful for that
[24:05] tonight. And uh tonight will be an
[24:07] example because I'm just I just been uh
[24:10] I'm just going to be exploring tonight
[24:12] into a little bit of a new subject. And
[24:15] uh so we're just just laying a few
[24:17] foundations for it, but it's not
[24:19] something that necessarily that I
[24:22] haven't been considering for many years
[24:23] now that I've been uh going over in my
[24:26] mind and my heart. And uh to be honest
[24:28] with you, as a pastor, I've been on a
[24:30] little bit of a inward journey. It's
[24:32] been an inward journey for me, just me
[24:35] and God. And uh for my own deeper
[24:38] discovery of myself and my life in
[24:40] Christ, uh and you know, whenever you
[24:43] find more uh of your life in Christ and
[24:46] more of yourself and how the enemy and
[24:48] your weaknesses and study those things,
[24:50] how the enemy uses, whenever you go on
[24:52] that journey, it's real funny. I was in
[24:54] the chiropractor office today and they
[24:56] always do unique things in there and I
[24:58] walk in just to get my back adjusted and
[25:01] the nurse said, "We're we're taking
[25:03] we're saying, "What's the first thought
[25:04] come that come to you this morning?
[25:06] What's a good point to encourage
[25:07] everybody in the office today?" So, what
[25:09] what's your thought today? And we're
[25:10] going to type it in and they'll probably
[25:12] put it on the walls and everything. And
[25:13] so, let me think for a minute. And so I
[25:15] thought I said you I said the journey of
[25:18] the heart is a dangerous one and uh a
[25:22] scary one but it's always worth it.
[25:24] That's what I said
[25:26] and everybody was quiet in the whole
[25:28] office, you know, they're trying to
[25:31] ponder this deep thought from a pastor,
[25:34] you know, but it's the first thing that
[25:35] come to my mind, you know, but I can say
[25:37] personally that I'm I'm kind of on that
[25:40] journey now. And I don't know why we
[25:41] wait so long. Some of us wait too long
[25:43] to do it, but you can be a Christian for
[25:45] years, but you just desire to go deeper.
[25:48] and you just desire that if there's any
[25:50] hindrances and things in my life that
[25:52] I'm holding on to, not talking about sin
[25:54] as such, but things that's in the heart
[25:56] that's unresolved or complexes, whatever
[25:59] they I'm just on a real uh close journey
[26:01] with the Lord with that. And I don't
[26:03] know how long that'll be, but all I know
[26:05] is when we do that, it's more freedom.
[26:08] We can be ourselves more in Christ. And
[26:11] uh and and then I always study these
[26:13] things too so that I can be more
[26:15] equipped as a pastor and a counselor to
[26:18] have more equipped with more discernment
[26:20] to be able to help others because I want
[26:22] to be more effective in helping other
[26:25] people. And so it is it has been and so
[26:27] here's what it was been on my heart and
[26:29] that is this comes from a sermon brother
[26:31] Brand preached. He cares. Do you care?
[26:35] He cares. Do you care? And so, um, I
[26:38] want to just take my time and go slow.
[26:41] It doesn't mean tonight I'll take my
[26:43] time, but I don't know how many more
[26:44] series I'll get into in this, but I just
[26:47] want to just break ground on it tonight
[26:49] a little bit. See, see, maybe if you can
[26:51] join me, and you're welcome, of course,
[26:53] to listen to that sermon and uh, just
[26:55] take it in while we study a little bit.
[26:57] But there's something in here. And when
[26:59] you have a title in a sermon that's
[27:01] called He Cares, Do You Care? I would
[27:03] say that that uh at face value, this
[27:06] seems like a general sermon concerning
[27:09] the heart of God that cares. And it is.
[27:11] And and uh even the title, even the
[27:14] title would draw us all in to maybe want
[27:16] to listen to it or to do that because
[27:18] we're interested in a God who cares. How
[27:21] many is interested in a God who cares?
[27:23] Most of us have been Christians for a
[27:25] long time. So we already basically know
[27:27] that maybe even a surface level, we know
[27:30] God cares. We know there he's a God who
[27:32] cares. But uh and and and that's a
[27:34] wonderful thing. It's and it's it's so
[27:36] you know uh he cares. Do you care? It's
[27:39] it's something that reminds us that God
[27:41] I like to be reminded that God cares.
[27:44] And at a certain level just knowing that
[27:46] he cares can bring comfort to us when we
[27:49] go through a pain and we go through
[27:50] different things in life. Just knowing
[27:52] that he cares. But I just want to say
[27:55] tonight, it does not say in this title
[27:57] that just that he cares, but it says he
[28:00] cares. Do you care? And so there's a
[28:03] little bit more to it than just standing
[28:05] back and saying he cares. And I know God
[28:09] cares, but there's another element to it
[28:11] and actually brings us into it. He
[28:14] cares, but do you care? And it I can't
[28:17] help but just think that there's a
[28:19] certain uh uh supernatural thing that
[28:22] begins to work here when you have both
[28:24] sides working. When you have God who
[28:26] cares and is ready and willing to take
[28:29] every situation that he already knows
[28:31] about every pain, every situation, every
[28:34] loss, every sin, everything, every
[28:36] mistake that you made, he's aware of all
[28:38] of it. And he cares for all those
[28:40] things. He cares for for what it is that
[28:43] you're going through tonight. He cares
[28:45] for what you've been through when you
[28:46] were a little child. He has a care. He
[28:48] has an understanding of that. He knows
[28:50] it. And he cares for your heart in that.
[28:53] So there's no question of that. But this
[28:55] title takes it deeper because there's
[28:57] another side to it. He cares. Do you
[28:59] care? It it makes me think that you
[29:01] could have a caring God who cares, but
[29:04] if you have someone who didn't show the
[29:07] fruits that they cared, then it's not
[29:09] going to work.
[29:11] So the complete there's a complete
[29:13] picture and when we say that he just he
[29:16] cares it's not complete without our side
[29:19] being engaged. There's another element
[29:21] to our side that comes in and with our
[29:24] our without our side being engaged then
[29:26] it's not a complete picture. Is is he
[29:29] still a caring god when men don't care?
[29:33] Is he still a caring god when men don't
[29:35] care? The answer is yes. It doesn't
[29:38] change his caring. He's still a caring
[29:40] God even when men turn their back on
[29:43] him. Even when men backslide, even men w
[29:46] That didn't take away from the caring
[29:48] God. He's still a caring God. Even when
[29:50] men don't care. Yes. But see,
[29:53] limitations are put on the results when
[29:56] the other side is saying the with words
[29:59] or with actions, I don't care. And I
[30:01] want to emphasize that because people
[30:03] can say with their words that they care
[30:07] about God, about him helping them, but
[30:10] their actions may speak something
[30:12] different.
[30:14] So I want to emphasize that if we're
[30:16] saying with if we're saying with our
[30:18] mouth that we believe God cares and I
[30:21] care that he cares, but we have to show
[30:23] it with our actions. If your actions say
[30:25] I don't care because people can say with
[30:27] their actions, I don't really care. Uh
[30:30] words can say a lot. Uh but Jesus said
[30:33] there are people who honor me with their
[30:36] lips but their heart is far from
[30:39] me. How many remember Jesus saying that?
[30:42] So I don't want to be that way. And
[30:45] there's a quote I want to bring in this
[30:46] series that he said we must get our
[30:57] subconscious is all saying it. But
[30:59] because maybe your past there's a bunch
[31:01] of hesitation in your subconscious and
[31:03] it's not really believing. There's a
[31:04] little bit of unbelief. There's lies
[31:06] there. There's scares there. You're
[31:08] afraid to believe because you don't
[31:09] trust completely. So if you've got a
[31:12] subconscience that's not on board, but
[31:14] you got a conscience saying yes, yes,
[31:16] yes. Brother Bam says if we can get
[31:18] believers with their subconscience and
[31:20] conscience lined up with really
[31:22] believing, something's going to happen.
[31:24] That's right. So, this is something
[31:26] brother Steve Brassan and other brothers
[31:28] have have blessed us with to show us
[31:30] because there is hundreds of examples in
[31:32] our message that show how brother Bram's
[31:34] talking about this how the subconscious
[31:36] and the heart there's something detached
[31:38] there and it's causing the person not to
[31:41] get the full benefit of believing
[31:43] everything they should believe for. And
[31:45] so we have to be a deep people to
[31:47] say,"Lord, if there be any unbelief in
[31:49] me." Wasn't there a man in the Bible who
[31:51] says, "God, I believe, but help thou my
[31:53] unbelief."
[31:55] You could say, "Well, I thought you
[31:57] believed." What about what are you
[31:58] saying about unbelief? He's saying that
[32:00] if there's any unbelief in me, Lord,
[32:02] help that. Care for that. Because I can
[32:06] confess what Lord, I'm saying. I
[32:08] believe, but help my unbelief. Help the
[32:11] areas that are weak. Help anything that
[32:13] the devil is using there to hold me
[32:15] back. My past, my upbringing, my
[32:18] legalistic background, oh God, help me
[32:21] not to let that hold me back from you.
[32:23] The devil can use a lot of stuff to hold
[32:26] people back in their hearts. And yet,
[32:28] they're on board at church. They know
[32:30] this is right. I believe the message.
[32:31] I've been raised this way. But listen,
[32:33] we got to go deeper than that. Amen. So
[32:37] you can never get to the full completion
[32:39] of a God who cares if you got your li as
[32:43] Jesus said your lips honor me your heart
[32:44] is far from me that ain't going to work
[32:46] we want the full completion so there are
[32:48] both sides uh these what happens is both
[32:52] sides are caring for the situation and I
[32:54] say situation there's a need there's a
[32:57] there's a healing that's needed there's
[32:59] a there's something there's a financial
[33:01] need that's needed and so automatically
[33:04] we know God cares right God cares about
[33:06] the need. But you see now when it works
[33:09] where there's a supernatural connection
[33:12] with both sides caring for the situation
[33:15] and when that is there both sides are
[33:17] coming the potential is there for a
[33:20] supernatural God to step in and not only
[33:23] say that he cares but actually step into
[33:26] the situation and do something about it.
[33:29] That's what we want to see. That's what
[33:31] we're hungry for. We're hungry for
[33:33] apostolic times to move us again. move
[33:36] among us again. What is that? That's a
[33:37] supernatural God that's actually been
[33:39] released among us. There's nothing
[33:41] holding him up from doing this
[33:42] supernatural work. We need it. Can you
[33:45] say amen? And it's not like I'm going to
[33:47] work it up by the music or work it out
[33:49] by something. No, no, no. We need our
[33:50] faith anchored. We need our hearts
[33:52] anchored. We need to be stable. Can you
[33:54] say amen? In an age of emotional
[33:57] instability, we need to know our place
[33:59] in the word and stand there and say, "I
[34:01] believe this with all my heart. I
[34:03] believe God's going to do this." I'll
[34:04] just go ahead and say it. We got a
[34:05] testimony in today and the sister didn't
[34:07] say we can mention it. But listen, a
[34:09] couple weeks ago, somebody there's a few
[34:11] families that latched on to this whole
[34:13] thing of had it right and saying, "I'm
[34:14] going to ask for eternal things. I'm
[34:16] asking for my family." I believe a lot
[34:18] of you done that. You should stick by it
[34:20] because when you start asking for
[34:22] eternal things instead of just carnal
[34:24] things, it's from the heart. I believe
[34:26] God's going to step in for your family.
[34:28] and she got a phone call just this week
[34:30] from one of the family members she was
[34:32] praying for and said, "I want to come
[34:34] and I want to visit church." I say,
[34:35] "Praise be to God." See, this isn't just
[34:38] sermons. It's the faith of the people
[34:40] that latches on to it. It's got to be an
[34:43] action more than just words. Praise the
[34:45] Lord. And so when there's a there's a
[34:47] there's a connection of these two parts
[34:49] that really care, then something
[34:52] supernatural can come in, a point a a a
[34:56] meeting point where where a caring God
[34:59] can meet with a heart that cares for
[35:02] help, a heart that that then and when
[35:05] that happens, there's a heart that
[35:07] really cares for help. I'm willing to do
[35:09] what I need to do because I need help.
[35:11] And then you got a caring God when then
[35:12] that meets and we see it all this
[35:15] situation the need is affected by a
[35:18] supernatural God. My opinion and this
[35:21] just my opinion uh on this sermon this
[35:24] sermon he cares do you care is not just
[35:27] a sermon and I'll just say that none of
[35:29] the messages in this message are just
[35:32] sermons.
[35:34] If you ever look at it that way my
[35:35] goodness you're missing it. They're not
[35:37] just sermons. They're announcements.
[35:39] That's right. They're not just sermons.
[35:40] They're teaching they're teachings
[35:43] adopted sons. Can you say amen? And and
[35:46] so it's not just a sermon. And this
[35:49] particular sermon is one of those I call
[35:51] that's not a doctrinal sermon. He cares.
[35:53] Do you care? Not is not necessarily a
[35:55] doctrinal sermon. Uh under the ministry
[35:58] that we've been given uh coming through
[36:00] Malachi 45 and 6 and Revelations 10:7.
[36:03] under that ministry there's been many in
[36:06] fact all the mysteries revealed or
[36:08] restored back to us. How many believe
[36:10] that the mysteries have been revealed uh
[36:13] the the the doctrinal loose ends were
[36:16] tied together by the Bible and by the
[36:19] seventh messenger to tie the loose ends
[36:21] together. So you take doctrinal things
[36:23] and you take what happened in the garden
[36:24] and the trinity and all these other
[36:26] things that that there was so many loose
[36:28] ends to all this and the last messenger
[36:30] is to take the take the Bible and
[36:32] through the inspiration of God to
[36:34] restore us back. So a bunch of the
[36:37] doctrinal loose ends are tied to there.
[36:40] If not I could safely say all of them
[36:42] are tied together and the mystery of God
[36:44] is finished. The doctrinal loose ends
[36:47] are tied together by the prophet of the
[36:49] last days. Uh taking us back to Bible
[36:52] truths. The whole of Bible truth has
[36:55] been restored through the message. But
[36:57] the message is not all doctrinal.
[37:01] It's not all just doctrinal sermons.
[37:06] And those who don't listen the message,
[37:07] you're not going to know that. But those
[37:08] who do, you realize it's not every
[37:10] sermon that's just a very mysterious
[37:12] revealing of a deep doctrinal thing in
[37:14] the Bible. Not all of them are that way.
[37:17] And this he cares, do you care? I would
[37:19] not label a doctrinal sermon. Not all
[37:21] sermons are doctrinal. Some are
[37:25] instructional. Some are faithbuilding.
[37:29] Can you say amen?
[37:31] Some explore the mercies and the grace
[37:35] of God. The one God rich in mercy. How
[37:40] many enjoy that one? God rich and mercy.
[37:42] Some explore the grace and the mercies
[37:44] of God. But some are related to teaching
[37:47] sons in the time of adoption because
[37:50] this is the time of adoption. Uh I I
[37:53] believe the message paradox is an
[37:55] adoption uh son's adoption sermon. Uh
[37:58] these these things why cry and speak?
[38:00] Why cry speak? That's an adoption
[38:02] teaching. You're teaching sons. You're
[38:04] teaching them how to step forward in the
[38:07] word, in the spoken word. So, they're
[38:09] not necessarily extremely doctrinal.
[38:10] They're instructional to sons to come to
[38:13] adoption because this is the age of
[38:15] adoption. So, the world can look at
[38:17] these, oh, that's a nice general sermon.
[38:20] And somebody who's not called to become
[38:22] adopted son, they're not called to it.
[38:24] They'll gravitate to the faith sermons.
[38:28] Can Can I be honest tonight?
[38:31] They'll gravitate to just the early
[38:33] faith sermons or the ones in the later
[38:35] that are just faith sermons. If that's
[38:36] all you want to hear, then you'll just
[38:38] isolate and you start picking out the
[38:40] you should if you need faith, listen to
[38:42] those things. Praise the Lord. But it's
[38:44] not the whole message. It's not just the
[38:47] faith sermon that wow, I've heard
[38:49] testimony after testimony. He preached
[38:50] on David and Goliath. Bang, bang, bang.
[38:53] We got a lot of great faith preachers in
[38:55] the message. Sometimes I have them in to
[38:57] build the faith of the people through
[38:59] testimonies. God can heal God and and so
[39:02] they build the faith of the people to a
[39:04] certain thing to believe for a certain
[39:05] thing. But you see now not all the
[39:07] sermons are faith and people will
[39:09] gravitate just to a certain thing that
[39:11] they want to hear. Some people gravitate
[39:13] just to the real deep teachings so that
[39:16] it makes them more uh uh know more than
[39:19] the next guy. That's not the that's not
[39:22] a good purpose. God didn't give us this
[39:24] message so we can know more than the
[39:26] next guy. God didn't give us this
[39:28] message so that we could be proud and
[39:30] say we know more than the
[39:35] denominations. Well, that sounds like a
[39:37] real adult adopted song singing that.
[39:40] No, he didn't give us even the deep
[39:43] truths so that we could say I know more
[39:45] than the next guy. These deep truths
[39:47] ought to take us to a deeper life in
[39:48] God.
[39:51] So, but people will gravitate to certain
[39:53] things. Mile, the Lord just dropped it
[39:56] in my heart. There's some people that
[39:58] gravitate to just the outside standards
[40:01] of dress
[40:03] and holiness. And that's all the sermons
[40:06] you hear and that's all the quotes you
[40:08] hear. Why? Because they may have come
[40:10] from a certain holiness background. And
[40:12] when they started to feed on the
[40:14] message, they said, "Oh yeah, Brother
[40:15] Brandham identified what they taught me
[40:17] in the holiness church." And so now they
[40:19] connect with only a part of the message
[40:21] and that's all they preach. If we can
[40:23] just get everybody lined up in their
[40:25] dress, then we'll have a perfect bride.
[40:27] I'm sorry that's not the way God says
[40:29] it. I should get some bigger amens in
[40:32] that. Praise the Lord. I had a brother
[40:35] tell me Sunday and I I I I respect him
[40:37] for saying he says, "You kept saying say
[40:38] amen." He said, "But I'm try I'm trying
[40:41] to ponder some of the stuff. Give me
[40:42] time before I say
[40:44] amen." I said, "That's us preachers. We
[40:46] want some response. that helps us. It
[40:48] says sickum to the devil.
[40:51] Can you say
[40:52] amen? Praise the Lord. So, so you see
[40:55] now we we can't and and and let me just
[40:57] make a comment on that. We can't just
[40:59] isolate. And people a lot of times from
[41:02] their background, what they came from,
[41:05] will gravitate to a certain part of the
[41:07] message and they'll grab all the quotes
[41:10] and they'll miss all the other quotes.
[41:12] If they come from a real uh Baptist
[41:15] theological background, if they're not
[41:17] careful and take the whole word, they'll
[41:18] gravitate towards that and the whole
[41:20] message becomes just intellectual.
[41:23] If they come from a Pentecostal
[41:25] background and they're used to that and
[41:27] they've seen the power, they seen the
[41:28] work of God back there, say, "Well, I'd
[41:30] like to see that again." So, they'll
[41:32] they'll preach that. A lot of times what
[41:33] you preach, you you'll get some of those
[41:35] results, but I'm not interested in just
[41:37] a portion of this, but I want to look at
[41:39] look at the whole thing. I'm doing a
[41:40] little training tonight to teach you.
[41:42] And let me say this. Let me say if any
[41:44] influence in your life has caused you to
[41:46] be discouraged to listen to this
[41:48] message, that's your enemy.
[41:52] Because you know what it's causing you
[41:54] to do? You back off from listening to
[41:55] it. You say, "I got a little question
[41:57] about it." Now, don't let the devil put
[41:59] seeds of doubt because you are missing
[42:00] one of the greatest things God sent to
[42:02] us. And if you'll look at the whole
[42:04] picture, you'll see it the way I see it
[42:06] tonight. No, God has breathed on this
[42:09] generation. It's not about brother
[42:11] Brandham. It's about what God breathed
[42:12] through the voice of the prophet. And
[42:14] I'm tell you friends, there's more in
[42:16] here than what we realize. There's more
[42:18] in here that meets the eye. And it's not
[42:21] just a dress code. It's not a dress code
[42:24] to be crammed down the people's throats
[42:26] and our young people's throats. Is the
[42:27] dress code a part of it? Is it part of
[42:29] it? Yes. But holiness isn't even what
[42:31] you wear on the outside. It's the
[42:33] holiness of God first. Can I get it?
[42:37] It's holiness on the inside. It's a holy
[42:39] God.
[42:41] Praise the Lord. It's just you and me
[42:43] tonight. So, I'm being honest with you
[42:45] and preaching what I feel is on my heart
[42:48] and all the other hundreds that are
[42:50] listening
[42:51] maybe. But I have to be honest and say
[42:53] we do that sometimes. We just gravitate
[42:55] towards certain things. Don't let the
[42:57] enemy put seeds of doubt in your mind
[43:00] that you back off from listening to it.
[43:02] That's that's deceiving you because it's
[43:04] taking you away from the one of the
[43:06] greatest things. Even if young people
[43:07] get a hold of this and put this on their
[43:10] phone instead of Snapchat,
[43:15] then you'll start having more of a
[43:17] Snapchat with the Lord. You have a
[43:19] relationship with him. It'll take you
[43:21] back to the Bible where you know where
[43:23] you stand as a young person. So don't
[43:25] be, oh, it's just that. And I remember
[43:27] my wife saying for years in the church
[43:29] that she was in, grew up in, it was all
[43:31] just very doctrinal and the quotes and
[43:34] things. And so when she come and the
[43:35] Lord touched her heart and filled her
[43:37] with the Holy Ghost, she was a little
[43:38] scared to read the seal book. But she
[43:40] said cuz she thought, "Oh, that's just
[43:42] that's way out of our reach. This is
[43:44] just" and somebody had planted that in
[43:46] in her mind, but she said, "I'm going to
[43:48] go ahead and read it." And when she read
[43:49] it, it wasn't that way at all. It was
[43:52] simplicity. And it didn't just show the
[43:54] mysteries. She said she's seen her
[43:56] position in the word by reading the
[43:58] seals. Don't ever let the enemy, I don't
[44:01] care who it is in a family member or
[44:03] some website. Put seeds of doubt in your
[44:06] mind to this message. This is what God
[44:08] has sent us in this age. And it's
[44:10] blessed. And if you'll feed on it, it'll
[44:12] take you back to your place in the word
[44:14] of God. Can you say, "Praise the Lord."
[44:17] Hallelujah. And so now,
[44:19] uh, you know, uh, not all things are
[44:22] doctrinal, but you see, there's things
[44:24] that are teaching. So, some some
[44:27] sermons, I'll say it this way, are the
[44:30] keys. And, by the way, I'm still laying
[44:31] a foundation, and I'm going to close
[44:32] here in a minute. I'm still laying a
[44:34] foundation. Some of the of the sermons
[44:37] are keys to unlock things only for sons
[44:42] and daughters of God that are coming to
[44:44] adoption. Amen.
[44:46] Some sermons which I believe this he
[44:50] cares do you care is a key and you
[44:54] remember God is wanting to hand the keys
[44:58] of the kingdom to his people.
[45:02] Because not everybody has the keys. Not
[45:04] everybody has the keys to this church.
[45:06] Not everybody has the keys to my office.
[45:09] Not every you see so it's just a select
[45:11] few. And Jesus, you say, "Well, my
[45:13] goodness. Whosoever will will come."
[45:15] Yeah, that's right. He welcomes
[45:17] everyone, but not
[45:18] everybody will receive it. And so he
[45:21] says, "It's given unto you to know
[45:23] though the mysteries." Then when he
[45:25] comes to the kingdom covenant, the
[45:26] kingdom comes by the filling of the Holy
[45:28] Ghost. What's the first thing he do? He
[45:30] said, "Peter, I've given you the keys to
[45:33] the kingdom." So, it's not just that you
[45:36] have the kingdom in you by the Holy
[45:37] Ghost, but God wants you to give to give
[45:40] you the keys. And when you have the
[45:42] keys, it unlocks
[45:46] more of the kingdom to you.
[45:48] See, you I got a key now. I'll stick it
[45:51] in there. I could have called this the
[45:52] principle. He cares you. I don't want
[45:54] to. The principle is used too much. The
[45:56] principle, it's gets too But when you
[45:58] talk about the key, that's to the
[45:59] children of God. He gives us the keys
[46:01] and you get a little key. It unlock
[46:03] unlocks faith to you. It unlocks more to
[46:05] you, more of where your position is in
[46:07] Christ. And I feel that some sermons are
[46:10] the keys to unlock. And and so this
[46:13] service definitely is because it's the
[46:16] keys to the kingdoms in the hands of the
[46:18] people. This sermon, I believe this
[46:19] service uh of he cares, you hear is not
[46:22] only encouraging, but a key to something
[46:24] for here that we want to look at. He
[46:27] cares. Do you care? So, let's go back to
[46:31] our scriptural base. All right. It's uh
[46:34] I just want to comment on that, not pass
[46:36] it too quickly. 1 Peter chapter 5. And
[46:38] as I said, I'm taking this real
[46:41] slow. Chapter
[46:43] 5. 1 Peter chapter 5. And we read verse
[46:46] 5. Likewise, ye younger, submit
[46:50] yourselves unto the elder.
[46:53] All of you be subject one to another and
[46:57] be clothed with humility. This is one of
[47:00] these scriptures here that rarely gets
[47:03] preached on. And I'm going to say too, I
[47:06] don't see a lot of this in the true body
[47:08] of Christ. Still, what don't you see,
[47:12] brother
[47:13] Paul? All of you submit yourself one to
[47:17] another.
[47:19] There's some other scriptures I don't
[47:20] hear preach very much and don't see.
[47:22] want me to mention them? Nobody's Oh,
[47:25] thank you. Appreciate it. Confess your
[47:28] faults one to another in the fear of
[47:30] God. It'll affect your faith when you're
[47:32] praying for the sick. Confess your
[47:33] faults for another to one another. And
[47:36] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[47:38] righteous man availth much. So, it's not
[47:40] just your effectual fervent. What makes
[47:42] it more
[47:43] effectual? Confessing our faults. And I
[47:46] rarely see it in the body of Christ. I
[47:49] rarely see that kind of honesty.
[47:51] One brother said there's just not trust.
[47:53] You know, somebody might go tell
[47:54] somebody or whatever. So, so it it it
[47:57] just doesn't happen. There's some other
[47:58] ones. There's some other scriptures that
[48:00] we don't
[48:01] uh you know, see sometimes. Uh I think
[48:04] there's one back there in Peter or John
[48:06] that says, "If there any come among you
[48:10] and bring not this doctrine, receive him
[48:12] not into your house, neither bid him
[48:14] God's speed. For he that bidth him God's
[48:17] speed is a partaker of his evil deeds."
[48:19] If somebody's bringing apostasy that's
[48:21] contrary to what the doctrine that's
[48:23] been brought, don't even receive them in
[48:25] your home and don't wish them God's
[48:27] speed. Don't say, "God bless you." And
[48:29] it's all quiet.
[48:32] These are in your Bible, too.
[48:35] But you don't hear that type of thing
[48:36] preached. And yet, we must be missing a
[48:39] benefit because we need those
[48:40] protections in place. Sometimes there's
[48:42] a there's one place that says to
[48:45] withdraw yourself from a brother who
[48:47] walks disorderly. goes on to say later,
[48:50] don't treat him like an enemy, but
[48:52] admonish him as a brother. But it
[48:54] actually says to withdraw yourself from
[48:55] a brother who's acting that way for a
[48:57] time. We don't want to hear these
[48:59] things, but you see that they are things
[49:01] that are part of the body of Christ. And
[49:03] this is a scripture I think that we
[49:05] submitting ourselves one to another. I'm
[49:06] going to read it in the amplified verse
[49:08] 5. Likewise, you younger men of lesser
[49:10] rank and experience, be subject to your
[49:12] elders. Seek their counsel. Another
[49:15] thing I don't see very much is the
[49:18] younger seeking the counsel of the
[49:21] elder. But the Bible says to do it. Be
[49:24] subject to your elders. Seek the
[49:25] counsel. And all of you clothe yourself
[49:28] with humility towards one another. Tie
[49:31] on the servants's apron.
[49:37] That's what the Bible says. This is
[49:39] submitting ourselves one to another. It
[49:40] says, "Tie yourself onto your servant's
[49:43] apron." In other words, you find the
[49:44] right thing, you trust, cling on to
[49:46] that. A lot of people in the body of
[49:48] Christ and in this message miss
[49:51] opportunities for the nine spiritual
[49:53] gifts, word of wisdom, these different
[49:55] things that they miss it because they
[49:57] will not uh submit themselves to it,
[50:00] give themselves fellowship to it. So God
[50:03] could speak something through somebody.
[50:05] Oh, I just caught a key there from a
[50:07] member of the body of Christ. I've
[50:09] caught something. They spoke it,
[50:10] brother. You didn't know it, but God
[50:11] spoke through that. Help me cuz I now I
[50:13] know what to go do. We're missing a lot
[50:16] of what God has supplied in the body of
[50:19] Christ because we live too much to an
[50:21] island to ourselves. And there's a lot
[50:24] of lack of trust out there. And that's
[50:26] why people don't trust anymore. But we
[50:28] cannot start having a lack of trust in
[50:31] what God provides for us.
[50:34] That's Satan's work is to cause us to
[50:36] lack of trust in something that we
[50:37] really need. We can't be an island in
[50:40] the body of Christ. And I'm not forcing
[50:42] you to be friends, but I I'm saying
[50:44] don't miss out on the opportunity of not
[50:46] just the preaching, but what the body
[50:48] provides. Cuz where's Christ today? He's
[50:51] not in the message books. He's not in
[50:52] our Bibles. He's in his people. Christ
[50:56] is in his people. Say, "But they look
[50:58] too flawed and there's too many
[50:59] mistakes." And I've got too many
[51:01] mistakes. No, I'm not talking about your
[51:02] mistakes. I'm not talking I'm talking
[51:04] about where Christ is. He's in his
[51:07] people.
[51:08] Don't underestimate when he says,
[51:10] "Submit yourself one to another. Tie
[51:12] onto the servants's apron. For God is
[51:14] opposed to the proud, the disdainful,
[51:17] the presumptuous, and he defeats them,
[51:19] but he gives grace unto the humble." And
[51:22] then the next structure he says verse
[51:23] six, "Humble yourselves therefore under
[51:25] the mighty hand of God that he may exalt
[51:28] you in due time." So when we realize
[51:32] what the Lord is saying, I want to get
[51:33] back to this now. Humility will Humility
[51:37] will put you forward to God. Pride will
[51:40] put you backwards away from God.
[51:42] Humility says that I really care to get
[51:46] help.
[51:49] Cuz I'm coming broken. I'm coming
[51:51] humbly. Uh even when it comes down to
[51:53] just people admitting that they made
[51:55] mistakes, they can't do it. Can't do it
[51:58] to one another. Sometimes they can't do
[52:00] it to God. I feel so defeated. I can't
[52:02] even go to God with this. But God wants
[52:04] you to come to him. He's welcomed you to
[52:06] come in humility. Well, he don't want to
[52:08] hear what I've got to hear. Listen, he's
[52:09] heard it all. And he actually knows what
[52:11] you did before you even come to him. So,
[52:14] he wants you to humbly come back to him
[52:16] and say, "I need help. I don't want to
[52:18] go to some other source for help. I want
[52:19] to come to you, Lord. I've done this.
[52:21] I've done that." Or maybe it's not
[52:22] something you've done. Maybe I'm in dire
[52:24] need. I'm fighting for my life here and
[52:26] I'm coming humbly before you. I have no
[52:28] other source. Sister Lori, she has no
[52:31] other source. The doctors have done what
[52:33] they can do. And now we're just praying.
[52:35] And I know if she could pray, I know
[52:36] she's praying in her heart. She can't
[52:38] speak right now. But if she could, I
[52:40] know Lori well enough to know she's
[52:41] going to go to the throne of God. She's
[52:43] going to go humbly and say, "God, I need
[52:45] you right now. I need healing in my
[52:48] heart right now. But we've got to come
[52:52] humbly." And this is probably a
[52:53] foundational thing is this grace. He
[52:56] says humility will put you forward to
[52:59] God for grace to come to you. All of us
[53:02] want grace to come to us. We want Mr.
[53:04] grace. We need grace. We need his help.
[53:06] Humble yourselves and that brings you
[53:09] towards him to lift you up. And we say
[53:11] he'll exalt you in due time. Well, it
[53:14] doesn't mean necessarily a position, but
[53:16] he'll lift you up. How many want God to
[53:18] lift you up? When you're down in the
[53:20] mud, you want God to lift you up. God, I
[53:23] need help. You know, you you guys all
[53:25] know the the story of the man who was
[53:27] drowning and and he says, "God, help me.
[53:29] God, help me." And this guy comes by
[53:31] with a helicopter and then another guy
[53:33] comes by with a boat and he keeps
[53:35] turning them down because he says, "I
[53:36] asked God to help me." And they drown
[53:39] because three times God sends a
[53:40] helicopter, God sends the boat, God
[53:43] sends another person to help him, and he
[53:44] turns I asked God to help me. Listen,
[53:47] humble yourself to the way God is going
[53:49] to help you. Can I get an amen? Humility
[53:52] says that I don't, as Brandon read the
[53:54] quote tonight, we don't make an idol out
[53:56] of God and we don't say, "God, I want
[53:58] you to answer and I want you to answer
[53:59] this way." We don't do that. We humbly
[54:01] say, "I need help you can help me,
[54:04] Lord."
[54:06] It's the right entrance. It's the right
[54:07] way to approach God. That's gets rid of
[54:10] pride because pride he won't respond to.
[54:12] But humility puts you in a position
[54:15] he'll lift you up and he'll come toward
[54:17] you. And then at the end of it, he says,
[54:20] and I just want to get that just before
[54:21] we get to the end, may exalt you in due
[54:24] time. There's a process.
[54:28] So now we're coming to to him showing we
[54:32] care, showing, Lord, teach me. Lord,
[54:36] purge me. Lord, I've got a lot of
[54:39] baggage from my past. Lord, I need you
[54:42] to purge me. I need you to clean me. I
[54:43] got I need you to heal me. My heart is
[54:46] so damaged by my past. I need you to
[54:50] heal me. And when you come humbly, he'll
[54:53] do it. But he'll do it in his time.
[54:57] Amen. In due time. None of these time
[55:00] restrictions on God.
[55:03] You people like me have impatient
[55:08] problems. It took you, Henry and I were
[55:11] talking today. You know, it took you 20
[55:13] years to gain all that weight and you
[55:15] want to lose it all within three weeks.
[55:18] No, it took you a long time to gain it,
[55:21] but we're not willing because it, you
[55:23] know, it's a it's it's an impatience
[55:25] problem. We want it now, but in due
[55:28] time, God will step in due time. So,
[55:32] we're willing to say, "God, I care. I
[55:34] really care and I'm I I need you. I need
[55:37] you to answer in this situation." And so
[55:40] whatever it is, you humbling yourselves
[55:42] to come honestly and laying it all out
[55:45] on him. Look what he says here. Casting
[55:48] all your care upon him. What does that
[55:50] mean? It means we're coming now and
[55:52] we're laying everything on him. Whatever
[55:54] it is, you're humbling yourself. You're
[55:56] coming honestly. You're laying it all
[55:58] out. It's Lord, this is here. It is. I'm
[56:00] not hiding anything. There is no other
[56:02] source that I'm going to. He is mighty.
[56:05] I go to no other to him. I care so much
[56:08] that I submit to his full counsel
[56:11] completely and I cast my worries and I
[56:14] cast my cares upon you. And it's not
[56:17] just casting and leaving him there. I
[56:19] think there's casting and saying, "Lord,
[56:20] I'm sitting here listening. Help me to
[56:22] get out. Help me bring an answer."
[56:26] Hallelujah. Well, I'm enjoying this. I
[56:29] enjoy what the what it's saying here. So
[56:32] on the one side, we have a
[56:34] God who really, really cares for our
[56:38] cares and our worries.
[56:40] He really does care. And then you listen
[56:42] to the sermon and he starts going
[56:43] through the scripture. God showed he
[56:45] cared with Moses. God shared, he showed
[56:48] he cared. He stepped in. He cared. And
[56:50] so he's got a history. There's no
[56:52] question in our minds tonight. He cared
[56:55] for
[56:57] you. He cares. So on the one side
[57:01] though, you have a God who really really
[57:03] cares for our worries and cares for our
[57:06] cares. Uh let's look at what that means
[57:09] just a minute. Let's just take this side
[57:11] and and I'm going to break this down
[57:13] more, but it's just kind of a summary
[57:14] tonight or a foundation that I'm laying.
[57:16] You got the side of God cares. He cares.
[57:20] Look at what that means. It it does not
[57:23] mean that God endorses sin.
[57:27] And these are very basic thing. You
[57:29] probably already know this, but just in
[57:31] case you don't, uh, I want to let you
[57:33] know this is the way the world starts
[57:35] interpreting a God who cares.
[57:40] It does not mean that God cares and is
[57:44] caring is endorsing
[57:46] sin. It does not mean that he helps hide
[57:50] things that you're hiding.
[57:53] He doesn't care. say, "Well, God cares
[57:55] and he helps you hide things that you're
[57:57] hiding." That's not a God who cares. You
[58:00] understand? And so, it does not mean
[58:02] that he helps hide things with you. It
[58:04] does not mean that he coddles your
[58:07] feelings or your lack of faith. God
[58:10] cares, but it he doesn't show he cares
[58:13] by just coddling your feelings or
[58:15] coddling your gossip or joining in with
[58:17] your gossip or coddling your lack of
[58:19] faith. He doesn't coddle demon spirits.
[58:22] He doesn't coddle just your feelings
[58:24] because this is the way I'm feeling. It
[58:26] must be the truth. So God, do you care
[58:28] about my feelings? Well, God cares that
[58:30] you have about your feelings, but he
[58:31] doesn't care to coddle your feelings.
[58:34] I think of Gideon. God God doesn't care
[58:36] to come along and just keep uh endorsing
[58:39] your complexes that you have.
[58:42] I think of Gideon. If you read the
[58:43] scripture, not this Gideon, but the one
[58:45] in the Bible, Gideon, Gideon comes and
[58:47] God looks in the lamb's book of life and
[58:50] says, "Gideon, thou mighty man of
[58:51] valor." And Gideon's hiding, you know,
[58:54] under the wine press. He's scared to
[58:55] death. Scared to death of the
[58:57] Midianites. Oh my goodness. He's scared
[58:59] to death. And the word comes and says,
[59:00] "You're a mighty man of valor. I need
[59:02] you to lead an army." And Gideon says,
[59:04] "You must have the wrong guy. It's the
[59:06] wrong Gideon." There are some other
[59:07] ones. There's one here. There's, you
[59:09] know, there's a few, but it must You
[59:10] must have the wrong one. No, I don't
[59:12] have the wrong one. This is what the
[59:13] book of life says. You're a mighty man
[59:15] of valor.
[59:17] So Gideon says, "Talk to me. Talk to me,
[59:19] but I don't believe I'm the one." So
[59:21] when he talks to him, he starts giving
[59:24] his excuses and his complexes of why he
[59:27] can't do it. Moses did the same thing.
[59:30] And what I find in each of these
[59:32] instances that God does not coddle the
[59:35] complex or do a pity party with them. He
[59:38] doesn't join in with it. Can you say
[59:40] amen? Matter of fact, you keep doing it,
[59:43] God gets angry,
[59:45] gets upset. I'm telling you the word of
[59:47] who you are and you keep leaning towards
[59:49] your complex.
[59:52] God starts to get a little upset while
[59:54] so Gideon, he's saying, you know, I
[59:56] don't come from that great of a family.
[59:58] He goes through his family history. I
[59:59] don't have much money. It's been a while
[1:00:01] since I read it, so I'm just going off
[1:00:03] the top here, but he gives all these
[1:00:04] excuses. God, every time never addresses
[1:00:08] any of his complexes or excuses. He
[1:00:10] keeps pointing them back to the lamb's
[1:00:12] work of life. This is the what what the
[1:00:14] word says you're going to do.
[1:00:17] And that's our Lord. He can only see us
[1:00:20] by our potential of what we'll be.
[1:00:24] Aren't you glad tonight?
[1:00:27] Adopted son of God. That's his that's
[1:00:29] his agenda. That's what he purchased you
[1:00:31] for. That's what he got you back for to
[1:00:33] bring you to adoption. You don't see
[1:00:35] yourself there tonight, but God sees you
[1:00:37] there. And so he doesn't cater. So get
[1:00:40] back to what you're preaching, Paul. It
[1:00:41] does not mean he coddles your feelings
[1:00:43] or your lack of faith or your
[1:00:45] complaining. He's not He doesn't join in
[1:00:47] with your membership at your pity
[1:00:51] party. A lot of people will. They'll
[1:00:53] join in with you. If I can just find
[1:00:54] somebody to gossip with me, if I can
[1:00:56] just find somebody that that will cater
[1:00:59] to my being a hypochondric and always
[1:01:01] having problems and diseases and
[1:01:03] everything. God doesn't do that. He's
[1:01:05] not. He's he he cares, but his caring is
[1:01:08] not to come into your pity party.
[1:01:11] It does not mean if you have made
[1:01:13] concrete conclusions about things, he's
[1:01:16] just going to take your side with those
[1:01:18] conclusions. Can I can I hear an amen?
[1:01:23] That doesn't mean that God cares. He's
[1:01:24] going to agree with all your things. He
[1:01:28] will care with
[1:01:31] understanding, with affection, but he he
[1:01:34] will care with truth.
[1:01:38] Always truth. And you should say, "Thank
[1:01:41] you, Lord, that you'll be truthful.
[1:01:44] He'll speak the truth in love to you.
[1:01:46] Even if it hurts
[1:01:48] because the way he cares, this the way
[1:01:51] we need to care for one another. The way
[1:01:52] God cares is through affection and
[1:01:55] understanding and discernment and truth.
[1:01:58] Amen.
[1:02:00] Further, he shows his care. When he
[1:02:02] shows he cares, and this is the point I
[1:02:05] want to get
[1:02:06] to,
[1:02:08] he will show that he cares, not just by
[1:02:13] standing back and saying the words, I
[1:02:16] care for you as a God. God doesn't come
[1:02:18] all the way back distant from your life
[1:02:21] and just, you know, fold his arms and
[1:02:24] say, "I just want to let you all know I
[1:02:27] care. I really
[1:02:29] care." That may be how some people do
[1:02:32] it, but that's not the way God cares.
[1:02:33] And this is my one of my biggest points
[1:02:35] tonight. God shows he cares when he
[1:02:39] steps in and does something about it.
[1:02:43] He doesn't just say, "I care." But he
[1:02:46] wants to step into your situation and
[1:02:48] show his supernatural way to show that
[1:02:51] he cares. How many can raise your hand
[1:02:52] and testify, "I've seen that God has
[1:02:54] stepped in situations in my life and I
[1:02:56] knew God cared for me. I knew I've
[1:02:58] always believed he cared, but when he
[1:03:00] stepped in, he did something about it."
[1:03:02] So God doesn't just say, "I care. I
[1:03:05] care. Care." And also, there's people in
[1:03:06] the world say, "I'm glad God cares. I'm
[1:03:08] glad God cares." But when God steps in
[1:03:10] and does something and it shows him
[1:03:12] real, you see then then they say, "Well,
[1:03:14] I didn't really want God to do it that
[1:03:15] way. I didn't really want God. I want
[1:03:18] him to care from a
[1:03:20] distance. I want it to be the Bat Midler
[1:03:23] song that God's watching us from a
[1:03:25] distance." You've heard me sing that
[1:03:26] before. I won't sing it tonight unless I
[1:03:28] get a lot of response, but you know, big
[1:03:31] number one song. God is watching us from
[1:03:33] a distance. And that's exactly went to
[1:03:36] number one song because that's where
[1:03:37] they want their God from a distance.
[1:03:40] They don't want God inside of them. They
[1:03:43] want a God that will show up in an
[1:03:44] emergency.
[1:03:46] And when you when when you fix the
[1:03:48] emergency, I need you back out of my
[1:03:50] life. And God doesn't sit back and say,
[1:03:53] "I care. I care." People like a God like
[1:03:56] that. But that's not when he says he
[1:03:58] cares. Do you care? When he says he
[1:04:00] cares, he wants to step in and show his
[1:04:04] power. Can you say amen? He longs to
[1:04:06] step into things and change and bring
[1:04:09] victory to the situation, causing us
[1:04:11] always to triumph. The Bible says, the
[1:04:13] Bible says, "Blessed be our Lord God,
[1:04:15] who causes us always to triumph in Jesus
[1:04:18] Christ." He wants us always to triumph.
[1:04:21] We always win. Can you say amen? I've
[1:04:24] had people that are on their deathbed
[1:04:26] and they're believing for the healing
[1:04:27] and they'll believe to their deathbed,
[1:04:29] but because they they say the words. I
[1:04:30] had a brother say it today. Either way,
[1:04:32] I win.
[1:04:34] What a mature attitude. I believe God
[1:04:37] can supernaturally bring me up from this
[1:04:39] deadbed, that dead bed, death
[1:04:42] bed. But I also believe if he takes me,
[1:04:45] I still win.
[1:04:48] Praise the Lord. So his caring is more.
[1:04:51] And James deals with this in James uh
[1:04:54] book of James with us in our treatment
[1:04:56] of one another. What did the profit my
[1:04:58] brethren though a man say he had faith
[1:05:01] and have not works? Can faith save him?
[1:05:04] If a brother or sister be naked and
[1:05:06] destitute of daily food, and one of you
[1:05:08] say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye
[1:05:12] warned. I hope you find some
[1:05:15] clothes. I hope you find some food in
[1:05:18] the trash can. God, may you provide some
[1:05:20] food in the trash can for them.
[1:05:23] Notwithstanding, you give not those
[1:05:25] things which are needful to the body.
[1:05:27] What does it profit? Even so, faith, if
[1:05:29] it hath not works, is
[1:05:31] dead. Being alone. So, James is applying
[1:05:35] that to us when we we say, "Well, I'll
[1:05:37] pray for you." Sometimes it needs more
[1:05:39] than a prayer. Sometimes we can only
[1:05:40] pray. That's all we can do. But
[1:05:42] sometimes it needs to be more hands-on.
[1:05:44] And we don't want to be like that
[1:05:45] because God's not like that where he
[1:05:47] says, "I really care. I know you're
[1:05:49] naked and don't have food and stuff like
[1:05:51] that. I really care. I hope and I'm
[1:05:53] praying that it works out for you."
[1:05:54] Sometimes food is needed. Sometimes
[1:05:56] clothes are needed. Sometimes meeting
[1:05:58] the need, God's calling you to do it.
[1:06:01] So if that applies to us, then we know
[1:06:03] it applies to God. He does not stand
[1:06:05] back distant and say, "I really care.
[1:06:08] People of God, I really care." He wants
[1:06:11] to act and show himself mighty on your
[1:06:13] behalf doing what you can't do. God
[1:06:17] wants to do what you can't do. God wants
[1:06:20] to do what no man can do.
[1:06:24] We serve a God who wants to step in to
[1:06:26] every situation. Why? Because he cares.
[1:06:30] And his caring doesn't stand and say, "I
[1:06:33] care." He wants to do it with
[1:06:36] actions. He wants to step into it. He
[1:06:39] cares for not only bringing the
[1:06:41] deliverance. He cares for not only
[1:06:44] bringing the deliverance and answer, but
[1:06:46] he cares for what is in your heart that
[1:06:49] holds you back. So, let me stop there.
[1:06:52] God not only cares for bringing the
[1:06:54] deliverance and answer, but he's
[1:06:55] actually caring for what it is that's in
[1:06:57] your heart that's holding you back.
[1:07:02] He cares that deep because there's a
[1:07:05] disconnect. I want to care. I want to
[1:07:08] deliver. But there's a disconnect. So,
[1:07:10] does he care for that? He cares for
[1:07:12] that, too. Us ministers, if you're
[1:07:15] listening as a minister, we can't just
[1:07:17] be behind the whole pulpit preaching,
[1:07:19] but we this caring God that says, "I
[1:07:21] care." We have to be a conduit for that
[1:07:24] caring God. We have to care. Can you say
[1:07:27] amen? And also, not just care that they
[1:07:30] get deliverance maybe in a service. It's
[1:07:34] just like our our sister today who
[1:07:35] testified it was really good. We think
[1:07:37] sometimes when we pray for salvation
[1:07:39] that the person's going to come to the
[1:07:40] altar or he's going to do this in a
[1:07:42] certain way and but it may not be an
[1:07:44] altar. It might be alone in the room and
[1:07:46] God gets a hold of them and they give
[1:07:47] their heart to God. We see we put God in
[1:07:50] a box and they have to be at a certain
[1:07:51] camp meeting but God can work anywhere.
[1:07:53] Can I get an amen? God can work
[1:07:55] anywhere. God can do his work. But you
[1:07:58] see now God does not want to just
[1:08:01] deliver you but he cares for your heart.
[1:08:03] us ministers, we need to care for more
[1:08:06] than just the people listening to us and
[1:08:08] saying amen at church, but we need to
[1:08:11] care where their heart is. Because if
[1:08:12] you've been a pastor for as long as I
[1:08:14] have, you see, sometimes people can come
[1:08:17] from years and their heart issues are
[1:08:20] not being addressed.
[1:08:22] Now, you say, "What do you do about it?"
[1:08:23] Well, sometimes I care and sometimes
[1:08:25] people tell you to mind your own
[1:08:26] business
[1:08:28] because they're not ready to go the
[1:08:30] journey of the heart yet. They think
[1:08:32] they're pious. They got it together. I'm
[1:08:34] in the message. I'm
[1:08:37] fine. And the discernment of the Lord
[1:08:40] says, "You're not fine." I'm not talking
[1:08:42] about everybody. I'm talking anybody
[1:08:44] who's got those unresolved things. And
[1:08:46] you see a pattern and the patterns are
[1:08:47] exactly the same and they're not
[1:08:49] changing. Something's wrong.
[1:08:52] You got unbelief there. You got pride
[1:08:53] there. You got um you got you've been
[1:08:56] abused. Whatever it is, God cares for
[1:08:59] it.
[1:09:00] God cares for it. But you can't, you
[1:09:02] see, there's a if people don't if
[1:09:05] ministers don't catch this, he cares. Do
[1:09:07] you care? When it comes to the part of
[1:09:09] knowing God cares, us ministers know
[1:09:11] that we're a conduit to bring the God
[1:09:13] who cares to the people. But you also
[1:09:15] have to have a care for where that
[1:09:17] person is at. Because you can preach all
[1:09:19] the greatest messages and yet if their
[1:09:22] heart's not right,
[1:09:24] there's a block. There's a hold from
[1:09:26] them connecting to God. just get them in
[1:09:29] and have a big meeting and you know just
[1:09:31] get under the anointing. Sometimes that
[1:09:33] works, sometimes it don't.
[1:09:36] Come on now. You know that's true
[1:09:38] because why? It's not a problem with God
[1:09:40] and it's it's it's not a problem with
[1:09:42] the preaching, but that person doesn't
[1:09:45] realize themsel that there's some lies
[1:09:47] that they've believed about themselves.
[1:09:50] There's something laying in their heart
[1:09:51] that they're still believing as a lie
[1:09:53] and it's not the truth. And someone's
[1:09:55] got to talk to him about that and say,
[1:09:57] "Let's talk about this. Let's get it out
[1:09:59] in the open and let's ex maybe expose
[1:10:02] the enemy." And I've watched it within
[1:10:05] within just minutes. Sometimes the lie
[1:10:07] gets exposed and they say, "Wow, did the
[1:10:11] devil ever have me defeated for years.
[1:10:14] I'm feeling free right now. He told me a
[1:10:17] lie about myself. It's not true. I'm
[1:10:20] feeling free.
[1:10:22] This is what God said about you. This is
[1:10:24] what your daddy said about you. This is
[1:10:26] what God said about you. This is what
[1:10:28] your uncle said about you. This is how
[1:10:31] God cares for your heart. This is how
[1:10:33] you were abused.
[1:10:35] And your identity. I told it to a
[1:10:37] brother a few months ago who had a a
[1:10:39] thing happen when he was 11, 12 years
[1:10:42] old, I think it was. And so what you
[1:10:44] don't realize is the devil has used that
[1:10:46] for the for years because you've bought
[1:10:49] into the identity of that incident that
[1:10:51] happened that that was you and that
[1:10:53] you're you're always going to be under
[1:10:55] that cloud of what happened. And I'm
[1:10:58] here to tell you that's not true. You
[1:11:01] didn't do that and that's not your
[1:11:03] identity. Your identity is a son of God.
[1:11:07] Freedom comes in truth.
[1:11:11] Is this okay tonight?
[1:11:13] He cares, but do you care? He cares. Do
[1:11:17] you
[1:11:18] care? So, he wants to act. I know as
[1:11:22] we're getting close to closing here. He
[1:11:25] cares for not only bringing the
[1:11:26] deliverance and answer, but he cares for
[1:11:28] what is in your heart that's holding you
[1:11:29] back. The prayer lines in brother Bram's
[1:11:33] message prove prove this over and over
[1:11:37] again that sometimes God had to remove
[1:11:41] the hindrances first before they got
[1:11:44] their healing. What is that? That's a
[1:11:47] God who cares.
[1:11:50] Sometimes in the healing lives, the
[1:11:51] hindrance had to be removed first to
[1:11:54] pave the way. God will be honest with
[1:11:57] you. God will speak the truth in love.
[1:12:00] So if that's the God that's the So I'm
[1:12:03] just going to bring this now to a close.
[1:12:05] So I just covered that side. A God who
[1:12:08] cares is not a God who says he cares,
[1:12:10] but he wants to step in and change the
[1:12:13] situation. And he wants to care for the
[1:12:15] thing that's keeping you from a
[1:12:17] connection with him.
[1:12:20] If that's true with God that we say his
[1:12:23] caring is not just saying I
[1:12:27] care but no action you see then it must
[1:12:31] be true on this other side over here
[1:12:33] this is the side I'm choosing the sides
[1:12:35] here this is God that cares this over
[1:12:38] here is that do you care okay now if God
[1:12:43] is one who says I care and it's more
[1:12:45] than words it's actions he wants to step
[1:12:48] in and do something Then when we say we
[1:12:50] care, it can't be just words. That's
[1:12:53] right. That's true. Can't be just words.
[1:12:56] It's got to have some things to it. And
[1:12:58] you'll find as you read in the message,
[1:13:00] he cares. Do you care? There's there's
[1:13:02] little things dropped in there to show
[1:13:05] how we approach God and what we offer to
[1:13:07] God to show that we really care. We're
[1:13:11] serious about deliverance. We're serious
[1:13:13] about being free. It works on both
[1:13:15] sides. And so we have to show we care
[1:13:17] not by just our words uh but we're
[1:13:20] caring in our actions starting with
[1:13:22] humility and honesty and truthfulness.
[1:13:25] If you care you reach out for help
[1:13:28] yourself. You see if you care you reach
[1:13:31] out for help yourself. I just say this
[1:13:33] politely to you is that somebody needs
[1:13:36] to reach out. Somebody to reach out. An
[1:13:37] older minister said one time you must
[1:13:39] have been getting criticism because did
[1:13:41] you did you reach out? Did you do what
[1:13:43] you did you do that? And there are some
[1:13:44] situations, friends, you don't know how
[1:13:47] much to reach out because there are some
[1:13:49] people that don't want you that involved
[1:13:51] in their life. So you you call too much
[1:13:56] and then it's too much. I don't know. I
[1:13:58] I didn't take the mind readading
[1:14:02] course. So this is a tedious job
[1:14:05] sometimes because but then then you want
[1:14:07] somebody to call every day. And so if I
[1:14:10] catch some of that then I'll be more
[1:14:12] mindful of it. I can't live on just
[1:14:14] people's expectations.
[1:14:16] You see, I just have to know in my heart
[1:14:18] I do care. You know, I've said it before
[1:14:21] here that uh I may not if you call me to
[1:14:24] come and you're stuck on the highway
[1:14:27] with a flat tire and you call me to come
[1:14:29] and help. Well, first of all, you're
[1:14:31] calling the wrong
[1:14:33] person. You should call Henry for that.
[1:14:36] And Henry is saying, "Thanks a lot for
[1:14:38] giving. There's other people to call.
[1:14:41] But you know what? if there's nobody
[1:14:42] around you, I I would try to do it. But
[1:14:43] listen, I'd probably be calling Henry,
[1:14:45] too. Say, "Hey, let's go help them, you
[1:14:47] know." But you see now is is is people
[1:14:49] say, "Well, he didn't care. He didn't
[1:14:52] even care." No, it's probably because I
[1:14:54] don't know how to change a tire. But he
[1:14:57] didn't care. He didn't care. But you
[1:14:59] see, now I I've changed a lot of flat
[1:15:02] tires in your life
[1:15:05] over the pullpit.
[1:15:08] I've cried and grieved and been up
[1:15:10] through the night bearing with you the
[1:15:12] burdens with you and what you're going
[1:15:14] through. When I do get to spend time
[1:15:16] with you, which I I hate it. I've said
[1:15:19] lately that uh when the church grew a
[1:15:21] little bit, it's been tough on me
[1:15:22] because I'm a real hands-on. I like
[1:15:24] friendships. I like to be close. I like
[1:15:25] to know what's going on in your life.
[1:15:27] It's been impossible to know that with
[1:15:28] everybody, but I try, but I can't do it
[1:15:31] all. But it's my heart. And you know
[1:15:33] what? When I lay my head on my pillow at
[1:15:35] night, I have to know that I care.
[1:15:39] Ministers have to have this care of God.
[1:15:43] He cares in their heart or you can't be
[1:15:46] a proper minister.
[1:15:48] If you don't have the care of the people
[1:15:50] to study and to pray and get the food
[1:15:52] for them and feed them, that's first.
[1:15:55] You know, I'm I'm sharing my heart with
[1:15:56] you tonight. The first thing that I do
[1:15:58] as a pastor, brother Bram says the the
[1:16:00] shepherd leads the congregation and feed
[1:16:03] by feeding the
[1:16:05] people. If everything else, if I don't
[1:16:08] get to everything else, if I'm feeding
[1:16:09] you, that's what I'm supposed to do. And
[1:16:12] hopefully I'm doing the right thing with
[1:16:13] that. I want to stay faithful that I
[1:16:15] want to stay locked into God for that to
[1:16:17] make sure I feed the people. But then
[1:16:19] after that, there's other things to do
[1:16:21] to show that you care. But you see now
[1:16:24] if if I don't always have the time and
[1:16:26] it's been a little bit difficult on me
[1:16:28] to handle the challenges of so many. I
[1:16:31] thank the Lord for my precious brother
[1:16:33] Brandon, brother Boaz, uh some of the
[1:16:36] staff, some of the ministers,
[1:16:39] uh the deacons. God just at the right
[1:16:42] time sent a lot of extra help to our
[1:16:45] precious congregation when I needed it.
[1:16:49] And I thank God for it. But still my
[1:16:51] heart is, you know, every day to be at
[1:16:54] Tim Hortons having coffee with all of
[1:16:56] you. I would love that. I honestly from
[1:16:59] my heart would love it. But you have to
[1:17:01] know at the end of the day, do you care?
[1:17:04] I'd say a minister who doesn't
[1:17:05] understand this, he probably shouldn't
[1:17:06] get in the ministry. He shouldn't be
[1:17:08] behind the pull pit because you are the
[1:17:10] conduit for a God who cares. Can you say
[1:17:13] amen? It's not just getting up and
[1:17:15] preaching a good sermon. You have no
[1:17:17] idea. Read in second Timothy where Paul
[1:17:20] is or excuse me, 1 Corinthians reading
[1:17:23] this morning and he gives all the perils
[1:17:25] of ministry and he says if you don't
[1:17:27] know that this is part of the ministry
[1:17:30] you know beaten thrice and you know
[1:17:32] shipwrecked and he lists about 15 things
[1:17:35] there it's the perils of ministry it's
[1:17:38] the burdens of ministry and that's what
[1:17:41] ministry is about and so it's not just
[1:17:44] preaching but you if you you have to
[1:17:46] show that you really care and it's not
[1:17:49] just words, but it's actions. Can you
[1:17:51] say amen? A minister is a conduit for
[1:17:54] that. We are all conduits for that. But
[1:17:56] God cares. And sometimes, you know, our
[1:17:59] caring when we care and show we care to
[1:18:02] God. Then we don't just say, "I care."
[1:18:04] But there has to be an action to it
[1:18:06] starting with humility. And I'm going to
[1:18:07] end I'm going to read the first
[1:18:09] paragraph and he cares, you care, and
[1:18:11] then we'll get to the rest of it another
[1:18:13] service. Um we'll continue to study for
[1:18:16] it.
[1:18:20] The first thing he says, there's a
[1:18:22] couple testimonies, but just before he
[1:18:24] says the testimonies, he cares. Do you
[1:18:26] care? He says, first to approach this,
[1:18:28] the audience must be anointed with
[1:18:30] faith. And if you do not have faith,
[1:18:32] there's no need of even coming to be
[1:18:34] prayed for because it's going to take
[1:18:36] your faith and my faith together. My
[1:18:38] faith to believe him, your faith to
[1:18:41] believe him. So, we don't forget this
[1:18:44] now as I go along. We've got to have
[1:18:46] something evidently with evidence. I
[1:18:49] mean, that we can base our faith upon
[1:18:52] that we're trying to do. Because if a
[1:18:54] man approaches anything he wants to do
[1:18:56] without sufficient faith, he's bound to
[1:18:58] be a failure. But if he can approach it
[1:19:01] with sufficient faith, then he's bound
[1:19:03] to succeed if it is according to God's
[1:19:06] will and purpose to do it. He's laying
[1:19:10] in the foundation of faith. There's
[1:19:11] going to be other things that we talk
[1:19:12] about that we show we care and come
[1:19:14] towards God. I want to talk about those
[1:19:16] things. But here's the first thing is
[1:19:18] faith. And it's not just faith is saying
[1:19:21] I believe. It's faith with works. It's
[1:19:23] it's actions. It's to step out. It's to
[1:19:27] it's not I believe, but uh uh there's
[1:19:31] some evidence to what you believe.
[1:19:32] There's some evidence to what you're
[1:19:34] believing. There's some trust. There's
[1:19:36] some You know, I'm going to read a
[1:19:37] couple incidences. I won't read them
[1:19:39] tonight. Right away he goes right to two
[1:19:42] incidences that he dealt with a preacher
[1:19:44] who had a complex. He married them at
[1:19:47] the pull pit. You'll read it when you
[1:19:49] start reading the sermon. Married them,
[1:19:51] took off on their honeymoon, just as
[1:19:53] happy as anything. When they got all the
[1:19:55] way to the east coast on their
[1:19:56] honeymoon, Satan bound that man with a
[1:19:58] complex that he had. You know what they
[1:20:00] did? They were so distraught about it,
[1:20:02] they got in the car, turned back and
[1:20:04] come back to Jessville. Couldn't get a
[1:20:06] hold of brother Brandham. There was too
[1:20:08] many people, all kinds of me people
[1:20:10] waiting at the motel and they just begin
[1:20:11] to pray. Came all the way back. We've
[1:20:14] got to see them. There's something wrong
[1:20:15] here. Waited there in the parking lot.
[1:20:17] Brother Brandham says, I got up and I
[1:20:19] just started to drive around. I felt
[1:20:20] led. I was supposed to go somewhere. I
[1:20:21] turned around, came through the parking
[1:20:23] lot of the motel and they knocked on his
[1:20:26] window says, "Brother Brand, we didn't
[1:20:28] expect you to come here." They went in
[1:20:30] the motel. They shared what was
[1:20:32] happening. God showed what happened and
[1:20:34] within minutes that man was delivered to
[1:20:36] that complex.
[1:20:38] And brother Bram says, "You see, he
[1:20:41] cares."
[1:20:42] He does. But who showed that he cared
[1:20:45] now? Who showed that he cared? That man
[1:20:47] was willing to get in his car.
[1:20:50] He showed some actions with his faith.
[1:20:52] And to drive all that way, the next
[1:20:55] incident is a woman who tried to get
[1:20:57] hold of brother Brandham for nine years.
[1:21:00] She wanted an interview, wanted to talk
[1:21:01] to him. Nine years. She was troubled.
[1:21:04] I'll get back with you sooner than that.
[1:21:06] I guarantee
[1:21:08] you nine years and finally she's there
[1:21:11] outside and they they try to push her
[1:21:13] off. No. No. And God shows him a vision
[1:21:15] and it was something that happened when
[1:21:16] she was a little girl that was troubling
[1:21:19] her and the vision exposed it and within
[1:21:22] minutes she was delivered
[1:21:25] in due time. If you humble yourself in
[1:21:27] due time he'll lift you up.
[1:21:30] He starts giving these incidents because
[1:21:32] he's trying to show it's not just that
[1:21:34] God cares. He's ready to step in. How
[1:21:37] much do you care?
[1:21:39] Are you catching it? Faith has to be
[1:21:42] with action. And there has to be an
[1:21:44] evidence to your faith to step out. And
[1:21:47] he says in this quote, because if a man
[1:21:49] approaches anything he wants to without
[1:21:51] sufficient faith, he's bound to be a
[1:21:52] failure. But if he can approach it with
[1:21:54] sufficient faith, then he's bound to
[1:21:57] succeed if it's according to God's will
[1:21:59] and purpose to do it. You see what he's
[1:22:01] saying? It's not just that God cares and
[1:22:03] he can do it. He can. But he's saying if
[1:22:06] he approaches it right with sufficient
[1:22:08] faith, then he's bound to succeed. He's
[1:22:11] bound to succeed. Why? Because you bring
[1:22:14] those two things together of real faith
[1:22:17] and a God who cares and a brother or
[1:22:19] sister who really cares, something's
[1:22:21] going to happen.
[1:22:26] Amen.
[1:22:28] Praise the Lord. God bless you. Let's
[1:22:29] stand together.
[1:22:47] through sunshine or
[1:22:50] shadows.

[1:23:58] shadows.
[1:24:00] He
[1:24:03] car it up just a little bit. Brother
[1:24:05] Kenny, can we sing it
[1:24:08] now?
[1:24:09] He
[1:24:11] car for
[1:24:14] [Music]
[1:24:16] you.
[1:24:19] He careth for you.

[1:24:30] sunshine or
[1:24:35] shadows.
[1:24:38] He
[1:24:39] carth for
[1:24:42] you. Before we go tonight, we have many
[1:24:45] needs and we just want to remember them
[1:24:46] before the Lord again. But I don't want
[1:24:48] this to be just a sermon tonight. I
[1:24:52] would like you to really take it to
[1:24:54] heart. Pray about it. Realize this is a
[1:24:58] a key that unlocks the door to many
[1:25:00] things when there's a connection that we
[1:25:02] really show we care. And God steps in
[1:25:05] and show us he cares. No doubt you have
[1:25:08] things in your life right now. I don't
[1:25:10] know all of them, but no doubt you have
[1:25:11] things in your life. You could raise
[1:25:13] your hand say, "I need a God who steps
[1:25:15] into my situation. I need a supernatural
[1:25:17] God." May I offer the heart to God that
[1:25:20] says he says he's really caring. He
[1:25:24] wants me. He needs me. Can you say amen?
[1:25:27] Sometimes you say, "Lord, I need you.
[1:25:30] Lord, I need you. Lord, I I have no
[1:25:32] other path. I don't want to go to
[1:25:33] another path. I really need you to step
[1:25:36] in. May I show that I care by my faith
[1:25:39] tonight." lay your hands on one another
[1:25:41] tonight. Brothers to brothers, sisters,
[1:25:43] and sisters.
[1:25:45] [Music]
[1:25:55] Hallelujah. Lord, it's been good to be
[1:25:58] in your house
[1:25:59] tonight. And Lord, after many years of
[1:26:02] following you, Lord, we feel like in
[1:26:04] some ways we're still catching some of
[1:26:07] the keys that you brought in the message
[1:26:08] that unlocks the doors and unlocks more
[1:26:11] faith to us.
[1:26:13] Faith actually is the key that unlocks
[1:26:15] the door and your prophet taught us.
[1:26:17] Lord, tonight we see something in front
[1:26:19] of us that it's important not just that
[1:26:21] you care, Lord, but that we care. Lord,
[1:26:24] that we could offer up our heart and
[1:26:26] faith that has substance and evidence to
[1:26:29] it, Lord. That we show by our humility
[1:26:32] and by our honesty, by our confession,
[1:26:36] by our faith that we really are
[1:26:38] interested in being free. Help us to
[1:26:42] understand, Lord, these things. We
[1:26:44] praying for our brothers and sisters,
[1:26:46] the Snow family tonight. We're lifting
[1:26:48] them up, Lord, for a deliverance and
[1:26:51] healing for Sister Lori, in the name of
[1:26:54] the Lord Jesus Christ, oh God, that
[1:26:57] cares for all things. Step into the
[1:26:59] situation, Lord. I pray step into Lord
[1:27:03] uh her hospital room tonight, Lord, and
[1:27:06] be near our sister. I pray my sister
[1:27:09] Sharon, step in, Lord, and touch her
[1:27:11] with your physician's hand. I pray in
[1:27:14] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We
[1:27:16] ask it, Lord. Step into my mom's room
[1:27:18] tonight, Lord, and touch her as she's
[1:27:20] listening in. Lord, touch her with your
[1:27:22] physician hand, Lord. Let it be
[1:27:24] different tomorrow, Lord. Bring strength
[1:27:26] back to her body in the name of Jesus
[1:27:28] Christ. Take all that anemia out of her
[1:27:31] liver. I pray. Take all that cancer out
[1:27:34] of my sister Sharon in the name of the
[1:27:36] Lord Jesus Christ. Lord, I pray you'll
[1:27:38] touch Brother Bill Bailey. Take that
[1:27:40] cancer from his throat. Lord, in Jesus'
[1:27:43] name, we curse it in Jesus' name. And
[1:27:45] Lord, this heart issue with Sister Lori,
[1:27:48] we just curse what the enemy is trying
[1:27:50] to do. And Lord, we stand in faith where
[1:27:52] all the needs tonight. I know there's
[1:27:54] emotional needs and financial needs and
[1:27:57] Lord, sometimes mental things, Lord, and
[1:27:59] sometimes just spiritual needs. I don't
[1:28:01] feel close to God. Lord, would you step
[1:28:04] in and be the God who cares for every
[1:28:07] need tonight? I pray. Lord, would you
[1:28:10] just be near us? I pray. Be near every
[1:28:13] need. I pray. Lord God, we commit it to
[1:28:16] you. If we really want to be free, Lord,
[1:28:18] may we show it to you by our hearts cry.
[1:28:21] I pray. Bless every hand that was
[1:28:24] raised, Lord, that we want a God who
[1:28:26] cares. All laying aside all the sideshow
[1:28:28] and every other thing. And Lord, may we
[1:28:31] look at this message not just as
[1:28:33] doctrinal, but may we look at it, Lord,
[1:28:35] with all the nuggets and truths and keys
[1:28:38] that you have put in it, Lord, that we
[1:28:40] could find our positions as sons and
[1:28:42] daughters of God. How we love you, how
[1:28:45] we thank you, Lord. And we pray that
[1:28:48] you'll bless this little series that
[1:28:50] you've been talking to me about. May it
[1:28:53] help the people. I pray in Jesus
[1:28:57] name. Amen.
[1:29:01] Hallelujah.

[1:37:17] I've been walking in the soul cleansing
[1:37:20] blood of the
[1:37:22] lamb. Well, I was found by changing sin
[1:37:26] till one day the master came and made me
[1:37:30] a member of the blood washing
[1:37:34] man. I say praise the Lord.
[1:37:37] Hallelujah. Amen. Soon and very soon we
[1:37:41] are going to see the
[1:37:44] king. Soon and very soon.
