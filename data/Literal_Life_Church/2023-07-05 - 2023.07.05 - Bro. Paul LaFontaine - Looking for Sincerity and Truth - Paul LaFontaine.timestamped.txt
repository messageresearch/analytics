[0:00] you're listening online God bless you in
[0:01] your homes and we pray trust tonight
[0:04] will be a evening we can study the word
[0:06] together here in a bit of a study I know
[0:09] a few Wednesday nights I had talked
[0:11] about the feast a little bit and so
[0:13] tonight I'll just take a little another
[0:14] area of that that was inspired we've
[0:17] been praying about it here the last
[0:18] couple days so we'll do that praise the
[0:21] Lord God bless you each one First
[0:23] Corinthians chapter five we'll just
[0:25] study this together and you'll be
[0:26] listening real close
[0:29] it is reported commonly that there is
[0:31] fornication among you and such
[0:34] fornication as is not so much as named
[0:37] among the Gentiles that one should have
[0:40] his father's wife
[0:42] and ye are puffed up and have not rather
[0:45] mourned that he that hath done this deed
[0:48] might be taken away from among you so I
[0:51] want you to notice here the rebuke is
[0:53] not only to the ones who are committing
[0:55] fornication but it's also to the church
[0:57] and not dealing with it correctly so the
[1:00] rebuke is for both it says in verse 3
[1:03] then for I verily as absent in the body
[1:06] but present in the spirit have judged
[1:07] already as though I were present
[1:09] concerning him that hath so done this
[1:12] deed in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:14] Christ when ye are gathered together and
[1:16] my spirit with the power of our Lord
[1:19] Jesus Christ to deliver such a one unto
[1:22] Satan for the destruction of the flesh
[1:25] that the spirit might be saved in the
[1:28] day of the Lord Jesus it would certainly
[1:31] take a lot of maturity and prayer to
[1:33] handle a situation this way your
[1:36] glorying is not good now he's speaking
[1:38] to the Corinthian Believers your
[1:40] glorying is not good no know ye not that
[1:43] A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump
[1:45] Purge out therefore the old leaven that
[1:49] ye may be a new lump as ye are
[1:51] unleavened for even Christ Our Passover
[1:55] is sacrifice for us so there he refers
[1:59] to Christ fulfilling the Feast of the
[2:02] Passover he is the Passover Lamb and so
[2:05] he refers to that Feast but look what he
[2:07] says here verse 8 therefore let us keep
[2:09] the feast let us keep this Feast not
[2:13] with old leaven neither with the leaven
[2:15] of malice and wickedness but with the
[2:19] unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth
[2:24] amen thank you Father for your word
[2:28] tonight thank you for the absolute of
[2:30] your word thank you for good Christian
[2:32] Fellowship around your word
[2:35] Lord there are many social Gatherings
[2:37] that we could be a part of and
[2:39] partake in but Lord there's something
[2:41] special in our hearts when we open break
[2:44] bread together and believe the word
[2:47] together and study the word together as
[2:49] something just special about it to
[2:51] Believers and so Lord we pray tonight as
[2:54] we have worshiped and give our hearts to
[2:55] you that will you will Express Yourself
[2:57] Lord in this teaching and this preaching
[3:00] express yourself back to us and teach us
[3:03] something Lord as we sit and we learn at
[3:05] your feet and Lord we are not afraid we
[3:09] are positive Lord that this word will
[3:11] carry us through to the other side this
[3:14] word has power in it to undo and change
[3:17] situations we can't change this word has
[3:20] power to deliver the worst sinner from
[3:23] the worst condition your spirit and your
[3:26] power is able to do it so that's why we
[3:29] trust in it Lord and we just put this
[3:31] out to you tonight that we love you we
[3:34] thank you for life we thank you for the
[3:35] word we just pray father you'll get in
[3:37] it tonight and anoint us for it to
[3:40] deposit something to the people that
[3:42] they can take home with them tonight and
[3:44] we committed to you in the name of the
[3:46] Lord Jesus Christ and everybody said
[3:49] amen praise the Lord God bless you may
[3:51] be seated
[3:53] so in talking about these feasts we find
[3:56] here an example of Paul bringing one of
[3:59] them forward to teach on and that was
[4:01] the Feast of Passover and so he brings
[4:03] it Forward into a situation that we'll
[4:06] talk about in a minute uh that happened
[4:08] within the Corinthian Church there uh
[4:10] message Believers and I always call
[4:12] these local churches in the Bible the
[4:14] Corinthians the Ephesians the Galatians
[4:17] all these were actually local message
[4:20] churches that rose up as a result of the
[4:22] ministry of the son of man and so there
[4:25] were local believers who believed the
[4:26] message of their day but how many know
[4:28] that every church was different and
[4:30] every heard church had different things
[4:32] that the Holy Spirit had to address and
[4:35] the Holy Spirit knew about all those
[4:36] situations and so we know brother Brown
[4:38] referred to the Corinthians being a bit
[4:41] immature they were babies and they
[4:43] needed to grow up in certain things and
[4:45] then we find the Ephesians were grown up
[4:47] and they could be taught some of the
[4:49] deeper things and they grew into their
[4:51] position in place in predestination and
[4:53] all those things and then the Galatians
[4:56] were of course rebuked by being
[4:58] influenced by the legalistic brother
[5:00] from Jerusalem so every church just like
[5:02] the seven Church churches in Asia Minor
[5:05] everyone who had different distinctions
[5:07] and characteristics to them all of them
[5:09] had some weaknesses which by the way the
[5:11] Holy Spirit would not let go when he was
[5:14] speaking he addressed their weaknesses
[5:16] how many is glad tonight the holy
[5:18] spirit's nature is still the same in
[5:19] your life he will allow us to continue
[5:22] in our weaknesses but we'll address them
[5:24] according to the word of God every
[5:25] church is in the Asian Minor had
[5:27] different distinctions that actually
[5:28] became the characteristics of the ages
[5:32] further ages down the road but every
[5:34] that was local churches and Asia Minor
[5:37] Ephesus Smyrna in those different cities
[5:39] those are local message churches that we
[5:41] have in the Book of Revelations they
[5:43] started as just seven local churches in
[5:46] that country that area of Asia Minor
[5:48] there and it was quite something how the
[5:50] Holy Spirit addressed those different
[5:51] things and it became something different
[5:53] brother Jack Duff was had just visited a
[5:55] few of those places and he said he'd
[5:58] like to take some ministers and go there
[5:59] someday and said if I can do it I'm all
[6:01] in because I would love to go back and
[6:03] visit those places
[6:04] amen so now if you have different
[6:07] characteristics then each of each of
[6:09] them is dress addressing different
[6:10] things and so we have here Paul
[6:12] addressing a situation in the
[6:15] Corinthians Church of incest and he
[6:18] calls it fornication but it was actually
[6:20] incest and that's the same thing it's a
[6:22] sexual immoral thing going on amongst
[6:25] the congregation and so he comes and he
[6:28] deals with it in his rebuke to the
[6:30] church he deals with a different way
[6:31] because he brings in this Passover uh
[6:34] Feast that took place and he refers to
[6:37] that and then he says that we should
[6:39] keep this Feast we should keep this
[6:41] Feast so that lets us know what uh what
[6:45] I was trying to bring to you a few weeks
[6:47] ago that the the seven feasts that if he
[6:50] says we should keep this Feast so if we
[6:52] think all of these feasts are dropped
[6:54] off after the Old Testament because they
[6:56] were in the Old Testament then we're
[6:58] missing something because they we don't
[7:00] drop them off but we know that they have
[7:03] a spiritual fulfillment in our our lives
[7:05] and Jesus said it this way I come not to
[7:08] destroy the law but I come to fulfill
[7:11] the law so whatever is out there in the
[7:14] Old Testament we can't as the modern
[7:16] church just dump all that off it has a
[7:18] meaning it has a purpose and it
[7:21] translates into our spiritual walk that
[7:24] we apply these things and the Seven
[7:26] feasts are no exception there's
[7:27] something spiritual that Christ fulfills
[7:30] all those things and he's fulfilling a
[7:33] lot of those things in us so when Paul
[7:35] says we should keep the feast maybe some
[7:37] of the new Christians were saying but I
[7:38] thought we were done with that I thought
[7:40] we moved on past Calvary now we don't
[7:42] celebrate not we don't physically
[7:44] separate celebrate those days but
[7:46] spiritually they're still in place and
[7:49] he says we should keep the Feast of
[7:51] Passover so spiritually something
[7:53] happens to us if you study the Feast of
[7:55] passed over started the night in Goshen
[7:58] where God the death angel was going to
[8:01] come and he said apply the blood to the
[8:03] kill the lamb and dress the lamb and
[8:07] it's a feast of unleavened bread so have
[8:09] have bread but no leaven in it because
[8:11] leaven means sin so they're doing all
[8:13] this stuff in the household and then
[8:15] they apply the blood to the door and the
[8:18] light the death angel passed over their
[8:21] house because they had the blood and
[8:23] they had purged leaven from the bread
[8:25] and done all things all the things they
[8:26] needed to do so when you say keep the
[8:28] feast well that has a meaning for us
[8:30] because we have not only a lamb that has
[8:32] been slain for us
[8:34] we not only have applied the blood to
[8:36] our lives but Paul says a part of this
[8:40] Passover feast is to purge the leaven
[8:43] from the lump
[8:46] and he's actually dealing with an issue
[8:48] that was in the church so he's telling
[8:50] them I'm rebuking you as a church that
[8:52] you cannot A little leaven will leaven
[8:55] the whole up it's going to eventually
[8:57] affect somebody else so grow up and be a
[9:00] mature a mature Church grow up and and
[9:03] try your best to look to the word of God
[9:05] and not ignore what's going on but to
[9:08] address it to look at it because if you
[9:10] don't Purge it how many know the holy
[9:12] spirit is also a purging nature to it it
[9:15] wants to purge something that's not
[9:17] right and so if that continues in our
[9:20] Christian walk then we find under the
[9:22] Passover feast that we believe in our
[9:24] lives this Passover this lamb that we
[9:27] celebrate is one thing the next thing is
[9:29] we realize we must say Lord Purge the
[9:33] leaven out of this bread
[9:35] if I'm to celebrate this I can't just
[9:38] celebrate the sacrificial lamb at
[9:40] Calvary but I've got a purges 11 out of
[9:42] the bread
[9:43] I've got to eat this bread with the
[9:45] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[9:48] and that's the that's the two words I
[9:50] want to get to in just a minute but the
[9:51] uh sufficient to say that these feasts
[9:54] Paul's saying let's keep this Feast
[9:56] there's a spiritual keeping of these
[9:57] things it's very interesting to say uh
[10:00] that we're under this Feast of
[10:02] unleavened bread it's interesting that
[10:05] he learns it that's the bread of
[10:06] sincerity and Truth now these two words
[10:09] together sincerity and Truth together
[10:12] are only together in one other place in
[10:16] the Bible and that's the Book of Joshua
[10:20] sincerity and Truth are not mentioned
[10:22] anywhere else except here in Corinthians
[10:25] and back in Joshua and by the way at the
[10:28] end of the Joshua commission at the end
[10:31] of his life it's some of the last things
[10:33] that he says to the children of Israel
[10:36] after all their history coming out of
[10:38] Egypt all the Miracles all the signs all
[10:40] the Wonders and here he they come
[10:42] through all the history of it and then
[10:44] they come into the promised land they're
[10:46] taking their land they're taking the
[10:47] countries they're doing all this after
[10:49] all the history of being in the message
[10:51] and all the things that they've been
[10:52] through let's go to Joshua if you would
[10:55] chapter 24. and let's read it because
[10:58] it's because it's the only other place
[11:00] in the Bible it has to have significance
[11:02] that these two words sincerity and Truth
[11:06] are mentioned together must be pretty
[11:08] important and the time frame must be
[11:11] pretty important as well Joshua chapter
[11:13] 24.
[11:15] if you read the whole chapter 24 you
[11:17] read Joshua telling the people their
[11:19] history God through speaking through
[11:21] Joshua and saying I took you out of
[11:23] Egypt he gives the whole history again
[11:25] pick it up in verse 8 said and I brought
[11:27] you into the land of the amorites which
[11:29] dwelled on the other side of Jordan and
[11:31] they fought with you and I gave them
[11:33] into your hand that ye might possess
[11:35] their land I destroyed them before you
[11:37] then balak the son of zapor the king of
[11:40] Moab arose in Ward against Israel and
[11:42] sent and called The Prophet Balaam the
[11:45] son of boar to curse you but I would not
[11:47] hearken unto Balaam therefore he blessed
[11:49] you still so I deliver you out of his
[11:52] hand the the history is here is that
[11:54] every incident Balaam uh the false
[11:57] prophet come among among you Nathan and
[12:00] Cora uh the Red Sea everything
[12:02] everything in their history that they
[12:04] came through God said I delivered you
[12:06] out of all those things you're still
[12:08] standing because I was there and
[12:10] delivered you out of all of it
[12:12] and then he says verse and they went and
[12:15] he went over Jordan and came here comes
[12:17] Joshua commission now he went over
[12:19] Jordan and came unto Jericho and the men
[12:21] of Jericho fought against you the
[12:23] amorites the pairs asites the Canaanites
[12:26] the Hittites and the gurga sites and the
[12:29] hivites and the jebusites didn't I
[12:31] pronounce all those real good and I
[12:33] delivered them into your hand and I sent
[12:36] you all know that years ago when I was
[12:38] trying to pronounce all these things in
[12:39] the Bible Sister Margaret sent me a
[12:41] dictionary how to pronounce Bible words
[12:45] that's why I appreciate her so much she
[12:47] knows I need help
[12:50] you try to pronounce some of those
[12:51] things sometimes
[12:52] and I sent the Hornet before you which
[12:55] drave them out before you even the two
[12:58] kings of the amorites but not with thy
[13:00] sword nor with thy bow and I have given
[13:02] you a land for which you did not labor
[13:05] and cities which you built not and ye
[13:07] dwell in them of The Vineyards and the
[13:09] olive guards which ye planted not do ye
[13:13] eat he's saying I've brought you into
[13:16] your promise you're dwelling in it and
[13:18] we as the bride can say he's brought us
[13:20] into our Promised Land of the Holy Ghost
[13:22] when he stood at the seals he said he
[13:25] said Joshua I've seen you two-thirds of
[13:27] the way to Jordan and when the seals
[13:29] were getting ready to be broke it's
[13:31] bringing the people into their
[13:33] inheritance can you say man the bride
[13:35] can say he has brought me this far and
[13:38] now we're living in these cities and
[13:40] we're living in this word and we're
[13:42] blessed
[13:43] but it seems like every time God blesses
[13:46] the people it always comes with a
[13:48] warning
[13:50] because we can take it for granted
[13:53] we're the Most Blessed people on the
[13:55] face of the Earth
[13:56] everybody raise your hand tonight
[13:58] so I'm the most blessed person on the
[14:00] face of the Earth to see what I see
[14:02] prophets and sages have longed to see
[14:05] what you see in this day they would have
[14:08] loved to just have a portion of the
[14:10] Revelation that you understand tonight
[14:11] they would have been transported into
[14:14] this day after the Seven Seals and live
[14:16] in this time of Glory of his word they
[14:18] would have easily done it but God chose
[14:20] you to live here that's why you say you
[14:22] got to say thank God for being there for
[14:24] blessing me this way after all this he
[14:27] says I've done for you the verse 14. now
[14:29] therefore now therefore now what do we
[14:32] do now what's the end of all this we're
[14:34] at the end Joshua's getting ready to go
[14:36] pass away it's the end of the Joshua
[14:38] commission it's the end time after all
[14:41] the history of Israel coming into their
[14:43] land now therefore what
[14:46] fear the lord
[14:48] serve him in sincerity and Truth
[14:54] and put away the gods which your father
[14:57] served on the other side of the flood
[14:59] and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord
[15:02] that's our instructions now
[15:04] that's what he says yes
[15:06] serve him with all your heart but serve
[15:09] him with sincerity and Truth do you know
[15:13] what that is
[15:15] well the opposite would be insincerity
[15:18] being deceiving being fake being pretend
[15:20] having pretense as I said Sunday your
[15:23] lips honor me but your far your heart is
[15:25] far from me
[15:28] sincerity take the opposite then you'll
[15:30] understand what God's saying and truth
[15:32] instead of living on lies
[15:34] you live every day in the truth
[15:37] you're only interested in one thing
[15:39] that's truth your kids come and tell you
[15:42] something don't just jump on it wait
[15:44] until you find the truth and I'll tell
[15:47] you sometimes it takes years before
[15:49] truth is manifested a person can tell a
[15:51] lie and it sounds exactly right and be
[15:53] careful believing into it because you
[15:56] don't know sometimes it takes a while to
[15:57] manifest but we should be lovers of
[16:00] Truth can you say Amen lovers of Truth
[16:03] lovers of sincerity lovers of being real
[16:05] lovers of being real Christians wanting
[16:08] to dwell amongst people that are being
[16:09] real because the whole world's lying and
[16:11] deceiving and all that that shouldn't be
[16:12] in the church we should serve him in
[16:14] truth and honesty and serve him with a
[16:17] with an uh honesty not a deception not
[16:20] trying to give the people and and and
[16:22] cry crocodile tears that's another
[16:24] meaning for insincerity crying crocodile
[16:26] tears we don't believe them because it's
[16:28] not real we should be the most real
[16:30] people on the face of the Earth and
[16:32] saying Lord let me serve you one way
[16:34] with sincerity and Truth
[16:38] it's the essential elements at the end
[16:40] Joshua says they said what do we do now
[16:42] we've got the land we're rejoicing
[16:44] serving with all your heart with
[16:46] sincerity and Truth
[16:48] he must be saying it for a reason
[16:49] because they'll be challenged to get
[16:51] proud get proud and and lose their
[16:53] sincerity and lose and and then this
[16:56] whole thing of serving other gods so I
[16:58] think it's Joshua reminds them of their
[17:01] whole history and then he says serve him
[17:03] in sincerity and Truth the last thing
[17:05] this is what we need in the last days
[17:07] this is what we need to live this is
[17:10] what we need to display this is what I
[17:12] look for and remember every preacher has
[17:14] the right to preach this entire message
[17:16] and pull out quotes and say what's going
[17:18] to be the end what's going to be the
[17:20] final Revival what what's going to be
[17:22] what's going to be the the manifestation
[17:24] of the third poll there's so many things
[17:26] that we can do friends but this preacher
[17:28] every time I look I see that he's put
[17:31] his word in place we have his word it
[17:34] has power within it but where do we put
[17:36] ourselves to see that more and manifest
[17:38] in our life it's more simple things than
[17:40] what we realize it's not working up an
[17:43] emotion in the people it's not taking us
[17:45] back to Pentecost it's serve him with
[17:47] all our heart with sincerity and truth
[17:51] if we have Lies We Must dispel all the
[17:53] lies if we have insincerity and
[17:55] deception with one another we must Purge
[17:58] that from us and we must be a real
[18:00] people of honesty
[18:02] [Applause]
[18:04] this is what I see is the end
[18:07] God's simplifying this for me because I
[18:10] don't have to impress everybody I don't
[18:12] have to be the biggest preacher in the
[18:14] message
[18:15] and I don't have to dabble in adult
[18:17] games that people play and all kinds of
[18:20] gossips and I can back off and say no
[18:23] wait a minute I can just close in here
[18:25] and just say I just want God's given me
[18:28] something here I just want to serve him
[18:29] in sincerity and truth I don't really
[18:31] care can't really care about all the
[18:33] drama that's going on and all the drama
[18:35] in the message I don't I just want a
[18:37] servant in sincerity and truth I want
[18:40] him to be pleasing with my life
[18:42] I may not please everybody else but I
[18:45] want to be pleasing to him
[18:47] is everybody in agreement tonight he
[18:50] simplifies this thing and I don't have
[18:52] to feel a pressure to put on some
[18:54] emotion if I get emotional and do the
[18:56] victory dance like I did Sonny praise
[18:58] the Lord but tonight if that's not where
[19:00] God's leading then I'm open to What the
[19:02] Lord Has I'm not going to feel pressured
[19:04] that I have to put on something
[19:06] and be insincere I'll be myself I'll be
[19:09] how God's leading me at this moment
[19:11] because that's sincerity
[19:14] doesn't he say
[19:16] if you'll get the people to believe
[19:19] in his commission if you just get the
[19:22] people to believe and be sincere
[19:25] nothing will stand in your way not even
[19:28] cancer
[19:30] come on people
[19:32] if you just get the people who believe
[19:33] and be sincere
[19:35] and then that mamba snake come up onto
[19:37] up him in a in a dream ready to take his
[19:41] life and the angel kept telling you must
[19:43] be more sincere it always amazed me to
[19:46] come against this mob of snake you must
[19:48] be more sincere A man that had lived the
[19:51] life that he lived and the angels saying
[19:54] you should be more sincere and what he's
[19:57] saying is that there cannot be any lies
[20:00] or pretense in your life I am an open
[20:02] book before God and for everybody I
[20:05] speak the truth I live the truth and
[20:08] when I say something whatever it is I
[20:11] mean it from my heart
[20:14] you must be more sincere to come against
[20:17] this snake
[20:19] in this hour
[20:22] to deceiving
[20:25] and so his last words to the people
[20:27] before he died is to serve the Lord with
[20:29] sincerity and Truth I'll tell you
[20:31] friends I want to say to you tonight
[20:33] this is what I'm looking for this is
[20:35] what I title this service tonight this
[20:37] little bible study looking for sincerity
[20:40] and Truth what are you looking for
[20:42] brother Paul what are you looking for
[20:44] what's next
[20:45] I'm looking for sincerity and Truth
[20:48] in the people of God
[20:50] I'm looking for more sincerity and Truth
[20:52] in the people of God
[20:55] this is what I look for in my own life
[20:57] in the bride this is not just a sermon
[21:00] tonight but I'm growing groaning to see
[21:02] this I'm groaning for true and real
[21:05] Christian Fellowship
[21:09] with honesty with sincerity
[21:13] not grown-up games not childish games
[21:16] because there is both there's childish
[21:18] games and then there's new grown-up
[21:20] games that people play and politics and
[21:23] deceiving and saying what you don't mean
[21:25] but I want honesty and sincerity and to
[21:28] be amongst the people of Truth
[21:31] people who tell the truth brothers who
[21:34] call themselves brothers that will act
[21:36] like true Christian Brothers
[21:39] they communicate like brothers not like
[21:41] the world not like the wisdom of the
[21:43] world but they actually communicate in
[21:45] honesty like brothers in Christ that's a
[21:48] real brother when he acts that way not
[21:49] with pretense not hiding not fakeness
[21:52] not lying not lips that speak and
[21:55] support and compliments but their heart
[21:57] is far from it Lord let me be first
[22:00] tonight let me have a fullness of
[22:02] sincerity and truthfulness before your
[22:05] presence
[22:08] It also says to put away the Gods and
[22:11] this is in tune with First Corinthians
[22:14] five that we read when it says Purge out
[22:18] the leaven
[22:20] Joshua says you you must put away other
[22:25] gods
[22:27] what does that say purging
[22:29] Purge your lives
[22:31] if he's saying that I don't know if they
[22:33] still had uh hints towards God's there
[22:35] but we can't serve God any other way but
[22:37] in sincerity in truth and put away the
[22:39] gods which your father served that were
[22:42] on the other side that's what he says it
[22:43] sir there's a purging a lot of times
[22:45] people thinks that stops at the end the
[22:48] purging of Our Lives stops at the end
[22:50] it's actually a part of the end it's a
[22:53] it's a part of our lives at the end it's
[22:55] in this a perverted world there's still
[22:59] a purging that goes on in our lives I I
[23:02] thank God when he purges my life I thank
[23:05] God when he cleanses my life I thank God
[23:08] when he washes me of something that's
[23:10] hidden there in my life I thank God and
[23:14] I don't I don't get offended when he's
[23:16] correcting me can you say Amen when he's
[23:19] trying to purge the church or Purge me
[23:21] of something I don't get offended at
[23:23] that
[23:24] because I want to be washed without any
[23:27] spot or wrinkle can you say Amen
[23:29] Hallelujah and so it's actually part of
[23:32] it as we purge the purging is a part of
[23:35] the work of the Holy Spirit at the end
[23:36] time the challenged then he says to them
[23:40] which I feel like through the ministry
[23:42] is the challenge that's been coming
[23:44] lately choose you this day whom you will
[23:47] serve I'm in verse 15 now if it seemed
[23:50] evil unto you to serve the Lord can you
[23:52] imagine that if it if it seems evil for
[23:55] you to serve the Lord in your heart if
[23:58] it seems evil to serve the Lord
[24:01] then choose
[24:05] choose
[24:08] don't be in between
[24:10] choose who you want to serve
[24:12] if your mindset is that the message is
[24:15] bondage
[24:17] you need to make a choice
[24:21] Joshua is challenging the people saying
[24:24] if you are sitting around thinking this
[24:26] is evil to do this this is a bondage to
[24:29] do this this is can you imagine saying
[24:31] that if it seems evil to you to serve
[24:33] the Lord then what's wrong you've got to
[24:35] make a choice
[24:37] choose you to stay whom you will serve
[24:39] whether the gods which your father serve
[24:41] that were on the other side of the flood
[24:43] and the gods of the amorites and whose
[24:44] land you dwell and I love it how he
[24:47] makes it so clear he said as for me and
[24:50] my house we will serve the Lord Joshua
[24:54] said make your choice but I want you to
[24:56] let you know my choice as for me and my
[24:58] house as for me in this house we're
[25:01] going to serve the Lord
[25:04] and let the devil know we're going to
[25:06] let everybody know
[25:07] this is how we set up this church 35
[25:09] years ago as for this house we're going
[25:11] to serve the Lord as for this house
[25:13] we're going to preach the message of the
[25:14] last days the message of Christ we're
[25:16] not going to bend on it we're going to
[25:17] keep preaching it every quote from the
[25:20] Seven Seals to high heels
[25:23] we're not going to leave any of it out
[25:26] I have freedom tonight to preach all of
[25:27] it and guess what we need all of it
[25:32] make a choice we made 135 years ago that
[25:34] choice has not changed a lot of
[25:35] influences try to change me try to
[25:37] change the tone of it we're not changing
[25:39] as for me in my house we will serve the
[25:41] Lord fathers need to do that heads of
[25:43] the homes can you say Amen young couples
[25:45] do it right now make a choice this thing
[25:48] isn't an evil thing but if you think it
[25:50] is don't be be the man in the middle
[25:52] he's he's challenging them even if to
[25:54] shake their hand and say hey God bless
[25:56] you whatever Direction that's What
[25:58] Abraham did a lot as his wife looked at
[26:01] the Fashions down in Sodom and they set
[26:03] their tent they didn't go to Sodom right
[26:05] away they pitched their tent towards
[26:07] Sodom
[26:09] and Abraham just said God told me there
[26:12] needs to be a separation you choose a
[26:14] way
[26:15] and I'll choose the other way shook
[26:17] hands with his his nephew God bless you
[26:20] and I'll be praying for you
[26:23] you need to get in a fuss about it you
[26:25] don't need to influence one another
[26:27] choose who you want to serve
[26:29] choose you this day and he said to all
[26:32] of Israel Purge from the leaven Purge
[26:35] the gods right now and but you need to
[26:37] choose you this day who you will serve
[26:42] Hallelujah
[26:44] so Christ the word is our bread of life
[26:47] how many know that Christ the word is
[26:50] our bread of life
[26:52] bread
[26:53] spiritual bread is our spiritual
[26:56] nourishment it's part of our spiritual
[26:58] nourishment
[26:59] that's why the Atkins diet is
[27:01] unscriptural
[27:04] can I get an amen brother Stephen back
[27:06] there
[27:08] but let me qualify that
[27:11] for the guy who's tried every diet
[27:15] it's it's not about dieting as much as
[27:17] it is eating the right Foods all the
[27:21] time every day
[27:24] I just want to remind you though that
[27:25] the scripture is for bread
[27:27] not against it
[27:30] here's what the scripture is for being
[27:32] in good health is scriptural
[27:34] and being in good health spiritually is
[27:38] scriptural
[27:39] and that means we need every nutrient
[27:42] every vitamin
[27:44] every mineral that the god that God has
[27:47] provided for us to be healthy people
[27:49] that's why we have a world that's all
[27:51] these other things and you go one way
[27:52] and go that way and it just makes a mess
[27:54] and a lot of those you end up in a mess
[27:55] anyway and gaining all the weight back
[27:57] been there done that but it's just it's
[27:59] at the end of the day it's that God has
[28:01] provided good natural nutrients for us
[28:03] to eat a balanced diet and that's what
[28:06] he wants us to do spiritually
[28:08] and bread is one of those things the
[28:10] bread so and so when we talk about bread
[28:13] now when they broke bread together and
[28:16] often we talk about this at the Lord's
[28:18] Supper uh the term breaking of red came
[28:20] from it didn't mean that they just got
[28:23] together and they tore the bread and
[28:25] they ate it together it had a much
[28:27] deeper meaning when they broke bread
[28:29] together it meant that they come
[28:31] together to be nourished by the bread of
[28:34] life that he has sent us they're eating
[28:37] the bread of life together they're
[28:40] breaking bread together like we're doing
[28:42] tonight breaking bread together eating
[28:45] together the bread of life and breaking
[28:47] bread also means a love feast
[28:54] it's about the sweet brotherly
[28:57] Fellowship that goes on around eating of
[29:01] Christ the word in this hour
[29:04] and it can't stay sweet fellowship if
[29:08] there's leaven in the lump
[29:11] that's why purging has to go on a
[29:14] continued purging has to go on
[29:16] and so it's a it's the love Feast goes
[29:19] with it sweet Fellowship around eating
[29:21] Christ the word of the hour and our
[29:24] communion when we have it projects that
[29:26] breaking of the bread that it should
[29:28] happen all the time in our life always
[29:30] in remembrance of the Lamb this Passover
[29:33] that's what communion light is about is
[29:36] remembering what our lamb did for us
[29:37] remember that judgment passed over us
[29:40] because of the Lamb so now then in
[29:43] chapter 5 before uh
[29:47] Paul speaks of the Gathering and speaks
[29:50] of the feasts that we're at now as he
[29:52] brings in verse 11. he talks about let
[29:54] us keep this Feast of the Passover let's
[29:57] keep this Feast but it also shows how we
[30:00] eat this bread Christ is the unleavened
[30:03] bread which means there's no world mixed
[30:06] in it with it lemon is the world there's
[30:08] no world mixed in with it it's pure we
[30:11] must keep it that way the elements that
[30:14] are in it must also be in us and those
[30:16] elements he brought out are sincerity
[30:18] and truth it must be kept pure so that
[30:21] you can stay in a state of serving him
[30:24] of sincerity and of Truth whenever lemon
[30:28] comes in the world comes in we tend to
[30:30] lose our sincerity and we tend to buy
[30:33] into lies
[30:36] so to eat right we must keep the leaven
[30:38] out keep the insincerity out the lack of
[30:42] being real the lack of being honest
[30:43] losing depths of the meaning of the word
[30:46] of God we must keep living out truth
[30:49] instead of lies and so this this case
[30:52] what Paul addressed was an incest case
[30:54] going on in the Corinthian Church in
[30:56] other words it was a moral failure but
[30:58] it was deceit it was being sneaky it was
[31:01] going around the Saints and hiding
[31:04] something and because he said at the
[31:06] beginning it is reported commonly among
[31:09] you the word started to get out of this
[31:12] incest going on and they're still coming
[31:14] to church they're still having the
[31:16] Lord's supper and so now but what was
[31:19] the incest it's moral failure but it was
[31:22] dishonesty it was insincerity it was
[31:26] being sneaky
[31:27] we don't know how these people were but
[31:29] if they were coming maybe they were
[31:31] worshiping just like everybody else and
[31:33] going on and Paul had to rebuke the
[31:35] church why are you letting this go on
[31:37] without something being said about it
[31:39] and I know God rebukes and corrects most
[31:42] of the things over the pulpit and not
[31:45] publicly calling names I understand that
[31:47] because God's a gentleman I want to
[31:49] remind everybody though of scripture
[31:50] don't get scared I'm not going to do
[31:52] anything tonight but I want to remind
[31:53] you of a scripture that says those that
[31:55] sin rebuke before All That Others May
[31:59] fear
[32:01] every time I read stuff like that people
[32:03] have forgot it's in there
[32:05] and people get nervous oh which
[32:06] direction is our pastor going
[32:09] what's next I will by the help of the
[32:11] holy spirit always be a gentleman I'm
[32:13] not wanting to embarrass anybody but I'm
[32:16] also not wanting let's to let sin
[32:18] continue in the church
[32:21] that it begins to affect other people
[32:24] those that sin rebuke before All That
[32:26] Others May fear because it has to be a
[32:28] respect for the body of Christ there has
[32:31] to be a respect and he's challenging
[32:32] them grow up and be real mature
[32:35] Believers and deal with this thing don't
[32:36] let them just keep coming and not
[32:38] address it and sit them down and and say
[32:40] you need to repent of this thing
[32:44] so I could quickly mention he says the
[32:47] malice that says we should not have that
[32:49] bread of malice which means naughtiness
[32:51] wickedness on purpose uh a person is not
[32:54] ashamed to break the laws that's what
[32:55] that is and just this uh anger as well
[32:58] as we've been talking about the anger in
[33:00] this generation and also the anger from
[33:02] the enemy but still coming and gathering
[33:05] with the rest to eat he's saying let's
[33:07] let's take care of this I'll speak about
[33:10] a little bit more in a minute because
[33:11] there's got to be reasons which you
[33:12] don't know all the reasons but Paul
[33:14] gives some of them that they're letting
[33:16] this go on and he says you're not mature
[33:18] about this you're letting it go on and
[33:21] it's it's it's beginning to eat away and
[33:23] and you're proud or something's wrong
[33:25] here that you don't want to deal with
[33:27] this going on right among you and now
[33:29] everybody's learning about it
[33:32] reason for that
[33:34] I'm gonna I've been uh enjoying a
[33:38] Charles Spurgeon one of his sermons
[33:40] because when I looked up the the
[33:44] this sincerity and truth and I looked up
[33:48] what he said about it and also I'll read
[33:50] something the the messenger for our age
[33:52] talked about it but we'll talk about
[33:54] Charles Spurgeon the prince of preachers
[33:55] here in the 1800s and I don't have time
[33:58] this is a Sunday morning sermon and it's
[34:00] type it was typed out by somebody it's
[34:02] in a book but I just thought wow he
[34:04] really Nails it here and I'm going to
[34:06] read some of that tonight from Charles
[34:07] Spurgeon he says that uh you guys have
[34:10] that back there ever more in Scripture
[34:13] the doctrines of Grace are married to
[34:16] the precepts of holiness
[34:19] where Faith leads the way the virtues
[34:22] follow in a goodly train the roots of
[34:25] Holiness and happiness are the same and
[34:28] in some respects they are but two words
[34:31] for the same thing now this is really
[34:33] deep because Satan would like to
[34:36] separate Holiness from happiness I I
[34:39] sometimes talk to the young people about
[34:41] this because if you go back even from
[34:44] the very beginning of Temptation uh to
[34:47] Eve is that he always likes to separate
[34:50] the obedience that Adam and Eve are
[34:52] under and take away from that and if you
[34:55] could believe this you could be gods and
[34:56] all these so so this made them happy so
[34:59] in other words right from the beginning
[35:00] he's separating obedience and he's
[35:02] separating Holiness and being separate
[35:04] unto God to his word from happiness
[35:06] you'll be Gods you'll be happier that's
[35:08] what he does to young people if you it
[35:10] is no way that I could ever be happy if
[35:13] I live this holy life before God that's
[35:15] a lie
[35:17] I should get more amens than that that's
[35:20] a lie from the enemy that that I'll
[35:23] never be happy if I live holy
[35:25] in God that's where true happiness is
[35:29] happiness and Holiness are never
[35:31] separated
[35:33] true now not legalism but true Holiness
[35:36] and living a Sanctified life before God
[35:39] there's only true happiness in that
[35:41] and so now he says some good things the
[35:43] roots of Holiness and happiness are the
[35:45] same and in some respects they are but
[35:47] two words for the same thing there have
[35:49] been persons who have thought it
[35:50] impossible that Holiness shouldn't come
[35:53] out of the preaching of salvation by
[35:55] faith if you tell men that there is life
[35:58] in a look at the crucified one will they
[36:01] not conclude that cleanness of life is
[36:04] unnecessary
[36:06] so this is something that I just want to
[36:09] sit on just a minute because I I
[36:11] personally believe he's begging
[36:13] something way back then that would be
[36:15] the language or would be the doctrine of
[36:18] the Antichrist
[36:20] and that is that you begin to look at
[36:22] this salvation by faith that that it's
[36:26] not on works it's not what we do it's
[36:28] not what we wear it's not any of that
[36:31] salvation is on a gift of God alone it's
[36:34] what he did for us at Calvary
[36:37] so with that if you go with that then
[36:40] you would say you'd have to separate two
[36:42] things and say and there's not a life
[36:44] that comes from it but he's saying all
[36:46] the way back here in the 1800s that you
[36:49] can never separate the two and you can't
[36:50] say there's a life as we look at the
[36:53] crucified one will they not conclude
[36:54] that the cleanness of life is
[36:56] unnecessary If You Preach salvation by
[36:59] grace through faith and not at all by
[37:01] The Works of the law will they not draw
[37:03] the inference that they need not to obey
[37:06] Christ but may live as they list
[37:10] so he's begging something that now we're
[37:13] living in the full manifestation of a
[37:15] modern church that completely eliminates
[37:18] holy life and Holiness can you say Amen
[37:20] because he's done it all at Calvary and
[37:23] that's it I don't have to offer anything
[37:24] else and he's pegging it already he's
[37:26] saying but but they can live as they
[37:28] list they can live whatever the way they
[37:30] want to live to this the best answer is
[37:32] found in The Godly honest and sober
[37:34] lives of men who are most zealous for
[37:36] the gospel the grace of God on the other
[37:39] hand there have been others of
[37:40] antinomian spirit who have dared to say
[37:44] that because they are saved and Christ
[37:47] has finished his work for them so that
[37:50] nothing is left undone by way of Merit
[37:55] true therefore henceforth they may act
[37:58] as they please seeing that they are not
[38:00] under the law but under grace does
[38:02] anybody see this as the language of the
[38:05] modern church today we're not of their
[38:07] law we're under grace
[38:09] but you better separate that
[38:12] through the word through a balance can
[38:14] you say Amen
[38:15] because now you wig yourself out of the
[38:18] power of salvation
[38:21] power of a life
[38:23] because if it's true salvation it had
[38:25] power it changes your desires
[38:28] I said it changes your desires
[38:31] on the inside
[38:33] our reply is that the faith which saves
[38:37] is not an unproductive Faith but is
[38:40] always a faith which produces good works
[38:43] and abounds in holiness
[38:46] salvation in sin is not possible
[38:50] it always must be salvation from sin
[38:56] praise be to God for preachers to have
[38:59] the anointing of this word and this he's
[39:01] he's got it for sure I love that
[39:02] salvation in sin is not possible it
[39:05] always must be salvation from sin as
[39:08] well speak of Liberty while yet the
[39:10] irons are upon a man's wrist or boast of
[39:12] healing while the disease waxes worse
[39:15] and worse or glory in Victory when the
[39:17] Army is on the point of surrendering as
[39:20] a to dream of Salvation in Christ while
[39:22] The Sinner continues to fill full swing
[39:25] to his evil passions Grace and Holiness
[39:28] are as Inseparable as light and heat in
[39:30] the sun true faith in Jesus in every
[39:33] case leads to an adherence of abhorrence
[39:36] of every false way and to a perseverance
[39:39] in the path of Holiness even until the
[39:42] end
[39:42] shows you got something real
[39:46] you may make mistakes but your Pursuit
[39:48] is the pursuit of holiness
[39:52] Paul says he says now that he now that
[39:56] we have come he said now cleanse
[39:58] ourselves from all the filthiness of the
[40:00] Flesh and spirit
[40:02] perfecting Holiness in the fear of God
[40:06] it's all scriptural the Apostle Paul
[40:07] White was showing the Corinthians how
[40:09] wrong they were to tolerate an insetuous
[40:12] person in their midst compared the
[40:14] spirit of uncleanness to evil leaven so
[40:18] now he goes to the scripture of my text
[40:19] today
[40:20] then the leaven suggested to him the
[40:22] Passover and turning aside for a moment
[40:24] he applied the type of the past uh
[40:26] pastoral Feast so as to make his
[40:29] argument yet more cogent he would urge
[40:32] Purity upon them by every conceivable
[40:36] reason and his Keen Eye saw an argument
[40:39] in the sublibration of the Passover in
[40:42] using this type he furnishes me with
[40:45] another proof of the fact that hard by
[40:47] any Scripture wherein you find the
[40:50] safety of the believer guarantee you are
[40:53] sure to see needful Holiness set side by
[40:58] side with it and I can say Amen to that
[41:01] if you know your Bible as it proclaims
[41:03] the truth of how you're secure in Jesus
[41:05] Christ it always comes around to how we
[41:09] live our life in pleasing to him
[41:12] you can never separate it
[41:15] is right and he he probably knew his
[41:17] Bible better than I did he knows that
[41:19] she'd be hard to find a place of the
[41:21] safety and guarantee of the believer
[41:23] being saved
[41:25] oh and not have scriptures with it
[41:27] talking about Holiness that's side by
[41:30] side here you have the Passover of
[41:32] favored people safe beneath the
[41:34] sprinkled blood safe in that dire hour
[41:36] when the destroying Angel's sword was
[41:38] unsheathed but you find the people
[41:40] busily engaged in purging out the
[41:42] defiling leaven from their houses they
[41:44] were not saved by purging out the leaven
[41:46] but being preserved by the sprinkled
[41:49] blood they were obedient to the Divine
[41:51] precept
[41:52] and diligently put away the corrupt and
[41:55] forbidden thing the purity of the house
[41:58] from the house from leaven went side by
[42:01] side with its safety by the blood praise
[42:04] be to God
[42:05] everything brother Brandon preached
[42:07] about the token can you say Amen to open
[42:09] the Holy Ghost through the blood of
[42:11] Jesus Christ but it must be on display
[42:13] can you say amen and that household must
[42:15] be obedience and he said full obedience
[42:18] to the whole word of God whole word of
[42:20] God entitles you to the token
[42:24] amen
[42:26] we shall this morning so this is a
[42:28] morning sermon by Charles Spurgeon I
[42:30] guarantee you this it's only the start
[42:31] of his sermon
[42:33] it's so good I'd like to preach the rest
[42:36] of it
[42:37] but it's evening here so I can't
[42:39] we shall this morning first consider the
[42:42] happy conditions of the Believers next
[42:44] the holy Duty commended to them running
[42:46] side by side with their privilege and
[42:49] thirdly we shall show how their
[42:51] happiness and Holiness their Holiness
[42:54] and happiness act and react upon each
[42:58] other
[42:59] you want to study it you find it online
[43:01] in spurgeon's sermons and this one I
[43:03] think is called sincerity and Truth the
[43:06] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[43:07] you can read the rest of things it's
[43:09] powerful and I believe everything he
[43:10] said I believe it with all my heart and
[43:12] that's what I'm saying the unleavened
[43:14] bread of sincerity and Truth we're
[43:15] celebrating we celebrate that Passover
[43:17] spiritually but you can't do it by just
[43:19] saying we're all saved and I don't know
[43:22] why the Corinthians here were just being
[43:24] so uh ignoring what Paul is trying to
[43:27] bring out ignoring sin here in the camp
[43:29] and I know we try to be respectful but
[43:32] he's trying to and he uses this we must
[43:34] Purge out the old leaven lest all the
[43:37] rest of the congregation be affected and
[43:40] uh Spurgeon here I'm just going to say
[43:42] something about the Antichrist Spirit
[43:43] Spurgeon here is pegging something
[43:46] perfectly that I will call the doctrine
[43:48] of the modern Church eliminating the
[43:51] holy life from salvation and the Holy
[43:54] Ghost watering down the Holy Ghost and
[43:56] watering Down a true powerful conversion
[43:59] watering it down to making the holy life
[44:02] not necessary
[44:04] the Antichrist spirit I don't I want to
[44:07] study that greater in the future it it
[44:09] is it is something it started the
[44:11] Antichrist Spirit started in the early
[44:13] church what was it it's something that
[44:16] began was let me just call it the
[44:18] Antichrist begin in the early church
[44:19] because Paul said the mystery of
[44:22] iniquity death already work all the way
[44:24] back just a few years after the original
[44:27] Pentecost the spirit of iniquity was
[44:31] already working but I want to describe
[44:33] it this way and you can write this down
[44:35] I want to say the mystery behind church
[44:38] history is Satan's alternative
[44:41] Christianity
[44:45] I just expressed something to do if
[44:47] you're listening online or wherever uh
[44:50] if they put this on the broadcast I want
[44:52] you to think about that don't get mad at
[44:54] me but there's a mystery behind church
[44:56] history
[44:58] there's two vines that come all the way
[45:00] through there
[45:01] and the Mystery of church history the
[45:04] most alarming thing that happens that we
[45:06] cannot believe it and most churches
[45:08] would never believe it is that Satan
[45:11] presents an alternative Christianity
[45:14] than the real power of the Holy Ghost
[45:20] Spurgeon pegged it when he was saying
[45:22] that our messenger uh pegged it dead on
[45:25] and and and and here we are living with
[45:28] it here we are and so you even hear the
[45:30] language of the Antichrist you will hear
[45:32] it in so-called Christians sometimes but
[45:35] you also hear it in movie stars and
[45:38] music stars and icons that we look to
[45:42] you just listen real close to how they
[45:44] describe the grace of God
[45:48] listen real close how they saying how
[45:51] they dissect Christ and the life of
[45:54] Christ and all these other things and
[45:56] you'll hear similar comments even Justin
[45:59] Bieber became a Christian and his wife
[46:02] Hayley Bieber
[46:04] and
[46:06] there isn't anything that I can see
[46:07] there all due respect there isn't
[46:10] anything you can see from their life
[46:12] nudity and immodest stressing and all
[46:15] kinds of spirits and everything that
[46:17] fill their lives and yet they're
[46:19] Christians and they become describers of
[46:21] what real Christianity is tolerance and
[46:24] no condemning anybody and you watch them
[46:27] describe you're in trouble you're in
[46:29] trouble if you're letting people like
[46:31] that describe your Bible
[46:33] foreign
[46:34] because it won't be the language of the
[46:37] Bible of Holiness it'll be the language
[46:39] of the Antichrist
[46:41] it'll be his terms
[46:43] because it's an alternative Christianity
[46:48] friends I'll just say this the world is
[46:50] full of it
[46:51] and it creeps in Among Us
[46:55] so
[46:58] Paul
[47:00] he's the the church World eliminates
[47:03] this purging
[47:06] you know one reason I'm saying it
[47:07] tonight is when mother Brown said when
[47:09] the when the true church gets a true
[47:11] revelation
[47:12] of the two Spirits within the framework
[47:16] of the church shall become an invincible
[47:19] Army
[47:21] well I thought it was other things that
[47:23] makes her an invincible Army and all
[47:25] there's a when the church gets the
[47:26] tribulation of the two Spirits within
[47:28] the framework of the church she'll
[47:30] become an invincible Army
[47:33] we still have love we still have
[47:34] courtesy we still have respect we still
[47:37] shake hands and be brothers but be aware
[47:39] the Antichrist Spirit tries to work
[47:41] Among Us
[47:42] and so we have to be watching and when
[47:45] she realizes the two Spirits working we
[47:47] still manifest Divine love but she'll
[47:49] become an invincible Army and so
[47:52] eliminating the purging of the leaven
[47:54] from our life Paul in Corinthians
[47:56] brought this for whatever reason the
[47:58] Corinthians were pretending that this
[48:00] was not happening they were not going to
[48:01] deal with it I don't know why they were
[48:03] too proud uh maybe they were having
[48:05] services that were so great and they
[48:08] didn't want to disrupt the great
[48:10] Services they were having by trying to
[48:13] say there's fornication Among Us
[48:17] there was no preaching about it there
[48:19] was no correction about it but the
[48:21] Corinthians must have spiritually
[48:23] charged services with the gifts of the
[48:24] Spirit working and all these other
[48:26] things maybe it was just going so well
[48:28] outwardly they didn't want to be
[48:30] embarrassed to admit that there's this
[48:32] boy having relations with his stepmom
[48:37] right where they were coming to church
[48:39] and shouting with them
[48:41] and they were too proud to deal with it
[48:43] and we don't want to you know lots of
[48:45] gifts working a lot of things going on
[48:47] but notice the two problems number one
[48:49] was the fornication living a lie while
[48:52] in fellowship with the church
[48:55] a moral failure living a lie while in
[48:58] fellowship with the church but greater
[49:00] than that the church was too afraid to
[49:03] purge and to deal with it they were too
[49:05] soft the rebuke is to the church more
[49:07] than it was this young man
[49:10] from Paul
[49:12] what is the call then from Paul as I
[49:15] bring this down to a close tonight have
[49:17] you enjoyed the study
[49:19] what's the call from Paul in dealing
[49:21] with the insetuous incestuous thing that
[49:23] took place a moral failure amongst the
[49:25] congregation what's the call to the
[49:27] church the call to these immature
[49:30] Corinthian message believers
[49:32] is to begin living lives of sincerity
[49:35] and Truth
[49:38] the call is to partake of this feast of
[49:41] Our Passover Lamb but with a sensitivity
[49:43] to live lives of Truth and sincerity not
[49:46] cover everything up
[49:49] but eat the unleavened bread of
[49:51] sincerity and Truth
[49:55] and you say Amen
[49:56] this is the way brother Branham said it
[50:01] that's the way a real Christian did you
[50:04] know a real Christian doesn't have any
[50:05] sin at all imputed to him David said
[50:08] blessed is the man who God will not
[50:10] impute sent to it's not on his account
[50:13] it's been swiped off his count by
[50:15] calvary's cross there's no sin on your
[50:19] account
[50:20] no sin imputed when you're washed in the
[50:23] blood of the Lamb not by make believe
[50:24] but really the blood of the Lamb God
[50:26] does not impute to you anything that's
[50:28] done because you are under the blood and
[50:31] he doesn't see it
[50:33] there's a blood sacrifice the only thing
[50:35] he can see you in is the way he saw you
[50:38] before the foundation of the world when
[50:40] he put your name in the Lamb's Book of
[50:42] Life that's all he can look at because
[50:44] you are redeemed from everything that
[50:47] was ever done you're washed in the blood
[50:49] of the Lamb therefore there's no Gall in
[50:51] you there's no unclean Habit in you
[50:53] because that the blood of the Lamb has
[50:56] did this and God cannot Impe send to you
[50:58] after you've got a sin offering laying
[51:00] there waiting for you well you say that
[51:03] gives me plenty of room then brother
[51:04] Branham I can do what I want to I always
[51:07] do always but when a man can really see
[51:10] what Jesus done for him and turn around
[51:12] and do something contrary to him it
[51:15] shows he never received Christ
[51:20] amen
[51:23] true salvation
[51:25] true Holy Ghost feeling
[51:27] true conversion with the power of God
[51:30] behind it
[51:32] to begin a life of overcoming habits and
[51:36] sin the desire for sin has been purged
[51:39] now when it tries to come in these
[51:41] bodies there's a holy ghost that said I
[51:43] want to keep Purge in my life
[51:45] can you say Amen
[51:48] well you say that gives me plenty of
[51:50] room there but I can do what I want to I
[51:51] cannot I always do I already read that I
[51:54] got a little wife sitting back there
[51:55] she's 10 years younger than me and as
[51:57] gray as I am the reason is because she
[51:59] stood between me and the outside world
[52:01] if I was going overseas and I'd wouldn't
[52:03] this be some sort of a family live in if
[52:05] I'd gather my family around me and I'd
[52:07] say look here Mrs Branham you want to
[52:09] realize that you're Mrs William Branham
[52:11] thou shall not have any other husbands
[52:13] while I'm gone
[52:15] don't you make eyes at any other man and
[52:17] all these things don't you flirt at all
[52:19] if you do when I come back I'm going to
[52:21] divorce you
[52:23] and she'd turn around and say now my
[52:25] good man I want to tell you something
[52:26] also
[52:28] usually going to get response if you say
[52:30] something like this
[52:32] oh my good man I want to tell you
[52:34] something also Thou shalt not take any
[52:35] other woman while you're gone thou shall
[52:37] not do this and that if you do just
[52:39] consider yourself divorced when you come
[52:42] home
[52:43] and wouldn't that be a loving family you
[52:46] see no if I really love her though I
[52:50] believe if I did make a mistake and slip
[52:52] and do something wrong I believe she'd
[52:54] forgive me for it because she loves me
[52:56] and if she did I believe I'd forgive her
[52:59] for it
[53:01] certainly because I love her but if I
[53:04] love her like that as long as I love her
[53:06] like that she has no worry though she
[53:09] would forgive me I wouldn't hurt her for
[53:12] nothing
[53:14] Lord Jesus may we eat the bread of
[53:17] sincerity and Truth
[53:20] unleavened in our lives
[53:24] I'd feel the guiltiest guy in the world
[53:27] I couldn't wait for the minute I'd tell
[53:28] her about what I'd done because I love
[53:30] her well that's if I love her with
[53:32] filial like that how much greater would
[53:35] my agape love be to Jesus Christ though
[53:38] I might smoke a cigarette I never in my
[53:40] life but though I would I he might
[53:43] forgive me for it I believe he would if
[53:45] I took a drink I never in my life but I
[53:48] believe he'd forgive me for it and I
[53:51] love him too much God held me I don't
[53:53] want to do anything like that see
[53:55] because I love him that stuff is gone
[53:58] from me because when he changed me from
[54:00] a crow to a dove it made a difference my
[54:04] appetite and things left me then sin is
[54:08] not imputed to me because I don't aim to
[54:12] do it it's not in me
[54:14] to do it
[54:17] praise the Lord
[54:19] I think that's wonderful can you say
[54:22] Amen
[54:23] let's Stand Together
