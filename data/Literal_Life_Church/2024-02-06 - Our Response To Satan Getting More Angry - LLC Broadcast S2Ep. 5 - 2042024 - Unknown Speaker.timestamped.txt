[3:11] we we should never
[3:21] be take it to the Lord in
[3:28] PR
[3:31] [Music]
[3:52] take it
[3:57] to Nehemiah chapter 4 and verse 1 we're
[4:01] going to read through verse 17 I'll try
[4:03] to read rapidly but I just want you to
[4:05] catch the theme here in the time when
[4:09] they were rebuilding they had finished
[4:11] the temple and now they were rebuilding
[4:12] the walls of protection around the
[4:14] temple which ended up being the the
[4:16] finish building the walls was the
[4:19] finishing part and I'm always attracted
[4:21] to these scriptures that they were
[4:23] finishing the work because we live in a
[4:25] day that we're in the finish of the work
[4:27] of God how many know that God's building
[4:30] a building a spiritual building and
[4:32] you're you're that habitation it's not
[4:34] about this building it's about your
[4:36] building being a temple for the Lord and
[4:38] he's finishing that now we're in the
[4:40] finished work of God building his
[4:42] temples and his Temple and now this
[4:44] final stage was building the wall but we
[4:47] find here that when they were in that
[4:49] final stage they got some opposition
[4:52] from the enemy and that's what I want to
[4:54] read about here this morning Nehemiah
[4:56] chapter 4 but it came to pass that when
[4:59] s amet heard that we build the wall he
[5:01] was wroth he was angry and took great
[5:05] indignation and mocked the Jews and he
[5:08] spake before his Brethren and the army
[5:10] of Samaria and said what do these feeble
[5:13] Jews will they fortify themselves will
[5:15] they sacrifice will they make an end in
[5:17] a day will they revive the stones out of
[5:20] the heaps of the rubbish which are
[5:22] burned well spiritually speaking yes
[5:25] they will revive and take all the stones
[5:27] that the temple was destroyed and they
[5:29] will be used to revive and bring a
[5:32] Revival and put all that back together
[5:34] yet the answer is yes that's what we're
[5:36] doing now tobiah and the the ammonite
[5:39] was by him and he said even that which
[5:42] they build if a fox go up he shall even
[5:46] break down their stone wall here oh Our
[5:48] God this Nehemiah asking God now for we
[5:51] are despised and turn their reproach
[5:54] upon their own head and give them for a
[5:56] prey in the land of captivity and cover
[5:59] not not their iniquity and let not their
[6:01] sin be blotted out from before thee for
[6:03] they have provoked thee to anger before
[6:05] the Builder so built we the wall and all
[6:08] the wall was joined together unto the
[6:10] half thereof for the people had a mind
[6:14] to work so now the people would not be
[6:18] and Nehemiah had to encourage them don't
[6:21] be distracted by the anger of the enemy
[6:24] right keep your mind on what we're
[6:28] doing we're in a building project and
[6:30] we're finished in this building but
[6:32] Satan would like in his anger to stop
[6:35] that to discourage us and Nehemiah says
[6:38] we're going to pray we're going to
[6:40] continue and we're going to the people
[6:42] were of a mind to get back to the work
[6:45] that we're doing but it came to pass
[6:47] that when samulet and toaya and the
[6:49] Arabians and the amorites and the ashad
[6:52] heard that the walls of Jerusalem were
[6:54] made up and that the breaches began to
[6:56] be stopped then they were very raw so
[6:59] before before they're wroth and now
[7:00] they're very wroth Wednesday night I
[7:02] said why is the devil becoming even more
[7:06] angry now they're very wroth at this
[7:09] this work is continuing uh they're
[7:11] getting a revelation of what to do and
[7:13] they're doing it can you say amen and
[7:15] conspired all of them together to come
[7:17] and to fight against Jerusalem and to
[7:19] hinder it so now they're going to gather
[7:21] and they're going to fight against this
[7:24] here's nehemiah's response nevertheless
[7:27] we made our prayer unto God and set a
[7:30] watch against them day and night because
[7:32] of them listen there are some incidences
[7:35] today that we don't have the answers for
[7:39] many times and so we have to go to
[7:43] prayer fervent prayer amen his response
[7:47] is that you know what we're going to
[7:48] pray and we're not going to stop praying
[7:51] because the devil would like us to stop
[7:52] praying but we're not going to stop
[7:55] praying and sometimes that's the only
[7:57] thing we have left to do but we're going
[7:59] to bring a fervent prayer in faith for
[8:02] every
[8:03] need and Judas said the strength of the
[8:06] Bears of the burdens is decayed and
[8:08] there is much rubbish so that we are not
[8:09] able to build the wall verse 13
[8:12] therefore set I in the lower places
[8:14] behind the wall and on the higher places
[8:16] I even set the people after their
[8:18] families with their swords their Spears
[8:21] and their bows and I looked and Rose up
[8:23] and S to the Nobles and to the rulers
[8:25] and to the rest of the people be not ye
[8:27] afraid of them remember the Lord which
[8:30] is great and terrible and fight for your
[8:32] brethren your sons your daughters your
[8:35] wives your
[8:37] houses blessed be the name of the Lord
[8:40] don't be intimidated by the anger of the
[8:42] enemy can you say Amen we're going to
[8:44] pray and we're going to continue to
[8:45] fight not just for us but for our sons
[8:48] and daughters as
[8:50] well and it came to pass when our
[8:52] enemies heard that it was known unto us
[8:55] and God had brought their counsel to not
[8:58] God Ste stepped in and brought their
[9:00] counsel to not that they couldn't even
[9:03] fight when that happened then they that
[9:06] we returned all of us to the wall even
[9:11] one unto his work back to the
[9:14] job back to our Focus back to God's
[9:17] achievement can you say Amen because why
[9:21] vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord let
[9:23] God take care of your
[9:26] problems we pray and we get back to the
[9:28] work of the Lord and came to pass from
[9:30] that time forth that half of the my
[9:32] servants wrought in the work and the
[9:34] other half of them held both their
[9:35] Spears the Shields and the bows and uh
[9:39] habans and the rulers behind all the
[9:41] house of Judah they which build it on
[9:43] the hall and they that bear burdens with
[9:46] those that laided everyone with one of
[9:48] his hands everyone with one of his hands
[9:50] wrought in the work and with the other
[9:52] hand held a weapon every Everybody
[9:54] anybody ever see a picture like that
[9:57] with one hand they're building the wall
[9:59] the other hand they got a weapon for
[10:00] protection how many know that Satan is
[10:02] getting angry and getting even more
[10:04] Angry all the
[10:06] time we are seeing Satan's Fury
[10:10] Unleashed like never before we've been
[10:12] in conversations with Believers saying
[10:14] it just seems like there's an increase
[10:17] of the devil doing his work and he's
[10:18] very angry and his anger is increasing
[10:21] towards Believers and so now the head
[10:25] Christ is here we have the mind of
[10:27] Christ but even greater than that
[10:29] there's a body coming one with it and
[10:32] they're manifesting Christ through her
[10:34] Christ is manifesting that he's here
[10:37] through the body in the last days and
[10:40] this is what Satan is howling about I'll
[10:42] read some quotes in a few minute minutes
[10:44] where he says in Christ the mystery the
[10:47] prophet says he says that that this is
[10:49] what Satan is howling about this is what
[10:51] Satan is so angry about Christ is here
[10:54] the hedum is here the body's becoming
[10:56] one with it there's a vindication he is
[10:59] here and so he keeps saying this is what
[11:02] Satan is angry about as I said Wednesday
[11:04] night it's not your personality that
[11:06] Satan doesn't like it's not that you God
[11:09] would bless you or you don't have a lot
[11:10] of things that has nothing to do with
[11:12] Satan's anger it's when a Believer is
[11:14] becoming one in a marriage with Christ
[11:17] the word that's what he howls about
[11:20] that's what he gets angry when he begins
[11:22] to see the life flowing through body
[11:24] members and it's manifesting the same
[11:27] way it did 2,000 years ago go Satan
[11:29] begins to get
[11:31] angry now the climax comes and he gets
[11:34] even more Angry the bride has been
[11:37] laying in the presence of the son for
[11:39] many years now and she's maturing into
[11:42] manifested sons of God and you that know
[11:45] your Bible know that this last days is
[11:48] when it says all creation is waiting for
[11:51] the manifestation of the sons of God
[11:54] well we can't manifest anything until
[11:56] he's here I know we meet him in the air
[11:59] there's the physical return of Jesus
[12:01] Christ there's a coming of the Lord that
[12:03] we're still looking forward to but he
[12:04] comes because we have to become one with
[12:07] his headship he has to have the
[12:08] preeminence in the bride's life and
[12:10] there's no other group of people on the
[12:12] face of there except those elected ones
[12:15] those that are Holy Ghost people that
[12:17] are coming one with this word and she's
[12:20] doing it and Satan is howling at it he
[12:23] doesn't like it because they're maturing
[12:25] into these manifested sons of God and
[12:27] that is happening now now by the power
[12:30] of God not by intellect not by Mysteries
[12:34] not just knowing the Mysteries not by
[12:35] head knowledge not by understanding it
[12:38] up here but there's a power in it that's
[12:40] manifesting through his people example
[12:42] from the very beginning in the garden
[12:44] Satan's trouble and his anger was rooted
[12:46] in the Revelation that Believers
[12:49] had he become jealous and resentful
[12:51] towards it so I went through this thing
[12:53] and how Cain brought this and said this
[12:56] is what God wants this is where I'm
[12:57] going to worship Abel brought a a bloody
[13:00] Sacrifice by Revelation but I forgot to
[13:03] end it that that's where Cain got so
[13:05] angry at Abel that he actually killed
[13:08] him he murdered him that's how angry
[13:12] people be can become under the spirit of
[13:15] Satan at another
[13:19] believer don't take it personal if you
[13:22] got a revelation from God and you're
[13:24] acting that out by Revelation not
[13:26] intellect you you should expect expect
[13:29] that some are going to get upset about
[13:31] it you could expect to be
[13:34] persecuted can you say Amen so here that
[13:37] that began in the garden all the way
[13:39] through there was tension all the way
[13:41] through there was tension and the
[13:42] tension between the camp of Satan and
[13:44] the camp of God was usually this God
[13:47] God's people were living out of
[13:48] Revelation by a mystery they caught by
[13:50] Revelation they're living it out and so
[13:53] now here we come Satan getting angry
[13:55] more angry and uh did you ever have have
[13:59] somebody get M mad at you and more mad
[14:04] and more at and just more more mad and
[14:06] it just keeps festering against
[14:09] you and you weren't doing anything
[14:11] intentional to make them mad now if
[14:14] you're doing something intentional
[14:17] talking about a person now because the
[14:20] devil I like to make you
[14:22] mad intentionally but not a not a not a
[14:26] motive of Just In My Own Strength but if
[14:29] this word if it bothers him to keep
[14:31] preaching all the message and all the
[14:33] counsel of his word if that bothers
[14:36] Satan then I'm going to keep preaching
[14:39] it amen if that makes him more Angry
[14:42] then I'm going to keep doing and I'm
[14:43] going to keep building this wall I'm
[14:45] going to keep doing I'm going to keep
[14:46] believing it but did you ever anybody
[14:48] ever have somebody just they're just
[14:49] angry with you and getting more and more
[14:51] angry but you didn't do anything
[14:53] intentional to to to receive that type
[14:56] of anger towards yourself and uh this
[14:58] this is how it is sometimes is that
[15:00] you're not really doing anything
[15:02] necessarily uh out of the ordinary but
[15:04] just living the life and believing and
[15:07] uh uh you know when someone is mad at
[15:10] you and becomes more angry at you and
[15:13] you haven't done anything intentionally
[15:14] to bring it then you got to look and say
[15:17] I don't have the problem
[15:19] here that person has a
[15:22] problem they come to you with builtup
[15:25] anger I just I can't believe you didn't
[15:27] just then they go off on you you're
[15:28] going my goodness chill out a little bit
[15:32] what did I do and if I did something I
[15:33] want to apologize for it a lot of people
[15:35] don't come and tell you what you did
[15:37] wrong I think we should be adults in
[15:39] Christ and brothers and if you got
[15:41] something to get somebody Bible says to
[15:42] go tell
[15:44] them but they fester in their anger then
[15:47] they're so angry at you they lash out at
[15:49] you and they've never even talking about
[15:50] you don't even know what you've done and
[15:52] so the problem is not with you then you
[15:55] have to release that because they've got
[15:57] the problem
[16:00] they've got the problem with their
[16:02] anger this is the devil is that I can
[16:05] safely say that he's the one with the
[16:10] problem brother Wallace I'm not the one
[16:13] with the problem I have the Lord the
[16:15] devil's the one that's got the problem
[16:17] with the word of God and a problem with
[16:18] my Revelation and so I'm not going to
[16:21] live under his guilt I'm not going to
[16:23] live under his threatening can you say
[16:25] Amen I'm not going to live under this
[16:27] devil is becoming more in these last
[16:29] days before this Rapture I'm not going
[16:31] to be affected by that I want want to
[16:33] lose sleep over that can you I'm not
[16:35] going to be intimidated by the report of
[16:37] the enemy can you say Amen his anger is
[16:40] not going to bother me because he's the
[16:43] one with the problem I'll say to all of
[16:46] you and those those that are listening
[16:47] in the Toledo area and the broadcast
[16:50] what Toledo needs in all this area in
[16:52] this Michigan area what what this area
[16:54] needs is thousands of lived voices the
[16:57] Thunder of God th ing out in sweetness
[17:00] and Holiness and Purity and undefiled
[17:02] lives walking around in the Earth today
[17:05] without a blemish real Christians that's
[17:07] thundering out against the enemy the
[17:10] devil don't care how loud you can holler
[17:12] the devil don't care how you can jump
[17:14] and how much you can do this or shout
[17:16] but What Hurts The Devil is to see that
[17:19] Sanctified holy life consecrated to God
[17:22] if you say anything to them call them
[17:25] anything you want they're just as sweet
[17:26] as they can be and they move right on oh
[17:29] my that throws him away that's the
[17:32] Thunder that shakes the
[17:34] devil Hallelujah that's what the kingdom
[17:37] of God needs that's what this area needs
[17:39] that's what the world needs it's not
[17:41] your personality it's when someone gets
[17:44] a revelation and they're living a
[17:45] Sanctified life with that
[17:47] Revelation that's what makes the enemy
[17:50] mad Thunders out against the enemy he
[17:53] hates a confession of Faith Satan hates
[17:56] a confession of faith when it's dark and
[17:58] the there's no hope he can't stand a
[18:00] confession of Faith Satan hates that but
[18:04] the Believers are going to do
[18:05] it Believers are going to say Lord
[18:07] anoint my faith I have faith given to me
[18:11] by God but anoint it make it Revelation
[18:14] Faith because this is the thunder that
[18:17] comes out against the enemy so now I
[18:19] want to move along and say another
[18:20] reason that Satan is mad and I know this
[18:22] is simple but another reason that Satan
[18:25] is getting more angry now is because I
[18:28] believe his days are
[18:31] numbered I believe his days are numbered
[18:35] and I'm I'm wondering if lately Satan is
[18:38] trying to take his final swing right now
[18:43] the final punch the the the final CU
[18:46] he's so weak he hardly has anything left
[18:48] after fighting the bride for 6,000 years
[18:51] he hardly has anything so he's going to
[18:52] take the final swing that he has the
[18:55] final punch that he has because he has
[18:57] nothing left and he knows that his days
[18:59] are numbered and it's in these final
[19:02] days that he gets angry it's when the
[19:05] time came listen now it's when the time
[19:08] came for the Deliverance that that is
[19:11] when Pharaoh got more angry with God's
[19:14] people it was when it was time for their
[19:16] Deliverance Pharaoh got more
[19:19] Angry shouldn't that say something to us
[19:22] we're close to Deliverance so what's
[19:24] going to happen the devil's going to get
[19:26] more angry at you now you could look at
[19:28] it say I'm scared of him no don't be a
[19:30] scared of him just say my my homecoming
[19:32] is very very soon here let him get angry
[19:35] because it's probably all through the
[19:36] scripture every time he got more Angry
[19:39] it was time for the people of God's
[19:41] Deliverance to get out of
[19:43] here Pharaoh increases the pressure
[19:45] Pharaoh increases then when they he said
[19:47] he let him go then he got more mad and
[19:49] he turned on them and he came within all
[19:51] Pharaoh's Army he kept his anger
[19:53] increased more and more all the time
[19:56] it's because the time of deler
[19:58] Deliverance was at hand Speed Ahead
[20:00] 2,000 years it's when Christ was about
[20:03] to be born that the Bible says that
[20:05] Herod got wroth he began to kill the
[20:08] children he began to take extra measures
[20:10] to kill the children because the Bible
[20:12] says he got more wroth about this thing
[20:15] why the time of Christ being delivered
[20:17] was at hand what's our response to this
[20:20] anger today just stay focused on the
[20:23] word of God stay in it every day become
[20:26] a prayer Warrior I don't have a position
[20:29] in in the church let me give you a
[20:31] position become a prayer Warrior that's
[20:34] what we need in the
[20:37] church Hallelujah they stayed focused
[20:40] they they they just dealt there with
[20:42] that contrary spirit always laying there
[20:44] it's always there always will be there
[20:46] that contrary Spirit but stay focused on
[20:48] the work of the Lord samulet means sin
[20:51] and tobiah means Jehovah is good which
[20:53] is really strange sablet means sin and
[20:55] toaya means Jehovah is good the these
[20:58] two influences are contrary to the
[21:01] deeper walk of the Lord in you sin is
[21:03] your is contrary and someone who just
[21:05] wants to see Jehovah as a good
[21:09] God not a God of War not a god of
[21:13] overcoming but just a good god brother
[21:17] Paul why can't you just I bring visitors
[21:20] here why can't you just be
[21:23] nice he's a good God just preach the
[21:26] good things
[21:32] he is a good
[21:33] god I believe that but he's a man of war
[21:38] he's a man of
[21:39] Justice he's a man that tells the
[21:43] truth Christ is one who tells the Christ
[21:46] is the very essence of Truth so if you
[21:48] get around Christ you're going to hear
[21:49] truth might take the very height off you
[21:52] but you're going to hear truth not just
[21:54] that he's a good God you're a good boy
[21:56] you're a good little boy you're okay
[21:58] everybody's doing you wrong you're a
[22:00] victim of everybody I'm not going to
[22:02] continue to make you a victim because
[22:04] victims victims that are getting the
[22:05] Holy Ghost are rising above victimhood
[22:07] today is that anybody can do anything
[22:10] they want to that's their problem I'm
[22:12] going to go on serving the lord I will
[22:14] not encourage your victimism on the
[22:17] government
[22:18] will but Christ doesn't I've been done
[22:22] wrong by every church I've been to
[22:24] brother
[22:26] Paul
[22:29] go ahead and I'm thinking this one's
[22:30] going to do me wrong just like all the
[22:32] rest of
[22:33] them
[22:36] victim time to grow
[22:38] up time to become a
[22:41] warrior time to get back on building the
[22:43] kingdom and the walls and this finishing
[22:45] work trying to find the reason why Toba
[22:48] tobah and selet were contrary as selet
[22:52] and Tobias had positions maybe and maybe
[22:55] they were jealous that the king never
[22:57] gave them positions in this I don't know
[22:59] why they were so
[23:01] angry
[23:04] but they were grieved that someone was
[23:07] seeking the welfare of the Jews maybe
[23:09] they could have been jealous could be
[23:11] they were not put in charge of it samlet
[23:14] and tobiah why didn't this King who's
[23:16] our King put us in charge of this work
[23:19] maybe they were jealous of
[23:21] that we were not
[23:26] informed maybe they were mad because I
[23:29] was not informed of this
[23:32] myself we didn't vote on
[23:36] that I don't know but they got the angry
[23:39] of the devil against the wrong people
[23:42] right the people that are trying to do
[23:44] the final work of the
[23:45] Lord the last effort I don't know if you
[23:48] read your Bible I didn't read it this
[23:49] morning but it's in there the last
[23:51] effort they gave to come against the
[23:53] work of the Lord was they
[23:56] called uh Nehemiah samulet Nehemiah and
[24:00] said could we get together in the
[24:03] village and I like to work this way can
[24:06] we just have a coffee and
[24:11] talk you know it's the Devil he's going
[24:13] to try every means I mean this is the
[24:16] same guy who was putting together an
[24:18] army to fight against them this is the
[24:21] same guy that mocked him him toai the
[24:23] same guy who gossiped against them the
[24:25] same one now says can we have coffee and
[24:27] just talk you know what neemi said no we
[24:34] can't people get
[24:38] quiet but I've had to tell some people
[24:41] sometimes it seems in polite say you
[24:43] know I'd love the fellowship around the
[24:44] word but when the motive is there and I
[24:47] can see it Nehemiah said I'll read it to
[24:51] you no I won't be able to
[24:54] go he says you got to hear his response
[24:57] to this
[24:59] he says samulet and Gish sent unto him
[25:01] saying come and let us meet together in
[25:02] some one of these Villages at
[25:10] Starbucks let's meet at Starbucks and
[25:12] just discuss this now that's the same
[25:14] guy that wanted to destroy
[25:16] you let's have a coffee at Starbucks
[25:20] doesn't say that but they thought but
[25:23] they thought to do me Mischief so now
[25:25] he's calling it mischief and I sent
[25:28] Messengers to them saying I am doing a
[25:32] great work so that I cannot come down to
[25:37] [Applause]
[25:40] Starbucks why should the work
[25:43] cease while I leave it and come to
[25:47] Starbucks with you that seems harsh that
[25:50] seems but listen if someone's got a
[25:52] sincere heart and want to Fellowship
[25:54] around the world and sincere questions
[25:56] I'm all there
[25:58] but when there's a track record that
[25:59] shows listen I'm not going to be drawn
[26:02] away from the work of the Lord in
[26:04] people's lives that I need to pour
[26:06] myself
[26:07] into yet they sent unto me four times an
[26:12] invitation to
[26:15] Starbucks and I answered them after the
[26:18] same
[26:21] manner the devil is becoming more and
[26:24] more
[26:25] angry and when he they had the
[26:28] swords and God backed them off and the
[26:33] people of God had the swords they kept
[26:34] working on the Lord they he got more
[26:36] angry and said they're not going to stop
[26:38] they're not going to stop doing what
[26:39] they're doing and he became more
[26:41] festering and more Angry more Angry
[26:43] until he tried other means and
[26:45] everything and as I said at the
[26:48] beginning after a while you have to say
[26:50] this is not a problem with me as much as
[26:52] it is it's a problem with their anger
[26:56] and they need to resolve their anger
[26:58] if you have anger this morning you
[27:00] better resolve your
[27:02] anger you better bring that to the to
[27:04] the
[27:05] Cross because the devil will use that
[27:08] he'll take his anger with your anger and
[27:10] it's not
[27:11] good so we release it we forgive we let
[27:15] it go because I want to be doing the
[27:16] work of the Lord I don't want to spend
[27:18] my whole life in anger I don't want to
[27:19] spend my whole life participating and
[27:22] coming against the word of God I want to
[27:24] be the ones that's in the army of God
[27:26] identifying myself I'm all in I'm part
[27:29] of the army of the Lord I'm part of the
[27:31] solution not the problem I don't know
[27:33] where you feel you are today in the Lord
[27:36] but I'm going to give that most of you
[27:38] are sitting here because something has
[27:40] been deposited in your heart that you
[27:42] know had to come from God you may not
[27:45] feel like you're all where you need to
[27:47] be but if you can say that something is
[27:51] in your heart that's come from God and
[27:53] not yourself and he deposited in there
[27:55] even it was 20 years ago May it was the
[27:57] last week if you can say that then you
[28:00] have enough response to the devil to say
[28:03] you didn't give that to
[28:05] me and Satan you can't take it away
