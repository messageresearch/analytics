[0:00] our text this morning will be from
[0:01] philippians chapter 4
[0:03] and it says in the king james be careful
[0:05] for nothing i like the english standard
[0:07] version it says do not be anxious
[0:10] about anything
[0:13] that's pretty all-encompassing don't be
[0:15] anxious about anything
[0:18] and tell you what now i think this is
[0:21] even more applicable in the time that we
[0:22] live in we live in an information age we
[0:24] have at our fingertips
[0:26] we know more than any other age did
[0:29] about things that are beyond our control
[0:32] there's things that we can worry about
[0:33] that nobody else would have known they
[0:35] could worry about them but because we've
[0:37] got all the notifications coming up i
[0:39] was in mcdonald's yesterday two days ago
[0:42] with my daughter and there's this man
[0:44] waiting because there's fear of people
[0:46] working at mcdonald's or any fast food
[0:47] restaurants nowadays he's chatty he's
[0:49] talking on the phone about something
[0:51] with somebody else about the russian
[0:52] potential invasion of ukraine
[0:55] since when are people on downtown lima
[0:57] concerned about the russians invading
[0:58] ukraine
[1:00] but
[1:00] that that's what that was the
[1:01] conversation going on and he wasn't a
[1:03] russian studies student i don't think um
[1:06] but you know we know more than any other
[1:08] age has had of what we could be worried
[1:10] about
[1:11] that paul says don't be anxious about
[1:14] anything
[1:15] instead in everything by prayer and
[1:18] supplication with thanksgiving let your
[1:21] request be made known unto god
[1:23] there's nothing too big that god says
[1:25] you really should be worrying about
[1:27] and on the other side there's nothing
[1:29] too small that god says we shouldn't be
[1:32] able to pray about
[1:34] and if we do that we take those things
[1:37] the peace of god which surpasses all
[1:40] understanding and that
[1:43] it passes the the ability of our
[1:45] understanding to fathom how god's peace
[1:48] can work how we can a lot of times when
[1:50] we pray when we're in the midst of a
[1:52] trial god doesn't take the trial away
[1:54] from us just like that we pray for that
[1:58] but you sometimes he does but usually
[2:01] not
[2:03] but the miracle
[2:04] the miraculous thing is even when he
[2:06] doesn't change the trial he changes us
[2:10] so that even in the midst of the trial
[2:11] where nothing has really changed except
[2:13] our heart
[2:14] that we're able to keep on going and
[2:16] that's that that piece of god that
[2:18] passes all understanding how can you in
[2:20] this situation still have peace
[2:23] because my god's in me that's the answer
[2:25] and this peace of god that's beyond our
[2:27] comprehension but it will the king james
[2:30] says keep our hearts the english
[2:32] standard guard our hearts in other words
[2:34] it will garrison our hearts it'll
[2:36] fortify our hearts
[2:38] that peace it's our fortress behind
[2:40] which we can hide we
[2:42] we we we can hide behind the peace of
[2:44] god it'll guard our hearts and our minds
[2:49] in christ jesus
[2:51] so we just asked the lord to bless his
[2:52] word this morning father i just pray
[2:54] that you would be with us today lord and
[2:56] as we talk about
[2:58] cares concerns worries so we all have
[3:01] things that
[3:03] terrible things happen in life i was
[3:04] listening to the prayer requests today
[3:06] and just oh my just so such
[3:09] heart-rending things
[3:11] but lord i just pray that you still say
[3:13] even in all those things
[3:15] to take them all to you in prayer that
[3:16] you can we can have your peace even even
[3:19] in those things lord i pray you'll be
[3:21] with each one in jesus name amen
[3:26] there's a story told about a businessman
[3:29] who always seemed to find something to
[3:32] worry about and of course he could worry
[3:34] about this business because you're
[3:35] responsible for a lot of things
[3:37] as a businessman but of course there are
[3:39] other things he could worry about and he
[3:40] did he worried about his wife
[3:42] he could worry about his children
[3:45] if your children are married you can
[3:46] worry about your children's spouses
[3:48] you can worry about your grandchildren
[3:51] he had pets you can worry about your pet
[3:53] you know you can actually get health
[3:54] insurance policies on your pets nowadays
[3:56] you can
[3:57] you can get life insurance policies
[3:59] offer for your pets nowadays to cover
[4:01] all uh end of life expenses you can
[4:04] people worry about that there's a market
[4:07] um
[4:08] manipulating people's worries about
[4:09] their pets this businessman had those
[4:11] kinds of worries he could worry about
[4:12] his health his car
[4:14] his house his plants if he's retired
[4:16] he'll probably start worrying more and
[4:18] more about his neighbors
[4:19] or the neighborhood you can worry about
[4:21] criminals what's going on out
[4:24] when your vehicle is unoccupied worry
[4:26] about the weather there's a storm coming
[4:28] up this weekend this is this week
[4:30] wednesday thursday watching for you
[4:31] could be worrying about that i've got a
[4:34] teacher who watches the weather in china
[4:36] because in about two weeks time that's
[4:38] the weather we're gonna have here she
[4:40] and she's oftentimes dead on
[4:43] but we can worry about all these things
[4:46] and he had so many worries
[4:48] he had a hard time keeping track of them
[4:50] all which became another worry so he
[4:51] decided to grab an excel spreadsheet and
[4:54] he started tracking his worries
[4:57] and he was able to then to uh to
[4:59] categorize them and classify them into
[5:02] his worry chart he found that 40 of the
[5:05] things that he worried about
[5:07] never happened
[5:09] 40 of the things we can could worry
[5:11] about
[5:12] never happen we imagine the worst case
[5:14] scenarios they don't come to pass
[5:17] another 30 percent of the things he was
[5:19] worrying about were about things that
[5:21] had already happened and that he could
[5:24] do absolutely nothing about
[5:26] yet that's still something that hey been
[5:28] there done that you just maul over what
[5:30] if i had chosen something different what
[5:32] if i had done this differently and but
[5:34] you can't do it differently it just is
[5:36] just kind of completely draining your
[5:38] emotional battery
[5:40] and then another 12
[5:42] were about people's criticisms of them
[5:46] or maybe it was what he thought people's
[5:48] criticisms were of him when maybe they
[5:50] weren't criticizing him at all been
[5:52] there done that as well
[5:54] sometimes we think people are thinking
[5:55] about this and they're actually not
[5:57] thinking about us at all that happens
[5:59] too
[6:00] then another 10 were just minor health
[6:02] concerns
[6:04] and if we add that up that's 92 of the
[6:07] things
[6:08] he really has very little control about
[6:09] that aren't that important or just eight
[6:11] percent of the worries that he had
[6:14] were legitimate concerns in the sense
[6:16] that they were something he could do
[6:17] about of those eight
[6:19] four percent or half of those
[6:22] they were important but he had little or
[6:24] no ability to really change the
[6:25] situation or impact the situation at all
[6:27] so you could worry about it but it would
[6:29] absolutely do no good because you can't
[6:31] change that person's life anyway they're
[6:34] just four percent left
[6:36] these are important concerns and i have
[6:38] a strong potential to impact them that's
[6:40] where you want to focus your attention
[6:42] but there are 96
[6:44] of his worries or distracting him from
[6:46] the four percent so you can actually do
[6:48] something
[6:49] about
[6:50] i think there's a lesson
[6:52] for us in there
[6:54] paul's encouragement not to worry it's
[6:56] more applicable
[6:57] like we said
[6:59] i know of now with the information agent
[7:02] notifications i know of one
[7:04] one elderly gentleman who had a special
[7:06] app on his phone for real
[7:08] um let him know if there's an earthquake
[7:10] any place in the world so he would be
[7:12] ready in case california or the big one
[7:14] was coming it would would go off they
[7:15] have the earthquake sound there this
[7:17] this hip and he would know it didn't
[7:19] help his heart condition didn't help his
[7:21] nervous condition didn't help his wife's
[7:23] nervous condition but he would know
[7:25] there was an earthquake somewhere
[7:28] in the world but this is an
[7:30] all-inclusive command that paul gives
[7:32] be anxious for nothing and the devil's
[7:35] rigging our game with every single turn
[7:37] the notifications off he's rigging the
[7:39] game so that we can always have
[7:41] something to worry about
[7:44] but um his command touches every area of
[7:47] our lives natural things spiritual
[7:50] things our health relationship finances
[7:53] ourselves our parents our spouse
[7:56] everything the past the present the
[7:58] future
[7:59] everything
[8:00] and as we talk about
[8:02] things that could weigh us down and
[8:04] concern us today i wanna
[8:07] i wanna i mean for us to take seriously
[8:09] what paul says
[8:11] not to be anxious about anything without
[8:13] at the same time
[8:15] minimizing or diminishing
[8:17] the importance of any of the things
[8:19] that can happen in our lives because bad
[8:22] things happen in our lives and we would
[8:25] be very calloused
[8:26] if we had no feel for it
[8:29] god's not asking us to go forth and say
[8:32] everything's good in life nothing bad's
[8:33] happening i'm just going to keep on
[8:35] going that's not we're not we're not
[8:36] presenting a glib
[8:38] gospel jesus himself went through life
[8:42] he could see things he was moved with
[8:43] compassion his heart would be groaning
[8:46] as he saw things he was moved to tears
[8:48] he wept
[8:49] god gave us those emotions and we will
[8:52] feel with those emotions so we're not
[8:54] we're not asked to live an unfeeling
[8:56] life but we don't want our emotions to
[8:59] control us because when that happens
[9:02] we worry
[9:04] it said that worry is like a rocking
[9:06] chair because it takes you back and
[9:09] forth
[9:10] but it gets you absolutely nowhere
[9:13] tries to make you as comfortable as
[9:14] possible just staying right there
[9:17] staying in the rocking chair and do
[9:18] nothing about any situations just going
[9:20] back and forth that's what worry does
[9:23] it's like freeze tag you're you're
[9:25] frozen and you can't do a single thing
[9:27] about it
[9:29] well what is worry we could define worry
[9:31] as uh feeling uneasy or concerned about
[9:34] something to be troubled that's our our
[9:37] dictionary definition i've just kind of
[9:40] thought about it lately as i've noticed
[9:42] how the devil uses negativity in my own
[9:44] mind and i kind of developed my own
[9:46] little definition here so this is not
[9:48] the dictionary definition it's very free
[9:50] to be criticized
[9:52] but worry i call it the the action of
[9:54] our imagination
[9:56] when it's directed by negativity
[9:59] when you get those negative thoughts and
[10:01] then we just let our imagination go wild
[10:03] with them and run with them
[10:05] that's worry that's why i kind of
[10:08] feel it
[10:09] and
[10:10] i was thinking about doing an experiment
[10:12] here and a demonstration in church but
[10:14] there's so much
[10:15] room for after the picture would do just
[10:17] as well but think about it this glass of
[10:19] water
[10:21] is
[10:21] like like our minds
[10:23] and this one little negative thought
[10:25] that's that ink that can be dropped in
[10:27] there
[10:29] now if you just leave it alone that ink
[10:31] if it's a cold glass of water it will
[10:33] just settle right down to the bottom
[10:36] and you would be able if you had one of
[10:37] those things you have at the banquet you
[10:39] could put up your glass beneath it you
[10:40] could press the button and the water
[10:42] goes out the bottom right and you would
[10:43] be able to drain that naked that that
[10:45] blue ink out
[10:48] but
[10:49] when we get a negative thought the first
[10:50] thing that we're tempted to do it comes
[10:52] into our minds and we can't really
[10:54] control very well the thing
[10:56] the devil has the right to throw
[10:57] thoughts at us we can't be condemned for
[11:00] that but what do we do with them
[11:02] that that thought that that drop of
[11:04] black or or blue ink comes into our
[11:07] minds what we tend to do is we get to
[11:09] take our
[11:10] stirring stick
[11:11] we just get all stirred up about it you
[11:14] know what before the few seconds time
[11:16] that black ink is everywhere in that
[11:19] water if you you wouldn't be able to
[11:21] drain it if you tried it's not going to
[11:23] happen
[11:24] and that's what happens when that
[11:27] negative thought comes to our mind
[11:30] and then we give it a second thought the
[11:31] third thought and then we start
[11:34] getting ourselves stirred up
[11:36] and before long
[11:37] you're mad about things that have never
[11:39] happened
[11:41] you're mad and the situation hasn't
[11:43] hasn't happened yet but you know what
[11:44] your mother or father-in-law would say
[11:46] about it and then you would say this to
[11:48] that then you would just
[11:50] and you were all having this argument in
[11:51] your mind you're having hard feelings
[11:52] about something that has never happened
[11:54] and probably will never happen
[11:56] but that is what we do when we let our
[11:59] imagination be guided by the negative
[12:02] that's what it is
[12:04] and i can remember several years back i
[12:05] went to a teacher's convention it's been
[12:08] a really tough school year and this i go
[12:10] to this teacher's convention i
[12:12] i even forget what the title of it was
[12:14] but it was one of those things with yeah
[12:16] there's nothing really else interesting
[12:17] at this time period
[12:19] this i'll go to this session and i hope
[12:21] it's not going to be just another chapel
[12:23] message
[12:24] and i get in there and sound like yeah
[12:26] it's gonna be another chapel message but
[12:27] i listened
[12:28] and it was
[12:30] and
[12:31] this was a i i was like four or five
[12:33] years ago and it has stuck with me
[12:35] and
[12:36] the text to the uh this
[12:38] superintendent was but daniel purposed
[12:40] in his heart that he would not defile
[12:42] himself
[12:44] and what spoke to me in that session so
[12:46] much
[12:47] it was so eye-opening to me as i had let
[12:50] in the course of that school year so
[12:51] many negative thoughts
[12:54] into my mind
[12:55] stir up about dwell on them try to
[12:57] prevent things and all that and it had
[12:59] completely poisoned my spirit i couldn't
[13:03] be optimistic about anything i been
[13:05] dragging everybody down around me
[13:08] negative thinking defiles us
[13:10] it's a poison
[13:12] and if you start recognizing this this
[13:14] thought it's in my mind but i don't want
[13:16] to go down this way stop you can't you
[13:19] can't stop
[13:20] it it breaks a habit because sometimes
[13:22] we do feel sorry for ourselves and we
[13:24] start stirring that
[13:26] that stirring our emotional
[13:28] our with with that with that stirring
[13:30] stick we just do it everything goes
[13:32] around because we feel like i should be
[13:33] able to this isn't right but and we do
[13:35] that we indulge ourselves
[13:37] to our own detriment
[13:39] so when we have those negative thoughts
[13:41] come in we just go in with the next
[13:43] scripture that paul had in philippians
[13:45] what should we think about finally
[13:47] brothers whatever is
[13:49] true
[13:50] that actually is
[13:53] the devil gets our imagination going on
[13:55] things that might be but probably never
[13:57] will be that means it's not true
[14:00] we want to have our we want to base our
[14:02] thinking in god's reality
[14:04] so if it's true if it's honorable if
[14:07] it's just if it's pure how often in our
[14:10] thinking when we're stirred up do we
[14:12] impute to people
[14:14] bad motives maybe they are moved by bad
[14:17] moods maybe they are
[14:18] but sometimes maybe they aren't
[14:21] maybe this isn't an evil genius that
[14:23] we're up against maybe it's just another
[14:24] human being who's being motivated by a
[14:27] demon or we're right behind there
[14:29] fighting a battle of flesh and blood
[14:32] we should have a filter over our
[14:34] thoughts whatever is pure
[14:36] lovely commendable
[14:38] and then if
[14:40] if there's any excellence or virtue
[14:42] things worthy of praise think on those
[14:45] things because you've got to get the
[14:46] that poison out of our minds and replace
[14:49] it with something else sometimes if then
[14:51] if we've gotten straight up just empty
[14:52] your empty your mind of all those things
[14:54] do a mind
[14:55] just empty it out and fill up with
[14:57] god's thoughts again we we need that
[15:01] because you know what if we don't
[15:03] replace it we just kind of stir
[15:05] stir up our our imagination up with all
[15:08] the negativity
[15:09] what's the result worry is going to get
[15:11] us to die a thousand deaths
[15:15] by crossing bridges before we get to him
[15:18] think oh man this has happened if this
[15:20] happens i'll never be able to deal with
[15:22] this situation we're imagining how we'll
[15:24] deal with a situation that is not here
[15:26] yet
[15:27] we just think how it's going to be and
[15:28] we'll cross bridges before we get to him
[15:31] die multiple times go through the
[15:32] anxiety of things we might not ever
[15:34] actually
[15:35] have to come up against brother branham
[15:37] talks about this
[15:39] in different prayer lines
[15:41] i like like this when he's speaking to
[15:43] her sister how do you do sister
[15:45] you're the type of person
[15:47] once believing you believe kind of hard
[15:49] for you to see it but you also do a lot
[15:50] of worrying about things
[15:53] crossing bridges before you get to them
[15:55] build castles that never come to pass
[15:57] because that's your nature some of us
[15:59] are built that way
[16:01] but if you'll believe me as god's
[16:03] prophet you do all right the diabetes
[16:05] will leave you you can go home and be
[16:06] well can you believe that go ahead you
[16:08] have believed you can receive
[16:11] but she's got to live in the here and
[16:12] now
[16:13] in god's reality with god's promise
[16:15] instead of
[16:17] crossing some bridge that she may never
[16:19] even get to
[16:22] another message mr brother bands talking
[16:24] to somebody you're suffering with an
[16:25] extreme nervous condition you're very
[16:27] nervous it's a mental nervous somewhere
[16:30] else it talks about the person's
[16:31] personality you're the deep thinking
[16:34] kind says you're weary crossing bridges
[16:36] before you get to it always counting
[16:39] something that never happens
[16:41] stop
[16:42] doing it
[16:44] now if he says stop doing it
[16:46] we're able to stop doing it
[16:49] we're able to he wouldn't god wouldn't
[16:51] tell us do something that we're that's
[16:53] not in our power to do
[16:55] and yes we if
[16:56] we might be triggered by certain things
[16:59] but we
[17:00] look we can by god's grace we can learn
[17:02] to recognize it and stop going down that
[17:04] path and we'll be so much happier for it
[17:07] your family will be so much happier for
[17:08] it everybody in the body of christ
[17:11] will benefit because of it
[17:18] we can turn our bibles to matthew
[17:19] chapter six
[17:21] i don't have this on the uh
[17:24] on the uh slide but sometimes it's good
[17:26] to
[17:27] remember we bring our bibles to church
[17:29] sometimes to open them and look in the
[17:31] scriptures too
[17:33] matthew chapter 6
[17:35] and we'll start at
[17:37] verse 25.
[17:44] and this is in the middle of jesus's
[17:46] sermon on the mount
[17:49] and i've been
[17:50] we've been teaching about the sermon on
[17:52] the mount a little bit in my bible
[17:53] classes at school and i just kind of is
[17:55] kind of getting into thinking about it
[17:57] and there are so many people who are
[17:59] following jesus's ministry especially at
[18:01] the beginning
[18:02] who had who were following with a
[18:04] particular expectation of where it was
[18:05] going to lead that this this is a person
[18:08] even john the baptist was thinking maybe
[18:11] he's going to thoroughly purge the floor
[18:13] get the romans out here there's a
[18:14] certain expectation
[18:16] um
[18:17] and
[18:18] people are
[18:19] this is one of jesus's perhaps early
[18:21] sermons we don't know exactly and people
[18:23] are listening what's he going to do with
[18:24] the the power of the people that are
[18:26] following him and they're expecting him
[18:29] to start building an earthly kingdom but
[18:31] jesus
[18:32] disappoints their expectations because
[18:34] he's not going to be looking at the
[18:35] kingdom around them he's going to be
[18:37] pointing to the kingdom of god that's
[18:38] within them
[18:40] and
[18:41] that's what um that's what this is kind
[18:43] of going to be pointing at
[18:45] in matthew 6 25 starting here
[18:49] jesus is going to be speaking about
[18:50] anxieties and cares
[18:53] it says therefore i say unto you take no
[18:55] thought for your life what you shall eat
[18:58] or what you shall drink
[18:59] nor nor yet for your body what you shall
[19:02] put on is not the life
[19:04] more than meat and the body of enraiment
[19:08] hold the fowls of the air for they so
[19:10] not neither do they reap nor gather into
[19:13] barns yet your heavenly father feedeth
[19:15] them are you not much better than they
[19:18] which of you by taking thought can add
[19:20] one cubit to your stature i think that
[19:22] verse just kind of illustrates worry
[19:24] changes nothing
[19:26] we can think think think i want to be as
[19:28] tall as somebody else i want to have the
[19:30] i want to have the build of somebody
[19:31] else i could say i wish my i wish my
[19:34] arms were as big as brother kyle i could
[19:36] think think think it's not going to
[19:37] happen
[19:38] it's not going to happen
[19:40] worry about that it's not going to i
[19:41] could do other things that might help me
[19:43] with that but worry won't
[19:45] so worry is not going to change anything
[19:48] in fact our worrying leaves little room
[19:51] or no room for the lord to provide
[19:54] look at uh you talked about that in
[19:55] verse 26 in verse 28 why do you think
[19:58] fought for raymond consider the lilies
[20:00] of the field how they grow they toil not
[20:03] neither do they spin
[20:04] by worrying they have absolutely no uh
[20:07] by worrying we're removing god from our
[20:10] situation
[20:12] and i just want to i think compare
[20:14] worrying here we've got the picture of
[20:15] jesus here with the rich young ruler
[20:17] which is not from the sermon on the
[20:18] mount
[20:19] but
[20:20] later in jesus ministry this rich young
[20:22] ruler comes and approaches him
[20:24] and if you look at the picture
[20:26] there are lots of cares
[20:28] worries and concerns you can look at the
[20:32] the man you can see the the the
[20:35] the concern and the care in his face the
[20:37] anxiety that he's probably carrying
[20:39] you can look at the suffering there on
[20:41] the other side of the screen the the
[20:42] woman in black holding the uh caring for
[20:44] the uh i think that's lazarus
[20:47] they're at the door
[20:48] they're outside the rich man's gate that
[20:50] jesus told the story about there's lots
[20:52] of care here lots of things to worry
[20:55] about lots of lots of bad things in the
[20:57] world that we can that can affect us
[20:59] a worry
[21:01] it's like a pair
[21:03] of scissors
[21:05] and what the scissors do here
[21:08] the negative thoughts create a picture
[21:11] in our minds and worry snips christ out
[21:15] of the picture bit by bit
[21:18] and by worrying
[21:20] we get a picture like this
[21:22] there's no christ
[21:24] in this picture anymore there's no
[21:26] christ here who's able to change the the
[21:29] concerned young man's heart there's no
[21:31] christ here who's able to to touch and
[21:34] heal the person they're behind him all
[21:36] you get
[21:38] is a very very dark picture
[21:40] a man with concerns it's in this picture
[21:43] there is hopelessness there's angst
[21:46] there's fear because worries that
[21:48] parishes go snip snip snip snip taking
[21:51] christ completely out of our thoughts
[21:53] taking the very greatest help that we
[21:55] have so when you feel those worrying
[21:57] thoughts come put the scissors away put
[22:00] them away because yes we're going to get
[22:02] bad things to happen in their lives bad
[22:04] thing people are
[22:06] very very bad difficult things they will
[22:08] concern us that will weigh us down
[22:10] that's that's normal that is that's
[22:12] that's part of life
[22:14] but the devil wants to get christ out of
[22:17] our picture
[22:19] and when he does that we have nothing
[22:22] to keep our worry to keep our cares and
[22:24] concerns in proportion
[22:26] because christ
[22:28] yeah
[22:28] christ is great christ is the greater
[22:30] than any giant the devil can throw at us
[22:33] he's huge the devil can throw his his
[22:36] worst thing at us and next to god in
[22:38] this word the devil's giants
[22:41] a dwarf
[22:43] but if the devil can get by by worry to
[22:45] snip snip snip christ out of the picture
[22:48] we've lost our bases of comparison and
[22:50] the devil's bad guy is the worst bad guy
[22:52] there is we're all going to be running
[22:54] for cover
[22:55] because he's cut out
[22:57] christ from our own thoughts
[23:03] then the end of matthew chapter 6
[23:05] he says take no thought saying what
[23:07] shall we eat what shall we drink with
[23:09] all shall we be clothed my wife likes to
[23:12] remind me of that when i ask what's for
[23:13] supper tonight we shouldn't be thinking
[23:15] about that shall say
[23:18] for after all these things to the
[23:19] gentiles seek verse 32 then verse 33
[23:23] says but seek ye first the kingdom of
[23:25] god and his righteousness and all these
[23:28] things shall be added unto you
[23:31] if you think about how many
[23:32] what kind of things do we fill our minds
[23:34] with
[23:36] in the sermon on the mountain jesus is
[23:38] trying to reorient our thinking away
[23:40] from the world right here this kingdom
[23:42] and this day we've got the jews and the
[23:44] romans and here we've got the kingdom
[23:46] got democrats and republicans neither
[23:48] one of them are building god's kingdom
[23:50] but we might very well be listening to
[23:52] all those things that are getting us
[23:54] worked up about those kingdoms
[23:57] but the kingdom that god's building he
[23:59] wants rebuilding is within us his holy
[24:01] spirit within us and if we're having our
[24:03] energy drained by everything else around
[24:05] us
[24:06] that kingdom of god within us just might
[24:09] be hungry the holy spirit might be
[24:11] wanting some more food
[24:13] some nutrients himself
[24:15] worry has no value in fact
[24:17] brother branham says
[24:20] he's talking
[24:21] again this is a prayer line people are
[24:22] coming to him in the prayer line because
[24:24] they have needs
[24:25] he's not diminishing the needs
[24:28] he says now go believing go rejoicing be
[24:30] happy now look lady if god almighty can
[24:32] reveal your life you before this
[24:34] audience he certainly if he knows what
[24:36] was he'll know what will be is that
[24:38] right
[24:39] now don't worry
[24:43] he says don't if he says don't worry we
[24:45] should be able
[24:46] to do that it's not easy but we can't
[24:49] stop that worry hasn't got one bit of
[24:52] value to it at all
[24:55] worry doesn't have one bit of value to
[24:57] it at all just what would worry do any
[24:59] good
[25:00] but faith does do good
[25:03] so have faith
[25:05] then the message unbelief doesn't hinder
[25:07] god he says so
[25:08] if you were going to be shot in the
[25:10] morning at sunrise
[25:12] it's a pretty bad situation you're
[25:14] sketching out
[25:15] it wouldn't help you any to worry about
[25:17] it not a bit
[25:19] i
[25:20] i think if you would be shot in the
[25:21] morning at sunrise you would they would
[25:23] give you a nice catered meal that you
[25:25] would you could order you have a nice
[25:27] good meal as your last meal but if
[25:29] you're consumed by worry you wouldn't
[25:31] even be able to enjoy that
[25:34] worry is no good at all to us it only
[25:36] makes everything worse you can't do that
[25:39] it's no good to do it but
[25:41] what could faith do for you if you were
[25:43] going to be shot in the morning it can
[25:44] deliver me it's done it many times
[25:47] all the value there is is in faith
[25:49] believing god's word taking god
[25:52] at his word
[25:54] worry saps our energy why because then
[25:57] we're always living in the future filled
[26:00] with worst case scenarios
[26:03] and um like i said we've got uh that's
[26:05] something that
[26:07] a lot of us struggle with
[26:09] and this last year was doing some
[26:11] i was at the garage sale and i found
[26:13] this book
[26:15] it's called the worst case scenario
[26:17] survival handbook i thought this is
[26:19] great for anybody who's going to be
[26:21] worrying about things because it's got
[26:23] stuff how do i like if you were going to
[26:25] be somebody's
[26:26] be worried if someone's chasing me on on
[26:28] this roof somewhere how could i escape
[26:30] there's this chapter how to jump from a
[26:32] building into a dumpster this one had to
[26:34] jump onto a moving train it's got you
[26:37] covered it's got you if you could but
[26:39] that's what worry does it imagines all
[26:41] the worst things that could happen to
[26:42] you
[26:43] and that's and you're just fighting
[26:47] finding all these bad guys off all night
[26:49] long maybe never coming
[26:52] wasn't due to us anxiety in a man's
[26:54] heart weighs him down
[26:57] when we're looking at all the bad things
[26:58] that could happen and responding to them
[27:00] stirring up those thoughts it's going to
[27:02] weigh us down
[27:04] but a good word makes you glad
[27:06] and the bible is full of those good
[27:08] words that's why we say think upon those
[27:10] things that are true
[27:12] most of our worries are not true because
[27:14] they're not based in reality if it's
[27:17] honorable if it's a good report if it's
[27:19] commendable if it's pure think on those
[27:21] things
[27:22] a good word will make your heart glad
[27:24] and it might feel
[27:26] very mechanical at first you got this
[27:28] worrying thought come in there and
[27:30] put it out but put something else in its
[27:32] place it might feel very mechanical at
[27:34] first but keep on doing it because
[27:36] you're you're building new neural
[27:38] pathways new ways to be habitually be
[27:41] thinking it's going to be mechanical at
[27:42] first but feed on the right thing and it
[27:44] will change it
[27:46] be anxious for nothing be prayerful
[27:49] about
[27:50] everything
[27:52] there are two days a week when we
[27:53] definitely shouldn't worry
[27:56] yesterday because we can't do anything
[27:58] about it and we shouldn't worry about
[27:59] tomorrow either because it's not here
[28:02] what worry does it removes us from the
[28:04] present and the only time that we have
[28:07] to do anything is the present where it
[28:09] puts us either in the past or in the
[28:11] future neither place we actually are
[28:15] where he separates us from the present
[28:17] and while we're busy thinking about what
[28:19] might be happening somewhere else or
[28:22] some other time
[28:23] we miss out on the things happening
[28:25] right around us
[28:27] and i could remember
[28:29] a time in my life i was
[28:31] in i was doing my senior year of college
[28:34] in moscow
[28:36] and i was thinking yeah you could do all
[28:37] kinds of neat things there and we did
[28:40] but a lot of my time
[28:42] was consumed with worrying what am i
[28:44] going to do
[28:45] when i get back home
[28:48] could i be done with college what am i
[28:49] going to do what kind of work am i going
[28:51] to do that really took up a lot of my
[28:53] time and energy
[28:54] and i've got this letter my dad wrote me
[28:57] and i've had it here i guess it's been
[28:58] in my bible for like probably my
[29:00] goodness
[29:01] 16 17 years
[29:04] and
[29:05] he says don't spend too much time
[29:07] worrying about what you do when you get
[29:09] back it'll just sap your strength and
[29:11] faith
[29:12] and distract you from enjoying full of
[29:14] the opportunities of the moment
[29:16] from the lord
[29:18] that's what worry does
[29:20] it removes us from the all the things
[29:22] that are happening right around us that
[29:23] god is doing for us
[29:25] now we think god's not with us but god
[29:28] promised i'll never leave you or forsake
[29:30] you
[29:31] so if the god the devil's putting
[29:32] thoughts your mind god's not what god
[29:34] was with me yesterday he won't be with
[29:36] me tomorrow but the bible says he's with
[29:38] you right now
[29:40] ask the lord god please send me some
[29:43] little reminder
[29:45] that you're with me
[29:46] and if you ask for that
[29:48] be ready to
[29:50] be ready to find a little reminder as
[29:52] little as a text message from somebody
[29:55] as little as a an email as little as
[29:57] something as a card in the mail because
[29:59] those are reminders
[30:01] not not from sister so-and-so or brother
[30:03] or someone who sent that that's god
[30:06] showing that he's with you
[30:08] and god is with us but worry tries to
[30:11] remove god out of the picture and get us
[30:14] to live in a place that isn't even here
[30:15] yet
[30:17] i like the song that uh
[30:19] gideon
[30:20] sang when he called me up and his
[30:22] strength is perfect
[30:23] when our strength is
[30:25] is is gone
[30:27] i've been uh
[30:28] i've picked up a book i'd read some
[30:30] years back and i'm rereading it it's by
[30:32] a norwegian pastor
[30:34] named ol hallisby
[30:36] and he was a he lived from 1879 to 1961
[30:40] he protested the nazis spent several
[30:43] years in a concentration camp um did
[30:46] survive the war
[30:47] he wrote a book on prayer and his
[30:50] approach to prayer captures a certain
[30:53] paradox that our prayer life is at its
[30:55] strongest
[30:57] when we are most conscious of our
[30:59] helplessness
[31:01] he says i never grow weary of
[31:03] emphasizing our helplessness
[31:06] for it is the decisive factor not only
[31:08] in our prayer life in our whole
[31:10] relationship to god
[31:12] as long as we're conscious of our
[31:14] helplessness
[31:16] then we'll expect nothing of ourselves
[31:18] and therefore bring all of our
[31:20] difficulties and hindrances to god and
[31:22] prayer
[31:25] when we feel helpless we just see all
[31:26] the difficult the bad things around us
[31:29] we can
[31:30] that that's the prime time to worry
[31:32] i can do nothing everything bad's
[31:34] happening around me
[31:36] but and that
[31:37] he says another quote he says our prayer
[31:39] our helplessness becomes a new factor in
[31:41] our prayer life he says before our
[31:43] helplessness was the storm center of our
[31:45] prayer life it would either drive us to
[31:47] supplicatory cries of distress
[31:50] or it would stop our mouths so
[31:52] effectively that we could not find a
[31:54] single word
[31:55] with which to give utterance to our
[31:56] needs and the latter is often what
[31:58] happens when we feel so helpless that we
[32:00] can't even pray
[32:04] we say oh the situation's so bad all i
[32:06] can do is pray and we act like all we
[32:08] can do is pray that's the
[32:10] that's the last thing left in the
[32:11] toolbox it's not going to work anyway
[32:13] it's all we can do so let's just pray
[32:15] guys because we're getting ready to
[32:16] throw the white that's what it sounds
[32:18] like it's not like it's
[32:19] the hail mary right there's little
[32:21] chance of working but we do it anyway
[32:23] but that's completely reversed
[32:26] helplessness is the place it's perfect
[32:28] strength by perfect weakness old
[32:30] testament science out of weakness they
[32:31] were made strong god wants to get us to
[32:34] a place where we realize our weakness so
[32:37] then we can enjoy his strength
[32:40] that's the goal
[32:42] he never it's so good to emphasize our
[32:45] help helplessness is not a bad thing
[32:48] that's where god wants us to be
[32:51] very similar to what um brother brandon
[32:53] says in this message uh let his life
[32:56] story preach from here in toledo
[32:59] it says as that's the way it is as long
[33:01] as you're
[33:02] talking about fighting your own battles
[33:03] if someone talks about you and you talk
[33:05] back about them god can't fight your
[33:07] battle then because you're fighting it
[33:09] yourself
[33:11] but if you're helpless and you put your
[33:13] hands up then god didn't come on the
[33:15] scene that let loose let him do it just
[33:17] commit it to him the greatest weapon
[33:20] that i know of for a christian today is
[33:23] a committal to god
[33:25] that's the greatest weapon but it is so
[33:28] hard
[33:30] to let those needs come out of our hands
[33:33] oh lord
[33:35] i'll take care of lord please i'll do my
[33:37] best with a god god doesn't want us to
[33:39] do our best with our problems he wants
[33:41] us to give her problems to him because
[33:43] our best is never good enough for our
[33:45] problems
[33:46] our greatest strength
[33:48] our greatest weapon is a committal to
[33:50] god when you can't do nothing about it
[33:54] just commit it to him
[33:56] and god will take care of it
[34:01] the greatest weapon that i know of bears
[34:03] repeating
[34:04] of a christian today is committal to god
[34:07] when you can't do anything about it
[34:08] commit it to him
[34:10] don't worry about it commit it to him
[34:12] and god will take care of it
[34:14] and you know what there's always this
[34:15] thing
[34:17] there things sound great in theory but
[34:20] how does it go in in practice
[34:22] and i just want to remind you you know
[34:24] as you as
[34:25] as as your kids get older
[34:28] it's very you start coming to the i
[34:31] start coming to the
[34:32] realization that i can do less and less
[34:36] to to to change them
[34:38] at a certain when they're when they're
[34:39] little guys and gals you like to think
[34:41] you have a bit they still have the deck
[34:43] stacked in their hands and restaurants
[34:45] at the grocery store but other places
[34:47] you can do a lot to of cour you have
[34:50] control as they get older and older you
[34:52] don't have that lord
[34:54] i
[34:56] where we're going to go next lord we i
[34:58] need you lord
[35:00] and there's this theory in practice how
[35:02] do we go from one to the other
[35:04] but i was thinking about this you know
[35:06] what
[35:07] brother branham had a family too just
[35:10] kind of get some old uh pictures of him
[35:12] you know he had he was raising kids he
[35:14] was raising grant he didn't he didn't
[35:15] see his grandkids or did he i think he
[35:18] did yeah he had uh he was a grandpa he
[35:21] was a dad
[35:22] of little guys his dad of teenagers he
[35:24] had all that
[35:26] and here's a picture there when the
[35:28] brother george smith got in there
[35:30] but
[35:31] one of the
[35:32] the closer something is to your heart
[35:35] the harder it probably is to commit it
[35:37] completely to god
[35:39] to completely let let go of it
[35:41] and you know the the story that brother
[35:43] branham tells about how after they moved
[35:46] to arizona how hard that was on uh
[35:49] rebecca
[35:50] you know what this is this stuff to move
[35:51] from one place to another and brother he
[35:53] tells the story i'm just going to read a
[35:54] little bit here
[35:56] about how she's uh rebecca is there
[35:58] playing the piano playing uh he says she
[35:59] was sitting there playing a rock and
[36:01] roll boogly wiggly and um
[36:04] and sister mita see i guess she was
[36:06] learning this at a new friend's house
[36:08] but yeah you go to a new place you're
[36:09] gonna meet new friends
[36:11] and meet us i told her to stay away from
[36:12] over there see and she said well it's
[36:14] the only place rebecca is the only place
[36:16] i got to go to take music
[36:20] and then and
[36:21] i guess she just a few days after that
[36:23] her mother got after for something else
[36:25] and rebecca saster and that's not
[36:27] rebecca at all she just took off and
[36:29] slammed the door almost to knock the
[36:30] things off the hall that went to school
[36:34] and that's the situation that brother
[36:35] branham comes back to it back back home
[36:39] and
[36:40] he says becky never did that to me see
[36:42] when her mother said something about it
[36:44] she slammed the door and said you expect
[36:46] me to sit here and be a wall flower all
[36:47] my life and blame me she slammed the
[36:49] door and went out that was the devil
[36:53] and um
[36:54] brother brown just kind of goes on
[36:56] when she started that i said i took me
[36:58] to about an hour as i was kind of
[37:00] encouraged sometimes it does take about
[37:02] an hour to kind of
[37:03] process everything talk about things
[37:06] calm down and kind of talk about the
[37:08] issue at hand it took about an hour and
[37:10] it says mita
[37:11] take your hands off
[37:13] what that's my kid
[37:15] it's really hard to say the right things
[37:17] here but he's doing his best that's my
[37:19] kid it's my kid too he says if she was
[37:22] dying this morning you'd have to commit
[37:24] her to gone for her eternal destination
[37:26] why can't we commit her to god now for
[37:28] her earthly journey
[37:30] but that's my kid
[37:32] it's mine too
[37:33] now you can't take
[37:35] i can't i mean not say anything to her
[37:37] she says
[37:39] said i never said that
[37:41] we'll just quit scolding her and just
[37:43] advise her she needs a buddy and you're
[37:44] the one to be her buddy you and me
[37:47] or her parents
[37:49] that wasn't easy
[37:51] you can kind of see he's preached this
[37:53] committal to god he's preaches all over
[37:55] the place this is the greatest weapon
[37:57] when the rubber meets the road that
[37:59] wasn't easy
[38:02] it was really really hard they said we
[38:04] just got down on our knees
[38:06] and committed it to god
[38:08] and said i know she's 18 years old we'll
[38:10] be that in a few days and she and a girl
[38:12] that age will think about boyfriends and
[38:14] we've kept her in i never wanted to see
[38:16] her get married i wanted to put her in
[38:18] the office here and do the work i want
[38:19] to see her filled with the spirit and
[38:21] live like that and
[38:22] we all wanted that
[38:26] and i said well wait a minute we've
[38:27] raised her all we can and now put her in
[38:30] the hands of god committer
[38:33] and then when she does anything say
[38:34] becky darling mother don't want you to
[38:36] do that but i'm your pal i'll stick by
[38:38] you let her know that you love her she's
[38:40] going to get somebody to love her and it
[38:42] might be the wrong woman i said you be
[38:43] the woman that does the loving and we
[38:46] got down
[38:47] and committed to god and said we'd take
[38:49] our hands off it
[38:51] that afternoon she came in well i guess
[38:54] you're still saying i can't go over
[38:55] there and he said no i didn't say
[38:56] anything about that
[38:58] but you know mama wants you to go over
[38:59] there and i killed your daddy when you
[39:01] heard that boogie woogie music with that
[39:03] girl playing
[39:05] but we just committed to god you do what
[39:07] you want whatever you do will still love
[39:08] you
[39:09] and
[39:10] that's committal to god you know in his
[39:12] case he's able to tell the story pretty
[39:14] quickly afterwards that she came to the
[39:16] lord and experience with god god brought
[39:19] brother george smith their way and they
[39:21] got married
[39:22] but sometimes those things don't take
[39:25] don't happen so quickly but that doesn't
[39:28] change
[39:30] the principle that committal to god is
[39:33] the strongest power the greatest weapon
[39:35] that we have
[39:36] because when we put things in our own
[39:38] hands we're fighting the flesh-to-flesh
[39:40] battle a lot of times and it's not going
[39:41] to do any good whatsoever
[39:45] we just committed to god now sometimes
[39:48] i'm sure it's just
[39:50] we're all human sister me that might
[39:51] have gotten out brother branham somebody
[39:53] he had a hard time with uh with billy
[39:54] paul sometimes saying things
[39:56] it wasn't easy but just committed to god
[39:58] and yeah
[39:59] maybe if we try to take it back with
[40:01] your hands no we commit it to god it's
[40:03] god's
[40:04] that's um
[40:06] so it's this isn't a
[40:08] isn't it a glib thing of don't worry
[40:11] about things just just be happy and
[40:12] hopeful no it is it's very serious but
[40:15] take a look at the things are consuming
[40:17] our our worries our
[40:19] our cares our concerns take a look at
[40:21] them
[40:22] don't take a look at him too long
[40:23] because it just draws you right into him
[40:25] but take a look at him says whose hand
[40:27] is this best in
[40:30] this really good my hands am i doing a
[40:32] good job at this i'll look at your track
[40:34] record probably not look at it you know
[40:37] this is a really really big situation
[40:40] i'm really helpless to change the
[40:42] situation
[40:44] and when we can be conscious of our
[40:46] helplessness
[40:47] then we're most able to bring it to god
[40:50] and you know what prayer as soon as we
[40:52] can be so consumed by worry and caring
[40:54] and certainly it is really hard to pray
[40:57] it is really hard to pray
[40:59] but
[41:00] i like one of the things that this all
[41:01] hallows be mentioned in his
[41:03] book on on prayer he says prayer is just
[41:05] opening your heart to let god in
[41:08] and he used the revelation three the
[41:11] message of allowed to see in church as
[41:12] an example
[41:14] no man seeks after god on their own
[41:16] god's knocking on the door of the heart
[41:19] god's seeking us first
[41:21] and if god's seeking you first prayer
[41:23] can be just as simple as
[41:25] more help
[41:27] that is a great prayer if we can't say
[41:29] anything else open the door of your
[41:31] heart give god
[41:32] access take it lord i i can't do it take
[41:35] it lord come in come in and help that is
[41:39] sometimes we we gauge a good prayer by
[41:41] how nice it sounds but that is so human
[41:45] because god god looks god looks on the
[41:47] heart he just wants a heart that's open
[41:49] so that he can come in and move in the
[41:52] circumstance
[41:54] a committal to god
[41:57] casting all your cares upon him
[41:59] for he careth for you he cares for us
[42:03] but not only does god care for us
[42:07] he wants to do the caring
[42:09] for us
[42:11] too
[42:12] we say yes thank god that you care for
[42:14] us but i'm still going to carry this
[42:15] burden on my own no he doesn't he wants
[42:17] us
[42:18] let me worry about it
[42:20] and there's a like an old testament
[42:22] scripture that he that keepeth israel
[42:24] either slumber nor sleep
[42:26] there's a story told
[42:28] during the battle of london when london
[42:30] was getting blitzed every night and one
[42:32] lady said yeah i actually had a good
[42:34] night's sleep last night how could you
[42:35] do that
[42:36] hey
[42:37] god said he's going to be up watching
[42:39] over me there's no reason for both of us
[42:40] to lose a good night's sleep
[42:42] if he's he's going to do the caring for
[42:44] us as well let him there's no reason for
[42:46] both of us to be worried about it
[42:50] a lot of times though when we cast we
[42:53] have to make sure we we cast the right
[42:55] way
[42:57] we don't want to cast
[42:59] like a fisherman
[43:01] because when a fisherman casts his
[43:02] worries on the lord
[43:04] he reels them back in right
[43:06] he's not still there and casts them back
[43:09] out and it's still there and he reels it
[43:11] back in though when we cast our burden
[43:13] upon the lord
[43:15] we cast like this we just cast
[43:18] and let it be gone
[43:20] and the promise is
[43:22] he will sustain
[43:24] us it's important to cast our cares upon
[43:28] the lord and let him do the caring for
[43:31] us
[43:32] we quoted first peter 5 7 casting all
[43:35] your care upon him for he careth for you
[43:38] the importance of this
[43:40] is demonstrated by verse 8 because he
[43:42] says be sober be vigilant because your
[43:44] adversary the devil as a roaring lion
[43:47] walks about seeking whom he may devour
[43:50] if we don't cast our cares upon him and
[43:52] let him do the caring for us the devil's
[43:54] going to be roaring all kinds of
[43:56] negative thoughts at us and we're going
[43:58] to get caught
[43:59] it's important to cast
[44:02] all our cares
[44:03] on him
[44:04] and the promise is
[44:06] that he will
[44:08] sustain us
[44:10] he will
[44:11] take care of us and we have a high
[44:12] priest who's touched by the feeling of
[44:14] our infirmities
[44:16] and jesus uh
[44:18] and he would he would see a multitude of
[44:20] compassion all the people have been
[44:21] there all day long
[44:23] and because they've been with them for
[44:25] so many days he had compassion his i
[44:27] won't send them away
[44:29] fast unless they faint in the way
[44:31] that's the heart of the god who looks at
[44:34] our needs today also
[44:36] who sees
[44:37] our cares
[44:39] our concerns
[44:40] we say lord i need your help today
[44:43] don't you didn't send those people away
[44:46] fainting
[44:47] give me a little bit of encouragement
[44:49] today because if we can see that god is
[44:51] with us
[44:53] what a huge huge blessing
[44:55] that is
[44:56] he understands and he's touched by the
[44:59] feeling
[45:00] of our infirmities
[45:03] and like i said he might not take the
[45:05] infirmity away sometimes he does often
[45:07] he doesn't but the fruit of prayer
[45:11] is peace
[45:12] we cast our burden of the lord
[45:15] he will sustain us he does sustain us
[45:18] the fruit of prayer is peace now we
[45:20] don't have to worry brother branham says
[45:22] and scuffle and act like the rest of the
[45:24] world
[45:25] just quiet down
[45:27] what's the matter with the christian
[45:29] the spirit of the world today is
[45:30] neurotic but that's not the spirit of
[45:33] christ
[45:34] did you ever see him get excited about
[45:35] something
[45:37] just as calm as could be he knew exactly
[45:39] where he was standing
[45:40] oh what a blessed assurance it is just
[45:43] like a baby to lay your trust upon him a
[45:46] little baby is the most helpless
[45:48] creature there is
[45:50] so helpless but that's how we should be
[45:53] relying upon the heart of god like the
[45:55] heart of a mother who's going to take
[45:56] care of that little child
[45:58] can you understand the baby's cry most
[46:01] of them no not dad isn't very good at it
[46:04] but that baby keeps crying is that baby
[46:06] is that maybe a good prayer warrior no
[46:08] but that baby can certainly express its
[46:10] helplessness and its need
[46:12] we might be we might feel like i'm such
[46:14] a terrible prayer
[46:16] but we can just cry like the baby cries
[46:19] and god's heart goes to listen and goes
[46:22] to hear and takes care of the need
[46:26] what a blessed assurance it is like a
[46:28] baby to lay your trust upon him
[46:30] let him take all of your cares
[46:33] for he cares for you don't try to do
[46:35] anything about it he'll do it already he
[46:37] promised you would do it it's his
[46:39] business
[46:40] as long as you're fooling with it well
[46:41] then he can't have it
[46:44] but when you turn it loose and let him
[46:45] have it
[46:46] he will take care of it for you yes sir
[46:49] i like that with a perfect calmness
[46:51] the christian
[46:53] ought to
[46:54] have i just want to ask us today what
[46:57] cares
[46:58] what concerns
[47:00] what worries
[47:01] do we have on our hearts
[47:04] what kind of cares and concerns did we
[47:07] bring to church with us this morning
[47:09] i remember one time as a
[47:11] teenager i was in high school and i
[47:13] don't remember what i was i was
[47:15] concerned and cared and discouraged but
[47:18] all kinds of things and i came across
[47:20] the scripture verse casting all your
[47:22] care upon him for he careth for you and
[47:24] i started writing down the things that
[47:26] were causing me to be discouraged and
[47:28] dismayed and down sort of writing them
[47:30] down
[47:31] you get a list after a while what what
[47:32] kind of list did we bring to the bring
[47:34] bring the church today
[47:36] well after you did that just a lobster
[47:38] clasp for myself
[47:39] prayed about it
[47:40] scrumped it up and threw it in the trash
[47:42] can
[47:43] because i can cast it upon the lord
[47:47] one of the things that we bring i just
[47:48] encourage us take it to the lord in
[47:50] prayer and i'm not
[47:53] not going to
[47:54] go any further here but just maybe the
[47:55] musicians could come
[47:57] and we could
[47:58] play what a friend do we have in jesus
[48:01] he's never going to come and say oh are
[48:03] you struggling with that again
[48:05] is that coming up again why are you
[48:06] worried about that again haven't i told
[48:08] you so many times he doesn't do that
[48:10] what a friend we have in jesus all our
[48:12] griefs our sins and pains to bear he
[48:15] wants he doesn't just care for us he
[48:17] wants to do the caring for us too
[48:21] let him do it the greatest weapon a
[48:23] christian has is a committal to god
[48:27] what kind of things are in our hands
[48:29] what kind of things do we have our
[48:30] fingerprints on
[48:32] turn it over to the lord because he is
[48:34] so much better able to take care of him
[48:36] the promise is then
[48:38] the peace of god
[48:40] which passes all understanding will
[48:43] garrison will guard will fortify
[48:46] your hearts and minds
[48:48] in christ jesus stick out those all
[48:51] those bad thoughts put the stirring
[48:53] stick away don't be stir getting
[48:54] yourself all struck with the negativity
[48:56] it'll come watch tomorrow something bad
[48:58] is going to happen get that
[49:00] drop ink put in your mind don't stir
[49:03] drain the cup
[49:05] whatsoever things are true
[49:07] whatsoever things are honest
[49:09] whatsoever things are lovely whatever
[49:11] things are a good report
[49:13] think on those things
[49:16] our thoughts are like seeds
[49:20] what kind of thoughts do we usually
[49:21] begin the day with
[49:26] put the phone on
[49:28] right to the news feed put the phone on

[49:49] sell newspapers but this is reality let
[49:52] this be the first seed that's planted in
[49:55] your mind
