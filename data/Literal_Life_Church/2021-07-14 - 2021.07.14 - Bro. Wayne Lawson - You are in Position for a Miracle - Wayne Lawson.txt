========================================

brother ray erickson the church there true word tabernacle and bluffton and greetings to you brother paul and your family and amen want to say special thanks to the group that's come up with us tonight god bless y'all thank y'all for coming out on amanda and coming over here on a wednesday evening and amen we have something up on our heart tonight just a few little words of inspiration and lord just dealing with me as he's driving up the road just maybe i pray the holy spirit would have his way tonight amen how many would like to see the spirit of the lord move right into your situation into your need he's that kind of god tonight isn't he he's that kind of god let's just bow our hearts heavenly father we're so thankful tonight and we lord we all at your presence knowing that lord you're the god of abraham and lord you walked among them and you spoke with him and lord in even in a very troubling time that's when the angel appeared right at the door of the tent and lord right here in the end of the ages when the world is falling apart you've appeared among us again lord to minister the seed of abraham a life-changing word and we're asking you tonight father may you come into this platform and to this congregation of people lord they've set aside there's time lord they've dedicated themselves to come out to the house of the lord father i know that you have a portion for them lord so i ask you tonight that you would you would allow us lord to get out of your way that would not hinder you in any way lord but that you'll be able to speak to the need that's in this congregation lord and lord to them that would see the the video maybe even or live right now may you make your presence known there where they're setting and may lord you remind the people that you are the almighty god now we're asking you lead us lord take this meeting and use it for your glory we ask it in jesus name amen and amen and god bless you tonight and i want to invite you to your bible into the book of mark the 16th chapter i want to read for a text tonight and some things here that the lord had put on me uh back a little bit ago actually just was listening to a sermon and uh there's some inspiration came on me and in a certain need actually in the church and sometimes when you you preach something like that and you think well it's all finished you know that was the inspiration and then the holy spirit just starts adding some things to you and so tonight i want to continue something that i've been personally looking at and in the book of mark the 16th chapter and i want to read here from the the 15th verse now this is the great commission or the last commission that jesus gave the church you know he had gave one commission prior to this but this was uh the last words that he spoke brother brown would tell you that there in figuratively there was air under his feet while he was saying these things so it was the last thing that he had to say to his disciples here in the earth and he said unto them go ye unto the world and preach the gospel to every creature you know i think it's amazing no matter how times change or opinions change that reads the same today as it has always read isn't that beautiful go yeah unto the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth is to be baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe for in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover god bless the reading of his words you could be seated tonight and if i would take uh for a title tonight i'd like to speak to you just for a few moments uh upon this thought that you are in position for a miracle that you are in position for a miracle you know we're living in a season of time when people almost don't believe in miracles anymore that it's an age that doesn't believe in miracles doesn't believe that god still works in miraculous ways somehow man has become of the opinion that because times have changed somehow god has changed but one thing that we find that is definite from the scripture is that the lord says from the book of malachi that i am god and i change not so god has an unchanging way with an unchanging nature though he does change his mask though he does change his veil that he's behind but he never changes his nature he never changes who he is or what he can do because he always remains the almighty god to think tonight that we are able by grace to go through the name of jesus christ to approach the god that created the world we can speak through through the name of our lord to think tonight that we have the ability to approach this kind of god in a message of the paradox in 1963 brother branham will tell us this he's going to preach the message paradox and does a good job in describing what a paradox is he said now according to webster a paradox is something that seems incredible but it's true therefore a paradox when it could be the same as a miracle a paradox is when something that seems like that it couldn't be he says the knowledge of a human mind is altogether incredible but yet it's proven to be true now a miracle would be the same thing for a miracle cannot be explained a miracle is something that happens and you cannot explain it that makes it a paradox it's incredible but yet it's the truth isn't it amazing something that is just incredible to the human mind but it's just true and it's it's an indisputable truth it's an it's it's a it's an unexplainable truth but yet it's true and now people today a lot of modernists believe that the days of miracles are past and they don't believe there is such a thing a miracle but yet i believe that the world is full of miracles i believe the paradox is constantly again in the message paradox brother braham says i believe that every born-again member of the body of christ is a paradox in themselves i believe that each one of you methodists and presbyterians and lutherans you that had experienced never had experienced the baptism of the holy ghost it was in some formal church didn't even believe in a genuine new birth but now you've received the baptism of the holy ghost it is a perfect example of a paradox isn't that beautiful that the prophet uses you and your experience with god as a perfect example of a paradox you might not have knew this but i hope you take this home tonight you are a perfect example of paradox amen the world it's incredible to believe this but it's absolutely true that the gospel of jesus christ can thoroughly change an individual that it can change the nature it can change the soul of an individual even change its habits its choices its decisions because god can do it it's incredible that it can happen but it remains to be true because it's a paradox it is a new birth or brother bam says a perfect example of paradox because something has happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone that could look at you and know what a paradox is it is a miracle give me a little bit in my side box here and i'll adjust it as is needed uh unless this happens you cannot be a christian there must be a paradox for you to become a christian because no one can change a spirit in a man and give him a new birth outside of god god alone is the only one can do it it's a miracle how that god can take a man's thinking and his ways and his life and everything and change it from what it was to what it can be amen what he can make it isn't that beautiful amen sitting here out here tonight maybe some of you will say well brother wayne i'm not what i want to be but you would have to agree to say we're not what we used to be you you might not know me the potential fully of what god's going to do with you and you might say well i'm not happy with who i am i'm not what i want to be but then you have to go back in your life and you say but i'm certainly not who i was or what i was then what made you something different was not just a an intellectual conception but it was a change that god brought to you perfectly describing what a paradox is is it's incredible that there's been change but that change come through the supernatural god bringing you this paradox brother madam will say it like this he says see he if you're identified as a believer with believers but until someone is regenerated or born again he says now he's talking about a man he said i'd advise a boy to never marry you all heard brother brown tell a story about a certain family bringing a boy to brother branham and it was talking about the parents were saying there's something wrong with him that he's a good boy he goes to church with us he said but but he's not able to forgive people he has a hard spirit he ain't able to forgive he's kind of stubborn he he's and brother brown begins to discern him he said well i'll tell you he said y'all come from a german people and and uh you you have a certain background and it's it's a stubborn thing he said but you but you and your family he said notice how that god got a hold of you and that all changed one day he said but now this boy though he comes from your family he's never had the change you had he said until he does get that change he'll not make a good husband to any woman he'll ruin some girl's life he said but now what he needs is an experience with god he needs a new birth and that new birth would be a paradox amen that's that's what is the change of a life that's what makes a good wife that makes a good husband amen is when somebody has a paradox let me let me give you uh let me give you a little word tonight just so you don't forget this you're never going to be an angel amen you're never going to be an angel you're always going to be a human and brother braham gave us a shocking moment when he said to me he says that you have a man on the outside who said he's got a sticky nature of a kakabur and it'll be with you to the body change is that right amen so you're always going to be a human and with the human failures is going to going to complex your life and there's going to be troubles always amen but if there's ever been a new birth and there's a way to correct that nature there's something on the inside that'll say y'all that's not right and you'll apologize and you'll go to an altar and you'll repent and you'll say will you forgive me but if there's nothing in you to ask forgiveness then there's something wrong with your nature if there's nothing in you to admit when you're wrong when it comes to the word of god there's something wrong with the nature amen but if god ever gets a hold of an individual there's something inside of that individual that will control their emotions to the word of god it'll control their opinions to the word of god it is completely a paradox to see an individual humble themselves in the age we're living in but if anybody ever had the new birth they know that it will call amen a person to come to that place with god amen it's a paradox now amen i don't know if you have a separate knob on this side on this side but if you can't give it to me and i'll control it from this volume button amen do you see what it is it's a paradox now back in the days of moa brother madam says see he says now it was a hard thing for noah he says see but in a great intellectual age that he lived in he was trying to tell people by a word of god that something how it was going to rain now you talk about paradoxes that was a great paradox in the days of noah and in the time of law he lived in an absolute scientific age now brother branham explains to us how they have things then that we don't even haven't even got to now amen and and the world was destroyed somehow right and the prophet teaches us it was atomic warfare that caused the rain to come down upon the earth so there was a great advanced civilization in science they were advanced amen and when you look at the bible it says as it was in the days of noah now that wasn't speaking about the angels or the burning of the earth such it was in the days of abraham but speaking of the immorality and speaking of the knowledge and the science of the days of noah and to think as it was in the days of noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man so in a wicked and adulterous age an evil age when evil is upon the mind of every person in such an age like that the bible tells us that noah found grace in the eyes of the lord isn't that awesome that noah found grace in the eyes of such an evil time he found that grace in the eyes of god in other words god could speak to noah that's where real grace is in your life by the way it's when god comes to an individual and he speaks to you concerning your need or your situation had god not spoke to noah noah would have been like everybody else in that age but because god gave him grace god spoke to him and gave noah a message of grace in an age of destruction and because he found a righteousness in noah god was not going to destroy the righteous with the wicked and he made a way of escape amen i'm glad tonight to know that god never changed his way and to know that in an age when the world's about to fall apart that once again god by grace as it was in the days of noah he sends a message of grace to a generation if we had not received a word from god the bible said the blind is leading the blind and they're all going to the ditch so we're not trying to lift ourselves up and say look who we are but we're trying to lift up a message and say thank god for the grace of god that come down in our lives had he not come into your life where would you be sitting this morning what what kind of church would this be today what kind of ministry would would i brother paul have today but because of the grace of god amen we have a message in this hour to believe and give us a way of escaping a time a time of judgment that's upon the earth amen but god did something a certain way in that day that he's going to do in this day and you know what he did he sent message of noah unscientifically proven into a scientific age can you imagine noah only having the word of the lord in the face of science in the face of all their instruments all the man had was the word of the lord amen he had come in contact with god and he knew the direct will of god for the earth he knew destruction was coming he knew the rain was going to fill the earth he knew he was going to build an ark and he knew all of that by revelation and couldn't prove a thing to nobody they either had to believe him or not believe him he either had to believe the word or they didn't believe the word noah could not prove to them by their intellect what he was saying was the truth but god did it that way because god was going to do it again in the last days he was going to send a message of grace to an age of evil and he was going to send a messenger with an intellectual message in the middle of an intellectual age and he wasn't going to be able to prove his message by the intellectual thoughts of man but he would have the word of the lord my when i think about god he gives us a 20 20 mirror that we can look backward today our vision should be 20 20. everybody can say that right amen a rear view mirror is 20 20 is that right so we ought to be able to perfectly see what's coming by what has been we ought to be able to see the reflections of prophecy and the age that we're living in now no a preacher of righteousness preached the message 120 years and they didn't repent and they didn't believe but god had somebody he knew would receive that word god would never send a message unless it was a believer to believe it oh my i think it's amazing that god actually god actually had them amen he actually had them to build that ark and i've always marveled at this amen that god gave noah the measurements before noah ever preached his first sermon he had his measurements he knew exactly who would get on that ark he knew exactly how big it was going to be god knew the number of animals and he knew the number of humans that was going to believe that word because they were already ordained to be believers in the generation that they were living in and i'll tell you this if god has ordained a man and a woman to believe this word amen you will receive it by the preaching of the message of the hour it doesn't matter how many intellectuals it doesn't matter how many scientists could stand and say i don't believe it's true it makes no difference to a believer because they have come in contact with god and they know god is a marker of a paradox and that's what no one knew no one knew a paradox was coming because he had met a god of a paradox and he knew it was incredible but he knew his message was true so he preached that message and he preached it to unbelievers and he preached it to believers and he preached it to skeptics and some days he preached it real loud and some days he preached it real soft and some days he sung about it and some days he beat drums and talked about it but the message never changed amen it doesn't matter whether it's high or low or whether it's soft or loud it's the message of god and it's your true word and the age that we're living in this message will take you in a rapture amen god ain't changed his way he had everybody that got on that ark had to come by noah now that the people that age didn't like it because they didn't like noah they didn't believe the messenger so they didn't believe the message and they didn't want to get on that ark because they had to come to that man to get on there isn't that something that's the same spirit that's in the age we're in amen well i've been told for years amen well y'all just believe it if somebody is going to be saved they got to believe this man william branham well amen you don't really know what we teach much by saying that then because we believe there's different classes of people by the bible we believe there's a foolish virgin we know there's people that'll make it there who actually never even was a new birth but they will do it because they were good to the bride it's written in matthew 25 until there's different classes of people that's going to be in heaven because the blood of jesus christ amen can cover who he wants to amen but he made a way and if you're going to be in the rapture in the last day you'll not get there any other way than the message of the hour you'll have to come by a prophet if you're going to get into the rapture of the church where did noah stand he stood right at the door he preached his message from the door and you came by that door or you didn't get on the ark amen i didn't write the bible i'm just responsible for preaching it he said they had to come by noah and the door of this age is the message of the hour it's christ and there was a prophet standing there and if you want to get as you're not going to get there otherwise you're not going to get where you want to go i don't know about you all but the world is falling apart and i do not want to stay in this layout to see you i do not want to be here when the tribulations begin to fall i want to be standing in the grace of god in such an hour like the time that we're living now think about this just a moment amen ask yourself this who went in the new world after the flood who went in the new world who went into the world after the judgments was gone and the water was off who lived in that new world whoever got on that boat amen so a step into the boat was a step into another world a step into that boat was a step out of judgments into the grace of god and if you're ready to get out of the judgments of laodicea come on and step in with the word of god of your age and let the grace of god cover you with the power of the word and the age that we're living in i don't have enough time tonight to get into all the details of noah but i'd like to pull this point out of this he done it by the word of the lord he told him by the word of the lord that's all he had but according to god that's all a man needs he needs to know the word of the lord i don't need to know whatever doctor teaches about the book of matthew i do not need to know what every assembly thinks about malachi 4. i've got to know what does the lamb think what does the word say and there we will abide and stand upon the word because there is where your power is hey man i i know in the last days a lot of people are caught up in in a lot of things and i can't help all that but amen some people say well brother wayne wouldn't some denomination be okay well it's according whether you believe the message or not if you believe a prophet he said flee it like the plague it's the mark of the beast according to brother branham he said rome has two churches catholics and protestants two churches amen catholics and denominations there's a and the daughters of it and the same system is operated by the same antichrist spirit but if god's going to do something in your generation he's going to send a prophet he's going to send the word by prophet and that prophetic word will be the deliverance of every individual that hears it amen and it will be what it is whether i think so or you think so or anybody else thinks so amen the message of the hour is not subject to opinion it's not subject to the judgments of what man says it is or what they say it ain't its message of the hour has already been certified and vindicated as being the word of god in the age that we're living in my i believe that we're standing on a rock brother paul amen amen that's what noah or it's what paul what david was praying that god would put him on a rock it would have been quite a hard thing for noah to preach that kind of word to that kind of people but noah did it isn't it beautiful that noah suffered a reproach for the word of god but he did it because he had been in contact with god and people thought noah was foolish but honestly ask yourself who's full of you ask yourself who's fuller are you going to be people say to me all the time so will y'all follow a man i have to stop and ask him about what presbyterian church are you from anyhow or what baptist what baptist church are you affiliated with or what what denomination are you affiliated with if you ain't done your homework denomination comes from a group of men deciding what doctrine is and they approve that doctrine by their fellowship and you're brought into that doctrine by this trinitarian baptism and you're actually baptized into the fellowship of a roman church whether you know it or not that's the truth according to the bible but if god's going to bring a word he's going to do it through a prophet and that prophet will speak for god then there is a group of people on the earth that's not following a man we're actually following the pillar of fire that led moses out of the wilderness and put them in a promised land oh church i don't know if we have the picture here i guess we don't have it amen but there's a picture brother random of the pillar of fire over his head hey man i want you to if you ever look at that picture i want y'all to know something that picture is not with brother branham with a pillar of fire under his arm it's not with a pillar of fire under his feet amen the pillar of fire is over his head because it was what was leading him it was what was directing him he come out and said the first seal he said the horse rider i thought it was i thought it was christ he said but he stopped me in the back room and said it was the antichrist do you see that brother branham was not asking a group of men what it was but the angel of the lord was stopping him telling him what the revelation was so who are you following them this evening we have not followed a man we have not followed cunning devices of fables we are eyewitnesses of the majesty of the word of god that is coming to the age that we're living in my he told them by the word of the lord my he preached to souls that were in prison he was a righteous preacher he preached to them but they repented not but he preached it anyhow he preached the word anyhow because it was the truth and it remains to be the truth do you see what it was amen it was a paradox it was a paradox when the rain began to come incredible but true but noah had seen noah had seen it 120 years before it happened noah's seen it 120 years by vision and contact from god and when he saw it and and believed it noah began to preach it and to them that heard the word and believed it saul they literally saw the flood by the hearing of the word isn't that awesome that they saw it by the word then they they didn't see it but their natural lie they saw it by the word because they had believed what was being preached uh something really changed up here on the platform guys it went south up here amen do you see what it is you see amen that it rained and it was a paradox now you see if god can took his word and can perform a paradox he can perform a miracle any man that's born of that same spirit performs miracles it's an easy thing for him to believe in miracles because he is a part of god now it's coming back because he is a part of god now a son or daughter of god not by denomination not by creed but by the hand not by a handshake but by birth that you have died to your own intellects to be born of the spirit of god and you're a paradox yourself how that you've been changed from death unto life out of your innermost being is a new creation in christ this is not a historical god god is still doing this god is still causing this do you see what he's saying to you if you're a paradox it's not hard for you to believe in a paradox but if you're not a paradox it's hard to believe in paradox if you're a paradox yourself it's not a trouble to believe that these bodies are going to be changed before they hit the ground to think that the generation we're living in that there is a people that's going to change their bodies while they're yet alive my sometimes i just sit down and look at the world and the chaos and i think about the old grave out there and i'm reminded of a promise amen where paul said some of you shall not sleep but some shall be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye amen now think about that because you're hearing that but i cannot scientifically prove to you that's true i cannot intellectually prove to you that that's going to happen in the age we're living in but i can say what paul said by the word of the lord i say unto you by the word of the lord you see what paulie and paul preached the paradox of rapture he preached it by the word of the lord you see noah preached it by the word of the lord paul preached it by the word of the lord in other words what paul was saying was not absolutely uh reading scripture verbatim paul was not just reading isaiah or he wasn't just reading something that malachi said but paul read a little bit of isaiah and he read a little bit of malachi and a little bit of genesis and he read a little bit of ezekiel and god gave him a revelation that the things that had happened was going to culminate in a future age and there would be both a resurrection and a rapture take place at the same time you see he's seen that by revelation and preached it by the word of the lord he said by the word of the lord some of you shall not sleep but you shall be changed there's coming up generation that will not hinder this paradox there's coming a generation that will believe into the place of a paradox taking place in their life you say by the way what have i got to do to get in the rapture you got to believe that god is you got to believe that god can and that god will and he's doing it by his word my to think by the time they saw what noah saw it was too late for them to get in and today we preach rapture but we preach it by revelation and that revelation is to those who can believe that revelation has already begun to be open for paul said for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise do you see what it was noah was preaching his own paradox do you see what's happening today there's a people preaching their own paradox amen brother paul you're preaching your own body change you're prophesying your way into a new body can you imagine that that we are preaching our new body word by word we are prophesying what is about to take place in the age and i cannot scientifically prove matter of fact my body's getting older my body's getting weaker everything that we say is absolutely unscientifically true but by the word of the lord there is a change taking place amen there is a word that is prophesying over our lives by revelation do you see what it is it's a change when the word of god is spoken there is a change there is a significant change insignificant to the world significant to god when jesus sat under the tree and he cursed it no change at all wait till tomorrow by the word of the lord he cursed the tree the next day they sing the change look at look at the prophecies of the word how the la's going to sink don't look like a change does it but when it happens it happens when it takes place it manifests itself by the word of the lord see see three things are going to happen how many realizes the shout of first thessalonians 4 is the message of brother branham amen it's the first thessalonians 4 is the shout it's the message so you can see then the first portion of rapture is the word of the lord it's the message coming to the church and if you're a paradox you receive it as a paradox prophecy over your life do you see what it is it changes the cycle from a death cycle to a rapture cycle from the death cycle that sitting in the garden of eden by a word unbelieved by one word being fail the whole earth was plunged by one woman's disobedience everybody was plunged to death but at the end time there's another eve who's not disbelieving but believing and if disbelief could take all of that away from a person then couldn't believe in the word give it all back can you imagine this is an age of restoration where god said i shall restore saith the lord now you like your bible as well as i do first corinthians says that this is actually a mystery of what god's going to do now we know being a mystery it locks up the rapture right locks it up to the last age because if it's a mystery how many knows the bible predicts that god won't do anything until first he sends a prophet amos the third chapter the seventh verse surely the lord our god will do nothing until first he sends a prophet not even a rapture he seals the rapture no matter through the ages they could pray and fast they could desire to see the change but it was not the season of change but the season of a rapture would come with a prophetic word and the word and the rapture would be synonymous coming together because it takes the word to break the chains to change to bring paradox it takes the word in amos the third chapter it says that there has to be a prophet in revelations 10 the end of the bible it says the mighty angel will come out of heaven with an open book in his hand is that right that open book would be the word of the lord to the age and dispensation we're living in which would happen to be the seven seal book of redemption from the beginning of time and would be unfolded in your season that you're living think about this god is releasing this not in somebody else's age but in your season in the age of rapture there comes a message of rapture amen to think that that change is taking place by the word that is spoken over you in revelations 10 it tells us that that book would not be a different book than the bible i believe we can say that because it said the mystery of god which would be revealed which has been spoken to the servants the prophets so in revelations 10 7 it predicts it will be an opening of the bible the mysteries of the bible would become made known in that season then it would be the word that revelations 10 7 would be bringing to the church and if it's the word it can only come through a prophet amen i think that's established we all believe that amen but it's beautiful because there's a prophet prophesied for this season in malachi the fourth chapter it said behold i sinned unto you elijah before the great and dreadful day of the lord some people try to place that back in the days of jesus but acts 3 20 gets in your way because it said the bibles must receive jesus until the restitution of all things so we know it did not take place in the days of jesus but restitution was in the future restitution would be under the prophecy of joel the second chapter i shall restore saith the lord everything that has been taken shall be given back to the church again so malachi 4 would be a restoration ministry is that right it would be an hour of grace to the church to restore something back to perfection if you ever think about malachi 4 and how it's written i know you know your bible so i'm not going to turn and read but you know the bible says i want you to remember the law i want you to remember moses on mount horeb i want you to remember that but i'm going to send you elijah isn't that beautiful i want you to remember moses but i'm going to send you elijah how many ever studied moses's time when he come off of the mountain with a veil on his face if you if you if you watch the scripture he said a prophet like moses go back and read and find out in the unveiling of god when paul's talking about it in 2nd corinthians 3 he's talking about moses being veiled with a veil over his face but you know that don't happen on moses his first trip off the mountain it happens the second trip because the first trip moses has been in the presence of god receives the ten commandments he comes off of the mountain and actually under anger because of the shape the people is in moses broke the first word by throwing the tablets of stone and the word was broken into pieces now let me ask you who can recover what had been broken who could god wrote it but the written word that god had given from his own finger was now laying broken on the ground tell me what presbyterian could put it back together what lutheran could place it put it back together it had been broken and who could restore it but the one that wrote it but the bible said moses went back upon the mountain for the second time and he prayed unto god and said god if there is grace oh i love that word grace if there is grace restore unto us lord restore your word to us lord and god wrote that word again exactly like it had been in the beginning and moses come down under a veil in that beautiful mosaic second trip down that's where the veil was and in the end time god would send the same spirit that was upon moses but it would be under a veil of elijah ministry amen watch this not two different men but the same spirit restoring the word moses and elijah by the authority of god's word listen church this message we're believing ain't just some mamsey pamsy idea come out of some kentuckian this is the word a prophecy for the age that we're living in this is rapture and anointing this is the power of god this is how you're going to get out this is the way you're going to break out of the age you're living in you want to break out of this age this word is here to deliver you to make a way where there is no way prophesying there it went prophesying from a place amen where there has been nothing prophesying from it to think tonight amen that there it is in luke 17 he said he would restore the son of man would return is that what he said in ephesians 1 how many loves how paul writes it he said let us pray for wisdom and revelation is that what he said pray for wisdom in revelation william branham comes along and says pray for revelation more than anything else pray for revelation paul said pray for revelation why did he want you to pray for revelation he said that your eyes would be open that you may receive the spirit and the wisdom of god the revelation and the spirit of him the richness of wisdom and revelation and the eyes opening to think when god opens a man's eyes hey man think about when he opens your eyes you say bro if my eyes would come open what would i see have you ever thought about them boys walking in luke 24 who was walking with the resurrected christ and had no clue who was talking to him but when their eyes were opened they knew that was him a stranger become resurrected christ because the word he was preaching had revealed who he was my when i think about it today i think when their eyes were opened there was a revival their hearts began to burn because of the revelation of the season they were living in think about this people looking for revival everywhere they're trying to build churches they're trying to build assemblies and there's only one revival that's left it's a revival of the word of god in the season and this word will produce a pride's revival it might not produce the biggest churches it might not produce the biggest crowds but it'll produce the most people in the rapture i i know how the message preachers we all feel the same we're not as interested in filling up the pew as we are filling up heaven [Applause] brother brahm said i'll tell you what he said i i'm going to preach the word of god he said because i don't want to be responsible for a bunch of illegitimate children he said i would rather meet god without one convert is a bunch of illegitimate children amen that's the truth because you know what he said this word would produce he said this word will produce an acts 2 church how many knows he taught it he said in acts 2 tongue talking hollering screaming blabbering church of the living god it's the only kind the word can produce you say brother wayne i tell you people just get too fanatical for me isn't it amazing that all of a sudden worshiping god has become fanatical in this age you can scream your head off at a ball game it's not fanatical you can rock your shoes off in a rock concert and it's not fanatical but when you see that god has answered the prayer in the message of the hour in order to raise the roof on the church of the living god to know that the resurrected savior has come into the age we're living in we are not here by ourselves we are not here tonight on i hope so maybe so but the resurrected paradox god is in the midst of the church in this hour he said preacher what are you what are you really talking about let me tell you what i'm talking about in the days when jesus come off of that mountain riding that white mule you all know what that was that was zechariah 9's prophecy they wondered what zechariah meant all those years behold thy king cometh riding on the photo what does that mean who's going to do that how's that going to happen but that morning they saw jesus on that mule and that was the answer to zechariah's prophecy that was the answer amen to a virgin shall conceive that was the answer to a messiah was coming and when they saw the answer they realized the vindicated word had come to their city my the screams the shouts the hallelujahs because the answer had come and they saw the answer as king are you traveling with me they saw the answer as their king the answer of malachi 4 is this message the answer of luke 17 is this message amen the answer to first thessalonians is this message and because it's the answer we have invited it to be the king to set the order of the church to set the order of our lives to set the church in a place to set the church in a position for a miracle do you see this look look it by the word of the lord you line up behind this answer you're going to see a miracle you line up in this message the way a prophet saw you get back in line line up there's a rapture in front of you amen there's a change that's about to take place there's a power that is coming back in the church again an anointing to change lives to change hearts you say preacher what do we need to do this is not working up this is not beating it up it's getting the line of god take your position in the word and watch the god of paradox do in your midst oh yeah oh yeah you don't think he can but he can because he is the god of paradox and you have met things in your life that you can't explain and you've met this this disappointments and troubles amen i'm going to come home to you in a minute amen you've met things you can't understand and you wonder sometimes who are we really following if we're coming into these kind of problems if these kind of situations but read your bible it'll give you a perfect vision amen moses who is an undisputed prophet of god the pillar of fire which is the son of god was leading the church and it led them right to the red sea it led them to the red sea they was run to a place that looked like there's no way out brother paul i know as a pastor you've come to those places look like there's no way out there's no answer you can give whatever you say is going to be wrong whatever you do it's going to be wrong amen but the god that was with moses is standing with you brother the god that was with moses is with this message in the hour we're living in moses got up there and began to whine around to god he began to whine a little bit like all of us do oh god and we're in trouble and looks like i've let the people wrong we're in this problem what are we going to do and it was like god just started talking to moses said hey dried up boy have not i sent thee have not commissioned me have not i anointed you have not i told you what the word of the lord is in this age amen why you cry to me speak the word of god that this people might go forward i tell you brother paul amen the god that was speaking with moses is the one that's standing with this ministry in the end time and he's prophesied to us if you'll just speak the word this mountain's gonna move this valley is gonna pull back this ocean's got to move out of your way by the word of the lord when this ocean started moving then people saw they saw the moon they saw them moving are you hearing me they saw the movement of god they didn't go running backwards they didn't go running backwards and say well i don't know if we are to get off into that or not the way of heresy is your escape when is the last time you got out of your little realm of comfort and worshiped god when's the last time you stepped out of that dignified belief system you got that you're not going to crack a smile you're not going to amend the word and you're just going to sit there and hear things bless me preacher if you can amen listen it's time that the church sees the movement of the holy ghost and the way of heresy that's the way that i worship the god of my father this tongue talking acts 2 38 church is still alive today i know they're going to beat us i know they're going to say don't you preach that way but you've come too late i've already been put in the fire i've already been tried i know that my god will stand in the hour of battle well red sea started part they didn't step back and say what's that no sir those were children of abraham and they knew the god of paradox was due to show up anytime and when he showed up they went and got in the water and i tell you the beauty of it god wouldn't even let them walk get their feet wet dried the thing up told them to get walking brother paul and they started walking out across there two million of them now now i ain't left my subject it was a long line it was a long line and some of them were still out in the middle of the water with the waves on both sides wondering did god forget about us and there they are in the middle of a paradox wondering is god forgot about us no god he forgot about you you're already in the paradox you're already in the message you are a paradox yourself you're here you're a paradox god gave you that paradox and here you sit tonight hey man they started getting out on the other side i got to think about this the other day i said 2 million a line of 2 million people what if you did fall in the back of that line it might get dreary back there by yourself you can look over and know them egyptians are back there somewhere and all your friends is over there and you start hearing weird noises stuff you can't even see hey man weird noises start drifting back somebody in the back of the line asks about hey what's going on up there and the word traveled up to the front what's the noise about a word travel back somebody's already broke through the other side and the shout and the victory up there on the other side you say preacher what's all the noise it's the sounds of victory somebody's already broke through they broke through the realms of unbelief they broke through this dimension of laodicea and they see the promises of god being fulfilled in their age listen i believe tonight i believe there's been some breakthroughs in the house of god amen you say preacher with my breakthrough coming stay in line there's a breakthrough in front of you stay in line god's gonna break you out or whatever you're in if you'll stay in line i'm not just preaching to you tonight i think i have a word for you amen literal life stay in line there's a paradox out in front of you god's about to change some things god's about to bless you in ways you don't understand but you've got to stay in line there's a miracle right in front of you so brother paul when's it going to happen paul ain't going to perform it by the way when's it going to happen brother wayne ain't performing it we're following the god of paradox who keeps his word it's up to him of time date and season if you'll stay in line and break through it's in front of you already which brings us to a great point it's not behind you oh brother i tell you back when we use that other church it's not behind you i tell you brother paul before you made that move we were really doing good it's not behind you that's the devil taking you away from what god's doing now amen the god that you're wanting is not behind you he's in front of you god never goes backwards he always goes forward come on church speak the word and go forward let's march to the victories of god it's time to go it's time to march it's time to go forward forget what's behind you forget the troubles forget the problems forget who's right and who's wrong forget all about it what difference does it make we're going in a rapture [Applause] listen we'll talk about it over there who's right and wrong what does it matter now you're going to sit down and let the devil catch you the man said don't stop don't stop for nothing don't stop for nothing don't stop and reason don't stop and weary come on you're that little woman and you got the elijah's you got elijah's staff in your hand you got that dead baby laying on the bed it's up to you to not stop it's up to you to not turn to the left or right get in line there's a resurrection in front of you god don't have an hour higher order than a prophet you don't have a higher order the importance of the revelation is to see his presence and that's what's necessary if you know your god his presence with you what difference does it make what disappointment we come to or what trouble we come to or what bully we run into now i'm getting old enough now i think i've wrestled with every bully in the message traveled to enough places and seen enough things i've been around left controlling spirits every bully in the message every bully everybody don't want you to preach the gospel they'll tell you where we are to only play tapes now nobody should preach well you do me a favor get that in the king james version and help me out i don't want to be a smart aleck i mean to be true people present it like it's a teaching of brother branham it's hogwash it comes from the pits of hell william branham didn't teach it the bible don't teach it and anybody that does is teaching false doctrine you said brother wayne that's on the internet i know it is and i hope everybody hears me out there you can hear it now or later i love how brother brown says things he said it's a little good to be scorched now it's burned later by the one you better be careful now that devil better be careful i know where i'm standing bullies bullies in the end time well you can't have these you can have these kind of services you can have your singing you can't have your music well then wouldn't god make you god i look brother donnie was down to meet one day he said now we got popes over music you got to pass your music buy some pope before you can play it say preacher boy you're in hot water no i'm really not in hot water they've already tried to bull me i won't bowl see i have a disposition i'm a little bit like david i'm new to the routine if you don't have nothing to lose it makes you a very scary person what are you going to take from me i don't give everything up [Applause] what are you going to do to a man that don't have nothing i have already forsaken all i have been bought and sold by the word of god if i die i'll die by the word if i live i'll live by the word amen but by the grace of god i'll stand on this word as long as there's a breath in my body i will preach the message of the hour to the young and to the old because this is the truth by the grace of god bullies in the end time reminds me of a goliath amen that wanted to stop the whole stop the whole camp amen just one giant stopping everybody isn't that something get one loud bow stop everybody you know what brother brown said he said that loud mouth spoke up the wrong time he said fell on the wrong ears and david didn't let it rest david come running off of the hill now y'all y'all know i don't have time to preach on david and you know the story of david so let's get the point when david come off of that hill he he done told by all of the tribe by all the army even by his own king that you can't whip this man but he had been in contact with god a paradox he had been in contact with the god of paradox and when he come running off of that mountain he did not walk in the battle he didn't crawl into that battle i love the bible don't you those men trained soldiers wouldn't even get off their their rears on their feet to go back and beat this goliath they were trained men but couldn't move in faith at all but here's this little snotty rose david who come off of that mountain with a revelation that he was going to defeat that giant and he went running into the battle fanatical loose cannon crazy fanatical man but he was in love with the god of paradox knew god would take care of the battle you see what was going on as david knew he knew that god would back it up do you do you see the age that we're living in people say to us they say to us you know how could this happen well i'll tell you what brother branham told us he told us that the god of paradox will make it happen i'm gonna have to leave here and get into this other area i'm gonna get too long with you but i'll tell you this it was david who knew that joshua had stopped the sun it was david who knew the ground he was on had been taken away from giants previous to that time he knew the ground he was on possessed things that was from another age i was studying there one time really struck me amen where jesus said hey man if the if the if the people won't praise me rocks are cry out in their place and i got to think about the testimony of rocks you know and how they testify i went all the way back to the garden and i preached on a little while but it really got me this this point of the testimony really got me i got to thinking about the rocks that was laying in the creek the day david went down there and i thought i mean if you if you if you could have give them them boys a voice what would they have said five stones laying there i meant i mean if you could have given them a voice he was standing in the place he was standing in the same areas of where joshua had defeated all those giants previous you all know the bible said that god rained hailstones out of the heavens literally pummeled rocks out of the heavens and killed giants in the days of joshua i thought about them stones has been laying there since the days of joshua and they've been waiting on a hand that would pick them up amen and let them go back to work again i thought oh my when david threw that rock that rock was a giant killer to start with it just needed somebody to believe it and throw it and i think of the age we're living in there's been a prophet who was out in front of us and he killed the giants of this age and he left all these revelations laying here for the church in this hour not you're not that army sitting on the hill you're the davids of this age you're the david's face in the glass of this age and we're not gonna lay down and let it goliath take our place in this line can you imagine somebody trying to come up you're standing in line for a paradox and he's trying to push you out of the line i don't care how big he is i don't care how much strong or how real he is he has no ability to remove you from your position that god puts you in you're in position for a miracle think about this this line i i just i just was listening to the paradoxes of the one in chicago and brother branham said that his disciples were with jesus and jesus was there one day feeding the 5 000. and he said the disciples came you know of course told him they didn't have enough bread to feed him jesus said don't worry about this and they brought him five loaves he took them five loads and fed five thousand now that's a lot of people to feed i i guess i need to do the statistics sometime maybe brother randy you could help us out about how many loaves of bread that would take or how many pounds amen but do you know that jesus according to the scripture whether brother branham taught it he said jesus had them disciples to line up and he said he literally broke the bread and hand it to a disciple and that disciple would disperse that and the next one in line he'd break the bread now brother ram tells it he said see what was going on is he was giving them all the same portion he would break it when he broke the bread an angel would go plant the seed it would come to harvest they would pick the harvest they would go down and they would mill the grain they would make flour they would go break bread and then bring it back before the next disciple got up there he said brother wayne that's incredible but see it's true because they wasn't he wasn't giving them uncooked bread he was giving them cooked bread how did they get cooked bread because god was creating a miracle he was doing a miracle it was a paradox but brother brahm said he did it to every one of them he didn't just create a bunch of bread and teal to go pass it out but they were in line and they were walking up to jesus and he was breaking the bread and giving it breaking the bread and giving him brother brahm said here it is he's jesus the same yesterday today forever now brother branham's a powerful preacher he took that simple story he said now you are the next one in line he said are you going to go down and fish and try to catch your own fish or would you like a portion of this would you like to go make your own bread or would you like a portion of this you're in a line to receive a paradox from god do you see the bride has a portion coming in this age do you see that brother branham actually tells us in the church's book that you have a turn but the logos has a bride and in your turn to be manifested this is your age this is your turn you're the one in line you can look back and say well david did and paul did and moses did moses is not in that line tonight david is not standing in the line it is you that's in the line and you're in the presence of jesus christ now what are you going to do with it are you going to take what god is trying to give us or are we going to try to make up our own mind and how this goes and how's this go you're in a miracle line with god the paradox has been broken off and given to you a bright portion of the third pool you have been given a commission to speak the word of god you've been given a commission to prophesy to the giant to prophesy to this age when david took his portion he prophesied over that over that giant and began to say to that giant amen i'll make you like the bear in the line i'll feed you to the birds i'll cut your head off and haul you back he began to prophesy and david literally ran and met his own prophecy i wonder tonight i wonder if you could prophesy against that that's in your life he began to ran into the battle he was the one that was in line do you see where you're standing right now you're actually in the line the prophet of god said you have come in contact again the same as the first adam's bride do you see what she was she was confused on one promise how many knows what the promise was eve was confused on one promise see that brother brown makes it simple you don't have to keep up with a lot of things she's done wrong she got confused on something one thing she got confused on it was on that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he said it was confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever she failed on that one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face now people let's call for his name of course he is his bride she has come contact again by the same thing think about that and we are not confused we have been proven vindicated to us that he is the same now when a person ever comes in contact with god if a person ever comes in contact with god brother braham said he will satan will never be able to twist that man away from god it's a preacher i i i don't i'm in a hard time right now let me let me say something to you very carefully if you've ever come in contact with god there's nothing they'll ever be able to twist you away from this you said how could that be how how could it be when brother braham said that you weren't even born yet you said well brother wayne how in the world could he say that how could job be talked about by god and the devil before the trial ever come god told that devil he'll stand up to you because he had confidence that job would hold to the word no matter the temptation and god has confidence in this church he has confidence in this bride let me let me say something real clear to you tonight brother paul god's got confidence in you as a minister and he called you to this message because he called you before the foundation of the world brother said how could god trust you with this message because he called you before the foundation of the world before the devil was created god created sons and daughters of god to withstand the devil in this end time so you're not just trying to do something you've literally been anointed to do this you've been called of god to stand in this hour you see it was a temptation it was a temptation lifes and trials it was even tempted of job and even jesus even jesus when he was speaking in his day can you imagine jesus the lord jesus brought up job and said have you not heard of the patience of job what was his patience he believed that god was going to change something he didn't know why he was going through this he didn't know what this trial was about he didn't know what this problem was but he knew god was real and he knew he knew that he had met the requirements of god by sacrifice and brother man said his patience was waiting on god he was waiting on god to fix it do you see the bride you're in line and there's disappointments and there's trials and there's people trying to twist you on every manner but god's got confidence that you was going to hold before he put you here now there's a security i'll be just a couple minutes i'm closing there's a security that's sitting here tonight in this bride that you sometimes you fail to remember these things but they're in the scripture and i think it's our job to remind you that the predestination of god is not a doctrine it's not some little gimmick or something we're doing to to cause people to be have a pep rally the predestination of god is an absolute truth of the sovereignty and the divine will of a god who can change things to his own will and when god predestinated a church and said there will be a church without spot or wrinkle paul said that we might have a church without spot or wrinkle brother madam said you are the church without spot or wrinkle a church is not coming you're that church you're a perfect paradox of god you're torn but you're the bride persecuted but it's the word god already knew you would make it through it do you see brother brown said he couldn't get a word from god he said but the devil couldn't move him either and you know i i don't want to get deep in this but you know when god won't talk to you that's when the devil does you know you said well brother wayne i can't hardly admit the devil talk to me well brother branham did he said when his daughter was dying he walked out of the hospital he said he walked out on the front and he said the devil began to talk to him he said god wouldn't speak to me concerning it and the devil began to say to him well you've done this and you've done this and you've done this but god can't even help you he said i was about to say well if he can't do that then i can't he said before i could get it out something rose out of me and i said the lord giveth and the lord taketh blessed be the name of the lord do you see he wouldn't be twisted away from it now when god ordains a person to be at a certain place let me ask you this is there anything too hard for the lord is there any situation that's too hard for the lord then if god says you'll be in a certain place at the end of this you will be where he put you when they crawled on that boat and jesus said we're going to go to the other side he crawled in there and laid down and went to sleep they were fishing to go through the greatest battle of their life and jesus could sleep through it you know why he could sleep through it because he wasn't worried about the destination he was not troubled he was not back there with a glass of whiskey and and some xanax wondering oh how's this going to end up god was not shook up he knew exactly what was going to happen he knew a storm was about to strike them one they couldn't get through one they couldn't survive one that they had no control over and when they come to the end of their rope they were going to remember that there was a power that was in the ship that was able to stop every storm he knew they would call on him at the right time because he was already in the boat can i read you a quote brother branham says it like this in the message of god go away jesus he says it in 1963 he said the real believer no matter what no matter how thoroughly satisfied how many real believers we got here how many real believers you a real believer no matter what they are thoroughly satisfied they're thoroughly convinced because the life that is in them has already become christ the life that is in a believer has already become christ say it with me the life that is in a believer has already become christ he said preacher you're off on a lamb i'm not the scripture says it's no more me but it's christ that liveth in me the life has already become you say what difference does it make see if he's your life how are you going to separate a man from his own life that's why paul could say this paul could say this he was not talking about some abstract people paul was talking about believers look what paul says in romans 8 for them he did for know he also did predecimate to be conformed to the image that he might be the firstborn among many brethren them that he did predestinate he also called to them because he justified and whom he justified he also glorified what shall we say to these things then if god before us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us how shall not he freely give us all things he freely give us all things i'm only talking about a few things tonight he give us all things he how who can lay anything to the charge of god's elect for if he that justify who is he that condemneth it is christ that died ye rather that is risen who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or pearl or sword who shall separate us brother adam shows the reality of that scripture it's christ is already in you how can you separate it now how can you take it out it's already in you take a you take a glass of water and drop another drop of water it's already in the bottle now separate it and once christ comes into you you're not going to separate it by trials by temptations by problems nothing i love how paul says it and i and i i really feel this on my heart or i would have quit 10 minutes ago there is nothing that is coming paul said that has been able to separate the church from christ paul is telling you there's nothing that can separate you and i love to think about these things because there's nothing that has been and you've been through a lot of things if you've ever heard me use the scripture just forgive my ignorance i've got to use it tonight it don't matter what we have been through it hasn't stopped us from coming to this point in our life no matter what we have come to brother paul is driving up the road coming to this meeting i've used the scripture a lot but the spirit of the lord struck me so strongly concerning this point nothing that you have been through has been able to stop it think about the years think about the trials think about the discussions and the ministry and the in the almost seem like total wipeout and this is going to get it and this was designed and trapped but nothing has been able to this point to take us and remove us from the place that god has put us and to think amen brother paul said in here tonight do you think that's without tribulation that's without fence that's without someone criticizing you can't sit up front and not be shot at and beat out and troubled in every place but the bible already said that it wouldn't be able to separate us from the love of god it wouldn't have the power to do it satan don't have that kind of power quit letting your imagination run away with you he's not that powerful he's not that great he's not that awesome but my god on the other hand he's an awesome god he's a god of paradox and he's able to change every situation and in that moment when you think it's over the red sea opens up and in that moment you think it's finished he steps on the bow of the boat and says peace be still in that moment you think everything is going to be destroyed he makes a way where there is no way the dead are raised in the are healed and the blind see because he's a god like that that it's easy for me to look at what has been and then look at you tonight and tell you nothing you're going through is going to stop this it's easy for me to be able to tell you i do not have to be a prophet or son of a prophet but i can tell you if the devil ain't got you yet he ain't going to get you at all because he's thrown everything he's got cove had come and here we are kovalev has hit us and he tried to shut us down and tear us apart amen divide the churches and the people but here we are here we are the devil's got us on his hands amen we've got the platform and we're not giving it back we're going to be the final voice to a final age yes sir nothing that has been or can be so i can easily say there ain't nothing coming do you see by the word of the lord i can prophesy to the church there's clear waters in front of us there's a rapture in front of us there's a body change in front of us i don't know what else is there but the god a paradox is walking with us and he'll take care of it as we approach it if you will just stay in line look at that just stay in line you are in a position for a miracle won't you come to the platform tonight if you would the musician you you're in position for change i say unto you by the word of the lord now if you don't want to come it's

thank you tonight for your grace upon this meeting lord i welcome you in this meeting because we have been asked to be here lord father this pastor has invited us to come here and speak our heart and father we believe you to be the god that can change everything i'm instantly reminded lord of a prophet that was standing in hattie wright's home two boys laying over there laughing at a prophet father there was a mother there that got your attention [Music] she was sitting in the right chair she was in a position to see a miracle maybe there's a mother sitting here tonight sitting here agreeing with the word the god of paradox circling this building right now situations and homes lord [Music] i don't understand them all i see things with my natural eyes lord that's completely unexplainable but you're god and we submit our beings to you and we ask you now lord may you move in this congregation of people may you bless this pastor father father for them lord that are sitting here tonight then if you can feel the inspiration of the word lord and there's something in their heart lord i pray you would touch him father give him a special grace tonight we committed in your name so brother wayne i've been suffering a long time these things in the bible have been written for your example a little girl 12 years with an issue of blood but she broke through she touched the master 12 years is not too long if you're in the presence of him georgie carter was over nine years laying in a bed but when a prophet come in the room she was in position for parallels maybe you're sitting here tonight you're in that position you need god you need god to move miraculously in your life won't you just invite him to your pew won't you invite him to your situation so by the way i need that kind of god tonight i need to move on my behalf there's a sea in front of me there's a mountain father we commit them to you lord you see the needs we ask it in jesus name brother paul would you come here [Music] in this [Music]
