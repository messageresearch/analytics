[0:12] jesus took him all away
[0:22] jesus took them all away
[0:25] and he heard
[0:31] thank you lord
[0:33] amen love him so much tonight appreciate
[0:35] his presence in our lives let's turn if
[0:37] you would to joshua chapter 22 and i
[0:40] would like to say uh thanks to those who
[0:42] helped put together sunday's gathering
[0:44] fellowship it was a great time
[0:46] and we appreciate
[0:48] sister margaret arranging the food and
[0:50] all that appreciate mark i think helping
[0:53] with her coordinate the cleaning and
[0:54] everything up after and before
[0:56] all the guys and girls that helped him
[0:57] we just appreciate it so much everything
[0:59] just went so smooth and most of all just
[1:01] the time to bond a little bit i really
[1:04] enjoyed that and also just to get closer
[1:06] some have been desiring that so it's
[1:08] just a great time to do it and i just
[1:09] appreciate those times of fellowship uh
[1:12] matter of fact in in light of that i
[1:13] just i was thinking if we didn't have a
[1:16] youth meeting this friday which we don't
[1:17] we just have it every other week we
[1:19] don't have one this friday right brother
[1:20] jared
[1:21] i think i think it's next week so
[1:24] those who want to gather friday night um
[1:27] my wife and i usually if we have it open
[1:30] we go to cracker barrel friday nights i
[1:31] wasn't inviting you there but i was
[1:33] saying after that
[1:35] you know if you wanted to gather at the
[1:37] church here we'd do some
[1:39] just some singing and also just uh i
[1:41] thought we listened to that that day at
[1:43] calvary it's a little less than an hour
[1:45] that the message brother preached that
[1:47] day at calvary because this is good
[1:48] friday and commemoration of that and uh
[1:51] so maybe about 7 30 here for those who
[1:53] want to come out and i'll serve lord
[1:54] supper after that after we listen to
[1:57] listen to that service we'll just have
[1:58] uh i'll have that prepared and we'll
[2:00] serve the lord's supper to those who
[2:01] want to come friday night and just do
[2:03] what jesus said that he said to remember
[2:05] my death and remember what he done we're
[2:07] looking forward to the resurrection
[2:09] sunday can you say amen to commemorate
[2:11] that and to
[2:13] certainly means more to us than an
[2:15] easter bunny
[2:16] can you say man matter of fact has
[2:18] nothing to do with an easter bunny or
[2:19] easter eggs but we we hold in our hearts
[2:22] the real meaning to it and so you're
[2:24] welcome to invite those to come sunday
[2:26] with you as well and to be a part of the
[2:28] service but those who want to come out i
[2:30] thought we'd do that friday i know um i
[2:32] think ike is gathering with a few of the
[2:35] ones of the musicians a little earlier
[2:36] than that here but we'll just do that
[2:38] about 7 30 somewhere there
[2:41] on friday night 7 30 and those who want
[2:43] to come out or certainly will listen to
[2:45] that message is a great message a
[2:47] prophet preached on that day at calvary
[2:49] what it means to us and what he's done
[2:51] for us through that and what it means to
[2:52] us today
[2:53] and how we are thankful for god's
[2:56] sacrifice that he made for you tonight
[2:58] that has to become real to you
[3:00] without it without that that
[3:03] act of our our lamb
[3:05] uh we just wouldn't have any hope for uh
[3:08] for anything eternal can you say amen
[3:10] and him to taking care of the sin
[3:13] question in our life settling this in
[3:15] question and each of us have to have
[3:16] that settled if he hadn't went to
[3:18] calvary there would have been no victory
[3:20] for us that way so
[3:21] we'll just remember that those who want
[3:23] to join us with us we'll do that i'm
[3:24] going to read in joshua chapter 22
[3:27] and this is a portion of scripture here
[3:29] i'm just going to continue on families
[3:32] blessed families
[3:33] part 8 but this is a portion of
[3:35] scripture i've been pondering on for
[3:37] several weeks
[3:38] and moving through the scriptures and
[3:40] talking about the different areas that
[3:42] talk about families and how families are
[3:43] blessed i wanted to i've been just
[3:46] looking at this didn't preach on it yet
[3:48] there's a certain section of scriptures
[3:49] here in joshua 22 that's been
[3:52] a bit mysterious to me
[3:54] and just been praying about it so we may
[3:56] we may not get to all of it tonight
[3:59] next wednesday we can pick it up but i
[4:01] wanted to see what let you know what i
[4:03] was thinking why i was pondering this
[4:05] set of scriptures so i'd like you to
[4:06] just think deeply with me if you would
[4:09] and read together in joshua 22
[4:11] and verse 24 and of course some of you
[4:13] may not know the setting of what this is
[4:15] here at the end of joshua's life as the
[4:18] tribes have all come into their promised
[4:20] land and their inheritance
[4:22] and i might say that
[4:24] if you read through joshua you would see
[4:26] how many times the word families is
[4:28] mentioned
[4:29] because all the inheritance is divided
[4:32] down to
[4:33] heads of tribes the tribes and then down
[4:35] to families each family had some a
[4:38] portion that god had given them and rode
[4:41] out for them and that they had to go and
[4:42] fight and take that i think that's neat
[4:44] because i think every family has a
[4:46] unique thing that god wants to do
[4:48] through their family matter of fact i
[4:50] encourage every family to pray together
[4:52] if you're a small family or big family
[4:54] whatever if you're one in your family
[4:56] you should all pray and say lord what
[4:58] have you put me on earth to do and what
[4:59] do you want my family to accomplish for
[5:01] the kingdom of god
[5:03] god's given you a portion of himself to
[5:05] fulfill in this age and i think that
[5:08] should just be a priority you see that
[5:09] all through the book of joshua's the
[5:11] families and the
[5:12] just find their inheritance and settle
[5:14] down in it and fight for it and it's
[5:16] just a wonderful picture
[5:18] but we'll just start here in verse 24
[5:21] and if we have not rather done it for
[5:24] fear of this thing
[5:25] if we have not done rather done it for
[5:28] fear of this thing saying
[5:29] in time to come your children might
[5:32] speak unto our children saying what have
[5:34] ye to do with the lord god of israel for
[5:38] the lord hath made jordan a border
[5:40] between us
[5:42] and you ye children of reuben and the
[5:44] children of god ye have no part in the
[5:46] lord so this is the children of reuben
[5:49] the tribe of reuben the tribe of gad and
[5:51] they are speaking back to the rest of
[5:53] the tribes in
[5:54] an issue that they've addressed
[5:57] and they're giving an answer as to why
[5:59] that they are setting up an altar that's
[6:01] what they had done they they were not in
[6:03] the promised land but now they were
[6:04] asked by joshua to go back because
[6:06] originally they were supposed to be on
[6:08] this side of jordan they weren't
[6:09] supposed to come into the promised land
[6:11] they didn't want to come into the
[6:12] promised land and so now joshua says to
[6:15] head back and when they head back they
[6:16] set up this altar but
[6:18] the principle in scripture is when god
[6:20] sets up one altar there's only one
[6:21] provided place of worship that types
[6:24] today there's only one place that every
[6:27] man can come that's the place that
[6:28] worship is received and that's under the
[6:31] shed blood of jesus christ that's the
[6:33] only place that's not accepted anywhere
[6:35] else except under his shed blood when
[6:37] you have that principle when somebody
[6:38] begins building an altar another altar
[6:40] besides the one god's chosen
[6:42] everybody got really upset about it and
[6:44] this was their answer verse 24 again and
[6:46] if we have not rather done it for fear
[6:49] of this thing this is why we set up this
[6:50] altar it's out of fear
[6:52] and saying in time to come to your
[6:55] children might speak unto our children
[6:56] and say what have you to do with the
[6:57] lord of israel for the lord hath made
[6:59] jordan a border between us and you ye
[7:02] children of reuben and you children of
[7:04] god ye have no part in the lord so shall
[7:06] your children make our children cease
[7:09] from fearing the lord therefore we said
[7:11] let us now prepare to build us an altar
[7:14] not for burnt offering and not for
[7:15] sacrifice we weren't we weren't
[7:17] replacing the altar of god we weren't
[7:19] bringing it for any sacrifice so notice
[7:21] an altar now without sacrifice
[7:23] but that it may be a witness between us
[7:25] and you and our generations after us
[7:28] that we might do the service of the lord
[7:30] before him with our burnt offerings
[7:32] and with our sacrifices and with our
[7:34] peace offerings that your children may
[7:37] not say to our children in time to come
[7:40] ye have no part in the lord
[7:43] therefore said we that it shall be when
[7:45] they shall should so say to us or to our
[7:48] generations in time to come that we may
[7:51] say again behold the pattern of the
[7:54] altar of the lord which our fathers made
[7:58] not for burnt offerings not for
[8:00] sacrifices but it is a witness between
[8:03] us and you so now they give the answer
[8:06] here is the altar not for offering but
[8:08] for a pattern of the real altar
[8:11] an altar that looks like
[8:13] the real thing it looks like something
[8:15] that i want to have something that
[8:16] resembles it and that was their answer
[8:18] let's pray heavenly father
[8:20] lord bless the word tonight
[8:23] inspire it to his father we pray and we
[8:25] just pray that you received
[8:27] our hearts lord in our worship and
[8:29] praise to you i pray father that this
[8:31] teaching tonight would help us to
[8:33] understand
[8:34] how families can be blessed and how each
[8:36] one no matter how large or small they
[8:38] are but lord they can catch the
[8:40] revelation lord what it is to be a
[8:42] blessed family
[8:44] and lord jesus even our children here
[8:46] and young people here that will have
[8:48] family someday
[8:49] may they catch these nuggets lord may
[8:51] they catch these things by revelation
[8:53] for truly someday that they will get
[8:55] married they will have children and
[8:56] they'll be in charge of a home
[8:58] themselves
[8:59] oh i trust lord that they would have a
[9:01] home that honors god
[9:03] i trust that they would you'd put
[9:05] something in their hearts that someday
[9:07] when i have a they say someday when i
[9:09] have a home i want to have a home that
[9:11] honors jesus christ and lord put that
[9:13] vision in their heart and may they catch
[9:15] these nuggets i pray we just commit this
[9:17] service to you and all that's said in
[9:19] the name of jesus christ amen amen god
[9:22] bless you shake somebody's hand before
[9:23] you take your seat tonight god bless you
[9:25] each one for coming out
[9:29] now it's just been looking at these
[9:30] scriptures many weeks
[9:32] and looking at this
[9:35] desire to put up an altar for the
[9:36] purpose of uh in future generations that
[9:40] their children uh would not be made fun
[9:42] of and their children would not come in
[9:44] contact with the children that were in
[9:46] the promised land and they they uh were
[9:50] persecuted in a certain way or maybe put
[9:52] down and what part have you with us in
[9:54] other words are you a part of us or are
[9:56] you not a part of us
[9:58] and so i was looking at saying it just
[10:00] seems like the right thing it seems
[10:02] so right and even after they said this
[10:05] to the rest of the tribes they said
[10:06] we're fine with that we're pleased with
[10:08] that
[10:09] you're not setting up another divisive
[10:11] altar somewhere else for people to be
[10:13] swayed to or worship at another altar
[10:16] but you seem to be doing this for the
[10:18] right reasons and at all face value it
[10:21] seems like uh that's why it's such a
[10:23] mysterious set of scriptures even up to
[10:25] today just looking at it it just seemed
[10:28] like especially with the tribe saying
[10:30] this is such a pleasing thing this is a
[10:33] this is fine this is no problem to have
[10:36] this altar just as a pattern of the real
[10:38] altar it seems so right until the tribes
[10:41] even said well this is fine we're
[10:42] pleased with it that's fine so the
[10:44] families in these two and a half tribes
[10:47] are thinking of their children they're
[10:49] thinking of their kids now
[10:51] that in itself is not wrong i think that
[10:54] parents and families should be thinking
[10:55] of the children i think when they teach
[10:57] their children everything we do as
[10:59] parents we should be thinking of not
[11:01] just the present but the future
[11:04] we have to have a multi-generational
[11:06] vision we have to be looking to the
[11:08] seeds that we're planting in our
[11:10] children can you say imagine
[11:12] uh we have to we have to think in terms
[11:14] of not
[11:16] even the correction we give having the
[11:18] correction with the teaching to not just
[11:20] correct but to
[11:22] get especially as they get older to show
[11:24] why we're correcting why what's the
[11:26] principle behind the correction why they
[11:28] want to know some days especially when
[11:29] they get young teens why am i being
[11:31] corrected like this why are you saying
[11:34] this to me why do we believe this way
[11:36] why why is that wrong or why is this
[11:38] right and so there's a there's a
[11:40] teaching that goes with it and uh to to
[11:43] be able to explain those things why
[11:44] because you're affecting the future
[11:46] decisions that are made when they're
[11:48] young can affect affect the future
[11:50] and every true parent should be looking
[11:53] at a child a lot of times it hits a lot
[11:55] of them they'll think uh they'll think
[11:57] very wild at life and they'll be wild
[11:59] themselves and do wild things and then
[12:01] they'll have some babies and some
[12:02] children and they'll come up but once
[12:04] they start to get a certain age then
[12:05] they start to think many times a lot
[12:07] more mature that wow my i got a kid here
[12:10] and they're going to go someday they're
[12:12] going to leave my hand someday and i've
[12:14] got a real responsibility here to set
[12:16] the direction of the way they would go i
[12:19] don't want my kid to be a a menace to
[12:21] society i don't want my kid to end up in
[12:23] jail you know i i want to give him a
[12:26] good life and so even even people out in
[12:28] the world different places they begin to
[12:30] think more mature that way we come in
[12:32] the realms of christians and believers
[12:35] then then we realize that it's even
[12:37] deeper than that we don't want to just
[12:38] make good kids for society but but
[12:41] there's a there's a goal in our lives
[12:42] and that is ultimately i want christ to
[12:45] be in my children and to be the center
[12:47] of their lives
[12:49] and whatever i can whatever environment
[12:51] i can provide them for the right church
[12:53] the right young people the right place
[12:55] the right teaching i want to expose them
[12:58] to all the best teaching i can give so
[13:01] that christ can come in their life and
[13:03] they can make him the center of their
[13:05] life and have the holy ghost can you say
[13:07] amen and so we think about the future
[13:09] that's thinking about the future it's
[13:10] not thinking about the present thing
[13:12] it's it's looking to the future i don't
[13:14] knock these parents here in these two
[13:16] and a half tribes thinking of the future
[13:18] and what their other children are going
[13:20] to make their other children feel like a
[13:22] lot of parents feel that way it's that
[13:24] how do i well you know you could really
[13:26] go into a subject right here of the
[13:28] whole thing of how parents um
[13:32] i got to say this right now i got to
[13:33] really say this right but this is really
[13:36] a good subject and i am not getting into
[13:38] it tonight but the whole subject of
[13:40] parents
[13:41] and wanting so much to make everything
[13:44] right for their kids and defending their
[13:46] children and when they get involved in
[13:49] other children sometimes my a lot you
[13:51] can see a lot manifest and come out of
[13:53] the parents not just the children
[13:57] and this is really good because they're
[13:59] talking about uh what happens if these
[14:02] my children get with these children they
[14:04] say things and well you better watch it
[14:05] sometimes certain things are said to
[14:07] your children because you know we're
[14:09] going to do certain things to make that
[14:10] right and do all this thing and there's
[14:12] a certain healthy protection over your
[14:14] children that all of us have that i have
[14:16] can you say amen
[14:18] uh but then there's there's an overboard
[14:20] i think the thing that takes place where
[14:21] you begin defending things that are
[14:23] completely wrong
[14:25] in your own children i had a parent tell
[14:27] me when i first started passing said my
[14:29] my your my kid is accused and said the
[14:32] other kid did this thing and it's acting
[14:34] like a um what they call it a pit bull
[14:37] they were calling another little boy in
[14:38] the church of pit bull
[14:40] and uh he's just acting that was the
[14:42] name they gave it i mean it's just this
[14:43] kid's out of control you know he's
[14:45] biting people and he's doing things
[14:47] behind the scenes that he shouldn't be
[14:49] doing and he was the kid was i wouldn't
[14:51] call him a pit bull
[14:53] this was a good brother and sister and i
[14:55] didn't want to call their son a pit bull
[14:57] but this family wants he's a pit bull
[14:59] and you need to deal with it and you
[15:00] need to do it as pastor and
[15:02] they were telling me what to do what
[15:04] anyhow and so they were going to an
[15:06] extreme and so now they are pushing me
[15:07] to go extreme to deal with this pit bull
[15:10] in the church
[15:12] and i wouldn't do that you know matter
[15:13] of fact they they quit coming to church
[15:15] for a long time because i wouldn't deal
[15:17] with it like they wanted me to deal with
[15:18] it
[15:19] that's not a good thing that's always an
[15:21] evidence of something happening on the
[15:22] other side as well
[15:24] it's kind of like when brother graham
[15:25] says the deacon corrects some parent for
[15:28] the way their children is acting he says
[15:29] if they quit and stop coming to the
[15:30] church he says you can see there's a
[15:32] problem there in the parents
[15:34] there's some there's some problem there
[15:35] not that there wasn't a problem with
[15:36] their kid to be corrected but there's
[15:38] something problem when someone has a
[15:40] problem with being corrected by the
[15:41] deacons and so uh i'm not getting into
[15:44] that tonight all right but this is this
[15:45] brings out a whole opens up a whole can
[15:47] of worms that these parents out of their
[15:50] desire was thinking of what happens with
[15:53] when these children from the promised
[15:54] land come through later and and are with
[15:57] our children we don't live in the
[15:59] promise we we don't live in that land
[16:02] we're on this side of jordan and so they
[16:05] were thinking about how their children
[16:07] would be treated and so this is one of
[16:10] those places in scriptures friends that
[16:12] we would desire to know the mystery
[16:14] behind it how many has been here sundays
[16:16] and hearing that
[16:18] believers desire the mystery behind the
[16:20] scriptures we want to know the mystery
[16:22] behind the parables we're the ones
[16:23] sitting at jesus feet saying i know you
[16:25] told us the parable but what does the
[16:27] parable mean
[16:29] amen is that your desire and this is one
[16:32] of the set of scriptures that i'm still
[16:33] praying about because i want to see what
[16:35] does what does this whole type mean of
[16:37] parents on the borderline of jordan
[16:39] never
[16:40] fully went in themselves and now but
[16:42] they want to set up an altar so that
[16:44] their children are protected here and
[16:46] and everybody knows that we are we serve
[16:48] the same god so later on we find uh
[16:52] at face value we look at and see this
[16:54] altar that was built to the pattern of
[16:56] the true altar and so
[16:58] there
[16:59] they said later our kids in case our
[17:01] kids are excluded from your group
[17:04] or
[17:05] some kids discourage them from serving
[17:07] the lord we want them to feel apart we
[17:09] want them to feel that
[17:11] so we want this altar so our children
[17:13] will feel apart and not be put down or
[17:16] excluded someday
[17:20] we look deeper at this story
[17:22] then we find these two and a half tribes
[17:25] made a decision way back in numbers made
[17:28] a decision to not go into the promised
[17:30] land we're going to read in a minute the
[17:31] reason why they made a decision not to
[17:33] go fully in
[17:35] they made that decision moses didn't
[17:37] make it god didn't make it they made a
[17:38] decision for themselves two and two
[17:40] tribes themselves and their families
[17:43] that we're we're not going to go into
[17:45] the full promise
[17:47] so uh
[17:49] it because they stayed on that side of
[17:51] jordan so if they didn't have an altar
[17:54] to to look at the kids may say hey now i
[17:58] want you to think about this i want you
[17:59] to slow down here
[18:01] they were thinking that if they if they
[18:04] didn't have an altar that resembled the
[18:06] true altar they were on this side of
[18:07] jordan then someday their kids may come
[18:10] to them and say hey dad
[18:13] some kids were making fun of me today
[18:15] saying that uh that we don't have to do
[18:18] anything to do with the same lord that
[18:20] they do they they were making fun of us
[18:22] but those parents
[18:24] failed to realize that they may also get
[18:27] the question from their kids someday
[18:29] that says dad
[18:31] why do we live on this side of the
[18:33] border
[18:37] now i wish i could express that better
[18:38] i'm not a polish speaker but i want you
[18:40] to settle on parents thinking of what
[18:43] questions they might get someday from
[18:45] their children
[18:47] the question of hey dad i talked to some
[18:49] kids today they were putting me down and
[18:51] they were saying we're not a part of
[18:52] those that serve jehovah god and they so
[18:55] they because they were worried about
[18:56] that question coming they wanted to set
[18:58] up a pattern of the true altar so people
[19:00] could look say we're resembling the true
[19:02] believers that are in the promised land
[19:04] we're close to them fact is they weren't
[19:06] they were they were believers but they
[19:07] were borderline believers
[19:11] they were borderline believers and now
[19:13] borderline believers are protecting
[19:15] their children
[19:18] and so we could put this i might get a i
[19:20] might get my kids made fun of someday so
[19:22] now i'm going to have that question no
[19:24] doubt sunday so i want that thing but
[19:26] here's the other question that they
[19:27] would get that to me would be the harder
[19:30] question for a dad and that is dad i
[19:33] just realized that years ago you were a
[19:35] part of moses message and you were part
[19:37] of the message of the hour and the whole
[19:39] focus of the message was for us to go
[19:41] into the promised land to cross over
[19:43] jordan and take the full inheritance dad
[19:46] why didn't we do it come on yes sir
[19:50] which question is harder
[19:55] well the other one's easier because this
[19:57] question comes back to why they made
[19:59] decisions back then to not fully go into
[20:02] the promise
[20:05] somebody say praise the lord
[20:07] oh my we're going to get into it aren't
[20:09] we
[20:11] but that to me i mean
[20:12] that when you weigh the questions coming
[20:15] from your kids
[20:16] having to deal with listen why didn't we
[20:19] fully go into the promise that god gave
[20:21] to moses what happened dad what happened
[20:24] mom here we were here we have the
[20:26] opportunity to fully go into this thing
[20:28] and why didn't we make a decision to do
[20:30] it and dad would have to answer and
[20:32] we're going to get the answer why they
[20:33] did it in just a minute but before we do
[20:35] that i want you to just take a deep look
[20:36] at this uh that and and how many would
[20:39] agree with me tonight that would be a
[20:41] harder question to answer than kids
[20:43] making fun of their kids
[20:46] much harder question but before we go to
[20:49] numbers 32 that tells the story and
[20:51] answers the question why they stayed on
[20:53] the border let me say this
[20:56] this whole subject matter of blessed
[20:58] families
[20:59] came from the book of genesis out of
[21:02] abraham's life and it was abraham's
[21:04] faith
[21:05] in the promise of god that actually
[21:08] brought the promise that said and all
[21:11] the families of the earth shall be
[21:13] blessed
[21:14] because of what because of the faith of
[21:16] abraham
[21:17] in the promise of the day
[21:20] come on can you say amen
[21:22] all the families of the earth will be
[21:24] blessed because of abraham's faith in
[21:27] what the promise of god for that day god
[21:30] gave a promise abraham believed it can
[21:32] you say amen abraham said we're going to
[21:34] do it and not only that abraham stepped
[21:37] out on the promise abraham separated
[21:40] from whoever or whatever was in between
[21:43] him and the promise abraham uh
[21:46] believed every promise of the age it was
[21:48] his main theme in life
[21:50] everything revolved around the promise
[21:53] in abraham's life amen
[21:55] everything revolved around the promise
[21:57] of the age let me go further
[22:00] all of life's decisions were made with
[22:03] god's promises in mind
[22:06] now here's a family that's how it all
[22:08] began here's a man
[22:10] that first of all he heard god's promise
[22:12] of the age and it had to do with him
[22:15] and second of all he was willing to
[22:17] separate from even family members
[22:20] if that kept him from the promise of the
[22:22] age
[22:23] second thing he separated he left his
[22:26] his kindred he left all those that were
[22:28] dear to because they were all idolaters
[22:29] they he grew up a doctor he he grew up
[22:32] just he didn't know god the true god he
[22:34] knew a bunch of different gods but he
[22:35] didn't know the true god god spoke to
[22:37] him and says i've called you i've called
[22:39] you to land get up and go get away from
[22:41] your kindred and go he obeyed god he
[22:44] stepped out his faith had feet on it can
[22:46] you say man he did something about it
[22:49] praise the lord and what was it about
[22:51] what did abraham's life become all about
[22:53] him and his family him his wife at that
[22:55] time became obsessed they became a
[22:58] completely uh consumed with one thing
[23:02] the promise of the age
[23:04] are you listening young men they're
[23:06] gonna have a family someday
[23:08] are you listening young men and young
[23:09] women they're going to have a family
[23:10] someday you're going to need a vision
[23:12] for that family
[23:13] and i pray that it'll be beyond just a
[23:14] career
[23:16] beyond making a lot of money
[23:18] beyond a lot of possessions and nice
[23:20] clothes
[23:22] abraham's life centered around the
[23:24] promise for the age
[23:27] and he was willing to separate from
[23:29] anything that kept him from it he was
[23:31] separating from whoever or whatever kept
[23:33] him from the promise our father abraham
[23:35] all his life became about the promise of
[23:37] the age it was the main theme in his
[23:39] life
[23:40] everything revolved around it all life's
[23:43] decisions were made with god's promises
[23:45] in mind and he had an unwavering passion
[23:49] of pursuing those promises
[23:53] somebody say praise the lord
[23:55] make him say of abraham he had an
[23:56] unwavering passion
[23:58] to pursue what the promise of god
[24:05] and to see those things taken
[24:07] and inherited and lived and hopefully
[24:10] you're applying this to our lives the
[24:12] promises of god it wasn't something to
[24:14] abraham that you come to church on
[24:15] sunday and just hear about
[24:18] he made it personal to himself
[24:20] my family we're going to pursue these
[24:21] promises
[24:23] god's given it to us this is our land
[24:25] this is our inheritance we're going to
[24:26] go get it can you say amen we're going
[24:28] to be passionate about we're going to
[24:29] keep pursuing it till the end
[24:31] until we receive it that's the passion
[24:33] and faith that was unwavering that is
[24:36] told about in the new testament and let
[24:38] me just say this though that any time
[24:40] abraham made decisions where there was
[24:43] where the promise wasn't the priority he
[24:45] got into trouble
[24:48] any time
[24:49] abraham made decisions in life
[24:52] where the promise wasn't the priority
[24:56] he got into trouble and did he do it yes
[24:58] he did a couple of times he got a famine
[25:01] he didn't know what are we gonna eat he
[25:02] starts getting nervous we gotta we gotta
[25:04] make this decision we gotta do this we
[25:06] we had to change this all right and so
[25:09] now he made a decision the decisions he
[25:11] made without the promise in light now
[25:14] got him into trouble and he made it
[25:16] based upon a famine he got into trouble
[25:18] uh
[25:18] maybe not financially but if there's a
[25:20] famine in land you know what i'm going
[25:22] to feed all my my herdsmen and all the
[25:24] people here i'm looking down the road
[25:26] here six months if it keeps in this
[25:27] famine we're not gonna have anything to
[25:29] eat
[25:30] so i think we should go down into egypt
[25:32] whenever he got out of his own land he
[25:34] wasn't under god's blessings anymore
[25:37] so any decisions he made that didn't
[25:39] have the priority of the promise
[25:42] got him into trouble we can apply that
[25:44] as seat of abraham
[25:45] we can apply it today
[25:48] and also we can probably have a
[25:49] testimony service and you can tell of
[25:51] the times where you made decisions not
[25:54] based upon the center being christ and
[25:56] his promises and that being the priority
[25:59] in your life
[26:00] how many can raise your hand say i can
[26:01] testify of that i've got both hands up
[26:03] tonight
[26:05] i've been there done that i know what it
[26:07] means to just go in a direction and for
[26:09] years pay for things that i've done that
[26:11] because i made decisions with not enough
[26:14] prayer and not enough of the priority
[26:17] being god's speaking to me god's
[26:19] speaking to my family god god has me on
[26:21] a channel that i'm inheriting the
[26:23] promises of god i'm living in victory
[26:25] all the time i'm going from from victory
[26:28] to victory i'm i'm growing can you say
[26:30] man but soon as i make decisions based
[26:32] upon finances or based upon careers or
[26:35] based upon the influence of parents or
[26:38] something like that or family members
[26:40] that want you to do something
[26:42] you can't do it
[26:44] it's got to be upon the promise of the
[26:46] hour
[26:47] our family's priority must be as
[26:50] abraham's here so it has to be a
[26:51] priority you get in trouble
[26:53] thus comes the blessings on all the
[26:55] families of the earth because of
[26:56] abraham's passionate pursuit of the
[26:59] promise of god for that age is it not
[27:02] still important here tonight that that
[27:04] has to be the passion in our lives what
[27:06] is god's promise for this age and my
[27:09] family how do we fit into that picture
[27:12] is that shouldn't that be our passion
[27:14] can you say amen above career above
[27:16] money above anything can you say amen i
[27:18] can tell you abraham he was not a poor
[27:21] man abraham was a blessed man
[27:23] financially and in every way and he
[27:25] stayed in that channel as long as he was
[27:28] under the headship and pursuing the
[27:29] promise of god for that age growing into
[27:32] it becoming a part of it
[27:35] can you say amen
[27:36] praise the lord
[27:38] so now
[27:39] thus all the families of the earth
[27:41] become blessed because of a man like
[27:42] this living this way tonight
[27:44] does your family have this priority
[27:48] is christ the priority is the promises
[27:50] of god in pursuing the promises and
[27:51] growing each individually in that family
[27:54] members
[27:55] as parents is that the priority for your
[27:56] kids
[27:58] is it college or is it where they
[27:59] receive
[28:00] the promise of god
[28:02] what are you talking about brother paul
[28:05] you shall receive the holy ghost and the
[28:08] promise is unto you
[28:10] and your children
[28:13] amen if there's no prayers
[28:15] of create just a craving in the hearts
[28:18] of a parents
[28:20] in their hearts to say god
[28:22] fill my children
[28:24] with the true spirit of god
[28:27] give them more than a religion
[28:29] give give them that change that
[28:31] born-again experience
[28:33] there's not enough parents on this earth
[28:36] praying for that to god
[28:38] they're saying lord give me money to
[28:39] send them to college lord provide this
[28:42] for them and help me lord help them to
[28:44] be a good person in society but the
[28:45] prayer ultimately which should be this
[28:48] promise that's unto you and your
[28:50] children it's for you tonight
[28:52] i'm just a young mother the promise that
[28:54] your children can be saved is for you
[28:56] tonight you take a hold of that promise
[28:59] for your children stop praying while
[29:00] they're only two years old start praying
[29:02] for him now
[29:04] i claim that little two-year-old for the
[29:06] kingdom of god i dedicate him to you i'm
[29:08] gonna do everything in my means i'm not
[29:10] a perfect parent by any means i made
[29:12] huge mistakes in my life but i'm
[29:14] bringing it under the blood of jesus
[29:16] christ and i want my children to have
[29:17] better than what i had
[29:20] i want my children to be filled and go
[29:22] beyond what i am in christ
[29:25] oh that's a great great desire that
[29:27] should be in the parents can you say
[29:28] amen praise the lord so now does your
[29:31] family have that priority so now
[29:34] when we go back to
[29:36] jordan then jordan means death so you're
[29:38] crossing jordans
[29:41] you're crossing over and so if you type
[29:44] that to a life where a family
[29:47] is making these things the priority then
[29:50] the first thing they do is they
[29:51] themselves live out a life of death to
[29:53] themselves jordan means death i want the
[29:56] promises but you can't come to the
[29:57] promises do you cross over jordan
[30:00] i want the promises but you can't cross
[30:02] over
[30:02] until you cross until you die to
[30:04] yourself
[30:05] and your children see you
[30:08] dying out to yourself
[30:11] your children see you dying to your
[30:14] pride
[30:16] what is what is dying to yourself well
[30:19] let's just start with
[30:20] being able to repent
[30:25] that's where it starts doesn't it person
[30:27] a person is not willing to die to their
[30:30] pride and not showing any spiritual
[30:31] death in life until they're ready to
[30:34] truly repent
[30:37] if they've done something wrong to
[30:39] repent whoever it is to their children
[30:42] to their boss
[30:43] and then first of all to god
[30:45] let the children see a dying out of
[30:47] pride you say well you mean you're at
[30:50] home so they're not serving the lord but
[30:52] then if you have children
[30:54] this is a just a powerful thing
[30:57] children that are in the world families
[30:58] in the world god gets a hold of that mom
[31:00] and dad
[31:02] and it has such a profound effect just
[31:05] that first step of god leading them to
[31:08] repentance to see their parents lay down
[31:11] everything for christ and come to the
[31:13] altar and say god i have been wrong all
[31:16] of my life my life is full of sin and i
[31:19] repent of i acknowledge my sin and i
[31:22] need you to come and wash my sins away
[31:25] and then they believe in a life of
[31:26] sanctifying their life all right you
[31:28] know i don't want this in my life
[31:29] anymore god takes the smoking and the
[31:31] drinking all that what a profound effect
[31:34] you know what the kids are seeing
[31:35] they're seeing their parents cross over
[31:38] jordan
[31:39] dying out to themselves
[31:42] and as if they keep growing in the lord
[31:44] they're going to see that death
[31:45] happening through their growth in christ
[31:47] you stop dying and stop repenting you
[31:49] stop growing
[31:51] amen
[31:52] if you stop repenting if you stop saying
[31:54] the words
[31:55] i'm sorry please forgive me
[31:58] if your pride gets to the place you
[32:00] can't say that anymore then you you've
[32:02] stopped growing in christ
[32:05] so there's this continual death that
[32:06] goes on isn't there
[32:08] and the kids they see this my kids they
[32:11] see it they
[32:12] that sometimes if they don't see that
[32:15] death they see pride lifted up above the
[32:18] the repentance that that speaks worlds
[32:21] to them
[32:23] and so that's part of it is the is the
[32:25] is crossing jordan crossing jordan means
[32:28] death to self it means repentance it
[32:31] means sanctifying your life that's hard
[32:33] to do that's why it's a death it's a
[32:35] death to self but i want to hold on to
[32:36] this but death to self says i won't hold
[32:39] on to it we're sanctifying that in our
[32:40] lives we're getting rid of this drinking
[32:42] and the smoking in the this party life
[32:44] we're not going to do that anymore hang
[32:45] around all these party people of the
[32:47] world we're separating our lives unto
[32:49] god here and the children watch that and
[32:51] they see that as being a death in their
[32:53] life
[32:57] and so
[32:59] the whole focus
[33:01] it now becomes coming into what is ours
[33:03] spiritually that's the main thing the
[33:05] focus of the family begins to come into
[33:08] a place is that what has been given to
[33:10] us as an inheritance spiritually
[33:13] what do we need to do to get there
[33:16] what do we need to die out to and what
[33:18] what do we need to fight because
[33:19] remember they had to fight in the
[33:20] promised land
[33:22] we're going to continue to fight as a
[33:24] family till we receive all that christ
[33:27] died for at calvary
[33:29] what it what is spiritually ours given
[33:31] to us freely
[33:32] what is it and we're pursuing it
[33:36] and that's why you read the bible to
[33:37] your children that's why you read and
[33:39] pray if you go through your life and you
[33:41] read and you send them to church and you
[33:43] come to church and do those other things
[33:45] but they don't know that all of that has
[33:47] to do with a pursuit
[33:49] and that is something spiritually has
[33:51] been given to me in his inheritance and
[33:53] the reason that i read my bible is i
[33:55] want my inheritance in christ
[33:58] i want to be close to christ i want him
[34:00] a part of my life that's my inheritance
[34:02] i pray because i want to get closer to
[34:04] god i don't pray because it's a ritual i
[34:07] don't read my bible because it's a
[34:08] ritual there's a spiritual inheritance
[34:10] that's been given to me and i'm going to
[34:12] fight for it every day
[34:14] so no even though you're tired in your
[34:16] eyes
[34:17] kids might sometimes see at night when
[34:20] they get those devotions too late and
[34:22] all those kids you know are rubbing
[34:24] their eyes and not only the kids dad's
[34:26] rubbing his eyes and he's just tired you
[34:27] know and drowsy and dad grabs that bible
[34:30] you know and says we just need to spend
[34:33] we need to read just a little bit and
[34:34] shakes himself you know a little bit and
[34:36] says let's read the word of god pray
[34:38] together before we go to bed talks a
[34:40] little bit about something maybe gives a
[34:42] little testimony or something like that
[34:44] what's he doing he's showing them listen
[34:47] this is a battle sometimes
[34:49] this is a fight sometimes
[34:52] daddy has got to go fight some more
[34:54] demons tomorrow it's a hard atmosphere
[34:55] at work right now there's all kinds of
[34:57] cussing going on around me and all kinds
[34:59] of stuff taking place i can't seem to
[35:01] change that that's the way it is and
[35:02] daddy's got to keep providing a living
[35:04] it's the only job i got i got to keep
[35:05] going and so daddy's in a battle we're
[35:08] in a battle can you say amen
[35:10] and i want to have a passionate i want
[35:12] to i want to receive the things that are
[35:14] my inheritance in jesus christ let the
[35:17] children see i'm going to keep fighting
[35:19] we're going to keep reading our bible
[35:21] we're going to keep praying we're going
[35:22] to keep being at the house of god we're
[35:24] going to keep sending our kids where
[35:26] they need we're going to keep doing it
[35:27] we're not going to quit
[35:29] why because of a ritual no because we're
[35:32] in pursuit of the promise of this day
[35:35] some children something has been given
[35:37] to us and we've got to fight for it
[35:39] god can bless our family to be holy
[35:42] ghost-filled people in this hour and
[35:44] come to a perfection and tell the kids i
[35:46] don't know how he's going to do that
[35:47] except by his grace because i don't
[35:49] think i can even reach there i know i
[35:51] can't but god has promised he's going to
[35:54] have a perfect bride
[35:56] so we're going to keep fighting for it
[35:58] we're going to keep going to church
[36:02] children are going to see dad and mom
[36:04] worshiping the lord
[36:07] can i get an amen
[36:09] children should see dad and mom
[36:11] worshiping the lord not fulfilling a
[36:13] religious duty
[36:15] they're they're passionate about this
[36:17] they're on fire for it not
[36:19] every personality is different i'm not
[36:20] talking about personality i'm talking
[36:22] about the heart of that parent is that
[36:24] this is what i'm all about the word of
[36:26] god not about my church but i'm about
[36:28] the word and about christ and i i want
[36:30] more of him
[36:33] amen
[36:35] praise be to god
[36:37] so coming into and fighting for and
[36:39] living in the joy of our land in the
[36:42] holy ghost i want to say that again
[36:44] coming the focus is coming into
[36:46] fighting for and living in the joy of
[36:49] our land in the holy ghost because
[36:51] that's what it should
[36:52] be and so to many
[36:55] kids they don't see the joy in their
[36:58] parents serving the lord
[37:01] they don't see it as a joy
[37:02] they see it as a bondage
[37:04] they see it as that i grew up with this
[37:06] thing and i'm kind of getting tired of
[37:07] it
[37:09] oh god have mercy
[37:11] this holy ghostland is a joy
[37:14] and our children our families should see
[37:16] that it's a joy
[37:18] and we all all of our parents how many
[37:19] reasons we stand corrected tonight
[37:22] there's not all the time they look and
[37:23] see that
[37:25] you know we go through our struggles but
[37:26] not all the time they look and see and
[37:28] so sometimes they they see different
[37:30] things but help us to stay in tune with
[37:32] god so when they look at this and the
[37:34] image of what this is and everything it
[37:36] is that it's not a bond it's it's not a
[37:38] frustration the bible says don't
[37:40] frustrate the grace of god don't let it
[37:42] be confusing get to the word and let god
[37:44] dissolve your confusion so your children
[37:46] don't see confusion and i don't know
[37:47] what it is i don't know how to do this
[37:49] get in the word find the absolutes and
[37:51] let them see stability let them see
[37:54] consistency and then when you make a
[37:56] mistake let them see you repent
[37:59] let them see you bring it to god can you
[38:01] say amen and so that's what we're coming
[38:04] into fighting the joy of the holy ghost
[38:06] and i dare say
[38:08] that's not the main theme in many
[38:09] message families today
[38:12] pursuing this inheritance pursuing the
[38:14] holy ghost
[38:16] that's not the main theme
[38:19] but we must let them see
[38:21] us speaking to our god in prayer that he
[38:23] is a person
[38:24] that we read because he's a person we
[38:26] want to learn of him that we obey him
[38:28] because he's a person and we love him
[38:32] but it's motive it's a motive
[38:34] the whole motive of it of reading our
[38:37] bible and praying and coming to church
[38:39] and
[38:40] and all these things that we do lord's
[38:42] supper all these things that we
[38:44] do our motive
[38:47] is for us to live in our spiritual
[38:49] promised land
[38:51] so i hope i'm helping you tonight i just
[38:53] i'm just letting it flow but this is the
[38:56] passion that a family should express
[38:58] if you don't feel like you're there
[39:00] tonight we'll join the crowd
[39:02] join the crowd but abraham made his
[39:04] mistakes
[39:05] can you say man abraham made his
[39:07] mistakes
[39:08] but
[39:09] he come back to that the new testament
[39:11] doesn't write about his mistakes
[39:12] it writes about his relentless pursuit
[39:15] and faith in the promise of god
[39:17] that's what it's written about so if you
[39:19] had that as an overall picture of your
[39:20] life that my if my kids can say which
[39:23] they will say uh they're probably
[39:24] already saying it but they will say dad
[39:26] you know he made some blunders and man
[39:28] you know he messed up and he lost this
[39:30] and he lost that you know what i'm
[39:32] talking about and and you know dad you
[39:34] know but but but i want him to be able
[39:36] to see the overall picture is his
[39:38] passion was for god he brought his sins
[39:40] underneath the blood of jesus christ he
[39:42] brought us mistakes to god he admitted
[39:44] him to us he was he was humble about it
[39:47] he showed the humility of christ
[39:50] and but his pursuit was that goal
[39:53] that he's seen
[39:54] of where sons of god could be that's
[39:57] what my children can see i want to place
[39:59] that in front of them all the time this
[40:01] is where god's taking a christian
[40:04] this this is where a christian
[40:06] can become
[40:08] that's what the bible says a christian
[40:10] can become
[40:12] that we move beyond the scriptures that
[40:14] says
[40:15] i shouldn't say behind them but we we we
[40:17] get scriptures that if we if we confess
[40:20] our sins he's faithful and just to
[40:22] forgive us our sins i'm thankful for
[40:23] that promise
[40:24] but there's two or three other
[40:25] scriptures that say unto him that's able
[40:28] to keep you from falling
[40:32] so there's a power in there not only to
[40:34] forgive you but there's a power in there
[40:36] that you can live in a place of victory
[40:40] still knowing that you can make a
[40:41] mistake in humility but more and more
[40:43] victory all the time i'm living above
[40:45] that i've got satan under my feet
[40:47] there's scriptures about that too that's
[40:49] the problem with the denominational
[40:51] world sometimes they only present that
[40:52] picture of the blood of jesus christ
[40:54] constantly having to forgive the sins
[40:55] but they don't talk about the power of
[40:57] an adopted son of god come to his place
[40:59] of authority
[41:01] to live above the devil's temptation
[41:04] those scriptures are in there too and
[41:06] let our families and our children see
[41:08] daddy and molly pursuing an overcoming
[41:10] life
[41:11] in the promised land
[41:14] hopefully that just plants the vision in
[41:16] your heart
[41:17] amen how god brings that to pass in your
[41:19] individual family well that's up to you
[41:22] but the pursuit should be the promise of
[41:23] god
[41:24] amen
[41:25] you look you come to this church you
[41:26] look at well i'll never be that and i'll
[41:28] ever be as far as this one or them
[41:30] brother paul whatever that's not the way
[41:31] you need to be looking at this every
[41:33] promise
[41:34] that i've come to and haven't come to is
[41:36] yours just as much as mine
[41:38] you're sitting there saying this isn't
[41:40] for me no it's for you brother ed it's
[41:42] for you brother kyle it's for you
[41:44] brother brown and it's for you sister
[41:46] sandy it's for you every promise that
[41:48] christ died for is your promise too
[41:52] it's yours yes
[41:54] but i can't get it for you have to get
[41:56] it for yourself
[41:58] be better if you got it now
[42:01] as opposed to waiting later because your
[42:02] children are going to be watching your
[42:04] life
[42:06] they want to see something real can you
[42:07] say amen
[42:08] now look hold your finger there and look
[42:10] at hebrews 6 12. here's another thing
[42:12] too that i think is important
[42:14] and that is who we follow because we do
[42:18] follow people
[42:19] we'll have choices in who we hang around
[42:22] and hebrews chapter 6 here says
[42:26] in verse 12
[42:28] hebrews 6 and verse 12. we haven't even
[42:30] got to that numbers 23 yet
[42:33] or numbers 32.
[42:35] look at this i'm just so excited about
[42:37] talking about the promise
[42:39] and families being passionate about the
[42:41] promise of this age
[42:43] hebrews 6 and verse 12 says
[42:46] that ye be not slothful
[42:48] but followers of them
[42:51] who through faith and patience
[42:53] inherit the promises
[42:56] so now we have a whole picture of who
[42:58] you're following
[43:00] who you're hanging around
[43:03] and i think we should get our families
[43:04] around those
[43:06] that are inhere we can see they're
[43:08] inheriting the promises
[43:10] they're living victorious life they're
[43:12] positive
[43:13] they're the joshua and caleb if you
[43:14] don't feel like a joshua and caleb
[43:17] and you feel like you're acting not like
[43:19] a joshua and caleb then you don't need
[43:20] to go spend a lot of time with another
[43:22] person that's negative
[43:24] you need to get around somebody that's
[43:26] inheriting the promises
[43:28] and so that god always has somebody
[43:29] that's further along in their spiritual
[43:31] walk and a lot of times we back off from
[43:33] people like that may they intimidate us
[43:35] we feel nervous having them home or
[43:36] whatever no that's who you need to be
[43:38] around that's a good peer pressure
[43:41] that's a good thing the bible says to
[43:43] follow those that are inheriting the
[43:44] promises
[43:46] they're living in victory can you say
[43:47] amen it's not to defeat you and make you
[43:50] feel i'll never be anybody but it's to
[43:52] it's to encourage you to say my this is
[43:54] where this is going and so now you get
[43:56] your children around those that's why i
[43:58] appreciate parents that get their
[44:00] children around those that are
[44:01] these good camps and just good
[44:03] atmospheres and they encourage your
[44:05] children to do that they have a choice
[44:06] where they want to hang around and
[44:08] parents have a choice where they send
[44:09] their kids but for the most part you
[44:11] want to influence them to be around
[44:13] those that are of a spiritual nature and
[44:15] and are striving for the things of god
[44:19] amen
[44:20] you say well i want my children to be a
[44:22] witness so i want to put them out there
[44:24] so they can be a witness you put them
[44:26] out there way too much and not enough
[44:28] getting strength from those in here than
[44:29] promises
[44:30] you're going to weaken your kids
[44:33] because you trust too much they got a
[44:34] lot of good in them that's great but you
[44:36] trust too much that they're the witness
[44:38] to this world and they got it all to be
[44:40] a witness but it can weaken them if they
[44:42] hang around that all the time
[44:45] bible says to follow those who inherit
[44:46] the promises
[44:48] is your family following those that are
[44:52] inheriting the promises i like to ask
[44:53] these little questions
[44:55] you have to answer
[44:57] but i like to ask these in this series
[45:00] he said don't dump it off to somebody
[45:01] else i'm asking you brother i'm talking
[45:04] to you everyone in this building brother
[45:07] is your family following those that are
[45:10] inheriting the promises
[45:12] or is most of your time around those
[45:14] they're not inheriting promises they're
[45:16] nice people they're even good christians
[45:18] but are they moving on with the promise
[45:20] of god coming into it amen
[45:24] amen think about it now
[45:29] they need to be around people
[45:31] who can fall they can follow that are
[45:34] beyond them spiritually so they can grow
[45:36] now look what happened in in numbers 32
[45:38] here and we'll try to wrap this up
[45:41] numbers 32 now this is where
[45:43] all the way back here is when we find
[45:46] the reason why they didn't go in
[45:48] and it says here
[45:50] this is very important
[45:54] we talked about got the end of the the
[45:56] road in joshua and the joshua said now
[45:59] it's time for you to go back over jordan
[46:01] you've helped us fight
[46:02] but now it's time for you to go back why
[46:04] in the world would have to go back and
[46:06] not live in the promised land they made
[46:07] a choice right here in numbers 30 30 um
[46:10] 32 with moses now the children of reuben
[46:14] and the children of gad had a very great
[46:17] multitude of cattle and when they saw
[46:19] the land of jazer and the land of gilead
[46:22] that behold the place
[46:24] was a place
[46:26] for cattle
[46:29] now that may not be important to you
[46:31] tonight but it was very important to
[46:34] reuben
[46:35] and to gad
[46:39] verse 2 says the children of god and the
[46:40] children of reuben came and spake unto
[46:42] moses and the lease of the priests and
[46:43] then the prince of the congregation
[46:44] saying
[46:45] uh
[46:46] atheroth
[46:47] and dibon
[46:49] and jazer and nimrod and hishbon
[46:52] and alilier
[46:54] and shebam and
[46:57] nebu
[46:58] and beyond
[47:01] and my wife wants me to go to a class to
[47:03] learn how to pronounce these words
[47:07] or get me an app or
[47:08] something even the country which the
[47:11] lord smote before the congregation of
[47:12] israel
[47:13] is a land for cattle
[47:16] and thy servants have cattle
[47:22] now friends i want you to look at the
[47:23] reasoning
[47:25] behind people
[47:26] that have come out in the message with
[47:28] moses he's preached what the whole
[47:30] person purpose of the message is come
[47:33] out of egypt
[47:34] been in now in the wilderness
[47:37] 40 years and now they're just getting
[47:39] ready to come into the full purpose
[47:41] of what the message was sent to do
[47:44] and that's to come into the inheritance
[47:48] and here they are just on the verge of
[47:50] it
[47:51] here they are
[47:52] and they say
[47:54] this place that we've overcome here this
[47:56] side of jordan
[47:57] it's a a place for cattle and moses
[48:01] you know your servants we have cattle
[48:03] we're in the cattle
[48:06] it's similar to when jesus talked about
[48:08] the invitation to the
[48:11] feast
[48:12] and they all with one accord begin to
[48:14] make excuse
[48:16] and interestingly enough
[48:18] one was i needed to go purchase a piece
[48:22] of real estate
[48:25] another one was i have married a wife
[48:30] which is close to an excuse but it's
[48:32] still not an excuse
[48:33] close to a good enough excuse but it's
[48:34] not
[48:37] third was i've i've bought an oxen
[48:40] bought a cow it's similar to here
[48:42] we have cattle
[48:44] and we've looked at this land and this
[48:46] land would be perfect for us
[48:49] in uh what we do
[48:51] can you imagine
[48:54] so i want you to notice there's no
[48:56] spiritual mindset of making decisions
[49:01] there can't be
[49:03] they haven't caught the theme of the
[49:05] message they haven't caught what the
[49:06] message was sent for
[49:08] because they're making decisions based
[49:11] upon what's comfortable in a certain
[49:13] land for their business that they're in
[49:15] and what they do and friends we can't
[49:17] make decisions about that we must make
[49:19] decisions in our business with the
[49:21] priority of the promise that god's
[49:24] calling us to amen
[49:27] so now i can preach another hour about
[49:29] decisions that are made based upon
[49:32] cattle
[49:34] what is your cattle
[49:36] what is the thing that you do
[49:39] what is your vision what is your pursuit
[49:41] what is your goal what is in these
[49:42] things because often in life you'll take
[49:45] something you have your goal
[49:47] and then you'll find a perfect situation
[49:50] for your goal and it seems like a
[49:52] perfect fit
[49:54] and people in the message will make
[49:56] decisions sometimes only based on that
[49:59] they'll make a move sometimes and their
[50:01] spiritual inheritance is not considered
[50:03] at all
[50:04] how it's gonna how it's gonna affect
[50:06] their family is not considered at all
[50:09] what kind of church in they're gonna be
[50:10] in is not considered at all right
[50:14] and to me i've uh i felt like through
[50:16] the years that i've said it this way and
[50:19] i'll say it become because i'm a pastor
[50:21] if i was a lay member too
[50:23] if we had to go somewhere and get a job
[50:25] the first place that i pray about going
[50:27] is where is there a solid
[50:29] word preaching church
[50:31] and i trust the man
[50:34] because brother brown says if you give
[50:35] your pastor respects he'll lead you
[50:37] through to the other side that's how
[50:39] powerful that effect is
[50:41] it's a it's a it's a trust level can you
[50:43] say man
[50:44] and so now
[50:45] if it's a respect level it's a trust
[50:47] level i would pray about first first
[50:50] where is that man where is that man
[50:52] where my children are are relating to
[50:54] him and my wife is growing and i'm
[50:56] growing and i'm feeding and uh and and
[50:59] my children are they're in an atmosphere
[51:01] there you can see them slowly growing in
[51:03] the things of the lord and where is that
[51:06] man and where is the best atmosphere for
[51:08] that to happen and then when i find that
[51:11] then lord i need a job
[51:15] now that's contrary to a lot of people's
[51:18] opinions and thinking and i'm not even
[51:19] making it a doctrine here tonight i'm
[51:21] just saying that we are more blessed
[51:24] when we're in that channel of being fed
[51:27] and our family's in that flow and that
[51:30] channel of being fed that's why young
[51:32] girls got to pray about a man who knows
[51:33] his place he knows where he belongs this
[51:35] is where he i go to church this is where
[51:37] i pay my tithes this i got confidence in
[51:39] that man we're bringing our family under
[51:41] the headship of of the word and and what
[51:43] what we're doing here because it says
[51:44] something to your children you got to
[51:46] look for a young guy like that young
[51:47] girl
[51:48] he knows his place he's not bouncing
[51:50] around everywhere but he knows where he
[51:51] belongs not that god wouldn't call him
[51:53] somewhere else someday but i'm saying he
[51:55] knows where his place is and and there's
[51:57] confidence and security that comes from
[51:58] the family and also there's this flow of
[52:01] the holy spirit in their lives causing
[52:04] them to grow in the things of god
[52:07] that's first
[52:08] that's first
[52:10] and
[52:11] a lot of times decisions are not made
[52:13] upon that
[52:14] at all
[52:16] and that's a tragedy may i always hold
[52:18] to that principle myself and conviction
[52:20] myself if i ever had to make a decision
[52:22] to take my family somewhere where that
[52:25] that man and that ministry and that all
[52:27] that he represents and just what he's
[52:29] preaching and the whole tone of
[52:31] everything the balance that's why that's
[52:33] why we said a few weeks ago
[52:35] to someone who wasn't getting fed i said
[52:37] a couple of brothers not getting fit i
[52:39] said listen
[52:40] i would love for everybody to be here
[52:43] but listen if you've gone for a long
[52:44] time and not being fed
[52:46] that's something you really got to pray
[52:48] about
[52:50] because what i want as a pastor is every
[52:52] person here to be in a channel that
[52:54] they're really getting fed
[52:56] and so now if that's not happening
[52:58] you've got to go find that place i love
[53:00] you and i want you and i appreciate
[53:02] everything and and all that but you've
[53:04] got to that's priority don't sit here
[53:07] and not get fed
[53:10] it has to be a priority
[53:12] and a lot of that comes from the respect
[53:15] and trust that this man is yielding
[53:17] himself to god can you say amen and so
[53:20] he's committed to me
[53:22] and i'm committed to him
[53:24] not as a man but i'm committed to his
[53:26] ministry i'm committed to get put my
[53:28] shoulder to the wheel with him there's a
[53:30] certain commitment level you know that
[53:32] that's right um am i committed to you
[53:36] okay three or four said amen
[53:40] and my my level of commitment to you i'm
[53:42] just being myself here tonight
[53:44] all right not that i'm being phony every
[53:46] other service but i'm i'm being more
[53:47] open
[53:48] but you know
[53:50] am i committed to you am i coming to you
[53:52] how am i committed to you i may not be
[53:54] able to call you every week i may not be
[53:56] able to have a friendship with you and i
[53:58] desire that you asked my wife i just i
[54:00] said i wish i could get with them i wish
[54:02] i could do that in this and just don't
[54:03] have all the time to do it and you don't
[54:05] have all the time to be with me either
[54:07] and so we often think i want to the
[54:09] friendship and all those other things
[54:10] but you see that's not what the
[54:12] scripture gives is my commitment as a
[54:14] minister to you my commitment is to
[54:16] labor in the word of god
[54:18] for your souls to get fed
[54:21] and to remain committed to that priority
[54:24] and committed to help you to pray with
[54:26] you to be there when when you're in the
[54:28] hospital whatever whatever needs you had
[54:31] share it with me so we can bring it
[54:32] before the throne of grace i'm not
[54:34] perfect and i can't get to you all the
[54:35] time but i'm telling you this that's the
[54:37] commitment and i'll tell you i can say
[54:38] in my heart i am committed to each and
[54:40] every one of you for that and not just
[54:43] to you but others that god has put in
[54:45] the different places we go to minister
[54:46] in the youth i have a huge burden for
[54:48] the youth i have a huge burden also for
[54:50] to get the message out in spanish it's
[54:52] not just locally here but i have other
[54:54] burdens and things but you here are the
[54:56] priority i am committed to you
[54:59] now if that's a spiritual commitment to
[55:01] your souls then why can't people offer
[55:03] that same commitment to the pastor
[55:05] that's right sure
[55:09] amen amen
[55:12] praise the lord
[55:15] you know what it is it's it's trust you
[55:17] can't demand trust
[55:19] can't ever demand trust
[55:21] but you should pray and find that
[55:23] channel of god
[55:25] and not make decisions based upon a good
[55:27] place for cattle
[55:30] you know what i'm talking about you know
[55:32] what i'm talking about you make
[55:34] decisions based upon
[55:36] can you imagine the promised land is
[55:38] just before them here's moses reaction
[55:40] look at this this
[55:42] verse six you still with me
[55:45] it's only 20 after eight
[55:47] numbers 32 6 and moses verse 5 says
[55:50] wherefore said they if we have found
[55:52] grace in thy sight let this land be
[55:54] given unto thy servants for possession
[55:56] and bring us not over jordan they're not
[55:58] going to die out to themselves they're
[56:00] not they don't want to go into the
[56:02] promised land two tribes
[56:05] here's the whole purpose of the message
[56:07] and they're going to stay on the
[56:08] borderline
[56:10] i'm not going in
[56:12] verse 6 and moses said unto the children
[56:14] of god and the children reuben shall
[56:16] your brethren go to war and shall ye sit
[56:20] here
[56:21] that's the first thing he says
[56:23] your brother are getting ready to go to
[56:24] war for our inheritance and you want to
[56:26] sit here
[56:29] and wherefore discourage ye the heart of
[56:32] the children of israel from going over
[56:34] into the land which the lord had given
[56:35] them so here's the other problem there's
[56:37] going to be an influence
[56:40] come from these borderline believers
[56:42] to not fully go into the promise
[56:45] you're going to discourage other people
[56:47] from going in to their full inheritance
[56:49] in christ
[56:51] oh lord thus did your fathers when i
[56:53] sent them from canis barnea so he's
[56:55] referring to their history when they're
[56:56] only three and a half days away from the
[56:58] promised land they went to katie
[57:00] sparring here's the fruit and everything
[57:01] and they all begin to murmur we can't do
[57:02] it we can't do it and so they wandered
[57:04] for 40 years three and a half days from
[57:06] the promised land and they wandered for
[57:07] 40 years because of no faith
[57:10] because of no passion for the promise
[57:12] because of fear
[57:14] the giants are too big
[57:16] i can't do it i'll never be able to
[57:18] overcome that you're sitting here
[57:20] tonight saying i could never be a
[57:21] christian like these other christian
[57:22] ladies here in this church i can quit
[57:24] being negative quit saying that
[57:27] god has his inheritance for you too
[57:31] praise be to god he just needs your
[57:33] faith to say i can do it
[57:35] we're well able to do it
[57:37] by god's grace i'm not perfect by any
[57:39] means but i'm going to keep saying
[57:41] i'm going to keep pressing forward
[57:43] for when they went up into the valley of
[57:45] ishko and saw the land they discouraged
[57:47] the heart of children of israel that
[57:48] they should not go into the land which
[57:50] the lord had given them and the lord's
[57:51] anger was kindled at the same time and
[57:53] he swears saying surely none of the men
[57:55] that came out of egypt from 20 years and
[57:57] old and upward shall see the land which
[57:59] i swear unto abraham unto isaac and unto
[58:01] jacob because they have not wholly
[58:03] followed me
[58:06] so god got angry at them and
[58:09] from 20 years old and upward
[58:12] uh
[58:13] 20 years old and upwards shall see the
[58:15] land which i swear in the father unto
[58:17] isaac and to jacob
[58:19] let me read that right surely none of
[58:20] the men that came none of the men from
[58:22] 20 years old over shall see that land
[58:24] that was 40 years before they're not
[58:25] going to see it because of their lack of
[58:27] faith
[58:30] save verse 12 save caleb
[58:34] the son of jeffnah
[58:36] and the k the canaanite and joshua the
[58:38] son of none for they have holy followed
[58:42] the lord
[58:43] so he refers back and say brothers
[58:46] brothers listen
[58:47] listen to me listen
[58:50] brothers
[58:53] listen
[58:54] what are you thinking
[58:56] we're right here at the very border of
[58:59] this now
[59:01] we're here ready to go into the full
[59:03] promise
[59:05] and you're making a decision based upon
[59:07] this is the best for your business and
[59:08] your cattle and all these other things
[59:10] do you realize
[59:12] you could
[59:13] you realize you're gonna sit here and
[59:14] not fight with your brothers this is
[59:16] what we've been looking forward to
[59:18] this is what the message is for
[59:21] moses is going to go off the scene as a
[59:22] matter of fact here moses is gone he's
[59:24] passed on his commission is fulfilled
[59:27] amen
[59:28] but the very thing moses preached has
[59:29] now come to pass and they're going to be
[59:31] a borderline believer
[59:33] too scared to go that far
[59:36] second of all he says you're going to
[59:38] discourage the rest of the congregation
[59:40] you're going to discourage other people
[59:41] and i don't have time to get in tonight
[59:43] maybe we'll do it next wednesday night
[59:44] but at the end it says
[59:46] uh gad what's the two tribes
[59:49] gad and uh
[59:52] reuben and a half tribe of manasseh
[59:57] at the end of this chapter you're gonna
[59:59] find a half of the manasseh tribe
[1:00:02] somehow i was talking to brother aaron
[1:00:03] mcgarry today he says the only thing he
[1:00:05] could see from scripture is that to see
[1:00:08] that they're in the midst of this
[1:00:09] influence that thing very thing happened
[1:00:12] is that they influenced half of the
[1:00:15] tribe of manasseh to stay
[1:00:17] this side of jordan
[1:00:19] so influence is a power thing
[1:00:21] powerful thing
[1:00:24] not going in
[1:00:25] we're happy here you guys go on over
[1:00:27] so then the story goes as moses goes on
[1:00:29] and i just want to finish that with
[1:00:31] cable caleb in a minute but it goes on
[1:00:32] to say if you want to read it when you
[1:00:34] get home tonight or this week if you
[1:00:36] want to read it moses agrees to let them
[1:00:38] do it two tribes and the half tribe of
[1:00:40] manasseh they're going to stay there but
[1:00:42] they have to agree to go fight they
[1:00:43] leave their wives and children home they
[1:00:45] go fight with them and there you pick it
[1:00:47] up all the way at the end of the at the
[1:00:49] end of the fighting at the end of joshua
[1:00:51] i read as you a text tonight
[1:00:52] and that's when they said it's time to
[1:00:54] go back and when we go back we're going
[1:00:56] to build an altar and they built a
[1:00:58] beautiful beautiful a very visible in a
[1:01:00] large altar so you could see it from the
[1:01:03] other side of jordan
[1:01:06] big
[1:01:07] altar that resembled the true altar
[1:01:09] these were these people
[1:01:11] they
[1:01:13] wouldn't go on with the promise they
[1:01:15] wouldn't go any further they were
[1:01:16] borderline
[1:01:17] but they wanted to have some resemblance
[1:01:20] to what they used to believe
[1:01:22] to feel good about it and feel good for
[1:01:24] their children
[1:01:26] so the children would be put down
[1:01:29] now friends
[1:01:30] is the word word a discerner of the
[1:01:32] times that we live in
[1:01:36] if we're not on the verge of
[1:01:39] us taking our promises i don't know what
[1:01:40] other day this is the day
[1:01:42] that we take our promise in jesus christ
[1:01:45] and go on to a rapture
[1:01:47] and we're fighting for it every day
[1:01:49] but you can see the influences of those
[1:01:52] that decide
[1:01:53] i'm happy right where i'm at in between
[1:01:56] not crossing over jordan but he said
[1:01:59] caleb back then caleb will go in and
[1:02:01] joshua will come in i'm going to close
[1:02:03] on this tonight why did why did caleb
[1:02:05] and joshua actually end up going in
[1:02:08] because
[1:02:09] they were positive in their confession
[1:02:11] even when they didn't know how they were
[1:02:13] going to do it themselves
[1:02:16] so in reality that's all god required of
[1:02:19] caleb and joshua it was a positive
[1:02:22] confession now friends we need to be
[1:02:24] more positive
[1:02:25] amen brother paul needs to be more
[1:02:28] positive
[1:02:29] you need to be more positive
[1:02:32] if you want to how many wants to be at
[1:02:33] joshua and caleb here tonight
[1:02:36] and when the devil defeats you say i
[1:02:37] can't do that i can't do that all god
[1:02:39] needs to hear is your positive
[1:02:41] confession to say this is all caleb went
[1:02:44] in for he hadn't even went into the
[1:02:45] promised land yet but he confessed and
[1:02:47] says we are well able to do it
[1:02:50] i don't know how we're going to do it
[1:02:51] but we're well able to do it and that's
[1:02:53] all i always like to tell the story that
[1:02:55] god's sitting there he's all god's just
[1:02:56] just kind of silent in it all and he's
[1:02:58] watched all these 10 other spies spend
[1:03:01] all this time being negative being
[1:03:03] negative we can't do it we can't do it
[1:03:05] and in discouraging the whole
[1:03:06] congregation everybody's low nobody's in
[1:03:09] the spirit of revival we can't go any
[1:03:11] further the church isn't going any
[1:03:12] further i imagine this god is just just
[1:03:14] bound his head and just shaking his head
[1:03:16] and all this because this is this is
[1:03:18] what he called him out of egypt for
[1:03:20] and he has to hear this
[1:03:23] we can't do it
[1:03:26] so he's got his head down and i just
[1:03:27] like to say he's just just kind of
[1:03:32] and all of a sudden
[1:03:33] the bible says that caleb stealed the
[1:03:35] people
[1:03:36] he said
[1:03:37] everybody shut up
[1:03:40] be quiet
[1:03:42] still the audience and says
[1:03:45] brothers we are well able to take the
[1:03:48] land
[1:03:49] and i think god perked up
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:53] and caleb kept talking and as caleb kept
[1:03:56] talking god just kind of stood up and
[1:03:58] said you know what
[1:04:00] that's what i need to hear
[1:04:03] if i hear that i can get them into all
[1:04:05] the promises
[1:04:07] they don't know how to do it because
[1:04:08] they can't do it on their own but if
[1:04:09] they'll give me that positive confession
[1:04:12] i believe i'll obey it i'll follow it we
[1:04:14] can do it can you say amen that's all
[1:04:16] caleb had to get the testimony that he
[1:04:19] wholly followed the lord and i'm not
[1:04:21] going to take the rest of those
[1:04:22] generations in but caleb and joshua i'm
[1:04:24] letting in you know what it was a
[1:04:26] positive confession
[1:04:28] faith faith and that's why he said in
[1:04:30] hebrews he says many of them didn't
[1:04:32] enter in not being mixed with faith in
[1:04:35] them that heard it
[1:04:36] they heard moses message they heard the
[1:04:38] truth they nodded to it it was all truth
[1:04:41] but not being mixed with faith in them
[1:04:44] that heard it
[1:04:46] if we have no faith with what we believe
[1:04:48] we can't move on to the promises
[1:04:52] god just stands and says that's what i'm
[1:04:55] looking for that's the confession that i
[1:04:57] need
[1:04:58] not just at church when brother paul's
[1:05:00] preaching and you get excited about it
[1:05:01] but those conf positive confessions
[1:05:04] coming out of daddy's lips coming out of
[1:05:07] mommy's lips coming out of a teenager it
[1:05:10] says i made a mistake last week but i
[1:05:12] put it under the blood and i'm more than
[1:05:14] able to get all the land that god has
[1:05:16] given me
[1:05:17] i will become what christ said i will
[1:05:20] become by the grace of god
[1:05:22] brother paul you're trying to make me a
[1:05:24] radical christian
[1:05:26] yeah
[1:05:28] it would be nice
[1:05:29] brother bram says i would have i would
[1:05:32] rather have wildfire than no fire at all
[1:05:36] that's what he said
[1:05:39] so i would rather have you get a little
[1:05:41] wild and passionate about god and act
[1:05:44] out of yourself a little bit
[1:05:46] than you have you go in the other way of
[1:05:48] cold and dead and formal and the devil's
[1:05:50] got his thumb on you all week long
[1:05:54] that's good that's not living in victory
[1:05:56] and that's not what god god's called you
[1:05:57] to
[1:05:59] see if i had the articulation if i had
[1:06:02] the way friends to describe what christ
[1:06:05] wants to mold into you and finish in
[1:06:07] this hour you
[1:06:09] what he wants you to become
[1:06:12] but i can't give you all those answers
[1:06:13] it's when you're getting in the word of
[1:06:14] god
[1:06:15] and you see your true biography
[1:06:17] you see your true life story you get out
[1:06:20] of the word you're going to start
[1:06:21] letting the devil interpret your
[1:06:22] biography
[1:06:24] you stand the word he'll tell you who
[1:06:26] you really are
[1:06:27] he'll tell you men how to be a real man
[1:06:30] he'll tell you husbands how to be a real
[1:06:31] leader of your home
[1:06:33] tell you wives how to be under
[1:06:34] subjection to your own husbands and how
[1:06:36] to live in that kind of faith can you
[1:06:37] say amen tell your children how to be
[1:06:39] underception how to be in a certain
[1:06:40] place and how to live in victory in
[1:06:42] those things he'll tell you when you
[1:06:44] stay in the word of god one of the
[1:06:46] things i've been rejoicing about lately
[1:06:47] you can stand with me one of the things
[1:06:49] that i've been rejoicing about so much
[1:06:50] lately is to see people get into the
[1:06:52] message of the hour
[1:06:54] and sending me quotes to encourage me
[1:06:58] praise the lord because they couldn't be
[1:07:00] sitting those things and finding many of
[1:07:02] them fighting such great things that the
[1:07:04] prophet said in the scriptures said
[1:07:06] unless i knew they were feeding on the
[1:07:07] word of god god put a hunger to feed on
[1:07:10] the promises of this day and for them to
[1:07:12] send me a text and me an email and to
[1:07:15] send me look at this look what brother
[1:07:16] bram said here look what the scripture
[1:07:18] said here look at this look at that i
[1:07:19] tell you friends that charges my heart i
[1:07:21] tell you i feel excited about that
[1:07:24] and the same way god got excited i
[1:07:26] believe about caleb's confession god
[1:07:28] gets just as excited about your
[1:07:30] confession when you're down in the dumps
[1:07:32] but you rise above it and say my god is
[1:07:34] able i am i am well able to take this
[1:07:37] land
[1:07:38] i am well able to become the christian
[1:07:40] that god's called me to become
[1:07:43] say with me i am able
[1:07:45] we are able
[1:07:47] we are well able
[1:07:50] to take the land

[1:09:43] sisters sisters and sister brothers and
[1:09:45] let's pray
[1:09:47] and instead of discouraging one another

[1:09:51] and in the lord heavenly father thank
[1:09:53] you for your word
[1:09:54] thank you for the promise lord that lays
[1:09:56] here in the discernment of the word that
