[1:24] have the camp piano player sister Lara
[1:29] come up here
[1:30] and uh help me with a
[1:33] song this song is very special because a
[1:36] long time ago when I was a young man
[1:39] like you or
[1:42] younger I was at lunch one day with
[1:44] brother random first visit in
[1:47] jonville and he said I want you to sing
[1:49] tonight in the Tabernacle me Baptist
[1:53] Tabernacle yeah that and I said what in
[1:56] the world would I sing I me I'm new here
[1:58] he said well we're going to have a
[2:00] prayer line tonight and so he said um
[2:02] it'd be nice if you could sing then
[2:04] Jesus came well we didn't sing that song
[2:06] in the Baptist Church you know but I
[2:09] learned it that day and he was very
[2:12] thankful he was proud that his daughter
[2:14] was playing it for the first time in
[2:15] church and tonight uh Laura and I would
[2:18] like to try to sing it for you
[2:24] [Music]
[2:33] one sat
[2:35] alone beside the highway
[2:39] be his eyes were
[2:42] blind the light he could not
[2:46] see he clutched his rags and shivered in
[2:51] the
[2:52] shadows then Jesus came and B his
[2:57] Darkness flee
[3:00] when Jesus comes the tempter's power is
[3:06] broken when Jesus comes the tears are
[3:11] wiped
[3:13] away he takes the Gloom and he fills the
[3:17] life with
[3:19] glory for all is changed when Jesus

[3:26] stay unclean unclean
[3:30] the leper cried in
[3:33] torment the death the dumb the lessness
[3:38] stood
[3:39] near the fever AG disease had stripped
[3:44] its
[3:46] victim then Jesus came and cast out
[3:51] every
[3:52] fear when Jesus comes the tempter's
[3:57] power is broken
[4:00] when Jesus comes the tears are wiped
[4:05] away he takes the gloom and he fills the
[4:09] life with
[4:11] glory for all is changed when Jesus
[4:16] comes to

[4:20] today have found the Savior
[4:24] able they could not coner passion lust
[4:29] and sin
[4:30] sin their broken hearts had left them
[4:34] sad and
[4:36] lonely then Jesus came and dwelt himself

[4:47] power is
[4:49] broken when Jesus comes temp wiped
[4:55] away he takes the Gloom and he fills the
[4:59] life with
[5:01] glory for all is changed when Jesus
[5:06] comes to
[5:08] stay
[5:10] amen thank
[5:17] you okay Jesus and three
[5:21] women let get this organized here a
[5:24] little
[5:25] better um scripture records many women
[5:31] follow Jesus they're all aware of that
[5:34] now we're in a Bible believing church
[5:36] right we're not following fables okay
[5:40] some of the women are named and many are
[5:42] not now thank God we have a Bible with
[5:46] details we have a detailed uh account of
[5:49] all these things and um we thank God
[5:54] that he has sent us a restoration
[5:56] Prophet as promised in scripture he was
[5:59] a Godly Man man he was a prophet he knew
[6:01] what he was talking about and God backed
[6:03] him up and so he's restored us back to
[6:06] the original Faith back to the original
[6:07] word and uh we have a sure word from God
[6:11] it's not fables it's a truth from God
[6:14] and uh it's not a matter of you know God
[6:16] God is Not Like Us well let's see if
[6:18] this will work you know uh I wonder if
[6:21] this will work this way no God is God
[6:24] and um he's perfect he knows the end
[6:27] from the beginning and
[6:30] God is always in balance and that's one
[6:32] of the reasons we carry this and we
[6:34] don't know if it's going to stay here
[6:36] first we got to check the pulpit yeah
[6:39] okay good show we're in good
[6:42] shape and so in the times of Jesus women
[6:46] did not commonly travel with a rabbi
[6:49] that's a religious teacher okay
[6:51] religious leader they had very strict
[6:54] codes of conduct back then that put a
[6:56] distance between women and the Jewish
[6:59] leaders
[7:00] so much so that by the time Jesus came
[7:02] along uh a rabbi was not even allowed to
[7:04] speak to his wife in
[7:06] public yeah imagine that she was back
[7:09] there about three steps with four kids
[7:12] and uh yeah they had some laws now these
[7:16] religious laws were put in place to
[7:20] ensure moral Purity but we've all become
[7:23] adults now and we know that there's no
[7:25] such laws
[7:26] work and so um
[7:30] the um uh the Jewish men in general and
[7:34] the teachers of the law in particular
[7:36] such as Jesus and Pharisees and those
[7:38] that you know knew the word they were to
[7:40] have as little to do with women as
[7:43] possible then Jesus came on the scene
[7:47] and it was in fulfillment of scripture
[7:49] and didn't just happen to be you know we
[7:52] have storms that come up and well they
[7:54] sometimes they predict them sometimes
[7:55] they don't know you know they come up
[7:57] well that's not the way the word works
[7:59] the Prophet said it and it comes to
[8:02] pass so not only did Jesus speak to
[8:05] women in public he dared to take them by
[8:07] the
[8:08] hand yeah I touched
[8:10] them and encouraged them to follow the
[8:13] truth and there's no indication anywhere
[8:16] that Jesus ever discouraged women from
[8:18] being his followers okay and um this
[8:21] probably offended many
[8:23] Jews and many people are offended in the
[8:26] 21st century when God blesses one of our
[8:30] ladies they're not second class citizens
[8:33] they are our sisters we're going to
[8:35] reign with them and they have a special
[8:37] place now when they get out of that
[8:39] place then we got a problem you know
[8:42] like you know other places so balance is
[8:47] not an option it's
[8:49] essential it's not a choice you must
[8:52] have balance now when you read the New
[8:55] Testament you're going to find that
[8:56] women listen carefully to his teachings
[9:01] I'd like to hear some of the women such
[9:02] as you say Amen just not that that's
[9:05] what we do in
[9:07] Tennessee uh the women accompanied him
[9:09] on his travels like we just read the
[9:12] women stood at the crucifixion where was
[9:14] The Mighty disciples only John was there
[9:17] the others are over there in the shade
[9:19] someplace you know barely hear their
[9:22] amen um women gave witness to the
[9:26] resurrection and they eventually helped
[9:28] spread the message throughout the Roman
[9:31] world we got a whole study on the book
[9:33] of Acts that shows that so in those
[9:37] days a long time ago long ways from here
[9:42] there was a Godly family that uh had
[9:45] their children and uh we're not going to
[9:48] call it Sunday school but they it wasn't
[9:50] invented till 1750 but they had Bible
[9:53] class at home they prayed they studied
[9:55] their scripture they you know had their
[9:57] devotions and um they followed Prophet
[10:00] Moses as close as they could they
[10:02] learned to quote his words walking in
[10:05] the truth of the hour as they saw it and
[10:08] uh but one day one of the girls in the
[10:12] family uh began to have be friends with
[10:16] some of the other girls in the
[10:17] neighborhood they weren't quite as Godly
[10:20] let's say and they began to
[10:23] um uh fill her ahead with some other
[10:26] ideas and wear the shirt the skirts a
[10:28] little shorter
[10:29] and uh have different
[10:31] friends and um very different from the
[10:34] teachings at home okay and Satan drove
[10:39] the
[10:40] wedge and she began walking another path
[10:43] away from the truth that she had learned
[10:45] at
[10:46] home maybe several years we don't know
[10:50] but one day case number one how many
[10:53] women three okay let see if everybody's
[10:56] awake
[10:59] and so case number one is John 4 and
[11:02] verse
[11:03] three if you got your Bible be sure and
[11:06] look it up because you never know a
[11:08] preacher sometimes get mixed
[11:11] up John CH
[11:14] 4:3
[11:18] um uh Jesus is uh departing from Galilee
[11:22] says there in verse three he left Judea
[11:24] and departed unto Galilee so he's going
[11:26] north okay and verse four and he must
[11:29] needs go through Samaria wonder why CU
[11:32] he had a vision from the father there's
[11:35] a sheep over there it needs attention so
[11:37] you need to stop over there on your way
[11:40] and so um uh this is probably the the
[11:43] one person that's mentioned more than
[11:46] anybody else in the Bible by William
[11:48] Brandon he always comes back to the
[11:50] woman at the well one way or another and
[11:53] so he needed to go
[11:55] there and so from Jerusalem to sikar is
[11:59] about about 32 miles he arrives about
[12:01] noon see verse 5 then he came to the
[12:04] city of Samaria which is called sikar
[12:07] near the parcel of ground uh that Jacob
[12:10] gave to his
[12:11] son now Jacob's Well was there and guess
[12:15] what it's still there yeah from Genesis
[12:17] 22 it's still there I've been there once
[12:20] because there's some troublemakers
[12:22] around there they don't like tourists so
[12:24] the well was still there and um he was
[12:27] wearied from his journey sat next to the
[12:30] well and it was about the 6th hour and
[12:32] we're not going to argue too long about
[12:33] what time it was prophet said it was
[12:35] about noon time he's hungry he's tired
[12:38] he's sitting there he sent the disciples
[12:39] into town to get some
[12:41] sandwiches and so all of a sudden there
[12:44] comes a woman of Samaria to draw water
[12:47] and Jesus didn't not waste any time hey
[12:50] how are you how's Grandma no give me a
[12:52] drink all of a sudden okay so he knew
[12:56] what the rules were like we just
[12:58] mentioned
[12:59] and um he uh he knew exactly what he was
[13:02] doing okay now the honorable women such
[13:05] as you ladies would come in the early
[13:08] morning or in the evening see they
[13:11] didn't have faucets back
[13:13] then you had to go out there maybe three
[13:16] blocks or a half a mile or whatever get
[13:18] the water bring it in you used it very
[13:20] carefully and so uh the the the women
[13:24] such as this lady here this woman at the
[13:26] point at this point um they would have
[13:29] to go in the middle of the day when it's
[13:31] 100° yeah because she was a prostitute
[13:36] okay and so uh he's there waiting you
[13:40] know for the guys to come back with the
[13:42] lunch and she comes out give me a drink
[13:45] and so um the disciples were gone and
[13:49] they had segregation verse 9 and he said
[13:52] to the woman of Samaria and the woman
[13:55] the woman of Samaria said to him how is
[13:57] it that you being a Jew ask a drink of
[13:59] me and I'm a woman of Samaria Jews have
[14:01] no dealings with the
[14:03] Samaritans and so Jesus was the one he
[14:06] he he was the bridge okay he formed the
[14:08] bridge he served as a bridge he came
[14:10] open a new way everyone was welcome to
[14:14] participate he that turned the world
[14:16] upside down and that's why we call it
[14:17] 2022 because from his life this way it's
[14:20] one set of numbers back there it's
[14:23] another set of numbers this turned
[14:25] everything upside
[14:26] down and so um
[14:29] the bridge is very accurately described
[14:32] in in John 3:16 right across the page uh
[14:35] where he says that um God so loved the
[14:40] world now see that's the Pope's favorite
[14:42] scripture right there one of them and
[14:45] but that's as far as he goes see that he
[14:48] he loved the world so much he gave his
[14:49] only begotten son that whosoever
[14:51] believeth on him should not perish but
[14:54] have everlasting life for God sent not
[14:56] his son into the world to condemn the
[14:57] world but the world through him might be
[15:00] saved he that believeth on him is not
[15:02] condemned but he that believeth not is
[15:05] condemned already why because he didn't
[15:08] believe in what in the name of the only
[15:11] begotten Son of God okay so there's no
[15:15] discrimination God loved the whole world
[15:17] the whole world is willing to follow
[15:19] though so this way is only for serious
[15:22] Believers it's not for agnostics it's
[15:24] not for people looking for fault and all
[15:26] that it's no it's not for doubters and
[15:28] markers agnostics and uh it's not a game
[15:32] it's not a religion in case you hadn't
[15:33] noticed so far but it's a only path to
[15:36] eternal life and the only way you're
[15:38] going to get to heaven is start at the
[15:40] foot of the cross it doesn't matter who
[15:42] your daddy is who your grandpa was what
[15:44] your name is no you got to start at the
[15:45] foot of the cross we all have same start
[15:47] at the same place in the message we have
[15:50] found him 1954 Jesus Christ came here on
[15:52] Earth and he talked to a woman at the
[15:54] well which was a Samaritan and him being
[15:56] a Jew just a difference in race and he
[15:59] let him know right quick there was no
[16:00] difference in the races God was seeking
[16:02] those that would worship Him in spirit
[16:04] and in truth so they had segregation no
[16:07] dealings no Fellowship but Jesus was the
[16:09] way maker he was the bridge verse
[16:13] 10 and Jesus after she you know come up
[16:16] with this business about no dealings he
[16:18] says if you knew the gift of
[16:21] God and who it is that says to thee give
[16:24] me a drink you would ask him and he
[16:27] would give you uh The Living Water Well
[16:31] he goes on talking about water extending
[16:33] the conversation and all the time he's
[16:35] Discerning her case you see and finally
[16:38] down verse 15 she responds and she said
[16:41] well sir give me this water that I
[16:43] thirst not neither have to come clear
[16:45] out here to get the water and um and
[16:48] then he got straight to the point verse
[16:51] 16 go call your husband and come
[16:56] here ah he does hit the sore point you
[17:00] know now our sister because she's she
[17:04] wasn't then she was just prostitute but
[17:07] she became our sister and we don't know
[17:09] her name but when we get there we'll
[17:10] find out so our sister was probably very
[17:14] beautiful now we're not going to dwell
[17:16] on the fact that there are some that are
[17:18] more beautiful than others but that's
[17:19] beside the point but she was probably
[17:22] very beautiful and she had no trouble
[17:24] attracting men that wasn't her problem
[17:27] her problem was keeping the
[17:30] man she was thirsting for something she
[17:33] didn't know how to satisfy that Godly
[17:35] thirst see because nothing else will
[17:37] satisfy you can buy cars you can do all
[17:40] these things only God can satisfy that
[17:43] thirst and um and just the night before
[17:46] she had attracted this last one and she
[17:48] wasn't too sure about him now that's on
[17:50] tape okay verse 17 and the woman
[17:54] answered and said I have a husband and
[17:57] Jesus said youve told the truth
[17:59] that you have no husband for you honey
[18:02] have had five and the one you have now
[18:04] isn't yours so you spoke the truth oh
[18:09] now she's totally uncovered can't hide
[18:11] nothing from this guy yeah and verse 19
[18:15] and the woman said sir I perceive that
[18:17] you are a
[18:18] prophet so she goes into her Declaration
[18:21] of her belief verse 20 and the
[18:23] differences that they had so because
[18:25] when he spoke to her telling her about
[18:27] her past and her present and so forth
[18:30] and all these details it probably made
[18:32] her very
[18:33] uncomfortable now I'm one of the few
[18:36] eyewitnesses left and it's a great
[18:37] responsibility and people oh how is it
[18:40] well sometimes it was uncomfortable
[18:42] being around William Brandon you know a
[18:43] man can see right through you you can't
[18:45] come up with some
[18:47] story got to tell the truth and so she
[18:50] was probably quite uncomfortable at this
[18:52] point and so um she goes immediately
[18:55] into her uh defense and her ideas of of
[18:58] race and religion because the Samaritans
[19:01] were experts on
[19:03] defense why because right near where
[19:06] they were
[19:07] standing was Mount ebal okay it's in
[19:11] scripture Moses commanded enough when
[19:13] you all get into the holy land when you
[19:15] get into the promised land he built an
[19:16] altar commemorating you know the Victory
[19:18] and got in and so forth and that's where
[19:20] Joshua renewed The Covenant with God in
[19:23] Joshua chapter 8 but the Samaritans had
[19:26] a different idea yeah just like today
[19:29] William Bram said this yeah but I think
[19:31] this over here might work a little
[19:32] better well I'm here to tell you it
[19:34] won't better stick with what he said and
[19:37] so nearby was Mount gasim and to them
[19:41] that was the M that was a place of
[19:43] worship and they built an
[19:45] altar um in 400 BC but 272 years later
[19:50] the Jews destroyed that altar on on
[19:52] Mount garison bringing you know greater
[19:54] enmity between the two groups so the
[19:57] woman at the well had plenty of
[19:58] ammunition
[19:59] and she didn't mind using it on this
[20:01] stranger okay but he calmed her down
[20:04] verse 21 woman believe me the hour
[20:08] cometh when you shall neither in this
[20:10] mountain nor at Jerusalem worship the
[20:13] father you guys worship what you don't
[20:16] even know uh we know what we worship
[20:18] because salvation of the Jews but the
[20:20] hour is coming when uh and now is when
[20:24] the true worshippers shall worship the
[20:26] father in spirit and in truth for the
[20:31] father seeketh such to worship him God
[20:32] is a spirit and they that worship Him
[20:35] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[20:38] balanced you can have a lot of spirit as
[20:41] long as all this music's going oh man
[20:42] about to tear the place down they do
[20:44] that in these churches not too far from
[20:46] here or you can have a lot of Truth and
[20:50] Freeze ice cubes on the seats it's got
[20:53] to be
[20:55] balanced okay it's not rocket science I
[20:58] I figured it out and
[21:01] so
[21:03] um uh spirit and the truth the woman
[21:05] said to him I know the messiah's coming
[21:09] which is called Christ when he comes
[21:11] he'll tell us all these things H Jesus
[21:15] said I that speak to thee am he now why
[21:18] would she come up with this line here
[21:20] that when the Messiah come and so forth
[21:22] because back there at home she had paid
[21:24] attention to bible class they had taught
[21:27] her the truth and part of it was lodged
[21:29] up here and she we don't know how long
[21:32] she's on this detour and we don't know
[21:33] why it's none of our business but she
[21:36] was in front of the Fountain of Truth
[21:38] and she recognized it so she' paid
[21:40] attention and some of it was lodged in
[21:42] her memory and she had been a long time
[21:44] on this detour all she KN needed was an
[21:47] encounter with the Fountain of
[21:50] Truth she had a correct Spirit she not
[21:53] did not reject him her spirit was right
[21:55] all she needed was more truth
[21:58] that's what some of our relatives and
[21:59] some of our neighbors need you know they
[22:01] they they there's good Catholics there's
[22:03] good all kinds of people they just need
[22:06] presented correctly you see okay so she
[22:10] had representation in heaven she was an
[22:13] elect seat of God and once she got a
[22:15] small drink of that special water it was
[22:18] all over she became an
[22:21] overcomer brother Bram says just take a
[22:23] drink from there from the Everlasting
[22:25] water ever everpresent water you'll
[22:27] never have to hear another sermon on
[22:29] morals how to dress how to act how to
[22:32] conduct yourself but you got to
[22:34] participate you can't come in here and
[22:36] get the free air conditioning and go out
[22:38] and play talk about NASCAR you got to
[22:40] participate and get involved you see and
[22:44] be responsible that too many people hear
[22:46] the word all they hear it it goes round
[22:48] and round and they never take a drink
[22:51] that's the problem they don't actually
[22:53] participate and take responsibility of
[22:56] manifesting what they heard
[22:59] because your life speaks louder than
[23:01] your words it doesn't matter what you
[23:04] say most of us have raised little
[23:06] children and and it doesn't matter
[23:08] really what you say it's how you say it
[23:11] it's how you approach the problem you
[23:13] see and um I don't know if any of you
[23:17] was raised Catholic but in the Catholic
[23:19] Church they have a lot of saints and you
[23:21] know famous people well one of is
[23:22] Francis of AIS he was a Italian priest
[23:25] about 900 years ago and brother Brandon
[23:28] said he was a gospel preacher so we'll
[23:29] just take his word for that and so
[23:32] Francis of AIS uh said one time that um
[23:36] he said you need to preach
[23:38] always use words when
[23:40] necessary well how does that work well
[23:43] William Brandon gave you the 21st
[23:44] century version he says live your
[23:47] message yeah so it doesn't matter what
[23:50] you you know what you talk it's how you
[23:54] live so after she participated after she
[23:57] you know re received she understood
[23:59] didn't take 3 months it was instantly uh
[24:02] the woman at the well was instantly
[24:03] turned into a lady a lady with something
[24:06] to
[24:06] tell okay she took one drink from the
[24:09] inexhaustible Fountain of Living Water
[24:12] Prophet says over here in a man running
[24:13] from the presence of the
[24:15] Lord um and let me just tell you
[24:18] something about that message that's
[24:20] February 17th of
[24:22] 65 um brother Brandon had promised for
[24:25] some time I'm going to be in
[24:26] Jeffersonville we're going to preach on
[24:27] the what's it the and divorce and so
[24:29] he'd been promising okay so February you
[24:32] know L later half of of February of 65
[24:35] so the kids are School in Tucson so he
[24:38] drives by himself gets in station wagon
[24:41] takes off it's about 32 hours he didn't
[24:44] get a motel get tired he stop take a
[24:47] power nap for about 20 minutes and go on
[24:49] so he gets to jonville real early on a
[24:52] Wednesday
[24:53] morning services are going to be
[24:55] Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday and he's
[24:58] prepared for four Services well he gets
[25:00] there Sunday uh Wednesday morning and he
[25:03] um uh uh thought well I can't sit up
[25:07] here at the church you know here at the
[25:08] house down there at church all the
[25:10] people are gathered getting ready for
[25:11] the service I'll go down and get some
[25:12] inspiration well he goes
[25:15] in brother Neville saw him coming in Hey
[25:18] Brother Bill come here well he's got
[25:21] nothing he's not prepared and he
[25:24] preaches that great message a man
[25:25] running from the presence of the Lord
[25:27] okay so in the prayer he says let the
[25:29] great holy spirit that came down on the
[25:31] mountain the other day there Tucson um
[25:34] saturate every heart in here with his
[25:36] goodness and mercy with understanding we
[25:38] realize father that's what we need is to
[25:41] understand for if we do not know what
[25:43] we're doing then how do we know how to
[25:45] do it wish I could come up with
[25:47] questions like that you know but we must
[25:50] have understanding as Daniel said he had
[25:52] understanding by the prophet Jeremiah's
[25:53] writing and father we have understanding
[25:55] by the holy spirit's writing as he will
[25:57] reveal to us in this hour I mean there's
[26:00] so much right there in that one prayer
[26:02] preached for a
[26:03] week as we have as he will reveal it to
[26:07] us we don't know everything there is to
[26:09] know we know enough to get to church now
[26:12] get home we know how to do certain
[26:14] things but as we have need he will
[26:16] reveal it to us you know the five and
[26:19] six year olds we're not going to give
[26:20] them the keys to the car although they'd
[26:21] like to have it when they have need
[26:24] it'll be revealed and so if I could
[26:26] prove to you how deep or how thick the
[26:29] uh the streets of gold are what good
[26:31] would it do it's only for those that get
[26:34] there so all the things on the other
[26:36] side of the Resurrection it's only for
[26:37] those that get there so let's just get
[26:39] there you
[26:41] know so over here in 2022 those that
[26:45] love the Lord Jesus which Narrows down
[26:47] pretty much you know they have
[26:49] understanding by the words of prophet
[26:51] William brandham because in the days of
[26:53] the voice okay and um it's the only one
[26:55] of all the messengers that's recorded
[26:57] rest of them are written and even back
[26:59] then people a lot of people couldn't
[27:00] read so the true minister of today says
[27:03] what's already been said not a private
[27:06] interpretation no opinions no
[27:08] explanations we don't need all that
[27:09] stuff just let it live out naturally so
[27:12] the woman at the well is case number one
[27:14] she came in contact with the author of
[27:16] Life took one drink of the water and
[27:18] instantly turned into a lady and then
[27:20] she ran to tell others see she got into
[27:23] action and um she couldn't keep it to
[27:26] herself okay
[27:28] case number two we got till 10 o00
[27:32] right you'll stay awake
[27:39] right okay case number two John chapter
[27:42] 8 go over a couple Pages I'm just uh
[27:46] just kidding you John chapter 8 uh verse
[27:50] one Jesus went into the Mount of Olives
[27:53] wait a minute where was he oh look at
[27:54] the verse before that verse 53 and every
[27:57] man went to his own house and guess what
[27:59] Jesus didn't have a house no and Jesus
[28:03] went into the Mount of Olives what's he
[28:05] doing over there well back then and we
[28:09] got to just take some time explain this
[28:11] see back then it's called Mount of
[28:12] Olives because it was all olive trees
[28:15] okay they they they harvested them and
[28:17] they weren't harvesting for the pizza
[28:18] they were harvesting for lights they
[28:19] didn't have these kind of lights so they
[28:21] harvest the the the the olives and they
[28:24] would squeeze them out big Stones not
[28:27] only the the the the Flesh of the olive
[28:29] but the seed you know it's as hard as
[28:31] this desk they would get all the oil out
[28:36] and they would process it come into a
[28:37] little little thing and that was their
[28:39] light so that's they had a it was a
[28:40] business so wherever they had olive
[28:42] trees there was an olive press there
[28:45] someplace because they didn't have
[28:47] trucks to carry it way off like they do
[28:50] today and so on the Mount of Olives he
[28:53] wasn't sleeping under the trees there
[28:55] was a place where they would go and I
[28:58] think less than 200 years ago they found
[29:00] the cave on Mount of Olives where
[29:02] there's the olive press and sometimes
[29:05] when we go over there we can visit there
[29:07] maybe even have a service there okay so
[29:10] he's over there in this cave they're
[29:11] spending the night and early in the
[29:13] morning came again to the temple that's
[29:15] about 600 yards away and all the people
[29:19] which a group of Believers this wasn't
[29:21] everybody a group of Believers um he sat
[29:24] down and taught them okay so here here's
[29:28] Jesus early morning church maybe before
[29:30] breakfast sitting down there teaching a
[29:33] crowd of people and a group of very
[29:36] arrogant Pharisees showed up appeared on
[29:40] the scene with a woman no doubt had her
[29:43] by the hand you know she wasn't going to
[29:45] get loose and um drug her in there she
[29:48] wasn't dressed well she was hair wasn't
[29:50] combed and they interrupt the
[29:53] teacher they put her right in the middle
[29:55] of of what's going on and they posed a
[29:57] loaded question and see each one of them
[30:00] probably had a few rocks in their pocket
[30:02] cuz they meant business okay and um and
[30:05] they're very legal very ready to judge
[30:08] verse four where it says that um and
[30:12] they said unto Master this woman was
[30:14] taken in adultery in the very act now
[30:16] Prophet Moses blessed the Lord the law
[30:19] commanded us that such should be
[30:22] stoned what do you say so trying to
[30:24] drive a wedge they trying to make him
[30:26] look small somehow well first of all
[30:29] they're only half right because Moses
[30:31] said bring both of them and stone them
[30:32] well they only got the woman okay so
[30:34] we're already you know 50% off and um
[30:40] and so what happens here you know their
[30:42] job was to make Jesus look bad so he
[30:44] acts like he doesn't hear what you know
[30:46] he just kind of ignores him he goes down
[30:48] starts writing in the sand now we don't
[30:49] know what he wrote okay we're not going
[30:50] to argue about that goes down rights in
[30:53] the sand they probably thought he's down
[30:55] there looking for some rocks to help him
[30:57] yeah
[30:58] and um so when they finished talking he
[31:01] stands up he heard everything and he
[31:04] looked around he said well I'll tell you
[31:05] what guys the one of you that doesn't
[31:07] have one sin you never stole a pet of
[31:11] bread you never stole a cookie you never
[31:14] looked wrong at a woman you throw the
[31:15] first
[31:17] rock H scripture says in verse 9 and
[31:22] they which heard it being convicted by
[31:24] their own conscience went out one by one
[31:27] beginning at the eldest to the last and
[31:30] there's Jesus alone with the woman
[31:31] standing in the midst
[31:34] so um in verse 10 and Jesus when he
[31:39] lifted up because he went back down you
[31:40] know while they were deciding um he saw
[31:44] only the woman he said theom where
[31:46] where's your accusers does no man
[31:48] condemn thee she said no man Lord and
[31:50] Jesus said neither do I condemn thee go
[31:52] and sin No
[31:54] More Jesus has forgiveness it doesn't
[31:57] matter how how far you went or how far
[31:59] you ran he has forgiveness you see so by
[32:03] discernment he was able to see her
[32:04] entire life neither do I condemn you so
[32:07] once again a woman received life from
[32:09] the
[32:10] lifegiver now this is just basic
[32:13] scripture this isn't you know bringing
[32:14] Heaven down just get in your Bible
[32:17] that's the problem I find in my travels
[32:19] people don't read their Bible the the
[32:22] promise was I'm going to send you uh
[32:25] Prophet Elijah is going to turn your
[32:26] head your heart back we get into the
[32:29] book that he opened
[32:31] up so she went away turned into a real
[32:35] lady she went away hope live a new life
[32:37] but you see history repeats religious
[32:39] leaders precise keepers of the prophetic
[32:42] word had a lot of Truth oh they were
[32:44] just you know 100% truth all kinds of
[32:47] truth but no spirit in fact they had a
[32:50] bad Spirit arrogant selfish full of
[32:53] Pride demeaning always pointing the
[32:56] finger at somebody that wasn't following
[32:58] it exactly the way thought they thought
[32:59] thought it should be we still got them
[33:02] today they were the epitome of arrogance
[33:05] so our Prophet says that I would rather
[33:08] be wrong in my Doctrine but right in my
[33:11] heart than be right in my Doctrine and
[33:14] wrong in my heart because if you're
[33:16] right in your heart you will end up at
[33:17] the right Doctrine but if you got the
[33:19] doctrine so perfect you might never get
[33:22] to the right Spirit see so may God help
[33:25] us so spirit and truth they must have
[33:29] balance Prophet says over here in early
[33:32] experiences 1952 some people when they
[33:34] get born again they sit right in the
[33:36] middle of the road Eyes On Christ
[33:39] finally they get way over here so much
[33:40] knowledge and wisdom oh they know it all
[33:42] and you don't know nothing and if they
[33:44] don't do that they go clear the other
[33:45] side wildfire and fanaticism that's
[33:49] right we're right in the middle of the
[33:50] road there's the true sound
[33:52] unadulterated gospel and power of God
[33:55] that's balance okay
[33:58] now so we must find balance we'll get it
[34:02] here in a little bit recently Pope
[34:05] Francis said we have to find a new
[34:07] balance now see that sounds good sounds
[34:09] compassionate God loves everybody but
[34:12] the balance we need is right here in
[34:14] God's word just get in here you know and
[34:18] and you know I I I hate to keep picking
[34:20] on him but you know he's got a very
[34:22] important position now how did he get
[34:24] there not knowing the Bible we assume he
[34:27] knows Bible better than anybody well
[34:28] that's not true
[34:30] okay so everything we say or do is
[34:33] governed by a spirit either God or Satan
[34:36] see brother Bram says you follow the
[34:38] scriptures and see if the spirit follows
[34:39] the scripture any spirit that does not
[34:42] follow the scripture is a wrong
[34:45] Spirit Well that's you know easy to
[34:48] follow so moving on to case number three
[34:52] Luke chapter 7 let's go back here just a
[34:55] little bit Luke chapter 7 is where Jesus
[34:59] is preaching and praying for the sick
[35:01] and I need a little bit of a prop here
[35:05] um yeah we
[35:07] uh should have done this before but see
[35:11] Jesus was moving around and preaching
[35:13] and praying for the sick in a lot of
[35:14] places right and so a a messenger comes
[35:18] to him and he says you know down there
[35:21] where I come from in Jerusalem is uh
[35:23] Simon and he's a rich man he's going to
[35:25] have a big party and he wants you to be
[35:28] there sir well Jesus knew what he was
[35:30] doing he said I'll be there it's right
[35:32] there in chapter 7 they didn't have cell
[35:34] phones if you had somebody you wanted
[35:36] somebody to know something over in you
[35:38] know Cleveland you had to go over there
[35:40] or send somebody with a note there was
[35:42] no no phones so Jesus arrived on time
[35:46] but he wasn't welcome imagine that how
[35:48] could that possibly be well one thing he
[35:50] didn't have the light over him like you
[35:52] know the Romans painted it he was just
[35:54] dressed like the rest of us and so he
[35:56] come somehow he got got in uh he wasn't
[35:59] welcomed he's sitting over there by
[36:01] himself excuse me and
[36:04] uh so the um the uh Pharisee he prepared
[36:08] a big Feast of course brother Bram
[36:10] dramatized it you know and they had uh
[36:13] it was outside and they had the smokes
[36:15] going over the fence and everybody's you
[36:18] know going by and smelling oh wow enough
[36:21] meat to feed the whole village so Jesus
[36:23] on time and uh the Romans going over the
[36:27] in the the town and people passing by
[36:30] they would peek through the little hole
[36:31] in the wall and see what's going on oh
[36:33] yeah another Feast well one
[36:35] insignificant woman came by and she
[36:38] looked through the little hole in the
[36:39] wall and she looked and somehow she
[36:42] recognized that's Jesus sitting over
[36:44] there now she had heard about her friend
[36:46] up at the temple case number two see
[36:49] that had been healed of her you know
[36:51] problem being prostitute turned into a
[36:53] nice lady she had a nice family had a
[36:55] nice house she'd heard and now she sees
[36:59] there's Jesus H and um and and she even
[37:04] noticed that he had Dirty
[37:06] Feet now you wonder how is that possible
[37:09] well guess what I was over in
[37:11] Africa well it's been about 10 years now
[37:14] andan I mean there's not even 100 people
[37:17] here but over there there's 6,000 people
[37:19] okay they don't speak English so here we
[37:22] were preaching with the translator soon
[37:24] as I got done Pastor jumps up and he
[37:26] says now we don't I don't know when
[37:27] brother George is coming back but has
[37:30] anybody got a
[37:31] question what can you
[37:34] imagine so these questions come up they
[37:37] got to be translated then translate the
[37:39] answer well this goes on and on you know
[37:41] all they have is time where they going
[37:43] to go 6,000 people and there's there's
[37:46] 12 cars outside and you know and about
[37:49] 100 motorcycles and 300 bicycles
[37:52] everybody else walked well anyway so so
[37:54] this goes on and on and so the only
[37:56] question I remember remember I know it's
[37:58] pretty lame of me but the only question
[38:00] I remember uh this one sister said well
[38:03] since the Lord took your wife while you
[38:05] still wearing the
[38:06] ring wow people notice everything man
[38:10] you
[38:11] know so so this well I told her I said
[38:15] because my commitment to Rebecca wasn't
[38:16] until death do his part it's for
[38:18] eternity oh okay well satisfied them so
[38:23] this lady she's looking through the wall
[38:25] she sees the dirty feet how is is this
[38:27] possible she had heard about her friend
[38:30] and she she knew how that Jesus had
[38:33] forgiven her and changed her life and
[38:36] she thought this is my only opportunity
[38:38] this is never going to repeat you know
[38:41] chances that are very very small and so
[38:44] she um uh what' she do she got into
[38:47] action right now she got into action and
[38:50] it was her only opportunity what' she do
[38:52] she ran home and she got into the
[38:54] mattress and got her money and she goes
[38:56] down to the drug store store and when
[38:58] the drugas are coming what do you want
[39:00] here well I come to make a purchase okay
[39:03] come on in and she said now look we
[39:06] heard that way up on that shelf you got
[39:08] a Alabaster Box and you got some got
[39:10] some real special ointment oh honey that
[39:13] cost money and so she got her money out
[39:17] of course being good Jew you know he
[39:18] counted it three times okay I guess I
[39:20] got to sell it to you so he gets it down
[39:23] and he gets it to
[39:25] her and so she
[39:28] rushes back to the party and somehow she
[39:30] got in without being noticed too there
[39:32] must have been you know having a lot of
[39:34] noise or something so we're in chapter 7
[39:37] of Luke and verse
[39:41] 38 okay she's at the Pharisees house
[39:44] she's got the alabaster box and she
[39:46] stood At His Feet behind him weeping and
[39:48] began to wash his feet with tears and
[39:50] wiped the tears with the hairs of her
[39:52] head and kissed his feet and anointed
[39:54] them with the ointment now you read that
[39:58] you know at least 100 times so most of
[40:00] the paintings that we have of Jesus and
[40:04] the disciples you know at the supper
[40:06] they're sitting in chairs the way we do
[40:08] you know the big table but those are
[40:10] painted that was painted by Italian
[40:11] artist hundreds of years later the fact
[40:14] of the matter is back then the table was
[40:16] that you know right down there that was
[40:19] the table and so they were sitting on
[40:20] carpet or or cushions or something so
[40:22] they're sitting down like
[40:24] this and you know eating and his feet
[40:27] are behind him it said right there she
[40:30] stood At His Feet behind him washing his
[40:32] feet that doesn't happen the way we sit
[40:35] and that's why it says that okay and so
[40:39] um they um she's there washing his
[40:44] feet and verse 39 and when the Pharisee
[40:48] which invited him saw this he thought in
[40:51] his you know mind this man if he was a
[40:55] prophet he would know what kind of a
[40:57] sorry person that is and she's touching
[40:59] him she's a
[41:00] sinner you see these kind of people that
[41:02] we're talking about we probably wouldn't
[41:04] let them in well we probably let him in
[41:05] your church but a lot of churches
[41:07] wouldn't let him in you see she's a
[41:10] sinner well how'd she get in your place
[41:13] in the first place and Jesus said un
[41:15] Simon so he you know discerned him right
[41:17] away Simon I've got a little something I
[41:19] want to tell
[41:20] you well Simon's thinking man he's going
[41:22] to bless me for all this expense you
[41:24] know because all this meat I bought and
[41:26] everything you know
[41:27] and he says Master say on you know so he
[41:30] gives him a little story you know he
[41:32] says he there was this banker and he had
[41:34] two debtors and they had no money one
[41:35] owed him 500 and the other owed him
[41:37] 50 and uh when the banker saw that they
[41:40] couldn't pay well he you know he forgave
[41:42] both of them so tell me
[41:44] Simon which of those do you think loved
[41:47] him the
[41:47] most now all the eyes are on Simon oh
[41:50] he's got to come up with the right
[41:52] answer so he says well I suppose um that
[41:56] he to to whom he forgave the most and he
[42:00] said the right answer you judged
[42:03] right pressures off you know he got the
[42:06] gold
[42:07] star
[42:09] yeah and
[42:10] so
[42:13] um and so then he turns to the woman he
[42:16] hasn't he she's just back there he
[42:18] didn't pay any attention to her yet so
[42:20] he turns to the woman but he's still
[42:22] talking to Simon you see this woman I
[42:25] came into your house you gave me no
[42:27] water for my feet but she's been washing
[42:30] my feet with her tears and she's wiped
[42:33] them with her long curly hair yeah I
[42:35] know we're gramz a little bit and uh you
[42:38] gave me no kiss but This Woman's been
[42:40] kissing my feet you know and uh you gave
[42:44] me no oil for my head but this woman is
[42:47] Anointed my feet with ointment and KN he
[42:50] knew exactly how much she paid and so
[42:52] forth and she said wherefore I say unto
[42:55] thee so he's looking at her he's talking
[42:57] to Simon her sins which are many are
[43:00] forgiven because she loved much but to
[43:03] whom little Is Forgiven the same uh
[43:07] loveth little
[43:09] which kind of infers that that's Simon
[43:11] you know and he said unto her thy sins
[43:14] are forgiven that's all he said to her
[43:17] four words in our
[43:18] language and um and all these other
[43:21] people sitting there you know
[43:24] feasting who's this That Forgives sins
[43:27] also and he said to the woman your faith
[43:30] has safy go in peace her life changed
[43:35] you see Simon the very important
[43:37] Pharisee had memorized a lot of the
[43:39] Torah he knew
[43:42] truth because see in Acts
[43:45] 15 it tells us that every Sabbath they
[43:49] read a portion of their spoken word book
[43:50] of Moses this last Saturday when you
[43:53] were having a big time down there well
[43:55] the the the the Jews had their service
[43:57] on Saturday around the world and they
[44:00] read a portion of Moses their spoken
[44:03] word book so he knew a lot of that see
[44:06] and um memorized a lot of truth but he
[44:09] had no Revelation no spirit so he wasn't
[44:12] balance she's all you know and um and so
[44:17] the woman with all her baggage she had
[44:19] the right spirit and that Spirit took
[44:21] her to the truth and Jesus said thy
[44:24] faith has saved thee go in peace she was
[44:27] completely
[44:28] changed and God is still in the life
[44:32] changing business today for any age no
[44:36] matter where you've been what you've
[44:37] done there's hope I know people that
[44:40] have been to the to the worst of the
[44:43] worst of the worst and God has changed
[44:46] them it's a change in Attitude a change
[44:48] of life I mean Billy Graham preached it
[44:51] all the time William Brandon preached it
[44:53] you see yeah but I'm not as bad as those
[44:55] people I live clean really you're still
[44:58] a filthy sinner you still need to come
[45:00] to the foot of the cross so um if you
[45:04] don't you will be left behind it's Bible
[45:08] but you see the church is like a
[45:10] hospital no there's nobody checking
[45:12] papers at the door there's no credit
[45:13] card machine out there you know it's
[45:15] like a hospital and the great physician
[45:18] is still in business Jesus said I'm the
[45:21] way the truth and the life all you have
[45:24] to say is yes Lord I'll follow I'll drop
[45:27] all my crazy ideas and I'll follow you
[45:30] it's real simple so these are only three
[45:34] examples of many people that Jesus had
[45:36] to deal with because he uh he uh had a
[45:41] long Ministry and John said over here in
[45:44] in John
[45:46] 21:25 and there are also many other
[45:49] things which Jesus did which if they
[45:52] should be written everyone I suppose
[45:54] that even in the world they could not
[45:56] contain the books that should be written
[45:59] in three and A2 years so these are just
[46:01] three examples the way the TR the truth
[46:05] and the life in Matthew
[46:07] 25:37 he's uh Jesus is you know still
[46:11] answering the questions of of of of
[46:13] Matthew 24 and he says over
[46:16] here in um where we at in
[46:20] 2537 that
[46:22] um he's
[46:24] uh he's telling him about the kingom of
[46:27] God in verse 37 then shall the righteous
[46:30] answer it saying Lord um when do we see
[46:35] you hungry and fed thee or thirsty and
[46:37] give you drink when do we when do we see
[46:40] you as a stranger took you in or naked
[46:42] and gave you clothes or when do we see
[46:44] you sick and so forth and the King shall
[46:46] answer and say verily I say unto you in
[46:49] as much as you have done this unto one
[46:51] of the least of these my brethren you've
[46:54] done it unto
[46:55] me that's part of the Gospel also and so
[46:59] he's not talking about second graders or
[47:01] third graders he's talking about people
[47:03] that are less fortunate than us see
[47:06] everybody doesn't have a nice building
[47:08] like this everybody doesn't have
[47:10] $440,000 car like we have you know and
[47:13] so every day of my life you know in the
[47:18] last 10 years we're dealing with
[47:20] Believers in other countries especially
[47:23] right now in
[47:24] Venezuela uh where they don't have any
[47:26] food they cannot afford when the whole
[47:30] family gets together there's 23 people
[47:33] it cost $100 a day to feed these people
[47:36] where are they going to get it they
[47:37] don't pay them enough to pay for bus
[47:40] Fair really and um uh some have only two
[47:43] changes of clothes some people have one
[47:45] pair of shoes it's pathetic so I can't
[47:50] enjoy too much knowing that and so uh
[47:54] some some people need a place to sleep
[47:56] they the it's either on the street or we
[47:58] help them somehow you know and uh some
[48:00] need help with their worn out vehicle
[48:02] but God provides day by day by day and
[48:06] so we we send packages they get their
[48:09] fine and and you know Paul said over
[48:11] here in 1 Corinthians 10 um all these
[48:15] things speaking of the Old Testament
[48:18] happen for examples and are written for
[48:19] our admonition other words that we might
[48:21] learn by it who upon whom the ends of
[48:24] the world are come well the ends of the
[48:25] world weren't coming on them right down
[48:27] they're coming on us we're the end time
[48:29] generation see we're the ones upon whom
[48:32] the ends of the world are come so trying
[48:35] to finish up here in the choosing of a
[48:37] bride and this is something you might
[48:39] not have heard before but I think it's
[48:41] paragraph 147 she the woman was not in
[48:44] the original creation all of the females
[48:46] are in the original creation the bird
[48:48] male female animals so forth but in
[48:50] human life God only made a man he took
[48:53] from him and the woman is a byproduct of
[48:56] a man because God did not Institute such
[48:57] a thing in other words it wasn't
[48:59] original creation search the scriptures
[49:02] and then he says but if
[49:04] she that's you ladies and bride in
[49:06] particular in general if she can hold
[49:09] herself right what a greater reward she
[49:12] has than man she's on a testing ground
[49:15] so there's hope for for ladies today but
[49:18] you got to stay
[49:20] balanced it's not an option so there is
[49:25] a great reward we are on a testing
[49:28] ground we live in
[49:29] Lea but the fact that God predestinated
[49:32] us to live at this time and know these
[49:34] great truths it's wonderful you see
[49:38] that's a testament to the fact that he
[49:40] has confidence that you will be more
[49:42] than a conqueror uh over lead DEA and
[49:46] according to John 4 uh that we read he's
[49:48] seeking those that worship Him in spirit
[49:51] and in truth stay
[49:53] balanced so what's the formula for
[49:55] balance here we go
[49:58] every day from the least to the oldest
[50:01] yeah even you
[50:03] sister I'm still older than
[50:06] you every day you read at least one
[50:10] chapter of your Bible or more at least
[50:13] one chapter you read one page out of
[50:16] your church age book you pray at all
[50:18] times and you listen to at least 20
[50:20] minutes of God's prophit you do those
[50:23] four things and you will prosper as an
[50:26] individual
[50:27] the church will prosper and you will be
[50:30] balanced in spirit and in
[50:32] truth try it see if it works when I come
[50:35] back in 6 months you tell me if it
[50:37] worked WR so may God bless you and we
[50:40] will be back as soon as
[50:44] possible and we do have some books back
[50:47] here in the fellowship hall so when you
[50:49] get out go back there and see what's
[50:50] available see if you have them all and
[50:53] uh if there's not enough we can send you
[50:55] some thank you for your attention
