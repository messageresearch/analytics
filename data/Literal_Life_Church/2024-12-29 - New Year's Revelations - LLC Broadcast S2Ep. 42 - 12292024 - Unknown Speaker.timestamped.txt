[5:43] hallelu I
[5:46] [Applause]
[5:47] know
[5:49] Lord
[5:51] [Music]
[5:57] hallelujah so Psalms chapter 1 and verse
[6:00] one blessed is the man blessed means
[6:03] that he's favored of God he's happy he's
[6:07] uh he's a blessed man of God blessed is
[6:09] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[6:12] of the ungodly nor standeth in the way
[6:15] of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[6:18] scornful now we could say that he's not
[6:21] a blessed man if he chooses to walk in
[6:24] the counsil of the ungodly if he chooses
[6:26] to stand in the way of Sinners nor
[6:30] if he chooses to sit in the seat of the
[6:31] scornful then we could say he's not
[6:33] really a blessed man he may be blessed
[6:35] financially or other ways but in God's
[6:38] eyes he's not blessed because he chooses
[6:39] to position himself to these influences
[6:43] so but the man who chooses and the woman
[6:45] that chooses to be away from these
[6:46] influences and under the influence of
[6:49] God then he's a blessed man goes on to
[6:51] say but his Delight is in the law of the
[6:54] Lord his Delight his passion is in the
[6:57] word of God and in his law
[7:00] doth he meditate day and night day and
[7:03] night and he shall be like a tree
[7:07] planted by the rivers of water that
[7:09] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[7:14] his Leaf also shall not wither and
[7:17] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now
[7:19] friends that's a pretty powerful set of
[7:22] scriptures here I believe it's a a
[7:23] blessing to see whatever he doeth shall
[7:27] prosper Happy New Year to to everybody
[7:30] we're uh just thankful for the grace of
[7:33] God this last year to be able to enjoy
[7:35] his presence to see the things that he's
[7:37] done and the many hurdles that we've
[7:40] come through many of you we're just
[7:42] grateful to serve the Lord in this
[7:44] capacity to be a blessing to you and may
[7:46] God bless you and your families may it
[7:48] be the best year ever amen now I I just
[7:51] believe that these three scriptures
[7:53] three verses here this morning in it we
[7:56] find a greater Revelation than what we
[7:59] realize
[8:00] and in these scriptures that we read I
[8:02] believe that there's a great revelation
[8:05] of the place that a Christian uh can
[8:08] live every day to be an overcomer how
[8:11] many want to be an
[8:13] overcomer that's what we're called to be
[8:15] in Leo DEA we're called to be over every
[8:17] age had Overcomers and we're called to
[8:19] be an overcomer not just a Survivor but
[8:22] an overcomer in this leoan age and so I
[8:25] believe we have some keys in Revelations
[8:27] here that gives us the key to Christian
[8:30] lives living every day being an
[8:32] overcomer to be uh insulated from the
[8:36] world uh to be isolated from the
[8:39] influences uh that come in our minds and
[8:42] I want to elaborate on that in our
[8:44] thought life and there some different
[8:45] things here this morning because we can
[8:48] be insulated by the Holy Ghost we can be
[8:50] isolated from the influences of the mind
[8:53] and letting them to Lodge within our
[8:55] thinking and our thought life and uh so
[8:58] we are we in the scripture here are
[9:00] typed as a tree and if you know your
[9:02] Bible you know that that trees are a
[9:05] type of a man and trees are a type of
[9:07] Christ because in the beginning in the
[9:10] Genesis we find that God talks about the
[9:12] trees that's in the garden but we know
[9:15] that not all those trees were literal
[9:17] trees some of them were literal trees
[9:20] and some of them represented trees which
[9:22] trees represent man but also trees
[9:25] represented Christ and in the garden we
[9:27] have the Tree of Life in the guard we
[9:29] have the tree of knowledge of Good and
[9:31] Evil and actually incidentally those
[9:34] trees end up being symbolic that the
[9:36] Tree of Life In The Garden was a person
[9:39] the tree of knowledge and good and evil
[9:41] was a person so you can't look at it
[9:43] just through a carnal eyes when you look
[9:45] at the Book of Genesis but we find in
[9:47] the beginning God is speaking about
[9:49] trees in the garden and they were not
[9:51] all literal trees and then if you move
[9:54] to the middle of the Bible we see that
[9:56] the tree of life was a person that we
[9:59] eat of in the middle of the Bible Jesus
[10:01] was saying I am the bread of the life I
[10:03] am the way of life I am the Tree of Life
[10:06] in John 15 he refers to himself as the
[10:09] vine and you are the branches so so
[10:12] Jesus is saying you are connected to
[10:14] this tree of life you are the branches
[10:16] to this tree of life I'm the vine you
[10:19] are the branches and and he and we're
[10:21] engra not engrafted but we're part of
[10:24] this tree so my theme is that the reason
[10:26] that he speaks about in Psalms 1 is the
[10:28] tree a a man is like a tree planted by
[10:32] the rivers of Living Water because men
[10:34] type trees and and we can even bear the
[10:37] fruit of something of the world or we
[10:39] can be connected to the tree of life and
[10:42] your life becomes a tree of life your
[10:45] life bears fruit of Christ can you say
[10:48] Amen so now to summarize just this
[10:50] Foundation that I lay laying here this
[10:52] is a Believer who's been planted in the
[10:56] right place beside the flowing Rivers
[10:59] Waters of God this is a believer I'm
[11:02] summarizing now what I'm going to preach
[11:03] the rest of the time uh and then so but
[11:06] don't just hear the summary and then uh
[11:08] turn off the computer don't do that uh
[11:11] you should hear the rest of it but I'm
[11:13] summarizing that these three scriptures
[11:16] say that this is a Believer who's been
[11:20] planted in the right place beside the
[11:23] flowing Waters of God his life is
[11:26] planted in the right place his roots are
[11:28] going in the right place and the right
[11:30] position he has shut off all wrong
[11:33] influences he has one main passion in
[11:36] his life and that's the word of God and
[11:39] he is prospering both naturally and
[11:43] spiritually because it says whatsoever
[11:45] this man does is going to prosper praise
[11:49] God I don't want the world's
[11:52] Prosperity I I don't want the success of
[11:54] the world remember he said to Joshua if
[11:56] you'll follow these things Joshua 1 he
[11:58] said thou shal have good success not
[12:01] just success but you'll have good
[12:03] success I want to ask you do you want
[12:05] the success of the world do you want the
[12:07] money of the world do you want the what
[12:09] they call success or do you want good
[12:12] success and good success is when you and
[12:15] your family are following the word of
[12:16] God obedient to the word of God serving
[12:18] him with God in in the passion for the
[12:21] word and then you'll have not just
[12:22] success but good success not just
[12:25] Prosperity but good prosperity God's
[12:28] prosperity
[12:29] God's blessing in your life
[12:32] hallelujah praise be to God so this is a
[12:35] Believer that's been planted in the
[12:36] right place has shut off all wrong
[12:39] influences has one made passion in the
[12:41] word and is proos prospering both
[12:43] naturally and spiritually and we're
[12:45] talking about your spiritual life your
[12:47] tree I ask you today where is your tree
[12:51] planted what influence are you under
[12:54] right now what influence is your mind
[12:56] under what influence is your thought
[12:58] life
[13:00] under uh where are you planted and what
[13:02] influence are you under you know uh
[13:04] planting and caring for plants and trees
[13:09] is actually an art and some people are
[13:12] actually gifted with it but then some
[13:13] people can learn I just bought my
[13:15] daughter uh some plant books my daughter
[13:18] amariah for Christmas I bought her cuz
[13:20] she's interested in learning more about
[13:22] planting and things she's really good at
[13:24] it good at it already she's really good
[13:26] at flowers and such but she wants to
[13:28] learn more because it's said actual art
[13:30] uh this guy I have no green thumb my
[13:33] thumbs are not green at all I do not do
[13:36] good at planning and matter of fact my
[13:38] wife gets on me because I'm usually with
[13:40] the Roundup around trying to get the
[13:43] weeds around things and a few times I've
[13:46] sprayed some really good plants and that
[13:49] doesn't go over well with the wife so
[13:51] you know I just attacked the weeds but
[13:53] if I get into the planting thing that
[13:55] thing is not going to thrive under me
[13:57] I'm just not gifted at it but we know
[14:00] the simple fact that a tree and a and a
[14:03] plant we know I know this is simple
[14:06] today but I pray that you'll apply it to
[14:08] your lives a tree or a plant cannot
[14:12] Thrive if it's planted in the wrong
[14:16] atmosphere your life is a tree and where
[14:19] you're planted every day spiritually
[14:22] will determine your thriving as a as a
[14:25] tree of the Lord it has everything to do
[14:28] with you can't say no that has nothing
[14:31] to do with it and what I feed on has
[14:32] nothing to do with it then you're
[14:34] denying what nature says andless a tree
[14:37] is planted in the right place it will
[14:40] not Thrive you're Divine denying all of
[14:42] Nature and you're saying that my life
[14:44] doesn't apply to that no he he typed
[14:47] your life in Psalms 1 as a tree and a
[14:50] man or a woman's life has to be planted
[14:53] close to the rivers of water for
[14:54] moisture can you say amen for the right
[14:57] atmosphere can you say Amen and if it's
[15:00] not there it's not going to be a
[15:02] thriving tree the wrong atmosphere and
[15:05] if it's there if it's planted in the
[15:06] wrong place it will not reach its full
[15:08] potential you have been you have to be
[15:10] planted in the right place to thrive
[15:13] even the church that you attend can make
[15:15] you grow and thrive in this word or
[15:18] shrivel up and
[15:21] die even the local church that you
[15:23] attend can either make you grow in the
[15:26] word in faith in the word in your
[15:27] position in the word or you can sit
[15:30] there and dry up and shrivel and
[15:33] die you better pray about what you need
[15:36] in your life I think when you're planted
[15:39] by the rivers of Living Water when your
[15:41] life is planted in the right place and
[15:43] you stay there and you're away from the
[15:45] influences you set yourself as a
[15:47] candidate to receive all that God has
[15:49] for you and if you're lacking the Holy
[15:51] Ghost there's things you can do to obey
[15:53] him and stay close to him he's going to
[15:55] give you it's God's not standing back
[15:57] saying oh I just hold it back from him
[15:59] I'll hold the Holy Ghost back I keep
[16:00] God's not playing games like that God's
[16:03] not God's looking for a hunger in your
[16:05] heart and and Jesus refers to it he says
[16:09] a father when he sees his child needs
[16:11] something would he not give that to his
[16:14] child when they have a need and he said
[16:16] so much more is the father wanting to
[16:18] give the Holy Ghost to his children
[16:20] God's not trying to hold it back from
[16:22] you you set yourself in the right
[16:24] atmosphere and you show your hunger to
[16:26] God say God I need more of you he'll
[16:28] finish the work in you amen he'll seal
[16:30] you by the Holy Ghost you got to have a
[16:33] revelation to know go how much God loves
[16:35] you and then that love reaches back to
[16:38] him and that love governs every
[16:40] situation in life I'll read it later
[16:42] perfect Faith Masters every
[16:46] circumstance that's why we need to live
[16:48] in perfect Faith but where does it come
[16:50] where does it start a perfect love a
[16:52] genuine love knowing that God loves us
[16:55] knowing that he's called us knowing that
[16:57] he has whatever we need and this governs
[16:59] and and that God loves you you love God
[17:02] you love one another and that brings
[17:04] Faith a revelation of the love of God
[17:06] loving him back is the creator of this
[17:10] perfect faith in our lives it's rooted
[17:12] in the love of God not in works not in
[17:14] just wearing the right thing not in
[17:17] doing perfect things no we need a
[17:19] perfect faith and that doesn't NE
[17:21] necessarily mean doing uh perfect things
[17:24] it's a life that loves him and others
[17:27] more than anything in Psalms 92:12 he
[17:30] said the righteous shall flourish like
[17:32] the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar
[17:35] in Lebanon those that be planted in the
[17:38] house of the Lord shall flourish in the
[17:41] courts of our God I don't know if they
[17:43] have that scripture but Psalms 9212 the
[17:45] righteous shall flourish like a palm
[17:47] tree he shall grow like a cedar in
[17:49] Lebanon those that be planted in the
[17:51] house of the Lord shall flourish in the
[17:53] courts of our God they shall shall still
[17:58] bring forth fruit fruit in old age they
[18:00] shall be fat and flourishing this goes
[18:01] right with Psalms 1 it's those that are
[18:03] planted you have to be planted in the
[18:05] right place you have to know your
[18:07] position Heavenly places in Christ so
[18:09] many scriptures point to this position
[18:11] being in the right place being planted
[18:13] in the right place that's what perfect
[18:15] Faith that's the perfect faith that
[18:16] we're called to you can have your faith
[18:18] built up temporary by testimonies a
[18:22] preacher can get testimonies and build
[18:24] Faith you can have your faith built up
[18:27] temporary by testimonies or by hearing
[18:29] the word faith coming by hearing the
[18:30] word all those things are wonderful but
[18:32] I'm talking about staying in your
[18:34] position and not having a temporary
[18:37] Faith but a perfect faith that is stable
[18:40] that is planted when you use the word
[18:42] planted that means it's planted the
[18:44] roots are down it's there it's
[18:47] not rooting it up and moving
[18:50] constantly you can't spiritually do that
[18:53] and
[18:54] Thrive well I'm kind of tired of this so
[18:57] I'm just going to do this for a few
[18:58] years and you root yourself up and no
[19:01] the the the the plant has to be in one
[19:03] place and stay in that place this is the
[19:05] faith that I'm talking
[19:07] about knowing your position being
[19:09] planted in your position staying there
[19:13] not up and down but planted perfect
[19:15] faith and it's related to your position
[19:18] I hope this is a blessing to you I hope
[19:20] it's an encouragement I hope it builds
[19:21] your faith I hope you set you in a path
[19:23] to come to a life of perfect Faith why
[19:25] do you want to live another year in fear
[19:28] why do you want to live another year
[19:29] just not knowing who you are why do you
[19:32] want to continue to live on the fence
[19:34] about things why don't you be all in
[19:36] Lock Stock and Barrel want say God plant
[19:39] my life my tree plant my spiritual life
[19:43] right besides the rivers of water and
[19:46] Lord let me shut out the things of the
[19:48] world and let me live there this year
[19:50] every
[19:51] day what a what a goal what a New Year's
[19:57] revelation I'm just going to quickly
[19:59] make this simple as possible why is this
[20:02] man in Psalms 1 blessed
[20:05] prospering thriving why is he thriving
[20:08] why is he prospering it's where he's
[20:10] positioned
[20:11] himself first thing in his mind he is
[20:15] not open to just any influence number
[20:18] one when you take the counsel of the
[20:20] ungodly you think this doesn't fit with
[20:23] social media and all the access we have
[20:26] to all the wisdom of the world and all
[20:28] all the thoughts that come across your
[20:29] mind every day and across your phone and
[20:33] this applies the
[20:36] council the example of the
[20:39] ungodly is set before us all the
[20:42] time advice everybody wants to give
[20:45] their advice and everybody's an
[20:49] expert everybody has the final
[20:52] word fouchy Biden
[20:56] Trump the CDC
[20:59] act as if they have the final
[21:01] word and people get on with their
[21:03] opinions and they act as if they have
[21:06] the final word on it your opinion is not
[21:08] the final
[21:09] word my opinion is not the final word on
[21:13] it and so this whole thing of the
[21:16] counsel of the ungodly a Believer says
[21:19] now wait a minute as you give a deaf ear
[21:21] to the other voices and this believer in
[21:24] Psalms 1 gives a deaf ear to the advice
[21:26] and counsel of anyone that it's ungodly
[21:29] I'm getting practical now why are you
[21:32] given a place at the table to weigh in
[21:34] in your
[21:35] life from the counsel of the ungodly
[21:39] they have no example in their life
[21:40] they're not growing in the lord they're
[21:41] going backwards and you're giving a
[21:44] place at your table and in your thought
[21:47] life to the counsel of the
[21:50] ungodly he is not following their advice
[21:53] he's not following their example he's
[21:55] not get living on Google uh to Google in
[21:59] for the decision he makes I don't make
[22:01] my decisions just based upon a Google
[22:04] search if this is some of your influence
[22:07] you will never grow to more faith this
[22:09] blessed believer is not influenced by
[22:11] those things he doesn't walk in the path
[22:13] of Sinners to be in the path is just to
[22:16] be around them doesn't stand in the path
[22:18] of s says he's standing he's around them
[22:21] he's watching what they're doing he's
[22:22] standing in the path he's not
[22:24] necessarily following them but he's just
[22:26] standing in the path watching what
[22:28] they're doing doing the path of Sinners
[22:30] is that where your life is but you're
[22:32] really just standing the path of Sinners
[22:34] on the internet and every else you're
[22:35] just standing there watching what do
[22:36] they do what fun are they having you're
[22:38] standing in the path of Sinners you may
[22:40] not be going down the path but you're
[22:42] standing there watching what they're
[22:44] doing not necessarily following but just
[22:47] standing watching what they do all day
[22:49] it's feeding on what they're
[22:52] doing I wonder what they're doing I
[22:54] wonder what's why but it's so much fun
[22:57] watching them do it just standing them
[22:59] watching them on their path which
[23:02] incidentally leads to a path to
[23:05] hell you want to watch people that are
[23:07] on path to
[23:08] Hell nor in the seat of the scornful you
[23:13] know what I cannot take two minutes and
[23:15] talk about the seat of the
[23:18] scornful the mockers the scoffers the
[23:21] complainers the
[23:23] critical moping all the time finding
[23:26] what's wrong finding what's negative
[23:29] you associate yourself with people like
[23:30] that all the time you're not going to be
[23:31] positive about your walk with the Lord
[23:34] we need to talk about people that stand
[23:36] in the way of Sinners we need to talk
[23:37] about people that dwell in the Council
[23:39] of the ungodly and now you're sitting in
[23:41] the seat and this is you were standing
[23:43] in the way of Sinners but now you're
[23:44] sitting in the seat of the scornful I
[23:46] want to elaborate on that of being
[23:48] around negative people and being around
[23:51] backsliders and being around people that
[23:53] are constantly negative that's not going
[23:54] to help you my brother that's not going
[23:56] to help your life they might even be in
[23:58] this church but it's not going to help
[24:00] you to stay around them if you can say
[24:01] an encouraging word and try to pull them
[24:02] out of it but most of the time you can't
[24:04] pull them out of it because they're just
[24:05] negative but you're not going to be in
[24:07] good shape if you hang around just those
[24:09] people all the time amen you're not
[24:12] going to be positive you're not going to
[24:14] have faith you're not to be confident in
[24:16] what God is doing you're not to be
[24:17] Kingdom living in the kingdom when
[24:19] you're around the seat of the scornful
[24:21] and they just sit and criticize and
[24:23] they're they're constantly uh looking at
[24:25] things all the time from that
[24:26] perspective those people are not going
[24:28] to do you any good you're not going to
[24:29] prosper being around people like that
[24:31] may that be part of your New Year's
[24:33] resolution Revelation may that be part
[24:35] of your desire Lord let me distance
[24:38] myself from influences that's plaguing
[24:40] my mind making me negative let me sit
[24:42] myself plant myself in the right place
[24:45] let me jump ahead and say this blessed
[24:48] and happy and favored man or woman of
[24:50] God have intentionally position
[24:52] themselves away from people like that
[24:55] away from influences like that they have
[24:57] to in order to live in the kingdom and
[25:00] his passion his Delight is in the word
[25:03] of God above anything else it's exciting
[25:05] to him they can't wait to get to church
[25:07] they can't wait to hear the word from
[25:09] the church they can't wait to open their
[25:11] Bible they can't wait to read it it's
[25:13] not just reading it it's a passion for
[25:15] it this is this man in Psalms 1 can you
[25:17] say amen and he doesn't let things get
[25:19] lodged in his mind it says he's not only
[25:22] not only does he have a passion for the
[25:24] law of God and the word of God but in
[25:26] that law he medit meditates day and
[25:29] night this is what he allows himself to
[25:31] think about all the
[25:33] time this is what he meditates about so
[25:36] I don't have a choice in some things I
[25:38] don't have control over some things but
[25:40] I want to tell everybody here I and you
[25:42] have control over our thought
[25:46] life see the devil's convince you you
[25:48] don't oh the devil's just bringing all
[25:50] these thoughts no you have control over
[25:51] it you can replace good thoughts with
[25:53] wrong thoughts and you have to
[25:55] distinguish between what's imagination
[25:57] What Satan's thought coming to you and
[25:59] quickly dismiss them not giving them a
[26:01] place at the table and say I'm going to
[26:03] replace it with perfect Thoughts with
[26:06] good thoughts with wholesome thoughts
[26:08] think on these things and so I'm
[26:11] meditating on the word meditating what I
[26:13] heard Sunday I'm meditating on what I
[26:14] heard Wednesday night I read this
[26:16] yesterday in the Bible just meditating
[26:17] on that this is the guy this is the
[26:19] brother this the believer who's
[26:21] prospering this a Believer who's
[26:23] spiritually in a Revival because he's
[26:25] not influenced by everything around him
[26:28] he switches out his thoughts back to the
[26:30] word he's thinking his thinking is
[26:33] directed his thought life is directed
[26:35] There are many things we don't have
[26:37] control over but he has control over
[26:40] what this man has control over what he
[26:43] thinks about you believe God has
[26:47] something for you this
[26:48] year you believe God has something
[26:50] deeper for
[26:52] you this this message is not just for a
[26:55] select few it's if you'll take a hold of
[26:57] it it's for you
[26:59] it's for you to live in Revival it's for
[27:00] you to live in perfect faith we have a
[27:02] kingdom we're called to live in that
[27:04] Kingdom we're called to keep our
[27:06] thoughts on that Kingdom Psalm blessed
[27:09] is the man that Seth not in the seat of
[27:11] the scornful standeth in the way of
[27:13] Sinners but his Delight is in the law of
[27:16] the Lord and in the law doth he meditate
[27:19] day and night and he shall be like a
[27:21] tree that's planted by the river of
[27:24] water and his leaves shall not wither
[27:26] whatsoever he doeth it shall prosper I
[27:31] say blessed be the name of the Lord
