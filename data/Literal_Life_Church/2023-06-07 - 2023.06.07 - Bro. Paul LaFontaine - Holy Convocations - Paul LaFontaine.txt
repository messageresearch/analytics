TRANSCRIPT
========================================
would you read with me tonight Leviticus 23 and verse 1 we'll read a section of scripture here and I wanted to continue a little bit what I touched on on Sunday and maybe break it down a little bit step back and maybe revisit some things from Sunday and also revisit some things we spoke on years ago and bring these back up again for the new ones that have come Leviticus 23 is a study we've worked on through the years and really enjoy it and to see the Fulfillment of these feasts and so I thought I'd since I talked about Sunday we'll talk about it again tonight on a little bible study and just learn a little bit more about it and especially for some of the new ones that have come amen Leviticus 23 and verse 1 says and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them concerning the Feast of the Lord which ye shall Proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my feasts so their holy convocations I want you to remember that term God calls these feasts holy convocations even these that are my feet six days shall work shall work be done but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest a holy convocation you should you shall do no work therein it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings these are the feasts of the Lord even holy convocations which ye shall Proclaim in their seasons and Proclaim us not just that you're confessing it but it's you're celebrating it you're you're exercising these these seasons and these convocations and these feasts in other words you're you're coming to them you're attending them and you are proclaiming them that is happening now so these are the feasts of the Lord even holy convocations which he shall Proclaim in their Seasons so every one of them has a season and as the prophet taught us we should always be working within the season that God is in and if you're doing something out of season like if you're trying to do something in the spring season and it didn't belong in the spring it belonged more in the fall we don't normally do that we work with the seasons that we're in at the time uh somebody who would come and offer uh hot chocolate around the fire Outside In The Heat Of Summer when it's 100 degrees that just doesn't really go together to have hot chocolate around a burning fire it's out of season but you know invite me over for uh around the fire pit you know about October November with the hot chocolate and some s'mores and whatever else you want to give me and and I'm there I'm there because why it's in season it's in season but we know how crazy it is to try to do something out of season and God's the same way how many know that Ecclesiastes says to everything there's a season there's a time so we have to work with God's season if we're trying to do something out of season he's trying to do this and we're trying to reach back here to another season we're trying to reach forward we're getting out of God's will God's continuity but I want to be found just submissive to the season God's in and I want to be right there with them amen Lord bless your word tonight and pray you anoint it father and give it to us again just as you gave it to me today as we met you in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated so we're just going to revisit a few things about the the feast as we were on Sunday he got pretty excited about and uh I didn't realize until today that when I speak about the Holy convocations that God has here he called them holy convocations he called these seven feasts that he said that would be three times a year the children of Israel come and visit Jerusalem three times a year and there would be a celebration there would be a feast and every one of these feasts are different the first three happen together and then just a little while after the fourth one happened and then later in the season in the fall they would come back for the last three but three uh they had to visit Jerusalem and come for these these celebrations and these things that acknowledge God and what God was doing got what God did and so now I didn't realize uh when it was speaking about convocate convocation I thought it was like our modern day graduation but I realized there's a different difference between a convocation and a graduation and we're in the season of graduations right now so I thought it was very significant to talk about uh graduations but there is a difference and I'm going to get to that in a little bit so we know the difference between a convocation that's the term God is using here and a graduation so it's graduations are pretty exciting and those that are graduating it's it's means that you finish something and there's celebrations for that and there's appreciations for it there's an event you attend the event and uh but but the convocation is something much much deeper has a deeper meaning than just the graduation and so this will be spilling over tonight a little bit from my theme that I had on Sunday and that is that we must be personally connected to what Calvary did for you every believer every young person every person must have a personal connection with what Calvary means to you and what he did for you at the cross lest it becomes a ritual lesson because of tradition and uh so we don't want that to happen so there must be a personal connection and there must be a feeling of it there must be that you feel what God has done for you and feel it personally to you and that there's a power that will come in your life because of the sacrifice of Calvary every believer every person needs to have a personal connection with that and so this will spill over into that theme tonight as we talk about those things now I just want to take a moment and a couple of these slides and bring back the seven feasts and this will be real basic so everybody even the child can understand it and I want to bring up that first slide and show you and this is I was borrowed this today from somebody because because then I didn't have to do the work of putting them all together so this is why I was talking about Sunday and you'll read it in Leviticus 23 um you'll read all these feasts that's where you find it you want to read it on your own and these are the seven feasts that God set up for the children of Israel to come and to uh gather together and to sell and every one of these had a meaning to them I think a a few of these had the Lamb with it most of these had the land where they brought the sacrificial lamb for their sins and the priests would bring it in but these were the biblical he calls them biblical holidays and they have actually become that more and more the Jews still celebrate these things the true Jews and their holidays their time set aside just like our American holidays and so there is a meaning behind them and so the first four happened in the spring uh spring days in that season and the first one was the Passover and then the second one was the UN Feast of unleavened bread and the third one was the first fruits and then the fourth one was the Feast of Pentecost and every one of these had different some things similar they did when they come to Jerusalem and then sometimes they had different things they did in each one and if you study them and if you've got an open heart every one of them has a meaning every one of them has something significant and every one of them point to Christ and not just Christ it points to Christ in our own lives and so that's the first four and then there's a space of time there that goes to the fall and then the other three are picked up now to me that says to me that you have something happening early on that's a fulfillment and Christ fulfilled them and then you have a space and then at the end time this would be the end time this would be the last days and this fellow said historically these were fulfilled during Jesus first coming he's exactly right these four feasts were had the the spiritual fulfillment of them the Jews did the ritual the Jews did the actual uh a feast days but there was a fulfillment spiritually that happened in each of these where once the once the spiritual fulfillment was there happening once the true Passover Lamb was there once the true unleavened bread was there once the the resurrection took place took place face and once it was a Pentecost then you had the spiritual fulfillment you didn't go back and like the Jews are doing today because they don't see the Messiah they're still celebrating the old ritual but once the spiritual thing comes along then you don't go back to the ritual it's kind of like what happens in our lives and that is that once there's a new birth once there's a real New Birth it's not a ritual anymore it's not a duty anymore it's not a dress code anymore can you say Amen something has happened and Christ has become real to you and the message and the word and everything is of manifestation out of you it's not something you're trying to do on the outside I'm supposed to do this these probably people probably thought I got to get to that Jerusalem I'm supposed to do this this is a duty and so they've got the family together and got in their minivan three times a year whether they wanted to or not some years and they did it as a ritual but once the spiritual part took place then it was no longer a ritual it was an experience it was a reality can you say Amen so in the Old Testament they did that but Christ fulfilled all these and then all of a sudden because this speaks at the end time then he says to be fulfilled during the second coming of Christ and he's exactly right because now we go 2 000 years in between the spot this was a year for the Jews so you figure the first three months there and you can look up what months they which dates they uh celebrated and then there's a space of time of about three months or four months then it picks up the Feast of trumpets Feast the Feast of atonement and the Feast of Tabernacles so it all speaks to these last three happening at the end time our ears should be perked up because we live in the end time we live in the last days and so we see then that these are the ones that become significant to us because these are already fulfilled now we still sing about Christ's death we still celebrate what he did at the cross we still celebrate the resurrection we we still celebrate that he's the bread the unleavened bread how many know Christ is those things and we celebrate the original Pentecost but but traditionally we don't want to keep looking back to that we've got to find the season that God is in right now because the same God that fulfilled those feasts right now is ready to fulfill these so once again the Bible says Seasons you have to be in the season there's a lot of Christianity that's still celebrating you know uh in in the in what was done 2000 years ago and they're still celebrating it but they don't realize the prophets being is being fulfilled right now and the same God that fulfilled those feasts now is ready to fulfill these and it is already spiritually fulfilling them I don't know what else to say except for as far as on this part it's just I wanted a visual for everybody to be able to see this is what they look like and this is the time span between the first four and the last three and these are these are fulfilled by Christ and I mentioned something Sunday that the the first three were fulfilled Christ fulfills all seven he's the Fulfillment of all the seven Feasts but he fulfills the first three in his in his body in other words Jesus of now he fulfills the first three but he fulfills the last four actually in the body of Christ his people and how do I know that we may still be looking at these here but I know that it was Christ coming on the day of Pentecost and it was him fulfilling the Feast of Pentecost but what body was he using 120 in the upper room being filled with the Holy Ghost so that day and incidentally if you read Acts chapter 2 and verse 1 it says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they're actually meeting on the day that the Jews were celebrating Pentecost the very day when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were in an upper room and they were praying in one Accord and God fulfilled the spiritual meaning of Pentecost on the very same day that others were going to the ritual God was fulfilling the Fulfillment he was doing it Christ but where was he doing it filling his people with the Holy Ghost you see here's another way that we know that is that he fulfilled this in his body because this is unleavened bread and unleavened bread is with leaven is sin so there was no sin in this bread okay that means it had to be that body of Christ because he's the only one without sin when we come to the Feast of Pentecost in that feast and the Jews they used leaven bread that means sin was in it that means it wasn't the body of Christ it was our body because he filled 120 believers who were born in sin shaped in iniquity and he still saved them still filled him with the Holy Ghost and gave them the Conquering power over sin in their lives so that was lemon bread that's why I know that couldn't have been the actual Body of Christ it was the people of God fulfilling the day of Pentecost and every one of them back in those four happened on the very day that the ritual and the the the old holiday was being celebrated God was fulfilling it fulfilling it on the very day and I don't know if I'll get to this scripture but Jesus attended all these Jesus attended the Senate Fox Jesus went to church Jesus attended and he's he can't catch this now he's attending all of these feasts and he's there he's present and yet while he's walking in the door and walking into the temple and around and while he's doing all that he knows in his heart he's the Fulfillment he's the Fulfillment of this Feast praise God I'll be it tonight if we could catch a revelation that when we're coming to church we're not just coming to church that we're not here to hear a sermon but I want to be the actual fulfillment of what's being preached can you say amen I want to be what's being preached I want to live that out I want to be Christ so whatever Feast he's fulfilling whatever God's doing I want to be the manifestation of what God's doing I don't want Church to become a ritual I'm going to talk about that more here in a little bit so that's it I hope that's a good visual for you that's how you kind of see these broken down and I'm certainly not a teacher and with brother wrap around now on different teachers and brother Stevens truth sitting in the same audience here now uh I would be crazy to try to get into teaching with all them present but anyway this is my feeble effort I had to borrow this off the internet these guys probably developed their own but I had to borrow it just so that you have a visual and idea this is what we're talking about so if we go to the next one then I broke these down later to realize that Christ is the Fulfillment here's some scriptures that show that Purge out there for the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrifice for us that's the scripture identifies he's the Fulfillment of of the Feast of Passover amen second one oh I can do this can I sister Genie or whoever's up there happy anniversary brother James and sister Jeannie today I see your hand up there [Applause] um it's good to have you sister from where are you from Austria nice to have you tonight God bless you so the Feast of unleavened bread is that did Christ fulfill that John 6 I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the Lord let me raise you and say he's the Fulfillment of that Feast of unleavened bread amen if you don't if you read the Old Testament don't forget now and don't see Christ it's all Christ being revealed okay it goes from the ritual to the reality how about the Feast of first fruits First Corinthians 15 20 but now is Christ risen from the dead Feast of first fruits in the Old Testament means that they had to take whatever crop whatever come out of the ground first whatever was resurrected first they took the first fruits and they gave it as a tithe the first so Christ was the first one that come out of the Grave from the dead that's what it says so he's the Fulfillment of this Feast the first fruits but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that sled Christ is the Fulfillment of the Feast of first fruits on Resurrection Day He fulfilled that feast and we'll have a part in that when we resurrect someday the Feast of Pentecost Acts 2 and 1 4 says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is Christ it's not the third person of the Trinity it's Christ Christ was fulfilling the Feast of Pentecost where in the people so the ritual was over with can you say amen and the reality had come to pass and they were there and Christ was fulfilling it through his people let's go on now to the fifth one remember there's two thousand years here there's many months in the year in between three or four months but there's a space and I give that 2 000 years of the church ages then when we come to the end time the Feast of trumpets Matthew 24 31 and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other now this is fulfilled every one of these are fulfilled had a fulfillment for the Jews who are God's people and he then he allowed the Gentiles a bride to come in so we have two sides of it going to be see the spiritual fulfillment and that's the Jews so most of the time brother Brown refers to the Feast of trumpets being attached to the Jews and that this Feast of trumpets will gather the people from the four corners of the earth that are his people that have been scattered because remember they were are pushed out of Jerusalem their Temple was destroyed so they ended up going over Generations around the world but God says I'll use my trumpets to gather the people back into their Homeland again for the purpose of bringing them to the the six feasts and that's what I spoke on Sunday the Feast of atonement so the purpose of gathering the people together is to bring them back into the whole Homeland so he can reveal himself someday to the Jews and they can realize oh we killed our Messiah oh we didn't know they'll mourn for days and they'll come back to what our atonement is not in the blood of bulls and goats but are we killed the atonement he was crucified for us and actually the two prophets that come to Israel will give them the revelation of all seven of these feasts and the elect will catch it and say my I've been worshiping under a ritual all these years I realize Christ is the Fulfillment to all these and they will begin to have a Revival again because they realize Christ is fulfilling thankfully the bride is already recognizing these things I'm preaching it to you tonight but one day the Jews are going to catch the same thing amen if brother or sister listen to this the Jew I know there's some even being baptized in in Israel with brother Colin he's baptized in several Jews that are coming in Catching catching their full revelation of the true Messiah it's wonderful it's wonderful so Christ is the Fulfillment of the Feast of trumpets and it's a gathering how is that fulfilled in us well where'd you come from a lot of different places you know you're out there in the world in a factory or in a a business office somewhere didn't have a clue you were a child of God and by some strange pulling and Gathering he gathers you not and remember for the Jews he gathered them from around the world and he used trials to do it he used Hitler to do it Hitler was a tool Hitler all these dictators was used as a tool because the trumpets trumpets denotes War the the wars were used to drive his people back could it be tonight that the wars in your life and I'll tell you if there's Wars in your life you better quit fighting you better let God fight him for you could it be that the wars could be used in the trials in our life could be used to drive us to the true atonement and bring us back to our homeland the word of God so where's the bride Gathering we're it's a spiritual Gathering Jesus said uh I'm trying to remember the scripture but I know the one I'm thinking of but the few scriptures before it says that they will come and somebody says where to Lord where are they going to gather where he says wherever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together it's an end time scripture so this is our trumpets there's a gathering together I'm preaching the message of the hour tonight and I I want to believe that you're here because there's a lot of churches to go to but I'm preaching the message of the last days and there'll be something in your heart to say that's the preaching I want to hear I want to hear the message of the last days that says something about our hearts can you say Amen you've been gathered spiritually for a reason don't look at church don't look at church as you looked at it before but look at it as Jesus said wheresoever the carcass is which means the fresh word of God for the hour not some dead animal that's laid there for about three weeks and there's maggots and everything that's kind of what denominational Creeds produces old old word it's not fresh but a carcass it's just been killed you'll see the Eagles around it can you say Amen so you have been spiritually gathered from all over the place in different backgrounds that's why we all have to get along because Christ is innocent realize different backgrounds different opinions all these other things but there's a spiritual Gathering to the word that's the trumpet call in your life do you know that God the trumpet he he called you here I think you're here by yourself do you think no something called you something drew you God Drew you to gather you with God's people and around the word of God that's the only place that was true that where there's True Fellowship it's not a social Gathering it's not a uh it's not a club it's not a denomination it's a spiritual gathering around the word of God fresh word of God I'm taking all my time on this so Feast on Feast of the trumpets is fulfilled by Christ the Feast of atonement he gathers them together to the Feast of atonement and not only so but we also joy and God through Lord Jesus Christ by whom we all now have the atonement there's more to there's more scriptures to the atonement there's more scriptures to what the meaning of the atonement is because it doesn't necessarily mean that Christ has to die for our sins again he already did but it's coming to the full revelation of what the atonement is the Jews will come to that but the bride is coming to that now as I preach Sunday the true realization and revelation of what Christ did for me at Calvary and what that means to me in life in power in overcoming complexes and overcoming family habits inherent habits can you say Amen the power of Calvary will dissolve it all that's our atonement and if we're not living in our atonement we'll keep keep those habits we'll keep those little those flaws and those things that are there we'll hold on to them but the power of Calvary the atonement you got a revelation of it you're going to be released of all these things that you can't overcome yourself amen so a lot more scriptures to that but he is the Fulfillment of the Feast of atonement and that's happening that's you want to know the season for this this is happening right now because we've already been gathered we've already been our Feast of trumpet spiritually but now we're we're celebrating and we're worshiping under this Feast we're we're coming to church and we're in the word every day because Lord show me the power more and more of what you've done for me at Calvary and let me live in it in Victory forget this traditional idea that I'm just thinking about some you know some Christ of history let me live in the power and reality of what the cross has done for me that's why I preached on someone has died for me someone died for me because when you realize you're connected to that it brings Victory today every day is a victory for us when we live in that victory of Calvary and then the last one is the Feast of Tabernacles which is a great study second Corinthians 5 1 4 we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens so this is the final Revelation that we will dwell if you go in the Book of Revelations God shall Tabernacle himself with his people that's the final Feast of Tabernacles is that he'll put us back in a millennium and God will his Tabernacle is with men and in men can you say Amen but right now we're catching the Revelation hearing from our theophonies that we have an eternal body just in the next Dimension that we will ghost to someday it's a tabernacle not made with hands it's a tabernacle it's another body can you say Amen that Christ has given us it's a part of Christ and we will go to that you talk about celebrating the Feast of Tabernacles we're awful close to a Rapture when we go into another body so you can see by this these things that he fulfills them all now I wanted to go into a couple things before I go to this if you're still here so let me just get to these points out let's just skip skip to the skip to the uh Leviticus 23 1 our text it says there that it says and the Lord speaking to Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them concerning the Feast of the Lord which ye shall Proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my feast so um convocation in the scriptural meaning means and I want you to catch this point tonight it's a me a convocation is a meeting of a religious character as distinguished from congregation which was more General so when he says These Are Holy convocations and that's what I'm preaching unto a holy convocation this is different when they gathered as the general assembly to synagogue and they gathered they had Gatherings throughout the year every week they'd gather together at Sabbath and they had other Gatherings but this God wants you to know this holy convocation is not just another gathering this isn't just church as usual every week this is a holy convocation so I like when it's worded a meeting of religious character as distinguished from congregation because when you have just a meeting with the congregation it could be very surface it could be just very general we do that on a weekly basis sometimes by sometimes twice a week but but when let me just say it this way when God speaks of a holy convocation it's not church as usual it's a personal connection with you that's a holy convocation and in other words this convocation was more important than just the general meetings of his people they had more meaning to it a religious character in other words character was involved I would say that this way is that you can come and attend a congregation and be around the social part of it and develop friendships or not develop friendships whatever you want to do you can enjoy the benefits of all that that's wonderful but I can tell you God wants to have a holy convocation with you personally and if that doesn't happen all the congregational Gatherings will do you no good so when he speaks of this it's more important than just a general meeting it's more important that you just make it to all the camps for the summer you should go to camps Jesus attended there's a scripture that says that as is custom one he was he went in the synagogue he attended these things but it wasn't just attending a ritual to him it wasn't just synagogue to him the word was becoming alive he was the word and it was being manifested in his life it doesn't matter that you make it to all the camps this summer if you're gonna go go because Jesus went but you ought to be saying Lord let that can't be a holy convocation for my life praise the Lord they add more meaning to them a holy convocation and I want to say there's a regular meeting of people of God that has happened almost every week for centuries do you realize that they met on the first day of week the early Christians met on the first day to celebrate the Celebration Church on Sundays has been going on for centuries now there's a general meeting of the people of God but then but then there are significant movements or connections God makes with his people that are above the regular I could stop and give testimonies to that myself I've been going to church twice a week all my life but then there's those significant moments that I'll call Holy convocations in my life and I love those I love going to church but I like it when God makes contact with me and I walk out of there it doesn't matter about everybody else I know I've met with God personally today this has been a holy convocation with just me nobody else may get it I don't know but young person you need a holy convocation with God you don't need to just go to a camp but you need something deeper in your life and so these were movements or connections God made with his people above the regular they are spoke of in the Bible these holy complications they are crucial that we catch them and gather around these things spiritually you can come to church and read your Bible your whole life and still not be connecting with Christ or what he is doing now so these were so important and they've become even more important after Jesus comes because he comes to bring the spiritual fulfillment of every one of these feasts as I said Israel did them as a law and they acted out these gatherings every year even the seven feasts become a ritual to them but he didn't intend for that to happen he said I want you to be sober about this I want you to come together and when you come three times a year to Jerusalem I wanted to be a holy convocation I want you to know the meaning of what you're doing and I want you I want to connect with you I don't want it to be church as usual so I'm bringing this back up what is the difference in a graduation and a convocation then graduation is a term used to acknowledge that you have met your requirements and you have been approved to graduate from the program that's graduation that's a lot of that's going on right now convocation refers to the ceremony it's a different ceremony and incidentally getting here tonight he had two ceremonies he had one for the graduation and one for the convocation there's two of them Solomon had his together but it was it was too and it's the convocation refers to the ceremony where your credential will be conferred and confirm means you are granted or you're bestowed a title a degree a benefit or a right now I'm going to preach because you can go to graduations all day long and if you don't have you haven't been conferred the rights of what that degree is giving you you ain't got everything yet this holy convocation is something deeper than a graduation is something deeper than just coming and celebrating can you say Amen but it's something that it says it grants you it's the convocation refers to ceremony where the credential will be conferred to you the rights everything will come over to you so it's pretty exciting sometimes to come to the event I was very excited in December to go to both my son's graduations they're here tonight and it was very exciting for me because you know I've said to you that you know school is a more difficult thing sometimes for some of us levontans and so to see them finish four-year degrees I thought it was wonderful and and then and then so it was nice and exciting and I was going to show you a couple pictures I grad grabbed son you can turn that back on because I was just going to show a couple pictures because I'm very proud of these and this is the Gathering at the pear style for Gideon's graduation and his Gathering there and actually this was the time that they actually this I don't know if this was the conferring but this is the Gathering of all the people and they had it at the pier style there around Christmas time as you can see this is a very special evening everybody's there all the graduates come across the platform that was a special evening for me that was the Gathering and then we had Solomon there he is on the platform and he went across at UT this is a very special evening for him to go across there and receive his degree this is the graduation ceremony and then of course uh but I just wanted to say he receives that he he has the whole you know Pomp and Circumstance and all those other things but none of that really means anything until you have the paper until something is said and they said here in these ceremonies you have to actually say something the wording has to be and some of them it's you have to say it's it is a common language in graduation ceremonies at least in the United States to hear a degree conferred with these words all the rights and privileges pertaining thereto so this is different when it's the conferring it means they say on the paper and verbally he has met the requirements and now from this moment forward he has all the rights and privileges that go and awards that go with that degree oh I'm starting to feel like preaching now I'm starting to think of that book was sealed with Seven Seals I'm starting to think of that barrier that we were Believers we were saved by Calvary but there was still a breach there was still there was a barrier and there had to be a breach a break to get through those seals taken off and when he took him off in the last days he said he hath made us Kings and Priests oh I'm going to read a quote to you in the morning we have a great graduation ceremony but I'm going to read a quote to you that I read this morning and that is to say that that he our Kinsmen Redeemer stood up to claim rights his rights and then he says but it's rights for his own children amen let me finish this a minute so this is this is a nice time but it's nothing like when you actually receive the paper and prepared to paid for all this it's really exciting I didn't pay for all of it Solomon paid for some of it but this is a proud time and this was a proud time I'm not I'm not boasting tonight but I kind of am I mean I got these pictures up and it's just Wednesday nights just us I thought I'd put these up so this but you know the graduation everybody's there but this is different this is this is special this is the paper in your hand that means they have all the rights all the things that goes with it it's in their hand can you say Amen praise be to God oh wait a minute I shouldn't put that one in there how did that make it in I was going to keep those personal with me that should have stuck with me turn that off it has to have that wording all the rights and privileges pertaining thereto brother Brown said in this quote this last quote and then we're going to close about our kinserman now he is not an animal he took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne who was it the owner the original owner the title deed to this earth when Adam fell the title deed fell back into the hands of the original owner because Satan's hands were too dirty for it he wanted it but see that didn't belong the rights of this Earth didn't belong to Satan it belonged to Adam and Eve it belongs to Sons and Daughters of God but when man fell he lost the the rights to it and so it didn't go back in Satan's hand it went back into the hands of the original owner then you get to Revelations 5 and there's a change our lamb that went to Calvary 2000 years later now steps forth into the vision of John and he steps forth the owner the original owner that had the book of redemption in his right hand and no angel nor Angelic being nothing else could take the place to take that book no one's worthy to take that book back and this bloody lamb walked out and took the book out of his hand what was it brother this is the most Sublime thing in the scripture an act that not an angel not nothing could do it and the lamb come and took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and what is it now it belongs to the lamb amen that and that in itself should make us say oh blessed be the name of the Lord the title deed is back in the hands of my kingdom Redeemer it happened but he didn't keep it for himself God's law is required he's the one that holds it God's law required of kinsman redeemer and the lamb come out holding it look and he says I am their Kinsmen I am their redeemer I now I have made intercession for them for two thousand years he made a session only knows that's the scripture he was a high priest and he was making an intercession can you say Amen so he was the high priest of our confession for two thousand years I am the Redeemer I made intercession for them and now I've come to claim their rights for them amen there's all there's the only one so what did he come to do earlier on in the few paragraphs earlier he says he claimed come to claim his rights now later on he says I have come to claim their rights for them amen there's the only one I've come to claim their rights in that they have a right to everything that lost in the fall and I've paid the price in Revelations 5 that's what our lamb says to the devil I'm here to claim the rights for my children I'm holding this title deed and he actually says the prophet says he took it and he threw it to his Prophet down on Earth and then then spoke those things to the Bride of Jesus Christ that's why Revelations 10 10 7 does not end with seven verses I've been saying this Revelations 10 if it ended at verse 7 that means it's the days of the voice of the seventh angel it's all about the seventh angel no the seventh angel was on the earth at the time of this coming of the Lamb with the book open the seventh angel was on the earth because he was the one that was on the earth at the time of this coming then he threw that up to his Prophet to speak on Earth but it doesn't end with Revelations 10 7 it has four more verses and that is that then he says take the book bride John take the book and eat it can you say Amen through it to his Prophet on Earth but it didn't stay with his Prophet it's to get back into the hands of sons and daughters to God till they can start saying Satan I've got my rights back everything that I lost in the garden you may feel defeated tonight but you can say because of our lamb everything that Adam lost I've got back to me tonight I've got it back in my possession you talk about Authority it's been conferred can you say it's not just a graduation when we come to church it's not just you've graduated from a similar simmer you've graduated from a center to a Christian it's so much more than that well that's what I did Brother Paul yes praise the Lord but it's not just that you get a graduation and you went from a sinner to a Believer no you have rights that Calvary bought for you you've got a power to overcome habits in your life you got a power to overcome complexes in your life you've got a power to overcome gossip in your life you got a power to overcome habits that you couldn't break before you got a power to come in as Kings and Priests what's this Kings and Priests he after he opened the seals thou has made us Kings and Priests you may not feel like that tonight but this is what the word is making us Kings and Priests and you know what that means dominion and access to God I have dominion because I'm a king and I have access to God because I'm a priest yeah you want to come and have me pray you should believe that faith not in yourself you say if someone comes and prays ask for prayer to you you should say yum my lamb has made me a priest I have access to God and hopefully you're available and you haven't got a bunch of stuff in your life you've got to get under the blood and repent keep it keep clean say forgive me in my sins let me be available because I've got power here to bring a prayer to God this person can be healed of cancer you don't have to bring them to the pastor you can lay hands on them this this boy I refer to my son but it happens all the time I wonder sometimes if this is the third poll already happened you look for a manifestation is that you never hear some testimonies where he lays hands on the woman that's out for how many how many minutes uh the other day lay hands she's gone she's what do they call that flat line before they can get to her before they came in and get to her he lays hands on her she takes her breath and comes back they're going what happened what happened so now everybody okay well that just you see to me the third pole is beginning to work more and more in his people now I'm looking for something deeper than just Supernatural I'm looking for adoption maturity in the people of God and first with me because I got a lot of immaturities that God needs to burn out part of the third poll is that there will be a quiet secret work of little things that happen you know why it's happening because this word has made us Kings and Priests so you don't wait for the pastor to pray you have power in your prayer and Authority I'm going to lay my hands on this person I'm a sister here and I I'll go visit this person's house man but I'll tell them the pastor will pray though that's fine but guess what when you lay your hands on them in the name of Jesus you have access to God priests have access to God the whole world doesn't have that but you have dominion and you have access to God know how I love brother Brown getting excited about that don't that make you feel religious inside congregation says congregation says amen not by Good Works which we have done but by his Mercy I've come to claim their rights and they have a right to everything that lost in the fall I've paid the price Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord convocations is something deeper it's personal it's not just a gathering just a last note Jesus attended the regular meetings like you do and I appreciate that but then he was experiencing the reality in his heart while he was attending these things Luke 4 16 I'm closing and he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and his as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for it to read Jesus could have the attitude kind of like the children of Israel when it was time to go to another Feast they had to come during the season of that particular feast and worship under that they could have the attitude well I don't feel like going to the Feast of Tabernacles this year I think I'll I think I'll wait it out and wait till next spring couldn't do that to come and worship under the season and Christ could have said well I'm not going to attend these things because I'm the spiritual fulfillment there are people like that I don't need I got my Bible and I've got my and so I really don't need to be obedient to the word in these other things I told a young man one day I said you know I said the difference in me and you brother I said we're both Believers we'll both believe the message the last days we're both going to make a rapture because I believe that I don't have any right to put anybody out I said but the difference to you and me is that I need the faithful Ministry you don't need them but he knew it was the truth he don't need them I said I need the body of Christ because that's where Christ is in his body you don't need them couldn't say nothing I said I don't know how you get around those scriptures but listen I don't go for the people I don't go for there's a move of God happening in the Holy Ghost in the people of God for the last days if you don't realize that the bride is the final voice to the final age and this Christ that you believe is not some form that's up in the air somewhere it's living in his people and if you don't believe that's the final voice of the final age you don't know your Bible because it's the spirit and the bride at the Lazarus that say come where is he at he's not in his Corporal body he's not just in the preachers he's not the the pope is going to be the Incarnate Antichrist someday they're going to say it's Christ they still say now he's the biker of Christ but now he'll become the Incarnate Antichrist someday but where is Christ embodied if you know your Bible he's embodied in his people that's the final work of God and you may understand Bible prophecy and all events and these other things but how about this event how about this event Christ manifesting in his people so I I respectfully said that's a bit of difference I don't know how you get around those those things that say that in the last days this is the final work of the Lord what he's going to manifest through his people me you all the people of God and so to end this we gather together for church and for fellowship and for church time but there are some Divine appointments and holy convocations that God has for your life and we need both we need to attend can you say Amen Jesus as his custom Jesus had some good Customs he went to church it's okay to have good customs we need both we need to attend and B where the word is being preached but we also need some holy convocations with God we need those sacred times when God meets us personally and gives us Revelation and we see Christ in us living himself out that's not church as usual can you say man that's not just another synagogue Gathering that is the holy convocations worshiping under these feasts worshiping under where we're at right now is what God is calling every Prime member to in this hour it's a personal walk with the Lord every day and and let me say something about the times we live in do you think the age we live in in 2023 contributes to a a walk with God that's on fire I know do you think the access to our phones and into entertainments and gossip on social media do you think any of that contributes to the secret place that God's calling to us to none of it everything's against it everything is against that meeting of a holy convocation with you and God everything in our society is against it it's almost discouraging where you almost get discouraged even to keep preaching it but I'm not going to quit preaching it I'm not going to quit striving can you say man I want to rise to the occasions I won't be a little sin I don't lukewarm I won't be able to see it because you know what at the end of all the laodice and Luke Mormons you're rich and increased good and have need of nothing but I say the Holy Ghost says you're poor blind naked that's the state of the church it looks pretty miserable but at the end it just has those little things a little statement to him that overcome it because it says that I see my name right there I won't be lukewarm I won't be average I'm going to pray I'm going to keep praying I'm going to keep fighting I'm going to keep saying Lord I want holy convocations with you I want to meet with you I want to know you I want to know you every day that's what the message really produces can you say man that's what the message should produce adopted Sons and Daughters of God that are not just religion people that are just want to come and have a religion they have a personal walk with God and they're growing into adoption and they're getting their rights they're saying Satan wait a minute you can push so far but I got some rights here my kingdom gave me my rights back and I've got every right that was that Adam lost in the the garden I've got every one of those rights I don't want to remind Satan tonight every believer has everything that was lost in the garden has everything restored back to them we have access can you say Amen I got some right Satan and you can't take them away from me amen I'm glad to be a Christian tonight I'm glad for this word I'm happy for this I'm not perfect by any means except through the blood of Jesus Christ and I have enjoyed this study on this Wednesday night with you so tired so wore out from working and raising kids and to wore out from retirement that's even that even wears you out but you're here tonight you're listening online and we love the word of God can you say Amen somebody said I don't come because I'm tired on Wednesday nights and I said does that mean that none of the rest of us are tired it's only you I said we're all tired but we're out but you know what I believe that we got something greater than ourselves greater than our tired bodies that we can say Amen to and say Lord that's the image that was preached to me tonight I don't want just the Gathering I don't want just a synagogue Gathering I want a holy convocation with you amen young people when you're going to the camps this summer and I say goad and get in the environment of God but you know what you need to have this purpose I'm not going to go just for friends I'm not going just to be a part of a movement I'm not going just to get caught up in just something I'm going because I want to personally have a holy convocation with you that's why I'm going to that camp and if you have that in your heart say Lord I mean that I'm going for that reason I believe he wants to meet with you you come back home with something personal and somebody the rest of them all may miss something but you come back with something for yourself I'll walk with God yourself let's stand together tonight God bless you let's give the Lord a hand clap of Praise amen God is good all the time Heavenly Father we thank you for your word tonight study in your word Lord I stumbled my words and just trying to get it out the way you brought it to me today but I'm thankful Lord for a people of God that has the amenor in their heart they have something that's reaching out in their soul and saying that's the truth and we know the truth will set us free so Lord the seeds that I planted tonight whoever should hear Lord even out in the internet world and those who are listening in I pray you'll plant the seed Lord in their hearts and I pray their hunger would grow for you more truth in the name of Jesus Christ and Lord we'll give you honor we'll give you glory for what you've done in our lives and Lord though we be tired and body sometimes our spirit our soul is revived to know that our Kinsmen Redeemer has given back the rights to the people of God help us to stand flat-footed against the enemy Lord when he tries to abuse us and tries to twist our minds and tries to create a world some something for us to live in that's in defeat we're not called we're not called to live in this defeated state of this world that it's in we're not called to be a statistic I'm not called to be a nominal Christian I'm not called to be just a standard Christian I'm called to be on fire for you Lord and on fire for your word and be available a priest Lord that can touch God for people's lives and to live in Dominion where things aren't controlling me but I'm controlling things with the power of God it's exercising dominion over the enemy that's what Adam lost when he lost his authority and power then Satan would just kept knocking him around and man fell and fell and kept getting worse until today he's become Beast Lord without you but father you have given us back our rights as sons and we're not to be beasts we're to be Sons and Daughters of God we're not called to be a statistic of just being average someone who just says well I Believe In Christ but we're called to be Mighty Joshua Lord taking the land with the fervor of Christ within us that's what we're called to raise your church into the word that you said would be in this hour raise us into this Feast of atonement Lord that we recognize the power of what you did for us at Calvary raise us into the season we're in and may we recognize it Lord not look at the past not look at the future but look at where we're at right now we commit it to you and Commit This service to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God has given us the victory oh God has given us the victory by the word and by the Light
