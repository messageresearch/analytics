[0:04] get my clock
[0:11] all right verse 21
[0:13] it says keep yourselves in love of god
[0:18] looking for the mercy of our lord jesus
[0:20] christ unto eternal life
[0:24] and of some
[0:25] having compassion
[0:28] i believe what a day we're in that we
[0:30] should have compassion for one another
[0:32] the world's the choir saying they sing
[0:35] about a crook
[0:36] the world's basically falling apart but
[0:38] our god is the peacemaker
[0:40] he's our all-in-all but we should have
[0:42] compassion for one another
[0:44] and it says making a difference
[0:48] and others save with fear pulling them
[0:50] out of the fire
[0:52] hating even the garments spoiled by the
[0:54] flesh you may be seated
[0:57] father
[0:59] we just come before your throne tonight
[1:02] father we just come as an oracle for you
[1:04] lord not to be seen by any men
[1:07] father just to be in your perfect will
[1:09] tonight
[1:10] father may you speak to these youth
[1:13] may you come down in the mighty way lord
[1:15] may you touch their lives
[1:17] father this is where lives change
[1:19] in your presence
[1:21] father may you just anoint the service
[1:23] we thank you for the song service so far
[1:25] in your presence
[1:27] may you come down in a mighty way
[1:28] tonight we love you in jesus name amen
[1:33] i love that tonight where it says verse
[1:35] 22 and some of having compassion making
[1:38] a difference what a great time we're in
[1:41] to make a difference for the world
[1:44] i know it it seems like it's impossible
[1:46] but i tell you a christian can make a
[1:48] difference
[1:49] you young people can make a difference
[1:51] for jesus christ
[1:52] you can shine a light i don't care what
[1:54] the devil tells you what your friends at
[1:56] school or wherever you go to school at
[1:58] but you can make a difference in this
[2:00] dark world because if you ever took a
[2:02] flashlight and walked and i don't care
[2:04] if it's barely have any batteries in it
[2:06] and you turn it on and all the power
[2:08] goes out you turn on the weakest light
[2:10] and it could be the strongest light in
[2:12] that pres in that darkness it will light
[2:14] the whole room up and you don't even
[2:16] realize how much light you need so don't
[2:18] let the devil tell you that you can't be
[2:20] a light in this darkness
[2:23] and it says and others say with fear
[2:25] pulling them out of the fire
[2:27] and i believe one of what a greater time
[2:29] of the battle of satan is fighting all
[2:32] these young people today on every mind
[2:34] every mind battle you're going through
[2:36] but he's going to pull you out of the
[2:38] fire
[2:39] that's one thing i want to
[2:40] hone in tonight
[2:42] is having the whole armor of god on
[2:45] and every situation everything you do is
[2:47] to be equipped for the battle is to be
[2:50] equipped for the battle
[2:52] and so let's turn to ephesians
[2:56] ephesians tonight ephesians 6.
[3:02] verse 10.
[3:05] it says finally my brother
[3:07] be strong
[3:09] in the lord
[3:11] and in the power of his might
[3:13] if you're you want to under underline
[3:15] some words tonight the other underlying
[3:17] strong
[3:18] power and might
[3:20] you can be strong in the lord and you
[3:22] have his power of his might not your
[3:25] might tonight but it takes his might
[3:28] tonight
[3:30] now i want to just tell you young people
[3:32] paul is not writing this letter and he's
[3:34] not in
[3:35] sitting at his desk somewhere
[3:38] paul is in a prison
[3:40] paul his last words i want you to
[3:42] understand tonight some of the last
[3:44] words can be some of the strongest and
[3:46] more profound words today
[3:49] but he's he's saying something to you
[3:50] tonight could you write a letter like
[3:52] this and encourage the saints being in a
[3:55] prison cell
[3:57] paul's not home he's got some last words
[3:59] to tell you to be strong in the lord
[4:01] and the power of his might and it says
[4:04] put on the whole armor of god that you
[4:06] may able to stand against the wiles of
[4:09] the devil the
[4:11] so he's equipping you today he's
[4:13] equipping you with something to fight
[4:15] the devil and that's not the devil knows
[4:18] what spot brother said he knows what
[4:20] you've got to cover that spot up
[4:22] brother says he knows this weakest spot
[4:24] a christian has or we have as as
[4:26] believers and we have to cover that up
[4:28] the day we live in
[4:29] but i tell you i tell you it's one of
[4:31] one more time to cover that up one more
[4:34] time to shield it with with the lord
[4:36] jesus christ
[4:39] brother graham says oh i'm telling you
[4:41] when as soon as you say you've got the
[4:43] holy ghost
[4:45] satan's got every gun right on you
[4:48] he said then you got the whole armor on
[4:52] then you you take the of faith the
[4:54] sword of the spirit or the word and take
[4:57] the buckle and shod yourself with the
[4:59] gospel
[5:00] and take the old middle piece here the
[5:03] breastplate and pull and clench it up
[5:06] and tighten yourself a little bit and
[5:08] get ready boy because it's coming
[5:11] don't you worry he said yes sir you're
[5:13] going to have plenty of trouble
[5:16] but remember greater is he that is in
[5:20] you than he that's in the world that's
[5:24] the promise tonight that's what he says
[5:26] in the word and we got to take it
[5:28] take it i think we got to take the
[5:30] entire word and we got to clothe
[5:32] ourselves tonight with it
[5:36] he also says satan has no power
[5:40] only as he can bluff with it
[5:43] if he can bluff you into it all right
[5:46] you have it he said you'll have to have
[5:48] it
[5:49] but legally he has no power at all
[5:52] every power that was taken from him at
[5:55] calvary
[5:56] every power young people was taken at
[5:59] calvary i think sometimes we give them
[6:01] too much authority we give them too much
[6:04] credit and we're living in a day that we
[6:06] want to give the devil credit the only
[6:08] one worthy of credit is jesus christ and
[6:11] it's time to give him credit where
[6:13] credits do not to the devil but to jesus
[6:16] christ
[6:17] [Applause]
[6:18] he said he's doing nothing but a bluff
[6:21] he said if you ever want to listen to
[6:23] his all bl his bluff well all right
[6:26] but you don't have to you are free
[6:28] tonight
[6:29] so young people if you come chained up
[6:31] and you've been listening to his bluff
[6:33] he's been telling you this telling you
[6:34] that telling you're not a believer if
[6:36] you haven't met jesus christ and you
[6:38] haven't met him as a personal savior i
[6:40] encourage you tonight
[6:42] i provoke you tonight to meet jesus
[6:44] christ
[6:46] because i'm telling you if he could
[6:47] change this person he could change
[6:48] anyone tonight
[6:51] he said and now some some he says
[6:53] something in the word can make you
[6:56] realize that you are free by his grace
[6:59] he said if something realized in the
[7:01] word makes you understand or act of god
[7:04] that it that is included you
[7:07] it includes us all
[7:09] then you just accept it on those bases
[7:12] he said in your free you don't have to
[7:14] feel any different you don't have to
[7:16] feel anything at all it's not based upon
[7:19] jesus never said did you feel it he said
[7:22] did you believe it
[7:24] it's faith he said that's our faith
[7:27] faith is an arm a mighty arm that holds
[7:29] the two the sharp two-edged sword of god
[7:33] and that sharp two-edged short will cut
[7:36] away every promise
[7:38] if the arm the faith is able to yield
[7:40] that sword some people have has very
[7:42] weak muscle trouble
[7:44] and he says they can just maybe cut a
[7:47] little scratch enough to join a church
[7:49] others can just come into justification
[7:52] some can go all the way to the baptism
[7:54] of the holy spirit
[7:56] he said a strong arm holding this bible
[7:59] can cut every promise tonight
[8:02] that's right be strong in the lord
[8:06] so young people i'm here to tell you
[8:08] you're going to go through battles
[8:10] you're going to go through troubled
[8:11] waters you're gonna go through uh dating
[8:14] relationships tonight that will lead you
[8:16] to the wrong person
[8:18] you're by being it tonight i don't know
[8:20] but i'm just here to tell you you you
[8:22] need to line up with the bible tonight
[8:25] everything you do
[8:26] you need to line up from jesus to
[8:28] revelation and every every person you
[8:30] talk to everything you do hey if they're
[8:33] not of god then get away from them
[8:36] you know what because you know why you
[8:38] stay in a pig pen long enough you'll
[8:39] become
[8:40] just muddled up like a pig as well
[8:43] but i'm here to tell you young people to
[8:44] stay out of the pig pit i'm not saying
[8:47] go talk to them and encourage them but
[8:49] don't get caught up being sucked in to
[8:51] where they're at
[8:53] don't be caught up sucking the devil
[8:55] telling you well i'm i'm strong enough
[8:58] no we're not strong enough with our
[8:59] might it takes jesus christ in jesus
[9:02] christ alone and you gotta use his might
[9:04] tonight it's a dark world and it's it's
[9:07] chaos but i tell you greater is he

[9:11] world

[9:19] against flesh and blood but blood grants
[9:21] principalities against powers against
[9:24] rulers of darkness in this world against
[9:26] spiritual wickedness in high places
[9:29] and brother bram says
[9:31] he says in this
[9:33] he's talking about in the scriptures he
[9:35] said that's right oh my precious faith
[9:37] precious glorious faith god gave me
[9:40] faith god gave me faith by abraham by
[9:42] faith isaac by faith abel offered him to

[10:15] you he tries to shoot his arrows but may
[10:18] i have that shield of faith always
[10:20] before me to withstand the wiles of the
[10:22] devil

[19:22] all devils slide their uh slot slide
[19:25] their brakes when they see that when
[19:27] they see that the full armor of god the
[19:29] true baptism of the holy ghost amen he
[19:32] said that seated coming straight from
[19:36] the throne of god dressed
[19:38] in the full armor of his resurrection
[19:41] the full armor of his resurrection
[19:43] i believe we gotta we're living in such
[19:45] a late hour but everyone preaches a
[19:47] message out of this called the greatest
[19:49] battle ever fought
[19:51] and i believe we're in a time that is
[19:53] the greatest battle but i tell you we're
[19:55] here to overcome this battle
[19:58] we're on the winning side today
[20:00] and i tell you he talked about been jude
[20:02] pulling you out of the fire pulling you
[20:03] out of the fire you think about the
[20:05] hebrew children tonight and you think
[20:07] about when they went up to the fire
[20:09] nebuchadnezzar they heated it seven
[20:11] times hotter
[20:12] seven times harder tonight and here they
[20:15] are they said you know what i don't care
[20:16] i'm going anyway and you know what
[20:18] brother bram says he asked the three
[20:19] boys one of them looked at the hebrew
[20:21] children one of them looked at each
[20:23] other he said are you prayed up now
[20:27] he said are you prayed up now he said
[20:29] yeah we can go in now brother braham
[20:31] says this i love how he brings it out he
[20:33] says are you ready he said yeah i'm good
[20:34] now i'm prayed up
[20:36] because he started talking to the master
[20:39] and when the fires and things get rough
[20:40] out here talk to the master sometimes i
[20:43] tell you he's the master of the wind
[20:45] he's the master of all situations he
[20:47] knows it all before it starts and he can
[20:49] put the fire out
[20:51] but i like what he said i wanted to
[20:52] share some of you tonight he didn't
[20:54] imagine he didn't throw them to where
[20:56] they made the mistake if they would have
[20:57] threw them one by one
[20:59] think about it he said when two or three
[21:01] are gathered he's in the midst
[21:04] when he said two or three are gathered
[21:06] he's in the midst so where they made a
[21:08] mistake was is when they started
[21:10] throwing them as all as a group
[21:13] because jesus had to honor his word
[21:17] he had to honor his word so when they
[21:19] when they went to throw them in there
[21:20] they threw them all together so jesus
[21:22] had to show up
[21:24] and so i'm telling you it takes me he
[21:26] takes you he takes these young people
[21:28] tonight to get in jesus christ it takes
[21:31] all of us in the body of christ not to
[21:33] be fighting not to be complaining not to
[21:36] be murmuring not to be talking about
[21:38] this person and now i found this there
[21:40] was a cloud there wasn't a cloud look
[21:42] there is nothing but everything if he
[21:44] said it was the cloud there was a cloud
[21:46] if he said this or whatever the bible
[21:48] says you believe it tonight
[21:50] you believe it tonight
[21:52] you believe with all your heart
[21:55] but i'm so glad what brother brahm said
[21:57] about that
[21:58] you know what he said he said you know
[22:00] the three hebrew children went down
[22:01] there and he says they got to the
[22:03] furnace i love how brother brandon
[22:04] brings it out he says they get to the
[22:06] furnace
[22:07] and he says he heats it seven times
[22:09] higher the guards were dying
[22:11] he gets down there and all of a sudden
[22:13] he says the angels come to god and ask
[22:15] permission to go down there
[22:19] he asks god says gabriel all these the
[22:22] angels came up to him and said hey you
[22:23] want me to go put it out with water you
[22:26] see your people down there you know you
[22:27] know what jesus tells me he says no he
[22:30] said this is for me
[22:32] this is for me that's our god protecting
[22:34] you today that's our god when you go
[22:36] into a situation god gets off the throne
[22:39] says i'm going to go down there because
[22:40] i have to honor my word and i tell you
[22:42] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[22:44] word will not so i have to honor my word
[22:47] and he's here every time young ones he
[22:50] will honor every word if you stay in his
[22:52] words
[22:53] and stay with all your heart
[22:56] stay in it
[23:01] he will honor it
[23:02] and i'm so glad he does
[23:05] because i'll tell you i'll fail you
[23:07] men will fail you your parents will fail
[23:09] you but jesus christ i'm pointing you to
[23:11] one that will not fail you that will get
[23:13] you through every battle that gets you
[23:15] through every situation to get you get
[23:18] you through a uh a

[26:11] keep your life in a book
[26:14] keep your life in the holy word of god
[26:17] keep it in the holy word of god
[26:23] take the whole
[26:24] take 17 and take the helmet of salvation
[26:26] the sword of spirit which is the word of
[26:29] god
[26:30] as brother uh
[26:32] solomon
[26:34] comes tonight
[26:36] don't let this alarm you
[26:45] we have a fireman here tonight
[26:50] and i believe that we're going through
[26:52] fiery darts today
[26:55] but i want to just bring out some things
[26:56] about this fire suit tonight young
[26:58] people
[26:59] that want to share with you this is not
[27:01] just some ordinary suit
[27:03] you can't go through a fire without
[27:06] getting on a suit that's fire retardant
[27:09] you can't just go to a fire casually
[27:11] dressed up i know we like to chase fires
[27:16] i know we like to see when smoke is out
[27:18] there way out in the distance and we go
[27:20] running and looking for the fire
[27:22] don't you worry the fire is coming
[27:24] looking for you
[27:26] the devil's looking for you you don't
[27:28] have to chase it
[27:30] but i tell you he's got this fire suit
[27:32] on tonight
[27:34] and
[27:35] just thinking in jesus christ's terms to
[27:37] bring it down to your level this is fire
[27:39] retardant and when you get holy spirit
[27:41] brother brad says they can't burn the
[27:43] holy spirit out of you
[27:45] now i don't care how hard they put the
[27:47] fire on tonight they can't be no matter
[27:50] how far they can't burn the holy spirit
[27:52] out of you
[27:53] but there's a few things tonight i want
[27:55] to bring out in the scripture it says in
[27:57] verse 17
[27:58] and take the helmet of salvation in the
[28:00] sport the sword of the spirit which is
[28:03] the word of god so you see he's got this
[28:05] helmet on tonight
[28:08] and you know what a fireman does when
[28:09] he's going through the ambers there
[28:11] might be a fireman tonight so you can
[28:12] correct me later
[28:14] but i got this suit from the fire
[28:16] department
[28:17] god bless them
[28:18] and i tell you what you think about the
[28:21] helmet of salvation tonight you'll need
[28:23] to put the helmet of salvation and look
[28:26] through the shield of jesus christ and
[28:28] everything you look through in life you
[28:30] look through the shield tonight and with
[28:32] everything you see you look to a cross
[28:34] in your rearview mirror and you look
[28:35] through jesus christ it's about what you
[28:38] put in your life what in your eyesight
[28:40] tonight what are games whatever it is
[28:43] how much time are you spending with
[28:45] jesus
[28:46] but when going through a fire he's got
[28:48] this fire suit on but the ambers won't
[28:50] hit him in the head
[28:51] the ambers things of this world won't
[28:54] hit you in the head and knock you out
[28:56] and get you down and the devil say just
[28:58] stay down
[29:00] but it burning it protects your mind
[29:04] and then the breastplate the breastplate
[29:06] of righteousness
[29:08] it says right here
[29:10] it says in verse
[29:11] stand there for having your loin skirt
[29:13] about with truth have it on the breast
[29:15] place of righteousness and i'm here to
[29:18] tell you if you look at his suit tonight
[29:20] if he turns around
[29:23] i want to bring something out tonight
[29:24] that really just lit me on fire
[29:27] that
[29:28] if you look at this suit if everybody
[29:30] can see this
[29:32] it stands for charlestown volunteer fire
[29:35] department
[29:36] do you see any name on here of who is in
[29:39] this suit
[29:40] do you see any name
[29:43] think about it when you get buried in
[29:46] jesus christ
[29:48] and when you take on his name
[29:51] you are representation of jesus christ
[29:55] hey i'm here to tell you tonight you're
[29:57] no longer yourself but you're identified
[30:00] with jesus christ
[30:02] you're identified with the one that
[30:04] wants to represent you
[30:07] and i love that because they have no
[30:09] name but the representation of who they
[30:11] represent
[30:13] and that's what young people tonight you
[30:15] know that everywhere you go everywhere
[30:17] you go they're looking at your life
[30:20] and they're seeing who you represent
[30:23] another thing about this fire suit
[30:24] tonight as he turns around
[30:26] as the reflectors on it
[30:29] and i started thinking about when
[30:30] they're going through a fire they have
[30:31] to see one another because they're
[30:33] looking for one soul or one child or one
[30:36] adult whatever it is and i'm the same
[30:38] way here tonight everywhere we travel
[30:40] it's just one more soul for his kingdom
[30:43] because he said one soul is worth 10
[30:45] million worlds
[30:46] that's more than any money you can make
[30:48] and you know what that's just not for
[30:50] the preachers tonight that's for
[30:51] everybody in this church you can go out
[30:54] there and be a be a light in this dark
[30:56] world and touch a soul or touch a young
[30:59] one i don't care who it is tonight but
[31:01] you reflect jesus christ everywhere you
[31:04] go you reflect this message you reflect
[31:07] jesus christ you represent jesus christ
[31:10] everything's jesus christ
[31:13] and that's what you got to know when
[31:14] they're going through a fire and they're
[31:15] crawling through amber's are falling
[31:17] they want to see each other they want to
[31:19] see each other
[31:21] and his job is to save one more
[31:25] and another thing is if you look through
[31:26] his fire suit tonight if we can take it
[31:30] he's got
[31:31] suspenders on
[31:33] he's got suspenders on and that's what
[31:35] holds the the bottom suit to the top
[31:38] part
[31:39] and i'm telling you young children
[31:40] tonight young adults
[31:42] if you'll take this word of god and you
[31:44] let it shield your life and take the
[31:46] hormone of god and let it let it buckle
[31:49] you together from bottom to the top to
[31:51] your head to your heart to all of it
[31:54] and let it shield and let it buckle let
[31:56] this be your buckle let the word of god
[31:58] cinch it up tonight
[32:00] and everything you go through you give
[32:02] it the word test
[32:04] everything you go through life dating
[32:06] living your life whatever it is for
[32:08] jesus christ you line it up with jesus
[32:10] christ if it doesn't line up then get it
[32:12] out of your life
[32:14] but you shoot it you remember this you
[32:17] buckle up and then the roman soldiers
[32:19] would do the same thing they had their
[32:20] armor and they would have their bottom
[32:22] top part and they would cinch it up and
[32:24] they would switch it up and they would
[32:26] tighten it up and it would all put it
[32:28] together
[32:32] and you see these boots tonight but
[32:34] that's not regular boots
[32:36] they're also fire retardant when they go
[32:38] through fires they have special boots
[32:40] they have and you know what when you get
[32:41] filled with the holy ghost he can carry
[32:43] you through every situation
[32:45] every situation you go through every
[32:48] trial you go through the thing sometimes
[32:50] why we struggle so much is we haven't
[32:53] got let god release his holy spirit in
[32:55] us
[32:57] and release and fully relinquish ourself
[32:59] and say lord you take my life you take
[33:02] control
[33:03] you take control
[33:05] and there's a couple things i want to
[33:06] bring out tonight
[33:08] as he comes down here down the front i
[33:10] want you to see this
[33:12] there's two things that they said that
[33:14] they give the firefighters i was talking
[33:16] to a couple firefighters

[33:39] they learn the instruction manual from
[33:40] front to back before they get in the
[33:42] fire
[33:43] because he said he wants to see and know
[33:46] what he's going to be enter
