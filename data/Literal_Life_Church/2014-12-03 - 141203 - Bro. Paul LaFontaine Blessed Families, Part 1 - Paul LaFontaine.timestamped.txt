[1:45] in thee shall all the families of the
[1:47] earth be blessed so praise the Lord God
[1:51] wants to bless
[1:53] families um I'm already thinking of the
[1:56] end of uh the sermon marriage and
[1:58] divorce where brother brandom which is
[2:00] by the way is more than a sermon it's a
[2:02] revelation uh as he brought the
[2:03] revelation of marriage and divorce and
[2:05] brought those things and he gets to the
[2:07] end and of course the lord gave the word
[2:09] to a prophet the same as God gave Moses
[2:12] a writing of divorcement for their day
[2:14] to deal with the problems that they had
[2:16] and then brother bradam was given a word
[2:18] for this age that they should go and not
[2:20] do it again but to not to try to bring
[2:22] families uh marriages and go back to
[2:25] their original marriages but to stay as
[2:26] you are but to never do it again and
[2:29] he's in that announcement from God that
[2:31] they just go and sin no more and uh be
[2:34] forgiven of what they've done I really
[2:36] believe it was a pronouncement through
[2:37] the prophet from God for the age and for
[2:39] the time and then as brother Brown prays
[2:41] at the end I've mentioned it to you
[2:43] before one of his statements he makes in
[2:45] the prayer is that and God make these
[2:47] families happy make these families
[2:50] blessed that's CU because that's the end
[2:52] result of God if he brings his word and
[2:54] brings his principle he's wanting to
[2:56] bless us and he's wanting to bless as
[2:58] the scripture say says here God wants to
[3:01] bless families and so right at the very
[3:04] beginning of the true Faith seed in
[3:07] Abraham God mentions a blessing to the
[3:10] families right away and this may turn
[3:12] out to be a little serious in the family
[3:14] it's been a long time since we talked
[3:15] about it and uh it's I think it's been
[3:18] quite a few years so this may turn into
[3:20] a series but I was wondering what makes
[3:21] a family blessed what makes a family
[3:25] blessed and we might as well take the
[3:27] other side what makes a family uh come
[3:29] under a curse because many families come
[3:32] under a curse and so this is not what
[3:34] God's talking about here he's talking
[3:36] about the families of the Earth being
[3:37] blessed but if you have families that
[3:39] are blessed then you certainly have
[3:40] families that come under a curse of some
[3:42] kind and it might behoove us to research
[3:45] the scripture and to look and pray and
[3:47] to say what is the difference in being a
[3:49] family that's blessed and a family
[3:51] that's cursed what's the characteristics
[3:53] of a family that is truly blessed and
[3:56] we've often said to you it's not just a
[3:58] family that would have uh we thinking
[4:00] blessing a few months ago we were
[4:02] talking about prosperity and in the
[4:03] world we live in we often when we hear
[4:05] the word blessing we often think of uh
[4:08] monetary Prosperity or money and we have
[4:10] plenty of funds but we can't use that as
[4:13] a criteria of being blessed only that
[4:15] because there's a lot of families with
[4:18] uh lots more money than what we have I
[4:20] guarantee you and uh they're not blessed
[4:23] of God they're actually a curse on that
[4:24] F but they have plenty of money so we
[4:26] can't make that our goal is that that's
[4:28] the definition of being blessed
[4:30] can you say amen that's that's not
[4:31] necessarily it so what is God's
[4:33] definition of blessing and whatever
[4:34] God's saying here as far as families
[4:36] being blessed we certainly want to have
[4:38] that and be underneath that and then
[4:39] maybe look at what brings families under
[4:42] curses sometimes and I don't know how
[4:44] much this will open up but we definitely
[4:45] see a time that we live in where Satan
[4:49] is uh attacking every component of a
[4:51] normal family um and and if we look at
[4:54] that we have to see what curses and
[4:56] blessings are the scripture speaks quite
[4:58] a bit about curses and blessings
[5:00] the scripture speaks about being under a
[5:02] curse and being under the blessing and
[5:04] also that God can actually lift a curse
[5:07] take someone that's under a curse their
[5:09] entire lives even and God can bless them
[5:11] and lift that curse from their life and
[5:13] they're not under that curse I guess the
[5:14] greatest example is that we're all born
[5:16] under a curse of a serpent nature and
[5:19] through the blood of Jesus Christ the
[5:20] power of God strikes that soul and we're
[5:22] lifted from the curse of the serpent
[5:24] nature and become blessed of God so
[5:27] blessing and cursing is in the scripture
[5:29] and the curse of course there's a lot of
[5:31] meanings to that someone could uh swear
[5:33] at you and curse at you but uh curse
[5:36] means could mean also a magical thing
[5:38] that's placed over somebody like some
[5:40] type of pronouncement as somebody places
[5:42] a curse on somebody's life but really
[5:44] the meaning deeper than that is that
[5:46] when you have a curse it's a cause of
[5:48] trouble or bad luck in other words
[5:50] Trouble Comes there's trouble that comes
[5:52] on someone that's cursed or some family
[5:55] that's cursed and so we realize that
[5:58] Satan God wants wants to bless families
[6:00] but Satan wants to destroy families and
[6:03] Satan loves to bring people under curses
[6:06] Satan loves to bring even Christians
[6:08] under a curse sometimes where they're
[6:11] hit just hitting trouble all the time
[6:13] and I don't mean I don't mean just
[6:14] normal troubles we're going to have
[6:16] troubles in this life I'm talking about
[6:18] being under a curse of something that
[6:20] you can't lift it it's actually a a
[6:22] demonic thing that hold you down and
[6:24] Satan has certainly brought curses on
[6:27] the family and he's attacked every
[6:30] component of a normal family in this
[6:33] hour through Hollywood and through his
[6:36] different means and through the early
[6:38] years he begin to dismantle things and
[6:40] he doesn't start at just the marriage he
[6:42] starts at the single people before
[6:44] they're married that's how he destroys
[6:46] the family is he wants to start with the
[6:48] young people so now we have a
[6:50] youth-driven generation that Satan
[6:52] influences and uh upon them to put
[6:55] images in their mind and cause single
[6:57] people to be destroyed in their minds
[7:00] and destroyed in their bodies even
[7:02] before they get to a wedding day and and
[7:05] that's Satan's work to bring a curse on
[7:08] the family right he can curse a family
[7:12] 10 years from now that not even married
[7:13] or have children yet by working through
[7:16] that single single young person and and
[7:19] plaguing their minds and getting their
[7:21] minds on all kinds of trash of the world
[7:23] filling with all kinds of images and
[7:25] ideas and all these other things and by
[7:27] that he's destroying a huge component
[7:29] oent of the family he's bringing a curse
[7:32] on the future family by doing that cuz
[7:34] that's what he wants to do so he he he
[7:36] takes it from the angle of the single
[7:39] people and and uh trying to get our guys
[7:42] and our girls influenced in so many ways
[7:44] and trying to get them to lose their
[7:46] virginity whether emotionally or
[7:48] physically before marriage TR and if he
[7:50] doesn't do that to mess with their minds
[7:53] and so that they're not they don't look
[7:55] at things normally they don't look at uh
[7:58] relationship normally they don't look at
[8:01] sexual experience normally it's all
[8:03] twisted it's all become worldly that's
[8:06] how Satan destroys the normal
[8:10] family that's how he brings a curse on
[8:12] then he works on marriages then he
[8:14] attacks marriages and whatever is normal
[8:16] he brings abnormal then he attacks the
[8:19] children by attacking the children he
[8:21] destroys the component of the family can
[8:23] you say am man he's destroying the
[8:25] family by working on the children then
[8:26] he destroys the image of what a woman is
[8:29] right and by that in turn destroys the
[8:32] family yeah then he destroys the image
[8:34] of what a real man is which I really
[8:35] believe that's a place he really starts
[8:37] too because when the men are destroyed
[8:40] in their image of what normal is it has
[8:42] a trickle down effect that's why we have
[8:45] Abraham here who becomes such a powerful
[8:47] force to all the families in the earth
[8:50] one man with the faith he had can have
[8:53] the influence of all the families in the
[8:54] earth that's a pretty strong influence
[8:56] amen one man in his position position
[8:59] right with faith acting upon God can
[9:01] influence entire families and thus
[9:04] influence entire chur entire churches
[9:07] because if you influence the family you
[9:08] influence the church right so uh we're
[9:11] going to get into that because that's a
[9:12] powerful powerful force but when he when
[9:15] he destroys normality in men and what a
[9:19] normal man is when he destroys what a
[9:21] normal woman is he's destroying the
[9:23] family that's what he's trying to
[9:25] destroy but when he destroys the
[9:27] marriages and tries to attack the
[9:28] marriages he's destroying the family
[9:31] God's structure God's hope and God's uh
[9:35] goal to have a blessed blessed families
[9:39] it says it right here that all the
[9:41] families the effect of the faith of
[9:43] Abraham God says not that your business
[9:46] would be blessed not not that your money
[9:48] would be blessed money's not mentioned
[9:51] there business isn't mentioned
[9:53] there and we spoke on it before I
[9:55] believe God wants to bless those things
[9:57] too but money in business is not me
[9:59] there the trickle down effect of a man
[10:01] of faith is to bless families to bless
[10:05] families not your business but bless
[10:08] your family and that's that's what God
[10:11] considers we're going to get into a
[10:13] minute God just loves it God loves to
[10:15] bless families and see healthy normal
[10:18] Spirit-filled families that are
[10:19] functioning in Union and Oneness
[10:22] together he loves it he loves for his
[10:24] body his people in his church to
[10:26] function in unity and thus he that
[10:29] that's the family of God and thus the
[10:31] families that are going home and living
[10:32] with one another every day he loves for
[10:35] them to be in unity Satan's work is to
[10:38] try to break that up and to divide amen
[10:41] so now he destroys all the normal
[10:44] components and he changes all the normal
[10:47] things mostly through Hollywood he
[10:50] changes the normal components of a
[10:52] family and he dismantles the normal
[10:55] family and Satan's final display I I
[10:58] believe in his world is uh is is
[11:01] flaunted to this world in a new show
[11:03] called Modern Family that ex that's out
[11:06] there today that shows the most Twisted
[11:10] full of full of homosexuality
[11:12] full of sexual perversion full of
[11:14] disobedient children full of constant
[11:17] disrespect between the husband and wife
[11:19] between the children and parents and a
[11:21] homosexual couple and all this all these
[11:24] three different families in a TV show
[11:26] called Modern Family that's Satan's
[11:28] final uh Capstone as it was in this age
[11:32] to express this is what Norm normal is
[11:35] and it's he's flaunting himself at
[11:37] destroying the normal
[11:40] family he's flaunting it yeah because
[11:43] none of that is anywhere near what a
[11:46] normal family should be it's a
[11:48] completely perverted view of it can you
[11:51] say Amen exactly right but here we have
[11:55] if as we look at this there is a source
[11:57] even in Genesis 12
[11:59] that if it were here that families could
[12:02] become blessed we could say so much more
[12:04] about the curse on families and maybe
[12:06] we'll get to that more in another
[12:08] service but uh be it known be it known
[12:11] that we're in an hour where at every
[12:13] moment Satan is trying to attack your
[12:17] family and God is wanting to bless your
[12:20] family God is wanting to bless your
[12:22] marriage God is wanting to bless your
[12:24] family God is wanting to bless your
[12:27] relationships because it's all about
[12:29] relationship yeah with God it's all
[12:32] about relationship amen so now we see in
[12:36] Genesis 12 then that here what Abraham
[12:40] has done what God did in Abraham has a
[12:43] trickle down effect on the family and
[12:45] it's so powerful that it can affect all
[12:47] the families in the earth in other words
[12:50] if they were to come into this faith
[12:52] that Abraham had it becomes the source
[12:55] that all the families on the earth can
[12:56] be blessed this faith Abraham and I want
[12:59] to just say it's not just his faith but
[13:01] his it's his action to his faith it's
[13:04] his life with his faith it's it's h as
[13:08] we were mentioning on Sunday it's not
[13:09] just what we live well I'll just live it
[13:11] in front of them that speaks worlds
[13:13] that's a great thing but sometimes it's
[13:15] our actions also it's it's our words as
[13:18] well can you say amen and and and with
[13:21] Abraham it's his actions it's it's not
[13:23] we know that he had Faith but how do we
[13:25] know it James says we know he had Faith
[13:28] by his works by his actions that's the
[13:31] only way we knew he had faith and so if
[13:33] you go into Abraham's life he's not a
[13:35] perfect man by any means but
[13:37] nevertheless there's enough actions of
[13:39] Faith there that Express such an example
[13:43] to the rest of the Believers throughout
[13:44] the ages and not only is it an example
[13:47] but the power of it can trickle down and
[13:50] affect families to be
[13:53] blessed praise the Lord
[13:56] so God wanted to bless this blessing to
[13:59] pass on to the families doesn't mention
[14:02] your job doesn't mention the business
[14:04] why why is it that way because really in
[14:06] the mystery of God friends this is what
[14:08] God was trying to do if we go back to
[14:10] the beginning God himself would fulfill
[14:13] his
[14:14] loneliness by creating a family of his
[14:18] own the whole principle of the mystery
[14:21] of God is based upon God feeling lonely
[14:24] and God creating a family for himself
[14:27] God the lonely God wanted a family
[14:30] Angels weren't close to him Angels
[14:31] worshiped him that wasn't family that
[14:33] wasn't kin to him can you say am man
[14:36] that was something that worshiping
[14:37] that's a different type of relationship
[14:39] he wanted a family he wanted a bond he
[14:42] was lonely and wanted something of his
[14:44] own kind that's why in Genesis 1:2 you
[14:47] hear that of Their Own Kind let them
[14:48] produce of their own kind as God's
[14:50] saying that about all the fishes of the
[14:52] sea and all the foul of the air he's
[14:54] bringing out a revelation that I I I
[14:57] want I want something in my own kind I'm
[15:00] lonely here I want a fellowship God
[15:03] wanted a
[15:05] family it's in the mystery of God and he
[15:08] would fill his loneliness with a family
[15:10] that was God's answer to his loneliness
[15:12] now if you're lonely we live in an age
[15:16] that there's a lot of different things
[15:17] to fulfill your
[15:19] loneliness but is anybody interested
[15:21] here tonight in going the way God filled
[15:23] his
[15:25] loneliness God fulfilled his loneliness
[15:29] with his family that he
[15:31] created he didn't run to something else
[15:33] God's not running over the corner
[15:35] playing video
[15:37] games God's not running here and just
[15:39] and and and neglecting everything else
[15:41] and God's not getting fulfillment out in
[15:43] the the trees that he created he saw
[15:45] that that was good but as he kept coming
[15:48] along every day in creation it's good
[15:50] it's good it's good but all through
[15:52] those five days he is still lonely right
[15:55] and on the sixth day when he created
[15:57] this masterpiece this man he said this
[16:00] is good this was actually real good to
[16:03] God because now he's seen the potential
[16:05] of male and female being there the
[16:07] potential to bring a family that he
[16:09] could fellowship with that's why he got
[16:11] so excited about it that's why he come
[16:13] to his his uh uh climax his great
[16:16] achievement through creating man because
[16:18] that's the thing that would bring forth
[16:20] this Fellowship can you say Amen the
[16:23] same and just make a note of that the
[16:25] same loneliness in God is the sometimes
[16:27] the same loneliness in man and Fallen
[16:30] man will reach for something else to be
[16:33] fulfilled or to be at peace and that's
[16:36] often the breakup of a family sure first
[16:39] of all man doesn't turn to God for his
[16:41] Fellowship right man does not let God
[16:45] answer his
[16:48] loneliness might I just stay on that
[16:50] just a minute every human being
[16:52] experiences that and even Believers
[16:54] experience it and you have to learn that
[16:57] we have to reach out and run to our god
[17:00] in our
[17:02] loneliness God wants to fellowship with
[17:05] us God is often saying my child I want
[17:09] to fellowship with you I want to talk
[17:10] with you and how often we turn to other
[17:13] things to fill that void of loneliness
[17:15] so you're going to see the trickle down
[17:17] breakup effect of a family if you have a
[17:20] man who in his loneliness begins to turn
[17:22] to other things other than God and other
[17:25] than his family because God turned to
[17:28] his family God's answer to his
[17:30] loneliness was his family yes can
[17:33] somebody say praise the Lord praise the
[17:34] Lord and if that's what's God an is that
[17:37] if that how that's how God answered his
[17:39] cry in his heart then that should be our
[17:42] cry as
[17:43] well praise the
[17:45] Lord and so now we see then that uh in
[17:48] the mystery of God he would fulfill that
[17:51] even a man when he's fallen he will
[17:52] reach for something to fulfill at peace
[17:54] but it'll reach to something else even
[17:56] to the place sometimes a man will will
[17:59] walk away from his family and neglect
[18:01] his family he's a lonely man but he'll
[18:04] walk away from his family and neglect
[18:06] his family because he's so bent on
[18:08] thinking that his loneliness will be
[18:10] fulfilled through something
[18:13] else uh so many examples not here but
[18:16] out that we're my wife and I are praying
[18:18] about in certain marriages and different
[18:19] things that's taking place and I'll tell
[18:21] you uh it's when a man steps out of his
[18:25] position and his place and begins to
[18:27] walk into Worlds by self he begins to
[18:29] neglect his family he begins to walk
[18:32] away from his family the very thing God
[18:34] gave him is fountains to drink from to
[18:36] fill his loneliness and the Very God
[18:40] that is meant to fill that loneliness he
[18:42] starts to walk away from it he starts to
[18:44] fill it through something else and then
[18:47] is the breakup of the
[18:49] family then you have people still living
[18:52] together but there's no
[18:53] Oneness because the heart has turned to
[18:56] something else other than his wife
[18:59] for his loneliness yeah he's turned to
[19:02] pornography or he's turned to something
[19:05] of the world and men can do it but women
[19:07] can do it too and we have so many
[19:10] different attractions in this day
[19:11] friends we have so many choices laid out
[19:14] before the for before us in our
[19:16] loneliness it's like we got a book here
[19:18] and we've got this here and we got so
[19:20] many attractions here and I'm not even
[19:22] saying all of them are sinful things I'm
[19:24] just saying we have to be really careful
[19:26] what we fill our loneliness with when
[19:29] God is craving to talk to us sometimes
[19:31] we'll go for weeks and not fellowship
[19:33] with him and God is saying I want to
[19:35] talk with you I want to fellowship with
[19:37] you that's what I created you for yes
[19:41] but we're we're taught in this
[19:42] generation to use all of our different
[19:45] sources to make us feel peaceful let me
[19:48] let me just show take it a step further
[19:50] read back in Genesis 1 here Genesis 2 so
[19:53] he created on the Sixth Day verse 26
[19:56] chapter 1 verse 26 and God said let us
[19:58] make man in our image after our likeness
[20:01] and let him have dominion over the fish
[20:02] of the sea over the foul of the air and
[20:04] over the cattle and over the Earth and
[20:06] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[20:08] on the earth so God created man in his
[20:09] own image in the image of God created he
[20:12] him male and female created he them and
[20:16] God blessed them and God said unto them
[20:18] H here it is be fruitful and multiply
[20:21] God setting up the whole thing so it's a
[20:23] creation of a family he's got the
[20:26] potential laying there of a family
[20:29] that's why he's so excited about this be
[20:31] fruitful and multiply replenish the
[20:33] Earth subdue it and have dominion over
[20:35] the fish of the sea the foul of the air
[20:36] over every living thing that moveth upon
[20:38] the Earth and God said behold I have
[20:39] given you every herb bearing seed which
[20:41] is upon the face of the Earth and every
[20:43] tree in which the fruit of the tree
[20:45] yielding seed to you it shall be for me
[20:47] and to every beast and then verse 31 he
[20:50] says and God saw everything that he had
[20:52] made and behold it was very good there
[20:57] there is a very good and behold it was
[21:00] not just good it was very good praise
[21:05] God because he wasn't got any fellowship
[21:06] with a tree right there was no
[21:09] fellowship with a foul of the air can
[21:10] you say am man his loneliness could not
[21:13] be fulfilled through some foul of the
[21:15] air right this this is Val
[21:21] good this is very good because this has
[21:24] the potential to create more family to
[21:27] fellowship with
[21:29] that's what God gave joy in God's
[21:32] heart praise the Lord and so now then he
[21:37] creates the things but in man it was his
[21:39] crowning achievement to make male there
[21:41] was a man and male and female was in
[21:44] that man both male and female was in
[21:45] that man how many know
[21:48] that and not only was that marriage that
[21:51] male and female there and that because
[21:53] the male and female part was there then
[21:55] he could say multiply and replenish and
[21:58] so potential there laid there for a
[22:00] family because of this Grand achievement
[22:03] I I remember a brother used to call it
[22:05] his crowning achievement was man with
[22:08] male and female in him that was God's
[22:10] Masterpiece God's crowning achievement
[22:13] was here he is a man and he is supposed
[22:15] to have dominion over the he's a minor
[22:17] God on the earth he will do all these
[22:19] things but what was the main purpose of
[22:21] it to fulfill God's loneliness I have a
[22:24] counterpart all the other uh animals had
[22:26] a counterpart but but uh God didn't have
[22:30] a counterpart now he did and when he
[22:32] created Adam he really didn't have a
[22:34] counterpart and that's why when he
[22:36] created man after the end of it he
[22:38] created it and then when he when he
[22:40] formed man in Genesis 2 from the dust of
[22:43] the Earth can you say am man then he
[22:47] says these words and I want you to read
[22:48] it because maybe it's it's been a while
[22:51] maybe you haven't read it
[22:52] before
[22:55] uh let's just pick it up here verse 7
[22:58] chapter two and the Lord formed man of
[23:00] the Dust of the ground and breathed life
[23:01] into his nostrils the breath of life and
[23:03] Man became a living soul and the Lord
[23:05] planted a garden Eastern and Eden and
[23:07] there he put the man whom he had
[23:09] formed and
[23:14] um Verse 18 and the Lord said it is not
[23:19] good that man should be
[23:21] alone I will make him a help meat for
[23:24] him he's addressing the loneliness
[23:27] again so
[23:29] every other thing in the Kingdom had a
[23:31] counterpart but Adam didn't and God said
[23:33] that wasn't good cuz God could relate to
[23:36] him not having a counterpart to
[23:37] fellowship
[23:39] with
[23:41] so uh and out of the ground he formed
[23:45] every beast of the field out of the foul
[23:46] of the air and brought them unto Adam to
[23:47] see what he would call them and so it
[23:50] goes on and on but I want you to notice
[23:51] something here
[23:52] now here he put the he he put the seed
[23:55] in everything to reproduce he put the
[23:57] seed to reproduce
[23:59] and now I have the potential now with
[24:00] male and female to reproduce and bring a
[24:02] family and you know that's what God
[24:06] hates about a hybrid seed how many know
[24:08] what a hybrid seed is they they
[24:11] mechanically inject something in it to
[24:14] make the fruit of it come a lot more um
[24:18] abundant sometimes that's what science
[24:20] does they hybrid the seed so you might
[24:22] have more of a crop you might have it
[24:24] bigger more beautiful but there's one
[24:27] problem with the hybrid SE
[24:28] it can't reproduce
[24:32] itself that's why God hates a hybrid
[24:36] seed because his purpose was to
[24:41] reproduce his purpose was that was bring
[24:44] it would bring forth more of his family
[24:46] Sons and Daughters of God so he could
[24:48] fellowship with them and so a seed
[24:50] that's hybd won't produce it reproduce
[24:52] itself that's why we should begin to
[24:54] pray and be concerned because a church
[24:57] that can't reproduce it self with
[24:59] baptisms and souls coming to the Lord is
[25:01] becoming
[25:03] dead that is a great concern to a
[25:06] Believer because a hybrid seed can't
[25:08] reproduce itself but when there's a true
[25:11] pure seed there it will reproduce and
[25:14] bring forth more not many numbers but it
[25:17] will bring forth more and more and more
[25:19] and so God hates a hybrid seed and it
[25:22] because it can't re reproduce itself and
[25:24] when God then when God labored did you
[25:27] notice now down chapter 2 it says thus
[25:30] the chapter 2 verse one thus the heavens
[25:32] and the Earth were finished and all the
[25:33] host of them and on the seventh day God
[25:36] ended his work which he had made and he
[25:38] rested on the seventh day from all his
[25:40] work which he had made and God blessed
[25:42] the seventh day and Sanctified it so God
[25:45] came into his rest after when he had
[25:47] labored for all those days then he
[25:50] rested after the potential for a family
[25:54] was there that's when God rested because
[25:56] why he knew that's where his Fellowship
[25:58] would come
[26:01] from he could enter into a Sabbath now
[26:03] he could enter into a rest now because
[26:05] he didn't need to create anymore he come
[26:07] to his final achievement he come to his
[26:09] final thing I did all that leading up to
[26:12] Bringing so I could have my family so I
[26:15] can fellowship and once God has a
[26:17] blessed family on Earth that he can
[26:19] fellowship with he's reached his Sabbath
[26:22] he's reached his rest he's reached his
[26:25] peace there isn't anything further that
[26:27] I need to create
[26:30] and if we could learn that that God came
[26:33] to his real peace and rest after he had
[26:36] Union and fellowship with his son and
[26:39] daughter there was no more why are we
[26:41] itching for more maybe there's something
[26:43] more that's why a man walks out and
[26:46] walks away from family and walks away
[26:48] from the devil's got him itching for
[26:50] more looking for more a Wonder lust
[26:54] right maybe there's a new model maybe I
[26:57] should get another wife maybe I should
[26:58] do this and he's come under the
[27:00] influence of the power of Satan when he
[27:02] does that not under the power of God
[27:04] because under the power of God a man
[27:06] enters into his rest with his family God
[27:10] did that God came to a Sabbath praise
[27:14] God I'm in fellowship with my
[27:18] family and when a man is restless and
[27:20] walks away from that he's under the
[27:22] power of Satan right not God
[27:26] yes so
[27:29] so he enters into this rest he did not
[27:31] enter into the Sabbath until the
[27:33] fellowship of his own kind came in
[27:35] Hebrew says there's a rest for the
[27:37] people of God did you know that Hebrews
[27:38] the book of Hebrews says there remaineth
[27:40] a rest we have a Sabbath as well that
[27:43] Sabbath is the Holy Ghost and you know
[27:46] what that means that means many times
[27:48] Christians labor for years and their
[27:50] labor trying to do Works trying to work
[27:52] it up trying to please God trying to do
[27:54] all this trying to do it for it and then
[27:56] but that's not the Holy Ghost when you
[27:58] really bring that final entrance into
[28:00] the Holy Ghost it is your Sabbath
[28:02] because you realize this isn't about
[28:04] works this is about fellowship with my
[28:07] father this is a family my father has
[28:10] come into relationship with me I've come
[28:12] into Union through the Holy Ghost and so
[28:15] I don't need to labor to try to do
[28:17] something for God or gain my salvation
[28:19] it's a peace it's a Sabbath yay there
[28:22] remaineth a rest for the people of God
[28:25] he said enter into your rest enter into
[28:28] your fellowship realize that your walk
[28:31] with the Lord just talked to someone
[28:33] here last Sunday afternoon after church
[28:35] and and just just being taught in wrong
[28:38] types of churches being taught hanging
[28:40] over hell that if I do this little thing
[28:42] am I going to go to hell am I going to
[28:44] go to hell a complete false concept of
[28:46] God can you say Amen but oh when you
[28:49] begin to learn what God's kingdom really
[28:51] is then you enter into AR rest that this
[28:53] isn't a labor to try to somehow work out
[28:55] your work your salvation through and
[28:58] become gain your way through merits or
[29:01] bonus points into heaven can you say
[29:03] Amen you enter a rest in the Holy Ghost
[29:06] that what is this Christian Life all
[29:07] about it's about fellowship with the
[29:10] father and it's about fellowship with
[29:12] the other Sons and Daughters of God
[29:14] because you're my did you notice all
[29:16] these names and titles it's not
[29:18] president and all these other things
[29:19] it's brothers sisters father son that's
[29:22] the terms in the Bible why because it's
[29:24] a family father son Brothers sisters
[29:29] family family not Bishops and presidents
[29:34] and positions and trustees and deacons
[29:38] that's all you know we got to do that
[29:39] for the books but what this really is is
[29:41] a family amen can you say amen and so
[29:44] just like you long to fellowship with
[29:46] the father you long to Fellowship in
[29:49] worship with the brothers and
[29:52] sisters it's a natural thing for a
[29:55] Believer to want to be in Fellowship
[29:58] ship with his brothers and sisters if
[30:00] they don't desire that anymore and they
[30:02] can't come to church to do that
[30:05] something is wrong in their
[30:07] relationship Case Closed something is
[30:10] desperately wrong because the normal
[30:12] natural thing that's why brother Bram
[30:14] says a Believer can't wait to get to the
[30:16] house of God when the doors are open he
[30:18] has to get there what's that come from
[30:20] some Duty or something absolutely not
[30:23] it's from this craving to be Associated
[30:25] and to be in communion and fellowship
[30:28] with the family of God and my father
[30:30] that doesn't mean you can't fellowship
[30:32] with the father outside of the church
[30:34] but being in the house of God where the
[30:37] word is being preached I think it's a
[30:40] very important thing to be there not
[30:42] because of Duty but and and Duty would
[30:45] be fine but it has to be something
[30:47] deeper it comes natural people want to
[30:50] be in fellowship with one another and
[30:53] with their father in this way can you
[30:55] say Amen praise the Lord so he entered
[30:58] into a Sabbath we enter into a Sabbath
[31:00] with fellowship with the father and his
[31:02] sons and that's why it's normal to want
[31:04] to worship and be with the body of
[31:06] Christ if you don't desire that anymore
[31:08] something's happening in your life
[31:10] something's gripped you that's not
[31:11] normal right some some other things
[31:13] gripped you and that's not to condemn
[31:16] anybody here or anybody who's not here
[31:18] at church tonight if you're listening on
[31:19] the uh uh streaming I'm not here to
[31:22] condemn anybody I'm just saying you have
[31:24] to go to prayer and say if you've lost
[31:26] that natural thirst to say I want to be
[31:29] there where the word Springs being
[31:30] preached I want to be in Fellowship I
[31:32] want to worship with the Saints I want
[31:34] to partake of the Lord's supper with the
[31:36] Saints I want to do it because they are
[31:38] my family if you've lost that you've
[31:40] lost the normality of what a family of
[31:42] God is and something else has gripped
[31:45] you something else has gripped you
[31:47] because that's what's normal so now he
[31:51] God wanted to bless his family in God's
[31:53] heart that is everything Faith will do
[31:56] many things now let's get to Abraham now
[31:58] I never knew this was going to take so
[31:59] long I was going to be short
[32:02] tonight when I get on something that I
[32:04] really like it's just hard to get off of
[32:06] it so now God wanted to bless his family
[32:09] in God's heart uh it was everything to
[32:12] him to fellowship with his family now
[32:15] faith will do many things faith can do
[32:18] many things but look at this scripture
[32:22] is that the faith of Abraham brought
[32:25] back in Genesis 12 the faith of Abra
[32:27] Abraham shall have a trickle down effect
[32:30] and cause the families of the earth to
[32:33] be blessed now Faith can do many things
[32:36] faith will do many things but when it
[32:39] blesses the family I believe it reaches
[32:41] its crowning
[32:47] achievement that's where it shows up the
[32:50] best is when it blesses the
[32:54] Family Faith can do a lot of things
[32:56] faith can raise the Dead faith can open
[32:58] up blinded eyes I've seen it happen I've
[33:01] seen a blind man I was seven eight years
[33:04] old I've seen a blind man he was prayed
[33:05] for in Lima there and his eyes were open
[33:08] and he shouted around the church for the
[33:09] next two hours on his own ran around the
[33:12] church so I knew he was completely blind
[33:14] his eyes were open that was a good thing
[33:16] for me to see because I could you could
[33:18] you could say what the what he did in
[33:20] the Bible he does today he's still real
[33:23] faith can do many things Faith nothing
[33:25] is impossible with faith can you say
[33:27] Amen but you see now when Faith blesses
[33:31] a family in true blessing I believe it's
[33:34] reached its crowning achievement to see
[33:36] Christ expressed through that
[33:39] family in because how is it expressed
[33:42] it's expressed in Oneness they come into
[33:44] Oneness with one another any normal
[33:46] family the husband is one with the wife
[33:48] the children are one with the parents
[33:50] they come into Oneness what is that
[33:52] Oneness a reflection of the Oneness
[33:54] between God's people and God that's the
[33:56] expression of the mystery of God
[33:58] that Christ could have preeminence in a
[33:59] people when that's expressed every day
[34:01] in coming across in the in the in the
[34:03] richness of a family or the blessing of
[34:05] the family it's re faith has reached his
[34:07] crowning achievement in creation it's
[34:10] this image of male and female that had
[34:11] the potential for a family being in
[34:13] Oneness that's what that's what God was
[34:16] God's crowning achievement was it it
[34:18] moved the heart of God this is very good
[34:21] he said when all creation has a
[34:23] counterpart but Adam God said it's not
[34:25] good uh uh notice now he says Adam's
[34:30] alone it's not good Adam is there he ha
[34:34] he can create worlds if he wants to he
[34:37] names the animals he can move mountains
[34:40] if he wants to notice that and God still
[34:42] says it's not good come on now are you
[34:45] catching what I'm saying because of his
[34:49] loneliness God is there with his son and
[34:52] he's named the animals and he can move
[34:54] mountains and he has all power and all
[34:56] Faith as a son of God to do all things
[34:59] and God says it's still not good because
[35:01] he's
[35:02] lonely because he don't have his
[35:04] counterpart it's amazing isn't it God's
[35:06] lifting up that importance of fellowship
[35:08] and
[35:09] Oneness more important than Faith to
[35:12] move mountains my think about it think
[35:15] about
[35:16] it it's amazing he could do anything but
[35:20] it still was not good so let's talk
[35:23] about the faith of Abraham before we
[35:24] bring it to a close here tonight this
[35:26] kind of faith in a
[35:28] man just a simple common man but God
[35:33] gives this man a promise he believes
[35:36] that promise God gives him a revelation
[35:38] of that promise and then the actions he
[35:41] took with that Faith begin to bring the
[35:44] results he had an action with his faith
[35:48] and God spoke the promise it dropped an
[35:51] Abraham's heart he acted on the promise
[35:54] he positioned himself toward words the
[35:58] promise and by the way he acted and by
[36:00] the way he positioned himself and the
[36:03] faith that he had this kind of Faith
[36:06] would look at it make thee a great
[36:08] nation bless thee I'll bless them that
[36:11] bless the and curse them that curse of
[36:12] thee and it'll it'll affect all the
[36:15] families of the earth to be blessed
[36:18] amazing this kind of Faith this kind of
[36:20] man with this kind of Faith this kind of
[36:23] action to his faith never seen this
[36:25] before never seen it quite this way
[36:27] before
[36:28] this kind of Faith with this kind of
[36:29] action where he didn't even know where
[36:30] he was going he just begin to act in
[36:32] obedience to God God gave him a promise
[36:35] God spoke get thee out he began to move
[36:38] on that promise can you say amen and
[36:40] when he begin to move on that then this
[36:42] is the thing that brought such a
[36:44] powerful effect upon the Earth he was
[36:47] elected he was called then he obeyed
[36:49] because there was certainly specific
[36:51] things that came with the promise here
[36:53] he receives a a word of the Lord to go
[36:55] out he's going to be become I'll make
[36:58] you a great nation I Will Bless thee
[37:00] later on he articulates more what God is
[37:02] going to give him uh as a child make him
[37:05] a father many nations but he has given a
[37:07] promise but I want to say something to
[37:09] you there were specific things that went
[37:12] with the promise specific things Abraham
[37:15] had to do that went with the promise now
[37:17] you can stand there all day long and say
[37:20] I believe the promise I believe the
[37:21] promise God said it I believe it I
[37:24] believe the promise but the difference
[37:25] in Abraham is he had actions in
[37:28] obedience that went with the promise
[37:30] right amen and the very first one was is
[37:34] in verse one when God
[37:36] said get thee out of thy country and
[37:39] from thy Kindred and from thy Father's
[37:40] House well it seems kind of strange
[37:42] because we're talking about families
[37:43] here tonight and God says but that
[37:46] family you're going to have to get the
[37:48] out and really what God is saying is
[37:51] that you can't stay there around that
[37:54] atmosphere and become what I want you to
[37:56] become you're going to have to pull away
[37:58] from that there is a separation always
[38:01] in God from the world from Associates of
[38:05] the world from influences of the world
[38:07] and from influences of unbelief Abraham
[38:11] you can't stay there and Abraham quickly
[38:13] acted upon that all right we're get
[38:15] we're getting up we're going huh get
[38:17] your stuff together we're we're packing
[38:19] up we're getting out of here where you
[38:20] going I don't really know but I have a
[38:22] promise of God God said this is the
[38:25] first thing he said to do I've got to
[38:26] separate my myself look at The Obedience
[38:29] I'll do
[38:30] it I don't have all the details I don't
[38:33] understand it all but something's
[38:34] dropped in my heart I've heard from God
[38:36] yes I'm going to act upon this in
[38:38] obedience I'm going out now friends we
[38:41] need more men of obedience to act upon
[38:45] the
[38:47] promise good we need more men like that
[38:50] we need more faithful men like
[38:53] that Abraham was not a perfect man and
[38:56] we'll find that right even in the next
[38:58] chapter remember all of his mistakes
[39:01] were completely blatantly all there in
[39:04] the Old Testament but they weren't in
[39:05] the
[39:06] new God washed them away in the New
[39:10] Testament and I've thought I've often
[39:12] said why why did that happen why does
[39:14] God take all of those mistakes that were
[39:16] there and now they're washed away in the
[39:18] New Testament because that's how God's
[39:20] covenant works when he has a covenant
[39:22] with the people of God and the Covenant
[39:24] is stronger than your mistakes can you
[39:27] say amen God's covenant with you is
[39:29] stronger than your
[39:31] mistakes God's covenant with Abraham his
[39:33] promise with Abraham was stronger than
[39:35] any of his mistakes and so even though
[39:38] he was an a perfect man and that's not
[39:40] what we're trying to present tonight is
[39:41] that if you're a perfect man you're
[39:42] going to have a bless family no if
[39:44] you're a man of faith that acts upon the
[39:47] promise can you say amen that's when
[39:50] families will be blessed not that you're
[39:52] a perfect man but you're a man of faith
[39:54] in the promise of the hour and you act
[39:57] upon on that promise of the hour that's
[39:59] what blesses family that's the kind of
[40:01] men we need we need more men like that I
[40:04] could preach on women all day long
[40:05] there's a lot to say about women I could
[40:07] preach on the children I could preach
[40:08] but you know what we need more than
[40:10] anything else more men of faith that
[40:13] believe the promise of the hour and
[40:15] their families know what they believe
[40:17] they know where they stand and they act
[40:19] upon what that promise says to do we
[40:21] need more men like thatall and we're
[40:23] seeing more destruction of fam sometimes
[40:26] because we don't have that pivotal that
[40:29] that strong point look at the power here
[40:31] Abraham himself when he's positioned
[40:34] right in his place can affect all the
[40:36] families of the earth so brother you a
[40:39] husband and father of your family you
[40:41] have a powerful effect upon your family
[40:44] how you position yourself in your
[40:47] response to the word and the promise of
[40:50] this day and what God says to do and
[40:52] your obedience to it has a huge trickle
[40:55] down effect to your kids no matter how
[40:57] young they are to your wife thank you
[41:01] praise the Lord so the life the actions
[41:06] the obedience to God in Abraham's life
[41:08] he never wavered on anything the Bible
[41:10] says in the New Testament he staggered
[41:11] not at the promise of God it was the
[41:14] promise of the hour he believed he set
[41:15] the example for all the ages he set the
[41:18] example when we have men of Faith like
[41:21] that we will have more blessed families
[41:25] brother Bram said and when he was a
[41:26] promised son
[41:28] and when he was promised a son and he
[41:30] waited uh 25 years to receive that son
[41:33] calling anything contrary to it as
[41:35] though it wasn't so and then in this sun
[41:38] all the families of the Earth was to be
[41:40] blessed and the patriarch was faithful
[41:43] to his call and the promised word that's
[41:46] what he was faithful to he was an
[41:48] example to what we should be now we
[41:50] being dead in Christ we are Abraham's
[41:52] seed so notice that word example he was
[41:54] an example Abraham was an example to his
[41:56] family Abraham was example to
[41:59] Generations to come of a man that
[42:01] staggered not at what at did he make
[42:04] mistakes yes but he staggered not at the
[42:06] promise of God he wasn't in one day and
[42:09] out the other day he wasn't believing it
[42:11] one day and not believing the next day
[42:13] he was consistent in before the world
[42:16] can you say amen for 25 years if you ask
[42:19] the same question you're going to get
[42:21] the same answer from Abraham amen this
[42:25] consistency had an effect can you say
[42:27] Amen this faithfulness this example we
[42:30] need daddies and fathers to be better
[42:32] examples and realize that your actions
[42:34] and what you do and your consistency in
[42:37] being in the house of God your
[42:38] consistency in sharing the word with
[42:40] your children your consistency in
[42:42] overcoming your temper whatever it is
[42:44] your family needs to see that type of
[42:47] example in your life because if you give
[42:49] the wrong example you may not see the
[42:51] results now but you're going to see them
[42:54] five years later right I'm going to go
[42:56] ahead and say it
[42:57] if you look 5 10 years down the road and
[42:59] wonder why your children are in church
[43:01] it's maybe because you weren't very
[43:02] faithful in church if you weren't there
[43:04] Wednesday night then you'll say I wish
[43:06] my kids were here tonight that was the
[43:08] example that you set that it wasn't a
[43:10] priority to be there on Wednesday night
[43:12] and it's going to trickle down effect to
[43:13] your children now you won't see them in
[43:15] church cuz Daddy didn't make it a
[43:17] priority so they're not going to make it
[43:18] a
[43:19] priority I said it I said
[43:23] it but we do things sometimes because
[43:26] it's right can you say Amen but we also
[43:29] do it because of the the Eternal
[43:31] examples the the long trickling fact
[43:34] examples of images it sets in our
[43:36] children's
[43:38] Minds good that's the kind of man I'm
[43:40] talking about here can you say amen he
[43:42] believed the promise of the hour but his
[43:44] actions expressed his
[43:46] belief his obedience expressed his
[43:50] belief praise the Lord everybody still
[43:53] love me praise God Amen it's the truth
[43:56] where the you want to say ouch or
[43:58] whatever it is it's the truth
[43:59] nonetheless this thing this isn't
[44:01] something that's brand new to this
[44:02] generation this is from Generation all
[44:04] the way back to the very beginning is
[44:06] that even even he said in the Leviticus
[44:08] he says the the sins of one generation
[44:11] will pass down to the third and fourth
[44:12] generation brother Brandon brought that
[44:14] up says there's something about that
[44:16] that shows us that there's a long-term
[44:18] effect of what we do now I tell single
[44:20] young people that what you're doing now
[44:22] could even affect your children
[44:24] someday our decisions right now can
[44:27] affect our
[44:28] grandchildren you see so we have to have
[44:31] a long range vision of this when we want
[44:33] to be a father of Faith Can you say Amen
[44:37] it's not just saying I believe the
[44:38] promise of the hour you we stand on the
[44:40] promise of the hour but our actions
[44:42] every day reflect our
[44:45] belief because we're are examples amen
[44:49] say Amen if you can do it praise the
[44:54] Lord and so then this last quote he says
[44:57] Abraham coming from Babylon with his
[44:59] father down into
[45:02] shinar the valley of shinar where the
[45:04] souls of many journeyed after destroying
[45:05] of Babylon or the confusion taking place
[45:07] Abraham's father parent brought Abraham
[45:09] and his loved ones down to shinar and
[45:11] all that land among all those people F
[45:13] God found favor with one one man found
[45:16] favor with God rather and I want you to
[45:18] notice that is the beginning of
[45:20] Christianity of the church and I want
[45:22] you to notice it wasn't listen now it
[45:24] wasn't because Abraham was a good man it
[45:27] was because God elected and chose
[45:29] Abraham it wasn't Abraham choosing God
[45:32] it was God choosing Abraham can you see
[45:35] it and now watch now as it was then so
[45:37] it is today it isn't you choosing God
[45:40] it's God choosing you now this may be
[45:43] very strong and I want you to notice
[45:44] immediately after Choice immediately
[45:47] after God's election God chose Abraham
[45:50] I'm choosing him this is the one I
[45:52] choose it wasn't Abraham choosing God it
[45:54] was God choosing Abraham after that
[45:57] election right after that it's
[45:59] separation from everything else as soon
[46:01] as he calls it's the first thing that
[46:03] happens separation he elects calls and
[46:06] then when he calls he separates you from
[46:08] everything that hangs on to you and that
[46:11] proves that it isn't a denomination it's
[46:13] two it isn't two or three people
[46:15] together he expects every individual
[46:17] it's an individual affair with every
[46:19] person it isn't because my mother there
[46:22] is saved that I get
[46:25] saved no no see there now you're talking
[46:28] grandchildren now you're talking you
[46:31] know you're you're you're making it
[46:33] mechanical there in the sense it's it's
[46:35] you doing something it's not because
[46:38] your mother's saved that I'll be saved
[46:39] it's because God chose me in Christ and
[46:42] I want to see it now you're choosing
[46:43] yourself not your choice how much you
[46:46] prayed it's not how much you prayed you
[46:48] turned a new page you had nothing to do
[46:50] with it oh my when you get to see that
[46:52] that that's what the truth is you say
[46:54] you mean that I didn't turn to the Lord
[46:56] no sir you had no way at all of turning
[46:59] to the Lord your whole nature your whole
[47:01] makeup was against
[47:03] God or if we could come to this friends
[47:05] then we come into a real piece that you
[47:09] it wasn't you searching for God it was
[47:11] God searching for you God then we get a
[47:14] revelation of his love yes then we start
[47:17] to respond in faith I can love a god
[47:19] back like that I didn't have anything my
[47:21] whole makeup was against God our whole
[47:23] nature was against God called you it's
[47:25] always been that way in the garden of
[47:27] even when man sin look at the nature of
[47:28] the sinner hiding but it should have
[47:30] been Adam calling God but it was Adam
[47:32] hiding and God calling Adam you see
[47:34] that's the nature of a sinner hide run
[47:36] away get behind something but God's
[47:38] calling God's Amazing Grace God was
[47:41] calling and now notice you say oh that
[47:43] was Adam and Eve it's always Through the
[47:45] Bible the same way Jesus said no man can
[47:47] come to me except my father draws him is
[47:49] that right and that's the word and
[47:51] that's the way we want it the word when
[47:53] you know where you're standing how many
[47:55] are Christians tonight know that you're
[47:57] Christians there's something in you that
[47:59] says you're a Christian all right you
[48:00] see why you should be let me end on this
[48:03] this is a good one end on because this
[48:04] is what I began with he said if you're a
[48:07] CH how many are Christians tonight raise
[48:08] your hand there's something in you that
[48:11] says you're a Christian all right you
[48:13] should be the happiest people in the
[48:17] world isn't that amazing I started on
[48:20] that tonight and this is where I'm
[48:21] ending you should be the happiest people
[48:24] in the world you should just believe
[48:26] that my that's easy just take God's word
[48:29] for it God's word you didn't choose
[48:31] yourself God chose you like God elected
[48:35] and chose Abraham and now because he
[48:37] realized he didn't do anything to Merit
[48:39] this or it was just out of the clear
[48:40] blue God called him and so now he could
[48:43] begin to respond in faith and in action
[48:45] of his faith I believe the promise of
[48:47] the hour it's dropped in my heart and
[48:49] now all the details that go with it
[48:51] Abraham was obedient to those details
[48:54] because it's just not the promise what's
[48:56] the promise of this hour what's the
[48:57] promise of this hour what's the many
[48:59] promise there's many promises but a a
[49:02] bride in Ephesians he says I'll wash you
[49:05] by the water of the word and I of a
[49:06] spotless bride that's a promise of this
[49:08] hour the Rapture is a promise of this
[49:11] hour but it's not just the promise of
[49:13] the Rapture there's specifics in this
[49:15] age under the prophet that he said that
[49:18] test our
[49:21] obedience you believe the promise oh I
[49:23] believe the promise of the Rapture I
[49:24] believe the promise well where's your
[49:26] actions that go with the promise where's
[49:29] your life that comes o under obedience
[49:31] to him we want to offer that kind of
[49:33] Faith to him that our faith has Works to
[49:36] it and actions to it and then to
[49:39] conclude friends that's the kind of man
[49:41] that's the kind of Faith that's the kind
[49:43] of actions to Faith that had such a
[49:46] powerful effect and now all of a sudden
[49:48] he says the families will be blessed by
[49:51] a man like
[49:53] that have to to just bring the family
[49:58] through all kinds of
[50:01] teaching get the man straightened
[50:04] out amen get the man real strong faith
[50:09] and over time that family will be
[50:13] blessed that family will be blessed told
[50:16] my kids the other night I said to them
[50:18] listen and they know their daddy's not
[50:20] perfect I said hopefully guys I can show
[50:23] you that I I believe the promise of this
[50:26] hour
[50:27] and that you are under a blessing even
[50:29] when you obey that even when you don't
[50:31] understand it even if I express
[50:34] something say this is what the word says
[50:36] this is what the prophet says as for me
[50:38] and my house will serve the Lord this is
[50:39] what we're going to do in our home good
[50:42] and if you come under that obedience
[50:43] until you even don't understand it
[50:45] there's a blessing that comes to
[50:47] Children how many knows are blessing
[50:48] Obedience of children true y it's a
[50:50] commandment with promise right do you
[50:53] even get to live longer
[50:55] Gideon remember that promise
[50:58] right be around a lot longer if you B
[51:01] Daddy it's a blessing it's a commandment
[51:04] with a promise and so it has a trickle
[51:07] down effect to the
[51:08] children that even in them believing and
[51:11] obeying it because they have enough
[51:12] reverence for Daddy's fear of the
[51:16] Lord God daddy's not a perfect man but
[51:19] he's got the fear of the Lord and he
[51:21] reverences when he does something wrong
[51:22] he he apologizes for it but he's stable
[51:25] in this fact he believes the promise of
[51:27] the hour and he's trying to bring his
[51:29] life into obedience to the specifics of
[51:31] that promise that's right when kids will
[51:34] obey that come underneath it there's a
[51:36] blessing even that goes with that even
[51:38] when they don't understand it true
[51:40] because if we present it too much to our
[51:42] kids that you can do whatever you want
[51:44] to until you have a revelation of it I
[51:46] know you're only five years old
[51:50] but you can do whatever you want you're
[51:52] 18 years old now you're out on your own
[51:54] whatever you want to decide to do will
[51:56] be fine no living in my household we've
[51:59] already decided what we're going to do
[52:01] and that's serve the
[52:03] Lord so I don't decide and they don't
[52:05] decide whatever they want to do we're
[52:08] under the headship of God Amen this
[52:10] isn't this isn't Daddy's opinions we're
[52:12] aligned under the headship of a prophet
[52:14] of the hour that's back to the Bible can
[52:17] you say am man and that's how the order
[52:18] of the home is set up these aren't my
[52:20] opinion so we bring oursel underneath
[52:22] that if there's a question that raises
[52:24] we don't know what it is we don't know
[52:25] where it's at in the word well we study
[52:27] it and pray about it and and look to all
[52:30] the things that we can look at and then
[52:31] we make a we make a judgment call this
[52:33] is what we're going to do we have to do
[52:35] that but there's a there's a blessing
[52:38] friends I'm hoping you're catching this
[52:40] tonight God wants to bless the
[52:44] families and I say on the earth we live
[52:46] in today that a lot of the families are
[52:48] come under the curse but still with this
[52:51] Faith there will be some families on
[52:53] this Earth that are blessed let me
[52:55] qualify some things here tonight by
[52:57] saying to you if you have a broken
[53:00] home if you come from a broken
[53:03] home don't feel left out of this message
[53:05] here tonight if you're a bachelor not
[53:08] married don't feel left out of this
[53:10] message tonight so we have some of
[53:13] those because you know what you're
[53:15] loneliness you're you could you're
[53:16] clinging to family don't cling to that
[53:18] uh uh nice new
[53:22] car you'll never get full thrill out of
[53:24] that you cling to your family cling to
[53:27] God can you say Amen so you're right in
[53:30] with all the rest of us you're not
[53:32] detached from us if God chooses that you
[53:34] shouldn't get married in this life
[53:36] that's fine you're part of us I've often
[53:38] said to brother Tom not to embarrass you
[53:41] brother Tom he never had any physical
[53:43] children but he has hundreds hundreds of
[53:46] children that he is mentored and that
[53:48] he's fathered and that he's blessed and
[53:51] that he's influenced can you say Amen so
[53:54] don't try to figure out all the how this
[53:55] happens God has his plan and I just want
[53:57] to present it to you tonight that's what
[53:59] God's all about is relationship family
[54:02] can you say amen that's what God's
[54:04] achievement is is when that is blessed
[54:07] then God comes into his Sabbath that's
[54:10] what I want to
[54:11] see it starts with the right kind of
[54:13] Faith let's stand together and Worship
[54:15] the Lord God bless
[54:17] you let's just pray first and they can
[54:21] know play a little bit and we'll just
[54:23] pray before they before we s a song
[54:27] together well this has been good
[54:30] tonight to think that God thinks that
[54:32] much about families he really
[54:34] does there's such a strain in this day
[54:37] to pull families apart and many come
[54:40] from broken homes and many homes
[54:42] experience troubles and struggles and I
[54:45] don't want you to feel left out tonight
[54:47] if you went through that as a child or
[54:48] whatever uh sometimes trials are allowed
[54:51] in our lives to teach us things but all
[54:54] you need to do is hold on to the promise
[54:56] of God and God can bless what you've
[54:59] laid before him God can bless that the
[55:01] promise still holds true can you say
[55:03] Amen praise the Lord let's pray would
[55:05] you just pray with me if someone want
[55:08] you to just speak to the Lord on these
[55:09] things Heavenly Father how great this
[55:12] has been tonight Lord to realize your
[55:14] heart and to realize how important it is
[55:16] Lord that you're in fellowship with your
[55:19] children Lord this is your great mystery
[55:22] being expressed in this day and when
[55:25] families come into into their blessed
[55:27] place it's just such an expression of
[55:30] what you've done in the family of God
[55:33] lord may we come closer to you through
[55:35] what you've expressed here tonight and
[55:37] we just pray that you'll bless the
[55:39] families of the Assembly of literal life
[55:42] Satan on the Rampage just even trying so
[55:45] hard to knock down the door as in the
[55:48] days of Sodom when they were just
[55:49] knocking at the door pressing at the
[55:51] door trying to get in spirits of Sodom
[55:54] and Lord all the time feeling pressure
[55:55] on my family and different influences
[55:57] that try to get in and also tensions
[55:59] getting between us and we try to work
[56:01] them out and pray and reconcile but Lord
[56:05] then the next day or the next few days
[56:07] then the Satan tries to come in again
[56:09] it's a constant battle to stay in unity
[56:12] together Lord I've tried as a family to
[56:14] keep working at it and just keep praying
[56:17] and keep saying we're we're going to
[56:18] stand as a family Lord it'll be by your
[56:21] grace that we make it through but bless
[56:23] the families here in the church Lord
[56:26] father I just pray that you'll restore
[56:30] Lord I remember that scripture when you
[56:32] restored in the Jubilee year you not
