[0:00] chapter 3
[0:10] we have read in the series on
[0:12] relationships we've read up into
[0:15] verse 13 when they begin to give their
[0:18] excuses and their different things of
[0:19] what took place in the fall with the
[0:21] serpent now let's pick up the curses
[0:23] here in verse 14. genesis chapter 3 and
[0:26] verse 14 and the lord god said unto the
[0:29] serpent because thou hast done this thou
[0:31] art cursed above all cattle and above
[0:34] every beast of the field upon thy belly
[0:36] shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat
[0:39] all the days of thy life
[0:41] and i will put enmity between thee and
[0:44] the woman
[0:45] and between thy seed and her seed it
[0:49] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[0:52] bruise his heel i want to read that part
[0:54] again because it's a very interesting
[0:57] one scripture in between all the curses
[0:59] of god in between the judgment of god
[1:02] because whenever there's sin there has
[1:03] to be judgment so as he's handing out
[1:06] the judgment in the middle of all this
[1:08] is a prophecy of redemption and it says
[1:11] i will put any enmity between
[1:13] the thee and the woman between thy seed
[1:15] and her sin it shall bruise there's a
[1:17] prophecy it shall bruise thy head and
[1:19] speak into the serpent and thou shalt
[1:21] bruise his heel
[1:22] unto the woman he said said i will
[1:24] greatly multiply thy sorrow and in thy
[1:27] conception and sorrow thou shalt bring
[1:28] four children and thy desire shall be to
[1:31] thy husband and he shall rule over thee
[1:34] and unto adam he said because thou art
[1:35] hearken unto the voice of thy wife and
[1:38] hast eaten of the tree of which i've
[1:39] commanded thee saying thou shall not eat
[1:41] of it and
[1:42] cursed is the ground for thy sake in
[1:45] sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days
[1:47] of thy life
[1:48] thorns also and thistle shall it bring
[1:51] forth to thee
[1:52] and thou shalt eat the herb of the field
[1:55] in the sweat of thy face
[1:57] shalt thou eat bread till thou return
[2:00] unto the ground
[2:01] for out of it was thou taken for dust
[2:04] thou art and unto dust shalt thou return
[2:08] and let's just stop there heavenly
[2:10] father we ask you to bless and anoint
[2:12] your word today
[2:13] it is has a blessing with it even when
[2:16] it's red
[2:17] if we'll receive it
[2:19] lord we sense your awesome presence here
[2:22] with us this morning
[2:23] and lord if you could take up this word
[2:25] that you've already spoken
[2:27] and use this weak vessel of me lord as a
[2:30] channel that you can bring revelation
[2:32] and understanding and encouragement
[2:35] and lord maybe some rebuke i don't know
[2:37] but father if you could bring it through
[2:39] the right channel of divine love then
[2:41] we'll know that you love us lord and
[2:43] that we would receive it in our hearts
[2:45] we pray lord that you will break down
[2:47] every hindrance and hurdle in our lives
[2:50] that keep us back from our full victory
[2:53] for as the song says you have already
[2:56] given us the victory we thank you for
[2:59] that lord and we commit ourselves to you
[3:01] now and all the events coming up and all
[3:03] these things and i just might say to you
[3:06] my father that we don't do this
[3:09] uh commercial and these things for any
[3:11] other reason except for to pray over it
[3:14] and say lord
[3:15] if there be any soul that's hungry for
[3:18] more truth
[3:19] then i pray that you'll grab their
[3:21] attention lord and put them in touch
[3:23] with with one of us or the assembly or
[3:26] someone that would could lead them
[3:28] closer to christ whether they be in
[3:30] church all their life or whether they be
[3:32] in the the worst hellhole of toledo get
[3:35] their attention lord and draw them to
[3:38] yourself i'm calling for more souls to
[3:41] come lord and i pray that you'll grant
[3:43] it in jesus precious name amen
[3:46] god bless you may be seated i know
[3:48] you're in agreement with me on that i'm
[3:50] blessed with such a congregation that is
[3:52] so outraged minded and for most of you
[3:55] it's not about us foreign no more but
[3:57] it's about giving what we have uh he
[4:00] that has a lot is
[4:02] as
[4:03] jesus said there to to whom much is
[4:06] given much is required and how many
[4:09] would raise your hand and says much has
[4:11] been given to you
[4:13] to whom much is given much is required
[4:16] amen god bless you all brother paul it's
[4:18] good to have you back from vacation
[4:20] there and jared and betsy as well it's
[4:22] good to have you mr elisha
[4:24] amen
[4:25] in the last few services we
[4:27] showed the fall in the garden
[4:29] and the oneness that was broke with god
[4:32] and then the oneness that was broke with
[4:35] one another
[4:36] and we know that all the relationships
[4:39] were destroyed
[4:41] from their relationship with god and all
[4:43] the way down to the home
[4:46] and
[4:47] so we have elaborate on that but in this
[4:49] service we want to take a bit of a turn
[4:51] we want to take a transition and we want
[4:54] to move from talking about the the
[4:57] results of the fall and what took place
[5:00] and begin to look at what god would do
[5:03] and how he would do it to reverse all of
[5:05] this to change all of this
[5:07] and to to redeem his sons out of this
[5:12] mess that we
[5:13] uh got ourselves in or adam and eve got
[5:16] us in so how would god reverse it it's
[5:18] very important that we know that it's
[5:20] very important that we know how god's
[5:22] redemption takes place it's important
[5:24] that we know it's the power of it how
[5:26] powerful it is because it had to be
[5:28] pretty powerful to deliver us from the
[5:30] state that we're in
[5:32] but it's very important we know how god
[5:34] chose and the reason is is because
[5:36] man can always come up with ideas to try
[5:39] to redeem himself out of this state that
[5:41] he's in
[5:42] and because of that we want to make
[5:44] crystal clear
[5:45] god's way of redemption god's chosen way
[5:48] of redemption because that's the only
[5:51] way that we can get back to god
[5:54] god's way of redemption is the only way
[5:56] back
[5:57] men can try different ways they can give
[5:59] they can
[6:01] give themselves to public service they
[6:03] can live their whole life in public
[6:04] service but if they have the guilt and
[6:07] of sin on their soul then god has a way
[6:09] to take care of that and release it and
[6:11] forgive them they can't take care of
[6:14] that on their own there are certain
[6:15] problems that we have that we cannot
[6:18] take care of on our own we are helpless
[6:21] and if only god can do it
[6:24] does everybody know that i know that's a
[6:26] simple statement but we have to know
[6:27] that first there are certain problems
[6:29] that we have and one big problem that we
[6:31] have that only god alone could take care
[6:34] of it there is no psychology there is no
[6:36] schooling there is no self-help there's
[6:39] nothing there's one main problem in our
[6:41] life and only god could take care of
[6:43] that problem you are helpless and you're
[6:45] down in the miry clay with that problem
[6:47] and no one can pick you up none of us
[6:49] can pick you up the way only god could
[6:51] grab your hand and get you out of this
[6:53] state that you're in
[6:55] and when the fall took place then god
[6:57] began to begin to lay out his plan
[7:01] of redemption
[7:02] and as you know god allowed in the
[7:05] greater mystery of it all god allowed
[7:07] this to happen god didn't create this
[7:10] but god allowed this fall to take place
[7:13] in order for his bigger plan of
[7:15] redemption to unfold and that his
[7:18] attributes would be displayed because
[7:21] some of god
[7:22] cannot be expressed in perfection
[7:26] when we think of god we think of
[7:28] perfection but some of the attributes of
[7:31] god cannot be expressed and come out
[7:33] unless there's an imperfection unless
[7:35] there's a fall unless there's a mistake
[7:38] unless there's someone who's fallen and
[7:40] can't get up can you say matt there are
[7:42] some attributes of of god and
[7:44] particularly the the entire work of
[7:47] redemption could not be expressed until
[7:50] man had fallen so there's a certain part
[7:52] of this that he allowed to take place so
[7:55] that more of his attributes could be
[7:57] expressed can you say amen so so now
[8:00] some of god could not be expressed so
[8:01] now we see then that man was in a place
[8:05] who uh that he could never pull himself
[8:07] out of he could not help himself
[8:10] it's it's like the song says when
[8:12] nothing else could help love lifted me i
[8:16] love that lyric when nothing else could
[8:18] help you you get in states there's
[8:20] nothing else that can help you except
[8:22] god accept his love
[8:24] and it's very important we know that in
[8:26] this proud generation because we have so
[8:28] many things to fix things we have so
[8:30] many we have access to so much that can
[8:32] fix things and we try to fix everything
[8:35] but we need to be humble and realize
[8:37] there's certain things that you cannot
[8:38] fix there's certain things in life and
[8:41] actually the more things you turn over
[8:43] to god he'll fix it the right way
[8:47] but we have to humbly admit there's
[8:49] certain things i can't do it lord i
[8:51] don't want to offer any help to it i
[8:53] don't want after any assistance i can't
[8:54] do it if it's going to get done i yield
[8:56] to do you because there are certain
[8:58] problems that only god can take care of
[9:03] that's humility can you say amen
[9:05] i was sinking deep in sin so far from
[9:08] the shore all these lyrics i was sinking
[9:10] and it was this this this depth of sin
[9:14] from the garden it was so lodged in the
[9:17] spirit of man in other words this fall
[9:20] was just not a mistake this was not just
[9:23] a mistake this was huge
[9:27] to where this sin
[9:29] lodged in man's spirit can you say man
[9:33] so that he didn't just have problems
[9:35] because we read the problems of
[9:37] relationship that come from the fall he
[9:39] had problems and man had problems ever
[9:41] since the fall there's always been
[9:42] problems he's saying to adam there under
[9:45] adam's curse he'd curse the ground he
[9:47] couldn't curse adam because he was the
[9:48] son of god so he cursed the ground so
[9:49] you're going to work by the sweat of
[9:51] your brow
[9:52] you're you're going to have thorns and
[9:54] thistles grow up in your garden
[9:56] you're going to pull crabgrass
[9:59] hello anybody who is here wednesday
[10:01] night
[10:02] yeah that's under the curse and there it
[10:04] is and we're still dealing with that
[10:05] crab grass we're still dealing with the
[10:07] thorns can you say man so he's dishing
[10:09] out all these things and he's giving it
[10:11] what was adam but so adam had problems
[10:15] because of the fall adam had to work by
[10:17] the sweat of his brow because of the
[10:19] fall we're still dealing with a lot but
[10:21] i want to just say i'm not talking about
[10:23] today so much the problems as i'm
[10:25] talking about the problem
[10:28] singular
[10:30] because there was one problem with adam
[10:32] and everyone after him that was so deep
[10:35] and so ingrained in his nature there
[10:38] wasn't anything that he could do to fix
[10:41] it
[10:42] it was so deep it was so ingrained it
[10:46] went right into his spirit right into
[10:49] his nature and only god and let me say
[10:52] this only god knew the depth of the fall
[10:55] in the garden only god know how knew how
[10:57] deep it was
[10:59] i don't believe adam knew how deep it
[11:00] was i don't believe eve knew cain
[11:02] certainly didn't know and everywhere
[11:04] from there they didn't realize the depth
[11:06] of what took place it wasn't just a
[11:09] mistake that satan himself came and
[11:12] injected himself into the human race
[11:15] lodged his own nature in the spirit and
[11:17] the soul of man
[11:20] that's pretty deep
[11:22] and guess what you can't you can't take
[11:24] care of that
[11:25] you were born with it and here it was so
[11:29] deep that only god knew how deep it was
[11:32] and it wasn't time yet to redeem them so
[11:35] god put things in place himself for the
[11:39] next two thousand three thousand years
[11:42] god put things in place to help man
[11:46] and man
[11:47] man that was grateful for god they were
[11:50] thankful for the blood sacrifice they
[11:52] were thankful for the commandments they
[11:54] were they should have been they were
[11:56] thankful for the all the dietary laws
[11:58] that moses brought all these laws you
[12:00] know what god's doing he's saying i love
[12:02] my people and until i deal with the
[12:05] problem
[12:08] until i deal with the the depth of the
[12:10] problem within man i'm gonna give them
[12:13] some help that they stay on course and
[12:15] if they'll serve me if they'll reach
[12:17] towards me if they'll cry out to me i'll
[12:19] help them a long way because it's not
[12:21] time for me to deal with the problem yet
[12:23] but i'll help them deal with their
[12:25] problems if they'll live by my
[12:27] principles if they'll live by the my
[12:28] commandments thou shall not commit
[12:30] adultery thou shall not kill thou shalt
[12:32] not steal i'm going to give them things
[12:34] and if they don't live by that it's
[12:36] going to be chaos so i'll give them
[12:38] something and i'll give them a blood
[12:39] sacrifice actually that if they'll come
[12:42] and the priest will come and a lamb is
[12:44] killed in their place i'll accept that
[12:46] for now but there's one problem is that
[12:49] you can't deal with the nature of sin
[12:51] with the spirit of an animal you can't
[12:53] do it with the blood of an animal you
[12:55] can only push off push off the sin
[12:58] you can't deal with the guilt of sin you
[13:00] can't deal with the nature of sin but
[13:02] god said i'll give you a blood sacrifice
[13:04] i'll accept that for now but guess what
[13:07] someday i'm going to deal with the
[13:09] problem my own way
[13:16] i'm fixing to have a good time today
[13:20] only god knew the depth of the fall i
[13:22] don't even think i'm sometimes i wonder
[13:25] when people don't cry out for the holy
[13:27] ghost in their lives
[13:29] and really get a deep experience with
[13:32] god maybe they don't understand
[13:34] how deep the serpent nature is rooted
[13:37] within us
[13:39] because if they really understood you
[13:41] know we're always looking for the good
[13:42] things we do we're always looking to pat
[13:44] ourselves in the back but but man in his
[13:46] nature when he's born there's a problem
[13:48] can you say amen and you can be good and
[13:50] you can give and you can help people and
[13:52] you can be a a a decent person in
[13:55] society and my kids are good people
[13:57] praise the lord i'd rather have good
[13:59] people on the earth than bad people i
[14:00] love that but that doesn't deal with the
[14:02] problem the problem goes deeper in our
[14:05] nature
[14:06] and only god can deal with that problem
[14:10] it goes deep within us and that's why
[14:12] people don't seek the holy ghost because
[14:14] they don't understand how deeply we have
[14:16] something rooted within us how deep it
[14:18] goes in the desire for sin
[14:21] it's in bread
[14:23] in our very nature
[14:26] come on folks say amen
[14:29] so only god could do it so i want to say
[14:31] let me say about problems you can have a
[14:33] lot of problems but you have one big one
[14:36] that yourself yourself you can't do
[14:38] anything about
[14:40] so yeah i know if you ever look at it
[14:41] that way but you have problems how many
[14:44] raise your hands i got problems in life
[14:46] all right about 40 of us
[14:48] what's the rest of you doing i want to
[14:49] know
[14:51] i got problems
[14:53] but your problems are really not as bad
[14:56] as the problem
[15:01] there's nothing worse than
[15:03] the problem
[15:06] but we glorify our problems
[15:08] we glorify our hurts and our pains and
[15:10] our losses and our and getting fired and
[15:12] all that and we got problems problems
[15:14] problems problems but you need to know
[15:16] there's one problem that that trumps all
[15:19] problems
[15:20] and that's the nature that we're born
[15:22] with
[15:24] and if we go our whole lives
[15:27] and deal with our problems even with the
[15:29] lord but ignore the problem
[15:34] then we're missing something what's what
[15:36] does it profit a man to gain the whole
[15:38] world and lose his soul
[15:41] if we can ignore the one problem so i
[15:43] got i struggle in this and i do this and
[15:45] i i put this on and i wear this on my
[15:47] ears and i do this and i struggle with
[15:50] this and okay okay but you see now see
[15:53] that's all that's all just uh that's
[15:55] symptoms
[15:58] let's not talk about the symptoms
[16:00] i mean i could lay it down the line and
[16:02] show you the the dress code that comes
[16:04] right from the bible for you sisters and
[16:06] brothers sometimes i do it but i could
[16:08] lay it out just as crystal clear some of
[16:10] you still wouldn't follow it but i could
[16:12] lay it out and you could line up with it
[16:15] and i would appreciate that praise the
[16:16] lord but listen that doesn't deal with a
[16:19] deeper problem
[16:23] and i as i read that quote wednesday
[16:25] night and i was talking about crab grass
[16:27] the last quote i don't know if you
[16:28] caught it brother bram said it was he he
[16:30] was in the prayer line and there was
[16:31] this growth on this woman and he prayed
[16:33] for her and he cursed the life of it she
[16:35] went home she got worse because it
[16:37] swelled up he said i don't deal with the
[16:40] growth
[16:41] i deal with the life of the growth
[16:44] and i thought praise be to god that's my
[16:46] lord he doesn't just deal with the
[16:49] symptoms he doesn't just deal with the
[16:51] growth of cancer can you say man he
[16:54] strikes with the power in the name of
[16:55] jesus christ and he strikes that very
[16:58] life when sister kathy laid our head her
[17:00] hands on that child can you say man she
[17:03] was tapping into something than just
[17:05] dealing with the growth or the disease
[17:07] or whatever it is whatever it was she
[17:09] was tapping in the name of jesus christ
[17:11] and in a moment's time she laid hands on
[17:13] that child and it was healed
[17:17] i'm so glad to serve of god that strikes
[17:19] at the life
[17:21] at the root of crabgrass
[17:25] amen
[17:27] so
[17:29] you know
[17:30] uh
[17:33] it's pretty exciting now to read our
[17:35] text because
[17:37] right in the middle of the curses
[17:40] right in the middle of the curses
[17:42] and the judgments being handed out
[17:45] there's a strong
[17:47] bold
[17:48] proclamation
[17:50] from our god
[17:51] of redemption
[17:53] already this is the first little section
[17:55] of scripture that prophesies of
[17:57] redemption and he does it right in the
[17:59] middle of the curses being handed out
[18:02] i love that
[18:04] there's a strong bold statement guess
[18:06] who he's speaking it to he's speaking it
[18:08] to the serpent
[18:10] he's saying something to the serpent i
[18:12] see what you've done i've observed what
[18:15] you've done i know this goes deeper than
[18:17] man can ever help himself and now i have
[18:20] to lay out curses on you on adam and on
[18:23] eve i have to because god's a god of
[18:26] justice there has to be a payment can
[18:28] you say man there has to be something
[18:30] take place to to
[18:32] when we make when even we make a mistake
[18:35] there has if you're in god's world there
[18:37] has to be some type of punishment for
[18:40] there has to be a response about it you
[18:42] don't just get off scot-free when you
[18:43] make a mistake
[18:46] come on people listen these are simple
[18:47] things i'm
[18:49] if you do something sin has to have a
[18:52] response sin has to be taken care of
[18:55] you're going to own up to it you don't
[18:56] get off scot-free if you do something
[18:58] privately
[18:59] with yourself and you think nobody sees
[19:01] you there'll be a there'll be something
[19:03] that'll come as the fruit that comes
[19:05] from that
[19:06] because that's the way life works can
[19:08] you say that's the way god's kingdom
[19:09] work is works as well but in the middle
[19:11] of the curses in the middle of the
[19:13] judgments being handed out there's a
[19:15] strong proclamation from god
[19:18] that goes directly to the serpent in the
[19:21] middle of justice is mercy being
[19:24] predicted in the middle of justice mercy
[19:27] is being prophesied he's speaking to the
[19:29] servant and he's saying to the serpent i
[19:32] see what's taken place i'm paraphrasing
[19:34] now i see what's going on and i'm going
[19:37] to deal with this someday i'm going to
[19:39] deal with it in such a deep way i'm
[19:42] going to save my sons and daughters from
[19:44] this they can't even save themselves can
[19:46] you say amen
[19:48] let me say it this way let me paraphrase
[19:49] this way satan sir the serpent your
[19:52] offstring your offspring and by the way
[19:55] i just want to bring it up to anybody
[19:57] who's listening he said he spoke of the
[19:59] serpent's seed so this the serpent had a
[20:02] seed
[20:03] the serpent had an offspring
[20:07] so something happened
[20:09] and the serpent had an offspring and in
[20:13] the middle he speaks the serpent and
[20:14] simon here he says satan the serpent
[20:17] your offspring
[20:19] and her seed will be at odds for many
[20:23] thousands of years there will be an
[20:25] enmity with one another but one day to
[20:28] the serpent one day you will bruise his
[20:31] heel her seed you'll bruise his heel but
[20:34] i will bruise i will bruise he christ
[20:38] will bruise your head
[20:43] why aren't you why aren't we rejoicing
[20:45] in the middle of the curse in the middle
[20:48] of the judgments of god being handed out
[20:51] god puts in mercy for his sons and
[20:53] daughters
[20:55] it's not all cursed it's not a job and
[20:56] they're going to come underneath it and
[20:58] it's going to happen it's going to
[20:59] happen for thousands of years but god
[21:00] just laced in there puts in there but
[21:02] say serpent satan i say satan because he
[21:05] cursed the serpent to the ground became
[21:07] a snake but he's still speaking to this
[21:09] to satan and he said i want to let you
[21:11] know
[21:12] i see the problem
[21:14] they don't even see it i see the fall i
[21:16] see what's done it goes deep but i want
[21:18] to let you know i'm going to deal with
[21:19] some with it someday and say i'm going
[21:22] to deal with you
[21:24] and i'm going to do it my own way and
[21:26] when i do it it's going to be permanent
[21:29] you're going to have to chance you're
[21:31] going to have a chance to bruise this
[21:33] seed christ because that's the seed of
[21:35] the woman christ you're going to have a
[21:37] chance to to bruise his heel but i'm
[21:40] going to have a chance through christ
[21:42] and he's going to bruise your head now
[21:43] in the amplified it says it says strike
[21:46] the heel and crush the head so you're
[21:49] going to have a chance to strike at this
[21:51] christ at calvary but christ is going to
[21:54] crush your head
[21:57] come on somebody somebody praise the
[21:59] lord
[22:01] this is redemption already speaking
[22:03] under the judgments and he's letting
[22:05] your devil know you're the one who
[22:07] fights you at the very beginning i love
[22:10] my sons and daughters i'm gonna deal
[22:12] with this and when i deal with it i'm
[22:13] gonna crush your head
[22:16] what do you do with a snake if you're
[22:18] talking about a snake what do you do to
[22:19] get rhythm rid of him well if he's still
[22:21] alive he can strike at your heel he can
[22:23] strike at you he can even strike at your
[22:25] heel can you say that but the way to get
[22:27] rid of a snake is put your head on him
[22:30] put your foot on his head and i killed
[22:32] one the other day in our yard and the
[22:34] only way to get rid of him for me
[22:35] because i hate snakes i hate crabgrass
[22:37] and i hate snakes
[22:38] the only way to deal with that snake is
[22:41] to get him by the head and get something
[22:43] i got something and i chopped his head
[22:45] off because then he's finished for good
[22:48] he might wiggle around a little bit but
[22:50] then he he's just finished he's because
[22:51] his head is gone and god says god says
[22:54] you may strike at the heel even of my
[22:57] people you'll strike at the heel of this
[22:59] seat at calvary but i will crush your
[23:03] head through christ
[23:08] is god saying he's going to deal with it
[23:09] yeah he's going to deal with it
[23:12] and by the way we're post calvary now so
[23:14] he's already dealt with it at calvary
[23:16] he's already crushed the head of the
[23:17] serpent all he can do is is bluff with
[23:21] you all he can do is threaten you all he
[23:24] can do is bully you he has no power over
[23:27] what god said that you are he has no
[23:29] power this morning he's a bluff can you
[23:31] say man he he he is a he as my dad used
[23:35] to say he got his teeth taken out of
[23:37] calvary
[23:39] and all he can do is gum you to death
[23:47] your seed
[23:49] is gonna and that was a religious system
[23:51] by the way they're gonna strike at
[23:52] christ at calvary
[23:55] but my seed the woman's seed christ is
[23:58] gonna crush your head
[24:02] i'm gonna deal with this and i'm going
[24:03] to deal with it
[24:05] in a permanent way for my people
[24:08] i want you to notice now when he comes
[24:11] into his power redemption
[24:13] and you're already responding saying my
[24:15] my my my this is powerful this isn't
[24:18] just a band-aid on the problem he's
[24:21] going to deal with the problem of sin
[24:24] and he is going to make it so permanent
[24:27] his sons and daughters look at them
[24:29] they're hiding they're scared they're
[24:31] walking with their tail between the legs
[24:33] adam and eve hiding in the bushes
[24:35] bullied by the enemy
[24:37] speaking in shame speaking in guilt come
[24:40] on read your bible there they are hiding
[24:43] guilt shame and they're scared and
[24:45] they're and they're they're blaming one
[24:46] another and they're trying to dish it
[24:48] off and they're doing they're all out of
[24:50] sorts their minds are just gone here and
[24:52] they're walking with their tail between
[24:53] the legs scared and bullied by the enemy
[24:55] but i want to say that's not with god
[24:58] he's not scared he's not bullied by the
[25:00] enemy can you say man he says i know my
[25:03] son and daughter have failed but i'm
[25:05] making something crystal clear to you
[25:07] serpent i will deal with this and then i
[25:09] will deal with you
[25:14] praise the lord
[25:17] so right there he proclaimed that my
[25:18] people will come to the powerful work of
[25:20] my redemption there's nothing satan can
[25:23] ever do it begins
[25:25] the prophecies of redemption dealing
[25:28] with his people all the way till we come
[25:30] to the the birth of christ
[25:32] and that seed and we'll get to that in
[25:34] just a minute the powerful work of
[25:37] redemption he wasn't just going to put a
[25:39] band-aid on your problem
[25:44] this goes deeper than just putting a
[25:45] band-aid on
[25:47] your serpent nature that you're born
[25:48] with goes deeper than just you know i
[25:50] can fix this i can fix this you ever see
[25:52] it i can fix this leave it alone don't
[25:54] worry about it i can fix this we can fix
[25:56] everything you can't fix that nature
[25:58] that you're born with
[26:00] but god says
[26:01] i'm not only going to fix it i'm going
[26:04] to crush his head
[26:07] i'm going to kill that nature within an
[26:09] individual
[26:11] and last week at the camps we pray that
[26:13] young people get something real out of
[26:15] all that there'll be some that get
[26:16] something real like i got at 16 years
[26:18] old and satan crushed satan crushed
[26:22] the head that was sitting in my control
[26:24] tower at 16 years old he was sitting at
[26:27] the control tower of my desires and i
[26:29] can tell you god come one night and
[26:31] crushed his head
[26:33] he did it at calvary but then he did it
[26:35] for me
[26:36] he crushed his head in my life and i no
[26:39] longer desired from a soul level desired
[26:41] the things of the world i'm finished how
[26:43] can that happen at 16 years old what a
[26:45] miracle at 16 years old that the things
[26:47] of the world has grown strangely dim and
[26:50] i loved god i loved his word i loved his
[26:52] people god now how can i begin to serve
[26:54] you how can i serve his people how can i
[26:56] get closer to you how does that happen
[26:58] at 16 years old i can tell you only by
[27:01] god's uh conversion of the holy spirit
[27:04] going to a deep deep level in my life i
[27:07] didn't realize how deep it was but it
[27:08] was deep my friends it changed me
[27:13] and then i begin the journey of the
[27:15] flesh
[27:16] wanting to still do things
[27:18] and the soul saying
[27:20] nope
[27:22] the desire has been crushed
[27:25] somebody say praise the lord this
[27:26] morning
[27:28] so today i want to get specific about
[27:30] the powerful work of redemption and how
[27:31] deep it goes
[27:33] you know it's often that bible terms get
[27:35] used through the years and they lose
[27:37] their meaning i think redemption has
[27:39] lost its meaning a little bit
[27:43] we have to know how powerful god has
[27:46] provided a way of redemption for you
[27:49] we have to know how powerful it is
[27:50] there's words in the world that get me
[27:52] they lose their meaning with the words
[27:54] in the scripture that lose their meaning
[27:55] how about the word love in the world
[27:58] would you say that's lost this meeting
[28:00] i'd say so perverted homosexuals
[28:03] lesbians i love you i love you i love
[28:05] you and then loosely saying i love you
[28:07] satan has perverted the word love they
[28:08] don't even know what love is anymore uh
[28:11] the the word uh the word modesty the
[28:13] word modesty has
[28:15] has been watered down in its meaning
[28:21] praise the lord
[28:22] why do i have to why do i have to do
[28:24] this
[28:29] i i i asked that question
[28:31] why do people come to my church
[28:36] when i tell them so straight the truth
[28:42] modesty has lost its meaning
[28:44] masculinity it's lost its meaning
[28:47] femininity and i can go on and on but
[28:48] redemption redemption has lost its it's
[28:51] been watered down
[28:52] and somebody now is redeemed because
[28:54] they come and shake the preacher's hand
[28:56] or they come to a church and they enjoy
[28:57] the youth group and now well i've been
[28:59] redeemed no no no no no redemption is a
[29:02] process and redemption god handles it
[29:04] and it's a deep deep work that takes
[29:07] place in you it's it's a long lasting
[29:09] work can you say man and by the way it
[29:12] had a sacrifice with it because you
[29:13] don't have the redemption of this deep
[29:15] problem without a huge sacrifice and
[29:17] guess what you didn't have to make that
[29:19] yourself christ made it for you
[29:24] and so
[29:25] i've been thinking about the the causes
[29:27] of the fall and besides just the normal
[29:29] things that we've been taught in the
[29:30] message
[29:31] we've been taught that eve we know the
[29:33] cause of the fall eve disbelieved the
[29:35] word eve reasoned with the serpent and
[29:37] she left the word she was off on just
[29:39] one percent of it 99 of what was true as
[29:42] one percent lie and she believed the lie
[29:44] part she actually reasoned with the
[29:45] serpent and that's how we know that's
[29:47] how the fall took place when you get
[29:49] away from the word then then it it
[29:51] becomes chaos that's what happened in
[29:53] the garden and then we have all this
[29:55] trouble today even six thousand years
[29:58] later because eve left the word every
[30:02] hospital every prison do you realize it
[30:04] was one word that eve doubted listen to
[30:06] this now it was one word that eve
[30:09] doubted and that caused all the trouble
[30:12] one spoken of word of god eve doubted to
[30:14] be the truth and it caused every
[30:16] sickness
[30:17] every disease
[30:19] every suffering baby every ambulance
[30:22] that you hear
[30:23] every hospital to be built every
[30:25] operation that was ever performed every
[30:28] death that ever died for one person came
[30:31] from one person disbelieving the word of
[30:34] god
[30:36] from cancer to covet
[30:40] from adultery to pornography to
[30:43] homosexuality
[30:44] so many things we have in our broken
[30:47] world but it all came when eve
[30:50] disbelieved the word of god
[30:54] these are all the problems
[30:57] but the greatest thing that i've been
[30:58] thinking about as the greatest problem
[31:00] that came from the paul fall is that
[31:02] every man was born with the nature of
[31:06] sin
[31:08] it's the deepest problem
[31:10] and i've been i was pondering how all
[31:12] that took place
[31:15] and i don't have all the answers yet but
[31:17] i can i can summarize what i've learned
[31:19] so far and that is satan
[31:21] stood back
[31:22] and said
[31:24] how can i inject myself
[31:27] into the human race because you remember
[31:29] he wanted to be worshiped like god this
[31:31] was god's creation adam and then eve
[31:33] this was god's creation so he wanted to
[31:35] be worshiped like god in the beginning
[31:37] as lucifer so his question is how do i
[31:40] inject myself into the human race
[31:43] because that's the only way it's got to
[31:45] be a blending of natures i've got to get
[31:47] me i've got to get my reasoning i've got
[31:49] to get in order to be worshiped i've got
[31:51] to inject myself into the human race so
[31:55] i've been pondering that how how did he
[31:57] do that and he stands back and he says
[31:59] well i've got to inject myself he stood
[32:02] back and said he said i don't want to
[32:03] just get them to sin
[32:05] i don't want to just anoint them to sin
[32:08] in the way of just speaking in their
[32:09] mind saying go do this i actually want
[32:12] to sit on the control tower of their
[32:14] desires
[32:17] i want to be blended in with their
[32:19] nature
[32:21] and you forgive me if i'm not saying
[32:22] this perfectly right this is my
[32:24] crude way of saying it that's the best
[32:26] way i understand it
[32:27] satan could not create only god is a
[32:30] creator satan can only pervert what god
[32:32] has created
[32:34] so he couldn't if he could create then
[32:36] he could just create a seed in in eve of
[32:40] himself right because that's what god
[32:42] did he created his own seed
[32:44] in mary
[32:46] because he was a creator
[32:48] to reverse this thing but satan couldn't
[32:50] do that so he had to inject himself
[32:53] another way into uh humanity and he's he
[32:57] wanted to blend his nature he couldn't
[32:58] create so if he could then he would
[33:00] create a seed like in eve so he took
[33:03] over this beast of the serpent that was
[33:05] in the garden this beast that was very
[33:08] unique this one called the serpent he
[33:09] wasn't a snake then he stood upright he
[33:12] could talk to eve he could reason with
[33:14] eve so he was a different bird a
[33:16] different bird he was a different animal
[33:18] in the garden okay and he was stood
[33:21] upright he could speak and all these
[33:22] other things so he's got a strange
[33:25] thing there in the garden with all the
[33:27] animals he was animal and he didn't have
[33:29] a soul but he had a place for a soul and
[33:31] he was so close
[33:33] uh but but you see now all the animals
[33:36] couldn't reproduce with man
[33:38] all the animals couldn't reduce
[33:39] reproduce with man but this this had a
[33:42] seed that could come and come in and and
[33:45] reproduce itself so this vessel of the
[33:48] serpent is the one satan said i will
[33:50] anoint i will come upon i will use i
[33:53] will speak through him
[33:55] because the beast could mingle with this
[33:58] woman
[33:59] and
[34:00] it would be a beast that would be
[34:01] attractive and attract eve as well now i
[34:03] can go into a lot of details but if you
[34:05] study your bible and study what's
[34:07] happened since the fall you'll find
[34:09] these things to be true
[34:10] if it was a fruit that they ate that
[34:13] made them feel like that they were naked
[34:16] then let's start passing out the fruit
[34:18] because we have a lot of naked people in
[34:19] this world
[34:21] it wasn't a fruit that made them realize
[34:22] they were naked
[34:25] it was sin in the garden
[34:28] so somehow i'm summarizing now
[34:31] you got your seatbelts on
[34:34] somehow adam and eve and the serpent
[34:36] there's this mingling and mixing of the
[34:38] seed through relations
[34:41] and man fell by that
[34:44] and when he did he not only fell but was
[34:46] injected
[34:47] with a nature
[34:49] for sin
[34:52] he may try to deal with his problems he
[34:54] may try to make things better he should
[34:56] do all he can but that problem went so
[34:58] deep he can never change it himself
[35:01] because satan said i've injected myself
[35:05] into
[35:06] through these relations and through this
[35:07] thing through reasoning of the word but
[35:09] also not just reasoning of the word
[35:11] actually the blending and the bringing
[35:13] in of the nature that every man was born
[35:16] in sin shape and iniquity come into the
[35:18] world speaking lies from that point
[35:20] that's a pretty deep problem that you
[35:21] can't even have a baby that's not born
[35:23] in sin
[35:25] we would love to have perfect children
[35:26] and i know some people when they have
[35:28] babies think their children are perfect
[35:32] but none of them are perfect they're
[35:33] flawed
[35:35] and you can have grace for them because
[35:37] you were born flawed
[35:39] you weren't born perfect
[35:41] so can you imagine how deep this problem
[35:43] goes is that
[35:45] um
[35:46] we could safely say that we're a born
[35:48] loser because
[35:50] we
[35:52] you know i'm going to turn this around
[35:53] to positive in a minute and it can't get
[35:55] but positive when you talk about calvary
[35:58] but all of us no matter how rich a
[36:00] family we were born in no matter of
[36:02] message family no matter if our dad was
[36:05] a preacher no matter if our dad was a
[36:07] deacon no matter how good where we're at
[36:09] now
[36:10] all of that we have to admit we're all
[36:12] born with the same nature and god had to
[36:15] deal with it
[36:17] and some may go way into sin and some
[36:19] may do little private sins but guess
[36:22] what we're all guilty
[36:24] we're all born with something we can't
[36:26] help
[36:29] all your best men that you look out in
[36:31] the face of the earth and that's why
[36:34] all the best men
[36:36] all the most perfect people you can
[36:37] think of still we can't help one another
[36:39] out of this pit
[36:41] because we're all born with the same
[36:42] nature
[36:43] they looked in revelations 5 who's
[36:45] worthy to take the book who's worthy to
[36:47] deal with this problem if somebody
[36:48] doesn't take this book of redemption all
[36:50] creation is lost they looked through the
[36:51] whole earth and couldn't find anybody
[36:53] worthy of the best people even even all
[36:55] the good people in the old testament and
[36:57] the patriarchs we look up to none of
[36:59] them was worthy why because they were
[37:01] born just like us somebody that's born
[37:03] like you can't help you
[37:08] we cling to people we cling to family
[37:09] relationship and it's fine we clean and
[37:12] we become co-dependent on other people
[37:14] they can help me they behave and we lean
[37:16] on it too much what we need to do is
[37:18] lean on the lord we stand alone with the
[37:20] lord and say lord you deal with me
[37:22] internally let me not depend on someone
[37:24] else because no one can pull us out of
[37:26] the pit of this myriad clay except the
[37:29] hand of jesus christ grabbing our hand
[37:31] and pulling us out
[37:33] so we'd like to all be born perfect and
[37:34] have our children going perfect but it
[37:36] didn't happen and so from that point on
[37:38] here every man even able even and that's
[37:42] what i've been studying abel abel gets
[37:44] killed by cain seth enos then men begin
[37:47] to call upon the name of the lord said
[37:48] well he began to call upon the name of
[37:50] the lord he's righteous he's good
[37:51] there's a certain righteousness there
[37:52] but i'm going to tell you enos even when
[37:54] he called upon the name of the lord
[37:56] still had the problem
[38:00] the problem wasn't dealt with
[38:02] the problem
[38:04] has to be dealt with
[38:08] so besides man trying to deal with
[38:10] things god gives aids
[38:12] god gives helps
[38:14] god knew he would deal with it in time
[38:16] he had a blood sacrifice he gave
[38:17] commandments he spoke to the prophets to
[38:19] give leadership
[38:21] and then with all the blood sacrifices
[38:23] i'd like you to turn with me they can
[38:24] bring it up on the screen if you have
[38:25] your bible hebrews chapter 10
[38:29] are you still with me here i appreciate
[38:33] this would be good for all it would be
[38:35] good for the young people the children
[38:38] hebrews 10 for the law having a shadow
[38:40] of good things to come and not the very
[38:42] image of the things can never with those
[38:44] sacrifices which they offered a year by
[38:46] year continually never make the comers
[38:49] they're unto perfect so you're talking
[38:51] about two to four thousand years
[38:54] of sacrifices
[38:56] by animals that god ordained and god
[38:58] said do this god god but with all of
[39:01] them
[39:02] thousands millions of sacrifices of the
[39:05] lamb that god said to bring with all of
[39:07] them it cannot make the the worshiper
[39:11] perfect
[39:13] it what's that scripture saying
[39:15] it don't deal with the problem
[39:18] if young people want to summarize
[39:19] version you say well i don't understand
[39:20] hebrews and all that i'm summarizing the
[39:22] next few verses and basically god's
[39:24] saying
[39:25] all the things even the sacrifice of the
[39:27] blood of the lamb doesn't deal with the
[39:30] problem
[39:32] for then would they have
[39:34] not have ceased to be offered if it
[39:36] dealt with the problem they would have
[39:38] stopped stopped offering blood
[39:39] sacrifices
[39:41] because that the worshiper once purge
[39:43] should have no more conscience of sin
[39:45] and and and that's desire for sin so if
[39:47] it was really have an effect the
[39:49] believer would have no more desire for
[39:51] sin no more conscious of sin if it was
[39:54] really dealing with the problem the
[39:55] desire for sin would be taken care of
[39:59] and so he goes on to say but in those
[40:01] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[40:04] made of his sins every year for it is
[40:05] not possible that the blood of bows and
[40:07] goats should take away sins wherefore
[40:10] when he cometh into the world he says
[40:12] sacrifice and offering thou what it's
[40:14] not but a body thou has prepared me in
[40:17] the burnt offerings and sacrifice for
[40:18] sin thou hast had no pleasure wait a
[40:20] minute god you're the one that set up
[40:22] the sacrifices and now you're having no
[40:24] pleasure in them why doesn't god have
[40:26] pleasure full pleasure in blood
[40:28] sacrifices that he set up why is it
[40:31] because it doesn't take care of the
[40:33] problem god said later on i'm gonna take
[40:37] care of that problem but the sacrifices
[40:40] of the blood of lamb and goats doesn't
[40:42] deal with the problem
[40:44] because why it doesn't attack and kill
[40:47] the conscience of sin
[40:50] the guilt of sin
[40:53] so the guy brought his lamb the priest
[40:55] brought it in for him once a year
[40:58] and the worshiper is somewhat satisfied
[41:00] they worship when they hear that goes
[41:01] into the inner veil there i guess we
[41:03] look at this way he goes behind the veil
[41:05] and he brings a sacrifice for the year
[41:08] and
[41:09] he's got little bells on his thing as
[41:11] the way my dad used to describe it
[41:12] according to the scripture is that if
[41:15] god accepted the sacrifice for the year
[41:17] that priest began to move around and
[41:18] dance and worship because god had
[41:21] accepted it for another year put off
[41:22] their sins another year remember to put
[41:24] on didn't do away with them
[41:26] so it doesn't do the guilt the worship
[41:27] is still going to leave with guilt
[41:29] right but he's worshipping and when they
[41:31] hear that priest in there and they hear
[41:34] the bells then the whole congregation
[41:36] begins to worship say praise the lord
[41:38] he's he's he's put away our sins for
[41:41] another year
[41:42] but it wasn't just a few days
[41:45] and the guilt
[41:46] and the desires are all still there
[41:50] what a pity friends to leave church and
[41:52] still have the desire
[41:55] if you want something deeper then
[41:57] find yourself at an altar of prayer
[42:01] find yourself at this altar if you got
[42:04] want god to deal deeper with you
[42:07] don't be afraid of it say lord i want
[42:10] you to change my desires
[42:14] get deep with god because he certainly
[42:16] provided a deep sacrifice for you
[42:20] they shouted they rejoiced but it didn't
[42:22] deal with the problem
[42:23] they put them off the blood of the bulls
[42:25] and goats thousands of them think of all
[42:27] the animals killed think of all the
[42:28] animal rights people would deal with
[42:30] this my goodness
[42:32] be chaos
[42:35] and all of it all the bloodshed all the
[42:37] bloodshed didn't deal with the problem
[42:40] all the sacrifices didn't deal with the
[42:42] problem we might we might relate that to
[42:44] our lives just in a little lesson
[42:46] that if you have the problem
[42:48] all the sacrifices you make for the
[42:51] church
[42:52] for society
[42:54] for charity
[42:57] all that's fine praise the lord that
[42:58] you're a servant's heart to each other
[43:00] but all the sacrifices will never deal
[43:03] with the problem
[43:08] how many vaults of blood
[43:11] was shed through the years and it didn't
[43:12] deal with the problem that's what the
[43:13] scripture is saying let me finish it
[43:16] for those
[43:17] in those sacrifices there's a
[43:18] remembrance again made of a sins every
[43:20] year for it is not possible but the
[43:21] blood of bows and goats should take away
[43:23] sins wherefore when he cometh into the
[43:25] world he says sacrifice and offering
[43:26] thou wouldest not but a body thou shalt
[43:28] prepare me in burnt offerings and
[43:30] sacrifices sin thou hast no pleasure
[43:32] then said i le i come in the valium of
[43:34] the book it is written in me to do thy
[43:36] will o god above when he said sacrifice
[43:38] and offering and burnt offerings and
[43:39] offering for sin thou wouldest not
[43:41] neither hast thou pleasure therein which
[43:43] are offered by the law then said he lo i
[43:46] come to do thy will o god he taketh away
[43:48] the first that he may establish the
[43:51] second that second covenant
[43:54] amen so we'll stop there you catch the
[43:56] theme now none of those sacrifices can
[43:58] deal with it god says i'm going to deal
[44:00] with it and men try to relieve
[44:02] themselves they even they try to bring
[44:04] religion and stuff but in an animal
[44:06] spirit here's another problem the
[44:08] enantios an animal spirit from blood
[44:10] could not come back on a man so now we
[44:13] come into what we needed how god is he
[44:16] going to deal with it first god has to
[44:18] it's almost the same thing satan says
[44:20] i've got to inject myself into the human
[44:23] race and it can't come by sexual
[44:26] relation it can't by can't be
[44:29] by man being involved because the man
[44:31] and the serpent has his hands all over
[44:33] this fall when i come to redeem them in
[44:36] order to reverse it properly man and
[44:39] women and the serpent nobody can have
[44:41] anything to do with this i've got to
[44:44] inject myself why does he inject himself
[44:46] into the human race because there has to
[44:48] be an ultimate blood sacrifice and he
[44:51] has to be a kinsman like us
[44:53] god could not in his state as an object
[44:56] of worship he could not redeem us he had
[44:59] to become like us
[45:01] inject himself into humanity
[45:04] be the sacrifice so that if we start to
[45:07] say i'm going to believe the word of god
[45:09] i'm going to believe the word of god i'm
[45:11] going to believe the word of god i'm
[45:12] going to head towards the word of god
[45:14] and then we start saying that and his
[45:16] nature his nature
[45:18] kills the spirit of the serpent and we
[45:21] take on the very nature of god listen
[45:22] now can of a spirit of a man come on
[45:24] another man yes an animal can't but a
[45:27] man can
[45:28] elijah's spirit came four times after he
[45:30] was gone so a spirit of a man can come
[45:33] on a man but i'm saying this spirit of
[45:37] the man christ jesus had to come in man
[45:41] not just in his head
[45:43] not just an influence not just to wear a
[45:46] bracelet that says what would jesus do
[45:51] that's not redemption
[45:53] he's got to get in your very nature
[45:59] is this good bible teaching this morning
[46:01] i like this i like this this might be
[46:03] simple to some some that's already went
[46:06] advanced above all of us
[46:08] but listen we need to know we have the
[46:10] problem
[46:12] and we need to know the glorious work of
[46:15] redemption and how god did it for all of
[46:17] us
[46:19] hallelujah
[46:21] and so now let me just start to wrap
[46:23] things to where i want to go now so the
[46:25] answer was god to get back in flesh he
[46:27] could not do it as god the answer is
[46:29] creating a seed in women which he
[46:30] prophesied to the woman the woman
[46:32] doesn't have a seat of her own she has
[46:34] to be with a man referenced last
[46:35] sunday's message it's all about the mail
[46:37] the woman can't do anything or no she
[46:39] has to receive the seed from the mail
[46:40] can you say amen so that we understand
[46:42] that principle but look at this god said
[46:45] god said it prophesied and said her seed
[46:48] will her seed so he speaks of her seed
[46:50] she doesn't have a seed of her own but
[46:52] he's referencing i will give her a seed
[46:55] i will create a seed in a woman
[47:00] you sisters ought to be shouting because
[47:02] did you ever notice that it was the
[47:04] woman and we hear that all the time it
[47:06] was the woman that we felt by it was eve
[47:08] it was eve it was the chick that got us
[47:10] in all this trouble
[47:13] and we hear it and we hear it and we
[47:15] hear it but i want to just remind the
[47:17] devil and encourage you sisters that
[47:18] when god said in his redemption i'm
[47:21] going to choose another woman
[47:25] he could have chosen either but no no no
[47:27] she's the betting ground for life and so
[47:30] now when i go to redemption i know a
[47:32] woman fall and i put her under a curse
[47:34] to be her husband be a ruler and all
[47:35] that that's exactly right but when i
[47:37] start the process of redemption i'm
[47:39] going to take my own scene and create a
[47:41] seed within her
[47:43] a woman
[47:46] praise the lord
[47:47] well
[47:50] so women have an important position
[47:54] in the kingdom of god
[47:56] praise the lord i ought to hear shouting
[47:58] from the sisters here this morning
[48:01] praise the lord
[48:03] she wasn't his mother jesus said she's
[48:06] not my mother
[48:08] she was an incubator god could have used
[48:09] something else but he wanted to take the
[48:11] very lowest and show what he could do
[48:13] with it so now she's looked down on the
[48:15] lowest especially when she fell in the
[48:17] garden but god says i'm going to take
[48:18] the lowest and i can show what i can do
[48:21] with that to raise it up and make
[48:23] something out of it praise the lord
[48:25] that's god and so to make a way that he
[48:27] could get his spirit back in man now i'm
[48:29] rushing as you can tell that's a
[48:31] powerful work of redemption when he
[48:32] comes and gets his spirit back in man
[48:34] that's not just being a part of a church
[48:36] that's not just being friends with the
[48:38] pastor that's not just having a position
[48:41] in the church no this is god bringing
[48:44] his own spirit in man that goes deep can
[48:48] you say a man
[48:49] that that
[48:50] that that is taking out the crabgrass
[48:53] the root of sin
[48:55] rooting it out can you say amen
[48:57] hallelujah
[48:59] the first part of redemption though the
[49:02] first part of it is paying the price the
[49:04] kinsman redeemer a boaz
[49:07] redemption is all through the book of
[49:08] ruth if you want to read it boaz he had
[49:10] to have three things he had to be
[49:13] able to pay the price to redeem ruth he
[49:16] had to be willing to pay the price can
[49:18] you say amen
[49:19] and he had to be a kinsmen redeemer
[49:22] three things
[49:23] christ
[49:24] became our kinsmen redeemer he became us
[49:28] he had to be willing to pay the price
[49:31] and he said in the garden not my will
[49:33] but thine be done
[49:35] but then he had to be able to bring the
[49:38] right price
[49:40] to redeem you
[49:42] you didn't have it you were in debt
[49:47] anybody ever ever been in a debt you
[49:49] couldn't pay
[49:51] anybody had such a huge debt some of
[49:52] your school loans and all that and you
[49:54] don't know how you'll pay it
[49:56] you're hoping biden will write it off
[50:02] before he gets out of office or
[50:04] kicks the bucket he's you're hoping
[50:06] he'll
[50:07] write it off
[50:09] and
[50:10] how many has ever been no we had when i
[50:13] came into the marriage i had we had debt
[50:16] and uh we shouldn't do that it's a bad
[50:18] thing but it was school debt and uh so
[50:20] we had some debt we had a certain amount
[50:22] and it was overwhelming to come into the
[50:24] to back then you had to make the
[50:26] payments the payments were high and so
[50:28] we had that hanging over us in our as a
[50:30] young couple
[50:31] and so then i won't tell you the whole
[50:33] story but it was a real miraculous thing
[50:35] god healing our daughter and all these
[50:36] other things so we were dealing in the
[50:38] living room with the insurance people
[50:40] and we didn't know anything about this
[50:41] or anything but we had about we had
[50:43] accumulated thirty thousand dollars in
[50:45] debt with the hospital through my
[50:47] daughter being sick and my wife being
[50:48] sick thirty thousand dollars so now you
[50:50] can imagine the school loan you're
[50:51] already in debt now you got a thirty
[50:53] thousand dollar thing you have no
[50:54] insurance you have nothing to pay it so
[50:56] now we're looking at thirty thousand
[50:57] dollars and we're looking at um a
[51:00] certain amount that was our school debt
[51:02] and so
[51:03] the insurance man is in our office and i
[51:06] just i'm jumping to the end here because
[51:07] i've taken i'll pick this up next sunday
[51:10] all right let's can we make a deal here
[51:13] because i have too much hay on my fork i
[51:15] got the lord gave me a lot last night i
[51:17] want to read some quotes because this is
[51:18] pretty exciting now as we cross over in
[51:21] the redemptive work that god's done it's
[51:23] powerful to see what god has done for
[51:25] you
[51:26] and sometimes you don't need to
[51:27] complicate you just say lord i thank you
[51:29] for what you've done for me and i
[51:30] receive it
[51:31] but we had a debt there was no way
[51:33] possible you know when when we were i
[51:36] got married and we were pastoring we had
[51:38] five families in the church something
[51:40] like that so i think about there's about
[51:42] 10
[51:44] 10 to 12 weeks there wasn't any money in
[51:46] the account to take a paycheck i set
[51:47] myself on a paycheck you know every
[51:49] after variant what it was it was too low
[51:51] according to my wife but it was it was
[51:53] what i could take because i always like
[51:54] to live on a salary i don't like to take
[51:56] all the tides i like to live off the
[51:58] salary because all you live off a salary
[51:59] and live on a budget but it was pretty
[52:01] small and her grocery budget was
[52:05] 30 every week
[52:07] yeah then the young people are going
[52:09] wow
[52:11] yeah that's what it was and then there
[52:13] was 10 or 12 checks we couldn't even
[52:14] take a paycheck i'd establish this i
[52:17] want my paycheck there's no money there
[52:20] so
[52:21] that's the state we're in and then all
[52:22] this debt hang on and this accident
[52:24] takes place you have 30 000 hospital
[52:26] debt and you got
[52:28] an amount for the school loans so you
[52:30] know it's overwhelming and we'll never
[52:32] in this state we're in would never pay
[52:33] that i mean we suppose we can take the
[52:34] next 10 years and you can do it but i'll
[52:36] tell you it's uh some things are
[52:38] overwhelming
[52:40] so that insurance guy comes in there
[52:42] and he's talking with us and he says you
[52:45] know he's prepared for us to sue for
[52:47] whatever astronomical amounts
[52:49] and uh
[52:50] it's a good thing i was uh kind of dumb
[52:53] because i probably would have sued him
[52:54] for a million dollars my
[52:57] my wife went through trauma after that a
[52:58] little bit so there was residual things
[53:00] that took place a lot of people would do
[53:01] that but i said we're not we're not here
[53:03] i said we don't have any money for the
[53:04] hospital debt so he said we're taking
[53:06] care of all that bring me the invoices
[53:08] and so then he wrote out a check to all
[53:10] the hospitals for the 30 000. now i'm
[53:12] just saying this can you imagine the
[53:14] feeling
[53:16] how many has ever raised your hand how
[53:17] many's ever been there when something's
[53:19] been
[53:19] some the drop the charges have been
[53:21] dropped
[53:23] or the debt has been forgiven or
[53:25] somebody walked in and i've done this
[53:27] now that i have i'm positioned to give
[53:29] i've walked in and paid a debt for
[53:31] somebody
[53:32] but the feeling of being on the other
[53:34] end of it
[53:36] where you don't know how you're going to
[53:37] do this and then you get an offering for
[53:39] somebody and from somebody
[53:42] how many has experienced the feeling so
[53:44] he's writing those things out he wrote
[53:46] up hated all that and then he starts to
[53:47] talk about well what amount
[54:08] oh you guys i got it like
[54:13] so
[54:15] so he starts to talk about this and
[54:17] we're just kind of
[54:18] we really don't know
[54:20] okay so now this man doesn't know the
[54:21] figure
[54:23] of our school loan that's the rest of
[54:24] the debt left he doesn't know it
[54:26] and he throws out a figure
[54:29] that is almost to the penny
[54:31] of paying off our school loan
[54:34] and and we didn't i don't think we
[54:36] realized at that moment but labor when
[54:38] we checked did we realize it right then
[54:45] okay so we had prayed before i forgot
[54:47] that part and when he said it then
[54:50] wow
[54:53] i'm telling you almost to the penny the
[54:54] thousand
[54:55] i tell you what it was it was 18 000
[54:58] and almost to the penny not exact on the
[55:00] penny but almost exactly to to the
[55:02] amount
[55:05] the man didn't know that we didn't tell
[55:07] the man that
[55:08] but god knew it
[55:11] but if any of you have ever been in
[55:12] those states when that man walked out of
[55:14] the room
[55:16] the feeling
[55:17] of having your debt paid
[55:20] you didn't have to do anything for it
[55:23] the feeling of having your debt paid
[55:26] overwhelms you
[55:28] and i'm here to tell you this morning
[55:32] there had to be a debt that's the first
[55:34] part of redemption there had to be a
[55:36] sacrifice to meet the debt
[55:39] and he went to calvary
[55:41] nobody knew what he was doing nobody
[55:43] knew he was going to deal with the
[55:44] problem and when jesus come up 12 years
[55:46] old or that he knew his commission and
[55:48] he knew in three and a half years he was
[55:50] headed right for that sacrifice that's
[55:52] why he was there nobody knew that matter
[55:54] of fact his disciples were so dumb to it
[55:56] at the end they're trying to keep it
[55:57] from happening can you imagine he's
[56:00] going to deal with their problem of sin
[56:02] he's they're trying to keep him from
[56:03] going
[56:05] that's how man can't understand
[56:07] when god deals with the problem let him
[56:10] deal with it
[56:12] don't question him doctor said oh no
[56:14] lord don't go from us
[56:16] do you realize peter and you what you're
[56:18] doing
[56:19] he's headed and he's headed right there
[56:22] his commission is i'm going to pay the
[56:26] price
[56:27] this is the moment that i'm gonna he's
[56:30] gonna bruise my heel but i'm gonna crush
[56:33] his head for my people i'm gonna save my
[56:35] sons and daughters
[56:37] i'm gonna release their debt from them
[56:39] you you owed every bit of the sin debt
[56:42] you owed every bit of that you've done
[56:44] you should pay for everything that
[56:45] you've done
[56:46] can i get people to raise your hands
[56:48] this morning
[56:49] it should come back on you
[56:51] but somebody
[56:54] walked the way
[56:56] the via dela rosa called the way of
[56:58] calvary and he kept going and he kept
[57:00] going and he kept going
[57:02] because he knew what he was doing i'm
[57:05] i'm going to take care of the debt i'm
[57:06] going to write the check
[57:11] let's stand together i gotta stop
[57:32] if you guys would jump to just one thing
[57:35] there it's one of the quotes in oneness
[57:37] and it would be
[57:39] 0211.
[57:41] oh no no 62 oh
[57:45] it'd be the third
[57:47] excuse me
[57:51] it'd be the third quote or the fourth
[57:53] quote
[57:55] if they're separated
[57:56] it starts with the debt of sin was paid
[57:58] can you find that one and we'll end on
[58:00] that the debt is saying sin is paid the
[58:03] debt of sin was paid
[58:08] now it would be down where it says the
[58:11] debt of sin is paid i don't have time to
[58:13] read all of them
[58:17] excuse me
[58:19] it starts with the debt of sin was paid
[58:22] can you find that one
[58:23] the debt of sin was paid
[58:27] jesus had to do this to send the holy
[58:30] ghost back upon
[58:32] to unite people again
[58:34] like it was in the garden of eden can
[58:37] you imagine now what this redemption is
[58:39] going to do
[58:40] never before this but now man if he sets
[58:43] his heart towards god and say i god i
[58:45] want you to change my nature he could
[58:47] ask for that all he wanted to before
[58:49] calvary and it wasn't going to happen
[58:51] till the price was paid right
[58:54] the holy ghost back on to unite people
[58:56] again like was there the debt was paid
[58:58] when jesus died that settled it amen
