TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. [Music] Sometimes I wonder, is he faithful? Does he see me in my trouble? Does he understand? [Music] Sometimes I question if he's able. Can he rescue? Can he save me again and again? But when I look back, did he move every mountain? Did he part every sea? Yes, he did. So yes, he came. Oh, did he defeat the darkness? Did he deliver me? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Oh yes, he did. So yes, he can. Sometimes those voices try to tell me I'm forgotten and I'm falling too far from his hand. But I know what kind of God he is. And I'm trusting in his promises. I'm believing and I'm singing. Yes, he can. Oh, did he move every mountain? Did he part every sea? Yes, he did. So, yes, he can. Oh, did he defeat the darkness? Did he deliver me? Yes, he did. So, yes, he did. Oh yes he did. Oh yes he can. Cuz I've seen too much now I can't deny. I know he's come through every single time. From the beginning until the end. He did. He will. He can. Did he move every mountain? Did he part every sea? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Did he defeat the darkness? Did he deliver me? Yes, he did. So yes, he can. Did he rule every mountain? Did he part every sea? Yes, he did. So yes, he did. Did he defeat the darkness? Did he deliver me? Yes, he did. Oh yes, he can. Oh yes, he did. Oh yes, he can. Yes, he did. Yes, he can. Thank you, Lord. Luke chapter 21 and uh verse 25. Luke 21 and verse 25. And there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth. One place in one of the gospels says looking at the fearful sights. It's termed fearful sights and looking after those things which are coming on the earth. For the powers of heaven shall be shaken. So we have words like distress. We have perplexity. We have fear in men's hearts. Their hearts failing them for fear. We have fearful sights that are watching. How can they see fearful sights constantly in front of them through television and through their phones? There's fearful sights that brings more fear and perplexity and stress. Verse 27. And then shall they see the Son of Man coming in in a cloud with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption drawth nigh. And he spake to them a parable. Behold the fig tree and all the trees. When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of yourselves that summer is now nigh at hand. So the fig tree is typed as Israel and all the other trees. In other words, everything begins to come into this bloom and this summertime and begins to come into its full manifestation. All things bad or good come to full manifestation at the end time. And when we see them come to full manifestation, when we see the fig tree Israel become a nation and come under nation and now looking for their revival. When we see all of the nations and all the spirits come to a head and manifest, all the trees coming into that manifestation, then we know we're close to the end. Jesus said this, "So likewise, ye, when you see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. Verily, I say unto you, this generation shall not pass till all be fulfilled." Look at this now. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. This is the generation that will observe and watch heaven and earth passing away. But when we watch that pass away, then we always know that there's one thing that will endure and not become corrupt. How many know that every system is becoming corrupt? But there's one thing that can't corrupt, and that's the word of God. The only thing we have left that won't corrupt is the word of God. But will be the generation that watches as heaven, earth, and things begin to pass away and things begin to fall apart. I want you to notice as I preach out of verse 34 this morning, and take heed, there's this warning to watch yourself. Be watchful. Take heed to yourselves. It's a personal thing. In this hour, take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts become overcharged with surfing and drunkenness and cares and worries of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. I want to speak this morning on the cure for emotional and mental instability. God never left us without a cure. But you can see Jesus said in verse 34 that we could be affected and our emotional life would be depleted because of the fear in in this generation. all will be affected by it and we can become emotionally and mentally depleted but God but God provides for his people in that hour he gives the cure. So I'm looking here this morning at Jesus depiction of our day and uh prophesying and giving us exactly the characteristics of our time. And we can see a last warning here that our hearts not become weighed down. When he says overcharged, it means our hearts become weighed down. Our hearts become drained. Our spirits become emotionally drained. And uh we should be on guard for that as Christians. He's not just talking to everybody, but particularly Christians. He's speaking directly to us because he says there, if you if you catch it, take heed to yourselves. It's a personal thing that that your hearts that your hearts he's speaking to the elect that your hearts, your spirit, your emotions don't become depleted and drained. Be on guard for that. In the in one of the amplified versions, it says, "Take heed to yourselves and be on guard." Because some of these words, you know, uh I always have to look up when it says surfing. Your heart's overcharged with surfing. I'm I'm thinking of surfing. Drunkenness. I understand. But, you know, okay. So, don't get into surfing and being drunk. It It's deeper than that. You know, I don't think your heart could become overcharged and burdened with when you're out surfing. So that's why you have to get up your Bible and look up these words sometimes. So the amplified says, "But take heed to yourselves and be on guard, lest your hearts be overburdened and depressed, weighed down with g with the giddiness and headache and nausea of self-indulgence, drunkenness, and worldly worries and cares pertaining to the business of this life. We live there, friends. This is dead on of what we go through to deplete us emotionally. So, I'm going to read it again. That we become depressed and weighed down with the giddiness and the headache and the nausea of self-indulgence, drunkenness, cuz that's what the world world teaches us to be. In other words, they have things to answer to this scare. They have things to answer to this fear. When we're emotionally feeling shaky and instable, then they have answers, but they're temporary answers. They're temporary fixes for it. And so, so, so now the headache, the giddiness, the nausea of self-indulgence, that's what the the world wants you to do. Drunkenness and worldly worries and cares pertaining to the business of the of this life, lest that day come upon you suddenly like a trap or a noose. And the last verse in 35 says, "For as a snare shall it come." So now a snare is a trap for an animal. It gets you snared. It gets your heart snared. It gets you under a bind. Can you say amen? And the world's going to do that. But believers got to say, "Wait a minute now. I'm not supposed to be bound by anything. This is just about time for redemption. I'm supposed to look up and lift my head up. Can you say amen? I'm not like the statistics to get burdened down by this. I have a source that I can go to. I have a fountain that I can drink from. My main focus this morning is to tell us that we when we get emotionally depleted and instable emotionally and mentally that we are not to buy into the idea that there's somehow no fountain in God that can get fill us up. We are not to give up that he doesn't have some fountain open for us to drink from to fill our emotional need. We cannot buy into that lie. God has given his word to this generation and that word is sufficient to take care of our need during this time. As a matter of fact, his word, you don't think it, well, it's for my soul. The word's for my soul. No, God provides for emotional depletion. God provides to fill you. God provides for a sound mind. God provides any instability that you're feeling. Can you say amen? God provides for it. What I find is most of our generation and many in the message are turning to other things for their emotional stability. Oh, brother Paul, are you going to go there? I'm going to go there. I'm finding that a lot of us are turning to other things to fill our void our void emotionally. We are an addictive society. David Courtright wrote in a book a couple 2019 he wrote a book called we are the age of addiction. The age of addiction. You can look it up. And uh David Courtright writes that we are the complete age of addiction. And the summary for the book he said at the beginning he says we live in an age of addiction from compulsive gaming and shopping to binge eating. So now when we think of addiction we think of marijuana. We think of someone in an inanol someone a dope addict. And so that's the addiction we think of. But this fell he's mentioned we're an addictive society. We have a lot of things that are addictions. Can you say amen? And he says his addiction from compulsive gaming and shopping to binge eating and opio opioid I never can say that word opioid abuse sugar can be as habit forming as cocaine researchers tell us and social media apps are hooking our kids. But what can we do to resist temptations that insiduously and deliberately rewire our brains? What's he saying? All these things over time rewire our brains. They mess with our sound thinking. What can we do that that we can resist the temptation that insidiously and deliberately rewire our brains? He said nothing. Nothing. David Cartwright says, "Unless we understand the history and character of the global enterprises and the the corporations, unless we understand the history and character of them that create and cater to our bad habits." So you can read the book because then he explores of course he doesn't have the answer. He says they're not really answered but he said maybe we could look at all the corporates that are contributing the corporations enterprises contributing knowing that we have this weakness knowing that America is this way knowing that we lean towards addiction because of our emotional depletion knowing that they gauge everything in entertainment and in uh selling whatever it is they gauge it so that they can become they can become uh the creator and cater to our bad habits. In other words, some in some ways we can help you, but when they go to help you, it's not really helping you. It's leading you more and more to addiction. Cuz guess why they want you to be addicted to their product? Because they make money. Amen. It's all about the mighty dollar. Come on now. They're going to make money off of you. They're going to make money off of medicines. They're going to make money. And trust me, today I am not criticizing. I'm not criticizing something that helps a person, but I'm here as a gospel minister that has to point you to what Jesus said and that we believers guard ourselves be from becoming to addict too addictive to something that is is to be the all answer for our emotional depletion. Amen. Man eating from the tree of knowledge is trying to help us in his way as he ignores the tree of life. Man eating from that tree is ignoring the tree of life that we can eat from. Where does all this start though? The craving number one, the craving in the soul for peace. Let's start with the soul. Man without the peace of the Holy Spirit in his life, the Holy Ghost in his life will be craving that his entire life and Satan has alternatives to bring that peace to his soul. In other words, being settled with God, being settled being settled that God, I've accepted his his uh his uh journey to Calvary. I accepted what he's done. I receive what the Lord has done for me because I'm a sinner. I need to be saved. Every person in this room was born a sinner. Every person in this room was born a sinner, unacceptable to God. But the problem is is we try to do good works and we try to do things that would give us a little bit of temporary peace to make us feel good in our soul. But God says, "I don't want you to do that. I want you to receive me and you receive peace. Come to me all ye that are weary and heavy laden." Why are they weary? Why are they heavy laden? trying to get peace on their own. But God says, "Come to me for your peace. Come to me for your settlement and I will give rest for your souls." So a man or woman can come to complete rest in their soul level that they are it's been settled. God has accepted me because I have accepted his Calvary experience. I've accepted what he's done for me. And now I'm accepted not because I earned it, not because I deserve it, but he has accepted me already. He died for my sins. And it meets the craving. But if you don't find that, if she doesn't find that, they will search their whole life because they got a craving in their soul. You have a craving in your soul. And the other bad part is people fill it with religion. They fill it with something that they do. If I can just do this and make mommy and daddy happy or make brother Paul happy and if I could just wear this and if I could just be this and be a good girl and do all this stuff. So you move into that mode of putting something on the outside. But a lot of people they still haven't met the craving on the inside. There's a craving that no dress, no outward religion, there's a craving that none of that will ever satisfy. It's his spirit that pours out in your life as you accept it and all of a sudden peace comes that I am at peace with God. I am in relationship with God. Let the world fall apart. I am at peace with him. Amen. God, help every person that's listening under the sound of my voice this morning here and on the broadcast and on the internet wherever you are. I pray you'll seek God to meet that craving in your soul. Please, please don't pass God by. Addiction uh originates in three main things and that is a past family dysfunction. a past family dysfunction. And then the second thing is a real bad trauma happened in life. That's the second thing. A past family dysfunction, a real bad family, a bill, a real bad trauma that happened to you, whether it happened to you when you were 5 years old or they happened to you last week. It's a trauma to your spirit. It's a trauma to your emotions. And third thing is the pressure of the demonic realm existing that we live in now is there's a pressure from the demonic realm particularly the sexual temptation and the saturation of filthy sexual things in front of us. So it's saturated with that and that brings a pressure on the human spirit a temptation on the human spirit. You're trying to hold to God but around us is this demonic force. this demonic pressure, especially on our young people, but it's on every it's on everywhere. So, three things can cause people to to to run towards some addiction to help them relieve and calm themselves. But you got to go back to the source that some past family dysfunction took place. You grew up with something that affected you and and we might as well be honest. You know, I like to say that uh you know uh the people come to our church and people come and they come from dysfunctional families. Um, probably most of us come from some dysfunction from our family. Oh, I had a pretty good dad and mom. I had a pretty good life. Most of us come and then I always like to say we all were born from a dysfunctional family, Adam and Eve. It's these things that lead to looking for remedies. a family a family trauma the a family dysfunction a bad trauma that happened to your life and uh the de demonic realm we're fighting against if these things in these things then it leads to looking for remedies everybody I want you to just think of not just think of medicine this morning when I think of remedies okay uh I don't want you to think of just medicine there are hundreds of other remedies to fill The emotional instable person, entertainment, books, music, movies, fashions, social media. You know, when you get to these parts just like it's like I say these things just just falls on the floor. Gaming, sports, roleplaying, meditation, concerts, things that emotionally charge us. A concert will emotionally charge us. Even Christian concerts. Now you trust me now. Even highly charged emotional gospel meetings, even camp meetings that are emotionally charged, and I'm not talking about the ones that are preaching the word of God in the right thing, but emotionally charged will appeal to someone who's who's drained emotionally. But listen, listen, be careful because someone could be be become into an emotionally charged atmosphere and be affected emotionally by it and get very excited. But it still can be just a temporary emotional fix because when you go back, you have the same addiction. When you go back, you have nothing to overcome with. It's a deception just to present an emotional atmosphere. So people feel so great at camp, but then they don't feel so great when they get home. So something becomes addictive when physically and mentally we become dependent on a particular substance and unable to stop taking it without incurring adverse effects. That's the meaning out of the dictionary of what addiction addict being addictive is physically and mentally dependent on a particular substance and unable to stop taking it without incurring adverse effects. In other words, enthusiastically. Here's another meaning to addictive. enthusiastically devoted to a particular thing or an activity. That's not drugs. That's enthusiastically devoted to a particular thing or an activity. That can become an addiction. And what's the addiction for? Trying to fill an emotional need. People go to all kinds of sources to fill their emotional need. And I'm here to tell you this morning, some of them are good, some of them are okay. But we can't only go to those things. We have to go to God even for our emotional and mental stability. So the devil deceives us in that message book or that Bible. Oh, this this there's nothing in here as I read. There's nothing in here for me feeling emotionally unstable right now. It's got to be something. No, it's not in here. That's a lie. That's a lie. in the presence of the Lord, in his word, as we as we stay with it. Young people, stay with it. Read it. Say, "God, reveal it to me." Because there is a filling of our emotional need. Even it fills our souls. It fills our minds. It fills our bodies. Even physical healing is in the word of God. Amen. We can't buy into the deception that modern problems and the reason I'm feeling emotionally depleted because of an incident, a trauma that happened, the reason I the the the answer for it has got to be some somewhere else. Some people even seek emotional filling from their own families. And I even do that. You know, we we love our families and so we we gravitate towards them, but it's still limited. It's still limited. It's still not the fulfilling that we need to fill with. Can I get an amen? Amen. Your wife, your husband, a boyfriend, a girlfriend, young people will will fill the void of their craving for fellowship. And they think that the answer all is if I can just be closer to this person and and and they can fill. And then they start doing it. They start filling that void, that craving that's within them and they this is the answer. And so now we need to do this, we need to move on. And so you have to be careful though because you have to fill your void emotionally first with our Lord Jesus first. Amen. Because if it's only in that boyfriend or girlfriend or that husband or wife, it will disappoint you someday and you'll still feel a lack on the inside. It has to be with our loving savior that we find that emotional stability. And if you only like the God in the mountain and you're going to just travel to camp meetings and you only like to live on the emotional highs, you haven't really got to know God in the valley yet. And if you're going to grow in the Lord, you have to know God in the valley because the same God that was in the emotional high, can you say amen, is the same God that's with you in your lows and you cling to him. You don't cling to some entertainment. You don't cling to some relieving of your nerves. If you have to do that medicine, I'm not condemning that. I'm just saying don't cling to that and not to God. Cling to God. We're weak in ourselves. And when we're weak, then God can express his strength through our weakness. It's humility to say, I can't do this on my own, and I'm not going to turn to something else to meet my emotional void. Turning to my God. God, I'm You don't think other prophets and other people in the Bible Christ said, "I've been mistreated. I' It's been It's unfair. I'm The hounds of hell are after me. I've got a Jezebel after me. I don't know what it is, but God, I turn to you. I will not turn to anything else. I am emotionally instable right now, and I'm willing to admit it, but God, I'm staying right here until you answer, and you come and you fill this need. You fill my emotional instability. You make me stable. You stabilize it. Can I get an amen this morning? Heavens and earth will pass away in front of you. But my word is stable. My still small voice is there. But you got to pull away. Come away. Song of Solomon. Come away, little bride. Come away. How many raise your hand say? I I feel that, but I don't obey it every time. I feel that voice of my beloved saying to me as a bride, come away. Come away to me. Get quiet. Listen to my voice. Come away. Come away, little bride. Every young person, every older person, everybody's called to the same still small voice. You may have heard it this morning because you sat long enough, an hour and a half, you sat and listen. Hopefully, it's not just my voice, but you hear something calling you. How many believes it'll bring stability to your emotions? I can be going through the worst thing. It just stabilizes.
