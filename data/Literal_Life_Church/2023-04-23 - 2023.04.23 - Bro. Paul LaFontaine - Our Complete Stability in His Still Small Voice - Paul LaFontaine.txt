TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and we trust we can bring something out of the word of God this morning we are very blessed and we're a rich people we're spiritual billionaires the bride is spiritual billionaires and we are blessed this morning with an inheritance and blessed with his word and so we should not take it for granted what we have and what God is speaking to us and what he's doing in our lives and this is the core of who we are when we meet together and worship this way and get into the word this way this is the core of what makes us up here and we can have other events and other things in life and we appreciate those things but the word is our stability can you say Amen praise the Lord first and that's what I want to speak about this morning our complete stability in his still small voice our cons our complete stability is in his still small voice First Kings 19 and we'll start reading at verse 9. we're picking up where Elijah here in the third phase of how the Lord dealt with him here and he came thinner thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and he said unto him what do us thou hear Elijah and he said I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken thy Covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and I even I only am left and they seek my life to take it and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the Rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the Wind and after the wind and earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake now this is extremely important what's being said here because God is going to show what he is going to be in and he's also going to show what he's not in that's important especially when you have people who are thirsty to find God and thirsty to find more of God they're in a vulnerable state because we must not just seek it anywhere but we must find what God is in and what he's speaking through we could be very deceived into thinking God is in something but he must make it clear to the prophet here where God is in where God is in and he said he wasn't in the wind he was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire all these real extravagant uh flamboyant things very extreme things but he's making it clear I'm not in any of those and after the earthquake of fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still Small Voice and I can finish it God is saying that's where you'll find me that's where you'll find me strange isn't it we look for big things but God says at the end this is where you're going to find me Heavenly Father we pray you'll bless the word bless the Every Soul that's here Lord in our midst and also online and whoever should hear this I Pray you'd anoint our words and God although many of us tired from the weekend and different things but God there's an energy in your Holy Spirit father when we begin to open your word and look at your promises father we know that we will be encouraged and uplifted we pray you'll bless every life that's here God every song that sung everything word that said may it be an encouragement and a blessing to us this morning as we've come to your house meet with us here Lord we pray and we commit the service to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for your glory amen amen God bless you may be seated now I'm just actually finishing and capping off uh some uh leftover things from last Sunday and so some of you visitors will just have to just catch on and we're just going to cap it and and just get the leftovers you know sometimes leftovers can be very very good you realize that right but just the capping off that I didn't get to last Sunday of this subject and we'll see where the Lord will leave from here but we want to finish this and last week I had preached on the cure for emotional and mental instability I know that seems like a strange title but uh it's very important under the the current uh climate of the hour God has chosen us to live in uh it's very important to talk about emotional instability and mental instability you say well why do I need to preach to Believers about that well uh we're the only ones I believe that we have a place that we can go to bring any instability can you say man we're the ones that have a place to go praise the Lord aren't you glad you raise your hand this morning that we have a place to go for all of that and that's what I'm trying to point you to but to say we don't need to talk about it well that would be denying us as a human being because we are affected emotionally by things we are affected sometimes mentally by things but God has promised in his word that he'll give us uh mental stability he says I wish above all things you prosper and be in health as your soul prospers and that he would give you a sound mind he would give us a sound mind and so Calvary did not just provide a saving of from sin but it also provided all things that we need to bring to him and so now in the age that we live in and I elaborated on it last Sunday so I don't need to talk about but we explored a little bit of the cultural plague of addiction the cultural plague of addiction how many knows that we're in an age of addiction and and the addiction is usually from a lack of the reality of God in man's Soul people people are turning to addictions and come to that because they don't have Gall they don't have the availability or at least they're not seeking God because God is the source for our soul God is the source for our emotions and and so now we have a whole uh nation and World addicted uh by many many things they're addicted to and it's because that they have not turned to the to the answer that God has given and uh there's no sense in preaching about other people but sometimes Christians in a hard time in their life don't turn to the answer that they know is the answer they'll turn to other things to calm their nerves they'll turn to other things to kind of settle them down and they go through mental times as I read last Sunday about Elijah when he was under the Juniper treat he was going through a real mental strain he was going through a depression so let's not deny who we are we can have juniper trees in our lives we can have low times in our lives and uh and so this is a reality in the hour we live in and I won't speak uh much more on those things because we we covered it last Sunday but we realized there's a thirst because we are a three-part being and because we are emotional because we have our minds and not just our souls but we have our emotions that there are things that deplete us in our spirit uh sort of we can call it this way constant withdrawals from our emotional bank accounts and we live in a world that constantly drains us emotionally drains us mentally can you say man and I mentioned three things that causes that and that is it can be family or domestic trouble uh it can be number two a severe trauma that's happened in your life you lose a loved one or you have something happen or someone treats you in a wrong way there's some trauma that happens to your spirit that's the second reason sometimes your spirit gets uh there's a withdrawal from your emotional bank and then there's family and domestic trouble that's number one but then there's the third thing of the Demonic forces just in the next Dimension that is an increased pressure against the Bride of Jesus Christ every day in the other dimension there's forces against you as a son and daughter of God that that are always trying to and I'm going to get to it today always trying to mislead you or pull you away from or cause you to lose the value of the fountain and the source for emotional stability to turn you to something else to accuse the Brethren can you say Amen most of the Christians that's in this room and Believers understand the battle that you face and it doesn't get any lighter it's stronger demonic forces are against the Bride of Jesus Christ to drain you try to drain you spiritually and even though your soul would be sealed into the kingdom of God Satan with what is left to try to drain you emotionally to drain you mentally to to drain you spiritually can you say Amen and and then we get weak and and then when we get weak we're emotionally uh just simple sometimes but the worst part of it is is when we turn to hundreds of other remedies for this instability that we feel come on the worst part of news is we turn to other things to calm our nerves sometimes and there can be even within the circle Believers and I can talk about many things I did last Sunday about things we even would turn to sometimes but we must be careful even something that is wholesome we must be careful that there's not a replacement in our lives for the true stability that's in the word of God my theme today is he's provided a voice within his word and that's still Small Voice is our full stability in our lives that voice that word is our stability for emotional pain that word provides all things needed for for mentally not feeling right can you say Amen and so there's a place that God has given no matter what we've gone through and then and then I didn't get a lot of time on the last Sunday but within the circle of Believers there's one sometimes that will seek signs and they will seek Miracles and they will seek wonders and they will seek emotional highs to try to satisfy their nervousness and instability I didn't figure I'd get too many amens on that one right there but you might as well talk about it is that people will turn to some emotional High even in a service and think that's the final answer but I've been serving the lord long enough to know that I can be in the greatest Sunday services and the greatest conventions can you say man and feel so good can you say Amen but when I go home the question is is did he bring stability in your life to face the enemy the next day if it doesn't bring stability and emotional stability then we realize that it stays shallow it stays a bubble dance Christians in this hour cannot live on casual bubble dances with the Lord our experience has to be deep with the Lord our River has to run deep can you say amen and I believe God is calling us to be a stable people of faithful people that we found the source in God to bring emotional stability mental stability can you say man praise the Lord so you know We crave the approval of others to meet an emotional depletion pictures crave to be approved by others you shouldn't be seeking to be approved by other preachers you should seek he told the Pharisees you love the Praises of men more than the Praises of God and that's because people live emotionally off of the Praises of men but it's more important that you have God's support God's approval then this since been your whole life trying to build a big church or do whatever to impress all the preachers I'm not here to do that to meet an emotional need my emotional need can be filled in the word of God can I get an amen this morning we're not here to build big churches we're not here to impress other message churches we're not here for that we're here to preach the message of the last days and see lives change and to minister and heal people that are struggling in this hour they need healing can you say Amen they need mental stability and guess what we've got the word to give it to them we've got a place for it this morning people need a lot of healing marriages need healing and I wouldn't even get up here unless I knew that I'm pointing to a word this morning I'm pointing to a still Small Voice that is the answer for every need there's been a fountain opened in the House of David if we'll drink from that he has the answer to our needs praise the Lord We crave the approval of others to be acknowledged you know I could go on all day talking about the emotional needs sometimes we meet it because we're thinking we're getting something spiritual but sometimes we're so obsessed with with image and appearance before others people in the message all this is try to fill a void of some somehow emotional void then sometimes the person has to have a position in a church or they'll just leave they have to be seen but you see you should never take a gift and you should never try to be seen to fill an emotional void in your life am I speaking the truth this morning I know this is right now where we're living but we've got to grow into stable people can you say man we can't lean to the approval of others and we can't live on our appearance if I can just keep my appearance and right in front of everybody then that feels no we must fill it with God's approval and God's love in our lives because I guarantee you if you keep trying to fill it with other things from Hollywood movies all the way to the approval of preachers if you're trying to fill some need in your life you will be disappointed that's Satan's kingdom can you say man every alternative he has is a disappointment but in God there's no disappointment there's only satisfaction there's only satisfaction and may look sometimes it may look sometimes like God he didn't answer oh it may look like God's disappointed but God never disappoints us God will never disappoint you got to fill your needs can you say Amen God will establish you God will stabilize you God will even you out can you say that God can take whatever you brought to church this morning and God can give you a stable peaceful mind and heart to say Satan I'm going through this by the grace of God man Hallelujah when we find all of it we're not we are not here to fill our thirst for stability with all this with something else but we'll find all of it in the Lord in his voice and that's my theme so now I believe God's calling us to be a stable people to express stability and consistency in an inconsistent world confidence the Bible says in Proverbs metal not with those people who are given to change don't Fellowship a lot with people that are given to change in other words from one week to the next you don't know where they stand you look at their posts and it's like one week they're posting something that's completely contrary to a Christian testimony and the next week they're quoting a scripture as if they're so close to God it's an age of instability don't meddle with them that are given to change and instability don't depend on the government don't depend on anybody else can you say Amen find your stability in the word of God and in his voice I believe it's the people that God is Raising to be confident not arrogant all right but confident now I'll say this when you're not a sinner because you get nervous sometimes you're a human being you're not a sinner because you get anger angry just be angry and send not God made us who we are we get angry it's an emotion we we get nervous we have nerves God put them in our body we just got to find something to keep them calm we've got to find the Lord but we will get nervous Elijah got nervous we can't deny how God made us but it's when we choose temporal things constantly and I'm speaking to the social media generation I'm speaking to all of us who have millions of alternatives to calm our nerves excuse me from medicine all the way to the entertainments of the world we're in we're in Satan's Eden here and if I could describe it he's the God of this world and because he's the God of this world he presents things to Believers even that would be an alternative to calm our nerves and I'm not against any of it as I said last Sunday I'm not against if a medicine is helping we give God glory but give God glory and don't ever think that's your ultimate end God helps you through that and say I give God glory he's helping me because he heals through medicine he heals through music he heals through the Mutombo family amen amen he heals through a little bit of love he heals through a little bit of caring for somebody don't you put in a box how God heals it's not just a healing line it's just not a healing God's bigger than that God can heal you right now while I'm minister in this word there's a still small voice speaking right now [Applause] you're not a sinner because you get nervous but it's when we choose temporal things constantly and we never stabilize into a more faithful consistent walk with God how many would raise your hands I want a consistent walk with God I want a relationship with him that doesn't go from cat meat into cat meeting consistency can you say Amen God the the pressures you know for a Believer that's the way we got to look at it if if more pressure comes on us then we look at it is it's going to turn it into more power over the enemy in our lives God's called You Higher don't forget that God's not called you to just be stay in a juniper tree and that's what we had the three phases of Elijah's life among Carmel how many has ever had a Mount Carmel how many would like to always every day have a Mount Carmel well it didn't happen in Elijah so it's not going to happen with you and then brother Bram says the second phase the first one was Mount Carmel then he went straight down hit rock bottom under a juniper tree sleeping it off for days depression people sleep they sleep they've turned all kinds of things but Elijah just slap it off and just that's why he tells pastors brother Graham says honey pastor's wife let the man sleep on Monday let him sleep I wrote a song about it for pastors once and a pastor's getaway brother matama was there it's Monday morning let the pastor sleep in because no one understands what he's been through it's Monday morning let the pastor sleep in I forgot the words oh cause this is what the word says he can do it's a quote oh let me sleep in on Monday mornings he said well I just sleeping it off so he had he had a low time he was wanting to kill himself God just kill me God just shoot me I'm finished I'm done I got Jezebel barking at my heels I've got all this stuff going on and I've just he just come from that real high ministers watch yourself you come that high to that low and he come right through that to experience even Jesus experience this depressing feeling can you say Amen it's real don't deny that it's not going on and and so but you see you have to know in those times that God has called you to something higher can I get an amen this way God has called you for something more can you say Amen it reminds me of the the pilot was in a one seat plane and he was going and flying at a certain level and he hears something in the back and he looks at the back and there's this little mouse in the back just chitter chattering and the mouse actually as he was flying and he only had one seat there he couldn't get back to the mouse he just starts to eat at some of the wiring that's running the plane he's eating it and he's he's going at it so this guy starts to sweat and get nervous he's wondering what am I going to do now I can't get to that Mouse and if he keeps eating this we're going down and he thought in a thought and he said that thing is still eating at those wires and all of a sudden he has this thought hey I can fly higher than that Mouse I'm built to fly higher than any little creature like that can I get an amen you know what he did he just went way up high until he's seen that Mouse just disintegrate and fall over dead I'm here to tell you this morning as a Believer you're not the world you're not called to addictions you're not called to any addiction you need to fly higher than that God's called you to something higher not because you deserve it but because he gave it to you say you're talking about everybody else in this room I'm sorry brother and sister I'm not talking about everybody else in this room I'm talking about you you're called to something higher we're not a mouse we're not grasshoppers how many remember that we looked like grasshoppers in their sight and in our sight as well you're not a grasshopper you're a son and daughter of God so when Elijah then when he comes to the juniper tree then he comes to the third phase which I read you this morning and he comes Elijah in the cave Mount Carmel the juniper tree and then the cave experiences the part that I'm emphasizing this morning the the cave was the third part of the mystery behind this the cave is the third part of the mystery how many know that three is perfection you will find in your Bible the basis of this number three being a part of the mystery and types throughout your Bible and I could list a bunch of them but this three has a spiritual meaning of of seven is completion but three is perfection so you when you hit the three then you hit a Perfection so in other words it's not in the first phase it's not in the second phase that you hit a Perfection but the third phase is what we're growing into and that's coming to Perfection and the number three means Perfection you'll find it throughout the Bible three means in the Bible means wholeness wholeness and Perfection not just perfection but wholeness Hallelujah it means wholeness how many you want to be whole this morning so you know it was the it was the third angel that came to Abraham with his final promise there was three parts to the Old Testament Tabernacle took three days for Israel to Cross Jordan it took ten to three days before they cross over Jordan Daniel Prayed three times a day Jesus said destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it up again and did he do it can you say my it was the third day that the mystery broke it was the third day that it was a Perfection that came I could read you hundreds and more you can look them up yourself the number three has a significance to it Jesus said destroy this Temple Paul was three years in the Arabian Desert until he come out with the mystery to preach the mystery of Christ there's three phrases to the Rapture can you say Amen a shout a voice and a trump the mystery breaks under the three Mount Carmel God gives you power and boldness like he did Elijah the Juniper what is that experience it tells us God will nourish us and sustain us when we are that low because he couldn't sustain himself we learn in the juniper tree that when you can't take care of yourself God will take care of you God will nourish you how many races I've been there done that I know what it feels like that I don't have the strength to go on and God's faithful to me to send me some Supernatural cakes can you say Amen a little bit of water can you say Amen let him sleep it off a little bit rise up take nourishment can you say Amen because we can't even get it for ourselves but we learned under our juniper trees that God will be there and sustain us when we can ourselves we learn in Mount Carmel to be bold and speak the word of God call fire down from heaven if needed Hallelujah but you see now then we come to this third thing it's kind of like two Extremes in our walk must have been two extremes for Elijah to go from a Mount Carmel which is the extreme of something glorious and God vindicating so much you could tell God was there God came and showed up God showed up God brought the fire god proved to the whole world all the nation of Israel this is my Prophet this is him this is God showed up in a a in a big way how many has had that happen in your life and it's it's a wonderful but it's like the two extremes because then you come to the juniper tree and it's the complete opposite and yet God is still there the same God that brought fire down and Vindicated himself to all of Israel now he doesn't need to vindicate himself to all of Israel now he needs to just be a nourishment to his prophet let me tell you friends God loves you so much that the same God that performed the supernatural in in brother branham's life the same God that the men the mighty works with seven times around the world the same God that stood there with him it's the same God who come comes and ministers to you when you need it the most it's not a different God it's the god of Elijah somebody say Amen it's not a different God than William branham's God can you say man it's the same God that was there it's the same God in the juniper trees the same God that answered by fire is the same God that can give you nourishment through the cakes and nourish your soul but there's two extremes and we have that in our lives the mount carmels and the juniper trees it's two extremes and I'm preaching stability to you we will need something more stable than the two extremes we need to move into a more stability than looking for another Mount Carmel to bail us out you know people get nervous about I believe this and people aren't believing me so I need Vindication Lord I need Vindication we gotta we've got to work something out I just I need the whole world to see I need all my office to see and everybody to see everything come and vindicate yourself and and even though this message has been thoroughly completely Vindicated you couldn't vindicate it anymore but listen I always say this the final Vindication is coming someday you're gonna see you're gonna play around with it it doesn't mean anything it's just this prophet's another Pebble on the beach you go right ahead but there's a final Vindication to what this message is and it's coming someday but I'll tell you I don't need that to keep me in because I met the god of Elijah in the juniper trees I met the God on Mount Carmel I've met the God I know he's real can you say Amen my God is Not William Branham my God is not a prophet my God is the Lord Jesus Christ that worked through that prophet foreign praise the Lord I'm getting my second wind here today after that wedding I'm ready to run after the devil this morning if you run after him with me Hallelujah so God is God is bringing his Prophet through this Prophet process but he needs to show his show him the final mystery it's the third one that he must come to and the bride must come to as well he says stand out in front of the cave come out of that cave and stand up on the mount I want to show you something so God calls him to the cave and shows him something he has a secret that he has to pass to Elijah to stabilize things you know one of the things he said when I'm alone loneliness and feeling alone is so prevalent today especially in our teenagers can I say something about it it's not in my notes but can I say the devil taking our teenagers in their loneliness and telling them lies in their minds you don't have a friend in the world you're a part of something that's cause cause you to not have any more friends you're gonna you're different all these other lives of the enemy and he he abuses the loneliness until they turn to other things young person listen to me if you trust me as God's servant God has never left you he'll never leave you and he will provide you the right friends you wait on the Lord he'll provide you the right husband he'll provide you the right wife you wait until you get the right one and don't let Satan take your emotional craving for friendship and provide you with the wrong types of friends wait on the Lord and he'll renew your strength because he loves you that much [Applause] don't draw your identity off a pin Pinterest or some other stupid thing on the internet get into this Bible get into this message and say God show me who I am as a daughter of God Hallelujah and so now this third mystery it's destabilized and to show him because if get this now it's and this is what it is today knowing he's going to show Elijah where I God's saying I'm going to show you where I will be knowing where God is where to find him and Friends listen that's my message this morning showing us where he is and where to find him is everything it's everything why are you saying that why find him at church not always we don't have church every night so what are you going to do Monday through the rest of the week I'd like to have church every night but I might be here by myself I don't know I but you're not in church so so it's not just in church but we're we we have to look at this and we have to see it's essential that we know where God is and where to find him to get a hold of him today this may be so just dirt simple this morning but listen I'm telling you this because we have an enemy that I'm facing even this morning in this service that is distracting the young people and distracting even bride members to cause us to lose value of where God is in the still Small Voice to cause us to fill our lives and make it busy till we don't have time we don't sit still and shut out all the noise so we can hear this still small voice he's saying that it's everything in there and Satan's saying he's doing everything to keep us from it everything to keep us from it I'm looking for answers I'm looking for answers you better know where God is and where to find him he's going to say to Elijah some interesting things here and I don't know how I have time for all these quotes I won't be lengthy today but he's going to say he's going to bring an earthquake and shake up and he's going to bring a win and shake the Rocks off the mountain while he's standing there in the cave he's going to do this he's going to do that and he's going to do all these things and he's going to show him clearly where God is and that's important for you to know every young person every person here every person under the sound of our voice there's a lot of people there's a lot of voices there's a lot of churches there's a lot of things there's a lot of things on social media a lot of presentations of God but listen there's only one voice of Jesus Christ and and you have to say Lord let me find where that voice is let me stay close to it let me shut out the other voices we must know where God is where to find him and what God is in he said see people can say God's in this and God's in that and he's saying Elijah I'm not in the earthquake look at that wind comes all right God's in there God's saying no I'm not I'm not going to be in that I read some quotes out of what hairstyle Elijah last Sunday I'm going to read them three some more now from there and I just would advise you to listen to listen to that message from Jeffersonville what hears thou Elijah because he says things about the the fire and all these things he says things a lot more uh plainer um that I have the time to give this morning but he says if you guys will bring that up I'm catching it in the middle of the sermon when he when it's now it's presented this fire comes before Elijah this earthquake this wind all the great fuss and America is guilty of listening to those noises oh we love me noise but God is not in the noise although as honorable and things as are yet God isn't in noise if that would have been so when the Africans beat the tomtoms you never heard such a noise in Rhythm God wasn't in it and we have rushing Mighty winds we've had all kinds of fires and earthquakes and shakings and great revivals and things like that God wasn't in it if it had been it would have showed itself up but after that see what brother Brown does that that God may have moved in a service but what happens after that what's the results after that and he says for a lot of those revivals in Pentecost he said but after that it says but let me pick it up here if it hadn't it but after that come a still small voice but then God was in the voice that's what I'm thinking today friends we people are so carried away with all the noise so America loves noise look at what we're doing uh they turn off the old radios just as hard as they can with rock and roll and Boogie wigging all this kind of stuff they got to have it so loud it'll Blast Your eardrums out nearly all the noise all the time of the day and in the church we beat the tambourines we run up and down and screamed and hollered and whooped and had a great time like that nothing against it not a thing against it you're not going to scare me if you do that this morning rejoice in the Lord but the promising but where was God in it what did it do broke us up into little pieces called the Assemblies of God the Church of God the Pentecostal United Oneness all these other different little denominations God wasn't in it of all the shouting we've had enough blasts and noise to convert the whole world we've had enough hurray and hollering and carrying on to what it's what's it done it y'all don't get offended at me reading this you can get offended at the word but you shouldn't get offended at the word he's speaking straight to us that we must make sure that God is in something and we must make sure that other things don't replace the still small voice he's pointing to that in the third mystery in Elijah where to find God praise the Lord praise the Lord he's pointing it in the third part of the mystery and so let me finish these hollering carrying on to what it's done it hasn't built the church it's built denominations it's made men go out with puffed up ideas and stuffed shirts I don't like that stuff walk out on the platform and say oh look at him he's a prince look how he's dressed just polished and everything he knows how to make his vows and so forth that ain't what God chooses later on the quote he says what we need tonight is a deep rich experience that something down in US it don't have to shout yet it might shout but we put all the emphasis on shouting it might never speak with tongues yet it might but we put all the emphasis on that it might not it might not attended Billy Graham's meetings or Roberts meetings or my meeting you don't have to what you don't have to if you go and you hear this still Small Voice which which you will in some of those meetings praise the Lord that's what you're going for what is God speaking in that syllable Small Voice to me but you don't have to go he said uh what is it says it might not attended Billy grams you don't have to what it has to have is that depths of God's eternal love that Spirit on the inside and that makes you what you are that's what I was speaking about this morning that's what I was pulling the church across Calvary back and forth don't you think because you spoke with tongues or that you know so much about the scriptures or you read somebody's books or you know so much about the message I'll put that in and you know more than the other fella you see pride comes up you see when we're living just on an emotion then denomination divide comes up all this comes out of it come on friends that's what he's saying I'm about this preacher I'm about that preacher and and and we get shallow of the bubble dances in our experience and we're about this and we're about this other fellow and and and you know uh you know if you if I want to know somebody else's books or I want to read these books and and the the problem is is that now you got a pride that you know more than the other fella you want to be led by the spirit of God be gentle and don't know a whole lot it's a direct quote from the prophet be gentle and not whole know a whole lot and we're we're going to be filled with the intellect and knowledge of God filled with all these things that just don't let it turn into Pride that I know more than the next fella he said put a mark on those who sigh and cry for the Abominations that did in the city who would he Mark in our cities tonight it's the depths of the spirit not the shallowness and I wanted that lay add this into in this part of the quote later on the message he just says and when Elijah heard that still Small Voice nothing bothered him oh wow we only need that sentence to live on can you say man once he comes into God being in the still Small Voice something calmed his nurse something called his mental state nothing bothered him he stabilized by the still small voice once you hear it can you say Amen you see young people you got to quit I can tell when you're listening to country music and rock and roll music and pop music and that's on your phone all the time you're not listening to the still Small Voice because you'll never get that result if you're listening to his voice and really getting it you'll never turn to those things oh okay I'll be like brother Diggs and I'll start sniffing out some more devils you can never defy that country music it's just as perverted as all the rest you're bringing your soul and your spirit through that thinking that's gonna refresh and calm your nerves no it's leading you down a path you don't want to go but if you'll just come and be filled with the spirit of God and start listening to that still Small Voice those voices Fade Out this is greater can you say May I don't need no country artist to go on my nerves I need the Mutombo family to come I need to watch videos of the matambos the lafontaines I need Holy Ghost filled music to calm my nerves amen I need the fight for Ministry because the true faithful Ministry it's not what you see up here it's that still Small Voice that's speaking to you yes it is yes it is this still small voice turn into other things shows you're not listening to still small voice it never leads you in that direction amen can you say Amen and you say ouch then if you can't say Amen uh I'm not taking my coat off because I'm going to preach another hour I'm taking it off because I'm hot that's just it it's just that simple like the ministry takes his watch off and puts it on there and the little kid says why does the minister put the watch up there what purpose in that and the mom said it means nothing absolutely nothing at all doesn't mean anything moving to the mystery of our hour can you can I have 10 more minutes here now the breach the breach is how he named it the breach between the church ages and the seals okay this is what he preached before the seals the breach what's that breach mean a breach means a a gap or a break in a wall in a barrier so if we're applying this now when we come to the end time there was there was a wall there was a barrier between the church ages and the seals but we had to get to the seals because there was something further in there that we needed even though we were Christians even though Calvary washed away our sins even though that when he spoke it is finished on the cross it was finished but yet we when we're born and received the Holy Ghost there's something there's a barrier yet there's a there's something we still need to get to in the end time amen so our lamb our lamb Jesus Christ went 2 000 years ago and he paid the price of redemption he finishes paying the price how many believe that this morning our land I call it my lamb my lamb I'm nothing without my lamb and he went two thousand years ago and he paid the price he he saved us but even with that there's still a barrier there's still a barrier at the end time what is it what is the barrier what's going to pop up now well in Revelations 5 our lamb is going to come again we know there was one walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks we know there was seven Messengers and Angels through the church ages those Messengers were used of God for each days to bring the word for the age but our there was one like the son of man walking in the midst of the candlesticks so he was there as Son of God throughout the church ages he was there anointing these men but at the end our lamb shows up again in Revelations 5 in a symbol of what he's got to do now so our land we ought to be happy just with that is that our land went to Calvary but there's still a barrier for something for us and so who has to show up to break make a breach a breach in the barrier who shows up nobody else could show up but the lamb your lamb shows up at the end time because he's gonna take this barrier and he's got to break through and the the way that he so so now what is it will you just bear with me now the book what is it it's the book of redemption it's the book of redemption it's the title deed it's the book that went back in the hands of the original owner it's the inheritance it's it's the book that has our name on it it's you know what the book is it's all about you the book is Christ and you are the words in the book so the barrier is is that the original owner has the book but the book has not been handed back to the people it's owned by the barrier is is we may have been saved and filled with the Holy Spirit through the church ages but there's still a barrier because this book is everything because it's it's all about you and who you are not your first birth but your second birth and your real identity can you say Amen before you sin before sin came in the picture before anything listen I'll just go ahead and tell you you tell me if you could look at this book and he could reveal to this to you the secret that's in this book of your name I ask you wouldn't that be the most stabilizing thing that you would ever have in your life this book would be the most stabilizing thing in your life this book would stabilize everything this book is bigger it's greater knowing what's in that book is greater than your trouble than your trauma than your family dysfunction than your past hallelujah it's greater than all of that that's why he had to get this book to people again see why are you preaching this way because I'm preaching on the still small voice and I'm preaching on where to find he's what he's what is he going to be speaking through because I got to find where he's at and what he's speaking through and what he's using in order to hear what he's going to speak out of that book oh glory be to God if he could start speaking in that still Small Voice what's in that book wouldn't it fill every need of your life how powerful is it I can't describe how powerful it is I know the prophet said when the lamb took the book it was the most Sublime things in this it was the most Sublime thing in the scripture Revelations 5 you have it in your Bible the most Sublime act in the scripture is when that book was in the hands of the original owner and in the symbol and in the in the vision it's not in the hands of the original it comes into the hand of our lamb and it's got it and it's and so then it's sealed up nobody could unseal it nobody's worthy and so he takes it the most Sublime thing in the scripture for your life what am I doing this morning I'm calming your nerves I've got the ultimate cure here this morning I'm I'm carrying your problems because in that book there are no problems in your identity can you say Amen there is nothing lacking in that every emotional need you have every Deliverance you need everything is when you start hearing what's in that book what was the breach what was the break in the barrier what broke it what was the blast that broke the hole in the barrier as Revelations find our lamb two thousand years 2000 years later he takes this book and just the fact he took it should make us happy that this this book of redemption he said why are you preaching this because Satan has misinterpreted what this message is to where people lose the value of it or they say that's just the man with the seventh grade education he's another Pebble in the breach I'm not preaching the man William ran him to you I'm preaching what he directed what God directed us to like Elijah where will I find that still small voice where will I find the source he's he's caused people to um he's caused people to say it's out of date it's old it's it's not significant to the needs that are now some of the vision dates were wrong come on preacher and there's some mistakes yeah there were there were no I've never not admitted and that's I come across those things okay that date doesn't match this date or whatever you know and then I went to my Bible and I studied all the prophets of the Bible and I seen their mistakes so now there's there's no end to this because there's no end of this because now you start if you're looking with this carnal mind with the reasoning is a powerful Realm and you start looking at through that channel now you take your Bible and you'll talk yourself out of every prophet of the Bible and you'll talk yourself out of Jesus Christ being the Lamb of God because God never said this so you can figure it all out up here this is Vision quoted over and over again you know that spoke something to I said this a few months ago I said a couple years ago too in some of these attacks came I didn't expect to say this this morning but when these attacks came it's like what's the devil doing here I'm always thinking you know and you know why I I'm here you know why I have the value in it because I've connected with the still small voice of Jesus Christ I would never leave that in that message it was not a man to me it wasn't the seventh angel to me there was a voice within the voice [Applause] and that's not William Branham that's my lamb that's Jesus Christ I found him [Applause] and brother Ram talks about that you know you look at those pictures you can't make out what's in there you know it's all a mess and then he says then it's put together but if you keep looking at it he says once you see what's in the image of the picture I think brother rap did one a few months ago and so once you see it then you can't see nothing else and then he calls he says once you see Christ the message all the rest of it just Fades out I don't have to have every date perfect because he said Elijah Elijah said directed me to the lamb I'm living on the still small voice and it doesn't need to be any more complicated than that but because he says and I was going to finish the story about there was someone said this Billy Paul's standing there at the May Company in California he said Billy Paul before you're an old man there'll be sharks swimming here around this may company so now I'm just making a point here now for all of us is that God doesn't leave it up to us to interpret his visions he interprets them by bringing in the past who puts himself in a position to start interpreting these things when it's happened to it you know I don't know I'm not a prophet but there was a comment made by a minister that since he said that to Billy Paul there's been several times that they had a flood near that may company and they have pictures in the news of sharks swimming through that May Company already so once again I'm not interpreting but if we just say that's still coming it's still coming Billy Paul before your name before you're an old man you're you can interpret that it may have already taken place oh boy I should have stayed up there and it should have stuck with my notes I was doing better get back up here JP stand right here and stick with your notes come on now I thought this was a note that my tie was cricket thank you Brandon I I just said that to say listen listen this is not to be figured out up here and it's not to be devalued by the enemy for him to cause you to not listen to and not feed on shouldn't be feeding on all this other stuff you feed on the thing that has the still Small Voice in it we're in the last days we're about to ready to get out of here is this important this is the most important thing in life that I am connected with this no Small Voice every teenager in this room to say there's nothing more important a husband wife nothing is more important than me connecting with his voice for my life and obeying it and listening to it but Satan destroys the value of where the sources of if I'm preaching the message that came through that seventh angel then he could have his still small voice speaking through my voice this morning to you are you listening are you catching it what's he saying to you that will be your stability in this hour it'll tell you how to live it'll direct you every day it'll tell you what career to have it'll tell you principles of Life sisters that'll tell you how to dress like a Godly woman you won't get that voice in any other thing even the denominations you won't get it but in the word and it's still Small Voice he's so loving to you he'll tell you what to wear Brothers he'll tell you what to wear and that does not include long hair Brothers praise the Lord boy I just get myself in all kinds of trouble here breach was the blast that broke the hole in the barrier and that was our lamb came now and our the book the book the book is in the hands and then he strips off he he he he he's holding the book and he begins to peel off he he takes the book we all should already be shouting that the book is back in the hands of our lamb this is this book is everything it's who you are it's everything you say what are you talking about I'm talking about events that's already taking place in our generation but I'm bringing it to our lamb had our Christ had it and he peels off Seven Seals seven Mysteries that held the contents in the book he stands there and he peels them off and he breaks them guess what that's what it says in Revelation said now what happens when he comes to do it he comes down to Revelation 10 now he's peeled he's got the seals off and so he's going to come down and descend Christ our covenant angel and the Bible says he comes down with the book open because in Revelations 5 is it sealed he tears the seal off now he comes down now what does he do next he cries out seven Thunders come and then it says the seven Thunders uttered their voice so don't complicate it what's going to happen he's going to speak something oh thank the Lord thank the lord it's not going to be some hidden thing in a cloud somewhere it's going to speak and then he asks well is our Lord going to speak it how is he going to speak it in our own language and bring it how it's going to start blasting those things for us to us and and how's he going to do it well the answer is in the Bible over in Revelations 10 Revelations 10 7 now this Angel comes he's black he's speaking something he's bursting forth with the contents of this book and win win win who win Revelations 10 7. in the days of the voice of the Sabbath is completion one of those Angel Messengers what are those Stars see brother Paul I already know these things well listen to it again say Amen again I'm saying because our young people don't know that this message and what God did in this duration what he's doing now is right in this Bible you don't have to file a denominational Creed or someone's interpretation it's happening right now when he says the seventh angel he had seven Messengers seven angels in the right hand Paul arenius brother raps going through it on Wednesday nights Paul renius gets the final seventh Angels who's the seven well that's everything who's the seventh one I believe I know who he is I believe I know who Malachi 45 is there's no doubt in my mind I know that's already settled but what's the important thing not so much that that it's him but it's what is he going to speak and he says how am I going to blast forth all this I'm going to use the seventh angel because he's on Earth right now and I'm going to blast those things through his voice and once it bursts forth it's just going to keep speaking and speaking and speaking and there will be a little bride that said I hear a voice I'm learning God isn't always in the earthquake in the Wind I'm learning and stabilizing in a Christian that I might shout my shoes off but if I didn't have the still Small Voice to speak to me I stay shallow I'm going to bring it in that seventh angel but guess what there's no there's not just seven verses to Revelations ten there's four more did you know that because if there's only seven verses then we all capitalize around the seventh angel and that's the emphasis talk about the Seven Nation talk about his stories talk about what God did through him bring him back just play him all due respect there's not just seven verses in Revelations 10. there's four more verses and when the seventh angel is done and he speaks the mystery of God should be finished the secret the secret will be finished speak it and in that you find this still Small Voice what did he say in the last four verses well another voice spoke again to John who's a type of the Bride when the seventh angel was done what did he say to do anybody know you should know what those verses say we're living in them right now what did he say to do now that this voice speaking this mystery to you take this book take this book and feed on it feed on it eat it spiritually eat and when you get to 2023 and you're feeding on all kinds of other things the voice of the Lord says stop feeding on everything else get a hold of this book marriages families singles wives husbands get a hold of this and eat it and let him speak to you bring that last quote up so when he comes to Christ the mystery he says this at the end of it Christ The Mystery of God revealed the next one next quote is there any more okay I'll go up here and read it was there another quote okay it says at the end all this mystery is revealed everybody still like me if you disagree fine just still like me please it doesn't end with seven verses it ends with 11 verses doesn't end with the seven angel it's the bride feeding on the right thing how are we going to get out of here we're going to eat our way out we're going to eat our way out and I like that idea [Applause] praise the Lord God is good I'm pointing you to the source can you say Amen don't let the devil devalue the source for your life even for stability mental emotional spiritual can you say about that's why I read that to you last Sunday in in Luke 21 he says there will be distress of Nations there'll be men's Hearts failing for fear there'll be wars and rumors of wars there'll be all this distress all this pressure come on you and Jesus describes our age perfectly and then he says Heaven and Earth will pass away he says you'll watch everything pass away you'll watch everything crumble corruption sets up in all things no identity left knocking at our door trying to get us to accept a trans it's crazy it's Insanity can you say amen I have an article that he pegs it one of the presidential presidential candidates Vic is his name I think he pegs and he's not afraid to do it they have signs to show this is a this is a problem with the mind of how someone's thinking it's insanity and my Prophet said it'll be completely totally insane people won't think with a sound mind anymore and we have to deal with it I'm I'm going in Home Depot I go back to get some stuff and this person comes up like this and and the way she talks I said she said can I help you and I said yes ma'am and I said ma'am to her and she gets offended because I really couldn't figure out what it was and in the same store 10 minutes later I go up front and I'm having a person help my wife and he's a he's a nice ah he's a nice guy and he's helping us and he's polite and all that and he's helping and I said to my wife said this man's going to help us and he starts helping he says and by the way I'm a girl I felt I'm sorry I didn't realize can't tell and if you could tell then they get mad at you because no I'm not that anymore I'm something else now brothers and sisters listen well young people listen to me trust me as your servant this is not going to get any better these are spirits these aren't just people it's not that person they'd open their heart a little bit I'd Point them to the source of Deliverance we should love them can you say Amen this is the world we live in we're not going to get around it and it brings pressure it brings instability our spirit is troubled but thank God he says you'll want the same generation to watch Heaven and Earth pass away it'll pass away in front of your eyes but the word will stand forever he pointed us to the thing in the midst of that distrust he says you'll watch something that will never corrupt can you say Amen it'll never pass away it's Eternal it's stable it stays the same if that's true that's our source let's stay in it let's feed on it let's pull away from other voices I'm if you don't get anything else today stop feeding on other things and get into this word I'm holding it up before you you need your life in this word you need your life in the message of the last days you have to feed it and eat it for you to hear the still small voice let the children hear it can you say Amen Let the homes ring with it can you say man it is our only source for stability in this hour and when brother Branham I'm closing when brother Graham says about this mystery he says but all of the mystery is revealed as he promised to his bride hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bread the bride is standing on it that's your stand listen why do you hunger Church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you you hunger you thirst and you fill it with other things but all the while it's the father trying to get this hidden secret to you this still Small Voice it's not a loud voice you have to quiet down and hear it it's the father trying to reveal this hidden secret to you oh you found it it's the father trying to heal reveal this hidden secretary but you let so many things get it out of you that's what he's saying at the end of Christ the mystery he's speaking the same thing as as early in his years you see this is it he's given us the answer but next one you let your job get it out of you you let your wife you let your husband you let your children now it's interesting those things can become distractions that you can become all focused on that you know don't ignore your children take care of them that's not what he's preaching he's saying there's a still Small Voice and a mystery God's trying to get to you and you get distracted by look at this your wife your husband your children the worries and cares of this world you let some pastor I'm not a replacement for the still Small Voice in your life if I'm gone someday you're going to need this still Small Voice if they shut this church down you're going to need something deeper than just some bubble dance in the Lord you let somebody else get it out of you when you know that way down in your heart you're thirsting and hungry it's God try to reveal it to you Hallelujah and he's not gonna stop trying to get this secret to you he's not going to stop trying aren't you glad he's not going to stop trying to get it to you I say Lord crash through all the my distractions crashed you rebuke me Lord let me remove every voice every hindrance so you can get just true to me I need it Lord I need it for stability in my life let's stand together let's give the Lord a hand type of praise for the voice of God he said to us it's the father why do you hunger why do you thirst and then you take a thirst and you try to fill it with other things and all the while he's trying to bring you the thing that you need and he says he's trying to get this hidden secret to you Elijah I want to show you he's not I'm not in the earthquake I'm not in the Wind all those things are fine I'm not in the fire but you'll find me you'll find me isn't it important we find where he's at boy we better find where he's at for our lives you'll find me in that still small voice of the word it's it's in it's in there oh I love the Lord so much I love him so much the mystery the whole thing and it's not complicated just trying to get it to you to to to bring us a Rapture but to bring a stability in our times we live in mental emotional stability spiritual stability we won't make it without it we can't go through the trauma and family dysfunction and all these things going on we won't make it through this without the stability of the word in our lives it's the word that he's put in place for us and if we get to the moment I notice that as a Christian I just get just a few days away from it filling with other things too much away from it and I can feel my spirit getting shaky can anybody else raise your hand I don't know what you're feeling if you don't feel that but if you get away from that Source far enough you should start feeling I'm feeling shaky I'm feeling nervous I'm feeling but then I come back I've been doing it for whatever I've been serving the lord I come back to that and it just meditations the Lord speak to me something and then that voice of comfort that voice of stability a voice of answers this is what you should do it's noisy around our world it's noisy Our Lives full of noise so if he called this the still Small Voice we're going to have to really settle down and shut everything else out so I could say what is he trying to tell me what is he trying to tell me when he says your wife can get in the way or your children then brother you may have to do this and you won't have your wife on board for a while hopefully you're in a marriage where the wife is on board said I need to do that this is an individual thing this is not an emotional dependency on somebody else if they'll do it first well if I see a Revival break out in the church then I'll do it brother Ram says don't wait for the church to have Revival have it within yourself and it'll break out other places you don't wait you don't wait until something happens to somebody else you don't wait for the next big convention the next big camp meeting young people you don't wait you don't need to wait for the next camp meeting coming up right here this morning the Lord is speaking to you connect relationship with you can you say Amen pray together praise the Lord lay your hands on one another let's pray for one another you guys can play something is still a small voice speaking to us Jesus Jesus can you see there's just something about that name I don't know what kids and Jesus Jesus Jesus there's just something about that name masked savior [Music] Jesus like the fragrance after the rain hallelujah oh Jesus blessed Jesus Jesus [Music] let all Hero and Earth Proclaim [Music] Kings and Kingdom will all pass away but there's something about I need

reading they're going to invite the whole family together and they're going to read the will so you can be excited about it you could look forward to that day but then that day comes when it's not just going to be something in a book or something in a file the lawyer is actually going to speak what's in the book I'm telling you that's where we're living right now he's speaking what's in that book through this message you need to have your ears open to hear it how exciting it is when we hear who we are in our inheritance it will establish every family every marriage how many Ray J said I

morning what can we say Lord except we love you we love you our lamb Christ break down every barrier Lord make a breach for our lives make a breach in the barrier that we come and we can finally start
