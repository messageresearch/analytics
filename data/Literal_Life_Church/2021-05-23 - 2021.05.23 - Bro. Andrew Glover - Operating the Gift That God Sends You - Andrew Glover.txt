TRANSCRIPT
========================================
we'll go to the book of malachi the fourth chapter the book of malachi the fourth chapter and while you're turning there we want to greet you this morning in the name of the lord we shall count it in honor and the privilege to be here with you all once again and sure appreciate brother paul sister rebecca and the family and the church here the stand for the message and i i tell you it's uh the lord has sure blessed you all here in a beautiful building a beautiful place of worship and i just thank the lord to see what he's done i often remember coming up this way several years ago we visited here my family and i met well several years ago probably 10 11 12 years ago and you all were still in the building i believe maybe two buildings ago and to see what god has done here and bless this church with and i tell you the reason you have what you have is to stand for this message and i i want to say god bless you all we thank you for standing for the word and for the truth and sure want to say appreciate brother josiah mcclearney was up yesterday for the wedding and he offered to drive us up here and he was ministering the deacon from our church there back home so we appreciate him coming and we thank the lord for that and we want to look here in the book of malachi the fourth chapter and in the in the fifth verse i know as message believers we're all familiar with this verse but i just want to pull something out of here the bible says behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse now i know a lot of people read malachi 4 5 and 6 and a lot of times the only thing they see in there is elijah the prophet but there's actually three different parts being fulfilled here it says i which is god will send you which is the bride of jesus christ elijah the prophet which we believe to be none other than that a man sent from god named william branham but i want you to notice here he actually says i will send you so it's not something you're going to find you're not going to make this man you're not going to make this prophet but god is going to send it so in other words he's going to send you a gift now in the book of ephesians the fourth chapter i want to look there maybe just to pull a few more scriptures here ephesians 4 and verse number 8. this is a very familiar scripture in ephesians 4 and verse number 8 paul here writing to the ephesians says wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive now that he ascended what is it but he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth now he that descended is the same so that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things notice here what he did he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slave of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and all love and love may grow up into him and do all things which is the head even christ now i i love verse 16 from whom the whole body fitly joined together so this is not going to be a divided body but it's going to be a body joined together compacted by that which every joint supply according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase in the body unto the edifying of itself in love you believe the word this morning we ask the lord to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you may have your seats here for just a few moments from those scriptures today if the lord would help me i'd like to speak to you if i would title this i want to talk to you for a few moments here on operating the gift that god sends you operating the gift that god sends you and maybe just to thank you maybe just to uh to pull up a a thought out of that maybe just speak to you on the power of your pull the power of your pull operating the gift that god sent you i look here at the definition or the meaning of the word operate it means of a person to control the functioning of a machine a meant a process or a system so actually when you're operating something you're actually controlling it or you're you're moving it you're pulling on it you're causing it amen to move in a certain direction now and in the message glorified jesus the prophet of god introduces to us the term the operation of the holy spirit he says now may those without the holy spirit be born again tonight with the holy spirit he said i pray father that all the sick and the afflicted every ones will be healed this night he said get glory out of the service for we commit ourselves amen to thee for the operation of the holy spirit in jesus name how many this morning could say in this service i'm committing myself to you lord amen for the operation of the holy spirit in jesus name another place he says god in his mercy amen through the operation of the holy spirit reveals amen spiritual truth the word itself so amen the holy ghost comes down into the church it's not the it's not the preacher revealing the word he meant but it's the holy ghost himself coming down in the church he meant revealing the word which is the spiritual truth he said another place the holy spirit he meant was up on the church at pentecost and it came right down through that age right on down to the age to the lutheran and the baptist and the methodist on down he meant until in this age here it's still the same holy spirit so he meant that there are no two holy ghosts right there's no two uh there's no two lords there's no two holy ghosts there's no two gospels there's no two bibles amen there is one lord there is one god there is one faith there is one holy ghost amen and it's the same holy spirit that is here in the church this morning amen that was there on the day of pentecost he said then when people's faith gets to a place he said then they'll get the blessings amen to realize it's theirs he meant the same operation of the holy spirit will be operating in the church like it did back there amen just the same so when you when you begin to read the bible you hear about women like mary he meant you hear about women like hannah in the temple all different people in the bible amen that they heard that god could do something they they heard that god had the ability to heal or he had the ability to give child aim into a parent womb he meant they heard about all these things he meant but they didn't know if he could do it for them but then there come a time amen that their faith raised to a level that they was able to claim amen it's not just for the preacher amen it's not just for the priest but it's for me amen see them the purpose in these services is not amen just to come together three times a week or amen to sing a few songs but the purpose in these meetings amen is to preach the word until your faith comes to a level you realize amen it's not just for brother branham and it's not just for brother paul and it's not just for the evangelist amen but god has got something for me amen god has got a blessing for me god amen has got a healing for me all things are still possible amen to them that believe now amen i just want to say it like this the prophet of god will preach a message called amen things that are to be and in that message he says now fake if god in his mercy has the mother he meant before the little baby is born i don't know if you can give me anything on this floor but i'd appreciate it amen this little baby is born it's craving for some vitamin and the mother's word speaks forth he meant dad i want cantaloupe or watermelon i want something another why he'll do everything he can to get that he meant because he wants his child amen to be born as perfect as it can be now think about this he meant a mother carrying a child amen that that sounds good thank you he meant a mother carrying a child he meant wakes up in the middle of the night and she says dad i want cantaloupe or i won't watermelon hey miller maybe she wants a pickle or she wants a hamburger hey now here's the thing amen you've got to get up and you've got to go get it you got to go to the store you got to go to mcdonald's hey you got to go somewhere and get something to satisfy he meant the need you're not a creator you can't just say watermelon be here amen cantaloupe be here amen so you actually got to go and find it you got to go get it he said but notice here amen if a natural father is like that then how much more able her amen is the heavenly father amen for he is a creator amen then this morning if there is a need in your life desiring something from god we don't have to go find it amen we don't have to go dig it up amen we don't have to go hope the store is still open where we can buy it amen but there's something in the house of god amen we can speak the word amen and creation power can come in the church amen and the very thing you have need of amen can be manifested right before you he said he is here he meant to prepare us he meant a body like his own glorious body if we want to live he said then there is something in us that calls a men to live and there is something in us that calls somebody say calls it calls us to do right he said then god will call somebody on the platform or the pulpit that will preach the absolute truth amen see it shows you if you are a real child of god then you begin to cry out amen god take it away from me amen circumcise me from this take these things away from me it's needed for your heavenly home you're going to amen he's gone to prepare because you've got to be a real word bride of christ now think about this if there's something in your heart amen that's calling out to god then god will call a preacher on the platform he meant to preach the absolute truth and when you hear that amen something will cry out lord have been taken away from me now we're living in the day and time where there's two spirits amen that are coming to maturity those two spirits actually begin in the book of genesis one of those spirits amen is the true spirit and the other one is the false spirit now we all know there is a truth to everything right amen and there is a false now now i know people say well amen there's a true five-fold ministry and there is a false faithful ministry and if that if that's really what you want to believe you're an american amen you're entitled to believe whatever you want to amen but let me just say this the problem i have is when people begin to try to identify amen what the true ministry is and what the false ministry is amen but let's not take my opinion or your opinion let's take what a prophet said he said seek the word paraphrasing amen identifies the characteristic of god amen so the characteristic of the true faithful ministry is what the bible says amen as they preach the word amen they preach the word they're instant in season and they're out of season they reprove they rebuke they exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine amen so the true five-fold ministry amen preaches the absolute truth now in the book of john 8 30 chapter 8 verse 31 it said then jesus said to those jews which believed on him if you continue in my word amen then are ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen see then what is the truth he meant the truth is the word right amen now the prophet of god says here and i'm just laying the foundation he says now the other vision was contrary to the bible amen bankers was with the bible and god has got to keep his word do you get it he said now what happened to ahab he was killed that day and the dogs licked his blood as the sun went down out of the chair at the pool where they washed in the night that's true he said for one man who took god's word his vision lined up with god's word and it was perfect it was the absolute truth he said a vision must line up with god's word amen and a preacher amen must line up with god's word no matter what we think what we are the conditions of the country the crowd whatever it is amen we must line up amen with god's word so amen amen a preacher can't be half-hearted he meant a preacher can't have his own ideas and his own objectives and his own agendas he meant a preacher has got to line up with god's word he meant because he has got to bring the church in line with the same word now the prophet says like this he said those pharisees believed in many things and they believed it to be the truth he said they said we are god's children now watch this and they were until somebody say they were until they were until the word was preached and when the word was preached and vindicated then they become sinners amen for rejecting the thing that they know was right and they witnessed that they said we know that our teacher come from god and no man can do the things you do amen without god being in you now think about this amen they were the children of god until the word was preached and the attitude they took he meant towards the preached word which was vindicated and witnessed by god amen it changed them amen from being children into being sinners he meant by rejecting the word preached he meant if somebody can hear the word and can reject the word and can change the condition of their life amen then what can happen to somebody amen that hears the word but they don't reject the word amen they receive the word they accept the word they believe the word i'll tell you what it'll do it'll change you from depression amen to joy it'll it'll change you from sickness into health it'll change you from doubt into faith amen the word preached has still got the power to change the church now now let me just say this amen god has still got preachers he's still got preachers and they're not sissified preachers well that's a quote he said we just asked the ministers now i want you to hear this i'm just laying the foundation if that's okay he said i want you to hear this he said is there any ministers here that's in the building tonight that believes this message i preached he said these creeds and man-made doctrines today is not of god but they are of man he said and we really ought to go back to the bible way go back to the beginning i want some of those ministers amen to walk forward and stand here with me while we lay hands and pray for these people here he said on these on these people seeking for god's great blessing on their life he said some of you ministers if you will that believes this to be the vital truth he said don't come no other way see amen be a man who believes it to be the absolute truth amen now now that that is a that is a very powerful quote to me when a prophet says amen be a man and i i looked up what is that what does the definition of that phrase be a man me it means to put up with something amen or take responsibility for it he meant to deal with something amen such as pain or misfortune he meant without complaining so amen god is looking for preachers amen who will be men with this message amen god is looking for preachers who will stand toe to toe with the devil and will declare that god's word is still supreme above everything else amen he's looking for people who will take responsibility in the message a man running from the presence of the lord he said when you see this then in this day now when the word of god has made these promises of these things that we see happening now then we've got the responsibility he meant to either face up to it or get away from it you just can't stay neutral you've got to do something about it he meant something has got to be made a decision you cannot come in that church door and go out the same person you came in you're either going to leave better amen or worse you're going to leave further away amen are closer to god he said and how people amen shirt the responsibility amen now let me just preach to you for a second amen because i think if we really got a revelation of what a prophet is saying it would change the way we act in church amen it would be more than just coming and sitting on the pew and watching the preacher and saying well we're just here for a little intellectual gathering amen i think it would put a fire amen in more than the pulpit it would put a fire in the pews you say what are you saying i'm saying these services are not just religious gatherings amen these sermons amen are not just things that your pastor amen or these preachers have studied and put together amen to show you that they can build a fault amen these are directions amen coming from god amen to change your life now now will you sleep with andrew i i really don't think it matters that much i don't think it really matters how much i put in the service i don't think it really matters how much i give you know i see the song leader up there and he says come on and help me sing but you know what i just i just don't think it matters now it may get bumpy here for a second but that'll be okay we'll get through it okay hey no i just don't think i need to clap my hands and i just don't think i need to raise my you know i think brother paul needs to do all the hard and i think the songwriter needs to do all the amen and all the worship amen what devil have you let get on you ain't been to convince you that this is not a house of worship amen this is not a showmanship this is not a this is not a one-man show amen this is a house of god amen where believers come together in the unity of the faith in the spirit of jesus christ he meant not to lift up a man he meant not to lift up an idea amen but to lift up the king of kings i tell you what amen if you demand the pulpit to put forth some effort amen don't you think it's time to use amen put forth some effort if you demand the preacher amen to sacrifice and give and give and give amen don't you think it's time you sacrifice amen and give a little bit amen if you demand the song leader amen to consecrate himself and find the mind of god amen let's get time and i'll preach right through it amen if you demand the song leader amen to get consecrated and define the mind of god for the song service amen then why can't you turn your phone off amen 30 minutes before service amen get before the lord amen get consecrated yourself amen you want to see a difference in the services it ain't going to be a new choir song it ain't going to be a new musician it ain't going to be a new building it'll be when believers amen can lay aside their own ideas and their own thoughts about what they think church ought to be and take what the bible says church ought to be and the bible said i would that all men would come together and would lift up holy hands and would give praises unto god listen friends amen this is not a social hall this is the house of god amen where the spirit of god will lead a man behind the pulpit amen to preach the very secrets of your heart now it amazes me that we it is it's okay it amazes me amen that we've let we've let the devil come in and totally change what the house of god is you know even some people now if you preach on hell they get mad if you preach on holiness they blow up like a bullfrog eating buckshot amen if you preach on sin amen they get all tore up amen if you preach a little message on gossip they get all wadded up hey man if you preach on backbone and bitterness he'll get all mad at you amen brother paul you get close to their personal life amen well they're going to go find another church amen but let me remind you amen the bible has not changed what the word says that the house of god is still a house of correction well hello somebody amen the house of god is still a house of correction i believe in positivity i believe in preaching faith i believe in shouting i believe in rejoicing amen but if we ever back off amen of keeping the house of god amen clean and decent and in order we have backing off of the commission that god give the church amen preach the gospel amen i'll say this thank god for men of god who have not shirked the responsibility amen thank god for pastors that has not shirked their responsibility amen now amen i'm not preacher for a second amen because the devil wants to shut the pastures up he meant because if he can shut the pastures up and then there'll be no voice amen crying out against sin and ungodliness and unclean living in the house of god if he can set the pastor up there'll be no voice amen in the watchtower amen screaming about the enemy that is coming amen but i say god amen give our pastors the voices of angels amen give them the strength amen give them the courage amen give them the nerve and then give them the courage and boldness amen to stand and to declare god's word if it hurts our feelings if it hurts our families feelings if it hurts our pride how many will say i'm not here ain't meant to have my ego stroke and to be told how good i am i am here for one purpose and that is god you cut away and circumcise amen everything from my heart and is unlike you until the holy ghost amen can claim my vessel i can be more than a church member i can be more than a pew sitter i can be a messiah ant sir amen god give us preachers amen that will preach the word amen now let me say this god amen has sinned us some wonderful things amen i am thankful amen for everything god has sent us can i say it like this we ought to be faithful amen for what god has sent amen what god is sending and what god will continue to sin what are you saying i'll say this i am thankful for god anybody can i get a witness here anybody else thankful for god i am thankful for god i am thankful for the message i'm thankful for the messenger but you know what i am thankful amen for faithful preachers amen who are under the final messenger and they are boldly preaching the message i'm thankful for god i'm thankful for the messenger i'm thankful for the message he sent us amen but i am thankful that god has still got a voice in the land today now when you begin to realize this you'll see amen that every service amen is a service you ought to be thankful for every service is another space amen in time that god has allowed us to have now the bible says in revelation 2 21 i gave her space amen to repent of her fornication and she repented not now that word space there it means time it means season it means a while it means often times it's either time long or short amen so every service amen is is another space amen if there's not something right to make it right every service is another space if the devil has brought something in your life that you know shouldn't be there amen it's another space to get rid of it amen amen now this this may be a little bit different but i'm just preaching what the lord put on my heart okay amen it used to be amen when people heard the preacher preach about sin and ungodliness if a preacher ever hit television one time he mean it used to be people couldn't wait to get home and kick the thing out of the house amen you know the devil's turned the tide he mean you let the pastor strike something and instead of getting mad at the devil they get mad at the preacher well hello somebody instead of getting mad at the devil they get mad at the preacher preaching but you ought to be rejoicing amen that god give you another space amen to hear the truth and give you another opportunity amen to be released from the thing the devil's trying to hang over your head now the prophet of god said do you know that this church speaking of this church was more wicked than they have do you know that she that he repented for a while and he walked softly before god he said you cannot say that about this catholic church she never repented but she has stubbornly destroyed any and all who tried to help her repent that is history now god kept raising up not only messengers to each age but he raised up some wonderful helps amen of those messengers he gave every age some wonderful men of god and they did everything they could a meant to bring the church back to god amen god certainly gave her opportunity and he gave her help to repent amen do you realize that the pastor amen is not just here for a job amen he's not just here amen to visit you in the hospital amen and to see it as you walk across the graduation stage amen but he is here and let me just take some liberty and say a pastor's word amen should not be subject to a psychologist's word a pastor's word for your family amen should not be subject to what some doctor thinks amen if god gives you a holy ghost-filled pastor and i believe he did you ought to raise his word above the words of a school teacher above the words of a psychologist amen because his words are not coming from a school amen his words is coming from the inspiration of the holy ghost amen he give another space he meant another opportunity to repent now watch this amen but did she repent by her fruits no sir she never has she never will she has lost her senses in spiritual things do you realize every time that you turn down another space to repent is another desensitizing amen to the spiritual side of your life remember the problem god talked about the young girl and he said young girl tonight you're not amen to give your heart to the lord he said she laughed and she walked out he said two years from then i saw her and she had a she had a look on her face he said and i asked her don't i know you and she said yeah preach you do she said won't you come up to my room and let me give you a drink and let me give you some hey let me let me let me entertain you he said how dare you amen offer a man of god such as that she said do you remember that meeting that night he said yes sir yes ma'am i do she said do you remember when you called me out he said how can i forget she said if you ever made it right you made it right that night she said and ever since that time he meant i laughed and walked away and i could see my mother's soul he meant fry in hell like a pancake and i would laugh at it what did he say he said she crossed the line he meant between repentance amen in the judgment of god she crossed the line between the mercy of god and the judgment of god he meant she send her day away to repent oh church amen i don't know what i'm bouncing against right now but it's a spirit amen i'm going to bounce against it amen how much longer are you going to carry amen that unforgiveness in your hearts how much longer are you going to carry that bitterness amen well somebody hurt me and somebody amen this is the season amen this is the time amen this is the hour amen to get rid of everything in our lives that is unlike god and let the holy ghost fall through us amen this is the time to repent now now i know people don't like repenting services anymore amen but they're still in the bible amen amen the prophet god said this heal at this age is to cry what i am wrong amen that's a hard thing to say in the world that says everybody's right amen but it's still in the message amen somebody's wrong and somebody's right and can i say what i believe i believe everything is wrong and the message is right amen i believe every preacher amen ever ever psychologist ever ever theologian ever ever seminary professor every one of them is wrong and william branham's message is right because it's not coming from the devil it's coming from god now when you begin to realize amen that this is more than a service this is more than a few songs this is more than putting some money in the offering plate amen this is more than just hearing a sermon but this is a place where lives can be changed amen we're souls amen can be free from the bondages of sin that it'll change your attitude towards the way you come to church hello can i tell you what the bible says amen the bible says the voice of joy and the voice of gladness and the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride and the voice of them shall say praise the lord of hosts amen for the lord is good for his mercy endureth forever and of them that shall bring amen the sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord amen so when you come in the house of god you should not bring the sacrifice amen of unbelief and the sacrifice of negativity but you should bring the sacrifice of praise into the house now i think it's amazing how that in the bible you'll see there were three magis and the bible says when they come to the lord amen they brought gifts and the prophet comes along and he says what gifts do they bring he said they brought gold they brought frankincense and they brought myrrh he said see what they did was they brought to him what they thought of him he said what it was was gold was deity amen frankincense came it was service and myrrh was death he said so they come to him realizing he was deity in service to die amen now watch this amen and i say today the things we bring to him identifies our thoughts is about him you understand if you believe it with all of your heart every word of god you'll identify it amen by giving all that you have to it but if you don't believe it if you believe it's just a good place to associate with better people around church and things like that that's just about what you'll give he said just a few social hours with some of the congregation but if you really believe it with all of your heart then you get everything that's in you amen to it see and it identifies that you truly believe the message you believe it to be the truth if you really believe amen that this message is the truth if you really believe that the holy ghost amen is still in the church if you really believe in signs and wonders and mighty manifestation amen do you realize if an unbeliever come in here if you really believed it they wouldn't even have to ask you gideon what you believe he meant by your action in the house of god it will testify what you really believe amen brother paul's up here preaching his heart out and you're sleeping it shows amen you've not given your all to this service amen that brother paul is laboring in the word and you've got a frown on your face and you're mad amen it shows that you're not identifying yourself amen with the word that's being preached amen but you're looking at one preacher right here that still believes amen i want the world to know i want hell to know i want the angels to know i want the demons to know i want everybody around me to know when i hear the word i identify myself with the word i am hearing [Applause] hey you know what the bible said in nehemiah the bible says when ezra stood up and read the scroll amen the whole congregation said well we forgot that word amen amen think about that ezra read the word and the whole church said amen you know why because they wanted every onlooker to see i identify with what's being said i believe what's being said amen i'll say this amen we need to get our amen back in the house of god amen we need to get the ability amen to back the word back in the house of god hey hey can i preach to you for a second amen if the preacher says amen this message is right every believer that believes it ought to put a wholehearted amen behind it if the preacher says amen that ungodliness is still wrong every holy ghost clean living individual in the church ought to put their whole heart behind it because god has sent a gift to you he meant to manifest his life in you and to bring you to a place of edification and perfection amen see satan does not want this message preached he hates this message being preached and there is a reason why he does not want this message preached there is a reason why he don't want you to hear it or there's another reason he don't want you to pull on the gift that's preaching it amen now let me just let you in a little secret you're operating this service this morning you may not even realize that but you're operating this service this morning do you realize hey man there's a sound booth back there that sound board is not operating itself there is an operator to the sound booth there's a camera back there in the corner that camera's not moving itself amen there's an operator amen that's that that's controlling amen the function of it amen these these instruments amen they're instruments amen but there's a musician which is an operator amen that begins to strike a key and he begins to bring life he begins to bring music are you hearing me amen that's the same way it is in the house of god amen there is a gift in the life of the man of god behind the pulpits but that gift is not there for him it's not there to be a career it's not there to be notified as some important man that gift was placed there by the almighty god amen for his word born pride upon the earth amen to come to a place amen of manifestation to a place of perfection amen by pulling or by operating that gift amen you realize why the devil don't want you to pull amen because your faith amen will pull this service into another level amen he don't want you to pull amen because your faith amen will pull the word amen right out of the preacher your faith amen will draw out the supernatural [Music] the prophet said thou o god has come in the midst of the people and their faith has pulled out super natural words amen their faith has pulled out supernatural words explaining to them amen their life or what they have done what they must do and what will be amen one gift amen with a prophetic gift amen the prophet said the faith of the people amen is pulling out of me supernatural words amen think about this even think about one woman who stood before the prophet amen what did she say amen she said this she was carrying a complex she was carrying a scar and the prophet stood there and he said i see you as a child he was bit by a dog so he goes back to her past right he goes back to her past and he finds out what has been he comes to her present and says you're carrying a nervousness so he's come to what has been what what he is and he says but here i see you amen and you're happy and you're well and you're free amen what just happened brother gideon he just went to the past and brought the past to the present and he went to the future and brought the future to the present he just manifested even three different aspects of one individual's life amen the devil will do everything he can amen to hinder the service because he don't want you to hear the word that will set you free it's not the preacher that'll set you free it's not the singer that'll set you free it's the word it's the anointing it's the spirit of god it's the power of god in the church that will set you free listen i have been in meetings and i have seen services so tied amen that you can pick a banjo string in there but let somebody begin to pull let somebody begin to say amen let somebody stand up and say that ain't nothing but the truth preacher and i've seen the power of god and then dropping meetings until cold atmospheres amen melt away in the fire of god hold church i'm telling you what you've got the ability this morning amen to take these services from just being wednesday nights and sunday mornings he meant to be in holy ghost outpourings upper room experience are you hearing me amen can we just try it for a minute amen hey amen amen you have to start real out just start somewhere amen that's the truth hallelujah amen amen you feel better now you know what you're doing you're bumping against devils them devils right now they're bumping against you they're bumping against you with sleepiness they're bumping against you with ideas and condemnation and guilt and all kinds of things amen they're bumping against you brother they're telling you this service ain't for you brother paul them demons bump against you all week long and say you ain't got nothing to say they bump against you and they bump against you amen but this is our time to bump back come on church this is our time to push back this service this morning is your opportunity young man amen to push against every devil every spirit and an eye that's been pushing against you all week this here is your space it is your opportunity it is your time to say devil you've pissed and you pissed and you've encroached and you've encroached but today there is a fire in the house of god and i'm not sailing amen for just another service i'm not settling ain't then for just another song i'm not settling aiming for just another meeting i want to break out of this old realm i want to break out of this formalism i want to break into the place where holly rock stood i want to break into the place where a prophet stood and he said george raise up off of that bed you say with andrew we're not prophets and we can't do it you're exactly right but we are gods [Music] we are manifested sons and daughters of god with a right are y'all hearing me i'm preaching to you with a right to break out into a realm where all things are possible the devil don't want you to hear this message he don't want you to pull because you know what you can have a question on your heart all week long i'm gonna make it real simple okay you can have a question on your on your heart all week long is this message for me and the preacher can get behind the pulpit and he can begin to preach on the seventh seal or preach on daniel 70 weeks or something and you've been carrying this question all week long now you know what you can do you can hear his text and say well this service ain't for me i don't need nothing out of the seventh seal i don't need nothing out of daniel 70 weeks i don't or you can say god you know what you're up to and you know what you can do that preacher can be a thousand miles on the other side of every fault you're having but if you begin to pull on god and you begin to say lord i need an answer amen lord i need a word amen lord i need a breakthrough amen lord i need to hear an answer to this question is this message for me amen i've been fellowshipping with you all week long lord i haven't talked to brother paul i haven't talked to the preacher they don't know the questions and the thoughts it's up on my heart but you do lord and i need to hear something from you and you know what you begin to pull on god you begin to pull on god you know what you can do you can get a hold of the man that's putting the words in the preacher's mouth [Applause] you can get a hold of the man that has put the words in the preacher's mouth and i have seen god amen change the direction of an entire service amen to answer one question now let me just say this if the devil can put you to sleep you'll never get your answer if he can put your mind somewhere else you'll never get your answer but if you'll begin to push through if you'll begin to break through if you'll begin to say god i'm not backing up i'm not giving in i'm not quitting i'm not turning around i come here for a conference with you and you're still god amen you can still put the answer to my question in the mouth of your servant well brother andrew we really don't have much power let me say this there is a hidden power in this message the prophet said amen there's no power and steeples there's no power and pretty pews and there's no power in best stress crowds he said but it takes a hidden power of the spirit of god amen to break the toehold he meant that word in there to break the hold so it's not the personality of the preacher that'll break the toehold it's not the it's not the fanciness of how he says his words that'll break the toehold it's the word glory it's the word being preached that will break the stronghold remember told the story about the lawyer that time who went in the courtroom and he stood there and he cried and he boo-hooed and he hollered and the promise said when he got done he said the judge looked at him and said is that all you got he said well i did what i did what somebody else did he said sir it takes more than just all the emotions he meant to to win the case he said there's got to be some law in there now i know people love to take that quote and say well away with emotions and i say away with that nonsense too what do you saying away with the nonsense of saying we don't need emotion in the house of god anything without emotion is dead come on church anything without emotion is there amen brother paul they want they want dead song services they want dead musicians amen but you know what i don't like going to a church service amen and singing songs that makes me think i'm in a funeral home and i like some music that's got some beat to it i like some music that's got some feeling in it come on church amen let me just let you in a little secret if you don't enjoy what you're doing don't worry you won't be doing it long if you don't enjoy serving god don't worry because nobody will continue doing something that they don't enjoy doing but if you enjoy it something has gripped you you know what brother paul can i put my voice on record with your voice i enjoy holy ghost singing i enjoy music it's got some feeling in it amen this is not a house of mourning this is a house of worship this is a place where there ought to be a free spirit where there ought to be a free yield to let the spirit of god have been to move in the freedom and the authority of the holy ghost i believe in emotion but there's got to be some word in there and the prophet said see it takes the word to break the stronghold of the devil amen do you realize what pentecost did amen pentecost even give 120 cowards the boldness to stand up hey go ahead well can i just tell you what the prophet said he said they went up there a bunch of cowards he said but brother after he went up to pentecost speaking of peter he had a courage to put on the whole armor of god he said now watch what is it the word that he had walked with was in him burning him up with fire in his flesh and soul he had the whole armor of god on what is it god makes himself ever present in his own army he is with us he is in us that's the armor he is the word he is the holy spirit and the holy spirit is in us which is the word making the promise manifest for the spirit quickens the word he said what happened he said david met goliath and he picked up five stones and a slingshot and here he comes because something is fixing to happen because there's the word let's say this together the word the promise and the power david had the word the promise and the power and notice this to sling it that's what we need today is a man that will take god's word with the power of the holy ghost behind him he meant to press it out there and to watch it come to pass are you hear me god is looking for some men today that's got the courage amen to sling the word out there and to press and to press and to press until it comes to pass now brother paul any of you preachers here know that sometimes you preach and it feels like you're preaching against the wall ever been there it feels like you're literally amen pushing against the wall it feels like you're the only one that's doing anything to push but you know what you don't do you don't close your bible and say well we'll try again sunday or we'll try again next week you stand there and you keep on pushing and you keep on pushing and brother as you keep on pressing and you keep on pressing because you know if i just keep pressing before long that wall will come down amen you know how you can stand there and say that because i've seen it happen before hell is it the truth the word will still defeat the devil anywhere anytime under any condition he said see just throw it out there and keep on pressing and it'll come to pass his word of fire his army dressed with the ever present of himself amen so god has got preachers that are preaching the word the promise and the power amen they're preaching the word they're preaching the promise and they're preaching the power and those three together is causing devils to fall causing the walls to come down are you hearing me are you with me this morning see you've got you've got to keep on pressing because the word will still bring the enemy down that's why the devil don't want the word preached can i give you a testimony the devil don't want the word preached because it's through the preaching of the word that demons are cast out i was preaching in a meeting not long ago and while i was preaching amen the holy ghost just come to my heart so strong and said deal with the spirit and i begin to deal with a spirit of lust and a spirit of pornography how it'll come in a home how it will destroy a marriage how it will destroy a teenager how it'll kind of help put your mind in prison amen brother i didn't know why i was going that way amen but about that time there was a brother in the back he jumped up and he threw his arm out like that and he said i'm free are you awake this morning that might have not meant to nobody else around him but that was an answer you know what he did he called me he said andrew i've been battling those two spirits amen for months and the devil never said i would get free and he said so i had accepted just to live with it and try to control it he said but when the holy ghost spoke out of you and said you don't have to live with that death when you was called to defeat it he said that was my answer he said i got my breakthrough oh church he's still god this morning his word is still true this morning he is spoiled shady i if you need an answer amen push through come on woman with the issue of blood they don't want you to get to jesus but you know i've got to get to jesus if i don't get to jesus i'm going to die oh church of the living god when you get desperate enough to get to jesus you'll shake off formalism you'll shake off ideas you'll forget your recipes you'll forget your pride because you know if i don't get to jesus amen i'm going to be pale the rest of my life but if i ever get this presence come on church amen if i ever get this presents you know what sometimes you got to do you got to press through but when you get there that's all that matters sometimes you got to press through to leave that song service because there's people in there that need a victory there's people in there that need a lifting in their spirit and the devil don't want to get it so you know what he'll do he'll put bars and bars and bars and bars amen the gideon i'll tell you this keep on singing because before long the witness of heaven will open up brother paul there'll be times that look like nothing's happening but can i give you something this morning keep on preaching amen because before long the witness of heaven will open oh come on church there'll be services you don't feel like saying amen but keep on saying it amen keep on blowing keep on pulling keep on pressing keep on pushing keep on believing keep on worshiping keep on praising and before long you'll step out of that realm into an untapped resource where all things are possible there's unlimited revival [Applause] oh somebody giving some praise somebody give him some worship i'm talking about a church that believes god is still god and his word is still true and his power is still here and his spirit is still manifesting itself amen god is still sending preachers and services to give the people another space now when you realize this sometimes it's not going to be easy to get there sometimes you're gonna have to draw your sword and stand toe-to-toe with the devil and say i'm not leaving here till i get a blessing i'm preaching to you this morning 50 60 years the prophet's been off the scene the message is around the world and it's harder to get to church now than it's ever been before is that a coincidence all right well over here we might as well preach harder now to get the service than it ever was before all right over there i raised my hands i'd shout amen but i might spread covet oh brother andrew i'll tell you what i'd sing a special but the person sung before me had the microphone they might have cold well i'm cutting now you know what for that i'll tell you what he meant i'd come to church but but you know what i i i just i just i just need to stay home it's the devil doing that it's a spirit of fear to bind the church here's my question how long are you going to lay down to it how many more services are you going to let the devil rob you of getting a blessing because of the fear remember that and i tell you what i i'd go shake the preacher's hand and i'd go fellowship with my brothers and sisters but i'm afraid it's the devil trying to bind you amen from enjoying what god has sent you now let me just say this he a father leaves his son an inheritance right do you realize no other father has a right to tell that child what to do with his inheritance if brother paul amen leaves gideon an inheritance amen brother ken you don't have a right to come tell gideon what he can do with this inheritance are you following me because it's not his position to say you can't do this and you can't do that his father left him in heritage if brother paul left getting the corvette and said you can go the speedway and drive at 80 miles an hour even brother kenny's got no right to say gideon you can't drive at 80 miles an hour amen because the father left it in the inheritance he left it in the wheel and he sent the inheritance to the sun amen what are you saying preacher i'm saying the devil has no right he meant to tell the church of the living god what we can do with the inheritance that our father died for us to have do you realize our father died that we could preach the gospel our father died that we could lay hands on the sick and they could recover our father died that we could speak in tongues we could see visions we could prophesy we could sing songs we could have the joy and the gladness and the church our father died and he put it in the wheel and he sent a gift to interpret the will to us and the devil has no business telling the church what they can do with the inheritance god left her now let me just say this even christ has left the church some wonderful gifts but you realize the greatest gift he gave was himself can i have a few more minutes john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave somebody say he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life the prophet said jesus was the greatest gift god ever give the earth the world amen now people have faith in it see there's the key the people have faith in it because god's gifts are always looked down by the modern religious world amen you can have all the gifts of the world you can have all the gifts of the word but unless you have faith in that gift it'll never operate let me just go through the scriptures here and can i are you awake can i can i read you some things that your father sent you can i read you some gifts he sent you this he said i will give you rest in matthew 11. in matthew 16 he said i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven in luke 10 he said i give unto you power amen to tread upon serpents and scorpions in john 14 he said the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well springing up into everlasting life in john 6 51 he said the bread that i will give is my flesh which i give for the life of the world in john 10 28 he said i give unto them eternal life in john 14 27 he said my peace i give unto you in revelation 2 22 to him will i give power over the nations amen in revelation 2 28 and i will give him the morning star these gifts are to be manifested [Applause] these gifts are to be manifested in a people listen church we do not have to take a substitute when the word is full of the original promises amen brother andrew i need some peace so i'm having to take a nerve pill let me tell you what your father gave you your father said i'll give you my own peace brother andrew i need some rest so i'm having to take a sleeping pill can i tell you what your father said i will give you rest for the andrew the devil is walking through my home and destroying my children and destroying the teenagers can i tell you what i need to do i need to go get a 10-step program and get control of my home knowing what you need to do is you need to exercise amen the authority of what your father gave you he said i will give you power brother paul if he'll give us power he meant to walk on scorpions and to tread on serpents then i think he can give us power aiming to go in our homes and say devil you gotta find another place to live amen you ain't living here you ain't living in this house oh is there any faith amen building in the house of god this morning is there anybody wanting to say therefore you've been walking on me long enough you've been pressing me down long enough but my father died that i could have liberty he died that i could have joy [Applause] are y'all hearing me this morning he gave you these things you didn't earn them he give them to you why not use them [Music] why not operate why i sit in the house of god sad when he said i will give you joy brother paul i want the holy ghost i want the holy ghost i said the prayer line the other day now louisiana brother joe adams where's there and this young man come up for prayer and he said brother he said brothers i want the holy ghost if anybody up here knows joe

took the cell phone out of joe's hand and brother joe said that's as easy as it is to get the holy ghost oh come on church he said he said i give it to you you know what you've been doing you've been praying for it you've been begging for it you've been trying to work it up and work it down but his word said amen i get it to you hey church is there anybody this morning that says father i hear what
