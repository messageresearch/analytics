[4:09] even though we're not of this world even
[4:12] though we're not here
[4:14] [Music]
[4:31] showed away
[4:36] Divine love beareth all things believeth
[4:39] all things
[4:40] hope with all things
[4:42] endureth all things read it again Divine
[4:46] love bearth all things believeth all
[4:48] things hope with all things endureth all
[4:53] things I want to add a couple scriptures
[4:55] to that in First Corinthians chapter 15
[4:57] if you don't mind First Corinthians 15
[4:59] and verse 57 but thanks be to God which
[5:04] giveth us the victory through our Lord
[5:07] Jesus Christ are you glad tonight that
[5:10] he gives you the victory
[5:11] in the battles of the Lord if he fights
[5:13] our battles there's always a victory
[5:15] amen and then it says in second
[5:17] Corinthians chapter 2 a similar thing
[5:19] that we want to add second Corinthians
[5:21] chapter 2 and verse 14. now thanks be
[5:24] unto God which always causes us to
[5:28] Triumph in Christ and maketh manifest
[5:31] the savior of his knowledge By Us in
[5:34] every place the first part of it says we
[5:36] thank God which always causeth us to
[5:40] Triumph in Christ
[5:42] always the victories in mind always the
[5:46] Triumph is in mind doesn't matter how
[5:48] low it gets he causes us always to
[5:51] Triumph so he's got the victory in mind
[5:54] for our lives Divine love should not be
[5:56] looked at as anything that originates in
[6:00] human at all no human being can produce
[6:02] this on his own this isn't just being
[6:05] good to people if you're being good to
[6:07] people that's a good thing but this love
[6:09] this Capstone love this Divine love this
[6:12] perfect love can only be in one it can
[6:16] only originate in one place and that's
[6:18] our Lord he is love he's the substance
[6:20] of love Christ is the substance of love
[6:23] and so if you didn't receive the right
[6:25] kind of love in your life there's a
[6:27] person who can give it to you and
[6:29] besides that if it comes and lives in
[6:31] you then you can project this love to
[6:33] other people and so when we look at we
[6:36] want to know the point that this love is
[6:39] not a human love in the beginning of
[6:42] time it's amazing that in the first two
[6:44] or three scriptures of the Bible we can
[6:46] have the key actually to all the chaos
[6:49] that's in the world today because in the
[6:51] second verse of the Bible you go back
[6:53] and read it if you got your Bible you
[6:54] can go back and read it sometime we
[6:56] already have the answer when the whole
[6:58] world was without form and void and
[7:00] empty and chaos and so there was nothing
[7:03] to fix that uh there was nothing to make
[7:06] that right can you say Amen there was no
[7:09] source of itself that could redeem the
[7:12] chaos that was in the answer I think
[7:15] it's in verse three and the spirit of
[7:17] the Lord moved upon that chaos the
[7:20] spirit of the Lord moved upon the waters
[7:23] and then light it said let there be
[7:26] light and then Light Came where'd the
[7:28] light come from it came from God
[7:30] so when he the spirit moved on this
[7:33] that's when chaos turned to an Eden
[7:37] it's when the spirit of the Lord moves
[7:39] on your life and you respond
[7:41] is when your chaos turns to an Eden can
[7:45] I get an amen tonight
[7:46] it's when the spirit of the lord it's
[7:48] not when it's not within yourself it's
[7:51] not something you can produce within
[7:52] yourself if you're in chaos you can't
[7:55] change the chaos
[7:56] you can't just have a psychological
[7:58] thing and change and people can get
[8:00] pretty strong in their minds but when
[8:01] there's that type of chaos and the type
[8:04] of chaos that's in the world there has
[8:06] to be something come from another source
[8:08] and that's where it came from the spirit
[8:10] of the Lord moved upon the face of the
[8:13] waters and that everything begin to
[8:15] change and became at Eden he can do the
[8:18] same thing to your life so when we look
[8:20] at this love we have to see it is that
[8:21] it's not from Human effort the answer is
[8:25] is it doesn't the answer doesn't come
[8:27] from an outside thing of human effort in
[8:29] any form this love will only come from
[8:33] the person of Love Christ and he will be
[8:35] the only source of it and so then when
[8:38] you have that buy a new birth when you
[8:40] have his love within you the next step
[8:43] is getting past the Flesh and the mind
[8:47] and the clouds and all that be moved
[8:50] away and with all that and that's why
[8:52] Paul said be transformed by the renewing
[8:55] of your mind this is someone who's
[8:57] already born again this is someone who
[8:59] already has the holy spirit in them and
[9:01] in the Holy Spirit is that love but see
[9:03] our minds are clouded by things so the
[9:06] next step in the Christian journey is
[9:09] now to be transformed by the continual
[9:12] renewing of our mind and that it gets
[9:14] all the cloudiness now all the past out
[9:17] all your past thinking out and when it
[9:19] keeps purging all of those things and
[9:21] washes it away guess what can happen the
[9:24] love of God is released out of you to
[9:27] other people what happened at Calvary
[9:29] what happened at Calvary you say well
[9:32] our Lord died there he he brought the
[9:34] sacrifice he he was the lamb that took
[9:37] care of our sins yeah we got all those
[9:39] explanations and that's exactly what
[9:41] happened but what happened at Calvary
[9:43] there was a death and guess what love
[9:46] was released
[9:48] to you
[9:50] can you say Amen what happened to
[9:53] Calvary the love of God was released
[9:56] the love of God came forth from Calvary
[9:58] and but it had to be released it was
[10:01] there but it had to be released and how
[10:03] was it released it was released look at
[10:05] this now through a death through a
[10:07] suffering through pain through the death
[10:10] of Christ and when we start dying to
[10:12] ourselves when we start dying to our own
[10:15] will when we stop fighting for our own
[10:18] will and learn how to respond to God
[10:20] then maybe the love of God can be
[10:22] released when he died at the cross it
[10:26] released the love of God to us when we
[10:28] can die to ourselves it releases more
[10:30] the love of God because we're asking
[10:32] Lord how can I have this excellent way
[10:35] how can I have more of this perfect love
[10:36] released in my life well through Calvary
[10:38] the love of God was released through a
[10:41] suffering
[10:42] through a death
[10:43] through a dying to himself and he died
[10:45] physically we die in our minds we die to
[10:48] our own will there is a death we go
[10:50] through or else our Lord would not have
[10:52] said take up your cross and follow me he
[10:55] didn't say take up his cross he he went
[10:58] to his cross but there's a cross you
[11:00] have to bear
[11:01] and so everyone has a cross and that's
[11:04] dying to our own will Jesus himself had
[11:06] to die to his own will he's prayed in
[11:08] the garden father not my will but thine
[11:10] be done there would have been no Calvary
[11:13] unless there had been a Garden of
[11:14] Gethsemane there have been no doubts at
[11:16] Calvary unless there had been in death
[11:18] to his will and he prayed in Gethsemane
[11:22] not my will but thine be done
[11:24] when people are confronted with a bad
[11:26] Spirit or a bad situation or or
[11:29] circumstance in life
[11:31] psychology says that we don't do one of
[11:34] the two things fight or flight we're
[11:36] taught we either human beings will fight
[11:39] all right I'm ready to fight back Oh
[11:41] They'll run
[11:42] did you know in this excellent way
[11:44] neither of those are are right
[11:48] that's psychology that's a human being
[11:50] that's what we do we're going to get our
[11:52] fist out or we're going to get our guns
[11:53] out we're going to fight for this fight
[11:55] for my own way or we're going to run and
[11:58] that's not always good either
[12:02] so we learn to fight for our own will we
[12:05] learn to fight for our way and sometimes
[12:07] you're confronted with that decision and
[12:09] I've been confronted with these things
[12:11] over and over again an embarrassing
[12:13] humbly thing thing in a decision do I
[12:16] eat Humble Pie do I take the more
[12:18] excellent way do I die to myself or do I
[12:21] respond like 99 of other human beings
[12:25] respond respond to confrontation and to
[12:28] evil
[12:29] and to be being done wrong that's the
[12:32] decision every believer will be faced
[12:34] with do I respond the normal response do
[12:37] I fight do I fight
[12:39] do I respond by could I say that a big a
[12:43] big majority of Christians respond the
[12:45] same carnal way
[12:48] or do I say Lord you've got a more
[12:50] excellent way and it's not fight or
[12:52] flight It's Your Love
[12:54] being released I want to make a
[12:56] reference to the word Christian
[12:58] first time I was mentioned in Acts 11 26
[13:01] they were first called Christians at
[13:03] Antioch and the writer Barry petite says
[13:07] the original Greek word for Christian is
[13:09] christianos which comes from the two
[13:11] Greek words Christ and shun the word
[13:14] Christ means anointed and Chun means
[13:16] little so the word Christian literally
[13:19] means little anointed ones so Christian
[13:22] does not mean like I used to think
[13:25] christ-like and we're following we're
[13:27] duplicating how Christ would treat
[13:29] people and we're putting that on we're
[13:31] not putting anything on Christian means
[13:34] a little anointed one and that means you
[13:36] have the same holy spirit that was in
[13:38] him in your life
[13:40] he goes on to say so the word Christian
[13:42] Legend means little anointed ones during
[13:45] his life Jesus was called Messiah which
[13:46] meant the anointing one and we heard his
[13:48] little anointed ones who have been
[13:50] anointed by his holy spirit to represent
[13:52] him in this world interestingly the word
[13:55] Christian is only found three times in
[13:56] the Bible however how do you know if you
[13:59] are truly a Christian I can say I I can
[14:02] say I'm in a car because I can't say I'm
[14:05] a car because I'm in a garage
[14:07] or uh if I'm surrounded by a chicken
[14:10] fence that doesn't mean I'm a chicken I
[14:12] believe being a Christian is more than
[14:14] just saying a few words but is rather a
[14:17] changed life and a new way of living
[14:20] life according to the scripture it's the
[14:23] life that's in Christ that has to be in
[14:25] you
[14:26] and thus Christian takes on a deeper
[14:28] meaning it's not just you join Church
[14:30] you signed a membership you shook the
[14:33] pastor's hand or you gave heavy in the
[14:35] plate that doesn't make you a Christian
[14:41] but it's having the Holy Ghost
[14:44] is what made them Christians and they
[14:46] said of the book of Acts Church they
[14:48] said they took note
[14:49] after they've seen certain signs take
[14:52] place in the Believers they took note
[14:53] they've been with Jesus now some of
[14:56] those disciples after the upper room
[14:58] there's just 3 000 Souls saved some of
[15:00] them worked physically with Christ but
[15:02] they took note the disciples had been
[15:04] with Jesus many others but some of them
[15:06] hadn't been physically with Jesus but
[15:08] they said they've been with Jesus why
[15:10] because his Same Spirit is in them
[15:12] they're doing the same works and didn't
[15:14] Jesus say that the works that I do shall
[15:18] you do also can I get an amen tonight he
[15:21] said the works that I do shall the
[15:22] Believers do also
[15:24] so it's not it's not us imitating Christ
[15:26] it's it's being Christ and thus that
[15:29] love is released to the people now that
[15:34] are the the confrontations the the the
[15:36] the the the the disappointments the
[15:39] people that have done you wrong the
[15:40] hatred in this world the persecution
[15:43] whether it's for you're a Christian or
[15:45] whether whatever it is there has to be
[15:47] something without ourselves come inside
[15:49] of ourselves by the Holy Ghost by a new
[15:52] birth that manifests a different
[15:54] response than what a human being would
[15:57] respond
[15:58] well I'm just going to be nice to that
[15:59] person well that's nice to be nice but
[16:02] we're talking about the love of God here
[16:04] and this love is not just some mental
[16:07] exercise This Love In Jesus had power
[16:10] over demonic forces
[16:13] I may believe that love is the strongest
[16:15] force in the world the love of God it
[16:17] has power over demonic forces you don't
[16:20] have power over demonic forces and maybe
[16:23] some of you listening you don't know if
[16:24] there's demonic forces or not there is
[16:26] demonic forces there's a real God
[16:28] there's a real devil there's demons
[16:30] there's hell there's Heaven there's
[16:32] other dimensions the Bible says that can
[16:35] you say Amen so now all this demonic
[16:37] realm is against you especially if you
[16:40] choose to be a believer and filled with
[16:42] the Holy Ghost all of Hell's guns are
[16:44] trained on you
[16:46] how do we fight it not with yourself
[16:49] good luck fighting demonic power on your
[16:51] own good luck fighting demonic power
[16:54] with your mental exercises there's one
[16:57] force that can defeat Satan's demonic
[16:59] power and that's the love of God it says
[17:01] Divine love bears and protects things
[17:03] Divine love believes the best of things
[17:06] first Divine love always has hope for
[17:09] all things Divine love endures and holds
[17:13] up during difficulties love bears all
[17:15] things regardless of what comes it
[17:17] believes all things looking for the best
[17:19] in each one it hopes all things
[17:21] remaining steadfast during difficult
[17:23] times endures all things without
[17:26] weakening it's strong can you say Amen
[17:29] it's faithful can you say Amen it's
[17:32] consistent can you say Amen
[17:34] and uh we find that in these statements
[17:37] that it's positive
[17:40] all of this is positive it's not cynical
[17:44] it's not this oh I'm I'm not sure that
[17:47] you'll make it this is positive it Bears
[17:50] all things it believes all things it's
[17:53] got victory in mind these statements
[17:56] this love has victory in mind no matter
[17:59] what condition you are in this love says
[18:03] you may be in that condition but I'm
[18:05] believing for something better this
[18:06] Divine love is positive that you believe
[18:09] the best in somebody that you believe
[18:11] there's going to be a victory for
[18:12] somebody I like to be around people like
[18:14] that that can correct me but there's a
[18:18] victory in mind that's why I read to the
[18:19] scripture he gives he's given us the
[18:21] victory in Jesus Christ
[18:23] he didn't give us Jesus Christ in
[18:25] Christianity and the message of the last
[18:27] days to bring us defeated people and to
[18:29] go into our Rapture defeated he brought
[18:31] it to in this in a big victory
[18:33] the Rapture is a big victory
[18:36] talk about Satan being upset when the
[18:38] True Believers leave this earth in a
[18:40] Rapture you talk about an ultimate
[18:42] victory
[18:43] it's just like Satan will be laying out
[18:46] completely faded I did everything I
[18:49] could and they're gone and that's it
[18:51] we'll just you just you know fan him
[18:54] just a little bit you know yeah it's a
[18:56] victory for the bride it's getting past
[18:58] what you see to what you don't see and
[19:01] that's faith
[19:03] you can't find a a cynical spirit in
[19:06] this you can't find a sarcastic spirit
[19:09] in this
[19:10] you can't find a doubtful spirit in this
[19:14] you can't find a pessimistic attitude in
[19:17] any of these scriptures of divine love
[19:19] you can't find a pessimist you can't
[19:22] find someone that just always leaves a
[19:23] doubt you'll never make it
[19:27] you're a dirtbag look where you're at
[19:29] that there's a you know you might get
[19:32] help but I doubt it you can't find that
[19:34] in here
[19:35] it Bears all things it believes all
[19:37] things it hopes all things it's
[19:39] steadfast to keep believing all things
[19:41] no matter how many years it takes it's
[19:42] going to keep believing it endures
[19:44] things without weakening that's that's
[19:47] our Father Abraham he endured through
[19:50] doubts through unbelief through all the
[19:51] things he went through his faith remains
[19:54] steadfast
[19:56] I'm gonna believe
[19:58] Sarah Sarah
[20:00] do you feel any different today because
[20:02] he's going to have a son through this
[20:03] old grandma
[20:05] you feel any different today and she's
[20:08] foreign
[20:09] no I don't feel any different Abraham
[20:12] praise the Lord we're going to have a
[20:13] baby anyhow
[20:14] [Music]
[20:15] 25 years
[20:18] how about today Sarah
[20:19] Abraham you asked me that the last 30
[20:22] days you've asked me the same question
[20:23] I'm sorry I don't feel any different
[20:25] praise God we're going to have a baby
[20:26] anyhow it's a steadfast
[20:30] through the weakening
[20:32] through the enduring things enduring
[20:35] criticism and during whatever it is and
[20:38] incidentally he had some times in the
[20:40] Old Testament Abraham that he didn't
[20:42] look like he acted like that but the New
[20:44] Testament Accord of him or a account of
[20:47] him basically just recorded that he was
[20:49] a man of faith and he believed against
[20:51] hope believed in Hope Divine love is not
[20:55] out to look for the reason to condemn
[20:58] first
[21:01] but the reason to save
[21:04] to create an atmosphere that however bad
[21:06] it looks that there's Redemption there's
[21:08] hope it's Redemption you can find in
[21:10] this in this love you always find
[21:12] redemption in this love you now it's not
[21:15] a lack of Truth it'll never compromise
[21:17] on truth it's someone's living a
[21:18] rebellious life then you can't justify
[21:21] that you can't say they're okay they're
[21:23] not okay
[21:24] but your hope believes that they're
[21:26] gonna be okay someday that God's gonna
[21:28] bring them out of their Rebellion
[21:30] somebody say praise the Lord so this
[21:32] love is not wishy-washy compromising and
[21:36] and justifying things people do but it
[21:39] never finds the condemnation first it
[21:42] tries to say listen I know you're in a
[21:44] state and I know you've done this to me
[21:46] or you've done this to do this and you
[21:47] you've done all these things but listen
[21:49] now I'm going to pray for you because
[21:51] I'm believing all things for you and I
[21:53] believe God can save you
[21:57] it's got positive Hope and Faith in it
[22:00] can you say Amen
[22:01] so to create an atmosphere however bad
[22:03] it looks where there's Redemption
[22:06] if you do this with your kids your kids
[22:08] will be a lot healthier in life in this
[22:10] atmosphere in the home of a positive
[22:12] there's always redemption in every
[22:14] mistake Lord help us parents help us
[22:17] parents
[22:18] that they get corrected
[22:20] and they know where they're wrong and
[22:22] they feel conviction don't raise kids
[22:23] that don't you're going to cover and get
[22:25] get rid of all convictions good they
[22:27] need to feel bad for what they've done
[22:29] but they needed to be a positive
[22:31] atmosphere that that's not a judge of
[22:32] your character you're going to come out
[22:33] of that thing you're going to be better
[22:35] for it
[22:37] uh create a home like that create an
[22:39] atmosphere where there's Redemption so
[22:41] first it's a the first confession is to
[22:43] speak Faith and Hope not a denial of the
[22:45] person's condition not that not a denial
[22:48] of truth but speaking positive instead
[22:50] of negative First the power and power
[22:52] the power of death and life are in the
[22:54] tongue can you say Amen
[22:57] not looking for the negative First
[23:01] Christians and our friend our Christian
[23:03] friends they have a duty in the right
[23:05] thing to expose something that's wrong
[23:07] in my life and wrong in your life that
[23:09] if they don't do that for me or you it's
[23:12] not love
[23:13] love is corrective
[23:16] love is corrective this world and the
[23:19] church World removes all the correction
[23:21] in love that's not love
[23:24] God corrects us because he loves us
[23:26] so you don't remove this love doesn't
[23:28] remove the correction but but it's the
[23:31] type of correction that has value in it
[23:34] it has something no father that father
[23:37] is correct for their own benefit the
[23:39] Hebrews talks about it but he says our
[23:41] father corrects us for our own benefit
[23:43] that we could bring forth the fruits
[23:45] later he's got the fruits in mind he's
[23:47] got the victory in mind so he may
[23:49] correct you but he's got something in
[23:51] mind there's a victory for the
[23:52] correction there's a victory coming at
[23:54] the end of the correction help our
[23:56] parenting to be that way Lord help our
[23:58] parenting to be that way the ultimate
[24:00] end is a victory over something it's a
[24:03] positive hope over something can you say
[24:04] Amen you're not defeated for life
[24:07] because you made a mistake
[24:09] you're not doomed for life because you
[24:11] made a mistake
[24:13] make a mistake own up to it bring it to
[24:15] the cross
[24:17] go on with God
[24:19] There's Hope in that
[24:21] I love being around someone who has a
[24:24] value for the god in me can you say I
[24:26] don't want to be around people that just
[24:27] that they don't ever correct me that's
[24:29] that's immature
[24:31] but I want to be around someone who has
[24:33] the value for God in Me and they
[24:35] encourage that God in Me and they have a
[24:38] welcoming spirit that I can come to and
[24:40] if they have a welcoming spirit and
[24:42] they've got Divine love expressed to me
[24:44] I can listen to them when they come to
[24:47] correct me
[24:49] is this okay with everybody
[24:51] the gospel is good news it's good
[24:53] telling it's a good story it's the true
[24:55] uh can you say it man it's it's
[24:58] something that ends in a victory there's
[25:00] always a victory it's not just a story
[25:02] but has power with it there's power
[25:04] under the salvation of it there's power
[25:06] for redemption in the love of God I'm
[25:09] going to say it again there is
[25:10] Supernatural power in Redemption and in
[25:13] the cross and in the blood and in his
[25:15] Spirit there's power for Redemption for
[25:18] salvation of any situation
[25:22] I wouldn't stay in a church that did not
[25:24] preach against sin or against hell and
[25:26] the nature of sin why because it's in
[25:28] the Bible and so if it's in the Bible it
[25:30] needs to be preached but when you preach
[25:32] at hell when you preach the truth when
[25:34] you breach conviction to me which I'd
[25:36] love to have more preachers preaching
[25:38] conviction
[25:39] but when you preach it to me please
[25:41] preach the gospel with it preach it in
[25:45] its power and give me a Lifeline give me
[25:48] something to deliver my life from that
[25:49] hell don't just preach hell but give me
[25:52] a Lifeline give me a way out don't give
[25:55] me an intellectual sermon on the blood
[25:57] preach conviction under the word with no
[26:00] denominational restraints and let the
[26:02] life come from that gospel to save me
[26:04] there's life in the blood can you say
[26:06] Amen tonight
[26:08] you can't have access to the blood
[26:10] without the full word it's not a symbol
[26:12] in the cross it's a power it's a
[26:14] substance of the Life of Christ preach
[26:16] that to me preach out to me give me a
[26:19] lifeline
[26:20] give me something to grab a hold of that
[26:22] if I Repent he's going to save me from
[26:24] my situation somebody said praise the
[26:26] Lord
[26:27] this is this is a positive
[26:30] thing
[26:31] but it's not positive thinking
[26:36] people think that the gospel now they've
[26:38] preached on TV and everything it's it's
[26:41] it's positive thinking the blood is not
[26:43] just positive thinking in the mind of
[26:45] positive thinking
[26:46] it expresses confidence and hope that
[26:50] something is going to happen you see if
[26:52] you just talk positive thinking there's
[26:54] no blood in that
[26:58] there's no power in that oh there's the
[27:01] power of a mind that can think the the
[27:04] what's the the book called The Power of
[27:06] Positive Thinking yeah there's a certain
[27:08] power but with that they were building
[27:10] the Tower of Babel
[27:12] it was positive thinking that built the
[27:14] Tower of Babel till God himself said if
[27:16] we don't confuse their language I can't
[27:18] stop the power of their positive
[27:19] thinking seminars
[27:23] positive thinking seminars rebuilding
[27:25] the Tower of Babel because something
[27:26] completely against God
[27:28] so we're not when we when we look at the
[27:30] Divine love of God this isn't positive
[27:32] thinking this is the has the blood in it
[27:35] and it's a positive hope that the power
[27:37] of the blood can change you and bring a
[27:40] real victory in your life it's positive
[27:42] because the blood has positive effects
[27:45] always
[27:46] praise be to God the blood always has
[27:50] positive effects the blood will always
[27:52] have problems the blood will always
[27:54] cause us to Triumph Triumph the blood
[27:56] will always bring the victory in our
[27:58] life
