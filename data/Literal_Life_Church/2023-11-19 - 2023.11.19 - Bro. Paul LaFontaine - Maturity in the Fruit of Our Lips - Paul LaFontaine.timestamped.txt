[28:13] 1 my brethren be not many Masters
[28:16] knowing that we shall receive the
[28:18] greater condemnation in other words um
[28:21] maybe you shouldn't want to be a teacher
[28:23] because teachers who have to stand in
[28:25] front of the people uh are under greater
[28:27] scrutiny sometimes so they have to watch
[28:30] what they say a little closer then he
[28:32] goes into a subject on the tongue for in
[28:35] many things we offend all If any man
[28:37] offend not in word the same as a perfect
[28:39] man and able also to Bridle the whole
[28:42] body behold we put bits in the horses
[28:45] mouths that we may that they may obey us
[28:47] and we turn about their whole body
[28:49] behold also the ships which though they
[28:51] be so great are driven of fierce winds
[28:54] yet are they turned about with a very
[28:56] small helm withs soever the governor
[28:59] listeth even so the tongue is a little
[29:01] member and boasteth great things behold
[29:04] how great a matter a little fire
[29:07] kindleth and the tongue is a fire a
[29:10] world of iniquity so is the tongue among
[29:12] our members that it defileth the whole
[29:15] body and Seth on fire the course of
[29:17] Nature and is set on fire of hell for
[29:21] every king of beast excuse me every kind
[29:24] of Beast and of birds and of serpents
[29:26] and of things in the sea is tamed and
[29:29] hath been tamed of mankind but the
[29:31] tongue can no man tame it is an unruly
[29:35] evil full of deadly poison and you guys
[29:38] think I'm a hard preacher James is
[29:41] pretty straight on your tongue therefore
[29:43] bless we God even the father and
[29:45] therewith curse we men with the same
[29:48] tongue bless God and curse men which are
[29:51] made after the similitude of God out of

[30:47] him therefore let us offer the sacrifice
[30:50] of praise to God continually that is the
[30:54] fruit of our lips giving thanks to his

[31:56] it's also Al related to the maturity of
[31:59] sons um where the Holy Ghost takes us in
[32:02] growth and Perfection and ultimately a
[32:05] Rapture is where the Holy Ghost takes us
[32:08] the Redemption of our body so adoption
[32:10] has to do with us being birthed by the
[32:12] Holy Ghost but it's not just being
[32:14] birthed by the Holy Ghost it's where the
[32:16] Holy Ghost will take you and some of the
[32:19] things I'm going to be preaching on not
[32:20] today but in the coming weeks is that
[32:22] where that growth that Holy Ghost is a
[32:25] growth so that that Holy Ghost will take
[32:27] you somewhere it'll take you to more
[32:29] growth it'll take you to more Perfection
[32:32] perfection in the Bible does not mean
[32:34] sinless Perfection Perfection means
[32:37] growth to maturity you are growing to
[32:40] adulthood as a Christian that's what
[32:42] adoption does that's what the Holy Ghost
[32:44] does it doesn't leave you a baby with
[32:47] immaturities it grows you to be a full
[32:50] mature son and daughter of God now if
[32:53] that's not happening and you have the
[32:54] Holy Ghost then you're stunting that
[32:56] growth you're holding up that growth
[32:58] you're stubborn or something because
[33:00] there's only one direction the Holy
[33:02] Ghost will take you and that's more
[33:03] growth in the word if you're saying no I
[33:06] ain't taking that part of the word then
[33:07] first of all I'd question your Holy
[33:09] Ghost because the Holy Ghost always says
[33:11] Amen to the word but if it's being
[33:13] stunted then there's something wrong
[33:14] with you it's not God because the Holy
[33:17] Ghost is an adoption to take you to grow
[33:20] in the Lord more power more strength
[33:23] more overcoming and guess what more
[33:26] mature
[33:29] if we're staying babies spiritually
[33:30] there's something
[33:32] wrong and so it it it this became a
[33:35] theme to me in Holland when we were
[33:37] there in the conference in Holland uh
[33:39] maturity maturity became a theme and uh
[33:43] we believe that God is looking for more
[33:46] and more from Sons and Daughters of God
[33:48] that we are saved and it's a gift of
[33:51] Salvation God gives us the gift of
[33:53] Salvation he gives us the gift of the
[33:54] Holy Ghost they are free gifts can you
[33:57] say Amen you don't have to do any Works
[33:59] to attain that God gives it to you when
[34:01] you ask him but then after he gives you
[34:04] that then we want to grow to please the
[34:06] Lord more if we're doing anything to
[34:09] grieve him then we want to stop doing
[34:11] the things that grieve him and do more
[34:14] and more things that please the Lord is
[34:16] that okay with everybody and so now when
[34:19] we when when we become God's looking for
[34:21] more and more sunship or maturity and I
[34:25] believe that the word that we're under
[34:27] in the last days that God has blessed us
[34:29] with he has blessed us with an open book
[34:32] The Bible has become open to us the book
[34:35] of redemption has become open to us in
[34:37] Revelations 5 the lamb took the book and
[34:40] he took the seals off the book that
[34:43] means he has given us something that's
[34:45] not closed but it's open to us and now
[34:49] that we have been given that it says
[34:51] when he come with the open book it says
[34:53] when he was holding the book he hath
[34:55] made us Kings and
[35:00] Priests it's taking us somewhere the
[35:03] Holy Ghost is taking somewhere the the
[35:06] book being open the seals taken off of
[35:08] our Bibles it's taking the people
[35:10] somewhere thou Hast made us Kings and
[35:13] Priests he's making you something guess
[35:17] what both of those positions of Kings
[35:19] and Priests require
[35:24] maturity how terrible would it be to put
[35:26] a King in that's immature we're in
[35:29] trouble reminds me of some presidents
[35:32] that are getting in these
[35:34] days we're in
[35:37] trouble character is needed to serve in
[35:39] these positions as God moves Us in then
[35:42] positions us with the open book then
[35:45] character maturity is needed in these
[35:47] positions how do we get character how do
[35:49] we get maturity through our trials
[35:52] through what God takes us through that
[35:54] through our trials we stopped acting
[35:55] like babies and saying God I don't want
[35:58] any more trials I don't want to go
[35:59] through anything else I just want life
[36:01] to be cushiony put a cushion around me
[36:03] and when I bump and like that I got a
[36:05] cushion all around me and God says no
[36:07] I'm trying to grow you as a son I'm
[36:09] trying to child train you here I'm
[36:11] trying to discipline you so that you
[36:14] grow up and you can stand on your own
[36:16] can you say Amen said I'm going to be a
[36:19] defeat to the devil today I'm going to
[36:22] overcome I'm going to hold the power and
[36:24] authority within my hands but I'm going
[36:26] to hold it with
[36:28] maturity so now I'm into this because
[36:31] there's still way too many maturities
[36:34] that I see in the church and I don't
[36:36] mean just this church I mean within our
[36:40] ranks it's disappointing to see that the
[36:42] people with the open book the people
[36:45] with the book of the Redemption that can
[36:46] hear the glories of the word of God like
[36:49] no other people have ever heard it
[36:51] before and still see so many
[36:54] immaturities Among Us just so you think
[36:57] I'm uh you don't think that I'm
[36:59] preaching everybody else I'm
[37:00] disappointed with the immaturities I see
[37:02] in myself still there's still too much
[37:06] of me that's being
[37:08] manifested I don't I wouldn't ask you to
[37:10] raise your hand but I can say there's
[37:12] still way too much of me and not enough
[37:15] of him there's still way too many
[37:18] immaturities that I hit a certain thing
[37:20] and I should know how to act and I'm not
[37:23] acting and doing and I take Satan's bake
[37:25] to jump in on a or something like that
[37:27] or an argument and I say why did you do
[37:30] that again shut your mouth and be
[37:35] quiet so I'm still growing as a
[37:39] pastor and I want the High Calling of
[37:43] Christ in my life calvary's purchased
[37:46] the High Calling of Christ you can stay
[37:49] where you're at but I don't want to stay
[37:51] where I'm at I want to grow into a full
[37:55] mature Son of God
[37:57] God we got to move to a higher place we
[38:00] got to move to a higher calling and we
[38:02] want to a deeper walk with God how many
[38:05] would raise your hand and say I want a
[38:07] deeper walk with God I want a deeper
[38:10] walk and deeper doesn't mean deeper
[38:13] necessarily in the word it's a closer
[38:15] relationship with him it's a son that's
[38:18] in constant communion with him and it's
[38:20] a son when he hits a trial he acts like
[38:23] a grownup Son of God that I'm going to
[38:25] take this because I know this will be
[38:27] good for
[38:29] me Israel had a history of immaturities
[38:33] for 40 years in the wilderness uh the
[38:36] Bible says in Hebrews that God was not
[38:38] well pleased and God was grieved with an
[38:41] entire generation and so in 1
[38:44] Corinthians 10 it gives some of these
[38:45] Grievances and it gives some of this
[38:46] stuff here's the people that were under
[38:48] the message in that day under Moses
[38:51] message here's how they were 1
[38:53] Corinthians 10 and: 10 you guys can put
[38:55] it up if you want moreover Brethren I
[38:57] would not that you should be ignorant
[38:58] how that our fathers were under the
[39:00] cloud and all passed through the sea and
[39:03] were all baptized into Moses in the
[39:05] cloud and the Sea and did all eat the
[39:08] same spiritual meat and did all drink
[39:10] the same spiritual drink for they drank
[39:12] of that spiritual rock that was followed
[39:14] them and that rock was Christ but with
[39:17] many of them God was not well pleased
[39:19] for they were overthrown in the
[39:20] wilderness now these things were our
[39:22] examples to the intent we should not
[39:24] lust after evil things as they also
[39:26] lusted neither be idolators as were some
[39:30] of them as it is written the people sat
[39:32] down and to eat and drink and Rose up to
[39:34] play neither let us commit fornication
[39:37] as some of them committed and fell in
[39:39] one day three and three we're we're
[39:41] reading the history of message
[39:47] Believers and the Bible doesn't hide
[39:50] anything amen lot of you have lot of you
[39:53] have trouble saying amen this is the
[39:55] history of 40 years of God's people
[39:57] under a prophet and you got idolatry you
[40:01] got
[40:02] fornication uh let's read a little
[40:04] further neither let us tempt Christ as
[40:06] some of them tempted and were destroyed
[40:08] as serpents how did they tempt the Lord
[40:10] they were saying is the Lord among us or
[40:13] not they were questioning whether the
[40:14] Lord was even among them even though he
[40:16] opened up the Red Sea even though he
[40:18] gave them Mana when they were hungry
[40:19] even though they gave them a spiritual
[40:21] Rock when they were thirsty he did
[40:23] Miracle after miracle and they still
[40:24] come up to tempt the Lord saying but
[40:26] really is the Lord really among us or
[40:30] not tempting the
[40:32] Lord
[40:35] immaturity do you say that when you hit
[40:37] a trial that you don't think was fair to
[40:39] you is God really in my life or not why
[40:43] is God doing this why is God allowing
[40:46] this it's
[40:48] immaturity because whatever God allows
[40:50] in my life is going to be for my
[40:55] good
[41:00] what a
[41:01] history verse 10 neither murmur ye as
[41:05] some also murmured I know nobody ever
[41:07] does that here or in the message neither
[41:10] murmur ye as some of them murmured and
[41:12] were destroyed of the Destroyer now all
[41:13] these things happen for our examples and
[41:15] they're written for our admonition
[41:17] that's a slight rebuke upon whom the
[41:19] ends of the world are come wherefore let
[41:21] him that thinketh he stand take heed
[41:23] lest he fall that's a message to message
[41:26] Believers that are under profit when you
[41:28] think you stand take heed lest you fall
[41:31] by these things because you're not
[41:33] strong within yourself you're only
[41:35] strong when you let the Holy Ghost take
[41:38] over your life can I get a further amen
[41:41] You're Not Strong you will fall to the
[41:44] same things and the same immaturities
[41:47] unless you let the Holy Ghost take over
[41:49] your
[41:51] life so all of this history of Israel
[41:54] under the prophet's message it's not
[41:56] good they're gossiping in their tents
[41:58] they're murmuring they're complaining
[41:59] against Moses they're backbiting they're
[42:02] they're uh disrespectful to God's
[42:05] Prophet they're allowed to say anything
[42:06] against God's prophet and get by with it
[42:09] and so they're babies in the wilderness
[42:10] under God's Prophet babies in the
[42:12] wilderness under God's prophet and so
[42:14] I'll just give you two examples I could
[42:16] go into many of them and we went into
[42:18] this a little bit in Holland so this is
[42:19] a little bit of a repeat but there's two
[42:21] examples one in the Old Testament one in
[42:23] the New Testament and both of these
[42:25] people were under the ministry of the
[42:27] son of man one in the Old Testament one
[42:29] in the New Testament they had seen
[42:31] Mighty things that God had done they had
[42:34] watch the son of man in action discern
[42:36] Hearts do all of that do Miracles that
[42:39] that that are amazing amazing and they
[42:42] watched it all under the son of man
[42:45] prophetic Ministry and yet we see a lot
[42:47] of immaturities in their life one
[42:50] example is that when and that's
[42:52] mentioned here in the scripture that I
[42:53] read here in 1 Corinthians 10 it talks
[42:56] about them uh they come across the sea
[43:00] they come across the Red Sea so now I
[43:02] was reading a few weeks ago would you
[43:03] get with me Psalms 106 I was reading
[43:05] this in my devotion and Psalms
[43:08] 106 it's a couple weeks ago I was
[43:11] reading this in my a morning devotion or
[43:13] evening whichever one if I don't make it
[43:15] in the morning I do the evening devotion
[43:17] if I don't wake up early enough or I got
[43:20] to get going I try to be faithful with
[43:22] that but if I don't catch it in the
[43:24] morning I do it in the evening so it was
[43:26] either the morning or the evening that I
[43:28] read psalms 106 would you read it with
[43:31] me and here in 106 gives the entire
[43:34] history of Israel a lot of the things I
[43:36] just read and David is being very
[43:39] repentant saying look what our fathers
[43:40] did look what the you know look at the
[43:43] some of the things that they did but
[43:44] right in the middle of this God gives
[43:47] what he did verse n he rebuked the Red
[43:49] Sea I mean Psalms 106 ver9 he rebuked
[43:53] the Red Sea also and it was dried up so
[43:55] he led them through the depths as
[43:57] through the
[43:58] Wilderness and he saved them from the
[44:01] hand of him that hated them and redeemed
[44:03] them from the hand of the enemy they
[44:04] stood there and watched all of Pharaoh's
[44:06] Army be drowned in the Red Sea they
[44:09] walked across on dry land on the Red Sea
[44:12] quite a
[44:14] miracle and the waters covered their
[44:17] enemies that there was not one of them
[44:19] left not one enemy left how many believe
[44:21] that God's powerful enough to put all
[44:23] your enemies in the Red Sea all your
[44:26] abits all your addictions pornography
[44:28] what it whatever it is he's able to
[44:31] drown all of it in the Red
[44:34] Sea verse 12 then then believe they his
[44:38] words and they sang his praise so I
[44:41] thought well praise the Lord and I've
[44:43] heard so many sermons The Last Five
[44:46] Years on this part of the children of
[44:48] Israel where Mariam sees the Red Sea and
[44:51] all the enemy there and Mariam picks up
[44:54] the tambourine do I have a a tambourine
[44:56] here or they always hide them from me
[44:58] cuz they don't think I can play it you
[45:03] have are you sister
[45:06] Mariam Viola Viola that's that's good
[45:09] enough that's close
[45:11] enough I hear so many sermons and I love
[45:14] to hear it because listen when God
[45:16] drowns your troubles in the Red Sea and
[45:17] your enemy you're going to be happy
[45:19] about it you're going to shout about it
[45:21] you're going to Rejoice about it and
[45:23] that's what they did they said they
[45:25] believe because they weren't believing
[45:26] for the all the years before all the
[45:28] Miracles they weren't really believing
[45:30] but now this happens and they're
[45:32] believing and they're praising God
[45:34] Mariam gets her tambourine and all the
[45:37] El daughters grab their tambourines and
[45:39] she had the whole church all revived as
[45:42] they watched all the bones and all the
[45:45] the uh the the Pharaoh's Army bobbing up
[45:47] and down in the Red
[45:50] Sea Mary says let's worship together
[45:53] come on everybody I will will sing unto
[45:57] the Lord for he has triumphed gloriously
[46:00] the horse and the rider get thrown into
[46:03] the
[46:05] sea I will sing unto the Lord for he has
[46:09] triumphed gloriously the horse of the
[46:12] rider get thrown into the
[46:15] sea woo glory be to
[46:19] God see I can play it they don't think I
[46:22] can play it around here but I can they
[46:24] hide all the tambourines and you can
[46:26] play thank you appreciate
[46:29] it it was a time and I hear so many
[46:31] sermons on it but guess what I hear
[46:34] hardly any sermons of this
[46:38] people how they acted the other side of
[46:41] the Red
[46:42] Sea
[46:45] and how they were acting just three days
[46:49] later after they
[46:52] shouted and it says it in Psalms it says
[46:55] this believ they his words they sang his
[46:58] praise they soon forgot his Works they
[47:02] waited not for his counsil
[47:05] immaturity I tell you friends you can
[47:08] even enjoy the word today and celebrate
[47:11] and feel better when you leave but I
[47:13] don't care how you act in here you can
[47:15] shout you can dance and I I would love
[47:17] for some of you to do it sometimes but
[47:20] it's not what you act like in here it's
[47:23] what you act like in obedience to the
[47:26] when you leave these
[47:29] doors and they go back and they said but
[47:32] then they lusted exceedingly in the
[47:33] wilderness and tempted God in the
[47:35] wilderness he gave them the request but
[47:37] sent leanness to their soul they envied
[47:39] Moses it goes on and on so one little
[47:42] verse says they shouted but before the
[47:45] Red Sea they were complaining they were
[47:47] saying we're stuck you brought us out
[47:49] here's our Pharaoh's Army coming what
[47:52] are we going to do and even Moses the
[47:54] prophet is complaining in crying unto
[47:56] the Lord what are we going to do and
[47:59] that's why that adoption message came I
[48:01] call this an adoption message Wesley
[48:04] wrote a song about it Sayang it
[48:05] Wednesday night an adoption message is
[48:08] why Christ speak unto me an adoption
[48:11] message of the other brand was why
[48:13] Christ speak and also uh Paradox those
[48:16] are adoption messages where where Joshua
[48:19] said he didn't even have a word on it he
[48:21] didn't have the scripture on it son
[48:22] stands still for a day so we can finish
[48:24] this off that's adoption message that's
[48:27] a son in his position with power can you
[48:30] say amen and Moses is complaining and
[48:33] God says why are you crying I've given
[48:35] you commission I've said you're going to
[48:36] make it you're going over I don't care
[48:39] if a red sea is there I don't care if
[48:41] the Mediterranean see is after that I
[48:43] don't care if the Atlantic ghost is
[48:44] after that I have commissioned you
[48:46] you're going to make it you're going to
[48:52] overcome why are you
[48:54] crying because of
[48:59] immaturity grow up as a Son of God stop
[49:02] crying and speak and go forward and
[49:05] Moses said all right he stood up into
[49:08] his position and he says raised his
[49:10] hands and most you watch the movie and
[49:12] everything else God opens up by his
[49:14] command opens up the Red
[49:16] Sea but that's how they were acting
[49:19] before this side of the Red Sea then
[49:21] they get done and read just three one
[49:25] excuse me six verses later after they
[49:27] shouted with their
[49:30] tambourine they ran out of water and
[49:33] they begin to
[49:34] complain that they didn't have any
[49:38] water wow three days three days I
[49:41] believe it was three days now you can
[49:44] put this off in the Old Testament all
[49:45] you want to but this reflects the IM
[49:48] immaturities that come out of our Lives
[49:49] Many Times what do we talk about on
[49:54] Monday what do we talk about when we're
[49:57] depressed what do we talk about when we
[50:00] don't feel God
[50:02] around I don't feel God like I felt him
[50:05] on Sunday so now you start to say
[50:08] anything which is going to be my theme
[50:09] today for a very short time there's two
[50:12] main immaturities that I think were in
[50:13] Israel and that are in the church
[50:15] sometimes and that is there's a lot of
[50:17] immaturities and we could preach on all
[50:19] of them but I'm only going to emphasize
[50:21] two the one immaturity the two
[50:24] immaturities let your giving yourself
[50:26] permission to think any thought that you
[50:29] want to think at any
[50:31] time and second of all giving yourself
[50:34] permission to say anything you want at
[50:37] any
[50:41] time and news flash there's a lot of
[50:45] scriptures that does not give sons of
[50:48] God a permission to spill out anything
[50:51] out of these tongues that they want to
[50:53] say well I'm an American I have a right
[50:55] to say what I want to say it's free
[50:57] speech you're not an American you're a
[51:00] Christian you're a son of
[51:04] godl and sons of God in are a different
[51:07] Kingdom than Americans thank God we are
[51:11] and we do not give ourselves permission
[51:13] but this is Israel they gave their
[51:15] themselves permission especially in
[51:17] their tents in their homes to say
[51:20] anything they wanted to say to think
[51:22] anything they wanted to think and you've
[51:24] heard me preach about the Mind our
[51:26] thinking process growing in our thinking
[51:28] bringing every thought captive to the
[51:31] Lord every thought has to be scanned by
[51:34] the word of God and if it's not a
[51:36] thought of God you can't give yourself
[51:38] permission to think it whether it's
[51:40] depressing whether it's criticism to
[51:42] someone else whether it's a doubtful
[51:44] thought towards the word of God it
[51:46] should not be allowed in your thinking
[51:47] to go any further than one thought and
[51:50] it is got captive it the handcuffs are
[51:53] put on that thought and said you are not
[51:55] coming into my thought
[51:59] life you know why we give ourselves
[52:01] permission to do it because nobody sees
[52:03] our thought
[52:04] life and should I take an hour and
[52:06] preach on what you let and what you feed
[52:08] on influence your thought life social
[52:11] media movies you think the way you do
[52:15] because of what you feed
[52:19] on don't forget James is a harder
[52:21] preacher than
[52:23] me he's the one that says tongue is a
[52:27] poison it's an unruly evil your tongue
[52:32] is an unruly
[52:33] evil but I'm a mild preacher and I just
[52:36] say we should bring our tongues under
[52:37] subjection of the
[52:40] Lord 40 years was he grieved Hebrews
[52:44] says it they were babies until the time
[52:47] came under Joshua to grow up CU they
[52:49] couldn't go into the land themselves
[52:51] without the prophet until they come
[52:53] under the Holy Ghost Joshua to grow up
[52:54] and become men become women to take the
[52:57] land past all their immaturity past
[52:59] their unbelief growing out of it how
[53:01] many want to grow out of it and coming
[53:03] into a faith to take your land brother
[53:05] BR even referred to fighters in the
[53:07] wilderness that had to die off before
[53:09] the new generation could come in there
[53:11] was Fighters they were F it's
[53:13] interesting brother BR said called them
[53:14] fighters fighters they like to argue
[53:17] they like to fight they they're
[53:19] preachers that like to argue over the
[53:21] pulpit they like to slam other preachers
[53:23] over the pulpit they're old Fighters
[53:25] that have to die off because their
[53:27] Spirit they're manifesting is a fighting
[53:29] Spirit Against The Wrong Enemy we're not
[53:32] supposed to be fighting against one
[53:33] another we have an enemy to fight
[53:35] against why are you preaching against me
[53:37] telling me I'm not even preaching the
[53:39] message why are we fighting I pray that
[53:41] God would cause us to lose all of our
[53:44] fighting spirit and point our sword at
[53:46] the
[53:50] enemy an example in the New Testament is
[53:54] Luke 9 where Jesus has his adoption
[53:57] ceremony and and he's Peter James and
[54:00] John are invited and they're up there
[54:02] and Moses and Elijah appear here and so
[54:04] here they all are and uh they fall
[54:08] asleep first of all you know this is a
[54:09] pretty big event and uh Peter and James
[54:14] they fall asleep it's pretty big event
[54:16] it's Jesus adoption something's going to
[54:18] happen in the mountain and they were
[54:20] exclusively invited to this and the
[54:22] Bible says they were asleep so they had
[54:24] to be woke up and when they wake up they
[54:26] see Jesus face transfigured in front of
[54:29] them which means he's receiving the
[54:32] approval of God the father and the
[54:35] approval that this is my son I'm pleased
[54:37] to dwell in him there was a Radiance
[54:40] referring back to brother bradam and the
[54:42] vision that was in the
[54:44] church this wasn't related to the seals
[54:47] this was brother Roberson said I seen
[54:48] you in a dream and you came back I was
[54:50] calling you back cuz you you was at a
[54:52] table with us feasting you went out to
[54:54] the West
[54:55] then I call said brother brand please
[54:57] come back he was screaming it come back
[54:58] when he came back he was sitting at the
[55:00] table again with him and he says I
[55:02] looked at you brother brandom and you
[55:03] were changed your countenance was
[55:05] changed if you study it that's not a
[55:08] change as far as doing more miracles in
[55:09] his life that was a change in his heart
[55:12] with a bad attitude towards the Ricky
[55:15] and the
[55:18] ricettas so the change was an internal
[55:20] change that God was dealing with all
[55:23] through while he's preaching the climax
[55:25] of a Ministry the pro the the the the
[55:27] seals it's going on the whole time he's
[55:29] going to leave the ministry he was going
[55:30] to leave and go go be a Trapper cuz he
[55:32] got fed up with people that he was
[55:33] preaching to still he says I preach
[55:35] against this I preach against the
[55:36] immodest clothing I come back it's it's
[55:38] worse the next year the rebellion of the
[55:40] people got to him and he got upset about
[55:42] it he said listen you know I'm through
[55:44] with this I'm just going to go to a
[55:45] mountain somewhere I'll sneak my wife up
[55:47] there and this will be it I'm done with
[55:48] the ministry in his heart this was going
[55:50] on all these months but God knew about
[55:53] it and God said
[55:55] said I'm going to deal with my
[55:58] son and brother REM said he said I need
[56:01] a little change in my life not that I'm
[56:04] a sinner but I need a little change that
[56:07] I need to love people
[56:10] more adopted son come to adoption you
[56:15] know so many sermons are the Big Chain
[56:17] the Rapture that's the big change and
[56:19] I'm looking forward to it but there's
[56:21] little changes needed in your spirit
[56:23] before the big change comes I can't wait
[56:26] for the big change I I want to go now
[56:29] I'm ready to hop right into the other
[56:31] dimension and go on a Rapture but until
[56:33] that happens God whatever little changes
[56:36] are needed me just a little more love
[56:40] maybe a lot more love to stop being a
[56:43] fighter and stop being has such a bad
[56:45] attitude and stop being a
[56:49] legalist stop with the critical spirit
[56:51] stop with the gossip stop with the
[56:54] backbiting stop with the immaturities
[56:57] let it all stop in my life so that I can
[56:59] grow and become the son that God says
[57:03] I'm pleased to dwell
[57:06] with and he said about Jesus he said
[57:08] this is my son who I'm pleased to dwell
[57:11] and he says they said you know what what
[57:14] Peter let's build through let's build
[57:17] Tabernacles here we need a memory of
[57:20] this let's be no no no no this is my son
[57:23] hear ye him but Moses is here Elijah is
[57:26] here we we need to build a denomination
[57:28] over this this is this is special yeah
[57:30] Peter it's special not to build a
[57:32] denomination on but it brings Sons to
[57:35] adoption that's what's special about
[57:38] this message it brings Sons to adoption
[57:40] some of you have made the message a
[57:42] dress code oh lord it's so much more
[57:45] than a dress
[57:47] code this that he sent us is bringing
[57:50] Sons to glory and there is no
[57:52] denominational system not the people
[57:55] there is no system with man's hands on
[57:58] the Bible that's going to bring Sons to
[58:00] adoption it will be because his word is
[58:03] revealed to his people in its fullness
[58:07] and now they grow into Sons with power
[58:10] and Sons with
[58:13] authority and Sons with
[58:17] character they're sleeping they want to
[58:19] build three Tabernacles then they come
[58:22] down out of the mountain and it's about
[58:24] just two days I think such an experience
[58:27] up there seeing Jesus transfigured and
[58:29] they had a little discussion amongst the
[58:31] disciples who's the greatest Among
[58:35] Us they just come from an adoption
[58:38] ceremony where they're supposed to come
[58:40] and they're they're arguing amongst one
[58:44] another who's the greatest among all the
[58:47] disciples have you guys ever thought
[58:49] about we haven't really decided who
[58:51] takes go over after he's gone
[58:57] you know why I say this because we have
[59:00] way too much of that in the body of
[59:03] Christ who's the greatest preacher who's
[59:06] the next upand cominging Church who's
[59:09] the
[59:11] big Lord Jesus may we please not
[59:16] participate in all of this immaturity
[59:19] that's right I would preach the same
[59:22] this morning if there were 10 people
[59:23] here Church goes up and down people come
[59:26] and go I don't have my mind on numbers I
[59:28] don't have my mind on being acceptable
[59:30] to the rest of the message I'm here to
[59:32] preach to my local congregation and to
[59:34] get me and us into a
[59:39] Rapture I'm serious I'm not saying that
[59:41] have a false humility I don't care where
[59:44] my name goes around the world I don't
[59:46] even want it I want to make myself a no
[59:47] reputation I just want to be a part of
[59:49] the body of Christ I want to enjoy your
[59:51] fellowship and I want to grow to become
[59:53] Sons and Daughters of God and make this
[59:54] Rapture that's what it is that's what
[59:57] I'm here
[59:58] for it's just that simple and to compete
[1:00:02] amongst the ministers who's the next
[1:00:04] convention speaker and who's the guy
[1:00:06] that I have to have my hands laid on and
[1:00:08] prayed for I'm telling your friends you
[1:00:11] know you don't have to go to a
[1:00:12] convention to have a certain brother lay
[1:00:14] hands on you just ask the sister next to
[1:00:17] you to lay hands on you cuz she has just
[1:00:21] as much Holy Ghost as that preacher amen
[1:00:30] have the brother next to you lay hands
[1:00:31] on
[1:00:34] you praise the Lord that's right brother
[1:00:37] Joe it's a body Ministry it's not a
[1:00:40] oneman
[1:00:41] Ministry it's a body
[1:00:44] Ministry so the last thing that happened
[1:00:47] boy okay I have to be mindful
[1:00:51] here we're smelling the
[1:00:53] food it's drifting from the kitchen we
[1:00:56] should have put that kitchen way out
[1:00:57] there Brandon out the other side of the
[1:00:59] building then they get done arguing and
[1:01:02] so you know what happens is is that
[1:01:04] Jesus answered their he come up to their
[1:01:06] discussion about who's the greatest
[1:01:07] among them and he he said let me tell
[1:01:11] you who's the greatest Among Us you come
[1:01:13] here a minute are you too shy okay thank
[1:01:15] you you're too
[1:01:17] shy ah boy these kids watch me scream up
[1:01:21] here and they're scared to death of
[1:01:23] me would you come up here a
[1:01:27] minute even my own granddaughter is
[1:01:29] scared of
[1:01:31] me anyway if you can Envision he takes a
[1:01:35] little child sets him in front of the
[1:01:38] disciples and he says big
[1:01:43] preachers this is the greatest in the
[1:01:45] Kingdom of
[1:01:47] Heaven if you get your heart like this
[1:01:49] child in this s because we're to be
[1:01:51] children in our hearts as far as our
[1:01:53] response to God adults as far as our
[1:01:55] power With the Enemy but this is how you
[1:01:58] receive and this is the greatest in the
[1:02:00] kingdom and then then just a few hours
[1:02:02] later Jesus said go into that Village
[1:02:03] and prepare for the Passover go into
[1:02:05] that and it was in the Samaritans they
[1:02:07] go in and they say we won't receive
[1:02:10] you you can't do it here okay you're
[1:02:13] Jews we're Samaritans you can't set it
[1:02:14] up here and you know what they did Jesus
[1:02:17] come in and said John said these guys
[1:02:20] must not know that we're in the
[1:02:23] message
[1:02:27] these guys don't know that we have the
[1:02:30] son of man here we have the son of man
[1:02:33] these guys don't know who we are and
[1:02:34] they have disrespected you Lord and they
[1:02:36] have not received us they have shut the
[1:02:38] doors to us John said would to God that
[1:02:40] we call fire down from heaven like
[1:02:42] Elijah did and just consume the whole
[1:02:45] Community that's
[1:02:50] right some immaturities
[1:02:53] there that's an
[1:02:55] understatement the a guy's following the
[1:02:57] son of man right next to him every day
[1:03:00] and somehow gets in this thing is that
[1:03:02] let's call on the same power of Elijah
[1:03:04] we must have it let's call fire down and
[1:03:07] blow the whole thing up just because
[1:03:09] they wouldn't receive us I tell you
[1:03:11] friends there's a lot more to be said
[1:03:12] about this but we better ask the Holy
[1:03:15] Spirit to burn out our bad attitudes in
[1:03:17] the
[1:03:18] message you may have truth but you
[1:03:20] better have character with your truth
[1:03:22] you may have truth but you better not
[1:03:24] use that sword on other people you may
[1:03:27] have truth but I can tell you
[1:03:28] unbelievers pick up on if it's Pride
[1:03:30] with your truth and it's not attractive
[1:03:32] for them to see religious Pride with the
[1:03:34] truth that you have we don't have a
[1:03:36] monopoly on truth you don't personally
[1:03:38] can you say Amen in the mess we God is a
[1:03:41] god of Truth and I want to remind you
[1:03:43] that brother Bram says God is interested
[1:03:46] in every human being not just those that
[1:03:49] go to message churches God is interested
[1:03:52] in every human being on the face of the
[1:03:56] Earth if he had that attitude why don't
[1:03:59] we have that attitude why are we
[1:04:02] exclusive why do we get it say if they
[1:04:04] won't receive me they weren't they went
[1:04:06] out from us because they weren't of us
[1:04:08] they're serpent seed you don't have a
[1:04:10] right to call somebody serpent seed you
[1:04:12] don't know who they
[1:04:14] are only God has his categories of
[1:04:17] people he has his bride brother rat
[1:04:19] brought the four different parts of the
[1:04:21] book of redemption the four the The Book
[1:04:23] of Life and there is other ones in there
[1:04:24] there's ones that receive salvation at
[1:04:26] Judgment Day based on their works
[1:04:27] there's different categories but God set
[1:04:29] up those categories I don't know who
[1:04:31] they are and as far as I'm concerned we
[1:04:34] should talk to every person as if
[1:04:37] they're a potential elect of
[1:04:40] [Applause]
[1:04:43] God Jesus responded and said John and
[1:04:49] James you don't even know what Spirit
[1:04:52] you're of right now
[1:04:57] and that wasn't the end of the rebuke
[1:04:58] you don't even know what Spirit you got
[1:05:00] on you let me tell you this you need to
[1:05:04] know something this son of man Ministry
[1:05:07] did not come to destroy men's
[1:05:10] lives it came to save men's
[1:05:17] lives are we under the son of man
[1:05:20] today yeah if you know your Bible and
[1:05:22] you know what this message we're under
[1:05:24] the ministry of the son of man and it's
[1:05:26] not about William Bram it's the son of
[1:05:28] man a son of man revealed the son of man
[1:05:31] there's only one the son of man it's
[1:05:33] Jesus Christ not William brandham but he
[1:05:35] was a son of man a prophet to point us
[1:05:37] to the son of man and that son of man is
[1:05:40] here among us today and if we're under
[1:05:42] the son of man Ministry let me say the
[1:05:44] same words as Jesus he did not give it
[1:05:47] to us to destroy men's lives he gave it
[1:05:50] to you to save men's
[1:05:53] lives
[1:05:55] praise the
[1:06:04] Lord we'll get to some of this again
[1:06:07] next Sunday so the rest of this when
[1:06:09] Sons begin to bring their lives every
[1:06:11] part so you see the immaturities in the
[1:06:13] Old Testament New Testament people under
[1:06:15] the son of man so we see then in the
[1:06:18] same thing it could happen with us but
[1:06:19] God's calling us to adoption positioning
[1:06:23] Sons mature
[1:06:24] it can you say
[1:06:29] Amen mainly our tongues and our thought
[1:06:31] life it is immaturity to continue to
[1:06:33] give ourselves permission to say
[1:06:34] anything we want to say or think
[1:06:35] anything we want to think you know the
[1:06:38] first battle that they had in the
[1:06:39] promised land
[1:06:42] Jericho it's interesting because this is
[1:06:45] another thing you have sermons on all
[1:06:47] the time is they shouted and the walls
[1:06:49] of Jericho came down that's exactly
[1:06:51] right but they shouted on the seventh
[1:06:53] day
[1:06:54] right and it was the shout that brought
[1:06:57] the walls of Jericho down no it wasn't
[1:06:58] just the shout heard a preacher say it
[1:07:01] the other day it was the shout that
[1:07:02] brings the walls of Jericho down no no
[1:07:04] did you forget that for the six days
[1:07:06] before the
[1:07:07] seventh they said everyone open not your
[1:07:14] mouth shut
[1:07:17] up Modern leontine Standard revised
[1:07:22] version for six days everybody shut
[1:07:27] up don't say
[1:07:32] nothing that was to me just as much a
[1:07:37] miracle I'm just
[1:07:40] saying six days you shutting up not
[1:07:43] saying
[1:07:44] anything that was just as much of a
[1:07:46] miracle as the big walls of Jericho
[1:07:48] coming down if I could have people and
[1:07:51] myself for six days do that I would be
[1:07:57] shouting it would be a
[1:07:59] miracle but he's saying shout up there's
[1:08:02] something in the training of sons in the
[1:08:05] promised land to get the perfect battle
[1:08:07] and Jericho was the perfect battle and
[1:08:10] that is shut your mouth and stop letting
[1:08:12] your tongue spill things that's not
[1:08:14] right let it be the fruit of
[1:08:16] Thanksgiving upon your lips let it be
[1:08:19] positive let it be the right thing let
[1:08:22] it say let it say God you're going to
[1:08:23] bring us through brother Bram that ain't
[1:08:25] nothing but the truth Let It Be Words of
[1:08:33] Life let it not be cursing one another
[1:08:36] and cursing other people and cursing
[1:08:39] denominational people get rid of the
[1:08:41] cursing let it be
[1:08:44] blessing nobody's going to get their
[1:08:46] tongues out control in this world nobody
[1:08:48] presidents politics they're lying
[1:08:50] through their lips all the time but
[1:08:52] somebody's got to get their tongue under
[1:08:54] the Holy
[1:08:55] Ghost and shut up and quit saying things
[1:08:59] that's demeaning to about other
[1:09:02] people quit being critical against the
[1:09:04] ministry quit being critical against
[1:09:07] your brother and
[1:09:08] sister say a blessing I said I spoke a
[1:09:11] few weeks ago say bless those that curse
[1:09:16] you they cursed you God I'm going to
[1:09:19] pray prayer I'm going to ask you to
[1:09:20] bless their lives bless them Lord the
[1:09:22] one who cursed me bless bless them
[1:09:24] Prosper
[1:09:25] them that's not a denominational
[1:09:30] teaching from a system that's sons of
[1:09:33] God
[1:09:34] teaching it's a miracle it was a miracle
[1:09:38] that happened and it wasn't just to
[1:09:40] shout because after six days of being
[1:09:43] quiet I guess they were ready to
[1:09:46] shout so all of you this week from
[1:09:48] Monday through Saturday shut your
[1:09:52] mouths don't say nothing unless it's
[1:09:55] edifying I just come up with that just
[1:09:57] now it's just a brand new idea six days
[1:10:00] don't say nothing out of these lips
[1:10:02] unless it's edifying and it's the fruits
[1:10:05] of Thanksgiving and gratefulness for
[1:10:07] what God has
[1:10:08] done and I'm just asking you what kind
[1:10:11] of service would we have next Sunday
[1:10:14] when you got a chance finally to open
[1:10:16] your
[1:10:22] mouth the Thanksgiving
[1:10:26] challenge that's even for uncle so- and
[1:10:28] so to shut his mouth at Thanksgiving
[1:10:31] dinner he ain't going to do
[1:10:34] it he says too
[1:10:36] much but we eat turkey with him anyway
[1:10:40] because we love him
[1:10:43] anyway James does not hold
[1:10:46] back letting us know the damage that the
[1:10:49] tongue can do can you say Amen the
[1:10:51] effects of it the perfect perfect man is
[1:10:54] not sinless Perfection but he is on his
[1:10:55] way and he's he's well on his way to
[1:10:58] Growing Up when his tongue is bridled by
[1:11:00] the Holy Ghost the same as a perfect man
[1:11:02] he may have SI weaknesses in other areas
[1:11:05] but he brings that ton under control the
[1:11:06] rest of the body will come come under
[1:11:08] control bridled by the Holy Ghost the
[1:11:10] tongue the Bible says how shall we be
[1:11:13] living how shall we be living and I'm
[1:11:15] wrapping this up now how shall we be
[1:11:17] living every day bringing the sacrifice
[1:11:20] of praise and the fruit of Thanksgiving
[1:11:23] upon our lips how shall Sons and
[1:11:27] Daughters be living every
[1:11:29] day this is what our tongue should be
[1:11:33] used for all the
[1:11:36] time you know Thanksgiving is not just a
[1:11:40] SE a
[1:11:41] season it's not just a day Thanksgiving
[1:11:45] to a Christian is a
[1:11:47] lifestyle when he says bring the
[1:11:49] sacrifice and praise it doesn't mean
[1:11:50] just when you come to church when he
[1:11:52] says bring the Thanksgiving to God upon
[1:11:54] your lips and that's the fruit of your
[1:11:55] lips it doesn't mean in church it
[1:11:57] doesn't mean just it means it's a
[1:12:00] lifestyle it's not a season it's a
[1:12:02] lifestyle Thanksgiving is not a day to
[1:12:05] Christians whoever is listening online
[1:12:08] the broadcast Thanksgiving is not just a
[1:12:10] day that for sports and for your turkey
[1:12:13] and all that to a Christian Thanksgiving
[1:12:15] is a lifestyle that it comes out of his
[1:12:17] lips I am so grateful to God and
[1:12:20] whatever I'm going through that same God
[1:12:22] will bring me through
[1:12:26] it you might say that a sign of mature
[1:12:28] Sons is a grateful heart and a grateful
[1:12:31] confession that's the contrast to
[1:12:33] immature Israel who were not grateful
[1:12:35] for all the works that God has done who
[1:12:37] showed their lack of thankfulness for
[1:12:39] what he had done by their murmuring and
[1:12:41] complaining constantly they were
[1:12:43] ungrateful children in the Old Testament
[1:12:46] for 40 years when you're wanting to grow
[1:12:49] into
[1:12:49] this then you might need to hang around
[1:12:52] people
[1:12:54] also who don't have negative complaining
[1:12:57] sarcastic ways about
[1:13:00] them there are people that you hang
[1:13:03] around that are sarcastic that they put
[1:13:04] down they belittle with their words and
[1:13:08] it's very comfortable for them to do
[1:13:09] that as I was talking to my son Solon
[1:13:11] saying they're just are people that are
[1:13:14] they're so used to drama and they're so
[1:13:16] used to negative talk and they're so
[1:13:18] used to gossip they feel uncomfortable
[1:13:21] when they're around an atmosphere that
[1:13:23] doesn't allow for
[1:13:26] gossip and we should make them feel that
[1:13:28] way may our church be always a place
[1:13:31] that people who want to have a norm of
[1:13:33] Gossip would feel
[1:13:37] uncomfortable will you join with
[1:13:42] me had a brother had a sister say I'm so
[1:13:46] glad to be out of that certain area and
[1:13:48] of course I wouldn't mention the area
[1:13:49] but there's just such gossip going on
[1:13:52] between the churches she said I'm just
[1:13:54] glad to be out of that atmosphere and
[1:13:56] away from that may we always be an
[1:13:59] assembly that holds to that that what
[1:14:02] comes out of our lips is for
[1:14:04] edification even a correction which I do
[1:14:07] it over the pulpit I've corrected some
[1:14:09] today I'm sure that I have but let it be
[1:14:11] done in love and let it be to edify your
[1:14:14] life correction can edify if it's done
[1:14:18] in the right
[1:14:19] Spirit but don't hang around people who
[1:14:22] are negative all the time complaining
[1:14:23] sarcastic beling
[1:14:26] words may we grow that Beyond Petty
[1:14:30] things let's be a church where gossipers
[1:14:33] are uncomfortable that it just don't
[1:14:35] work here there's too many good things
[1:14:38] to talk about and thank God
[1:14:41] for than to talk about the
[1:14:44] negative can we get an agreement that
[1:14:46] there's too many good things to talk
[1:14:48] about there's too much to do for the
[1:14:50] kingdom of God a lot of times the gospel
[1:14:53] ain't doing very much to the kingdom of
[1:14:54] God that's their job that's their
[1:14:56] position is to be a gossiper and to tear
[1:14:58] down what's taking place but there's too
[1:14:59] many good things to do for the kingdom
[1:15:01] get busy doing something for the kingdom
[1:15:03] of God instead of spending our times the
[1:15:06] fruit of our lips and Thanksgiving when
[1:15:08] it says a sacrifice of praise it's true
[1:15:12] in the Old Testament they had some they
[1:15:14] had a peace offering okay I don't have
[1:15:16] time for this but they had five
[1:15:18] offerings one was a peace offering and
[1:15:19] under the peace offering was actually a
[1:15:21] sacrifice of Thanksgiving you look it up
[1:15:23] look it up in your Bible so it's
[1:15:25] specific and then Paul brings it up in
[1:15:26] the New Testament bring the sacrifice of
[1:15:29] praise can you say Amen oh I loved it
[1:15:32] Wednesday night when brother Gideon said
[1:15:33] all of those blood of bulls and goats
[1:15:35] and all those sacrifices it didn't
[1:15:37] finish it they had to keep coming back
[1:15:38] to it all the time it didn't finish it
[1:15:40] but we have a sacrifice where he said it
[1:15:42] is
[1:15:43] finished glory be to God the work has
[1:15:46] been done that's why we can have the
[1:15:48] sacrifice of Thanksgiving the work has
[1:15:50] been done that's why we can be a happy
[1:15:52] people can I get your amen this morning
[1:15:55] that's why we can be happy it's a
[1:15:56] finished work at
[1:15:58] Calvary you can't add anything to
[1:16:02] it but we bring this sacrifice of praise
[1:16:05] because it is hard it's it's hard to
[1:16:08] bring the sacrifice of praise and lips
[1:16:10] of Thanksgiving when things are going
[1:16:14] hard that's why it's a sacrifice because
[1:16:17] it's hard to do it doing it when it
[1:16:19] don't come natural doing it during the
[1:16:21] bad times
[1:16:24] it seems to become more natural for us
[1:16:27] to complain and be negative and curse it
[1:16:29] comes more natural but when we let our
[1:16:31] words be bridled to only speak right
[1:16:34] things that is a sacrifice and that's
[1:16:36] why I said bring the sacrifice of praise
[1:16:38] you can relate it to church when you
[1:16:40] come and you don't feel like coming to
[1:16:41] church you're tired you're worn out um
[1:16:44] the kids have been screaming the whole
[1:16:46] way in the car you don't feel very
[1:16:48] spiritual to come in and give the praise
[1:16:51] but that's when it's the sacrifice of
[1:16:52] praise I don't care what I feel right
[1:16:54] now I'm bringing it to the Lord and and
[1:16:57] Paul said Peter said here with such
[1:17:01] sacrifices good communication good words
[1:17:04] with such sacrifices God is well
[1:17:08] pleased that's that's adoption that God
[1:17:12] is pleased with his sons that's
[1:17:14] adoption Thanksgiving is not a you know
[1:17:17] there's only two things in the Old
[1:17:18] Testament that we bring we have the
[1:17:19] ultimate sacrifice but there's only
[1:17:21] places two places where it's says what
[1:17:23] we bring we present our bodies a Living
[1:17:25] Sacrifice we don't die he died for us
[1:17:28] but we present our bodies a Living
[1:17:29] Sacrifice and we bring the sacrifice of
[1:17:31] praise
[1:17:32] continually it's not a season it's a
[1:17:34] lifestyle it's not a day it's not a
[1:17:36] turkey it's a lifestyle of a Believer
[1:17:39] maturing the tongue is used to brag on
[1:17:43] Jesus Christ can I get an amen the
[1:17:46] tongue is used for one thing that's to
[1:17:48] brag on Jesus Christ and bring Glory
[1:17:50] unto his name so so I'd like to read the
[1:17:53] Thanksgiving story this will be a short
[1:17:55] one for the children I hope you're
[1:17:56] listening I hope everybody's listening
[1:17:57] you know why they came over right to
[1:17:59] receive religious freedom to worship the
[1:18:01] Lord according to the dictates over
[1:18:03] their heart they come all the way over
[1:18:04] from Europe because they wanted to be
[1:18:06] able to worship God freely but it was a
[1:18:10] hard time in September 1620 a small ship
[1:18:13] called the mayflower left Plymouth
[1:18:15] England carrying 1002 passengers that's
[1:18:18] it that's actually about probably what
[1:18:20] we got here today and an assortment of
[1:18:23] religious separatists seeking a new home
[1:18:26] where they could freely practice their
[1:18:27] faith and other individuals lured by the
[1:18:29] promise of prosperity and land ownership
[1:18:32] in the new world after a treacherous and
[1:18:34] uncomfortable Crossing that lasted 66
[1:18:36] days they dropped anchor near the tip of
[1:18:39] Cape C far north of their intended
[1:18:41] destination at the mouth of the Hudson R
[1:18:43] River one month later the Mayflower
[1:18:46] crossed Massachusetts bay where the
[1:18:47] pilgrims as they are now commonly known
[1:18:50] begin to the work of establishing of
[1:18:52] Village at Plymouth throughout that Brut
[1:18:55] first brutal winter most of the
[1:18:58] colonists remained on board the ship
[1:19:00] where they suffered from exposure scurvy
[1:19:03] and outbreaks of contagious disease also
[1:19:06] they had hardly any
[1:19:09] food only half of the mayflower's
[1:19:12] original passengers and crew lived to
[1:19:14] see their first New England spring so
[1:19:17] you got 102 half of them are gone it's
[1:19:21] pretty discouraging
[1:19:24] not much to be thankful for it
[1:19:27] seemed but God was watching over his
[1:19:31] people God had it in his mind to start a
[1:19:34] new
[1:19:35] nation you don't think God was in that
[1:19:37] it was in his
[1:19:40] plan and so after these hardships then
[1:19:44] losing half the people starving I just
[1:19:46] want to say to the kids today and all of
[1:19:48] us we're going to eat pretty good in a
[1:19:50] little bit here in about half hour
[1:19:53] we're not going to have a lack you
[1:19:55] didn't starve this week you didn't have
[1:19:56] a lack of food in your home if you did
[1:19:59] let me know I can help you out we're not
[1:20:01] lacking in this country still not at all
[1:20:04] right we're abundantly blessed but the
[1:20:06] Trap is is that when you're abundantly
[1:20:08] bless you do like Israel you
[1:20:11] forget to be
[1:20:14] grateful for the food that we have you
[1:20:17] forget to be
[1:20:18] thankful for the body of Christ I think
[1:20:22] we should be grateful that we have a
[1:20:23] place to
[1:20:26] come and if you're grateful for it
[1:20:28] you'll
[1:20:30] come I think we should be thankful that
[1:20:33] we still have preachers that'll tell us
[1:20:34] like it
[1:20:35] is
[1:20:37] amen I think we should be and when we
[1:20:39] lose our grateful forness gratefulness
[1:20:42] for that then we lose a lot because then
[1:20:45] we realize when we go out we realize
[1:20:47] that the food isn't quite there to feed
[1:20:50] our souls and so we have to be grateful
[1:20:54] in our hearts for the things and only
[1:20:56] half of the Mayflower original
[1:20:57] passengers and crew lived to see their
[1:20:58] first spring in March the remaining
[1:21:00] settlers moved to sh where they received
[1:21:02] an astonishing visit from a member of
[1:21:05] the H I'm not going to pronounce these
[1:21:07] Indian tribes
[1:21:08] correctly uh but the abanaki tribe who
[1:21:12] greeted them in English several days
[1:21:13] later he returned with another Native
[1:21:15] American Squanto a member of the how do
[1:21:18] you say it rap Paul tux
[1:21:21] it what really I get an A for
[1:21:26] that PA tux tribe who had been kidnapped
[1:21:30] by the English sea captain and sold into
[1:21:32] slavery before escaping London and
[1:21:34] returned to his homeland as an
[1:21:35] exploratory Expedition Squanto taught
[1:21:37] the pilgrims weaken by malnutrition and
[1:21:40] illness how to cultivate corn extract
[1:21:42] sap from the maple tree apple maple
[1:21:44] trees catch fish in the rivers and avoid
[1:21:46] poisonous plants he also helped the
[1:21:48] settlers Forge an alliance with the
[1:21:54] another
[1:21:55] a a local tribe which endured more than
[1:21:58] 50 years and remains one of the sole
[1:22:00] examples of Harmony between European
[1:22:01] colonists and Native Americans in
[1:22:04] November 1621 in the fall then after the
[1:22:06] Pilgrim's first Corn Harvest proved
[1:22:09] successful Governor William Bradford
[1:22:11] organized A celebratory feast and
[1:22:13] invited a group of fledging colonies
[1:22:15] Native American Allies in all the
[1:22:18] different including the and chief
[1:22:20] massoit now remember as America's first
[1:22:23] Thanksgiving although the pilgrims theel
[1:22:25] may not have used this term at the time
[1:22:28] the festival lasted for 3 days I would
[1:22:31] love for this Festival this week to last
[1:22:33] every day for a whole week can anybody
[1:22:39] stay my kids will tell you I will not
[1:22:42] let them put up any lights or nothing
[1:22:44] for Christmas until after Thanksgiving
[1:22:46] because I think the greatest American
[1:22:49] holiday the true Christian holiday gets
[1:22:51] smothered over over by the Heathen
[1:22:58] one that being
[1:23:00] said next Friday after Thanksgiving we
[1:23:03] will be putting up a few
[1:23:06] lights just let it out there let the
[1:23:09] whole message
[1:23:14] know no Santas but we're going to have
[1:23:17] some lights and some things and more
[1:23:20] food
[1:23:21] hopefully
[1:23:23] it wasn't called Thanksgiving then kids
[1:23:25] it was just called a day to thank the
[1:23:28] Lord because guess what when you've gone
[1:23:30] through times where you didn't have food
[1:23:33] you didn't have a lot of money and half
[1:23:35] of your people died in front of
[1:23:37] you that makes you thankful that I had a
[1:23:40] better year this year I've got a little
[1:23:43] change I'm I'm not hungry I've got
[1:23:46] food it made them so grateful that they
[1:23:49] had food they said let's have a
[1:23:51] celebration and let's have the fruit of
[1:23:55] Thanksgiving to the Lord upon our lips
[1:23:59] and tell him how much we thank him for
[1:24:04] there are times friends we need to do it
[1:24:06] right now we need to tell the
[1:24:10] Lord how much he's done for
[1:24:16] us we need to tell the
[1:24:19] Lord and I'm going to have them I have a
[1:24:21] few thanks to things I have some slides
[1:24:23] coming up here just few of them of the
[1:24:25] trip but I think we should close our
[1:24:28] eyes and speak to the Lord right now and
[1:24:30] thank him for the things that we never
[1:24:32] thank him
[1:24:33] for Why Don't We Stand and I'll have you
[1:24:35] sit again after but let's
[1:24:41] stand thanks thanks I give you
