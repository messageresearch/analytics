[0:21] you my friend and may the music and
[0:23] message encourage you today I come to
[0:27] the garden
[0:34] Al while
[0:37] the is still on the
[0:43] [Music]
[0:43] [Applause]
[0:45] rose and the
[0:47] voice I
[0:50] hear falling
[0:52] on my
[0:55] ear the
[0:58] son of
[1:01] God
[1:02] [Music]
[1:07] discloses
[1:09] and he
[1:12] walks with me and he
[1:17] talks with
[1:19] me and he
[1:22] tells me I am his
[1:28] own
[1:31] and the
[1:32] joy we
[1:35] share as we
[1:40] take none
[1:43] other has
[1:49] ever Ephesians chapter 1 starting at
[1:53] Verse 18 the eyes of your understanding
[1:57] being enlightened that ye may know what
[2:00] is the hope of his calling and what is
[2:03] the riches of the glory of his
[2:05] inheritance in the Saints and what is
[2:08] the exceeding greatness of his power to
[2:10] us word who believe according to the
[2:13] working of his mighty power which he
[2:16] wrought in Christ when he raised him
[2:19] from the dead can you say Amen so this
[2:22] power is what raised Jesus from the dead
[2:25] when he raised him from the dead and set
[2:28] him in his own it own right hand in
[2:31] Heavenly places far above all
[2:35] principality and power and might and
[2:38] dominion and every name that is named
[2:41] not only in this world but also in that
[2:44] which is to come and hath put all things
[2:48] under his feet and gave him to be the
[2:50] head over all things to the church which
[2:53] is his body the fullness of him that
[2:56] filth all in all praise the Lord today
[2:59] today we celebrate the morning that our
[3:02] Lord rose from the grave and uh it's
[3:05] celebrated around the world and we're
[3:07] thankful for that we're thankful that
[3:09] people in the world acknowledge a lot of
[3:11] people acknowledge that he rose again
[3:14] there's some who don't believe it some
[3:15] that need proof and uh but there's some
[3:18] who are believers that believe he rose
[3:20] and this is the day that most of the
[3:21] world gives to celebrate the Lord
[3:23] raising from the grave and coming out of
[3:25] the grave and that when he come out of
[3:28] the Grave was a fin
[3:30] Vindication and proof that he was truly
[3:34] everything that the word said about him
[3:37] that was the Vindication that was the
[3:39] proof that he was truly everything the
[3:41] word said about him there had to be a a
[3:44] proof to it uh we can say a lot of
[3:47] things but then people wait for the
[3:48] proof Jesus said things but he had the
[3:51] proof and he followed up with
[3:52] Vindication and so when he rose that was
[3:55] everything that was the Vindication and
[3:57] that was the proof that truly all the
[3:59] word had said about him uh and what he
[4:02] had proclaimed while he was on the earth
[4:04] uh in a Ministry three and a half years
[4:05] what he had proclaimed it came to pass
[4:08] and he said in three days if you destroy
[4:10] this body if you if you put this in the
[4:12] ground if you destroy this temple in
[4:14] three days I'll raise it up again and he
[4:16] proved what he said was true let me say
[4:18] something to everybody this morning God
[4:21] has never failed when he speaks
[4:23] something God has never failed his word
[4:26] and it always has come to pass and it
[4:28] always will God has a perfect track
[4:31] record people will fail you and you may
[4:34] have a lack of trust in people but we
[4:36] can trust God cuz his word has always
[4:38] come to pass and the resurrection is the
[4:40] proof of that what Jesus said and what
[4:43] the word said he would do we know that
[4:46] it came to pass and we're celebrating
[4:48] that this morning we we want to go into
[4:49] the subject a little bit what Paul says
[4:51] here in Ephesians and uh by the world
[4:55] knowing that it's the Resurrection
[4:56] Sunday we also know some other things at
[4:58] least most of us
[5:00] we know that Jesus uh was both humanity
[5:04] and Divinity together how many believe
[5:06] that Jesus was both humanity and
[5:09] Divinity together as one man and uh we
[5:14] we realize that the Bible says that the
[5:16] fullness the fullness of the godhead
[5:19] bodily was in him bodily in other words
[5:21] all of God was poured into that vessel
[5:24] and and so people don't understand and I
[5:26] just say to you don't try to figure that
[5:28] out don't try to figure it out in your
[5:30] own mind anyway because when you try to
[5:32] figure out a man that has full Divinity
[5:35] and fully a man don't try to figure it
[5:38] out because you're going to get it all
[5:39] messed up hence Nia 3:25 ad they got it
[5:44] messed up they were trying to figure out
[5:46] how God was in man and when man gets his
[5:49] intellect that's how we get messed up
[5:51] with splitting him into three different
[5:53] persons let me tell you don't try to
[5:55] figure that out with your mind ask God
[5:57] for a revelation of it can I get an amen
[6:00] this morning it comes by Revelation that
[6:02] we would even come close to
[6:04] understanding how man was full Divinity
[6:07] and how he's full humanity and so we
[6:10] know that but we also know that at the
[6:12] end of Jesus life there uh there was a
[6:16] very much of The Human Side displayed as
[6:19] a matter of fact as he come to the last
[6:21] days of his life and the last hours of
[6:24] his life if you know your Bible you
[6:26] realize Jesus when he come to the very
[6:28] end there was very much human in it uh
[6:31] when when he come to the tragic court
[6:34] case when he was accused in court he was
[6:36] an innocent man and he was falsely
[6:38] accused when he come to the brutal
[6:40] treatment of his body when he come to
[6:42] the crucifixion and in a few moments I
[6:45] might elaborate on that a little bit
[6:46] knowing that it was Good Friday this
[6:48] past Friday and we we look at that we
[6:50] want to understand those things but his
[6:52] life at the end came to a turn that even
[6:55] the disciples didn't understand with the
[6:57] brutality and the crucifixion and the
[6:59] scourging and the mocking and the making
[7:02] fun of and he he lived the the the last
[7:05] days of his life and you can't find God
[7:08] in any of it now early in his life when
[7:10] he started his ministry you could find
[7:12] God the supernatural God was working
[7:14] through his words in other words he'd
[7:15] speak and the blind eyes would be open
[7:17] he would touch people and they'd be
[7:19] completely healed numerous Miracles took
[7:22] place in the Supernatural God was
[7:24] speaking to him God brought him up to
[7:25] the Mount Transfiguration and said this
[7:27] is my son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[7:29] well so God was there but at the end of
[7:31] his life there's not many traces of God
[7:34] because God actually he was there but he
[7:37] withdrew himself because this man had to
[7:40] go to Calvary as our lamb and he had to
[7:43] go to Calvary as a man because God
[7:47] couldn't be killed God could not see be
[7:49] displayed in our eyes anyway in this
[7:51] defeat in this scourging and and we know
[7:54] the story is that the disciples are
[7:56] wondering and and they're saying even in
[7:58] the I think the garden is saying can't
[8:00] you call for help all the soldiers
[8:02] everybody's taking can't you call for
[8:04] help and Jesus said don't you think that
[8:06] I could call for thousands of Legions of
[8:08] angels and they would come and change us
[8:11] and he said but that the scripture might
[8:12] fulfill so there was an obedience to
[8:15] what the Bible said can you say am man
[8:18] had to be fulfilled and in that moment
[8:21] God as it in our terms withdrew
[8:26] himself and so we we know that it was
[8:30] God in man but yet we see this this
[8:32] withdrawal because he had to go to
[8:35] Calvary as our lamb and uh in the last
[8:39] hours in the very last hours he even
[8:41] with went without without any
[8:43] intervention of God at the cross there
[8:44] wasn't any intervention of God we're
[8:46] saying God God don't let this happen but
[8:49] you see the scripture had to be
[8:50] fulfilled and we had to be
[8:53] saved we needed a
[8:57] sacrifice you couldn't do it on your you
[8:59] weren't worthy enough no man was worthy
[9:03] enough somebody had to do it for
[9:06] us and so that's the reason there was no
[9:09] intervention of God in this act is
[9:11] because and in fact in fact he was so
[9:13] much left alone that he cried himself at
[9:17] the cross my God my God why has Thou
[9:22] forsaken me you remember he said that so
[9:25] this is evidence that he's feeling it he
[9:28] knows and he's crying out why have you
[9:31] forsaken that's the man crying out
[9:33] because he had to live in that moment
[9:36] that he felt forsaken even by God I'd
[9:39] asked for a raise of hands this morning
[9:40] how many has felt that way
[9:43] yourself he had to live where he's
[9:46] saying God why have you forsaken me God
[9:48] what where are you God why and and in
[9:52] worldly terms the last of Jesus life
[9:55] felt like a defeat over and over again
[9:57] there was no God in it it felt defeated
[10:00] it was defeat in Man's eyes but see see
[10:03] this morning let the record show that
[10:05] The Final End was not defeat and that's
[10:08] why we talk about the resurrection
[10:10] because as much defeat was there as much
[10:14] as God hath withdrawn himself I like the
[10:17] song that the choir saying Jehovah
[10:20] Jehovah has the final
[10:23] say can I get an amen this morning and
[10:26] I'm glad to say that the final end was
[10:28] not a defeat but the final end was a
[10:33] victory the final end was not all of
[10:36] this uh being forsaken by God but you
[10:39] see the the there was not a defeat but
[10:42] when when the body was dead and in the
[10:45] grave and that was it and in a dark uh
[10:48] cold uh grave with the Stone Road in
[10:51] front of it the power of God moved on
[10:54] that body and resurrected that body can
[10:57] you say praise the Lord Jehovah had the
[11:00] final say am I just want to say to you
[11:05] when God's involved he'll have the final
[11:08] say of every every
[11:10] situation of every
[11:13] condition come on I should have get a
[11:16] bigger amen than that I know when you're
[11:18] dark and under a tunnel of something and
[11:20] under just under something it's hard for
[11:22] you to say Amen to that but you should
[11:23] say Amen because God has a perfect track
[11:25] record and when he's involved he gets
[11:27] the final say and I can tell you he's
[11:30] going to cause us to end in
[11:33] Victory and if he did it at the cross
[11:35] and he did it here in Jesus life then we
[11:38] find that there was a power and this is
[11:40] what he says in Ephesians there was a
[11:42] power that come upon and set Jesus it
[11:45] was so powerful that it come on his body
[11:47] and raised him from the dead far above
[11:50] principalities and power so there was
[11:53] the power that raised him and and he did
[11:55] not just raise out of the grave and and
[11:59] and then walk back into the same
[12:01] conditions again did you realize when
[12:04] God raised him when the power of God
[12:05] raised him up he did not just come back
[12:08] to earth again now we know that he
[12:10] walked a few days on Earth but this
[12:12] power did not keep him this power he
[12:15] actually went to hell he he he he he
[12:17] seen the soul preach to the souls in
[12:19] prison but then the power was still on
[12:21] him he raised he raised past the grave
[12:24] he raised past the Earth he didn't come
[12:26] back into the same conditions again can
[12:28] you amen then the Bible says he raised
[12:31] far above and that's my message to you
[12:33] this morning when God raised him he
[12:35] raised far above the conditions again
[12:38] far above the Earth can you say Amen far
[12:41] above defeat somebody say praise the
[12:43] Lord how far did he raise him above
[12:46] principalities above Powers he broke
[12:48] through every demonic Dimension can you
[12:50] say am man this power was powerful
[12:53] enough to break through
[12:56] anything how far did he raise them above
[12:58] principalities above power above might
[13:00] Dominion every name that is named the
[13:03] most famous name we've ever had in the
[13:05] world the Caesars even famous names
[13:07] today God raised his name above every
[13:10] name not only in this world but also in
[13:12] the world to come and hath put all
[13:15] things under his feet I'm telling you
[13:19] this power raised him far above
[13:22] everything now he didn't just raise out
[13:24] of the Grave he didn't walk back into
[13:26] the same conditions which reminds me of
[13:28] some people that come to church and hear
[13:30] the power of God and don't respond and
[13:33] walk back into their same conditions
[13:36] again might be a lesson for us how many
[13:39] know the Bible says as Jesus talked
[13:41] about he says a man he said he the house
[13:44] can be cleaned and when the house is
[13:46] Sanctified cuz see sanctification isn't
[13:50] enough amen I could use a little bit
[13:53] more help this morning sanctification
[13:56] isn't enough got a lot of people that
[13:59] come under the presence of God get
[14:00] Sanctified they feel good they feel
[14:01] better their Spirits have been released
[14:03] from them but that's not the final step
[14:05] can you say amen he walks through Dry
[14:08] places and if he don't get that house
[14:10] filled seven other demons will come and
[14:13] fill that I'm speaking about what Jesus
[14:15] said that's how it works and so I'll
[14:17] tell you Jesus was not just raised back
[14:20] to Earthly conditions if he'd have
[14:22] showed up the same way they would have
[14:24] continued the persecution they would
[14:26] have continued the things and and all
[14:28] that he was doing being persecuted of
[14:30] but I can tell you God had to raise him
[14:33] above the persecution above the defeat
[14:36] above Earthly conditions amen far above
[14:41] how many this morning got things that
[14:43] you've been through you like to be
[14:45] lifted far above those things he didn't
[14:49] just raise out of the Grave he didn't
[14:51] walk back into the same conditions the
[14:53] power of Resurrection moved in actually
[14:56] in a place far above all things to a
[14:58] position position at the right hand of
[15:00] authority of God in a place called
[15:05] Heavenly
[15:07] places this is where the power of God
[15:10] that took the dead body of Jesus and
[15:13] raised him far above defeat and raised
[15:17] them past principalities far above and
[15:20] placed them in a place called Heavenly
[15:25] places and we've been taught by the word
[15:27] of God that that is not a feeling it's
[15:29] not a sensation I love the presence of
[15:32] God I Fe I felt it I know that it's real
[15:35] but when he said Heavenly places it's
[15:37] not a feeling it's not that it gives us
[15:39] tingles can you say am man Heavenly
[15:41] places is the believer's position in
[15:44] Jesus
[15:45] Christ somebody say praise the
[15:48] Lord he lifted Jesus to Heavenly places
[15:52] and I don't know if anybody noticed uh
[15:55] and scanned while I was reading about
[15:57] Jesus coming to Heaven place you
[15:59] probably didn't read it but I'm going to
[16:00] bring it up if you got your Bibles and
[16:02] if you don't they're going to have to
[16:03] bring it up back there I want you to go
[16:05] to Ephesians 1 back a few verses to
[16:08] verse three where it says blessed be the
[16:12] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[16:15] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[16:20] blessings in Heavenly places in
[16:27] Christ did any anybody notice that the
[16:30] same place Jesus was raised to is the
[16:33] same place Paul's teaching that every
[16:35] believer who has the Holy Ghost has been
[16:37] raised into Heavenly
[16:39] places we got the same position and
[16:42] guess what most Christians don't know it
[16:44] that's right most Christians live below
[16:46] their privileges now I want to emphasize
[16:48] that because below your privileges is
[16:50] not where you're supposed to be
[16:54] living young people everybody below your
[16:57] priv privileges is not where you're
[16:59] supposed to be living if we only see our
[17:02] conditions of our broken Families Our
[17:04] corrupt
[17:06] world it's more it's more than clear to
[17:08] us our conditions we can see all of that
[17:11] we can see the the state that we're in
[17:14] if that's all we're looking at then
[17:15] we're doomed we need to see what Calvary
[17:18] has done for us and what the
[17:19] resurrection has done for us and that's
[17:22] what he's going to say here we need to
[17:23] see what count we needs our eyes
[17:27] enlightened that we know what Calvary
[17:29] has done for us and we know what the
[17:31] resurrection has done for
[17:33] us that's what I'm preaching to you this
[17:35] morning that do you know what Calvary
[17:37] has done for you do you or or is it just
[17:41] a
[17:42] symbolism do you know what Calvary has
[17:45] done for you and your condition and do
[17:49] you know what the power of the
[17:51] Resurrection can do for you in your
[17:54] condition who hath believed our report
[17:56] who to whom is the arm of the Lord
[17:58] revealed for he shall grow up before him
[18:00] as a tender plant and as a root out of a
[18:03] dry ground he hath no form nor
[18:05] comeliness and when we shall see him
[18:07] there is no beauty that we should desire
[18:09] him he's talking about Christ here when
[18:11] he comes prophecy he was despised and
[18:14] rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and
[18:17] acquainted with grief now notice this is
[18:20] the mighty conqueror no before he was
[18:22] the mighty conqueror he went through
[18:25] this what for for
[18:27] you
[18:29] and what was he going through what was
[18:30] he feeling those last few days he was
[18:33] despised he was rejected anybody ever
[18:35] been rejected before he was despised and
[18:38] rejected of men a Man of Sorrows
[18:41] acquainted with grief and we hid as it
[18:44] were our faces from him he was despised
[18:46] and we esteemed him not surely he hath
[18:48] borne our
[18:51] Grieves how is this tied together he
[18:54] bore the things that we would
[18:57] bear he he felt everything that we would
[19:02] feel he had to feel it he had to feel
[19:06] what it meant to be lonely he had to
[19:09] feel friends rejecting him even his own
[19:11] disciples he had to feel being lonely
[19:15] without anybody in the world but just
[19:16] himself he had to feel that because why
[19:20] you would feel
[19:23] that and frankly friends you would never
[19:27] be able to tell God he doesn't
[19:31] understand what I'm going
[19:35] through and there might be some people
[19:37] in here that have said that to God God
[19:39] just this is new he doesn't understand
[19:41] why I'm going I'm here to correct you
[19:43] about that because if this is our
[19:45] perfect lamb he experienced what life
[19:48] would be for
[19:50] us and he bore it can you say amen he
[19:53] borne our griefs he carried our sorrows
[19:56] yet we did esteem him smitten stricken
[19:59] smitten of God and Afflicted but he was
[20:01] wounded for our transgressions he was
[20:03] bruised for our iniquities the
[20:05] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[20:08] and with his stripes we are healed I'm
[20:11] adding in verse six all we like sheep
[20:14] have gone astray we have turned everyone
[20:17] to his own way and the Lord hath laid on
[20:20] him the iniquity of us all so let me
[20:22] tell you something that scripture tells
[20:24] you you're not in a different category
[20:25] in the sense of your human flesh all we
[20:28] all of us that covers all kind of covers
[20:31] everybody I don't care how much pride
[20:33] you have all we like sheep have gone
[20:36] astray am all of us in our own self are
[20:39] weak can you say Amen we've made
[20:41] mistakes we've made blunders even if
[20:43] you've hid them very well you're like a
[20:45] sheep that has gone astray and you will
[20:46] always go astray unless the Shepherd
[20:49] gets a hold of your life and all the
[20:51] sheep that have gone astray the answer
[20:54] is one thing and that's this lamb that's
[20:56] going to Calvary that whatever way way
[20:58] we have
[21:00] strayed he's given us a
[21:04] sacrifice that we can come back to and
[21:06] say God you did it for me he has a
[21:10] struggle in the garden and you know what
[21:11] the struggle was over God's will or his
[21:14] own
[21:17] will it was pretty
[21:19] intense because he was sweating and he
[21:22] his his his face had become so intense
[21:25] from the pressure and that battle of his
[21:28] own will that it was like great sweat
[21:32] drops of of blood and science says it
[21:35] got so intense that it turns into some
[21:37] blood sweat turns into blood that's the
[21:39] first time he shed his blood and guess
[21:42] what it was related to a struggle over
[21:44] his own will and God's Will has anybody
[21:46] ever had the same
[21:49] struggle is it
[21:52] tense
[21:56] yes in the court on under pilate he's
[21:59] being falsely accused he's being
[22:02] ridiculed he's being made fun of he's
[22:04] being
[22:05] mopped there's a robe put on him to mock
[22:09] him as being King a purple robe and then
[22:11] the crown of thorns the next place he
[22:14] sheds blood a crown of thorns is crushed
[22:16] where where crushed in His Head Shed
[22:20] blood came
[22:22] from his
[22:27] head anyone ever had any battles in your
[22:32] mind anyone having them today you don't
[22:35] have to raise your hand but I'd say if
[22:37] you live in this world you have the
[22:39] battle of the
[22:42] mind this age is mental this age is
[22:45] going insane people can't think straight
[22:49] it's everything a Believer could do can
[22:51] keep his heart in the word of God to
[22:52] keep his own sound thinking and I'm here
[22:54] to tell you the atonement and the shed
[22:56] blood of Jesus Christ addressed
[22:58] everything condition of this Modern
[23:00] Age he paid the price for you he shed
[23:03] blood in that area this the mental
[23:06] conditions the insanity the addictions
[23:08] of the Mind the pornography and he shed
[23:11] blood there in his head nobody those
[23:13] soldiers didn't know what they were
[23:15] doing when they crushed it in and blood
[23:16] came out of his head now we know what he
[23:18] was doing now we know what was taking
[23:20] now we know why he had to shed blood
[23:21] from
[23:24] there maybe you can remember that this
[23:26] week when the devil's got
[23:29] in a tail spin in your mind come on
[23:32] people maybe you can remember what this
[23:35] preacher has said to you that God did
[23:37] something for you God shed blood for
[23:40] that he shed blood at the whipping post
[23:42] 39 Stripes that's another place he shed
[23:45] blood and that's when uh anyone ever
[23:47] being wounded deeply like that and it
[23:50] was in his back the pieces of metal and
[23:52] different things put at the end of the
[23:54] whip so that it's not just a whipping in
[23:56] a normal sense but that it would cut the
[23:58] the Flesh and open up his flesh and all
[24:00] that is about opening up a wound and all
[24:03] these wounds where the flesh was just
[24:05] hanging down his back and we know we
[24:08] know if that person survived it'll take
[24:11] a long time but their the body would
[24:13] heal itself most of the time they died
[24:16] but they didn't want them to die they
[24:17] wanted to suffer so there was a long
[24:20] healing
[24:22] process to Stripes going in his
[24:26] back but it was that it was it was it
[24:30] was looking ahead because Isaiah says he
[24:34] was wounded for our transgressions he
[24:37] was bruised for our iniquity and by his
[24:42] stripes we receive
[24:45] healing somebody raise your hand if
[24:47] you're sick this morning by his stripes
[24:48] I'm Healed he already paid the price for
[24:50] my
[24:51] healing and though that would take days
[24:54] months to heal that back you've seen it
[24:56] in movies sometimes when it took days
[24:58] and uh months and sometimes years to get
[25:00] a full healing to that back and
[25:02] sometimes healing is a process but I can
[25:04] tell you it's not just the body
[25:06] naturally healing itself God provided in
[25:09] his atonement that for any sickness any
[25:11] cancer any disease we're not afraid of
[25:14] any of it cuz he paid the price for any
[25:16] disease to be healed somebody say Amen
[25:18] this
[25:20] morning it's might what what my Lord
[25:23] means to me this morning he means so
[25:25] much more to me and then the shed Blood
[25:27] on the cross
[25:30] pierced his
[25:31] side Nails in his hands and in his feet
[25:34] blood of course came forth from there
[25:36] but then they pierced aside and blood
[25:38] and water and Spirit came out and that's
[25:40] an important thing because we realize
[25:43] when when when his Spirit came out of
[25:44] him
[25:46] it praise the Lord the blood cell had to
[25:49] be broken and something had to come out
[25:50] of him why because we needed that same
[25:55] Spirit to be able to live how many
[25:58] needed that Holy Ghost that come out of
[26:00] him the blood cell had to be broken so
[26:03] it would come out of him and come back
[26:05] on the day of Pentecost and fill the
[26:07] Believers he shed blood so you could
[26:09] have the Holy Ghost this was the most
[26:11] cruel death that had ever taken place in
[26:13] history this was cruelty he was mocked
[26:16] he was spit in the face he was innocent
[26:19] but he was falsely accused he was made
[26:20] fun of two reasons why they there was
[26:23] such cruelity in this
[26:25] death he had to feel what extreme abuse
[26:29] he had to be
[26:31] abused because there would be
[26:33] people in this generation especially
[26:37] that were abused sexually abused
[26:40] mentally
[26:41] abused emotionally
[26:45] abused physically
[26:48] abused he had to be abused he had to be
[26:51] scored he had to be mocked he had to
[26:54] made be made fun of can you say am man
[26:56] and it was extreme cruelty because he
[26:59] had to feel extreme abuse and cruelty
[27:01] and what it felt like so that you could
[27:03] never go to him to say God you don't
[27:05] understand he understands cuz he felt he
[27:07] felt he felt that cruelty it was
[27:09] secondly an extremely cruel death
[27:12] because
[27:13] sin is Relentless sin is the most
[27:17] cruelty that can come to a human being I
