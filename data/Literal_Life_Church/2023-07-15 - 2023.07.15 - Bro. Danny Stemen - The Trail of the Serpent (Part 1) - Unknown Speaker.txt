========================================

Lord Jesus we love you and what a privilege it is father to to be here with brother Paul and his family and his church to see what you have done father Lord that you have a work that you have established and are doing Lord and it's it's just our desire father that Lord we would let you have your way Lord that you would use Me For Your Glory not my own father that you would anoint my lips and anoint the ears of the year Lord I can only speak as what you have laid upon me but father you do the directing father may you have your way we already know Lord that the that your spirit is here there's liberty father and father may you just Lord go to that need whether it be sick Lord be a something that is bound to life something that can't move forward with God but Lord You're the same yesterday today and forever and I pray father you'll speak to that need in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you this evening if you just turn in your Bibles and amen I had determined that when I come I know some folks that are here and that some of them are my relatives and amen and I God bless you brother Joe and sister I I told myself I wasn't going to start calling names because I'm not going to remember them all and it's a certain age that you get brother Mark that you don't remember everything anymore but you're not laughing but some of us understand that better by and by right amen God is good amen and I appreciate him appreciate his love to me appreciate how he has dealt with me over the years and he's been very gracious to me and my my mistakes and my failures to help me and I trust that that he can use what we have Amen to help you amen grow closer to God Amen let's just turn to Isaiah 14. [Music] I want to read some very familiar scriptures to you Isaiah 14. verse 12 we'll read down to the 17th verse how art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for you have said in your heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the North I'll Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a Wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that open not the house of his prisoners amen so we see that Satan has made a declaration it's been exposed amen anybody's made a declaration that he would be like God be recognized like God but then God makes a declaration to say they that see thee shall say is this the man I don't call him God call him a man amen let's turn to Second Thessalonians 2 verse 1. if you're there Say Amen all right I've always wondered when somebody says that there's always somebody that's not there even if somebody says amen so anyway I'm there now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as at the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come of Falling Away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalted himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God you can be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word I had took a thought from something brother Branham had mentioned and that was at the end of his um coming down to the end of his ministry he had referenced that he was going to go home and that he was going to preach on the trail of the serpent and so I began to look at those quotes and if you just uh uh if you just bear with me I'm going to title this I'm not trying to copy the prophet I'm just it's a good title so I want to use it and he said it would take about four hours um and I know you're still in Ireland but uh it's not going to take four hours um but with the Lord help us we just want to walk down this this thought if we cannot title it the trail of the serpent and I want to say to you some very familiar things you recognize them when I quote it to you but it's necessary uh so you can see the direction that we are going in uh Paul or brother Branham said that Isaiah saw the desire of Satan's heart and and he exposed it he said that you have said in your heart that you'll be like God and so here is a prophet exposing and this is one of the the great tools of God is is under the prophetic to expose where the enemy is amen because the enemy uh the enemy is a liar is that right this is his greatest weapon is a lie so if it's a lie it's not true and so we can understand that when when the prophet begin to expose him exposing the LIE is actually stripping him of any advantage that he might have over the ones he said he would be above because he made that statement I'll be above the sons of God I'm going to sit in their position I'm going to be worshiped and even mistaken for amen the almighty God amen and so so here is a prophet exposing this and brother Branham said Isaiah shows what's in his heart and he said Paul sees him come and take that position so you have thousands of years ago a prophet exposing his heart and then hundreds of years later another Prophet amen showing him here he's coming to his position but he did not come to that position until it's now our time now now God sends a prophet not just for us to say I have sent you a prophet but he sends you a prophecy so you can know the season you can know the time amen that Satan is once again exposed and laid bare before the congregation that's your estimation of him will go from being Godlike to somebody's whose abilities is just a man you know because Satan takes a hold and I'm speaking as a pastor Satan takes a hold of people's lives and he takes a hold through through lies through disease through setbacks through backsliding and he will use that as a form of manipulation to control what he will call your outcome but I want to just tell you this this evening if we can just start off by saying this he's a liar and we better start with him defeated than him having strength tonight amen oh I love that uh I'm just going to stop you know the most dangerous thing for Danny steaming is to fill at home so if you don't want me to feel at home I don't know what to tell you amen and read this someplace just I I always told my brother Paul and I love history and and I I I I I was looking back at the time of of Roman power and and of course we see their place in history we see their place in Prophecy not only natural but also spiritual but there is uh there's such a thing that is called a Roman Triumph now a Roman Triumph is when a general has went out and and he's waged War and the war could have took years whatever it is but when when when he has completed that that war is finished he is triumphed he comes back and he's coming back with with all all that he has taken from that war he's bringing the vanquished he's bringing their their weapons and they use it actually as a parade as a parade as they go through the the main street of of Rome until they come right up to to the form or to the senate or whether whatever they would come so this conqueror is expected and demanded to show proof that he's had success in his campaign you know these campaigns were before the days of digital before the days of obviously you know instant you know knowledge this was it could take months it could take a year to get some kind of information of what's happening out on the frontier so they had to have proof that this this General uh has waged a successful campaign it can't just be a letter it has to be proof and so he would come back and and he would and they said depending on the the the the length of the campaign it could take up to two days to show this uh Roman Triumph and they would they would gather and they would come through bringing these these spectacles of War and it was actually it was actually showing the vanity of the Conqueror because they would bring they would bring the spoils of a conquered nation and they would bring this prisoners hundreds of wagons and following one after another pictures and statues and all the weapons of war that they have conquered and then they would bring the people of Honor that had been conquered they'd bring the Chiefs the captains the generals the Kings and all of these would be following along in this procession and then after it all would come the the general of the campaign and he was risen to such a status because of his victory that he would actually have a slave behind him in his Chariot whispering in his ears are all screaming out to him that he's a conqueror he he would be they'd be talking in his ear and telling him so remember you're not a god remember you're not a God you're just a man because this man would begin to think because of the worship of the people all because of what he's accomplished in Warfare that somehow he could become a god and I want you to know the shame it would have been for for those captives as they're walking along and they've been defeated by this power and the weapons that they had put their trust in are being put on display shown that wasn't good enough wasn't good enough to conquer the enemy and they're put on display and then they're following behind it as a as a trophy of shame that I I couldn't overcome I didn't have enough he was too powerful for me it's just a show in the heart of Satan is that's what he wants to do is he wants to put on display all those who once used to live in Liberty and they had their weapons of warfare and he wants to show that this has no power anymore and has no influence in your life or in your family and he wants to parade you as a vessel of Shame and a conquered vessel and the Bible and the message and all of this that you once followed is now just put on display as something that doesn't have the power to overcome so I want to preach on the trail of the serpent because we're here to say he's a liar I happen to believe this message is the truth and I stake my life on it I mean say amen I stake my life on this message I don't need an internet Prophet I don't need somebody out there to show me whether this is true or not I don't need a man who's never experienced or been in any any of the meetings to say whether it's true or not amen because I met the gods that brought that message amen and it proved to me it is life-changing is the Lord now the prophet preached a message called Satan's Eden he said now this is Satan is here today in deceit it's a treacherous hour but a tremendous time we're living in but the most glorious time of all the ages because we're facing the Millennium again we're facing Eden again amen but right at this age all the deceit and every tactic that he's ever used and been able to deceive with he's gathered it all together and reinforced himself and come down like God he came down like God he's not God amen he's put himself in place of God he's religious he can quote the scripture he just as Satan did to Eve but he'll leave a spot out so that there's a gap he can pour poison in he said he would exalt himself above the most high he would Ascend above the clouds and the Stars he would sit there like gods and be above the most high and he has succeeded in carrying out his threats and he has had a marvelous success in carrying them out by the people letting him explain away the value of the word in every age this has been his tacky to explain away the value of God's promised word to that age listen he can do all he wants to explain away Wesley's age or or any age but it's this age where the word has its power it's this age where your birth under the words and it's this age that he will explain away the value [Music] hey you'll think about that the value now value we can all talk about what we value what where we place our treasure and so he says he's had a great success in every age he's explained away he did it in the days of Noah he explained through science he used amen science to prove that what Noah was saying could not be true so that began to pull away begin to pull away those that perhaps had gathered around the the message of Noah and and I'm sure Noah had a bigger congregation amen at the beginning than he did at the end because he only ended up with his family now it seemed like that was a powerless message but you can never say predestination is powerless amen and might it took amen 115 years for the eighth one to come in I don't know but it was eight that actually went over on the ark but all the rest were explained Away by science of that day and said this could not happen so they put a microscope on the prophecy of Noah and said it could happen explained it away they did the same in the days of Jesus they Satan poisoned their minds by misinterpreting the word to them saying if you are the Son of God let me see you do something about it now Satan started that with Jesus when he went on to the Mount of Temptation after he'd received the Holy Ghost at the river and he goes up to this mountain and he's tempted for 40 days and well he's he's there for 40 days and 40 nights and at the end of it Satan comes when he's at his weakest you've all heard brother Branham explain this but it's just fresh again to me brother Paul because here's a man who has the power he has the gift Amen to put Satan in his place immediately he said if I just call on a legion of angels can come he could do all of that but he never used one gift he never used any of that Heavenly ability that he had that God had given him and that Divine person he could have spoke him out of existence but he was concerned about your day about your time about the weakest person in this congregation he said I want to show them if they take a hold of the word it will defeat Satan any place any time everybody has a Measure of Faith according to what God has given you it's not all the same my my measure is not the same as Brother Paul's and your measure is not the same of mine I can only operate under what God has given me God does not expect you to act like somebody else but everybody can do what Jesus did there at that point and I want you to know amen that Satan amen gave him these three temptations that directly correlate lust of the flesh pride of life lust for the eyes every one of them directly correlate to the Garden of Eden and Jesus used two portions of scripture that's all he used all out of the same book he didn't quote all of Genesis he didn't quote all of Exodus he didn't quote all of Deuteronomy Oliver of numbers and Leviticus he didn't go on and on he quoted two portions of scriptures out of the book of Deuteronomy and the Bible said Satan left him for a season why your Prophet said the word will defeat him at any place anytime any condition blessed be the name of the Lord amen so that's what Satan done is he poisons their minds against the channel amen now I'm a simple person and uh I love I love how God forces people to get along with each other you know we all have our favorites I'm sure Minds I I'll tell you my favorite it's brother Branham but uh hope that was all right you're close sorry we better be careful right brother Brandon right amen we don't want to ruin it before we start but I thought it was it was funny you know that in the in the uh the restoration of the tempo act had been destroyed the first temple been destroyed and they were going to build a second and the restoration is on and it stopped because of the threats there was a law out you can't build it stopped so God sent him Prophets he sent him two two that prophesied at the same time and I thought it was amazing because he's so opposite of each other hagiai and Zacharias two totally different I mean you look at Zechariah he's in heaven the whole time have envisions right let me know what I'm talking about amen right seven Visions he's at the Throne of God he's seeing Joshua the high priest there he's seeing Satan standing there he's having all these visions and there's hagiah the old man he's down there saying hey get up there on the mountain and chop some wood which which prophet would you follow we all want the vision we don't want to chop Woods amen but they're both whom God sent and they both came together and God used both of them to accomplish his purpose God is using a five-fold ministry as a dress wear of the church every one of them is different and every one of them God says they're my people they're not your people amen and God has put it there shall we all come in the unity of the faith and the faith is his faith it's not ours it's his in fact our faith doesn't work it's his faith that must come into you and that's why amen amen Satan wants to take that from you and he's had great success and take it away the value of the word Jesus made this statement that Satan has no part in me can find nothing in me brother random said it like this he said the devil Jesus said he has no part in me and I have no part in him and the devil would like to prove that different we'd like to say that's not true he'd like to say I have something in him and he has something in me he'd like to say we're equal that we're equal in our ways and we're when I say he's not equal Amen in fact when the Bible says in the Book of Job that he came to present himself among amongst the sons of God he's not God he's not equal he's a created being yet somehow he's convinced the people he has as much power as God or more amen now Satan would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the words but when the church disbelieves Satan so he's sowing that the church some point is believing what Satan is telling them but when they disbelieve Satan and believe the spiritual revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her and brother bam talks about his ministry and how in the ministry amen Satan would be exposed and it would be through discernment and so forth that Satan would be exposed and he hates being exposed amen he said it's not mind reading it's not telepathy it's not witchcraft it's a revelation by the Holy Ghost that's the only way I know of and he said in the reason that he hates the Book of Revelation in the Book of Genesis is because they show where he came into the church and it shows where he's ended so he hates them so he attacks them in any way he can to destroy the church's confidence in the word now we can see that on a large scale we can see how Satan has destroyed confidence in America in the Bible in church going we can see it in politics we don't need God Amen we don't need to pray anymore there's no there's no confidence in God anymore that's on a national scale but on a church scale and then on a Believer scale he's doing the same thing by causing the people to lack confidence in what God has said and is doing he said but amen and I'm skipping ahead this is a long a long quote but I just want to lay these things in there he said he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works amen she will be an invincible Army now I'm not saying you're not and I'm not saying I'm not I'm just talking to individuals now amen she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian Church there's a true spirit in the framework of the church and there's a false Spirit eating away at the confidence in the true spirit amen when they do he'll be he said they get that true Revelation and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit will be powerless before her I think about put you in her he will be powerless before you what a what a glorious revelation amen he will be definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert and what was the power that he was trying to gain over him he was trying to get him to react to his commands you remember reading in the scripture Ephesians Ephesians 4 27 what does it say there neither give place to the devil but what does it say before that be angry and sin not you know your passions come upon you the anger what Satan's trying to do at that moment and he said let's don't let the sun go down on your wrath and I know we like to say well you know we can be mad for a day it sounds good right amen but it's also amen your passion your anger the things that you allow to start trying to control you will cause the light to lose power over you and Satan will try if you give him pleasure try to use that to force you to do something against God's word it's what he did to Moses Moses and his passion amen got angry and he smote The Rock twice instead of speaking to the Rock and what did God say you glorified yourself you didn't glorify me there's where Satan tries to gain power amen he said but he said yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation Our Lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them praise the name of the Lord now brother Branham was planning on preaching this message called the trail of the serpent he said it was uh the beast at the beginning and the Beast at the end he said it's like twins so close in worship now I'm picking up on that thought the trail that the serpent has left he said the trail of the serpent Ry how many has went in the woods and and found the trails of the snakes one brother we need you up here amen it's hard to see unless you know what to look for it's very hard to see where a snake has been it can be hard to discern the writer in the Book of Proverbs spoke of the way of a serpent upon a rock it was mysterious to him it was hard to distinguish the serpent is found in an element he's sunning himself and then he leaves no trace of his coming or going it's not so when it comes to the prophetic for God exposed his Trail so notice he said from the beginning it's been so close no he go back to the Book of Genesis which is a seed chapters why he hates this book you can see what was planted you can see how it behaves in the Book of Revelations you can see how it ends in the families of Adam and Eve in the families of Abraham and Sarah in the family of Noah in the family of Isaac and Rebecca what do they all have in common you see there's a cane you see there's an Ishmael right amen there's a ham there's an Esau amen amen you remember speaking about Noah the prophet said you remember when Noah came out ham came with him sin was still there and sin went right on through the ark unbelief and doubt went right over carried in judgment amen he said Noah went through that tribulation period he said but then he said he said but then out come Noah who polluted the Earth again I'm sorry out came ham who polluted the Earth again so Satan amen was always close and I want you to do me a favor tonight when I'm speaking about this don't you put names in it we're talking about spirits amen because Satan wants to use our emotions it's not what we're interested in is our emotions against someone or against this or I think this because you're going to find out the one you think is corrected you need it too if in fact I think I'm still preaching to humans amen so Satan was there with him he came right behind Noah sowing right behind him you remember with with him what happened amen out of hand come Nimrod and ham was under a curse because you think about what ham did he saw his father in his failure and he went began to talk about it amen and he exposed his father's nakedness but his brothers would have nothing to do with that shame they walked backwards and covered we need more Brothers amen that'll cover for one another instead of talking about somebody's failure and when Noah realized what had happened he meant he cursed amen this offspring of ham and he said Canaan is cursed and he will be a servant of servants in other words he'll be the lowest of servants and I thought about why why can't why Kanan because God knew Amen in in Divine in his in his in what would happen in the future that Canaan would actually occupy the place that God gave to his people and then Canaan would live in the land of Canaan and that's who God would give to Israel would give him that land and he would tell them through through Abraham and through Isaac don't you marry daughters from there Miriam of the same blood that I'm from why God did not want anything that would have this that the seed of of a servant that would be a slave forever I'm not talking about being a servant of Christ I'm talking about being a slave to idolatry and they would just be a Slave you know the worst kind of attitude is one I just can't help being what I'm being I said he's cursed amen now these are not just Sons the ones I've named are not just Sons but they all directly impact the promises that have been given to these couples every one of them can't impacted the promise Ishmael impacted the promise right Esau impacted the promise amen God gave a promise that he would vindicate through his people's lives but Satan always close to your affections we've been taught by Brother Branham that it's always been twins through the scripture I remember brother Paul you know I got Twins and I they've been here when they were little they're 30 years old now and I'm we're all advanced into our grandparent years and with joy amen and uh but we my grandfather my wife's grandfather was a pastor in Saint Augustine he called me up one day and he's like hey I'm preaching on Twins and I would like to have a picture of your boys and I'm like no way I'm not sending them to you amen because they're not the kind of twins you're talking about amen so he laughed and that was the end of it amen but anyway amen we've been taught brother Branham said that every Revival produces a twin we've named some of them in the above statement all right Cain Ishmael he saw that's not all right there's Jesus there is Judas right and even to go beyond that the prophet said there's a Holy Ghost and there's the Antichrist twins Holy Ghost and the antichrist twins in the religious realm they can even look alike so he said now don't forget this I trust this is okay it's what the Lord laid on my heart it's what I want to preach you may not amen but I won't preach it anyhow I've reached that age of my life I can't hear there's always twins and don't forget it he said Little Flock don't forget it in this last day there's going to be twins so close to see the elect if it's possible in other words it's going to have the ability to catch your attention to pull you he said it's a Pentecostal move Matthew 24 24 is a Pentecostal move so much like the real thing till it deceived the very elect if it were possible now he said is he said it's just two fathers but the same mother mother is the church but two different fathers you think about that we have church here I have church amen we're in the framework of the message is the church and in that framework is two Spirits at work is that right same church listen same movement same thing the betting ground is the same it's where the word Falls but one of them is perverted you understand one's perversion because it's the wrong father it's the wrong father and he is stirring people toward an organization notice he's stirring people moving people all right I'm not here to identify churches we're talking about spirits I think it's a shame when we have reached a place in our life that we think we're preaching against somebody we're preaching against spirits and and and the enemy he's come at me he's tried to discourage me he's tried to tell me to give up he's tried to tell me the message isn't true he's tried to tell me all the junk that has gone around the internet and as a pastor it's got to come through and just got you've got to be tested and and you got to say I'm going to stay or I'm going to go and you got friends that have believed and all of a sudden they're gone it's a stirring time people are being sturged there's a stirring going on and we use words so easily without really understanding amen ramifications of using words what they do and what they mean we use the word emotion like there's something wrong with emotion but I'm telling you I don't care I don't care if you sit here and stare at me that's emotion I don't care if you jump up and down that's emotion emotion is part of your makeup I came from the Mennonite Church they sat there like this and don't move the whole time that's their emotion I can't help it but we label one another because that's the age we live in of labels and nobody wants to look behind the label come on church if I just call you a name it must be true so when he says it's a Pentecostal move what is he talking about what is Pentecost Pentecost is where a true birth is and that's where Satan is deceiving he's deceiving at the place of a true birth a place where it can look real but it's not real there's only one way you can tell if it's real I'll tell you what a prophet said and that's where I stake my life a prophet said he can impersonate anything he can impersonate any gift he can impersonate moves he said but he cannot be the word [Music] [Applause] you've got to have an anchor in you that Satan cannot move you I don't serve God tonight brother Joe because I've been well all my life I don't serve God because he has paid all my bills come on church I don't serve God because I have a church with no problems it's not why I serve God I don't serve God because it's convenient I serve God because what I have inside of me and it can only be satisfied by what he has said in his word old taste and see that the Lord is good God gave you an appetite to move you into the supernatural that's why you have an appetite not just a taste of it and walk away and say that's a good service but the taste of it and say I want more of that and I want more of that you see we can't be trusted many times with what we have because we're too heavy Paul said amen lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily says that means even weights are not sinful just make us heavy we're too heavy to be used brother Bannon would say it like this why do you hunger why do you thirst he said it's the father trying to reveal himself to you but but so many things get it out of you and many of those things are not even wrong stirring people stirring people I'm gonna have to run more so again he says when I get home I'm preaching on that trail of the serpent it's my understanding that they did not want him to preach on it he said but it's it's the it's the serpent he said it's the beast at the beginning and it's the beast at the end I'll Trail him right through the Bible an organization cannot do that and he said if the Lord permits us he says and now just watch how that cunning that fellow is it's just like Judas and Jesus Brothers in the same tribe just like Esau and Jacob just like The Crow and the dove everything is a twin in this great Warfare in question and answer 64 speaks of it again about twins he says it's been twins all along he said even the Holy Spirit and the antichrist is twins amen so Satan's purpose was from the beginning he said I'm going to make myself an Eden will make us myself a place where people will exalt me people will position me in that place that they look to me first instead of in instead of God they look to me first and and he's done that he's he has lusted for the sons of God to be put on display and vanquished and their weapons of warfare were useless in his Warfare oh what is a shame those same swords and weapons that were put on display in the Roman Triumph could have easily killed that room in general those weapons put on display did not mean they were not powerful enough praise the Lord Satan is not called God of any other age but this one this is ambition and here he is and I just want to I just want to show you in just a little bit how how the scriptures describe Satan just just real quickly is that okay and what what the prophet said that he was he said he was the right hand of almighty God he was the right hand he was the original Archangel in heaven once the greatest person in heaven outside of God this is a man who had a great standing and a great estate he stood at the right hand of God he was a leading the leading cherubim he was also the first one to take the wrong step he was placed on free moral agency and he chose a man to follow that path sin did not start on Earth it started in heaven amen amen Satan Lucifer the devil was a condemned creature before he ever struck the Earth amen because when he was given the preeminances to make his choice he wanted something better than what God had and that seemed so far from us when we're talking about that so far out there way up in the galaxies here's here's something happen out there but it came right here and and the prophet said he said now there's only two Powers that's God's power that's Satan's power there's only two powers and every war every disorder everything that comes along is either controlled by God's power or Satan's power because it's only two Powers there is power of Life power of death amen he said there's remember and don't forget it there's only two Powers one is the spiritual power of the Holy Spirit the other one is the devil working through intellectual power for that's where he entered in the Garden of Eden through intellectual powers to make Eve believe in intellectual conception against the word now intellectual conception is beautiful and will bring forth life but a perverted one all right amen now he said the first decision God gave this people in the carniven was to combat the enemy with was his word and they were fortified by his word he said and now the enemy is going to study our strategy with the word he is going to see how you handle it he's going to watch it he said that was what he did with Eve he used that he caused her to reason with the word and you want to never reason with God's word just believe it don't try to explain it don't try to figure it out you can't figure out God God is the word and it's just made to believe and that is our strength is to accept the word amen so God wants you to take the word in its pure form and accept it into your life it becomes your strength now why is Satan studying us then you know it was said about Napoleon who was a great warrior and a great General amen and speaking of the devil that he studies man to gain Mastery over that man he will he will he'll study our character and and it was like Napoleon every time he came into fresh territory it was said of him he would spread a map upon the ground and he would ponder it he would get on his knees and look at that and he would make himself familiar with every feature that was on that map he would know where the rivers are he was there were the bridges the forge The Villages their positions and relation to other towns and he would then plan out how he would attack that area now this is what Satan does he studies our strategy with the word how does brother Danny use the words he don't call me brother how does he use the word in relation to my attacks how does he use the word in relation to other people and He will study my character now if I'm a certain person that is loud and funny and and all certain different ways or if I'm a very reserved person or you know we all made up different he will try to work the angles that of your weakness and here you're trying to just start putting pressure in certain areas because he wants to see how you're going to react are you going to use the word are you going to fly off the handle the devil has many names it's called The Devil he's called Lucifer he's called Satan he's called that old serpent he's called The Serpent the reason the all of these names have attributes serpent is one who has a very sharp Vision one who eyes its victim keeps his eye upon them an old serpent is a veteran one has been through many wars he's he's sharp he knows what else he he he's planned many campaigns Satan is an adversary amen who who who makes himself an adversary against anything that's what Satan is a devil means he's a false accuser he's a slander we've met him in many of these different ways amen he's also called a dragon a dragon is bigger than a serpent he's also political amen he's also called the Archangel of the bottomless pit amen he's called abandon he's called amen uh which means destruction in the Greek he's a pollen which means he's a corrupter the Bible said he is subtle the Bible said he's a roaring lion the Bible says he's an angel of Light all of those are deceptive and what Satan comes to do is to replace the realities of Christ in your life amen amen and he will give you a substitute Book of Exodus the Bible tells us that when God was training Moses I would have liked to have seen it I don't know if I'd like to experienced it but I'd like to have seen it that when he was training Moses and telling him to go down to Egypt and Moses was given his excuses and and God comes back and says I'm going to do it I'm going to be with you I'm the one that's going to do this Moses you're not the one going to do I'm going to do it and and the most like well how's it going to happen he says what do you got in your hand oh here he has a Shepherd staff and and the Lord tells him amen what do you have in your hand and he goes I got a rod you know when God asked you something he wants you to respond if you're sick tonight he'll ask you what does Isaiah 53 say he don't want you to go um he wants you to say it because you've got to see it amen and he said it's a rod he said throw it on the ground he threw it on the ground and it became a serpent the Bible says Moses fled from it the Lord said unto Moses now put forth your hand that was probably a long period of time between amen seeing it on the ground and now putting your hand out amen because God was teaching a man how to handle a snake amen he'll teach you the same thing you may not get a firsthand experience like Moses but he'll teach you through a prophet's word amen and he would tell him amen now put forth your hand and take him by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it now this is the same man that ran from it now he comes back and he catches it by the tail and it becomes a rod in his hand there's there's some of you here tonight you're just running but God's going to bring you back and I want you to know it never became a snake until it was on the ground because that's the only position that a snake should be in it was not a snake up here it was a snake down there God has teaching him how to handle a snake he threw it down that's his position it's where God cursed him the prophet that's when he threw him down that's when he became a snake amen had to be on the ground No Moses is like us first he's afraid to take God at his word he shows his emotional side he runs from it you know that's what we do and God tells us something and he confronts us with the word it confronts us in a situation amen and and he forces you to put your hand out and take a hold of it amen because this is going to show you to be a prophet to pharaoh what I'm doing with your life is going to show amen that Pharaohs hold over you is false Hallelujah amen amen at first Moses was afraid but the word of the Lord was you have power over the serpent that wasn't only for that was not only for for Moses that's for our day for what you find out brother Branham had the same thing happened to him where he was given power is that right he was given power over this great monster serpent he had a vision do I do you want me to tell it to you he had the vision he said he said it was about three o'clock in the morning I heard somebody singing we're coming down to the river and he said I'm standing on the map of Palestine he said we were two-thirds of the way there and somebody's saying we're coming down to the river and I look and there's Jordan laying in front of me and oh every promise is over in the Promised Land land of Canaan every promise was over there he woke up and then he went back into the vision again he said and this time I was on a great Highway and I was with a friend and he said he said his voice told me he said there's such danger in this day and it seems like everybody is afraid so fear was a big part of the day and he said I heard a noise they said the voice told me there's such danger he said there's something that said it's instant death when it strikes you he said I heard this noise and here comes this great monster serpent coming through and he was looking at me he said that voice told me he said now you've been given power to mine him the worst or any you've been given power to bind him amen Moses was given power to bind amen he said when he looked at me it just he looked at me said but then he couldn't strike me why because the prophet is representing the word of the age and who has more power amen he said he couldn't strike me he said but then he turned and looked at that man and he started going after that man and he said the man was running and jumping trying to get away he said and I cried out oh God have mercy upon that my that brother and he said the Lord spoke to me and said you've been given power to bind him he spoke in the name of Jesus and he bound the serpent he said you've not only been given power to bind him you've been given power to unbind him Moses you've been given power throw him on the ground he'll become a serpent pick him up here become a rod he said but you must be more sincere what was he telling him the attitude in which you handle the words [Applause] this word is not a game this word is not who is the best Church who is the best preacher who this is not the word God's word is his heart and his heart is his people Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord it was in that day of Moses that Paul spoke about it and he named who those magicians were he said it was the days of Janice and Chambers they also could throw a snake down they had power to throw a snake down and pick it up again amen but Moses snake ate theirs up and they could not duplicate that Hallelujah what a time we're living in amen in the first coming of Christ both John and Jesus identified the religious leaders as a generation of what the trail of the serpent amen he said you're the ones that killed the prophets it was a serpent that killed the prophets why were they killing them to take away their influence if Satan can kill the prophet in your life the voice of influence of this age if you can kill it so here's Jesus stand here and he's identifying these prophets or these leaders as a Generation of Vipers that killed the prophets amen those that killed the influence of the word those that argued against the vindication of the word that would deliver the people you see that's what Satan has done in this age he's wanted to make the message about oh you know brother random he prophesied about a bridge or he saw a bridge or he had a vision of this he had that's not the message God allowed him to do that knowing amen there would be unbelievers come back because he's smokescreening he doesn't want you to see the words come on Church because he knows the power of the word he just wants you here to question things that you don't have an answer for he said well was there 16 men on the bridge or was it two how many was it wow I just want you to go prove to me that Jesus was born in Bethlehem well you said I said it in the Bible where brother Graham said it in his message too come on but go find me the place go show me the science prove to me he was born of a virgin by science That's what Satan is going to do to you there's something greater than science something greater than newsworthy I mean it's his words thank you I just got to get personal you know I'm just swimming around a little bit here it's all right amen let me tell you I am a direct amen I I'm a person who had uh I was directly influenced and impacted by The Prophet's Ministry I want to tell you you came too late amen my mother stood for it when nobody else would in her her my daddy hated this message hated it if brother Brown's in heaven I don't want to be there well that's stupid who would want to say that I'll tell you if the poe if Pope if the Pope's in heaven I still want to go come on that means that man went through the process and he got there right but there's such a hatred in the denominations against a prophet because it's not their hatred it's Satan's because it's a Ministry that pulls him out of his position as God and presents him as a man to you [Applause] my Dad ran my mother all over the country trying to get her out of the message my grandmother asked brother Brown I mean you can read it in 1964 I have two daughters in denominations they've married men in denominations they've received opposition what should they do brother random said he said hold fast Show Your Colors I don't say don't go around a fellowship with him he said but you know a dove can't eat with a buzzard hold fast Show Your Colors brother random could you have at least said something a little bit more something a little bit more that gripped me gripped me whole fast there's only hold fast I mean that means hold on just hold on don't don't give up hold fast well you know you're gonna say something nice to me like it's gonna be you know everything's gonna be fine he's gonna come riding in you're gonna feel him you're going to know he's there hold fast Show Your Colors stand up say you believe it he never even told her amen that everything was going to be all right he just said hold fast and Show Your Colors 1964. 10 years holding fast showing your colors 10 years of abuse 10 years of threats 10 years throwing the clothes on the lawn sending her back home threaten her with taking the kids came down to the end 19 amen your daddy amen a hippie and on drugs come out of the Vietnam War amen get his heart was changed gave his life to god sister Alicia amen and my mom asked my my dad I can remember he asked my dad she she asked my dad I want to go to his baptism he goes if you go and you get back I'm going and the kids are gone I'm finished with it you see it's God forcing you to come out of your intellectual Comfort I'm in the message and show you that the message is alive you see because if you hold fast and you show your colors you've done all you can do now God is going to expose the trail of the serpent against your life and show you it's just a man you know brother random called my dad a buzzard said you know what Dove can't eat with a buzzard that's what he was acting like amen but when my mother made her stand said I'm going to go anyway now dad had made all those threats what is he going to do I have made those threats I've got to back it up amen my brother Joe amen he said I walked around the kitchen and he said I was crying tears because in my heart I did not want to leave my my wife he said but all of a sudden he said some people received theirs in church he said I received mine in my kitchen God came down and he turned around and he told my mother I'll take you to the baptism it was not big noises there was not lights flashing it was just a change of heart that God turned him because somebody stayed true to the word and the word has power to change any situation that is in this room we only look at the news so and so left this one left my friends are in the world they used to serve God my this one's in drugs this one's falling more oh my well we're in a terrible situation but I serve the god that stands on a confession and when my mother made that confession and my dad was baptized a week later hold fast Show Your Colors you come too late to tell me it's not real I saw it change [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus said he that receiveth you receiveth me he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward he that receiveth the righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward what do you what is he saying you shall receive a prophet's reward what does that mean whatever God pours through him for the people is yours by faith Hallelujah now I just want to say this Jesus said to Satan you are of your are you speaking to this religious leader says you're of your father the devil and the lust of your fathers you'll do he's a murderer from the beginning and he Abode not in the truth because there's no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he is actually he's speaking of his own so when he's saying when he tells a lie he's actually talking about himself for he's a liar and a father of it how many has ever been in a place of hopelessness torment you ever been there brother hopeless tormented I want to say it's not yours that's his I know you're tired brother I see Ireland all over you you're turning green but I want to give you this testimony I think we can help you we can help one another if we humble ourself before one another the man said the Pentecostal church is only going to talk about how strong they are he said I'm going to preach to you perfect strength by Perfect weakness sent a strange message to preach in a Pentecostal Church when we're all talking about our power but brother Graham says never judge yourself by the power and the Miracles in your life he said you look back and judge yourself by the fruit that is coming according to the word right remember because there's twins Judas did not have a devilish Ministry he had a holy ghost Ministry Judas Priest and cast Devils out Judas prayed for the sick and they were healed but he couldn't come all the way up to what the word demanded to be born again I know what it's like to feel that hopelessness I don't like to talk about these things but I think it's important sometimes to realize the things we feel and the things we're going through is coming from Satan because when you feel like you have no hope that's him he has no hope when you feel hopeless that's his hopelessness when you feel powerless that his power do you realize the man talking to you has no keys to his house doesn't have power over your death doesn't have power over your grave do you realize he's lost it you know what it does to a man who's lost all of his money in his bank and has no power at home when you feel that torment because fear hath torment Satan attacks you with all his hate of hate of God and it's channeled towards you he's going to question God in your life he's going to tell you what he's going to do to you that means heard him tell how many has ever heard the Devil tell you what he's going to do to you well I want to ask you why didn't he do it because I see by the Bible if he's ever given permission to do anything he does it immediately but he tells me these things and he doesn't do it you know why he doesn't have permission if you had the permission to take my life he wouldn't tell me he's going to take my life and he took it how many times he told me I want to die of cancer because I had an ache in my bones or I have a history in my family tell me how many times he told me this what your feeling is this disease or that disease how many times has he threatened me with something that he's actually not allowed to do because he's a liar and when he's speaking of it he's speaking of his own and he wants to hide behind that hopelessness because hopelessness will not search out A matter it'll give up [Applause] and Sid wants you to give up tonight because he wants to put you in a procession of so-called Believers and used to worship God believe them put them in a procession of a powerless message ah yes he likes to do that but he can go no further than what he's given I've told this testimony a few times I'm going to close after I say this but I trust he'll help you I know what it's like to be depressed I know what it's like to have hopelessness and I'm not talking about before I came to the Lord I'm talking about in the last few years I know what it's like to have a nervous breakdown I know what it's like to know what's going on and not know and be embarrassed in 2016 I I had done kind of overworked myself and administered in Ministry and then Satan picks his times wisely and I I'm home now and I come under an attack and I don't know what it is but the attack is such amen and some of you heard me say this before just bear with me but I just felt to say it tonight I was under attack as such and it was embarrassing to me because I became totally afraid to preach had no energy to hold myself up and I did not want to talk to people now that's hard if you're a pastor because people sure want to talk to you glory be to God and the Lord used my wife to help me but I want to tell you something now about the realm of The Supernaturals things we don't understand because we we have a one-track mind think God only works certain ways but I was under attack to this extreme the attack was my I had got worn out physically and then I was attacked in the spiritual realm and my nurse broke down and I I I didn't realize what it was but brother Paul for the space of two weeks something would come in my bedroom and every night every morning about four o'clock in the morning it was like my my I was falling apart I had actually strained myself to try to see it it was so real to me and it was an unclean presence and I was told you know preachers shouldn't have nervous breakdowns and I don't understand that and I should you know so you don't want to talk about it because preachers don't have them you know it worked tough right I mean look at him he's barely staying away we're tough I'm with you brother I totally understand you're miserable and I feel for you in the name of the Lord just bear with me it's coming and and I was in this spot and I was scheduled to preach a meeting actually up here in Ohio and I was praying Lord get me out of it because I knew that I'd gotten that Pulpit I was afraid I was going to break down in the Pulpit I could not preach I was afraid to preach I didn't want to didn't want to come and the Lord sent a tropical storm and I canceled there's some of them that are good and the church asked me to to take some time away give myself a rest I was at a place with Paul I could not talk to people I literally I didn't just didn't want to be around people and I don't say that to make you feel sorry for me I'm telling you the situation I was in so my wife she scheduled a place to thank God for these wives that know how to schedule and work and she worked when I couldn't and we went away for a little while but in that time she wrote a letter to an acquaintance who's not even in the message and she said if you believe in God and they just struck up a conversation if you believe in believing God pray for my husband he's just gone through situation it wasn't sin I didn't know what it was that's what was embarrassing it's embarrassing and this woman wrote back she's a Catholic Glory and she said she said I know what his problem is oh praise the Lord I don't now she does she goes she just she's not even from Florida she's from New York she's never been there she described our church described where people sat in our church and said I tell you what his problem is he's got witches in his church and got more than one I always knew it which is she goes Catholic tell him not to worry about it said I put a hedger about him like praise the Lord I got a Catholic hedge around me I know too many quotes man yeah it says a message minister receiving Catholic help I told my wife because what we were going through in the church because there was a little bit of a rebellion stirring up and I told my wife I said well you know the Bible says that witchcraft is as a sin of rebellion so I just left it there so we're on a trip and I get a phone call from a message Minister and he called me up and he said I said I was riding on my tractor he said I can tell you where I was he said the Lord told me call Danny and tell him he's been attacked by a spirit of witchcraft so now I have a Catholic and a message preacher collaborating We're Men brother I'm telling you we there's no super dupers around I tell you when Satan Satan worked on me in a place where I didn't know what it was and when you don't know what it is that's his power when you get sick he'll tell you what it is before there's even proof of what it is I've had people in the hospital with heart conditions and all kinds of things and I told them I said you really don't have a heart condition I said it's stress doing that to you and they wouldn't believe me and so they'd go there and the doctor would sit them down said I want to tell you We've ran all these testers nothing wrong with you he said but it's stress that's causing that I said Doctor will you come to my church because they don't believe me but you've been around long enough long enough it puts pressure on a body and a body reacts and that's what I was doing I didn't know what it was and he's bringing all his hopelessness in and his torment and tell you there's something wrong with you and I'm breaking down I don't I can't fulfill what I'm supposed to now it's become an evident to the church when the Lord told me what it was still didn't have all my strength back and I wasn't healed but I my the the courage that comes with knowing the enemy and where he's hiding where his Trail has moved then I began to regain strength there is a situation I trust this is all right and somebody hears it and I hope they don't get offended if you do come talk and we'll say praise the Lord but um it was a situation where it was a spirit rising up was against the ministry against preaching period you shouldn't preach and it was collaborating and gaining strength and then with it came a a hyper-critical spirit against all the people and I don't I don't mind this going up because I want the devil to be exposed it was hypocritical and I'm a pastor I gotta hide things I gotta even hide what's wrong with them and I'm thinking well how can you say that about that person when you are doing this but Satan is is such a creature that he does not consider himself but he only points at someone else and and I was written a long letter of everything that was wrong in the church you know the old Danny stayman would have rose up and said listen I have got me a shotgun and I'm going to use it I'm going to pull it till it runs dry I want to just point that out there and let that chip but the Lord says no you're not and I waited four months before I ever responded to that letter September October November then Christmas Day Christmas fell on Sunday and Christmas so happens to be my birthday so I preached a Christmas message praise the Lord you know what I preach because God knows if somebody's not going to change he's going to clean it because he wants to sanctify the church and and I and all I preached was the Bible is brother branham's absolute and in three days it was cleaned out it's all I preached because somehow today the word has morphed and if we're not careful we're going to become Mormons our Jehovah Witness write our own Bible the prophet never wrote another Bible unveiling of God said he said I can't even add to the words one letter oh brother Branham that Revelation that you had on on the Seven Seals it could be amen another chapter to the Book of Revelation he says no it cannot be what was revealed was already in the word praise the Lord but somehow Satan hates the Bible so so when I preached that I I receive strength I've got strength back from staying with the word showing my colors but I wasn't healed and I just want to say this and I hope it helps you that was in December all the way down to August I am over in Romania and I'm preaching a youth camp it's 102 every day it's 102 degrees and we're preaching it's outside so you go back and you sleep and you don't rest and you sleep you know how it is and you're sweating everything out I'm preaching Thursday night Friday morning Friday night Saturday morning Saturday night and two on Sunday and this is Saturday morning and I want to preach part two on Saturday night and Saturday morning I preached and I'm totally drained and that Spirit came back again when it comes back I'll tell you how it acts it acts like I have no inspiration to preach I don't know what I'm going to preach and standing out in front of me is just like a black cloud I'm scared to step into and that fear came back and I have to preach and I'm I'm praying that I'm asking the Lord you've got to help me Lord you know what's going on here and I'm asking I'm not begging I'm just asking him nothing happens no voice nobody speaks to me pick up my Bible and I walk to the pulpit feel exactly the same I preach the word and I sit down and a brother stood up he's sitting over about where you are brother getting or maybe he was on that side I don't remember but it was somewhere like that and he came and he spoke to the pastor of the youth camp and he went back and sat down and and the pastor spoke to his son is also a minister and his Minister ran the camp and they spoke about that man and then they came and they talked to me he said that man wanted to tell me the entire time I preached a man stood right behind me and held me up [Applause] brother Paul they they said that man is he's not a fly by night he he's a he's a Godly Man and I want to I want you to know something I never failed him and he never spoke to me but when he held me that whole service he healed me and I want to tell you that same God that same God that I'm talking about he wants to expose the trail of the enemy I am not just preaching to you some some kind of theology out here I'm talking about God's desire is to always expose the enemy at your weakest place in order to show it he is the same yesterday today and forever God allows us to become weak so that he can show us his strength is still stand with me [Music] May that help you I don't talk about that often I don't like to talk about it often but I do like to tell the devil he lost so when I talk I talk about something like that I know what it feels like I know what it feels like brother Mark to feel the nerves breaking down and I know what it feels like my brother when it means to be healed I would say God backs his word up if you have a need tonight he'll back you up you sung it that same God why don't you come sing it again amen father this is the first night we love you Lord may you take these words and bring them to the heart of your people Lord I am not here to preach against people we're here Lord to preach against the kingdom of the enemy and to tear it down and to let him know he has no power over Sons and Daughters of God who desire to come out you have no key to your prison house you may not open it but our Lord did and father I pray in the name of Jesus if there's someone sick here tonight may they lift their hands may they hear the word by my stripes you are healed may they not just hear it may they see it may it become a part of them Father oh Lord may you expose the enemy or he hides behind these clouds of hopelessness and fear and torment remember your word is the truth perfect love casts out all fear and I pray in the name of Jesus Lord that your people will be healed tonight for the glory of God may you take these words Lord and bring a harvest of them because you didn't call a man to preach amen or teacher do stand for the word and not bring a harvest but you have promised it father you're faithful to your promise so I'll commit it to you now in the name of Jesus Amen and Amen brother Paul bless you Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah [Music] that is [Applause] [Music] cause now that same God is living in me to [Music] the same God who pardon the Raging Mercy peace [Music] who created All The Heavens [Applause] he he came back living in Jesus and there was power in every but now in these are not stays [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Applause] [Music]
