he's been so good thank you Lord got a reason to praise give a praise I'm a re hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth fainteth not nor is neither is weary and aren't you glad tonight that our God doesn't faint he doesn't get weary he doesn't get weak he's never weak he's strong because when we get weak he is strong can you say Amen uh when we have where we're fainting when we're having when we're that way then we know that our the creator of heavens and earth does not do that there is no searching of his understanding verse 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and even the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles so if it's about eagles we ought to perk up our tension because we're Eagles how many's an eagle here tonight and it was the end time that have to give the story about the chicken and the chicken in the barnyard and the eagle getting misplaced there and he never felt comfortable we know the story and so it took Mama Eagle to come up above and scream and then he knew who he was and once he was able to fly then he could fly and get in his category so to speak that we are not just to we're not called to be chickens but Eagles and the other scripture says wheresoever the carcass is in the end time there will the Eagles be gathered together so when something perks up when we when we hear the term the Eagles and they shall round up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint you see now when we have extreme weakness we have a fainting we have giving up and this this word when it speaks of weariness it's an exhaustion exhaustion it's a depleting this age depletes our strength from us it's a weakening of our spirit many times and it's all related to the spirit and the mind not physical but the spirit and the mind weak mind weak thinkers not strong in Godly thinking or Godly principles that's the age that we live in and so much could be said about that that's not my subject tonight but I want to hone in on how it's going through this and saying when men are weak and this generation is weak he giveth power verse 29 to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength who does it it's not by our own abilities it's not by what we can offer but our strength is in the Lord and thankfully he provides strength when we are weak as a matter of fact when we're weak then that's when he becomes strong he's the source of our strength and so if we go to the source then what are we going to be we're going to be strong we're going to be strong in our thinking we're going to strong in our minds we're going to be strong in our Spirits we're going to be strong in our soul God's calling a people to be strong in the Lord not weak in the Lord and so but he provides it but right in the in the middle of this he said even the young people shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall now that's interesting because when you have young men and you young people that are getting weary and faint it's talking about spiritually now um that's interesting because young people are known for their energy and they've got all these things but here now look at our generation where it used to be older people that was suicid used to be older people that was in depression now the last 10 15 years we deal with young people in a state of depression we deal with young people considering suicide so now the devil's come in and this weariness and this giving up Spirit comes to the youth and that's really bad when our young people are getting that way it gets you know the devil's really trying to take us when he takes the young hearts that should be excited about life they should be en energetic about life and looking forward to the future and you find all of them they're they're afraid of the future they're scared of what's going to take place next it should never be that way the excitement in their eyes the the the excitement about the future what does God have for me and the energy and all that should be there and yet they're becoming depressed and of course I could elaborate how what encourages that depression with social media and all of it but that's what they become they become weary our young youth shall become faint and shall be weary and then they have the same problem is everyone of this AE everyone in this age but they that wait upon the Lord they that pursue the Lord they that are looking towards the Lord they that have a Pursuit towards God they're going to find a place to renew their strength glory be to God there's a place tonight to renew your strength there's there's a there's a heart of God that's provided something for this hour that when you're weary in spirit when that Devil's telling you to give up there's a place we can go and set your wings can you say amen and you feel a renewal in the Lord oh my so you know being my subject is for the young people then we thank God that there's a promise that our strength young people if you're listening there's a promise that your strength can be renewed too we will have a source in this new generation and the youth will have that Source too I want to say that we need young people today that are strong in fact there's a calling going out during this in the middle of of Satan's Eden there's a calling going out to the new generation right now through the preaching there's a calling going out how many believe that there's a calling in the middle of Satan's Eden the vision of God is to have young people and what's he calling for he's calling for strong young people he's calling for young people there strength in their Minds calling for young people that are strong in their hearts strong in their convictions strong in their protective boundaries away from the enemy strong girls who can resist a weak boy he's calling for strong boys that can resist a weak girl strong girls that know how to say no to the wrong type of boy strong boys that know how to say no see when when you talk to boys they always think that they're strong Rel to their muscle uh buildup and their tone but go God give us strong boys who stand for the convictions of the word that can say no to Temptation that's strengthen this hour you're just a statistic if you're just strong in your in your muscles can you say amen and go ahead and do that it's it's great and you know that work your muscles do all that but listen Solomon said he said uh something about a man that could take and Conquer a whole city he said but his Spirit he can't conquer so he could Flex his muscles and say I've conquered that whole city with the Sword and the Army and then he can turn around and he don't have enough strength to ward off the wrong kind of woman that's right and Samson was that way when the anointing would come on him he'd pick up the fence of a city he you know he could do anything but a woman that's where his weakness was and it weakened him until she cut his hair and found the source of his strength that's right a woman did that found the source of his strength cut his strength off and so he might have been such a mighty man but what is strength today strength is young men and young women that can stand for their convictions strength is young girls who can stand against the wrong guy and say no strength is young guys who can say no to the Temptations on the internet there's a calling going out to young people today that would be strong young young people and let it it be said that strength that does not come as brother Danny was saying this past weekend strength does not come from your ability it comes from the Lord right strength does not come from your own mental exercise it comes from the Lord there's a source in the Lord as we wait on him as we look to him as we pursue God then we find the source of strength and the renewal of strength if you're weak there's a call for young men first John 21:14 says I have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of God abideth in you he's not talking about old man he's talking about the young man what's God's vision for young boys and young men what's God's Vision that you're strong right why do you have to preach this because we got a bunch of weak Lily livered men they can't stand for any convictions yeah we live in a generation with men with no backbone whatsoever there's a calling for young men and he says I've written unto you because you are strong the vision for young men is that they be strong and the word of God would abide in them and you have overcome the W Wicked one that's the men that God wants to write to that's the men that God wants strong in the word the word's abide in you and you have overcome the wicked God give us young men that are overcoming the wicked one come on people say amen can you believe that that's the vision see well what about a woman well look here in Proverbs 31:10 Proverbs 31:10 says who can find a virtuous woman for her price is farra rues skipping along to verse 17 she girth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms now that's not a bodybuilder either don't use that scripture for bodybuilding for women no that's talking about spiritually that's talking about character that God wants strong women of God strong women that know where they stand and know their convictions and know their principles he said she GTH her lo the strength and strength and arms and then later in verse 25 strength and honor strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come everything reeks everything comes from her is a strong woman of God it's strength even her clothing speaks of strength not IM modesty but strength in the Lord modesty in the Lord a beautiful woman they don't have to dress like an Alish or something I'm not knocking the Alish but her clothing even says I'm strong in the Lord I'm not weak I'm not sell making my body cheap to someone else showing parts of my body showing a little more leg and all this stuff that's weakness everybody's doing that but the woman of proverbs 31 she's not only strong and she's not only uh virtuous and she's not only uh taking care of the things of her household and doing all these things but yet she's her loins are GT with strength she strength in her arms and strength and honor are in her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come Hallelujah I don't have this scripture up there but I thought this was interesting as I found hundreds of scriptures related to this I can't read them all tonight this is about parents Ezra 9:12 says now therefore give Not Your Daughters unto their sons that's the Heathen don't give your daughters unto their sons neither Take Your Daughters unto your sons nor seek their peace or their wealth forever that ye may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for inheritance for your children forever did you hear what that just said who you give your daughters and sons to will either weaken you or strengthen you parents heads up heads up don't be weak when it comes who you give your sons and daughters to and by the way you do give them away but if you start getting weak and who they're giving away to and give them to the Heathen you're not going to be strong it's going to weaken Generations so you pray about it with them that's a serious thing that's a sober thing well I fell in love well praise the Lord I believe in love but I believe love has a lot more to it than just a feeling he says to the parents don't give your daughters to their sons don't give your sons and their daughters that ye may be strong families strong in the Lord eat the good of the how many want to eat the good of the land and leave an inheritance to your children forever that's not a physical inheritance that's a spiritual inheritance I'm going to go to the story in 1 Samuel chapter 3 13 now and there's so much that young people can learn out of this story it's a tragic story it's a terrible story it's not unbelievers it's Believers within the kingdom of God it's it's terrible the story of amnon and Tamar is a terrible story it's but it's in the Bible for some reason and every time we have something in the Bible it's for our admonition it's for for our instruction there's so much young people can learn from this story it's so relevant for today because in our time love is not understood true love genuine love even the love for a man for a wife has been misconstrued it's been Twisted it's been perverted and where has it been perverted in the minds of the young people to where today they don't know when you when I say love and they say love it could mean two different things they're thinking about because the generation has uh uh Tamp tempered with the meaning of love and so it it it's uh love this is so important for today because love is misunderstood love is not understood love is Twisted it's perverted and another thing that's uh messed up and not understood is strength as I just spoke of strength is interpreted as I said in physical strength or what uh pton Manning or uh Thomas Tom Brady could do in football and we look into our heroes for strength and the and uh the the you know there was a a little uh documentary on Tiger Woods that we were looking at when we come home and uh from Ireland and I just I wanted to go through it and see and such a rise and such a tragic story because the the push from his father to push him to the very top and he came to the very top golfer in the world and then to watch as he wasn't addressing things in his life then to watch him fall and have to go he went into sexual addiction and he had to go to different therapies for that and then he was in drug therapy and just just his life was all messed up and but yet you got this great Fame and this gate strength and nobody could beat him and the world Praises them and lifts them up because the world's Twisted about what's strong but inside he wasn't strong his Spirit wasn't strong so we got to be real careful that we don't take the world's view of what strong is what strength is 2 Samuel 13 and it came to pass after this that Absalon the son of David had a fair sister whose name was Tamar and amnon the son of David loved her a that is so beautiful a I tell you if you to stopped with that verse quit reading I didn't tell you to go any further yet if you stopped with that verse this would have been a normal love story she was fair and he loved her and all you can do is just go a that's so nice the baby's trying to do it right there oh but now you get to see what this love really was okay if you'd have stopped at that scripture then you wouldn't have read the story right or his mind right or the whole purpose because he's calling it love and amnon was so vexed what what's going on here this boy is calling this love but he proves it has nothing to do with love at every turn he proves he's using the term love but everything he does there's no love in it so my first point to the young people to learn love what is love love has honor love has respect love has obedience to God and to authorities right love is rooted in truth not lies and doesn't sneak around Love Goes deeper than sexual or natural attraction infatuation is a real thing you can be infatuated and then infatuation can turn to uh obsession that's what it did with amnon just an infatuation with her beauty turned to into an obsession with her obsession is not love a lustful obsession is not love so the first thing you have to learn about this story he's calling it love but everything he does from this point in his fruits to his life shows it's not love and the young people need to know how do I know it's true love brother Paul I may be attracted she may be pretty he may be handsome he may be good-look great wonderful but when you start using the term love don't think that just looks is love don't think that just attraction is love don't think that physical attraction to her body I must love her because I'm attracted to her body Love Goes deeper than that and so the second point I want to make to you young people is being vexed in your spirit for the opposite sex is never of God God provides peace if the relationship is right being vexed in your spirit for the opposite sex is never of God God provides peace if a relationship is right my third point to you any boy any boy or girl who is trying to push back god-given boundaries and protection is not to be trusted if you could take this girls and get you a magic marker and write it on your purse or something I don't know even this one any boy or girl who's trying to push back the god-given boundaries that's been laid in your hearts for all these years push back the boundaries and get around the protections that's a boy not to be trusted that's a girl not to be trusted thing the next point I want to make is but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of shimya David's brother and jonadab wasn't just a friend but was a very subtle man interesting word that comes from the fall in the Garden of Eden that the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field and so this jonadab somehow became the friend of amnon and he was subtle wrong kind of friend to have right anamon not only had a mind that was perverted and messed up he also chose the wrong type of friend young people are you listening if you got a mind that's messed up and then you choose the wrong friends which if your mind is messed up you're going to choose the wrong friends uh you got a double whammy going against you Amna not only had a mind perverted and messed up he also chose the wrong friend I think the definition of a friend today has been watered down so in order to have the right friends you must know how subtle your enemy is and that you must choose the right friends Point number four out of this lesson you must purpose that you can never have a close intimate relationship with someone who rejects your Christ or the convictions and principles you live by if they reject them they are really rejecting you maybe it hasn't happened yet but I got to tell you you know the story the moment this was over his love changed to anger and he ditched her out of the room hated her which which doesn't mean he loved her because how can you love her and then you hate her after the moment that you get and fulfilled your lust on her so you must purpose young people that you can never have a close intimate relationship with someone who rejects your Christ or convictions and principles you live by you should never have a close friendship like that acquaintances be cordial be nice but never form bonds with somebody who rejects your Christ or disrespects your Christ or disrespects your convictions the last point is amnon and his friend conceived the plan to draw Tamar out of her protected world out of the protection and headship of her parents into being in a place alone with him any guy or girl that draws someone else away from accountability and protection into being alone too much is not the right guy or the girl for you this applies even to private messages in private messages if he's drawing you out of the protection of your what you believe and what you stood for or for your what your church stands for or what your your parents is De for any guy or girl that's not the right guy or girl for you right it's not and this applies even to private messages can you say Amen praise the Lord so hey even the youth will become weak and faint but they that wait on the Lord even the youth the ones who await on the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up as wings as an eagle can you say Amen they shall run and not be worried they shall walk God God give us young people that will run and not be worried walk and not faint God give us young people that's strong God give us a church that's strong in the
