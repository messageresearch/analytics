TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and um let's just start reading that um verse seven to make the reading short genesis three and seven you have to say man the bible says in their eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sold fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked has thou eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou should is not eat amen let's go to ii timothy chapter one familiar verse of scripture and verse 7. the bible says for god have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and a sound mind amen may the lord bless me of his word you can have your seats amen praise the lord tonight by the grace of god i want to use for a subject under the influence under the influence and church before i i get to go on really what i want to talk about i want to show what man was before sin came in how he thought you know what his relationship was with god you know if we look right here in genesis we're gonna back up before chapter three you know in in when god made man god had fellowship with man god spoke his word man responded to the word man had a daily fellowship with the lord and what i want you to understand there was no fear there hallelujah he didn't run from god he was excited about that fellowship and one thing i want you to understand church this was something normal for man this wasn't something that we call supernatural this was a natural theme that god would come down and have fellowship with his creation but then something took place where that fellowship was broken hallelujah not only was it broken but the way mankind looked at god they looked at him different but let's understand this nothing changed about the lord nothing at all but something came into the minds of mankind the actions of mankind that made them look at god in a different way what was it it was the influence of fear and i wonder how often we as church people we walk around influenced by fear we're under the influence of fear that's the first thing we see after the fall it wasn't smoking it wasn't drinking it wasn't lying it wasn't cheating it was fear listen god does not change god is faithful see what we have to realize even when you mess up god's going to keep his end of the bargain hallelujah church even though adam and eve they messed up you know they they they did exactly what god told them not to do god faithfully still came down in the cool of the day like he always did so i'm saying to you tonight if you got things in your life that you are not proud of you are not to fear god but you ought to say lord help me because i know you see my iniquities lord help me because i know you see my fears oh yeah the lord saw their fears and he still calls them by name adam adam where are thou so i challenge you tonight church if you got something in your life don't be afraid to bring it to god because he knows all about it y'all y'all forgive me but you know i i i'm like a machine gun and and i'm really on fire because y'all got me plenty of room up here hallelujah but church we we look at it they took of the forbidden fruit but before they did that i want you to i want to drill this look at the attitude of man look at who he was before fear came in the prophet of god said adam would talk to the trees and the trees would obey last time i checked trees don't have ears trees don't have mines trees don't even have legs but when adam said get up and go they plugged up and they moved whoa hurry up and when he said it he wasn't afraid that it wasn't going to happen why because he had the mind of a god there was no fear there he was under the influence of the image and likeness of god [Applause] oh that's who we are church that's who we are when we come back to what god originally made us to be we are under the influence of the image and likeness of god i got to pull away from that because i'm gonna kind of go into some of that in the morning but church look at it adam was so much under the influence of god god will create things and bring it to adam and say you name it he was under such an influence of god he had the mind of god he wasn't going to name a lion a tiger why because god don't make mistakes and god was in adam [Applause] oh and when you get converted you come back hallelujah to what adam was remember the prophet god said everything adam lost is restored in jesus christ hallelujah so when you come under the influence of calvary's cross accepting jesus christ as your savior you come back to where god first created man and the reason why we don't operate like that is because of fear but another influence came in and then god in his faithfulness god comes down and he says adam adam where are thou first thing adam says is we hit ourselves they never hear before where did this fear come from it comes from the act they committed that god told them not to do and you know what fear is fear is the perversion of your imagination because you take a child a child to do something and then all their parents say i'm gonna get you when i get home and their mind will go ranting and raging in their mind they'll be sleeping with one eye open because daddy said he gonna get me when he get home or mama gonna get me when she get home see just those words make the imagination run wild what is it fear now if they wasn't worried they'll be sitting in daddy's chair when he get home but because of the wrong fear starts to project something that i hear all too often in the church and it's becoming so common we're saying it we're making it a part of who we are and we don't even realize it there's a word i guarantee you most of us have used here and there and don't even realize you're influencing yourself on the fear there's a word called my anxiety i'm getting sick of hearing people say my anxiety what you're doing you're confessing you got fear in your life [Applause] you're confessing that right now in that moment you're a product of the fall and what we say is my anxiety this my anxiety that my anxiety why are you claiming fear [Applause] god has not given us the spirit of fear but of love power and a sound mind [Applause] even when you mess up in your mind you ought to be able to say god is a merciful god [Applause] but we hear too much my anxiety and some of you in here and when it got anxiety pills no it's just get the fear out your life the very i wanna i wanna deal with your fear tonight the influence of fear listen church the way you get rid of your fear is to deal with it listen a friend of mine i was i was thinking about this word this word just kept ringing out of my spirit anxiety anxiety anxiety so i started studying it through the scripture when i got home my daughter she had a a she would tell was talking about her homework and she said my homework was panicked what it's called panic strategies i say panic strategies or what anxiety and i was like oh boy we better get into something even in school they're teaching the kids about anxiety and they're trying to show them ways that it's okay to be fearful create strategies to deal with your anxiety the only way you deal with fear is giving it to god he says cast your cares upon me take your burdens to the lord and leave it there hallelujah because we're not in the business of pacifying demons fear is a demon you notice what the prophet of god would do holy he get people in the prayer line and he go all the way back to their fears he said the reason why this happened because you did so and so and so the reason why this happened because this happened and that happened and that happened what is he doing he's getting the fear out of the way so god can deal with the problem well they'll teach you they'll have certain strategies like you know take deep breaths and do all these things all this nonsense but the only way you can deal with fear according to the scriptures get converted hallelujah hallelujah but the confession of it the confession of fear started with adam and eve first thing they said is we realized we were naked something they never realized before in their innocence they were all powerful in their innocence they operated as gods but when sin came in hallelujah they became fearful and they began to notice things about themselves that god was never worried about hallelujah they started looking at areas that god had covered by the word and when they got into a natural stage hallelujah they started looking at things from a natural eye as long as they were in the spirit hallelujah their sins were covered what they could do they never did behind the word but once they stepped out in front of the word their imagination started to run wow and now their imagination hallelujah is making our great merciful god out to be a brute that god that placed him in a garden of eden listen church listen to me good they had no real reason to be afraid of god he never did anything in a way that would make them afraid so what made them afraid was them now and catched us what made them afraid was the consequences of their actions and most of the times when we do things we know the consequences behind it hell yeah that's why when most people cheat and steal and rob and do all these things they do it in the dark because they don't want nobody to find out because they know in the broad daylight you can see who they are so they try to hide themselves they try to camouflage themselves and operate under the influence of darkness but the influence of light uncovers everything in the dark and now you see these two hallelujah with no real reason to fear god except breaking his word here they say after hearing their name call they say oh god we we we realized we were naked and we wouldn't put on our own fig leaves hallelujah amen you can pacify your fears but it's still there you can go 15 16 years and that fear that's still there from your childhood maybe somebody did you wrong but that fear is still there hell yeah and what does it do every time you get in that moment you start to get fidgety you start to get agitated and then you start saying things like oh my anxiety fear and simple things like that of your of your past things that are fair that you're fearful of you know you can bring that into a marriage you can raise children under that same influence of fear because it's something you were never delivered off and you think popping some pills gonna make it better no that's just pacify but you got to deal with the root cause because the root cause of a friend of mine she's a a social worker and you know i'm one of those people i like to find out what's going on out there so she deals with kids and all these things and i said you know what's one of the main things you deal with when you're dealing with anxiety she says depression because those two run together because when you got fear you feel like there's something in your life you can't quite overcome so then it starts to take you to a downward spiral so fear is connected to depression and too much depression is connected to suicide suicide is deaf hallelujah you see the power of fear but i come tonight with a solution and his name is jesus hallelujah he's the conqueror of every fear he's the conqueror of every situation hallelujah you know that there are women who are afraid to get married into a relationship because of something that happened to them when they were younger and then there are some who get married and cannot fully hardly be submissive because of something that happened and there are men hallelujah who may have gotten destroyed in relationships so when they get in a relationship they keep their guard up i'm a man i'm macho believe it or not sisters believe it or not one of one of the best things you can do for your husband and say you're just my big old macho man you make him blush from here to kalamazoo hallelujah what i want you to understand hallelujah fear strips us from our sanity when we ought to be holy happy and joyous and having a good time we come to church with fears in our life secrets in our life things that we're trying to cover up and keep in the dark when we're supposed to be in the light what's going on this is a delivery service oh yeah we're not taking fears out of here anymore we're giving them to god and let god deal with it i'm saying again he said cast your cares unto the lord hallelujah but the same friend of mine who's a social worker holly she can relate you know why because she has fears she told me when she was younger she was bit by a dog i think going to the mailbox or something like that she was bit by a dog now she's a grown woman living her life but every time she go to the mailbox she runs and get that mail and she's looking out for a dog keep in mind none of her neighbors have dogs may not even be a dog in the neighborhood now i'm gonna take that back i'll tell you that somebody probably has a dog but there's something that triggers that fear so she may have went to the mailbox the dog and that fear starts to come back dawg will be four blocks over just the sound of it triggers something she never got over hallelujah and there are things in your life and in my life hallelujah that if god hasn't dealt with it something will trigger it and it'll cause you to tiptoe when you ought to be walking and strive because you're living by the glory of god listen church her imagination rumbles and goes and takes it all over the place every time she goes to the mailbox and the last time i checked since that first time she's gotten bit by a dog she's never gotten bitten again so what is there to fear she's creating a scenario in her mind how often do we create certain scenarios in our mind god tells you come and give your life and you say but lord i got this but lord i did that but lord but lord but lord if he's telling you that means he has enough grace to forgive you [Applause] hallelujah but under that influence they could still hear god call hallelujah they could hear the sovereign voice of god with fear in it life so you can't tell me tonight that god hasn't talked to you you can't tell me tonight hollywood that god hasn't told you to deal with your fears hallelujah but you know some of us are stubborn we will hear the word of god and we'll walk right out of here with the same old stuff in our lives and you know what it becomes then it becomes torment remember the woman that committed adultery husband while he was away in the military the prophet talked about her and everything was fine and then all of a sudden she started getting sick why does she start getting sick because the the atmosphere of fear she was suppressing in her body began to develop a uh unbalanced chemical uh chemical imbalance in her body that's what fear will do fear it will do stress to make your air come out fear will cause you to not eat and lose weight oh my somebody needs to get rid of their fear tonight but she went for years and years with that fear in her life the prophet of god say she had to go to the doctor and they wanted to take honor give her anesthesia she said oh no she couldn't do that because then she'd be under another influence and under that influence she might tell the story so there is an influence where the real you will come out hallelujah there's something that can bring out the real you hallelujah amen and although we may have fears there's something we call the word of god that can bring out the real you hallelujah it wasn't until hallelujah i heard this message of the hour that the real me came out earlier the real me wasn't a truck driver the real me hallelujah wasn't some young sinner but the real me is a child of god and as long as i had fears i would never be able to come to god but listen if i can i don't want to be too long but if we think about influence you look at the influence from where adam and eve was and then sin came in and look where they went they went from a place of being confident being able to feel all of god's thoughts my god would just ask them and they say yes lord and they just fulfill god's desire but then fear came in they started running from god they said we heard your voice the voice they always heard and they said we we realized we were naked and we wouldn't hit ourselves and i love god's response god says who told you you was naked oh my what is he saying who told you to be afraid who told you to be afraid tonight church god already knew he was naked god didn't ask him are you naked he said who told you you was naked see god is saying i already know he was naked i just wasn't looking at your nakedness the way you looking at it now cause when i looked at your nakedness i saw innocence [Applause] but because of sin you're looking at your negatives and you say oh my god i have to run from you god already knew that he said who told you he was naked you know adam adam was afraid you know what he said the woman it's default it's the reason why i'm like this it's my husband it's my wife it's my children it's the people in the church and oh god it has to be brother paul we blame our fears on everybody else holy accept our own imagination [Applause] they begin to pass the fears down he says the woman the woman says the serpent servant had nobody to accuse so god brought judgment hallelujah because they let fear come in something that was holy and sovereign sure now let's pick up from here everybody all right now we should be real hyped up because we had a bunch of sugar all day long we had pure apple cider we had who they had donuts we had pie galore we ought to be up here like brother price price we ought to be here like everybody to have red bull hallelujah but church from there what fear starts to do fear starts to create an atmosphere of evil because man is no longer hardly connected with god now they're going out doing everything in their imagination and now their thoughts hollya are evil their ways are evil because of fear everything is trickled down to something god doesn't like and that by the time we get over here in genesis uh genesis the sixth chapter the bible says that god hollywood saw the wickedness of man was was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually the perversion of fear moving with the imagination of men hallelujah everything in that place was evil and god looked at it and the bible says that god repented that he even made man look at how god looks at you when you have fear in your life because he knows he's the answer to every solution but now man has gotten wicked and wicked and wicked the imagination and thoughts everything is getting evil and evil and evil and then god comes down in the midst of all this evil hallelujah in the midst of all this fear all the stuff going on and then he drops down in verse 6 and verse 8 he says but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord oh my see church the whole world was under the influence of fear and then god comes in and he gives noah another influence he said no i'm gonna put you and your whole family under the influence of grace think about it church we all got things that we're influenced by brothers in the i.t give me that um that uh image of the um the the samson tv see that for all of us who got a monitor or a tv or uh what we call them androids apples and all that stuff your television monitor that's what it looked like talk to me church yours mines well whoever wherever you buy best buy wherever you get it from it got all those influences on it honey you got all those influences on it hallelujah but you know what happened leave it up there for a second you know what happened holy we were smart enough not to get cable and all these other things and have the cable man coming out hooking up dish work dish network but satan was also smart enough i'm gonna give him the internet and nobody has to know what you're watching in your house hallelujah hallelujah i say hallelujah but you know one way or another you're getting influenced by something over here most of us is something called netflix that to each his own whatever where's your whistle and for some of us it's hulu but for those of us who are mature i'm mature i got the word i need to see what's going on in the world it's cnn go fox news but let me ask you something if you spend hours and hours watching cnn or fox news which one is worse hulu netflix fox news cnn ain't no big sin ain't no small scene all of it fit in the same category look and to make it even more more simple look there's nothing wrong with a tv that looks like this nothing there's nothing wrong with it with all these different lifetimes all the stuff fx now and amc whatever all the stuff is tbs i heard brother donnie say one time i thought it was t what is it tbs tbc what is it the christian channel tbn he said i'm gonna give me some tbn and watch it heard brother donna say tbn tear binding network [Laughter] oh my what you think about it church all these things look bravo and whatever else hbo to go how are you going to get some hbo to go where you're going with it nowhere you're going to sit on your couch and feel free to move the movie you see how satan does what he does he plays mind games hbo to go that don't sound so bad hey i'ma get i'ma get something to go going nowhere but listen church there's nothing wrong with all that you can buy and by god's grace you pay attention to what your pastor preached because he may come in and he may then have services where he's been hammering the tv you pay attention to what he's saying holy i'm just being inspired right now holy i'm just just the blood the just the bloodhound is off the chain right now and right now he's digging up some stuff that's in the yard but you pay attention what your pastor say there's nothing wrong hallelujah if you got a monitor or tv with all the stuff on it harley stars can't hurt you who cares your netflix did none of that can't hurt you what hurts you holly is the kind of spirit you got hallelujah see it's the spirit behind the person that has the tv see hulu can't do nothing to me except i activate it never black flags can't do nothing to me except i it see it's the person behind the thing with the remote harley it's the influence inside of you which makes that good or bad because remember the problem that god said the tv could be for you for good but but what happens you got too many unconverted people waiting in their house but these are a lot of influences and you know what can i be transparent i know your boy y'all ready for me to tell on myself i've even uh uh not one of these but you know you you you the devil's so crafty you say man i think i'm trying to get me some nfl trying to get me some something you know trying to watch you get a and the devil so crafty he'll give you a a a free must trial somebody talk to me give you a free month trial you got to come out with nothing and in your mind you say well i'ma just watch this one thing get this free month trial and i'm good and i'm gonna cancel it and how many of us we got it and forgot we had it and you still paying for it cause you never got all the codes you never got everything that you signed up with and they getting your money every month oh yeah why what happens spiritually hallelujah we go into revenues we're going to places and we open up things in our lives and we give the devil a free pass and we forget how he gets there [Applause] because we gave we accepted a free prescription let me tell you something ain't nothing free in this world but the gospel holiday i ain't fussing i'm talking about being under the influence holly give me the next one brother if that one don't get you that one i get you if i was a dude what like they do at the concerts cut the lights out and there's everybody saying light it up everybody cut them lights on cell phones go look [Music] because a cell phone is like life and death but it's one of the greatest influences in our life sometimes i like talking to younger folks well i tell them we used to go around we had no cell phone really yo well how did y'all get where y'all was going we got there well how did you see your friends at school the next day or when we got home from school and only they have no comeback for that so all they can say is you owe but you think about it when there was less influences in our life life was more safe hallelujah mama lafontaine wasn't worried about y'all when y'all went out to the store hallelujah but now because we have so much different influences and this thing right here is causing so much anxiety if we just start with ig and then you come back how many likes did i get oh man i didn't get too many likes so i need to do something else what is it it's the influence hallelujah same thing with the guys they get on there and do something how many likes that get didn't get that many the influence of somebody else's thoughts shouldn't control your life but now they call this stuff social media and i got a cell phone too what i mean but there's nothing wrong with an apple there's nothing wrong with an android i refuse to get out because apple's cursed i like android because i like being out of this world but if you take hallelujah just the phone itself there's nothing wrong with it's the spirit of the person who has the phone if you're under the wrong influence these things are going to control your life and parents don't be so gullible don't be so gullible they talking right now but it's any and everything on tick-tock if your child has a tick-tock account you need to be asking them questions any and everything goes on these sites and tick tock is not even an american app it comes from the chinese and i heard hallelujah that this tick tock has surpassed facebook instagram everything it has over a billion subscribers monthly but it's the influence behind the thing and you see our children in this whole world fall under the influence of social media when god wants us to be under the influence like noah grace hallelujah amen let me come on down but listen church listen to the word influence influence the capacity to have an effect on the character whatever's influencing you it has an effect on your character instagram has an effect on your character facebook has an effect on your character espn hulu netflix these things that influence us has an effect on our character hallelujah and if you love churchill and influenced by the word of god it has an influence on your character hallelujah so are you under the influence tonight listen the capacity to have an effect on the character development so there are things in your life hallelujah that can influence your character development holy young girls don't get mad at your mother because she's fussing at you about cooking and cleaning washing and drying don't get mad about what's happening she's trying to influence your character development so when you get married you don't have those problems brothers don't give young brothers don't get mad at your dad when you say boy get out of there cut that grass and you're not using the riding lawnmower he's dealing with your character development he's trying to influence you holly and show you what hard work is all about so when you get a family it'll be something easy because you grew up working hard but you know what let's get the boys now some of their greatest influences are right in their hands and now this stuff is on such a whole nother level they're playing games with headsets headsets talking to somebody in south carolina they down here in toledo we're being captivated by these things holy when the greatest influence church when all this was going on god came down hallelujah and gave noah grace what was that grace it's going to rain but now he tells no he has to get no under the influence he says noah i want you to build a boat but listen to noah he had to be under such an influence he had to believe in something he never saw he had to believe in something hallelujah listen listen to me good he had to believe in something there was no vindication of now that's what you call a powerful influence this man had to stay faithful hallelujah building a boat with no signs no wonders he had to build the boat hallelujah with a family hurry he had to build a boat be a husband build a boat be a father build a boat be a son he had to stay under the right influence [Music] and his influence had to be so great that it could influence those around him who didn't understand what the influence is all about can you imagine y'all know i've dramatized a lot can you imagine knowing that maybe 10 years here in building that boat and now his boy is getting a little bigger and he ain't spending as much time with him no more he's like come on dad let's go shoot ball and be like okay all i can play is one game this time cause i got to get back to the boat so you go out there and play i don't know what y'all play what y'all play up at 21. we played 26 down south but anyway get out there you play a 21 or 26 and be like okay boys i got to go i got to go back to the boat they said dad you was winning you gonna leave he said yeah i'm gonna go ahead and finish this up but i'll whip up on y'all tomorrow but right now i gotta get back to the boat his influence is life and death to him so he's out there working on the boat hold up and you know what he just had a good time with his boys his boys had a good time with him but you know what's happening his boys are watching his dedication to that influence hallelujah so he keeps working he keeps working hallelujah and the boys come back and say hey dad you want to play one more game he said hey i got one more game in me he comes back hallelujah and he breaks their ankles again he breaks and dunks does all that stuff on him he say i got y'all again and he goes back to the ark hallelujah and you know probably after a week of that his boys say hey dad that was real fun but you know what we're gonna do we're gonna help you build on the ark so they come back now now his influence is rubbing off on them [Applause] wow the influence of god the influence of the word here with no vindication what is the vindication for the boys their father's faithfulness [Applause] hurry up he's influencing his boys by just being faithful and next thing you know they're beating the trees getting the sap out of it they're like hey dad we're going to help you out so we can have more time to play 26. y'all know kids always have an alternative motive they ain't just cleaning that room up for nothing but you know what noah had to keep had to keep going and you know that what people brother branham said there probably were other boats in that day because they're looking at noah and they say he ain't going to build a boat i can build a boat too but the thing about his boat his boat hollywood was being built by the mind of god he was under the influence of grace so think about the church hallelujah even when noah's boys came on they had no vindication of what was really happening all lord was getting it straight from god because it was hallelujah coming from god's grace there was nothing that could go wrong and everything that was happening was supposed to happen and you know what probably one day after you get the boys because you know he was a husband too you know his wife brother come in you know sister noah said hey noah you know what we ain't had date night this week he said okay honey where you want to go she said i want to go to uh crocodile and some of y'all sister man please ain't no date night ain't no crack about i want to go to ko yotos get me some japanese or something but you know what he go out have date night and then he go back go back to the boat when his wife come on say honey wasn't that just a nice time he said yeah you know i always enjoy spending time with you hey you're in my life you're my joy but right now i gotta stay with this grace and he keeps working and keep working keep working then the next week come and he said hey honey you know it's date night he said okay take a little break really he gonna have date night again have date night date night over with he go back to the boat again why he's under the influence he's under the influence he's working and working and working working and then one day by his surprise the influence is just moving all over the place his wife comes in and she has a basket she said honey you know the night is date night he said yeah honey where you want to go she said no we're gonna have date night on the boat we're gonna have date night right here all around the tools all around everything just sit on down we're gonna see right here and have date night they sit right they have date night in the midst of all the work all the boat all the stuff all the hyps up all that stuff laying around they say red dead and have date night because his wife she appreciates his faithfulness and now she's falling in line with the influence and i know it has his whole family under the same influence with no vindication [Applause] all he has is the word of god and he's under that influence now he has his whole family helping bill a boat he didn't compromise his children he didn't compromise his wife he just stayed under the influence let me tell you something you getting upset with the message is not gonna save your family you compromising service and staying home and that ain't gonna win nobody to christ you just stay faithful [Music] you stay faithful god will take care of everybody else hurry up all lord had to do was stay faithful and god took care of everybody else brothers give me that give me that quote i gave you y'all i'm about to close y'all know i'm coming down look look at this he says now notice last night we left abraham where god had confirmed the covenant with him that he would swallow by himself an oath by himself there's no other greater than he swear by that he would keep his promise to abraham and his seed and the promise was given unconditionally listen and what we were trying to do was to get the fear out of the people's hearts and minds that's one of the greatest curses that's in the church today is the people who are afraid to lay hold on god's word the promise if he promised it that means it's yours and you shouldn't be afraid to take god at his word in my closing there's a lot of other things i can say but i think y'all get it right now we've all been influenced by this world but what we have to realize is we're in this world but we're not of this world you say not me i'm a child of god ain't nothing in this world influencing me oh yeah but i guarantee you uh a couple months ago you was walking around every day with a mask on every time you went outside why because you was under the influence of the laws that they was passing and you either had to fall in line or suffer the consequences and all of us we try to dress it up we got ohio state mass we got wolverine mask we got jesus christ man we got all kind of gucci louis vuitton all kind of nike masks we try to make win a marriage pleasurable but i want to let you know church i never became one under that influence i never got used to wearing a mask why because the scripture says no matter what happens hallelujah by his stripes i am healed so how can i fully be influenced by mass saying that mass is my security when i'm influenced by isaiah 53. listen there are people in this world right now who've been so influenced by cover 19 they haven't been back to church yet they're under the wrong influence what is it fear there's too many people gathering in church we gathered in church before we knew there was a cover 19 disease i'm gonna show you something there's nothing new under the sun right how many ever had the flu probably all of us right and you still here let me ask you something how many times you had the flu you put on a mask nobody i'm gonna shock you for a second one of the symptoms of the flu is chills one of the symptoms of covet is chills one of the symptoms of the flu is high fevers one of the centers of covert is high fevers and you know if you let the flu carry on too long you develop water in your lungs and things like that fluid in your lungs what is one of the symptoms of cold fluid in your lungs can't sound like the same thing to me how long has the symptoms of the flu been around for eons it's been here forever people been getting chills people getting fevers and people been recovering and this is the kick over here people been coming to church with the flu hey so pretty much all of the same symptoms so what makes covet greater than the flu fear the attitudes of the people we make it stronger than what it is and as for your six feet come here bro stand up here all right don't you walk back to your seat all right now say stay right there right uh do about six feet right here right well that's far out here let's get a little bit closer about six feet what's your name bro nehemiah praise god didn't look to the left or to the right he stayed right with moses teaching okay nehemiah i want you to go back to your seat now they tell us to stay six feet apart right but if me and nehemiah are in church and i got to go the same way nehemiah go i'm gonna walk right into nehemiah's disease [Laughter] so what good is it six feet it's all in your mind six feet don't mean nothing cause if we in a grocery store for me to get up there and pay for my stuff i got to walk in your six and feet person behind me got to walk in my six feet so you know we are we're just a bunch of six feet walking people but what makes that good or bad is the spirit within you and before i close i was one of those people you know they got this vaccination thing going on now right you know i was one of those people i don't care what they come out with i ain't taking that i got the blood achieved but it's straight i'm healed vaccination i'm already vaccinated in jesus they hate to see me coming and you know what i still believe that but you know we got to be sane christian we can't be afraid and a brother came down to church and he was preaching he said you know now that they're making some of this stuff mandatory to keep your job they're making it mandatory now i can't say god i ain't saying that god can't move on your job or whatever but if you get to the place to where you have to take it or not take it and keep your job what you're going to do you're going to stand up and say i'm a believer they'll say okay mr believer go take that shot keep your job or you're going to pray about it however you handle it but what i'm saying for me was because you hear all the stuff about it you might not be able to have children and all this stuff and honestly church i ain't got time to go study what's going on in the world i got time to get consumed about all this stuff i stay with the word hallelujah and me personally hallelujah i believe we already got the answer but you know what a brother came and he was preaching and he said you know what this this stuff gonna get mandatory in a job to keep your job this blah blah blah he says but if you come to me and i gotta take it he said i'm gonna bind up the devil and go take the shot and i say you're gonna find the devil take the shot he said yeah the scripture says if you take off any deadly thing it shall not harm you i say i'm free because see what that scripture does is take away all the fear hallelujah it takes away all the fear whether you take it or not that's up to you but if i got to take it i ain't afraid to take it holy and if i don't take it i ain't afraid i hadn't taken it hardly so either way around i'm all right because our god is faithful amen and just to tell you that that scripture is true there's a missionary brother i know named brother andre and brother andre was in venezuela hallelujah uh do do a missionary work to the indians and these indian people are very cannibalistic you go into these areas they will cook you and fry you and he went back there under the leadership of god you know how you go places sometimes brother abraham paul says hey brother i sure would like for you to come with me he said god over there no you better be led by god he said he got over there he's back in the back before you get all the way back there there's a sign that says do not go back here because back here the chief has all authority the government can't help you so he said he was back there doing missionary work him and his him and his uh interpreter and different things and he's back there a couple days he says one guy maybe by his third day this guy had like a little uh a little glass with some stuff in it and he tucked the glass and slammed it down in front of brother andre and he was like what what is he doing he says this stuff right here i've been putting your food for the past three days trying to poison you and kill you he says but you've been eating it and you've been preaching you've been drinking it and you've been preaching and that man hallelujah fell on his knees and said leave me to your god that's the god we serve we are not to fear he is the protector when you are under the right influence hallelujah and brother andre was under the influence of the word of god and god was his protector if you take of any deadly things it shall not harm you and when you're under the right influence it'll leave other people to the cross in my closing i'm gonna close my bible i'm gonna just i'm gonna just quote it y'all know i'm about to close listen when we get to joshua god comes to joshua the first thing he says moses my servant is dead i don't want you to be influenced by that he said he dead he said now i'm going to use you i'm going to use you i'm going to bring you into the promised land that i told moses about but i'm not going to deal with moses anymore i'm going to deal with you now god is taking his influence off of moses and putting it on him and now he's telling joshua this is what i want you to be i want you to be strong and courageous oh yeah this is god talking to his servant i want you to be strong and courageous and then he comes to joshua he tells joshua there'll be no one able to stand before you what if god told you that there'll be nothing able to stand before you wherever the soul of your feet shall try i have given it to you for a possession church y'all realize every time joshua went out to fight he was under the influence of that word he was under the influence that there's nothing being able to stand before you hallelujah joshua wasn't waiting on everybody else to fight the promise was his joshua would just go fire why he was under the influence of what god said every time he go to battle he'd go out there ah they're looking at him what's wrong josh don't know he didn't even get us a chance to set up a game plan in his mind all he hears is there's nothing and no one be able to stand before you only be thou strong and courageous strong and courageous is not waiting on this brother holly stronger grace is not what stronger rages is god i remember ah [Applause] i remember what you said lord all i got to do is be strong and courageous hallelujah he was worried about what everybody else was doing god told him wherever your feet go i've given to you for possession be strong and courageous do you remember joshua went to battle he went to fight ai huddly and he lost the battle and you know what that just messed joshua up because dog joshua could think about it is i'm not supposed to lose see he's still under that influence wow and you know what our problem is brother tom some of us have gotten used to losing we've gotten used to losing and we're under the influence of losing and fearing these things no church we're the church of joshua be strong and courageous some of you got sickness in your body right now that you're afraid of it's a message that was preached in this church and i don't know if y'all caught it but i didn't watch it at least twice stop crying and speak what's that name of it y'all remember that message about three of you go back and watch this online what a powerful message your pastor preached y'all talking about somebody else no y'all passed the preacher's message stop crying and speak god will put you in positions just so you can open your mouth and then he'll show you haven't i always been god haven't i always been there for you why are you crying why are you so fearful i have not given you the spirit of fear that was preached in this church now joshua he gathers the whole church the bible says he has a solemn assembly to gather up everybody he said hey y'all know what we just lost the battle and he told us oh everybody y'all know what i ain't supposed to lose so somebody did something wrong and i'm gonna find you out this church is not supposed to be stagnant we have a message from god joshua had a message from god we have a message from god our church is not supposed to be defeated our church is not supposed to be stagnant our families are not supposed to be straggling hallelujah we have a word from god it's time for us to be strong and courageous be that christian that the devil is telling you you can't be joshua gathers up everybody and come to find out aiken he took the babylonians and all that stuff and what i love about it joshua didn't play with it joshua killed him his mama his daddy his cousins his cousin laws he killed everybody probably killed his dog his cat and everything else joshua killed everything that was connected to him why hallelujah because he was operating under fear wow if you can't obey the word of god it's because you got fears in your life church so god he dealt with him hallelujah dealt with everybody that was connected to him kill everything burn it all hallelujah and then he went back and fought the same people that he lost to he lied right back up and you know apollo was some of my dad they said why are we doing why are we doing this again we just lost why are we fighting these people again we just lost this man why we why what john [Applause] hallelujah joshua knew what god told him and he wasn't afraid to believe it while everybody else is reasoning and thinking about what we're going to do with our strategies and all this oh joshua and his mind is be strong and very courageous in my closing again joshua was so sure of what god told him the word he was so sure of the word one day joshua was praying and as he looked up there was someone standing before him glistening and shining but you know what joshua didn't know who he was and all joshua could hear is there'll be no one able to stand before you so in that moment josh will say who are you are you forced or against us what else was he gonna do he forced the angel of god to identify himself johnson was so ready to fight angels because he believed what god told him that's why hallelujah paul hurry and even our prophet could say if an angel would say anything different from what god gave me let them be a curse [Applause] whoa that's when you know what you're supposed to know the prophet of god was so confident like all these people talk about the message and this is off and that is off the property god was so confident hallelujah he went to a set up one day hallelujah they were setting them up and god showed them they gonna set you up he said but don't worry i'll be with you go ahead let them set you up hallelujah and he went right into the meeting 300 or 400 preachers sitting there huddling ready to set him up how he laid his bible out there he said what is it he said is it the way i preach marriage in the voice is it the way i preach water baptism is it serpent seed he say i challenge anyone of you bring your bible come stand next to me and prove it wrong and i say that to those who don't believe it this day get your bible and prove it wrong and after he made that statement he said that's what i thought because nobody came forward what was it they were afraid what happened they saw a man under a real influence and then after he said after he said that he said if you can't prove it wrong then stay off of my back hallelujah joshua made the angel identify himself he signed the captain of the lord's host then joshua put his sword away bowed down in worship but if he would identify himself there'll be another scripture that says joshua fought an angel because he believed the word of god there was no fear in joshua trusting the lord so church come on musicians i'm closing what is the greatest influence in your life even in this service is god getting the full potential out of you or you got things that's keeping you suppressed or you got secrets that nobody else knows about that's connected to social media or you got things going on in your house that you're not proud of don't let that stop you from getting closer to god because i want to let you know right now although i may not know god knows so nobody's hiding anything from him there's no need to be afraid i'm gonna make it real simple hallelujah what you are afraid of god already knows about it and you're still if he alive to kill you he would have killed you already cause some of us have been toting it for years don't live under the influence of fear imagination run wow and i'm sure y'all understand and know that you guys have been blessed so let's continue in the blessing don't hold up the progress bringing all these unhidden things in here all these things that stuff's the church all these things that hold back the worship you know that song i've been touched by fire we should have been in here turning this place upside down i've been touched by fire i heard that song about two weeks ago at brother jesse smith's church we sung about five times because the anointing fell down and we started really realizing i've been touched by fire come and watch me burn i go jesus has saved my life oh my let's pray if you're thinking right now how how do i get there what do i do about my fears we're going to enter in through an avenue called worship and then you make your way to drop all your fears off at god we make a miracle worker promise keeper light in the darkness my god that is [Music] my god [Music] night in my darkness [Music] [Music] [Applause] that is
