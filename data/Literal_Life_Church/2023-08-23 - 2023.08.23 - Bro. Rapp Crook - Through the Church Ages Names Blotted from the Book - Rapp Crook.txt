========================================

thank you I'm not sure if we're seeing each other but we'll see how far along we get give me a sign if you think we're good to go uh Revelation chapter 3 verses 5 and 6. um reads heated overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and I will not blot out his name out of The Book of Life but I will confess his name before my father and before his Holy Angels he that hath an ear to hear he that has an ear let them hear what the spirit saith unto the churches we just asked the word of prayer here Heavenly Father we just uh thank you for your goodness and your grace to us Lord I Thank You for Your Presence you're among us I just pray oh father that you would just uh be with us this evening Lord I just pray that you'd anoint my words anoint your understanding father we might see more clearly about the book of life and your characteristics of of justice and mercy Lord and grace of God in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated we'll see if this works or not what I wanted to start out by pointing out in this in this scripture it shows the importance of of overcoming in the age because the Imp it starts out heated overcometh uh the same will be clothed in a white Raymond his name will be blotted out of the book of life so the importance of overcoming because if you overcome your names in The Book of Life and then the implication is if you don't overcome then it has it has a serious result your name could be blotted out of the book of life and then verse six how do we overcome it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches so we we overcome by hearing what God hearing and receiving what God is speaking and continuing to hear continuing to listen as God speaking that in each age the message to Sardis ends the way every message every Church age ends without all important reminder hear what the spirit is continuing to say to the churches um it's like we talked about last time and this will be on page one in the notes um we talked last time about names that are in the Book of Life and then names aren't recorded all in the Book of Life I read from a read from the quote from the sardisian church age brother Branham says we'll certainly will actually show by scripture that multitudes who are not even born again will go into eternal life as strange as that may sound and I think that's interesting to see because as we look at the topic like the book of life it could almost um especially a topic like this season we're going to focus on that how some names are blotted from the book and sometimes God's justice can seem overwhelming and sometimes when you're dealing with kids either as a parent or as a teacher it seems you get caught in the Catch-22 I'm either going to be just or I'm going to be merciful and you've got there's a good comp and there's a bad cop but they're not mutually exclusive it's not that God is either just or merciful he's both and sometimes we feel like we get in a position where I'm going to either be just or merciful that's not how it is at all and as we look at the book of life we see God's justice but we also see his Mercy like we saw last time there are people's names who were who who weren't who who were like Christ when the parable and he sowed the the wheat seed then someone else came along um the the evil man came along after that and sowed tears but those tears still enjoy the mercy of God in this life it's not like God is throwing thunderbolts at them the whole time the rain falls and they have they can have a good life too God they still enjoy God's mercy now and then we're going to look at names blogger from The Book of Life we're presented people are presented with a choice um like in Joshua 24 15 choose you this day whom you will serve you can choose bail if you want to serve week or or as for me and my house will serve the Lord and God is just to let you make that choice and then let you enjoy the results or the consequences of that choice First Kings 18 21 says this is at this is at Mount Carmel Elijah said how long will you halt between two opinions if Baal be God will serve Baal but if God be God to serve him and we can't we can't stay on the middle of the fence for a long time the only get we the only thing we get by sitting on the fence is splinters in our behind we have to get off the fence and make a decision which way are we actually going to uh to make a stand because what we're going to see this evening as we look at why names get blotted from The Book of Life is the idolatry and the Book of Life are two things that aren't going to go together you you can't choose your own God and to also expect God to let everything work together for good idolatry in The Book of Life they just don't go together I'll take a look at the couple Old Testament scriptures here perhaps we can turn in our Bibles um sometimes it could be nice not having a screen because we actually have to get our Bibles out and we can then we can open them and look at them um the book of Deuteronomy chapter 29. when we look in the Old Testament we see that when the Old Testament speaks of names being blotted from The Book of Life it's almost always in connection with involvement and idolatry and we'll see uh the first example we'll take a look at this from the book of Deuteronomy chapter 29 and verse 16. for you and this is a Moses speaking to the children of Israel for you know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt and how we came to the Nations which he passed by you have seen their Abominations and their Idols wooden Stones silver and gold which were among them we went by and saw them you've seen their Abominations you've seen all that then he says lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart is turned away this day from the Lord Our God to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth Gall and world he repeats that Lester should be among you Lester should be among you because we have seen so much of God we've seen so much of his goodness and Grace for us he provided for us on the way through the Wilderness he did all these things for us and lest as we go through the mall unless as we go through these shopping centers and we see these other things of this world that we want to go after lest we should have that this listen he says Lester should be that and it come to pass when he hears the words of this curse that he should bless himself in his heart saying hey I'll have peace even though I walk in the imagination of my heart I'll have the story of the ends happily ever after even if I do what I want to do even when I'm going away from turning my back on God I'm going to get the best of both worlds that's what Moses is talking about though I walk in the imagination of my heart to add drunkenness to thirst he says the Lord will not spare him you can't have the best of both worlds because then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon them and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven and here is the first place where we see but one of the first places we see in the Old Testament where the name being blotted out from the book has this connection with involvement in idolatry and brother Brandon says in the church age book he says here in Deuteronomy 29 is pronounce the curse against idolatry or spiritual fornication if we think about the sin of fornication that's a serious sin that this is a complete betrayal of a trust relationship that's exactly how serious it is to God when we turn our heart away from him as just like your boyfriend or girlfriends are are are cheating on you and and and that happened the pain that God's heart has I think the book of Jeremiah talks about how how God cries in his heart God suffers pain he can have that and that's how the sin of fornication affects God that's what idolatry is is the tribe that turned to idolatry was to have its name blotted out and this warning that we see in the book of Deuteronomy is actually it actually happens there are there are there are two tribes that have um several times I they they give in to the tendency for idolatry you see first of all in the book of um judges I think it's chapter 17 at the end of the Book of Judges um Israel is characterized in those days there was no king in Israel there was no absolute but every man did that which was right in his own eyes and I listened to that summary and that reminds us of the world that we live in there's no absolute everybody does what's right in their own eyes and they think they should have the best results in spite of the decision that they make well on Judges chapter 17 you have a young man named Micah and I think he's a I think um I think he is an ephraimite and um he ends up stealing some money from his mother and then he ends up getting caught I believe for and he or feels bad about me confesses it to his mother and she says oh wow you're such a good boy do you confess that you can have the money anyway and they end up making an idol in their house and this is an Ephraim and later he ends up getting a another man to come and be his his priest that's not a uh the other man that comes along is a levite so Micah recognizes this man is a better priest than I am because I'm not a levite but um the the Dan Knights who had their possession in the southern part of Israel that's what they were given they were having a hard time possession of the land that God had given them so they said let's go somewhere easier and they go all the way up to the north part of Israel and as they're going along they see this man Mike and I see this priest I said let's get this priest to come with us the priest moves out he goes to the highest bidder takes his false gods with him and they go up and smite the danites so this idolatry begins in Ephraim and then it's transported up to Dan and these seeds of idolatry are sown and they start to Fester later the children of Israel after after David dies after Solomon dies Solomon's son rehoboam becomes king and 10 of the tribes follow rehoboam Judah sorry 10 of the tribes followed jeroboam and just Judah and Benjamin I believe it is stay with King rehabalam Solomon's son well there's a place in Ephraim that's Bethel that's pretty close to Judah and Jerusalem and King jeroboam has this fear that if I don't give the people a place to come and offer their sacrifices they're going to keep going to Jerusalem and they're going to slowly trickle out of my church and go to rehoboam's church and I don't want that so jeroboam he ended up instituting a system of idolatry they're in Bethel in the southern part of Israel close to where Jerusalem would be and he does the same place in the north part of Israel Dan which is really far away he says these people it's too much for them to try to make the trip all the way down to Jerusalem too much for them to make their way all the way down to Bethel I'm just going to make another altar up there so it's a religion of convenience and these two tribes they completely go into the system of idolatry Lock Stock and Barrel and the the they had been warned against this you think you can do whatever you want and enjoy God's blessing at the same time it's not that way and in the Book of Revelation the warning was if a tribe does this they will have their name blaunted out and you see in first in the middle page of the notes you see that the reference from First Kings 12 about how the one altar set up in Bethel the other one set up in Dan but if we can turn it over to Revelation chapter 7 we can see this is the uh this is the ceiling of the 144 000 and we can see which names are sealed and there'll be two names that are missing because we don't we don't mess around with with God's warnings we can have a mom or dad sometimes we're gonna teach in the classrooms if you do this this will be happening and all of a sudden you get merciful you don't do anything if God has a line and we cross the line he's gonna he's gonna follow up on on his warning and Ephraim and Dan crossed that line so in Revelation chapter 7 this is the ceiling of the hundred forty four thousand Jews verse verse 4 it says I heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed 144 000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel it says all the tribes of the children of Israel but we're going to name them verse 5 of the tribe of Judah of the tribe of Reuben of the tribe of GAD each one were stealed twelve thousand for six of the tribe of Asher and naftali and Manassas were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of Simeon Levi and izakar were sealed twelve thousand verse 8 of the tribe of zebulun and Joseph and Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand nowhere do we see in Revelation chapter 7 of the tribe of Dan and of the tribe of Ephraim were sealed twelve thousand because God had said if you do this I'm warning you don't play around with idolatry because if you do that I will lot your name out from under Heaven out of the book of life so we see this connection very clear here between idolatry and having a name blotted from The Book of Life another example that we see is in the book of Exodus chapter 32 this past we can turn there and here you see Israel is hardly on their way out of Egypt they hardly get through the uh through the Red Sea and through the Wilderness and then they come up in Exodus chapter 32. are you running it up there okay very good thank you I do get control that's important and Exodus chapter 32 Moses has been up on the mountain and he comes back down and he sees uh just the chaos it is ensuing down below and Moses he tries to intercede for to God for the people and Moses says to the Lord oh this people have sinned a great sin they've made them gods of gold and yet Lord if you'll forgive their sin and if not block me I pray the out of thy book which thou West written this is Moses just entering into the spirit of Moses wants to give mercy so much he wants to offer himself up in place of the people but God says Moses whoever had sinned against me him will eye blood out of my book God's one who does the blooding out not Moses but God's grace God shows this is serious someone they're committing adultery uh spiritual fornication I will be the one who takes care of blotting them out of my book so again that connection idolatry and the Book of Life just can't um coexist and brother Branham comments on this when Israel rejected the leadership of God in the pillar of fire and turned to worship the golden calves their names were removed from The Book of Life and then he says now if such turning the idols in the Old Testament demanded the penalty of removal of names from The Book of Life then most assuredly it follows that Israel's rejection of Christ is the Messiah would demand a severe penalty and we'll find out that it does because we can see that idolatry in The Book of Life don't go together and rejecting Christ and the Book of Life don't go together because the Book of Life is Christ's book and the first example that we see of that is um is a is is Judas um and the disciples in Acts chapter 1 after uh after they go up to the up into the upper room they're waiting for the promise of uh of the father to come upon them and as they're as they're waiting with teaching about this my Bible class today they've had a lot to process in the previous weeks their world has been turned upside down and then back right side up again as they see as Christ appears to them and then they're just waiting and praying for the for the Holy Spirit to come upon them they don't know exactly what to expect but they're told you can be expecting something you shall receive power just go and wait and as they're waiting um they just have to let God interpret his word by bringing it to pass they don't know what to expect they're just they're waiting and they've been praying and they're waiting and praying and as they're waiting the Lord starts quickening scriptures to them to explain why did you just do what he did why did this happen why did that happen pieces start to come together and they say Judas was somebody they all trusted there's not many people I'd be giving all of my bank account to but that's what they did they gave Judas all of that and let him take care of it and um now that trust was broken and Peter stands up as they're waiting and he he says this it's written in the Book of Psalms let this habitation be desolate and let no man dwell there and his Bishop another take and Peter's saying this is talking about Judas and when you look at a scripture like they think it's in Psalm 69 it's amazing how prophecy can work because if you look at the context of Psalm 69 I mean there's a it's definitely a Messianic Psalm there's a few things that Jesus Christ quotes them about um I I first they give them vinegar to drink that that verse is in Psalm 69 but you wouldn't see anything to think of this would be talking about Judas but the Holy Spirit connects it yes that's talking about him so when the Holy Spirit wants to make a connection he makes the connection we can only we can study as hard as we want we can try to make them but we can't do it we can force connections but the holy spirit makes real connections and I think it's interesting they've been praying things are starting to come together and they're understanding and Peter sees this look it let this habitation be desolate let no man take it let no man dwell during his bishopric let another take and now the disciples think ah there's no more 12th disciple there's just 11 his his habitations desolate says let someone else take his place and they think we have to pick somebody and here they think fulfillment of Prophecy is never our problem God's going to take care of it they see something here but it's not our problem just like waiting on the waiting on the promise to come they didn't know what was going to happen the winner is going to happen they just do God said it was going to happen the how and that's not our problem we're just going to wait like he told us he's going to fulfill it well they end up casting lots in the lot falls on falls on Matthias and they make Matthias the 12th Apostle but you never hear anything more about him they did it with the best of intentions they'd been praying they'd been seeing Pieces come together and then they decided to interpret God's word themselves that they had they had they had half of it right but then they wanted to fill the second half themselves let Gods fulfill his word by bringing it to pass and God did that by picking somebody that nobody would have picked The Saul was on nobody's top 10 list to be the vice presidential candidate he would nobody was going to pick him but look at Saul says man if there was hope for Saul what great there could be hope for anybody you could say God shows that nothing's impossible with him but you see in verse 25 they make Matthias and then that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which Judas by transgressions fell that he might go to his own place he's not his and his name is in blotted from The Book of Life brother bam says there are people who seem 100 involved in things of God or almost 100 they're like Judas the disciples didn't expect that at all when Jesus says at the Last Supper one of you here who takes us up with me will will betray me and they all looked at each other wondering if it were themselves they were doubting themselves they didn't suspect Judas no one but Jesus knew exactly what kind of a person Judas was so the day came that Judas did exactly what Israel did at belper he decided he wanted to join with the false find forces he had to do the financial political organization of anti-word antichrist religion and he did so so when Judas left and betrayed the Lord his name was removed from The Book of Life because rejecting Christ and the Book of Life don't go together because when it's like when you reject Christ you're rejecting the story he has you want to write your own story you want to write your own book for your life and where we we are free moral agents we're Made In His Image we have free moral agency we he lets us make that choice and he's just enough to let us live with that choice look in psalm 69. and we'll we'll kind of zoom in on it because it's not just Judas who is referred to here in Psalm 69 like I said David makes multiple statements that that Jesus either later quotes or that the the gospel writers quote to Psalm 69 and verse 9 for example David says for the Zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and John quotes this scripture after Jesus goes in and cleanses the Temple of those who are buying and selling and then in verse 21 they gave me also Gall for my meat in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink and then verse 22 I think is is uh is significant it says let their table become a snare before them and that what should have been through their welfare let it become a trap and when I read this I imagine in every place where there would be a synagogue there's a table where the Torah is spread before it the Torah was for their welfare it was given to them for to uh to grow by to be a benefit to them however as they take their interpretation of that that which had been given to them for a good thing actually becomes a snare to them because they say Jesus Christ Jesus of Nazareth there's no way that he can be the Christ and they'll give you a dozen places in the scripture this that show that that that's impossible let there and so their their table with God's word upon it because they've been misapplying it all these different places it becomes a snare to them they are ensnared by their interpretations by their uh by their perceptions of how the prophecies have to be fulfilled instead of this becoming a light to them it becomes a snare to them so if Judas is had this name blotted from The Book of Life because he's turned his back on Christ think about the things that Jesus says about the religious leaders he says you Whited walls you um you uh you you Snakes in the Grass um but you you Generation of Vipers these are pretty strong words and it's saying the table with with God's word on it it has become a snare to you it's become a trap then you go on in verse 28 further down actually we'll just go to 26th they persecute them whom whom you have smitten they talk to the grief of Those whom you have wounded add iniquity to their iniquity let them not come unto your righteousness verse 28 let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous because rejection of Christ and the Book of Life don't go together and Christ said some pretty strong words about the religious leaders like we just quoted and this scripture seems to be a pretty blanket condemnation of the Orthodox Jewish leaders who were party to Jesus's death and we can see here God's justice but like I said Justice and mercy are not an either or proposition God is both just and merciful because if we were to focus just on these couple verses just on statements that Jesus made why did walls sepulchers Generation of Vipers you wouldn't expect a single of the Jewish religious leaders and single Jewish priests to become a follower of Jesus not not in your wildest dreams however in the book of Acts the word of God increases after the day of Pentecost and it says a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith who would have ex focus on these scriptures from Psalm 69 that they're all these Christ rejecters let their name be brought out of the book of the Living God is just but there's Mercy there too because God can see there's more in that cyst of the meech's eye it looks like a completely dastardly black system Christ Killers everything like that but God sees not everybody that was in there knew what was going on there was a party to it and he's it was hard for the I bet it was hard for those disciples and those early Christians to accept even Saul think about Saul had Saul ever heard the gospel I bet Saul was there in the hall when when the when Stephen goes to preaching he heard that I bet he heard that he he hears Stephen saying I see I see Christ and they're they're at God's right hand Saul sees that and I bet that there were some people who were who were Believers in Christ and you could take the quote to say if you've rejected the message that you've heard the message you've rejected that there's no more grace for you and they would have crossed saw out of their book thinking we're just but God's justice and mercy they go together because Saul was in the book he would he was a party to to Stevens to Stephen's death but he did it without realizing any of it and his name wasn't plotted out God can go into the worst system he says there are still some of mine that are there we're gonna go pluck them out and he has something much more and much more greatly in mind than we ever have and to me this is just a testimony of the truth where the Branham says it's always in an individual only an individual never a group you can't save by a group Association you can't condemn by group Association because there's a God looks at the individuals in both circumstances it's an individual not in the group his identification is with an individual you get that now with the Methodist with the Baptist with the Presbyterian the Lutheran the Pentecostals the message it's as an individual it's not as a group of personal Vindication of a pregnant child of God filled with the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God he doesn't care about anything else and the Holy Spirit is living its life we don't live the holy spirit's life we don't live Christian Life on her own we just get frustrated doing that but Christ comes in to live his own life through US pulsating through US showing the personal Vindication of the word itself expressing itself to the people and to the world so if you take a few of these quotes you say man there's no way to any of these priests could ever commend to the kingdom of God but God is just and merciful they are not mutually exclusive I just think that's a special thing so that's just a challenge for all of us even as Believers in an end-time message we rejoice when any individual leaves the group walk and introduce into a personal individual walk because that's what it's always about we're not condemned by association you're saved by association it's an individual affair so rejecting Christ and the Book of Life don't go together and this principle continues on further into the book of Acts so here you have Paul and Barnabas there the the pattern they have when they first start their Ministry is they go into synagogue after synagogue and trying to to make the first connection with with with with with the Jews and the Jews don't appreciate it by and large and um when the Jews saw these multitudes who were actually listening to Paul and Barnes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and blaspheming and then the spirit must have descended upon Paul and Barnabas they waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should have first been spoken of you because you were the people of God it was necessary for me first to come to you but seeing that you put it from you God is offering to it to you again and again and again but you are pushing it from yourselves you are judging yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life so we're turning to the Gentiles again rejecting Christ in The Book of Life don't go together it's impossible and then on the notes on page four Paul talks about how Demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world it's in second Timothy 4 verse 10. and brother Branham tells a story how uh um he's talking with Dr Baxter and Dr Baxter there there's talking about Demons Imagine why would the why would Demus leave Paul and Dr Baxter says you know when I get up to heaven the first thing I'm going to do I'm going to walk right up to Demas and slap him in the face as hard as I can and brother Branham says well you really think he'll be there Ern be careful of your desire to slap in the face because I wouldn't want to be where he was at because when Demas walks away from Paul he's loving this present world that's he's putting something else before God an idolatry in The Book of Life don't go together rejecting Christ in The Book of Life don't go together rejecting the gospel and the Book of Life don't go together you can't have them both so as we kind of summarize this section brother Graham looks at Psalm 69 and he says it's the wicked or unrighteous rejecters of Christ and the Destroyers of his people who are removed we're going to bring this up um the best we can into our time because idolatry isn't just something of the Old Testament rejecting Christ isn't just something of 2000 years ago the Book of Revelation talks about at the end time there's going to be an antichrist Spirit rise up a beast rise up and even an image to the Beast and people will be worshiping the Beast image and that's also a form of idolatry and worshiping the Beast image and the Book of Life they don't go together so I want to take a look at um what is the the Beast and the and and also into the Beast image and brother Brandon will look at a couple things people are going to be worshiping the Beast thinking they've been so deceived in their thinking thinking they're actually worshiping God though whose names did not remain in the Book of Life those of the world system churches who fought the bride will be those whose names are removed so the Beast and the Book of Life don't go together Revelation 13 prophesies all that dwell upon the Earth are going to worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slanting the foundation of the world but everybody in the world will be worshiping this Beast except those whose names written in the book of life because the Beast and the Book of Life don't go together and there's also an image of the Beast we'll read about that shortly in Revelation 13. and again this image to the Beast is it's just another form but it's the same Spirit anointing it and if you worship the image of the Beast you say I'm not worshiping the beast but if you're worshiping the image of the Beast it's the same thing it might look a little better look a little more innocent it's the same thing because you're worshiping The Same Spirit that's behind them both and this is a this is a quote the first time I I read it it just kind of blows us away that's how it worked on how the impact they had on me as Israel the chosen people of God in majority they forfeited their rights to the Book of Life by rejecting Jesus then he says so the majority of the Gentile church will also come into condemnation with the result and removal of their name for the Book of Life by rejecting the word and entering into the world ecumenical movement which is the image erected unto the Beast and I I saw this this is a huge statement the majority of the Gentile Church would come in the condemnation it was it's hard to get it's hard to wrap the mind around and the one quotation that helps me with this I've shared this with you before William Booth beginning of the 20th century he says the chief danger that confronts the coming century is a Christianity as religion without the Holy Ghost you know what if you have if you have a religion but you don't have the Holy Ghost you can have the best name on your church but your name can't be in the Book of Life I mean you can have Christian you can you can take the name of Christianity and have a cap and have have that and have have a cross and have a nice inspirational message but if Christ isn't at the heart of that message you might leave feeling good about yourself but Christ isn't here to make us feel good about ourselves sometimes he's here to make us feel bad about ourselves so we see how much we need him but that's not that's not popular that's the chief danger that will have Christianity without Christ we want forgiveness we all want to be forgiven but how many people want to say I'm sorry this is the religion of the world today salvation without regeneration we all want to say we're saved I saw a clip recently about the uh this Omega Church in California who wants to be Seeker friendly and they and and the pastor and his wife come out at the worship service service dressed as Toy Story figures and they're just making jokes at the beginning and and they have banter back and forth and they're making and trying to have laugh and and and and the backdrop of all the Toy Story and think this is this is a huge mega church and they can have the best name at the front but you're you're you're you're trivializing the gospel how could how could you even call this the gospel you're not saving anybody you're making people feel better about the position that they're in without actually giving them anything to to correct it and that's how salvation quote unquote without regeneration that's not salvation that's just giving you morphine to make you feel better and die that's all that is politics without God heaven without hell and this William Booth was completely accurate he saw it and that's what you see all throughout the Church world today so you can see brother Brandon made a comment in 1960 whatever the year was that would have caused people's mind to spin how can he say the majority of the Gentile church will have their names removed from The Book of Life what who are you to say that but when you see the situation that the church is in you can hardly hardly called call it a church and it's not being arrogant but it's just like Lord help us because you see this and you and you see Lord this is terrible people are coming to a church like that with needs for some kind of hope and they're settling for Toy Story I mean that how how cheap it is and they try to make connections between chory's story and the gospel you can probably make some really stretched connections but so can my junior high students make stretch connections and essays it doesn't work this is a it's a sad situation if we can we can diagnose it but I I don't intend to say anything in arrogance about it but uh so the majority of the Gentile Church being condemned because it's a church that doesn't have Christ in it a church that hasn't been regenerated or actually saved and I I shared this before but in in 2010 an Evangelical Pastor David Platt publishes this book uh radical taking back your faith from the American dream and he says um he says he critiques the church recruitment like a corporation offering all kinds of benefits like social centers daycare Etc to increase their market share and he says Christians are just pursuing a spiritualized version of worldly goals and his solution is to surrender our material dreams and spend less give more do Mission projects in a third world country which are all great goals but that doesn't necessarily get to the heart of the issue which is a a change in the heart and he says we're starting to redefine Christianity we're giving into the dangerous temptation to take the Jesus of the Bible and twist him into a version of Jesus that we're more comfortable with a nice middle class American Jesus a Jesus who doesn't mind materialism and who would never call us to give away everything we have a Jesus who doesn't expect us to forsake our closest relationships so that he receives all our affection to Jesus who is fine with nominal devotion that does not infringe in our comfort because after all he loves us just the way we are but he loves us enough but let us stay the way we are a Jesus who wants us to be balanced avoid dangerous extremes and avoid danger altogether a Jesus who brings us comfort and prosperity as we leave out our live out our Christian spin on the American dream but do you and I realize what we're doing at this point we're molding Jesus into our own image and when I read this I think back to Exodus 20 and the Ten Commandments Thou shalt not make unto thee any grave and image and we're not putting any image of bronze here but we're making an image in our minds of who we want Jesus to be and that's the Jesus we're going to serve and that's a Jesus of our imagination when we're doing that we are constructing an idol and we saw from the very beginning idolatry and the Book of Life they don't go together we're rejecting to Jesus of the Bible and making another G another image and putting Jesus's name on it but it's not the same he's beginning to look a lot like us because the bat is who we're most comfortable with and he says the danger now is that when We Gather in our church building to sing and lift our hands in worship we may not actually be worshiping the Jesus of the Bible instead we may be worshiping ourselves he says a lot of really strong good things here one thing I might want to add we really don't have a choice of worshiping ourselves it's either God or Satan we can't really worship ourselves so when we think we're worshiping when he said we're worshiping ourselves no we're not if we're not worshiping God we're worshiping the devil and we're thinking we're and we're trying to deceive ourselves and thinking this is this is right and if you have a whole group of people who are in churches with Christ's name on them but they're living a completely different gospel living a completely according to a different world and they might be singing some of the same songs raising their hands but if they're not worshiping the same Christ they're worshiping an idol idolatry and the Book of Life don't go together and that's that that's just the that's just the the truth of the situation because revelation 22 19 says if any man take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God will take away his part out of the book of life because as we mess with the book we're changing who we're talking about it's complete becomes a completely different Christ and the penalty of this as we as we take make take reject Christ and take a different image even if it looks a lot like Christ it's still a different image and that is still idolatry and idolatry and the Book of Life don't go together now David Platt uh I think he's a Baptist pastor he says some good strong things here brother Brandon said pretty much the same thing in 1965 says the God of this world today the worshiped person of this world today is Satan and people are ignorant of worshiping because it's a say of worship being Satan because it's Satan impersonating himself as the church they worship Satan thinking that they're worshiping God to the church but it's the way that Satan has done it he's saying the same thing 40 50 years before David Platt writes the book and it would have been a lot harder for brother Branham to have seen it that he there's not very many people in 1965 who are saying that but he saw the Spirit and there and and he diagnosed it right on he's not saying you're worshiping yourselves you're worshiping Satan now when in the in the Book of Revelation actually I want to go back on further here we go and how can Satan be receiving Worship in in the church because second Thessalonians 3 4 says that he asked God sits in the temple of God showing himself that he is God he's the man of sin the Son of Perdition he's opposing and exalting himself of all that's called God or that's worshiped and he is sitting the temple of God so that he can receive that worship as the Antichrist and here you see the Antichrist being described in Revelation chapter 13 we went I think through this a little bit we've talked about that woman Jezebel this is there's this Beast coming out of the water with the mouth of a lion the feet of a bear um beast like a leopard and this woman Jezebel sitting astride the Beast and and that this is this anointing and and everybody's wondering at the Beast even even John is amazed of the Beast and the dragon is giving the Beast his power and it says all the people are worshiping the Dragon they they might be worshiping the beast but it's the dragon anointing him and the dragon is the one receiving that worship perhaps we can turn over in our Bibles to Revelation chapter 13. so we can see this describes some bet a little better at the beginning of Revelation 13 we see this this Beast come up out of the water that's the Antichrist system that's uh Rome um and it looks bad ferocious terrible all those uh all those bad things it looks really really bad but in verse 11 John says I beheld another Beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb yet he's fake as a dragon and it says he exercises all the power of the first Beast before him and it causes the Earth and then what's through all the rain to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed and brother Branham talks about uh the the the the the second this this the innocent looking Beast rising up out of the Earth the first Beast comes up out of the Sea and the Sea of multitudes of people the Earth looking more like an unpopulated area and these talks this is about uh this is speaking of the of the United States and this Beast it looks like a lamb John doesn't know exactly what it is but he says it was a it was a baby buffalo and John had never seen if you pull up pictures of a baby buffalo yeah you could it could be mistaken for a lamb if you'd never seen one before it looks innocent and yet this this Beast that rises up out of the Earth it has for a while it seems like its own identity but what it does it causes everybody in the earth to point their worship back to the first Beast it causes everyone who dwells on the earth to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed and that's a reference to to Rome he does great wonders he makes Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men so this this this innocent looking Beast can do great signs and wonders it deceives verse 14 them that dwell on the Earth by means of the Miracles that he had to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword and did live and there so here's this this first Beast that looks terrible ferocious you don't want to mess with this Beast but the second but the the second beast that comes up looks a lot better let's just all love one another yes this is this is who could be who could be against this but it's anointed by the very same dragon one of them is in your face powerful ruling by fear the other one putting at ease call me yeah he listened let's just love one another what's that loving one another means that we have to change the god that we're serving will really have our hearts in the wrong place because God is the one that we owe our love to first and foremost he's like a lamb like this sweet little teddy bear I thought the teddy Bear got the a got the idea across he's like a lamb but he speaks as a dragon it has the same anointing it might not roar like a dragon to breathe fire like a dragon but the message the same is going to get you to the same place and here I send a link um to um uh to the folks upstairs and I mean our our audio video crew um but I just want to introduce it for a minute um the in 2014 um a man named Tony Palmer visited Kenneth Copeland's Word of Faith Ministries and he came with a with a special message and Kenneth Copeland knows what the message is he introduces Tony Palmer and you're going to listen to Tony Palmer and he's going to say some things that sound really really good it's like who could who could be against this but he says this mess that we're going to hear this evening we have a special messenger this evening and I'm going to come introduce this messenger and he's speaking as an acumenicist wanting to bring everybody together and it sounds like the teddy bear so let's listen to a few minutes of it [Music] this is the first pope in history that took the francis's name because he's openly charismatic and this is history that we've got a pope who recognizes us as brothers and sisters speaks to us as brothers and sisters and has sent a message to us and you'll see what the message is about and I need you to at least understand a little bit of the the history behind this because we are living in an incredibly important generation amen I believe that God has brought me here to this year's ministers conference in the spirit of Elijah let me explain if you look carefully the spirit of Elijah was on John the Baptist to turn the hearts of the sons to the fathers and to turn the hearts of the fathers to the sons to prepare the way for the Lord and we know that prophecy always has a double fulfillment and we know that Elijah will come before the second coming as well and I've understood that the spirit of Elijah is the spirit of reconciliation to return Hearts to each other this is very important we know that the first thousand years there was one church it was called the Catholic church and the word Catholic means Universal it doesn't mean Roman Catholic means you if you're born again raise your hand if you're born again you're a Catholic take back redeem what belongs to you we are Catholics and then there was the split at the end of the first Millennium we had the Orthodox east and west two churches then 500 years later we have Luther and his protest three churches in 1500 years three denominations not three churches and then from Luther's protest onwards 33 000 new denominations I've come to understand that diversity is divine it's division that's diabolic it's true what you were saying about the glory I agree with you of course it's true the glory that the father had he gave to Jesus the glory was the presence of God what is the charismatic renewal it's when we experience the presence of God and he said and I give them the glory pragmatic reason so that they may be one it's the glory that glues us together not the doctrines sorry if you accept that Christ is living in me and the presence of God is in me and the presence of God is in you that's all we need because God will sort out all our doctrines when we get upstairs therefore Christian Unity it there's a lot that can be said there but what you see there he's anointed he's got it anointing on him and and I think he feels that you can see he makes his pauses looks there and there's and the reception's amazing what you have there that's a big teddy bear he's saying all kinds of really nice things he's he's a lamb who would want to oppose a man we have 33 000 dominations that's a good thing nobody's going to say that but man all this division is bad he's saying a lot of good things he's even recognizing some good things he's talking about there's going to be a prophet uh Elijah's going to come with the last days and he's going to say in just a minute I'm coming like Elijah to introduce this important messenger who is this guy it's just so many things that that is mixing truth and error so subtly so subtle he's like a lion sorry like a lamb this is so subtle so suddenly he says you know what God gave us the glory it's the glory that unites us and that and it's not the doctrine what are you saying is it's not the word that unites us it's the it's the glory no it's not it's the word that United it's the exactly the wrong thing that he's saying but it sounds so good it's not the glory that unites us it's God's word that unites us that's the important thing is God's all he has it all backwards and you know that I hadn't seen it quite like this until even as we were reading Revelation 13 a few minutes ago but um the the Pope says that the Catholic and charismatic renewal it's the hope of the church the Catholic Church loved charismatics it's the hope of the church because they've got the signs the Wonders let's make the spirit moving among them it looks like a great thing and you see in Revelation 13 the image of the Beast this ecumenical movement the image of the Beast does great wonders he makes signs come down from everything wow it looks like we've got the glory here this is it the image to the Beast everybody's attracting it coming right to it because it looks like we it looks like we've got the glory there but if you've got Glory without word you got to wonder where the glory is coming from it's not the same thing it'd be false fire verse 14. he deceives in the dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast and the charismatic renewal is doing these kinds of miracles in the side of the Beast everybody's like wondering wow this is it let's bring everybody right back like this pied pipe I think wow this we're going right back because we're all Catholics anyway it sounds so good and Pope Francis he says let's give each other a spiritual hug and let God complete the work that he has become I don't know that God started the work that he's talking about but the spiritual hug the is talking about ah that's the teddy bear this is this is the Lamb he's speaking like a lamb but watch the anointing behind him it's right there the anointing is right there Inspire inspiring inspiring and there are so many who you will think would know better uh as as Tony Palmer was uh speaking his wife is Italian and he tells the crowd a little bit later here that when my wife saw that she could be Catholic and charismatic and Evangelical and Pentecostal and who has absolutely accepted the Catholic Church Tim it's a big deal that the pope calls us Brothers he's not excommunicated in us anymore he's calling us brothers let's go back I don't care if the pope calls us Brothers I want God to call me his son that's the important identification it doesn't matter what what some religious Authority says when my wife saw that I could be all these things and absolutely accepted in the Catholic church she said that she would like to reconnect her roots with the Catholic culture that's not a Ministry of Malachi 4. it's not reconciliation of Father and Son it's being reckons under the same faith that they had it's gold going back to the word it's not just a human reconciliation putting differences under the rug and he says may the lutherans and the Catholics signed an agreement about justification as though we believe the same thing but the Reformation was about a lot more than that is about people Authority about what is it was church Council there's the authority it's the word of God they're not touching that it is a lot that you can say it and the crowd cheers you heard them clapping they should know better and Kenneth Copeland he says Heaven is thrilled over this he probably said it more slowly in his text and draw but that's what he said and you know what's so thrilling to me when we went into the ministry 47 years ago this was impossible I don't know that things have improved then but darkness is covering the Earth and woe to them who who love Darkness rather than light and say evil is good and the other way around this is this is a sad sad case and then they even went to the Vatican these uh these Pentecostal charismatic leaders and they're working together to deceive all that was on the earth saying to them to dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword and did live who's the sinner it's not Christ we're going back to Papa we're going back to to Father Rome and it talks about an image to the Beast worshiping an image to the Beast and you've got so much of the Evangelical of the Christian professing world doing that we have to remember idolatry and the Book of Life don't go together when you go after idolatry names are bothered from the book names are blotted out blotted out and that's the same thing that's promised here brother Branham says today the Pentecostals are throwing themselves together in The ecumenical council in the idea what it was like now doing the same thing grafting in tradition of man instead of taking the word of God which is Thoroughly identified by the Holy Ghost and we can say that even still today how tempting it can be to take tradition of men the thoughts that come up first on their Instagram feed the thoughts on my personal Facebook feed the thoughts that we've put in we ask Google how should I do this how should I raise my kids what what what should I watch what should I not watch we might be taking traditions of men instead of the word of God because woke things are going to sound good the woke the wokeness is going to speak like a lamb but it's anointed by that Dragon it'll lead you the same place take the word of God that which is Thoroughly identified by the Holy Ghost it's the same yesterday today and forever and he's saying the church today stands in the balance and it's found one and you're back in pilate's judgment Hall yes sir and what shall we do with Jesus called Christ what does this movement do this ecumenical movement it's making an image unto the Beast it's a satellite to Rome when The ecumenical council is forcing and will force every Protestant denomination into it and it's practically all there is now Full Gospel on all and the folks who identified this Full Gospel are the ones who were in Tony Palmer's audience clapping and thinking this is a wonderful thing but the hour is going to come we'll have to come or stay out and at that time when that Force come you've already identified yourself with the mark of the beast then you're worshiping that image to the Beast and image worshiping images idolatry in The Book of Life they don't go together it's like oil and water amen but the message to Sardis it brings up a uh a rather sobering theme in the the prosperity of name is being blotted from The Book of Life God's justice is a sobering thing but it ends with a promise and the promise is he that overcometh and how can we overcome by having an ear that hears what the spirit is continuing to speak to the church that's the only way to overcome and he did overcometh will be close in white raiment will be righteous his name will not be blotted out his name will be confessed before the father and before his angels Christ will stand and say I identify myself with him they identify with me on Earth I identify with them now we are one that's a wonderful wonderful promise so when we when we discuss the subject of the book of life it can feel rather heavy but you can all it explains what we see in the church world today it explains it and that does that that that does establish and subtle us The Book of Life does emphasize God's attribute of justice but that justice of God does not do away with the mercy of God and first off we can see um that I would think the one when the compass Revelation 3 17 anoint your eyes with isaf God is merciful the evenness deceit is going all over the place we can anoint our eyes with isaf so that we can see we can be thankful that we don't have to be deceived and we can go in and and and believe the truth we don't have to worship an image of the Beast we don't have to worship an image of Christ we can worship Christ himself but uh God's justice does not do away with God's mercy next time when we talk about the book of life I want to focus more we'll see how the mercy of God does endure forever as we'll see that multitudes who never came to the same Revelation as the bride might have come to God still has Mercy on many and many will enter into eternity with God there'll be 144 000 Jews who are who come unto eternity before God there will be a sleeping virgin who was dilatory who didn't who didn't have take oil with him yet God still has mercy upon them just like you would have said man who could come out of those uh of the Jewish religion and believe with those condemnations written over Ichabod and everything but there were still priests a great multitude of priests were joined to the church and there's going to be a great multitude of foolish virgins who might have been in the system but didn't realize what they had signed up for the last one said this is not what I want I'm willing to give my life for what's true and they'll do that the mercy of God endures forever he who receives the a righteous man the name of a righteous man receives a righteous man's reward God's mercy endures forever and we see God's mercy even in this theme of The Book of Life amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness to us O Lord father I thank you even as there's so much deceit so much uh it's so uh it's so Misty outside so so dark oh God but I'm thankful Lord that you you did send the prophet that you did bring us back you didn't just show signs and wonders and show Glory but you brought us back to the word you brought us back to yourself oh God and Lord I Thank you that neither salvation nor condemnation is a group Affair it's an individual of pharaoh God and Lord perhaps we can just think back to the time where you knocked personally on our hearts and what a wonderful thing it is that you dealt personally with us oh God Lord we just worship you and thank you for that oh God we just want to return that worship oh God thank you Father thank you Lord that our name is can be on that book of life oh Father Lord I pray that you would help us to anoint her eyes with eyes out that we may see O Lord father I pray you give us wisdom and discernment in this and this dark time oh God lord also give us love O Father that you might just reach through us and even touch lives that might still be in a system somewhere Lord I pray oh God that you would work through us oh God thank you for your mercy to us in Jesus name amen thank you
