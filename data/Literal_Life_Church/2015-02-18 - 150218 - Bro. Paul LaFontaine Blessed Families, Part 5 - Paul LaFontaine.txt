TRANSCRIPT
========================================
welcome movie tonight and uh Sunday service was uh Missing Sunday service was a certainly a regret we're just looking forward to coming there so we just you know 30 days and we'll be over this hump of the winter hopefully and be first day of spring I think 30 days or 29 days away so we're looking forward to that Deuteronomy chapter 6 we're going to read one through nine and everybody have it say Amen amen now these are the Commandments the statues and the judgments which the Lord your God commanded to teach you that ye might do them in the land whether you go to possess it that thou mightest fear the lord thy God to keep all of his statues and his Commandments which I command thee thou and thy son and thy son all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged I was thinking that doing the funeral of Mr Ford someone had said he lived until 99 somebody said he must have really treated his parents right to live that long for sure knowing that promise here therefore are Israel and observe to do it that it might be well with thee and that ye might increase mightily as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee in the lamb that floweth with milk and honey hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sit us in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou lie us down and when thou riseth up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and on thy Gates amen let's pray together Heavenly Father we ask you to come and bless the word tonight as we break bread together and just pray that that portion that you have for us today that we could grow we pray that you just distribute it to us Lord by Revelation Lord we need Revelation more than we ever needed it before and the Revelation only comes directly from you and so Lord I pray that you help us as we get in the word tonight and me being the vessel the one that you've chosen here for tonight to minister to the people I I feel very humbled Lord to be able to do that but Lord help me to get out of the way so that people see Christ and that Revelation would come even through my words Lord and that you could bring it from your throne to their hearts we just thank you for this opportunity to get together once again Lord some of the weather has kept us away from fellowship but we're thankful to be here tonight we pray those that are not able to be in the house of God tonight and she would encourage them and strengthen them Lord and we just Commit This service to you and all that will be said and we thank you for it in Jesus name amen why don't you seek somebody's hand before you take your seat tonight God bless you thank you I'm taking a little study on uh Wednesday nights here on blessed families or families that are blessed and really been enjoying it especially last Wednesday night if you get a chance to listen on YouTube there we had a wonderful time there and uh just taking the places in the scripture that point of a family being blessed and uh the next place uh with an emphasis on the families uh he's here in Deuteronomy chapter six and what makes a family truly blessed and I always want to take this section here I might mention this first though that in the Book of Numbers when there's a lot of numbering going on numbering of the people you'll find a statement over and over again you'll find families there and because when God numbered the people he numbered them according to families he didn't number them according to positions and all these other things and it just it just shows us something in the heart of God that his mind is on families and his heart is on families that's the focus of his church and the focus of what he's trying to so when you look at numbers you find it over and over again hundreds of times that he numbered them according to the families and then of course when we get into the uh as last Wednesday night we're talking about the token we realized that the token was applied applied not to the church but to the whole that's how much important the emphasis was to the home is that the token was actually applied so it's it's families that was prominent in God's mind and then when we get in the Book of Joshua which we should get there tonight hopefully when we talk about the inheritance of the people of God and them coming into their place God began to divide the land up to the tribes but also it broke down to not just tribes but it broke to families as well so you can see the theme throughout the Old Testament and coming into the New Testament even when God begins to set up the new church we're referred to as brothers and sisters can you say Amen well that's family right and and he's our father and we are Sons and Daughters all those terms are what God wanted us to use because it's a family it's the family of God and God as we took this series from the beginning from Genesis is that that marriage and that family and God having children that way and God creating them by a spoken word that's what God had in his mind is a a an image of what displayed his heart and that he could have fellowship and that he could have families and that all climaxes are or comes to its uh final expression in the last days can you say Amen the expression of what a marriage should be and what family should be comes to its full expression at the end time that's why in Ephesians uh when Paul mentions the husband and wife and her being submissive to him and him loving her as Christ did the church then he quickly goes to the bride and being Washed by the Water of the word and he refers to that as being uh the the the what God is doing and the choosing of a bride and so he types that of course and brings it back with the family and with the marriage uh that's on the earth because that all types that that's what God wants to express so when we get to the end if we're coming to the climax of God marrying his bride in this day spiritually then my it should have some influence on the understanding of what family is and what marriage is and I believe we do have an understanding we all don't live it probably like we should but uh at least God's trying to just Shepherd us along in what a true biblical marriage should be can you say amen and so we're just going to keep striving I told her brother today I said sometimes sometimes I'm preaching up here above my head even too but I see it in the word I just keep preaching it because I might not be fully there but I don't want to preach down here I want to preach up here so we have something to reach towards you know so we don't want to leave every service feeling guilty like we can never do it we can't do it except for the blood of Jesus Christ and his grace in our lives but we want to just keep putting that image of what we should be in in front of us you see and that's what preachers do a lot of times is that they're uh I remember even John Wesley you know he preached sanctification preached it and he realized after a while he didn't even have the experience that he was preaching about it wasn't until he come to America I think it was if I got my facts right that he had that real true experience of the holy spirit with him that something really dropped in his heart but he preached it a lot before he actually got it so uh that's what happens sometimes so praise the Lord that he always has us uh he has his image in front of us all the time can you say Amen so when we come into the promise that when they came in they divided according to tribes and then according to families and so we find that theme of families throughout and so uh I don't want to go into course all those things but I think it's something significant to to point out that when he divides things according to families and he keeps mentioning that then that's what God had in his heart how that's how important it was for families now when we come to Deuteronomy chapter six it is such an important uh scripture I don't know how much you've read it or how much you've applied it it's a it's a very important part of showing God's heart as the people now were given the law of Moses and given the things of Moses how important it was not only that that comes in our hearts because remember he said in verse 6 he says those words that I command you he says he says it shall be in thine heart and love the Lord with all thy heart soul mind and strength that's actually expressing what God's ultimate desire would be actually after Calvary and that these things would not just be a religion or something we smear on but he said he really he's already saying I want these things not on the outside I want them in your heart and they couldn't even experience that fully in their soul level until Calvary happened with their serpent nature there was no atonement for the serpent nature that wouldn't happen till Calvary but God's already shown his desires whatever I've given you in my word whatever ordinance whatever commandment it is I want you to live it from the heart and thank thanks be to God for the atonement that causes us to be able to live it from the soul level uh we're we're appreciative of that but this is such an important section as he uh in God's heart for blessing Families how many wants your family to be blessed I want my family to be blessed in spiritual things that we could be a normal healthy family following the Lord and Spirit-filled we're not a perfect family by any means and yours isn't either by the way uh but you know I want my family to be blessed by God that doesn't necessarily mean financially best but I want us to be blessed under God and under his headship so I'm I if nobody's getting anything out of this I'm really enjoying it because I got a family and I want us to be blessed amen I want us to be blessed of God I want his approval on our lives and what we're doing and so when we come to the blessing of families then we this is a bit of a training for parents here as he makes it a priority of teaching our children and that's what I brought it out he makes it a priority of parents of taking these things and beginning to teach them to our children and I want to take it further that not just teach them but actually it's so saturated saturates our life that it becomes the main theme of our life you know Bob said Christ the mystery says Christ is the principle theme of the Bible uh every scripture that we read should Express Christ in some way and so if he's the principal theme of The Bible he says he should be the Principal theme of Our Lives he should be the Principal theme of our homes and that's what really the scripture is saying is that you become so saturated with it and it you put it around them and you put it in front of them and you speak of it when you get up and when you go to bed and I don't see that as being somebody that's just quoting scripture all the time I see it as somebody who is is sharing with his children uh the things that God is showing them in relation to this world and how God thinks about in relation to the battles of this world what you're going through and if if you're sharing that with your kids God show me this and this is what God Said to do about it and you're sharing that that that's really what it's talking about is that the Forefront is that we know we live in this world but what what did God's word say how we must live and I think that's something we should continually put before our kids even if we don't know everything yet which all of us don't we should continually be talking about those things we have to talk about a lot of other things don't we but this scripture is a real uh instruction for parents that we really need to make that a priority and speak of what God is showing us and put that before them all the time and maybe later we'll have time to show the reason why ultimately God knows how we're made as a human being and he knows that we're bent towards idolatry right right and because of that that's why I believe he's warning them as they go into the Promised side he's giving a lot of warnings and they're going to be uh attracted to idols and attracted to other countries and things like that the only way a person could be attracted to all that and let their heart fall to another Idol is they got away from the word right they got too far away from the true thing and so all of a sudden they become vulnerable to become an idolater to serve another God because they got too far away from this one and the way he's showing us to stay close to our God is to stay close to the word amen stay integrated with the word let your lives be integrated with the word you get too far away from it and I'm sure everybody can raise hand and say that as a Christian you've been serving the lord you've already been through that you know what it feels like to get distant from God how many can say I've been there done that got the T-shirt you know I know what that feels like to get too far away from the word as to get to away from too far away from the presence of God and you become all sudden susceptible of things you were susceptible before to see thoughts of Doubt into things and the Fashions of the world and the things that you weren't even thinking about that before now you're thinking about it and it's because you're getting this so now him knowing they're gonna first of all they're built as a human human being to be drawn to Idols their heart is can be wavering that way because that's the way they're made knowing they'll be coming into that his answer was that before you go in listen I want you to saturate your life with the word I want you parents to talk about it all the time talk about it when you get up talk about it when you go to bed and and I want you to put it on the door I want to put it on the outside of the house put it up in sayings and and do everything you can get your children around all the the influences of the word get them to good camps and experience with God and just everything should be everything in life finances and careers and everything is there's a hub and the Hub the main thing is Christ the work can you say amen and everything else revolves around that send that message to your kids and your family will be blessed when they grow up they say our family the whole the main thing was to get around the presence of God to get around where the word is at to learn the word of God let your kids get that image in their in their head can you say man not that it was always always about Vacations or always about this or the money you made or all that but but they could say that we had a lot of good things in life but Mom and Dad was always pointing us to the word praise the Lord so in Deuteronomy 6 here we we have something but before we look at chapter six I think for a foundation I'm just going to step back and hopefully quickly look at the chapter before because we see the chapter before a pattern is established of how God teaches his people we've heard how the children are taught and that's by the parents but here we have before Deuteronomy chapter 5 he goes through all the Ten Commandments there ending up about 18 19 verse 20 21 uh neither shall thy desire thy neighbor's wife go through all the Ten Commandments and then when we get to verse 22 it says and on chapter 5 in verse 22 follow along with me these words the Lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick Darkness with a great voice and he added no more and he wrote them in two tables of stone and delivered them unto me so he's given the incident where God brought his word through Moses the prophet and he brought these Ten Commandments and it was in the mount and it was in the midst of fire and it had a cloud so we have we have a fi we have the the pillar of fire we have the cloud we have him in the mount and that's all very significant to the first Exodus it's significant to the second Exodus and it's significant to the Third Exodus all right because if you know your Bible there's three exoduses and and so now those May and those three exoduses are major major uh manifestations of God for God to come down to his people and lead him into that Exodus and so he sent the prophet Moses so you got a pillar fire you got a cloud you got him on the mount you have a thick Darkness with a great voice so now we have a voice and he added no more and he wrote them in two tables of stone verse 23. and it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness for the mountain did burn with fire that ye came near unto me even all the heads of your tribes and your elders and you said behold the Lord Our God hath showed us his glory and his greatness and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire we have seen this day that God doth talk with man and he liveth that is wonderful we have seen the glory of God come down and uh we've seen his greatness we've seen the voice one place it talks about that they didn't see God but they heard his voice and they said it thundered so not everybody there heard what God was saying Moses heard what God was saying and he said it to the people but yet they knew there was a voice thundering and they said it thundered so that's what was coming from the mountains so so we have now we have another and I can't reference that scripture but it talked about it thundered from the mountain the voice it thundered and so now we have another word that ties to Revelations 10 the prophecy of the last day so now the and then we have a voice out of the midst of the fire but this is a great part we have seen this day they said that God they've discovered God does talk with man and he liveth it was such a significant thing that they could conclude praise the Lord God talks with man amen God liveth God's come down and manifested himself God's going to tell us how to live God's going to give us his principles to live by God's talking with man again it's just wonderful now therefore why should we die for this great fire will consume us if we hear the voice of Our Lord Our God anymore then we should die that's how they felt and that's instant that if that if we if we hear this voice we'll in this great fire will consume us as Hebrews 12 says our God is a consuming fire verse 26 for who is there of All Flesh that had heard hath heard the voice of the Living God speak it out of the midst of the fire as we haven't lived go thou near and hear all that the Lord Our God shall say and speak thou unto us all the Lord Our God shall speak unto thee and we will hear it and do it now they're speaking to Moses there You Go Near You Hear What the Lord Has said you speak it to us and we'll do it right they didn't they made a choice there they didn't want to hear in this way with God they said I I don't want to do that right we want you to do it Moses and you come and tell us what he said and then we'll do it and the Lord heard the voice of your words when he spake unto me and the Lord said unto me I have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken unto thee they have well said all that they have spoken all that there were such a heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my Commandments always that it might be well with them and with their children forever there's a blessing to the family right there would it come back to a heart such a heart for for a heart in them that they would fear Him and keep his Commandments go say to them get you in your tents again so he said Moses go tell the people go you go get in your tents again but as for thee Moses stand thou here by me and I will speak unto thee all the Commandments and the statues and the judgments which Thou shalt teach them that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it you saw observe to do therefore as the Lord your God hath commanded you you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left ye shall walk in all the ways which the Lord your God hath commanded you that you may live and that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess so God says their request is a good one come here and Stand By Me the people go to their tents you come and stand by me and now I'm going to speak to you and you teach the children of Israel you teach them my statues you teach them my Commandments you teach them my judgments I want you to teach them and I I I that's thought they'd asked for and that's the that's the way it's set up this is the pattern that was established for God to speak to his people this is the biblical pattern for God to teach his people um they did not see God but they heard his voice it said it thundered and they discovered that God talks with man we've already covered that and they preferred Moses to speak they chose that and so this this pattern did this pattern I want to ask a question did this pattern stop after Calvary if it if it did I don't I don't know how it did because the pattern is still there this pattern just didn't stop after the atonement was made after Calvary and after Jesus of Nazareth it clearly did not stop this pattern of God using a prophet to be able to speak then bringing it down taking it teaching it to their children clearly it didn't because Paul was spoken to by Jesus himself in a light who was the light that spoke to Paul Jesus so now after 33 and a half years and after three and a half years Ministry Jesus himself who came there in the in the position in the place to go to Calvary and be our lamb and and and pay the price for our sins still even after that he is appearing to Paul later on can you say amen and he's given Paul he's commission you're going to go to this man and he's going to give you your commission and so it's Jesus himself who speaks to Paul but not in his flesh in a pillar of light in a light am I all biblical so far Jesus sent him to get his commission and then Paul later said and there's a lot of things we can read to Paul now but first Corinthians 14 37 38 said If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant so now Moses had Commandments and now you have the same pattern Jesus speaks to Paul and Paul is saying that the things that I run into you and that God has given me to give to you are the Commandments of the Lord now that wasn't the Ten Commandments so what was it Jesus had come and paid for the atonement now he's filling the people with his Spirit the Holy Ghost now their hearts can be changed so that they can live this word from a soul level understand but not without the pattern of God speaking and using a prophet in order that he might set the order and bring the other things that's needed for that age oh Paul did so many things he brought so much especially in the book of Hebrews he's bringing all the types and shadows of all of that in the Old Testament is bringing it forward to the better Covenant and all these other things he was used in so many ways but the pattern of how God speaks bringing the Commandments did not change because that's who that's why he used Paul to do that because that was the pattern so the thing that the thing that uh uh did not change after Calvary is the the only thing that changed was the true atonement we didn't have the blood of bulls and goats anymore we have the true thing that could go to the soul level and kill a serpent nature that we could finally live everybody's still with me I don't want to lose anybody here this this is uh pretty simple things in the scripture we had a true Calvary atonement finally and everything with that atonement Rises to a higher level of Grace right you talk about Grace God's grace is going to come in and kill that serpent nature so you can finally live it from the soul so everything it it doesn't do away with the principles and the thoughts of God what it does is raises it to a higher level that's why Jesus said I come not to destroy the law but I came to fulfill the law I came to give you something that's actually going to live it can you say Amen so now we see that it raises the high it raises the power and the cleansing uh the cleansing of the blood it's not just to be a bloodable goats that just covers sin it's got to actually get away get completely rid of sin that's how powerful it is but the pattern of how God speaks bringing the Commandments does not change another thing I I would say that would be different Hebrews 12 speaks of Paul said we are not at that mount we have not been called to that mount That Shook how many remember that in Hebrews 12. we're not called to that mountain That Shook and if you read that scripture he says but we're called to Mount Zion the city of God the holy company of angels so we're called to a different Mount but yet you'll find in Hebrews 12 you'll still find a voice speaking like Mount Sinai you'll still find a voice shaking everything but he says it won't shake the Earth this time but it'll shake the heavens so it's a greater shaking by The Voice and so you know have a voice you still have a voice he ends the chapter by saying and our God is a consuming fire you still have God as a consuming fire still the same it hasn't changed and you and you still need reverence and godly fear because then he says let us serve god with Godly reverence and fear the same thing that was said through Moses let's serve him with Godly reverence and fear for let's have a fear for this voice let's have a reverence for this voice but it's greater because the result of the blood True Blood the true atonement is a greater effect upon us as we were speaking last Wednesday night about the effects of the blood the path to the blood the light that leads us to the blood praise the Lord so so that being in mind now as we move on to chapter six we see is that as a foundation God spoke through Paul let's just read chapter six and verse one now these are the Commandments the statues and the judgments which the Lord your God commanded did you that's a lot of stuff so God just didn't bring the Commandments through Moses he brought statues am I saying that right statutes not statues statutes okay and uh and he brought judgments so those are all those are all different things right and all of that came through it came through Moses god came down to his people brought all of these Commandments and statutes and judgments through the prophet yeah yeah three different things and so now we have these three things coming Commandments of course is self-explanatory it's a command we think of the Ten Commandments we think of the other Commandments again that's Thou shalt Thou shalt not Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not kill it's a command don't do this but that's not only what God's sin is commands that's right he sent statutes and that means it has the meaning of of limit or boundary so now not only did God send commands God gave boundaries in the Old Testament and a lot of a lot of them were related to the time that they lived in there are some boundaries that they had back there some of them that we wouldn't necessarily emphasize or have today because they were specific to the order of the age under that profit right and so now their boundaries but do we need did we need other did Paul need some other boundaries for the time that he lived in yeah yeah yes he did yeah and because he was under God's Authority and chosen by God God gave him authority to set the order for the age and the boundaries for the age the same as Moses and if you know Paul's writings and you read through that you can see because if if that's not the case friends then Paul is saying a lot of things that Jesus didn't say right that's right in the four gospels didn't say I mean he's set in church order he's telling them how to do the gifts he's telling them all this other stuff by what Authority well he's under the authority of God and so now they're asking about should young people touch one another should they do all this other and so now his words become the word of God for that time especially because he has to set the the boundaries and some some statutes can you say man he's already said that the things I write in here the Commandments of the Lord but that's not all he's writing he's writing something specific to the age and uh so then we have statutes we have commands and I want to get to the third one which is judgments judgments is related to the word of a court the judge decides uh a case or the jury and the judge decide okay so you have many cases come in court so there has to be a judgment made is this person guilty or they are they innocent okay so that's that's judgments he gave back in Moses day those weren't Commandments those were judgments yeah matter of fact uh Moses uh father-in-law came to him one day and said this is too much on you because Moses you know here's two million people and he's dealing with each case it's the trouble of the people and they're coming for they're probably Counseling in that day but they had issues between them and Moses is handling all this and his father-in-law says this is too much on you yeah to judge all these situations that's really what he was doing maybe it wasn't related to The Commandments but he is he's bringing a judgment on something he's Discerning kind of like what Solomon did with the two women that said they had the same baby and so now here Moses is there and he's doing this the father-in-law says listen set up certain heads set up different ones and and distribute this and they'll handle the little matters there were little matters of judgment and we'll just bring the big matters to you and so they instigated that thing and so but those were many of those things would be judgments deciding a case and that word means proper or fitting in other words a proper judgment A fitting judgment a measurable judgment a a balance in judgment listen I'll tell you friends I want God's judgment more than anything else because his will be more balanced a lot of times your judgment is not balanced you must raise your hand and admit it my judgment is not balanced but God's judgment is always a balanced thing it's always balance and so if he's working through the prophet there he's bringing his judgments as well it's going to be a balanced judgment and that's one of the things that Moses brought as well it wasn't just Commandments it wasn't that it was statutes boundaries for things and also judgments for things deciding a case and every case that comes to court every case is different I can only think of today when I was studying this is that the many cases I have to handle in my home every day and I'll tell you friends it gets to be something you really have to pray because daddy is handling sometimes a mom has that when Daddy's Gone mom is handling cases and she's handling a situation between the two siblings and a judgment call has to be made so you hear all the facts you know bring them up to the witness stand set them on the couch okay you've had your time now you come and sit on this Castle let me question you where were you last night when this water got poured over your brother you know you you go through the and you bring in Witnesses you're bringing the other siblings for Witnesses you bring in mom you know and she's about as a witness and you're trying to settle all of this it's like somebody's got to make a judgment on this can't just let things hang and that's what I thought of in this is a judgment call in every case is different and we have to deal with it all the time and I'll tell your friends a man of God is trying to always pray what can you give me in the scripture Lord give me something in the scripture give me something from the Lord that I got that it can help because that's what you want to point to but I will tell you this there are sometimes you make a judgment call and you're just winging it because there may not be black and white scripture for it we're talking bubble gum or something you may not find a scripture for that stuck in hair so that's what judgment means and and that's that's the type of things Moses was dealing with that wasn't the Commandments that was just making a judgment call on something okay and thankfully the people are rejoicing because all those Commandments the statutes its judgments were coming down and working through this for the people to be able to know how to live can you say Amen get a few more of you say Amen all right thank you so all of that was in the message of Moses praise the Lord wasn't just Commandments all of that was in the message of Moses statutes judgments all of it was in there and all in all three exoduses the same pattern we see the same signs in the heaven the same things that we see taking place Moses under God's Authority given authority to make judgment calls for the Times Paul's given the same thing under the authority of God and that's why God's designated Authority is given to a man that's under Authority completely under Authority right Paul when you think of his authority that he was given he couldn't have it until he went on the backside of the desert he had an experience with God but now he went the backside and the way it's described is that he went there to to study and to get all of that earlier training taken out of him just like Moses had to do that he was trained in all of Egypt he was the best man to take the people out of Egypt but God didn't want to use any of that training so God takes another 40 years to knock it all out of him why so he can be under Authority properly so he can judge properly so Paul goes three and a half years or whatever he said it was and so he has to get all that Purge out of him and he said I count it all now as dung all my former learning all my study of the Hebrew scripture everything everything technical he said I count it all as done in order that I might come to Christ he had to be purged of all of it and Smith himself to the word for that day and what God was going to use it for he was a man under Authority and a man of authority God chose him he says now he can be in Authority so much so that he would be the prophet of that age right and because he was under Authority then so let's just type that now with uh let's bring it now to the pastor now let's skip the pastor let's talk about the head of the home never works for a man to exercise Authority who's not under Authority he's not under the authority of the word of God the children are going to notice it eventually they're going to notice it and they won't have the respect level because there's a man maybe even going to church but they can eventually sense he's not under the authority of the word he basically when something's preached he basically goes and does what he wants it's been shown in the word now I don't know about that and so they see enough of that his authority is not going to be established by God for the family to respect him it works the same way as a prophet same way as a pastor it works the same way because that's how God Authority works God's designated Authority God's delegated authority and a man has to be under Authority property for properly for that to be used right for for God I could go into a lot more examples of that as far as expressing how we've seen that through the years the respect level of the children and such has it only comes in a natural Godly way a Godly way if that man is truly shown himself as being under Authority once he steps out of that once he steps out of that place things begin to unravel and I personally believe that a man in this hour needs to be in the under the authority of the word for this age and submit himself to it because we all have our different ideas but I shared with the brothers a few weeks ago that there I would come times early in my experience that when I seen something I was starting to see something in the word or starting to see something I'm going to do things this way and I watch that word or the hour come and correct that or the scriptures come and correct that I said okay my great idea is set aside and I'm going to submit myself to what the authority of the word is amen that's good and I can I I can safely say not proud but God has blessed my life in a lot of ways because through the years I've had to do that as a minister because there's a lot of things that that that come up I remember running things across brother Lonnie when he was brother uh Michael's uh grandfather I'd call him his early Pastor I'd start to see something of the words wow this is looking really good man this is great this is this is something here and sometimes I would call and brother Lana he was he said no that's really interesting I'm going to take a look at that myself that's that's really neat he was he would study it and call me back you know and things like that but sometimes he knew right away he'd give me a few quotes and give me a few things give me a few scriptures and you just blow it out of the water it's like I was way off track and so I appreciated that back then I appreciate him bringing up the word and we have to that's so how do we submit as men we submit to the word of God you know we're not here to to come up and there's one thing about uh uh headship and that is that it's a lot funner to be under headship than to be the head it's a lot easier job brother Chad Lamb had a service on a few a couple years ago on the headship and uh brother Mike gave me a copy of it I'd like to have all the brothers have a copy it was tremendous but he gets in there talking about being the head of his company and all that back then and he's just describing all the pressures that go with being the owner of the company and sometimes employers will get disgruntled and they want to be the owner and they want to do this and they wanted that he said they don't know what they're talking about they don't know what you have to deal with it as the head and if they only knew all that goes with it they find it a much more secure and comfortable place underneath that how many can say that yeah and some of you uh teenage boys you want to be the daddy you're going to be the daddy someday listen being that and a wife a wife if she releases that headship to her husband and lets him she might give her input but input but the but the final decision being up to him man releasing him let it come on his head that that actually should be a release to you sisters and yet we got women in the world fight no no and you're fighting you get something that's go that's you shouldn't feel secure and safe under headship it's a better place to be safer place to be praise the Lord so in saying that Paul had the authority to do that and he talked about the shadows and types of the uh atonement the real atonement coming and a better Covenant all these other things but he also set the church in order for the age if you don't know that you don't know your Bible he set in the church in order for the age for that time and in giving so many things and so many principles back then and and and we we Revere that as the word of God today we look at that as the word of God today we take it even when he used a little slogan there you know where he said this is I's answering the question he said this is I not the Lord even that became the word of God that we hold to right amen so uh in giving those things then Paul one time I was going to give it an example to somebody the other day in Paul one time he he was talking about preachers being paid and what the giving was to preachers and then he reaches back in the Old Testament he says and you don't muzzle off the out the you don't muzzle the ox that Treads out the corn and he pulls something from way back there in the Old Testament and brings it forward to use as an example in this situation now I personally believe I've often looked at I said no why didn't he pull all the things because he's dealing with what he's dealing with in the age and he pulls a principle from there and he brings it forward for the age to use it right because he has the authority to do it and what he left out well we leave out that's what the people under Paul did what it wasn't as significant you don't dump it all out I don't dump any of the Bible Out friends Old Testament or new it's all the word of God but God sends this gift now and he's he's here he is he's bringing something forward that's significant for the day and that we need for the day I want to say our prophet in this hour did the very same thing right right and I would leave it to him to pull something that was needed you know that it wasn't until the 20th century that we started to get into woman wearing pants and wearing something and looking like a man and cutting their hair through the suffrage movement and all these other things we didn't have a lot of issues with that not definitely not as much as Paul had yeah but more would we ever the first of the 20th century and so now all this begins to change and now becomes common for a woman and so now the prophet is used to reach back and all through the 20th century he's blasting out of those things thank God we had a voice saying something because the wave of sin was just coming in and turning things completely crazy yeah yeah and he reaches back there and gets Deuteronomy 22. that says it's an Abomination for a woman to wear that which pertaineth to a man just pertain it to a man in the world there's a lot of other Abominations back there right yeah right go read them I was asked why isn't he bringing them all forward because he's the prophet of the age in the 20th century needed that brought forward and in God's mind this is the way he thinks about it men and women should dress different didn't need that back in back in the tree as much but the 20th century we needed that principle from God yeah everybody understands amen and that helped me to understand then that this pulling from the Old Testament New Testament I left it I left it to the authority of God's chosen man to be able to do that I still check it with the scripture but I'm still released that in the headship that God sent in order for him to be able to decide those things because he's God's man for the hour praise the Lord and I am so thankful for it I started to make a list the other day of how our church War order would be and how our lives would be if we didn't have a word of the prophet in this hour pointing us back to Bible and Bible faith oh I'm telling you friends this service would have been a chaos tonight right the brothers and the brothers would have been hugging other sisters maybe kissing them and I could go on and on and on and on yeah we ought to thank God and rejoice for what he has done and what he is doing can you say Amen so now Deuteronomy two laws you have two laws here because he says first of all uh let's get back to Deuteronomy 6 then okay let's bring it down to our homes good verse 2 the thou mightest fear the lord thy God to keep all his Commandments and his command and his Commandments which I command thee thou and thy son thy son all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged here therefore Israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that ye might increase mightily as the Lord God of thy fathers have promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honey that's blessing there you're going to be blessed by doing this hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord I wonder why I put that in there once again because of our hearts and the way they can lean to serve other gods you know he simplified it for us he simplified any confusion you only need to serve one Lord there's only one God always remember when you go and start to be start to be influenced by other gods or other Persuasions or other things don't forget hero Israel the Lord of God is one Lord and one God and thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart all thy Soul all they might and these words which I command thee that they shall be in thine heart so the first thing is that it's not an outside God had in his mind a change of heart that would be lived from the heart not just a commandment that was what his desire was so that's the first thing he wanted to be from the heart but the second thing the second thing he says what do I do with these Commandments and statues and judgments from the prophet what do I do with these things that God has distributed to us how to live in this hour what do I do with him well pray and live them from your heart but the second thing he said to do is I want you to teach them to your children brothers and sisters have children uh he says I want you to take those things and teach them to your children diligently I didn't have a chance to look that up but we know what diligently means it doesn't mean just a haphazard thing Lord help us I feel corrected tonight yeah this thing this should be a priority and this should be diligently done teach the your children pass them on to your children diligently and as I said last week it was applied to the home in other words I don't think this is saying we'll bring it to the homes now I don't think this is saying that the teaching they get at Sunday school every Sunday morning um Joshua fit in the Battle of Jericho that teaching is not enough to say oh they'll get taught at church and I'll bring them you know every year at Christmas or I'll bring it here if I can just get them there that's enough influence that's not what the Bible is saying it's saying you're supposed to teach it to him at home and saturate their lives with the word of God Amen God gives the priority of blessed families and that's when parents saturate their home with his Commandments his statutes his judgments that came from the prophets why in the home why in the home well why do we do it in the home because first of all we're not allowed to do it too many other places we're not allowed we're not allowed to teach this other places okay and so the home is one place in this world that we can have full uh control can you say man we can teach what we want in our homes at least still to this day also I can still teach what I want here in the church appraisal or may change someday but praise the Lord I can preach the dictates of my heart what God gives me a revelation thankfully I've got some people here to come and listen to me but listen you know that's it someday this may go away and there'll be fewer places but we know for the home it's a place we can teach the children and so seize that opportunity because there's when they get out in the world when they get out places they're not going to hear the word as much they're going to hear a lot of different theories a lot of different ideas they're going to have attacks against the word of God they're going to be persecuted they're going to be put down you know I my heart goes out to some of these young girls they get asked questions all the time why in the world do you wear these dresses all the time uh Hannah was telling me the other day just constantly bombarded and it can be a good thing because it kind of probes you to kind of figure out what you what you believe that is a good thing but I pray for them because that's a pressure and it's a lot of times it's not just someone asking a sincere question it's it's a persecution it's a spirit behind it it's not a sincere question someone you want to learn it's a it's a it's got something pushing with it that tries to make you feel like an idiot tries to make you look like an oddball we know we'll be oddballs but people make it worse and and so a lot of you adults who've experienced that all your life but as the children come into it and teenagers it's a rough thing I pray for you may God give you Grace because we're not called to blend in with the world we're not called We're called to follow God's precepts kind of follow his word and that becomes a difficult thing when you get out there it's not welcome in this world you've got a lot of influences a lot of different things we got scoffers in the last days that say where's the promise of his coming we got scoffers towards the message of the hour we got scoffers to the the second coming and how he will come uh we got all kinds of persecution that we're going to face out there thank the Lord when we come in our homes hopefully you're ordering your home that it's not just like the world they ought to be able to come to a place that they know the emphasis is going to be not all entertainment couch potato and and potatoes you know and potato chips and food no there's going to be some emphasis on the word of God because it's the only place we have left one of the only places we have left so seize the opportunity the face of that child as soon as they're old enough and read them the word of God mothers especially to have most time with them teach them the Fifth Gospel teach them the things of God teach them what you know you don't have to be a scholar a theologian but just teach them what you know can you say Amen integrated into your home the the word is something that is not good enough just to learn in Sunday school or in the Sunday services or Wednesday Services can you say man he's saying to them teach it to your child diligently children and thou shalt talk of them when thou sit us in thy house and when thou walkest by the way and when the Elias down and when the Rises up and thou shalt bind them look at look at look how saturated that is when you get up when you uh sit down when you go to bed thou and thou shalt bind them for a sight upon thy hand they shall be as frontless between thine eyes and thou shall write them upon the post of thy house and on thy Gates praise the Lord and you stay there a while you just start to get in the presence of God feel him one of my children uh kind of woke me up late the other night because God had showed them something in the word they were sitting there reading and something opened up to them and they they said I know God has spoken to me through the scripture and I said I said that's what it's all about connecting with God and that is known it's no longer about parents or church and all that it's that God has spoken to me through the word of God Amen he's become real to me he's become personal to me I think we need more experiences of that in our children in our lives and our kids we need to encourage that because that's what's going to get them through this age that's what's going to give them overcoming power Maya's word I overcome praise the Lord and so I was just so rejoicing in that and and that doesn't happen too often but it should be happening more often often amen so the word is not something we just get the word is he's teaching us you know put it upon write it upon the posts of thy house and on my Gates he's teaching us that the word is uh it's it's not just an hour schedule in your busy life it is life the word is life that's what should be to us the word should be life to us it is our life we have the rest is just a sideshow this is our life the word of God amen and the word it should be our life Christ must be the sinner not a religion not a thing to run through when you're in run to when you're in trouble a lot of people are like that all of a sudden now when they run into trouble then they become a prayer Warrior then they run to things then they say I need the answers in the word and they crack their Bible open because they run into trouble in life I need an answer or I gotta make a choice on a job and so they haven't cracked their Bible got into the word hardly at all but now when there's an emergency then they go do it no it's supposed to be all the time integrated with the word the word is integrated into every part of our lives that's God's thought on it that's what he's trying to say here in Deuteronomy the word integrated into our lives can you say Amen praise the Lord so uh and as I was getting to you I had a few notes here to get to why God wanted it so integrated with him and I mentioned to you take these precepts take these things integrate them into our daily lives that we could never forget them now that's another reason God wanted them to do that because he knows how forgetful we are first of all we're influenced by idols and if we get away from the word too much we become more susceptible to Idols that's why I said it the second thing is that we forget so staying close to the word of God helps you not to forget the word as much Paul said I I bring these things into remembrance I stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance and so if we get away from something then we forget things but if we're staying close to it then we realize that we can remember a little bit better we're staying close to the word and so now take these precepts and bring it into your daily life so you don't forget and God says plaster it everywhere plaster it everywhere put it everywhere he's concerned that you would forget so he says put it on your house put it up above things talk about it when you get up talk about it when you go to sleep and so now I would say this for them it was not good enough just to talk about the event at Mount Sinai or the prophet at Mount Sinai now he's saying whatever came from Mount Sinai I want you to talk about it at home again it's not good enough just to believe Moses is a prophet it's not good enough just to believe that God spoke to us through a prophet that is not good enough what we have to look at is what he's saying here is that take what has come to us and let it be integrated into your life and it'll take you into your inheritance amen because the final voice to the final age the final voice is not the seventh angel the final voice is not uh the prophet William Branham the final voices the bride it says it in Revelations 21 can you say amen he says the spirit and the bride say come there's nothing there about brother Branham it's about the spirit of the Bride saying come if you're thirsty come we know that if the bride coming into her inheritance that's the purpose of the message coming praise the Lord hallelujah oh may I come into my inheritance may you come into your inheritance that's why he sent the word of God for this hour so the people could come into this these these blessings praise the Lord and what it is that's truly theirs so one of the reasons that we come into the blessings if we don't come to Blessings is if we forget so stay close to the word God knows how we're built as an individual and we are built in a way that has a diversified heart the human being with all his emotions can be idolatrous and distracted to other gods than the true God knows that and the only way to keep that from happening is be consumed with God consume with his word and Christ is revealing the word can you say Amen so he says then also when you love me love me with all your heart God says I don't want lip service yeah right okay I don't want you to make this a religion I don't want you to make the message of religion right somebody said the other day people have done it that's right I agree people have made it a code people have made it a religion it's true it's from God I believe there's it's I believe with all my heart but people can do that God doesn't want lip service God doesn't like he says I want this thing to be in your heart and to love me with all that you got this isn't some mechanical intellectual dry-eyed deal this is something with passion of the Holy Ghost can you say Amen this is not a ritual of burning a candle this is not a theology this is directing who we are as a person toward God all the time to be to direct how many knows you can direct your heart you can lean your heart we talked about it in a couple's meeting insteading to let the heart go anywhere we direct the heart and we direct it by the word of God and it's always directed towards God when we stand the word and so he knows what's in our heart and so this is a person directing their person towards God all the time he knows when it's from the heart just like a wife knows when a husband says something from his heart you can see it in his eyes you can feel it in his touch you can hear it in his voice and it's the same with God With Us he can tell whether it's passionate or not or whether it's lip service same thing he said to the laosians I'd rather have you cold than have you lukewarm amen so it's God sharing his heart with us it would no longer be good enough just to believe and acknowledge that his presence came and he gave his word through a prophet that would no longer be good enough at this point well I I remember science I want to tell my kids about cyanide I want to tell them about the the cloud and I want to tell them about the the fire that was there and I want to tell them about the voice and it thundered and all that it didn't say to do that no no that's not good enough to talk about that stuff to your children take what God gave us and teach it to your children you understand and probably a lot of people won't do that but when they read Moses saying this stuff is that oh my this is getting to be quite a responsibility here that it's not good enough just to talk about what happened on the mount with the prophet right but take what was brought and teach it integrate it into your life keep it as the Forefront of your life praise the Lord let these fires consume you daily can you say Amen and so it's not good enough just to acknowledge his presence and that a word Prophet came but under the pressures coming in this hour under the pressure we're under I believe that we must keep the word always before us talk about it I'd say under these modern times we live on saints of God the only way to live Victorious and laodicea is to let the fire of God just consume you daily fires of God not weekly stay staying in that channel under the spot where the glory comes out can you say Amen praise the Lord You Have To Change and cut out some things sometimes in your life to spend more time in your work in the word but I'll tell you you never regret it you'll never regret it young people you'll never regret if you cut out certain things and you've got a lot of time right now I love it when young people say I don't have any time you got a lot of time right now yeah amen but in our busy schedules trust me if you cut some things out and begin to spend some more time in the word the glory is going to come out glory is going to affect you the glory of the word all of the glory of the God all the presence all all that God is comes through that channel of the word of God amen so it's the age it's the time that we live in and I wanted you to notice that this Sinai pops up in Malachi 4. and it's strange that it does but it he refers to this here remember I said the three exoduses and Elijah comes before the Third Exodus in the third axis as well and the Malachi 4 and verse 4 and verse 3 says and uh I was talking about the day of judgment talking about the day cometh verse 1 chapter 4 the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all that proud all that all the proud yea and all that do wicked leaves shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them saith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name so the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this say the Lord of hosts and about the day of judgment verse 4 remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments next verse behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord look how that's in there yeah I I'll let the Lord just reveal that to you he has to reveal that to you and that God is going to send God sends someone before the great and Dreadful day the Lord to turn our hearts of the father to the children are the children of the fathers last I come and smite the Earth with a curse and right in between that as he's speaking about the day of judgment and the ministry that comes of the restoration remember the law of Moses and the statues and the judgments amen God is going to in this day does the same thing and so the statutes the judgments the Commandments they become pretty important and God wants us to integrate them completely in our lives can you say Amen so it's a parallel Moses day in our day it's it's bringing the same thing God dispensing and revealing the seals to us one of the greatest events if not the greatest event to come in the last days that God taken the seals off of himself Christ taking the seals off of himself God bringing those angels to bring that it too was on a mountain we have the same thing now what must we do we must stay close to those things lest our hearts become idolatrous lest our hearts are pulled to other gods lest our hearts are pulled to another Jesus Paul said I fear that you you preached another Jesus stay close to the word I'm not even asking you to stay close to me stay in the word get in the word get your Bible study the word of God stay in the word of God that's what he's telling us to do and I think it's the cure for lukewarmness if we stay in the word can you say Amen it's the cure for lukewarmness so we'll read a couple of things as we close here I want it I'll get to this uh next time but does it say to continue this teaching our children the law of Moses the Commandments of Moses the statues and judgments does it continue to say to do that when the people of Israel got into the promised land the answer is yes Moses my servant is dead Joshua 1 Moses my servant is dead let's read it together Joshua 1. now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of none Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead I wish people had a revelation of that I mean talk about for today because they're still trying to continue on as if he's still alive amen but they need to realize that everything that all all that his ministry is meant to do and left us with is to take the people into their inheritance Joshua being the type of the Holy Ghost okay but Moses my servant is dead his ministry is over as far as his physical Ministry it is over right right now therefore rise go to this go over this Jordan down to this people under the lamb which I do give them even to the children of Israel every place at the soul of your foot shall shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses because that was the purpose of incident Moses bring him out of Egypt bring him through the Wilderness but to get to the promised land to get to The Inheritance that's the purpose from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even into the Great River the river Euphrates and all the land of the Hittites verse 5 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses Joshua so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor for safety be strong and of good courage for under this people shall thou divided inheritance the land which I swear unto the fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observed to do according to the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left the thou mayest what Prosper whether it's so ever thou goest this book of the law shall not Depart of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate here we go again here it is again yeah so let's let's get rid of that thought that once they come into their inheritance that we can ditch the law of Moses that we can ditch the statutes of Moses sorry Moses is dead so let's let's ditch that and get into our inheritance no you can't get into your inheritance if you leave and don't meditate in those things that he gave amen the book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observed to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou should have not just success but good success I'm preaching about blessed families you want to bless family hear the word of God we're going into our inheritance friends I can't wait to our I can't wait to just receive it all because I know when I receive it all I know I'm getting out of here I have a new body that's a part of that inheritance I'm ready to go come quickly Lord Jesus can you say Amen but there never do we have a Biblical principle that we move forward in those things and leave what Moses brought what the prophet brought it never works that way because he uses that word and the anointing of it to bring the people into their hearings praise the Lord the word still anointed now brother Brandon says here as we close he's speaking and praying he says heal the sick tonight father make the blind to see the deaf to hear the dumb to speak the cripples to walk my cure the heart trouble cancer in all different kinds of troubles God I pray that you'll mend up broken homes notice he's mentioned in the blind to see the deaf to hear the cripples to walk and then he says men broken homes and make the ones that in homes that's indifferent fathers indifferent to their mothers mothers indifferent to their fathers who doesn't pray give them an experience tonight that they'll start a family altar at their home Granite Lord and he says another place you fathers you mothers are you ready to establish altar in your house are you ready to established the family Altar and take the tell take that television out are you ready to take the deck of cards off the table them comic books that your children's reading preparing their little mind for the blast that the devil is going to give them are you ready to establish the old family altar again or do you just want to continue on the Way You Are you want to continue on you're not in the condition of the coming yet but I pray that you're like Samson you see the price and you're ready Lord let me die with them and Samson he's referring to is the one who said even though it didn't look like there was any hope he said once more Lord that's what he's referring to if you feel you're not in the spirit of Revival and you're not dead and drying up you can say the same thing as samton Samson can you say man Lord once more fill me with your power once more and then he establishes that and ties that excuse me ties that together with mothers and fathers are you ready to establish family altar in your home are you ready to apply the token to your home and last week I was reading the token where he gave the specifics of of getting the dirt out of your home and that's what it really is friends we could go in Long discussions about what to do and what to watch I was saying but he's referring to the dirt and most television is dirt come on now let's grow up and realize it and so that's why he says something of that that's bringing dirt in your home that has to be purged to apply the token so it's the dirt you get out and you mentioned the short skirts you mentioned a bunch of things that we read last Wednesday night okay he says apply the token to your home get the dirt get the trash out of the home buy because that doesn't fit in a home that's being word centered and then I read later where it says now when you apply it apply it with love and believe that it's going to help because I see a lot of people apply it with no love you say man lost their marriages lost their families lost respect because they didn't apply it in love that better be the motivation of the love of God and a heart for God children I'm doing this as a love of God and and and let a daddy and mommy see the the image in front of those children and I hope you're learning something from me friends I'm not a perfect father of perfect uh daddy by any means or husband my wife will tell you but you know what I just want to share these things out of the world with us because God's given us word that if we apply it our families can be blessed it's not easy to apply sometimes but these things when you apply it apply it in love and I can imagine those fathers sitting down in Paul's day I'm closing now just in case you're worried I can imagine those fathers sitting down in Paul's day and sitting with their kids in that hour and saying no guys I I I've studied the some of the Old Testament and I I've studied things and but God has spoken to this man and Jesus spoke to him and I believe he's been called in this age to be able to set the order for the church in this age and we're receiving his letters from these different places and we're you know those letters were just letters Paul sent to the local churches and they just get up and read them they just got up and read what Paul said and he's saying sons and daughters I believe God has moved upon this generation he spoke to us so we're going to apply these things to our home I really do believe that fathers sat down and did that and some of them maybe even has said as Paul as Peter because later on Peter says and even our beloved brother Paul who has said some things that are hard to be understood even Peter said some things Paul said were hard to swallow but you never see Paul Peter wavering to divide against Paul because there was a position there God gave him Peter had position too because but because of that office he said we need to follow these things we need to adhere to these things and I believe Peter did as a father I believe other fathers did it in that day age in that time and that's why I try to show you God never breaks his scriptural patterns he brought his law through the Moses he brought the word for the Moses for the people to know how to live in the age first Exodus second Exodus here Jesus is filling the people with the Holy Ghost and splitting his Spirit into them speaking to Paul to bring to bring the message to the Gentiles for that day Paul lays out all the church order and all these things and marriage and divorce situations and situations we didn't know about but he's laying it out he's laying the order for the age and God has done the same thing in our generation before the Third Exodus let's Stand Together we are a blessed people no doubt about it father we thank you tonight Lord that we could hear from your word the scriptures that speak to us we pray for the parents and the families and Lord we you're aware more even than I am of course that there's families that get into situations sometimes or their struggles because of the hour we live in so Lord We Don't Preach a certain image in certain just a certain thing we just preach how the families can be blessed even moms raising children on their own without a daddy or a daddy raising children without the mom different situations speaking to young people don't have their families yet but yet Lord your word is is important to be said because Lord we all need to hear these things because this is your thoughts in your mind of how you would bless families Lord help me as a father help me as a husband help these brothers Lord be the daddies of their homes that you desire them to be I know they desire to be that Lord not that they be theologians Lord and know everything of the word but God humbly just taking that word and breaking it the bread of life to their families Lord and making it the center of their lives it's not so much Lord sometimes what we read or that we study but it's what we live live it's the word lived in front of them or that's that's the main thing so I just pray you'll bless the families of the church your literal life and those are listening in the internet anyone else Lord that we can influence just got a call yesterday from a couple they don't come to this church and they just want me to talk to them and try to help them in their marriage Lord we want to help anyone anyone we can help and point them to the principles of

all of our heart thank you fathers we commit this service to you now the people are dismissed I just pray that you'll bless them and be with them how many would just raise your hand and say pray for
