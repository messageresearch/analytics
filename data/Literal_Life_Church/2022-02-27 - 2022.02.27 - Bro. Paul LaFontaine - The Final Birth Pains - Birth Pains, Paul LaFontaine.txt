========================================

morning as we read a verse of scripture together and then we'll go back to john 16. we're grateful we thank you choir brother kenny for ministering to this morning and our service just have such a good uh representation and team here to bring us into the presence of the lord and create the right atmosphere for the word of god we're thankful for him let's continue to remember jim holtmann in prayer as he's in surgery here this morning we're keeping just tabs on that and just wanted to see how he was doing just here in the next hour or so so let's just keep him in prayer while he's in surgery amen we're going to read from second peter chapter 3 first and then if you let me go into john 16 we'll do that as well second peter 3 2 peter 3. i'd like to read we'll just take the time and read from verse 3 knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation so this group knows that things are to take place but they're mocking it and scoffing it their and their their manner of life is to live as if it's not going to happen but if god said it's going to happen it's going to happen so this is another group who's living they're scoffing but their their manner of life is to live not only scoffing it and don't not believing that it's true but there is something else in the world that says if it is true we're going to do everything within our power to stop it and that's another weakness and arrogance of man for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished it happened how many can say amen but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto the fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but believe beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day of the lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but his long-suffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens will shall pass away with great noise and elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that therein are shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation all holy manner of life in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of our god wherein the heaven shall be on fire shall be dissolved and the element shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise now here's the other group we're living according to his promise we're living on his promises we're looking for something else can you say amen and you can't endure what's coming on the earth unless you know of the promise that there's something else coming nevertheless we according to his promise look for the new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless if you won't mind back to john one of the gospels john chapter 16 and they can pull up there pull it up there quickly if they want john 16 and verse 20 verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow your sorrow and here's the other group now there's one group that that may sorrow and yet they may rejoice in this world we may go through sour but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of a child she rem she remembers no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world blessed be his name i want to speak this morning a little on the the final birth pains heavenly father we are happy christians here today lord not out of just a shallow emotional thing but lord our hearts are settled our hearts are anchored and lord i heard someone this week saying that the very day that thursday i think it was when we went to war this believer woke up and they had a dream that the rapture took place and lord she just got on her knees and just began to pray say lord let me be ready these are the things that's happening lord and believers are saying in their hearts this morning lord if there's anything that you have to do in my life to change me let it be now let me not leave this building this morning until you change me lord i don't want to leave the same way that i came for god we're looking at things from a different perspective when we know that god there is a promise that lays ahead of us we're not living as if we plan as if you're coming 10 years from now but we want to live every moment as if the moment is now that's the way we want to live maybe that's why there's such a hunger to be in the house of the lord today there's a cry to be here lord and to be where your presence is to be where we can hear the word of god where it can encourage us where it can solidify things for us where we can see your perspective lord god and we could that our eyes could be to the worldly things and our pressures and our possessions all that becomes strangely dim in the light of your glory and grace help us to see you this morning as we commit the service to you and we pray every heart would be blessed and strengthened and encouraged whoever hears in jesus name amen god bless you once you shake somebody's hand and greet them in christian love this morning and god bless you all for coming joining in the house of god those that are listening online all the families that are part of our church god bless you all we love you amen so we want to as we were hearing some of the events this week and we won't be all on the events of course but uh these things trigger our hearts and i was hearing a term quite a bit in the news of that the the news people referring to um world war iii in referring to this world war iii and no one really knows uh if this is that one uh but we know that there's a world war three coming and no one really knows but i think it's interesting that they referred to it and as they kept referring to the world war iii then i thought of birth pains and i thought of that message that brother brown preached because in that as he's talking about different things of that and you're welcome to uh encourage you to listen to that this week and it was a wonderful message to listen to it again yesterday and to see the theme and and the basically the mystery that was unfolded to us to be able to see historical events like the first world war the second world war and then the third one coming on to be able to see that in light of the mystery of scripture and to be able to sing and that's what a prophet does if you didn't know this morning or you're listening a prophet is uniquely gifted to be able to unlock events and unlock the word by the way that he says it we would not be able to do that in ourselves but that's the specialty of a prophet and gifted that the way he says it unlocks the mystery behind it this isn't anything different than what jesus said as the disciples said why do you speak in parables he said because it's given to you to know the mysteries in other words it's given to the believers to know more than just the parable or more than the events but to see the mystery of the events we're blessed this morning and so as they kept saying it i uh as this was uh birth pains is something the prophet referred to when he came to naming what the first two war wars and we probably would have never heard anybody refer to world war one and world war ii as birth pains like a woman has a birth we would have never heard that except he does and he's saying that and i love how the prophet in his simplicity brings something natural to type the spiritual otherwise we wouldn't be able to understand it correctly it's simple because he takes a natural thing that a woman goes through and having a child and he puts that into political events and he referred to the first two wars as birth pains that are coming because the scripture says as i read this morning this this earth is to give way to a new heavens and a new earth in other words there's a new baby coming there's a new earth coming it's not going to be a patched up earth it's going to be a brand new earth can you say amen and whenever you have something brand new coming in god you always have a death and you always have pain that comes before it can you say amen and we'll get into that a little bit because that's the process in god's kingdom that's the way it works in god's kingdom that's not the way that it works in the world we tend to polish ourselves up we tend to try to make ourselves better the world gets better and better we intellectually try to change something or do something or patch up what's already done even if it's dirty and it's filthy we patch it up and do the best we can but when god does something he does it brand new and then it comes the way that its birth is through pain through suffering through hard times can you say amen i'll tell you if you have a real true new birth this morning it's because probably a lot of your life and especially right before the new birth you went through hard times you went through pain because why you had to die out to yourself to have a new birth and it's just the way the kingdom of god works you can avoid it you can get around it you can try to polish it up i'm a good person i'm okay i love god but that's not the new birth there has to be a death before there's a new birth many people will not allow themselves to go through that pain but if they only knew the joy if they only knew what was coming then they would die out to themselves because what god has brand new is so much far beyond what you're living now hallelujah and so now by looking at it this way we see this these nervous scary events as bringing us closer to the birth of a new life a new heavens and a new earth so we see these events as not the scary nervous events that the world looks at it as but we see it as something of giving birth to the new life giving birth to the new world and that is a very exciting result that when it's all over can you say amen the prophet opens the mystery that we know if it's in the final days when it's all over as a woman going through her final days of birth pains when it's all over then a baby is born the pain increases before the baby is born can you say man the contractions increase that you know and how feeble i am to talk about this this morning when i haven't had a baby myself we have professionals in this room that have been through this and none of you guys better talk about you knowing about you don't know nothing and how how many sisters would raise their hand how many has ever had their husbands say to somebody we're going to have a baby or we had a baby and the wife looks over what you mean we we had a baby you didn't do nothing hardly but you mean we partner yeah so none of you but there's some professionals in the room and i'll say this that the mystery of god is actually written in the life of a woman the mystery of the bride the mystery of what the bride goes through the mystery of everything bringing forth christ lies and she lives out this mystery when she dresses modest and lives like god said to the sailor she's she's a light she's a word more than what i can preach the woman is the mystery to this world of what god's doing in his bride that's a pretty important position god bless you sisters we give you praise and honor this morning for holding up that standard she's been through it just they know so i'm not going to talk about it but we know that as she gets closer and closer the pain gets more intense and the suffering gets more intense can you say amen the pains increase but see when you know the joy that's just a few minutes away you can endure and you can have hallelujah in the valley somebody say praise the lord you can have hallelujah in the valley because the joy i'll just say this to you jesus endure endured the most suffering of any human being and he endured that pain at the cross for you and i so we wouldn't have to take it can you say man he endured the worst pain but the bible says he for the joy that was set before him endured the pain of the cross the only way that he could bear it is that the joy that was set before him and that's the same with the revelation with us the only way that we can endure this the only way we can survive this is we know what lies ahead praise the lord so the pains increase there's another reference to it in luke chapter 21 thought i would read that if you guys want to pull up luke chapter 21. it says verse 25 this is where he refers to it luke 21 25 it says and there shall be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars and upon the earth distressed of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall they see the son of man coming in the cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draw now jesus is saying the same thing when there's perplexity of nations when there's earthquakes in diverse places when men's hearts failing for fear when all this stuff begins to intensify and get more and more as you'll see in the scripture more and more then when these things begin to come to pass then we can look up and lift our lift up our head because the joy that's set before us that says to us our redemption is drawing nigh it's the only way to look at events the right way and that's with the revelation you bound by the scare and as i said last sunday you're going to make an issue with some family in the church knowing these events are taken and we're this close you're going to distance yourself from the body of christ now you're going to backslide i say to you as a gospel minister you need to be under the word you need to be clinging to the body of christ you don't need to be running away [Applause] god have mercy on people that are doing that even today god have mercy on their souls so if you don't see it the way jesus say goes on to say look up lift up your head for your redemption is drawing nigh and and so that just uh we'll continue with that in a minute but if you don't see it this way you will be looking at things like the world looks at it where you where you stand and you where you're standing there and they're gonna hand you the next uh fear that you're going to worry about the next year the next conversations at the water cooler started on thursday and guess what it wasn't about covet anymore what happened to coven i mean it's like that's the whole conversation for two years but now that's over and so now if you stand uh not as a believer stance they're gonna hand you the next fear and thing that you need to worry about the next year or two okay they're gonna hand you the next fear and they're done and i don't know if you were watching but this thing starts on thursday morning i believe and then i just see a little small news article that says on friday the cdc will be issuing their lowest uh requirements for mass mass are going away how many can say praise the lord massacre going away man i'll tell you i'm so happy and our counties included gideon looked it up this morning lucas in monroe county it's included the massacre gone praise be to god i feel free i can show you my face but did you ever catch that while the the new thing starts thursday and it's consuming the news cycle and then now all of a sudden now this goes away and if you're carnal you're going to let them hand you the next fear-driven thing that's not how i want to live i'm not waiting for issues to come forth from the cdc or ukraine or anything i'm not going to be bound by their fears i'll do what needs to be done if it doesn't contradict the word but i will refuse to live under the fear that they're handing me every day and you should too can you say man brother brown says if they came to the door and your name was on a box that was being delivered to you and ended up being a box of rattlesnakes your name is on it it's coming to you he talked about symptoms of illness came to your door but guess what you don't have to sign for it so the fear that they're handing out i'm not signing for it anymore i'm not going to sign for that box of rattlesnakes can you say amen they want me to have it but i'm not going to sign for it somebody needs to say praise the lord because you know this is true you know they hand out what they have you know they control the minds of the people it's true friends and the quicker we admit it and say lord i want to be in that hiding place with jesus christ that's where i want to be my peace and my rest is in the word of god that he has sent us and not in the fears of man i guarantee you that's how the saints in the ukraine have to live this morning i guarantee you what a blessing to see some believers and some christians over there send out that song or singing it in ukraine just about broke my heart they're singing peace of god cover me can't sing it in ukrainian maybe rap can cover me through the storm i just i broke down praise the lord hallelujah in the valley the sisters here who have given birth going back to that uh you know they've experienced it and the breaking forth of new life and uh being able to experience the pain that goes through it this is what brother brad refers to and jesus refers to like a woman going through a woman when she's in travail has sorrow because her hours come but as soon as she has delivered the of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy than a man that is born into the world the spiritual birth is the same way as the natural birth a lot of people run from the pain part of it can you say amen but if you would just sit still and know the pain that's in you is to bring forth new life it's not the new birth is not a new intellectual exercise it's not shaking the preacher's hand it's not speaking in tongues it's not a feeling or emotion the new birth goes much deeper than that can you say man and and it works by a natural birth it's the pain that a woman goes through you're not going to get to that new birth without some pain without your system being jolted your life crumbling apart sometimes divorces and all kinds of things can happen and a lot of times it's driving the person in this pain of life to seek god can you say man and to say finally god i need you more than anything else i don't care about anything except a new birth pain drives you to that suffering drives you to that because that's the way god set it up can you say amen praise the lord and and in god's kingdom you can't get around it and and so we see that new life it's not an intellectual but your whole life changes i had some good fellowship with michael and jason coming home friday night from the youth meeting and to see god forming these young men's lives and to be able to hear their testimonies and their story where they came from where they're at now and i don't mean to embarrass them this morning but god god is doing something god these new ones that have come god's doing something in their life but i can tell you it's not without pain it's not without suffering it's not without god challenging the mind and challenging everything they ever knew before it's painful friends but i'll tell you i complimented my brother to see that he's stuck with it he's sticking with it and he's staying around the word of god a lot of people would have bailed out a long time ago but this young man here wants to be baptized here in the next couple weeks he's stuck with the word of god in the name of jesus god's doing something but it's not without pain we think sometimes the birth is just like that but a lot of times it's through a lot of pain and suffering losses can you say amen challenges where the word is rebuking you and all these other things but oh the end result is what we're looking at hallelujah i could join my brother and grab his hand and step into a rapture with brother jason step into a rapture with brother brother michael a bunch of other stories in the church technically you shouldn't be here today through your story you shouldn't be here you should be saying amen to the word of god there's a lot of other places you could be but it's god grace and the pain that you've been through that puts you here this morning amen your story every story is different but i guarantee your story if it's of god will bring you to being ready for a rapture amen amen you don't like your story i don't like mine either we didn't get a choice of our story we didn't get a choice of what our family would go through we didn't get that choice but god certainly was watching over it and the most inhumane the most the most tragic things that happen to us can't get what much worse than brothers throwing joseph into the pit his own flesh and blood selling him to egypt into slavery slavery you can't get much within feeling rejected and betrayed and yet god's working to fulfill the vision for his life hallelujah i feel his presence here this morning i may not be long i'm not feeling that well i'm feeling uh i'm not accepting those rattlesnakes and symptoms but in the in my soul i just feel that i love the presence of god i love to be near him i i love to hear his voice and like brother boaz said if you're if you're hearing that still small voice this morning you you know that he has to be real close for you to hear a still small voice i think god doesn't have to shout at us but it's a still small voice so your whole life changes when god's getting over you it it it inconvenes it in it gives you inconveniences in life doesn't it do that with a woman uh that's become pregnant and her life now becomes inconvenienced once again sisters you know all about it but life wasn't about it you can't always move around as easy as you did as you get bigger and i was suggesting those uh i read up on all this you know and i was i i said hun i read up that you're when you're pregnant like you're supposed to be wearing snow skis around the house and walking in them because your back will get out of shape so do you want me to go buy you some snow skis and you to walk around the house no i don't want no scooters snow skis i'm not gonna waddle around i'm already waddling around snow skis that's what they said and your life becomes inconvenienced and you can't do all the things you did before and you get you go through morning sickness and you go through these things and and then there's sisters that don't have any of that which everybody else is jealous of they don't have any of it but in most cases you have changes and you can't fit into the clothes that you fit in before and and what's going on and there's something growing inside of you there's a new life growing inside of you and this is a type of the spiritual is that when you have new life that's getting ready to be birthed in you there's going to be pain there's going to be suffering you're going to be inconvenienced life won't be the same can you say man and and that's why today we live in a day of abortion it's a spirit can you say man because women are saying i'm not going to go through all that i want a baby but i don't want to go through all that so i'm going to end that i don't want to go through that suffering as brother bram says she's going to mother a little dog and she's going to abort the baby and she don't want to have all the inconveniences of life she'll take care of a little snotty dog excuse me for being sarcastic and treat him like a baby because she's neglecting i don't want to go through all that pain i don't want to go through all that suffering and then you know of course they have uh the epidural that helps women to go through the pain which i'm not against that i thank god for it for my wife because she she needed that some sisters don't need it and then sisters get real heroic and say i don't need any of it i want to go through a normal normal thing and my wife got that on a couple of our babies she said i i don't want to go have any epidurals anything i don't want to put that in my body i'm going to do it and paul i need your help to stay with me we went through classes we did it we were ready breathe do this lamaze whatever it was and we're ready i don't want to do this i don't want any medicine i want to do this naturally it must be something of god in them or something i don't know and and so i said we're doing this i think it was the third one or whatever i said okay after we went she had long labors it was like 20 i don't know 20 48 hours long on labor's i thought she was gonna die everything every time i thought she was finished because she looked like she was going to die shouldn't have said that she said that in one of them she said i feel like i'm going to die and i said well you look like you're gonna die honey that was the wrong thing a few hours after that i was down in the cafeteria i was that's fine they give them something and you know the old joke goes that when when should you take the epidural and somebody said on the news as soon as you find out you're pregnant start taking the epidural just keep feeding it but that's all it's all remember that's a type of the spiritual that i don't want to go through the pain of it and there's churches today thousands of them that are making an atmosphere you don't have to go through the pain of dying to yourself you don't have to give up your makeup you don't have to give up all these things of the world you don't have to diet yourself you don't have to quit and keep no no you can come and give your heart to the lord and put your name on the book that's that's something that's trying to help get rid of the pain and suffering but you'll never get to a true new birth is this okay this morning no there's churches and you can go join them and i encourage you if you're miserable here you probably should go join them because they're not they're going to make a painless experience they're not going to preach against sin they're not going to nab the sin in your life they're not going to do it they're going to sugarcoat it and say that you're okay but listen i want to be under the gospel of jesus christ the one paul preached the one brother branham preached and the holy ghost field ministers of all time have preached it straight like it is not holding anything back now if that minister has an agenda to offend somebody that's that's between that's wrong but when it's the love of god correcting from the word of god i want more of that in my life than i ever wanted it and when i get tough on certain things thank god i have some saints texting me saying preach it like it is in the word of god don't hold back your church may get smaller but keep preaching the word where else you're going to go to hear somebody correct you where else you're going to go in this world not too many places will tell you where you're wrong in your life if it's the voice of the lord i want them to correct me now i don't want to be on judgment day i want my judgment right here judgment begins at the house of god can anybody say that's the scripture i don't want to wait till judgment day i want him to judge me right now take the sin out of my life right now so the spiritual birth is the same way and i just finished with sister rebecca i've embarrassed her enough today but you know just to say that each one of these things i thought she was going to and then the third one this i was going through and helping her and we we went we put her in a tub there and we were doing everything we had been learned so she could avoid the epidural and after 48 hours or whatever it is she's looking to say go get him go get him get me the epidural i want to get the upper door and i go but but hon i promised you to stick with you we're going to do this thing and she you go get the epidural but here's the here's the exciting thing is that i i was worried after every prank after every delivery and i was actually suggesting ask the doctor she's a couple times she come real close and she was bad i thought i was going to lose her and that was me and so know that we're fine and after everybody i said hun should we consider maybe this one being the last one and i was talking no no she's holding that baby and she forgot she forgot every pain she forgot the last 48 hours wasn't even her mind holding that baby smiling sweat dripping down and her hair not like it looks this morning just completely no sleep for 48 hours but she's got a smile on her face i said honey you think maybe we can no no no i'm not done and after after the third one she's saying the second one third one after the fourth one it was real bad and actually after that point the doctor did suggest we stop after that because it was starting to get she was getting a little older and stuff so we took that wisdom but but she's still saying after the fourth one once she's holding that baby who was it gabriella and you can imagine holding gabriella like you you'd want to keep having 15 more babies after gabriella i'm serious it's like we're having we're going to be 19 and county we're going to have a television show she told me i said hon don't you think don't you think this is pretty rough i'm worried about you don't you think we should just be done she says in canada not let's not make the decision i'm not done and i go back to the cafeteria and say this woman is crazy she's absolutely crazy going through all of this pain going through all this suffering so if i'm scaring all you young girls that are single right now don't you ever let me scare you because there's nothing there's nothing in the world like bringing forth a child into this world nothing like it the pain the suffering you probably will have it but there's nothing like the joy or you could be like sister phyllis used to be in our church just past the way she's in colorado but she's in the church when we started it and she's she's nobody knew her age because she never told it so we never researched it but she was she had to be 90 something but she always looked about 50 40 and nobody you know not a lot of tucker age and so one time i was talking to her about that and preaching on the pain you know it didn't well it didn't happen you know well it didn't she's in west virginia well it didn't happen that way with me i just didn't feel anything during the during the pregnancy or during the labor she said it was just like a it was just like a little tickle and then i had the baby and my wife was sitting here soon a tickle that's it that's how you got out of it with just a tickle i'm serious but most people it doesn't happen that way it's pain suffering can you say man but when the baby's there it's all done and jesus said it when the baby comes then all of a sudden the joy that's there and he said that when the joy is there and the joy of what has come you don't remember any of the pain anymore i'm telling you friends we're getting ready to step into a dimension i said we're getting ready to step into a dimension real soon and there's things that you won't be able to remember no more you won't remember those bills that are due tomorrow you won't remember the hard time that you came through earlier in your marriage you won't remember all the struggles in your family you won't remember the people that done you wrong amen you won't remember any listen if god can forget it all then there's a place that we come that we can forget it all and when we step into that other dimension the pain the sorrow the trials our story we will not remember any of it because of the joy that's not a story this morning that's a reality for every believer sitting in this room we're getting ready to step into another dimension that you'll never remember in the pa any of the pain of life you'll never remember it i'll tell you how to stop the service and rejoice and shout say thanks be to god for this promise this is a promise that is real can you say amen and the pain let's pull up that quote and read what he says about these birth pains in the message birth pains he says the first war war showed great birth pains it showed one of the first birth pains of going into labor because of that time for her we had brought forth the bombs and we had machine guns and poison gas and you remember maybe many of you cannot i was just a little boy about eight years old but i remember then speaking of this mustard and chlorine gas and so forth hey just look like it just gets started and they said it would burn up the whole earth it'd kill everybody well it might be a breaking of that just winds blow across the earth and now everybody was scared to death of that great weapon of poison gas the earth went through had its first birth pains and we find out now we've had a second war war war and her pains was much greater it it was a more terrific all the time the birth pain of the earth she almost had to give way during the time of the atomic bomb because it would destroy a whole city it was much greater than the pains of the first world war of destruction to the earth now she knows that her time of deliverance is at hand that's the reason she's so nervous frustrated as she is is because that there is a hydrogen bomb and missiles of the air that could destroy the whole world one nation is scared of the other no matter how little it is they got those missiles that they can claim one of them they can direct them by the stars and drop them anywhere in the world they want to russia as i heard on the news the other day she claims that she can destroy our nation this nation and keep the atoms and the things from breaking up her nation we don't know what to do about it everybody is making these claims and so and it's so people's science has broken into god's great laboratory until they're going to destroy themselves god lets always lets wisdom destroy himself god doesn't destroy anything man destroys himself by wisdom as he did at the beginning taking satan's wisdom instead of the word now she knows she must give way this earth he's talking about she cannot stand it russia i believe would destroy this nation today if she thought that she could destroy it and then preserve herself any of those little nations could do it but they're afraid because they know that this world cannot stand in its orbit under such conditions the world knows that her birth pains is so great she's got to give way there's going to be a new birth born at hand i'm thankful for that i'm tired of this one how many are tired of this earth anyone knows that there's a place i'll tell you friends the last couple days i don't know what's coming we might know you another 10 years i don't know that i'm not telling you this morning but i begin to look at more things in perspective of what's coming just around the corner i looked at my house i looked at my the cars i looked at all my responsibilities i looked at this and i'm thinking monday i got to do this i got to do that i got to do that and i thought just think about it if this happened right now i can leave every bit of this and just leave it right here well who's going to take care of it i don't care who's going to take care of it somebody needs it during tribulation there's a just juvenile thoughts i guess but listen that's what i was thinking i would be ready to leave all this even this beautiful church i'm ready to move can you say amen leave it for somebody else oh but you've worked so hard no i haven't worked so hard for this kingdom this is a city that's going to end this is a here we have no continuing city don't get your mind on your i.r.a no no we're going to leave it all you said anyone knows here's the place of death and sorrow and all the kinds of discrepancies and so forth i'm glad that she has to give way and i'm glad that time is at hand this 1965. i'm glad is that the way you're living i'm glad that the time is at hand and john said of old even so come lord jesus there's a place where brother branson says when russia goes for the oil i've been pondering that as well and there are articles that in the last few days that clearly say in the last few few weeks this is this is about oil more than anything else it's not about oil because oil is about money and money is about who controls in the empires who has the most funds but it goes back many of the articles go back to the oil even though russia says well it's it's about this that and the other when when brother brahm says that it's interesting he uses oil like that when russia goes for the oil then watch then but maybe we thought of it oh they're going to go down and when they invaded afghanistan in 79 then everybody's using that quote which is fine when russia goes for the oil and we know there's reasons to go down there but you see now the last 20 30 years it's they've been one of the biggest suppliers of oil russia so when he says when they go for the oil well they're still going for the oil but they started bringing up oil there in their own country and now they've become a big supplier where even our country's a bit dependent on them so when they say they're going to go down somewhere no but when russia goes for the old i i hear that as saying it's all about the oil it's all about the empire it's all about control which goes back to money which goes back to the oil so there was great eyesight by a prophet that's right that we're still hearing articles the last few days about this is related to the oil 40 of europe's heating and natural gas is supplied by russia that's why they're nervous right now 40 of the heating and natural gas is supplied from russia but russia pays 2 billion a year for them to run a pipeline through ukraine to get to the rest of europe so now that's that's interrupted that's going to be interrupted and so ukraine joining nato or eu would change many things in the flow of oil and the flow of money and the flow of power and the eventual world dominance so it's all tied together 60 of russia's export is this so their economy and thus 40 of its budget so this is related to money this is related to oil to summarize that to summarize it there's a reason that a prophetic eye could tie oil with russia the way he did i know it's about a dictator i know it's about all of a sudden now a friendly democratic guy shaking hands and trying to squeeze out a smile in front of the cameras with obama and with trump and yet we know all along that soviet thing is all still laying there and this is the proof of it this friendly guy trying to squeak out he has a hard time smiling he's trying to just be friendly and democratic and all of a sudden now it all changes there's a reason that every time she goes back to her aggressive way that ruthless old soviet spirit instead of a friendly democratic there's a reason and every time she goes back to that aggressive nature the oil prices skyrocket every time fifty dollars a gallon of a barrel now up to 110 did the same thing when they invaded afghanistan in 79 every time just it fluctuates even our own country our gas prices may be going up probably will be already up probably going up some more so it's related to oil in some way it's who the oil who has the oil who has control of it goes back to power isn't that amazing that the profit ties in the natural that it all is summarized in oil on the natural side and isn't it amazing on the spiritual side there's a wise virgin and there's a foolish virgins and the difference in the two is related to oil it's related to oil when russia goes for the oil when the bride goes for the oil what are you willing to do to go for the oil hallelujah and even the foolish virgins say we recognize we've did our church we've did this we've done modern and we've brought rock and roll in the church and we've done everything to try to help human beings and yet now we're recognizing we need the oil never mind all the risks we're lacking the oil there might be people in my own church and i pray god recognized that they'd have her help them to recognize it's not about church administration and church problems and the people who hurt you at the end of the day all that fades away do i have the oil [Applause] do my children have the oil and i say that prayer trumps all other prayers god i'm gonna keep praying until my children have the oil and that's more important than your money it's more important if you have a job or lose your job that's more important than cohen that's more important than the fears of anything that's more important than this war going on can you say man the oil is the prominent thing and they said you better go and buy to those who are selling because we just have enough for ourselves you can't get your oil from someone else you can't lean on a church and go in on the pastor's coattail because you want to be friends with them no no no no you need the oil you need the oil hallelujah somebody say praise the lord amen somebody say praise the lord it's all about the oil so the principle is birth pains without pain without suffering without death the new cannot come on i'm going to move along now one of the favorite things in nature to me is the trees in the fall you know that i love the fall time and i didn't bring a picture with me i have a lot of pictures i collect them i found another one the other day in a in an office that we purchased i found a beautiful just a beautiful picture and those colors in the fall are so extremely brilliant and bright and the most beautiful thing you've ever seen you know that and i love it it just it moves me every time i see the smoky mountains that way and just see all the different colors brilliant so i took a picture of this picture and i sent it to a brother who's going through a kind of a hard time right now in the church and going through some suffering and starting to see some things in his life that he needs to address and die out to and i know he's going through a death and i sent that to him and i says isn't it amazing only in the kingdom of god that you can have something so beautiful while they're going through a death [Music] it is only in the kingdom of god that death becomes a beautiful thing beautiful is the death of his saints we don't want to lose our loved ones but in christ it's not an end can you say amen it's a beautiful thing they go on to their new body can you say amen only in the kingdom of god is death a beautiful thing and i was encouraging the brother that you keep dying out to yourself you keep doing that the beauty of god is showing in your life praise the lord hallelujah amen so you know the lily was one of the prophet's favorite flowers and he comments in birth pains the lily says but look at what that lily that pond lily he says i love that flower it comes up the lily said and considered how it grows and toils has to bring itself up this little pond lily look where it comes from through dirt muck mud muddy waters dirty waters it pressed its way through all of that this little germ of life working itself from the bottom of the pond where the frogs and the things are at and then brings itself up through all of that but when it gets in the presence of the sun it's born the little seed bursts open into new life it cannot do that until it goes through all of that process it's got to come through that that's what it makes it is because what that the sun itself is what's drawing out drawing it and when it gets just remember that when you're coming through all the muck and the mire and just remember that you're only coming up and pushing through it because the sun is drawing you out god has been in your life god has been drawing you you didn't fix yourself god washed you from a baby can you say amen and the sun has been shining even when you were in the mud gideon didn't know what i was preaching on this morning but he saying he brought me out of the miry clay repeat of god he set my feet on a rock to stay my heart was distressed pain sorrow but he the sun was shining and you're drawing out of these things you're going to come out of it all it's got to come through the water that's what makes it because the sun itself is what's drawing it and when it gets fully above all the dirty waters and muck and so forth then it's so happy it just gives its life out freely and it's a beautiful life when it gets in the presence of that which is drawing it up some of you haven't hit there don't try to mechanically in your mind figure out who's who just put your life before the lord i wonder who brother paul is talking about i don't know who has the holy ghost who doesn't all i know if you keep yourself in the presence of the lord and you die to yourself he's going to give you everything that you need but i know in our assembly some are coming up through the mud you're coming up through praying some are learning that these things of life is not what you want to latch on to some young people are learning that it's not about a guy or girl it's about christ first and i'm going to keep loving you and i'm going to keep preaching to you and i'm going to keep teaching you and training you and pointing you to the word of god i'm not giving up on you but all of us are in different stages coming out of the muck in the mud if you keep growing you're going to come out and shine with the beauty of jesus christ i don't care what family situation you're in brother sister you're coming out of it can you say man you're coming out this word is a lot more powerful than paula fontaine could ever produce any kind of psychology or any kind of thing this word is going to bring you out hallelujah i think that's a beautiful type of the christian life when something is drawing you out of the world until one day you're born right into his presence by the holy spirit how beautiful how beautiful is that god's kingdom has pain and suffering that you go through until you get to a new life this world is under possibly its third birth pain it can't suffer another birth pain there's only going to be three this would be the final one and it's related to bombs this morning young people everybody listening this morning putin issues this might become atomic now he's never said that this morning he's getting angry this becomes atomic it could be the end of the ball game once you get that started it doesn't seem to be any into it i never preach these things to scare you but young people i do preach them and anyone that if your not heart is not anchored in the holy spirit all you need to do is find an altar this morning you see there's there's a there's a conviction and there's a fear i'm not scaring you hanging over hell but i'm telling you if this is the time don't wait don't wait to another sunday and just nod and walk out of here that's the thing we need friends you know you can become polished and you can have a nice church and you you know when when when he talked about the lily jesus said the lily a raid in all of its beauty see how it toils and brother brahm talked about so and so jesus talks about that literally he says he says but there's not one array that's beautiful even in the kingdom of solomon he compares it to the kingdom of solomon all the glory of his kingdom and he says the lily the psalmist king doesn't touch the beauty of this lily why because it's natural it pushed its way through god did it solomon basically was handed the king i'm not saying god didn't put him there but he was handed the kingdom he's kind of like the next generation he didn't have to fight for so much for it it was just handed to him that's the thing when you become with manufactured churches and manufacture things and the music becomes polished i believe we are doing our best but let me tell our musicians keep striving play skillfully but any of us whatever position you have whatever this church but there's one thing this pastor doesn't want that we've become so manufactured and so polished that we lose repentance conviction the moving of the holy ghost let your songs be anointed by the holy ghost let your hearts play that instrument such anointing it draws the presence of god we're not here to become another polish church and make sure everything's just perfect we're here that if we don't have repentance and you say well i already repented 20 years ago when i gave my heart to the lord hasn't somebody told you that we have to repent all the time we need an altar almost daily in our lives so don't you dare come here every sunday and just nod and say i'm okay the truth is we're not okay can you say man we always need more of god we always need more correction and the only way to change that is to repent we need repentance repentance brings the new millennium can you say amen this is not going to be a millennium brother brown says florida they're trying to create a millennium as a counterfeit to gods but this millennium will because there's people that repents and dies out to themselves none of us want a millennium without repentance you don't want a home you don't want possessions you don't want a business you don't want a big truck without repentance in your life it's a phony artificial life it isn't life at all it's empty without god in your life it's emptiness it means nothing i got a really nice truck but it means absolutely nothing this morning to me and i mean that praise the lord i parked it out front here way out front and tom i come in tom says are you abandoning that vehicle because tom would steal it if it was abandoned nothing if we don't have repentance so if we don't have altar if we then i don't want the young people or anyone to just leave and say i'm okay if god speaks to your heart and corrects something then just just set brother paul aside so i'm going to take that as from the lord and the next step say god i cry out to you please burn the things of the world out of my life take me lord this is almost wrapped up this is almost over you might not have another sunday to repent who are we to assume that we need an atmosphere of repentance that's when we have a millennium coming praise the lord god is good amen the lily solomon arrayed in all of his glory was not like one of these if we feel the pain of conviction sorrow repentance then i believe that there were the church that god can work with praise the lord the world is going through its final birth pains many believe that this may be the final birth pain on a daily basis we look and see those things the world is in its final birth pains the church goes through birth pains brother bram says when a new message was coming luther went through pains to bring the message and then wesley and then pentecost every time the church went through birth pains to bring forth new life and if you realize that the pain of dying out to your own desires because see the birth pains is in you individually too through pain through suffering through things that take us things we don't understand things that are hurtful to us things that where we suffer if we realize that the pain of dining out to our own desires and truly repenting and saying lord i'm done when we come to that it's going to bring forth god's life within us and that's when we say every bit of pain was worth it maybe it's embarrassment i'm embarrassed that the lord has exposed this in my life you'll get at the end of it say it was worse it was worth all the embarrassment people talked people said things other times we don't want people to know things and we try to and that's fine that's fine none of us like to be embarrassed but one day you're going to say this was worth all the embarrassment whatever man could say whatever man can do if it brings the end result it's worth all the pain worth all the trouble worth all the trials it will be worth it all when we see jesus he for the joy is on that cross enduring the pain taking a crown of thorns into his head pierced in the side spikes through his feet spikes through both hands suffering how did he do it he for the joy that was set before him he looked ahead in time he knew me yet he loved me he whose glory made the heavens shine so unworthy of seth's mercy when he was on the cross brother zimmerman i was on his mind you were on his mind get to a place we cross into that dimension and we'll we'll know it's every pain was worth it my story wasn't one that i would have picked wish i had a different one but god's predestinated trials led me to a greater joy this all ends very well saints i'm going to close this but i could go back into the text that says what manner of people should we be right now seeing all these things shall be dissolved things i like to me i like when the bible says things because it pretty much covers everything so you need to approach tomorrow morning in a real repentant heart in a soft heart before god but you need to have this approach seeing all these things the nice chairs the equipment the new piano the truck outside the home all these things shall be dissolved it'll be done it'll be gone it's all gonna burn brother donnie said one time said why would you want to make all that money and it eventually ends up in the hands of the catholic church anyway i think that was good why are you working so hard and they're going to get it all anyway the truth is when that's over all these things shall be dissolved so if we have that perspective looking for and hastening unto the new heavens and the new earth what manner of people are we to be in all holy conversation and manner of life i told the young people friday night i read the same scripture is that we don't need to have more unholiness and dirtiness in our life we need to be striving to say lord sanctify me we criticize and talk about holiness and standards and and dress and all that just quit quit complicating and just say lord make me holy before you make me separated in my mind in my spirit and in my dress let me manifest holiness why not to have an argument with you over what's appropriate no no because the coming of the lord is near it's not time to argue about that stuff it's time to be holy before the lord consecrated before the lord do we have time to debate about all these quotes no we have time to get in the filled with the holy ghost repented hearts created an atmosphere for the last elected seed to come in and our children to be saved that's the priority here can you say about it let me be ready for the coming of the lord what matter of person should we be in all holiness conversation and all these things looking to and hastening unto seeing all these things looking for it hazing under the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat i like the next one nevertheless we according to the promise that's the difference in us and the scoffers we according to the promise we're not trying to fix things we're not trying to ward it off we're not trying to come up with things to keep it from happening we're looking at the promise we're looking for a new heavens and a new earth we're in dwelleth righteousness if you're not looking for that you need to say lord correct me this morning you need his head i'm looking for one thing a new heavens and a new earth six visions have been fulfilled in 1933 prophet had six visions six of them been fulfilled gideon reminded me the other day we've watched all six the last one is america smoldering that's the word the senator used this morning what the word did he use he says if this goes into nuclear what was his name lindsey graham if this goes this direction he said there's going to be a scorching that's the word he used using the terms because they know once this goes it's a scorching and that's the last stream is america smoldering just the smoldering scorching nothing left of it by nuclear power finish gone and then i got a scripture in malachi 4 5 says the righteous will tread upon the ashes of the wicked because he's getting ready to birth a brand new heavens and a new earth for a millennium for his people let's stand together it will be worth it all i don't know if we have that song when we see jesus life's trials will seem so small when we seek all sorrow will erase [Music] so gladly run so glad bravely run this race until we see come on sing it now come on [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] i love that singing again [Music] when we see jesus [Music] oh thank you lord of history [Music] so bravely we pray together and become the psalter is open [Music] the ramp said the cry of the bride is she's wrong the generation says i'm right okay i can word this off i'm okay okay we don't want to have that attitude the cry of the bride is i'm wrong [Music] as many as i love i rebuke and chasten what's all that for to get us ready for the rapture [Music] i appeal to you this morning repent before god whether you do it in your seat or do it here i encourage you to a heart of repentance i don't want to see any of you left behind lay aside my human weakness and my my looks and see the lord maybe said something to you this morning many would raise your hand and say i i just want to be that group that the cry of the bride i want to be that group i'm wrong lord and you're right thank you and i mean that lord i mean that i'm wrong the more we get into revelation the more we realize we don't know anything only he knows god forgive me god make me ready let me lay down my pretenses and my selfishness and my self-focused way and lay down my hurts and pains i repent before you lord even pain even repentance is painful but lord i'll take that pain i want that pain because i want it to bring forth new life i pray for my heart lord for our young people that they experience the person of yourself lord i pray for them this morning lord that they have they would learn a life of repentance that that when they're exposed is wrong they would quickly repent before you i pray for the families the broken families that are broken up [Music] i pray lord that you step into the situations lord it's god that leads to repentance it's you lord that leads someone to repentance during this one moment of a broken heart you can begin to change family situations i pray for it lord in the broken homes lord i pray for husbands that they be men of god and step up and repen of their neglect of their families they step up and teach their families the word of god pray for these mothers and wives lord that you encourage them at the the standard they uphold of of holiness and the godly woman i pray you to encourage them lord strengthen them lord they will not be manufactured but they would be real and live before your life of repentance forgive us lord forgive us when we think wrong thoughts forgive us when we hold on to hurts forgive us lord when we be become so possession minded forgive us when we come so earthly lord that our minds are bought by earthly things forgive us father clean us of that lord and if this is true that these developments are something headed towards the final birth pain if it's true we only ask one thing that our hearts should be consumed with you and ready filled with the peace that passes all understanding lord may we not just be smothering over something that's missing in our hearts but anything that's missing lord would you please bring it to us as we repent before you forgive us clean us watch us make us holy before you lord what man or person should we be seeing all these things will be dissolved we look to you father and only you jesus name we're going to sing it again would you come
