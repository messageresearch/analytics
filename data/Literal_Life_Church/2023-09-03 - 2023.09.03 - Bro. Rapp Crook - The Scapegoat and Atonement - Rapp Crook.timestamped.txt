[30:19] please let me see
[30:26] [Music]
[30:36] amen God bless you all this morning
[30:38] welcome perhaps we can open our Bibles
[30:41] this morning to the Book of Leviticus
[30:44] chapter 23.
[30:48] with a beautiful atmosphere in the
[30:51] church this morning
[30:53] just to remind you that it doesn't
[30:56] depend upon us we're just grateful when
[30:58] a church service felt without the Lord's
[31:02] just a lecture that to be more or less
[31:04] dry depending upon the speaker but when
[31:07] the Lord's here we just pray that he can
[31:09] he does above and beyond but we can do
[31:11] ourselves
[31:14] this morning I want to take a look at
[31:17] one part of the Feast of atonement and
[31:21] that is the that is the scapegoat
[31:24] take a look here give me my settings
[31:25] right
[31:34] it looks like we're in business
[31:43] so we'll start off in the Book of
[31:45] Leviticus while we're standing
[31:47] chapter 23 and we'll start in verse
[31:51] verse 26. and the Lord spake unto Moses
[31:54] saying also on the tenth day of this
[31:57] seventh month there shall be a day of
[31:59] atonement it shall be a holy convocation
[32:02] to you and you shall afflict your souls
[32:04] and offer an offering made by fire unto
[32:08] the Lord
[32:09] and you shall do no work in that same
[32:12] day if it is a day of atonement to make
[32:14] an atonement for you before the Lord
[32:17] your God
[32:18] for whatsoever Soul it shall be that
[32:21] shall not be afflicted in that same day
[32:23] he shall be cut off from among his
[32:26] people
[32:27] and whatsoever Soul it be that doeth any
[32:30] work in that same day the same soul will
[32:32] I destroy from among his people you
[32:34] shall do no manner of work that shall be
[32:36] a statute forever throughout your
[32:38] generations and all your dwellings that
[32:40] shall be into a Sabbath of rest and you
[32:43] shall afflict your souls in the ninth
[32:44] day of the tenth month that even
[32:46] from even unto even shall ye celebrate
[32:48] your Sabbath
[32:50] so we'll take a look this is the we're
[32:52] in Leviticus 23 Moses goes over the
[32:55] feasts of the Lord and well this is the
[32:57] description that's given here about the
[32:59] day of atonement and we'll just try to
[33:00] look today
[33:01] um
[33:02] it will go back and another scripture it
[33:04] describes the offerings that are given
[33:06] and see how important this the scapegoat
[33:09] is for us perhaps we can just open the
[33:10] word of Prayer
[33:12] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[33:13] goodness and your grace to us Lord I
[33:15] Thank you that that you have drawn on
[33:18] our lives fooled us here this morning
[33:19] Lord because as uh the Apostle Paul
[33:22] reminds us no man can seek after God you
[33:25] are you initiate Lord you initiate that
[33:28] I just pray you would help us to hear to
[33:31] respond oh God and I pray Lord wherever
[33:33] there might be anything in our hearts
[33:35] father father that we that we've kept
[33:37] inside and trying trying to cover our
[33:40] own ways Lord may we just Lord throw our
[33:43] sins upon that scapegoat this morning oh
[33:45] God we may have real atonement the name
[33:47] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless
[33:49] you may be seated
[33:52] this from the reading we just took a
[33:55] look at from Leviticus 26
[33:57] I think a couple things we wanted to
[33:58] emphasize
[34:00] um how important it is to have atonement
[34:02] because if you just look at the word
[34:03] itself atonement is at one minute
[34:07] because we are where we're separated
[34:09] from God in our in our sinful condition
[34:11] we don't have that that uh that Oneness
[34:14] that we desire to have and you know how
[34:16] easy it can be to lose that Oneness I
[34:19] mean you can even have people in the
[34:21] same house sometimes
[34:22] Noah every now and then uh no my wife
[34:26] and I we can the best of buds for a
[34:28] while and every now and then there's
[34:29] those those times of friction that occur
[34:32] and you can be seated in the same car
[34:34] and you can be even patting her leg but
[34:37] you feel like you're patting a cactus
[34:38] and there's just and there's just no at
[34:42] one mint in in the car there and that
[34:45] can be how it is between us and the Lord
[34:48] sometimes so we're just kind of going
[34:50] through the motions and every time we
[34:52] raise our hands to try to we we know
[34:55] ourselves that there is no at one mint
[34:57] there and you know what in order for
[35:00] that atmosphere in the car to be uh to
[35:02] be uh to be changed
[35:04] um we tried to find this scapegoat in
[35:07] the modern sense of the word
[35:09] if you try to scapegoat it's not a one
[35:12] minute it's not going to be returned
[35:13] it's not gonna it's not gonna happen I
[35:16] want to take a look at this word the
[35:18] scapegoat because there's a way that
[35:19] it's used in the modern sense that is
[35:21] completely wrong and completely opposite
[35:23] to the biblical sense
[35:25] the word was uh the word was coined by
[35:28] uh
[35:29] um William Tyndale who translated the
[35:31] the Bible into English in the 1500s his
[35:34] vision was that the plowboy could be
[35:36] able to read God's word for himself and
[35:38] by reading it himself he would know more
[35:40] than any of the Catholic Bishops he
[35:42] wanted to put the Bible into everyday
[35:44] language his challenge was to take these
[35:47] Concepts that were in the Old Testament
[35:49] that were in the Hebrew Bible how could
[35:51] he
[35:52] how could he name this what was the
[35:55] right English translation the right
[35:57] concepts for this through this goat that
[35:58] we'll be reading about he he coined this
[36:00] word it's scapegoat
[36:02] and what we're going to look at
[36:04] according to Webster's the the scapegoat
[36:06] is a person or group that bears the
[36:08] blame for others and as long as my wife
[36:12] and I in the car are just bristling
[36:13] Cactus and porcupines at each other and
[36:15] I say it was somebody else's fault it
[36:17] was that person's fault that person's
[36:18] fault I'm seeking a scapegoat but that
[36:21] is not the way the Bible means that word
[36:24] to be used
[36:25] so to me it's when we look at the idea
[36:28] of scapegoat today
[36:30] there is a sense that that's inbred into
[36:33] us that even the modern man's day as
[36:36] hard as he tries to get away from any
[36:37] need for Calvary any need for Redemption
[36:40] there is still this idea someone does
[36:42] something wrong somebody has to pay I've
[36:45] got to find somebody so that I'm not the
[36:47] one
[36:48] so everybody's going to be trying to
[36:49] shifts the blame so that I'm not the one
[36:52] who has to pay
[36:54] so this idea of guilt and Punishment
[36:56] they lie deep in the hearts of men
[36:59] it's there and that's something we can
[37:01] use to uh to talk about the gospel of
[37:03] somebody because our hearts can testify
[37:06] against us our hearts testify that we
[37:08] need a redeemer
[37:09] and but the the idea the modern idea of
[37:13] Escape that has been so watered down
[37:15] that really we don't need a redeemer as
[37:17] long as we can find somebody else
[37:19] to blame it's shifting of Shifting of
[37:22] blame so we'll look at the Modern idea
[37:24] of the scapegoat for a little while and
[37:27] then we'll contrast it with what the
[37:29] Bible actually means by a scapegoat and
[37:32] there there is a dramatic difference
[37:35] but we when we look at Leviticus chapter
[37:37] 23 here it talks about
[37:41] um in verse 28 you shall do no work in
[37:43] the same day
[37:44] because you know what when we try to uh
[37:46] to make things right with our husbands
[37:48] or wives we can do our we can be on our
[37:51] best behavior do everything if they want
[37:52] but until the issue has been dealt with
[37:55] every single thing we do is only going
[37:58] to make it worse
[37:59] I can try I'm going to clean I'm gonna
[38:01] clean everything up sweeter I know
[38:03] you're mad at me I'm gonna do everything
[38:04] I can I'm gonna get this kitchen all
[38:06] cleaned up and she would rather I stop
[38:08] because everything I do to show how good
[38:10] I am only makes it worse
[38:14] and that's how this was the Lord too he
[38:15] says on this day of atonement don't do
[38:17] any work because you're doing it with
[38:19] the wrong heart and the longer we do
[38:22] good actions with wrong Hearts it's like
[38:25] trying to clean dishes with filthy rags
[38:27] because that's how our righteousness are
[38:30] he says no work other day ever told them
[38:33] because you can't atone for ourselves
[38:36] and that's something that we try to do
[38:38] so valiantly we want to atone for
[38:41] ourselves so that we don't have to say
[38:42] I'm sorry will you forgive me we try so
[38:46] hard but um he says it is a day you
[38:49] should do no work that day for the day
[38:52] of atonement to make an atonement for
[38:55] you
[38:57] we can't atone for ourselves atonement
[39:01] is made for us and it's it it's serious
[39:05] because if we're trying to atone for our
[39:07] own sins with our own actions trying to
[39:11] prove how good we are it says
[39:14] the soul that won't be doing this that
[39:16] won't be following God's directions just
[39:18] letting atonement be made for you it'll
[39:20] be cut off from among his people we have
[39:22] to accept God's atonement for us and
[39:26] atonement is made for us we cannot do
[39:28] that ourselves
[39:30] now if we go back uh it's in an
[39:32] interesting order here Leviticus 23
[39:34] describes the day of atoma in brief and
[39:38] we'll notice is on the uh I think the
[39:39] 10th day of the seventh month but now
[39:41] we're going to go back seven chapters to
[39:43] Leviticus 16 and we'll just see it's
[39:45] describing a particular detail of the
[39:48] feast verse 29 says this will be a
[39:50] statute forever unto you in the seventh
[39:53] month and the tenth day of the month
[39:54] that's the important date so we know
[39:56] that this is the feast that's being
[39:57] talked about the day of atonement you
[39:59] shall afflict your souls and do no work
[40:01] at all
[40:02] for on that day shall the priest make an
[40:05] atonement for you again we're not
[40:07] atoning for ourselves the priest makes
[40:09] us atonement for us
[40:11] so I want to take a look at some of the
[40:13] details that that are given in Leviticus
[40:15] chapter
[40:17] 16.
[40:21] I will start off in the in verse in
[40:24] verse 8. basically it will be a bullock
[40:27] that's going to be offered then the
[40:29] priests will also take two goats
[40:32] and the heir and the priest will cast
[40:34] lots upon the Two Goats one lot is for
[40:37] the Lord and that goat's going to be
[40:39] offered as a sacrifice and the other lot
[40:41] is for the scapegoat so one one goat's
[40:45] going to be killed right away offers a
[40:47] sacrifice the other goat
[40:49] it looks like he's escaping death
[40:52] but that's not where the idea of the
[40:54] scapegoat comes from this goat's not
[40:55] escaping that's not the idea
[40:58] he's just put off to the side
[41:01] um so Aaron is going to kill the first
[41:02] goat upon which the Lord's lot fell and
[41:05] he's going to offer the first go for a
[41:07] sin offering and then that first goat's
[41:10] blood will be taken with the Bullocks
[41:11] butt that was offered before and that
[41:13] blood is going to be going all the way
[41:15] through the through the outer Court
[41:17] through the inner Court the priest is
[41:19] going to be taking this this is the one
[41:21] day of the year the high priest can go
[41:23] into the into the Lord's presence and
[41:25] the holiest of the holies and he's
[41:27] taking this this goat's blood and this
[41:30] and the Bullock's blood and these
[41:32] anointing into toning for the sins of
[41:33] the people
[41:35] then he comes back and there's one goat
[41:38] Still Standing because the sins have
[41:40] been atoned for
[41:42] Fellowship has been restored between God
[41:44] and the people but the sins
[41:46] are still there in a sense something has
[41:49] to be done with them
[41:50] and then in verse 10
[41:53] but the goat on which the Lots fell to
[41:55] be the scapegoat
[41:57] shall be presented alive before the Lord
[42:00] to make atonement with him
[42:02] and to let him go for a scapegoat Into
[42:05] the Wilderness
[42:08] and here is we'll we'll look at it later
[42:10] but here the sins of the people be
[42:12] confessed over this goat and the
[42:15] scapegoat is carrying the sins of the
[42:18] people and to the Wilderness it's been a
[42:20] toned for it now the sins are being
[42:21] taken away all the way into the
[42:25] wilderness
[42:26] and verse said 22 talks about verse
[42:29] verse 21
[42:31] Aaron's laying his hands on upon the
[42:33] goat and he's going to send him away by
[42:34] the hand of a fit man Into the
[42:37] Wilderness and the Goat shall bear upon
[42:41] him all their iniquities and do a land
[42:44] not inhabit and he shall let the goat go
[42:46] into the wilderness
[42:49] and that's kind of the the background
[42:51] that we'll look at as we go further this
[42:54] morning
[42:56] but like I said the idea of of guilt the
[43:00] idea of punishment that's that's inbred
[43:03] into our hearts even modern man with a
[43:05] secretary and understanding we have to
[43:07] deal with with guilt guilt makes us feel
[43:09] uncomfortable and we have to find a
[43:12] scapegoat forest and I I always enjoy
[43:15] seeing where the word scapegoat comes up
[43:17] in the news because it's still a very
[43:19] active topic because I was looking this
[43:21] morning
[43:22] Auto thefts going on all over the
[43:24] country and three days ago Fox News
[43:26] highlights they wanted a scapegoat
[43:29] Americans are split on who's accountable
[43:31] for auto thefts the criminals or the car
[43:34] makers
[43:36] also now the cities who have a hard time
[43:38] getting enough police and allowing the
[43:40] police to do their jobs
[43:42] the crime waves going on and instead of
[43:44] blaming the criminals it's the car
[43:46] makers because they should make the cars
[43:48] more difficult to steal
[43:50] so the city is looking we have to find a
[43:52] scapegoat besides the criminals because
[43:54] if the criminals are the problem then
[43:56] the policing is the problem and that's
[43:58] an issue that we don't want to take care
[43:59] of so let's find a scapegoat
[44:02] then you've got uh
[44:04] my generation of this scapegoat for a
[44:07] male America's failures on The
[44:08] Huffington Post and this is each
[44:10] generation is comparing itself to the
[44:12] golden generation and yeah it's it's the
[44:15] uh it's the hippies fault it's the it's
[44:17] a Millennials fault because they're not
[44:19] good workers it's and everybody what's
[44:21] what's America's problem the youth today
[44:23] if they could just get some Backbone in
[44:25] them we're looking for a scapegoat
[44:28] and really
[44:29] um all the things that are being
[44:31] describing article like that it's just
[44:34] Sins not being dealt with that's why
[44:37] you're seeing so many problems in
[44:38] society today but we don't want to deal
[44:40] with that we want to shift the blame to
[44:41] one generation or the other and then in
[44:45] New Zealand uh yeah
[44:47] um having some economic difficulties
[44:48] we're going to blame the weather High
[44:50] Cost of Living looking for a scapegoat
[44:52] somewhere else so this idea of
[44:54] scapegoating it's uh it's not just
[44:56] Western even in the Hindustan times two
[45:00] days ago they're looking for a uh a a a
[45:03] a a scapegoat to account for some
[45:05] military difficulties the idea of Escape
[45:08] goes it's it's all over the place we're
[45:10] looking for some way to shift blame so
[45:13] that we don't have to bear
[45:15] responsibility for whatever problems are
[45:17] going on
[45:19] as I was studying I discovered a new
[45:21] tool that that Google has introduced
[45:23] Google Books you know they've they've
[45:25] scanned so many books into uh computers
[45:28] and now you can actually look to see the
[45:30] frequency of particular word use over
[45:32] time so I was curious has has the
[45:35] necessity or the idea of trying to find
[45:37] a scapegoat has that increased over time
[45:40] and it actually kind of has you can see
[45:43] like in the 1500s when Tyndale publishes
[45:46] his Bible he coins the word you've got
[45:48] to spike in how often scapegoat's being
[45:49] were heard in the 16th century is bibles
[45:52] are being printed those were the main
[45:53] books being printed then you see more
[45:55] scapegoating references
[45:58] but then it's interesting 1700s not too
[46:00] many references but then I don't know if
[46:03] there's this idea of wanting to shift
[46:04] responsibility people are taking less
[46:06] and less responsibility want to find a
[46:08] scapegoat more and more
[46:10] people want to find more scapegoats
[46:12] nowadays because we don't want to find
[46:13] we want to deal with a problem ourselves
[46:16] because really
[46:17] if you can find a scapegoat that's
[46:19] almost as good as a solution to your
[46:23] problem it's uh it's not that bad the
[46:26] secret to success in the corporate world
[46:28] is knowing who to blame that's a that's
[46:32] a big part of it
[46:34] um and I could remember when I worked in
[46:36] an office when I was in the Netherlands
[46:37] I I was part of a production process and
[46:40] when things go wrong in the production
[46:41] process fingers will be pointed pretty
[46:43] fast who dropped the ball where did it
[46:45] go wrong and I remember there's a big
[46:47] order that we were Printing and I the
[46:49] order got printed on the wrong thickness
[46:51] of material it was on a thicker material
[46:53] which is going to be more costly I
[46:54] remember when I heard about that the
[46:56] first thing I do is I dive into my email
[46:59] so I can prove that it wasn't my fault
[47:02] because we're going to be really quick
[47:04] to to protect ourselves
[47:07] tried to find that it was his fault it
[47:09] was their fault it was somebody else's
[47:10] fault we want to find that scapegoat
[47:14] we all want to avoid blame because we
[47:18] know the guilt if somebody's guilty you
[47:21] got to have payment that's and again
[47:23] that's just inbred into us our
[47:25] conscience knows if there's guilt it has
[47:28] to be paid for and that's just a
[47:30] testament that that we we need a
[47:32] redeemer there's something in us that
[47:34] longs through a redeemer and the Feast
[47:37] of atonement says don't try to make
[47:39] atonement for yourself
[47:41] God provided that atonement
[47:44] another one to air is human but to blame
[47:47] it on someone else
[47:49] that's going to be the next manager
[47:52] this is human nature find that this is
[47:55] the modern idea of a scapegoat the
[47:58] moderative Escape is point that finger
[47:59] it's their fault their fault their fault
[48:01] and if you can keep yourself clean
[48:03] you could be the next promoted one
[48:06] now examples of the we see lots of
[48:08] examples of the uh of the modern
[48:10] scapegoat
[48:12] um
[48:13] where does the blame usually get pushed
[48:17] and if
[48:19] you go back to the first uh it didn't
[48:22] take long Adam Leaf weren't even out of
[48:24] Eden and they were already trying to
[48:25] find scapegoats
[48:28] um
[48:29] neither Adam nor Eve admitted their sin
[48:31] they weren't open about it they searched
[48:33] immediately for a scapegoat someone else
[48:35] whom they could blame so they would have
[48:38] a better chance of being declared
[48:39] innocent and who do we often try to
[48:41] place the blame on yeah
[48:43] the dog ate my homework right or the
[48:47] devil made me do it according to Mark
[48:48] Twain God is the most popular scapegoat
[48:51] for our sins God made me do it if he'd
[48:54] wanted to stop me he he could have and
[48:57] we could blame our background uh this
[48:59] and this happened that's the way I am
[49:01] and and I can't change and and that can
[49:04] certainly be something that contributes
[49:05] to where we are today but we also bear
[49:08] responsibility for what we do today
[49:10] because God always makes a way of Escape
[49:12] so that we can so that we can change the
[49:15] weekends so we can break cycle so yes my
[49:17] background accounts for things that's
[49:19] not an excuse to continue on the way I
[49:22] am
[49:23] Adam said the woman you gave me Eve said
[49:25] the man you gave me my parents my
[49:28] friends we we were quick to point a
[49:30] finger at all of these different and all
[49:32] these different ones
[49:35] one of the most well-known examples of
[49:39] scapegoating throughout history
[49:42] um goes back to the Great Chicago Fire
[49:46] and this one I'm going to tell the story
[49:48] about uh I don't know did anybody else
[49:51] learn a song about Mrs O'Leary in
[49:53] elementary school late one night when we
[49:56] were all in bed
[49:57] Mrs O'Leary took her Lantern to her shed
[50:00] a cow kicked it over and winked her eye
[50:04] and said it'll be a hot time in the old
[50:06] town tonight
[50:08] Mrs O'Leary this Irish immigrant in the
[50:11] city of Chicago
[50:13] and there's this huge conflagration that
[50:16] destroyed as much of the inner city
[50:18] she got blamed really fast
[50:23] this was a great conflagration October
[50:27] 8th to 10th in 1871 about 300 people
[50:30] were killed
[50:32] about three and a half square miles of
[50:34] the city were destroyed a hundred
[50:37] thousand residents left homeless
[50:40] this is huge the fire begins around nine
[50:43] o'clock in the evening on October 8th in
[50:46] or next to a small shed that belonged to
[50:49] the O'Leary family
[50:51] the fire department once they heard
[50:53] about it responded quickly but due to a
[50:56] mistake of the night Watchman the fire
[50:59] department got sent to the wrong address
[51:03] giving a small fire time to grow into
[51:06] this great conflagration
[51:08] there was a mistake somewhere on the
[51:11] part of the city Administration
[51:13] but the focus was finding a scapegoat
[51:17] and uh yeah nobody liked the Irish
[51:21] so they served as a good one
[51:24] the exact cause of the fire has never
[51:27] been completely determined but at that
[51:29] time speculation grew quickly according
[51:31] to one journalist
[51:33] it all started around 8 30 1 in one of
[51:35] the Stalls of Mrs O'Leary's Barn where
[51:38] she had carelessly forgotten her Lantern
[51:40] and in the night as the story goes as
[51:43] the song goes her cow kicked the lantern
[51:46] over
[51:47] so it was easy to blame Mrs O'Leary
[51:49] because she was Catholic she was Irish
[51:52] and the journalist story spread like
[51:54] wildfire
[51:56] because people were quite willing to
[51:58] believe it and even in the the in this
[52:01] journalist stories I mean she was
[52:03] depicted as this as this hag as all
[52:06] these negative words that are just
[52:08] they're going to be it was it was a
[52:10] piece to to sell
[52:13] so the scapegoat's been found
[52:17] and Shifting the blame very conveniently
[52:20] but we're going to see on this years can
[52:24] tick by and as hard as we want to remove
[52:27] blame from the guilty blame has a way of
[52:32] always coming back
[52:35] and we'll see this this story is
[52:37] interesting 22 years afterwards in 1893
[52:43] this journalist
[52:45] whose story sold like wildfire fire he
[52:49] admitted that he had made it up
[52:52] 22 years later
[52:55] he couldn't live with it
[52:56] hidden away he's hidden in the way it
[52:59] had been he'd made it up to have a
[53:02] sensational story to sell
[53:04] and that those 22 years they were
[53:07] terrible for the O'Leary family they
[53:09] moved from one side of Chicago to Other
[53:12] Side of Chicago they moved to Michigan
[53:14] they moved back because they were being
[53:16] hounded by the press all the time being
[53:18] blamed for look hundred thousand people
[53:21] lost their homes 300 people died because
[53:24] of your stupid cow the stupid Irish and
[53:28] that just people were willing to believe
[53:29] it and they just built
[53:32] but the question was so the journalist
[53:34] admits that I made it up who really
[53:36] started the fire everyone still pointed
[53:39] to Mrs O'Leary because it did happen in
[53:42] or near her Barn that was a fact and for
[53:45] her entire life she was hounded by
[53:47] journalists who wanted to write about
[53:49] the fire
[53:50] well in 1944 and the fire was 1871 in
[53:56] 1944 73 years later
[54:00] we can try to shift blame for a long
[54:03] time we can try to hide sin for a long
[54:06] time but it's not going to work
[54:09] 73 years later
[54:13] a man named Louis Cohn admitted that the
[54:17] fire that he was there when the fire
[54:20] started and Mrs O'Leary's shed he was
[54:23] there were some buddies playing cards
[54:27] and Mrs O'Leary came out to chase the
[54:30] boys away and as he gets up to take the
[54:33] take the gambling Kitty with him as he
[54:35] gets up he kicks the lantern over by
[54:38] accident and that's what started it
[54:41] 73 years later and then
[54:46] in 1997
[54:49] 126 years after the fact this is still
[54:52] going on the Chicago city council
[54:54] declares Mrs O'Leary completely innocent
[54:56] based upon historical research
[54:59] I think this is really a neat story just
[55:01] because it shows we can try to blame
[55:03] somebody we can try to shift it shift it
[55:05] shift it but guilt has a way of always
[55:08] coming back to the correct party we can
[55:12] try to find the scapegoat and
[55:14] scapegoating today is try to shift blame
[55:17] shift blame shift blame but if blame is
[55:20] never connected to the guilt
[55:23] it's gonna be like two magnets you can
[55:25] try to keep those two magnets away from
[55:27] each other but blame is going to come
[55:28] back at a certain time that's just a
[55:32] principle of the Lord
[55:34] so the the modern concept of the
[55:37] scapegoat emphasizes blame or guilt
[55:41] instead of sin
[55:44] it's all about Shifting the blame in the
[55:47] modern conception of a scapegoat it's
[55:50] shifting blame
[55:51] but the the biblical perception of the
[55:54] Gate of the Escape group couldn't be
[55:56] further from that it's completely
[55:58] opposite the biblical perception of the
[56:01] escape code doesn't talk about the blame
[56:03] it's not a blame goat it's a sin goat
[56:08] in the modern society deals with the
[56:11] blame tries to move out of the way so we
[56:13] don't have to deal with sin but the
[56:15] Bible says hey don't worry about the
[56:17] blame let's deal with the sin it's
[56:20] called a it's called the sin go and
[56:22] guilt blame and sin Belong Together
[56:26] the guilt blamements and you can you can
[56:29] try as hard as you want to separate them
[56:31] but you will never succeed in shifting
[56:34] your sin over to somebody else
[56:36] it might temporarily to make somebody
[56:39] else is getting blamed but if there's a
[56:40] sin issue their guilt will always come
[56:44] back to the sin that bore it
[56:46] always we we we cannot separate the two
[56:51] so the scapegoat modern perception is
[56:55] it's you it's you it's you it's you it's
[56:57] the pointing finger but numbers reminds
[57:00] us
[57:01] be sure your sin will find you out we
[57:05] can't separate
[57:07] our blame and our and our guilt it's
[57:10] going to work like a uh like a boomerang
[57:13] that Boomerang I think out of the
[57:15] Australian Outback you can use it to
[57:16] hunt if you throw it right and it'll
[57:18] come right back to you it's going to
[57:21] come it's going to come right back and
[57:23] this is what happens you want to happen
[57:25] when you're hunting
[57:26] but when you're using when you're trying
[57:28] to find a scapegoat and you're not
[57:30] dealing with sin you're shifting blame
[57:31] it's that Boomerang you're gonna try to
[57:34] get somebody else that's going to come
[57:36] come come come back it'll come right
[57:38] back to you
[57:39] that's how that scapegoat works
[57:45] uh David
[57:49] a man after God's Own Heart but he sure
[57:52] messed up big innocent with Bathsheba
[57:57] he does his best to shift the blame for
[58:02] the baby that Bathsheba is is carrying
[58:04] he invites Uriah I was talking about
[58:07] this in Bible classes last week I mean
[58:10] if you think about what David did he and
[58:12] Uriah had been through a lot together
[58:15] they'd Had Each Other's backs on the
[58:17] field they'd been through thick and thin
[58:19] together and then
[58:20] you're not just stealing somebody's why
[58:22] if you're stealing you're one of your
[58:24] best friends
[58:26] wife and David did this
[58:30] and so he gets he gets Bathsheba
[58:32] pregnant and then he
[58:34] sends off Messengers to to joab so that
[58:38] Uriah can come back to Jerusalem so that
[58:40] David can make it look like this baby is
[58:43] Urias he's trying to do everything he
[58:45] can to shift the blame
[58:48] for the baby to shift the responsibility
[58:50] for the baby to Uriah
[58:52] but Uriah he he had no party he didn't
[58:57] play alone he did he didn't even go down
[59:00] to his house I'm on duty King I'm going
[59:02] to stay right on your doorstep I'm not
[59:03] going to go to home
[59:05] so David ends up having Uriah killed
[59:09] and then I just imagined David
[59:13] because Nathan how long does he bear
[59:16] this
[59:18] he Bears this sin of lust the sin of
[59:23] adultery the sin of murder he Bears this
[59:27] for months
[59:29] and he's this whole time he still has
[59:32] this responsibility of being Israel's
[59:35] king of being Israel's song leader he
[59:38] still has to maintain the the image of
[59:41] going to church and every time he takes
[59:43] his harp and tries to praise God
[59:46] his thoughts condemn him terribly
[59:50] and I when you just when you when you
[59:53] place yourself in his shoes I mean he
[59:56] had been
[59:57] he he was Tangled in the web of his own
[1:00:00] making
[1:00:01] he he the more that he tries to get out
[1:00:04] of it the more he gets caught that's why
[1:00:07] the Bible tells us we can't atone for
[1:00:10] ourselves because when we try to atone
[1:00:11] for ourselves we're just getting
[1:00:13] ourselves caught up even more in sin we
[1:00:16] can't do it
[1:00:18] so I just think about David here as
[1:00:21] someone who's who's got to he's trying
[1:00:23] to bear his own sin trying to trying to
[1:00:27] trying to be king trying to be a worship
[1:00:29] leader and he just feels terrible on the
[1:00:31] inside
[1:00:32] and
[1:00:35] knowing what he knew having been through
[1:00:37] that he can write a Psalm like this
[1:00:39] blessed to see whose transgression Is
[1:00:41] Forgiven
[1:00:43] whose sin is covered
[1:00:47] it doesn't say blessed is he
[1:00:50] who has covered his sin
[1:00:52] it doesn't say that because David knew
[1:00:55] all about covering his own sin and he
[1:00:57] was not blessed he had every kind of
[1:01:00] problematic he was fighting all kinds of
[1:01:03] mental battles everything because he was
[1:01:05] trying to cover his own sin and it
[1:01:08] wasn't working but blessed is he whose
[1:01:10] transgression is Forgiven oh to know the
[1:01:13] Forgiveness of Christ that we are
[1:01:15] completely our sins are separated from
[1:01:19] us as far as the East is from the West
[1:01:21] bless is the man to whom the Lord
[1:01:23] imputeth not iniquity and whose spirit
[1:01:26] is no guile
[1:01:28] then verse 3 I think describes
[1:01:31] someone who's been carrying their own
[1:01:33] sin for so long when I kept silence
[1:01:36] I covered it up my bones waxed old
[1:01:40] through my roaring all the day long his
[1:01:43] heart his conscience is screaming at him
[1:01:47] and he does everything he can just to
[1:01:49] keep his mouth shut because he doesn't
[1:01:50] know what he's going to say if if he
[1:01:52] opens it he's going through that he's
[1:01:54] going through anguish
[1:01:56] because he's trying to cover his own
[1:01:57] sins we're not made to cover sins we
[1:02:01] were made to live in Eden we were made
[1:02:03] to live in a perfect environment but
[1:02:05] then through the fall we're carrying
[1:02:07] these things that we were never created
[1:02:10] to carry
[1:02:11] but God I mean it was I mean God through
[1:02:14] his his Mercy provides an atonement
[1:02:18] he provides a way of Escape so that we
[1:02:21] don't have to carry that anymore
[1:02:24] for day and night thy hand was Heavy
[1:02:26] upon me my moisture is turned into the
[1:02:28] drought of Summer he couldn't even cry
[1:02:31] anymore
[1:02:32] he'd cried every tear he could but as
[1:02:34] long as he's just keeping it inside
[1:02:38] it doesn't produce anything the good cry
[1:02:39] didn't help
[1:02:41] but finally I acknowledged my sin unto
[1:02:46] thee and David said finally I stopped
[1:02:48] doing this I stopped pointing to this
[1:02:50] person or that person finally I said
[1:02:53] Lord
[1:02:54] it's me
[1:02:56] finally I acknowledge my sin to thee my
[1:03:00] iniquity have I not hid
[1:03:03] for a long time David tried to cover his
[1:03:06] own sin tried to find the scapegoat here
[1:03:09] there wherever but finally he
[1:03:11] acknowledged his sin he confesses that
[1:03:13] not his transgressions to the Lord
[1:03:16] and thou forgavest the iniquity of my
[1:03:20] sin
[1:03:21] think about that meditate about that we
[1:03:24] can be sometimes so reluctant so
[1:03:28] hesitant to confess something to the
[1:03:31] Lord
[1:03:32] I can remember when I was I was probably
[1:03:34] my between job or Lynn's age and I was
[1:03:38] my brother and I were playing down the
[1:03:39] basement of our house
[1:03:41] and I can remember something happened
[1:03:44] and the leg of an end table in one
[1:03:47] corner of the basement I'll put in the
[1:03:49] passive voice
[1:03:50] got broken
[1:03:52] yes when the politicians make apologies
[1:03:54] they say mistakes were made
[1:03:58] they don't say I may I I goofed enough
[1:04:00] but somehow the leg of the table got
[1:04:03] broken and I was just angry because now
[1:04:08] we're going to tell Mom and Dad about
[1:04:09] this and you can be so you you try to
[1:04:13] it's just terrible but then when you
[1:04:15] finally go back to ah Mom Dad
[1:04:18] we broke the leg we did it we're sorry
[1:04:21] and sometimes the thing that we're most
[1:04:23] afraid of the vindictiveness of daddy
[1:04:26] rips off his belt no that didn't happen
[1:04:28] that didn't happen we can be so afraid
[1:04:31] of that we could be so afraid if we
[1:04:33] confess our sins to God what's God going
[1:04:34] to do it's gonna be like this Pagan God
[1:04:36] who throws a thunderbolt no no God has
[1:04:40] compassion for our condition
[1:04:42] David finally acknowledges his sin he
[1:04:45] stops the show of covering it up
[1:04:47] and thou forgavest the iniquity of my
[1:04:51] sin
[1:04:52] we can try to cover it up as much as we
[1:04:54] want to but sin is going to be dealt
[1:04:57] with first Timothy 5 24 says some men
[1:05:00] sins are open beforehand going before to
[1:05:04] judgment and some men they follow after
[1:05:06] but either way the sins come because
[1:05:10] sin and blame guilt they belong together
[1:05:15] and I want my sins blame and guilt to
[1:05:17] come together now so I can deal with
[1:05:20] them now before God I don't want them
[1:05:22] following after
[1:05:26] I'm going to talk for a few minutes
[1:05:28] about what happens with this biblical
[1:05:32] scapegoat
[1:05:35] so we could we have the idea that you
[1:05:38] have these these like we shared before
[1:05:39] we have these two goats and uh have they
[1:05:43] both come forward and there's a uh
[1:05:45] there's a lot that's drawn so we can I
[1:05:48] know what they did they flip a coin
[1:05:50] whatever but there's a lot drawn and one
[1:05:52] goat's going to become the uh the
[1:05:55] sacrifice who's killed immediately and
[1:05:57] then after that there's another goat who
[1:05:58] becomes the escape goat and um
[1:06:03] I need a escape goat
[1:06:07] Marcus would you be a scapegoat this
[1:06:09] morning
[1:06:11] wonderful wonderful I need a good escape
[1:06:14] goat
[1:06:18] so this the scapegoat Marcus has just
[1:06:21] seen the others the other goat being
[1:06:24] killed right before his eyes I mean his
[1:06:27] as as the priest goes and kills this
[1:06:29] goat I mean the blood might be
[1:06:31] spattering upon Marcus upon the
[1:06:33] scapegoat and he's just wondering what
[1:06:34] is going to happen next this is this is
[1:06:38] a scary thing and at first
[1:06:41] um when Marcus sees the first goat being
[1:06:44] killed and everybody leaves Marcus like
[1:06:48] everything's fine
[1:06:51] but then the guy comes back the priest
[1:06:53] comes back and the marker starts getting
[1:06:55] nervous because maybe everything's not
[1:06:58] fine
[1:06:59] because what happens now
[1:07:01] priest takes this scapegoat
[1:07:04] and
[1:07:05] he prays over the scapegoat and
[1:07:08] Leviticus 16 22 tell us what happens or
[1:07:11] 1621 Aaron shall lay both his hands upon
[1:07:15] the head of the live goat and confess
[1:07:18] over him all the iniquities of the
[1:07:20] children of Israel
[1:07:21] and all their sins
[1:07:24] and all their transgressions in all
[1:07:25] their sins putting them upon the head of
[1:07:29] the goat and will send them away by the
[1:07:31] hand of a fit man Into the Wilderness I
[1:07:34] just always wondered me
[1:07:36] a little innocent lamb like this and the
[1:07:38] and the imagery of a priest putting his
[1:07:40] hands upon him and notice when I put
[1:07:42] when the priest put his hands on the
[1:07:44] goat he's not doing this
[1:07:46] because this is the modern idea of what
[1:07:48] scapegoating is finding blame
[1:07:51] but what the biblical idea is we were
[1:07:54] with open hands
[1:07:55] it's me who did it I'm the one who's in
[1:07:58] need of prayer and with Open Hands I put
[1:08:01] I'm the priest is transferring all of
[1:08:04] the sins
[1:08:06] upon this animal and I just have to
[1:08:09] wonder this is an animal who never knew
[1:08:12] guilt for anything this is an ant an
[1:08:14] animal can't do all these sins and I
[1:08:17] just have to wonder what must that
[1:08:19] animal have felt as the priest is
[1:08:22] confessing the transgressions the
[1:08:24] iniquities and he's naming them I just
[1:08:26] wonder what goes on in the animals
[1:08:29] body because all that's happening
[1:08:32] he's confessing confessing confessing
[1:08:34] it's all transferred over to the goat
[1:08:39] and then
[1:08:41] the Bible says the priest summons a fit
[1:08:44] man
[1:08:46] he doesn't someone somebody who's
[1:08:48] who's been the couch potato all year
[1:08:50] long he summons a fit man and that's
[1:08:53] important because this next job this
[1:08:56] goat
[1:08:57] who is now carrying all the he's feeling
[1:08:59] things he's never felt before he's being
[1:09:01] taken by this man into an uninhabited
[1:09:05] place of the wilderness
[1:09:07] this goat is leaving all the things that
[1:09:10] he's used to
[1:09:11] he's leaving the Comforts of hope he's
[1:09:14] leaving the Tabernacle areas leaving the
[1:09:16] camp of Israel and he's got to be taken
[1:09:18] out into the
[1:09:20] A wilderness place
[1:09:22] where there are lions and tigers and
[1:09:25] bears everything that makes him feel
[1:09:28] really scared
[1:09:30] so the fit man why does the Bible say a
[1:09:33] fit man instead of just any man
[1:09:35] well it's not going to be easy if you've
[1:09:38] got an animal that doesn't feel real
[1:09:40] safe he wants to stick with you
[1:09:43] it's going to be hard to leave him in
[1:09:46] the wilderness so that I'm going long
[1:09:47] I'm taking Marcus Into the Wilderness
[1:09:50] and I'm taking them taking and said now
[1:09:52] you just go you just go but Marcus he's
[1:09:54] scared
[1:09:55] so he turns around he tries to come back
[1:09:57] I said no I'm supposed to leave you in
[1:10:00] the wilderness you got to go get going
[1:10:02] bud but he gets scared again and he
[1:10:05] comes back his bad bad bad and I'm
[1:10:08] really upset because I've got supper
[1:10:10] waiting on me at home I'm sick and tired
[1:10:12] of this I said you get to go I'm going
[1:10:13] to throw you in the wilderness get out
[1:10:15] of here and then he comes back again
[1:10:19] I've got I I can't come back to the camp
[1:10:23] with this goat because this goat is
[1:10:26] carrying everybody's sins if this goat
[1:10:29] comes back the sins are still with us
[1:10:31] we're not atoned for I've got to get
[1:10:33] this go completely gone so I just I'm
[1:10:36] mad at the goat I do everything I can I
[1:10:39] get rocks I get Stones get out of here
[1:10:41] yell get out get out of you stupid go
[1:10:43] get out and finally he's so afraid of me
[1:10:46] he just runs crying all the way back to
[1:10:49] his parents thank you Marcus
[1:10:57] it was a very difficult task
[1:11:00] take that go into the Wilderness and
[1:11:02] make sure he stayed there that's why the
[1:11:05] Bible says a fit man
[1:11:08] had to do that because it could be a
[1:11:10] long process
[1:11:12] a night a hint that it might have been a
[1:11:14] really hard and difficult process
[1:11:16] is seeing how that tradition changed
[1:11:19] over time
[1:11:22] because you know what you do the last
[1:11:23] thing you want if I've taken this school
[1:11:25] out into the wilderness
[1:11:27] finally get back
[1:11:30] I'm lying in bed at night
[1:11:35] I don't want that happening I do not
[1:11:39] want that goat to be back because those
[1:11:42] sins have to be gone
[1:11:45] that's the picture of the scapegoat he's
[1:11:47] carrying the sins out into the
[1:11:49] Wilderness and it's that fit man's job
[1:11:52] to make sure they never get back
[1:11:55] that this was hard so we can see how
[1:11:58] this tradition changed in Jesus's time
[1:12:01] at that time you could look in the the I
[1:12:04] think the the inishna at that point they
[1:12:06] didn't take the goat Into the Wilderness
[1:12:08] they took the goat up to a high cliff
[1:12:10] and just pushed it over
[1:12:12] because that was much easier to take
[1:12:15] care of the problem because it was
[1:12:17] really hard to keep that goat from not
[1:12:20] coming back but the sins had to be gone
[1:12:26] but first of can we see that there is a
[1:12:28] difference between the modern blame goat
[1:12:32] and the biblical scapegoat
[1:12:35] because when I'm looking to blame
[1:12:37] somebody all I'm looking for is that
[1:12:39] email that shows I said the right thing
[1:12:41] you had to do
[1:12:42] that I'm just you're the one at part
[1:12:45] but the scapegoat the biblical sin goat
[1:12:49] you're going with Open Hands into your
[1:12:52] confessing Lord
[1:12:53] it's me
[1:12:55] I have done wrong all the iniquities the
[1:12:58] the children of Israel are confessing we
[1:13:00] are the guilty ones
[1:13:02] that was the reason of the day of atoma
[1:13:04] so they could afflict their souls and
[1:13:06] see where where my left give the Holy
[1:13:08] Spirit a chance Lord if there's
[1:13:11] something I need to make right let me
[1:13:12] make it right so like I I I can do this
[1:13:15] but the biblical scapegoat
[1:13:17] is a single where you're open all the
[1:13:20] iniquities of the children of Israel
[1:13:22] their own righteousnesses are being
[1:13:24] acknowledged all their transgressions
[1:13:26] aggressions the steps across God's law
[1:13:28] that may have been small at first it
[1:13:31] were still steps in the wrong path these
[1:13:33] things had to be acknowledged all their
[1:13:35] sins the end results of the wrong steps
[1:13:38] all these things
[1:13:40] because man's sin and God's holiness
[1:13:43] couldn't exist
[1:13:44] that's why these sins had to be taken
[1:13:47] out of the camp
[1:13:49] we can't have both sin and God's
[1:13:52] holiness it's one or the other
[1:13:56] now
[1:13:58] once in the desert
[1:14:02] this uh
[1:14:04] this goats well this goat wasn't like a
[1:14:07] dog or a cat who always tended to find
[1:14:09] its way home that was the point because
[1:14:11] the goat didn't have a vagabond's
[1:14:13] existence in the wilderness
[1:14:15] generally we have a very short existence
[1:14:18] because the Lions or Tigers of bears the
[1:14:21] Predators would make easy prey of this
[1:14:24] goat he would likely be torn to pieces
[1:14:26] that first night
[1:14:28] and he would be torn to pieces and more
[1:14:30] importantly all the sins that the goat
[1:14:34] bore
[1:14:35] would be destroyed as well and that was
[1:14:39] the point
[1:14:40] that was the point that's what it's all
[1:14:42] about the scent of the Israelites were
[1:14:44] transferred over to the goats and he
[1:14:46] carried them into the desert where they
[1:14:48] could be destroyed and after that the
[1:14:50] sins no longer existed
[1:14:53] they were gone they were completely
[1:14:56] dealt with an accuser who could come
[1:14:58] back and and hire his private
[1:15:00] investigators try to find evidence for
[1:15:02] the crime but he could find no evidence
[1:15:04] because all the evidence had been
[1:15:06] destroyed
[1:15:09] there was no longer evidence of a crime
[1:15:11] the sin itself
[1:15:13] had been destroyed
[1:15:14] and we know that in the Old Testament
[1:15:16] this is a picture
[1:15:19] of what Jesus Christ does for us
[1:15:23] and and that picture is valuable
[1:15:26] Jesus Christ
[1:15:27] he is
[1:15:29] our scapegoat
[1:15:31] and we know that we're talking goat I
[1:15:34] thought Jesus Christ was the Lamb of God
[1:15:36] he was and the Redemption is such a such
[1:15:40] a beautiful all-encompassing thing it
[1:15:42] can be it'll be symbolized in multiple
[1:15:45] ways
[1:15:46] yeah I could find it here but um I think
[1:15:49] this is an interesting statement from
[1:15:51] Brother Branham
[1:15:52] he says we were goats
[1:15:56] yeah sometimes we have a pretty goatee
[1:15:58] nature but he became goat for us he
[1:16:02] became sin for us that's the reason he
[1:16:05] had to be punished the way he was
[1:16:07] because all of our sins were placed on
[1:16:10] him
[1:16:13] thank you
[1:16:16] and then when he died on the day of his
[1:16:19] death they took him down there off the
[1:16:21] cross and they put him in the grave and
[1:16:22] he laid there from Friday afternoon till
[1:16:24] Sunday morning on that wonderful Easter
[1:16:27] morning when he arose again and his soul
[1:16:29] was loosened from the prisons of hell
[1:16:32] down yany where he went as a sinner for
[1:16:34] you and I bearing our sins to give us a
[1:16:38] perfect Assurance he Jesus the the
[1:16:42] Wilderness in the Old Testament where
[1:16:44] that goat was led was a picture of hell
[1:16:47] and because hell was was created to
[1:16:50] destroy and Jesus was sent there but
[1:16:53] hell did not destroy Jesus
[1:16:56] the sins were destroyed but hell was not
[1:16:59] destroyed he went there bearing away our
[1:17:02] sins to give us a perfect assurance
[1:17:05] and you can imagine this fit man who
[1:17:08] takes to go into the Wilderness and if
[1:17:09] he hears a bleeding goat in the middle
[1:17:11] of the night he has no perfect Assurance
[1:17:13] because the sins aren't gone
[1:17:16] but if he has if that goat never comes
[1:17:20] back if he never hears those things
[1:17:21] again he has an assurance he can wake up
[1:17:24] next morning my sins are gone I've got
[1:17:26] I've been my sin has been atoned I could
[1:17:28] once again have fellowship with God and
[1:17:30] that's the kind of assurance that we can
[1:17:33] have
[1:17:34] Jesus Christ Resurrection shows that his
[1:17:38] his sacrifice was sufficient he went and
[1:17:43] the sins were destroyed but he was not
[1:17:46] he lived to tell the tale
[1:17:50] and because he did that
[1:17:56] his soul was cast into hell because he
[1:17:58] was a Castaway he was The Escape of the
[1:18:00] Old Testament they put the sins of the
[1:18:02] people upon the scapegoat turned him out
[1:18:04] into a Wilderness to die Jesus was that
[1:18:08] scapegoat
[1:18:10] who had the sins of the people upon him
[1:18:11] he was cast away went and held or
[1:18:13] suffered the tortures his body went into
[1:18:16] the grave to pay the price of our
[1:18:19] Resurrection
[1:18:20] Jesus took our sins he bore them out of
[1:18:24] the city
[1:18:25] he was abandoned by all the disciples he
[1:18:29] was left alone to suffer just like that
[1:18:31] goat left alone completely to suffer
[1:18:34] Jesus he was abusively treated mocked
[1:18:38] just like I had to abusively treat
[1:18:40] Marcus yell at him kick him sorry bud
[1:18:43] throw things at him and finally that
[1:18:46] goat got the point that this isn't a
[1:18:47] safe place to be I'd rather be out there
[1:18:49] Jesus was abusively treated mocked
[1:18:52] scourged just like that goat who was
[1:18:55] taken out into the wilderness
[1:18:57] and Jesus truly went into the Wilderness
[1:19:00] he went into hell and just like Samson
[1:19:03] was persecuted by the Philistines Jesus
[1:19:05] Christ was tormented by the Devils but
[1:19:09] they couldn't keep him there just kind
[1:19:11] of like the like the Hebrew boys who
[1:19:13] went into the fiery furnace the only
[1:19:15] thing that furnace did was destroy the
[1:19:17] ropes when Jesus goes into hell the only
[1:19:20] thing hell did was destroy the sin
[1:19:23] it couldn't destroy him it couldn't
[1:19:25] touch him
[1:19:27] his sinless body suffered and died and
[1:19:30] all the sins that jesus carried were
[1:19:33] also destroyed
[1:19:35] and that he is resurrected and shows
[1:19:37] that it was accepted
[1:19:40] so for us today we could say yeah I
[1:19:42] don't want to carry my own sin I don't
[1:19:45] want to cover my sins I don't want to
[1:19:47] excuse my sins I don't want to find
[1:19:50] somebody else to blame for my sins
[1:19:53] only thing that we can do is confess
[1:19:55] them
[1:19:56] to Jesus and let that scapegoat that the
[1:19:59] true scapegoat carry them into the
[1:20:02] wilderness
[1:20:05] that go to the Old Testament bore upon
[1:20:07] him all their iniquities unto a land not
[1:20:10] inhabited
[1:20:12] just like Jesus Christ surely he hath
[1:20:15] borne our griefs he hath carried our
[1:20:17] sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken
[1:20:20] smitten of God and Afflicted he was
[1:20:24] wounded for our transgressions he was
[1:20:27] bruised for our iniquities the
[1:20:30] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:20:32] with his stripes we are healed
[1:20:35] both the lamb and the Goat provide this
[1:20:38] picture
[1:20:39] and then what happens to those sins in
[1:20:41] those days saith the Lord the iniquity
[1:20:43] of Israel shall be sought for
[1:20:46] and there shall be none
[1:20:50] and the sins of Judah they shall not be
[1:20:54] found
[1:20:56] for I will pardon them whom I reserve
[1:21:00] the look for the sin but they won't be
[1:21:02] able to be found
[1:21:04] and I was uh I've I've I think I've
[1:21:06] shared before that was asked a question
[1:21:07] one time why is the Old Testament so
[1:21:10] much longer than the New Testament
[1:21:13] and one reason is uh yeah the Old
[1:21:15] Testament gives much more detail about a
[1:21:18] person's life the New Testament does it
[1:21:20] gives ups and the Downs The Faults the
[1:21:22] warts all those things it gives us those
[1:21:24] things
[1:21:25] but the funny thing happened to Matthew
[1:21:27] 28 Jesus says this cup is the New
[1:21:29] Testament in my blood which is remission
[1:21:32] of sins
[1:21:33] and all those things that I just kind of
[1:21:36] Imagine for myself the Old Testament
[1:21:39] Saints like the dragon almost like a
[1:21:41] ball and chain for their experience
[1:21:43] because they know the things they did
[1:21:45] wrong and they know it's yeah it's
[1:21:48] sacrificed what they they it's still
[1:21:51] there and they're dragging us along and
[1:21:53] you if we would hired to ask you do a
[1:21:55] memory Association exercise we were to
[1:21:57] think of David or some some of the
[1:21:59] things we'd think of we might think
[1:22:00] right away of Goliath somebody might
[1:22:02] think of Bathsheba because those things
[1:22:04] are associated people think of Samson
[1:22:07] where you think a lot of negative
[1:22:09] association that are connected with him
[1:22:10] right away
[1:22:12] if you think of Gideon you might think
[1:22:14] about that timid young man who is
[1:22:15] fearful to obey God right away there are
[1:22:18] things that can be that we can make that
[1:22:19] connection all those negative things
[1:22:22] that can be connected with us and we
[1:22:23] look at ourselves in the mirror
[1:22:25] what might we think of right away
[1:22:28] might not be God's thought about us but
[1:22:30] all those things are connected in the
[1:22:32] Old Testament Saints they're dragging
[1:22:34] these things and then all of a sudden
[1:22:35] there's this Blood Veil and they can be
[1:22:38] dragging it through though then once
[1:22:39] Jesus offers himself as a sacrifice for
[1:22:42] sin is Old Testament States staff that
[1:22:45] blood Veil and the sins gone they can
[1:22:47] worship they've got peace they've got
[1:22:49] rest they can go into God's presence any
[1:22:52] time they want to
[1:22:54] in the Old Testament only the high
[1:22:56] priest only once a year could go
[1:22:58] directly into God's presence with this
[1:22:59] elaborate ceremony was followed but once
[1:23:02] we've stepped through the New Testament
[1:23:04] of God's blood those connections the
[1:23:06] devil might try to make those
[1:23:08] connections again those associations
[1:23:09] with things we did in the past here
[1:23:11] there but no they're gone because
[1:23:13] Revelation 1 5 talks about how Jesus
[1:23:16] Christ hath loosed us from our sins in
[1:23:18] his own blood the connection between us
[1:23:20] and the sin is broken by the blood of
[1:23:23] Jesus Christ so there can be search made
[1:23:26] for the sins
[1:23:28] but they will not be found because they
[1:23:31] have been atoned for
[1:23:40] God always makes a way of Escape
[1:23:43] every time
[1:23:46] and brother Graham talks about the
[1:23:47] message making a way he says God makes a
[1:23:50] way of Escape every time he says
[1:23:51] sickness continue into corner
[1:23:53] Satan pins you down to a place after you
[1:23:55] become a Christian
[1:23:57] maybe he says maybe you've been a
[1:23:58] gambler you see he says the cards are on
[1:24:00] the table come on John you know what's
[1:24:01] in you Satan is it attempt you to go
[1:24:03] back
[1:24:04] but God in every time he will make a way
[1:24:06] of Escape if you'll accept it
[1:24:09] the sins are gone the devil wants to
[1:24:11] lure you back into him but we have that
[1:24:14] way of Escape still today
[1:24:17] message lying dying buried Rising coming
[1:24:21] brother Graham says he was he was also
[1:24:23] buried in this they have this sin
[1:24:25] offering at the cleansing of the
[1:24:26] sanctuary and that sent off and they
[1:24:27] took the Two Goats one goat was killed
[1:24:29] the other goat had the sins that was
[1:24:30] placed from the dead goat put in the
[1:24:32] live goat he says remember Jesus was a
[1:24:36] sheep he was a lamb but in this case he
[1:24:38] became a goat he was righteous because
[1:24:40] he was God the Sheep
[1:24:43] but he also became a goat a sin that he
[1:24:45] might be that sin offering for me for me
[1:24:48] and you from a sheep to the goat I just
[1:24:51] think that's a that that's a wonderful
[1:24:53] thing why does he do that so that we can
[1:24:57] be free that we can have at one minute
[1:25:00] atonement Union again with him
[1:25:04] but the banham says that person's got a
[1:25:06] right to be free he's talking about
[1:25:08] somebody who might come with him and be
[1:25:10] bound and possessed he's I looked at
[1:25:12] Calvary I know that Jesus Christ paid
[1:25:14] the price
[1:25:15] he did it there that person's got a
[1:25:17] right to be free Satan can't hold them
[1:25:19] any longer and if you could get them to
[1:25:21] see not their aches or their pains or
[1:25:23] some preacher praying for them or some
[1:25:25] holy church that's all right that goes
[1:25:27] with it but the main thing is to see
[1:25:29] what Christ did for you
[1:25:32] you're free and to me that's the point
[1:25:35] of the service this morning is to see
[1:25:39] somewhat dramatically what did Christ do
[1:25:41] for me
[1:25:43] he took my sins he took my iniquities he
[1:25:45] took my he bore them all upon himself
[1:25:48] and he carried them away so the
[1:25:51] association between me and my sin to be
[1:25:53] broken completely and he gave me his
[1:25:57] righteousness so I am associated with
[1:25:59] everything that is then good wonderful
[1:26:03] righteous it's imputed to me
[1:26:07] it's almost like somebody who were to
[1:26:09] have a uh
[1:26:11] um who would who have made lots of
[1:26:13] terrible financial decisions but then
[1:26:15] she gets married
[1:26:17] and she marries a guy with really good
[1:26:19] credit
[1:26:20] all of a sudden his credit is in a sense
[1:26:23] imputed to her she can enjoy things that
[1:26:25] she never would have been able to do on
[1:26:27] her own because his credit is being
[1:26:29] imputed to her that's what happens when
[1:26:31] Christ righteousness is imputed to us
[1:26:35] he says brother said how could I be
[1:26:37] saved get rid of sin as long as we're
[1:26:40] doing this
[1:26:41] we're trying to get rid of sin our own
[1:26:44] way but the day ever told me I said
[1:26:47] anybody who does any work
[1:26:49] it'll be a curse we can't atone for
[1:26:51] ourselves is how can I be saved get rid
[1:26:54] of sin he was the sin offering for me so
[1:26:57] he died now if sin is if sin is dead
[1:27:00] then bury it he carried my sins far away
[1:27:03] he was a scapegoat that went out and the
[1:27:05] scapegoat took the sins of the people on
[1:27:07] him went into the Wilderness to die go
[1:27:10] out there took the sins of the people
[1:27:11] took them far away so did Jesus he took
[1:27:15] the sins of the people carried them far
[1:27:17] away so that he put them in the sea of
[1:27:19] God's forgiveness if sin is dead
[1:27:23] then bury it
[1:27:26] when we come to the altar in a way of
[1:27:29] repentance we're saying Lord forgive me
[1:27:30] forgive me for my sin I confess that I'm
[1:27:34] unable to do anything that pleases you
[1:27:36] ah the best thing I do on my best days
[1:27:39] are our filthiness compared to your
[1:27:41] righteousness I confess that forgive me
[1:27:43] Lord and then God does something he he
[1:27:47] he he he kills that that uh that that
[1:27:50] that that that that carnal man
[1:27:52] then he says but if if if if it's dead
[1:27:55] bury it
[1:27:57] and that's the that's the next step in
[1:27:59] Romans 6 the Apostle Paul talks about
[1:28:02] baptism baptism is is a picture of
[1:28:07] bearing you you take somebody you bury
[1:28:10] them and you leave everything that was
[1:28:12] dead in the water and then just like
[1:28:14] Christ was buried he's also resurrected
[1:28:16] in New Life
[1:28:19] and that's that's that that's that is
[1:28:21] the picture
[1:28:22] who want to be delivered so one half
[1:28:25] want to die to sin get rid of sin
[1:28:30] one last uh statement before we uh
[1:28:33] before we close musicians can come
[1:28:36] but uh
[1:28:37] it's a it's a it's a simple thing
[1:28:41] when we try to atone for ourselves we
[1:28:44] saw the quote from Sir Walter Scott what
[1:28:46] a tangled web we weave when first we
[1:28:48] practice to deceive when we try to atone
[1:28:50] for ourselves things get complicated
[1:28:53] but when we accept the atonement of
[1:28:55] Christ it's a beautifully gracefully
[1:28:58] simple atonement
[1:29:00] and the message sir is we would see
[1:29:02] Jesus brother I don't care if you don't
[1:29:03] even know your ABCs the only thing you
[1:29:06] have to have is a humble submitted heart
[1:29:09] to God and God will work his will
[1:29:12] through you
[1:29:14] that's what he's looking for someone who
[1:29:16] is like a child
[1:29:18] such as we'll learn
[1:29:20] you don't have to know a whole lot
[1:29:23] you only have to know one person that's
[1:29:26] the Lord Jesus to know him is life
[1:29:29] that's the only person you have to know
[1:29:31] to have eternal life to know him not
[1:29:33] know the book nor the Creeds but know
[1:29:35] him now him as your personal savior no
[1:29:38] him is the understood you with his
[1:29:39] goodness and mercy that sent the world
[1:29:41] away from you discharge you sent it away
[1:29:44] like the scapegoat in the Old Testament
[1:29:46] to go into the Wilderness and to be
[1:29:48] killed to be no more
[1:29:51] and the very thing that made you sin and
[1:29:54] do the things that that you used to do
[1:29:56] has been driven from you by his Precious
[1:29:59] Blood that sanctifies you that sets you
[1:30:01] aside for his service that he might will
[1:30:04] his will through us to work through us
[1:30:05] it's just that simple
[1:30:09] God gave us his best when he gives us a
[1:30:12] scapegoat
[1:30:13] and that's the picture today we don't
[1:30:15] want to tone for ourselves we don't want
[1:30:17] to take this modern blame goat idea if
[1:30:19] we're always trying to shift the blame
[1:30:20] we want a real scapegoat and God wants
[1:30:24] to deal with the real issue
[1:30:26] I'm the one
[1:30:27] Forgive Me Lord
[1:30:29] let's pray
[1:30:31] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[1:30:33] goodness and your grace and I thank you
[1:30:36] for these pictures in the Old Testament
[1:30:37] that can sometimes or dramatize it make
[1:30:40] it so
[1:30:42] so plain
[1:30:44] what you did when you went to Calvary
[1:30:47] when you were
[1:30:48] when you were forsaken by your disciples
[1:30:51] just like that goat was forsaken in the
[1:30:53] wilderness and
[1:30:54] Lord you who knew no sin the sin of the
[1:30:58] world was transferred upon your
[1:31:00] shoulders
[1:31:02] Lord that
[1:31:03] when I do something wrong and my
[1:31:05] conscience bothers me well that can be
[1:31:07] just a terrible thing like David
[1:31:08] described as roaring within us all day
[1:31:10] long our bones can shake it seems like
[1:31:13] and how much more that must have been
[1:31:15] for you who had never known a guilty a
[1:31:18] guilty feeling like that because you
[1:31:21] hadn't sinned that you took all that on
[1:31:22] the cross for us thank you Lord
[1:31:26] and father I pray that Lord if we
[1:31:30] see today Lord It's Your Holy Spirit
[1:31:32] might search in our hearts if there are
[1:31:33] places where we see yes I've been
[1:31:35] playing a Blame Game and I've been
[1:31:37] covering sin or pushing sin away Lord
[1:31:40] help us to stop that
[1:31:42] help us to stop weaving that tangled web
[1:31:44] and just go with open Palms like the
[1:31:47] high priest did as they forgive me Lord
[1:31:50] forgive me my transgressions my
[1:31:52] iniquities all my sins that we might
[1:31:55] know our sins are gone completely gone
[1:32:00] Lord I pray that you would be with each
[1:32:03] each boy and girl Lord each teenager
[1:32:05] each Mom and Dad Lord father how easily
[1:32:08] the devil tries to get into our lives I
[1:32:10] pray oh God if there's places where
[1:32:12] we've covered up sin whether we could do
[1:32:15] house cleaning and get it out and let
[1:32:17] that be taken from us oh God
[1:32:19] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ

[1:40:12] twice at the old-time altar where God
[1:40:16] came in my heart and now
[1:40:19] my Saints are gone
[1:40:23] the Lord took full possession the devil
[1:40:27] did depart and glad
[1:40:30] my Saints are gone
[1:40:34] they're underneath the blood out the
[1:40:37] cross of Calvary as far removed darkness
[1:40:42] is from down
[1:40:45] name a sea of gods forgetfulness that's
[1:40:48] good enough for me praise God
[1:40:52] my Saints are gone
[1:40:56] when Satan comes to tempt me and tries
[1:41:00] to make me doubt I say
[1:41:03] my sins are gone

[1:41:11] out and glad

[1:41:50] my soul is filled with music with all my
[1:41:55] heart I say I know
[1:41:58] my scenes are gone
[1:42:01] they're underneath the blood of the
[1:42:05] Cross of Calvary as far remove as
[1:42:09] darkness is from dawn
[1:42:11] in the sea of God's forgetfulness that's
[1:42:15] good enough for me praise God my sins
[1:42:20] are gone
[1:42:22] [Music]
[1:42:24] amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:42:28] thank you for the rap thank you so much
[1:42:31] um you guys don't know this this sermon
[1:42:34] is Timely
[1:42:35] amen God doesn't want anything to stand
[1:42:37] up to us on him we just want us to let
[1:42:40] go and may you make mistakes you've done
[1:42:43] something wrong you know and that guilt
[1:42:45] is always there
[1:42:46] because you're a child of God
[1:42:48] and every time we do something around
[1:42:50] the Holy Ghost just sticks his flight on
[1:42:53] to correct that wrong
[1:42:55] and all his accents just come back to
[1:42:57] the altar again
[1:42:59] and what a brother said is just timely
[1:43:01] until David add that unto David you know
[1:43:04] made his life right with beer things
[1:43:08] were not right in his heart down his
[1:43:10] heart it was just losing it and for
[1:43:13] unbelievers it's nothing they can do
[1:43:15] whatever they want to do and they'll
[1:43:16] feel no guilt but because we're God's
[1:43:17] children it will bother us condemn us
[1:43:19] inside us and when it comes like that I
[1:43:22] think we should just let go I'm gonna
[1:43:24] talk about just you I'm talking about me
[1:43:25] too I'm included so because the devil
[1:43:29] knows one thing
[1:43:30] if he can't destroy you it won't destroy
[1:43:32] the work
[1:43:34] the the fruits of your life
[1:43:36] and all I can do is just put that same
[1:43:38] for you all the time like Bible says
[1:43:39] then like is the accuser of the Brethren
[1:43:41] it will always accuse you of your wrong
[1:43:43] but the moment you can step forth in
[1:43:45] faith
[1:43:46] and bold and Sam bring whatever is
[1:43:48] standing between you and the Lord and
[1:43:49] bring to the Lord he said it's just an
[1:43:51] able to do what to forgive all not just
[1:43:55] some all of our sins so going back again

[1:44:00] believe God spoke to this man today amen
