[0:00] second chapter
[0:02] and we're gonna read from second chapter
[0:05] in
[0:07] verse one through three
[0:10] the book of habakkuk second chapter
[0:14] so
[0:16] whenever you have you can say Amen or we
[0:18] have it on the screen amen so it says I
[0:21] will stand upon my watch and not and set
[0:24] me upon the tower and I will watch to
[0:26] see what he will say unto me
[0:30] in what I shall answer when I am
[0:32] reproved
[0:35] here we see that habakkuk is looking for
[0:38] an answer and amen so when you have an
[0:40] answer the Lord will always come and
[0:42] give you answers amen so in the Lord
[0:44] answer me and said right
[0:48] right division
[0:50] and make it plain upon tables
[0:53] that's that he may run that breed at it
[0:57] for division is yet for an appointed
[1:00] time but at the end it shall speak and
[1:03] not lie though it will tarry but he is
[1:07] saying the Lord is saying wait
[1:10] for it wait for it because he will
[1:14] surely come he will not tarry amen you
[1:18] may have your seat
[1:20] now in the Amplified verse the second
[1:23] verse and the third verse it says and
[1:26] the Lord answered me and said write the
[1:28] vision and engrave it so so plainly upon
[1:30] tablets that everyone who passes by will
[1:33] be able to read it that it will be easy
[1:36] and quickly as he Hastings a Hastings by
[1:40] and then it says for the vision is yet
[1:43] for an appointed time and and it
[1:45] Hastings to the end so it will be a
[1:47] fulfillment of that Vision it will not
[1:50] deceive or disappoint in other words you
[1:53] will never be disappointed with the Lord
[1:55] it says Solitaire wait for it because it
[1:59] will surely come it will not be behind
[2:02] or it will not be behind hand on its
[2:06] appointed day so in other words there is
[2:09] an appointed day for your vision to come
[2:12] to fulfillment
[2:14] amen so now in the book of uh
[2:17] Corinthians second Corinthians chapter 3
[2:21] uh verses uh 2 through 11.
[2:25] we're gonna read there and it says ER
[2:27] our Epistles written in our hearts known
[2:32] and read of all man
[2:36] for as much as year manifestly declared
[2:38] to be the Epistle of Christ Minister by
[2:41] US Written not with ink but with the
[2:44] spirit of the Living God not in tables
[2:47] of a stone but in fleshy
[2:50] tables of the heart so you see the Lord
[2:54] is changing these Sensations in the past
[2:57] it was given to Moses it was up in the
[3:00] mountain but now the Lord is saying but
[3:03] now these these uh gospel is is coming
[3:06] in a different form
[3:08] amen so and and as such have we uh
[3:12] through Christ to go to go work and not
[3:16] that we are sufficient of ourselves
[3:18] Amen to think anything as of ourselves
[3:23] but our sufficiency is of God
[3:28] we depend on God this morning amen who
[3:30] also made us able ministers for the New
[3:33] Testament not of the letter
[3:36] but of the spirit for the letter kileth
[3:39] but the spirit giveth life
[3:42] but if the administration of death
[3:45] greeting and Engraving in the stones was
[3:48] glorious so that the children of Israel
[3:51] could not steadfastly behold the face of
[3:54] Moses for the glory of his countenance
[3:57] which which Glory was to be done away so
[4:00] now he he the Apostle Paul is talking
[4:03] you know there there there was a
[4:05] Ministry in Moses that when they saw it
[4:09] they couldn't behold his face amen and
[4:12] he's talking about a fleshy Ministry or
[4:15] or a a natural Ministry during the life
[4:17] of Moses but now he's switching he's
[4:20] saying like how shall not the
[4:22] ministration of the spirit be rather
[4:27] glorious
[4:28] so now he's switching the dispensation
[4:30] is going from Moses is going out to
[4:34] Jesus
[4:36] and it is not staying there because now
[4:38] he's saying that we are being made able
[4:41] ministers and then it says for if the
[4:44] ministration of condemnation be glory
[4:47] much more does the administration of
[4:50] righteousness and it doesn't only come
[4:53] in glory either seeds in glory
[4:57] for even that which was made glorious
[5:00] had no glory and disrespect by the
[5:02] reason of the glory that excellent for
[5:05] for if that which is done away was
[5:07] glorious much more that which remaineth
[5:11] is glorious
[5:13] much more the gospel that you have
[5:16] received is glorious
[5:19] and not as Moses which put a veil on
[5:21] over his face that the children of
[5:24] Israel could not steadfastly look to the
[5:26] end of that which is abolished but their
[5:29] minds were blind for until this day
[5:32] remaineth the same Veil taken away in
[5:36] the reading of the Old Testament they
[5:37] have to put something on them when they
[5:39] read the the Scrolls
[5:41] which Veil but now Paul is saying that
[5:45] this Veil is going to be done away this
[5:48] Veil needs to be removed and and he was
[5:52] amen
[5:53] so if now the veil is removed now what's
[5:56] going to happen
[5:59] nevertheless when it shall turn when
[6:01] they when each Soul turned to the Lord
[6:03] the veil shall be taken away
[6:07] now
[6:08] it is moving now the Lord is that spirit
[6:12] that spirit that was with Moses now the
[6:16] Lord is that spirit and where the spirit
[6:19] of the Lord is
[6:22] there is Liberty
[6:24] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[6:26] Liberty where the spirit of the Lord is
[6:29] there is healing amen where the spirit
[6:31] of the Lord is there there is freedom
[6:34] there is restoration there is a change
[6:36] of heart
[6:38] but we all with open face beholding
[6:41] beholding us in a glass the glory of the
[6:44] Lord are changed into the same uh the
[6:48] same image from glory to glory even us
[6:52] and look at this it is not your work it
[6:56] is not your works it is no it is not how
[6:59] much you come to church or how you dress
[7:01] or or how you talk is by the spirit of
[7:05] the Lord You're gonna be changing from
[7:07] glory to glory
[7:09] isn't that beautiful this morning that
[7:12] is not your work it is is not the the
[7:15] death works that we can have but it's by
[7:18] the spirit of the Lord in our lives
[7:21] amen so what I want to catch from from
[7:24] this scripture is is talking that you
[7:28] are written Epistles written in our
[7:30] hearts and we read here that there is a
[7:32] vision so this morning by God's grace we
[7:35] can title this right according to the
[7:38] vision right according to the vision
[7:42] and then as a subject we can say that
[7:45] tablets of your heart
[7:48] and the tablets of your heart you know
[7:51] the Lord was the first one that created
[7:52] the tablet say man there with Moses that
[7:55] he went to the mountain and then there
[7:57] were some tablets there right he wrote
[7:59] the Ten Commandments and we think that
[8:01] that's a new thing no the Lord knew him
[8:04] amen but now he's going from something
[8:08] natural to something deeper in our lives
[8:12] amen so we can we if we can start this
[8:15] asking that question so when we talk
[8:18] about a vision what are we referring
[8:21] when we are talking about a vision the
[8:23] prophet of God says what is a vision and
[8:25] he says a vision is the forecast of
[8:28] future events it foretells the thing
[8:32] before it happens amen and that's the
[8:35] way God always
[8:37] has been indicated it whether something
[8:41] is true or not amen because somebody can
[8:43] say you know I have a vision something
[8:45] is going to happen then it doesn't
[8:46] happen then you know why can't they say
[8:49] well that's not a true prophet
[8:51] a man but by God's grace a vision the
[8:54] Lord is going to show a person something
[8:56] and then that's going to happen but I'm
[8:58] gonna I'm gonna I want to go beyond that
[9:00] the Lord showing something to a person I
[9:02] want to tell you that there is already a
[9:04] written Vision that whenever you get as
[9:07] close as possible to that to that you're
[9:09] gonna see the Lord and where is that
[9:12] Vision that's in his word
[9:14] amen so now if we look here we see
[9:17] habakkuk he was complaining if you have
[9:20] read the book of have a cook he was
[9:22] complaining to the Lord and he was Lord
[9:26] I need an answer you know he went to
[9:28] learn he's like he was a he was seeking
[9:31] for an answer about the things that the
[9:33] children of Israel were going through
[9:35] you know time of Oppression time of
[9:37] distress for the people so have a cook
[9:40] needed an answer
[9:43] but and then the Lord comes and answers
[9:45] Hema and as we can see but he shows him
[9:48] a vision and then he is required he's
[9:51] like you are required to write it in the
[9:54] tablets of of in in tablets so that
[9:57] everyone who passes they will see the
[10:00] vision and they will know that every
[10:02] time they will see the vision it will be
[10:05] a reminder to them that the Lord has
[10:08] promised something
[10:09] amen so we see the beginning in our when
[10:12] you read your scriptures your Bible you
[10:14] see the beginning it was the fall amen
[10:17] and even and there was the fall there
[10:20] and then you read it in the middle of
[10:21] the Bible and there was Jesus when he
[10:23] came amen and then at the end of the of
[10:26] the Bible then we see that we won
[10:30] that's why the importance to go back and
[10:33] read the vision so you will know now the
[10:36] havocs of this day they can go back and
[10:39] read the vision and then say they can
[10:41] say Lord you are that my healer you are
[10:44] the kind that kind of healeth all my
[10:46] diseases you are my restorer You Are My
[10:49] Redeemer you're everything to me but you
[10:52] have to go in the vision
[10:58] the Lord is also telling him that even
[11:00] though he is seeing a vision it is for a
[11:03] specific time
[11:04] you know how many times we get impatient
[11:06] Lord I've been praying for this I've
[11:08] been praying for this and I don't get it
[11:10] well keep waiting
[11:12] and the more you you're asking the Lord
[11:14] about it the more you're gonna wait
[11:16] why don't you just you know go as we say
[11:18] go with the flow and just write with the
[11:20] Lord and say Lord I'm just gonna wait
[11:22] for what for your timing
[11:25] because what happened it may have not
[11:27] been for his day but he's telling him do
[11:30] not worry don't worry have a cook it is
[11:33] the sir the Lord and and if if it is
[11:36] thus said the Lord he will come to pass
[11:40] or we sometimes like have a cook and we
[11:44] feel entitled to request an answer from
[11:46] the Lord for the matters of our heart
[11:49] and I'm gonna tell you the Lord has an
[11:51] answer for all our matters however he's
[11:55] telling us wait for it
[11:58] don't step out of your position like
[12:01] like you know as we have many many of us
[12:03] have heard
[12:04] the vision that the prophet of God saw
[12:06] and then there was kind of the different
[12:09] nations walking you know the the
[12:11] different uh the brides from every
[12:14] country and then there was a time that
[12:16] some of them started going away
[12:18] amen but then the prophet of God says
[12:21] but I I and I was telling them don't
[12:23] step out of light in other words Johnny
[12:26] step out of the vision amen many people
[12:29] are are stepping out of their Vision but
[12:32] I I want to invite you to this this
[12:34] morning stay in line with the word and
[12:38] stay in in Your Vision that the Lord has
[12:40] given you
[12:43] there is only one way that we can be
[12:45] aware of the decision he has for us and
[12:48] is the closer we get to the Lord the
[12:51] more we are on his word the more he will
[12:54] open his vision to us
[12:58] the more we match our experience
[13:01] experience to his word the more we will
[13:04] hear from heaven
[13:07] if you are sick the more you're in the
[13:09] world the more you're gonna read that
[13:11] he's your healer
[13:12] if you're lonely the more you are in the
[13:16] world you're gonna hear that he is your
[13:19] friend
[13:20] but if you're gonna spend time with the
[13:22] word in the word don't expect the Lord
[13:24] to come and be close to you he will come
[13:27] but he was gonna it is gonna be hard
[13:28] there it is better for you to always
[13:30] stay in the word
[13:33] the prophet of God says this is a
[13:35] matching time you know that's true it is
[13:39] a matching time that that then that's
[13:42] right listen that is true now I'm going
[13:44] to tell you my brother I don't care
[13:46] whether my shoes match my my pants or my
[13:49] pants matches my coat I want my
[13:53] experience to match God's Bible
[13:56] I don't wanna I don't want God to fit to
[14:00] my vision I don't want God to fit to my
[14:03] schedule I want to feed to the god of
[14:06] the Bible
[14:08] these the prophet of God says that is
[14:10] the marching time if you want to match
[14:13] something match your experience against
[14:15] Paul's experience
[14:18] that's what we need today it is a
[14:21] matching time with Paul's faith in the
[14:23] Bible that's our example right real
[14:26] matching matching time don't try to
[14:29] match your your experience with your
[14:31] neighbors
[14:32] it won't work
[14:34] don't compare yourself with with your
[14:36] with your neighbor next next to you
[14:38] because it won't work you are unique in
[14:41] the sight of the Lord
[14:44] amen it says the prophet of God says if
[14:48] you are a saint act like that like a
[14:50] saint
[14:51] walk like a saint
[14:54] dressed like a saint
[14:56] talk like a saint break like a saint
[15:00] believe like a saint dress like a saint
[15:04] be like a saint leave a saint like and
[15:09] die like a saint and go to heaven like a
[15:12] saint
[15:13] amen this is matching time and now in
[15:18] the Book of Proverbs chapter 7 verse 1
[15:21] it says my son
[15:24] keep my words
[15:26] lay up within you my Commandments
[15:29] and treasure them
[15:31] keep my Commandments verse two of uh
[15:34] Proverbs 7 2 it says keep my
[15:37] Commandments and leave and keep my law
[15:40] in teaching us the apple of your eye
[15:43] bind them on your fingers and then write
[15:47] them on the tablet
[15:49] of your heart
[15:51] what is the Lord telling us in this
[15:52] scripture that in our hearts there are
[15:55] tablets where he can write
[15:58] it goes beyond something written in
[16:00] natural material but it goes beyond that
[16:03] to write his vision now he wants to
[16:06] write it in your heart
[16:09] and as we read in the in our opening a
[16:11] scripture but with the spirit of the
[16:14] Living God is not in the tables of a
[16:16] stone but in fleshy table of tables of
[16:19] the heart
[16:20] that's why he needs to change our hearts
[16:23] as Ezekiel said Ezekiel said in in
[16:26] Ezekiel 36 26 it says a new heart also
[16:30] will I give you so you see how beautiful
[16:34] he is walking with the Lord that he is
[16:36] not gonna ask you for something that he
[16:38] is not gonna provide
[16:40] isn't that beautiful that he's telling
[16:42] you I want to write in in the in in the
[16:44] tablets of your heart he's gonna give
[16:46] you a new heart
[16:47] she's gonna give you a blank a tablet
[16:50] and he's gonna say now I want to write
[16:52] write my word in that heart
[16:55] but he will not give you only a new
[16:58] heart but he also will give you a new a
[17:00] new spirit will I put within you Ezekiel
[17:03] 36 26 and it says and I will take away
[17:07] the stunning heart of your flesh in in
[17:10] other words it's sunny you know your
[17:12] ideas I will take take away your
[17:14] Revelations on what you think what God
[17:17] is
[17:18] and then he says and I will give you a
[17:21] new heart and I will give you a heart of
[17:24] Flesh in other words when you have a
[17:27] heart of Flesh he's a heart that is
[17:29] gonna feel
[17:30] he said isn't that beautiful that when
[17:33] you come to church you can feel his
[17:35] presence and then it's like you can
[17:37] thank the Lord because now you don't
[17:40] have a stunning heart that now you're
[17:42] tender to when he is speaking to you now
[17:45] you can say thank you Lord because now
[17:47] you have changed my heart
[17:49] but you see this scripture is very very
[17:52] particular because in verse 27 it says I
[17:55] will give you a spirit
[17:57] I will give you one spirit
[17:59] I I will will I put a new spirit within
[18:03] you
[18:04] but then in verse 27 and he says and I
[18:07] will put my spirit within you in other
[18:10] words First Alert comes and then changes
[18:12] your spirit and then he he and then he
[18:15] comes and brings a spirit that is going
[18:18] to be able to match to his spirit
[18:21] and and I will put my spirit within you
[18:25] and cause you to walk in my statues and
[18:29] ye shall keep my judgments and do him
[18:32] why I love these scriptures that we're
[18:35] going to be reading today why because
[18:36] the Lord is always I will do it the
[18:38] first person he's always the Lord doing
[18:41] the work he is not sending somebody else
[18:43] but he's always saying I will put my
[18:46] spirit I will change your heart I will
[18:49] remove your Stony heart I will remove
[18:52] your all ideas you're all crazy you're
[18:56] all thinking and I will put a new heart
[18:59] I will put my spirit but then I will put
[19:02] my spirit
[19:06] send that beautiful the Lord doing the
[19:08] work that's why you don't have to trust
[19:10] you know the Bible says some some trust
[19:13] in chariots some trust in in their
[19:16] properties what they have but who do we
[19:19] trust in this to this morning we trust
[19:22] in the name of the Lord
[19:24] amen
[19:27] what is he writing in our hearts
[19:31] he has written before the foundation of
[19:33] the world what he thinks about you
[19:38] Jeremiah 29 11 we always hear that
[19:42] scripture when you go to the youth camps
[19:44] or when we go to the youth meetings we
[19:46] always hear this scripture for I know
[19:50] for I know the thoughts that I think
[19:52] though are you
[19:54] saith the Lord
[19:56] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[19:59] give you unexpected end
[20:03] I know I love it the Lord again I know I
[20:07] will give you I will change your heart I
[20:10] know how you think
[20:14] this gives us confidence that he that he
[20:17] has a vision about me that that is why
[20:20] he is saying I know what I think about
[20:23] you I know your struggles I know your
[20:26] Temptations I know your shortcomings I
[20:30] know your desires but I do see you
[20:32] through those thoughts
[20:34] because I I can see now your heart
[20:37] and I see something else and I love this
[20:40] I see my masterpiece
[20:43] that's why my thoughts the Lord says our
[20:47] thoughts of peace and thoughts of not
[20:50] evil because now I am seeing my
[20:52] masterpiece
[20:54] and even more I will give you unexpected
[20:57] end I have a vision that on what you
[21:01] will become at the end
[21:04] send that beautiful he knows the end
[21:06] from the beginning that's how we have to
[21:09] walk this morning Lord you know my end
[21:11] you know my tomorrow you know how I'm
[21:14] gonna pay my bills you know everything
[21:16] you're gonna provide
[21:18] I have never seen the righteous forsaken
[21:21] neither his seat begging for bread
[21:26] but what is he asking for us what what
[21:28] is the law requiring from us he is
[21:31] asking for us to surrender
[21:34] to get on your heart so that he can get
[21:37] and he can write in in our heart
[21:40] and I can tell you if you know where
[21:43] you're coming from the Lord will show
[21:45] you your purpose and your expected
[21:48] future
[21:50] whatever your desire is make sure it is
[21:53] according to the Lord's perfect plan for
[21:55] your life
[21:56] you know just thinking and I just put it
[21:59] here you know I have had I have heard
[22:01] people that they they they they want to
[22:04] get married or they are in the process
[22:06] of getting married or talking to a
[22:08] sister talking to a brother
[22:10] and then all of a sudden then you start
[22:12] praying
[22:13] and then they I found some that they
[22:17] kind of asked for obvious signs
[22:22] to feed it into what they think that is
[22:25] the will of God
[22:27] you know maybe one can say you know what
[22:29] that she may be in church well what's
[22:32] the probability that she's going to be
[22:33] in church on a Sunday
[22:37] oh she's she's gonna be in church well
[22:40] I think you need more prayer
[22:44] or what's the probability that you know
[22:46] kind of the youth or like in general we
[22:49] get ideas on on how we want to feed God
[22:52] that's what I'm saying like we want to
[22:54] fit God into our thinking into our
[22:57] schedule
[23:00] or people seeking for designs I have
[23:03] heard you know as I'm saying that but uh
[23:05] I will do it differently nothing against
[23:08] it again nothing against it but things
[23:11] that I have seen but then you see the
[23:12] end result and then you see that it
[23:14] wasn't the will of God
[23:16] but I will I will tell you stay in the
[23:19] word and let those signs follow you
[23:24] I'm not following the signs amen because
[23:28] the Believers are not science followers
[23:33] the signs will follow the Believers
[23:37] because that's what the scripture says
[23:39] amen then the these signs shall follow
[23:41] them God believe so what's the
[23:44] requirement for you young people or for
[23:46] you kind of adult is that you have to be
[23:48] living the word of God and then
[23:51] everything that you're praying will will
[23:52] come into into the right place in the
[23:55] right time in the appointed time of the
[23:57] Lord
[23:58] amen
[24:00] build
[24:02] according to the vision
[24:04] amen if the Lord is telling you
[24:07] something he's just pray about it if if
[24:09] our pastor is telling you something just
[24:11] pray about it and then observe that
[24:13] thing and then do it and you will see
[24:15] that that those instructions are going
[24:17] to come to fruition
[24:21] Proverbs 29 18. it says
[24:25] where there is no vision
[24:28] the people perish
[24:34] in the in the amplifier it says where
[24:36] there is no Redemptive Redemptive
[24:38] revelation of God the people will perish
[24:43] but listen to this portion but he who
[24:46] keeps the law
[24:49] or he who keeps his Commandments
[24:54] blessed
[24:56] happy is he
[25:00] there is no vision
[25:02] there is nothing of the Lord You're
[25:04] Gonna perish
[25:05] but how beautiful it is when there is a
[25:07] vision then I will it will have the
[25:10] opposite will happen to me I won't
[25:12] perish
[25:14] where there is no not changing of the
[25:16] hearts the people will perish amen now
[25:19] in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 12
[25:23] verse 5.
[25:28] the Lord is talking through Moses to to
[25:30] his children
[25:32] and he tells them but you are to seek
[25:34] the place of the Lord your God
[25:36] the place of Lord your God will choose
[25:38] from among all the all your tribes to
[25:41] put his name there for his dwelling
[25:45] so what is the Lord instructing here to
[25:48] to to Moses he's telling him you know
[25:51] there is going to be a place and there
[25:52] is going to be among uh kind of all the
[25:55] tribes you have to uh build a place you
[25:59] have to uh
[26:01] erect a tabernacle
[26:04] and there
[26:07] there you I will put my name and I will
[26:11] be dwelling there
[26:12] amen
[26:14] so and then in the book of Acts I do
[26:16] Exodus chapter 25 verse 9 verse 9 it
[26:20] says and you shall make it according to
[26:23] all that I show you the pattern of the
[26:26] Tabernacle or dwelling and the pattern
[26:29] of all the furniture of it you see how
[26:32] glory is bringing up Moses is bringing
[26:34] him from one thing you know you're going
[26:36] to choose it among your among your the
[26:38] tribes and then he's gonna and then he's
[26:39] telling him and I will show you how
[26:41] you're gonna build it
[26:43] that's the beauty of the Gospel the Lord
[26:46] is not just going to give you
[26:47] instruction but but the Lord is very
[26:49] precise in what how he wants you to do
[26:52] things and we have we have learned
[26:54] through the years that when he gives
[26:56] precise a precise uh instructions is for
[26:59] our good is for our protection
[27:01] Amen in any book in the book of Hebrews
[27:04] chapter 8 and then it
[27:07] um Paul writing he says
[27:10] but the offer certainly it was just a
[27:13] pattern in the Amplified it says as a
[27:15] foreshadowing of what it is true and
[27:17] exists okay what has its true existence
[27:21] and reality in the Heavenly sanctuary
[27:24] for when Moses was about to erect the
[27:27] Tabernacle he was warned by God saying
[27:30] see to it that you make it all exactly
[27:33] according to the copy according to the
[27:36] model which was shown to you on the
[27:39] mountain
[27:41] and we're gonna get into something here
[27:43] why was it so important for Moses to
[27:47] follow the pattern as shown in the
[27:50] vision
[27:51] because he had to represent on how the
[27:54] Heavenly looked like
[27:57] amen that's why that's why Moses is like
[27:59] okay you have to build it according to
[28:03] what you saw
[28:05] and not only that also he needed to
[28:08] represent the one that was to come and
[28:10] that was Jesus amen not only the what
[28:15] was that because Mo if Moses when he was
[28:18] building the Temple I mean the
[28:19] Tabernacle when he was you know putting
[28:21] everything The Atrium the the holy place
[28:24] and the holiest of holiest and then when
[28:26] he was building all of that there were
[28:28] specifics every specifics the Lord was
[28:30] telling him telling Moses you have to
[28:32] use gold you have to use the silver you
[28:34] have you have to use this specific type
[28:36] of good everything was very specific
[28:39] and everything had a purpose
[28:41] why because it was pointing to someone
[28:44] to someone that was coming after after
[28:47] Moses and who was that well that was
[28:50] Jesus
[28:51] amen so and then Not only was Jesus amen
[28:56] we always hear that you know many people
[28:58] they say in Jesus but now it goes beyond
[29:01] what Jesus did at the cross
[29:04] he goes beyond that he needed to go back
[29:06] to heaven and then come back again
[29:09] and why he needed to come back again
[29:12] because now he needed to build a
[29:14] tabernacle again
[29:16] and where is that Tabernacle this
[29:18] morning
[29:22] are we getting it
[29:24] where is that Tabernacle now
[29:30] [Music]
[29:33] the first representation of that Vision
[29:35] was in Moses
[29:36] the second representation of that Vision
[29:38] was in who was in Jesus but now the
[29:42] third representation of that is in the
[29:44] bride it's in the bride of Christ this
[29:46] morning
[29:47] amen
[29:49] Psalms 102 and this is scripture you
[29:52] know you go to the Old Testament and now
[29:53] this scripture is prophesying on someone
[29:56] that needed to come he says this shall
[29:59] 102 18 it says these shall be written
[30:02] for direct generation to come and the
[30:05] people with which shall be created they
[30:08] shall praise the Lord
[30:10] who is that people this morning
[30:12] there is a people that needed to come
[30:14] and that people is here this morning
[30:17] verse 19 it says for he had looked down
[30:20] from the height of his Sanctuary from
[30:23] Heaven did the Lord behold the Earth
[30:25] and then I love this next scripture next
[30:29] verse it says because the Lord is is
[30:31] looking from heaven and what is he going
[30:33] to be doing number one to hear
[30:37] to hear what the groaning of the
[30:40] prisoners
[30:42] that there was a people that was coming
[30:44] and the Lord knew that that people they
[30:46] were going to be in prison
[30:48] but then then what's gonna happen is the
[30:51] Lord is not gonna just leave them
[30:53] they're in prison amen now the Lord is
[30:56] going to hear their complaint the Lord
[30:58] is going to hear their pain their the
[31:00] Lord is gonna hear their despair of the
[31:03] prisoner he will hear them and not only
[31:06] that but also to lose
[31:09] because this priests on Earth they were
[31:11] appointed to death
[31:13] but now you are being set free
[31:17] that's the scripture he's gonna hear you
[31:19] to come and lose you
[31:22] and not only that verse 21 it says to
[31:25] declare the name of the Lord in Zion and
[31:29] his praise in Jerusalem what does that
[31:32] mean they will be positioned why because
[31:35] what does it mean to declare to have a
[31:37] name it characterizes your life
[31:40] when you receive the name that is above
[31:43] all names it is characterizing your life
[31:47] that's on why under that great vision he
[31:50] gave a name above all names Jesus Christ
[31:53] we take his name we declare his name We
[31:58] Are characterizing The Life of Christ
[32:01] we must accept his name
[32:04] amen he will hear you he will lose you
[32:07] and then he's gonna position you
[32:10] she's got to take the word
[32:13] the same way he did it with Jacob from
[32:16] uh
[32:18] a liar
[32:21] planter
[32:23] the worst of of the worst
[32:26] from that to a prince with with God
[32:30] where were you before where are you now
[32:32] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen
[32:35] from Abraham Abraham what was he he also
[32:39] was a liar he he he did the wrong things
[32:42] but from that the Lord changed his name
[32:45] from Sarah someone that laugh in front
[32:47] of the Lord now what is she what is she
[32:49] she became a princess with God
[32:52] from uh from Peter what was his name
[32:56] before
[33:01] Simon Peter or Simon what was his that
[33:04] was his name and now became what Peter
[33:07] and then from Saul uh a persecutor of
[33:10] the of of the of the Christians then
[33:12] became Paul
[33:14] all these people they had to declare the
[33:18] name of the Lord so now the name you
[33:22] have received you didn't receive a
[33:24] simple name you have received a name
[33:27] that is above all names and that's the
[33:29] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and that's
[33:32] what the Bible says in the name that all
[33:34] the families on Earth are named after
[33:37] that
[33:38] they are going to represent Christ they
[33:40] are going to declare the name of the
[33:43] Lord
[33:44] amen
[33:46] if the Lord has a vision or a plan for
[33:48] you he will make it known to you
[33:52] you have a purpose how many here believe
[33:54] that you have that you have a purpose
[33:56] you have a reason to be here on Earth
[34:00] we get disappointed because we're not
[34:02] you know you're not the one that is
[34:03] doing uh one like everything that people
[34:06] can see but you are doing things behind
[34:09] the scenes and that's okay too
[34:14] foreign you have a purpose
[34:17] the prophet of God says God uses men and
[34:21] men only
[34:22] God doesn't use machinery
[34:26] group groups of men
[34:29] God doesn't use organizations but God
[34:32] uses individuals
[34:36] always
[34:39] Lord I'm Available to You here is my
[34:41] hands here's my eyes here's my mouth Use
[34:44] Me For Your Glory
[34:46] used me to declare your name on on this
[34:49] Earth Lord if even if I don't say a word
[34:52] Lord but may people see the name of
[34:54] Jesus walking on earth once again
[34:58] now God changes in different forms as
[35:02] part of that Vision but it's still the
[35:05] same God we are part of him
[35:09] the prophet of God says and that's God
[35:11] he changed himself from a pillar of fire
[35:13] to become a man
[35:15] he changed himself from that from that
[35:18] back in the spirit again that he may
[35:20] dwell in man
[35:23] God acting in man what he really was
[35:27] Jesus Christ was God acting in men in a
[35:32] man in a man that's what he was
[35:36] he changed from the pillar of Fire
[35:39] that's what we're saying he changed from
[35:40] the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[35:42] to Jesus
[35:45] and then he had to come in which was the
[35:48] veil in the wilderness that that was hit
[35:51] from that hit God from Israel
[35:54] Moses he see he he saw the shape of his
[35:58] body but really was hit all the time
[36:00] behind the pillar of Fire
[36:04] which was the logos that went from God
[36:06] now we find here since Pentecost God is
[36:09] not acting now God is acting through man
[36:15] amen
[36:17] he was acting in a man then Jesus now
[36:20] he's acting through men that he has
[36:23] chosen for this purpose he has chosen
[36:27] for this day God in the form of man he
[36:31] changed himself from the form of God to
[36:35] the form of of a man but now where is
[36:38] the Lord where is that vision
[36:42] amen
[36:43] now if you let's think a little bit
[36:46] about that Tabernacle
[36:48] is this okay amen
[36:51] when the Tabernacle was built
[36:57] there were utensils
[36:59] there were specific areas
[37:02] that needed to be in the right place you
[37:05] know the seven gold golden Candlestick
[37:07] it needed to be in the right place
[37:10] they're in the Tabernacle they they they
[37:12] show up right it needed to be in the
[37:14] right place and if you start thinking
[37:16] about this and then what does John in
[37:19] the Book of Revelations what is what
[37:21] does he see he sees one that is walking
[37:23] in in the middle of the that seven seven
[37:25] Candlestick what is he saying he's like
[37:28] the same that was in the beginning and
[37:30] Moses now he's walking around there
[37:33] and then when he's talking about the
[37:35] showbread what does that mean he says
[37:36] Jesus said I am the bread of life
[37:40] is it was in Christ fulfilling all those
[37:42] scriptures from Moses yes he was
[37:46] and you know then they were also in that
[37:49] Tabernacle there were also three courts
[37:51] on which the Tabernacle was divided
[37:55] and the prophet of God says but his
[37:57] Abiding Place you know that was the
[37:59] tabernacle and and that was just
[38:01] attributes of his presence from the
[38:03] holiest of holies amen but I now know
[38:06] notice you yourself you yourself you are
[38:11] perfected in three
[38:12] your soul your body your spirit
[38:16] amen your water there's water blood in
[38:20] the spirit when you were born and then
[38:22] these three things they come from from
[38:24] his body that makes up the new birth
[38:26] amen so now let's break this a little
[38:29] bit more so when he's talking about the
[38:31] Tabernacle that it was a kind of divided
[38:34] in three he's talking that there was the
[38:36] atrium in the Tabernacle amen do we know
[38:39] that there was a tabernacle and it was
[38:41] divided in three the first section was
[38:44] the atrium amen and and in that section
[38:47] what will he do in that section like
[38:49] people will come they will wash and they
[38:51] will offer over the sacrifices
[38:53] amen so here is where the sacrifices
[38:56] were were carried out and that we can
[38:58] say that it represents our body
[39:02] amen because now with without with our
[39:04] flesh we offer the sacrifices of praise
[39:08] didn't David says my flight My Flesh and
[39:10] my soul they they they Worship the Lord
[39:13] or something like that it was his flesh
[39:16] amen that was the outer part that was
[39:18] the atrium part
[39:20] and then the holy place the the the the
[39:23] place in the middle is here we have The
[39:26] Mercy Seat
[39:27] and then this this area here the holy
[39:31] place it represents the spirit of
[39:33] mankind amen you have the atrium so you
[39:35] have your body amen and then you have
[39:38] the Holy place now is the spirit you
[39:40] know
[39:41] is the spirit that we're talking you
[39:42] know like how how you have a spirit but
[39:45] you need to receive his spirit amen
[39:48] in the third section is the holiest of
[39:51] holies
[39:52] here we have the presence of the Lord
[39:56] in the holiest of holies
[39:59] but but but you see one thing the Lord
[40:01] build it build a tabernacle the lord
[40:04] gave an instruction to build the
[40:05] Tabernacle so the Lord wasn't going to
[40:07] work only with the holiest of holies
[40:10] not only with the Atria everything was
[40:13] needed for that Tabernacle to to to to
[40:16] keep running
[40:18] so that's the same for your life that's
[40:20] when you come to Christ you have to
[40:22] surrender everything
[40:23] you're you're outer The Atrium your the
[40:27] holy place your spirit and then you have
[40:29] to surrender the holiest of holies which
[40:32] is where he can dwell
[40:34] amen now you know even during that time
[40:39] during the time of the Tabernacle they
[40:41] they were worshipers in every section
[40:45] amen there were worshipers in The Atrium
[40:48] those that you know they make Believers
[40:50] possibly that they will come there once
[40:52] in a blue moon
[40:55] the ones in the Holy place that you know
[40:57] they they will try to make it sometimes
[41:00] but then there were the the the
[41:02] worshipers or there was only one
[41:04] worshiper that was the holiest of holy
[41:07] that will enter into the holiest of
[41:09] holies and there was a priest and he
[41:11] couldn't come only once a year
[41:14] amen that that was the rule amen but
[41:17] after Christ that's why everything that
[41:20] was with Moses now was in Christ that's
[41:22] what when Christ came
[41:24] if you're interested if you know your
[41:26] Bible when Christ came when when when
[41:28] when when he uh gave up the gods the
[41:31] ghost what happened the the veil in the
[41:35] temple it was rented pottered in two so
[41:38] now people can go into the holiest of
[41:42] holiest they didn't have to wait for
[41:45] every year to come and worship or or to
[41:48] to be able to have communion with the
[41:50] Lord now they could go there at any time
[41:53] that they need it
[41:55] he said that the same thing that happens
[41:58] with us right now every time that's why
[42:01] I'm telling you when you are in the work
[42:03] you are in communion in the Holiness of
[42:07] holiness
[42:08] that's when you say Lord I need you he
[42:10] can come and say hey I I want to dwell
[42:13] in that who is the police but I also
[42:15] want to take control of your atrium
[42:18] I want to take control of your spirit I
[42:21] want to take control of how you think
[42:24] of your imagination your conscience your
[42:28] memory I want to take control of that as
[42:29] well
[42:30] but I need to dwell in the holiest of
[42:33] holies
[42:35] so what worshiper are you this morning
[42:38] the one in the art room the one in the
[42:40] Holy place or the one in the holiest of
[42:43] holiest
[42:44] amen the prophet of God says he dwelt in
[42:48] his Tabernacle and today he dwells in
[42:52] you as his Tabernacle
[42:56] so now we're going from Moses praise the
[42:59] Lord for Moses now we're going from the
[43:02] man Jesus now he has another Tabernacle
[43:06] now that Tabernacle is here on Earth and
[43:11] that Tabernacle is me this morning
[43:15] I don't know about you but I want him to
[43:17] have a Dwelling Place in my life Lord I
[43:20] surrender all that I have I'll surrender
[43:23] my mind I Surrender my body I Surrender
[43:26] my soul all to you this morning
[43:30] but we must make this a Dwelling Place
[43:33] not an outer Court place or or the first
[43:37] holy place but we must live with God in
[43:41] the holiest of holies are consecrated
[43:44] hidden life alone quiet with God
[43:49] isn't that beautiful just go there and
[43:52] they in his presence that's what I want
[43:55] this morning Lord
[43:57] now
[43:58] there is more to their Tabernacle I want
[44:01] to drive your attention to the following
[44:02] the Tabernacle had a cover you see they
[44:05] they build a tabernacle and then Moses
[44:07] was instructed you know there will they
[44:09] will be there will be curtains that you
[44:11] have and they have to be blue some of
[44:12] them have to be blue some have to be red
[44:14] and then you have to have the the gold
[44:16] rings you know everything was very so
[44:18] perfect
[44:20] but in that area or like when he was
[44:24] building the Tabernacle he had to he had
[44:27] to cover that Tabernacle because just
[44:29] think about it when they would set up
[44:30] the Tabernacle then they will see the
[44:33] pillar of fire at night or they will
[44:34] they will see the cloud during the day
[44:36] amen and then when they will do that
[44:38] then if they wouldn't protect the
[44:41] Tabernacle then rain will come and then
[44:43] it will be a mess in the Tabernacle for
[44:46] Prince they will have to clean all the
[44:48] mess
[44:49] but they didn't have to do that
[44:51] because the Tabernacle was covered with
[44:55] a layer of skin
[44:59] the dabernacle was covered with a layer
[45:04] of a skin
[45:05] that sometimes on Sunday morning that
[45:08] layer of skin doesn't feel like waking
[45:10] up
[45:11] it has happened many times how in the
[45:15] world from Monday through Saturday you I
[45:17] can wake up very early and then on
[45:20] Sunday it's like I can't but it's
[45:23] because that layer of skin doesn't want
[45:25] to move but it has to move amen
[45:27] amen numbers four uh verse 6 it says in
[45:32] in shall put there on the covering of
[45:34] badgers skins in Charlotte spread it
[45:37] over over eat a cloth holy or blue and
[45:40] shall put it in this in the staff's
[45:42] thereof so in other words that Badger of
[45:45] his skin it needed to be painted a
[45:47] certain color and that was blue okay but
[45:50] it still it wasn't still animal skin
[45:53] and I googled and I found a picture of
[45:56] the badger animal and it's a very ugly
[45:59] animal
[46:01] so just think about your life how ugly
[46:03] these Badger skin can be sometimes
[46:07] but guess what the beautiful thing about
[46:10] this that the Lord is hidden in there
[46:15] and then I just think about this what's
[46:17] the characteristics of these uh Badger
[46:20] skins
[46:22] they are tough
[46:24] they are rough
[46:27] there is no Beauty in them
[46:29] but they are durable
[46:33] and they they don't have they are
[46:35] non-porous amen they are water repellent
[46:38] and they are weather resistant
[46:43] isn't that beautiful your body you can
[46:46] resist everything as much as the Lord
[46:48] LED you to resist
[46:50] amen you you you can resist that's why
[46:53] the Bible says resist the devil and he
[46:55] will flee from you because the devil is
[46:58] gonna try to bring the storms in your
[47:00] life is gonna be against you but you
[47:03] have a protection
[47:06] amen what was their purpose they were
[47:08] meant to protect what was inside of the
[47:11] Tabernacle so this outside is meant to
[47:15] protect what's inside
[47:17] amen what is it when a man breaks
[47:21] through that Veil into the Shekinah
[47:23] Glory now the world calls him a fanatic
[47:27] they can't see what's wrong but behind
[47:30] there there is no beauty of him he might
[47:33] not be able to pronounce pronounce his
[47:35] words right amen he may not dress just
[47:38] right he might not dress in clergy
[47:40] clothes but she might not dress the way
[47:43] they think she ought to dress but it may
[47:45] be but you see inside
[47:48] behind that Badger skin behind that
[47:52] human skin is there in there is the
[47:57] Shekinah Glory
[47:59] in there is a power in there is the word
[48:03] in there is the showbread in the in the
[48:07] Shekinah Glory which is a light that
[48:09] makes that light what does that light
[48:11] make in your life it makes your life
[48:13] ripen
[48:16] and there until you come in behind about
[48:19] your skin until you get out of your all
[48:22] the skin your all thoughts your all
[48:25] creates and you come into the presence
[48:28] of God then the word becomes a living
[48:31] reality to you
[48:33] then you're awakened to the Shekinah
[48:36] Glory and let me this is the the
[48:38] Simplicity of the Gospel is it tells me
[48:41] that the Shekinah Glory is Christ in me
[48:46] then the prophet of God says then the
[48:48] Bible becomes a new book then Jesus
[48:52] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[48:55] forever then you're living in his
[48:58] presence eating the showbread that's
[49:01] only provided that day for the Believers
[49:05] and in that day was only provided for
[49:08] the priest
[49:11] but now we are priests we are the royal
[49:15] priesthood a holy nation peculiar people
[49:18] giving a spiritual sacrifices to God
[49:23] but you must come in behind the veil to
[49:27] see the unveil God and God now is open
[49:30] God now is unveiled in our eyes that's
[49:34] his word made manifest
[49:38] behind that battery skin behind that
[49:41] rough person that sometimes wouldn't
[49:42] even cry now King come to the altering
[49:46] tear for the Lord
[49:49] it's in that beautiful cobbler can work
[49:51] in our lives it's just Lord It's just
[49:53] amazing
[49:55] it can be tough it can be rough but in
[49:58] the presence of God there is not nothing
[50:00] like that
[50:02] now
[50:04] I think we have we still have some time
[50:06] amen
[50:13] as I was saying before that's the reason
[50:16] why the Tabernacle needed to be very
[50:18] precise it needs to be perfect why
[50:20] because God dwells imperfection
[50:24] amen now the Lord if you message uh
[50:27] readers
[50:29] you you have you have read the lord gave
[50:32] the prophet uh a vision and it was a
[50:37] tenth Vision amen
[50:39] and we always have heard about that 10th
[50:43] Vision in some I'm not I'm not wanting
[50:45] I'm not waiting for that Vision to be
[50:47] fulfilled in the future I want that
[50:49] Vision to be fulfilled now
[50:51] and I can tell you that that vision is
[50:54] being fulfilled in our day
[50:56] because why you are that Vision we are
[50:59] that vision
[51:01] what is that
[51:04] the prophet of God speaks about a first
[51:06] pull
[51:09] what was that first pull the first pull
[51:12] to the prophet of God was that he like
[51:14] like when if you go back in the book of
[51:17] Exodus and Moses is in front of the
[51:19] burning bush and the Lord says I'm gonna
[51:22] use your Moses and Moses had so many
[51:25] questions so many excuses to the Lord
[51:28] like how are you gonna use me I I'm not
[51:30] I'm I kind of short in my words and the
[51:33] Lord every single time he will bring an
[51:35] excuse the Lord will bring an answer
[51:39] but then the Lord says what do you have
[51:41] in your hand and he says well I have a
[51:43] rod then you just put it there and then
[51:45] that Rod became became a serpent and
[51:47] then Moses went and grabbed it he got it
[51:49] again and then the Lord said if they
[51:51] even believe you for by the first sign
[51:53] now you're gonna you're gonna do
[51:54] something else put your hand under your
[51:57] bosom and then it became leper right he
[52:00] became a leper and then when he put it
[52:02] back then he became healed
[52:04] amen so that was in the scripture so the
[52:07] prophet of God it was the same thing his
[52:09] first pull his first experience or the
[52:12] the beginning of his ministry was the
[52:15] same thing that he will grab the the
[52:16] hymn of the people on the right side of
[52:19] the
[52:20] like the the right hand if I'm not
[52:22] mistaken he will grab the right hand and
[52:24] then there will be like some kind of red
[52:27] marks on his arm and then if if that
[52:29] sickness will go away then that that
[52:31] person who could be declared healed
[52:34] right and and if that that uh sickness
[52:37] wouldn't go away the angel of the Lord
[52:39] told him you just declare a blessing on
[52:40] them and let them go
[52:43] amen that was the first the first uh the
[52:46] first pool or or or or the beginning of
[52:48] the prophet's Ministry in the in he
[52:50] always told us to go back to the
[52:52] scriptures and make sure that everything
[52:54] was in the scriptures so that's why I'm
[52:56] quoting Moses again because Moses had
[52:59] the same experience amen the prophet of
[53:02] God who was matching his experience with
[53:04] Moses experience amen that was the first
[53:06] poem
[53:07] then we can say something about that
[53:11] first pool it was it was a time of
[53:13] humility for the prophet of God it was a
[53:15] time of humility for for Moses because
[53:17] when he goes in front of the burning
[53:20] bush what does the Lord do he does he
[53:22] tells Moses you have to remove the the
[53:24] your sandals because where you are is a
[53:27] holy place
[53:28] and when we're talking about someone
[53:30] removing kind of covering or removing
[53:33] something out of their feet that's a
[53:34] sign of humility
[53:37] amen so the first thing we can say that
[53:40] that the first pool was a sign of
[53:42] humility as well as uh healing of the
[53:45] heart it meant I was that that was
[53:48] something that we can say there and then
[53:50] the the the the the second pool
[53:54] was about the prophet of God was told if
[53:57] they don't believe the first sign as
[53:59] well you will you will then you will
[54:01] know the secrets of the of the heart of
[54:03] the people amen
[54:05] so and when he will know the secrets of
[54:08] the heart of the people God was so
[54:10] precise that he will say you know your
[54:12] sisters aren't so you live in in science
[54:14] in in this city and this is your street
[54:16] and this is your number
[54:18] God is very precise
[54:21] and then there was one occasion just as
[54:23] an example or as a background that the
[54:26] prophet of God told his sister you live
[54:28] on this street and this is your number
[54:30] and then there was somebody next to next
[54:33] to her and and that was the friend and
[54:35] she's like well that's not right he made
[54:36] a mistake
[54:38] but no God God doesn't make mistakes
[54:41] that sister just recently moved
[54:44] that's how God knows your address
[54:47] God God knows where you live
[54:50] amen that was the second pool knowing
[54:52] the hearts of the people now where can
[54:54] we find this in the scriptures let's go
[54:56] back to the scriptures Genesis 18
[54:58] chapter 9. serps at the 10th when the
[55:01] lord gave the word to Abraham the Lord
[55:03] knows all the intents and desires of the
[55:06] heart
[55:07] in this occasion Elohim the melchized
[55:10] that comes to Abraham and tells him in
[55:13] the time of life your Sarah your wife
[55:16] will have a son
[55:17] amen that was a promise and then sir and
[55:20] then he asked where is first he has
[55:22] where is Sarah and Sarah was behind him
[55:24] in the tent
[55:26] but then when when when he he was there
[55:29] and then Sarah laughed at the tent and I
[55:33] can say that there was enough there was
[55:35] enough distance that they they couldn't
[55:37] he couldn't he couldn't have hurt her
[55:40] when she was laughing but the Lord knows
[55:43] that the the desires and the intents of
[55:45] the heart so he said why did Sarah laugh
[55:49] and then say I I imagine that Sarah came
[55:52] and she said I didn't laugh
[55:56] what was going on here the Lord was
[55:57] revealing the desires and the intents of
[56:00] the hearts of Sarah that her heart was
[56:02] not at the time was not ready to receive
[56:04] the promise but I'm gonna tell you
[56:07] something when it is your time to
[56:09] receive a promise the Lord is going to
[56:10] prepare your heart
[56:12] you when it is your time for a vision to
[56:15] be fulfilled in your heart the Lord is
[56:17] going to prepare the grounds so that you
[56:20] can receive that promise
[56:22] and I I was last Sunday morning we were
[56:25] in The Sundays because we were talking
[56:27] about this one is specifically the Lord
[56:29] revealing the desires and intents of the
[56:31] heart and why what was the reason that
[56:34] the Lord couldn't kill Sarah why well he
[56:39] he couldn't say you know what you just
[56:41] laughed you just lied to do the God
[56:43] Almighty made him flesh in front of you
[56:45] why he couldn't have killed her why
[56:48] because she was part of Abraham amen
[56:51] there was already the seed of God in her
[56:54] that's why he couldn't sit the god of
[56:56] her of a promise that needed to come to
[56:58] pass
[57:00] so why sometimes in our lives all our
[57:03] sometimes we lie in the face of God we
[57:06] we don't live the life that he wants us
[57:09] to live we don't we watch the wrong
[57:11] things that we shouldn't watch why
[57:14] aren't we not kill this morning
[57:20] because he is dwelling in you
[57:23] God cannot kill his own seed he said he
[57:29] says Sarah you're going to have a son
[57:31] and she left but then the Lord said
[57:32] you're gonna have it anyway
[57:34] because you're gonna be ready to receive
[57:36] the promise and now in this day in this
[57:40] hour many times without of the promise
[57:43] of the Lord but he's telling us you're
[57:45] going to receive what you have been
[57:46] praying for even though you laugh but I
[57:49] cannot destroy you because you have a
[57:51] purpose and one more thing you are me
[57:54] you are Christ
[57:58] that's the second the second pool
[58:01] what was that
[58:02] was yielding that's what you have to
[58:04] yield
[58:05] the first ball you have to be humble the
[58:07] second pool you have to yield you have
[58:09] to say Lord
[58:10] I offer my life to you this morning I
[58:12] give it all to you Lord whatever it
[58:14] takes as we were singing I was just
[58:16] touched by by that song Whatever It
[58:18] Takes Lord I'll yield it to you
[58:21] that was the second pool
[58:23] but now
[58:24] the Lord Works in Perfection Perfection
[58:27] not imperfection but imperfection
[58:31] make make sure about that what was the
[58:34] third book
[58:35] is a time of communion
[58:39] because what what did he say
[58:41] he's like during that that the last the
[58:45] last part of the vision the first Vision
[58:47] was the first pull the second the the
[58:50] first poll was was the the
[58:53] um
[58:54] the the hand the second pool was knowing
[58:56] the desires and the intents of the
[58:58] hearts or the secrets of the hearts of
[59:00] the people and but the third
[59:02] he's like I found myself in a tent
[59:07] yeah
[59:08] wouldn't that be I found myself in a
[59:10] tabernacle
[59:12] and that in that Tabernacle there may
[59:14] have been the first pool there may have
[59:16] been the artery there may have been the
[59:18] holiest of the Holy place but in that
[59:21] Tabernacle there was a little room
[59:23] at the end and every single person that
[59:26] was going through that little room they
[59:29] were coming in crippled and they were
[59:30] walking out healed
[59:34] it's like that will be your second pool
[59:39] is like
[59:40] he said and then the the most important
[59:43] part here
[59:45] he said the first and second pool like
[59:48] kind of the Angel told the prophet of
[59:50] God you messed it up why because you
[59:53] were telling you were trying you were
[59:54] explaining to people
[59:57] what this meant you are not supposed to
[1:00:00] explain these things to people they just
[1:00:02] have to believe
[1:00:04] amen how many times we want to explain
[1:00:06] things when you just have to believe
[1:00:09] I that's the way it is supposed to be I
[1:00:12] don't have explanations for for many
[1:00:13] things in in my life but the only thing
[1:00:15] I'm standing here I'm believing what he
[1:00:18] has promised
[1:00:20] amen but the same voice and and now I
[1:00:24] want you to notice here the same voice
[1:00:26] that was talking to me he says I
[1:00:31] will meet you in there
[1:00:36] I will meet you in that little room
[1:00:40] and this is the third pool but nobody
[1:00:43] will know nothing about it I say well I
[1:00:46] don't understand why in there why why
[1:00:47] there he says he will not be a public
[1:00:51] show this time
[1:00:53] I said I don't understand going into
[1:00:56] that closet like that he says it is it
[1:00:59] is not isn't it written by our Lord when
[1:01:01] thou praise be not like the Hypocrites
[1:01:04] who who like to be heard before men but
[1:01:06] enter into the secret closet and pray to
[1:01:10] the father who see it in secret and he
[1:01:12] could see it in secret shall require you
[1:01:14] openly
[1:01:17] I will ask you this morning how many
[1:01:19] times have you entered into that little
[1:01:20] room that where is that prayer
[1:01:36] I will meet you there
[1:01:39] we want to finish soon
[1:01:41] what is the third pool it is the little
[1:01:44] room in the heart of the believer where
[1:01:47] the Lord wants to come and meet us there
[1:01:52] it is that heavenly vision that Moses
[1:01:55] saw about the Tabernacle there were so
[1:01:57] many parts of it but there was the Holy
[1:01:59] stuff of holies where the presence of
[1:02:01] the Lord was going to dwell those were
[1:02:04] types and shadows on what is taking
[1:02:06] place today every time the Lord is
[1:02:09] telling us I will meet you
[1:02:14] now it is not a physical Tabernacle no
[1:02:17] it is in the heart of the believer where
[1:02:20] the Lord every day is telling is telling
[1:02:23] us as I started this this sermon this
[1:02:26] morning I will change your heart I will
[1:02:29] give you a new spirit and then now to
[1:02:31] the prophet he's telling him I will meet
[1:02:34] you
[1:02:36] the Lord wants to meet you there inside
[1:02:40] of that little little room that Shekinah
[1:02:43] Glory is is where the seed will ripen
[1:02:46] where all your questions are gonna be
[1:02:49] answered even if it is a no Lord I know
[1:02:52] you have my answer as we were hearing
[1:02:55] from Brother rap on Wednesday people
[1:02:57] trying to fit Garden into their will but
[1:03:00] now I'm I'm gonna be feeding God in into
[1:03:02] my will I'm gonna feed myself into the
[1:03:06] world into the vision into his perfect
[1:03:08] will for my life
[1:03:11] that is my desire that I can be in the
[1:03:14] presence of the Sun every day what a
[1:03:17] beautiful promise it is that he has Pro
[1:03:19] that he he has given us that he will
[1:03:23] meet us there
[1:03:25] you see how the prophet of God he's kind
[1:03:27] of is like it's not about me it's not
[1:03:29] about a Ministry it's it's not it's not
[1:03:32] even about the faithful Ministry
[1:03:34] is about God
[1:03:36] Christ and his people and he's telling
[1:03:39] him I will meet you there I want to
[1:03:42] reveal things that are in your heart I
[1:03:45] wanna change your heart I I Wanna Give
[1:03:48] You salvation I want I want to give you
[1:03:50] restoration but I need to meet you in
[1:03:54] there
[1:03:56] that's what Revelations 3 20 says behold
[1:03:59] I stand at the door and I am knocking
[1:04:02] and if any man hear my voice and open
[1:04:05] the door I
[1:04:07] will come into him and I will stop with
[1:04:10] him and he with me
[1:04:13] to him that overcoming and then overcome
[1:04:16] it then he says will I grant again the
[1:04:20] Lord I will give you I will come to you
[1:04:24] I will grant you to sit with me in my
[1:04:26] throne even as I also overcame and I am
[1:04:29] sit down with my father in his throne
[1:04:32] that's the last Church age promised I
[1:04:35] will come to you I'm outside of your
[1:04:37] door knocking do you want your vision to
[1:04:40] be fulfilled the Lord is knocking
[1:04:43] the reason why he wants to come and
[1:04:45] dwell in us to live is because he wants
[1:04:48] to live his life through us
[1:04:51] he wants to display that Divine love
[1:04:54] that we have been hearing in the past
[1:04:56] few days
[1:04:58] that is the whole purpose where God and
[1:05:01] men have met now is that time where the
[1:05:05] people of God
[1:05:07] the Christians they will display
[1:05:11] The Life of Christ
[1:05:13] they are in that little room that where
[1:05:16] the Lord is meeting them every day and
[1:05:18] they're saying I will meet you there I
[1:05:21] will feed you there I will give you of
[1:05:23] my bread of life I will give you of that
[1:05:25] water of eternal life that if you come
[1:05:28] to that water you will never be thirsty
[1:05:31] again
[1:05:34] and we can finish with this
[1:05:36] everything that we have spoken this
[1:05:38] morning about that Vision summarizes
[1:05:40] into this
[1:05:41] Colossians 1 26.
[1:05:44] and I'm finishing
[1:05:47] it says even the mystery which has been
[1:05:50] hid from ages and from Generations but
[1:05:54] now is made manifest to whom
[1:05:58] to his Saints
[1:06:00] we were saying dress like a saint live
[1:06:04] like a saint act like a saint and now
[1:06:07] the scripture is telling us I am
[1:06:09] manifesting my word to you
[1:06:11] to whom God will make known what is the
[1:06:16] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:06:19] among the Gentiles which is
[1:06:24] Christ in you
