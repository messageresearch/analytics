Never said I would fall. Never said that [music] everything [singing] would go the way I wanted to go.

[music] I just can't give up [music] now. Come so [singing] far from where I started [music] from. Oh, [singing] [music] and nobody told me the road would be easy.

A fresh anointing is [music and singing] coming my way. It's a season [music] of [singing] power. Oh, and prosperity. It's a new [music and singing] season coming to me. [music] We got a prayer request tonight. I don't know if we have Oh, you ready to come up? Our pastor. Let's give them give him a hand tonight. I did have one come in [music] a couple days ago for my friend brother Bill Sanchez who's going to Honduras with me and his nephew [music] is 15 and he was going to the hospital there and I don't know the update tonight but we could pray for him as we open the service tonight. Um I can't even remember his name but let's remember uh that 15year-old boy there from the Dixon, Tennessee area. Let's remember him in prayer. Anybody else have something you want to lift your hand tonight upon your heart? Amen. We'll just pray [music] together for that need and and your needs tonight. And it's good to be here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord to worship the Lord. Amen. Father, we just ask that you will come, Lord Jesus, as we've already, Brother Carass, already inviting your presence here, Lord, and we know that you're here and present among us. We just pray you'll remember Brother Bill's uh nephew, Lord, and just went into the hospital vomiting and something wrong with him. I pray you'll strengthen him tonight, Lord. to be able to figure out what the issue is, Lord. And I pray you bring healing to them, Lord. Also, Father, the precious souls that are here tonight, those that are listening, Lord, those that are at the local assembly here, that we always have things, Lord, that we with questions and also little burdens that we carry, Father, and sensitivity, Lord, to what's next maybe in life and also maybe going through a trial. Somebody going through something. And Lord, I know some in the assembly, there's some really difficult trials they're going through right at this time. Would you, Father, just come and bring bring the comfort from your word tonight. Would you come and encourage each individual, Lord? I pray. And as we yield oursel to you, Lord, may we find that place that we could just settle with your peace, Lord, that all things will work out to your good. We just commit the service to you in this word that we minister tonight in Jesus precious name. Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you tonight. I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed the the meeting after on Sunday. It was just gathering and showing you some of the drawings of potentially what the Lord could do to have a a camp here and also a place to house and have the retreats and thinking about the future generation. And it was such such a good time, such good input and uh a lot of creative ideas there and and I don't know if we can do all of them, but it sure was fun talking about it anyway. And uh I think sometimes God can drop something on somebody's heart and you don't think of that and say, "Well, we'll just put that there before the Lord and see if that can be done as well." And I certainly enjoyed it. God bless you all for your input and those that came. And um we just know the Lord, we're ready to go now in the rapture, but we have to, brother Bram said, we have to plant our potatoes for if we're going to be hundred years from now. And we're, oh Lord, let us not be another hundred years from now. But we have to be have wisdom to plant for the next generation when we're gone. We have to have a multi-generational vision that what can we do to make sure the word carries on being planted in the hearts of these children for the future when we're gone. So we have to have that. Brother Bram says live like he's coming right now and plan like he's coming 100 years from now. So we want to have that kind of balance. So Proverbs 14:12 one scripture tonight if we could read it together and then we'll just have you seated. Proverbs chapter 14 and we'll just use just this one reference tonight for our subject. Proverbs 14 and verse 12. There is a way that seemth right unto a man. That means that um it's it can be very convincing that this looks like the way, this looks like the path. It's not something that's a no-brainer that you can tell that ain't the path. This is there is a way that seemth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. So that's the ones we need the discernment to see what something that looks like the way. Um and it it it's not really actually the ends of it. And there's some things that we know after 6,000 years we can see the fruit of them. We can see if someone would choose that direction. We've we we've got all the data is in. So somebody who would choose that particular thing, we could see because we already have a history of it and we can see where it leads. And that's why we can have the upper edge on the enemy to see the history and say, "Well, I know where that's going to lead, so I don't want to go down that path." That being said, tonight there's a way that seemth right, and that's only a counterfeit to the real way. And that's Jesus saying, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. He has the way for us." God bless you as you're seated tonight. May the Lord add his blessings to the word. So this evening as uh we study together the word, we want to take this next section of he cares, do you care? And those who those of you are not on board yet know know what we're doing here. if you took that sermon and you could listen to it. I think it's probably a couple hours so it's a longer one but uh we have been studying a little bit out of it and taking into different things and there's several reasons why I'm studying it deeply. I find it to be a wonderful uh deposit of God to sons and daughters of God this age. I find it to be a wonderful service. I think I said at the beginning that it's not a doctrinal sermon as such. Um, it's not necessarily a faith-building sermon because there's all different uh messages that came from uh the messenger, but I find certain uh sermons to be instructional uh to sons and daughters of God. In other words, it's things to teach us how to find the channel to God, how to find the way, how to get into a a channel of discernment that we could really get victories in our lives and not be blind to those things, but to actually find the channel. So, I find it to be that type of sermon. I hate to call it a sermon because I don't think what we've been given in the last days is just sermons. I think they're announcements. I think they're uh they're proclamations and they're great um instructional things for sons and daughters of God to bring us into the final lap for the last days. So we want to take this next section and and we want as as in this series we've been studying uh and exploring the the depth of finding that channel finding that channel that God steps that God can step in with his heart who cares. He cares. Do you care that God could step in a God who cares and step in uh and move in a supernatural way? Finding the channel that God could step in and move in a supernatural way. We want to find that channel. We want to do that. And one of the ways we've been bringing it is that he cares. Do you care? And brother Brandham says when we show that we care, that we really care, then we find that that God's moved by that and he steps in and he shows he cares. It's not just he says that he cares, but he actually steps in and does something about it. But it he's really teaching us that he he doesn't really move in uh to someone who's who's not really serious, not really sincere. uh they say they want help but they don't they don't show the results of really wanting help and turning towards God. So he cares do you care is an announcement that he show he he will care uh when we show that we care. And we learn that there is a we're going to learn tonight and we've learned through this that there's a provided way for God to supernaturally move into situations to bring there's a way that God wants to bring true deliverance to someone who needs deliverance. There's a way to freedom. And I mean real freedom. There's a way that we get there. There's a way to powerful Christian living. How many believe that there's a way to living a powerful Christian life? There there's a way to true love in a marriage. There's a way to divine true love in a marriage. There's a way to get there. Aren't you glad that there's he says there's victory, but he also provides the way to get to victory. &gt;&gt; And so there's a way to freedom. There's a way for deliverance. There's a way to live a powerful Christian life. There's a way to true love in a marriage, true divine love in a church, in the family. There's a way to get there. And it's a lot less complicated than what we think. Sometimes God's way and path to get there is a lot less complicated than what we think. I never said it was easy because it is difficult, but it's it's less complicated than what we make it. God's way has been made complicated by the devil. But God's way is really not complicated. It's the simplest way. &gt;&gt; It's man that makes it complicated. And so, but I didn't say it was easy because it's hard. And really, it's hard to find God's way sometimes. It's hard because we don't want to fully confess. We're scared. Things have made us scared. Scared of God's way. Scared of confessing. Scared of repenting. If I confess that, what's it going to do to my family? what's going to happen. So, we have all these fears from the devil to keep us from confessing and repenting. And so, we're that's why it's hard to find God's way of deliverance is because we're scared. We We don't want to come the full way of confession and repentance. And so, we back off and we're scared of what it might do. But Jesus said, "Come to me. My yoke is easy. My burden is light." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, it is a burden and it is a yoke. But I can guarantee you God's way and his burden is he says it's light. My yoke, my burden is light. My yoke is easy. It's a lot easier than going the world's way. &gt;&gt; My yoke is easy. My burden is light. And compared to the world and all of the world's offers for help, to help you, to relieve you, compared to the world, God's way, his yoke is easy and his burden is light. And nothing will ever be as light and as simple and as uncomplicated as taking the Lord's way. And the only reason it becomes scary or complicated is maybe your past history that's made it complicated. And a lot of times religion will do that. A past background of just religion or too much legalism actually will make it difficult to trust God's way because it's been tainted. God's way is still easy. God's way is still light. His burden is still light. It's still the easiest path to deliverance. &gt;&gt; But but sometimes our past can make us afraid of trusting God's path, trusting God's way and that narrow way because how many knows it's a narrow way? Broad is the way that leads to destruction, but narrow is the way that needs leads to life. And so it is a narrow way, but it's also a scary way because of how the devil has scared us away from it. and and made it. But but when we begin to seek uh and apply his way uh and we go down that path, when we find that channel, nothing is impossible with God. &gt;&gt; How many want to find the channel that nothing's impossible? &gt;&gt; Nothing's impossible. &gt;&gt; And there's a way to get into that channel that all of a sudden now we're into the realms of of possibilities with God that are impossible with man, impossible with you. But there's a channel and I believe believers have access to that channel more than anybody else. &gt;&gt; God honors faith. But listen, this thing was purchased at Calvary for believers to latch on to and say, "I have a channel I can get into to the supernatural God, to the uh the God of the impossibilities." And when you catch that channel, it it doesn't take theology. It doesn't take KNOWING ALL THE QUOTES. YOU JUST FIND THAT CHANNEL in that way. And all of a sudden you see my this here he is the supernatural God has showed up &gt;&gt; and he's changed the situation. But the truth is is that we turn to other ways. And this is brother Ram's theme now as he comes into this section of the message. We tend to run around God's way. We tend to find other ways. Mankind does that. And we try other ways uh that are given by Satan to get answers to things. And um we've come to a section of the sermon where brother Bram speaks very plain about two main sources of dependence uh from human beings. And that is he really begins to go into science and education. Why is it important for him to just take and almost dismantle a trust in science and a trust in education? Why is it important for him to do that? Because science and education becomes two of the most powerful sources since the very garden of Eden. Two powerful sources in since the beginning of time presenting themselves science and education presenting themselves through the enemy as an alternative to the supernatural God. There's many things that Satan has, many traps, many temptations. There's many surface uh symptoms and uh things of the world and and addictions and things that he has and that's all surface things. But one of the things he uses that's been used throughout time and in the very beginning is to draw a person into science and education. Why is it important for the prophet talk about this? Because it's it's two of the things that Satan has presented as making themselves ultimately. At first it doesn't look like it. At first, science uh looks like that man has figured something out. At first, education seems good. And you remember, I want to balance this tonight by saying because I'm going to read what he said about education. He pretty much dismantles it. But other places, Brother Bram says in lean not to thine understanding. He says, "Now education is a good thing." He he brother never uh defended or supported ignorance. He our children should be going to school and they should learn things in life. And he said if you get and lean not to thine own understanding. He said it's I'm not against that. He said it would. But here's what he said. He said you go and get a degree. You get a trade. He said it'll make things better for you in life. No doubt. But it has nothing to do with eternal life. &gt;&gt; And so what's he saying? Don't ever use education. Don't ever use that as an alternative, SOME TYPE OF PATH [screaming] PATH TO ETERNAL LIFE or to THE SUPERNATURAL GOD. IT'LL NEVER LEAD you there. &gt;&gt; Education can't do that. And look how the churches now throughout history has latched on to education and think they COULD EDUCATE SOMEBODY INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD. THAT'S THE TRAP. YOU CAN'T EDUCATE A PERSON INTO THE kingdom of God. It has to be a new birth. They have to be born again. They have to receive a revelation. &gt;&gt; And so you see how the enemy can take education, something that can be good, but then he can turn it over as an alternative &gt;&gt; for the supernatural God, as an alternative to the way towards God. And it's not the way towards God. Education is not the way towards God. So these are two powerful sources when they are present themselves. They don't start that way. Education and science are very appealing and that's why we uh not only are drawn by it but also we we use it. We are using some science, some medicines and we are becoming educated. We we should do that. But there's two sides to that. There's two sides to this. There's a real good side and then there's a real real bad side to it to both of them. And that's why the tree of knowledge is called the tree of knowledge of good and evil. That's why it's so deceptive &gt;&gt; because it has a real good side to it. I mean, we are I wouldn't say we're eating off the tree, but we're using things that come off the tree of knowledge of good and evil. You probably cooked on a nice stove tonight. You didn't uh build a fire in back of your house and unless you're, you know, grizzly atoms or something and you wanted to do it the natural way or in camping or whatever, that's fine. You had things. Most of you didn't walk to church tonight like some of our brothers in Nigeria. Uh you drove a nice car and and so I could accuse all of you of basically using a lot of stuff off the tree of knowledge of Geneva. So don't go out here saying I don't eat from that. I don't do that. I don't do any of those things. And let me just see you in the summer when it's real hot and you can go without your air conditioning. Yeah. Exactly. So we you know this we we have these things and medicine and science and and all the the new things that we've got and it continues to increase every day. I think you know you buy something you buy a laptop and it's out within just you know a few days it's out of date. So um so so now we see that it has two sides to it. You understand that? Uh but after 6,000 years, we get to see the fruit. And this is where brother Brennham's going to go because we can't have any trust in education and science as a way to the supernatural God because we've had 6,000 years to see the fruit that comes from it. &gt;&gt; And that's why I'm applying this scripture. There is a way that seemth right unto man, &gt;&gt; but the end is death. &gt;&gt; And brother Bern's going to say in a minute. I'm going to read it to you. He says, "This science and education we've discovered, the only way it leads to is death." &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; You see, so along the way, there's things that we use from it, but after 6,000 years, we get to see the fruit of the those things and what's following it and the fruit of following a dependence on science and education. There's so much that goes with it. Education, there's so much pride that goes with it till a man rises in his education and he knows it all. And now he knows more than God. But man choosing this way is easy to choose because it has some results to it. It has good things to it. It can move you into higher position. Sometimes it actually the mind and the body and the soul has needs. It has thirst. It needs help. The mind, the body and the soul, especially since the fall in the garden of Eden, it needs help. We need help. Can you say amen? So all of us, our body, our minds, our spirits, our emotions, it becomes in need. in our soul becomes in need and we have thirst so we need help and this the reason that I this is the reason I've read once again there's a way that seemth right unto a man in other words it's a bit more appealing it's science and education are a bit more appealing than saying you know you know what you need you need to you need to smoke more cigarettes we're not really going to hear that but something like education and science and we've proven this this will help you and we've proven if you go this path you can become knowledgeable. It's more appealing than just saying I know what you need. You need to smoke more cigarettes. Parents are saying why is brother Paul saying that in front of my kids. That's the answer for your problems. You need to drink more pop. That's the answer of your you need to eat more chicken like Chick-fil-A says. Maybe if you go out wind surfing it would clear all your troubled mind for the rest of your life. You know, people are probably uh most cases shouldn't be dumb enough to swallow things like that. But when you when you talk about the serpent, they're standing there and saying to Eve, saying, "You'll get a knowledge from this." And that knowledge will make you as gods. That's appealing to the human being. You see, that's appealing because it's been said. He didn't say, "Eve, let's go party and let's go into all the bars and let's just No, no, no. He's there. He's quoting the word. He's misinterpreting the word. And then he says that this is this is this is something that will bring you knowledge that you will become as a god yourself." &gt;&gt; Listen, human beings, this is that's a trap for them &gt;&gt; because they want to be better than the next person. They want to have that kind of knowledge. This I'm going to be in the no here. And if I'm in the know, there's not a lot of things I can do. That's the trap of education because why is it a trap? Because right there, he's selling her on taking the knowledge instead of the revelation of God and staying in the channel of fellowship with God. &gt;&gt; And it's Satan doing it. It's the serpent anointed by Satan to do it. And there, this whole thing's happening right in the Garden of Eden. And and so it becomes appealing because it it's a way that seemth right. It seems so convincing. It is more drawing to a person that said this this they're going to say this really seems right. I've pondered this. I've thought about this. This seems like the way that I would get the answers to my problems. And so but you see the end of thereof is the ways of death. It's worded that there is a way singular that seemth right unto man. But the end is the ways plural of death. So something singular from Satan that seemth right now all of a sudden splits into a a plural thing of it goes to many ways of death. &gt;&gt; Many ways of death. There's it's not a physical death. Many times it's a dying in the soul in the spirit. It's dying to believing that there's hope for me. Uh the Bible says a woman who lives in pleasure is dead while she liveth. Not physically, but she's actually walking around, but because she's bought into the pleasure idea and the world's view of pleasure, she's actually dead spiritually, but she's still walking around. &gt;&gt; There's a series that's been out years, and I see the name of it called The Walking Dead. How perfectly is that naming people who are walking on the face of the earth right now? The walking dead. She that live in pleasure is dead while she's living. They're physically walking around, but they're the walking dead because they're spiritually dead. And not only they're spiritually dead in their soul, but also in their spirit, they have given up. There there's no hope. They've given into the addiction that there there's there's no hope in their heart that there's any channel THAT THEY CAN COME OUT of this. And so they've given up. And so they've chosen a way that has le led to death in their life. They're still physically alive, BUT THERE'S NO LIFE IN THEM. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. THERE'S NOTHING TO RISE ABOVE IT. THEY HAVE GIVEN UP BECAUSE THEY CHOSE THAT WAY. And that way leads to death. &gt;&gt; Couldn't find the way. couldn't find God's channel to change whatever they wanted to be changed. So I put as the base of our scripture uh to these things that the prophet warns us about in science and education. There's a way that seemth right. It's so close. It sounds right. And uh if you just look at verse 15 of the text, it says the simple believeth and I'm in Proverbs uh 14 just two script three scriptures down. And it says in 15, the simple believeth every word, but the prudent man lookth well to his going. And that word simple means the foolish one, the one who doesn't think it through. And what does he do? He believes everything that comes along. He buys into it. Doctor says this science, he's more educated than I am. And so now the foolish believes every word. We as Christians can't believe everything everybody says on the internet. in the medical field, &gt;&gt; but we we fall to it because you say we're we're in a position they're more educated than me. But you see, friends, and and and you see what I'm saying tonight. I'm not be I would respect a man that knows what I'd rather him I'd rather an experienced man do an operation on me than one who wasn't experienced, one who's just done one of them, you know? So, I understand respecting what they know. But our problem is is that we can't back off and all of a sudden we accept everything that they say because we feel intimidated. They have more knowledge than us. Don't forget you're a believer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; DON'T FORGET YOU KNOW THE GREAT PHYSICIAN. &gt;&gt; DON'T FORGET THAT GOD'S KNOWLEDGE IS GREATER THAN THEIR KNOWLEDGE. DON'T FORGET THAT THERE'S A CHANNEL THAT YOU COULD FIND THE SUPERNATURAL GOD THAT WOULD TRUMP EVERYTHING THAT DOCTOR WOULD SAY. &gt;&gt; Don't forget that. Don't be intimidated by that educational system and that science when it comes and says everything in science says you're a dead man, you're a dead woman. Say, man, I Okay, I mean, you're the guys, you know better, but there's a God who knows more than them. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." WE KNOW A GOD THAT'S A SUPERNATURAL GOD, and he knows all things. His ways, &gt;&gt; Sister Isabelle, his ways are higher &gt;&gt; than our ways. &gt;&gt; His thoughts are higher than mine. They're higher than the doctors. Can I get AN AMEN TONIGHT? HIS WAYS, HIS THOUGHTS ARE HIGHER THAN THE DOCTORS. HIGHER THAN THE MOST EDUCATED MAN WITH THE HIGHEST IQ. IF THIS THING WOULD HAVE BEEN BASED UPON OUR IQ LEVEL, WE'D HAVE ALL BEEN FINISHED. &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; brother. You're saying, "Brother Paul, speak for yourself." Listen, we were to all if it was BASED UPON IQ, WE'D ALL WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A CHANCE IN the kingdom of God. IT WAS BASED UPON MONEY, all of us would have been out. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Based upon good looks, you all would have been out. And me included. &gt;&gt; Good thing it wasn't based upon good looks. Good thing it wasn't based upon how much knowledge or IQ we had. But a simple heart, predestinated seed, a response to the word of God, and a humble little Hatty, right, who had no money whatsoever, somehow tapped into pleasing God. She come into a channel. She had no education. She had no money. Her IQ wasn't that high, but she was ABLE TO PACK PACK JUST CHECK INTO THE VERY TH RIGHT TO THE VERY THRONE WHERE GOD COMES DOWN IN THAT ROOM. &gt;&gt; God asked no questions about her money or her education. NOTHING. THAT'S MY DAUGHTER AND SHE SAID THE RIGHT WORD AND I'M COMING DOWN TO GIVE HER ANYTHING she asked for. &gt;&gt; This thing ain't based upon education or science. It's based upon a heart that's really ready to be humble. &gt;&gt; I lay everything before you, my Lord, and I'm ready to receive what you have for me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The prud the prudent man lookth well to his going. It says, "The simple believeth every word, but the prudent man lookth well to his going." And so, he's using discernment. Eve didn't do that. Eve believed what she heard. She didn't She didn't even check it with the word. She didn't check it with her husband and so she was being foolish there. She didn't do it. And these two things of science and education are traced back to the Garden of Eden. We call it knowledge back there. The first one, knowledge. You'll become as gods. That's appealing to the human being to be lifted up in knowledge to know more to be as a god to to be as a god with our knowledge to be better than the next person. Then that comes in religion. that comes in the pride of of Christianity. It's crept into the message that because of all of our knowledge of all the message now it grows in pride. I'm one that believes the scripture says that knowledge puffth up but a revelation brings more humility. &gt;&gt; I said knowledge has one end. It puffs up. You get more knowledge of the message and all the mysteries. &gt;&gt; It ends in pride. You get a revelation. It makes you more humble. I don't know anything except God gives it to me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Pride exalts itself above the knowledge of God. That's what happens. And so when he told Eve, you'll be not you'll have the knowledge. You'll be as God's knowing knowing good and evil. You'll be in that position. Then it exalts itself eventually above the knowledge of God. And then later, Cain develops things to answer man's suffering, conveniences, new inventions. He began to build cities. He began to build things. He began to come up with new inventions. We're using a lot of not those things, but it's advanced now for 6,000 years. Cain was the one who developed all that. And all of it was and and even when they come to the Tower of Babel some 2,000 years later, the knowledge that they had grown into and the science that they had grown into that they come to a thought that said, "I'm never going to see this earth destroyed again by a flood so we can build something so high into the heavens &gt;&gt; that we would be able to escape the judgment again and provide our own escape from it. &gt;&gt; That's how arrogant men can get. &gt;&gt; I don't need to take God's escape from judgment. I'll build my own. And even God said, you know what? This type of knowledge, I really don't have anything to stop it except to confound their language that they can't understand one another. There was nothing that could be done. Talk about knowledge reaching a level of arrogance, but also power. &gt;&gt; We're going to build this tower so we can when the judgments come, we can run up there. When it looks like the judgment has come, we can run up there. And if God doesn't, we can run back down. And we're creating this ourselves. We're doing this ourselves. Now, I can I'm talking about 4,000 years ago, but don't underestimate our minds of how we create our own ways. to get out of things. &gt;&gt; You listening? Don't underestimate your own knowledge that you find your own way to get out of something instead of seeking God's way. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So, science and education are always learning more. And brother Bram's going to say here in a few minutes and I'll end with all the quotes because I've been preaching here. But science and education are always [cough] they're [clears throat] always learning more, but they're also always correcting themselves. God doesn't do that. First time he answers, it's the right answer. &gt;&gt; But that's a How can you trust science when they were were telling us years ago, don't dare eat that because you're going to get cancer from that. And now just 20 years later said, "You better eat that. That's good for you." &gt;&gt; That's the problem with science. &gt;&gt; Can't trust it &gt;&gt; because it's always changing and it's it's always correcting itself. But not God. He knew and has always known. God has always known what the needs of man are. God always knows the way that he can deliver man. and he never changes his way to get to that. His ways are timeless because they're for the human being to find freedom. &gt;&gt; Now, here's some quotes from over 30 paragraphs in there. I don't have time to read all those tonight. That's how many that's how much section is dedicated to um really taking a stab at science and education. And I just pulled out a few of them and you'll just catch the main thing. So now if a man follows this for his answer, it ends in death. Remember that scripture I gave as a base tonight. It takes a while with science and education. But it will always want to eventually want to be the full replacement for God's provided way. Don't forget, hold on with those. Always remember that science and education, as good as it is, as as the good things it brings, and if you get an education, that's great. But always remember that will it will eventually want to replace God's provided way in your life. &gt;&gt; It's going to come to that. &gt;&gt; It's going to come to that. Our educational system, that's why we have a a nation full of communism. Brother Bram said in 1954 we're we're ate up with communism but it's increased more and how to increase the educational system. It's been taught and communism is a godless culture. So it's taught godlessness to the place that say I defy God. I defy how God's made me. God said I was a man. I'm going to say I'm a woman. It's a defiance of God. It's a defiance of God's creation. and it's been taught in the schools. And so I hate to I hate to send kids to colleges and things like that. I just say parents just be very choosy with your young person where they choose to go because this stuff is just perverted with little seeds of thought that plant against a supernatural God, against the ways of God, against the principles of God. It's so subtle and I just that's all I'll say about it. But in some ways I I wish I would have even did something different. Um but it just it [clears throat] just it's not to be trusted. It's not to be trusted. It is godless and it eventually plant so many things in the mind. So brother Bram says here look now let us look what science and education has brought us to. And that's the very thing that man accepted instead of the word of God as scientific approval. And science has always have to take back what they said. That's the problem. You can't trust it. Science always has to take back what they said. Some of them are backtracking in the last few days about the big push for global warming that they push so much and it's, you know, it's going to be over. I think they said 2005 Al Gore said if we continue at this pace in 10 years it everything will be completely gone. Well, we're you know 20 years past that and we're still here. So that's not the only reason although there's some truth to man destroying the earth himself. It's that man tries to to interpret that himself when it's going to be. So man does destroy himself. There's a truth to that. But you see now people are having to take back what they said because science is not perfect. I like the science that keeps coming back and showing that our God lives. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But in most cases it's not going to do that. Now what is brother Brandon says now what has science brought to us? You may be shocked just for a moment. Science has brought to us sickness, death, and diseases. Now you're only been taught one. You've only been taught one side of the picture, but there's two sides to it. And that's what basically what why he's saying this to education and science. There's two sides to it. And we've only been presented the one side, the good side. There's two sides. You say, "Science has invented this, that, and the other." Well, we're going to grant you that privilege. But let's look at the other side. Science has brought us sickness. Science has brought us diseases, death. Look, scientific hybriding has brought death to the generation of foods and things. It's got the people so soft and so until the man and woman are made up of a bunch of muck and there's no structure in it. It's become a bunch of soft jellyfish. They can't live without an air conditioner. They they perish. They can't play a baseball game. If one of them gets tapped somewhere, it kills them in the boxing rings and what more? And it's so soft till men and women, well, it's perverting them. who's using food. He goes on later in the quotes, they're injecting what they're injecting into our cattle. Um they're they're spraying on the farm fields. They're spraying what he called DDT. And uh I the reason they have DDT is because you can't pronounce the full word. Uh but I looked it up and that was developed at the first of the modern synthetic insecticides in the 1940s. It was initially used with great effect to combat malaria and typhus and other insectborn human diseases among both military and civilian populations. But DDT commonly known as is commonly known is a colorless, tasteless and almost odorless crystalline chemical compound only originally developed as an insecticide. It became inf uh it became famous or infamous for its environmental impacts. DDT affects the nervous system. So now they're saying what brother Bram said here is that basically when this come out it's going to be a good thing. It's supposed to spray this on the plants and this is going to help get rid of certain diseases. But I I thought it was interesting that this particular uh thing they talked about is it just reminded me of the devil's ways. It's colorless. It's tasteless, &gt;&gt; odorless. Isn't that the enemy? &gt;&gt; That you can't detect the damage that it's going to do. You can't smell it. Young person, I hope you're listening. Can't smell it. It's colorless. You can't detect it. And yet, it's a destructive thing to the human body. And they begin to put that in the fields. Listen, I remember when did we here in Toledo couldn't use our water for about a week and couldn't even shower with it and you know so and then all the water went out couldn't get water in the city and you know what they said that the farm fields draining off into Lake Erie and different places and because all the pesticides and so that affected the water so I'm going wow you know you think you got pure water and even the farm fields well I'm already getting that from the vegetables and everything else so they put all this stuff in and brother Brandham comments on the cattle, comments in the spring. He's way ahead of his time because all this stuff starts to happen and it actually is killing the people. Uh people have he says DDT affects the nervous system. Here we are this age. People who have accidentally swallow large amounts of DDT become excitable and have tremors and seizures. These these effects went away after the exposure stopped. No effects were seen in people who took small daily doses of DDT by capsule for 18 months. I'm going to say that's a lie because that's probably worse over time to take small capsules daily uh of uh you know strick nine or whatever. It's it's it's bad for you. It's it kills. He speaks brother Brandon speaks and and I'm just not reading all the quotes but you read it. He speaks about our eggs. He speaks about the effect on our milk. uh he he the run the the the the farmers what they're spraying on. [clears throat] So and then he goes on to say look it's caused the genes the next one it's caused the genes between the man and the woman to weaken the physical weakness of the human being through the genes and the increase of children is around 30%. Mongolian is on the great climb and these weak weakness and what he's mentioning here. We have a bunch of other things that's come from all this stuff, &gt;&gt; you know, just a lot of other problems and diseases and these weakness of interbreeding of the foods that we are eating for life is weakening the body which causes cancer, mental troubles and all kinds of diseases is setting in upon the human body because it's weakness. scientific destroying themselves, getting away from God's plan. &gt;&gt; That's why he's warning us on it because on a spiritual level, science and education can destroy the soul, but on a natural level, this is destroying our bodies. How many years we've been feeding on this stuff? &gt;&gt; You see, so science, we think, oh, this is great. We got everything new and this is going to help and everything, but in the long run, sometimes it doesn't help. And then he ends it by saying, 'But notice what's that doing? We're getting away from God's plan. Notice what's that's doing. Science has brought death, sickness, and destruction. Goes on to say later in the message, so you see when God constructed a man in the first place, he was immune from any disease. That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, but unbelief and science, science and education was the first thing that took man away from God. And it's still taking him. &gt;&gt; Not just your body, but your but your soul to believe. &gt;&gt; Believe in science and go. It's going to take you away from the channel of believing God properly. Isn't this wonderful? Then he goes on about education a little bit. I won't read all these but he says when he talks about education lean not to your own understanding he's not against education we he said those things but it leads to a godless culture and he goes on to say here in uh paragraph 111 now we realize that it was that that it was it was uh that it was reason common reasonings that started the ball rolling of sin at the first place it was reasoning what reasoning is against the word of God he's talking about Eve when God told Adam and Eve the day you eat there of that day you die That's settled. That's all of it. And he fortified them against the enemy behind his word. But when Eve, listening to Satan's reasonings, you see, culture, understanding, education, advancement. Thank God for a prophet who warns us about these things. Why? Because we think, well, I'm a believer, you know, I'm not against advancement. Bettering things, making it better, making it more professional. But you see now we have to always be aware that in that can be a trap. &gt;&gt; It's okay. You don't have to say amen. &gt;&gt; In that building something and using the world's means to do it and or building into a greater business and and using the world's knowledge to do that. Be careful because it always leads you away from the kernels of real things. Relationship with God, the channel with God. every time it will want to lead away from it'll lead you to symbolism over substance &gt;&gt; then now your your belief in God becomes a symbol but there's no substance to it there's no relationship with God &gt;&gt; amen so culture understanding education advancement she stepped out behind there listened to Satan's reasoning and did the thing that God said don't do it goes on to say we got two churches at this at hand this morning one of them is the church of Pentecost, excuse me, that was organized at Pentecost by the Holy Spirit. The second is the church of the Roman Catholic which was organized in Naia Rome. I think brother Rap was on this a couple weeks ago. One of them is spiritual birth. The other one is an intellectual membership. So I want you to catch that now. Now he's bringing the educational thing. When Satan brings it into Christianity or brings it into the church, he create he he he makes another church based upon intellectual conception of God &gt;&gt; instead of instead of and he's going to say it this way next. One is based on spiritual discernment. The other one is based on educational and intellectual conception. So there's only two churches. Now we're talking not the world. Now we're talking about within Christianity, there's two churches. One's based upon intellect and education of God. And the other one is based upon discernment, spiritual discernment of God. Praise the Lord. That's why education can so lead us astray when we're trying to get to God through the way of education. Now, I believe in training. I believe in teaching. I believe the Holy Ghost is a teacher. I believe God puts teachers in the church to teach us. I believe the mind is the womb to the soul. &gt;&gt; So I believe God can start bringing things and planting seeds in your mind. Then he drops it in your heart by revelation. So I don't believe we should just say, "Well, I'm just waiting on a revelation. I don't have to read my Bible or be in the message." And I don't think you should do that. I think you should gain the knowledge of God. But we should never depend on the knowledge that we have of God &gt;&gt; to get us into the rapture, to get us into a supernatural God to bring help in our lives. It's got to be something deeper. &gt;&gt; So I want to be that true church that lives by the discernment by the spirit of God &gt;&gt; and not an intellectual conception. You need to ask yourself this question. Is this message, is this Christ just an intellectual conception? Because that's just knowledge and education. You need something deeper. Young people, you need something deeper. You might have a a message conscience. &gt;&gt; You grew up in the message and so you have a message conscience. It's been formed by the message. Praise God. But go up against the devil one time in temptation. See if that's enough. It's got to be deeper than that. Education about Christ is not enough to go against demons. &gt;&gt; Shouting and praising the Lord at camp is not enough to go up against demons. An emotional speaking in tongues is not enough to go up against the devil. &gt;&gt; It takes a temple that's filled with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It takes your soul filled with the Holy Ghost. It takes more than psychology. You can't bring a person through psychology into the realities of a supernatural God. You can't bring them through psychology. You can have it where it diagnoses the problem and helps you diagnose the problem. But God, the great psychologist. Oh boy, I'm going to get in trouble now. God the greatest. How many believe he's a great physician? &gt;&gt; Well, he's the great psychologist, too. He knows human behavior better than anybody. And when you tap into the great psychologist, he can diagnose your life, your past, and your case better than anyone will do it. &gt;&gt; You get into that channel, God just reveals it. And now you see what the problem is. You see what the answer is in is you see that God cares. You care to get deliverance. And as I said at the beginning of this series, you bring those two things together and someone's in between trying to put out his hand helping you and pray with you. But you bring a person who cares about deliverance and the God who cares, something connects. Something is going to happen &gt;&gt; that's going to be a real change. &gt;&gt; It's not up here. Say, "I think I got it. I think I'm okay." No, you're going to know that God has stepped in. &gt;&gt; One is based upon spiritual discernment. The other one is based upon educational and intellectual conceptions. That's where he deals with the education. Most of what he talks about in education is that coming into the church where we're going to educate somebody into it. No, you don't do that. We train, we teach our children, we train, we plant the seeds. I'm I'm for all that. But ultimately, they have to get into the channel of a new birth, finding the new birth. And also, they have to yield their vessel. They have to really find the true God by spiritual discernment. So, science and education, I'm I'm wrapping it up here now. Science and education are both ways that seem right. They seem right, but the end is death. And brother Random takes over 30 paragraphs to show us, don't you dare use as your dependence for answers on science and education, whether it's for the body. And I want to say again, I I believe as brother Brandon balanced it out said, you know, thank God for these medicines. Thanks God for the the doctors who help people. Thank God for Christian doctors who point to the dependence being on God. If you can find one, that's even greater. I thank God for it. But I will never You see the problem with depending on it holy is it's like the Leoian generation where it says I'm rich and increase with goods. This is the church now. I have need of nothing. And he said you're miserable, poor, blind, and naked. So you're in a state but you think in your richness and you know everything and I have here this is the trap I have need of nothing. What that means is is that Leodysa takes the people of God and removes all of their need to pray. &gt;&gt; I'm good. I'm laidback. I'm a Christian. I I I got my doctors. I got my medicine. I've got this long-term disease that the doctors told me I'm going to have it for life and I've got the medicine to help me for the rest of my life. I'm good. I don't have to pray. I need a new vehicle. I don't have to pray. Uh Ford will give it to me on time. The layaway plan, you know, you pay for it till they lay you away. &gt;&gt; And so Leo, see, it just it's got all these convenient. It removes all of your need to go to God for anything. Right? &gt;&gt; You don't need to pray because you just run and you get this, you get the medicine. I'm saying there's nothing wrong with things helping us. But when we're falling into the trap of we don't go to God first, we're falling into the trap that Brother Brandham is warning us of. &gt;&gt; We're not depending on a supernatural God &gt;&gt; to call him on the scene. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So now I want to read this. Now that we've talked about the the science and education, look what he says here. this and I've probably quoted this over and over again. God's provided way is [clears throat] repentance, confession, and showing a results, bringing forth fruit, meet for repentance, showing sincerity. That pretty well sums it up. And I wanted to say that with science, education, or any other thing in this world, if any of that takes away from this way to get to God, that's your enemy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Cuz this is the channel. And I'm telling you, this is the channel. You can go to all the counselors in the world and if you don't have these elements, then you're not showing you care that you really want help because it's in these true sincere elements. If those are there and they're working sincerely, God works with these elements and he opens up a way for freedom and deliverance. &gt;&gt; Science and education will begin to belittle that and say, "No, you don't need to do that. You don't need to confess. You don't need to repent. Where'd you hear that from? We've got the way here. We've got the medicine. We've got we've got a program you can go through. You see, and I'm not against something helps somebody. Once again, I love the quote that brother Jack Duff found. He said, "God is for anything that helps human beings." In other words, anything that helps the human race, we thank God for it. &gt;&gt; Why would you want to condemn that? &gt;&gt; That's not the That's not the trap of it. is that that we condemn everything that's no no it's it's that if we choose that as the al that Satan makes it the alternative to this path here &gt;&gt; and when your education gets you so prideful that you can't repent anymore. &gt;&gt; You can't find the way &gt;&gt; when your science gets you to the place that you don't want to confess and you don't want and you're hiding and this next Wednesday we'll never get into it again. I thought I was done with the series. I'm not done yet because we've got to explore what all those things mean. &gt;&gt; And the reason is Satan fights against these so much is Satan likes to hide. &gt;&gt; When Adam and Eve fell, they sewed fig leaves together to hide their nakedness. And brother Bram says that our our our covering is our religion. So it's covering in a certain thing, but it's not God's way of covering. And the reason they cover themselves is to hide because they didn't want to come out. And and our tendency is to hide. So when of our tendency is to hide, we don't like anything like this. Satan's going to get us to hide it. We're too scared to confess it. Is that understandable? Everything that Satan develops is going to be eventually working against these things. And if somebody who needs God more and wants to come out of religion and wants to come out of their upbringing, the message that was wrong, they want to come out of anything that from a a smoking habit to a porn habit to whatever it is to just outright uh uh maybe a person's a maniac in a prison. Okay, there's a way out. &gt;&gt; There's a way. God says there's a way &gt;&gt; and it's not through psychology. When you start to get sincerely into these channels and God knows you care, God starts to work in these things. &gt;&gt; Because he cares. Do you care? Anytime anything takes these elements away, it will never work. Science and education try to eliminate these things. You don't need to do that. [clears throat] When you do, you deceive man away from the channel of true help of the true channel of the true way. You say, "Well, Jesus said, "I'm the way, the truth, and the life." Yeah, he is. He is the answer. How many believe Jesus is the answer? I've always said it this way is that Jesus not only has the answer, he is the answer. &gt;&gt; That's a big difference because we're always looking, Lord, help. Lord, give me an answer. Lord, give me an answer. But you see, he is the answer. When you embrace him and you turn your life over to him to repentance and confession, everything's on the table. God, I'm all yours. I don't know how this is going to go. Remember the woman that had to confess to her husband what she had done and her husband had to confess. SHE SAID, "DON'T SAY THAT. DON'T OH, PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT. UH IT'LL END EVERYTHING." AND and brother Bram says, "BUT YEAH, YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO END ANYWAY. It's going to be over anyway." SHE WAS SCARED TO COME INTO that confession. Right? &gt;&gt; But you see on the other side is such a victory. &gt;&gt; And when whoever it is, they come into this one simple place. God begins to show his power and begins to work and he steps in. He says, "I see there's a depth of sincerity. This isn't a mental exercise. This isn't a mental counseling exercise. They've dropped to a deeper depth of sincerity and repentance and confession. They're not afraid anymore to trust God. Friends, I've seen it whether it's here at an altar, just seen it if we had praying for young people last week at the camp and the differences in people would come and they just I guess I can speak because I don't know I didn't know most of their names. They come and for you about hour and a half they had them coming up to the ministers and everyone just just con and and when you see that young boy and he actually falls in weeping because he's bound by pornography and he falls to his knees and he says I'm telling it's the first time I've said it to any I'm tell just to you two brothers to pray with me but I'm ready tonight to lay this completely down. I'm telling you friends, I don't know. It looks like sincerity to me, but God knows. And if that heart is ready, something supernaturally &gt;&gt; steps in &gt;&gt; and it can be done. It can be over. I serve a mighty God. &gt;&gt; I serve a supernatural God. &gt;&gt; I say I serve a God that showed me the way to a supernatural God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we're not limited tonight. We're not intimidated by people that are smarter than us. We're not intimidated by the educational system and the the mega churches and they seem more successful. I don't care about any of that. I want to find that channel for lives to be changed, my life to be changed. &gt;&gt; We serve a mighty God tonight. I believe we agree. Hallelujah. Well, this was this was enjoyable tonight. I enjoyed being here at church. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Let's stand together and give our Lord praise. Let's give him a hand tonight. God is good. Hallelujah. What a mighty God we serve. Come on, singing it. Oh, what a mighty God we serve. Yeah. Angels bow before him. Heaven and earth adore. Well, what a mighty God we serve. I want to hear you singing now. Yeah. What a mighty God, sir. Yeah. What a mighty God we serve. Oh, angels bow [music] before him. Heaven and earth adore. Oh, what a mighty [music and singing] God we serve. Jesus is the God [music and singing] we serve. Jesus is the God we serve. Amen. Yeah. Angels [singing and music] bow before him. Heaven and earth adore. Oh, Jesus is the [music and singing] God. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Oh, what a mighty [music] God we serve. What a mighty God. What a mighty God we serve. Angels [music] bow before him. Heaven and earth adore him. What a mighty [music] God we serve. Jesus is the God we serve. Jesus [music] is the God we serve. Angels for him. Heaven and earth adore him. What a mighty [music and singing] God. One more time. What a mighty God. What a mighty God [music and singing] we serve. What a mighty God we serve. Amen. Angels bow before him. [music] Heaven and earth adore. Oh, what a [singing] mighty God we serve. [music] Praise God. I'm a member of [singing] the blood. Wash back. I've been washed in the soul cleansing blood of the lamb. I [music] was bound by chains of sin till one day the master came and he made me a member of it. Aren't you glad tonight to be a member of that band? Praise God. I'm [singing] a member [music] of the blood wash. I've been washed in the soul cleansing blood of the lamb. I was bound by chains of sin till one day [music] the master came. Maybe a member of man. We're a band of [music] Christian soldiers fighting Satan [singing] every day. We're standing up for Jesus [music] while we're kneeling down to pray. If his precious blood has cleansed you and washed away your sin, that makes you a member of the blood wash. [music] Oh, praise God. I'm a member. Hallelujah. I've been washed [music] in the soul with the blood [singing] of the lamb. Well, I was [music] bound by chain of sin. Till one day the master came, made me a member of the blood wash band. Just before we go, God's children are advancing, marching till we [music] reach the door. For the battle's almost over, we'll soon be going home. I can hear the sounds [music] of angels as the saints go marching [singing] in. Sing praises to the captain of the bloody [music] waters man. Praise God. [singing] I'm a member of the blood [music] washed Mary. I am washed in the soy blood [singing] of the lamb. I was bound by [music] Jesus sill. One day the master came to make me a member of the blood [music] washing man. Everybody said amen. Praise the Lord. It's real. Our God is real. Praise. Welcome home on Sister Jane. God bless you. You come in and Bo and Miriam take off to Mexico. So, amen. It's good to have all of you here tonight. If we think about these things [music] in our everyday life, let's learn to drop to the real level of sincerity and prayer when something comes up and and things come up. If things are not coming up in your life, please come and tell me what you're doing because things come up. But we have to learn this thing of entering into this real depth of sincerity to show to show the Lord. I don't want this to just be a surface response to [music] this. I don't want it to be a quick prayer over dinner. God is great. God is good. Let us thank him for this foot. But we enter in and God knows that listen, we have a channel here we can get in for this need. This baby's got a fever. This this marriage in our family is is troubled. God, it's affecting my heart. Lord, I'm going before you as a son and daughter of God. You're the high priest of [music] our confection. Is that what he said? He's the high priest of our kids. So he brother Bram says he acts upon our confession and if we're dropping into the sincerity we're take is saying Lord this is I want to find that channel Lord where you [music] take over. We we can't be insincere with it. We have to we have to say, Lord, I I I want to show you. I I I believe that you're able to do this. And I'm sincerely asking for you to do it. And I I if there's anything in my life, remove it, Lord. Just take it from my but I'm coming in faith now. And I believe with all my heart you're able. Let's not just let the preachers do it. Let's not just say, "I need to get to the preacher." Let's every young person here tonight, every person, no matter how long you've been serving the Lord, even if it's just been a short time, recognize that this is something Hadley Wright and probably never didn't think she was worthy of it. This is something for me. This is a channel that he's purchased that I can get into when the preacher is not around. I can pray and that prayer can get through and and bombard heaven. Praise the Lord. God bless y'all tonight. You're dismissed in Jesus [music] name. Amen. Isabelle, why don't you play us something nice nice as we go? Your ways are higher than mine.
