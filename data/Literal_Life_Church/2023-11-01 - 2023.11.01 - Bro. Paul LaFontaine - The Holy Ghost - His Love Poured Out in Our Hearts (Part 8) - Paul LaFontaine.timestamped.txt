[29:35] study just uh looking at the attributes

[29:40] legacy uh for your family it's just been
[29:42] real good good study so we'll be here
[29:44] tomorrow night doing that at 7:30 and
[29:46] then don't forget on Sunday it's
[29:48] daylight savings
[29:50] time which I I enjoy it because I get an
[29:53] extra hour of sleep Saturday nights an
[29:55] extra hour to study as well but uh uh
[29:58] one thing about it if you forget it
[30:00] that's why I'm reminding you if you
[30:01] forget it um you're going to be to
[30:03] church early Sunday morning which
[30:05] wouldn't be a bad thing at all I mean
[30:08] you're not going to get anybody uh if
[30:11] you come an hour early the pastor is
[30:12] going to be going wow this is great
[30:14] praise the Lord so uh in the spring when
[30:17] you have daylight s then you're late an
[30:19] hour for church if you miss it but but
[30:21] we're announcing announcing it tonight
[30:23] so you don't miss it let's let's turn to
[30:24] Matthew chapter 24 in our Bibles and
[30:27] we'll do a study together tonight in the
[30:29] word of God I know that we're hungry for
[30:32] his word and uh we live by it Jesus said
[30:36] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[30:38] every word most of us have had supper
[30:41] whatever you ate we had spaghetti at
[30:42] home and so but Jesus said man shall not
[30:45] live by bread alone but by every word
[30:47] that proceeds out of the mouth of God so
[30:50] we spiritually live by his word and feed
[30:52] on his word so we're happy to have that
[30:54] tonight and be able to present it to you
[30:56] and we're going to read from Matthew
[30:57] chapter
[30:59] 24 and start reading in verse four and
[31:01] the setting here is some actually some
[31:04] prophecy of Jesus as he talks about our
[31:06] times and our conditions of our time
[31:09] there's several places that he talks
[31:11] about that but I want to just hone in on
[31:13] this section here on Wars uh verse four
[31:16] of chapter 24 and Jesus answered and
[31:18] said unto them take heed that no man
[31:20] deceive you for many shall come in my
[31:23] name saying I am Christ and shall
[31:25] deceive many so we learn something about
[31:28] the end time that Jesus said and that is
[31:31] it'll be a time of deception there'll be
[31:33] many false Christ come and false
[31:36] anointed ones and faults that are meant
[31:38] to deceive people so uh I always like to
[31:41] say though that if there's false Christ
[31:43] if there's something false there has to
[31:45] be a real for them to make the false off
[31:47] of Amen so uh you can't have a
[31:50] counterfeit dollar unless you have a
[31:53] real dollar for it to go off of so thank
[31:56] God that we have the the real living
[31:57] Christ here tonight the word uh this is
[32:00] not a deception but it's the real Christ
[32:02] and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of
[32:06] wars see that you be not troubled for
[32:08] all these things must come to pass but
[32:11] the end is not yet for nation shall rise
[32:14] against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom
[32:17] and there shall be famines and
[32:18] pestilences and earthquakes in diverse
[32:21] places now it doesn't take very much
[32:23] discernment to know this is exactly
[32:25] what's going on in our times the last 40
[32:28] 50 years and especially the last 10
[32:30] years what Jesus said is happening
[32:33] before our very eyes and these are all
[32:37] the beginning of Sorrows then shall they
[32:39] deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[32:41] kill you and you shall be hated of all
[32:44] Nations for my name's sake and then
[32:46] shall many be offended and shall betray
[32:49] one another and shall hate one another
[32:53] what a time to live in and many false
[32:56] prophets shall rise
[32:57] and shall deceive many so you have false
[32:59] Christ now you have false prophets if
[33:02] you have false prophets there has to be
[33:04] something real for them to make that off
[33:06] of verse 12 and because iniquity shall
[33:09] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[33:13] but he that shall endure until the end
[33:16] the same shall be saved how many wants
[33:19] to endure until the end if it puts it in
[33:21] there somebody's going to endure all
[33:23] this Wars rumors of wars being hated can
[33:26] you say person persecution but
[33:28] somebody's going to endure it Jesus said
[33:29] he that shall endure to the end shall be
[33:31] saved and this Gospel of the Kingdom
[33:34] shall be preached in all the world for a
[33:36] witness unto all nations and then shall
[33:39] the End come now I'd like to add one
[33:41] more scripture before we sit down
[33:43] because I'll refer refer to it at the
[33:44] end if you don't mind one more in Romans
[33:47] chapter 5 and verse 5 just one verse
[33:51] there because we want to plant that in
[33:53] our minds so we can have in our minds
[33:54] for this study tonight Romans chap 5 and
[33:58] verse
[34:00] 5 and hope maketh not ashamed because
[34:05] the love of God is shed abroad in our
[34:07] hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
[34:11] unto us I want to read it again hope
[34:13] maketh not ashamed in other words that
[34:15] means the hope and the promise of God
[34:18] you will never be
[34:21] disappointed now are we disappointed in
[34:23] governments today are we disappointed
[34:25] with politics are we you disappointed
[34:27] that Nations Rising against Nation uh do
[34:30] people disappoint you there's a lot of
[34:32] things that disappoint us but the
[34:34] promise of God will never disappoint you
[34:38] it says it says here in verse 5 we just
[34:41] finished Romans 5 verse 5 I reading
[34:43] again hope maketh not ashamed because
[34:45] the love of God is poured out shed
[34:48] abroad in our hearts by what by the Holy
[34:51] Ghost which is given unto us father we
[34:54] pray you'll bless your word tonight may
[34:56] we we stand behind it Lord with all of
[34:58] our hearts may we trust it father I pray
[35:01] that Lord you will Minister and you show
[35:03] up tonight and show your presence among
[35:05] us we pray we've worshiped you we've
[35:08] given our hearts to you Lord and just to
[35:10] express how much we love you tonight
[35:11] that's what worship is all about Lord
[35:14] now you come and just speak through your
[35:15] word and teach us something father and
[35:18] stabilize us in your word tonight we
[35:20] pray we pray give that you'll you'll get
[35:23] glory for all that's taking place here
[35:25] tonight in Jesus name amen God bless you
[35:28] may be
[35:29] seated there's several places that Jesus
[35:32] is specific of the conditions for our
[35:35] time and that is the last days and so
[35:37] here is he gets very specific about
[35:39] certain things and uh I'm glad tonight
[35:42] that I can say that I'm not in the dark
[35:45] about what's going on in the news and
[35:48] we're not in the dark because Jesus
[35:50] speaks of it here Jesus knew what was
[35:53] going to happen and Jesus prophesies the
[35:55] people that are going to live live in
[35:57] the end times this is what they're going
[35:58] to experience and so we're not in the
[36:00] dark how many are glad tonight you're
[36:01] not in the dark about what's going on uh
[36:04] sometimes it brings fear sometimes we're
[36:06] scared but we're not in the dark because
[36:08] the word tells us this is exactly what
[36:10] would take place and so one part of our
[36:13] security though is knowing that our Lord
[36:16] warned us of all this that's happening
[36:18] in the world that's that's I want to
[36:20] talk about security a little bit tonight
[36:21] and different things but one part of our
[36:23] security is the Lord already warned us
[36:26] the Lord already said it the Lord has
[36:28] already proclaimed what's taking place
[36:31] right now and so that brings a security
[36:33] to me that God knows what's going on God
[36:36] knew from the foundation of the world he
[36:38] knew the wars and rumors of wars he knew
[36:40] Israel would be at War right now God
[36:42] knew all that I didn't know that but God
[36:44] knew that God said it in his word so it
[36:47] brings a security to me tonight to know
[36:50] without any shadow of a doubt that our
[36:52] Lord knows what's going on and then he
[36:54] speaks it in his word and it makes it
[36:56] all all the more comforting but I want
[36:58] to hone in on tonight this part about
[37:00] wars uh this is what I've been reading
[37:02] about because we know that we're in war
[37:04] now in the Middle East and it's it seems
[37:06] to be getting more tense and so I've
[37:08] been thinking about that it's it's
[37:09] actually burdened me quite a bit to see
[37:11] this because it's so much a part of end
[37:13] time events as we know the war is not so
[37:16] much around any other area of the world
[37:18] we know the Ukraine war is going on and
[37:21] but we see then when it happens around
[37:23] the Middle East then then prophecy
[37:25] starts to play in even though Jesus said
[37:28] there'll be Wars and R rumors of wars
[37:30] there'll be many wars begin to take
[37:32] place and they'll accumulate many
[37:34] earthquakes these different things
[37:35] they'll accumulate they'll get they'll
[37:37] multiply but when we have the war taking
[37:40] place where it's at now and possibly
[37:41] growing then any Bible reader knows that
[37:45] there's something significant about this
[37:47] because there's too many prophecies that
[37:49] talk about this mounting and ending in a
[37:52] war around the Middle East and
[37:53] surrounding Israel so now that's very
[37:56] important to to us but uh Jesus says
[37:59] here that uh about the wars you will
[38:01] hear of it and that it that in itself
[38:04] sometimes just hearing of War can be
[38:06] unsettling to us how many would say
[38:08] Amen just hearing of War can be
[38:11] unsettling to the individual it is
[38:14] unsettling and uh then then Jesus says
[38:17] you shall hear of Wars you shall hear
[38:20] rumors of wars but then he says but see
[38:23] that you're not troubled about it amen
[38:27] see that your heart is not troubled so
[38:30] so living in the middle of this and
[38:32] hearing or watching it on the news or
[38:35] seeing these things take place it it can
[38:37] bring the reason Jesus said that is that
[38:39] it can bring a troubled heart but Jesus
[38:41] is saying I don't want you to have a
[38:43] troubled heart I don't want you to live
[38:45] in fear now tonight I want to get to the
[38:48] reason why Jesus saying that because if
[38:50] our Lord says don't be troubled when you
[38:53] hear these things happen don't be
[38:55] nervous don't be afraid that our Lord
[38:58] has to provide some type of source that
[39:01] our hearts would be calmed during this
[39:03] time I would say that to the Lord Lord
[39:06] if you said don't be troubled then what
[39:08] are you going to give me so I won't be
[39:10] troubled because if I'm on my own my
[39:13] heart's
[39:14] scared my heart's
[39:16] troubled the wars and rumors of wars and
[39:19] all the conditions and the and the
[39:20] things mounting up in the in the world
[39:22] conditions the way they are your heart
[39:24] is going to be troubled but our Lord
[39:25] says a as we see it don't let your heart
[39:28] be troubled so if our Lord says don't be
[39:30] troubled in other places he says it many
[39:33] times let not your hearts be troubled
[39:36] let not now Jesus must be living himself
[39:39] in a place of perfect faith that even
[39:42] when he hit certain persecutions and
[39:46] pressure was coming on him and there's
[39:48] so many incidences in the four gospels
[39:50] that we could go to now but Jesus lived
[39:52] in a realm of perfect Faith he was calm
[39:54] all the time he never got up upset at
[39:56] what was happening to him Jesus was on a
[39:59] ship one time and there was a big storm
[40:01] and all the disciples are scared to
[40:02] death you know what Jesus is doing he's
[40:05] sleeping he's sleeping during a storm
[40:08] and the disciples wake him up and said
[40:09] Lord don't you care that there's a storm
[40:12] we're all going to die here there
[40:13] something's going to happen and and you
[40:15] know what he said to him oh ye of little
[40:16] faith he wasn't worried at all by the
[40:20] storm he wasn't worried about the wars
[40:22] he wasn't worried about demons coming up
[40:25] against him he stood faithful in his
[40:27] realm of perfect Faith he knew who he
[40:30] was he knew where he stood and there
[40:32] wasn't any demon power or any storm that
[40:35] could ever destroy his life until God
[40:37] said so glory be to God I want wherever
[40:42] Jesus was living I want to live there
[40:45] whatever Faith Jesus was partaking of I
[40:47] want that every day in my life perfect
[40:50] Faith Masters every
[40:54] circumstance and guess what what we can
[40:57] live there because he says where I am
[40:59] you can be also we need it so Jesus is
[41:03] there and and and he saying don't let
[41:04] your heart be troubled in other places
[41:06] he says it and uh he wouldn't say that
[41:10] unless he could provide for us something
[41:12] or someplace that we can go for strength
[41:16] for Hope for peace all of these are are
[41:19] things that we seek after I appreciated
[41:21] the songs tonight they didn't know what
[41:22] I was going to preach but the songs
[41:24] living by faith peace of God cover me
[41:27] they're all songs related to what I was
[41:29] going to preach on the Lord must be
[41:31] wanting to tell us
[41:33] something amen so but God has to provide
[41:39] some place or something in these times
[41:42] for our strength for Our Hope For Peace
[41:47] for security can you say amen he could
[41:50] not say uh you know when you begin to
[41:53] feel uh insecure when you feel these
[41:56] insecurities come from the wars and from
[41:58] the pressure and and people hating you
[42:00] when you start to feel that then just
[42:02] maybe go uh through some mental
[42:04] exercises and it'll help you out he
[42:07] didn't say
[42:09] that uh I feel good I feel great I feel
[42:13] wonderful I feel good I feel great I
[42:16] feel wonderful and you just convince
[42:18] yourself you're doing your calming your
[42:19] nerves Jesus didn't say
[42:22] that uh he didn't say uh take up some
[42:25] extra yoga
[42:26] classes when it gets real bad in the
[42:29] world to calm your nerves take some
[42:30] extra yoga classes he didn't stay take
[42:34] more pills he didn't say that here when
[42:36] you hit that last days in all the wars
[42:39] he didn't say try to find more pills he
[42:41] didn't say that not against pills if
[42:43] they help a person but he didn't say he
[42:46] didn't say that he he he's got to give
[42:48] us something greater than a pill can you
[42:50] say man greater than a yoga class he
[42:53] didn't he didn't say go buy yourself
[42:55] something real nice and spend a lot of
[42:56] money on yourself so you can call calm
[42:58] your nerves he didn't say take a few
[43:00] days and binge watch Star Wars
[43:05] series of course he didn't say
[43:08] that this will Cal you nurse he didn't
[43:11] say any of that but I if he said don't
[43:14] be troubled he must be providing
[43:17] something deeper than a
[43:19] movie to calm our nerves you know why I
[43:23] say that you know why I say it because
[43:25] Americans and the world have so many
[43:27] things to calm their nerves but in these
[43:29] conditions it's going to take more than
[43:31] a movie it's going to take more than
[43:33] binge watching some series it's going to
[43:35] take some source that God provides by
[43:38] the holy spirit that we can feed on and
[43:41] we can rest on to calm our nerves and
[43:43] say I know where I stand in this hour I
[43:46] am not
[43:47] afraid and whatever comes my way
[43:50] whatever our way our country would
[43:51] change in the next because I I don't
[43:53] think Life as we know it is going to
[43:55] continue the same I meant to say that
[43:57] Sunday I think we're in a spot things
[43:59] will not continue as convenient as we've
[44:02] always had them our life will become
[44:05] more inconvenienced I do believe that
[44:08] question is where do you
[44:10] stand do you have God in your heart when
[44:13] this is all Stripped Away what do you
[44:16] have in your
[44:17] heart when it's all gone when you you
[44:20] say well I got Security in my job no no
[44:22] you don't not really I got Security in
[44:25] who's going to be the next president not
[44:27] really there's nobody can fix these
[44:30] problems because God God knows the hour
[44:33] that we have because he knows the hour
[44:35] and the trouble that it can cause our
[44:37] hearts he provides something deeper than
[44:39] this world he says I give you peace not
[44:42] as the world gives I give peace but I
[44:44] will give you
[44:46] peace so now I want to say something
[44:49] about war here okay because uh we we
[44:53] have to know some things about war when
[44:54] we hear of War the the war in Israel war
[44:59] comes
[45:01] because hate
[45:04] increases so he had to have the word in
[45:06] there that many shall betray one another
[45:09] many shall many shall uh condemn one
[45:12] another many shall be offended many not
[45:15] it used you know we've always had people
[45:16] offended but he says many will be
[45:19] offended there'll be an increase in
[45:21] people getting offended there'll be an
[45:23] in increase in people uh maybe uh
[45:26] leaving the Church of God and leaving
[45:28] Christ there'll be an increase because
[45:30] it's too much of a nervous time and so
[45:32] they they leave Christ there'll be an
[45:34] increase in people that hate
[45:38] haters and because you have hate then
[45:42] you're going to have War because hate is
[45:44] the thing that starts War you're not
[45:46] going to have a war if you don't have
[45:48] hate more war is because we have more
[45:51] hate and there's nothing to stop it
[45:54] there's no place for go for people to go
[45:56] to relieve their hate if hate is in a
[46:00] and if hate is not resolved it leads to
[46:03] all sorts of things including War
[46:06] Nations shall rise against Nation
[46:08] kingdoms shall come against Kingdom why
[46:11] because hate and jealousy has
[46:15] increased how many can say Amen
[46:18] tonight hatred unresolved hat hatred
[46:22] hatred brewing for years
[46:26] that's why we've had a lot more fights
[46:28] that's happening even in the political
[46:30] world because all that thing is just
[46:32] festering there all that disagreement is
[46:35] all festering and so now it begins to
[46:37] come to the surface and it manifested
[46:40] hatred and then so many countries and
[46:41] Nations it manifests into a becomes a
[46:44] war but we must know where it starts it
[46:47] starts with hatred it starts with
[46:49] something festering within us against
[46:51] somebody else we can take a lesson from
[46:53] that you cannot hold on to your your
[46:57] hatred or else you become like
[47:00] them you cannot hold on to your
[47:03] resentment you cannot hold on to your
[47:05] bitterness can you say Amen you cannot
[47:08] hold on to hatred it will eat you
[47:11] up and it'll cause
[47:14] War so we learn a lesson is that when we
[47:17] come to more war we come to an
[47:19] increasing of hatred Nations rising in
[47:22] more and more being against something
[47:24] people more and more being against
[47:26] something and they're saying it I'm
[47:27] against that I'm against that and
[47:29] jealousy Rises one preacher said it a
[47:31] couple weeks ago I like what he said he
[47:32] said we preach so much about what we
[47:34] were we are against we're preaching
[47:36] about what we're against but why not
[47:38] preach what we're
[47:40] for can I get a witness there's too much
[47:43] preaching about what we're against but
[47:46] why don't we preach what we're for and
[47:48] then if somebody's hungry for more truth
[47:50] if there's a heart that's already hungry
[47:52] you don't have to force that person
[47:54] they're just being honest I'm I'm hungry
[47:56] for more truth I want God in my life I
[47:58] got to have a reality of God I got to
[48:01] have more than a religion more than a
[48:04] form more than just a baptism but
[48:07] something that puts me in touch with
[48:09] almighty
[48:11] God it's got to be more than a religion
[48:15] religion people are still
[48:17] scared but when the Holy Spirit comes in
[48:20] when the Holy Ghost comes in then it's
[48:22] this didn't he call the Holy Ghost when
[48:24] he first said it in in joh didn't he
[48:26] says I'm going to send you the Holy
[48:27] Ghost and he said it will be a
[48:31] comforter didn't he call the Holy Ghost
[48:34] a
[48:34] comforter isn't man looking for a
[48:37] comfort from things a comfort from
[48:39] pleasures and entertainments but that's
[48:41] not going to get us through these hard
[48:42] times we need a deeper comforter the
[48:46] comforter this is what he provides and
[48:48] so now if hate is increasing then we
[48:50] realize that we we even in our in our
[48:53] rank sometimes we can take this hate
[48:55] hate and be more emphasizing what we are
[48:58] against because we we grow in hatred and
[49:00] then it says many shall be offended many
[49:02] shall be betrayed many shall betray you
[49:05] and then hate and many means it'll
[49:07] increase it we've always have hatred
[49:10] we've always had from the time that Cain
[49:12] slew his brother Abel we've had a Cain
[49:14] was a murderer where did that come from
[49:16] didn't come from God Cain killed his own
[49:19] brother after the Garden Eden of Eden
[49:22] Cain that did not come from God when
[49:24] Cain killed his where did murder come
[49:26] from came from hatred how did Cain get
[49:29] the hatred why did he get jealous at his
[49:32] brother Abel so right from the very
[49:34] beginning of the Garden of Eden we've
[49:36] had hatred but he says in the end time
[49:39] many it'll increase many shall be
[49:42] offended many shall hate one another
[49:45] that's the climate that we live
[49:46] in
[49:49] hatred and I'll just say it you may be a
[49:52] Christian but if you don't stay covered
[49:55] up in the peace of God in his spirit of
[49:57] in the spirit of God some of that hatred
[50:01] will rub off on
[50:03] you some of that bitterness is trying to
[50:05] come in your heart and you get bitter
[50:07] towards the guy that's sitting next to
[50:10] you to the sister or brother sitting
[50:12] next to you you get bitter about them
[50:14] you get bitter towards your boss you get
[50:16] hatred towards your
[50:18] boss we cannot let the spirit that
[50:21] dominates this world this nation this
[50:25] end time we cannot let it into our
[50:29] heart we have to have something to
[50:31] relieve it we have to have something
[50:33] greater is anybody listening to me
[50:35] tonight we have to have something
[50:38] deeper than
[50:40] just what the world
[50:43] provides I want to read and take this
[50:45] just a step deeper
[50:47] here uh turn with me to James 41 or they
[50:50] can put it up on the screen as well just
[50:53] take this a step deeper and I won't be
[50:54] long tonight I just wanted to lay these
[50:56] things in about hatred and how we
[51:00] respond James
[51:02] chapter
[51:05] four and James is the one that we got to
[51:08] live what we preach and live what we say
[51:11] as Christians James is from Missouri the
[51:14] show me
[51:15] state he said if if you got True
[51:18] Religion he's saying show me so James
[51:21] was from M Missouri not really but I
[51:24] don't have any historical documents for
[51:26] that to prove that but he he was a a a
[51:29] show me type preacher he was a show me
[51:32] type preacher if you're a Christian show
[51:35] me the the show me the works from
[51:37] it amen show me what you got and so
[51:40] James chapter 4 verse one he says from
[51:43] whence come Wars and fightings among
[51:47] you come they not hence even of your
[51:50] lust that wore in your members so do you
[51:52] know what he says here I'm going to read
[51:53] it in the Amplified actually I'm going
[51:55] to read it in three different um three
[51:58] different uh versions I guess of the
[52:01] Bible the Amplified and a couple other
[52:02] ones because I want you to understand
[52:04] this from whence comes Wars and
[52:06] fightings among you so now we take it a
[52:09] little bit more personal it's not
[52:10] happening in Israel not happen in
[52:11] Ukraine but there can be war and strife
[52:15] that happens in your own
[52:18] home in your own
[52:20] church in your own
[52:22] family War strife
[52:26] contention what is the source but he
[52:28] says what is the source of wars and
[52:31] fights among you now come on I'm just
[52:33] going to stop in wait a minute you know
[52:35] there can be Strife happened between
[52:37] brothers and
[52:39] sisters Bo sure got quiet right
[52:42] there you know that Satan would like you
[52:44] to war against one
[52:46] another to fight against one another to
[52:49] fight against other churches and and and
[52:51] shoot you know misguided
[52:54] missiles or over the pulpit to other
[52:56] churches and you see it all goes back to
[53:00] the same Spirit of resentment and
[53:02] jealousy and hatred and their church is
[53:05] not as good as our church all that is
[53:07] there's nothing in that in the kingdom
[53:08] of God we need to get rid of all of that
[53:11] there's no perfect church can you say
[53:13] Amen there's no perfect Message Church
[53:15] there's no perfect Church anywhere there
[53:17] there's we're we're flawed individuals
[53:20] we're flawed human beings that n we all
[53:22] need the same Christ that every human
[53:26] being needs in this world and we need
[53:28] the reality of him but there isn't it's
[53:31] Baptist Pentecostal whatever Church it
[53:33] is here here Among Us it's it's it's all
[53:36] the same because people are the same we
[53:38] need the same God we need the same word
[53:41] that comes from the Lord but you see now
[53:44] he says now so we're all admitting now
[53:46] we can have wars among us we can have
[53:47] Strife in our own home a marriage could
[53:50] have Strife a marriage could have
[53:52] War until there's a divorce right
[53:55] sometimes irreconcilable differences and
[53:57] it's because you had War for 20 years in
[53:59] your marriage somebody said let's just
[54:01] stop the war that's it it's over instead
[54:03] of clinging to Christ to try to get an
[54:04] answer and so you have war in a marriage
[54:07] you can have war in a home you can have
[54:08] war with your children you can have stri
[54:11] Strife that happens among you even in
[54:13] the church but here's what he says in a
[54:14] couple places what is the source read it
[54:16] with me uh James 4:1 and I'll read it in
[54:18] this version here what is the source of
[54:21] wars and fights among you don't they
[54:24] come from your passion that wage war
[54:26] within you what is the source of
[54:29] conflict among you what is the source of
[54:31] your disputes don't they come from your
[54:34] Cravings or that are at war in your own
[54:37] lives what is causing all the quars and
[54:39] fights among you isn't it your desires
[54:42] battling inside
[54:45] you so there's a truth here in Scripture
[54:48] that we must admit that if you're
[54:51] complaining about strife and War among
[54:53] you in your home in your family in your
[54:56] church the first place you need to look
[54:58] as the problem is with within your own
[55:03] heart is that okay Jame I told you he's
[55:06] from the show me state it's like listen
[55:08] he's he's straight as ever he just tells
[55:10] it like it is I'm not as hard a preacher
[55:12] as James he lays it out flat and he says
[55:16] if you're having war and struggles in
[55:18] the marriage and family or with other
[55:20] people with your boss if there's
[55:22] constant struggles and you're being
[55:24] affected by it then you need to look at
[55:26] your own heart because there's actually
[55:28] a war going on in
[55:31] you and there's not supposed to be a war
[55:33] going on in
[55:35] us we're supposed to be carriers of the
[55:38] peace of
[55:40] God we should we're supposed to hold so
[55:42] much peace within us and so much of God
[55:44] within us and the love of God shed
[55:46] abroad in our hearts that it doesn't
[55:48] matter what environment someone could
[55:50] spit in our
[55:51] face and by the way there was a man that
[55:54] spit on David one time and disrespected
[55:57] David and his because David was a type
[56:00] of Christ we'll never understand this
[56:02] response but it's a Christlike response
[56:05] he spit on him and one of his soldiers
[56:07] David soldiers says he disrespected the
[56:09] king that's it he's done took a sword
[56:11] out ready to do something and David said
[56:13] don't kill him leave him alone God told
[56:16] him to do
[56:18] that perhaps it'll be a blessing for me
[56:21] down the
[56:23] road Christ coming out of David that
[56:26] response does not come from human
[56:29] beings that comes from
[56:32] Christ take the worst case scenario
[56:34] somebody's somebody's taking you for
[56:36] something somebody's suing you somebody
[56:38] is doing you wrong somebody's gossiping
[56:40] destroying your testimony none of us
[56:42] want that you know I value my testimony
[56:44] there's a scripture in the Bible in
[56:46] Proverbs that says a good name is rather
[56:48] to be chosen than great
[56:50] riches my name I I I don't care about
[56:53] riches I don't care about houses and
[56:55] lands my name is something to be valued
[56:58] and my I want my name to Bear the name
[57:00] of Jesus Christ and I want to have a
[57:03] good testimony but you all you don't
[57:04] always get that sometimes people put you
[57:06] down persecute you do different things
[57:08] to you but you see now how do we respond
[57:10] to it and when we have war in our home
[57:13] and War in our churches it's because
[57:15] there's something unresolved in
[57:17] us had a fight today with my uncle I
[57:22] didn't have a fight with my uncle I'm
[57:23] just using a scenario here
[57:26] oh boy he really got mad at me he went
[57:28] at it you know I don't know why this guy
[57:30] for years I don't know why he doesn't
[57:32] like me and you see now you're going to
[57:34] have that but you see if you have some
[57:36] type of response that's back that wants
[57:39] to get a
[57:41] Revenge I know none of you ever feel
[57:44] that at all it's only me that feels that
[57:47] you want to get revenge listen I'm not
[57:50] perfect friends I failed this Monday I I
[57:53] failed
[57:55] I always try to watch and be careful of
[57:57] certain things and I text somebody and I
[57:59] let a little bit more out of my feelings
[58:02] than of
[58:04] Christ and wasn't right I had to
[58:07] apologize I had to make it right before
[58:10] God because sometimes we get in the
[58:12] flesh but my desire is every response
[58:16] everything would be the right
[58:18] response and say the right thing to
[58:21] bring peace help us Lord I know none of
[58:25] you failed and none of you had anything
[58:27] but I'm just being honest with you it's
[58:28] that you know let's not sit with our
[58:31] Halos tonight let's let's be real okay
[58:34] is that if you're complaining say my
[58:36] uncle somebody they're doing me wrong
[58:38] they're trying to war with me they're
[58:39] fighting with me it's tension every
[58:41] Thanksgiving dinner it's tension and I
[58:43] can't stand this you got to start
[58:46] looking if there's something within you
[58:48] that's unresolved because I can tell you
[58:50] if you're at peace if you're comfortable
[58:53] if you know where you stand and you know
[58:56] that the love of God is is poured in
[58:58] your heart you can walk into that hatred
[59:01] and respond with the love of
[59:09] God I don't think that there can be any
[59:13] situation
[59:15] even David says if I go to the lowest
[59:18] hell God is there he would be with me
[59:23] there it's almost like we live in hell
[59:27] today it's almost like we've already
[59:30] reached it it's just so much so much to
[59:33] it so much hatred Satan's Eden that we
[59:35] live in can you say Amen it's just this
[59:38] whole world is wrong it's it's it's not
[59:40] right there's a few good people in it
[59:42] and I thank God for them I thank God for
[59:45] real people and real Christians and
[59:48] there's some good people thank God for
[59:50] that but the world because they've left
[59:52] the word they're they're getting off
[59:54] track more and more and it's becoming
[59:56] more and more evil all the time and
[59:57] there's more hatred but war on the
[1:00:00] outside means there's there's war and
[1:00:02] conflict on the inside unresolved
[1:00:04] bitterness resentment jealousy see I
[1:00:07] have to bring this down to our own lives
[1:00:08] unresolved jealousy unresolved
[1:00:11] bitterness unresolved anger and Lust For
[1:00:14] against someone else or towards someone
[1:00:17] else it's it's it's saying that I I I'm
[1:00:20] at peace and rest inside with myself
[1:00:22] with God that's where we need to be is
[1:00:24] that we need that peace and rest and
[1:00:26] Holy Spirit dwelling there shed abroad
[1:00:29] with the love of God in our hearts
[1:00:31] inside of us can you say Amen towards
[1:00:34] God towards others and if we have that
[1:00:37] there'll be less war and strife in our
[1:00:41] family it's because you James says
[1:00:44] you're you're lusting and you're you're
[1:00:46] struggling within yourself there's
[1:00:49] something going on within you you need
[1:00:51] to settle that
[1:00:53] struggle
[1:00:55] before you try to settle other
[1:01:00] Wars you could have all the peace talks
[1:01:03] that you want to you could have all the
[1:01:06] family dinners to try to make peace but
[1:01:09] if you walk into that and your heart is
[1:01:12] not resolved of the hatred and
[1:01:13] bitterness it will do no
[1:01:16] good you have to start resolving the war
[1:01:20] within you a lot of you tonight I know
[1:01:22] your testimonies you come to the Lord
[1:01:24] and you lived your whole life with a
[1:01:25] struggle got a uh brother Jason here
[1:01:29] just I I'm just I can mention all kinds
[1:01:31] of names the struggle the just the the
[1:01:34] war on the inside and then he comes to
[1:01:36] Christ a couple years ago baptizing him
[1:01:38] still growing in the Lord you see now
[1:01:41] the war within is settled peace comes on
[1:01:44] the inside can you say Amen you're
[1:01:46] sitting amongst people here that come
[1:01:47] from all kinds of strife where inside
[1:01:50] their hearts I was at battle against God
[1:01:53] I was battling God I was was struggling
[1:01:54] I was insecure I didn't know who I was
[1:01:57] but but and and the world is still a
[1:01:59] mess the world my family some of them
[1:02:01] still don't like me but inside it's been
[1:02:06] settled I know who I
[1:02:10] am and by the
[1:02:12] way you can't solve world problems
[1:02:14] without solving heart
[1:02:20] problems not too many people would say
[1:02:23] that
[1:02:24] you can't solve world problems without
[1:02:28] solving heart problems you can't solve
[1:02:30] violence unless you solve the heart that
[1:02:32] Lust For more
[1:02:34] violence with movies and video games I'm
[1:02:37] always amazed in the news as you watch
[1:02:39] this violent act and somebody mows down
[1:02:42] somebody with a gun and they're always
[1:02:44] trying to find what was the motive what
[1:02:45] was going on you know what they're
[1:02:46] trying to do where was this person where
[1:02:48] was their mind what made it do it was it
[1:02:50] anti-Semitism was it what was it and
[1:02:52] they're trying to get to bom sometimes
[1:02:54] they feel better if they can find
[1:02:55] someone to blame I find it interesting
[1:02:57] that they always leave out that this
[1:02:59] teenage boy that went into a school they
[1:03:01] conveniently leave out the 12 13 14
[1:03:05] years that he sat at home feeding on the
[1:03:08] worst violence on a video game that he
[1:03:10] could ever do and then you get the this
[1:03:13] result say why did he do this why did he
[1:03:15] do this you can't put two and two
[1:03:17] together you can't solve the violence
[1:03:20] problem unless you solve the problem
[1:03:22] with the heart amen it's tied together
[1:03:26] and statistics prove
[1:03:28] that but he that shall endure to the
[1:03:31] end Lord how do I do that what have you
[1:03:35] provided for me where is my security
[1:03:38] that I would be one that could Ure all
[1:03:40] of this endure what endure the hatred
[1:03:43] endure the people offended
[1:03:46] endure the the evil that's around us
[1:03:50] endure the struggle sometimes that's
[1:03:52] even Among Us Lord how you said endure
[1:03:55] to the end somebody's going to endure it
[1:03:57] how do I do it what have you provided
[1:03:59] for me and in this Romans 5 and verse
[1:04:03] one I'll just start at verse one and I'm
[1:04:05] going to read it along you can put it up
[1:04:06] on the King James version on the the
[1:04:08] screen James 5 and verse uh excuse me
[1:04:12] Romans 5 excuse me I was in James Romans
[1:04:15] 5 got the wrong one Romans five look at
[1:04:18] this look at these scriptures here
[1:04:20] because I'm answering the question as we
[1:04:22] bring this down I'm answering it from
[1:04:23] the scripture tonight and that is Lord
[1:04:28] where do I get the strong security where
[1:04:31] what have you provided for me and I
[1:04:33] can't think of better scriptures than
[1:04:35] this to describe what God has given to
[1:04:37] us chapter 5 and verse one therefore
[1:04:41] being justified by faith we have peace
[1:04:44] with God through our Lord Jesus Christ I
[1:04:47] haven't even got to the rest of
[1:04:48] scriptures yet but because we know by
[1:04:51] Revelation he has Justified us which
[1:04:53] means means he has cleared us of all of
[1:04:56] our
[1:04:57] sin the judge has declared us innocent
[1:05:01] because Christ blood was shed for us now
[1:05:05] if you want to talk about the source of
[1:05:07] peace in the soul you have to talk about
[1:05:09] how the great judge said you were guilty
[1:05:12] but Christ Our lamb went to Calvary and
[1:05:15] paid the price for our
[1:05:17] sin and the judge gets up and declares
[1:05:20] they are righteous by the blood of the
[1:05:22] Lamb they have been cleared and Court
[1:05:24] they are sinless before
[1:05:27] me you can't find a greater peace rise
[1:05:30] up in a heart to
[1:05:32] realize I've been justified by God that
[1:05:36] ought to be enough to just make us shout
[1:05:38] amen right there but it's not over
[1:05:41] therefore since we have been Justified
[1:05:43] that is acquitted of sin declared
[1:05:45] blameless before God by faith let us
[1:05:48] grasp the fact that we have peace with
[1:05:51] God and the joy of reconciliation with
[1:05:53] him through our Lord Jesus Christ the
[1:05:56] Messiah the anointed verse two through
[1:05:58] him we also have access by faith into
[1:06:02] this remarkable state of grace in which
[1:06:05] we firmly and safely and securely stand
[1:06:09] so now we've been Justified we've been
[1:06:12] forgiven and now we stand in a place of
[1:06:16] security we stand in a place firmly
[1:06:19] safely securely We Stand can you say
[1:06:22] Amen where are we standing in the grace
[1:06:25] of God I'm standing in His Grace Grace
[1:06:29] is unmar favor so I'm standing there it
[1:06:32] goes on here it says let us rejoice in
[1:06:34] Hope and confident Assurance of
[1:06:36] experiencing and enjoying the glory of
[1:06:38] our God the manifestation of his
[1:06:40] excellence and power verse three and not
[1:06:43] only this but with joy let us exalt in
[1:06:46] our sufferings and rejoice in our
[1:06:49] hardships knowing that hardship distress
[1:06:53] pressure trouble produces patient
[1:06:59] endurance only a Believer can look at
[1:07:01] things this
[1:07:03] way that we
[1:07:05] rejoice in
[1:07:09] Trials
[1:07:11] because uh pressure can make us bitter
[1:07:15] or it can make us
[1:07:18] better but a Believer is like Joseph and
[1:07:21] all of his brothers hated him and
[1:07:25] and they sold him into Egypt if you know
[1:07:27] the story maybe some of you remember it
[1:07:28] from Sunday school or whatever but they
[1:07:31] sold him into Egypt his own brother sold
[1:07:33] him as a slave took him down to Egypt
[1:07:34] put him in a pit brought him out sold
[1:07:36] him as a slave of Egypt his brothers
[1:07:37] hated him because he was uh had some
[1:07:40] dreams and the Lord was with him and
[1:07:43] such hatred Venom and they just just
[1:07:45] sell him get rid of him and so they did
[1:07:46] that he went to Egypt he served there
[1:07:48] then he rose up right side of pharaoh
[1:07:50] there and so then he has to meet his
[1:07:52] brothers again after for many many
[1:07:55] years and the normal human being would
[1:07:59] say I'm in a position of the right hand
[1:08:02] of pharaoh I can get Vengeance on these
[1:08:06] boys that's a normal human
[1:08:09] being but we find Christ manifesting in
[1:08:14] Joseph and when he stood there before
[1:08:16] his brothers and they didn't know who he
[1:08:17] was because he had you know he had got
[1:08:19] older he wasn't a teenage boy anymore he
[1:08:21] had gotten older and they stood before
[1:08:23] this right hand of pharaoh and he
[1:08:26] reveals himself to his brothers I'm
[1:08:28] Joseph your brother of course they're
[1:08:30] all scared they know their lives are
[1:08:32] over they know it's going to be finished
[1:08:34] and Joseph he just begins to weep and
[1:08:37] you know what he
[1:08:38] says what you meant in
[1:08:41] evil God meant it for
[1:08:47] good that's not within a human
[1:08:52] being that's something greater that's
[1:08:54] coming forth of Christ that's
[1:08:57] manifesting that your
[1:08:59] hatred could have made me
[1:09:02] hateful is anybody listen here tonight
[1:09:05] if you don't get anything get these last
[1:09:06] points looks at him and says your hatred
[1:09:09] could have changed me into having the
[1:09:11] same hatred your hatred could justify a
[1:09:15] response of Vengeance on your life I
[1:09:18] have power to end your lives right
[1:09:22] now your
[1:09:24] hatred your evil has turned out to my
[1:09:29] good so I won't kill you I won't get
[1:09:32] Vengeance I'll actually bless you I'll
[1:09:35] send you back with your father and I'll
[1:09:37] bless your family and I'm G to take care
[1:09:39] of you
[1:09:41] guys anybody listening
[1:09:44] tonight there's got to be a response to
[1:09:46] this hatred there's got to be a response
[1:09:48] to this
[1:09:50] bitterness L we become that way
[1:09:52] ourselves
[1:09:54] L it rubs off on us let me finish this
[1:09:57] it's not done yet because he says and
[1:09:59] not only this verse three but with joy
[1:10:00] let us exalt in our sufferings and
[1:10:02] rejoice in our hardships knowing that
[1:10:04] hardship distress pressure trouble
[1:10:06] produces patience patient endurance only
[1:10:08] for believers do we see that suffering
[1:10:10] can bring joy to us and we should have
[1:10:12] joy during our suffering verse four and
[1:10:14] endurance proven character if we endure
[1:10:17] we come out of it with character
[1:10:19] spiritual maturity and proven character
[1:10:22] hope and confidence and its Assurance of
[1:10:24] Eternal salvation verse 5 such hope in
[1:10:27] God's promises never disappoints us
[1:10:30] because God's love has been abundantly
[1:10:33] poured out within our hearts through the
[1:10:35] Holy Ghost who who who was given to us
[1:10:39] so I'm I'm I'm finishing this tonight
[1:10:41] saying to you yes he's provided a source
[1:10:45] there's a fountain open in the House of
[1:10:47] David in the last days there's a
[1:10:50] fountain open in the House of David and
[1:10:52] it's not just your Bible it's the Holy
[1:10:54] Spirit making the Bible live there's a
[1:10:56] fountain that you can drink from that
[1:10:59] all of this hatred has a response it's
[1:11:02] the love of God shed and brought in our
[1:11:03] hearts it's the love of God poured out
[1:11:06] in Us by the Holy Ghost if you don't
[1:11:08] leave saying any other thing you say God
[1:11:11] pour out by the Holy Ghost pour out your
[1:11:14] love in my
[1:11:18] heart because you're going to hit some
[1:11:20] days you're going to need it life won't
[1:11:22] stay the same
[1:11:24] I I don't prophesy things that's not my
[1:11:26] calling but I'll say from the scripture
[1:11:29] and what's going on I'll say safely I
[1:11:31] don't think life is going to continue
[1:11:32] the same this coming year I think things
[1:11:35] are going to
[1:11:36] change you say well I'm I'm scared
[1:11:38] they're going to come to my door with
[1:11:39] guns don't be afraid of that Jesus said
[1:11:42] don't be afraid of those who can kill
[1:11:43] the body but be afraid of those who can
[1:11:45] kill the
[1:11:47] soul so our concern is not what they can
[1:11:51] do to kill us physically but to to bring
[1:11:53] us doubts and and fears to cause us to
[1:11:56] doubt God's promises we can't doubt
[1:11:58] God's promises during this time he says
[1:12:01] his promises he says such hope in God's
[1:12:03] promises never disappoints us we're
[1:12:06] disappointed in politics we're
[1:12:07] disappointed with this world you're
[1:12:09] disappointed with your uncle because he
[1:12:11] keeps fighting with you but my friend
[1:12:13] you will never be disappointed in the
[1:12:15] promises of
[1:12:17] God never be disappointed in the
[1:12:20] promises of God aren't you glad tonight
[1:12:22] you have something you'll never be
[1:12:23] disappoint pointed in you say well I
[1:12:25] don't understand God didn't answer God
[1:12:27] that didn't seem like God didn't answer
[1:12:28] God always
[1:12:30] answers and his people if we can have
[1:12:32] them come up from the grave tonight
[1:12:35] which we don't believe in that until the
[1:12:37] resurrection we're not preaching
[1:12:38] Halloween here that's for sure last
[1:12:41] night was Halloween but if if if
[1:12:43] Christians who's died and went on and
[1:12:45] they're just in another dimension
[1:12:46] Christians don't die they're in another
[1:12:47] dimension but you see now if they could
[1:12:49] testify to you they they went through
[1:12:52] times where they were beheaded they went
[1:12:54] through times of persecution from Rome
[1:12:57] all the way through they went through if
[1:12:58] they could rise and talk to us tonight
[1:13:00] I'd let them speak not I'd let them say
[1:13:02] testify you know what they say to you
[1:13:04] you know what they say there's something
[1:13:06] greater than what hit me in my problems
[1:13:09] that I
[1:13:10] had and you know what they'd say
[1:13:13] mostly God never disappointed
[1:13:18] me he always came
[1:13:22] through we're living now and so we have
[1:13:24] a lot of disappointments but we need to
[1:13:26] remember God's promises will never
[1:13:32] disappoint Hallelujah you will never be
[1:13:36] disappointed with God's
[1:13:38] promises we will with people how many's
[1:13:41] been disappointed in people
[1:13:44] before we'll be disappointed in people
[1:13:47] we'll be disappointed with family they
[1:13:48] will fail us we will be disappointed
[1:13:51] with government sometimes but she'll
[1:13:53] never dis be disappointed tonight my
[1:13:55] friend wherever you're listening my
[1:13:57] brother and sister where whoever you are
[1:14:00] I can tell you there's a fountain that
[1:14:02] you can drink from there's a love that
[1:14:04] can be shed abroad in your hearts by the
[1:14:06] holy ghost that you will never be
[1:14:10] disappointed in
[1:14:12] him you'll find a security you'll find a
[1:14:15] strength you'll find a stability in this
[1:14:18] hour of
[1:14:19] fear something will grip your heart
[1:14:21] that's greater than fear something will
[1:14:24] pour in your heart the Holy Ghost is
[1:14:25] provided as an answer and what is it
[1:14:27] doing it pours out his love within us
[1:14:31] the comforter has come and he'll pour
[1:14:34] out his comfort and his love that we be
[1:14:36] able to respond as I read to you the
[1:14:38] scriptures Sunday we can pull him up and
[1:14:40] close on this Matthew 5 Matthew 5 he
[1:14:43] said ye have heard that had been said
[1:14:46] verse 43 ye have heard that had been
[1:14:48] said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and
[1:14:50] hate thine enemy but I say unto you love
[1:14:52] your enemy
[1:14:53] bless them that curse you do good to
[1:14:56] them that hate you and pray for them
[1:14:58] which despitefully use you and persecute
[1:15:02] you that ye may be the children of your
[1:15:04] father which is in heaven for he maketh
[1:15:06] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[1:15:08] good and on sendeth his Reign on the
[1:15:10] just and on the unjust and if ye love
[1:15:12] them which love you what reward have ye
[1:15:14] do not even the publicans the same and
[1:15:17] if you salute your brethren only what do
[1:15:19] you more than others you know his point
[1:15:22] saying we're not called to be like
[1:15:25] others we're not called to hold hatred
[1:15:27] in our hearts we're not called to
[1:15:29] respond with the same hatred that they
[1:15:31] have there has to be another Holy Spirit
[1:15:36] response be therefore perfect even as
[1:15:38] your father which is in heaven is
[1:15:40] perfect going back to verse 38 he says
[1:15:42] ye have heard that it had been said an
[1:15:44] eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
[1:15:45] but I say unto you that you resist
[1:15:47] resist not evil but whosoever shall
[1:15:49] smite thee on thy right cheek turn to
[1:15:51] him the other also and if any man will
[1:15:53] sue thee at the law let him take thy
[1:15:55] coat let him have thy cloak also and
[1:15:57] whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile
[1:15:59] go with him Twain give to him that Ask
[1:16:01] Of Thee and from him that would borrow
[1:16:03] thee turn not away what is all this what
[1:16:05] is that a different response than what
[1:16:07] we humanly could come up with it's it's
[1:16:11] his
[1:16:12] life his life that has come in a human
[1:16:15] being by the Holy Spirit and it is the
[1:16:19] only proper
[1:16:22] response to the wars to The
[1:16:25] Strife to the
[1:16:28] pressure this may be just a Wednesday
[1:16:30] night with just us here those who are
[1:16:32] listening online doesn't matter if there
[1:16:34] was five people here it doesn't matter
[1:16:36] this word is still the same you have a
[1:16:38] hope tonight you have something to tie
[1:16:41] to that's secure

[1:16:44] nervous and scared and Afraid you don't
[1:16:47] have to hold bitterness in your heart

[1:16:56] certain way I say Lord please if

[1:17:30] seen so many disappointments of life you
[1:17:33] get bitter you get angry you know what I
[1:17:36] see young people at 21 years old 22

[1:17:44] already hate

[1:17:47] didn't
[1:17:49] like but the older ones he said oh don't
