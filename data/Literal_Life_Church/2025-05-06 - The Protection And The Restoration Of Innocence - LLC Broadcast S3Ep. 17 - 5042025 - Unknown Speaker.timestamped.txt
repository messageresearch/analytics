[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine
[0:02] and Literal Life Church in Petersburg,
[0:04] Michigan would like to invite you to
[0:06] take the next half hour and enjoy some
[0:08] time in the word of God. If you're
[0:11] hungry for more God, we believe you can
[0:13] be fed. And we pray that you'll be
[0:16] blessed. Visit our website for more

[0:22] friend. May the music and message
[0:24] encourage you today.
[0:28] Not feeling my
[0:31] [Music]
[0:33] best and my body's needing
[0:40] rest. I can wipe away my
[0:47] tears and I can change the
[0:54] atmosphere when I'm not feeling my best.
[0:59] [Music]
[1:01] When my body's needing
[1:07] rest, I can wipe away my
[1:12] [Music]
[1:14] tears and I can change the
[1:18] [Music]
[1:21] atmosphere when my heart is overwhelmed.
[1:27] [Music]
[1:29] And I can't seem to calm
[1:32] [Music]
[1:35] myself. If I can just get my mind
[1:40] [Music]
[1:42] clear, I can change the
[1:45] [Music]
[1:49] atmosphere. When my heart is
[1:51] overwhelmed,
[1:54] [Music]
[1:56] And I can't seem to call
[1:59] [Music]
[2:02] myself. If I can just get my mind
[2:09] clear, I can change the atmosphere.
[2:14] [Music]
[2:17] If you're tired of
[2:22] struggling and you need a song to
[2:29] sing, turn your sadness into
[2:33] [Music]
[2:36] cheer. You can change the atmosphere.
[2:40] [Music]
[2:44] If you're tired of
[2:46] [Music]
[2:49] struggling and you need a song to
[2:56] sing, turn your sadness into
[3:01] [Applause]
[3:01] [Music]
[3:03] cheer. You can change the atmosphere.
[3:07] [Applause]
[3:09] [Music]
[3:11] We are more than
[3:14] [Applause]
[3:16] conquerors. And Jesus told us in his
[3:23] word that we can push away all
[3:30] fears and we can change the atmosphere.
[3:35] [Music]
[3:38] Yes, we are more than
[3:43] conquerors. And Jesus told us in his
[3:48] [Music]
[3:50] word that we can push away our
[3:54] [Music]
[3:57] fears and we can change the
[4:04] atmosphere. Through Christ we have
[4:07] [Music]
[4:11] authority. Our praises make the darkness
[4:18] free. And he promised to be
[4:24] clear. So let's change the
[4:28] [Music]
[4:31] atmosphere. Through Christ we have
[4:34] [Music]
[4:38] authority. Our praises make the darkness
[4:44] [Music]
[4:45] free. And he promised to be
[4:49] [Music]
[4:52] near. So let's change the atmosphere.
[4:59] Jesus promised to be
[5:02] [Music]
[5:05] near. So let's change the
[5:11] atmosphere. They did not destroy the
[5:13] nations concerning whom the Lord
[5:15] commanded them. So because God said, "Go
[5:16] forth and destroy those nations. Take
[5:18] over your land." Listen to what happens
[5:20] though when they didn't step up to the
[5:22] plate and destroy those nations
[5:23] concerning whom the Lord commanded them,
[5:25] but were mingled among the heathen and
[5:28] learned their works. Everybody pay
[5:30] attention now. When we don't destroy
[5:33] that thing that's trying to destroy us,
[5:36] then the next stage is to mingle with
[5:40] the heathen and learn how they do
[5:43] things.
[5:44] This our nation today. We have mingled
[5:47] too much with the heathenistic ways.
[5:52] We We're mingled among the heathen and
[5:54] learned their works. And they serve
[5:56] their idols which were a snare. Not
[5:59] talking about the the heathens. It's
[6:00] talking about Israel started to serve
[6:02] their idols which were a snare unto
[6:05] them. Yay. They sacrificed their sons
[6:08] and their daughters unto devils. Who
[6:10] did? Israel. They so learned the way of
[6:13] the heathen. And the distinction, one of
[6:15] the distinctions in idol worship and
[6:17] heathen worship is to actually sacrifice
[6:20] your sons and daughters to the gods that
[6:23] you
[6:24] served. How far can you
[6:27] get that you believe this is God so much
[6:32] that they actually took the one of the
[6:34] phrases is they took him through the
[6:36] fire. In other words, they let him go
[6:38] through the fire. They sacrificed.
[6:40] There's different views on how that
[6:42] happened, but that was a distinction of
[6:43] the heathenistic worship of their gods,
[6:46] gods. They sacrificed their sons and
[6:48] daughters. Yay. They sacrificed their
[6:50] sons and their daughters unto devils and
[6:51] shed innocent blood. And that's what
[6:53] I'm, if you just underline the word
[6:54] innocent. That's what I'm preaching on
[6:56] today, a protection, a restoration of
[6:58] innocence through this. They shed
[7:00] innocent blood. In other words, he's
[7:02] talking about the children. He's talking
[7:03] about anything innocent. He's talking
[7:05] about sacrificing those that are
[7:06] innocent. They didn't have anything to
[7:08] do with it. They they they didn't they
[7:09] just their children are followers.
[7:11] They're going to follow how you lead.
[7:13] And now dad, mom, they're leading their
[7:15] family into this idol worship and they
[7:17] didn't realize they're just going,
[7:18] "Okay, daddy. Okay, mommy, let's start
[7:21] worship. Bring the idols into their
[7:22] tents." They begin to worship. Then they
[7:24] learn their ways. And one of those ways
[7:26] those children didn't they it wasn't
[7:27] fair. They didn't know that eventually
[7:30] they'd become so obsessed in this
[7:32] heathenistic way, they had to come and
[7:34] say, "Listen, I love my God so much. I
[7:36] want you to pass through the fire and
[7:37] I'm going to give you offer you up to my
[7:40] God.
[7:42] Innocent innocent blood. Yeah. Innocent
[7:45] children. Oh, I just my heart is going
[7:47] now to innocent millions of innocent
[7:50] children's life who have to see
[7:53] separation, have to see abuse, have to
[7:56] hear. Oh God have mercy on us. They shed
[8:00] innocent blood. even the blood of their
[8:01] sons and of their daughters whom they
[8:03] sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan. And
[8:05] the land was polluted with blood. Thus
[8:07] were they defiled with their own works
[8:09] and went a whoring with their own
[8:11] inventions. And then I want to pick up
[8:13] something though because I don't want to
[8:14] leave it dim here or uh gloomy. Verse
[8:18] 44, that's the reality of it. They
[8:20] sacrificed them. Nevertheless, verse 44,
[8:22] after all this history of rebellion,
[8:24] Nevertheless, he regarded their
[8:26] affliction when he heard their cry and
[8:29] he remembered for them his covenant and
[8:31] repented according to the multitude of
[8:33] his mercies. Aren't you glad for the
[8:36] multitude of his mercies? Aren't you
[8:38] glad for grace? Grace says, "Whatever
[8:41] you done wrong, whatever innocence you
[8:44] destroyed, I'm able to restore you back
[8:46] again. Amen. I'm able to affect the
[8:49] future generations. Aren't you glad when
[8:52] you read the judgment chapters, if you
[8:54] read Lamentations, it's all the
[8:55] judgments of God because of Israel
[8:57] rebellion. And yet you can find little
[8:59] verses with a threat of redemption in
[9:01] there. Say, "But I will restore. I will
[9:04] bring you back. They didn't deserve it,
[9:06] but what you've done, you've made a
[9:08] mess, but I will restore, sayeth the
[9:10] Lord." You always have the thread of
[9:13] redemption throughout the Bible.
[9:16] And here he says his multitude of
[9:18] mercies he made them also to be pied of
[9:20] all those that carry them. So I just
[9:22] wanted to catch that. And look at the
[9:23] next chapter 107 and uh verse one. Give
[9:26] thanks unto the Lord for he is good for
[9:28] his mercy endureth forever. Let the
[9:31] redeemed of the Lord say so. Amen.
[9:34] I said let the redeemed of the Lord say
[9:37] so. The redeemed are the ones that know.
[9:40] No matter how much trouble we got in, no
[9:42] matter how much trouble our nation gets
[9:44] in, my home, whatever it is, the
[9:46] redeemed of the Lord knows what it is.
[9:48] I'm under the power of redemption here.
[9:52] And when you know you're under the power
[9:54] of redemption in your life, you raise
[9:56] your hand and says, "Let the redeemed of
[9:58] the Lord shout. Let him say so. Let him
[10:02] sing of redemption.
[10:04] My God can restore innocence again.
[10:07] That's right. He says, he says, "And he
[10:10] gathered them out of the lands." Oh, I
[10:13] didn't finish. Let the redeemed Lord say
[10:14] so. Whom he hath redeemed out of the
[10:16] hand of the enemy and gathered them out
[10:18] of the lands from the east and from the
[10:19] west, from the north and from the south.
[10:21] Wherever they got scattered, God said,
[10:23] I'll bring them all back. That's a good
[10:26] promise for y'all that's got children
[10:27] wayward. I always tell you, don't give
[10:29] up. Because he said for all the children
[10:32] of Israel, he said, I'll redeem them. He
[10:34] says, he said, "I'll I don't care how
[10:36] far they've gone to the ends of the
[10:38] earth. If they're my children, I'll
[10:41] bring them back again." Somebody say,
[10:43] "Praise the Lord. I'll bring them back
[10:45] again. I'll restore them." David
[10:48] Padfield is a evangelist in Zion,
[10:52] Illinois. And of course, I don't know
[10:54] him, but he he says something here
[10:57] pretty straight about this heathen way
[10:59] of sacrificing children. And if you
[11:01] think that's going on just 6,000 years
[11:03] ago, no, it's going on today
[11:07] worse. Among the many sins of the
[11:09] Gentiles is the charge that they were
[11:12] without natural affection. Romans 1:31,
[11:15] they were without natural affection.
[11:17] That means they lose their feeling,
[11:19] their
[11:20] sensitivity. Albert Barnes correctly
[11:23] observed that Paul doubtless refers here
[11:25] to the practice so common among the
[11:26] heathens of exposing their children and
[11:29] putting them to death. The pages of
[11:31] history are bloody with the record of
[11:33] heathen nations sacrificing their
[11:35] children. This is the one of the
[11:36] reasons. I'm going have to read this
[11:37] quickly because I don't want to spend a
[11:39] lot of time on this. So, as my dad used
[11:41] to say, I'll read quick and you listen
[11:44] fast. This is one of the reasons God
[11:46] destroyed the Canaanites. They even
[11:48] sacrificed their sons and their
[11:50] daughters to demons and shed innocent
[11:51] blood. Even the blood of their sons and
[11:53] daughters whom they sacrificed to the
[11:55] idols of uh Canaan. And the land was
[11:57] polluted with blood. He's got scriptures
[11:59] for all this. Of course, the wicked king
[12:01] Manasseh
[12:02] uh followed the example of the
[12:04] Canaanites and caused his sons to pass
[12:06] through the fire in the valley of the
[12:08] son of Henon. 2 Chronicles. The ancient
[12:10] Persians buried their children
[12:12] alive. In Grecian states, emphaside was
[12:16] emphasized uh excuse me, infant side was
[12:19] enforced by law. The Romans were the
[12:21] most unrelenting in treatment of their
[12:23] children. The Roman father had absolute
[12:25] power over the life of his children.
[12:27] Babies were also sacrificed among the
[12:29] ancient uh uh Phoenosians. Uh
[12:31] Carthagans, Chinese and Hindus, other
[12:34] religions sacrificing their children.
[12:36] That's the heathen. That's the wrong god
[12:38] to serve. You never find that in our
[12:41] god. How can any parent deliberately
[12:43] sacrifice their son and daughter to
[12:45] demons? The practice is so vile that we
[12:48] cannot comprehend what would cause one
[12:50] to commit such a despicable act. Yet I
[12:53] contend that many parents today are
[12:56] willing to sacrifice their children to
[12:58] demons. While their children not are not
[13:00] burned or buried alive, they are placed
[13:03] on the altar of Satan by foolish
[13:07] parents. They're placed on the altar of
[13:09] pleasure. Some parents are so concerned
[13:12] about their children having a good time
[13:14] that they will sacrifice the soul of
[13:16] their own child on an altar of pleasure.
[13:18] Solomon told the young man to rejoice in
[13:21] his youth and let your heart chill you
[13:22] in the days of youth. Walk in the ways
[13:24] of your heart and in the sight of your
[13:26] eyes. But know that for all these things
[13:28] God will bring you into judgment. Enjoy
[13:30] life, but don't forget about the
[13:31] judgment. Parents have been known to
[13:33] leave the Lord and join some church
[13:36] because it offers to entertain their
[13:39] children. I'm going to get my kids to
[13:41] that church because I like their music
[13:43] or I like their entertainment. I like
[13:45] their program because but if you do it
[13:47] for the motive of just entertaining your
[13:49] children, that's not enough.
[13:52] I think what he says is right. The
[13:53] entertainment of children is the duty of
[13:55] the home, not the church. Christ did not
[13:57] die on Calvar's cross just so teenagers
[14:00] could have a party in the fellowship
[14:01] hall.
[14:03] You think I'm a hard preacher.
[14:06] When parents are willing to sacrifice
[14:08] the souls of their children in the
[14:09] pursuit of entertainment, are they any
[14:11] better off than the heathen who
[14:12] sacrifice their sons and their daughters
[14:14] to demons? You let them watch anything
[14:16] on their phone. You let them watch
[14:17] anything on the television programs. I'm
[14:19] telling you, I wonder if what he's
[14:20] saying is true that it's the parents,
[14:22] not the children. It's the parents
[14:24] sacrificing in the name of entertaining
[14:26] them at the altar of Hollywood.
[14:31] He says the altar of popularity or
[14:34] success. Some Christians have been known
[14:36] to sacrifice the children in an attempt
[14:37] to make them popular. Since the moral
[14:39] code reviewed in the new revealed in the
[14:41] New Testament is not in harmony with the
[14:43] standards of the world. Many will yield
[14:45] to the pressure and allow their children
[14:46] to engage in activities they would
[14:48] rather you not know about. In an effort
[14:50] to make the dollars popular, they were
[14:52] allowed to become cheerleaders and try
[14:53] to defend their skimpy attire on the
[14:55] grounds that it's no worse than anyone
[14:57] else wears. Yet Paul and modest women to
[14:59] adorn themselves in modest apparel.
[15:01] Amen. Why is there different rules for
[15:03] our children than it is for the adults?
[15:05] What Paul said, he says, now this is for
[15:07] all the older sisters. They need to
[15:08] adore themselves in modest apparel. No,
[15:10] modesty is a godly attribute. Can you
[15:13] say amen? And it's to be taught to our
[15:15] children. You don't take your clothes
[15:17] off in front of everybody. Other parents
[15:19] will allow their children to go to the
[15:20] public pool where they not only shed
[15:22] their own clothing, but because others
[15:24] cause others to lust after them. Yet our
[15:26] Lord said, "Whosoever looks on a woman
[15:27] to lust after her has already committed
[15:29] adultery within his heart. A man might
[15:31] be guilty of lusting after a woman. But
[15:33] if the woman dresses in such a way to
[15:35] cause him to lust, she is just as guilty
[15:38] of sin as he is. We all know he's
[15:41] telling the truth right there. The altar
[15:43] of education is success. No, I'm I'm not
[15:46] opposed to secular education. A good
[15:49] education is required for children to
[15:51] function in this world. However, I'm
[15:53] also concerned about the world to come.
[15:58] And that's what I preached last Sunday.
[16:00] You can't just have temporal values for
[16:03] your children. The most important desire
[16:06] you should have is they connect with
[16:08] eternal life. Can I get an amen? So we
[16:12] have a duty to give our children an
[16:13] education and lead them in the right
[16:15] way. But you know the greatest thing we
[16:16] have as a mandate from the scripture is
[16:19] to lead them to the place to receive
[16:21] eternal life and to receive the Holy
[16:24] Ghost. Amen. Every prayer upon the lips
[16:27] of the parents should be this promise in
[16:30] the book of
[16:32] Acts, this promise Peter said that's
[16:34] come to us that we've been waiting for
[16:36] 2,000 years to be it fulfilled. And here
[16:38] it is in the upper room, the pouring out
[16:40] of his spirit. Not just the pouring out,
[16:42] not just on their flesh like the
[16:43] Pentecostals. Oh, I feel the anointing.
[16:45] No, no. It went to their souls.
[16:49] Tongues of fire, not unknown tongues.
[16:51] No, no, no, no. Tongues of fire came in
[16:53] that upper room and they were changed.
[16:55] And when he come out of it, Peter was
[16:58] being asked, "What do we need to to be
[17:00] saved?" And he says, "You need to repent
[17:03] and you need to be baptized and you
[17:05] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[17:07] Ghost."
[17:09] Next words. And the promise, this
[17:11] promise is unto
[17:14] you and your children,
[17:19] and further as many as our God shall
[17:22] call. But the second one that you should
[17:24] have on your lips beside you is your
[17:27] children.
[17:31] You got a promise this morning. Now see,
[17:33] if you were trying to if I can get them
[17:35] to the front and if I can get them saved
[17:37] and it becomes a kind of a formula and
[17:39] pressure them. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[17:41] Pray, pray, God, put a hunger in their
[17:43] heart for the Holy Ghost because they're
[17:46] not going to make it in this life
[17:48] without true salvation, true Holy Ghost.
[17:50] They need the same thing that they had
[17:52] on the day of Pentecost. Can you say
[17:54] amen? And and and you don't have to say
[17:56] this is my promise to my it's not your
[17:58] promise. It's God's promise. And the
[18:00] promise said, "This will come to your
[18:02] children as well." What do we need to
[18:04] pray for? That promise is more important
[18:06] than success,
[18:09] than this life, than them wearing the
[18:12] right clothes, than education,
[18:17] this promise is more important than
[18:19] anything. And I love when David says
[18:21] here when he says, "I'm concerned about
[18:23] the world to come." I think all of us
[18:25] should not just be concerned and
[18:27] pressured and worried about this world.
[18:29] We should be worried about the world to
[18:31] come that our children would be in the
[18:33] world to come.
[18:35] Eternal values. My heart breaks every
[18:37] time I hear some parent tell me their
[18:39] child could not make it to Wednesday
[18:40] evening Bible class because they had
[18:42] homework. The homework has to be done.
[18:45] But why at the expense of Bible study?
[18:47] Why don't they just skip a few hours of
[18:49] television and talking on the phone
[18:51] instead? What excuse can a parent
[18:53] possibly have for their children not
[18:55] having their Bible class lessons
[18:56] prepared?
[18:58] out of 168 hours in a week, they
[19:01] couldn't find one hour to study their
[19:02] Bible. Did they have time for
[19:04] television? Did they have time to talk
[19:06] with their friends on the phone? Did
[19:07] they have time to play outside? I don't
[19:09] blame the children near as much as I do
[19:12] the parents.
[19:14] How many say amen to that? It's been
[19:16] told us by the prophet of God, it's not
[19:19] child delinquency. It's not teenage
[19:21] delinquency. It's parent delinquency.
[19:24] That's right.
[19:26] First, why you think I'm a hard
[19:28] preacher? This I don't know who this
[19:30] David Patfield. Wow, he says it like it
[19:32] is. I can say amen to it. I think we
[19:35] should be concerned about the world to
[19:37] come more than this world. We're praying
[19:39] for our children to receive Christ.
[19:42] We're praying that God help us to
[19:43] protect them, that we put protections in
[19:46] place for their innocence. I think we
[19:48] have a promise of the Holy Ghost is to
[19:50] us and our children. That's the promise
[19:52] you need to be holding up before God and
[19:54] believing for. Can you say amen? The
[19:56] token in the book of Exodus was applied
[19:58] to the home. The token was a protection
[20:01] for the homes and it was for the
[20:02] children. The very Holy Ghost and say
[20:04] what is that? Well, the token was a type
[20:06] of the Holy Ghost because that blood
[20:08] which came from the blood of Christ, his
[20:10] spirit. This is this is simply explained
[20:13] friends is that when he died, his blood
[20:16] was shed but there was a life in that
[20:18] blood.
[20:21] He had to shed a his blood is the lamb
[20:23] at
[20:24] Calvary. But and the blood was there on
[20:27] the cross. But there was a life in that
[20:29] blood.
[20:31] And the life of that blood came back on
[20:34] the day of Pentecost again to bring true
[20:38] conversions and power.
[20:40] After the Holy Ghost has come, you shall
[20:43] receive power. Power for what? Power to
[20:45] be a witness. Power to live an
[20:47] overcoming life. You can't live an
[20:49] overcoming life without his life of his
[20:51] blood living in you. So we believe in
[20:54] the blood, but we believe also in the
[20:55] life of the blood. It poured out at
[20:57] Calvary. His blood poured out. His life
[20:59] went somewhere. Where did it go? Well,
[21:01] the body went as a memorial up to the
[21:04] that's all scriptural now to the right
[21:06] hand of the father in authority. But the
[21:08] life of the blood, where did it go? The
[21:10] spirit, it came into them on the day of
[21:12] Pentecost. How do you know that? Because
[21:15] after a while, the people said they took
[21:17] note. They've been with Jesus. They look
[21:19] like Jesus. They're doing the works of
[21:21] Jesus. Why? Jesus spirit was in them.
[21:29] The token is applied to our homes. It's
[21:31] for our children. It's for protection.
[21:32] That night in Egypt, the firstborn's
[21:35] life was at
[21:37] stake. The dark angel was going through
[21:40] the land. And that little child, that
[21:43] firstborn, was at stake. And the home
[21:46] was at stake. And daddy went out and
[21:48] applied the
[21:50] blood to the doorpost and the upper part
[21:53] of the door. And when he applied the
[21:55] blood to his home, the death angel
[21:57] passed their home and they were
[21:59] protected. I'm covered by the blood of
[22:02] Jesus Christ. I'm protected by the blood
[22:04] of Jesus Christ. I don't have any hope
[22:06] for my children except for the blood of
[22:08] Jesus Christ. All my efforts are I pray
[22:11] God will bless my efforts to direct my
[22:12] children, but they need the blood of
[22:14] Jesus Christ.
[22:16] Didn't Job pray constantly and breathe
[22:18] sacrifices of blood for his children? He
[22:21] was such a father that he brought him
[22:22] every day and worshiped God. He says,
[22:24] "I'm bringing the sacrifice. My kids,
[22:27] they may not have done something wrong
[22:28] today, but I'm bringing the sacrifice in
[22:31] case they do something wrong." He's
[22:33] applying the blood to his children. And
[22:35] guess what? Even after that, he lost all
[22:39] of his children.
[22:42] speed ahead. The last chapter, he's
[22:45] blessed and gets all of them back.
[22:49] Not them, but everything he had lost,
[22:53] God gave him back. And I'm preaching to
[22:55] you, he's the restorer.
[23:00] You take a daddy like that, in the end,
[23:02] Satan thinks he lost. No, he didn't
[23:04] lose. He gained. Amen. You think your
[23:08] home has been destroyed or your home is
[23:09] in a mess now. There's some people's
[23:12] homes that's in a mess and they don't
[23:13] even realize it. They're too proud to
[23:14] admit it. But you think your lives and
[23:16] your homes are in a mess now. You trust
[23:18] the Lord. Apply the word. Get honest
[23:20] with God. Get sincere. Get
[23:22] repentant. Bring this word into your
[23:24] home. And God will bless your home and
[23:29] restore your home. Martin Luther said
[23:31] here, if you have the quote there, I'm
[23:34] afraid that the schools will prove to be
[23:36] the very gates of
[23:38] hell unless they diligently labor in
[23:41] explaining the holy scriptures and
[23:44] engraving them in the heart of the
[23:47] youth. We have reasoned with things too
[23:50] much. We have lowered the standards.
[23:52] Sometimes we're too loose about watching
[23:55] over the innocence of our children.
[23:57] Sometimes the church has complicated
[24:00] things for hungry hearts that are
[24:02] coming. I want to add the church in
[24:04] because the church world, the
[24:06] denominational world as a whole has
[24:09] readjusted things and complicated the
[24:12] simplicity of the power of the gospel to
[24:15] where it becomes systems and formulas
[24:17] for the new birth. And those formulas
[24:20] won't work. It takes the power of God to
[24:23] protect and restore our children. And to
[24:27] restore any innocence. Can you say amen?
[24:30] It takes the power of God. We should
[24:32] connect with our children first. Then we
[24:34] should connect them with the things of
[24:36] God. Can you say amen? Some parents
[24:38] already disconnect. They're
[24:39] disconnected. We should connect. And I
[24:41] think of, you know, uh we should protect
[24:43] them. We should connect them to God.
[24:45] It's to connect with them. But the most
[24:48] important connection is that someday
[24:50] they connect with this person of the
[24:52] Lord Jesus Christ in a real experience
[24:57] with
[24:58] him. I believe I've got a whole list of
[25:01] notes to finish
[25:03] this concerning the scriptures and
[25:06] quotes that tell us the power of not
[25:09] only the protection of innocence but the
[25:12] restoration of innocence.
[25:15] I can preach on it for hours, friends,
[25:18] that this power of the the word and the
[25:20] gospel and what God's restored. I want
[25:22] to talk about how
[25:24] everything that got lost in 2000 church
[25:28] ages. You say, "What got lost?" The
[25:31] reason I know that things and truths got
[25:33] lost and messed with through church
[25:34] systems is because there's about six or
[25:38] seven solid prophecies that say he's
[25:41] going to restore things in the end time.
[25:45] Joel says all the years that the canker
[25:47] worm has ate and the caterpillar and he
[25:49] ate off that tree. He took the doctrine.
[25:51] He took the fellowship. He he ate off
[25:53] that's a prophecy about the church when
[25:55] they started at Pentecost is just a few
[25:57] years later Satan begins to do what he
[25:58] did in Eden and that's pervert the word
[26:01] and through church systems he perverts
[26:02] the word. And but Joel says Joel says
[26:05] two chapters later I will restore all
[26:08] the years that Satan ate.
[26:11] Then you come along to Jesus referring
[26:14] to John the Baptist and also another he
[26:16] says John the Baptist he came to foreign
[26:18] my coming but he says Elijah truly shall
[26:21] first come and what restore all things
[26:25] Jesus himself uh it's Matthew
[26:28] 17:11 Elijah will come at the end time
[26:31] and restore all things restoration. Acts
[26:34] 3:21, Jesus was received into heaven
[26:37] until the time of restitution of all
[26:40] things. Revelations 10:7, in the days of
[26:43] the seventh angel, when he shall begin
[26:45] to sound, all the mystery of God should
[26:47] be finished. Revelations 1 says, all the
[26:50] seven angels are the seven messengers to
[26:52] the seven ages or seven churches. So the
[26:55] seventh one is to have a restoration
[26:57] ministry to bring the people of God back
[27:00] to the innocence that was lost
[27:02] throughout the ages to restore the word.
[27:06] Our God is a God of restoration. But all
[27:10] of I all I said about the restoration of
[27:12] innocence is culminated in all this
[27:14] ministry of the last days is culminated
[27:16] in Ephesians that I read to you at the
[27:18] beginning. I'll have a a church. I'll
[27:22] present it to myself. She'll be a
[27:25] spotless
[27:27] bride, a virgin bride. Not tainted with
[27:30] men's ideas, not tainted with church
[27:32] systems, not I'll bring her back to her
[27:35] purity again. And how I do it, I'll wash
[27:38] her by the water of the
[27:41] word. I can't even preach to you how
[27:44] powerful the restorative work of the
[27:47] Lord is. If it can bring a bride
[27:50] spotless in the last days, do you think
[27:51] it's not powerful enough to change you?
[27:55] to restore your innocence, to forgive
[27:57] you of what you've done wrong, to
[27:59] restore your family to a healthy family
[28:02] instead of
[28:03] chaos. No, this word, this Lord wants to
[28:08] restore. Thank you for watching our
