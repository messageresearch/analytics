On October 14, 2023, Literal Life Church welcomed the Cockman Family for a Bluegrass Gospel community outreach worship service. The Cockman family, from North Carolina, brought their 30 years of experience (spanning 2 generations) playing gospel bluegrass to Petersburg, Michigan, for a wonderful evening of great music, bringing glory to the Lord through their gifts.

We are thrilled to have captured this night on recording to make available to you to enjoy. Get ready for a hand-clapping, foot-stomping time of praise to our King!
