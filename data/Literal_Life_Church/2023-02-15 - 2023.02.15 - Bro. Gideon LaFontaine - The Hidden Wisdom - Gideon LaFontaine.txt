I got that wrong Genesis chapter 3. well Genesis chapter 2 you can start there but you see the word of God here this is chapter 2 and verse 17. I'll pull that one up first there it is this is the word of God but the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day thou edest therefore Thou shalt surely die that's the word of the Lord right it's the word of the Lord so we turn over the verse three chapter or verse 1 chapter 3 verse 1. now the spirit was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God hath made and he said unto the woman yea hath God so he asked the question first is starts hath God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said in the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said see Eve knowing the word he shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die and say and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die one word one word for God does not for God does not for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing Good and Evil that's where the reasoning comes in for Eve and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make this is where I want to get at and the tree to be desired to be to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave unto her unto her husband with her and he did eat so you see look at the beginning you see God's word plain and clear do not eat of the tree right you see that Satan being subtle the one that he is he still is today he hasn't he hasn't changed much has he he's subtle amen he knows how to he knows how to get and see the the ever in the in the rooms that maybe you may not know of and it might you might not know he's working but knowing the devil in all of his tricks right that's how we're overcoming knowing the devil and all of his tricks amen same being civil he still is instead he injects his reasoning into Eve starting with the question hath God said You shall not eat of the tree of the garden he starts with that question he starts with that reasoning with with the truth right Eve has the truth she even says the truth to she even says she speaks it to Satan he's he's she says it but still there's the reasoning going on he starts asking questions he starts building that relationship with Eve Eve knowing the word responds with we may Eve the fruit of the tree of the garden but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden so he says it shall be as God's knowing good and evil you see that's see it's knowing good and evil what does that sound like sounds like the wisdom of the world right knowing Good and Evil wisdom versus faith this is a message now what is the wisdom we're talking about something that will not agree that that will not agree that all this word is the truth that something that will take away from this truth expressing itself is a higher knowledge more wisdom and if wisdom of that sort comes from Satan his children live by that wisdom and if the faith of God come through God and God is the word God's children lives on that faith amen the Bible says the just shall live by wisdom what does it say what does it say the just shall live by Faith amen it's the just shall live by faith not what he can learn but what he can't believe all right wisdom tries to take a better way the way a modern a way of popularity the easier way find itself it Finds Its loopholes as brother Rapp talked about last Wednesday night it finds loopholes right that wisdom the man's Wisdom talking about see this conflict between God's wisdom man's Wisdom right Satan interjecting his wisdom so just shall live by faith not what he can learn but what he can believe wisdom tries to take the better way tries to find loopholes wisdom says wisdom says man's Wisdom says we need to have a balance have you ever heard that term before but we gotta have a balance brother we gotta have a balance right I've heard that so many times by Believers I believe they're Believers but they it's that the excuse right we've got to have a balance so I can I can I can still listen to this music right I can still listen to it because we need to have a balance we can still we can still tamper with what what the devil what the devil's uh given us right so it's that wisdom of the world injecting itself right so we have that when the word wisdom says we need to have the balance when the word is the balance you believe the word is the balance amen wisdom may even be sincere but you can be sincerely wrong it must be truth amen praise the Lord and when and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that was pleasant to the eyes and the tree to be desired to make one why she took of the fruit and did eat and gave unto her wisdom with her and he did eat now we see the evidence of what reasoning with the word of God can do see I work in a hospital I see it I can witness it we can look around we don't have to look far to see where where man's Wisdom or Satan's wisdom has destroyed the Earth right we're destroying ourselves by it amen now we see the evidence of what reasoning with the word can do I work at a hospital I'm witnessing what that word added what that one word added did to the whole human race what reason started for the world it's good to go completely insane right without that word applied without that pure word nothing tainted nothing added to it right without that we're gone we're gone amen we need that word that pure word aren't you glad that word came back for us aren't you glad praise the Lord by God's grace he sent he sent he sent a prophet do you believe you believe he gave his word for this day amen so glad amen thank you Lord just his grace so we'll see it in every Church age of what reasoning what the word can do when the word comes Satan injects his perversion and man's reason and then comes fruit of dead religion we see it in the food we eat today we see in the food we injection on injection that everything we eat today may look so good tastes so good but destroys our bodies it's just it just happens we can't get avoid it we can't get around it it just happens but why because man has injection on injection on injection has destroyed it right so even our teeth even our teeth because of the things we eat we come out we come out with crooked teeth so we see in every Church age we see it in the food we eat um and what what does it all come back to it comes back to our stinking thinking right remember our pastor was talking about stinking thinking where did it start stinking thinking right amen it didn't line up with the word and what what like what our thoughts are going through that's not God's thoughts right amen so it goes to destroy our bodies it's hybrid because man's desire to know wisdom stink and think and look at where we're at today at today look around creation is groaning so no vaccine no supplement no gun no politician will protect or keep you from the pollution of this world of this world's wisdom but by faith in the word of God that's our protection that's what we look to do you believe that amen faith in the word of God it's infallible it can't fail right it's pure halleluia thank you Lord Jesus looking at the same temptation of worldly wisdom what is his response as it is written he uses the word to combat the enemy right you see him in the wilderness with the Devil he's offering all the organizations all the kings all all the all the kingdoms of the world but he says ad is as it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God look at the difference by faith Jesus withstood the withstood the Enemy by the word amen wisdom versus faith I'm going to pull a lot from that tonight Satan tries to tempt Jesus from faith in the father's word here's what he did he tried to show him his great big ecclesiastic organizations of the Earth but he couldn't tempt him come over and join me I'll make the bishop over all of them but what does Jesus say it's written said Jesus yes yes sir Satan couldn't tempt him no sir he's just passed that but Jesus was the word his faith and the knowledge of himself that he was the word amen praise the Lord knowing who you are comes back to Identity right knowing who you are in Christ knowing what you have within you the word of God Amen as it is written we have the word we have the word applied amen praise God hallelujah amen the DVD of Christ there is a difference between reason and God's word God's word is true reason is false you can't reason out nothing that's right our mind is not see it's not good enough or never will be to Fathom God fathom God's Eternal wisdom and therefore you can't reason it you just got to believe amen it's in faith amen that's the difference that's the conflict it's Faith versus wisdom Faith versus man's Wisdom amen let no man deceive himself First Corinthians 3 18 18-21 let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him be a fool that he may be wise for the wisdom of this world is foolishness of God for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and again the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain amen back to wisdom versus faith if wisdom is with the word and proves to be with the word and the word produces itself I'm going to repeat this if wisdom is with the word this is what I'm trying to say tonight we've got to bring it back to the word all of our thoughts all of what we hear all the voices that come in it's got to be lined up exactly with what the word if it doesn't it's not right it's wrong amen if you can stay exactly with that word amen you're on the right track praise God if wisdom is with the word it proves to be with the word and the word produces Itself by the same thing then it is then it is the word but if wisdom is against the word and not with with the word but trying to find something to add to it or take from it it's the devil it's very simple it's almost like Black and White amen I love that when you can see scripture and it's just night and day right there amen praise God so God has true wisdom and Satan can only pervert right God has his wisdom right and all satan did was pervert that right he perverted it so you see the conflict man's Wisdom is foolish to God and God's Wisdom is foolish to man 's wisdom cannot comprehend or even fathom God's wisdom in the human fight in the human mind I love this and the human mind faith is absurd why would Abraham and Sarah being old even think they would have a son they're old in their A's why would they even think how can you even process that in your mind why why would Abraham and Sarah why would Abraham take his son as a sacrifice that's just absurd to think that you would take your own son up to a mountain put them on put them on some rocks and think that that's just crazy to the human mind right it's Faith though right comes back to Faith and the human mind faith is absurd why would Abraham take his son as a sacrifice why would Noah built build an ark why would Moses give up the pleasures of Egypt choosing to suffer the Affliction with the people how in the world because Israel passed through the Red Sea on dry land how could the walls of Jericho fall down when a group of people walked around it Hallelujah why would why was it Rahab spared the woman with a blood issue healed we talked about Ben Ben and Megan today having their son come home praise God it's by Faith by faith it's still it's still living today by Faith by faith we live amen praise God faith in the promised word amen hallelujah thank you God I love this why would God himself leave his throne and come down and indwell human flesh to pay the price for our sins why it was Faith he's had a word there was a sacrifice needed to be paid right there was a word by Faith In The Word of Promise God honors faith praise God praise the Lord amen I was just overwhelmed in my study today at that that thought that his faith God's faith coming down aren't you glad for it amen he saw you he saw you amen if it was just for one amen so he can catch what the importance of faith is in this conflict between man's Wisdom and God's wisdom Faith does not need to be worked up either it's simply taking God at his word amen we have his word amen take him at his word praise God back to First Corinthians chapter 2. if you want to turn with me it's Corinthians there it is First Corinthians chapter two I want to go down to by God hath revealed on them unto but verse 10 sorry but God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit Spirit searcheth all things yea the Deep things of God for what man knoweth the things of man except or save the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God so what is it now it's the spirit in the word over one or that connection now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which of which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given us given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolish unto them neither can he know them but they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritually judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that ye may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ we have the mind of Christ by a spirit we have the mind of Christ amen do you believe that praise the Lord man we have a Spirit by the mind we have his have the mind of Christ by the spirit my brethren could not speak unto you let me let me see where we're at here for we have for we have the mind of Christ but by the Spirit by the spirit we have access to the wisdom of God real wisdom it's not the false wisdom that I was talking about it's it's the wisdom of God we have access to it by that Spirit we have access to the mind of God by that spirit amen amen the spirit and the word are one will not disagree with the other so when tempted try the spirit or thought see if it lines up with the word if not then flee it resist the devil and he will flee thought comes in this is just an example thought comes in let me see here James let's see James 1 1 through 8 let's go to the scripture here let me just pull it up I'll just read it from here James the servant of God in the Lord Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad greeting my brother encountered all joy when you fall into diverse Temptation Temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience thank you Lord but let patience have a perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire entire wanting nothing if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to giveth to all men liberally in a breadth not and it shall be given him but let him ask in faith where does it come back to it's Faith amen we're asking for God's wisdom and faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of seed driven With the Wind of tossed for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways beloved let him ask in faith that's what I was getting at nothing wavering so wisdom Cometh From The Spirit right it's that spirit that dwells in us that gives us give us gives us the wisdom First Corinthians 2 1-11 First Corinthians 12 1-11 so we're looking back in First Corinthians 12 which I found this so good today I'm not talking about because a lot of times we can we can uh I don't know get worked up in our young Christian walk about about Lord is is this the way is I need to speak in tongues or what needs to happen for me what's the evidence of the Holy Ghost what's what needs to happen right and we make certain things priorities in our mind of what needs to needs to happen right I remember brother Rapp talking about it we have this certain expectation we start we start um we start comparing our experiences with one another right and that's not it it's all the Lord's doing right you may not even know when the Lord started to work in your life amen but it was it started to work amen he's faithful to complete it do you believe that amen praise the Lord so it was just a first first Corinthians 12. and now concerning spiritual gifts rather than I would not have you ignorant you know that you were Gentiles carried away into the dumb idols even as you were LED wherefore I give you unto understanding that no man speaking by the spirit of God call us Jesus accursed and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost now there are diversities of gifts by The Same Spirit and there are differences of administrations by the same Lord but the same Lord and there are diversities of operations but is the same God would work with in all in all but the manifestations of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all four to one so here it goes through them for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to one the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit it's all by The Same Spirit here right to another to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh the one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one spirit it's by one Spirit right one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bound or free and have been all made to drink unto unto one spirit amen praise the Lord amen and God keeps his word talking about every Church getting getting every Church age getting it wrong after the word comes amen it's just the repeat of self of History and God gave them the smallest gift this is Pentecost God gave them the smallest gift this is back this is back before the bride age but God God gave them the smallest gifts and there were and they organized it says looky here the first gift in the line of gifts is wisdom the second is knowledge and if you don't have any wisdom how do you know what to do with knowledge seek the best thing first wisdom and if you got in if in it and if you ain't got wisdom what can you do with knowledge or speaking with tongues or these other things it takes wisdom it takes God's wisdom Solomon said call it your mother right amen so that was just exciting to me because it um we get so worked up with man Lord I got to do this I got to do this but with wisdom being the principal thing as Proverbs talks about wisdom is the principle of things in Proverbs first four and seven wisdom is the principle thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding but it's wisdom is the principle thing and we're not talking about man's Wisdom here we're talking about the wisdom of God Amen it's by faith we receive it wisdom Proverbs 1 we'll go back to Proverbs 1 20-33 it even please please God when when King Solomon asks for wisdom and this says the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked these things Solomon asked for wisdom and it pleased the Lord that he asked this he didn't ask for riches he didn't ask for those outward things he didn't ask for anything else he asked for the wisdom of God Amen praise the Lord so we're back in Proverbs one hope you're catching something tonight Proverbs 1 and verse I was one in verse 20. I just love how was uh Solomon puts this out him wisdom cryeth without she uttereth her voice in the streets streets she crieth in the chief place in The Concourse and the openings of the gates in the city she uttereth her words saying how long ye simple ones will you love simplicity it's wisdom calling out it wants you right it's God's wisdom calling out it wants you more than anything how long were these simple ones will you love Simplicity in the scorner's Delight in the scorning and Fool's hate knowledge turn you at my reproof behold I will pour out my spirit unto you I will make known my words unto you because I have called because I have called and ye refused and have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but ye have sat at night on my counsel and would none of my reproof I also laugh this is what wisdom is doing here I will laugh at your calamity I will laugh at your destruction because wisdom offering itself right wisdom and this is God speaking right it's God's wisdom one wanting wanting you to abide by the word of God right but also he will laugh he wisdom will laugh at your Calamity I will mock when your fear cometh we have Security in his word right but wisdom's laughing like it offers it to you but it it laughs because we're not we're not catching it right we're not latching hold of it we let distractions and other things take take take preeminence but it offers it when the 27 when you fear when your fear cometh as desolation your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish come upon you then shall thou call upon me but I will not answer thy shall seek me early but Thou shalt not find me and on let me see here where was I here 29 okay for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord and what is the fear of the Lord it's the beginning of wisdom amen they would they would none of my counsel they despised all my reproof therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices you can word that use that word interchangeably too filled with their own devices for the Turning Away of the simple shall slay them and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them but listen but whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from fear of evil there's no fear there's no fear when we have the word of God right there's no fear when we have that right and I believe any holy ghost-filled believer amen who has who has that within them amen he has that he has that and he there's no fear with that right he has that wisdom dwelling Within let me keep going here so make your decision now that it's going to be God's wisdom that you're going to trust not your own thinking if you'll do that you'll never go wrong amen that's a time of decision that's a quote what it had to be a Shepherd why it had to be a shepherd by bypass it by bypassing all the noble it bypassed all the Nobles of the land it bypassed all and was revealed to the nobodies Michael our song I'm just nobody trying to tell everybody all about somebody that saved my soul ever since he rescued me it gave my heart a song to sing I'm living for the world to cease nobody but Jesus amen praise the Lord I love that song it's me and Michael song we sing that one we sing that one amen all the Nobles that were decorated with with great doctors of divinity and psychology and high educations and great Cathedrals things it was all bypassed and revealed to nobodies it's revealed to babes the wisdom the infinite wisdom of almighty God did it to make known to them the greatest message that ever was the Messiah is now on Earth what a wisdom could only come from God who knows wisdom all the wisdom and all the schooling everything was laid to waste and bypassed by the great wisdom of God I keep repeating that because I want it to go down deep all laid to waste it was no good bypassed it all to let God's wisdom have the right of way that God takes the nothings and makes the something say Amen I'm going to contestify of that your testimony tonight lift your hand if you've got a testimony he makes the nobodies into somebody's amen praise the Lord what is it it's by his word changing you from the inside out amen praise the Lord hallelujah nobodies the true church that clings to the word of God for this present day inhabits the Eternal wisdom of God not wavering as James says it is hidden from the wise men of this world but revealed by his Spirit unto babes the nobodies yes his seed but God's grace he sends by God's grace he sends his word amen this was I know I'm not taking too long tonight but um but you know what I just uh I just had this I guess I get so much in my mind as far as my you know my thinking and my reasoning right and that's what my my dad's been talking about is stinking thinking right and so many things that can filter what what is our filter what is our true filter the word of God amen amen that's where every thought every person that comes to us every every voice amen it should be filtered through that word of God that should be our filter that's that's the principle thing amen amen he is our wisdom amen praise God this is uh this is a quote from this quote from the church age book how many have enjoyed brother rap in the church age the church I was teaching amen it's so it's almost like I was even hearing um brother rap He was talking about um like the security or the the faith we have in Christ but he was talking about your faith and I have got report after report of people just feeling so anchored after what he's preached about the Holy Ghost amen as we look at we look around and see what's happening maybe in a service of what's going on but amen it's just that security so we think brother rap and man and just him surrendering his word surrendering his his lips to his vessel to God Amen amen seven golden candlesticks this is from the fusion Church age um the Expedition here so the very end of the quote seven golden candle skits candlesticks and exodus 25 31 and it says and thou shalt make a Candlestick a pure gold of beaten work shall the Candlestick be made his shaft and his branches his bows his knobs and his flowers shall be of the same the true church now listen up the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes is his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect but he has what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to end she is the work of the Lord hallelujah and all his works are perfect listen in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God so that wisdom is already in you with this seed it's already in you all it needs to do is be expressed amen it's already in you it just you just gotta look in the mirror of his word and see it amen praise the Lord hallelujah thank you Lord so he says he says where was I here um in fact in her is summed up and manifests these Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for God hath spoken it right God has spoken it but not only is the candlestick of gold it is of beaten gold hand crafted of beaten gold according to the blueprints which is Spirit given outside of her Lord and Master Jesus Christ was ever was ever was ever a people so beat and encouraged as the Bride of Jesus Christ surely she is filling up she is filling up the sufferings that Christ has left behind her good is despoiled her life her life is in Jeopardy she is accounted as sheep for the slaughter she has killed all the day long she suffers much but it all retaliates not neither does she cause others to suffer worthy of the Gospel is the lovely bride of Christ and as gold is malleable whereas brass will break with a beating this gold of God will bear her suffering for the Lord not bowed not broken not destroyed but formed as a thing of beauty and of Joy Forever by the trials and testing of this life amen I believe the two ways two main ways we we get wisdom from God is this the building of character through testing and trial what is God what is God doing when he gives you a trial right he's establishing he's making that wisdom come out what is what what am I how do I react to certain situations right and by the word of God he gives us his word he gives us the word of his of of our day to to establish our wisdom in him right amen I could prove by the Bible that you're not in your right mind till you have found Christ that's right that's pretty strong but I can prove that by the scripture that's right you become beastly lustful in everything until you found Christ Jesus he's the lovely one I love this this is my last scripture here or this is my last quote here this is the questions and answers I just thought this was beautiful I hope it encourages you tonight now I'll admit that people study too much they think about it too much they tried to go as far ahead and try to think too hard sometimes have mental breakdowns at the things on account of studying about the Lord you must quit that you don't have to do that the only thing you have to do is fall in love with him Hallelujah and just go right on loving him amen it's not trying to push into something or make something make yourself something you're not just go ahead and let God use you in the way he wants to just yield yourself commit yourself and walk walk on Happy singing rejoicing that's the way amen fall in love with Jesus Christ amen that's where your wisdom wise that's the beginning the fear of the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom amen if you love them amen you have a reverent storm toward them you fear Him amen praise God Amen that's all I have for you tonight it was a short message but I hope you were you were encouraged tonight amen we can't rely on the wisdom of man amen we can't rely on our own stinking thinking amen but we rely on God's word and what he's given to us amen latch on to it take hold of it yourself amen we have this Bible amen we have the message of our day latch onto it get wisdom get understanding with all thy getting get Christ amen amen praise God Amen let's all stand tonight amen let's sing this song Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus I guess you can call me a short-winded preacher because we've got too many long-winded ones amen but that was that was rough wasn't it but um no that's uh you know it's just the the uniqueness of God Amen I guess but amen so I hope it blessed you tonight and uh just latch on to him amen catch catch with God what God is speaking to you don't let all these other distractions get you in the way of seeking his wisdom amen amen it's accessible to us amen we can touch it we have it right in front of us Go latch on to it amen
