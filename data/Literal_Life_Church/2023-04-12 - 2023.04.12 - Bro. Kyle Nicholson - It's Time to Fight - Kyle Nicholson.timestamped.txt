[0:00] amen amen
[0:03] I think musicians
[0:06] if we want to turn a night in our Bibles
[0:08] of Genesis 5 verse 24
[0:12] amen there's power in the name of Jesus
[0:20] Genesis 5 verse 24.
[0:22] and it says and Enoch walked with God
[0:25] and he was not for God took him
[0:28] so
[0:30] this is a good
[0:31] scripture Enoch walk with God and he was
[0:35] not for God took him
[0:37] that's pretty cool he was walking along
[0:39] and poof he was gone
[0:42] it'd be nice to get poofed
[0:44] and be gone
[0:46] but the problem is we're still here
[0:48] and that was Enoch's experience
[0:51] and we're still walking around
[0:53] and we're still on this Earth
[0:56] we have our own experiences
[0:58] we've all come to the Lord in different
[0:59] ways
[1:00] but it can get really easy and it's a
[1:02] common tactic of the devil for us to
[1:04] look at other people's experiences and
[1:06] look down on our own or just forget our
[1:08] own experiences
[1:11] because we come up with a measuring
[1:12] system that God never came up with you
[1:15] can have receipts sorry
[1:17] just getting right into it
[1:21] but we've come up with this measuring
[1:22] system that God never came up with we
[1:24] came up with as humans
[1:27] and we have a hard time not comparing
[1:28] ourselves to other people
[1:32] so
[1:34] we'd
[1:36] like to have a testimony
[1:39] we think we would like to compare
[1:41] ourselves to other people we have a
[1:42] really hard time with other people's
[1:44] testimonies we like to say things like
[1:46] man if I had a testimony like that or if
[1:48] I got a faith like that guy or pray like
[1:50] she does
[1:51] but the problem is that you don't
[1:53] understand
[1:54] is there's no difference between your
[1:55] testimony and their testimony you come
[1:57] up with a measuring system God never
[1:59] came up with that measuring system
[2:01] and I promise you that faith can move
[2:03] mountains comes at a very high price in
[2:05] prayer warriors are called prayer
[2:07] warriors because they've been through a
[2:08] lot of battles it didn't come very
[2:10] easily
[2:12] so if we go to Second Corinthians 12
[2:15] verse 12 for second Corinthians 12.
[2:18] second Corinthians 10 verse 12 sorry
[2:23] it says for we dare not make ourselves
[2:25] of the number or compare ourselves with
[2:28] some that command themselves but they
[2:30] measure themselves by themselves and
[2:32] comparing themselves among themselves
[2:33] are not wise and in the Amplified it
[2:36] says we don't have the audacity to put
[2:39] ourselves in the same class or compare
[2:40] ourselves with some who Supply
[2:42] testimonials to commend themselves when
[2:45] they measure themselves by themselves
[2:47] and compare themselves with themselves
[2:49] they lack wisdom and behave like fools
[2:54] so short versions don't compare
[2:55] yourselves
[2:57] but as humans we really struggle with it
[2:59] it's a lot easier said than done
[3:02] when people have what seems to be a very
[3:04] powerful story and in its own right it
[3:07] is it seems really great and we want to
[3:10] think man if only I had that if only I
[3:12] had that
[3:13] but glory to God for the fiery furnace
[3:17] testimony and I've said it before and
[3:18] I'll say it again because the bear is
[3:19] repeating when we can walk through the
[3:22] fire furnace of life and not even smell
[3:23] like smoke because God has protected us
[3:26] that's a testimony
[3:28] but we forget that we forget our own
[3:30] testimony and we like to look at other
[3:32] people's experiences we don't stick to
[3:34] what God has given us
[3:36] we just keep looking around we get
[3:38] distracted and the devil likes to do
[3:40] that
[3:41] you just keep keep steady with the Lord
[3:43] you're born and raised in church just a
[3:45] good church girl they say you're naive
[3:46] you say this say you're just really
[3:48] innocent like it's a bad thing it's not
[3:50] a bad thing
[3:51] God gave you a very powerful testimony
[3:53] God kept you through the fire furnace of
[3:56] life and you don't even smell like smoke
[3:58] some of us reek like smoke
[4:00] we didn't do any of that things
[4:02] we we came through this and you can tell
[4:05] we came through it
[4:06] unlike the ones that came through with
[4:09] God's protection over them the whole
[4:10] time
[4:12] and that's a real testimony
[4:15] so now we know Enoch's experience and we
[4:17] know we shouldn't compare
[4:19] but we got to try to get the Enoch's
[4:21] level right so is there a level what's
[4:24] Enoch's level what's his Christian level
[4:25] is it 50 is it 100 how do you get to
[4:28] where he got
[4:29] what level is he and what level are you
[4:33] so we like to think that there's levels
[4:36] so we like to compare ourselves to other
[4:38] people's levels and we say oh we don't
[4:40] do that we don't compare ourselves well
[4:41] then we start with again like I said we
[4:43] wish this we wish we could have this I
[4:44] wish I was happy like that if only I
[4:46] could come up to where that person is
[4:48] I'd be okay
[4:50] levels we keep comparing levels and we
[4:53] come up with levels
[4:55] so
[4:56] what level was Enoch
[4:58] if you compare the enox level to the man
[5:01] on the cross next to Jesus what level
[5:03] was he
[5:04] were they on the same level
[5:06] what do they do differently so if you
[5:09] compare Enoch to the woman at the well
[5:10] if you compare Enoch to the adulterous
[5:12] woman what level was adulterous woman
[5:15] why does she get what she got and Enoch
[5:18] got what he got
[5:20] we think there's levels
[5:23] every time
[5:27] we just continue to think that there's
[5:28] levels to this and every time somebody
[5:30] comes to the lord it's a different
[5:32] experience
[5:33] my experience is different than yours
[5:34] Brandon's experience is different than
[5:35] mine everyone's experience was different
[5:37] God did the same thing every time but
[5:40] everybody's experience was different
[5:43] we all seen it differently he did the
[5:44] exact same thing we all repented we came
[5:47] to the Lord but we all came through it
[5:49] in a different way
[5:51] because there's not levels to this
[5:52] there's a position God's put us in
[5:55] positions in his army of God if there's
[5:57] anything he's called us to it's not a
[5:58] level it's a position in the army of God
[6:00] and we have to stay in this position and
[6:03] find this position
[6:04] and God uses Us in different positions
[6:06] in all sorts of different things and we
[6:08] all have a position no matter what the
[6:10] devil tells us
[6:12] so Roman soldiers made famous it was it
[6:15] was famous before they did it but Roman
[6:17] soldiers were the first real
[6:20] professional soldiers arguably they were
[6:22] paid for what they did they're very
[6:24] highly trained and they had a lot of
[6:26] different tactics that they used with
[6:27] shields so one thing that they did was
[6:29] called the the tortoise
[6:33] um The Tortoise formation so if we had
[6:35] that picture and put that up it'll make
[6:37] more sense how the Roman soldiers would
[6:39] carry their Shields so the only way this
[6:42] would work is everyone had a shield and
[6:44] you protected the front the guy behind
[6:46] you protected over your head and the guy
[6:48] next to you would protect next to you
[6:50] and they could push into the wall and
[6:53] not get hurt with arrows not get hurt
[6:54] with these things and the Romans
[6:55] perfected this
[6:57] but it only worked if everyone was in
[6:59] their position and everyone locked their
[7:01] Shield so as they're doing this go to
[7:04] the next one
[7:05] as they're doing this
[7:07] all the shields are laying on the other
[7:09] guy's head
[7:10] or laying on the shield in front of them
[7:12] and they could squat down like this and
[7:15] it was almost impenetrable they would
[7:16] actually use it to get across Rivers
[7:19] because they couldn't it wouldn't move
[7:21] it was that strong but it took everyone
[7:24] to be in their exact position and know
[7:26] that the guy next to them was doing what
[7:29] he was supposed to do to make it work
[7:30] and if they could do it it was almost
[7:33] impenetrable they could lock down like
[7:35] that and just stay there and they could
[7:37] throw everything at them and nothing
[7:38] would happen but if somebody moved and
[7:41] so many changed positions you'd open up
[7:43] a hole in that and it would start to
[7:45] come apart everything is interlocked
[7:46] together if you're not resting it on the
[7:48] guy in front of his head and the guy
[7:50] behind you is not resting on your head
[7:52] it doesn't work
[7:53] and that's the only way that it can work
[7:55] is everyone in their position
[7:58] to make this work
[8:01] so we have to find our position
[8:04] and if we don't have our position we
[8:06] have a hole in our in our Shields they
[8:09] still use the tortoise formation today
[8:11] they still use it in riots so in a riot
[8:13] they can do all this and push their way
[8:15] into a crowd and push their way into a
[8:17] dangerous situation and come around
[8:19] somebody and that's how they can pull
[8:21] them back out of that situation and
[8:23] protect them as they're doing it in the
[8:25] British Riot police are pretty famous
[8:27] for doing this they're well known for
[8:29] perfecting this and using it still to
[8:31] this day to keep people out of dangerous
[8:33] situations or to rescue them
[8:36] so we know we should have a position we
[8:38] know that there's not levels but why are
[8:40] we not in our position how do we get out
[8:42] of our position
[8:44] so
[8:45] the short of it is we get distracted we
[8:47] start looking around we get all locked
[8:50] together in these shields and then we
[8:51] start to get distracted we can't stay
[8:53] focused on God stay in our experiences
[8:55] and work in our position we start
[8:58] looking the guy next to us
[9:00] and wondering why I see in that spot
[9:03] and I'm in this spot I want to be in
[9:05] that spot
[9:06] that guy's cooler than me he's in the
[9:08] front I want to be that guy we start
[9:10] looking around we start getting
[9:12] distracted
[9:13] and we don't we start to compare
[9:15] ourselves we start to get distracted and
[9:16] all these things
[9:18] and we start saying well that dude ain't
[9:20] holding the shield up straight he's not
[9:21] doing that right if I was holding that
[9:23] Shield I would hold that Shield way
[9:25] better than that guy's holding that
[9:26] Shield
[9:27] if I was in that position we would have
[9:30] no problems over there
[9:31] we keep getting distracted we keep
[9:33] looking around
[9:35] so we start thinking more and more you
[9:38] know who's running this anyways who's
[9:40] telling these guys to hold these shields
[9:42] in these positions I would hold them in
[9:43] a totally different angle if I was in
[9:45] charge of the shield formation it would
[9:47] be way better
[9:48] but I've got to find a way to get in
[9:50] charge of this formation because we
[9:52] can't stay in our position we can't just
[9:54] stay locked in next to our brother and
[9:56] stay there and protect what we're
[9:58] supposed to be protecting we want to go
[10:00] to a different position we cannot stay
[10:02] in our experiences we can keep comparing
[10:05] so then we start measuring
[10:07] why do I have to put in more work than
[10:09] that guy
[10:10] I'm holding this thing up and there's a
[10:12] horse walking over my head
[10:14] why do I have to be that guy why can't I
[10:16] be the other guy that's on the side we
[10:18] start measuring I'm doing way more work
[10:20] than that guy's doing we like to measure
[10:22] things we like to put in equal shares
[10:24] and again we've come up with a measuring
[10:26] God never came up with us
[10:29] so we start picking and choosing who
[10:31] should be in what position and who
[10:32] should be in that position and who's who
[10:35] but the past is a position the floor
[10:37] sweeper is a position the church Locker
[10:38] upper guy is a position but we don't
[10:41] like those positions we want to be in a
[10:43] different position because that position
[10:44] is better the song leader is a way
[10:46] cooler position than sweeping the floors
[10:48] but if you were in that position you
[10:51] wouldn't like that one either
[10:52] because you're not content with the
[10:54] position God puts you in at that time
[10:56] God can use you right where you are
[10:58] there's a reason he puts you there
[11:00] there's a reason you went through
[11:02] everything you did because you're
[11:03] supposed to be right there and stop
[11:05] moving around stop looking around stay
[11:07] in your position and hold that Shield
[11:09] we've got to stay in our place and we've
[11:12] got to stay with our Shield
[11:15] so
[11:16] we can we can't keep looking around we
[11:18] can't keep trying to figure out why'd
[11:20] God put those people there why is that
[11:22] guy in charge I don't understand there's
[11:25] way better people yeah you're probably
[11:26] right there probably is more worldly
[11:29] qualified people to do that job but God
[11:31] had it that way for a reason because
[11:33] whatever reason God came up with that's
[11:35] why but God can use that man because he
[11:39] can listen that's why he's in that
[11:41] position and would somebody who is a
[11:44] better leader technically wouldn't want
[11:46] to listen to God wouldn't want to do the
[11:48] things well right now that doesn't make
[11:49] any sense yeah because you don't really
[11:50] get a story God knows the end of the
[11:52] story he's doing all these things for a
[11:54] reason
[11:55] so if we get distracted from this we can
[11:57] get ourselves in a lot of trouble
[11:59] so we go to Matthew 23
[12:01] and start at verse 1.
[12:05] Matthew 23 verse 1.
[12:09] and it says
[12:11] then speak Jesus to the multitude and
[12:12] we'll just keep going through the verses
[12:13] and to his disciples
[12:16] verse 2 saying the scribes and the
[12:18] Pharisees sit in Moses's seat
[12:20] all therefore whatsoever they bid You
[12:23] observe that observe and do but do not
[12:25] ye after their words for they say and do
[12:28] not
[12:29] for they bind heavy burdens and Grievous
[12:31] to Bear to bore and lay them on men's
[12:34] shoulders but they themselves will not
[12:36] move them with one of their of their
[12:38] fingers
[12:39] but all their Works they do for to be
[12:42] seen of men they make Broad
[12:45] their factories and enlarge the borders
[12:47] of their garments
[12:49] keep going
[12:50] and love and love the uppermost room and
[12:53] feast of the chief seats in the
[12:54] synagogues
[12:56] and greetings in the markets can be
[12:57] called men Rabbi rabbi
[13:00] but be not ye called Rabbi for one is
[13:03] your master even Christ and all ye are
[13:05] brethren
[13:06] and to call no man your father upon the
[13:08] Earth for one is your father which is in
[13:10] heaven
[13:11] neither be ye called Masters for one is
[13:13] your master even Christ
[13:16] but the greatest among you shall be your
[13:18] servant
[13:20] and whosoever so exalt himself shall be
[13:23] abased and he that shall humble himself
[13:26] shall be exalted
[13:28] but woe unto you scribes and Pharisees
[13:30] Hypocrites for you shut up the Kingdom
[13:32] of Heaven against men for you neither go
[13:34] in yourselves either suffer ye them that
[13:36] are entered to go in
[13:39] what one do you scribes and Pharisees
[13:40] you Hypocrites for you devour wisdoms
[13:42] widows houses and for your pretense make
[13:45] long prayer for therefore ye shall
[13:47] receive the greater damnation
[13:49] we'll want to use scribes in versus
[13:50] Hypocrites for ye can pass see in land
[13:53] to make one apostolite and when he made
[13:56] you make him twofold more the child of
[13:58] Hell than yourselves
[14:00] woe unto you blind guides which say
[14:03] whatsoever shall swear by the temple and
[14:06] if we skip to
[14:08] verse 23 it says won't use scribes and
[14:12] Pharisees of Hypocrites for you pay
[14:13] tithe the mint and ananias and cumin and
[14:16] have omitted the weightier matters of
[14:18] law judgment and mercy and faith
[14:21] these are ye have done and not leave the
[14:23] other undone
[14:25] ye blind guides which strain in a gnat
[14:28] and swallow a camel woe under you
[14:31] scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you
[14:32] make clean the outside of the cup of the
[14:35] platter but within are full of extortion
[14:37] and excess Thou blind Pharisee clean
[14:40] first that which is within the cup and
[14:42] platter and then the outside may be
[14:44] clean also we'll want to use scribes of
[14:46] Pharisees Hypocrites for ye are like
[14:49] unto Whited sepulchers which indeed
[14:51] appear beautiful outward but within full
[14:54] of Dead Man's Bones Jesus holds no
[14:56] punches when he goes through this
[14:58] and of all uncleanness even so also
[15:01] outward appearance righteous unto men
[15:03] but within ye are full of hypocrisy and
[15:05] iniquity Lo want to use scribes and
[15:08] Pharisees because ye build tombs of the
[15:10] prophets in which garnish some occurs of
[15:13] righteousness and say if we had been in
[15:15] the days of our fathers we would not
[15:17] have partaken with the blood of the
[15:19] prophets
[15:20] wherefore ye be Witnesses unto
[15:22] yourselves that ye are children of them
[15:24] which killed the prophets
[15:26] fill ye up the measure of your fathers
[15:29] so if we don't stop looking around we
[15:33] can turn into Pharisees pretty quickly
[15:35] because we like to start thinking we're
[15:37] supposed to be standing there with our
[15:38] shield in our position but we'd like to
[15:40] start thinking
[15:41] well what is that guy doing
[15:43] why does that guy look like that we
[15:45] start looking around we start thinking I
[15:47] would do better if I was back then I
[15:50] wouldn't kill the prophets but Jesus
[15:52] said you're the children over them which
[15:54] killed the prophets
[15:56] we start to think that if we did it we
[15:59] wouldn't have so much problems but then
[16:01] we start jumping over law judgment Mercy
[16:04] we start choking on a gnat we start
[16:07] straining at a gnat to swallow a camel
[16:09] because we keep getting distracted from
[16:11] what we're supposed to be doing
[16:13] we become Pharisees very quickly because
[16:16] what does a Christian walk look like
[16:18] this is a problem we start to think like
[16:20] the Pharisees this is the way that it
[16:22] should look if our garments are perfect
[16:24] if everything's perfect the outside of
[16:27] the cup looks amazing but woe unto you
[16:29] Hypocrites it's a problem we start to
[16:32] think well we have a 10-step program to
[16:34] a better Christian but what does a
[16:35] better Christian look like what does a
[16:37] Christian look like what does adulterous
[16:39] Woman's Christian walk look like
[16:41] compared to Enochs why were they
[16:43] different they're not the same in any
[16:45] way whatsoever but we come up with this
[16:47] guideline we come up with in our heads
[16:49] of thinking this is the way that it
[16:51] should be this is how it should be it
[16:53] shouldn't look like that those people
[16:55] shouldn't be doing that and you might
[16:56] not be completely wrong in that but
[16:58] that's their walk it's not your walk and
[17:01] the problem comes when you start to
[17:02] bring yourself into their walk and start
[17:04] saying hey Lord just hold on a second
[17:06] I'll show you about how to do this give
[17:08] me a minute with this guy and you want
[17:10] to clean everything up make sure you do
[17:12] this make sure you do that you don't
[17:14] know where they are
[17:15] and you start to skip over the important
[17:18] steps of what actually matters to get
[17:21] that person where they want to be we get
[17:23] so focused on Doctrine that we forget
[17:26] the actual beginning steps of what we
[17:28] should have done with these people we
[17:30] start to become Pharisees we start to
[17:32] become Dead Man's Bones there's a reason
[17:34] Jesus only did this to the Pharisees he
[17:38] did not say this to adulterous woman he
[17:39] did not say this to the woman at the
[17:40] well he did not say this to the man at
[17:42] the cross he said it to the really
[17:44] religious people who looked really good
[17:46] and had everything in order
[17:48] he held no punches when he ripped them
[17:52] apart when he did this he held nothing
[17:54] back
[17:56] so we start to think that we know what's
[17:59] best for these people well you shouldn't
[18:01] do that don't be doing this God will get
[18:03] people into their position no matter
[18:05] what he has to do to do it and we can
[18:07] stand right in the way of it of what
[18:09] he's trying to do because we think we
[18:11] got this Lord just take a seat for a
[18:13] minute
[18:14] we'll show you how this is done
[18:16] because we think we know what a
[18:18] Christian life looks like but you look
[18:20] through the Bible what one isn't messy
[18:23] a Christian Life is usually messy
[18:25] Moses's life was pretty messy Moses
[18:28] messed up arguably to the very end
[18:31] Moses didn't get a lot of things right
[18:33] and then when Moses shows up of anybody
[18:35] that wasn't shouldn't have been the guy
[18:37] to do it he couldn't talk right
[18:39] so if I showed up and said I have a
[18:42] message which I couldn't say right and I
[18:44] said Gideon's going to say these words
[18:46] would you even listen to me that's the
[18:48] problem is we get so focused on this is
[18:51] how it's supposed to come this is what
[18:53] it's supposed to look like this is how
[18:55] the Lord moves no Lord does what the
[18:57] Lord wants to do that's why the Lord
[18:59] used a man who had a speech problem to
[19:02] bring the people out of Egypt that's why
[19:05] he did it because he does what he wants
[19:07] to do
[19:08] so we get stuck on these things though
[19:10] as humans we get stuck on the doctrine
[19:12] we get stuck on things that's supposed
[19:13] to look just right well that guy is not
[19:15] qualified nobody's qualified
[19:18] we came up with the qualifications we
[19:21] think this guy's got to have everything
[19:22] together it's got to work just like this
[19:24] the qualifications have to be so perfect
[19:27] I'm not qualified to do this job if
[19:31] you've known me from the beginning you
[19:33] would know that I'm not qualified to do
[19:34] this job I should not be able to do what
[19:37] I'm doing I've stolen from a store until
[19:39] they fired me for it I've done all these
[19:42] things I've done the drugs I've done all
[19:43] these things I should not be the guy for
[19:46] this job I'm not qualified to do it I
[19:48] didn't know how to read until I was in
[19:50] the 10th grade I should not be the guy
[19:52] for this job I'm completely unqualified
[19:54] but we're never qualified that's the
[19:57] problem is we wanted to look a certain
[19:59] way we come up with this whole thing
[20:00] this is how it's supposed to look and
[20:02] then the second that person does
[20:03] something you say whoa whoa wait a
[20:05] minute why'd you do that that's not how
[20:07] it's supposed to go because you're
[20:09] looking to the man you weren't looking
[20:11] at Jesus you weren't looking at the
[20:12] right things that you're supposed to be
[20:13] looking at you were looking at the man
[20:14] and the man will fall the man will mess
[20:16] up
[20:17] Moses came to the very end Moses had
[20:20] walked through the Wilderness with these
[20:22] people Manna had fallen from the heavens
[20:24] all these amazing things that happened
[20:26] and they wind the entire time they threw
[20:30] a fit the entire time if he left them
[20:33] alone for 10 seconds they went off and
[20:35] did something stupid
[20:37] and he had to stay with them all the
[20:39] time he had to do all these things
[20:40] because everything was going like it
[20:43] should they were just walking through
[20:45] the desert and food fell on them
[20:48] it couldn't get more perfect how do you
[20:50] get rid of all the trash these people
[20:52] made how do you do all of these things
[20:54] but it got done miraculously but still
[20:58] they get stuck on well Lord's not here
[21:00] he's not here anymore
[21:01] you know we just we ain't got nothing
[21:03] now we ain't got no water
[21:05] we can't do anything now we ain't got no
[21:07] water everyone's gonna die everyone's
[21:09] gonna die and then the water came again
[21:12] and then the next day well we ain't got
[21:14] no water again where everybody's gonna
[21:15] die we're all done for so Moses walk
[21:18] with these people and had to deal with
[21:19] all these things and at the end did one
[21:22] thing he got mad
[21:24] and by our measuring he had a right to
[21:27] be mad he had to listen to these people
[21:28] whine about God do these amazing things
[21:30] his whole life
[21:32] and it never got better they whined the
[21:35] whole time
[21:36] then at the end all he said was ye
[21:38] Rebels and smacked a stick on a rock
[21:40] because he got mad
[21:42] and Lord said you're done
[21:45] you're all done
[21:46] you can't go in the Promised Land
[21:48] and he showed him the promised land and
[21:51] he didn't get to go in it it was a messy
[21:54] deal David was a messy deal it didn't
[21:57] look like anything it should have Moses
[21:59] murdered a guy so did David if we had
[22:02] those people now times they'd be in
[22:04] prison for the things that they had done
[22:06] but God called them God wanted that guy
[22:10] because that guy would listen because he
[22:13] knew he could get him in the right
[22:14] position to get him to do what needed to
[22:16] be done and he had a purpose for it
[22:19] but we get tossed to and fro we get
[22:21] thrown all over the place on this stuff
[22:23] and we get so stuck on men because it's
[22:25] so much easier to look to a man to do
[22:27] these things for us instead of us
[22:29] looking to God do them for ourselves
[22:31] and we want to make sure well you know
[22:33] if I just get this right get my dress
[22:35] right get all my stuff right then we'll
[22:36] be all good to go and that stuff's not
[22:38] wrong Doctrine is not wrong at all it
[22:40] should be there but the problem is we
[22:42] skip right over the ABCs instantly Jesus
[22:45] simplified everything that he did every
[22:48] time he was asked a question it was a
[22:49] simple answer
[22:50] he didn't get elaborate into any of the
[22:52] things that he said they wanted huge
[22:54] they had questions and they want a
[22:56] Pharisee type answer and he said just
[22:58] love God with everything he got and love
[23:01] your brother the same that's all he said
[23:03] that's a total letdown for those guys
[23:05] they had devoted their whole life to
[23:07] this and then finally this guy shows up
[23:09] and says that he knows all the answers
[23:10] and you broke it down into a sentence
[23:13] are you kidding me we've been carrying
[23:15] these Scrolls around they would carry
[23:16] them on them they would carry them in
[23:18] the boxes that they had on them that's
[23:20] what I was talking about with the
[23:21] phylacteries and different things like
[23:23] that
[23:24] and then you came up and it's just a
[23:26] sentence that's all I need to know
[23:27] that's it it was the greatest
[23:28] commandment so what do we need to do to
[23:30] get into heaven
[23:31] just be converted and be a child
[23:34] what are you talking about I devoted my
[23:37] whole life to this and then you tell me
[23:40] to be a kid about it you tell me to have
[23:42] just be a kid what are you talking about
[23:44] how can we be a child they don't know
[23:45] anything that's the point that is the
[23:48] point
[23:49] we have to break down everything that we
[23:51] think we know or else we become Dead
[23:53] Man's Bones we become perfect on the
[23:56] outside and nothing's happening on the
[23:57] inside
[24:00] so
[24:01] so Jesus sent us out to spread the
[24:03] gospel
[24:04] it was that simple that's what he sent
[24:06] us out to do
[24:07] so what does the gospel mean and I got
[24:09] this a friend of mine was talking to me
[24:11] about this and he said that
[24:13] um his name's white herb his nickname I
[24:15] have for him but the gospel means the
[24:18] good news so we were set up to spread
[24:20] the good news of Jesus but we don't
[24:22] always like to spread the good news of
[24:24] Jesus because it's way too simple
[24:26] we can't walk up to somebody and say if
[24:28] you just love God with everything you
[24:30] have that's all you got to do well I've
[24:32] done that well then the world gets mixed
[24:35] into this and makes it really simple is
[24:37] it's not just in saying the words that's
[24:39] the problem we say the words but then we
[24:43] don't do anything about it yeah I just
[24:45] love Jesus with everything I have well
[24:47] we have to do something we have to move
[24:49] we have to be able to get into God's
[24:51] position and do what he told us to do
[24:53] but we don't like to do that
[24:55] it's easier just to say the words I love
[24:57] God with everything I have but we'd like
[24:59] to skip right over that and Skip into
[25:01] the doctrine because we like to take
[25:02] control of this stuff and we think we
[25:04] know what's going on and we have no idea
[25:06] what's going on
[25:08] but we like to get them in and say Hey
[25:09] you know just do this this and this and
[25:10] this this and you're all good and
[25:12] everything and you got to read these
[25:14] books and you got to hear these tapes
[25:16] and you got to make sure you have this
[25:17] set up your dress set up have your long
[25:19] hair got to make sure you cut your hair
[25:21] don't listen to rock and roll we're
[25:23] getting all these things and we wonder
[25:25] why down the road they're gone
[25:27] because they never got anchored in
[25:30] loving God with everything they had
[25:34] it's that simple but we complicate it as
[25:37] much as humanly possible because it
[25:40] can't be that simple because we keep
[25:43] going right back to the Pharisees
[25:45] um it can't be that simple and there's
[25:47] got to be more to it
[25:48] and there's not more to it there's not
[25:51] more to it at all
[25:54] but the mega churches take on this stuff
[25:56] and they say this
[25:58] you know we just love the Lord we just
[25:59] love the Lord we love the Lord and
[26:01] nothing's happened
[26:02] there's a real love of the Lord if we
[26:05] get the love of the Lord and we love him
[26:06] with everything we have that the Bible
[26:08] is talking about
[26:10] the doctrine will come into place
[26:12] we don't have to do the doctrine side of
[26:14] things we have to spread the good news
[26:16] of Jesus the gospel and he will take it
[26:19] from there
[26:20] we have to learn who Jesus was
[26:24] so who is Jesus
[26:26] Jesus is Love but it's easy to say Jesus
[26:29] is Love and that's overused and we think
[26:31] yeah we get it guy we've got tons of
[26:34] those tracks at Jesus's love cool
[26:37] but who is Jesus who is Jesus to you
[26:40] what experience do you have with Jesus
[26:42] that's the point of it what did Jesus do
[26:44] for you when did he become real to you
[26:47] everything rides on that that is the
[26:50] true love of God is when he becomes real
[26:52] to you Jesus is a man that hung on Cross
[26:55] for you
[27:01] guys it didn't work for the maniac
[27:03] guitar the daughters woman was a
[27:05] different scenario the woman at the well
[27:07] why would he come up with this woman who
[27:09] had all these different husbands
[27:11] why would he do that and then started
[27:13] everything with her and she ran down and
[27:16] told everybody what happened why would
[27:19] he do that why wouldn't he come to the
[27:21] mega church guy Pastor Steve
[27:24] he didn't do that he came to the woman
[27:27] at the well who
[27:29] me that's the love of Jesus he showed up
[27:34] where you needed him to be and he always
[27:37] will but we get distracted because we
[27:41] can't stay where we're supposed to stay
[27:43] we want to wander off so does this work
[27:46] now can we pull up John 14 21 if not
[27:50] I've got it
[27:52] John 14 21.
[27:55] this is the point
[27:57] of all this
[28:01] you're good
[28:03] I can yell
[28:06] um John 14 21 so it says
[28:08] he that hath my Commandments and keepeth
[28:10] them he it is that loveth me and he it
[28:12] is that loveth me shall be loved of my
[28:14] father and I will love him and will
[28:17] manifest myself to him so in the
[28:19] Amplified that says that he will make
[28:21] himself real to you so the point is
[28:23] Jesus does the work we don't do the work
[28:26] but we think we do Jesus said if you
[28:29] love me I will manifest myself to you
[28:31] the doctrine will come all that stuff
[28:34] will show up but the problem is if you
[28:36] don't get Anchored In Jesus it's
[28:38] everything it is everything and if you
[28:42] don't think it's not everything go to
[28:43] John 15 5. John 15 5 he says and I am
[28:47] the vine ye are the branches ye that
[28:49] abideth in me and I in him the same
[28:51] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[28:53] ye can do nothing
[28:55] you can do nothing without Jesus but we
[28:58] think we can show up and box it up and
[29:01] tweak it a little bit make it just a
[29:02] touch better and there you go guy
[29:04] give that a shot see if that fits it
[29:07] won't fit it won't work because you
[29:09] don't know what you're doing you don't
[29:11] know why that person has to go through
[29:13] what they have to go through and we get
[29:15] stuck on that stuff why is this
[29:17] happening because it has to I don't know
[29:19] why but it has to why did that person
[29:22] have nothing happen and this person had
[29:24] everything happen to them I don't know
[29:27] why but it had to because that
[29:29] experience had to happen that way we
[29:31] have to do that and God will not
[29:33] override our Free Will so we can mess
[29:36] this up really bad he was trying to get
[29:39] us to go this way but again we boxed
[29:41] them up this is how it's supposed to go
[29:43] I'm going this way and he's going to let
[29:45] you go that way and mess everything up
[29:48] and then he's going to bring you back
[29:50] around he's going to do whatever it has
[29:51] to take to do that and it can look messy
[29:54] it can look like drugs it can look like
[29:56] addiction it can look like depression it
[29:58] can look like leaving the church but God
[30:00] will bring those people back around
[30:01] they're not gone we think well you know
[30:05] they went out from us because they
[30:06] weren't Among Us
[30:07] but no they're just going out and doing
[30:10] what they have to do I don't coming back
[30:13] but I don't know they're not coming back
[30:14] that's the problem is we write them off
[30:17] well they're not doing this right and
[30:18] they're not this right and they don't
[30:19] have the right doctor here and here and
[30:21] here do they love Jesus
[30:23] that's the point this scripture you
[30:26] can't argue with the scripture if you
[30:27] love God he will manifest himself he
[30:31] promised it it will happen and if we
[30:34] don't you if we don't have Jesus we
[30:36] can't do anything
[30:38] he said it we can't go against that
[30:41] so if we just love him with everything
[30:42] we have if we have depression Jesus can
[30:45] fix that if we're out of our position
[30:46] Jesus can fix that if we're addicted
[30:49] Jesus can fix that this is a problem if
[30:51] suicide Jesus can fix that if we have no
[30:54] friends Jesus could fix that we just
[30:56] have to come and get some Jesus but the
[30:58] problem is we're stuck on something
[31:00] we're stuck on a man we love to be stuck
[31:03] on humans all the time and we're right
[31:07] there we can't get over it well this guy
[31:09] did me wrong people will always do you
[31:11] wrong they will do you wrong all the
[31:13] time humans can't help it we will do
[31:16] something wrong and they will do us
[31:18] wrong that is how it goes it shouldn't
[31:20] go that way but it does and then we get
[31:23] stuck right there but the problem is we
[31:25] can't walk down the middle of the road
[31:27] either so when these things start to
[31:28] happen and we start coming up with
[31:30] things and things are happening around
[31:31] everywhere doctrinal things are
[31:33] happening we can't stay right in the
[31:35] middle of the road and say I don't
[31:36] really know about that yet but I'm just
[31:38] going to keep walking with the Lord we
[31:39] can't do that we start to throw
[31:41] everything out well that doesn't match
[31:43] up this timeline doesn't match up that
[31:45] didn't really happen this was a little
[31:47] bit off and then we just start throwing
[31:49] everything out instead of staying right
[31:51] in the middle of the road and letting
[31:53] God reveal it to us in our own
[31:54] experiences we have no idea what we're
[31:57] doing we don't want to stay in our
[32:00] experience because that one's way better
[32:03] but it's not yours
[32:05] God has your experience he knows how to
[32:08] work with you he knows what you need and
[32:11] it doesn't look like what the other guy
[32:12] needs it looks like what you need and
[32:14] that's the problem
[32:17] so the point is
[32:19] it's time to fight
[32:21] we're in the fight of Our Lives
[32:23] and we're not even in our positions
[32:25] we don't even know what we're doing
[32:27] we're just running around like chickens
[32:28] with our heads cut off and it's time to
[32:30] fight
[32:31] because have we seen what's going on in
[32:32] the world
[32:34] we're literally teaching our children to
[32:36] mutilate their bodies
[32:38] we're literally helping them do it and
[32:41] we're paying for it to happen
[32:42] permanently altering them at 12 years
[32:45] old 14 years old and 12 year olds make
[32:48] really bad decisions they just do they
[32:51] don't know what they're doing 20 year
[32:53] olds make really bad decisions some 30
[32:55] year olds make really bad decisions
[32:57] but we're encouraging them to do it and
[32:59] that's what's happening in this world
[33:00] and we're in the fight of our lives and
[33:02] we don't even realize it
[33:04] when we're in the world where the lgbtq
[33:06] thing has more influence than we do
[33:09] because we're not doing anything about
[33:11] it we're out of position we're not
[33:13] staying where God has us we're not
[33:15] staying right there in God's word
[33:18] doing what we're supposed to be doing
[33:19] we're out of position we've got to find
[33:22] that position we keep thinking it looks
[33:25] like this it looks like that and we want
[33:28] it to be a certain way I would want it
[33:31] to be different I'm a bit of a pit bull
[33:32] when I get on something I will just get
[33:34] stuck to it and I will rip it to pieces
[33:37] and I don't always want to be that guy
[33:39] I'd like to be Solomon Solomon just
[33:41] loves and he would just love a sheep
[33:43] back into the herd and it would be great
[33:46] and he would just come on guy it's going
[33:49] to be okay and Solomon can do that
[33:51] that's Solomon's position and it doesn't
[33:53] mean that positions won't swap that's a
[33:55] problem is you keep boxing God up
[33:57] Solomon always has to do that doesn't
[33:59] mean God's not going to call him to do
[34:00] something different I would show up with
[34:01] that sheep and break its leg and carry
[34:04] it back and stop running off now now you
[34:06] know don't do that anymore but it
[34:09] doesn't mean that God's not going to
[34:10] hold me not going to make me do it in a
[34:12] different way
[34:13] we box got up every time God does what
[34:16] he wants to do but we have to be in our
[34:19] position and ready for whatever he has
[34:21] for us whatever that looks like if we
[34:23] have to go correct something then we
[34:25] need to go correct that if we're going
[34:27] to go love that person more then we need
[34:28] to go love that person more and we have
[34:30] to learn how to do that we can't keep
[34:33] boxing up well listen this is my
[34:34] personality just how I am no it's
[34:37] because you're stubborn and you're not
[34:38] listening because you're out of position
[34:40] you want this certain position I don't
[34:42] want to do that that's not that just
[34:44] doesn't really it's not how I do things
[34:45] it's not how I do things it doesn't
[34:46] matter it's how God does things but we
[34:49] get stuck on what we want to do not what
[34:51] God wants to do we want to make sure
[34:53] that we're in the position that we think
[34:55] is best
[34:56] so
[34:57] we're in the fight of Our Lives if I had
[34:59] a title for this it'd be it's time to
[35:00] fight I don't know if I said that in the
[35:01] beginning but now we know so we're we're
[35:04] in the fight of our lives and you say
[35:05] why you're being a little bit extreme do
[35:07] you know what's happening in the world
[35:08] do you know what the second leading
[35:11] cause of death is for 10 or 35 year olds
[35:13] have you thought about it if you think
[35:14] about it for a second what did you think
[35:15] it was would you think it's cancer would
[35:18] you think it's sickness
[35:20] what would you think it is it's suicide
[35:23] ten-year-olds are more likely to commit
[35:25] suicide than die almost any other way
[35:28] 10 year old children do this
[35:30] because we have perverted everything in
[35:33] this world so badly we have brought
[35:36] things away from God to our own
[35:38] understanding so badly that little kids
[35:42] come up with a way that it's better not
[35:44] to be here anymore they came up with
[35:47] that because someone showed them that
[35:49] they've seen that how did they know to
[35:51] do that but it's the world that we live
[35:54] in it's falling apart the lgbtq the
[35:57] transgender thing is skyrocketing all of
[36:00] a sudden because it's falling apart
[36:02] they're trying to find their identity
[36:04] they're trying to find their position
[36:06] but we just made a bunch of Pharisees
[36:09] out of everything and went full Pharisee
[36:10] on it and started telling them well this
[36:12] is what you got to do no they have
[36:14] they're trying to find their position
[36:16] and no one's there to do it because the
[36:18] parents aren't even in the position we
[36:20] let them have their phones and we let
[36:22] them have all these things and we start
[36:23] to wonder why is this happening because
[36:25] they've seen it it's 24 7 garbage
[36:29] compared to your 10 minutes time with
[36:31] them because you're out of position
[36:32] because well you know the second leading
[36:35] cause of suicide if I say anything kind
[36:37] of off what happens no we have to stay
[36:40] where God puts us to be that's what we
[36:43] have to do
[36:44] we have to stay where God showed us to
[36:46] be and as parents we get out of position
[36:48] that's why everything else is out of
[36:50] position we let that guard down and you
[36:53] let that guard down for a second the
[36:55] devil's right there he's right there and
[36:57] that's the problem is we've let that
[36:59] shield down we're in the fight of our
[37:01] lives and we don't even know where we're
[37:02] at we're just coasting along I'm just
[37:04] trying to stay afloat I'm just trying to
[37:07] keep going that's all I'm trying to do
[37:08] that's where I'm at that's not always a
[37:10] bad thing but when the person next to
[37:12] you is on a position then we're in
[37:14] trouble we have to stay all together
[37:17] with our Shields my shield has to be on
[37:19] Gideon's head the next guy has to be on
[37:21] my head if I can't hold it and there's
[37:23] somebody in the middle that needs help
[37:24] they're in really big trouble because
[37:26] I'm not in my position because I've
[37:28] gotten out of where God put me to be
[37:29] because I wanted to be somewhere else
[37:31] because I wanted to do it this way I
[37:33] didn't want to listen it doesn't make
[37:35] sense to do it that way God has a plan
[37:37] God knows what he's supposed to do
[37:40] so
[37:41] if we go to Joshua 1 13
[37:44] through 15.
[37:49] Joshua 1 13-15
[37:58] this is where we're at
[38:02] and we might not realize it
[38:04] we don't know our positions and we get
[38:07] out of position we're in really big
[38:09] trouble
[38:10] so it says remember the word which Moses
[38:13] the servant of God commanded you saying
[38:15] the Lord your God hath given you rest
[38:17] and hath given you this land your wives
[38:20] your little ones and your cattle shall
[38:21] remain in the land which Moses gave you
[38:23] on this side Jordan but ye shall pass
[38:26] before your brethren armed all the
[38:28] Mighty Men of Valor and help them until
[38:31] the Lord had given your brother and rest
[38:33] as he had given you and you also have
[38:36] possessed the land which the Lord God
[38:37] your the Lord your God has given thee
[38:40] when ye shall return onto the land of
[38:42] your possession and enjoy it which Moses
[38:45] the Lord's servant gave you on this side
[38:47] Jordan toward the sunrise
[38:49] so we need a rest
[38:51] people need a rest but we're out of
[38:53] position
[38:54] we can't hold on because we're looking
[38:56] around getting distracted and our
[38:59] brother in need of rest but we got to
[39:01] have the rest first but we've gotten out
[39:03] of that position we haven't gotten
[39:04] anchored into God and we're getting off
[39:06] on all sorts of crazy stuff because it's
[39:08] so much easier to get on that stuff it's
[39:10] so much easier to say well I'm the most
[39:12] revelated I know all of these things I
[39:15] figured out the secrets of life no you
[39:18] haven't you haven't figured out anything
[39:20] that's the problem is we like to exalt
[39:23] ourselves we like to become Pharisees
[39:24] and we've got all this stuff narrowed
[39:26] down so all you got to do is this this
[39:28] and this and this and this no we don't
[39:30] know what that looks like we don't know
[39:32] what people's walks look like
[39:34] and it's time for arrest our Brethren
[39:37] need the rest just like the Lord has
[39:39] given us but if we don't know that we
[39:42] need the rest then we're in really big
[39:44] trouble we can't get in our position
[39:46] we can't get where we're supposed to be
[39:48] holding our shield and when the Devil
[39:50] Comes we don't know to just keep walking
[39:52] forward with god with that Shield we've
[39:54] got to keep walking forward with God
[39:55] we've got to keep holding that Shield up
[39:57] and keep protecting our burn and
[39:59] protecting ourselves and protecting our
[40:01] kids we're not doing anything to change
[40:03] this and when the Devil comes and starts
[40:06] smacking on that shield and you hear it
[40:08] just boom boom keep holding the shield
[40:11] God's coming Jesus is coming Keep
[40:13] Holding On The Shield but we don't like
[40:15] to do that we get distracted don't get
[40:17] distracted as the world keeps coming
[40:19] with lgbtq as the world keeps coming
[40:21] with a transgender hold on to the shield
[40:24] as you keep saying you're not going to
[40:26] make it hold on to the shield as he
[40:28] keeps saying you ain't got enough hold
[40:30] on to the shield as he keeps saying
[40:32] you're never going to be good enough
[40:34] you're never going to be able to hold it
[40:35] long enough
[40:36] keep holding on the shield stand there
[40:38] The Shield will hold Jesus is coming
[40:41] he's coming keep holding on that Shield
[40:43] because everyone else around you Deeds
[40:45] you to be in that position whatever that
[40:47] position looks like and we like to think
[40:49] it looks at these major these huge
[40:51] positions we like the way those things
[40:52] look
[40:54] but it doesn't look that way it looks
[40:56] like prayer it looks like you praying
[40:58] all the time for your family it looks
[41:01] like you're doing whatever you can to
[41:03] show them more love I'm not talking
[41:04] about justifying sin I'm talking about
[41:06] loving them they need your help they
[41:09] need to see what it looks like but when
[41:11] you don't do it and then we look around
[41:13] why is this happening because you're
[41:15] doing it because they don't know what
[41:18] it's supposed to look like we have no
[41:20] idea because we've gotten out of our
[41:22] position we've got to hold on to that
[41:24] Shield everyone else in the family is
[41:26] depending on it if we move a half an
[41:28] inch that devil will get through that
[41:30] Shield we can't move we have to hold
[41:32] fast
[41:33] we have to stay where we're supposed to
[41:35] be with the Lord we have to stay in that
[41:37] position no matter what it looks like if
[41:39] it looks like the guy that sweeps the
[41:41] floor stay in that position hold that
[41:43] Shield you're the same guy that's the
[41:45] guy's holding a shield over you it's the
[41:47] same thing we're in the same fight and
[41:49] we're in the fight of our lives and we
[41:51] don't even realize it a lot of times we
[41:53] don't even know what's going on we want
[41:55] to stay just completely secluded to it
[41:57] but they keep pushing these agendas and
[42:00] keep pushing these agendas and some of
[42:02] these things that started in the 50s
[42:03] some of these things have started way
[42:06] way before all of this stuff it's been
[42:08] going on for a very long time and now
[42:09] it's just starting to manifest itself
[42:12] because we haven't paid attention we
[42:14] haven't stayed in our position we
[42:16] haven't done what we're supposed to be
[42:17] doing we've gotten off on doing all of
[42:20] these different things and we haven't
[42:21] gotten into the love of God and made
[42:23] sure that our children are anchored in
[42:25] the love of God do you know that you
[42:28] know that Jesus is real to you how do
[42:31] you know that what is your experience
[42:32] what experience have you had my
[42:35] experience looks totally different than
[42:36] everyone else's like I said every time
[42:38] we've come to the lord it's totally
[42:40] different if you have to build Dan his
[42:41] testimony it's different than my
[42:42] testimony the Lord brings everybody in a
[42:45] different way but the point is
[42:47] we all have the anchor in Christ
[42:50] we have to have that anchor in Christ
[42:52] nothing else matters if we're not sure
[42:55] that we're anchored in God and that's
[42:57] the problem is we've gotten distracted
[42:59] everything is a distraction have you
[43:01] looked into what phones do to you phones
[43:04] will permanently alter your brain when
[43:07] we get stuck in that farm and these kids
[43:09] have seen all the things that they
[43:11] shouldn't see you're crazy if you think
[43:13] to Heaven these they can get onto all
[43:14] these things with our phone and then
[43:16] we're doing nothing to counteract that
[43:18] whatsoever we put the shield completely
[43:20] down and we're not doing anything and
[43:22] we're wondering why is everything going
[43:24] crazy because we haven't done anything
[43:26] because we're out of position we've got
[43:28] to stay in the position God wants us in
[43:30] and we can't move until he tells us to
[43:33] move we have to move forward if we move
[43:34] it forward as a unit and keep going with
[43:36] the Lord not getting stuck on things not
[43:39] getting distracted by things keep
[43:40] walking forward with the Lord no matter
[43:42] what that looks like keep pushing
[43:44] forward with the Lord keep holding that
[43:45] shield no matter what comes keep pushing
[43:47] forward but we like to just stay right
[43:49] where we're at and we've got to figure
[43:51] things out keep walking
[43:53] stop throwing everything out because
[43:55] something didn't line up quite right and
[43:57] keep walking in the middle of the road
[43:58] with the Lord
[44:00] so in closing if the musicians want to
[44:02] come
[44:04] we keep
[44:05] we need to pray more
[44:07] we need to get in our position more
[44:10] it's time to fight
[44:12] it's the fight of our lives and we might
[44:14] not even realize how bad it is
[44:17] it's bad
[44:19] we need to make sure that we're Anchored
[44:21] In God ourselves before we can start
[44:23] going out and showing everyone else what
[44:26] their problem is when you don't even
[44:28] actually know what your problem is we're
[44:30] supposed to spread the Gospel of Jesus
[44:32] we're not supposed to spread everything
[44:34] we think that it should be we're
[44:36] supposed to spread the love of God if we
[44:39] don't have the love of Jesus then he
[44:41] will not manifest himself he does the
[44:43] work we don't do the work but we get off
[44:46] thinking that we're going to do it we're
[44:48] just going to help out a little bit it
[44:50] doesn't work that way that's not how it
[44:52] goes we can show them the love of God we
[44:55] can live it we can show them in the
[44:57] Bible we can tell them our testimonies
[44:59] but when it comes to getting that real
[45:01] experience you're not going to do it you
[45:03] can never do it and we have to be okay
[45:05] with that that's the hardest part about
[45:07] this is we'd like to just well if we can
[45:10] just do more if I can just kind of you
[45:12] know get him to church and get them to
[45:13] church I'll pay for your gas I'll do all
[45:15] these things it's not wrong but when
[45:16] they don't do that God's going to do the
[45:18] work and he's going to how he sees fit
[45:21] to do it
[45:22] and if it means that they're not going
[45:24] to show up to church for a couple months
[45:25] then they're not going to show up to
[45:26] church for a couple months they've got
[45:27] to do it you cannot do it you can sit
[45:30] them in that Pew and give them their
[45:32] times money to pay and make sure
[45:33] everything is dressed up perfectly and
[45:36] it still won't work you can do all of
[45:38] those things and if God doesn't manifest
[45:40] it doesn't work it doesn't go that way
[45:43] we had to let God do it let off the
[45:46] controls and stand in our position with
[45:49] our brother and sister and stay we keep
[45:52] wanting to move around we move forward
[45:54] but we can't move off to the side or
[45:55] anything like that when that unit is all
[45:57] together like that the problem is it's
[45:59] slow and it's not very maneuverable but
[46:01] it will keep moving forward and it will
[46:04] keep protecting all the people inside of
[46:06] it and they'll keep moving they're going
[46:08] to get there the Lord is going to get
[46:10] there and the Lord is going to come
[46:12] around you with those Shields he's going
[46:13] to get there we have to stay in our
[46:15] positions and keep fighting the fight
[46:18] and not get distracted
[46:20] we love to be distracted
[46:23] stay in your positions love more pray
[46:26] for them
[46:27] pray for them with everything you have
[46:29] the best thing to do is pray we like to
[46:31] say the only thing we can do is pray no
[46:33] the best thing to do is pray
[46:34] that's what you have to do
[46:36] we can pray that's what it looks like we
[46:38] want to look like we draw the sword and
[46:40] we're just going to go start cutting
[46:41] things apart we can't do that if you
[46:44] show up to a fight with a devil and you
[46:45] don't know what you're doing you'll lose
[46:47] because you realize you didn't realize
[46:49] that it's not you fighting it's God
[46:51] fighting God is holding your harm up God
[46:54] is holding your Shield up he's the one
[46:56] doing the work you just have to keep
[46:58] listening to him and stay in your
[46:59] position
[47:00] so let's pray
[47:04] Lord we just thank you Lord Lord we
[47:06] thank you for this time together Lord
[47:08] we just pray that you help us to stay
[47:10] Lord where we're supposed to be Lord
[47:12] Lord help us sustain that position Lord
[47:15] whatever that looks like Lord I pray
[47:17] Lord that
[47:18] you just help us to understand
[47:20] what you have us Lord where you have us
[47:22] Lord Lord and that we can't look around
[47:24] Lord we just stay focused on you Lord
[47:27] give us that tunnel vision Lord stay
[47:29] where we're supposed to stay with you
[47:31] Lord Jesus
[47:32] Lord I pray that we try to stop fixing
[47:34] things Lord and we just understand that
[47:36] Jesus fixes it
[47:38] Lord no matter what it is you're the one
[47:40] that handles it not us
[47:42] Lord we thank you for these things Lord
[47:44] make yourself more real to us every day
[47:46] Lord Jesus in Jesus name we pray amen
[47:49] amen
[47:52] amen
