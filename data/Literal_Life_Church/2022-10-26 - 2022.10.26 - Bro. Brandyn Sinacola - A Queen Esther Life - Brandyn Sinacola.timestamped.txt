[0:00] chapter 2 and verse 1
[0:03] and I'm going to read through verse 20.
[0:09] after these things when the wrath of
[0:11] King athazarus was appeased he
[0:13] remembered vashti and what she had done
[0:15] and what was decreed against her
[0:18] then said the king's servants that
[0:20] ministered unto him let there be fair
[0:22] young virgins sought for the king
[0:25] and let the king appoint officers in all
[0:28] the provinces of his kingdom that they
[0:30] may gather together all the fair young
[0:32] virgins into shushan the palace to the
[0:34] house of the women and to the custody of
[0:36] hagai the king's Chamberlain Keeper of
[0:39] the women and let their things for
[0:41] purification be given them and let the
[0:43] maiden which pleaseth the king be Queen
[0:46] instead of vashti and the thing please
[0:48] the king and he did so
[0:50] now when shushan the palace there was a
[0:53] certain Jew whose name was Mordecai the
[0:55] son of
[0:56] the son of jair the son of shimmyi the
[0:59] son of Kish a benjamite who had been
[1:02] carried away from Jerusalem and the
[1:04] Captivity which had been carried away
[1:06] from with
[1:08] jeconiah king of Judah whom
[1:11] Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had
[1:13] carried away
[1:15] and he brought up Hadassah that is
[1:16] Esther his uncle's daughter for she had
[1:19] neither father nor mother and the maid
[1:21] was fair and beautiful whom Mordecai
[1:24] when her father and mother were dead
[1:25] took for his own daughter
[1:28] you can have your seats and we'll
[1:29] continue reading
[1:33] I just want to comment real quick before
[1:35] we continue on that um
[1:37] the the setting of The Story here we
[1:40] know the the story of Queen Esther and
[1:42] we know that it was in the medes and
[1:44] Persian Empire and
[1:46] um we said last time that this this
[1:49] particular King Xerxes or ahazarus
[1:52] he was one of the most uh had one of the
[1:56] most lavish kingdoms out of the Persian
[1:58] Empire his his Reign was one of the most
[2:02] renowned in the Persian Reign and so we
[2:06] see this setting for going into Esther
[2:08] and then I just thought it was
[2:09] interesting it's it's just I can't wrap
[2:11] my mind around the timing of it because
[2:13] it just it crisscrosses so much
[2:16] um probably uh you know somebody like
[2:19] brother Rapp could could really tie it
[2:22] out for us but
[2:24] um
[2:24] I'm just not that smart but you have uh
[2:28] Ezra and then I believe it was Ezra
[2:31] Esther and then Nehemiah if or vice
[2:34] versa but Queen Esther they they kind of
[2:37] their time frames kind of run together
[2:39] and we can see that in verse six uh when
[2:42] there's talking about Mordecai the
[2:44] scripture says who had been carried away
[2:45] from Jerusalem with the Captivity
[2:48] so under King Nebuchadnezzar and it
[2:51] switched we know that that was uh
[2:53] prophecy
[2:54] um Jeremiah prophesied of King Cyrus I
[2:57] believe if I've got my Kings right and
[3:00] um he he came and they they demolished
[3:03] the temple and took the Jews captive and
[3:06] that's the setting that we find when
[3:08] Esther is first mentioned here
[3:12] so you know it's it's a it's a time of
[3:15] of of great uh Darkness for the Jews in
[3:18] one sense and yet because it was such an
[3:21] illustrious
[3:22] um it was such an illustrious uh Empire
[3:26] that the Jews actually
[3:29] um I I liken that to our day as I was
[3:32] reading it because
[3:34] it was a lot of soft living for the Jews
[3:37] it was hard they were taken captive
[3:38] that's true but yet they God gave them
[3:42] favor under the Persian Empire to
[3:44] rebuild the Temple to rebuild the wall
[3:47] um they they were actually held it kind
[3:49] of went back and forth as you as you
[3:51] read Ezra and Nebuchadnezzar the the
[3:53] different Kings and then people would
[3:55] rise up and they'd write a letter to the
[3:56] king and they'd say hey these Jews are
[3:58] bad people and the king would say down
[4:00] with the bad people and then somebody
[4:02] else would you know
[4:04] rise up and he'd say oh these are good
[4:06] people and then somebody else would
[4:08] write in and say hey those are bad
[4:09] people and then so it just just kind of
[4:11] went like this back and forth but from
[4:14] as far as I can tell now I don't know
[4:16] exactly why Mordecai tells Esther when
[4:19] she gets when she gets taken here we're
[4:21] going to read in a minute and he says
[4:23] don't tell him you're a Jew
[4:25] now to the best of my knowledge there
[4:27] had to be some hatred to the Jews for
[4:29] him to say hey protect yourself don't
[4:31] tell him you're Jewish so to me there's
[4:34] there's some form of persecution here
[4:36] and yet when you read history in
[4:38] different things around this time frame
[4:40] it's the Jews had had a had an easy
[4:43] lifestyle that in one sense they were
[4:46] they were benefiting I should say by the
[4:48] the lavishness of this Empire
[4:51] so it it really kind of you could you
[4:54] could say it became almost a laodicea
[4:56] you know it was it was a lukewarm and
[4:58] yet they're living among Heathen people
[5:00] so you have God-fearing people living
[5:02] among Heathen people with a lavish
[5:04] lifestyle and it gets really easy to let
[5:08] down the guard and and let go of the
[5:11] standards that the Jews held so dear but
[5:15] Mordecai here is is one that held strong
[5:18] and and raised Hadassah because he said
[5:21] he brought up Hadassah that is Esther
[5:23] his uncle's daughter because her parents
[5:26] passed away and so Mordecai raised her
[5:28] in the fear of the Lord
[5:30] so verse 8 says so it came to pass when
[5:33] the King's Command and his decree Was
[5:35] Heard and when many maidens were
[5:37] gathered together into shushan the
[5:39] palace to the custody of hagai that
[5:41] Esther was brought also into the King's
[5:43] house to the custody of Hagi I Keeper of
[5:45] the women now
[5:47] I was I was I can't even remember what
[5:50] we were talking about but I was telling
[5:51] a couple Brothers a little joke that I
[5:53] had heard about uh you know the the uh
[5:57] ever since I gave my Italian voice over
[5:59] the pulpit I've I've gotten a lot of
[6:02] comp uh compliments but comments about
[6:05] about Italians so
[6:08] um just telling this joke about they
[6:10] said you know back in 9 11 if they would
[6:12] have sent the mafia after Bin Laden it
[6:14] would have been over in 24 hours and uh
[6:17] so I just imagined as I was going
[6:19] through this and thinking of Esther and
[6:21] I was thinking you know this this wasn't
[6:23] you know some Italian Persian walking up
[6:26] and knocking on the door and and you
[6:29] know bonjourno would you like to come to
[6:31] the king's palace with me I I don't
[6:33] think it was like that I think it was
[6:35] more like you know this this comedian
[6:37] said that the Italians the mafia walked
[6:40] up and they kick in the door and
[6:42] and you know hey
[6:44] how you doing
[6:46] we're going to the king's Palace you
[6:48] know she didn't they didn't give her a
[6:49] choice there was there was nothing she
[6:51] was taking captive she was taken by
[6:53] force and you can imagine now from what
[6:56] I can tell Esther wasn't in her in her
[6:58] 20s she was probably from I I remember
[7:00] I've I've tried reading a lot trying to
[7:02] grasp it all and I think at one point I
[7:05] heard she was maybe around 17 and so you
[7:08] can imagine she doesn't have Mom she
[7:10] doesn't have Dad she's just got her
[7:12] uncle
[7:13] um
[7:14] and uh am I okay moving tonight back on
[7:17] the camera or do you need me to stand
[7:19] still okay
[7:20] I think we're I don't we might be a
[7:22] little short-handed but
[7:24] um
[7:25] so she's under the care of her uncle and
[7:28] I imagine being taken from him in such a
[7:31] manner probably at night who knows
[7:33] probably with rough rough soldiers they
[7:36] didn't treat her nicely they didn't they
[7:38] didn't treat her well
[7:40] um you know they just they they come in
[7:41] they grab the fair versions and they
[7:43] take them to the palace and I can
[7:44] imagine that Esther is is extremely
[7:47] afraid
[7:48] she's she's she's deathly fearful not
[7:51] knowing exactly what's going to happen
[7:52] what's it what's it mean to be to be uh
[7:57] up for the running of of Queen and then
[7:59] and then far as I know once these women
[8:02] were taken they weren't going back to
[8:04] their families they were staying in the
[8:06] palace as part of the uh the king's
[8:09] Harem uh they they weren't going home
[8:12] and so I imagine that the fear and and
[8:14] the screams and the crying and the tears
[8:17] and and to make matters worse it says
[8:20] I mean it was a it was there was
[8:22] blessings in it but you imagine even
[8:24] with this she's still scared Esther was
[8:26] brought into the King's house to the
[8:27] custody of Hagee eye Keeper of the women
[8:29] and the Maiden pleased him and she
[8:31] obtained kindness of him and he speedily
[8:33] gave her things for purification with
[8:36] such things as belong to her and seven
[8:38] maidens which me uh were meat to be
[8:41] given her out of the King's house and he
[8:43] and he preferred her and her maidens
[8:45] unto the best place of the House of the
[8:47] women so there's a blessing in here but
[8:50] let's let's keep reading Esther had not
[8:52] showed her people for her Kindred uh for
[8:55] Mordecai had charged her that she should
[8:57] not show it and Mordecai walked every
[8:59] day before the court of the women's
[9:01] house to know how Esther did and what
[9:04] should become of her you see there's a
[9:06] question what's going to happen to
[9:07] Esther there's this even though she was
[9:09] given favor there's this question
[9:11] looming over her head of what's going to
[9:13] happen what's going to be the next step
[9:15] where is she gonna end up what if she
[9:17] gets known that she's a Jew I don't know
[9:19] maybe she would have died then I'm not
[9:20] sure maybe she would have went to
[9:22] slavery
[9:23] uh
[9:24] now when every maid's turn was come to
[9:27] go to the King ahazarus after that she
[9:31] had been 12 months
[9:33] 12 months according to the manner of the
[9:35] women for so were the days of their
[9:37] purification accomplished to wit six
[9:39] months with oil and myrrh and six months
[9:41] with sweet odors and with other things
[9:43] for the purifying of the women and and I
[9:47] and
[9:48] I imagine that you know some of some of
[9:50] the wives are thinking well man I would
[9:52] love a 12-month Spa
[9:55] but you can imagine not knowing what's
[9:57] going to happen after this for 12 months
[9:59] this is this is a year-long trial of
[10:01] questions
[10:02] this is this is a year-long uh uh of of
[10:06] just something looming over Esther every
[10:09] day waking up and and although you had
[10:12] the ex the extravagance and the nice
[10:14] treatment and and the the the the the
[10:17] American living around us
[10:20] um the lifestyle that we live today
[10:22] there's always this question over her
[10:23] head of what's going to happen next
[10:26] so you can imagine that this trial it
[10:29] wasn't a day it wasn't it wasn't a bad
[10:32] day it wasn't a bad week
[10:34] this was 12 months this was a whole year
[10:38] now
[10:42] then thus came every Maiden unto the
[10:44] king whatsoever she she desired was
[10:47] given her to go with her out of the
[10:49] house of the women under the King's
[10:50] house
[10:51] in the evening she went and on the
[10:53] morrow she returned into the second
[10:55] house of the women to the custody of
[10:57] shashgas the king's Chamberlain which
[11:00] kept the concubines she came in unto the
[11:02] king no more except the king delighted
[11:04] in her and that she were called by name
[11:06] this is a lifelong thing
[11:09] now when the turn of Esther the daughter
[11:11] of uh daughter of abahale the uncle of
[11:14] Mordecai who had taken her first
[11:17] daughter was come to go in unto the king
[11:19] she required nothing but what Hagia the
[11:22] king's Chamberlain The Keeper of the
[11:23] women appointed and Esther obtained
[11:26] favor in the sight of all them that
[11:27] looked upon her
[11:29] so Esther was taken unto King azarus
[11:32] into his house Royal on the tenth month
[11:34] which is the month to Beth in the
[11:36] seventh year of his Reign and the King
[11:39] loved Esther above all the women and she
[11:41] obtained grace and favor in her sight
[11:43] more than all the virgins so that he set
[11:46] the Royal Crown upon her head and made
[11:48] her Queen instead of vashti then the
[11:50] king made a great feast unto all his
[11:52] princes and his servants even Esther's
[11:55] feast and he made a release to the
[11:57] provinces and gave gifts according to
[11:59] the state of the king and when the
[12:01] virgins were gathered together the
[12:02] second time
[12:04] then Mordecai sat in the king's gate
[12:06] Esther had not yet showed her Kindred
[12:08] nor her people as Mordecai had charged
[12:10] her for Esther did the Commandment of
[12:12] Mordecai like as when she was brought up
[12:15] with him
[12:16] so I just wanna and for them in the back
[12:19] I'm just going to title this tonight
[12:21] Queen Esther and I just want to I maybe
[12:24] give an introduction last time we spoke
[12:26] on on Queen vashti and and kind of what
[12:29] a queen shouldn't be and tonight by the
[12:32] help and grace of God I'd like to talk a
[12:33] little bit about what a queen should be
[12:38] and I've been trying to catch up on the
[12:42] the services from the men's meeting and
[12:44] and there was one particular that I
[12:45] listened to this week for the brothers
[12:47] who went and and maybe who have gone
[12:49] back and listened it was brother Jack
[12:51] Duff and um he spoke on uh choosing of a
[12:54] bride and it was just I I just took a
[12:57] lot of things from that that was so good
[12:59] um so I'm gonna repeat a lot from it
[13:02] um and just fit it in with the story of
[13:04] Esther because I just he was speaking to
[13:07] Men I'm going to speak tonight to women
[13:08] and and I just pray that God will bring
[13:11] it spiritually to us as well
[13:14] so Esther we find she was she was fair
[13:16] she obtained favor with everybody that
[13:18] she went to right is what the scripture
[13:21] said she was beautiful she was fair she
[13:24] was beautiful and and she just she had
[13:27] that pure virtuous Spirit about her that
[13:30] that that a man would desire
[13:33] that and this King was attracted to a
[13:35] heathen King a Persian king and and yet
[13:38] he was attracted to Esther to it to a
[13:41] Jew even though he didn't know it was
[13:42] her now
[13:43] she was she was uh the last time I just
[13:46] kind of typed it this way
[13:49] um Esther
[13:52] and she was a type of a beautiful branch
[13:54] predestinated and elected to be Christ
[13:58] Queen chosen for her character and
[14:02] that's the type that we see there now
[14:03] the story of Esther's interesting I know
[14:05] I'm bouncing around a lot but I'm just
[14:07] trying to lay into uh Queen Esther here
[14:11] Esther's there's there's a lot of
[14:13] speculation there's a lot of criticism
[14:15] of the Bible there's a lot of back and
[14:18] forth between secular and Christians
[14:21] because
[14:22] God is not mentioned one time in the
[14:25] story of Esther
[14:27] when you read Esther God is not
[14:28] mentioned one time
[14:30] it's not even necessarily I it fits in
[14:33] with the history of Ezra and Nehemiah
[14:36] but
[14:37] there's really nothing
[14:40] um it gives a little bit of History just
[14:42] a brief spot in the Jews where they were
[14:44] going to be annihilated but there's just
[14:48] not much to it in the way of applying uh
[14:51] according to many even Christians
[14:54] applying it to the Christian walk but
[14:56] yet we see all these types and shadows
[14:58] in it and we can see Christ and his
[15:01] bride throughout it and so I thank God
[15:03] for Revelation like this but if we go to
[15:06] Isaiah 4 and verse 1
[15:09] . and and when I looked at this I saw
[15:12] Queen vashti and Queen Esther
[15:14] and it says in the day seven women shall
[15:17] take hold of one man saying we will eat
[15:20] our own bread and wear our own apparel
[15:23] only let us be called by the name thy
[15:26] name to take away our reproach
[15:29] and
[15:31] I just I highlighted these women saying
[15:34] and we want to wear our own apparel
[15:37] because nowadays not just talking about
[15:40] you know Christian modesty but just
[15:43] talking about the women of this world is
[15:45] they're going to wear what they want to
[15:46] wear you're not allowed to say anything
[15:48] anymore if they want to walk out of the
[15:50] house naked you dare not say anything
[15:53] that's the that's the age we live in and
[15:55] yet they want to be called Christians to
[15:57] take away their reproach
[16:00] verse 2 in that day shall the branch of
[16:02] the Lord be beautiful and glorious
[16:04] that's you sisters that's every
[16:08] Christian filled with the Holy Spirit a
[16:10] beautiful Branch but I I just want to
[16:13] lash on to that you sisters tonight it's
[16:16] a beautiful Branch you're glorious and
[16:18] the fruit of the Earth shall be
[16:19] excellent and comely for them that are
[16:21] escaped of Israel and it shall come to
[16:24] pass that he that is left in Zion and he
[16:26] that remaineth in Jerusalem Shall be
[16:27] Called holy
[16:29] foreign
[16:30] these women are Are Holy unto the Lord
[16:33] they're holy the way the way they dress
[16:36] they're presented as a beautiful Branch
[16:38] they're they're holy in the sight of the
[16:40] Lord the way you sisters dress the way
[16:42] you conduct yourselves
[16:44] um
[16:46] let's see
[16:49] even everyone that is written among the
[16:51] living in Jerusalem when the Lord shall
[16:54] have washed away the filth of the
[16:55] daughters of Zion I just I see the day
[16:58] we're living in through and through in
[17:00] and out of these verses the the filth of
[17:03] the daughters around us and yet God
[17:05] comes and he takes you sisters and he
[17:07] washes you with his Spirit he washes you
[17:10] in the water of his word Esther Esther
[17:13] was was given to to I'm going to say the
[17:16] prophet haggai to to to dress her to get
[17:19] her ready to go before the king and you
[17:22] sisters we had a Prophet come today and
[17:24] he gave you how to dress he gave you how
[17:25] to wear your hair he he he brought light
[17:28] and he shed light to bring you dignity
[17:30] and to bring you glory and so that you
[17:32] are holy before the Lord
[17:34] and he washed away the filth of the
[17:37] daughters we have filth around us we
[17:39] have we have women who who are just
[17:41] filthy the way they act the way they
[17:44] talk the way they they they smoke and
[17:47] they drink and it's and it's just filthy
[17:49] before the Lord and it's it's it's it's
[17:51] it's filthy to to a holy ghost
[17:54] god-filled brother
[17:57] and shall have purged the blood of
[17:59] Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the
[18:01] spirit of judgment and by the spirit of
[18:03] burning and the Lord will create upon
[18:06] every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and
[18:08] upon her assemblies a cloud in Smoke by
[18:11] day and The Shining of a flame Fire by
[18:14] night for upon all the glory shall be a
[18:17] defense
[18:18] the word Esther means star
[18:21] it's a star shining it's it's a star is
[18:24] bright and and it's beautiful in the
[18:27] darkness of the night sky so in this
[18:29] time when when Isaiah is laying this out
[18:32] by prophecy and and it's a dark time
[18:34] it's a filthy time and yet there's a
[18:36] woman who's going to shine bright in the
[18:38] Darkness
[18:40] there's there's a there's a a a a god
[18:43] called sisters who who are going to
[18:45] shine bright there's a there's a bride
[18:47] of Jesus Christ who's going to shine
[18:49] bright and the darker it is the darker
[18:52] it gets around us the darker it gets
[18:54] around you sisters the brighter You're
[18:56] Gonna Shine that you you say well I
[18:58] don't I don't want to stand out well I
[19:00] got news for you you're going to stand
[19:01] out naturally just by holding God's
[19:03] standard you're going to stand out more
[19:05] than the brothers

[19:19] look upon you and they say there's
[19:20] something beautiful about that I want
[19:23] somebody like that
[19:26] amen
[19:30] it takes Darkness for the stars to shine
[19:33] and the darker the night the brighter
[19:35] they shine you go out into the country
[19:38] and you get away from from all the the
[19:40] the the the the the the
[19:42] filth the the pollution the the the the
[19:46] the smog the light pollution they call
[19:48] it you get out into the country you go
[19:50] out into the desert sometime you go out
[19:52] into the woods and when you look up
[19:53] there's no light around and those those
[19:56] stars shine as bright as you've ever
[19:58] seen them you see more stars you see
[20:01] stars that are that are further away and
[20:03] that are closer to you and and you see
[20:05] you see all kinds of things you see
[20:07] shooting stars you see you see stars
[20:10] that normally listen now stars that
[20:13] normally you wouldn't see stars that
[20:15] normally don't appear to be shining as
[20:17] it gets darker they shine
[20:21] no matter how dim they shine and there
[20:24] shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in
[20:25] the daytime for the Heat and for a place
[20:28] of refuge and for a cover from storm and
[20:31] from rain now we know that that God is
[20:34] our is our covering God as our
[20:36] Tabernacle it we know that God speaks of
[20:39] a light and a smoke by day we know that
[20:41] that's the that's a pillar of fire but
[20:43] but I'm seeing the women of the Lord I'm
[20:45] seeing the queen Esters of today
[20:48] I'm seeing that a Godly wife is like a
[20:51] tabernacle for a man for a shadow in the
[20:54] daytime from the Heat and for a place of
[20:56] refuge and for a covert from storming
[20:58] from rain and I know you think that that
[21:00] might be I I I you might think go ahead
[21:04] and think that I'm lifting the sisters
[21:06] up because I am I'm lifting the women up
[21:08] I'm lifting you sisters up because you
[21:11] are when when your husband comes in from
[21:13] from the world you're a tabernacle
[21:15] you're you're a covering for him you're
[21:18] a you're a peace within the storm you
[21:21] you can you can listen now we know it's
[21:24] God but it's God in you and it's and
[21:26] it's because you're holy it's because
[21:28] you're righteous it's because you're a
[21:29] woman of the Lord that you take away the
[21:32] cares of the world from the man that you
[21:33] you take the stress off of his shoulders
[21:35] that you you you hide him from the storm
[21:38] when he's had a bad day when he's having
[21:40] a bad week when he knows he has to go
[21:42] back into it tomorrow you're you're uh
[21:44] you're a covering your your uh you're a
[21:47] rain in the heat you're a you're a drink
[21:49] of fresh water
[21:56] Esther was a type of that beautiful
[21:58] branch
[21:59] and she was predestinated and elected
[22:03] for that day
[22:05] I don't want to get into it too much
[22:06] because I'm I'm holding this one but
[22:09] she was predestinated
[22:12] for for such a time as this
[22:14] you sisters have been predestinated
[22:17] you were held back through through six
[22:20] thousand years
[22:22] for this day
[22:24] you were held for this day because God
[22:27] had to have the the stars that would
[22:30] Shine the brightest safe for this day
[22:32] think of the value brothers that you
[22:34] should have for these sisters that God
[22:37] saved them for a day that's going to be
[22:39] darker than any other
[22:41] God saved these sisters there's women
[22:44] throughout the ages we look at Esther
[22:46] and we Marvel at her we Marvel at her
[22:48] grace we Marvel at her beauty we we we
[22:51] we we can talk about the women of the
[22:53] Bible but you sisters are writing a new
[22:56] a new chapter you're found in the pages
[22:58] of the Bible and yet you're writing a
[23:00] new chapter because those women back in
[23:03] those days that we looked to and we
[23:05] admire and and we and we lift up they
[23:08] don't they they they they only shine so
[23:11] bright you shine so much brighter
[23:13] because of the day you live in
[23:16] are you with me tonight
[23:20] now this is where I start picking up
[23:22] some of what brother Jack was bringing
[23:23] and like I said he was speaking to the
[23:25] men and I just thought man you could
[23:26] speak this to the women just as much
[23:28] here so I'm giving you sisters a glimpse
[23:31] into the men's meeting
[23:34] Proverbs 18 22. listen watch your
[23:38] position sisters
[23:41] he who finds a wife finds a good thing
[23:45] he that finds a wife finds a good thing
[23:48] and obtains favor from the Lord this is
[23:51] your position
[23:53] this is the position that God has placed
[23:55] you in is that when a man finds you
[23:58] and he's blessed to call you his wife he
[24:02] finds a good thing and he obtains favor
[24:05] with the Lord
[24:09] first Peter 3 this is this is
[24:12] I hope you're catching it tonight
[24:14] especially you sisters I want you to see
[24:16] yourself in the scripture I want you to
[24:18] see what God thinks of you I want you to
[24:20] feel the dignity that God has spoken
[24:22] over you first Peter 3 in the Amplified
[24:25] says in the same way you wives be
[24:27] submissive to your own husbands
[24:29] subordinate not as inferior but out of
[24:32] respect for the responsibilities
[24:34] entrusted to your husbands
[24:36] you Sisters You bear a great weight
[24:39] you bear a a a heavyweight
[24:42] like I said the way you the way you
[24:45] dress what's what's been asked of you of
[24:47] God
[24:48] notice I said what's been asked of you
[24:50] you can make whatever decision you want
[24:51] but what's been asked of you by your
[24:53] Heavenly Father by your by your king
[24:55] Christ Jesus and and yet it says that
[24:59] the husband is has responsibilities
[25:01] that's entrusted to him you're one of
[25:04] those responsibilities
[25:05] your husband is responsible for you so
[25:08] you so when you when you get down on
[25:10] yourself and you think well why do I
[25:12] have to do this why do I have to do that
[25:14] why your husband has a great has
[25:18] I hope this is okay to say but this is
[25:19] the way I see it your husband has a
[25:21] greater responsibility because he's been
[25:24] set charge over you he's been set
[25:26] charged to lead you not as something uh
[25:30] inferior but but subordinate me equal
[25:33] but yet out of respect for the
[25:36] responsibilities entrusted to your
[25:37] husband and their accountability to God
[25:40] your account you're held accountable to
[25:42] your husband but your husband's
[25:44] accountable to God
[25:46] amen
[25:48] and so partnering with them so
[25:51] partnering with them not trying to rule
[25:54] over them not even acting inferior to
[25:57] them
[25:57] but but
[26:00] uh partnering with them you're a partner
[26:04] in this journey you're a partner in this
[26:06] life to your husband you're you're a
[26:08] help that's been meat that's been given
[26:10] meat Esther was given Maids maids and
[26:14] and servants that were meat for that
[26:16] means they were fitting for they were
[26:18] they were there to help her you've been
[26:20] given a help meet to your husband
[26:23] uh so that even if some of them listen
[26:25] now even if a husband does not obey the
[26:28] word of God that they may be won over to
[26:31] Christ without discussion
[26:33] by The Godly lives of their wives sister
[26:36] Don't Preach to your husband
[26:38] you'll just turn him off
[26:41] when a man needs respect and when you
[26:44] preach to him when you're trying to to
[26:46] uh uh
[26:48] um win him over with with words only
[26:52] and and and you come off uh religiously
[26:55] Superior that husband will never touch
[26:57] it with a ten foot pole
[26:59] it says without discussion by Godly
[27:02] lives you have the power to win an
[27:06] unsaved husband
[27:07] now I would recommend that you don't go
[27:10] get an unsaved husband and then try to
[27:13] convert them
[27:14] brother Branham said if he doesn't have
[27:16] the Holy Ghost I don't care if he's
[27:18] sitting in this church I don't care if
[27:20] he's preaching In a Pulpit I don't care
[27:22] who he is if that man does not have the
[27:24] Holy Ghost stay away from him
[27:26] I don't care how handsome he is how how
[27:29] Italian he looks how much he can sing
[27:32] like Dean Martin
[27:37] foreign
[27:38] if you don't have the Holy Ghost brother
[27:41] Branham said he'll make hell for you on
[27:43] Earth and I guarantee you sister he'll
[27:45] make hell for you on Earth
[27:47] don't chance it don't don't take it the
[27:51] NIV says wives in the same way submit
[27:53] yourselves to your own husbands so that
[27:55] if any of them do not believe the word
[27:57] they may be went over without words by
[28:00] the behavior of their wives I know I
[28:03] know sisters
[28:04] who's
[28:05] one one particular and I don't want to
[28:07] call her out over the pulpit but I know
[28:09] one
[28:10] and her husband's an unbeliever
[28:13] and that woman is so faithful
[28:16] and and godly and living that way before
[28:19] her husband and
[28:22] and I and I don't
[28:24] I know she says she prays for him but I
[28:26] don't know how much more she talks about
[28:28] the Lord to him
[28:30] she just lives a Godly life
[28:32] and I'll tell you
[28:34] beautiful branch of the Lord
[28:38] Esther by her character
[28:40] and her influence she influenced one of
[28:43] the most powerful kings in the Persian
[28:45] Empire
[28:48] she so won her husband's love that he
[28:51] offered her half his kingdom
[28:53] imagine the trust that
[28:57] the king of the Empire the greatest
[28:59] Empire at the time
[29:01] had in a woman
[29:03] like Esther
[29:05] to say Esther
[29:07] what's your request
[29:09] I'll give you half of my kingdom
[29:12] could you imagine being offered that
[29:13] listen
[29:14] us husbands here we don't have a very
[29:17] big Kingdom
[29:18] so you got to use your imagination a
[29:20] little bit
[29:21] sorry sis
[29:24] but can you imagine she influenced this
[29:26] King so much
[29:28] and and I want to talk about it more
[29:29] later on she influenced them so much
[29:32] the the she lived such a such a life
[29:36] there was such an air about her there
[29:38] was so much character to her that this
[29:40] man offered her half of his kingdom
[29:44] if he had the Proverbs he would have
[29:46] known Esther he would have labored her
[29:48] he probably would have when he
[29:50] celebrated Esther because he he he
[29:52] crowned Esther and then it says he set
[29:54] out a great feast among everybody he
[29:56] gave gifts he was just so in love with
[29:58] her he was so happy he sent out gifts to
[30:01] to everybody but it says
[30:04] but if if he would have had the Proverbs
[30:06] and known him of that day he would have
[30:08] said Esther is a proverbs 31 Queen
[30:11] and US Brothers you Brothers you should
[30:14] be able to say my wife is a proverbs 31
[30:17] Queen
[30:19] you sisters you should be worthy of the
[30:22] title of proverbs 31 Queen
[30:25] King Xerxes knew Esther wouldn't try to
[30:27] take a kingdom for herself
[30:29] he could offer her half of his kingdom
[30:31] because he knew she wasn't going to
[30:32] abuse it he knew she wasn't going to try
[30:35] to to to take it and and make her own
[30:38] kingdom she would take his kingdom his
[30:41] portion of his kingdom that he offered
[30:43] her she would take that and like a
[30:45] Proverbs 31 Woman she would she would
[30:47] she would make it grow she would
[30:49] flourish it it would probably even do
[30:51] better than what his portion of the
[30:53] Kingdom would do and yet it would all be
[30:56] his it would be theirs Partners as the
[30:58] scripture said it would be partners it
[31:01] would be it wasn't hurt trying to do her
[31:03] own thing and get her own Glory separate
[31:05] from the husband it was something we're
[31:07] a family unit we're we're a family and
[31:10] I'm a reflection of this man and so
[31:12] anything that I do what I say that is
[31:14] going to reflect him and so I want to
[31:16] make it grow I want to make it Prosper I
[31:18] want to bring him glory
[31:21] it would be an extension and a
[31:23] reflection of his Rule and it would have
[31:25] been ruled well are you with me tonight
[31:29] we're doing good on time
[31:32] he knew she would be supportive of what
[31:34] God gave him to do this man didn't know
[31:36] God except through Esther
[31:38] and yet the scripture said that God
[31:40] appoints Kings
[31:42] so whether this man knew God or not God
[31:45] gave him his position so he knew she
[31:47] would be supportive of what he was to do
[31:49] whatever God caused your husband to he
[31:52] calls you two with him
[31:55] if he equips the man now listen I want
[31:57] to I want to encourage you tonight
[31:58] because whatever your husband has been
[32:00] called to do whether it don't matter
[32:02] from from preacher to to from Pastor to
[32:08] evangelist to to missionary to Deacon
[32:12] the trustee to janitor to going to work
[32:16] every day and living a Godly life at
[32:18] your job
[32:19] doesn't matter you don't have to have a
[32:22] position you be the best Christian you
[32:24] can be whatever God's given you to do
[32:27] and and sister whatever God has called
[32:30] that man to do he's called you to do
[32:32] with him so if God equips that man to do
[32:35] a work for the Lord he's going to equip
[32:37] you too
[32:38] so so don't fear whatever it is if he
[32:41] gets up and goes to work every day
[32:42] you'll be equipped to to meet that man's
[32:45] needs to send him to work every day with
[32:47] a lunch
[32:52] just got real quiet you sisters do send
[32:54] your husband to work with a lunch right
[32:58] feed the man it'll win his heart
[33:04] if he's been called to the ministry
[33:06] you've been called with him God will
[33:09] equip that man and God will equip you
[33:11] too
[33:11] whatever this man however this man's
[33:14] been called to serve in the kingdom of
[33:15] God
[33:17] amen
[33:20] Queen asked her to love God more than
[33:23] she loved the king
[33:25] and through that love
[33:27] she could love her husband correctly
[33:30] you sisters should love your love God
[33:33] more than you love your husbands you
[33:35] husbands should love God more than you
[33:36] love your wives because if you live that
[33:39] way
[33:39] you'll love them right you'll love your
[33:42] spouse right you'll love your children
[33:43] right if you're not married it doesn't
[33:46] matter you love God more than you love
[33:48] the people who you go to church with
[33:50] right and you'll love those people right
[33:58] now one of the things that and and I
[34:01] want to make sure I give them all the
[34:03] credit here brother Jack Duff
[34:05] he read through a Proverbs 31 Woman and
[34:09] and broke it down by verse and and I
[34:12] just thought it was beautiful and so
[34:13] some of the things I wanted to say about
[34:15] Esther I just stuck in here and I want
[34:18] to bring it to the to your sisters
[34:21] proverbs 31 10 says just summarizing
[34:24] each verse says she is rare
[34:26] a Proverbs 31 Woman is where
[34:29] don't try to be something
[34:31] that you see in a magazine or online
[34:35] you sisters
[34:38] you know we live in such a wicked age
[34:42] and and Esther would have been in the
[34:44] time in this Palace where this man had
[34:47] one of the largest harems probably of
[34:49] any of these empires of these Kings
[34:52] so there were maybe hundreds
[34:55] maybe maybe thousands of women that she
[34:58] would have had to have felt maybe that
[35:00] she had to compete with
[35:02] and I imagine not all of them are Jewish
[35:04] so not all of them have Godly standards
[35:06] so not all of them are dressing modest I
[35:10] imagine that many of them
[35:11] who went in before the king
[35:14] dressed very
[35:16] sensual
[35:18] to try to appeal to the king
[35:20] so you imagine this woman Queen Esther
[35:22] living in this kind of a day
[35:25] and I and I imagine because the
[35:28] scripture says that he he could call on
[35:30] any of these anyone in this in his Harem
[35:32] at any time if if he desired
[35:36] but
[35:38] Esther being a Jew
[35:40] knew that she she wanted to be
[35:44] the one and only
[35:46] so Esther would have been dressing
[35:48] modest she would have she would have
[35:50] done these things and yet all the women
[35:52] around her would have been scantily
[35:53] dressed
[35:55] probably hardly covered
[35:57] and then we bring that into today
[35:59] and you sisters you should you should
[36:01] you probably I assume that you probably
[36:04] feel like you're competing
[36:06] with worldly women and the way that
[36:08] worldly women dress and the way that
[36:09] worldly women look
[36:12] that's okay you don't have to say Amen
[36:14] I'm gonna preach anyway
[36:16] I imagine that you feel that way if I
[36:18] put myself in your shoes that would be
[36:20] how I feel
[36:21] to see these women around you to see to
[36:24] see what what men what what what men are
[36:27] being attracted to to see what the
[36:29] scripture says that the sons of God saw
[36:32] the daughters of men were were Fair
[36:34] and they and they fell by him and you
[36:37] sisters you see that today you see where
[36:39] pornography is on a rampant you see
[36:41] where and listen I want to say this
[36:45] you man we you know better
[36:49] we we've told you enough
[36:51] you know better than to look at
[36:52] pornography you know better than the
[36:55] than the than the stare you know better
[36:57] shame on us if we're still doing it God
[37:00] help us if we're still doing it
[37:03] but your sisters
[37:06] remember you're a tabernacle for these
[37:09] men
[37:10] you're a tabernacle for your husband
[37:12] you're you're uh you're you're a you're
[37:14] a shelter from these things
[37:17] so for one thing
[37:20] let me just think of how to say this and
[37:21] I because I'm not trying to say it
[37:23] harshly but
[37:24] but
[37:26] be Godly but be attractive for your
[37:28] husband
[37:36] amen
[37:39] uh maybe it was somebody back there
[37:41] could say Amen
[37:42] hello
[37:46] amen
[37:47] be attractive for your husband not
[37:50] competing I'm not saying compete for
[37:52] your husband
[37:53] but I I want to say this too because I
[37:56] was thinking about this today
[37:58] and it's not to give the man a license
[38:01] to sin okay that's not what I'm saying
[38:04] I'm saying pray for your man
[38:09] can I get a louder amen
[38:12] pray for your man
[38:14] I want to say have Grace for your man
[38:16] but I'm not I'm not saying have Grace
[38:18] and is a license to sin you know
[38:20] sometimes you have to have tough love
[38:21] and you have to show tough love and you
[38:23] have to say knock it off choose her or
[38:26] choose me but you only have one of us
[38:34] I'm going to say Amen to myself a little
[38:35] bit louder so I feel better about what
[38:37] I'm saying right now
[38:39] can you can you say Amen or am I
[38:41] completely off
[38:43] have Grace for him have he we're living
[38:46] in an age
[38:49] brother Jared was talking about the mind
[38:51] and the brain and the way that the the
[38:53] brain remembers things and and Lord
[38:56] willing Lord help me I want to bring a
[38:58] little bit more about that because
[39:01] Satan has so calculated his his tactics
[39:06] nowadays that the the brain can be so
[39:09] affected by what we see and by even even
[39:12] as a as a young boy if pornography was
[39:15] presented to to a young boy a a young
[39:18] girl even that so imprints in that in
[39:22] that memory bank of of those brains it
[39:26] literally changes the brain
[39:28] it literally takes the brain you can
[39:31] take a
[39:34] you can take a a a a porn addict and put
[39:37] it next to a heroin addict and the brain
[39:39] looks the same it literally starts a
[39:42] brain under under scan should be solid
[39:45] it should it should be smooth and when
[39:48] you take when you take a man who's
[39:50] feeding on wrong images or you take a
[39:52] man or woman who's who's on heroin and
[39:55] they're addicted uh uh you you start
[39:59] getting deformity in the brain and you
[40:02] start getting literal holes in the brain
[40:04] and what those holes are are where the
[40:06] brain actually shuts off
[40:09] to to give feed to another part of the
[40:12] brain that's that's being fed more it
[40:15] literally shuts that off so on a scan it
[40:17] shows a hole pray for one another
[40:19] because this is the battle that we face
[40:22] this is our Persia today this is we
[40:25] should be praying for one another
[40:27] Brothers have Grace for the Sisters pray
[40:30] for the sisters because they're they're
[40:32] being presented with well this is what's
[40:34] pretty this is what man wants sister
[40:37] that's not deep in the down in the heart
[40:40] of a godly man that's not what he wants
[40:44] so you hold to the standards of God you
[40:47] you hold you be that beautiful branch of
[40:50] the Lord you be glorious before God you
[40:53] be you live holy man you live holy you
[40:56] live you live to be a one one woman man
[41:00] in in girl uh uh a one a one uh uh one
[41:05] uh
[41:06] you know what I'm saying
[41:11] but but sis don't try to be something
[41:13] you're not brother don't try to be
[41:15] something you're not
[41:16] you're not a pornography looker
[41:19] you're you're not a double taker you're
[41:21] a Godly Man
[41:23] don't try to be something you're not
[41:25] don't try to measure up to the magazines
[41:27] and online first of all it's fake
[41:31] no matter what you think that that woman
[41:33] is pretty guy or girl trying to pattern
[41:36] yourself or looked after her to lust
[41:38] after her that woman is fake she's been
[41:40] she's been airbrushed she's been
[41:43] computer manipulated she's not real
[41:48] foreign
[41:54] to that woman sis
[41:56] but I'm not saying that to put you down
[41:58] I'm saying that because that woman that
[42:00] that you're trying to measure up to
[42:02] isn't real
[42:04] when she takes off the makeup she looks
[42:06] just like you without makeup
[42:08] probably worse
[42:11] because you have a natural beauty
[42:14] and I imagine after painting yourself so
[42:16] much it gets it
[42:18] Alters your looks a little bit
[42:23] amen
[42:28] ah listen I love you
[42:31] I love you all very much and and I just
[42:33] take the opportunity here to thank you
[42:35] for Sunday uh
[42:38] Pastor appreciation month is not
[42:40] supposed to be for the assistant pastor
[42:42] so I I sure appreciate the the gift and
[42:45] all the text and
[42:47] I was thinking about it and I thought
[42:48] you know I'm I'm I'm yoked with
[42:52] in my opinion one of the best pastors
[42:54] anybody could have
[42:57] and and and
[43:00] somehow
[43:02] I just feel So Unworthy to be yoked with
[43:05] him
[43:06] but I feel unworthy to to be part of
[43:09] this congregation and to be raised up
[43:12] and and to to to enter in the ministry
[43:15] preaching to you
[43:17] you guys have made it so easy
[43:19] I know I know you know we'll joke and we
[43:22] get it's it's our nervousness as
[43:24] preachers you know we'll joke and amen
[43:26] to ourselves and you know fear not their
[43:28] faces and things but I just want to say
[43:30] you guys have been the most gracious and
[43:32] and I just I love you and thank you
[43:41] where was I Esther was in the palace
[43:44] okay so we said that we'll skip that
[43:50] but I just want to repeat myself in
[43:52] saying that when the king saw Esther
[43:55] among all the other women that he could
[43:57] have chosen
[43:59] when your husband seen you out of all
[44:02] the women that he could have chosen he
[44:04] chose you
[44:05] that King chose Esther
[44:08] out of every woman that there was in
[44:10] that Palace out of every woman who
[44:12] dressed to appeal to the king Esther
[44:15] came in with her Purity and that's who a
[44:18] heathen King chose
[44:22] proverbs 31 11 she is trustworthy
[44:25] verse 12 she's constant in her love
[44:32] goes back to what we said about this
[44:33] evil age says be constant in your love
[44:39] verse 13 she's industrious she's which
[44:41] means she's diligent and hard-working
[44:44] one of the things brother Jack said and
[44:46] I just thought it was so amazing and I
[44:47] and I thought you know you you young
[44:49] sisters don't sit by and be idle and
[44:51] wait for a husband
[44:52] go do something
[44:55] Ruth was found in the field working when
[44:58] Boaz found her
[45:00] he said Rebecca was working when leaser
[45:03] founder and this was astounding to me
[45:05] because he did the math I guess or
[45:08] something but he said Rebecca when she
[45:10] offered to give Eliezer a drink
[45:15] did I say that right Eliezer okay
[45:18] when she offered to give him a drink and
[45:19] he prayed Lord if that's her then let
[45:21] her water my camels too
[45:23] brother Jack did the math and she would
[45:25] have had to have hauled up 200 gallons
[45:27] of water to water the camels
[45:33] she was hard working don't be idle
[45:36] waiting for a husband sis do do
[45:38] something
[45:41] she's Thrifty using money and other
[45:44] resources carefully and not wastefully
[45:48] and all of us husbands can smile because
[45:50] we know the word thrifting
[45:53] I'm gonna go thrifting
[45:57] you you use money and resources
[46:00] carefully and not wastefully when you
[46:01] Thrift
[46:03] um it's just how often do you Thrift
[46:08] verse 15 she's a self-starter verse 16
[46:11] she's enterprising which means having or
[46:14] showing initiative and resourcefulness
[46:17] she'll find ways to get something done I
[46:19] I admire that about your sisters and
[46:22] when I'm reading these I'm not saying
[46:24] that I'm not listen to me I'm not saying

[48:25] God said that you're a beautiful Branch
[48:27] unto the Lord
[48:32] I feel good about what I'm saying so
[48:35] verse 17 she's willing to do hard work
[48:39] Verse 18 she's willing to work long
[48:41] hours if she has to
[48:44] that's rough
[48:46] but sisters if if you don't have
[48:48] children if you're not married yet then

[49:16] monotonous work you know why I hate
[49:18] laundry because it's always there
[49:21] you know why I hate dishes because it's
[49:23] always there
[49:25] a man I'm maybe not all men are this way
[49:28] but I like to do something see it get
[49:30] done and move on to something else
[49:33] that sister is
[49:35] the it's just always there
[49:38] the the pile I she can get caught up and
[49:41] at the end of the day there's something
[49:42] there
[49:45] a proverbs 31 is willing to do
[49:47] monotonous work thank you sisters for
[49:49] doing the monotonous work
[49:51] uh verse 20 she's compassionate 21
[49:54] she's prepared for the future 22 good
[49:59] seamstress
[50:00] uh 23 married to a leader and I added
[50:03] this
[50:04] she's married to a leader she's not
[50:07] married marrying to lead
[50:11] we talked about that with vashti so I'm
[50:13] going to leave that alone
[50:15] verse 24 she's an entrepreneur a person
[50:18] who organizes and operates a business
[50:21] you say well I I'm not business-minded
[50:24] when you have your own home you'll need
[50:26] to organize and operate it efficiently
[50:28] and effectively
[50:30] you'll manage the employees
[50:33] your children
[50:35] you'll manage the the place of business
[50:37] your house
[50:39] all while the CEO is bringing in the
[50:41] bacon
[50:43] and I just thought I would add this
[50:45] brother you better be bringing in the
[50:47] bacon
[50:48] this is a Proverbs 31 Woman you better
[50:51] provide for that woman
[50:54] if you don't the scripture says you're
[50:56] worse than an Infidel and if this is how
[50:58] God sees these women I can understand
[51:00] why
[51:01] if you're not providing for that
[51:03] Proverbs 31 Woman God looks at you
[51:06] you're treating his beautiful Branch
[51:08] awful
[51:09] get up young guy get a get a career get
[51:14] a get a get a job first of all get a
[51:17] trade get an education something that's
[51:20] going to provide for your home later on
[51:22] don't be lazy
[51:25] listen I know some people they get into
[51:28] these things and they can make money
[51:30] playing Guitar Hero and everything else
[51:33] don't do something honorable please
[51:38] you're not going to make money playing
[51:40] video games more than likely you're not
[51:41] good enough
[51:43] I just let you have it brother
[51:45] get off the video games get off your
[51:49] lazy backside and go get a job
[51:54] I don't know who that was for but that
[51:56] felt good too
[52:00] verse 25
[52:02] she's not swayed by circumstances and
[52:05] he said something
[52:07] brother Jack did
[52:10] and I just thought was profound because
[52:14] we can we can belittle the women we can
[52:16] say she doesn't have the faith of a man
[52:19] I know a lot of women who have more
[52:21] faith than men
[52:22] but she's not swayed by circumstances
[52:24] God could have destroyed Sarah brother
[52:27] Jack brought out because she laughed in
[52:28] the tent
[52:30] at what God Said
[52:32] she laughed at first but at some point
[52:34] she caught the revelation
[52:37] and she caught the faith because she's
[52:39] in the book of Hebrews
[52:41] and it doesn't say she didn't believe it
[52:44] says she believed
[52:47] so she's not swayed by circumstances
[52:49] she's the emotional being
[52:53] she'll seem like she's swayed
[52:55] but I've seen women when they they're
[52:58] emotional at first and they seem swayed
[53:01] and yet they come around they swing
[53:03] around and their faith kicks in
[53:05] so don't belittle her brother you ought
[53:07] to lead her into faith if she's
[53:09] struggling
[53:12] I feel good about saying this so
[53:13] somebody needs it
[53:18] thank you
[53:20] I got I got two
[53:23] she needs she needs lead you
[53:28] you are to be her leader
[53:32] lead her in the faith
[53:35] don't belittle her lead her in the faith
[53:38] where's your leadership
[53:40] where's your faith that's strong enough
[53:42] to lead you that your wife can latch on
[53:44] to your faith
[53:48] I feel good verse 26 wise and kind
[53:53] 27 she's Duty conscious
[53:57] I thought of Esther Esther sacrificed
[54:00] her life for her people she was Duty
[54:02] conscious
[54:05] it goes back to she's not swayed by
[54:07] circumstances Sarah laughed at first but
[54:09] she caught the Revelation Esther was
[54:12] afraid at first
[54:13] but she caught the revelation
[54:17] she went before the king when she could
[54:18] have lost her life she was she was Duty
[54:21] conscious 28 she's blessed by her family
[54:24] 29 she's not satisfied with mediocre
[54:29] mediocre means it's it's mediocre's
[54:32] moderate it's it's ordinary it's medium
[54:34] it's it's fair
[54:37] or
[54:39] to say it bluntly it's not very good
[54:41] quality
[54:43] she's not satisfied with with not very
[54:46] good quality
[54:50] you still with me I'm almost done
[54:55] verse 30 woman of God
[54:58] in verse 31 she's praiseworthy
[55:02] brother she's worthy of your praise
[55:04] sister you should carry yourself
[55:06] praiseworthy worthy of his praise
[55:10] but brother give her a little bit of
[55:11] praise
[55:13] it'll go a long way
[55:15] give her give her some words of
[55:16] affirmation
[55:23] I've got a quote and then I'm done you
[55:24] can stand to your feet
[55:37] you don't have this in the back so I'm
[55:39] just going to read it
[55:46] so but now a good woman is a jewel in a
[55:49] man's crown
[55:50] she should be honored
[55:53] my mother's a woman my wife is and
[55:55] they're lovely and I've got thousands of
[55:57] Christian sisters who I highly respect
[56:00] but if they can respect what uh but if
[56:03] they can respect what God made them a
[56:05] motherhood and a real queen
[56:08] you say brother Brandon why are you
[56:10] typing me with Queen Esther
[56:12] because we had a prophet in this day
[56:15] listen if your husband if we're to be
[56:17] called Kings and Priests you're called
[56:19] to be a queen if your husband's called
[56:21] to be a king that makes you a queen
[56:24] brother Branham said
[56:26] if they can respect what God made them a
[56:28] motherhood and a real queen that's all
[56:30] right she's one of the best things that
[56:32] God could give a man was a wife besides
[56:35] salvation a wife is the best thing if
[56:38] she is a good wife
[56:41] this is this is your value sis
[56:46] but if she isn't Solomon said a good
[56:49] woman is a jewel in a crown but an
[56:51] ornery one or no good one as water in
[56:54] his blood and that's right it's the
[56:56] worst thing could happen so a good woman
[56:58] if you've got a good wife brother you
[57:01] ought to respect her with the highest
[57:04] that's right you should do that a real
[57:07] woman and children if you've got a real
[57:10] mother that stays home and tries to take
[57:12] care of you keeping your clothes clean
[57:14] sends you to school
[57:16] oh now we're talking to the kids respect
[57:18] your mommy
[57:22] sends you to school
[57:24] teaching you about Jesus
[57:27] you should honor that sweet old mother
[57:28] with all that's in you you should
[57:31] respect that woman yes sir because she's
[57:33] a real mother
[57:35] she's a real wife
[57:37] she's a queen
[57:39] brother that woman should be the queen
[57:41] of your heart
[57:46] another thing brother brother Jack said
[57:48] that brother Branham
[57:51] comments somewhere and he says
[57:55] I wish you'd have I wish I wish
[57:57] something along the lines of I wish you
[57:58] could have a wife like mine
[58:02] you you single Brothers I wish you could
[58:04] have a wife like mine
[58:06] you husband should be able to say I wish
[58:09] you could have a wife like mine
[58:11] amen
[58:15] amen
[58:18] brother Joe I I have nothing on my mind
[58:21] to sing right now so you can come on up
[58:26] why he's coming let's just
[58:32] let's just pray and and while we pray
[58:35] you who are here you who are listening
[58:37] in you who will hear this later
[58:41] especially you women if you're
[58:43] struggling with your self-worth and your
[58:45] self-image and and who God Made You your
[58:49] personality
[58:50] then I I want to pray for you
[58:53] because you are a beautiful branch of
[58:56] the Lord
[58:57] you are a Proverbs 31 Woman
[59:02] sis if you don't have the holy ghost
[59:04] seek it with all your heart
[59:06] don't seek a man seek God seek it with
[59:09] all your heart so you can be a Proverbs
[59:11] 31 Woman
[59:12] but
[59:13] I just think we live in such a dark time
[59:17] and and for brothers and sisters alike
[59:20] but I just I just think of the pressure
[59:22] on on sisters
[59:25] while I'm studying this the pressure
[59:28] that had to be on Queen Esther so I want
[59:30] to pray for you so let's bow our hearts
[59:33] Heavenly Father we come before you Lord
[59:35] and
[59:37] Lord I know God I
[59:39] a little jokey tonight but
[59:41] I pray father that these sisters
[59:44] especially
[59:46] I pray God that they would catch your
[59:48] heart
[59:50] I pray that they would see themselves
[59:52] through your eyes
[59:54] and I pray Lord that these brothers
[59:56] would look at these women right I pray
[59:59] that you would help me to look at them
[1:00:01] right to look at my wife right
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:04] Lord we live in a Time father where
[1:00:08] If we're honest pornography has probably
[1:00:11] been flashed before everybody's eyes
[1:00:13] [Music]
[1:00:16] Satan Lord as as I've just heard
[1:00:19] different things of how the the brain
[1:00:22] works and
[1:00:26] how how social media affects us how
[1:00:30] pornography affects us
[1:00:33] I think you devil
[1:00:36] what a devil to know that and to pray on
[1:00:39] the minds and to try to get it to young
[1:00:42] people
[1:00:43] to children
[1:00:46] what a devil that we're fighting in this
[1:00:48] age but father you said through all of
[1:00:51] that we would be victorious we would
[1:00:54] come out more than conquer so Lord I'm
[1:00:57] praying for every sister
[1:01:00] every sister who would hear this every
[1:01:03] sister who wouldn't hear this I pray for
[1:01:06] them Lord that you would let Revelation
[1:01:08] strike their their heart God
[1:01:11] not not just their mind but strike their
[1:01:13] heart Lord that it would give them a
[1:01:15] sound mind it would it would clarify
[1:01:17] things in their mind but Lord Let It
[1:01:20] Strike their heart tonight God that they
[1:01:22] are a Proverbs 31 Woman that they have
