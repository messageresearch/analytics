[0:00] 8 and it texts here we praise the lord
[0:02] for the word that's been coming forth
[0:04] brother diggs brother george smith and
[0:06] wednesday night the different brothers
[0:08] we're blessed to have in
[0:10] and we may the lord just continue to
[0:12] bring us revelation
[0:13] but we want to read a
[0:15] portion of scripture from matthew
[0:16] chapter 8
[0:18] and start reading at verse 5.
[0:27] amen
[0:29] and when jesus was entered into
[0:31] capernaum there came unto him a
[0:33] centurion a roman centurion beseeching
[0:36] him and saying lord
[0:38] my servant lieth at my home sick of the
[0:40] palsy grievously tormented
[0:43] and jesus saith unto him i will come and
[0:45] heal him
[0:46] the centurion answered and said lord
[0:50] i'm not worthy that thou should has come
[0:52] under my roof
[0:53] but speak the word only
[0:56] and my servant shall be healed
[1:00] for i am a man under authority
[1:06] having soldiers unto me probably a
[1:08] hundred if he was a centurion that's a
[1:10] hundred probably a hundred soldiers in
[1:13] in under his jurisdiction
[1:15] i'm a man under authority having
[1:17] soldiers under me and i say to this man
[1:19] go and he goeth and another one come and
[1:21] he cometh and to my servant do this and
[1:23] he do with it when jesus heard it he
[1:26] marveled and said to them that followed
[1:28] verily i say unto you i have not found
[1:31] so great faith no
[1:33] not in all of israel
[1:38] and i say unto you that many shall come
[1:41] from the east and west and shall sit
[1:44] down with abraham and isaac and jacob in
[1:47] the kingdom of heaven and there he is
[1:49] referring to the gentiles who jews
[1:50] didn't think gentiles could be saved
[1:52] here's a gentile roman soldier that act
[1:55] jesus said has more faith than all the
[1:56] jews that i've seen so far he's in
[1:58] another realm of faith he's saying
[2:00] something that it is totally at a
[2:02] different level and he's a roman he's
[2:04] saying listen there's going to be
[2:06] gentiles and other ones besides jews
[2:07] come in and he says they're going to be
[2:10] with sit down with abraham isaac and
[2:11] jacob too aren't you glad this morning
[2:13] that the gentiles were able to come in
[2:15] aren't you glad that you're going to be
[2:16] able to sit down with abraham and isaac
[2:18] too not just the jews
[2:20] amen i look forward to that day but
[2:22] verse 12 the children of the kingdom
[2:24] shall be cast out into outer darkness
[2:26] he's referring to some of the jews he's
[2:29] referring to the the ones that should
[2:30] have received him and they didn't there
[2:32] shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth
[2:35] why because they missed their messiah
[2:37] they missed who he was
[2:39] and once you realize you rejected him
[2:41] then there's going to be weeping and
[2:43] gnashing of teeth
[2:44] didn't recognize who jesus was verse 13
[2:47] and jesus said unto the centurion go thy
[2:49] way and as thou hast believed so be it
[2:53] done unto thee
[2:54] and his servant at home
[2:57] was healed in the selfsame hour
[3:00] amen
[3:01] so i want to speak on finding god's
[3:03] authority
[3:05] and coming under it
[3:08] heavenly father bless your word today we
[3:10] commit it to you
[3:11] we pray you on anointed and as i spoke
[3:14] to you earlier lord and said
[3:16] that there's so many things that you
[3:19] give us that we could say
[3:21] but it's not about so many things it's
[3:23] but it's it's it's comes down to what
[3:25] you want to say
[3:27] and what's needed for these precious
[3:29] people and my life and my family bless
[3:32] us with your word today in season in
[3:35] jesus name amen god bless you maybe see
[3:38] what shake somebody's hand before you
[3:39] sit down
[3:41] say god bless you
[3:47] so i'm going to speak a little bit this
[3:49] morning on a couple things and um maybe
[3:52] in a couple sundays from now as well i'm
[3:54] going to speak about authority
[3:56] and submission
[3:58] two words that uh most people today shy
[4:01] away from
[4:05] and sometimes we shy away from authority
[4:07] and submission well we we shy away from
[4:09] them for many different reasons i
[4:11] suppose
[4:12] but um many times it's that we don't
[4:15] understand
[4:16] authority and submission the way that it
[4:18] should be
[4:19] we live in a world that um we have
[4:22] situations where authority and
[4:23] submission has got off track and it's
[4:26] authorities misused and of course we
[4:29] live in a nation that the spirit is
[4:30] laodicea and laodicea is people's rights
[4:34] exercising their own authority instead
[4:35] of coming under authority so when you
[4:38] speak about this these things it's a bit
[4:40] tedious because
[4:42] the words have been so ruined by the
[4:44] enemy but a lot of times it's just
[4:46] people don't understand the way that it
[4:48] should be according to god's kingdom
[4:50] and when we understand it then it's
[4:53] probably one of the greatest blessings
[4:55] that we can see in our lives in relation
[4:58] to the word of god
[5:00] is authority and submission to the word
[5:02] of god and submission to god's authority
[5:04] it's one of the greatest things because
[5:06] we can go throughout the bible and see
[5:09] the power that comes when god's people
[5:12] break find find
[5:14] they find where god's delegated
[5:17] authority is for the hour they find it
[5:19] first of all you have to find it is this
[5:21] god and is this his authority and once
[5:23] you find it to bring your life in order
[5:26] with it and bring your life under it and
[5:27] your family under it when that's
[5:29] happened i'll tell you it had a powerful
[5:31] effect and sometimes it had a powerful
[5:34] effect even when the leadership got off
[5:37] track as a human being god still blessed
[5:41] the submission to his authority
[5:45] so you know
[5:48] some of the reasons has been messed up
[5:49] and so you know we're heading to a
[5:51] climax today of a lawless society how
[5:55] many believe that the bible speaks of
[5:57] lawlessness coming uh the antichrist
[5:59] brings more of this spirit of
[6:01] lawlessness you know defund the police
[6:03] remove authorities we don't need this
[6:05] anymore so it's a lawlessness society
[6:08] where they want to remove all authority
[6:10] they want to take all the things that's
[6:12] telling them what to do and and you know
[6:14] you remember brother brown talked about
[6:15] the the police officer who he doesn't
[6:18] really have any authority himself but
[6:20] because he's been hired by the
[6:22] government to enact the laws and to he
[6:25] he's not so much he as a you don't look
[6:28] at the man but you look the man's badge
[6:31] can you say amen so that's how the
[6:32] authority of god works as well you don't
[6:34] look at the man but you look at what god
[6:36] has placed within him and so you know
[6:38] people have to so now defund the police
[6:40] def take all this waste because of the
[6:42] spirit of lawlessness comes in just
[6:45] before the antichrist comes in and
[6:47] becomes incarnate then we see the spirit
[6:49] of lawlessness takes over this entire
[6:52] nation and we can spend a lot of time on
[6:54] that but i don't need to because you can
[6:55] watch every day as the spirit of
[6:58] lawlessness takes over this country
[7:00] takes over this world can you say amen
[7:03] amen so so someone under the spirit of
[7:05] disobedience sometimes is blind to how
[7:10] the outcome will be and that's our world
[7:12] is when you start defunding the police
[7:14] when you start saying we don't want
[7:15] authorities we want we want to remove
[7:17] the christian churches and by the way
[7:19] it's if you don't think that there's
[7:21] going to be more more of a pressure on
[7:23] particularly christian churches you're
[7:25] missing something because it's coming
[7:27] more and more our dear brothers and
[7:29] sisters in canada are experiencing it
[7:31] already in newfoundland just i believe
[7:34] this week they asked for prayer because
[7:36] they were the the province was asking
[7:38] for an 80 vaccination for everyone in
[7:42] the country and churches included and
[7:44] then they moved it in one day's time and
[7:46] they changed it to a hundred percent
[7:48] vaccination and came and told the pastor
[7:50] and said your entire church has to be
[7:52] vaccinated or you can't meet together so
[7:56] listen it's time to wake up
[7:58] time to wake up i'm not on a discussion
[8:01] about getting the vaccine or not getting
[8:02] back that's up to your personal choice
[8:04] but if that's happening there it's
[8:06] coming down the pike can you say man and
[8:08] they have to use something like that to
[8:10] for control but what we have is is as a
[8:13] spirit that dominates the last
[8:15] generation and the thing is is that they
[8:17] want to remove all authorities and they
[8:19] want to be the authority and remove the
[8:21] authorities in your life if they want to
[8:23] do that someone that's under the spirit
[8:25] of disobedience which our dignitaries in
[8:28] this world is and all these other things
[8:30] a lot of times they're blind to how the
[8:31] outcome will be
[8:33] would you want to live in a nation to
[8:34] remove all police
[8:37] what are we going to live in can you say
[8:39] man if you start removing those
[8:40] authorities that god what kind of world
[8:42] are we going to live in and people will
[8:44] keep pushing for it because they're
[8:46] blinded by their disobedience
[8:49] and it's the same word our lives we have
[8:51] to look at ourselves is that sometimes
[8:53] we can be in direct disobedience to god
[8:55] and his word and by that we come blinded
[8:58] and we don't know what's that's going to
[8:59] produce in our life in 10 years in five
[9:02] years in our family in our children
[9:05] disobedience does not ever bring the
[9:08] right fruit in your family
[9:12] so this important thing and so we see
[9:14] many things can be said about that many
[9:16] things can be said about you know the
[9:18] world we live in
[9:19] and you don't want to go down a road
[9:21] like that but the only thing we can do
[9:22] is apply it spiritually this morning is
[9:24] we don't want to go down the road of
[9:26] disobedience to the word of god
[9:29] we don't want to see what that brings
[9:30] can you say amen our nation's going that
[9:32] way but we got to look and say lord
[9:34] you've sent down your headship in this
[9:37] hour this message and this presidency is
[9:39] your headship and i want to come
[9:41] underneath that headship with all of my
[9:42] life i want to teach my children to come
[9:44] underneath that headship
[9:47] praise the lord
[9:48] and so many things can be said about
[9:50] that
[9:51] there's many roads to the subject of
[9:53] authority
[9:54] uh even the universe functions by the
[9:56] powers and authority that god puts in
[9:58] place
[9:59] how many believe that
[10:01] god has set everything up by authority
[10:03] and a lot of it under his authority and
[10:05] he set it up the universe that way and
[10:07] how everything functions
[10:09] and we live by it we we
[10:12] when we when we have an injustice in our
[10:14] lives do you know what you do how many
[10:16] has ever how many's ever walked into a
[10:18] place a restaurant or you're on the
[10:20] phone with somebody and so you're not
[10:22] getting too many places so you yourself
[10:25] probably have after you get so
[10:27] frustrated you say
[10:28] can i speak to a manager
[10:33] come on all you holy people
[10:35] you know
[10:36] if there's an injustice being done what
[10:38] you're doing is asking for a higher
[10:40] authority
[10:42] you're calling for a higher authority
[10:45] because you're not getting anywhere with
[10:47] this
[10:48] guy or this woman who can't even speak
[10:51] english on the phone
[10:53] you can't even understand what she's
[10:54] saying
[10:55] can i talk to someone else but if you're
[10:57] not getting if there's an injustice
[10:58] someone has done you wrong you know what
[11:00] you do naturally you call upon a higher
[11:02] authority i'm telling your friends we
[11:04] need to learn that in the spiritual
[11:08] and when frustrations come we have a
[11:10] higher authority to call upon we have a
[11:13] council that we can go to
[11:16] we ought to be looking for the authority
[11:18] of god god where are you speaking and
[11:20] lord in that authority i want to be
[11:22] underneath that because i need some
[11:24] answers can you say that when the devil
[11:26] is doing me injustice i call on a higher
[11:28] authority
[11:30] [Applause]
[11:32] i should be his name
[11:34] so and to let you know that many themes
[11:37] in my life the last five years and some
[11:40] of the themes that i preach on are
[11:42] influenced by my observation of things
[11:44] that's manifesting sometimes
[11:47] among our ranks around the world among
[11:49] our ranks around those who who celebrate
[11:52] the light that's been sent to us and the
[11:54] message if we call it that i my
[11:56] observation is there's some fruit
[11:58] sometimes that come out of things that
[12:00] i'm going how can that kind of fruit
[12:02] come out of somebody who's close
[12:05] to
[12:06] the the message of the hour
[12:09] and you have heard me speak on some of
[12:11] these things
[12:13] because it's it's it's frustrating
[12:16] but it's a reality
[12:18] in our own ranks
[12:20] pride
[12:22] message pride
[12:25] rebellion
[12:28] not only in the people but in ministers
[12:30] sometimes
[12:31] hypocrisy
[12:33] living all praise be to god and live in
[12:36] a different life at home and and cussing
[12:38] and doing all kinds of other things at
[12:40] home
[12:41] hypocrisy
[12:43] the misuse now we'll talk about
[12:45] authority how many has observed the
[12:47] misuse of authority
[12:50] the misuse of the quotes
[12:56] when satan was quoting the word to jesus
[12:58] he was quoting the word to jesus
[13:00] and he was quoting the direct scriptures
[13:02] it wasn't like twisting it with the
[13:04] serpent with eve but satan was quoting
[13:06] scriptures when jesus was tempted he was
[13:08] quoting scriptures to jesus
[13:11] but it was the wrong motive it was the
[13:13] wrong spirit behind the scriptures
[13:16] you don't think the devil can do that
[13:17] today you don't think the devil can
[13:19] twist the interpretation of the bible
[13:21] you don't think the devil can twist the
[13:23] interpretation of quotes i'll tell you
[13:25] we need to be humble and say god let the
[13:27] interpretation come like the prophet
[13:28] taught us he interprets his word by
[13:30] bringing it to pass and let me be very
[13:33] careful to interpret those quotes to fit
[13:35] my own opinion
[13:37] we have seen the abuse of authority we
[13:40] have seen the influence of others to
[13:42] speak against authority we've to
[13:44] undermine authority to gossip about
[13:46] authority and it's it's not been a good
[13:48] result and then we've seen the struggle
[13:50] for positions and
[13:52] sometimes in a church you know who's
[13:53] going to be this and who's in charge and
[13:55] we've seen these struggles of positions
[13:57] we've seen jealousies of other people's
[14:00] positions we have watched these things
[14:02] for countless years and all this does
[14:04] not seem right
[14:06] around the wonderful message that we
[14:08] hold
[14:11] i said it doesn't seem right that those
[14:13] things are coming out of the message
[14:15] that we hold
[14:17] it's like paul said about sexual sin let
[14:20] none of those things be once named among
[14:22] you as become his saints we should never
[14:24] hear of that
[14:26] that was his goal we should never hear
[14:28] of sexual sin and all this stuff going
[14:30] on coming out of the true people of god
[14:32] it does but we should never have that
[14:36] but when i got to thinking about it
[14:38] this all happened in heaven
[14:40] before any any anything happened on
[14:43] earth
[14:44] these same attributes came out of
[14:46] lucifer
[14:48] all the things i just mentioned came out
[14:50] of lucifer and he was right in the
[14:53] presence of the lord
[14:55] he was an angel right under the presence
[14:57] of the lord under his subjection you
[15:00] couldn't get any closer to god he's an
[15:02] object of worship and so he had angels
[15:04] to worship him there was none of us yet
[15:06] there was no human beings but all of a
[15:08] sudden over who knows how much time all
[15:11] these attributes begin to come out of
[15:13] lucifer pride
[15:16] undermining god's authority
[15:19] influence of someone else
[15:22] talking to the other angels undermining
[15:24] god's authority influencing them away
[15:26] from god he drew a third part of the
[15:29] angels with him
[15:32] pride
[15:36] influencing others
[15:39] rebellion
[15:41] how many knows your bible say that's
[15:42] what happened before we even came to
[15:44] earth
[15:45] and that was the closest thing to you
[15:47] could get to the presence of the lord
[15:49] and you see all these things come out of
[15:51] lucifer so we can safely say now if that
[15:53] all happened in heaven and that was
[15:55] manifested around the presence of god
[15:58] rebellion to the word and a twisted
[16:01] authority
[16:02] came to earth then
[16:04] it then it moved to earth and influenced
[16:07] through the serpent to eve a twisted
[16:09] authority and rebellion to the word was
[16:12] passed to eve
[16:13] from the serpent and satan influencing
[16:17] this this vessel of the serpent to speak
[16:20] to eve because he was the only other one
[16:22] in the ana kingdom that could speak to
[16:23] eve he spoke and reasoned with the word
[16:26] of god in the original word that had the
[16:28] authority in it to give adam and eve the
[16:31] authority over this whole earth he
[16:33] started messing with that authority he
[16:35] started reasoning with it but where did
[16:37] it originate in a principle in lucifer
[16:40] to rebel against god's authority and now
[16:42] he's speaking to the woman
[16:46] eve and he he brings all that to earth
[16:49] and it causes man to fall
[16:51] but the principle
[16:53] started
[16:54] with lucifer i'd like to say
[16:56] that
[16:59] any rebellion to god
[17:01] and his authority
[17:03] is always
[17:05] satan-inspired
[17:11] praise the lord
[17:13] bring this out here i took this from
[17:15] brother george
[17:19] i said give me that i'm going to use
[17:20] that
[17:24] if you weren't here wednesday night
[17:26] you brother george used this as a visual
[17:28] for balance but he mostly used it when
[17:31] someone fell asleep
[17:32] you woke them up
[17:37] and this potentially could be a sermon
[17:39] that you
[17:41] zone out or just i don't know so i got
[17:44] this this morning
[17:48] don't worry i'll just use it just one
[17:50] service that's all
[17:58] watchmen nee a missionary to china
[18:03] uh has a book uh
[18:05] spiritual authority that i've always
[18:07] enjoyed
[18:08] and
[18:10] you know he refers to isaiah 14 and
[18:12] ezekiel were exposed as lucifer in his
[18:14] ways
[18:15] and he speaks a little bit about
[18:18] his rebellion to authority and he says
[18:20] in serving god
[18:22] we must not violate authorities because
[18:24] to do so is a principle of satan
[18:27] how can we preach christ according to
[18:29] satan's principle
[18:31] yet it is possible and he's he's doing
[18:33] some
[18:34] teaching to young ministers this is what
[18:36] this book is
[18:38] he said yes it is possible to work it is
[18:41] possible in our work to stand with
[18:43] christ in doctrine
[18:44] while at the same time stand with satan
[18:47] in principle
[18:49] that's pretty deep
[18:51] how very wicked for us to assume that we
[18:53] are doing the work of the lord please
[18:54] not take note that satan
[18:56] is not afraid of our preaching the word
[18:58] of christ yet how very much he is in
[19:00] fear of our being subject to the
[19:03] authority of christ he's dead on can you
[19:05] say man because the reason christ and
[19:07] all the men of god could exercise the
[19:09] authority of god the way that they did
[19:11] is because they became a man that was
[19:13] subject to god's authority jesus said i
[19:15] do nothing except my father shows me oh
[19:18] if we could live that way friends
[19:20] i don't make a move unless i pray about
[19:22] and get some counsel can you say amen
[19:25] i'm a son that's under authority and
[19:26] then you have that his authority flows
[19:29] through you that you have authority
[19:30] against the enemy
[19:32] that's how his authority works
[19:35] satan is not afraid of our preaching of
[19:37] the word yet how much very afraid he is
[19:39] in fear of our being subject to
[19:41] authority of christ and uh i remember
[19:43] brother branham saying it more clearly
[19:45] and that is that he says satan is not
[19:47] afraid of our dancing and shouting and
[19:50] and all these other things but all that
[19:52] sanctified life that's life that's under
[19:55] subjection to god that is th that's the
[19:57] thing that shakes the kingdom of satan
[20:01] he goes on later here to say the present
[20:04] age that we are
[20:05] is character characterized by
[20:07] lawlessness the world is full of the sin
[20:10] of lawlessness and soon the son of the
[20:13] son of lawlessness shall appear
[20:15] authority in the world is being
[20:17] increasingly undermined is 1948 friends
[20:21] authority in the world is being
[20:22] increasingly undermined until all at the
[20:25] end all authorities will be overthrown
[20:28] and lawlessness shall rule
[20:30] let us know that there are two
[20:32] principles in the universe
[20:34] the principle of god's authority and the
[20:36] principle of satan's rebellion we cannot
[20:39] serve god and simultaneously go the way
[20:42] of rebellion by having a rebellious
[20:45] spirit satan laughs when a rebellious
[20:48] person preaches the word
[20:51] you can't get satan to laugh any more
[20:54] than to have the deception of somebody
[20:56] who's under actually internally a
[20:58] rebellion to the word personally
[21:00] themselves and preaching the word satan
[21:03] laughs in that and i agree with it he
[21:05] laughs at it because you can't get more
[21:07] deceiving than that if someone could be
[21:08] so deceived to preach doctrine and
[21:11] preach the word and or try to say i'm in
[21:13] the messenger i'm in the word but yet
[21:15] internally it's a spirit of rebellion
[21:17] i'm not doing that i'm not doing this
[21:19] i'm not i'm going to pick and choose
[21:20] what i want out of the word of god
[21:22] it's the principle of satan
[21:25] god can never bless it
[21:28] satan laughs when a
[21:31] satan laughs when a rebellious person
[21:33] preaches the word
[21:35] for in that person is dwelling the
[21:36] satanic principle the principle of
[21:38] service must be authority are we going
[21:41] to obey god's authority or not we who
[21:43] serve god must have this basic
[21:46] understanding of authority anyone who
[21:48] has once experienced an electric shock
[21:51] knows thereafter that he cannot be
[21:53] careless with electricity
[21:57] likewise the person who has once been
[21:58] smitten by god's authority from then on
[22:01] has his eyes open to judge what is
[22:04] lawless both in himself and in others
[22:06] may god be gracious to us by delivering
[22:09] us from rebellion
[22:11] may god be gracious to us this morning
[22:14] by delivering us from all rebellion only
[22:17] after we have known god's authority and
[22:19] learned obedience can we lead his
[22:21] children in a straight path
[22:24] it's powerful friends can you say amen
[22:27] it's it it's powerful to see that
[22:29] principle may god be gracious to us he
[22:32] says that we'd have all this rebellion
[22:34] purged out of us because god may have
[22:37] let something work for a while and let
[22:38] you go on for a while but there's
[22:40] something
[22:41] huge missing and that's this you can't
[22:44] have both principles you can't have the
[22:47] authority of god working correctly and a
[22:49] rebellion internally on the inside and
[22:52] it's like the electricity once they've
[22:53] shot one you can tell your kids
[22:56] but once they've been shocked by it
[22:57] you're probably not going to have to
[22:59] tell them to get quit putting your
[23:00] finger in that plug
[23:04] i'm just going to stop right here and
[23:06] say
[23:08] that
[23:09] when moses
[23:12] who was trained in all of egypt's ways
[23:15] to do things he was a he was a warrior
[23:17] he was as an organizer he was in charge
[23:21] of egypt for the most part he was next
[23:23] in line he knew all the psychology how
[23:26] to deal with people how to lead people
[23:27] how to michael managed people and so you
[23:30] would have thought i think brother
[23:31] brahma even says one place is that you
[23:32] would have thought this was the man with
[23:34] all of his training to lead the children
[23:35] of israel out so he would do it by his
[23:37] training but god said no i don't do it
[23:39] that way i don't do it that way so
[23:41] here's a man pretty confident pretty
[23:43] confident and so now god says i'm going
[23:45] to lead you gets a hold of him takes
[23:47] them out the back side of the desert and
[23:48] brother bram says is to to teach them
[23:50] human weakness that god said i'm i'm not
[23:53] going to use any of your former teaching
[23:55] on authority to bring my people out of
[23:58] egypt
[23:59] and so like this electrical shock one
[24:01] day there's a burning bush and this
[24:03] moment with god and all of a sudden this
[24:05] confident man starts to say but
[24:08] he can't speak
[24:09] oh lord i i can't he said take your
[24:11] shoes off the ground you're standing
[24:13] outside all his life he had never been
[24:15] in a presence like this
[24:18] is something different in that bush
[24:20] he come into the presence of god
[24:22] and he was he was burnt pretty good he
[24:24] was
[24:25] he was
[24:26] he couldn't say he said god i'm not your
[24:28] man i can't even and he's stuttering and
[24:33] he can't even speak
[24:37] and god begins to tell him what he's
[24:38] going to do through him
[24:40] and so now
[24:42] the same man in his humility he's been
[24:44] shocked by this electricity
[24:46] now goes down and through his words he's
[24:49] going to call flies he's going to call
[24:52] this he's going to open up the red sea
[24:54] he's going to god's not going to do it
[24:55] but god's going to use his vocal cords
[24:57] to do all the and exercise the full
[24:59] authority of god but i can tell you
[25:03] god did not trust that until he himself
[25:07] had been really affected by the presence
[25:09] of god to where he couldn't say nothing
[25:12] speed ahead to paul
[25:14] and this great man of authority within
[25:16] the church had been trained by different
[25:19] great teachers and he actually was
[25:21] exercising authority i'm going to get
[25:22] letters and put these christians in jail
[25:24] he was organizing he's putting it
[25:26] together he was a man who knew how to
[25:27] get things done he knew authority can
[25:29] you say man and on his on his horse on
[25:32] the way somewhere god knocks him down
[25:34] the pillar of fire there and all of a
[25:35] sudden he comes in the midst of the
[25:37] pillar of fire and this this electricity
[25:40] can you say man this power can you say
[25:42] man he couldn't even speak he was
[25:44] blinded couldn't hardly say nothing
[25:46] except the words lord
[25:48] who art thou
[25:50] he knew this is different this isn't
[25:52] gamalie this isn't my teachers he come
[25:55] into the presence and to the authority
[25:57] of god and it had an effect on him to
[26:00] humble him to shut your mouth and let me
[26:04] speak to you
[26:05] you know brother diggs said last week
[26:07] god was saying shut up i don't say it
[26:10] that's extreme but god said shut up to
[26:13] moses
[26:14] but really he's saying that i need to so
[26:16] move upon you that you just shut up you
[26:18] just
[26:19] you can't even speak and then god's got
[26:21] you where he wants you
[26:25] you've controlled things you have done
[26:27] things you you've micromanaged things
[26:29] and i want everybody to apply this in
[26:30] your life if you're in a position of
[26:32] authority of a husband father
[26:36] mother over her children
[26:38] you can apply all this
[26:40] i don't have time today but i could go
[26:42] into all these avenues
[26:43] because if god's going to hand authority
[26:45] you need the humility to be able to
[26:46] handle it
[26:49] god got him just where he wanted him
[26:52] couldn't even speak
[26:54] couldn't hardly say nothing blind
[26:56] someone leads him to a little home
[26:59] and he has to wait there and then god
[27:01] sends a no-name in the body of christ
[27:04] nobody no position ananias no position
[27:07] don't even know his name don't know
[27:08] where he come from and god says you're
[27:10] going to submit to ananias in the body
[27:13] you're going to listen to him if you
[27:14] want the holy ghost he's going to lay
[27:15] hands on you to get the holy ghost
[27:17] now if paul would have said i'm not even
[27:20] listening to a guy like that that's not
[27:21] how things work bring me gamalie bring
[27:24] me somebody in a position who's ananias
[27:27] but god made him submit to somebody in
[27:30] the body of christ
[27:34] is anybody learning anything this
[27:35] morning
[27:36] i'll tell you this many many years ago
[27:38] by the time you're here
[27:40] but tom
[27:42] praise the lord got a great report from
[27:44] the doctor last friday
[27:46] his tests are doing good
[27:48] amen amen
[27:50] [Applause]
[27:53] but tom when we started the church he
[27:55] started some gym classes you know so i
[27:57] want to take my kids they were little
[27:58] guys and i knew i needed to work out a
[28:00] little bit and encourage everybody to go
[28:01] so i went to his gym class
[28:03] so i was going for a few weeks and then
[28:04] i wore this t-shirt to brother tom's gym
[28:06] class now i'm the pastor and i wrote a
[28:08] t-shirt that day that said
[28:11] this working out thing is not working
[28:13] out
[28:15] i did i i wore a t-shirt like that i
[28:17] thought it was funny
[28:20] i'm always joking about waiting stuff
[28:22] and it's probably because i got a
[28:23] problem
[28:24] and we always kind of laugh off things
[28:26] that we really got a problem with
[28:28] you know why i know this because my wife
[28:30] tells me i have a problem joking about
[28:32] it
[28:33] i thought this was so funny and brother
[28:35] tom was right there said
[28:38] don't wear that shirt again to this gym
[28:40] class
[28:43] don't ever wear it again
[28:45] now i'm the pastor
[28:47] i can take that a lot of ways
[28:51] but because early in my life
[28:53] i learned about god's delegated
[28:55] authorities
[28:57] and when the authority is there it's not
[28:59] about the man
[29:01] it's about the authority
[29:03] that's right so i submitted thank the
[29:06] lord
[29:07] i don't know what he had done next
[29:09] [Laughter]
[29:12] it's not how big the man is it's the
[29:15] authority behind him
[29:17] and i wanted to go to that class i
[29:19] really did but i submitted myself
[29:21] there's other cases in the church that
[29:23] have come up and
[29:24] even even uh brother branham says
[29:27] pastors congregations submit yourself to
[29:29] your pastor
[29:32] and then he says pastor submit yourself
[29:33] to your congregation
[29:35] there's a lot of preachers leave the
[29:36] other part out
[29:39] but paul says in ephesians brothers
[29:41] submit yourself one to another why is
[29:44] that why because god's bringing his
[29:46] authority and his presence in his people
[29:49] and it's not about the people i ain't
[29:51] going to submit myself to someone like
[29:52] that brother i'll never break you better
[29:54] be careful what you say
[29:56] because you may be bucking up against
[29:58] god's authority in that person
[30:02] wives you better be careful what you say
[30:04] it's not about the man all the time it's
[30:07] about the authority god places in him
[30:10] well what if he don't do the right
[30:12] things and him his authority is this way
[30:14] in that way and then
[30:16] i i i don't know but just be careful
[30:19] what you're saying because god's
[30:20] watching the whole thing
[30:27] okay well let me say this too
[30:31] when i
[30:34] see god spoke to me about the ministry
[30:37] it was after this first thing that
[30:39] happened
[30:40] to me and i was in college i was in the
[30:42] dorm at college
[30:44] and
[30:48] you know i referred to moses and paul
[30:49] i'm not at all on that level of course
[30:51] as a prophet
[30:52] but something happened to me and i don't
[30:54] share this a lot
[30:56] because i don't like to make a big deal
[30:58] out of it but something came in my room
[30:59] when i was napping
[31:01] and i had to took a lot of naps because
[31:03] college was rough on me i i don't like
[31:05] school
[31:06] and it was really tough you know for me
[31:08] to adjust to that so any chance i get
[31:10] i'd take a little nap so it was in the
[31:11] afternoon about two o'clock my roommate
[31:13] wasn't in there
[31:14] and uh
[31:15] i had the window open and i can tell you
[31:18] and i wouldn't say this before god
[31:20] before you unless i i knew that there
[31:22] was another presence in the room and a
[31:24] light come it come in the room it come
[31:26] in my window and it it woke me up i
[31:29] don't know about the noise of it but it
[31:31] was just such a presence it woke up and
[31:33] so i just i was laying down i looked up
[31:36] and there was just something hanging
[31:37] beside my bed and all i can tell you is
[31:39] i was completely paralyzed
[31:42] i couldn't speak i didn't want to speak
[31:44] to it
[31:45] i didn't want to say anything i didn't
[31:47] actually want to be there i had sets the
[31:48] fear of god i said this is something
[31:51] different
[31:53] and in some ways you hope if you're
[31:55] looking for leadership in your life you
[31:56] hope something speaks out of that
[32:00] but there's another side you say please
[32:02] don't speak out of that
[32:05] now we're talking about the fear of god
[32:08] we're not talking about fear scared but
[32:10] we're talking about the fear and
[32:11] reverence of god
[32:14] and something just happened to me and so
[32:16] nothing ever did was said but it was the
[32:18] beginnings of god getting my attention
[32:21] that he had a ministry for me and so
[32:22] just hung over there probably about a
[32:24] minute and i was just paralyzed and so
[32:26] that's why when i can read moses and
[32:28] difference in the bible when you come in
[32:29] the presence of god that way you know
[32:31] it's not you're shouting and jumping
[32:34] [Music]
[32:37] brother brahman says the shouting and
[32:38] jumping rejoicing is the blessings of
[32:40] god and we should do that if we're happy
[32:42] about the word
[32:43] but when his presence comes in certain
[32:45] ways it's not about shouting and jumping
[32:47] we feel very sober
[32:50] about where we're at with the lord we
[32:52] feel exposed can you say amen
[32:54] and he can come in this room this
[32:56] morning in such a way we'd all be on the
[32:58] ground
[33:00] how many
[33:01] we would all be on the ground there
[33:03] would be no word set if he came in in
[33:06] that kind of fullness that way and his
[33:08] but see god is not interested just doing
[33:10] that he wants us to have the reverence
[33:12] of his presence every day in our lives
[33:15] that we watch the decisions we make and
[33:18] we're reverent not to seek our own will
[33:21] but god what is your will today
[33:24] to let this fear of god dominate us or
[33:26] not dominate but to lead us that we're
[33:28] always like jesus i do nothing except my
[33:32] father my father shows me
[33:36] it was quite an experience and i thank
[33:37] god for it but i just wanted to say when
[33:39] you hit that electricity when you hit
[33:41] that presence everything changes and
[33:44] next time i preach i won't have time
[33:46] today but then i want to go into my life
[33:47] after and show you this reverence for
[33:50] the word this reverence for the message
[33:52] and for what the prophet said and what
[33:54] his ministers say it that so affect me
[33:57] later on the lord spoke to me in a
[33:59] service i've commissioned you to preach
[34:01] my word to the people so god showed me
[34:03] what i should do in life but you know
[34:04] what when i approached the word when i
[34:07] approached everything something happened
[34:09] after that incident that if this is
[34:11] god's man
[34:13] this is god's authority through his word
[34:15] i'm going to value it
[34:17] i'm going to respect it
[34:19] now i'll go into details about
[34:23] things that were doctrine that we know
[34:24] are true but other things that brother
[34:25] brown would say with people who dish off
[34:27] and say that was just brother brown's
[34:28] opinion i didn't approach it that way i
[34:30] said
[34:31] god has come down
[34:33] and expressed himself in the authority
[34:35] of this man
[34:38] or the authority in the man
[34:40] and i do not want to dish out or
[34:44] cast aside
[34:45] anything that's being said right now
[34:48] now that doesn't have to be your
[34:50] testimony that's just my testimony from
[34:52] that point on of coming into the
[34:53] presence of the lord that way i just
[34:56] would dare to not i don't want to
[34:58] venture see brother brown says to
[35:00] presume is to venture
[35:02] without
[35:03] authority
[35:05] i don't want to do that
[35:08] so
[35:09] that's that's what he's saying watchmen
[35:11] knee here
[35:12] the missionary was saying some powerful
[35:14] things that we come in context satan's
[35:16] principle has culminated in the systems
[35:18] of denomination
[35:20] satan's principle has culminated in the
[35:22] systems of denomination if you're
[35:23] listening today all due respect to the
[35:25] people christians everywhere we respect
[35:28] you whoever you are but you must know
[35:30] that according to the scripture
[35:32] lucifer's principle of rebellion to the
[35:34] word of god is culminated in the last
[35:36] days in systems of denomination it is a
[35:39] rebellion against the word of god it is
[35:42] to weaken the authority of god's word
[35:44] taking out what you want putting in what
[35:46] you want is satan's principle whoever
[35:49] takes from this book or adds to this
[35:51] book shall have his place taken out of
[35:52] the book of life
[35:54] the authority of god's word is is being
[35:57] taken by denominations but then we live
[35:59] in the world of the children of
[36:02] disobedience it's called the children of
[36:04] disobedience following denominations or
[36:06] following their own will
[36:08] their own will on things can you say man
[36:11] so this is the world we live in and it
[36:13] culminates it culminates in satan's
[36:15] principle of
[36:17] questioning god's word coming against
[36:19] god's word reinterpreting god's word
[36:22] messing with god's word and i just think
[36:25] that we've come to the places of bride
[36:27] let's leave this alone and believe it
[36:29] the way god said it can you say mine and
[36:31] let it do what it's supposed to do
[36:37] is this amen is this okay this morning
[36:39] this is a straightforward message
[36:42] that's the
[36:43] that's that's the end of page one of my
[36:46] notes
[36:46] does anybody want to close now and just
[36:48] leave it at that
[36:51] all right i'll go on i got enough
[36:53] support
[36:59] listen
[37:01] i want to tell the devil this morning
[37:03] i'm not called to be a child of
[37:04] disobedience
[37:06] i'm not called to be one of those
[37:08] children of disobedience whatever
[37:10] happened in heaven with lucifer
[37:12] is now is now being reversed by the
[37:15] people of god
[37:18] whatever happened with lucifer in this
[37:21] hour is being reversed by the children
[37:23] of god the bride of jesus christ we are
[37:25] not the children of disobedience can you
[37:27] say amen
[37:28] brother bradham even said this age is to
[37:30] prove to satan that this eve is not like
[37:33] the first eve
[37:34] where she failed in the word this eve

[38:30] that name there's power in the name of
[38:31] jesus
[38:33] god bless my son gideon
[38:35] who was asked to do the prayer at the
[38:37] sylvania chamber of commerce meeting
[38:39] with all the business leaders there he
[38:41] was asked to say the prayer
[38:42] and he was called ahead of time and said
[38:45] the girl was a little nervous and she
[38:46] said you know what
[38:48] uh could i could i ask maybe if you
[38:51] could not use the name of jesus in your
[38:53] prayer you could just say god and just
[38:56] keep it general we have all the
[38:58] religions there and so gideon was quick
[39:00] to respond you better get someone else
[39:02] to do the prayer because i'm going to
[39:04] use the name of jesus christ
[39:08] amen
[39:09] [Applause]
[39:11] and he did he said okay we'll just come
[39:14] and he went and did the prayer this week
[39:15] this week
[39:17] and he prayed a very long prayer
[39:20] it's what i hear
[39:22] it was
[39:23] right sherry
[39:29] he was milking it man he was
[39:32] taking his opportunity to talk about
[39:34] whatever he needed
[39:38] and do it in jesus name
[39:40] praise be to god hallelujah
[39:42] [Applause]
[39:47] amen
[39:48] [Applause]
[39:50] he was milking that like he melts the
[39:52] song service sometimes and i have to say
[39:54] shut her down boy i gotta preach
[39:59] i'm not called to be a child of
[40:00] disobedience this morning
[40:02] this age is to prove we're not like the
[40:04] other eve we're the second eve can you
[40:06] say man there was a first adam and there
[40:08] was a second adam the second adam was
[40:10] jesus christ and he started the process
[40:12] of reversing the fall in the garden can
[40:14] you say amen but there's if there's a
[40:16] second adam there has to be a second eve
[40:18] i'm that second eve this morning and
[40:20] through me i'm reversing all that
[40:21] rebellion i'm reversing the children of
[40:24] disobedience
[40:25] i'm coming under the authority of god's
[40:27] word if god's word said it i believe it
[40:30] and that settles it
[40:31] i don't need to debate it i don't need
[40:33] to question it can you say amen lord if
[40:35] that's your authority i bring myself
[40:37] underneath that word
[40:41] hallelujah
[40:43] the bride is reversing
[40:46] she is not working and hearing the hiss
[40:48] of the serpent to reason with and debate
[40:50] every word of the prophet
[40:54] you're listening to the hiss of the
[40:55] serpent that talked to eve
[40:58] when you start to
[41:00] reason
[41:01] with things that were said
[41:07] oh my
[41:11] she's not saying
[41:13] the bride's not saying
[41:15] this message is bondage
[41:20] she's not picking and choosing what she
[41:22] wants of the message
[41:24] she is saying
[41:25] i'm a man under authority isn't this
[41:27] what this roman general said i'm a man
[41:29] under authority
[41:31] she's saying i'm a man i'm a woman under
[41:33] authority and i i'm proud to say that
[41:36] i'm a man and a woman that's under the
[41:38] authority of god
[41:40] you see satan so so just so ruined that
[41:43] i'm under the authority of the word of
[41:44] god and and being there i'm a man under
[41:48] authority i've ordered my life
[41:50] underneath that and being there is the
[41:52] best place that i can be living
[41:54] there is no greater love or protection
[41:57] than being under the wings of god's
[42:00] authority that's the way the bride sees
[42:03] it
[42:04] being there
[42:05] living there hands me the authority over
[42:08] satan he knows who has the authority how
[42:11] many know in the bible that satan
[42:13] already knew who had the authority of
[42:15] god even when they walk to the room i
[42:17] taught this to the brothers at the at
[42:18] the men's meeting we don't have to rest
[42:21] keep reestablishing our authority by the
[42:22] scripture if you have it you don't have
[42:24] to say you have it you have it
[42:26] [Applause]
[42:29] i don't have to read all the quotes
[42:30] about authority my authority is a pastor
[42:32] my authority as a husband if you have it
[42:34] you have it and you'll humbly manifest
[42:36] leadership in your life and your
[42:38] children and your wife will follow
[42:40] but if you've got a rebellion privately
[42:42] don't expect them to come willingly
[42:44] under your authority if you're not under
[42:46] authority yourself
[42:50] i'm gonna go there i'm gonna go there
[42:54] don't expect the wife and children and
[42:56] everyone to come under your authority
[42:57] and read all the scriptures about your
[42:59] headship if they know that you don't
[43:02] have something under subjection to god
[43:04] yourself you've got a private sexual
[43:06] problem and you're not overcome it yet
[43:08] don't you dare try to re-establish your
[43:11] authority because you're losing your
[43:13] authority
[43:14] because you're not under the full
[43:16] authority of god
[43:21] that's why families sometimes unravel
[43:22] sometimes that's how families unravel
[43:24] it's just
[43:25] and i said to the brothers at camp in my
[43:27] history
[43:28] as a
[43:30] pastor
[43:31] when couples get into arguments
[43:35] uh married couples
[43:37] which i know none of you ever have that
[43:39] it was just me and my wife
[43:43] when couples get into this
[43:45] through the years not every time but
[43:46] three years it's interesting i see
[43:48] the husband
[43:50] they go right to the word of god and
[43:52] they think they'll solve the problem by
[43:54] going to ephesians and reestablishing
[43:56] who's the head
[43:58] this is the problem in this family
[44:01] is nobody is coming underneath my
[44:03] headship so i'm going to ephesians and
[44:06] i'm going to tell my family that i'm
[44:08] ahead and if everybody will knuckle down
[44:10] and get underneath me it would be the
[44:12] end of all of our family problems
[44:19] and i believe in ephesians and i believe
[44:21] the man
[44:22] is the ruler over the wife
[44:26] that happened after the fall in the
[44:28] garden they were co-equal
[44:29] and then the sin came in sex came in
[44:33] god had to do a different covenant now
[44:35] you read your bible and he places a
[44:37] different covenant to the woman than the
[44:38] man he places it under rulership say why
[44:41] did he do that
[44:42] because now because sets came in and the
[44:45] woman's body now he had to place a
[44:47] protection over that womb
[44:50] he had to put a woman under protection
[44:52] because she reasoned what the word god
[44:54] and failed
[44:56] not too many amens
[44:59] people think he put the woman under
[45:01] whole world rejects that she's not under
[45:03] his authority god put her there
[45:05] but he put her there for a good reason
[45:08] amen
[45:09] not to bring her under bondage
[45:12] he's bringing out these scriptures and
[45:14] i just want to reestablish and i just
[45:16] told the brothers whoever it is a pastor
[45:18] a husband a father
[45:21] an employer
[45:22] if you have authority you never have to
[45:25] come around and just
[45:26] flaunt it
[45:30] i find that if it's the right kind of
[45:31] authority
[45:34] through humility and through the
[45:35] boldness of the spirit to lead his
[45:37] family
[45:38] slowly that family
[45:41] and he's a sanctified man he's living a
[45:43] life
[45:43] that family because it's the image of
[45:45] god
[45:46] this will work
[45:48] if it's done the right way
[45:49] that family comes underneath it
[45:52] terrible situations where the man is
[45:54] not and it's difficult for the woman in
[45:56] some cases it it even makes a separation
[45:59] totally understandable
[46:01] but when it's working the best
[46:04] then you don't have to keep
[46:05] reestablishing your authority
[46:08] one guy said years ago i have to say
[46:10] years ago because you think it's
[46:11] somebody who i'm talking about it's not
[46:13] this is years ago he said if my wife
[46:15] would just
[46:16] clean the house and keep it clean when i
[46:18] get home if she would keep this house
[46:20] clean
[46:22] like this other sister in the church
[46:25] i said oh why did he say that in front
[46:27] of her boy you are messing up right now
[46:31] if she would just keep the house clean
[46:33] like this other sister we wouldn't have
[46:36] any marriage problems
[46:39] and i knew enough back then to know in
[46:41] my young years boy you're way off track
[46:44] he had a problem with my headship as a
[46:46] pastor he had a problem with the
[46:47] headship of the word he had a problem
[46:49] with the headship of the message he's
[46:50] got all that in his life and the wife
[46:52] could sense it
[46:53] and now he's trying to say that if she
[46:55] keeps her house clean all their problems
[46:56] i said i'll tell you right in front of
[46:58] your wife if she kept the house
[47:00] perfectly clean like sister so and so
[47:03] it would not solve your problems
[47:07] you've been lied to that's right
[47:09] there's a bigger
[47:11] fish here
[47:13] there's a bigger elephant in the room
[47:15] that nobody's talking about
[47:17] and i happen to be the guy that has to
[47:19] talk about it
[47:21] become the bad guy
[47:22] sometimes but i'm going to be objective
[47:25] i'm going to use the word of god i'm
[47:26] going to say lord to my desert lord help
[47:27] me to help people i'm not going to
[47:29] emotionally enter into your emotions in
[47:30] a situation
[47:32] i'm not allowed to take sides with you
[47:34] as a pastor
[47:36] but he says to bring the two families
[47:37] together and try to bring harmony back
[47:39] together again not to choose sides but
[47:41] to find the truth and that we forgive
[47:43] one another and that we go on can you
[47:45] say mine but i want to tell us all
[47:47] whatever authority that we hold we hold
[47:49] it not to re-establish it or try to
[47:51] technically enforce it by the word of
[47:54] god if you have it you have it jesus had
[47:57] the authority and never even had to say
[48:00] that he had it
[48:01] [Applause]
[48:02] he walked into the room and devils could
[48:05] recognize that before he said anything
[48:07] devils were already afraid
[48:10] can you say man that's the life that i
[48:12] want to live that i have something i
[48:14] have a substance that when i walk in the
[48:16] room demons are already scattering
[48:20] it's not something that we say we have
[48:22] it's something that we have
[48:25] and it just goes in the flow of it
[48:28] because jesus was asked the question oh
[48:30] i'm so way off my notes here today
[48:34] jesus was asked the question by what
[48:36] first of all
[48:37] there was a scripture that said that i
[48:39] brought up to the brothers and you're
[48:40] getting a residual of the men's meeting
[48:42] a little bit
[48:45] there was a place that they said
[48:47] he speaks different than the scribes
[48:50] when he speaks it has authority in it
[48:54] they're recognizing
[48:56] he's using the same scroll as all of the
[48:59] religious leaders and yet when he speaks
[49:02] it's got authority with it
[49:04] and he didn't even say now guys i'm
[49:05] going to read the scripture here i want
[49:06] to let you know i'm different than the
[49:07] pharisees and sadducees when i speak
[49:09] i've got authority
[49:12] never said it they recognized it when he
[49:14] uses the bible it's different
[49:16] when he speaks out of this scroll
[49:18] there's an authority with it but then
[49:20] when the pharisees started to hear this
[49:21] stuff from the jews they went to jesus
[49:23] said by what authority do you say these
[49:26] things
[49:29] questioning his authority you know why
[49:30] they questioned it because they didn't
[49:32] they didn't see his authority
[49:35] the other jews seen it he didn't see so
[49:37] by what authority do you think who gave
[49:40] you this authority so jesus
[49:43] he answered and said well i'll tell you
[49:44] where my authority comes from he didn't
[49:46] answer the question
[49:48] you don't have to
[49:50] he didn't answer he said
[49:54] all right i'll answer your question if
[49:56] you answer mine
[49:59] did the did john's message come from god
[50:01] or did it come from men
[50:07] that's a weighted question
[50:10] and so they're pondering i wish the
[50:12] scripture said how long they took to
[50:14] talk amongst themselves but they talked
[50:16] and they said we can't answer that
[50:20] because if we answer this way
[50:22] we're in a certain group if we answer
[50:23] that way we're in a certain group look
[50:25] what the question is you know what the
[50:26] question is
[50:28] about authority
[50:31] it's about authority
[50:32] if you can't never mind me
[50:35] did john come from god
[50:37] or did he come from men did his message
[50:40] to introduce the messiah come from god
[50:42] did it come from men we don't need to
[50:43] debate another moment unless you know
[50:46] did that man was he sent from god i
[50:49] don't mean the man but i mean god did he
[50:51] send the man with the authority to
[50:53] introduce the messiah and until you
[50:55] decide that there's no sense in us
[50:58] having coffee and talking for hours
[51:00] about my authority because you can't
[51:03] even get the authority of the prophet
[51:05] straightened out
[51:07] somebody sent me a few months ago they
[51:09] said here's this brother that's leaving
[51:11] the message and he says he says this is
[51:13] what he says and he called another man
[51:15] he says i just want you to you know i'm
[51:17] just looking at these things and i want
[51:18] you to watch a video of this other guy
[51:20] who had already left the message years
[51:22] ago i just want you to watch this video
[51:24] and when i heard that he was referring
[51:26] to a man like that i said i don't need
[51:28] to hear any more i do not need to listen
[51:30] to the video i don't need if he's
[51:32] referring to a guy like that he's
[51:33] already out he's already off track
[51:39] amen
[51:42] john
[51:43] was it of god was amen we can't answer
[51:45] it he says neither will i answer your
[51:48] question because why you don't have to
[51:50] establish his authority he has it
[51:57] amen
[52:00] we got an eve here on the earth that's
[52:02] not
[52:04] working and hearing the hiss of the
[52:05] serpent to reason and debate every word
[52:07] she's not saying the message is bonded
[52:09] she's not picking and choosing what she
[52:11] wants of the message
[52:12] she's saying i'm a man under authority
[52:15] and there's the best place that i can
[52:17] live with my family
[52:19] there's no greater love of protection
[52:20] being there hands me the authority over
[52:22] satan he knows who has it and he is
[52:25] afraid when i walk in the room she
[52:28] she the bride is submission and
[52:30] surrender her submission and surrender
[52:32] is a glorious place to live for her you
[52:35] may not have heard these things in a
[52:36] while or may never heard them but the
[52:38] bride the second eve is saying with her
[52:40] life submission in surrender is the most
[52:44] glorious place to live
[52:49] because she's learned that
[52:53] is anybody learning something this
[52:55] morning
[52:59] so i just want to spend a little more
[53:00] time before we bring this down
[53:02] about this roman centurion there's so
[53:05] much here
[53:06] and it took me so so long to get there
[53:09] i think that's the end of page two
[53:13] this gentile man was under caesar
[53:16] and
[53:19] this roman centurion seen something in
[53:22] jesus that most the jews didn't see
[53:25] two things
[53:26] this man
[53:27] has the authority of god
[53:30] and this man
[53:31] is under the authority of god
[53:34] he's seen
[53:35] that you can't have it without being
[53:37] under it you say well he's seen god he
[53:39] had authority of god in him he didn't
[53:41] just see that he's seen the whole
[53:43] picture he's he watched this man and
[53:45] he's seen that he was a man under the
[53:47] authority he's seen the humility he's
[53:49] seen the submission to god he's seen
[53:51] that but then he said that's a man that
[53:54] can have have authority because he's
[53:56] under authority
[53:58] and a roman centurion seen that without
[54:01] even any new birth over that and he's
[54:04] seen what the jews couldn't see
[54:07] an entire nation is missing the
[54:09] authority coming to the earth and he
[54:11] sees it as a roman centurion and and
[54:13] he's seen that you can't have it without
[54:15] being under it god's first begotten son
[54:18] jesus christ was given all authority how
[54:21] many of you believe that jesus was all
[54:24] the authority all the power of god was
[54:26] poured into that vessel there how many
[54:27] believe that
[54:28] that's the mystery of god all authority
[54:30] was poured into a son
[54:32] his only begotten son and he's standing
[54:34] there with all the authority of god but
[54:37] it's because this begotten son was under
[54:40] complete submission in his life to hold
[54:42] that authority we should we we never
[54:45] should approach anything to life unless
[54:48] we seek
[54:50] who is in charge
[54:52] to submit to that can you say amen
[54:56] that's the one the subject i want to get
[54:58] into i want to talk about is that just i
[55:00] hope i can get to that this morning is
[55:02] it's about our lives i'm giving a lot of
[55:04] examples from the scripture here
[55:06] but the ultimate ending to this this
[55:08] morning
[55:09] is that the best thing that we can do is
[55:11] seek out
[55:14] where god has placed his power and
[55:16] authority through his word to find it
[55:18] and many of you have found it but to
[55:20] bring and order our families and lives
[55:22] underneath that
[55:26] this roman centurion he's he's even
[55:29] coming under submission can you say man
[55:32] what he's seen
[55:33] jesus what he's seen
[55:35] in this whole authority jesus said he
[55:38] couldn't even find this kind of faith in
[55:40] the whole jewish group yet this man
[55:43] just
[55:43] just
[55:44] it was
[55:45] he caught something that was so advanced
[55:49] in something that the religious people
[55:51] didn't even see it and that's why i want
[55:53] to say
[55:54] it's about who's carrying
[55:56] god's authority this man recognized
[55:58] who's carrying god's authority
[56:00] and the reason that he was interested in
[56:02] it he said because i have a need at home
[56:06] and the doctors can't help this this
[56:08] servant with palsy
[56:10] all the doctors have shut them out i
[56:11] need i have a need in my home anybody
[56:14] this morning have a need in your home i
[56:16] have a need in my home and not a jew but
[56:19] a roman centurion caught one thing this
[56:22] is where god has placed his authority
[56:24] and i know that if i will believe just
[56:27] his
[56:28] word this man has the authority to
[56:31] rebuke the demon off of this palsy and
[56:34] my home can receive healing
[56:37] you're seeking healing this morning
[56:39] you're seeking physical healing you're
[56:40] seeing healing in marriages you're
[56:42] seeking healing in your home whatever it
[56:44] is healing in a marriage the best thing
[56:46] you can do is find the true presence and
[56:49] authority of god bring your life
[56:50] underneath it because in that word
[56:52] there'll be authority to drive away
[56:54] demons
[56:56] you have to put on a show
[56:58] it's in there
[57:00] it's in the word did anybody ever notice
[57:02] that the roman centurion humbly said
[57:04] jesus said i'm going to come to your
[57:05] house right now and he said no no no no
[57:08] notice this revelation
[57:10] it wasn't about the man the physical man
[57:13] coming to his home it was about the word
[57:16] that had authority at it
[57:18] he said i i'm unworthy for you to step
[57:20] into my house but if you say the word
[57:23] you have god's authority and when you
[57:25] speak it
[57:27] i believe my servant will be healed
[57:31] this guy is is teeter-tottering or he's
[57:33] he's he's branching into the faith of
[57:35] the third pole
[57:38] i said this roman centurion
[57:41] is is touching upon the faith of the
[57:44] third pole which this bride should know
[57:48] that's why jesus said all of israel all
[57:49] the religious people
[57:50] they believe in miracles and remember
[57:52] they had to have jesus come and touch
[57:54] them they're about touched lay hands on
[57:55] the sick though that's all that came but
[57:57] he's he's raised the level of faith no
[57:59] no this is in the word and if he speaks
[58:01] the word
[58:02] there's authority in the word to get the
[58:04] job done that's third ball
[58:07] that's where the bride needs to be
[58:09] and a roman centurion is catching it way
[58:11] early on there and he just basically
[58:13] said now wait a minute i'm a man under
[58:15] caesar's authority i have 100 men under
[58:17] me and i'm exercising his authority
[58:19] because i'm under caesar he wouldn't
[58:21] dare come out from underneath caesar's
[58:22] authority see that was a dictatorship
[58:25] and it probably was a little bit of
[58:26] scared fear
[58:28] whatever because that's man's authority
[58:30] right but even that the principle worked
[58:32] because caesar said you're in charge of
[58:34] these hundred men he said whatever i say
[58:36] to these men go here do that do that do
[58:38] that they got to do it
[58:40] because i'm holding authority here
[58:41] because i'm under authority he said if
[58:43] that's working for me i have found the
[58:45] man that god has poured all of his
[58:47] authority into
[58:49] and i got a need at home
[58:51] i got a need
[58:53] god is here
[58:55] i found god's authority through the word
[58:58] and i don't need to have a big feeling i
[59:00] don't need to have a big revival i don't
[59:03] need to do i don't even have to have
[59:04] jesus come to my own personally i humbly
[59:07] say i don't need to in this man is the
[59:09] word of authority
[59:11] blessed be his name
[59:13] praise be to god
[59:15] if some of us can only recognize what
[59:18] god has spoke through his prophet in
[59:20] this hour and through his fightful
[59:22] ministry and through vessels of the
[59:24] bride of jesus christ if you can only
[59:27] know his authority is in that word
[59:38] i don't need to have
[59:39] jesus come to my home
[59:41] and that's fine if you do that get a
[59:43] gospel minister
[59:45] when dear sister here had me come and
[59:47] pray
[59:48] felt like there was demons in the home
[59:50] you should do that
[59:51] bring on that's fine
[59:55] brother boaz has me pray over every new
[59:57] car that he gets
[59:59] that it's blessed
[1:00:00] for the kingdom of god
[1:00:03] i think that's wonderful
[1:00:05] but there's power in the word that's
[1:00:07] spoken of a prophet
[1:00:08] and if you get hung up on the man
[1:00:11] which is what all
[1:00:12] the influences on the internet and those
[1:00:14] defectors
[1:00:15] they're hung up on the man
[1:00:18] and they don't understand one thing
[1:00:21] so jesus said is he from god or is he
[1:00:23] not
[1:00:26] did god send him or didn't send him
[1:00:28] don't get hung up on the man because
[1:00:30] it's not about the man if it was about
[1:00:32] the man then we would need brother
[1:00:33] branham here to take care of our
[1:00:35] problems we would need him to come and
[1:00:38] visit our home which i would love that
[1:00:39] i'd respectfully say i'd love for him to
[1:00:41] be here i certainly wouldn't be
[1:00:42] preaching if he was here this morning
[1:00:45] defer it can you say amen but he's not
[1:00:47] here he's finished his course but god
[1:00:49] didn't leave god's authority didn't
[1:00:51] leave god's authority is still here the
[1:00:53] authority in his word we heard it last
[1:00:54] weekend with brother diggs can you say
[1:00:56] he even said i don't want a blessing i
[1:00:57] don't want just a blessing from god but
[1:00:59] i want to exercise what god has given me
[1:01:01] as a son
[1:01:05] is this okay with everybody
[1:01:08] amen
[1:01:09] so jesus
[1:01:11] so so here
[1:01:12] it's the word that's that's who can
[1:01:14] bring healing to my home here he's tap
[1:01:17] tape he's going into the third pole
[1:01:18] faith this shows us there can be a whole
[1:01:21] group around the son of man ministry and
[1:01:23] worshipping but worshiping according to
[1:01:26] their own will
[1:01:29] because they don't see the authority of
[1:01:30] this
[1:01:35] in fact this was the final conclusion of
[1:01:38] the jews
[1:01:40] you know this is the conclusion of the
[1:01:41] jews when it was all over
[1:01:43] we will not have this man rule over us
[1:01:48] so it's about authority
[1:01:50] is about subjection and most of them
[1:01:52] decided we will not have this man
[1:01:55] see that's the problem
[1:01:58] when you're looking at the man
[1:01:59] you're not seeing it right
[1:02:02] it wasn't about the man jesus
[1:02:04] is about god the god in him
[1:02:07] we will not have this man
[1:02:10] rule over it that's a pretty straight
[1:02:12] statement
[1:02:14] they chose but they didn't see it was
[1:02:17] not the man it was the authority he held
[1:02:20] the roman centurion seen it
[1:02:22] there may be a lot of people
[1:02:25] who follow even this message
[1:02:28] but i'm going to say there's a small few
[1:02:31] that catch the authority of this word
[1:02:34] and to have the fear of god
[1:02:36] to get under it with them in their
[1:02:38] family
[1:02:39] there's very few
[1:02:41] if there's few in jesus day there's few
[1:02:42] today
[1:02:45] roman centurion under something that
[1:02:47] every one of us need to understand
[1:02:50] so we learn from this roman
[1:02:53] his word carried an authority authority
[1:02:55] with it
[1:02:58] that means if the man is not there his
[1:03:00] authority would continue in the word it
[1:03:02] has an effect into the future
[1:03:04] that word when it's believed this way
[1:03:05] went back into his home and brought
[1:03:07] healing to his home even though jesus
[1:03:09] wasn't there it brought healing to this
[1:03:11] man in that very same hour the roman do
[1:03:14] you think god can meet needs in your
[1:03:15] life right now even by the word that's
[1:03:17] being spoken god can already be sent and
[1:03:20] rushing towards a need that's in your
[1:03:21] home in your life right now how many
[1:03:23] believe that
[1:03:25] because the word has power in it can you
[1:03:27] say man
[1:03:28] you can go get that lost loved one those
[1:03:30] lost children he can be working and you
[1:03:32] don't even see it
[1:03:33] bring your life under the authority of
[1:03:35] the word in humility and say god i know
[1:03:37] this is word this word is powerful
[1:03:39] enough from my home
[1:03:42] it already went out when jesus said your
[1:03:44] servant will be healed already by the
[1:03:46] time the roman got home he was already
[1:03:48] healed in that hour
[1:03:50] the authority and the word of god the
[1:03:51] roman didn't get huh up on the man he
[1:03:54] was needing he was respecting the
[1:03:55] authority in god god blessed his home
[1:03:57] for it the roman found that the man was
[1:03:59] god's authority what he did he submitted
[1:04:02] and he asked him to speak the word and
[1:04:04] he carried
[1:04:05] he carried god's jesus carried god's
[1:04:08] name he had power in that name
[1:04:11] and the bride is carrying the name of
[1:04:14] god as well it's not just we say the
[1:04:16] verbal words jesus christ the lord jesus
[1:04:18] christ we know we say that we speak it
[1:04:19] on our lips but it's not just the verbal
[1:04:21] words
[1:04:23] there's many people without the holy
[1:04:25] ghost and without the character of
[1:04:26] christ speak in the name of jesus and
[1:04:28] doing things in the name of jesus it's
[1:04:29] not just the words it's you have his
[1:04:32] name
[1:04:35] we all need to seek out god's authority
[1:04:37] those who have not found it for this
[1:04:39] hour if you're listening on the internet
[1:04:41] i know there's several who listen god
[1:04:42] bless you
[1:04:44] even
[1:04:45] who maybe have different beliefs
[1:04:47] i'm privileged that you would listen in
[1:04:48] god bless you
[1:04:51] but
[1:04:52] we all as christians need to seek out
[1:04:54] god's delegated authority for this hour
[1:04:59] and those who have not found it for this
[1:05:01] hour
[1:05:02] because it's not just your bible now
[1:05:04] it's where god places his authority
[1:05:08] to speak these things
[1:05:10] and i'm going to give you instruction
[1:05:12] if you live in this hour the first place
[1:05:14] you go to
[1:05:16] first place is malachi 4 5 and 6.
[1:05:19] if you're wanting to know
[1:05:21] you're going to go to malachi 4 5 and 6
[1:05:23] and you're going to see a prophecy that
[1:05:25] elijah will come at the end time and
[1:05:27] he'll restore all things that's pretty
[1:05:28] powerful
[1:05:30] don't get hung up on the man
[1:05:32] but if you come and meet with me i can
[1:05:34] tell you there's enough vindication to
[1:05:36] show there's a man that came with the
[1:05:37] spirit of elijah
[1:05:39] and so now we're starting to talk about
[1:05:41] where god delegates and gives his
[1:05:43] authority for this hour
[1:05:45] that's where you start
[1:05:46] but you don't end there
[1:05:48] can you say amen
[1:05:50] you say what did jesus say jesus said in
[1:05:52] matthew 11. he said elijah will come and
[1:05:55] restore all things malachi said it
[1:05:58] matthew 11 said it
[1:06:00] revelations 10 7 says it
[1:06:02] so if you're seeking
[1:06:04] what god is doing in this hour you're
[1:06:06] going to have to start there but then
[1:06:07] you have to you can't stay there because
[1:06:09] you realize god's still got his
[1:06:11] delegated authority on earth
[1:06:14] amen
[1:06:16] and
[1:06:21] you see this word has authority in it
[1:06:22] when it's received right let me just
[1:06:24] quickly go to this so i can end on this
[1:06:26] it's not bad it's only one o'clock
[1:06:35] when you're seeking out and you find
[1:06:38] god's authority like the roman he found
[1:06:39] god's authority and he come under god's
[1:06:42] authority
[1:06:43] you don't come to my home i'm unworthy
[1:06:45] of that but i submit to your word
[1:06:47] whatever you say i submit to it and i
[1:06:50] believe it will be done he found god's
[1:06:52] authority for the hour
[1:06:54] and he brought his life under subjection
[1:06:56] to it friends if you don't get anything
[1:06:58] else here
[1:06:59] just get that this morning
[1:07:01] find it
[1:07:03] if you haven't found it yet find it
[1:07:04] bring your lives under it
[1:07:07] bring your families under it
[1:07:10] there's way too many testimonies i can
[1:07:12] tell of families that just simply said i
[1:07:15] don't know what's going on but i just
[1:07:16] bring my life under subjection
[1:07:18] to the word of god
[1:07:20] and all of a sudden the healing
[1:07:22] began
[1:07:24] see when everybody's fighting for their
[1:07:26] own will and fighting for their own
[1:07:27] opinion
[1:07:29] there's not much subjection there
[1:07:31] but when we come under the word
[1:07:34] the authority and the blessings just
[1:07:36] start to flow down
[1:07:38] and we receive the same benefits
[1:07:42] so the word has authority in it we seek
[1:07:44] it out and then when the word is
[1:07:46] received right you got to look at this
[1:07:47] about the roman it has to be received
[1:07:49] right
[1:07:51] pull up uh first thessalonians 2 13
[1:07:53] esther
[1:07:55] first thessalonians 2 13.
[1:08:00] first thessalonians 2 13 for this cause
[1:08:04] also paul said that we thank we god
[1:08:06] without ceasing because
[1:08:09] when ye received the word of god
[1:08:12] which he heard of us
[1:08:14] ye received it not as the word of men
[1:08:20] but as it is in truth
[1:08:23] the word of god
[1:08:26] so stop right there hold it up right
[1:08:27] there
[1:08:29] the power is in how you receive it
[1:08:33] the attitude you receive in it and he's
[1:08:35] saying that his message his message now
[1:08:37] who's paul and who's
[1:08:39] and a lot of people like especially jews
[1:08:41] said what authority does he have you
[1:08:43] know what they're even questioning his
[1:08:44] authority and we give him 14 books of
[1:08:46] the new testament he must have had some
[1:08:47] authority
[1:08:50] must have been something about it but
[1:08:52] it's like how did he get all that and he
[1:08:54] said well he's just building up himself
[1:08:55] he's pointing himself no no no it was
[1:08:57] the people the elect that received it
[1:09:00] this way
[1:09:03] he said ye have received the word of god
[1:09:05] which he heard of us he received it not
[1:09:07] as the word of men
[1:09:09] they didn't stumble at the man
[1:09:11] they didn't say paul it came from man
[1:09:14] paul had his weaknesses paul had his
[1:09:16] problems can you say amen but he didn't
[1:09:19] they didn't receive it so the power is
[1:09:20] how you receive it but as it was in
[1:09:22] truth the word of god you received it as
[1:09:25] the word and the authority of god which
[1:09:28] effectually worketh also in you that
[1:09:31] believe guess what when you see it right
[1:09:35] and you receive it right you get the
[1:09:37] full benefit of the power affectionately
[1:09:39] working in your life
[1:09:42] everything in that authority starts to
[1:09:43] flow into your life
[1:09:46] and it becomes effective can you say
[1:09:48] that can i get one more scripture
[1:09:51] it's in uh
[1:09:52] uh
[1:09:54] okay i'm skipping down here it's in uh
[1:09:56] matthew chapter 10
[1:09:58] matthew chapter 10
[1:10:00] and then i promise we'll bring this a
[1:10:02] losing son of ya
[1:10:05] [Applause]
[1:10:08] amen all right i can tell that's
[1:10:10] irritating to everybody it's not working
[1:10:12] it's just an irritation
[1:10:13] matthew chapter 10 oh look at this now
[1:10:16] verse if you would as a verse
[1:10:19] uh
[1:10:22] 34 we'll start at verse 34. matthew 10
[1:10:24] verse 34. look at this now we'll wrap it
[1:10:26] up with this
[1:10:28] pick it up again next week or whenever
[1:10:30] think not that i it's jesus speaking
[1:10:32] think not that i'm come to send peace on
[1:10:34] earth i came not to send peace but a
[1:10:36] sword now these scriptures that it
[1:10:39] seemed like the conflicts because we
[1:10:40] know the lord is the lord of peace and
[1:10:42] he come to he's the prince of peace and
[1:10:43] he's come to bring priests on earth and
[1:10:45] good will towards men and all of that at
[1:10:47] christmas time
[1:10:51] right
[1:10:52] let there be peace on earth and let it
[1:10:55] be all right
[1:10:57] that was my special this morning
[1:10:59] but he's you we have to understand this
[1:11:02] because this it seems like it counter
[1:11:04] dicks i'm not come
[1:11:06] to send peace on there i came to not to
[1:11:08] send peace but a sword
[1:11:11] nick we better read the next verse
[1:11:13] for i am come to set a man at variance
[1:11:16] against his father
[1:11:17] and the daughter against her mother
[1:11:20] and the daughter-in-law against her
[1:11:23] mother-in-law
[1:11:25] and a man's foes shall be they of his
[1:11:28] own household stop right there
[1:11:30] now we've got to understand this because
[1:11:31] this just don't seem to fit i'm here
[1:11:33] preaching this morning about healing for
[1:11:34] the families and jesus is saying i come
[1:11:36] to set everybody at variance in the
[1:11:38] family
[1:11:40] but you have to understand
[1:11:43] it's about your life
[1:11:44] and what you're under subjection to
[1:11:48] and if you're not under subjection
[1:11:50] solely first to the word and the
[1:11:53] authority of the word
[1:11:54] then you will have
[1:11:56] you will have conflict
[1:11:58] because the emotions in a family will
[1:12:00] get involved
[1:12:02] and you'll choose a life based upon your
[1:12:04] own will or your family's will
[1:12:06] and this word will always direct you
[1:12:09] to a full surrender to the lord
[1:12:14] he says there's going to be conflict
[1:12:17] there's not going to be peace sometimes
[1:12:18] not peace like you want i wish we'd all
[1:12:20] just get along but it's not going to be
[1:12:22] because someone's not taking their lives
[1:12:24] and how we know this is we go to the
[1:12:25] next scripture
[1:12:27] he that loveth father mother more than
[1:12:29] oh now we get it he that loveth father
[1:12:31] more than me is not worthy of me and he
[1:12:33] that loveth son or daughter more than me
[1:12:35] is not worthy now we understand it's
[1:12:37] about priority it's about who's first
[1:12:40] it's about who's the principal theme in
[1:12:42] your life christ the mystery of god
[1:12:44] revealed he said jesus is the principal
[1:12:46] theme of every scripture
[1:12:49] if you didn't find christ in it go read
[1:12:50] it again he's the principle theme and
[1:12:52] brother brahm says if he's the principle
[1:12:54] theme of the entire bible he should be
[1:12:56] the principle theme of our lives he
[1:12:58] should be the principle theme of our
[1:13:00] thinking he should be the principal
[1:13:01] theme of our decisions
[1:13:04] the word
[1:13:05] using the authority of the word for
[1:13:06] every decision in life not emotion not
[1:13:09] family
[1:13:10] he's first
[1:13:13] he that taketh not his cross and
[1:13:14] followed after me is not worthy of me
[1:13:17] next one he that findeth his life shall
[1:13:19] lose and he that loses his life for my
[1:13:21] sake shall find it so listen stop right
[1:13:23] there he that finds his life in other
[1:13:25] words somebody's grabbing onto their
[1:13:26] life it's my life i want to do what i
[1:13:28] want i do what i want there's no
[1:13:30] submission there's no surrender there to
[1:13:31] the word of god and the authority of
[1:13:32] christ and he that loses his life but he
[1:13:35] that loseth his life for my sake shall
[1:13:37] find it so here's the channel if you say
[1:13:39] no my life is not my own
[1:13:43] i said my life
[1:13:45] are you micromanaging your life and
[1:13:47] you're micromanaging god i'm only going
[1:13:48] to have god in this certain part of my
[1:13:50] life i control my life you go right
[1:13:52] ahead but this path this path says i'm
[1:13:55] losing my life for the gospel's sake for
[1:13:58] the word's sake
[1:14:00] it's surrender it's submission
[1:14:03] but it's the right kind
[1:14:06] because there's huge blessings that
[1:14:07] follow him
[1:14:10] he defined his life shall lose it he
[1:14:11] that he that re now here's how we get
[1:14:13] into it now next one he that receiveth
[1:14:15] you receiveth me and he that receiveth
[1:14:17] me receiveth him that sent me
[1:14:20] and he oh
[1:14:22] it's about receiving it's how you're
[1:14:23] receiving look at this look at this
[1:14:26] he that receiveth a prophet
[1:14:28] in the name of a prophet shall receive a
[1:14:31] prophet's reward
[1:14:34] that's not everybody on the face of the
[1:14:35] earth because not everybody accepts
[1:14:37] god's prophets
[1:14:39] i don't need that man in my life i don't
[1:14:40] need that man to rule over who's he
[1:14:42] that's just a cultist thing
[1:14:44] but there's some that receive it right
[1:14:46] yes
[1:14:47] this is god's man and it's not about the
[1:14:49] man it's where god places authority i
[1:14:51] bring my life on our net and he that
[1:14:52] receiveth the prophet in the name of a
[1:14:54] prophet shall receive a prophet's reward
[1:14:57] everything that's there god doesn't keep
[1:14:59] back from you brother christian
[1:15:01] everything that's in there it flows
[1:15:04] right down to you
[1:15:06] even the rewards of a prophet
[1:15:09] flows down to your life
[1:15:11] i tell you that's the life that i want
[1:15:13] on this earth
[1:15:15] let me lose my life and find it in the
[1:15:17] lord
[1:15:18] let me never say it's my life i can do
[1:15:20] what i want and pick and choose out of
[1:15:22] the message god help me to die out to
[1:15:24] that say my life is not my own my life
[1:15:27] is not my own i bring it under the
[1:15:29] subjection of the word of god
[1:15:32] because he that receives a prophet isn't
[1:15:34] it interesting now let me finish and and
[1:15:37] and he that receiveth a righteous man so
[1:15:40] it's not just the prophet
[1:15:44] it's not just the prophet that we come
[1:15:47] under
[1:15:47] subjection to the authority of god sin
[1:15:50] but there's been after the prophet isn't
[1:15:52] there
[1:15:54] he that receives a righteous man in the
[1:15:55] name of righteousness shall receive a
[1:15:56] righteous man's a word this is not
[1:15:58] something that
[1:16:00] you submit yourself
[1:16:02] and then you're just a puppet and you
[1:16:03] don't get nothing and you just submit
[1:16:05] the rest of your life no it's not how
[1:16:07] this authority works this authority
[1:16:09] works that when you come under
[1:16:11] subjection like jesus did to the father
[1:16:14] now he starts to pour in everything
[1:16:17] that's of god into your life
[1:16:20] so let me ask this question if he's
[1:16:22] talking about our life
[1:16:23] and somebody says
[1:16:25] i'm retaining my life i'm not going to
[1:16:27] submit to the gospel the word
[1:16:30] and somebody says that
[1:16:31] and he's talking about our life and the
[1:16:32] one who says i'll lose my life for the
[1:16:35] gospel sake and he decides i'm giving up
[1:16:37] my my life is yours my life is my
[1:16:39] remember that song we'll sing that right
[1:16:41] now
[1:16:41] my life is in your hands however that
[1:16:43] goes i don't know all these new courses
[1:16:46] that's why we have gideon and all these
[1:16:47] guys
[1:16:48] my life is if someone does this
[1:16:51] he's talking listen friends he's talking
[1:16:56] amen
[1:16:58] hello
[1:17:00] give me two minutes and i'm done
[1:17:04] when he says lose your life or find it
[1:17:06] he's talking about your life right now
[1:17:10] who's in control of it
[1:17:12] who's micromanaging it
[1:17:15] i do what i want
[1:17:17] is it i do what i want i wear what i
[1:17:19] want i say what i want to all the
[1:17:21] employees that work on monday
[1:17:26] is it your life
[1:17:29] or is it his life
[1:17:31] okay so he's talking about your life
[1:17:33] right now your life
[1:17:36] and isn't it interesting the two
[1:17:38] scriptures later
[1:17:39] and he's talking about your life and
[1:17:41] he's talking about where to bring your
[1:17:43] life under and he brings up
[1:17:45] a prophet
[1:17:47] and a righteous man
[1:17:49] now if he didn't bring those up those
[1:17:51] things wouldn't be related
[1:17:53] to your life
[1:17:55] but in god's kingdom
[1:17:57] those vessels
[1:17:59] are very important to your life
[1:18:05] if he just said your bible
[1:18:09] he that receives the bible will see
[1:18:11] receive the bible's reward he didn't say
[1:18:13] that
[1:18:14] he that has all the message books in his
[1:18:17] closet
[1:18:18] or on his shelf will receive a reward
[1:18:20] just for that
[1:18:23] he that's early to church on time will
[1:18:25] get a sticker
[1:18:33] he that we have a bonus point program in
[1:18:36] this church and you receive certain
[1:18:37] bonus points if you scan your card we
[1:18:40] don't have that here
[1:18:47] your life
[1:18:50] is when it's connected
[1:18:52] to the word and the authority of the
[1:18:54] word in a prophet
[1:18:55] and righteous men
[1:18:57] that's god's link
[1:19:00] to be the test
[1:19:02] if your life
[1:19:03] is being lost in him
[1:19:06] or if it's being held onto otherwise he
[1:19:08] would have said your bible or anything
[1:19:09] but he said it he says a prophet and he
[1:19:12] says a righteous man
[1:19:14] my personal belief is god delegates his
[1:19:16] authority
[1:19:17] we don't like the people he delegates it
[1:19:19] to sometimes
[1:19:21] we question the man but i want to get
[1:19:23] into more in this series
[1:19:25] it's not about the man
[1:19:26] it's about what god placed him into and
[1:19:28] god will respect you when you respect
[1:19:30] the authority that's in the man this
[1:19:32] isn't a series to establish my authority
[1:19:33] i'm not done by pastors authority i'm
[1:19:35] talking about something that's a
[1:19:37] blessing for your life
[1:19:39] your life being blessed and receiving a
[1:19:41] reward is linked to god's prophets and
[1:19:45] righteous men that have god's authority
[1:19:48] isn't he is interesting he says a
[1:19:50] righteous man because that man just
[1:19:52] can't be living some sinful life and you
[1:19:54] have trust in him
[1:19:55] has to be a righteous man that you have
[1:19:57] confidence in he's in a righteous holy
[1:19:59] life then you could if god's put his
[1:20:00] authority you can trust that man to give
[1:20:02] you a word of the lord bring your life
[1:20:04] under it your home will be blessed your
[1:20:06] children will be blessed your
[1:20:08] grandchildren will be blessed
[1:20:10] healing begins to begins to work for
[1:20:13] marriages
[1:20:15] for families
[1:20:16] for attitudes
[1:20:19] for
[1:20:20] disrespect that you keep holding on to
[1:20:22] maybe you keep saying things you
[1:20:24] shouldn't say
[1:20:25] years of this stuff
[1:20:28] and just get under the word say lord let
[1:20:29] the word begin to do its work in my
[1:20:31] children and in me
[1:20:33] let it do its work
[1:20:34] because god looks and says
[1:20:36] their life is their life is under
[1:20:38] subjection to the word
[1:20:40] humbly
[1:20:41] and now i'll pour
[1:20:43] everything they're asking for i'll pour
[1:20:45] it into them and pour it into their
[1:20:47] children
[1:20:48] pour it into their family
[1:20:50] you know i can preach this friends i'm
[1:20:52] closing come on musicians
[1:20:53] i can preach this because
[1:20:56] i'm not perfect and i haven't always
[1:20:58] been as under authority as i wanted to
[1:21:01] be
[1:21:02] but i caught the principle early on
[1:21:04] and me and my wife seek i just told
[1:21:06] brother
[1:21:08] george or someone there the other day
[1:21:10] every major decision that we make in our
[1:21:12] lives we're making some now with
[1:21:15] business and different things
[1:21:17] we call somebody
[1:21:20] i remember i told a brother yesterday i
[1:21:21] said i said major decisions i believe in
[1:21:25] accountability
[1:21:27] accountability
[1:21:29] i don't do it as an alone i don't
[1:21:31] exercise my authority alone i say
[1:21:34] get a brother in christ you go we used
[1:21:35] to call brother cop he's passed away now
[1:21:38] major financial decisions we make in our
[1:21:39] life so what do you think of this here's
[1:21:41] the picture what do you think of it
[1:21:42] because i'm not afraid of counsel
[1:21:45] and when it comes to big decisions
[1:21:48] i don't want to just read my bible i
[1:21:49] want god with skin on
[1:21:52] i need god and if you're not going to go
[1:21:54] to somebody if you don't believe that
[1:21:55] god has skin on
[1:21:57] but if you know that god can speak
[1:21:59] through his body
[1:22:00] and god can speak through a righteous
[1:22:02] man you submit yourself to it say give
[1:22:05] me let me know what you think
[1:22:07] this relationship with this guy or girl
[1:22:10] give me i'm not afraid of anything tell
[1:22:11] me what you think tell me your gut
[1:22:13] feeling
[1:22:14] you're not afraid of it
[1:22:16] that's the type of people that jesus
[1:22:18] looks and says
[1:22:20] you know what
[1:22:21] just like
[1:22:23] jesus said i have not found so great of
[1:22:25] faith not in israel
[1:22:27] this man's going to get healing in his
[1:22:28] home because he understands
[1:22:31] it's not about me the pharisees are
[1:22:33] stumbling at my flesh
[1:22:35] it's always been the skin test
[1:22:37] in every age
[1:22:39] it's not been people rejecting god
[1:22:41] it's rejecting the skin he comes in
[1:22:44] it's always the skin test
[1:22:49] and you may not like the skin that's
[1:22:50] preached to you this morning
[1:22:54] but i love you anyway
[1:22:59] what was the song we were going to sing
[1:23:02] knife is in your hands
[1:23:08] let's stand and lay our hands on one
[1:23:09] another and pray
[1:23:12] thank you for your attendance thank you
[1:23:13] for your attention
[1:23:16] you have a life here this morning
[1:23:18] i'm not in control of that life no man
[1:23:20] should be
[1:23:21] but the authority of god
[1:23:23] you should put that
[1:23:25] you should bring your life completely
[1:23:26] underneath the authority of the word of
[1:23:28] god
[1:23:30] like watchmenis said we should we should
[1:23:32] want to purge ourselves we should want
[1:23:34] to say any of this principle of satan if
[1:23:36] it's still in us or take that out of me
[1:23:38] may i find the protection underneath the
[1:23:41] very glories of god underneath the wings
[1:23:45] of god how many want to just be how many
[1:23:46] know that under the wings of god is
[1:23:48] protection i want to live under his
[1:23:50] wings
[1:23:51] i don't want to be on top of his wings
[1:23:53] or no protection under his wings
[1:23:55] pray for that brother and sister next to
[1:23:57] you
[1:23:58] heavenly father
[1:23:59] we humbly ask you to make the word live
[1:24:02] to us this morning
[1:24:03] make it live in my heart make it live in
[1:24:05] these dear precious people's hearts and
[1:24:07] lord jesus i know i've been harsh and
[1:24:10] maybe straight this morning and spoken
[1:24:12] boldly but lord i don't mean it in any
[1:24:14] offense i mean it so that people can
[1:24:16] find that place that position lord is so
[1:24:19] blessed of you
[1:24:20] many things to work out many family
[1:24:22] issues and family problems but lord your
[1:24:24] word has authority in it

[1:24:32] leadership to that person lord give them
[1:24:34] guidance lord by the holy spirit maybe
[1:24:37] they have to go with god with skin on
[1:24:39] and talk to another brother or sister in
[1:24:40] the church and get some advice and
[1:24:42] counsel maybe they need to do that
[1:24:44] whatever it is
[1:24:46] but you provide what's needed lord that
[1:24:48] we do not live our lives as islands or
[1:24:51] someone that's just exercising our own
[1:24:53] will but we're submissive to the perfect
[1:24:55] will of god we heard it wednesday night
[1:24:57] brother george saying in his permissive
[1:24:59] will or his perfect will lord we just
[1:25:01] say to you we don't want to be in your
[1:25:03] permissive will we want to live in your
[1:25:05] perfect will may we die out to this
[1:25:08] principle of satan
[1:25:10] this principle of lucifer who undermine
[1:25:13] and begin to question and debate and
[1:25:16] influence others the wrong way
[1:25:18] oh god there ought to be an altar in our
[1:25:20] heart this morning crying out for
[1:25:22] repentance
[1:25:23] forgive me lord for saying things that i
[1:25:25] shouldn't say
