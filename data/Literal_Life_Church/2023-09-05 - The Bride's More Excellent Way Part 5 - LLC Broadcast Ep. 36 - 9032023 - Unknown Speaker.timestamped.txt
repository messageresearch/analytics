[4:43] [Music]
[4:45] Hallelujah Proverbs Chapter 19 and verse
[4:47] 11 I'm just reading this one scripture
[4:50] and we're going to preach off of this
[4:52] this morning in our series the bride's
[4:54] more excellent way and this is Proverbs
[4:57] 19 and verse 11 says the discretion of a
[5:00] man deferreth his anger and it is his
[5:05] glory to pass over a
[5:08] transgression the discretion of a man
[5:11] deferreth his anger and it is his glory
[5:13] to pass over a transgression and I might
[5:16] reword that there are many different
[5:18] translations but I'll just reword it so
[5:20] we might understand it a bit better and
[5:23] that is the discernment of a man the the
[5:25] caution of a man would defer make him
[5:29] not react so quickly in Anger what would
[5:31] defer his anger and it is his glory to
[5:35] cover a multitude of sins there's a
[5:37] glory in that there's a christlikeness
[5:40] in that and that is when you not only
[5:42] forgive but you pass over transgressions
[5:46] this verse in Proverbs 19:1 has just
[5:50] been um intriguing to me the last few
[5:53] days as we've been studying over and um
[5:55] this verse actually in one verse covers
[5:59] both of my new points as we cover them
[6:02] today in the bride's more excellent way
[6:05] just so you know if you haven't been a
[6:07] part of the series that we're out of 1
[6:09] Corinthians 12 the last scripture in 1
[6:11] Corinthians 12 says covet earnestly the
[6:14] best gifts but yet I show unto you a
[6:16] more excellent way and then Paul goes
[6:18] into all the attributes of love divine
[6:22] love in 1 Corinthians 13 and so we've
[6:25] been taking those things little by
[6:26] little and we're going to take two more
[6:28] of those things today
[6:30] what the excellent way is and what
[6:31] divine love is and how that translate in
[6:34] into Holy Ghost love being expressed in
[6:37] this hour from our vessels not just a
[6:40] shallow love but holy ghost Divine love
[6:43] expressed through us you when you
[6:46] project love when Divine love is
[6:48] projected not just I got it but when
[6:50] it's projected and manifested then
[6:53] Sovereign Grace can take over situations
[6:56] that we cannot handle that we cannot do
[6:58] something steps in how many would love
[7:01] it if the Lord would step into
[7:03] situations so when love is projected
[7:05] there's so there's a power that works in
[7:07] love love is the most powerful force in
[7:10] the world I shouldn't say love is
[7:12] because there's a lot of different
[7:13] versions of love that the world is given
[7:15] but Divine love Holy Ghost love is the
[7:18] most powerful force in the world can you
[7:21] say Amen there is nothing greater there
[7:23] is no demon there is no political power
[7:26] there is no government there is nothing
[7:28] more power ful than Divine love there's
[7:31] no church there's no system there's no
[7:33] religion that can be as powerful as
[7:36] Divine love and so this is what we want
[7:39] it to project we want it to project on
[7:41] our lives and so I'm going to cover two
[7:44] two more points of divine love and that
[7:46] is love is not easily provoked to anger
[7:49] number one love is not easily provoked
[7:51] to anger and love does not keep a record
[7:54] of others wrongs so that's the two we'll
[7:57] be looking into today love is not easy
[7:59] eily provoked uh to anger and love does
[8:02] not keep a record of others wrongs so
[8:04] there's just something intriguing about
[8:06] this particular verse and it's amazing
[8:09] that this one verse can say so much uh
[8:13] even about the points that I'm on today
[8:16] uh for and and to look at a man that
[8:19] could come to a place and and in God
[8:22] that it says here there's such wisdom
[8:24] behind this because it says the
[8:25] discretion of a man this isn't some
[8:27] worldly man this is a Godly Man the
[8:30] discretion of a man deferreth his anger
[8:34] and it is his glory to pass over a
[8:38] transgression that is not the glory of
[8:41] the world that is not the way of the
[8:42] world that is not a man of the world
[8:45] this Glory has to be a glory that that
[8:48] has come in that man from go from God
[8:51] because the glory of the world and the
[8:53] way the world is is that we do keep
[8:55] record of wrong we don't cover
[8:58] transgression we remember
[9:00] transgressions we don't defer our anger
[9:03] we usually react in Anger that's the
[9:05] world's way but when the glory of the
[9:07] Lord comes in a man or a woman then it's
[9:09] going to be manifesting more of these
[9:11] things and that is a a deference because
[9:14] of discernment you step back and look
[9:16] and before you react in our number one
[9:19] default thing and that's anger before
[9:21] you react in Anger you defer it with
[9:24] wisdom and with discernment to say now
[9:26] wait a minute what is the what is the
[9:28] whole picture can you say Amen what is
[9:31] going on here before I just just respond
[9:34] in anger and then it is the glory of a
[9:36] man to pass over or to cover over a
[9:40] transgression that's been done to him or
[9:42] any transgression it's the glory I can
[9:45] say safely it's the glory of God to pass
[9:48] over a transgression of somebody else
[9:51] for a man to come into this kind of
[9:54] reaction and the covering another man's
[9:57] sins he would be entering into another
[9:59] Glory than a regular man reacting in
[10:02] anger and Vengeance quickly and keeping
[10:06] tabs on others wrongs is the glory of a
[10:09] worldly
[10:11] man in fact he's praised for
[10:15] it have you ever watched that the men of
[10:19] the world and our stars and our sports
[10:21] stars and our movie stars and the people
[10:24] that are everybody's looking to have you
[10:27] ever noticed how much they get a free
[10:28] pass
[10:29] from manifesting any
[10:32] character because that's the glory of
[10:34] the world so they get free passes all
[10:37] the time they we Overlook that because
[10:39] of their gift because they're good at
[10:40] football or whatever else and they live
[10:42] all kinds of lives and do all kinds of
[10:44] things and yet that that glory is the
[10:46] glory of the world because we're still
[10:48] going to praise them we're still going
[10:49] to glorify them we're still going to
[10:52] build them up as being a mighty
[10:55] Superstar and movie star and singer and
[10:57] all these other things no matter how how
[10:59] they live how much they cuss how much
[11:01] they they evade their taxes how much
[11:05] they the the dirtiness of their life how
[11:07] many marriages they have doesn't matter
[11:09] what they do we will still glory and
[11:11] praise them for their gift this is what
[11:15] the the world glorifies but when the
[11:17] glory of the Lord comes on on a man he
[11:20] doesn't hold grudges he doesn't hold on
[11:22] to the past and he can cover the sin of
[11:25] another can you say Amen the glory of
[11:28] the Lord was upon
[11:29] Adam he was in he was a he was a Son of
[11:33] God and he acts like God and when a Son
[11:37] of God comes into that place of Glory
[11:39] again through Redemption he acts like
[11:41] God and he reacts like
[11:44] God I said he acts like God and he
[11:48] reacts like
[11:49] God and we first begin to see this we SE
[11:53] it a little bit through the Old
[11:54] Testament but we first begin to see that
[11:56] the glory of God had come back in a man
[11:59] that had fallen from Adam because he was
[12:01] in that Glory Now That Glory completely
[12:03] fills the vessel of Jesus Christ and we
[12:06] see a man with the glory of God act like
[12:08] God do Miracles like God do do signs
[12:12] like God can do right in his vessel but
[12:14] it wasn't just that Jesus acted like God
[12:17] In Miracles and signs and wonders he
[12:20] reacted to situations like God would so
[12:24] it's not just that you act like God but
[12:26] that you react to life situation ations
[12:30] like God because it's God living in you
[12:32] so this next point of divine love is
[12:34] love is not easily provoked to anger
[12:37] Ecclesiastes 7:9 says be not Hasty in
[12:40] thy Spirit to be angry for anger resteth
[12:44] in the bosom of
[12:47] fools in this uh version of cab the same
[12:50] scripture says don't be quick to get
[12:53] angry for Only Fools nurse anger so
[12:59] that's that's a further interpretation
[13:01] if you have something in the booom of
[13:03] fool fools it actually goes back to a
[13:05] woman who has a baby in her booom she's
[13:08] going to feed that and nurse that baby
[13:10] and she holds it she protects it she
[13:12] nurses it and do you know that you got
[13:15] somebody nursing like a baby nursing
[13:18] their anger and holding it close to them
[13:20] their whole life no wonder if they're
[13:23] nursing their anger they're coddling
[13:26] their anger they're protecting their
[13:28] anger and they're holding it there
[13:29] instead of doing what Brother Kyle said
[13:31] a few Wednesday night you got to let it
[13:33] go real simple message you just got to
[13:35] let it go you got to let things go but
[13:39] this guy's not letting this go he's
[13:40] actually coddling and holding and
[13:42] nursing his
[13:44] anger holding it close to him for Life
[13:47] he's not letting it go at all don't be
[13:49] quick to angry because if you're nursing
[13:52] only the full nurse's anger and if you
[13:55] if you're quick to anger all that's
[13:57] going to do is keep Fest Ing and keep
[13:59] festering and nurse the anger further it
[14:03] has to come an end to your anger
[14:06] brothers and sisters listen to me we're
[14:09] always going to have the emotion of
[14:10] anger but if you're nursing it for life
[14:13] you'll see destruction in your path and
[14:17] you don't even recognize it because you
[14:19] have old anger and you're nursing it and
[14:22] anybody who tees you off just with one
[14:24] thing it brings back all the past
[14:26] memories and you're quick the reason
[14:28] you're quick to get angry is you're
[14:30] nursing your
[14:36] anger amen James 1 says wherefore my
[14:39] beloved brother let every man be swift
[14:42] to hear we need to be more listeners
[14:45] than
[14:48] talkers be swift to ear be more willing
[14:51] to
[14:52] listen than just react
[14:55] quickly Swift to hear slow slow to
[15:00] speak slow to anger slow to
[15:05] wrath why because the wrath of man not
[15:10] God now because how many knows God has a
[15:11] wrath yes it's a holy wrath but the
[15:14] wrath of man will never work the
[15:18] righteousness of God and that's a good
[15:20] reason not to nurse your anger anymore
[15:22] too it will never produce the
[15:25] righteousness of God there are regular
[15:27] irritations in life that that cause it's
[15:30] not just somebody being angry at you
[15:32] there are things that triggle us trigger
[15:34] us and they make
[15:35] us irritated at something okay and so we
[15:39] of course our our goal and our spirit
[15:42] should say Lord uh I want to get to this
[15:44] place that I'm even the regular
[15:46] irritations in life that we're more
[15:49] patient with it that we're more more
[15:52] restful with it and not to react and I
[15:56] encourage people premarital coun
[15:59] counseling um if you want to go through
[16:01] it with the the leadership here uh
[16:04] before you get married I encourage it
[16:05] and it's it's not ever to discourage
[16:08] somebody falling in love it's so that
[16:10] you research a little bit of your life
[16:12] and your spirit and your heart and the
[16:14] girls and you research it together in a
[16:17] very nice way but you're trying to see
[16:21] if there's any triggers in your life
[16:24] that that may might not realize that
[16:27] they're stepping on something and they
[16:29] irritate it and you have unresolved
[16:31] anger unresolved triggers there because
[16:34] now if you get in marriage and that
[16:36] spouse does not know what your past is
[16:40] then they're going to trigger and step
[16:41] on your pain and there's going to be a
[16:43] reaction and your spouse is going why in
[16:46] the world did you react that extreme
[16:48] because you really didn't lay your
[16:50] triggers and lay your pain before the
[16:53] Lord you didn't really discover it I
[16:56] love for young people to start laying
[16:58] these things before God now what's in me
[17:00] Lord that needs to come out Lord you're
[17:01] not going to get everything but at least
[17:03] you're working at it and the reason the
[17:05] one reason I tell couples to do it is
[17:07] because the devil has less grounds to
[17:09] try to divide your Oneness and your
[17:11] marriage he's got less grounds to be on
[17:13] if you're aware what triggers one
[17:15] another if you're aware of it it's half
[17:17] the half the
[17:18] battle
[17:21] right so there's regular irritations
[17:23] life I mean we we headed we went out for
[17:25] a few days and at the airport on Sunday
[17:28] night it was like there was this couple
[17:31] and they were a Nigerian couple brother
[17:33] Michael and they had their baby with
[17:35] them in a stroller and we're going
[17:37] through security and they're going to
[17:40] Nigeria obviously and I found that out
[17:42] later and I think they had half of their
[17:45] house they were taking with them through
[17:47] the security they had everything with
[17:50] them and the I don't know what they
[17:52] checked in but this was half their house
[17:55] here and the stroller was huge and
[17:58] somehow we got behind them and I realize
[18:01] I'm getting a little irritated because
[18:03] we're running a little late and it's
[18:05] like okay we need to get through
[18:07] security you know even if I'm not
[18:08] running late uh Securities irritate me
[18:11] anyway might as well admit it so anyway
[18:13] this nice couple and they weren't nice
[18:16] at that time because they were they had
[18:18] everything and then the guy the security
[18:20] guard had to get that stroller through
[18:22] the machine they you couldn't just drive
[18:25] it through the scanner it had to fit and
[18:27] they were crunching and I know they
[18:29] spent 20 minutes trying to Crunch this
[18:32] thing down and push it through the
[18:34] machine it's like just drive it through
[18:38] just leave it here buy one in
[18:42] Africa don't take and huge bags and just
[18:45] and stuffing this stuff through that
[18:48] scanner and it took forever and then as
[18:51] I come to the other side and it's taken
[18:53] us about a good over a half hour I would
[18:57] it seemed like
[18:59] I'm reminded of what I was preaching
[19:02] that Sunday Morning by the Lord usually
[19:06] that reminder comes from my wife but
[19:07] this came from the Lord and I wasn't
[19:09] even on this subject yet it's just all
[19:11] this subject of of divine love and I'll
[19:13] tell you I have been tested in my home
[19:16] life domestic life family I have been
[19:19] tested to the very core of Myself by
[19:21] these if this series isn't for anybody
[19:23] else it's for me to look at my life and
[19:27] say Lord I'm I'm struggling but I want
[19:31] this more excellent
[19:33] way I got to have
[19:36] it and so then we come through the other
[19:39] side and I start I said all right
[19:41] because of what I preach this morning
[19:42] I'm going to start talking to this
[19:44] couple asked where they were going going
[19:45] three months Nigeria ah we got Nigerian
[19:47] people in our church and I asked if they
[19:50] knew your names and I was just I I
[19:54] connected I connected and I found them
[19:57] to be the ni nicest couple both of them
[20:00] so nice cute baby I changed my whole
[20:03] attitud towards those people and they
[20:04] were very open they started talk I start
[20:06] to talk about the church and and they
[20:08] live close enough and I got I got the
[20:10] new card out and the people that I was
[20:14] so irritated at I handed him a card and
[20:17] invited him to church he says when we
[20:19] get home we're going to come and
[20:21] visit now if ID have stayed in my former
[20:25] attitude you think they'd come and hear
[20:27] me preach
[20:30] I destroyed it I didn't even get a
[20:32] chance to preach anything to him yet and
[20:35] I destroyed the chanes why why because
[20:38] my first discernment wasn't good of the
[20:40] situation and I was irritated so that's
[20:43] normal irritations but what about what
[20:45] about when what about what this
[20:49] provoking means the Greek word to for
[20:51] provoke means to sharpen to stimulate
[20:55] Rouse to anger that's that provoking
[20:59] pushing another's buttons okay and this
[21:02] is love is not easily easily provoked to
[21:05] anger but that's what it does sharpen
[21:07] stimulate Rous to anger the Phillips
[21:10] Bible paraphrases this love it is not
[21:14] touchy love does not have a hair trigger
[21:18] temper some people make everyone around
[21:21] them walk on eggshell because they're
[21:24] always their feelings are on their
[21:25] shoulders and they don't know how to act
[21:27] because they walk eggshells because
[21:29] because maybe it's you you keep everyone
[21:31] in eggshells because you're you're
[21:33] you're touchy and you're you're just you
[21:36] could blow up at any
[21:39] time it is not touchy love does not have
[21:42] a hair trigger temper some people make
[21:45] everyone around them walk on eggshells
[21:46] they're easily offended one little thing
[21:50] that doesn't go their way and
[21:53] boom they use their temper to intimidate
[21:59] and to
[22:02] punish now there's there's something to
[22:05] preach about they actually use their
[22:08] anger as a weapon to
[22:11] intimidate to push
[22:14] back to punish someone to get back at
[22:17] them and when you confront them many
[22:20] times they say sure I have a bad
[22:23] temper but a lot of people has
[22:26] problems I know I got that temper but
[22:29] you know what at least I just get it all
[22:32] out and it's over in a few
[22:36] minutes you know what that's like that's
[22:39] like a
[22:41] bomb it's like a
[22:44] bomb I just get it out there and you're
[22:46] actually Justified and it's over a few
[22:48] that's a
[22:50] bomb you drop a bomb and it's over in a
[22:53] few minutes but look at the devastation
[22:56] it leaves behind
[23:00] you think it's over you went back to
[23:01] work or you went back to your bedroom
[23:03] and you went back
[23:05] Kaboom
[23:06] explosion it's over I said it I said my
[23:09] piece it's done it's over it's not over
[23:12] because You Dropped a Bomb and look at
[23:14] all the devastation from the bomb when
[23:16] you're angry usually you're not loving
[23:20] one more Point love does not keep a
[23:21] record of others wrongs love does not
[23:24] keep a record of others wrongs and the
[23:28] scripture says love thinketh no evil so
[23:31] it's it's tied to our thinking love does
[23:34] not keep a record of others wrongs it
[23:37] thinketh no evil so it's tied to our
[23:40] thoughts a lot of times we're not
[23:42] keeping a record of others
[23:44] wrongs in a in a log somewhere or in
[23:49] QuickBooks but we're keeping it in our
[23:51] thinking that's why you it think love
[23:54] thinketh no evil because it's this
[23:56] thought process as you look at that
[23:58] person and you've got the log in your
[24:00] mind and so you're looking you're
[24:01] thinking evil thoughts of of them
[24:04] instead
[24:06] of positive
[24:08] thoughts instead of right thoughts
[24:11] you're thinking already and you're
[24:13] standing there talking trying to be
[24:15] polite if you even doing that and you're
[24:17] shaking their hand God bless you and
[24:21] you're you give a cold
[24:26] handshake because You' seen him from
[24:28] across the room and you think you're
[24:30] you're thinking you've got the whole
[24:32] record going over of what Dan has done
[24:34] wrong to you and his life and what he's
[24:36] done wrong to everybody and you're
[24:37] thinking all that through so now you
[24:39] give him the cold shoulder but it's all
[24:41] in your
[24:42] thoughts you keep it a record in your
[24:45] thoughts this is our text the discretion
[24:48] of man defer this anger and His glory is
[24:49] the Passover transgression 1 Peter 48
[24:51] above all things have fervent charity
[24:54] among yourselves for charity shall cover
[24:57] a multitude of sins it doesn't keep
[25:00] record Divine love but it actually
[25:03] actually releases the record of somebody
[25:06] and it forgives can you say
[25:09] Amen so it's in the thinking really that
[25:11] we hold this account now this word when
[25:14] it talks about accounting it thinketh no
[25:16] evil and it's tied to the Greek here
[25:19] that's why we get the conclusion love
[25:21] does not keep a record of others wrong
[25:23] this is a counting word it's used of
[25:26] numerical calculation
[25:28] it is used the same word in the Greek is
[25:30] used of God that does not impute our
[25:33] guilt to us he does not impute sin to us
[25:35] which means he doesn't he he doesn't
[25:38] keep it on our account he releases it
[25:40] from our account but instead of imputing
[25:42] the righteousness of of Christ to
[25:45] instead God imputes the righteousness of
[25:47] Christ to our account and does not
[25:49] impute our guilt or our sin Romans 46-8
[25:53] that's what it says so love doesn't keep
[25:57] a tally of wrongs and bear a grudge
[26:00] until everyone has has it paid
[26:03] for can I get an
[26:06] amen love does not keep a tally of
[26:09] wrongs and bear a grudge until everyone
[26:11] is paid for it doesn't try to gain the
[26:13] upper hand by reminding the other person
[26:16] of the past wrongs love forgives can you
[26:20] say Amen love forgives and it tries to
[26:23] even
[26:24] forget it's that's harder but for sure
[26:28] love
[26:31] forgives love forgives love forgives
[26:33] love love doesn't keep a record of
[26:36] others wrong how much do we do that how
[26:39] much record are we keeping of another
[26:42] person's wrong you know so God's the
[26:44] perfect accountant every little act will
[26:46] will not be forgotten can you say Amen
[26:49] every little thing that the whole world
[26:50] didn't see but you did somehow unselfish
[26:53] act you gave and you did something and
[26:55] God is the perfect counted how many
[26:58] believe God keeps perfect
[27:02] records
[27:03] except for one
[27:06] thing our
[27:10] sin this is why he's a perfect
[27:12] accountant
[27:14] too except for our sin in God's Great
[27:19] Quick
[27:21] Books perfect Quick Books God can go
[27:25] over and take all the things that we've
[27:27] done wrong and click on it and scroll
