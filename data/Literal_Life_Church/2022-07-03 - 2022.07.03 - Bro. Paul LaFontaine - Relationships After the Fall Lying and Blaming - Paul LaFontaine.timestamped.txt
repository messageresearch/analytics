[0:00] to hear any other visitors we're just
[0:01] glad to have you this morning i noticed
[0:03] brother
[0:04] holt's girlfriend there good to have you
[0:06] sis
[0:07] and all that's joined in with us genesis
[0:09] chapter 3 if you would with me this
[0:11] morning
[0:14] genesis chapter 3
[0:16] and i know i read this a couple weeks
[0:18] ago but i'm going to read through it
[0:19] again until 2 13
[0:22] and pull some things out of it here
[0:23] again
[0:24] do you love the word of god
[0:26] amen i love the word of god it's the
[0:28] absolute it's the anchor in our lives
[0:31] and that's why we need more and more of
[0:32] it we need his revelation this morning
[0:35] the serpent was more subtle than any
[0:37] beast of the field which the lord god
[0:38] had made and he said unto the woman yea
[0:41] hath god said ye shall not eat of every
[0:43] tree of the garden and the woman said in
[0:45] the serpent we may eat of the fruit of
[0:46] the trees of the garden but of the fruit
[0:48] of the tree which is in the midst of the
[0:49] garden god hath said ye shall not eat of
[0:52] it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die
[0:55] and the serpent said unto the woman ye
[0:57] shall not surely die
[0:58] for god doth know in the day ye eat
[1:01] thereof then your eyes shall be opened
[1:03] and ye shall be as gods knowing good and
[1:06] evil i want you to notice the first
[1:08] thing that's happened here is a
[1:09] misinterpretation of the word but you
[1:12] can really technically call it a lie
[1:16] it's a lie even though there's 90
[1:19] percent truth to it if it's got air in
[1:22] it this way it's misinterpretation it's
[1:24] still called a lie
[1:26] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:28] good for food and that was pleasant to
[1:30] the eyes and the tree to be desired to
[1:32] make one wise she took of the uh she
[1:34] took of the fruit their oven did eat and
[1:36] gave also unto her husband with her and
[1:38] he did eat and the eyes of both of them
[1:40] were opened and they knew that they were
[1:42] naked and they sold fig leaves together
[1:44] and made themselves aprons and they
[1:46] heard the voice of the lord walking god
[1:49] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[1:51] day and adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:53] from the presence of the lord god among
[1:55] the trees of the garden so now we get to
[1:57] see some of the fallout of then of
[2:00] leaving the word and a lie told against
[2:02] the word now we have the fall taking
[2:04] place the great thing that's called the
[2:05] fall of man and so this is the
[2:08] attributes that start to come from it
[2:09] and that's hiding from god the
[2:11] fellowship the union the oneness they
[2:13] had walking in the cool the evening with
[2:15] him has been broken there's guilt
[2:17] there's shame all the oneness has been
[2:19] broken and they're hiding
[2:21] and the voice of the lord is still
[2:22] trying to come and find them verse 9 and
[2:25] the lord called unto adam and said unto
[2:26] him where art thou and he said i heard
[2:28] thy voice in the garden and i was afraid
[2:30] because i was naked and i hid myself and
[2:33] he said who told thee that thou was
[2:34] naked hast thou eaten of the tree where
[2:37] have i commanded thee that thou should
[2:38] not eat and the man said
[2:40] the woman whom thou gave us to be with
[2:43] me she gave me of the tree and i did eat
[2:47] this is something the prophet starts to
[2:49] refer to
[2:50] and starts to show
[2:52] passing the buck or blaming it's another
[2:55] attribute of the fall and that is
[2:57] instead of taking ownership and telling
[2:59] the truth himself because remember now
[3:01] the spirit of lies is consuming
[3:03] everything now and so now they become
[3:06] liars himself he should have been
[3:07] answering yes i took of it instead now
[3:09] he's blaming his wife so nobody starts
[3:12] to answer truthfully
[3:14] because you're under the spirit of lies
[3:16] now
[3:18] so now in in this in lies spirit of lies
[3:21] will never work in
[3:23] oneness in relationships
[3:26] only the truth
[3:28] and he said who told me that that was
[3:30] naked verse 12 and the man said the
[3:32] woman thou gave was to me she gave me a
[3:33] tree and i did eat and the lord said
[3:35] unto the woman what is this that thou
[3:37] has done and the woman said the serpent
[3:39] beguiled me and i did eat and so now
[3:42] it's a trickle-down effect father bless
[3:44] your word today
[3:46] you know lord what you need to say to
[3:49] your precious people your sons and your
[3:51] daughters they are here
[3:53] they are hungry lord and they're
[3:55] listening and so i pray you'll give us
[3:57] ears to hear spiritual ears to hear what
[4:00] the spirit is saying to the church we
[4:02] commit it to you we're thankful lord and
[4:05] once again we are thankful for a life
[4:06] like brother tom we honor him today pray
[4:09] you'll bless his life give him health
[4:11] give him strength and i pray he'll just
[4:13] have a wonderful week and a wonderful
[4:14] day and we commit the day to you
[4:17] whatever plans that we have on this
[4:19] independence weekend lord as the the
[4:21] nation celebrates their own way with no
[4:24] doubt alcohol and all these other things
[4:26] but lord we remember
[4:28] the many millions of lives that have
[4:31] died for our freedom and we're thankful
[4:33] for it you died for our spiritual
[4:35] freedom and we've had many men and women
[4:38] die
[4:39] for our freedom to be free in this
[4:41] country still so we're thankful for it
[4:44] and we rejoice in it lord may you help
[4:46] us lord to keep that in mind in jesus
[4:48] name amen god bless you once you shake
[4:51] your brother and sister's hands before
[4:52] you're seated god bless you each one
[4:55] now i'm preaching this morning again on
[4:57] relationships i'm going back to the
[4:59] subject of relationships
[5:01] and it's amazing how if you look real
[5:04] deeply at the actions of adam and eve
[5:06] after the fall and literally right after
[5:09] the fall
[5:10] it's amazing to look at the
[5:11] characteristics that these are
[5:13] characteristics
[5:14] right just i don't know if it was a few
[5:16] minutes or a few days i don't know that
[5:18] but it's right after the fall
[5:20] it's amazing if you look very deeply you
[5:23] can see that there are characteristics
[5:26] coming out that are so revealing of how
[5:29] broken relationships function today
[5:33] if we if we can be honest and we can see
[5:36] our fallen condition and the broken
[5:39] conditions that we live in today
[5:42] if we would just look honestly at that
[5:44] then we can see it back where it started
[5:46] at the beginning and not just to look
[5:48] honest and to be honest and to see we're
[5:51] in a fallen condition
[5:53] and uh we're in broken conditions with
[5:55] our families and there's such a uh such
[5:58] a so many things we can talk about as
[6:00] far as broken families and broken
[6:02] relationships the hour that we live in i
[6:04] think it's the worst
[6:06] age that we've ever had for that and so
[6:09] but when we look at the beginning we can
[6:11] look and honestly see where our fallen
[6:13] condition came from
[6:15] and that also there is no way to get on
[6:18] the road to redemption and restoration
[6:21] unless we are honest about the condition
[6:24] that we are in
[6:26] unless there's repentance unless there's
[6:28] an acknowledgement of the condition that
[6:30] we're in first and that's why when the
[6:32] kingdom of god opened up in the book of
[6:34] acts it began with repentance you'll
[6:36] never get into the channel or god's
[6:39] redemptive power unless there's
[6:41] repentance first
[6:43] unless there's an acknowledgement of the
[6:45] condition that you're in and that i need
[6:47] help from god that i need help my
[6:49] relationships are broken i i'm at i'm at
[6:52] a loss here i don't know what to do
[6:54] unless there's a repentance and say lord
[6:56] i need help you'll never find the path
[6:58] to redemption but once you begin
[7:00] repenting and saying i acknowledge the
[7:02] condition i'm in i see it in the garden
[7:05] i see it now in my family i see what
[7:07] i've done i see what i've done wrong and
[7:09] when you begin to get in that kind of
[7:11] mode then you open yourself up to a
[7:13] great great power and the road to
[7:16] redemption and restoration and the only
[7:19] way we have that is through the blood of
[7:20] jesus christ at calvary that he made a
[7:23] way to redeem us back and to restore
[7:26] broken relationships
[7:28] not only with god but with one another
[7:30] as well
[7:31] let me proclaim at the outset that
[7:33] whatever i say on relationships in your
[7:35] life that are in a still in a fallen
[7:38] condition if i get specific today and
[7:41] talk a little bit about things that make
[7:42] it uncomfortable for you let me say that
[7:45] whatever i talk to you about in the
[7:47] relationships in your life being maybe
[7:49] still in a fallen type condition no
[7:52] matter how ugly no matter how bad it is
[7:55] you need to know that however fallen the
[7:58] power of redemption can come to sons and
[8:01] daughters of god and give them the right
[8:03] thing and restore the worst conditions
[8:07] and if we don't believe that we
[8:08] shouldn't even be at church this morning
[8:10] there is a power of redemption that
[8:12] comes from calvary that has the power
[8:14] for every impossible situation every
[8:17] marriage that's broken every family
[8:19] that's broken anything that has been
[8:21] broken calvary has the power to restore
[8:26] if we don't believe that we shouldn't be
[8:27] a church
[8:28] because we're about the blood of jesus
[8:30] christ here we're about the power of god
[8:32] here this isn't just word but it's the
[8:34] word and power
[8:36] paul even said he said i don't preach
[8:38] enticing words of man's wisdom but
[8:40] through power and demonstration of the
[8:42] holy ghost in other words god has the
[8:44] power to come and do something about it
[8:46] and preachers many times preach under
[8:48] conviction because they tell our
[8:49] problems the conviction comes lord i'm
[8:52] in a state that i need your help but
[8:53] it's a good thing we're not left in a
[8:55] state that we're left without help
[8:57] there's a power that comes through
[8:58] preaching and if we'll reel to him can
[9:00] you say amen every broken thing can be
[9:03] restored
[9:05] i could safely say though that we're in
[9:07] the worst condition
[9:08] of any generation
[9:10] that the world has ever been in
[9:11] everything
[9:12] has become corrupted
[9:14] families minds
[9:16] everything
[9:18] and hatred and bitterness and distrust
[9:21] and divorce has filled our age and not
[9:25] only all of this brokenness and this
[9:27] hatred and this bitterness and we've
[9:30] we've reached another level in our
[9:31] country of divide and hatred towards one
[9:34] another people who used to get along in
[9:36] our world politically the lines are
[9:39] being drawn and it's not just that they
[9:41] disagree anymore there's a hatred
[9:43] towards one another there's a hatred
[9:45] when political laws are changed and each
[9:47] side becomes digging in their heels even
[9:50] more how many read the news and
[9:52] understand we're in a different we're in
[9:54] a civil war in this country can you say
[9:56] amen and the divide is getting bigger
[9:58] that's the spirit that's in our nation
[10:00] it's the spirit in the world god have
[10:03] mercy if we let that spirit come in the
[10:05] church
[10:08] but it's in the end that he sends a word
[10:10] of restoration
[10:12] it's in the end when relationships are
[10:14] broken like they are it's in the end
[10:16] when when 60 of marriages end up in a
[10:18] divorce it's in the end when everything
[10:21] has been broken it's in the end that god
[10:23] has prophecies of a restoration of his
[10:26] word and that word will have power in it
[10:28] it just needs to be believed with all of
[10:30] your heart and then we watch it do its
[10:32] work can you say amen the conditions
[10:34] that i i deal with uh
[10:37] sometimes even as a pastor in these days
[10:40] i would not even attempt and i wouldn't
[10:42] even attempt to try to help unless i
[10:45] knew that there was a power and to watch
[10:48] that power go to work
[10:52] you say well i'm not i can't get back my
[10:54] husband i can't get back with my wife
[10:56] that's over that's done they're married
[10:57] to someone well i'm not talking about
[10:59] that type of restoration i'm talking
[11:01] about god restoring you
[11:03] that you can live victorious
[11:07] i'm talking about a power that you can
[11:09] live above it and you can go on in the
[11:11] lord no matter what's happened to you in
[11:13] your life the power redemption says i
[11:15] can raise up above it i can overcome it
[11:17] the holy ghost can overcome it
[11:20] can i get any help this morning can i
[11:21] get an amen
[11:23] thankfully we can preach a power of
[11:25] redemption that will bring us out of it
[11:27] and the prophet uh the prophet uh isaiah
[11:30] said it this way and i'm just going to
[11:31] mention this prophecy it become real
[11:33] inspiring to me yesterday this week as
[11:36] i'm studying about on some services at
[11:38] the youth camp a couple classes
[11:39] wednesday and thursday morning at byc
[11:41] this week been studying for that but
[11:43] this became real real to me i know it's
[11:45] a scripture that you've heard all many
[11:47] many times but this is how the prophet
[11:49] isaiah and by the way i'll be quoting
[11:51] other prophets today but this is how the
[11:53] prophet isaiah in isaiah 59 19 if you
[11:56] want to pull it up isaiah 59 19
[12:00] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[12:02] from the west and his glory from the
[12:05] rising of the sun now you know the rest
[12:06] of the scripture but let's just read the
[12:08] first part again so shall they fear the
[12:11] name of the lord from the west and his
[12:13] glory from the rising of the sun you
[12:15] know what group of people that's talking
[12:17] about that's the bride of jesus christ
[12:19] because we are in the western hemisphere
[12:22] we are in the west part of the world and
[12:24] so shall they fear the name of the lord
[12:26] there's going to be a bride in the west
[12:28] now jesus was born in the east the
[12:31] gospel started in the eastern part of
[12:33] the world that it began to rise and the
[12:36] light shine there and then that light
[12:38] began to start shining and it went into
[12:39] europe and it went into india and went
[12:41] in all those places and then finally the
[12:43] gospel traveled over with the pilgrims
[12:45] and come into our country and now it's
[12:48] traveled all the way west west west but
[12:50] he said there will be a people in the
[12:52] west that fear the name of the lord i
[12:54] believe that's the bride of jesus christ
[12:56] and his glory from the rising of the sun
[12:59] why did the prophet have to preach the
[13:00] rising of the sun because it's in this
[13:02] last hour it will be the rising of the
[13:04] son of god again his word will come back
[13:07] again can you say there'll be a
[13:08] resurrection of his word
[13:10] so this is a prophecy but here's the
[13:13] part that is happening in our day that
[13:15] is you've read it before but in that day
[13:18] when the enemy shall come in
[13:21] like a flood
[13:23] our enemy today
[13:25] is not coming in like a trickle
[13:32] or like a rippling brook
[13:35] maybe in other area ages he came as just
[13:38] a rippling he came as a river maybe a
[13:41] fast flowing river
[13:43] maybe in other ages he came in a
[13:45] different way but in your age in your
[13:47] time the enemy shall come in like a
[13:50] flood
[13:51] and a flood i don't know if you've ever
[13:53] been in a flood most of us probably
[13:55] haven't but if you watch videos of
[13:57] seeing people in a flood it's a very
[13:59] dangerous thing and the flood that water
[14:01] has power it swipes i've watched some of
[14:03] the things from the the typhoons and
[14:05] different things in the philippines and
[14:07] some videos our brother sends us and
[14:09] that power behind the water coming in
[14:11] like a flood i tell you you better get
[14:13] somewhere because it's going to sweep
[14:14] away everything and the enemy is wanting
[14:17] to sweep your life away from everything
[14:19] good young people the enemies come in
[14:21] like a flood not a trickle not a little
[14:24] river but like a flood and if you're not
[14:26] holding on to something that flood will
[14:28] sweep you away can i get an amen this
[14:31] morning the enemy you're dealing with
[14:32] and we're dealing with internally is a
[14:35] flood it's not just a little thing but
[14:37] we're dealing with something deeper and
[14:38] you'll be swept away unless you got the
[14:42] rest of the prophecy when the enemy
[14:44] comes in like a flood the spirit of the
[14:46] lord shall lift up a standard against it
[14:51] i'm so glad for the other part of the
[14:53] prophecy
[14:56] because when this flood takes place
[14:58] you know if you've never been there you
[15:00] people talk you've never been in a flood
[15:02] but spiritually you're really in a flood
[15:04] because it's the enemy trying to take
[15:06] your children it's the enemy trying to
[15:08] flood your home it's the enemy tried to
[15:10] get in through all the movies it's the
[15:12] enemy flooding to sweep away and
[15:14] somebody that's in a flood has watched
[15:16] their home swept away they've watched
[15:18] their cars sweep away everything gets
[15:20] swept away because it's a flood you
[15:22] don't have anything within you to stop
[15:23] that happening the only thing we need is
[15:25] a standard a bander something to hang on
[15:28] to and you've watched those people's in
[15:30] those clips sometimes they grab a hold
[15:32] of something that will hold something
[15:34] that'll stay and for hours and days they
[15:37] have to hold on to that i say if you
[15:39] have the token today you've got this
[15:41] word i say you ought to hold on to it
[15:43] for dear life you ought to grab a hold
[15:46] stronger than you've ever grabbed
[15:48] because the enemy is rushing like a
[15:50] flood
[15:52] say it again if we can if we can't be
[15:55] honest and acknowledge our broken
[15:56] conditions we'll never tap into the
[15:58] redemptive power i'd like you to turn
[16:00] with me to first john chapter one as we
[16:03] see
[16:04] john
[16:05] first john here and um i want to go into
[16:08] a little series later on on the
[16:10] antichrist because it's only
[16:12] in first second third john
[16:14] that the antichrist spirit is mentioned
[16:15] revelation that exposes them but it's
[16:17] not called the antichrist
[16:19] spirit
[16:20] and the antichrist himself when it comes
[16:22] incarnate so i've been studying this and
[16:23] so i'm only going to hit the first few
[16:25] scriptures i'm not going to talk about
[16:26] that today but i like john because if he
[16:29] is the one that has to tell us about
[16:32] dealing with the antichrist spirit at
[16:34] the end and how to deal with it he's
[16:36] going to draw some very clear lines
[16:39] to how we can tell this is the
[16:41] antichrist spirit and this is not
[16:45] john is so
[16:48] straight
[16:50] you remember a scripture
[16:52] later on in the book that says he that
[16:54] loves the world
[16:56] or the things of the world
[17:00] hath not the love of the father in him
[17:03] my goodness that's straight
[17:06] that's strong you've got the love of the
[17:08] things of the world something's wrong
[17:11] and he makes it clear because why does
[17:13] he have to make it clear because if
[17:14] you're dealing with the antichrist
[17:16] spirit that's so close and by the way
[17:18] it's not out there somewhere in
[17:20] denominational systems it's not out
[17:22] there it's not in the the pope and
[17:24] everything that we talk about no no no
[17:26] no the antichrist spirit is so close and
[17:28] it's working right among us
[17:34] i'm not too popular today but anyway
[17:37] don't you ever attribute it out there
[17:38] somewhere it's working to try to cause
[17:40] things within us
[17:42] and if we have to be ready for that
[17:44] antichrist spirit we better read first
[17:46] second and third john we better get a
[17:47] hold of the the anchor because we need
[17:49] to know so john draws some clear lines
[17:51] here first john 1 verse 5 says this then
[17:54] is the message which we have heard of
[17:55] him and declare unto you that here we go
[17:58] here's the distinction clear-cut god is
[18:01] light
[18:02] and in him is no darkness at all
[18:06] don't ever blend all this together and
[18:08] say well there's a little bit of
[18:09] darkness there no he's light and there's
[18:12] no darkness in him
[18:14] if we say that we have fellowship with
[18:16] him oh now he's talking about fellowship
[18:18] if we have fellowship if we say well
[18:21] i've got fellowship with the lord i'm
[18:22] oneness with the lord and walk in
[18:24] darkness we
[18:26] are lying
[18:29] good grief i'm not come on guys i'm not
[18:31] as strong a preacher as john here
[18:33] my goodness
[18:35] if we're saying we're in fellowship with
[18:36] him and we're in oneness and we're
[18:38] walking in our daily life in darkness
[18:40] we're lying
[18:42] that's a lie you're lying to yourself
[18:45] because god is light and in his no
[18:47] darkness we're we're running from the
[18:50] darkness we're walking in the light
[18:52] every day not just a church we want to
[18:54] live in the light and light exposes lies
[18:58] light exposes darkness and if you live
[19:00] in it there's no hidden closets
[19:03] [Music]
[19:04] praise the lord this is where they're at
[19:06] see because the antichrist spirit it
[19:08] just blends it all together and you're
[19:09] okay and that's all right yeah a little
[19:11] this a little of the world that'll be
[19:13] fine that's the antichrist spirit that
[19:14] works in denominational systems and let
[19:16] the people do it no preachers will
[19:18] preach against it i don't blame the
[19:19] people no preachers will stand up and
[19:21] preach against the things of the world
[19:23] but when you're dealing with antichrist
[19:25] spirit you better preach against things
[19:26] of the world
[19:27] you better make distinctions because in
[19:30] this word in this light in this message
[19:32] if you're preaching it god is light and
[19:34] in him is no darkness at all and if you
[19:38] fellowship say you fellowship and you
[19:40] walk in darkness we lie and do not the
[19:42] truth
[19:43] but if we walk in light as he is in the
[19:47] light we have noticed his presence is
[19:50] there too
[19:51] can you say amen
[19:52] if we walk in light as he is in the
[19:55] light we have fellowship now i'm
[19:57] preaching on relationships i'm preaching
[19:59] on oneness how do we find oneness how do
[20:02] we find true fellowship how many would
[20:04] raise your hand the story don't raise
[20:05] your hand unless you mean it is that i
[20:06] want to try i want to find
[20:09] true fellowship with one another true
[20:12] holy ghost fellowship
[20:15] if we walk in the light he's eating
[20:16] light we have fellowship one with
[20:17] another
[20:18] so so fellowship only comes by walking
[20:22] in the light
[20:24] not in lies
[20:26] in in light
[20:27] that's the only way you can have true
[20:28] fellowship
[20:30] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[20:32] cleanses us from all sins
[20:34] if we say that we have no sin we deceive
[20:38] ourselves and the truth is not in us now
[20:41] he's initially talking about somebody
[20:42] who won't confess that they're a sinner
[20:45] that they have sin in their life that
[20:47] they're born with a serpent nature and
[20:49] anybody that doesn't take the first step
[20:51] and will not confess and acknowledge
[20:54] that they have sin in their lives
[20:56] they'll never find the path of
[20:58] redemption
[21:00] because why because it says if you say
[21:02] you have no sin
[21:04] you're deceiving yourself it's
[21:06] self-deception
[21:10] and the truth is not in us
[21:12] if we confess our sins so now now we're
[21:15] looking at
[21:16] what we're preaching on and that's
[21:17] confession
[21:19] and truth
[21:21] if we confess our sins he's faithful and
[21:22] just to forgive us our sins and to
[21:24] cleanse us from all righteousness if we
[21:26] say that we have not sinned
[21:28] we make god a liar
[21:32] so you're deceiving yourselves
[21:35] you're lying yourself i don't have any
[21:37] sin for god to deal with you're
[21:39] deceiving yourselves and you're actually
[21:41] calling god a liar
[21:44] i haven't done anything wrong i've been
[21:45] a good person
[21:47] i've lived a decent life i don't need
[21:49] christ i don't need the lord i'm a
[21:52] decent person i have no sin in me i've
[21:54] lived a good life you're making god a
[21:56] liar
[21:59] and his word is not in us so
[22:01] thank you john for shooting straight
[22:03] with us
[22:04] my goodness
[22:05] but light goes with truth
[22:08] and us telling the truth
[22:11] light
[22:12] will always be with truth
[22:15] and telling the truth
[22:17] confessing i'm a sinner i'm in this
[22:19] condition don't make god a liar but say
[22:22] i'm a sinner i need him i i need god's
[22:25] redemption in my life i need god's grace
[22:27] now going back to genesis redemption
[22:30] uh
[22:32] redemption actually if you want to turn
[22:33] to genesis 4
[22:35] redemption actually the path to
[22:37] redemption was caught by abel here
[22:40] the path to redemption
[22:42] was caught by abel
[22:45] adam and eve's son
[22:49] the true path to redemption was not
[22:51] caught by cain the serpent's son but it
[22:53] was caught by abel
[22:55] and he brought he caught a revelation
[22:58] that the way back was through blood
[23:01] the only way back was not through fruits
[23:03] not good through good things we do the
[23:05] only way now that we have to deal with
[23:07] this sin is through blood and to have a
[23:10] blood sacrifice a substitute that stands
[23:12] in your place he caught that revelation
[23:14] right away when he grew up and then all
[23:16] of a sudden now the two boys grow up
[23:18] this this
[23:20] boy of adam and eve he caught a
[23:22] revelation from god didn't know all the
[23:25] details that you know today didn't
[23:26] uphold the story he just caught a
[23:28] revelation our path to redemption our
[23:30] path back is through a substitute
[23:33] through a blood something stands in our
[23:34] place
[23:36] so but i want you to notice though even
[23:38] though he caught it and then you know
[23:39] what happened he brought the sacrifice
[23:41] of blood he was accepted by god yes
[23:44] you've got it right this is the way back
[23:46] cain's over here tries to bring his own
[23:48] fruits tries to justify himself his
[23:50] self-righteousness and you know what
[23:52] cain gets mad at abel and his
[23:56] righteousness that god gave him in his
[23:57] sacrifice he gets mad he gets angry
[24:00] which is another attribute of
[24:03] the fall
[24:06] why in the world is he angry at his
[24:08] brother for finding the right path back
[24:12] he should have been saying praise god
[24:14] abel i'm running over there to you bud
[24:16] let me go get a lamb you found it you
[24:19] got a revelation man i don't have it yet
[24:22] but i'm gonna get it and god actually
[24:23] said if you'll do what abel does i'll
[24:25] accept you that's a serpent seed come
[24:28] from the serpent and god offers him
[24:30] mercy
[24:32] but he ain't going to do it you know
[24:33] what he does the fallen nature he turns
[24:35] against abel he persecutes abel he puts
[24:38] him down and eventually murders him
[24:40] where does that come from that's why the
[24:42] prophet said elect this here's another
[24:44] distinction like john elect does not
[24:47] persecute elect
[24:52] it's a clear thing from our prophet of
[24:54] this hour elect does not persecute elect
[24:57] where does that come from where does
[24:59] killing come from where does anger come
[25:01] from where does persecuting somebody
[25:03] who's got a revelation come from it
[25:05] comes from the other side
[25:08] it never comes from god
[25:11] amen praise the lord so look at here
[25:13] genesis chapter four he caught the
[25:14] revelation genesis 4 and verse 25. i've
[25:18] got a lot of hay in my fork and fork and
[25:19] that's why i'm clipping along
[25:21] so i'll read fast and you listen quick
[25:24] as my dad used to
[25:27] and they say
[25:27] him to his wife again so now here we go
[25:30] abel gets
[25:32] killed by cain and adam knew his wife
[25:34] again and she bears son and called his
[25:36] name seth for god said she hath
[25:40] appointed me another seed instead of
[25:43] abel whom king slew so now seth is born
[25:47] and so then look at now
[25:49] abel had a revelation it was blood
[25:51] but i want you to notice something it
[25:53] wasn't good enough just to recognize
[25:55] that it was blood
[25:57] look what this third generation finds
[26:00] seth
[26:01] is born verse 26 and to seth to him also
[26:05] there was born a son and he called his
[26:08] name enos
[26:10] then
[26:11] then
[26:12] began men
[26:14] to call upon the name of the lord
[26:18] so even though
[26:20] there was a generation who knew it was
[26:22] the blood sacrifice
[26:24] it wasn't good enough god needed man to
[26:27] rise up and say i'm calling on you lord
[26:30] i need you lord i need you to change me
[26:33] lord i'm calling upon you lord
[26:36] seth didn't call upon the first
[26:38] generation passed
[26:39] he didn't call upon it but i tell you
[26:41] there's a new generation that came up
[26:43] and then they said lord i need you lord
[26:46] i need you lord i need you i know my
[26:48] grandpappy i know my grandpappy he
[26:51] talked about the blood and we need the
[26:52] blood i know that i noticed the blood of
[26:54] calvary but i need it for myself and i'm
[26:56] calling out to you i need you i'm not
[26:59] running from you i'm running towards you
[27:01] then listen friends listen may god put
[27:04] in our hearts to call upon the name of
[27:06] the lord every day because we need the
[27:08] lord he needs you
[27:11] to say i need you
[27:14] not just we come to church
[27:15] but i'm i'm a mess
[27:18] i need you
[27:20] i need you it wasn't seth's generation
[27:22] it was the one after that that began to
[27:24] call upon the lord and how many remember
[27:26] from last sunday when i said that whole
[27:28] generation in the wilderness whole
[27:30] generation thank you for your comments
[27:31] about last sunday
[27:33] the whole generation
[27:34] god said because here they are
[27:36] complaining they said our children let
[27:38] me quickly say something about this two
[27:40] weeks before kids days
[27:42] sister sharon was in there writing songs
[27:44] for kids days
[27:45] and she fell upon that scripture that i
[27:48] read sunday she fell upon it that said
[27:50] here they are ready to go in the
[27:51] promised land and they complained they
[27:53] said we can't do it. but the worst thing
[27:55] that they said that sharon really called
[27:56] is that they said our children we need
[27:59] to go back to egypt but if we can't go
[28:00] back we're not going in because our
[28:02] children will be pray
[28:05] so they're speaking on behalf of the
[28:07] children if we go all the way in then
[28:08] our children pray well one of the
[28:11] translations says our children will be
[28:13] victims
[28:15] and she just begin to
[28:17] just weep because
[28:20] she feels like
[28:22] when god said
[28:24] now they're calling their children
[28:25] victims
[28:27] she thought of
[28:28] and she's away so i hope she don't mind
[28:30] me saying this
[28:31] she thought of the
[28:33] people that has left
[28:35] our ranks
[28:36] and actually has said
[28:38] we want to apologize to our children for
[28:41] raising them in the message
[28:45] we've made them victims
[28:47] just exactly what those under moses said
[28:51] so they feel like a victim they're going
[28:53] to make the children victims
[28:55] and they said we're not going in but god
[28:58] raises up this is part that inspired
[29:00] sharon god raises up and he says you
[29:02] know what
[29:04] joshua can go in because he has the
[29:06] right spirit
[29:08] caleb can go in because he has the right
[29:10] spirit
[29:11] and also those little ones that you said
[29:14] would be victims i'm letting them in the
[29:16] promised land
[29:18] somebody say praise the lord
[29:20] so if some parents don't get a hold of
[29:21] these things and i'm not knocking the
[29:22] parents i'm just saying if there's a
[29:24] bunch of parents in this generation that
[29:25] don't grab a hold of this holy ghost in
[29:27] this message god says i'm not going to
[29:29] hold the children accountable for that
[29:31] i'm going to deal with their hearts and
[29:32] i'm going to bring them into their land
[29:35] yeah go ahead and clap because that's
[29:37] what god is doing i'll bring those
[29:39] little ones
[29:40] and the presence of the lord
[29:43] she felt like that was the goal and the
[29:45] purpose of kids days that if
[29:47] god calls these young hearts and she
[29:50] said the presence of the lord came in
[29:51] that practice room and filled the whole
[29:54] place and last sunday she wept the
[29:56] entire service as i did not talk to her
[29:58] took the same text and preached on it
[30:00] she wept the entire service god is gonna
[30:03] bring the little ones in
[30:05] god says i don't care what the last
[30:06] generation has done i'm going to bring
[30:08] in the little ones
[30:16] it was the third generation that began
[30:17] to cry out to the lord not just that it
[30:19] was the blood but they needed to cry out
[30:21] to the lord
[30:24] to cry i need you
[30:26] see it's not just that you know about
[30:28] the blood
[30:29] it's when you admit that you are in a
[30:31] mess
[30:32] and say
[30:33] i need you lord i need you lord right
[30:36] now
[30:37] that's what god needs
[30:38] and he didn't just need that 20 years
[30:40] ago when you came to the altar he needs
[30:42] that every day paul said i die daily to
[30:45] myself
[30:46] i die daily
[30:47] i need the lord more than i've ever
[30:49] needed him before and he needs to hear
[30:52] that cry in your heart i need you lord
[30:54] i'm crying out to you lord this whole
[30:57] generation millions of people they don't
[30:59] need the lord they're not crying out but
[31:00] there's a bride that's crying out i need
[31:02] you lord
[31:03] i need your blood but i need i need your
[31:05] blood to have power in it to change my
[31:07] life
[31:09] god
[31:10] wants you to hear that you need him god
[31:13] needs you to speak the truth god needs
[31:15] honest truthful confession not a
[31:17] religion not to just know it was the
[31:19] blood it's when true redemption takes
[31:22] place that redemption power kicks in
[31:25] it's when true repentance takes place
[31:28] that true repentance and fellowship
[31:30] kicks in
[31:32] if you stay self-sufficient and refuse
[31:34] to to
[31:36] didn't refuse to
[31:38] and deny you have a problem
[31:40] and you you can't be helped if you keep
[31:43] you know denial is more than a river in
[31:45] egypt
[31:50] some people know that that was the only
[31:52] denial that's the only denial they know
[31:54] is the denial no no
[31:57] the worst kind is is that you're in
[31:59] denial that you need help
[32:02] that you're emotionally fragile
[32:09] my wife she
[32:11] a couple weeks ago she signs me up for
[32:15] she signs me up for a hearing test
[32:19] and i'm going
[32:20] wait a minute she comes across the
[32:22] kitchen she says she says i signed you
[32:25] up
[32:25] for a hearing test
[32:27] both of us you and me i've signed you
[32:29] over here i go huh what
[32:33] and i wasn't saying that because i
[32:34] couldn't hear i really i said what did
[32:36] you sign me up for because you know to
[32:39] be honest with you is that the last
[32:40] couple years i haven't had the hearing
[32:43] problem she's had the hearing problem
[32:46] and i'm wondering why if she has the
[32:48] problem why i have to go and be tested
[32:50] too i don't have time to do this i got
[32:53] other health issues i deal with and i
[32:55] know i don't have a problem with hearing
[32:58] i just don't
[33:07] we're going we're going to the hearing
[33:09] test we're going to go we got to do this
[33:10] done you have a problem you have a
[33:12] problem with comprehension you have a
[33:14] problem with this and you have a problem
[33:15] with that all right i'm going i don't
[33:17] have time to go but hon you've had the
[33:19] issues and i think you're in a bit of
[33:20] denial here
[33:23] you you you're the one and so
[33:26] we we go along and
[33:28] thinking both of us have had issues with
[33:30] hearing it
[33:32] just remind you just now of that uh 50th
[33:35] anniversary of that couple 60th
[33:37] anniversary and they're in the banquet
[33:39] and the husband wants to give a toast to
[33:41] his wife and he says dear bertha bertha
[33:45] i just want to say that after 60 years
[33:48] you have been
[33:50] tried and true and she goes eh
[33:54] i said
[33:56] after 50 years i found you to be tried
[33:59] and true and she goes what and then he
[34:01] just yells it after 50 years i wanted to
[34:05] say i'm happy with you you've been tried
[34:07] and true
[34:08] and she raises up and she says well
[34:12] i just want to let you know after 50
[34:14] years i'm tired of you too
[34:19] she still didn't hear it
[34:22] i go to this
[34:24] lady and i'm i'm in this thing i don't
[34:26] know why i'm there
[34:28] so she says
[34:29] let's let's test you first
[34:32] mr lafontaine i said all right go right
[34:34] ahead
[34:34] no problem susie's crossing she has
[34:37] siri back here on the machine and she
[34:39] says
[34:40] siri play us some
[34:43] m uh
[34:45] not ambulance sounds
[34:46] ambient sounds right
[34:49] play as some ambient sounds
[34:52] and siri
[34:53] comes back and says
[34:55] i did not understand the question
[34:57] i said it sounds like your machine has
[34:59] problem hearing
[35:03] i ain't got the problem here you know
[35:05] so she'd test me she does a test
[35:08] and she's taken the score down and
[35:12] becca can hear what she's asking for me
[35:14] to respond and she can see what's going
[35:16] on is that they're both laughing he's
[35:18] coming here in denial and he's the one
[35:21] with the problem
[35:23] so it was kind of embarrassing and
[35:25] so
[35:26] then she takes her test and sure enough
[35:28] hers ends up not being as big an issue
[35:32] as mine and she loved that she enjoyed
[35:34] it
[35:39] thank the lord to just to end the story
[35:41] right we don't have hearing issues we
[35:44] both have fluid on our ears that we need
[35:46] to get drained off probably me from my
[35:47] swimming and
[35:48] i don't know what hers is from but
[35:50] that's all we have thank the lord she
[35:51] did say though in looking at the
[35:53] direction you're headed mr lafontaine
[35:55] your wife will never have hearing
[35:56] problems in about 10 years
[35:59] you're going to have to start to have
[36:00] issues i said well my dad had
[36:02] hearing aids so probably in my family so
[36:04] i'll probably issue in my dad you know
[36:06] after my dad died
[36:07] at the hospital there they called me a
[36:09] week later and said your dad left his uh
[36:12] good hearing aids here do you want them
[36:14] obviously dad didn't need him anymore he
[36:16] has perfect hearing now and he left them
[36:18] i said i'll come and pick him up so
[36:20] anyway uh you know so she says you're
[36:22] going to have issues down there so
[36:23] anyway you know what there's no sense of
[36:25] being denial you gotta admit you're the
[36:27] one that's got the problem
[36:30] you listening
[36:33] so
[36:36] i said that to open up and
[36:38] to talk about
[36:43] let me look at my title and remember
[36:44] what i'm talking about
[36:49] i want to talk about relationships after
[36:51] the fall this is part two but i want to
[36:53] talk about lying
[36:55] and blaming others
[36:57] for a few minutes
[37:01] so those who don't want to hear any more
[37:03] will close this part of the service
[37:05] for you if you want to go
[37:10] so
[37:11] let's start to break this down
[37:13] first thing they both started to do is
[37:15] lie
[37:16] and the other thing they start to do is
[37:17] blame the other person
[37:19] that is a relationship that is not
[37:21] healthy and normal
[37:23] it's a fallen condition when you lie
[37:26] and when you blame other people
[37:29] and don't take personal responsibility
[37:32] for what you've done
[37:33] that is a fallen condition that's from
[37:35] your fallen nature and you will act that
[37:38] way from a fallen nature never never is
[37:41] that within what christ is trying to be
[37:44] in your life
[37:45] so brother brahm says here and now when
[37:47] adam and eve listen to the die of the
[37:48] devil the holy image of god left them
[37:51] their fellowship was broken with god
[37:52] their fellowship of oneness with god was
[37:54] broken the very minute they listened to
[37:56] the lie of the devil that broke their
[37:58] fellowship and the very minute that you
[37:59] you listen to the lie of the devil it'll
[38:01] break your fellowship that's the very
[38:03] minute that you go out from the presence
[38:04] of god like she did is when you fail to
[38:07] take god's word just as it is so
[38:10] everybody understands the foundation to
[38:12] this oneness message is to realize when
[38:14] you listen to the lie of the enemy it
[38:16] breaks oneness with god it breaks
[38:18] fellowship with god and it breaks
[38:20] fellowship and the minute you listen to
[38:22] life the devil he says it'll break your
[38:24] fellowship so what's the thing that
[38:25] establishes fellowship what's the thing
[38:27] that
[38:28] strengthens fellowship your fellowship
[38:30] with god what's the thing that
[38:31] solidifies what's the thing that brings
[38:33] it back
[38:34] certainly when we stay close to the word
[38:37] of god
[38:38] and we listen and obey the word of god
[38:40] and we're living on the word of god and
[38:42] not the lie of the enemy not his
[38:43] interpretation of the word going on in
[38:46] the oneness message now he takes it
[38:47] further he says now the oneness in
[38:48] fellowship was broke between god and his
[38:50] children the minute she disbelieved one
[38:52] little paragraph one little word of god
[38:54] everybody get that say amen congregation
[38:56] says amen not a not a bible say i don't
[38:59] believe the bible at all i believe half
[39:01] of it she had to believe all of it every
[39:03] bit not only that but the oneness
[39:05] between husband and wife was broken i
[39:07] don't believe there's any marriage can
[39:09] be what it ought to be without a union
[39:12] between husband and wife and god
[39:16] i don't care what marriage it is a
[39:19] marriage cannot be what it's intended to
[39:22] be without a union between husband and
[39:25] wife and god
[39:27] i love these things that's right
[39:30] they'll bring up children in the world
[39:32] and make them illegitimate give them
[39:34] cigarettes whiskey play cards in their
[39:36] site drink liquor before them no matter
[39:38] how loyal they are to now so no so the
[39:41] brother brain goes from the marriage now
[39:42] and he goes to the trickle-down effect
[39:44] to the children the next generations and
[39:46] that is that if god is not the sinner if
[39:48] there's not oneness with god in that
[39:50] marriage if a a three uh a three-part
[39:53] court is not easily broken in other
[39:55] words it has to be you and god and the
[39:57] wife and oneness with one another and
[39:59] with god and his word for this to work
[40:02] right and so then he talks about the
[40:04] children if they don't then they may
[40:06] have a marriage but there will be an
[40:08] effect on the children no matter how
[40:11] loyal they are to their marriage vows
[40:14] that's just sexually that's flesh
[40:18] could i take a while on this yes because
[40:20] how many marriages are based upon just
[40:23] sex
[40:26] how many marriages are loyal to stay
[40:28] together because their vow binds them
[40:30] together but not by a unity of god or
[40:32] unity with one another not a oneness in
[40:34] spirit not an intimacy in spirit but
[40:37] basically just sex holds them together
[40:39] excuse me for being just so straight the
[40:41] the sexual experience is the only thing
[40:43] and that's the only reason they stay in
[40:45] the marriage and these days they don't
[40:46] stay in it they're unfaithful because
[40:48] they can get that anywhere you see
[40:50] so but but
[40:51] you don't have a marriage if it's only
[40:54] based upon that
[40:57] you see why are people deceived in that
[40:59] because the bond of a man and woman
[41:01] coming together in marriage in the
[41:03] sexual experience is a certain bond
[41:07] there's a bond to it and god knew that
[41:09] and satan also knew that there is a bomb
[41:12] that happens a unique bond that's why
[41:14] the world without the holy ghost without
[41:17] finding out what god said a marriage was
[41:19] we'll gravitate that because there's
[41:21] something special in there i call it
[41:23] special but it's something there's a
[41:24] bond there and so when people are
[41:26] wanting to be bonded they're wanting to
[41:28] feel someone loves them they'll reach
[41:30] suggest the sexual experience because
[41:33] there is a certain bond that takes place
[41:35] and so they cling to that thinking
[41:37] that's the only bond they need but if
[41:39] you go to god marriage is so much more
[41:42] than just that experience
[41:44] can you say it and they never go to god
[41:46] to find out and sometimes even in our
[41:48] own ranks friends that sometimes that's
[41:50] the only thing that holds people
[41:51] together sometimes young people it's a
[41:53] lust for one another and not a genuine
[41:55] love for one another that's not a good
[41:57] foundation for a marriage it has to be
[42:00] respect and honor can you say amen it
[42:02] has to be a union with christ young
[42:04] people you must be in union with christ
[42:07] fully by the holy ghost before you marry
[42:09] one another or it will be hell on earth
[42:16] got to be a strong union with him
[42:18] and then when you come together it's not
[42:20] sexually first that's what i teach young
[42:21] people they get it all backwards they're
[42:23] they're together the first night the
[42:24] first thing they do is intimate one
[42:26] another that's the thing that's the
[42:27] worldly way is they there's three ways
[42:29] to bond body spirit and soul they bond
[42:31] in body first
[42:33] maybe they bond in emotions where they
[42:34] have some likes for one another but most
[42:36] of them never bond in the soul i say in
[42:39] the kingdom of god it's the other way
[42:40] around that's why i teach courtship is
[42:42] the first bond and attraction you have
[42:44] one another is the holy ghost and one
[42:45] another can i get an amen if that's not
[42:48] their first attraction to that young boy
[42:50] in his consistent life you know does he
[42:52] own a bible is he consistent in church
[42:54] does he talk about the lord if he
[42:56] doesn't talk about the lord then i
[42:57] wonder if the lord's in his life
[42:59] but if you can talk about every other
[43:00] thing and you find a bond that way great
[43:02] you're going to like the same music
[43:04] you're going to like the same colors oh
[43:05] it's so nice we like the same things but
[43:08] where is that person's experience with
[43:10] the holy ghost
[43:11] the bond of the soul has to be first
[43:16] then in courtship you start to bond in
[43:19] spirit and emotions
[43:21] and you start to get to know one another
[43:23] oh that's fine notice i haven't said the
[43:25] body yet
[43:27] notice i haven't said bonding in kissing
[43:31] and touching and feeling
[43:34] i haven't said it because it belongs in
[43:37] one place and that's after you're
[43:39] married
[43:44] and when young people get it all
[43:46] backwards
[43:48] you you might get married but the
[43:50] foundations are all shaky
[43:54] just take the example of
[43:56] the two met together out in the world
[43:58] met in a bar
[43:59] slept with one another that night
[44:01] and now they think they love one another
[44:03] and they got some foundation for
[44:06] marriage there's some in this room
[44:10] that the redemptive power of god
[44:12] has brought you out of the miry clay you
[44:14] were in those bars you slept with those
[44:16] people
[44:18] because you weren't raised by a preacher
[44:20] that told you right and wrong like i'm
[44:22] doing now
[44:23] you weren't raised in a home
[44:25] or maybe you were amazed in a legalistic
[44:27] home and you ran away from the precepts
[44:29] of god
[44:33] but there's some in here that didn't get
[44:36] that
[44:37] but the redemptive power of god has them
[44:40] sitting here this morning
[44:41] learning
[44:43] about what real marriage is after 60
[44:46] years old after being married 30 the
[44:47] grace of god they're even sitting
[44:48] together this morning and they're
[44:50] sitting like sometimes like children
[44:52] saying
[44:53] i messed up oh god forgive me for
[44:55] messing up but this is so good to hear
[44:57] and some some of them will probably like
[44:59] to stand up and turn back at all you
[45:00] young people and say
[45:01] listen to the what the man is saying
[45:04] please
[45:06] of course if you said it that way
[45:07] they're probably going to be turned off
[45:08] but anyway
[45:10] listen i hope these young people listen
[45:12] let me tell you my testimony of of of
[45:15] the scars and the pain and sleeping with
[45:18] all kinds of different women and all the
[45:20] thinking that's the bond or that's the
[45:21] craving of love i needed and i've
[45:23] learned today no that can't be first
[45:27] god has to be first as the
[45:30] foundation god the holy ghost and i'm
[45:34] only quoting brother branham who says if
[45:36] you do that he said if you marry that
[45:38] boy he'll make hell on earth for you
[45:40] that's his own words
[45:42] because he didn't have the birth yet
[45:45] and it'll be hell on earth
[45:48] for you my dear sister
[45:51] amen praise the lord
[45:54] praise the lord
[45:56] it's the word of god
[45:59] and you'll bring up children so now
[46:02] see i told you i could preach another
[46:03] around that
[46:04] no matter how loyal they are to the
[46:05] marriage office that's sexually that's
[46:06] flesh but there's a spirit in there that
[46:08] spirit of sinner papa and mama no matter
[46:10] how loyal they are children will come
[46:12] wrong you say well i know men and women
[46:13] that didn't teach your children the
[46:15] principles of god and they wasn't
[46:16] christians the very thing they're
[46:18] probably saying i know a lot of families
[46:20] out there they don't teach the
[46:21] christians of christ they seem to be
[46:23] doing all right the very thing of the
[46:24] not leading them to christ was the
[46:26] wrongest thing they ever could do
[46:27] besides the other not to lead them to
[46:29] christ see you can't have a correct
[46:32] union without it the fellowship broken
[46:34] then as soon as the fellowship was
[46:36] broken between adam and eve as soon as
[46:38] their fellowship was broken between god
[46:40] and them then their fellowship between
[46:41] each other was broke
[46:45] make it clear you can have a correct
[46:47] union
[46:49] without going to christ
[46:52] there can be no correct relationship
[46:53] with family or any other humans without
[46:55] the right one with god believing the
[46:57] word knowing the person of christ
[46:59] through a new birth through a personal
[47:01] relationship remember the garden of eden
[47:03] was not just a place it was a
[47:05] relationship and it was not just the
[47:07] word god said don't eat of that tree you
[47:10] can eat of all the trees but don't eat
[47:11] of that tree that was his word there's
[47:12] only one word to live by that was his
[47:14] word but eden was not just we got the
[47:17] commandments we got the word it wasn't
[47:19] just a word it was a relationship every
[47:21] day his presence came down it wasn't
[47:24] just said god gave us this bible and
[47:26] it's very short it's like two lines
[47:28] don't eat of this tree and we're just
[47:29] living by this living by this it wasn't
[47:31] just that he himself came down in
[47:34] fellowship and communed with him and
[47:37] said other things as well
[47:39] it's not just the word
[47:41] it's power with the word
[47:45] amen
[47:46] so
[47:48] then
[47:49] everything unravels after the fall guilt
[47:52] shame condemnation hiding sexual sin is
[47:55] there adultery respect is gone anger
[47:57] temper selfishness everything everything
[48:00] that held the relationship together with
[48:01] her husband was broken
[48:03] and the biggest thing that changed is
[48:05] they begin to lie
[48:07] why the you know satan's the father of
[48:09] lives the devil lied about the word the
[48:11] devil misinterpreted the word but we can
[48:13] call it a lie even if it's 99 truth in
[48:16] it so something misinterpreted excuse me
[48:18] something misinterpreted is really a lie
[48:21] and not the truth
[48:23] you can't have lies in every good right
[48:25] relationship you can't have blaming in
[48:27] relationships we must stay with it until
[48:29] the full truth comes out we must love
[48:31] how many of the marriages will
[48:33] that's been married many years will
[48:34] raise your hands down you can't have a
[48:36] solid marriage unless you live on truth
[48:39] and the truth comes out and you speak
[48:40] truth to one another
[48:42] anytime there's secrets any kind of
[48:44] secrets
[48:45] it breaks the fellowship
[48:47] anytime this little dabbling over here
[48:49] in adulterous pornographic things
[48:52] you don't even have to tell your wife
[48:54] you'll start to feel the oneness break
[48:57] and the wife starts to sense something's
[48:59] wrong and there's a break and there's a
[49:01] pride and there's there's uh he's
[49:02] getting more angry about stuff what's
[49:04] going on i'll tell you what's going on
[49:05] what brother brahman said here you break
[49:07] your with a fellowship with god you
[49:09] dabble in sin you break your oneness
[49:11] with one another
[49:17] we must love god by loving the truth not
[49:19] half truth paul said
[49:21] speaking the truth in love with one
[49:22] another when full truth is not pursued
[49:24] you're getting on to satan working among
[49:26] you when full truth is not pursued
[49:28] you're getting onto satan working among
[49:30] you
[49:32] praise the lord 12 34 i'm doing good
[49:35] i'm doing good on time so now watch next
[49:37] brother bram says what
[49:38] eve her thinking changed oh yes her
[49:40] thinking changed next quote her thinking
[49:43] so in the fall
[49:44] her thinking changed and her thinking
[49:45] towards adam changed and her thinking
[49:47] towards everything changed her
[49:49] fellowship with her husband wasn't right
[49:51] they begin to pass the buck see her
[49:53] thinking was actually changed why she
[49:55] had the life of the devil in her exactly
[49:57] as soon as she disbelieved god's word
[49:58] she accepted the life of the devil
[50:00] because she accepted his teaching
[50:02] interesting you accept satan's teaching
[50:05] the antichrist teaching of the of the
[50:07] bible if you accept it then you're
[50:10] accepting the life of the devil that
[50:12] goes with it
[50:14] so here's here it is the blame game the
[50:17] next quote and then we're done with the
[50:19] quotes watch now
[50:21] her union between her and her husband
[50:24] was broken
[50:26] quickly as soon as god said adam how did
[50:28] you do this instead of taking up for his
[50:30] wife he passed it on to his wife the
[50:32] woman now gave us me union broke
[50:35] what did she do instead of loving her
[50:37] husband and telling the truth she lied
[50:40] she should have said he's innocent i
[50:43] gave to him she didn't say that but that
[50:46] was the truth
[50:48] so it's just nobody's telling the truth
[50:50] it's just it's become just a feeling
[50:52] things it's avoiding punishment it's
[50:54] whatever it is but they're in the realm
[50:56] of lies they're not owning up to it
[50:59] he's saying what she should have said is
[51:00] adam is innocent i gave to him amen the
[51:03] bible said she gave to her husband she
[51:05] should have said the man's innocent i
[51:06] gave to him and then he did eat but i
[51:08] was the one that gave it to him instead
[51:10] of that she passed it on to the serpent
[51:13] closest bypass that's the same thing
[51:15] they tried to do today the husband wife
[51:17] the union broken husband and wife
[51:19] fellowship was broken between them how
[51:21] many heard brother ramsey say there
[51:23] that's the same thing marriages do today
[51:27] it happens
[51:28] in marriages today instead of speaking
[51:31] the truth
[51:32] well i don't want to hurt his feelings
[51:34] i don't want him to leave me
[51:37] whatever happens you're always better to
[51:40] own up to the full truth
[51:43] i would rather deal with the fallout to
[51:45] be truthful to my wife
[51:48] you know brother brown said he said if i
[51:49] went to another country and i flirted
[51:51] with another woman
[51:53] he said
[51:54] and it was with another woman he says
[51:56] now they'll come my comforter would keep
[51:57] me from doing that it's not going to be
[51:59] with another woman sexually
[52:01] the power of the holy ghost to keep you
[52:02] from that but he said one time he said
[52:05] just flirting with the other woman and
[52:06] then i come back
[52:08] and he says i said oh honey our dear i
[52:10] i didn't mean to do that i'm sorry i was
[52:12] i was just you know
[52:14] and and so then she says
[52:16] brother bryan says he says now she could
[52:19] leave me
[52:20] she could leave me over that
[52:23] she can't leave you over that no because
[52:25] she's hurt
[52:27] the relationship's been broken and you
[52:28] broke it but when he comes back and says
[52:30] you understand don't you do he's kind of
[52:32] insincere about it you know women don't
[52:35] take to that very well men don't take to
[52:37] it too well you're not being truthful
[52:41] i would rather
[52:42] be truthful and deal with the fallout
[52:44] like the woman who was
[52:46] all these years had nervousness and
[52:49] the prophet exposed to the holy spirit
[52:51] she had an affair with a man years ago
[52:54] and says you got to tell your husband
[52:56] she said well i told god that
[52:58] he said you don't owe that to god you
[52:59] owe it to your husband
[53:01] but if i do that he'll leave me
[53:03] he said whatever happens you got to tell
[53:05] the truth
[53:07] you see you're always better to be
[53:09] truthful even if it hurts
[53:12] get to the truth
[53:22] and then he says your husband's got to
[53:23] confess the same thing so they went and
[53:24] they confessed it to one another 20
[53:26] years later to invest that marriage come
[53:28] back together and rest it was restored
[53:30] the bible says jesus said
[53:33] you shall know the truth and the truth
[53:35] shall set you free
[53:37] you'll never be free in continuing to
[53:40] tell half truths
[53:42] to one another in your marriage
[53:46] the whole thing was marred it broke the
[53:48] fellowship the oneness within when there
[53:50] was broke the whole thing was marred
[53:52] because one word was disbelieved oh
[53:53] brother yeah she should have told the
[53:55] truth the oneness with her husband was
[53:57] gone and the oneness of them and god was
[53:58] gone and every church that doesn't take
[54:01] the whole of god's word the same thing
[54:04] happens you can have unity under some
[54:06] world council of churches and have half
[54:08] truths that you're preaching you've got
[54:09] to preach the word to have true unity in
[54:12] the body of christ
[54:13] amen
[54:15] but really it comes back to
[54:17] looking at yourself brother burleigh
[54:19] priesthood he says when something
[54:20] happens you look at yourself first
[54:22] so now i want to talk a little bit about
[54:24] blaming others because when something
[54:25] happens when sin happens when mistakes
[54:27] happen the first person you look at is
[54:29] yourself
[54:30] but we don't do that in our
[54:32] carnal nature in the fallen nature we're
[54:35] looking for reasons to blame somebody
[54:36] else under pressure we resort back to
[54:39] blaming to fighting to fussing to anger
[54:43] but brother burley said the first person
[54:45] that he looks at through this whole
[54:47] thing no sense in getting angry by
[54:48] everybody else look at yourself first
[54:51] it really comes back to that because if
[54:53] you're in fellowship you won't let
[54:55] someone pull you out of that fellowship
[54:57] not you're got not not going to protect
[54:59] everything over you're not going to
[55:01] excuse me you're not going to project
[55:02] everything over to others
[55:05] you're not going to say it's that other
[55:06] person that needs help and not me the
[55:08] first thing you say is i need help the
[55:11] first thing that you sing is that it's
[55:14] me it's me it's me o lord standing in
[55:17] the need of prayer
[55:19] not my brother not my sister but it's me
[55:21] o lord standing in the need of prayer
[55:25] there's an ownership that you take and
[55:27] it's a person that you look at first
[55:29] isn't it interesting that something
[55:31] happens and
[55:32] right away the first reaction
[55:36] the first reaction is to figure out
[55:38] who's to blame for this
[55:40] and within hours phone calls are made
[55:43] and everything let's try to figure out
[55:44] who's to blame i'm trying to teach you
[55:46] let's look at ourselves first before you
[55:49] go blaming somebody else
[55:53] blaming is a result of the fall it's not
[55:54] right it's not the christ-like way
[55:57] there's a young man in jail that said
[55:59] it's not my fault the other guys stole
[56:01] the stuff but they accused me
[56:07] the comedian flip wilson i remember this
[56:09] as a kid he used to say the devil made
[56:10] me do it
[56:12] so people blame other people
[56:14] they blame the devil and they blame god
[56:18] and you got a lot to you know you got a
[56:20] lot to blame there you know lots of
[56:21] people you blame god you can blame the
[56:23] devil flip wilson said the devil made me
[56:25] do it the devil why'd you do that the
[56:27] devil made me do it you've heard kids
[56:28] say that sometimes
[56:30] if they're growing up in church
[56:32] it's like diablo made me do it
[56:36] and that's not always good to shift the
[56:38] blame on him when you got to own up to
[56:41] what you did
[56:44] we blame fast food restaurants for
[56:46] making us fat
[56:49] we blame tobacco companies for giving us
[56:51] cancer we blame the church for our lack
[56:53] of spiritual growth
[56:55] we blame god for results of our poor
[56:57] choices oh god why is this happening to
[57:00] me we are in a culture where blaming
[57:02] others for our failures happens all the
[57:04] time but how does god view this blame
[57:06] game could it be a form of idolatry
[57:09] where our feelings of pride are elevated
[57:10] above any sense of responsibility we
[57:13] expect blame shifting from a child we
[57:15] expect it from a child how many has ever
[57:17] seen a child do that they're exposed
[57:20] it's it's there and they're still gonna
[57:22] say johnny johnny did it he did it
[57:27] we expect children to act this way but
[57:30] not adults many adults never grow to
[57:33] mental and emotional maturity still
[57:35] blaming others for their mistakes
[57:38] grown-ups acting like children
[57:40] counselors call this blame-shifting we
[57:43] come by this blame game honestly it's
[57:46] inherited sin i'm reading some things
[57:48] some writers have said here hope you
[57:49] don't mind it
[57:50] a lot of things that happened to us are
[57:52] the result of multiple contributing
[57:54] factors
[57:56] and can be caused by a mix of our own
[57:58] actions i'm going to read through these
[57:59] things i believe they're things to think
[58:01] about i'm going to read through them and
[58:03] i'm going to finish with something the
[58:04] lord gave me last night and i'll be
[58:06] closing
[58:08] a lot of things that happen to us are
[58:10] the result of multiple multiple
[58:12] contributing factors and it can be
[58:14] caused by a mix of our own actions and
[58:17] those of other people for example if you
[58:20] were to hit a pothole in the road and
[58:22] fall off your bike it was probably
[58:25] partly due to the fact that the road has
[58:27] been poorly maintained
[58:30] but also
[58:31] that you were cycling too fast and not
[58:34] looking where you were going
[58:38] if that were you you might be ranting
[58:40] and raging
[58:42] about your taxes are spent
[58:45] on these roads
[58:47] now that one was just too close to home
[58:50] with me
[58:51] it's just too convicting
[58:53] i had to repent right here
[58:56] ranting and raging about what your taxes
[58:58] are spent on these days
[59:00] and or would accept the part that you
[59:02] played in it and vow to learn from your
[59:05] mistakes if you find yourself trying to
[59:08] pass the buck for every mistake you make
[59:10] then it's probably gotten you into
[59:11] trouble in the past especially if you
[59:13] try to shift the blame onto your partner
[59:15] your marriage partner family best
[59:17] friends or people you have to work
[59:19] closely with no matter how much people
[59:20] love us there's only a certain number of
[59:22] times people will tolerate taking the
[59:24] blame for something that genuinely
[59:27] genuinely wasn't their fault
[59:29] you're only going to do that so long
[59:30] it's going to catch up with you
[59:32] and i'm talking to all of us here you're
[59:34] going to do that for so long it's going
[59:35] to catch up with you because people
[59:36] aren't going to tolerate being blamed
[59:38] for your mistakes
[59:40] as well as weakening our relationship
[59:42] being unable to take responsibility for
[59:45] our mistakes can damage us in other ways
[59:48] so now we have some reasons we blame
[59:50] others for our mistakes just so we we
[59:52] don't know sometimes the reasons why we
[59:54] do it you may have your own reasons but
[59:56] here's reasons why we choose to blame
[59:58] others for our mistakes all right number
[1:00:01] one to explain why something happened
[1:00:04] as humans it's our default to always
[1:00:06] look for something called it's our
[1:00:08] default to always look for the cause of
[1:00:11] something
[1:00:12] we like to have narratives that explain
[1:00:14] why things happen so that we can add
[1:00:16] these to our mental story of life rather
[1:00:18] than turning the light on ourselves or
[1:00:20] looking at the bigger picture in context
[1:00:22] we can explain things more quickly and
[1:00:25] easily by attributing them to others so
[1:00:27] one of the reasons that we do it is we
[1:00:29] explain it's to explain why something
[1:00:31] happened we like to find a story get a
[1:00:33] story quick and we like to find the
[1:00:35] fault and put it on somebody and we
[1:00:36] stick with that story even if not if
[1:00:39] it's not completely the
[1:00:40] truth number two the reason why we blame
[1:00:43] others to attack someone shifting the
[1:00:45] blame onto someone who is
[1:00:47] a subtle way to attack them we might do
[1:00:50] it so unconsciously but if we hold a
[1:00:51] grudge against someone for some reason
[1:00:53] perhaps we feel you've
[1:00:55] they've wronged us or blamed us in the
[1:00:57] past then if an opportunity to blame
[1:00:59] them presents itself it can be very
[1:01:01] tempting to take it blaming them for
[1:01:03] something is also a tactic we may use to
[1:01:05] hurt our partners whether we're aware of
[1:01:07] doing it or not number three
[1:01:09] why do we blame others it's a great
[1:01:11] defense mechanism shifting the blame
[1:01:13] directly onto someone or something else
[1:01:15] is the perfect way to avoid having to
[1:01:17] reflect on your behavior or delve deeply
[1:01:20] into your
[1:01:21] uh psyche that way that way you can
[1:01:24] remain blissfully unaware of your own
[1:01:25] shortcomings which can help maintain a
[1:01:28] fragile eagle
[1:01:30] i'm not talking about god's ego i'm
[1:01:32] talking about ego
[1:01:34] it's easier number four it's easier that
[1:01:37] way to blame others why would we bother
[1:01:39] doing all the tricky self-analysis and
[1:01:40] taking steps to fix the situation if we
[1:01:43] can just take the blame off of our own
[1:01:44] shoulders and place it on someone else
[1:01:46] sometimes we convince ourselves that
[1:01:47] it's really someone's else's fault but
[1:01:49] sometimes we know we're lying but we
[1:01:51] often decide on the spur of the moment
[1:01:52] that it's easier to tell a lie than it
[1:01:54] is to deal with the consequences of
[1:01:56] truth we learn to lie early on in life
[1:01:59] how many would say amen we are taught to
[1:02:02] lie
[1:02:04] we learn to lie early in life and most
[1:02:07] of us get pretty good at it we weigh the
[1:02:09] possibility of people finding out we've
[1:02:11] lied against the consequences we have to
[1:02:13] face if we own up and often take the
[1:02:15] easy option
[1:02:17] i'm just reading these to show you
[1:02:19] this is all from a fallen nature
[1:02:22] this is how we can rea react if it's
[1:02:24] from the fallen nature but christ does
[1:02:26] not react this way as a matter of fact i
[1:02:29] might as well say it christ took the
[1:02:31] path of calvary and to actually take the
[1:02:34] take the pain of our sin on himself
[1:02:41] we were to blame
[1:02:45] would you say man we were to blame
[1:02:49] and christ took that blame on himself
[1:02:53] number five we blame others because it
[1:02:55] removes inhibitions blaming other people
[1:02:57] can provide us with an excuse to act in
[1:02:59] a hurtful manner it's a way of
[1:03:01] justifying our actions
[1:03:03] excuse me it's a way of justifying our
[1:03:05] actions to ourselves to remove our
[1:03:07] brains natural inhibitions that are
[1:03:09] there to prevent us from having behaving
[1:03:11] poorly towards others it means we can
[1:03:12] build a thought pattern that allows us
[1:03:15] to act in a way that our moral compass
[1:03:17] would normally prevent
[1:03:19] so that's the that's the five
[1:03:21] that
[1:03:22] came from other writers i'm adding six
[1:03:23] and seven
[1:03:25] you blame others because you come out
[1:03:26] looking good
[1:03:29] self-righteous
[1:03:31] talking about other people makes us feel
[1:03:32] better about ourselves
[1:03:35] if we can tell what they did we don't
[1:03:36] look so bad
[1:03:38] that's why people talk about other
[1:03:40] people many times and god convict us all
[1:03:43] i'm guilty of it
[1:03:45] may we all do you think that i'm
[1:03:47] preaching that someone no no no no i'm
[1:03:49] preaching to every one of us here this
[1:03:50] morning
[1:03:51] we do these things for a reason and that
[1:03:53] is these reasons but also is that it
[1:03:56] feels much better if we can talk about
[1:03:58] other people and what they've done wrong
[1:04:00] because it puts us just a notch above
[1:04:03] and if anybody was listening wednesday
[1:04:05] night brother eli
[1:04:07] very masterfully brought what the key is
[1:04:10] and that's jesus
[1:04:12] humbled himself we need to humble
[1:04:14] ourselves and not think of ourselves
[1:04:15] higher than anybody else
[1:04:20] thank you brother eli
[1:04:23] you blame others because you come out
[1:04:25] looking better you come out looking
[1:04:26] pretty good any man that diagnoses
[1:04:28] themselves always comes out looking good
[1:04:32] number seven
[1:04:34] the reason you do is you're more
[1:04:35] interested in being right
[1:04:37] than the full truth
[1:04:39] or oneness with that person
[1:04:41] relationship must not be that important
[1:04:43] if you're always trying to put the blame
[1:04:46] on somebody else and not own up to it
[1:04:48] yourself you're more interested in
[1:04:49] looking out for yourself than the other
[1:04:51] person
[1:04:52] you're happy to hold on to a half truth
[1:04:54] then whole truth thus
[1:04:56] if you have hold on to half truth
[1:04:58] instead of
[1:04:59] pursue the whole truth thus half
[1:05:01] victories and not full victories how
[1:05:03] many did raise your hands i want full
[1:05:05] victories
[1:05:06] amen i want full directives and god has
[1:05:08] given us the victory god has given us
[1:05:10] full victories but we if we live on half
[1:05:13] truths then we're going to have half
[1:05:15] victories and sometimes not even any
[1:05:17] victories at all but the truth shall set
[1:05:20] you free so the father of lies has
[1:05:22] always i'm going to change this now and
[1:05:24] and wrap it up
[1:05:25] you know that the father of lies satan
[1:05:28] has always fought against the truth in
[1:05:30] every generation how many know that
[1:05:32] brother abraham said that the the enemy
[1:05:34] satan has had a success in always
[1:05:37] destroying the value of god's promise
[1:05:40] word for the age
[1:05:42] he's always destroying this trying to
[1:05:44] destroy the word for the age and the
[1:05:46] power of the word for the age he's
[1:05:48] always speaking against it he's always
[1:05:51] coming against it he's always saying
[1:05:52] things about it there's even people that
[1:05:55] blame the message and blame the prophet
[1:05:58] for the condition and the things that
[1:06:00] they've come to i'm a victim because of
[1:06:01] the blaming we were in a a a a a lunch
[1:06:04] with a minister
[1:06:06] and uh brother barry and i and we were
[1:06:08] talking to him and he spent about 20
[1:06:10] minutes talking about all of his
[1:06:11] troubles in life and all the troubles he
[1:06:14] seen within the message and all the
[1:06:15] fanaticism he spent a lot of time
[1:06:17] talking about you tell he was down by it
[1:06:18] well everything he described i knew i
[1:06:21] i've seen it i've watched it for 20 30
[1:06:23] years that's just human human nature
[1:06:26] human spirit coming out i don't judge
[1:06:28] the message by that i don't judge god by
[1:06:31] that can you say amen i'm not bailing
[1:06:33] out because people say stupid things and
[1:06:35] act stupid ways and fanaticism i don't
[1:06:37] do that but he spent all this time and
[1:06:40] brother brother barry saying to him
[1:06:41] straight listen all of these problems
[1:06:43] the message is not to blame for your
[1:06:46] problems
[1:06:48] and i'll echo that here this morning
[1:06:50] this precious message the word of god
[1:06:53] god himself is not to blame for your
[1:06:56] problems bring your problems to the lord
[1:06:59] and admit you're wrong
[1:07:02] you'll never be able to use it on
[1:07:04] judgment day to stand there and say but
[1:07:06] they did me wrong and this happened and
[1:07:08] this preacher and lord did you know
[1:07:10] about this situation it'll never stand
[1:07:12] up in court on the other side
[1:07:14] because at the end of the day it's about
[1:07:16] you and the word can you say mine
[1:07:20] i understand hurt i've been hurt i
[1:07:21] understand pain people have abused
[1:07:23] people have done wrong even preachers
[1:07:25] there's ministers that said things about
[1:07:27] me recently and i just say lord i put
[1:07:28] that in your hands that's between them
[1:07:30] and god i'm not going to lose sleep over
[1:07:32] this i'm going to pray for them i'm
[1:07:33] going to love them i'm not going to get
[1:07:35] caught up in this thing who's accusing
[1:07:36] me
[1:07:38] can you say amen
[1:07:39] we've got better things to do we've got
[1:07:40] the kingdom of god there's people being
[1:07:42] helped here
[1:07:44] i can't be distracted by things that are
[1:07:47] trying to cause division i've got to
[1:07:49] stay focused on the people who need help
[1:07:51] and in strength
[1:07:54] and so satan i'm i'm ending this in a
[1:07:56] minute but satan has always through
[1:07:58] every age
[1:07:59] blamed blamed blamed the message of the
[1:08:02] hour blame the prophets you you do you
[1:08:05] wonder why there's so much criticism
[1:08:07] towards our prophet we'll look to the
[1:08:09] bible they were always criticized nobody
[1:08:11] believed them hardly at all
[1:08:14] the pharisees garnished the tombs of the
[1:08:16] prophets and jesus said you're
[1:08:19] garnishing and polishing their tombs and
[1:08:21] you're the one who put them in the tomb
[1:08:26] put them in the tomb
[1:08:28] this prophet isn't the first one to be
[1:08:29] criticized and satan behind putting the
[1:08:32] word down putting the present truth but
[1:08:33] i got something to say as i closed this
[1:08:35] this morning
[1:08:36] i got something to say to the devil who
[1:08:39] is you know let me say to him first he
[1:08:42] is always blaming you he is always
[1:08:45] blaming the message he was always
[1:08:47] blaming others and he
[1:08:49] is convicted satan is guilty in every
[1:08:53] generation he's guilty
[1:08:57] he's a guilty creature this morning
[1:09:01] he's been condemned he's under the
[1:09:03] judgments of god his days are numbered
[1:09:05] that's why i believe that he's fighting
[1:09:08] so much internally and uh in in every
[1:09:10] way fighting our church fighting you
[1:09:12] think it's the only one
[1:09:14] satan is fighting churches i just talked
[1:09:16] to a pastor yesterday and they were
[1:09:18] saying this that and we're talking about
[1:09:19] different splits and different things
[1:09:20] going on is there's an intensity and
[1:09:22] satan trying to cause splits and
[1:09:24] everything and brother barry he just
[1:09:26] said to me this there's no sense in us
[1:09:28] talking about those he said i've got it
[1:09:29] in my church i said i got it because why
[1:09:31] it's not people it's the devil his days
[1:09:34] are numbered he's trying to split
[1:09:36] oneness
[1:09:37] [Applause]
[1:09:40] i got news for this convicted creature
[1:09:43] this this one that's under
[1:09:46] judgments are hanging over this
[1:09:48] diablo
[1:09:49] judgments are hanging over him and he's
[1:09:52] still trying to blame the message and
[1:09:54] blame everybody else he won't take
[1:09:56] responsibility for what he's done
[1:09:57] throughout the ages i got this news for
[1:10:00] satan this morning and for you and me as
[1:10:02] well
[1:10:03] the truth
[1:10:04] is marching on
[1:10:09] satan
[1:10:11] isn't it amazing
[1:10:13] that he's always blamed the truth and
[1:10:15] the prophets of every generation and
[1:10:17] guess what
[1:10:18] the truth is still here
[1:10:20] in this bible there's prophets that
[1:10:23] satan condemned and spoke against and
[1:10:25] tore down and fought against and guess
[1:10:27] what the truth marched on and they're
[1:10:30] still in this bible and we're still
[1:10:32] feeding on it satan i want to remind you
[1:10:34] you can never destroy the truth of god's
[1:10:38] word
[1:10:40] can't do it
[1:10:43] and so i can use that to say in
[1:10:45] situations sometimes when i'm counseling
[1:10:46] you
[1:10:47] be patient
[1:10:49] because the truth
[1:10:50] will always come out
[1:10:53] god is a defender of truth
[1:10:58] the hardest thing is to wait till it
[1:10:59] comes out
[1:11:01] we want to act
[1:11:03] quickly
[1:11:05] but the truth is marching on
[1:11:08] you can't destroy this message you can't
[1:11:10] destroy the prophets that they came from
[1:11:11] god you can't destroy the influence of

[1:12:42] julia ward howell 1819-1910
[1:12:46] gave the united states and the world
[1:12:48] some of the most
[1:12:49] inspirational words ever written and she
[1:12:50] penned the battle hymn of republic
[1:12:53] public i don't know if you have that
[1:12:54] sister genie up there she pinned the
[1:12:56] battle hymn of republic in november of
[1:12:58] 1861 during a wartime tour of washington
[1:13:02] dc as americans realize with gloom that
[1:13:06] the seven month old civil war would be
[1:13:09] longer
[1:13:10] darker and deadlier than it was
[1:13:13] anticipated
[1:13:15] so she's right there in the middle of it
[1:13:16] she's watching she's watching the
[1:13:18] campfire she's watching the things and
[1:13:20] they realize this isn't going to be over
[1:13:21] any time school anytime soon this can be
[1:13:23] a fight it's going to be a fight a lot
[1:13:25] of lives are going to be lost and they
[1:13:26] knew that
[1:13:27] they knew thousands of lives one of the
[1:13:29] worst wars ever and more lives lost than
[1:13:31] just about any other war and they knew
[1:13:34] it and it was coming but you know what
[1:13:35] the fight was over
[1:13:36] you know what the fight was over the
[1:13:38] truth
[1:13:40] that all men are created equal
[1:13:44] but there's going to have to be a fight
[1:13:47] there's going to have to be men give
[1:13:49] their lives
[1:13:50] for truth
[1:13:51] how many know
[1:13:52] your freedom today wasn't free
[1:14:00] but this war was fought for truth i
[1:14:03] would like to say lord help me and help
[1:14:06] us that if we go to fighting
[1:14:08] that we fight with the right spirit and
[1:14:11] that our fight is not a personal fight
[1:14:14] but it's a fight for truth
[1:14:19] can i have some resolve from some
[1:14:21] soldiers here this morning
[1:14:23] when i fight i'm going to fight with the
[1:14:24] love of god i'm going to fight the right
[1:14:26] spirit but i always will fight for the
[1:14:29] truth
[1:14:31] i know i'm on the right side if i'm
[1:14:33] fighting for truth
[1:14:35] she pinned this song how's masterpiece
[1:14:37] has been called america's fight song
[1:14:40] glory glory hallelujah his truth
[1:14:43] is marching on
[1:14:45] it's been called the fight song its
[1:14:46] lyrics inspired the united states to
[1:14:48] spiritual resolve and sacrifice the
[1:14:50] words tell the biblical heroic story of
[1:14:53] the union soldiers marching to their
[1:14:54] death in the name of christ to vanquish
[1:14:56] slavery
[1:14:58] so they're marching in the name of
[1:14:59] christ and her songs in the lyrics we
[1:15:02] won't go through all of them
[1:15:06] their lyrics intertwine with
[1:15:08] scripture especially when she says the
[1:15:10] word
[1:15:11] as he died to make men holy
[1:15:13] we die to make when free
[1:15:15] it's a link between what christ has done
[1:15:17] for us spiritually and what we have to
[1:15:19] do in war sometimes to fight for a truth
[1:15:22] and lives are lost and so this is all
[1:15:25] intermingled and it says the words tell
[1:15:27] the biblically
[1:15:29] um
[1:15:30] heroic story of union soldiers marching
[1:15:32] to their death in the name of christ to
[1:15:35] vanquish
[1:15:36] slavery as he died to make men holy let
[1:15:40] us die to make men free his truth is
[1:15:43] marching on
[1:15:49] and she describes being in these camps
[1:15:52] and
[1:15:53] in history in the civil war describes
[1:15:55] them men learning this song
[1:15:58] by memory
[1:16:00] and singing this song the night before
[1:16:02] they were ready to go into war
[1:16:04] most of them knowing they would die the
[1:16:06] next day
[1:16:07] there was hundreds of thousands that
[1:16:09] knew we will not survive this battle
[1:16:11] tomorrow
[1:16:12] but we're going to sing this song
[1:16:14] because if we die
[1:16:16] truth will march on
[1:16:20] if i have losses in it
[1:16:22] it doesn't matter i'm gonna fight anyway
[1:16:24] and i'm gonna die because i'm not
[1:16:26] fighting against a person that was the
[1:16:28] nice thing about the civil war a few
[1:16:30] people it became personal but most
[1:16:33] people it wasn't personable
[1:16:35] it wasn't a personal thing against their
[1:16:37] brothers in the south there was great
[1:16:38] respect it was a fight
[1:16:41] for truth
[1:16:44] i pray we can do that
[1:16:46] i pray we can do that because friends
[1:16:49] his truth
[1:16:51] my knives have seen the glory of the
[1:16:52] coming of the lord
[1:16:54] he's trampling out the vintage where the
[1:16:56] grapes of wrath are stored
[1:16:58] he has loosed the faithful lightning of
[1:17:00] his terrible swift sword his truth is
[1:17:03] marching on

[1:17:47] fighting is okay if you're fighting to
[1:17:49] get to the truth
[1:17:52] not fighting one another and against one
[1:17:54] another but we rest that the truth will
[1:17:58] always win
[1:17:59] you start blaming the message you're
[1:18:01] blaming everybody else
[1:18:03] you're on your promise you're fighting
[1:18:04] against the wrong thing

[1:18:10] for truth and no matter how much the
[1:18:12] devil tries to knock it out
[1:18:14] his truth here we are friends
[1:18:17] he's never been able to trample out the
[1:18:19] truth
[1:18:20] it's still here despite what you would
[1:18:22] think of me and what i would think of
[1:18:23] you we go through seasons or whatever

[1:22:46] i concluded the wrong way forgive me
[1:22:48] father every time i did it i ended up in
[1:22:51] bondage
[1:22:53] ended up breaking relationship forgive
[1:22:55] me lord
[1:22:56] but may i be in all these be patient
[1:23:00] waiting
[1:23:01] may we be lovers of the truth we know
[1:23:03] the bible says in the last days
[1:23:06] they would be lovers of pleasures more
[1:23:07] than lovers of god
[1:23:09] may we not just be lovers of god but
[1:23:11] lovers of truth
[1:23:13] always always
[1:23:15] seeking the truth

[1:23:30] so help us lord as christians bring the
[1:23:32] true conviction in our hearts lord

[1:23:36] marriages i've talked about children
[1:23:39] i've talked about brothers and sisters
[1:23:42] just trying to talk about all the
[1:23:43] interactions with other human beings
[1:23:45] that we have
[1:23:47] we want good solid
[1:23:50] healthy free
[1:23:52] relationships with one another
[1:23:54] and we can only find that when we're
[1:23:56] rooted and anchored in our relationship
[1:23:59] with you i pray lord that if there's a
[1:24:02] wall up between the person that's
[1:24:04] listening to me and you
[1:24:05] i pray you'll break that wall down lord
[1:24:08] i pray that they would access to you
[1:24:10] they break that wall down casting down
[1:24:12] imagination everything high thing that
[1:24:14] exalts itself above the knowledge of god
[1:24:17] that there'd be
[1:24:18] open communion and fellowship with all
[1:24:21] sins under the blood and we could freely
[1:24:24] talk to you lord
[1:24:26] and then lord may it bring such a divine
[1:24:28] love breaking in our hearts that we'd be
[1:24:29] able to reach out
[1:24:31] and say i love you no matter what you
[1:24:33] have done to me and no matter what you
[1:24:35] have said no matter what it is i'm gonna
[1:24:38] love you anyway

[1:24:42] gonna own up to it help us lord to grow
[1:24:44] in maturity as the the lady there said
[1:24:47] on the quote from the one
[1:24:50] person that i read
[1:24:51] it's children sometimes that we see
[1:24:53] these immaturities and blaming others

[1:24:58] please forgive us help us father
[1:25:02] help us to mature as sons and daughters
[1:25:04] of god
