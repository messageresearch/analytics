[0:00] chapter five we will spend some time in
[0:02] the word
[0:03] and we welcome brother tim mills family
[0:06] his mom his aunt
[0:07] his two children it's good to have you
[0:09] all today god bless you any other
[0:10] visitors i notice the townsends are in
[0:12] today as well
[0:13] god bless you brother sister townsend
[0:15] and all the children
[0:16] we appreciate you being with us and any
[0:18] other visitors god bless you
[0:19] and it's a good day today to be a
[0:21] christian it's a good day to hold to the
[0:23] rock of christ
[0:25] it's good to have your life established
[0:27] upon the rock of god
[0:28] everything else is sinking sand
[0:31] everything else is shifting sand
[0:33] build your life upon the rock and that's
[0:34] one of the reasons why we come to church
[0:36] can you say amen
[0:37] we read from the word and she asked the
[0:39] lord to give us a revelation because a
[0:41] revelation
[0:42] is the rock that we build our lives upon
[0:44] life is not complete without jesus
[0:46] christ
[0:47] amen life is not you can have a lot of
[0:49] good things in life but life is not
[0:51] complete without him
[0:53] so second corinthians chapter 5 and i
[0:55] read this
[0:56] scripture a few weeks ago and we've been
[0:59] on a little series here talking about
[1:01] our participation in creation a lot of
[1:04] people wouldn't think that we
[1:05] participate in the lord's creation
[1:07] of new creatures but we do we
[1:09] participated in our words that we say
[1:11] and pass on to other people
[1:13] things that we know by the holy spirit
[1:14] within us and so i want to take a
[1:17] portion and get back to second
[1:18] corinthians 5
[1:19] today for a short time and i want you to
[1:21] really be listening i believe the lord
[1:23] has something for us here
[1:24] let's just start at verse 18.
[1:28] verse excuse me verse 17.
[1:33] no it wouldn't be that it would be all
[1:35] the way back up
[1:38] to
[1:44] you think the preacher knows you know
[1:45] where to start
[1:47] somebody says just pick one
[1:50] verse 14 for the love of christ
[1:53] constraineth
[1:54] us because we thus judge that if one
[1:57] died i'll use this microphone now
[2:00] that if one died
[2:04] the love of christ concrete because we
[2:06] judge that if one died for all
[2:08] then we're all dead and that he died for
[2:10] all
[2:11] that they which should not they which
[2:14] live
[2:15] should not henceforth live unto
[2:17] themselves
[2:18] but unto him which died for them and
[2:20] rose again
[2:21] wherefore henceforth know we know man
[2:24] after the flesh
[2:25] yea though we known christ after the
[2:27] flesh yet no now henceforth
[2:29] know we him no more therefore if any man
[2:33] be in christ he is a new creature
[2:35] old things are passed away behold all
[2:38] things
[2:38] become new you notice that new creation
[2:41] there and the new creation is christ
[2:43] coming in you that's by creation
[2:45] that's not by just you giving your heart
[2:47] to the lord god
[2:48] god brings the new man christ in you and
[2:50] that's a new creation
[2:52] and all things are of god who hath
[2:54] reconciled us to himself by jesus christ
[2:57] and hath given to us the ministry of
[2:59] reconciliation
[3:00] today my subject is this reconciliation
[3:03] verse 18
[3:04] all things are of god who hath
[3:06] reconciled us to himself
[3:08] by jesus christ and hath given to us the
[3:11] ministry
[3:12] of reconciliation to wit that god was in
[3:16] christ
[3:17] reconciling the world to himself i want
[3:19] you just
[3:20] because of father's day i want you to
[3:22] word it this way is that the father
[3:24] was in christ the word pulling and
[3:27] drawing and reconciling
[3:29] his children back to himself the father
[3:33] was in christ but what was in there he
[3:35] was reconciling his children
[3:37] back to himself to wit that god was in
[3:41] christ
[3:41] reconciling the world unto himself not
[3:44] imputing their trespasses unto them
[3:46] and hath committed unto us the word
[3:50] of reconciliation now then we are ba
[3:53] ambassadors for christ as though god did
[3:56] beseech you by us
[3:58] we pray you in christ said
[4:01] be ye reconciled to god what a powerful
[4:04] statement that paul can make
[4:06] and if you have christ in you you can
[4:08] make there's a cry in our hearts to this
[4:10] world
[4:11] to those that are his children come
[4:14] be reconciled back to god i'm standing
[4:17] in christ's dead
[4:19] be reconciled back to god amen heavenly
[4:22] father bless your word today
[4:24] bless those ears that here today whether
[4:26] it be streaming or in the building today
[4:28] we just pray
[4:29] that hearts would open up to your word
[4:32] and as we spend this time with you
[4:34] we pray that the holy ghost that is so
[4:36] real among us we
[4:37] felt your presence here this morning
[4:39] come and be real to us speak to us
[4:42] give us that revelation from your throne
[4:44] i pray and lord may the relationship
[4:46] with you be closer than it has ever been
[4:48] because of the words that are spoken
[4:50] this war morning we commit the service
[4:52] holy to you
[4:53] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[4:55] ask it amen and amen
[4:58] amen god bless you shake someone's hand
[5:00] before you're seated this morning
[5:01] god bless you each one it's good to have
[5:03] you in the service
[5:04] amen
[5:08] paul says here that he was given the
[5:10] ministry
[5:12] of reconciliation that's quite a
[5:14] powerful statement
[5:15] that it wasn't just that god was in
[5:18] christ but the
[5:19] ministry of reconciling
[5:22] children back to the father come into
[5:25] paul's hands and paul's words that he
[5:27] spoke
[5:28] and this is what we've been speaking on
[5:30] the power of our words because
[5:32] god didn't just make us christians just
[5:34] so that we can be delivered
[5:35] but he made us christians so that the
[5:37] words we speak from christ within us
[5:39] can bring deliverance to someone else
[5:42] this isn't a selfish thing that i have
[5:44] the lord
[5:44] and it's just me and the lord but god
[5:47] puts you in his body and fills you with
[5:49] himself
[5:50] so that you can give the kingdom to
[5:52] someone else that you can preach the
[5:54] kingdom to someone else
[5:55] you may not be a preacher behind this
[5:57] pulpit but god gives you something
[5:59] so that you can speak words of life to
[6:01] someone else
[6:02] remember last sunday solomon said in the
[6:05] bible
[6:06] death and life are in the power of the
[6:08] tongue your words can speak death to
[6:10] someone
[6:11] but your words can also speak life to
[6:13] someone
[6:14] and for christians we can speak life
[6:16] because we have life
[6:18] we can speak life to someone because we
[6:20] have life
[6:21] to give to someone and so this
[6:24] word of reconciliation i want to do i
[6:27] wanted a little bit this morning i want
[6:28] to title this message
[6:30] the father reconciled with his children
[6:32] and fit right in with father's day
[6:34] the father being reconciled with his
[6:37] children
[6:38] and so this word of reconciliation not
[6:40] only did paul have it
[6:42] but we are given that as well and we are
[6:45] given words that have power within them
[6:47] if we have the holy ghost sons and
[6:50] daughters of god
[6:52] become reconciled with their father even
[6:55] today
[6:56] because the very reason that we're still
[6:58] here and not in heaven yet
[6:59] is there still some children to be
[7:01] reconciled with the father
[7:04] we in the bride we call it the seed of
[7:06] god one of the reasons we're still here
[7:08] is there's still some seed of god out
[7:10] there there's still some children of god
[7:12] out there
[7:12] and one of the reasons we're not gone
[7:14] yet in a rapture is because
[7:16] there's still children to be reconciled
[7:19] with the father
[7:20] that might be your child that might be
[7:22] your son or daughter
[7:23] that's away from the lord that might be
[7:25] you sitting here this morning
[7:26] that might be a stranger that you've
[7:28] never met but you'll meet them this week
[7:30] and you'll say something to them they're
[7:32] still children
[7:33] to be reconciled with the heavenly
[7:35] father and you
[7:36] will be used to reconcile that
[7:41] amen and so that that's been uh the the
[7:44] a theme that i've been and talking about
[7:46] but i i want to
[7:48] we've been talking about how god does
[7:49] that how does he reconcile how does he
[7:51] draw life
[7:52] how does he pull that christ out of
[7:54] someone and we've been speaking
[7:56] very specifically in the last few
[7:58] services about how
[8:00] he does it but it's god reconciling do
[8:02] you want anybody want to know what the
[8:04] message of the last days
[8:05] is the message of the last days is
[8:08] really
[8:08] god it's the word coming to us to bring
[8:11] sons and daughters back to god
[8:14] that's what the message is is to bring
[8:16] sons and daughters of god
[8:17] who are alienated from god who are away
[8:20] from god
[8:21] to draw them back to pull them back to
[8:23] speak a word
[8:24] to draw his sons back into his kingdom
[8:28] that's what the message was set for
[8:30] people are saying that the message is
[8:32] this that and the other and
[8:33] and doubting it and making it a dress
[8:36] code or whatever it is
[8:37] that's all part of it but i don't look
[8:39] at it that way i look at it his word
[8:41] came to us because jesus christ is the
[8:44] word
[8:45] and he said he would come in the last
[8:46] days and speak his word
[8:48] and his word is a word of reconciliation
[8:52] bringing his sons and daughters back can
[8:54] you say amen
[8:55] and that's what jesus said one place he
[8:57] says when
[8:58] one sinner repenteth all of heaven
[9:01] has a shouting time when one sinner
[9:04] comes back to the father
[9:06] then all of heaven rejoices what makes
[9:09] heaven rejoice
[9:12] it's when one of his sons is reconciled
[9:15] back to him
[9:18] that's why we rejoice in that because
[9:20] all of heaven is rejoicing
[9:22] what makes heaven rejoice what makes
[9:24] heaven what makes the whole of heaven
[9:26] get excited is when one sinner comes
[9:28] back the son comes back
[9:30] and so now we have a message a word it's
[9:33] a word of reconciliation
[9:35] god speaks in the last days and when he
[9:37] speaks that message is the purpose of it
[9:40] is a word to bring sons and daughters
[9:43] back
[9:43] into fellowship again with the father
[9:47] praise the lord the word the word
[9:49] reconciliation
[9:50] means the restoration of friendly
[9:52] relations
[9:54] it means also the action of making one
[9:57] view or believe
[9:58] the belief compatible with another i
[10:01] like the first
[10:02] uh meaning to it and also the in the
[10:04] greek meeting it's
[10:05] similar the restoration of friendly
[10:08] relations
[10:09] in other words you're not on friendly
[10:10] relations
[10:12] there's been a a disfellowship there's
[10:14] been a wall that's come up
[10:17] between you and god and so now to
[10:20] reconcile that
[10:21] it means that it's to bring a
[10:23] restoration to fellowship
[10:25] a restoration and this reconciling is
[10:27] such an important word
[10:29] not only to god but also in our family
[10:31] relationships and also in marriage
[10:33] relationships
[10:34] how many has ever heard the term when
[10:36] someone gets a divorce a lot of times
[10:38] the only reason the only reason
[10:40] is that it's irreconcilable differences
[10:43] that's what they write in the sheet of
[10:44] paper
[10:45] irreconcilable differences it may not be
[10:48] something as extreme as adultery or
[10:50] something like that
[10:50] but it's just they've tried so hard and
[10:53] they cannot reconcile their differences
[10:56] so that's what they have a grounds for a
[10:58] divorce for
[10:59] we cannot reconcile what is shame in
[11:01] this age that things can't be reconciled
[11:04] but let me tell you about a father let
[11:06] me tell you about a god this morning
[11:08] for marriage for family whoever it is
[11:10] when he comes in your heart
[11:11] you're serving a god that knows about
[11:14] reconciliation
[11:15] he knows how to do reconciliation he
[11:18] knows how to restore
[11:20] a marriage and the reason he knows how
[11:24] to bring it back together again and
[11:25] take down all the walls is because he's
[11:28] had to do that with you
[11:29] he's had to take every wall down and he
[11:32] come running
[11:33] for you to find you you're not looking
[11:36] for him
[11:37] but he loves you so much the father's
[11:39] coming looking for you
[11:42] you're my child and i want to see you
[11:44] back in fellowship with me
[11:47] even after the fall when they fell in
[11:49] sin and they're hiding in the bushes and
[11:51] they're hiding there
[11:52] covering themselves with their own
[11:54] little fig leaf religion even then
[11:56] it was god who's coming to find his son
[11:59] and say adam
[12:00] where are you it wasn't us saying god i
[12:02] need you i need help
[12:03] it was god running towards his children
[12:05] what happened
[12:06] where are you at why are you hiding oh
[12:09] god we did this and then
[12:10] we fell in sin he says come out of those
[12:12] bushes i'm going to give you a blood
[12:15] i'm going to give you an atonement
[12:16] brother joel spoke on atonement
[12:18] wednesday night
[12:18] i'm going to give you a place of
[12:20] fellowship again because i'm
[12:22] crying for fellowship with my children
[12:29] a third of the angels fell by lucifer's
[12:32] deception
[12:33] and god never went after them but one
[12:36] son of god
[12:38] falls one daughter of god falls and god
[12:40] is rushing to them
[12:42] saying where are you that's how much he
[12:45] loves you this morning
[12:47] a third of the angels and there's no
[12:49] word that god went after them
[12:50] but one son and one daughter that got
[12:52] away from god and said
[12:54] he's running towards them aren't you
[12:56] glad this morning it's not you running
[12:57] towards god
[12:58] but it's him finding you
[13:01] we serve of god of reconciliation
[13:07] we serve of god of restoration
[13:11] in the greek uh reconcile means
[13:16] and i can't pronounce the greek word
[13:18] apocalso
[13:21] to fully reconcile and one writer says
[13:24] this reconciliation
[13:26] completely transforms someone from one
[13:28] condition to another
[13:30] it removes all the enmity and
[13:34] leaves no hindrance to peace and unity
[13:37] it removes all the walls it removes the
[13:40] enmity that means
[13:41] you become an enemy of god you become
[13:43] against god
[13:45] and in any relationship you become
[13:47] enemies to one another
[13:48] here's a power in reconciliation
[13:51] that removes all enmity
[13:55] and leaves no hindrance to peace
[13:58] and unity that's why we sing the song
[14:01] saying it wednesday night after our
[14:02] brother joelle spoke on atonement
[14:05] he is our peace he is our peace who has
[14:09] broken down
[14:10] the wall he brings peace in the
[14:14] relationship when there wasn't
[14:16] peace between us if you're without god
[14:18] this morning there's no peace between
[14:19] you and god
[14:20] and there's probably not a lot of peace
[14:21] with other people as well
[14:23] because how can you have the proper
[14:25] peace with other people
[14:27] if you haven't made peace with god
[14:30] you and god are at odds oh you may pray
[14:32] when you're an emergency but i'm not
[14:33] talking about that i'm talking about
[14:34] fellowship i'm talking about there's
[14:36] nothing between you and god
[14:37] there's no sin there's no love there's
[14:39] no hindrance there's harmony and
[14:41] fellowship between you and god
[14:42] and god has a way of drawing you that he
[14:45] removes
[14:46] all the hindrances to peace and unity
[14:48] and you are one
[14:49] with the heavenly father
[14:54] paul says in the bible that at that time
[14:56] ye were without christ
[14:59] and i'm reading these scriptures because
[15:02] in the meaning they used this word
[15:03] enmity
[15:04] there was a time you were without christ
[15:06] being aliens i don't know if you can
[15:07] find the scripture brothers
[15:09] being aliens from the commonwealth of
[15:10] israel and strangers from the covenants
[15:12] of the promise
[15:13] having no hope and without god in the
[15:16] world
[15:17] but now in christ jesus ye
[15:20] who sometimes were far off are made nigh
[15:24] by the blood of jesus christ for he is
[15:27] our peace
[15:28] who hath made both one and hath broken
[15:31] down the middle wall of partition
[15:34] between us having abolished in the flesh
[15:36] the enmity
[15:38] even the law of commandments contained
[15:40] in ordinances for to make in himself of
[15:42] twain
[15:43] one new man so making peace and that he
[15:46] might reconcile both unto god
[15:48] in one body by the cross having slain
[15:52] the enmity thereof there's that word
[15:53] enmity again there's the word aliens we
[15:56] were aliens
[15:57] we we were without god we were we were
[16:00] we were not
[16:01] nigh to god but his blood made us nigh
[16:06] colossians 1 20 if you brothers can pull
[16:08] it up having made
[16:09] peace through the blood of his cross
[16:13] having made peace through the blood of
[16:15] his cross would you have that
[16:17] colossians 1 20 having made peace
[16:19] through the blood of his cross
[16:21] by him to reconcile all things
[16:24] unto himself by him i say
[16:27] whether they be things in earth or
[16:30] things in heaven
[16:31] and you that were sometimes alienated
[16:34] there it is again
[16:35] he called us aliens before and now we're
[16:38] alien and you who were sometimes
[16:40] alienated and listen to this and enemies
[16:43] in your mind by wicked works
[16:45] yet now hath god reconciled
[16:48] in the body of his flesh through that to
[16:50] present you holy
[16:52] unblameable unreprovable in his sight my
[16:56] i say praise the lord
[16:59] aliens distant from god can you say amen
[17:03] and who made the effort first
[17:06] to that you were no longer an alien
[17:09] god did through his blood
[17:13] leave those scriptures up god did
[17:15] through his blood
[17:16] he said that in the body was flesh to
[17:19] present you
[17:20] so he doesn't just bring you and
[17:21] reconcile you and and by the way i don't
[17:23] have time to get into this
[17:25] reconciliation is deeper than just
[17:27] forgiveness and repentance
[17:30] reconciliation is deeper than just
[17:33] repentance and forgiveness
[17:36] you can forgive someone but not be
[17:38] reconciled with them
[17:42] you can repent but there's another thing
[17:44] of reconciling
[17:47] god's power is not just and that's a lot
[17:49] of christianity
[17:50] it's people come and repent but they
[17:52] haven't been reconciled in a fellowship
[17:53] with god yet
[17:55] the message came to reconcile us with
[17:57] god sons and daughters back in eden
[17:59] again in fellowship with him
[18:01] amen so now uh when we look at words
[18:05] like aliens and you're distant from god
[18:08] but you see in an enmity against uh you
[18:11] as his child
[18:12] were an enemy against your father i know
[18:14] we don't like to hear that
[18:15] but without god we are actually an
[18:18] enmity we're at enmity with god
[18:20] we're an enemy of god you say well i
[18:22] wasn't an enemy of god
[18:24] until you get the new birth you're
[18:26] actually not you're actually an enemy of
[18:27] god
[18:29] say where did you get that i just read
[18:30] it to you in the bible we're an enemy
[18:33] against god we are enemies against him
[18:35] hard to swallow actually it says in
[18:38] james 4 4 which
[18:39] said sonny james is from the show me
[18:42] state and he's pretty straight about
[18:43] stuff
[18:44] brother james in the bible this is the
[18:46] way he said it james 4 4 you can bring
[18:48] the scripture up james 4 and verse 4
[18:50] ye adulterers and adulteresses james is
[18:53] pretty straight
[18:54] ye adulterers and your adulteresses know
[18:57] ye not that the friendship of the world
[19:00] is enmity with god whosoever therefore
[19:03] will be a friend of the world
[19:05] is an enemy of god don't forget
[19:09] brother paul didn't say that your bible
[19:11] that you read
[19:12] says can i have that scripture
[19:16] i sure love the scriptures to be up so
[19:18] you people can see them james 4 and
[19:20] verse 4
[19:21] ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye
[19:23] not that the friendship
[19:24] of the world is enmity with god
[19:27] whosoever therefore
[19:30] whosoever therefore will be a friend of
[19:32] the world is an
[19:33] enemy of god
[19:37] amen praise the lord so it wasn't god
[19:40] that was enemy against us it wasn't god
[19:42] that had done us wrong
[19:43] we have a perfect heavenly father this
[19:45] morning
[19:49] but us without god and not in fellowship
[19:51] with god and friendship with the world
[19:54] we're at enmity against god we're
[19:57] fighting against
[19:58] god not me i'm a good person listen
[20:01] great
[20:01] tremendous but listen if you're not in
[20:03] fellowship with him by the blood of
[20:05] jesus
[20:06] christ your friendship with the world
[20:09] is an enemy against god and the only way
[20:12] to break that
[20:13] that enmity is the blood of jesus christ
[20:16] and the father coming to you and you
[20:17] being reconciled with him
[20:20] it's the only answer since you're so
[20:23] quiet here this morning i'll just
[20:24] slow down and be quiet myself
[20:29] let me take a minute and just a minute
[20:32] and talk about the detachment of fathers
[20:37] in this generation from their children
[20:41] it is one of the worst problems that we
[20:46] have fathers
[20:48] emotionally detached for the most part
[20:50] emotionally detached
[20:53] from their children sometimes they
[20:55] provide for them
[20:56] sometimes they do everything for them
[20:58] but they're detached and that effect
[21:01] has symptoms to it on a culture
[21:05] you can have mom there and mom's one
[21:06] thing but
[21:08] and a lot of times mom is the hands-on
[21:10] person which she's supposed to be
[21:12] but because of that dad backs off and
[21:14] dad is emotionally detached from his
[21:16] children
[21:16] there's a lot of symptoms that come in
[21:18] culture because fathers are detached
[21:20] from the children
[21:21] they're not reconciled with their
[21:23] children and the distance starts when
[21:24] they're young sometimes
[21:25] and gets worse and worse and worse and
[21:27] worse i tell you you ought to thank god
[21:29] today if you have a good father in this
[21:31] life you ought to raise your hand say
[21:32] thank you lord that i had a good father
[21:34] that wasn't emotionally detached and
[21:36] wasn't just not there
[21:38] and you had a good relationship with him
[21:40] because we have some good ones
[21:42] but since it's father's day we have to
[21:43] talk about this whole culture a problem
[21:45] there's a theme in the bible of children
[21:48] being alienated from the heavenly father
[21:50] but the reason we were alienated was
[21:52] because of sin
[21:53] because of our sin can you say amen and
[21:56] then redemption throughout is throughout
[21:58] the bible
[21:58] the redemption says i'm bringing my
[22:01] children back
[22:02] i'm paying the price i'm bringing them
[22:04] back into fellowship again
[22:06] we didn't deserve that but god says i'll
[22:09] pay the price
[22:10] and i'm bringing my children back
[22:13] because he didn't fail us we failed him
[22:19] that's the difference in the culture of
[22:20] this world we have fathers that fail
[22:22] their children not all fathers
[22:23] but fathers fail their children they're
[22:25] looking as a young child
[22:27] to a connection with the father it is so
[22:29] important that teenage girls connect
[22:31] with their father
[22:32] even young girls it's not just mom but
[22:35] daddy's
[22:35] connect a girl develops a girl it's a
[22:38] confidence in herself
[22:40] a girl develops and if she doesn't get
[22:41] that attention from her father
[22:43] she'll seek that attention through the
[22:45] wrong type of boy
[22:47] it happens every day girls because
[22:50] daddy didn't connect and tell her she
[22:53] was pretty and all these other things
[22:54] and i heard somebody recently say father
[22:57] shouldn't say their
[22:58] their their daughters are pretty i don't
[22:59] know what where what in the world
[23:01] don't you know the heavenly father and
[23:03] how he compliments
[23:04] and he praises and he encourages his
[23:07] sons and daughters
[23:09] how can you miss that a father's power
[23:12] over a daughter to tell her
[23:13] she's pretty and she's valuable we'll
[23:15] give her confidence in this life
[23:22] amen it's good to have you awake
[23:25] welcome back i finally found the thing
[23:29] that woke you up
[23:31] this is a this is a nash international
[23:34] problem
[23:35] father's detached and it has
[23:38] lots of symptoms to us that we won't
[23:40] spend a lot of time on this
[23:41] but redemption the body says he'll bring
[23:43] us back
[23:44] so this wall this detachment if it's
[23:47] spoken of in the bible with our heavenly
[23:49] father
[23:50] then this is a prevalent problem in our
[23:52] generation more than any other
[23:54] generation
[23:55] and there are clear symptoms to the
[23:57] failure of our culture
[23:59] that comes from children not having the
[24:01] best relationship with their fathers
[24:04] did you know that our ability and this
[24:06] is from
[24:08] this is from a psychologist did you know
[24:10] that our ability to sustain
[24:12] satisfying or committed relationships
[24:16] to find gratification in our work life
[24:19] to be effective parents
[24:21] to speak up and assert ourselves is
[24:24] largely dependent on the relationship
[24:26] we had and have with our fathers
[24:30] let me read it again our ability to
[24:32] sustain satisfying and committed
[24:34] relationships in life
[24:35] to find gratification in our work life
[24:37] to be effective parents
[24:39] to speak up and assert ourselves is
[24:40] largely dependent on the relationship we
[24:42] have
[24:42] our fathers our relationship with our
[24:44] fathers is a powerful
[24:46] bond that's been rarely closely examined
[24:50] until recent years it was overlooked
[24:53] as a major influence on a child's
[24:55] development
[24:56] and quality of life as is the impact our
[24:59] relationship with our fathers have
[25:01] on our own mothers this relationship has
[25:04] an enormous
[25:05] and long-lasting influence on a child
[25:08] which continues
[25:09] throughout their adult life we might not
[25:11] realize it
[25:12] but countless areas that concern our
[25:15] personal lives
[25:16] and well-being are linked to the kind of
[25:18] relationship
[25:19] we had with our dads the biggest problem
[25:22] in relationship
[25:23] is usually the inability to commit the
[25:26] fear of abandonment the lack of
[25:28] communication
[25:29] poor emotional intelligence or
[25:31] understanding of ourselves
[25:33] and understanding our wife or our
[25:36] husband
[25:36] these are the things that come from it
[25:38] and it becomes it says because we got
[25:40] different type of dads
[25:41] in this world we've got the absent dad
[25:44] we've got the divorced
[25:45] dad we've got the addicted dad we've got
[25:48] the distant dad
[25:49] we've got the critical dad we've got the
[25:51] rejecting neglecting dad
[25:53] we've got the unfaithful dad we've got
[25:56] the doting dad
[25:57] we've got the seductive dad we've got
[25:59] the abandoner dad
[26:01] we've got the deceased dad we've got the
[26:04] taken
[26:04] dad who's separated from his children
[26:06] and we have the narcissist dad
[26:08] this is what they've diagnosed is the
[26:10] wrong kind of dads in life and we see
[26:12] all the symptoms that come because of
[26:15] these type of deaths
[26:16] once again raise your hand thank god if
[26:18] you didn't have a lot of these
[26:19] characteristics in your father
[26:20] there is no perfect father in this life
[26:26] the perfect father we look to is our
[26:28] heavenly father
[26:29] he's the perfect father and thank god we
[26:31] have one as an image to look to
[26:34] but thank god if you didn't have a lot
[26:36] of this stuff but this is prevalent in
[26:37] our society
[26:38] these type of dads and there are
[26:40] symptoms in
[26:41] our culture because of all i could read
[26:45] the definition of all this i didn't want
[26:46] to spend much time on this
[26:47] because i don't like psychology just to
[26:49] diagnose the problem
[26:50] i think they diagnosed it right but i
[26:52] have the answer this morning
[26:54] i don't like just to talk about our
[26:55] problems because we get in the molly
[26:57] grubs about and think there's no hope
[26:59] there is hope this morning in our
[27:00] heavenly father and whatever
[27:02] relationship has been damaged or
[27:04] destroyed there is
[27:06] healing in the heavenly father
[27:09] there's healing in the word
[27:12] praise the lord and this of course is
[27:16] because there's no
[27:17] perfect father in life we have all dealt
[27:20] with some of these at some level no
[27:22] doubt some of these types of fathers
[27:24] and sometimes there's reconciliation
[27:27] with them
[27:28] but sometimes there's never
[27:32] reconciliation
[27:34] and what do we do we grow as a christian
[27:36] anyway
[27:39] we can get beyond it anyway through the
[27:42] help of the lord
[27:44] and we forgive and we thank god for the
[27:47] good
[27:48] things that was in our father
[27:51] you can get over it you can be healed
[27:57] there one writer said there are no
[27:59] perfect parents
[28:01] and there are certainly no perfect
[28:03] children
[28:06] but there are plenty of perfect moments
[28:09] along the way
[28:11] can you say imagine plenty of perfect
[28:13] moments
[28:14] along the way and that's because of
[28:16] god's help that's because the presence
[28:18] of the lord
[28:19] that's because an image of our heavenly
[28:21] father can so
[28:23] affect a man and a mom and a dad that he
[28:26] can be influenced from that
[28:27] from our heavenly father's image and he
[28:30] can be a
[28:31] begin to express the image of what a
[28:34] real father is
[28:36] say what about all the past it can be
[28:38] forgiven
[28:40] it can be changed in 33 years
[28:44] 34 years of pastoring i've seen it
[28:46] happen over and over and over again
[28:49] god through his presence changing
[28:52] a narcissist father changing a father
[28:56] who abandons his family
[28:59] the power of god can do it is that okay
[29:01] with everybody
[29:03] but the biggest victory is to come to
[29:05] know the heavenly father
[29:07] who loves us in all the ways that we
[29:11] missed out let me say it again the
[29:14] greatest victory in a christian's life
[29:15] is that in the imperfections of our
[29:17] father on earth we come to know a
[29:19] heavenly father
[29:20] who loves us in all the ways that we
[29:23] missed out on
[29:26] in this relationship he didn't fail us
[29:29] we failed him
[29:30] we fell in sin we alienated ourself
[29:33] but then this father comes to us to pay
[29:36] the price
[29:37] to reconcile us back to him he paid the
[29:40] price to reconcile us back to him
[29:41] and then come closer to us because he
[29:44] wants
[29:44] friendly relationship and he gives us
[29:48] unconditional love because he's drawing
[29:50] us
[29:51] back in he loves us unconditionally
[29:56] it'd be like you had a father in this
[29:58] life and you hadn't been with him
[30:00] last night i was reading tons of stories
[30:02] that i could find
[30:03] of detached children from their fathers
[30:05] sometimes 20
[30:06] 30 years and a lot of times it wasn't
[30:09] the father's fault it was the child who
[30:11] went
[30:12] astray a child who married maybe the
[30:14] wrong person
[30:15] and that that mate pulled his the man
[30:18] away from his family couldn't see the
[30:19] grandkids couldn't see the father it was
[30:21] one father said
[30:22] 20 years 20 years and then all of a
[30:24] sudden he got a divorce from his wife
[30:25] and the doors open he had been sending
[30:27] letters he had been sending him and his
[30:28] wife
[30:29] just sending letters trying to make
[30:30] reconciliation trying to have some form
[30:33] of fellowship
[30:34] 20 years he shut them out i thought of
[30:36] ourselves friends
[30:37] how we can shut out the father's love
[30:40] can you say amen
[30:41] god trying to speak to you through
[30:42] ministers god trying to love you in
[30:44] different ways
[30:45] i'm trying to get a hold of you that's
[30:46] so you can be reconciled and you shut it
[30:48] out and shut it out and shut it out
[30:50] until finally something happened to open
[30:52] the door and he says finally now
[30:54] we're in fellowship we can see our
[30:55] grandkids and we've made reconciliation
[30:58] praise god if that can happen in that
[31:00] way then god can do it in our lives
[31:04] amen and so we we're the ones who fell
[31:07] away
[31:08] and it would be like a father if you
[31:10] haven't seen him in 20 years
[31:12] and you moved way far away from your
[31:15] father on earth and the father is
[31:16] sending you letters
[31:18] and he's trying to make contact maybe
[31:20] the letter's getting get to you
[31:21] maybe you turn down letters i'm making
[31:23] up my own story here but it's just
[31:25] as an example that he could be so far
[31:27] away and live in a different country
[31:29] and then and then you hear of him coming
[31:32] he's coming
[31:33] and he comes and he shows up at the
[31:35] service this morning
[31:36] first time you've seen him in 20 years
[31:39] you've got such
[31:39] bitterness in your heart sets such a
[31:42] feeling in your heart
[31:43] and now you haven't seen him because of
[31:45] you you haven't seen him and he pays
[31:47] five thousand dollars for a ticket he
[31:49] comes in and sits right beside you and
[31:51] you're going
[31:52] what are you doing here after 20 years
[31:54] what are you doing here
[31:55] he says i've come i've paid five
[31:57] thousand dollars for a ticket
[31:59] i've traveled all this way flew into a
[32:01] certain airport and i've come
[32:02] i haven't come to see america i haven't
[32:04] come to see new york i haven't come
[32:06] i've come for one purpose i've paid the
[32:09] price
[32:09] for one purpose is to sit here next to
[32:11] you and i'm asking for reconciliation
[32:17] that's our heavenly father that's how
[32:20] far he's willing to come
[32:23] to leave the portals of heaven
[32:27] and to come down among us what's the
[32:29] whole story of jesus christ
[32:31] the father coming down to become flesh
[32:35] so he can be reconciled with you you not
[32:38] the person sitting next to you
[32:39] reconciled with you the word is sent to
[32:42] every generation
[32:43] and in that word is the father
[32:46] how many know that jesus christ is the
[32:48] word jesus christ is not just the man
[32:50] 2000 years ago
[32:51] he is the word of every generation jesus
[32:54] is the word of every judge
[32:56] i can prove it to you by the bible moses
[32:58] left the comforts of egypt
[32:59] to follow the lord and he left the for
[33:01] the reproach of christ hebrews says for
[33:03] the reproach of christ how can you use
[33:05] christ in moses christ wasn't around oh
[33:06] yes he was
[33:07] the word of that day was christ and the
[33:10] word of every day of that hour is
[33:12] christ being expressed and in that word
[33:15] is the father
[33:16] that's how he comes to you through the
[33:18] word spoken by a prophet
[33:21] or spoken by a minister oh if god can
[33:25] let you
[33:25] look past the veil of all your
[33:28] hindrances and all your bitterness
[33:30] and all the flesh that you've seen and
[33:32] all the trouble that you've seen
[33:33] and look past the veil past the skin and
[33:37] see
[33:37] in the ministers and in the prophet it
[33:40] is your father
[33:41] in them speaking to be reconciled back
[33:44] to you
[33:46] but it's the skin test as i said last
[33:48] sunday it's always the skin test
[33:50] people don't believe it because they
[33:52] fail at the skin
[33:54] that god's hiding in but the father
[33:58] is in the word calling out to you
[34:03] the father came in the message of the
[34:06] last days
[34:09] and it's the father calling his children
[34:13] for this last days
[34:16] praise the lord why did you come and pay
[34:18] all this money why did you come from so
[34:20] far
[34:20] why did you pay that kind of money and
[34:23] your father says to get back in harmony
[34:25] and fellowship with you i'm here for one
[34:27] purpose
[34:28] i said i'm here for one purpose today
[34:33] i'm here in this church speaking to you
[34:37] for no other reason except for
[34:40] to say god is there anything that you
[34:43] can anoint in my words
[34:45] to draw your children closer to yourself
[34:51] i didn't come here to be seen i didn't
[34:53] come here for you to see
[34:55] my nice suit that has purple stripes
[34:57] through it and it's so nice
[34:59] i didn't come for you to see that
[35:01] although it is a pretty nice suit
[35:06] i didn't come here to be seen i didn't
[35:07] come here for lunch
[35:09] i didn't come i'm only here for one
[35:11] purpose and i can guarantee
[35:13] the heavenly father has been in this
[35:15] service and he's only come for one
[35:16] purpose
[35:17] it's because you're you're one of his
[35:20] children
[35:22] and he wants to be reconciled with you
[35:26] he doesn't just want this distant
[35:27] relationship he wants to he wants to be
[35:30] in fellowship with you
[35:31] like adam and eve were in the garden of
[35:33] eden no hindrances no sin
[35:35] everything's under the blood and there's
[35:38] open fellowship with one another
[35:40] and i'm not talking about the person
[35:41] next to you i'm talking to you he wants
[35:43] fellowship
[35:44] with you
[35:47] to get back in harmony with you so
[35:50] we'll just take the next step here just
[35:52] for a minute
[35:53] you still with me amen
[35:59] god reconciled us back to fellowship
[36:03] with himself
[36:05] through someone the bible says god
[36:09] was in christ reconciling the world to
[36:12] himself
[36:14] and so in order to reconcile he worked
[36:16] and spoke through someone
[36:18] and it was jesus christ the word that he
[36:20] came and spoke through
[36:22] everything that he did everything that
[36:24] christ was
[36:25] everything that he said had one great
[36:29] purpose it was to draw god's people in
[36:32] and restore them back to him there was a
[36:36] pull
[36:36] in jesus to attract people to him
[36:40] for the result of connecting them back
[36:42] to god people were drawn to them
[36:45] you know the scripture i mentioned about
[36:47] one sinner that repenteth all heaven
[36:48] rejoices
[36:49] that's scripture just before it comes a
[36:51] situation
[36:52] where jesus was in a house and all the
[36:54] sinners gathered around him
[36:56] all the people that were it wasn't the
[36:58] pharisees that it wasn't the religious
[37:00] people that gathered around jesus
[37:02] he was drawing sinners
[37:06] i always say what was it in jesus
[37:09] that was so attractive that the sinners
[37:12] felt comfortable to come and listen to
[37:14] him
[37:16] and religious people did not i wonder if
[37:19] that would happen today
[37:20] i wonder if all of our religious
[37:22] organizations
[37:24] and let me just say this our
[37:25] organizations not the people
[37:27] but our systems of organization i don't
[37:30] feel like the heavenly father uses them
[37:32] to reconcile children back to god
[37:34] i think they're just systems god's never
[37:37] used a system
[37:38] he didn't use it in the pharisees and
[37:39] sadducees he don't use it today
[37:41] but he uses his word through gospel
[37:44] ministers
[37:44] to reconcile his children back to
[37:46] himself i know that's a straight
[37:48] statement
[37:49] but god doesn't work through systems and
[37:50] all kinds of organized religion
[37:52] god has never worked through that god
[37:54] does not want to work through that
[37:56] he just wants to work through his word
[37:58] bring his presence
[37:59] and the father comes down in that word
[38:01] and draws his children to himself
[38:03] that's why you can have a person that's
[38:04] never been to a religious organization
[38:06] never walk through the door of a church
[38:08] and someone can witness to them
[38:10] and the power of god is in that witness
[38:11] and they come to the lord
[38:13] right there with never being in a church
[38:17] because this isn't based upon which
[38:18] church you go to isn't that the first
[38:20] question everybody asks you
[38:22] what's church do you i'm a christian
[38:23] which church do you go to why does that
[38:25] always have to be an issue
[38:26] which church do you go to this isn't a
[38:28] church identity
[38:30] this is an identity with jesus christ
[38:33] this gospel of redemption is about god
[38:37] coming and being reconciled with his
[38:39] sons and daughters
[38:40] and he has accomplished that not only
[38:42] through calvary but 2
[38:44] 000 years later he's come and opened his
[38:47] word to the people who through the seven
[38:48] seals were being revealed
[38:50] spoke through his messenger malachi 4
[38:52] 5-6
[38:53] and then now brings his word to us to
[38:55] bring all of his children
[38:57] back to his throne god the father was in
[39:01] the word
[39:02] reconciling the world to himself
[39:07] praise the lord so this text that he
[39:10] read
[39:11] is is has predestination
[39:14] this is why i preach and live paul has
[39:17] said i have this ministry of
[39:18] reconciliation now
[39:20] this is why i preach and live the truth
[39:22] to reconcile restore people back to god
[39:24] and god has committed to us the word of
[39:26] reconciliation as well
[39:27] we are standing in christ's dead this
[39:29] morning with the invitation
[39:31] come and be reconciled back to god
[39:40] but but i don't need to do anything
[39:42] further i'm a good person
[39:45] i think in our own eyes we're all a good
[39:49] person
[39:51] didn't the bible say every man is
[39:53] righteous in his own eyes
[39:55] if we're going to let us us diagnose
[39:56] ourselves we come out smelling pretty
[39:58] good sometimes
[40:01] don't we but when the word examines
[40:04] which is what we're supposed to be
[40:05] examined by says in first corinthians
[40:07] examine your own selves by what by
[40:09] yourselves no by the word
[40:11] then we see we need god then we see we
[40:14] fail
[40:15] then we see our imperfections and we
[40:17] look at the mirror of the word and thing
[40:18] about this mirror
[40:19] is that we're looking at it and it may
[40:21] reflect our imperfections but there's a
[40:23] power in here
[40:24] that we see the image and if we keep
[40:26] looking at this we're changed into the
[40:28] image of the heavenly father
[40:31] but we all come if we diagnose ourself
[40:33] we all come out smelling pretty good
[40:36] we all come out looking pretty good the
[40:39] gospel is not based upon
[40:41] just you being a good person because i
[40:44] can name a lot of rap
[40:45] artists a lot of movie stars
[40:48] speak against christ mock it mock it so
[40:52] i can't even say what they say
[40:54] but because they say they're a good
[40:56] person they're going to make it into
[40:57] heaven
[40:58] and if they ever ask me i would have to
[41:00] be truthful and say that's not how we
[41:02] make it
[41:03] to heaven see some of you have bought
[41:07] into a little bit of that idea
[41:09] if i can just be nice to people and be a
[41:11] good person i think you should be nice
[41:13] to people
[41:15] you should do that it's much nicer world
[41:18] it's a much nicer world if we're nice to
[41:20] people
[41:21] always be humble and kind
[41:24] tim mcgraw says oh it's so
[41:28] nice oh and teach your children i love
[41:30] that that's fine i love
[41:31] that somebody has those themes out
[41:33] always be humble and kind
[41:35] but it's interesting it's always without
[41:37] the word
[41:38] without christ without redemption
[41:41] without the blood
[41:43] and we can't be reconciled to god
[41:46] without
[41:47] the blood of jesus christ which is in
[41:50] his word
[41:52] and us embracing his word completely
[41:55] i take your word lord the blood and
[41:58] fellowship is in the word
[42:00] okay where are you getting your
[42:01] scriptures at
[42:03] you got scripture basis for that yes
[42:08] and i'm trying to think of it right now
[42:09] give me a minute
[42:12] got so many things going through my mind
[42:16] someone in first john where it says
[42:23] the blood he says by the blood
[42:27] by the word we have fellowship with one
[42:30] another
[42:31] and the blood of jesus christ cleanses
[42:33] us from all sin
[42:35] that's what it says so the blood is tied
[42:37] with the word
[42:39] and our fellowship with god and one
[42:41] another
[42:42] is tied to the blood and to the word
[42:45] and when man detach it from that then
[42:47] you're detaching from christ's
[42:49] redemption and the way he's said to do
[42:50] things
[42:51] it has to be through blood and his
[42:53] benefits of his blood
[42:55] is in the word i'm being real
[42:58] deep with you here this morning but i'm
[43:01] just asking you to think about it
[43:03] good people
[43:07] there'll probably be a lot of good
[43:09] people that don't make it to heaven
[43:15] because why they turn down
[43:19] the blood of jesus christ
[43:22] so that's a real straight statement but
[43:25] i don't like people to buy into the idea
[43:27] if i'm just kind
[43:29] i'll you know i'll get a free pass
[43:33] i won't even get that free pass
[43:36] i think we should be kind we think we
[43:38] should be loving and i think if you have
[43:39] christianity
[43:40] you'd be more loving and kind than
[43:42] anybody else
[43:44] you'd be this vicious mean person
[43:47] and claim christ i don't think that's
[43:49] right either but we'll get in
[43:51] because and then he says i've got to
[43:54] move along and close
[43:56] he says we having this ministry of
[43:58] reconciliation we know no man after the
[44:00] flesh because
[44:01] we are always looking in our witness for
[44:04] that part of christ within them
[44:05] to rise above all the sin and darkness
[44:09] and past to connect them back
[44:12] with christ connect connect them back
[44:15] with the father
[44:16] it's our ministry it's a believer's
[44:20] ministry the holy ghost
[44:21] how you have the ministry of
[44:23] reconciliation that's why you can't know
[44:25] any man after the flesh if you judge
[44:27] them by the flesh
[44:29] you'll say they'll never make it they'll
[44:30] never do you judge them by their past
[44:32] they'll never make it in but something
[44:34] within us has to look
[44:36] past the flesh and say something or
[44:38] minister something
[44:39] to see is there anything in that life
[44:43] that's down there
[44:44] sometimes friend even if they've grown
[44:45] up in church their whole life
[44:47] they become so covered over with all
[44:49] kinds of mud
[44:50] and bitterness and everything it's hard
[44:52] to find
[44:53] something in there that's going to
[44:55] respond to the lord
[44:57] but it's our job to keep praying and
[45:00] keep speaking
[45:02] until the darkness is moved away
[45:05] and oh there it is there's something
[45:07] within them
[45:09] to respond to god can you say amen
[45:12] there's something there and we're
[45:13] looking for that we know no man
[45:15] after the flesh but we're doing and i
[45:17] like this quote i have them put it on
[45:19] the screen
[45:20] john henry joett he's a great christian
[45:22] writer and he said
[45:23] we are called and he's saying this to
[45:25] preachers and pastors
[45:26] but i think it goes for all of us john
[45:28] henry joe said
[45:30] and i'd like you to put it up you have
[45:32] it there john henry joe it said we
[45:34] are called to be guides and guardians of
[45:37] the souls of men
[45:39] leading them into the way of peace we
[45:42] are to be
[45:42] constantly engaged with eternal interest
[45:46] leading the thoughts and the wills of
[45:48] men to the things that primarily
[45:50] matter and disengaging them from lesser
[45:54] or meanier concerns which
[45:57] hold them in servitude leave it right
[45:59] there this is what we're called to not
[46:01] the rest of the world is called this
[46:02] us christians we're called to lean their
[46:05] thoughts away from things
[46:06] that aren't as important in menial
[46:08] things of life to the things of eternal
[46:10] life
[46:12] that's what we're supposed to be
[46:13] witnessing about to guide their minds
[46:15] and to guide their souls towards not
[46:18] temporal things but eternal things
[46:21] i like that can you say amen we are to
[46:23] be the friends of the bridegroom
[46:25] winning men not to ourselves
[46:28] but to him matchmaking for the lord
[46:36] amen ever heard of a matchmaker
[46:42] me and my wife have done a little bit of
[46:43] that through prayer
[46:48] some of them have worked out some of
[46:49] them not so well
[46:51] i do believe we had a little part in eli
[46:52] and kendall and that turned out real
[46:54] well
[46:56] eli's been in my church since i started
[46:58] the church brother eli is our treasure
[47:00] now
[47:01] kindle my sec our secretary and what a
[47:03] tremendous couple for the lord
[47:05] what a tremendous couple for the lord
[47:07] and now they have a son and growing in
[47:09] the lord she came to our retreat
[47:11] years ago didn't know anything about the
[47:13] message of the last days didn't know
[47:14] much about anything god got a hold of
[47:16] her heart
[47:16] that was years and years ago and uh but
[47:20] eli was in my church grew up on church
[47:21] as a shy fellow
[47:23] and so a few times i would suggest
[47:27] certain girls and he'd run away
[47:33] so i had to re we had to be really
[47:35] careful you know
[47:36] so me and my wife we were a little bit
[47:38] involved in this matchmaking and
[47:40] we had to tread very softly
[47:43] when it come to kindle we just said if
[47:46] i said a few things and and
[47:51] i won't give the details because i want
[47:52] to embarrass them but
[47:54] here they are today matchmaker
[47:57] matchmaker make me a match
[48:00] find me a fine
[48:04] there's some other ones in here too i
[48:06] think
[48:08] but all you guys just stay away from my
[48:12] daughters though
[48:19] she went to camp gabriel went to camp
[48:20] she's 18.
[48:22] she gets these guys all around her like
[48:24] sharks you know just
[48:25] swarming
[48:29] i said you if a guy asked for your
[48:31] number at camp
[48:32] this is your response get a piece of
[48:35] paper and write it down
[48:36] 1-800 get lost you hand it back to them
[48:42] so we are to be friends of the
[48:46] bridegroom winning not to ourselves
[48:48] and you know john henry joe is referring
[48:50] to
[48:53] what is in the bible where they come and
[48:55] ask
[48:56] john the baptist
[48:59] i just i wish i could go into this next
[49:01] sunday or sometime this whole bridegroom
[49:03] and friend
[49:04] friend because he says the friend of the
[49:06] bridegroom
[49:07] they come to john his disciples come
[49:09] said why are we baptizing people
[49:12] and now jesus is over there baptizing
[49:13] because john said behold the lamb of god
[49:15] and there was a transition from the
[49:17] prophet to christ
[49:19] and he's baptizing people and john
[49:20] sometimes what's going on here now which
[49:22] ministry is
[49:23] you know is right now and should he be
[49:25] baptizing isn't this us shouldn't we be
[49:27] pointing to you
[49:28] john the baptist shouldn't we you know
[49:30] encourage the people who would be coming
[49:31] and
[49:32] you know just visit jeffersonville and
[49:34] just come and put your attention on you
[49:36] aren't you the one
[49:37] and so he says no no no no he said he
[49:40] that's a friend of the bridegroom
[49:42] friend of the bridegroom rejoices
[49:45] at the voice of the bridegroom but a
[49:48] friend of the bridegroom
[49:49] isn't necessarily the bride
[49:53] so now christ has come he's calling his
[49:55] bride and he says i'm rejoicing that
[49:57] because it's time to call his bride
[49:59] this is a whole different level this is
[50:00] not the best man of the wedding
[50:02] this is not a friend of the bridegroom
[50:04] but this is the bride and groom coming
[50:06] together in relationship
[50:07] right his last words were this
[50:10] i must decrease john the baptist the
[50:13] prophet
[50:14] i must decrease and he must increase now
[50:18] and that's the way we need to be when
[50:20] we're a witness he says it's not about
[50:22] bringing people to us it's just pointing
[50:25] people
[50:26] to the heavenly father can you say amen
[50:29] that's our job and he said but to him
[50:30] matchmaking for the lord
[50:33] abundantly satisfied when we have
[50:35] brought the bride
[50:36] and the bridegroom together that's what
[50:39] should bring us satisfaction
[50:41] is when the bride and the bridegroom
[50:43] come together is when sons and daughters
[50:45] are reconciled with their heavenly
[50:46] father can you say amen
[50:49] praise the lord so i'm going to have to
[50:50] find a place so we are not here to serve
[50:52] ourselves but drawing out
[50:54] others that part of christ that's lost
[50:57] and we and that can't find their way
[50:58] back to fellowship with god
[51:00] everything that we say and do should
[51:03] reflect
[51:04] this purpose be ye reconciled back to
[51:07] god
[51:08] i have the holy ghost within me for one
[51:10] purpose
[51:11] not to show off but that i call out my
[51:14] spiritual life
[51:15] calls out to every person no matter
[51:17] where they're at
[51:18] be ye reconciled back to god
[51:25] now this quote of brother branham was
[51:26] the last quote in the church age book
[51:29] and i like to read it i read it
[51:30] periodically because it to me it shows
[51:32] the purpose
[51:33] here we are john joe is saying this
[51:35] thing and your prophet says the same
[51:37] thing
[51:38] whatever people think of william mary
[51:40] and branham here's his purpose
[51:42] not for one moment if you have this
[51:44] quote i like to read it over and over
[51:46] but brother branham says not for one
[51:48] moment do i
[51:49] bring a message to the people that they
[51:51] may follow me
[51:53] or join my church or start some
[51:56] fellowship
[51:57] at an organization i have never done
[51:59] that
[52:00] and will not do that now
[52:05] i have no interest in those things but i
[52:08] do have an interest in the things of god
[52:11] and people and if i can accomplish just
[52:14] one thing
[52:15] i will be satisfied that one thing is to
[52:19] see established
[52:20] a true spiritual relationship between
[52:23] god
[52:24] and men they said it through the bible
[52:27] and the prophet of the last days which
[52:28] we believe if you have time after the
[52:30] service i'll share with you throughout
[52:32] the bible
[52:32] malachi 4 5 6 luke 17. all these other
[52:36] scriptures that speak of a restorative
[52:38] ministry at the end
[52:39] he's dead and gone on he's done his work
[52:41] already but this was his purpose
[52:43] it's not to start an organization it's
[52:45] not to start a movement
[52:47] but to accomplish one thing to see a
[52:50] spiritual relationship
[52:51] established between god and men you can
[52:54] take the whole message
[52:56] no matter what you've seen on the
[52:57] internet no matter what post you've seen
[52:59] from
[53:00] people that are so bitter you better
[53:02] quit listening to those voices
[53:04] and listen to the voice itself himself
[53:08] that he never come to start a cult and
[53:11] whatever way you look at the message
[53:12] this is the purpose you can take the
[53:15] entire message
[53:16] of william branham and sum it up this is
[53:18] to accomplish one thing
[53:19] to reconcile you back to the father
[53:22] can i get an amen this morning
[53:30] so one scripture says and i'm closing he
[53:33] said he came with the blood of the cross
[53:36] and he says when he paid the price at
[53:38] the blood of his cross
[53:39] he did it to reconcile to reconcile
[53:42] all things unto him things are in heaven
[53:45] things that are in earth
[53:46] with at that cross right after he paid
[53:50] the price
[53:50] there was a power there was a seeking
[53:53] that went forth from the cross
[53:55] from that day forward to go find all of
[53:58] his children
[53:59] and it says i'm seeking i'm reconciling
[54:02] all things in heaven all things in earth
[54:04] and the prophet comments right there and
[54:06] he says
[54:06] now watch where that goes now watch
[54:09] where it all goes
[54:10] in heaven and in earth it doesn't matter
[54:12] what came from the cross
[54:14] is now the father coming through the
[54:16] word and he's coming out
[54:17] from the cross now and he has one
[54:19] purpose he's seeking
[54:21] his children he's seeking to be
[54:25] reconciled with his children
[54:29] now this is 2 000 years later but he's
[54:31] still seeking
[54:32] his children he said i'm gonna reconcile
[54:35] all things in christ wherever they're at
[54:39] he's hunting he's seeking you weren't
[54:42] seeking him
[54:42] you see and so he comes i know kyle so i
[54:45] can embarrass him
[54:47] so he comes in a little high school and
[54:49] lindsay's going to high school
[54:51] and she's serving the lord her parents
[54:53] are here today
[54:55] trying to direct her in the way of life
[54:57] and they did a good job to get her in
[54:58] church around the world
[54:59] she served the lord kyle becomes
[55:02] interested
[55:03] and starts to be wooed by not only her
[55:06] good looks
[55:07] but also something within her and he
[55:09] says can i go out on a date i'm
[55:11] paraphrasing my own story here but
[55:12] can i go on a date and she says no i
[55:15] don't do that i don't do that but you
[55:17] can come to church with me i don't know
[55:20] what he felt about that but
[55:22] he was willing to come to church for her
[55:25] god see that was a little romance going
[55:29] on
[55:31] but they they didn't know till now till
[55:33] later
[55:34] it was the father said i'm i'm
[55:37] reconciling with my children
[55:40] and he's using a little romantic
[55:42] incident
[55:44] but from calvary ever since calvary has
[55:46] been seeking his
[55:47] children and he finds kyle
[55:51] and he says that's my son that's my son
[55:56] and through this little romantic
[55:57] incident he finds him in that high
[56:00] school
[56:00] he comes baptized filled with the spirit
[56:03] of god
[56:05] raising a family in the admonition of
[56:07] the lord
[56:11] that's what this message is all about
[56:14] you just keep seeking keep singing
[56:16] somebody's thinking where is he going to
[56:17] step towards nancy what in the world
[56:21] see some of your stories i i don't have
[56:23] the permission to embarrass you i did it
[56:24] to kyle but

[58:02] then he was away for about
[58:04] but then something comes and anybody who
[58:06] wants to say that this young man is
[58:08] sitting on the front row
[58:09] enjoying raising his hands serving the
[58:11] lord that this is some religion

[59:10] righteous
[59:14] let me tell you another story can i tell
[59:16] you one more before we go
[59:19] today is the anniversary of brother tim
[59:21] sister janeth
[59:23] we married them two years ago here
[59:27] a few months before that we baptized her
[59:29] in him in the name of the lord jesus
[59:30] christ
[59:34] so in colombia
[59:38] a little girl mom died at five years old
[59:42] family didn't show her much attention 12
[59:46] years old
[59:47] she's turned out she leaves home has
[59:50] nobody has no love
[59:53] goes to bogota the big city how many
[59:56] people
[59:58] 9 million people 12 year old girl lost
[1:00:00] in a city that big
[1:00:02] and none of us really know all that took
[1:00:04] place she was pretty quiet about it
[1:00:06] but she's by herself no god no
[1:00:11] no friends no family no one
[1:00:14] and she did that for years just made her
[1:00:16] own way
[1:00:17] in a huge city
[1:00:20] and then time went on i think she was
[1:00:23] would you say 28 29
[1:00:25] 30 and brother tim has some business
[1:00:29] there he goes to
[1:00:30] columbia it's involved in the i don't
[1:00:32] know if it was a coffee business back
[1:00:34] then but he's down there
[1:00:36] and i don't know it was before that but
[1:00:40] her cousins are in the message of the
[1:00:43] last days believing the truth of god
[1:00:45] she has two or three cousins that were
[1:00:47] message pastors down there
[1:00:48] they just feel in their heart they just
[1:00:50] say where's
[1:00:52] where's janith at she's because never
[1:00:53] hardly contact her where's she at
[1:00:55] and they felt to seek her out and so
[1:00:58] they made contact with her
[1:01:01] somehow and it's amazing they even found
[1:01:03] her
[1:01:05] so i'm just stopping at everything here
[1:01:08] and tell you it wasn't the cousins
[1:01:12] seeking her out it was her heavenly
[1:01:15] father
[1:01:18] through people it was god that dropped
[1:01:22] it on those men's hearts
[1:01:24] this godfather's seeking this girl
[1:01:27] no one had no one no telling what you
[1:01:31] know what she had to go through
[1:01:35] so they figure out they give her some
[1:01:37] materials they witness to her a little
[1:01:39] bit talk to her about it
[1:01:41] something slow begins to happen and then
[1:01:43] tim visits
[1:01:44] and they meet at a restaurant or
[1:01:46] wherever they met and
[1:01:48] she's she doesn't know english he
[1:01:49] doesn't know spanish so they sit down
[1:01:51] and they have a date and they're
[1:01:52] communicating with their phones to
[1:01:54] translate everything that gets said
[1:01:57] so there's there's a little attraction
[1:01:59] starting here
[1:02:00] and they're willing to do whatever they
[1:02:02] need to do to talk with one another
[1:02:05] so they have their first time together
[1:02:07] as first date together
[1:02:09] and they talk and he asks a question
[1:02:11] something like
[1:02:13] you know what what's your greatest fear
[1:02:15] and she said that i would
[1:02:17] that i would die alone
[1:02:20] that i would die alone and he responds
[1:02:24] and he says well
[1:02:25] that's not going to happen
[1:02:29] he's on his way home and the plane says
[1:02:31] this is my first date why in the world
[1:02:33] am i telling this girl that's not going
[1:02:34] to happen
[1:02:36] he said you've been preaching lately
[1:02:38] about this creation participating what
[1:02:40] we say has power in it we don't realize
[1:02:42] what we're saying sometimes
[1:02:43] he said right there he said i said
[1:02:45] something to her making a commitment
[1:02:47] almost saying something it had to be god
[1:02:50] saying that from me to her that's not
[1:02:52] going to happen
[1:02:53] you're not going to die alone
[1:03:00] relationship continues i just want to
[1:03:02] let you know brother tim
[1:03:04] you you know this but that wasn't you
[1:03:08] through you the father was seeking his
[1:03:12] daughter janith
[1:03:14] you don't think he's seen her when she
[1:03:15] was 12 years old
[1:03:17] cast out of her home you don't think the
[1:03:18] father was watching over her life
[1:03:20] preserving her life you don't think he
[1:03:23] was there the whole time watch
[1:03:24] and all of a sudden he orders these
[1:03:26] people to talk to her tim comes in her
[1:03:28] life
[1:03:28] they come back they eventually get
[1:03:31] together they're married
[1:03:32] she comes back in here she you know he
[1:03:34] can
[1:03:35] he can tell you the details i i said
[1:03:37] i'll tell it this morning because he
[1:03:38] probably couldn't make it through it
[1:03:40] but you can ask him it's a wonderful
[1:03:42] story related to our assembly here
[1:03:45] and it was the father seeking his
[1:03:47] daughter
[1:03:50] the father seeking the daughter
[1:03:54] jesus said one day i have needs to go by
[1:03:56] samaria
[1:03:58] i don't just arrange everything
[1:04:01] disciples i've got to go by sumerian
[1:04:02] walks up
[1:04:04] that recent movie of the chosen shows it
[1:04:06] so well and here she's a woman at the
[1:04:08] well and here
[1:04:08] he comes up and he's waiting there at
[1:04:10] the well she's the only one there
[1:04:12] and they make this connection in a
[1:04:14] matter of just a few minutes of a
[1:04:15] conversation
[1:04:16] a girl finds out i'm not
[1:04:20] a harlot i'm a daughter of god
[1:04:24] why did he have a need to go by samaria
[1:04:26] because the father
[1:04:28] was reconciling with a daughter
[1:04:32] so they get together and they get in the
[1:04:34] coffee business they're doing all these
[1:04:35] things you know
[1:04:36] and then she says i've got to find a
[1:04:37] church club her cousins told her about
[1:04:39] our church a couple years ago
[1:04:41] and they start come down and tim's going
[1:04:43] two hours away
[1:04:45] is there anything closer than two hours
[1:04:47] away but there was a hunger in both of
[1:04:49] them
[1:04:50] god was seeking boaz and miriam happen
[1:04:54] to live up there which is so convenient
[1:04:55] they don't live there anymore as of
[1:04:57] yesterday
[1:04:57] they're my neighbors down here in
[1:04:59] lambertville and temperance
[1:05:02] welcome neighbor
[1:05:04] [Applause]
[1:05:05] but god had boaz and miriam there for a
[1:05:07] purpose for jonathan tim
[1:05:09] because from what i've been preaching it
[1:05:10] has to come through the body somewhere
[1:05:13] they ministered to them they helped them
[1:05:14] they encouraged them they brought them
[1:05:16] down to church but they started coming
[1:05:17] down but he came down
[1:05:18] and they they come in this service in
[1:05:20] the first service brother tim says he's
[1:05:22] nervous he doesn't know anybody
[1:05:24] he just don't know what to do but he
[1:05:25] knows that his wife needs the fellowship
[1:05:27] he needs the fellowship they need to
[1:05:29] hear the word of god the cousins
[1:05:30] recommended the church they come down
[1:05:32] and he said that she she
[1:05:35] he he was a little nervous and he went
[1:05:37] in the bathroom and he come out and he
[1:05:38] looked in the best of our old church
[1:05:39] here two years ago and he's seen
[1:05:41] janet surrounded surrounded
[1:05:44] by the women of this church and he just
[1:05:48] looked at it and says
[1:05:49] this this is of god this is this is
[1:05:52] great
[1:05:53] this is what she needs surrounded her
[1:05:57] i think the sisters even wednesday night
[1:05:59] we had somebody just stop by and people
[1:06:01] just stopped by in church
[1:06:03] here and just getting to her right away
[1:06:06] welcoming them god bless you sisters for
[1:06:08] that
[1:06:09] we're not here for ourselves
[1:06:13] we're not here just to please ourselves
[1:06:18] and surroundings is just loving her and
[1:06:20] she
[1:06:21] he loved the fellowship and attention
[1:06:23] and then they got baptized
[1:06:25] at that baptism he says is when god
[1:06:27] really
[1:06:28] changed sister janet really
[1:06:32] she grew so quick in the lord i never
[1:06:34] seen anybody so
[1:06:35] grow so quick in the word she just grew
[1:06:37] she'd become just a mature
[1:06:40] way she looked at things so quickly so
[1:06:42] quickly
[1:06:44] but he knew
[1:06:47] this is the place that they needed to
[1:06:48] come no matter
[1:06:50] now the distance doesn't mean anything
[1:06:52] to them
[1:06:54] i can tell you there's many there's
[1:06:55] hundreds of stories even in this church
[1:06:58] this is the one i want to talk about
[1:06:59] because the families in town they want
[1:07:01] to come and be prayed for
[1:07:03] our dear sister his mom what was your
[1:07:04] name against pat
[1:07:06] lost her they lost their father lost her
[1:07:09] husband
[1:07:12] october of last year we lost our dad
[1:07:15] mom and her were able to get together
[1:07:17] yesterday and
[1:07:19] compare notes
[1:07:22] encourage one another
[1:07:28] we need the body of christ
[1:07:32] but i just wanted to end with janet
[1:07:34] today because
[1:07:35] i i see there's no other story to it
[1:07:39] except the father was finding
[1:07:41] his son and his daughter
[1:07:44] and he will find you wherever you're at
[1:07:47] you may be sitting in here this morning
[1:07:50] but he loves you he will find you and
[1:07:52] you're going to find when you come to
[1:07:53] him if you really come to him the right
[1:07:55] way
[1:07:56] it's it's not about worrying about
[1:07:58] people
[1:07:59] it's not about worrying about all the
[1:08:02] details
[1:08:03] it's just come to him just repent just
[1:08:06] come
[1:08:07] don't try to over complicate this
[1:08:11] don't try to get distracted by people
[1:08:15] just embrace the love of god as he
[1:08:16] embraces you
[1:08:18] can you say amen hundreds of stories
[1:08:22] but i can tell you it's all about
[1:08:26] the father being reconciled
[1:08:30] with his children
[1:08:33] can you say amen
[1:08:40] why don't you stand with me
[1:08:47] that was brother tim's birthday
[1:08:48] yesterday and their anniversary today
[1:08:52] the story to me doesn't end it in a
[1:08:54] defeat
[1:08:56] because the last part of it where he
[1:08:59] says
[1:09:01] she says i don't want to die alone he
[1:09:02] says that's not going to happen
[1:09:04] he was almost prophesying because
[1:09:08] janith who was by herself all those
[1:09:10] years
[1:09:11] was certainly not alone when god took
[1:09:13] her
[1:09:14] and she certainly wasn't alone when she
[1:09:16] stepped into the other dimension
[1:09:20] she got to see my dad quicker than i do
[1:09:25] amen she was surrounded by the body she
[1:09:28] was surrounded by friends
[1:09:30] and then when she went in that hospital
[1:09:32] the other thing was is that i went up
[1:09:34] and sat in the lobby knowing i couldn't
[1:09:36] get in there because of covet and i just
[1:09:38] wanted to be there for brother tim and
[1:09:39] pray
[1:09:40] and i said i don't know why i'm coming
[1:09:42] up here but i just want to support you
[1:09:43] guys
[1:09:44] he asked the nurse she wasn't supposed
[1:09:47] to do this and she was a christian lady
[1:09:48] and he asked and asked and asked a few
[1:09:50] times to find she comes she said
[1:09:52] let's do it let's do it let's get the
[1:09:54] pastor up here
[1:09:56] something was happening
[1:09:59] she didn't you know like she said i
[1:10:02] don't want to die alone
[1:10:03] and through covet god gets the pastor
[1:10:05] upstairs i snuck up there
[1:10:07] don't tell nobody state of michigan come
[1:10:10] and get me
[1:10:12] governor come get me
[1:10:17] and i walked into a room where a lady
[1:10:19] was all
[1:10:20] smiles all smiles suffering in pain but
[1:10:23] all smiles
[1:10:25] complete mature christian that's how i
[1:10:27] always say
[1:10:28] if they've come to that victory in
[1:10:30] divine love and god says it's
[1:10:31] their time to go then it's their time
[1:10:33] because all of us when we come to a
[1:10:34] victory in divine love
[1:10:35] we're going she'd already come to it
[1:10:39] quicker than me
[1:10:42] she says i know if you lay hands on me i
[1:10:45] know
[1:10:46] that god can completely take this cancer
[1:10:48] away and i'll step up and walk out of
[1:10:49] here
[1:10:50] i know completely possible with god
[1:10:54] then she just turned she says if god
[1:10:56] chooses not to do that
[1:10:58] i'm ready to go do you want me to tell
[1:11:01] anything to your dad
[1:11:05] i just i wasn't even thinking about this
[1:11:08] you know what
[1:11:09] if she goes she gets to see him before
[1:11:11] me
[1:11:14] she said do i need to write down what do
[1:11:16] you want to tell your daddy
[1:11:19] tell your friends this is real this is
[1:11:22] real
[1:11:23] and that woman she's in the hospital
[1:11:25] miriam got to go see her
[1:11:27] i got to see her we sent support and
[1:11:30] listen
[1:11:30] sister janet did not die alone
[1:11:35] and she certainly didn't cross into the
[1:11:37] other dimension
[1:11:38] alone i think janet had an effect on all
[1:11:41] of us a lot of some of you are crying
[1:11:43] she had an effect on our lives more than
[1:11:45] we had on her
[1:11:47] how many raise your hand and say that
[1:11:50] what the
[1:11:50] miraculous work of the lord that took
[1:11:52] place in that girl's life and in tim's
[1:11:55] life
[1:11:56] this gospel this last day's message
[1:12:00] is not complicated the father
[1:12:03] is going to find his sons and daughters
[1:12:07] he's found a lot of you this morning and
[1:12:09] he wants to be in fellowship
[1:12:12] with you with no hindrances
[1:12:16] heavenly father i appreciate you brother
[1:12:19] tim
[1:12:20] would you guys come and if you don't
[1:12:22] mind i just got to pray for you
