========================================

you bind every fighting spirit that comes against the word of god may you just bless your people tonight not because of me father because you father we open the word tonight we want to hear from you lord you said two or three are gathered you're in the midst and father i just asked she would just calm down and father just quicken the word tonight quick into our hearts lord open every door on every door father and just go and we invite you not just to one part of our heart but every every every every aspect of our life father may reign in this place may be blessed by the paul and this ministry here father and god may we just thank you for him lord just standing so faithful so many years father may you bless them in jesus christ's name amen so tonight i just want to get back onto first samuel uh 16 it says you know if you go through samuel right here in verse 16 you know samuel was on a great mission for the lord he was on a great mission for the lord to go after gods he was looking for god's anointed king he's on a great mission that he's looking for god he wasn't going to stop until he found god's king and i like what he said here in verse 11. he said for right there at the end he said he says right in verse 11 and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children and he said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and samuel said unto jesse sin and fetch him for we will not sit down and so tonight i want to speak on for we will not sit down and i just want to go down that little road tonight because i believe we're living in such a late hour that the bride of christ doesn't need to sit down you're sitting down tonight but i want to tell you to keep pressing forward tonight i want to tell you that you brother paul and his his dad he was telling me how he traveled around the world and you know i bet you he looks back today and said thank thank you dad for setting an example not to sit down or thank you mama for sitting being so faithful and being a monarch of the family that you were the fifth gospel to my children tonight that that we're not sitting down we're pressing on today and i believe that there's people looking at your lives tonight they're looking at the way you the way every action you are it's not about brother talks about he said it's not about i'm paraphrasing tonight for time but he talks about it's not about the the what you say it's the life behind the name that makes the devil tremble the devil knows who you are behind the church doors he knows when you leave this place tonight he knows how you are he knows every aspect you are brother said he knows every punch to punch you at you just got to cover that up tonight and i believe we gotta we know what we're weak at and we know where we're strong at but i tell you what we're strong in the lord tonight we're strong with jesus christ tonight and i'm telling you if i'm going to tell you anything tonight i want to encourage you this year not to sit down on the lord i tell you if you're a sunday school teacher tonight if you're a singer tonight if you're a witness for the lord tonight i'm here to tell you not to sit down on the lord tonight i'll tell you to be the best singer you are be the best witness you are i don't care if they call you to the baptist church you sing your heart out for jesus christ or you represent they look at the life they know what you believe you don't have to tell them everything that you're cast your pearls before swine they know what you believe they look you up in about two seconds and find out what you believe you don't have to go around and just say i believe that hey you you you use wisdom in that but i just want to encourage you tonight not to sit down on god samuel didn't and he says that samuel he said for we will not sit down so i'm here to tell you that we don't need to rust out or you know fold up shop it's not time to fold up shop it's time to keep pressing on where it's such a great hour that it's time to keep pushing on no matter your family comes against you if whatever happens you keep serving jesus christ you serve him with all your heart covers in the land i know it's we got to use wisdom in that and everything but i'll tell you what i we got god in the land he says when we lay hands on the sheik they shall recover you call me a nut case today but i'm happy to be in that case because i love jesus christ i know what this word says brother says show me a bible and i'll show you it's marked up and read through tonight and it's born and battled he said i'll show you a go a person that loves the lord brethren says he said i'd rather just be a little over jealous about my the father's kingdom than to have no zeal at all he said i'd rather overwork he says and as a as the church of christ preacher told me some time ago brother brown he said mr brown i'd rather i'd rather well or wear out than rust out he said and that is a lot of truth he said i'd rather wear out and die in the harness oh praises hey as brother neville said then you refused to have the harness on he said you can't do any nothing he said you can't do nothing any worse than neglect to try he said let's do all we can all we can with what you have to do with he said in the holy spirit our tutor will bring it to the father use everything that you got tonight don't just use some of it i believe some of us we got so much talent with the youth or whoever age you are tonight i don't care all young but you can you could serve with everything you got for the lord that was a spiritual adoption you say who the lord jesus christ the king is coming and i believe this is just the same thing we're doing today we're not sitting down until the king is coming we're not sitting down like samuel the bride of christ is making herself ready and as she's coming to church every day when the doors are open or when they're supporting the ministry brother says supporting their local church get in there and and put your shoulder to the will i tell you you know say they say i hate to say this tonight but they push push play and obey i'll tell you what they're not obeying some of these people are not obeying tonight they're not listening to what the prophet's saying and i tell you what he never took ephesians 4 out he never took the started taking the bible out tonight and i tell you you shouldn't either but i tell you luke 19 13. i was reading before i came in here it says then he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds and said them i could occupy till i come another word get busy in other words get busy for the lord tonight i tell you to get busy you know we look at other people and say well they're doing something for the lord i tell you you do something for the lord oh just tell someone about jesus tell him about the love of god tell him what he's done for you and your life i tell you why you'll feel the holy spirit come down it'll take a negative situation when they start talking negative i tell you to turn into positive i get someone on the phone sometimes rachel be on the phone someone be talking negative i say rachel just say something positive and before you know it they're like hey someone's on the other line i gotta go try it sometime because they want to just hear some negativity always they just want to hear we're we're in this flash and we're we're we're mortal but i tell you what we got a haul that rachel sing about today that i see it coming down in this age i believe the home is right in plain sight tonight and i'm going there tonight i got a mother there tonight that's saying son keep pressing on you probably got a father there tonight if he can look at you he brought back through the time brother brown said he said they came there and there was converts and converts and they said hey i don't want to go back in that body he said brother he said you he said the saints said keep pressing on he heard him saying keep pressing on i believe if you saw your daddy tonight he would say keep pressing on brother keep pressing on tonight he would say brother paul you keep pressing on sister brother keep pressing on i tell you because the reward is so much greater the reward is so much greater 1 7 through 8. jesus replied he said it's not for you to know the times or seasons that the father has fixed by his own authority but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem and judah samara and to the ends of the earth our job is not to sit down if you read this our job is to be filled with the holy ghost and do something for the lord it's not just to say i'm a bible believer i'm a message believer or i just quote a couple quotes or i know a quote i tell you what it's time to live what the prophet talks about and he lines up with the word of god it's time to get in the action and not just say it's brother paul tonight or it's for the preachers or the deacons or the song leaders it's for everyone that's sitting in front of me tonight we have to put all our shoulders to the wheel when i was in the military i couldn't imagine saying well i'm going to be the only one to shoot this uh machine gun today i'm gonna be the only one i get on the battlefield and we get ready we shoot the uh uh 50-count machine guns i can't imagine saying you got 400 troops but i'm just going to go up here and do it myself i believe the lord would have been with me if i trusted god through it but i'm telling you we got believers in this church today you gotta believe other message churches all over friends and family that you need to put the shoulders to the will and say i'm not sitting down this year i'm not sitting i'm going to give it my all i'm going to keep pressing on every day i'm going to shed a light for jesus christ until he comes robin says between that 6 to 9 hour he's coming for us and i tell you i look every morning i say lord just let me get up about 5 30 and just start looking i'm waiting for my mom to that got saved we had a broke up family we lived in perrysburg i'll never forget we were coming up the interstate little tears started coming to my eyes and i said that's the same interstate dad dropped me off on i was about 10 years old and he couldn't find us for a few days because i hid up under a bridge and started sleeping and i said i can't wait lord let me find my way back to south carolina to see my mom see my grandmother because she didn't have much my dad had so much money but i didn't look at the money i looked at the love of god she had in her i didn't pay attention to oh this law and this law i looked at charity tonight i knew that god was in that lady and i told you i said grandma called her the other day she said son you keep pressing on she was in the hospital she had pneumonia covered and something else and uh she got caught in one month three different things and today she's back up walking i said grandma i said the devil gonna try to kill you she said well if he ain't done with me i'll keep pressing on she said but son you press this message and you press this truth with all that's within you and you don't stop until you get to the finish line and i don't want to tell you today to not to sit down and to keep pressing on keep fighting problem i see when church is traveling we travel all over and i see we we're in a time where it's become complacent it's come to a time that we can i hate to say this hey i love streaming when we can have it when you're in the bed sick but it's become a time that you could sit at home in your pajamas tonight i'm sorry i don't listen to my notes tonight but we can sit in our pajamas tonight and say well i'd rather just sit here and then go to church hey i tell you what there's something different when you get in the presence of god and you get between believers tonight and you sit down and you pull on each other and you say hey bring these licks of fire together and you got a pastor that's been praying all day trying to find the channel of god i want to encourage you to get in the church house tonight press on keep pressing on for the for this battle i came up with a saying the other day or the other week probably a couple of months ago maybe i said you know what cloven stands for rachel we were driving to a church i see what coleman stands for i said christ overcomes viruses infections and diseases i said i want to make a shirt that says that and i said she said i don't know you might want to look that up you probably could patented that i said praise god it just came out of nowhere i didn't look on my phone it just god said christ overcomes the foreviruses infections and diseases i believe a god that's the same yesterday today forever if you got a child that needs needs to be be saved you keep claiming them today you keep praying for them tonight don't give up on them my grandmother never gave up on me she said i just come home as a wayward child she'd be in the corner praying saying god don't give up on him right there i tell you he's not gonna lose one he's not gonna lose one praise god he said this is not a picnic picnic ground this is a battlefield see not a place where we lay back and say now lord you just come forth force it right in me and then i'll do it no no you don't do it that way god never did it that way he's a gentleman tonight he's not going to force you to do anything he wants you to love him with all your heart he wants you to press on no matter what comes your way no matter if you lose everything tomorrow i tell you we were coming back from a church brother darren kinser for new year's i don't even know if we got back to the hotel to four o'clock there were so many people coming getting saved there was young people old people i said praise god we're going to fight the devil tomorrow we pull up the house the next day by the fall over open the door the basement's flooded open the door rachel looks down the hall the boy said daddy i think the basement's flooded i said praise god anyway praise god because you know what i know the devil's after every one of us he wants to kill steal and destroy but i tell you he said i come life to give you more abundantly and i believe that's what god he put us through trials to shape our character brother brown said character is a victory tonight he said your character is a victory i want to put that up in my house say character is a victory oh church i'll just believe it tonight he said remember you're not on a picnic he said but you're in a battlefield many people he said just think that you would become a christian that's all we need to do that settles it forever as they are a christian he said everything's going to come on easy don't ever get that in your head for i become a christian to fight he said fight the good fight of faith i become a christian to fight fight the good fight of faith become a christian get in the battle lines you are christian soldiers and we got to be trained and brought up and to know all the techniques of the enemy and to know how to afford he said fortified to know how to fight the fight he said then we can only do that as the holy spirit reveals it to us we can't take what some other nation tells us and he says when we go to war he says some of their ideas he said but we got to take our own ideas the way the holy spirit would direct us he said what ideas we would give us become because he is the commander chief of the army of the christians he also says in another place he said he put five stars on you tonight he said he gave you f-a-i-t-h he gave you j-e-s-u-s it's time to stomp on the devil tonight it's time to stop playing about church tonight it's time to stomp on his head he said he's under my feet i believe he's under my feet if i come home to a drowned basement i'll sure serve the lord if i come home and he takes everything i got i'll still serve my god i'm like job if my wife curses whatever it is i'll still serve my god i'll tell you that's what you got to get in your the young kids i want to hear to tell you tonight that you got to get a get a passion for jesus christ you gotta get in the word of god no matter if your parents don't pray don't matter if you you're you know what you pray you pray i learn real quick i enroll with a prayer family besides my grandmother and i believe real quick i had to realize research and start studying why i believe what i believe and when you start researching not just because your parent believes it you research why you believe the word of god you go through from genesis to revelation and when you get a sound doctrine and you get a sound and you get that root inside and it just starts to get watered i tell you what no one will take it out of you no one will take it out of you he says the christian don't ask for easy things you are not there's so many promises today amongst christian people so many ministers promise the people a false saying if you'll just come to christ all your troubles is settled he said i tell you when you come to christ then they begin that's when you put on the uniform and take the gun and enter the battlefield he said this christian road is not a flower bed of ease it's a battle from every very hour you start he said until your spirit is set free by death he said you are not he said not at a no picnic you're on the battlegrounds and so we are promised things the true easter seal we are on the battlefield but i want to tell you not not to sit down not to give up if you if you come in here tired tonight and you're like lord i just don't think i can make it any farther i'm telling you here you can make it not by your strength tonight by jesus christ strength it ain't what i can do i've come driving up the road you are tired and weary but i said lord give me once more lord give me some of your strength give me something to encourage the people to pick them up in heavenly places that's where we got to get tonight i love that song it says i'm pressing up the onward way new heights i'm gaining every day still praying as i'm upper bound lord plant my feet on solid ground i believe we got to believe that tonight it's more than just a song it's more than a song but i love what he said bro here is samuel verse 12 he says uh verse 7 or verse 12 yeah it says and he sent brought him in and he was a ruddy and with what well with the a beautiful countenance and god goodly to look to and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he they thought he went through so many of them he thought hey who could it be who could it be and they looked at somebody that brother brown even talks about they look at uh here here's uh samuel looking for the king he chooses david and he's looking for him and everybody else thinks it's somebody else it's like the devil today they think oh well it's over here it's in this church or it ain't in a church it ain't we don't get saved and be put on the book i'll tell you when i saw this message and i got the tapes i went to the first baptist church back at home and i called the pastor i said take me off the books i said i need he said it's midnight i said i don't care what time it is i need you to take me off them books i said you take me off of them i called my uncle up i said get the water ready i'm going down it was midnight he said son can you wait two in the morning i said no i said morning might not come and i meant it with all my heart because i realized where where i was being told a false doctrine because i believed what my parents started telling me they'd show up on easter and christmas and show up in a pretty dress and say son as long as you get up and sing and you get up there and you and you you are we singing i don't know just get up there and sing but i tell you to keep pressing on today get your kids in sunday school and don't just drop them off brett ramsey take them to sunday school like revelation 19 talks about i love what it says i was reading over revelation earlier at the hotel real quick tonight i was reading the revelation that talked about how uh it said let us it said and i heard a great voice in the multiple verse six and the voice of many waters and the voice of the mighty thunder saying hallelujah it says for the lord i'm nimitz reigneth let us be glad and rejoice he said and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready i believe you're making yourself ready tonight i believe when you listen to these tapes you're making yourself ready brother i've said the bride has everything she has need of and it's within the word of god and i tell you we just get clothed in the word of god and get in these messages every day and i tell you he will clothe you he will make you ready for the rapture he will he will shave off everything that you have on you tonight no matter if you have a little piece of the world he'll show you he'll shave it off you don't have to go up and run up and tell him hey you got this you got that just be a christian and you know what when your fellow christian gets down you pick them up brother braham said when you see them in the gutters you go pick them up don't stomp on them just say hey brother i love you i want to pray for i'm not saying making the grace of disgrace tonight but i'm saying go over there put your hands on them send them a card go by their house say hey brother i've been praying for you sister i've been praying for you brother i mean i'll tell you what it'll do a lot more good than just saying a bunch of laws tonight tell you he said hey the greatest is charity you can have tongues and all the interpretation in the world they said if you don't have love you miss the boat but i love what saul said if you flip over to samuel 17. he really brought it home for me tonight in verse 25 on 17. saul basically says hey if you can go kill goliath he said whoever can kill goliath you can read it for yourself he said whoever could kill goliath i'll give him my daughter i'll give it to him he says and the man of israel said hey you've seen this man that cuz come up surely that the fire israel has come up and you shall be he said that man who killed him the king will enrich him with great riches and i will give his daughter and make his father house free in israel and i think that's tonight the jesus bride is here tonight and i'll tell you what he's got a bride that he's coming back without a spot or wrinkle and that's because of the blood that's shed on calvary that's not because what you've done is because pure grace tonight and it's the grace of god that has come down your house and knocked on your door tonight and said i want to give you a little bit of grace it's like in ruth i want to give you a little bit of grace tonight i tell you it's a lot of grace and it's not a time to put the car in park it's not a time we end up saying in high school you put the paddle to the metal i'm telling you tonight to put the pedal to the metal tonight or to give it all you got don't give up on jesus christ don't give it just a halfway christian you'll be all the way christian you live for this message you live for everything that's within you and you serve god with all your heart you don't bow for satan if someone says this and that i still love honor they say you believe that i said i just believe the word of god they said you believe this believe that i said listen i know brother brown's a script scarecrow to you i said but i believe every word of the bible from genesis to revelation i don't just take it this ain't a solid buffet this is you take the whole book tonight it's not a time we were driving up here it's not a time to put it on cruise control i thought about our car you put it on cruise control it's not a time for cruise control it's a time to get up and keep pressing on tonight it's time where i believe we're in the last i believe we're in the last sprint tonight i was reading an article the other day and i think his name was redmond he had all the history he made that he was mean every single medal i was reading the article he was winning every single medal throughout history and he was winning all these medals and he gets to the main race and he starts running this race and all the cameras were pointed on them in the olympics and they're all pointing on this one guy and they kept pointing the camera because he was way afraid of everybody else and about halfway through the race here he is he falls down and he loses something falls out cramps in his leg he hurt something and pulled the hamstring and he starts to limp and then he falls down and all of a sudden he sees his dad in the corner and he looks and he sees his dad come running down and his son's starting to weep and he says son you don't have to prove anything you've won medals after medals after medals he says son you don't have to prove anything this is a true story he said you don't have to prove anything you've got it on the walls at home he said daddy he said just come on home son i'll bring you home he said daddy if you don't carry me whatever it takes i'm gonna take this old beating up leg and i'm gonna get up and i'm gonna keep going until i cross that finish line and he said he just grabbed his leg and he started carrying his leg and he said he started limping and he limped halfway through to the rest of the finish line and he said there wasn't one record that he won the race but there was a record on the line that said he finished the race and i believe there's a bride of christ here tonight that you might be battled and bruised tonight and you might be limping tonight but i tell you to get up i tell you to get up and keep serving jesus christ i'm not telling you tonight you just get up i don't care if you're battled and scarred tonight but you grab your leg or whatever it takes and you pre-pressing forward i tell you what don't look what people are saying out there it's better i'm saying it's chatter chatter chatter and it's chatter chatter i'm there to tell you tonight you just to keep pressing forward tonight and you grab that leg or that arm or whatever the devil wants to tell you to god tonight brother said refuse anything the devil brings you and he says as soon as you accept that package back he says then the devil's got you but i believe tonight we got to refuse everything the devil you know what i'll say i think sometimes as a believer we think the devil's amazon they just show up on your doorstep the devil gives you what you want and you go okay i'll take it i tell you why you need to kick the devil out tonight and say devil you're not belong in this house i tell you it's time to go home sometimes and do a house cleaning i got it over my door over my door at home it's just for in this house we're going to serve the lord i said boys we're going to serve the lord we're going to go to church we're going to love jesus christ and we're going to love him with everything that's within us like ii timothy paul said i fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith i have prayed paul said i pressed toward philippians 4 3 14 i pressed toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of god in jesus jesus so if i had something to say that tonight i didn't know where to go i was praying really praying before in the hotel i was just like lord let me get your channel but i want to encourage you to write something down tonight don't sit on your purpose don't sit down on your purpose because you know what samuel didn't samuel had one purpose and to find the king and i believe tonight that a bride of christ has a purpose tonight and that's to find the king tonight and i'm telling you tonight that you keep pressing on you keep striving everything that's in you you just take everything the word says and you believe it and you take your purpose tonight and you say i got a purpose devil you you applied the i said if he applied the asset to your eyes tonight tell the devil to get out of your house and you believe it with all your hearts and i believe like samuel you know god samuel god samuel didn't sit down on his purpose you pray you have a purpose any purpose is until he takes you out here keeps serving him with all your heart you know people are going out with cove within this and it flew and all these sicknesses rachel was in the medical field for 15 years as a pharmacist i know we were living in south carolina i looked at her one day and i said honey we're doing and i'm just saying this for my family so wherever you feel led i'm not telling you i'm just telling you what we felt that i was praying and praying rachel come home one day and i said honey you've been 15 years in that hospital i said now we have isaac i said i want you to raise them kids i want you to raise them boys i want you to i don't care about that money i said i got in the prayer closet and i just started praying and started weeping rachel will tell you tonight she come home after 15 years in the hospital they said we want you to be the director of i'm telling you about not sitting down tonight and i'm telling you i'm just sitting here to encourage you i'm not telling you you have to do this you do what the lord tells you to do and so i come home i was praying i said honey put your notice in she was scared to death she didn't know how we were going to make it she didn't know where the next paycheck was going to come but i don't know about you tonight but i know where the paychecks come from i know where my 401k comes from and that's from jesus christ he said greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world and i started realizing i started really thinking about first john 4 and i started thinking about really where my faith lies in and it's jesus christ i we almost lost everything we really all know you could tell her we were on the verge of about losing everything we had and a check came in the mail she put her notice in we put another sin i put resumes all over the place and i i was searching for a job i said lord you got to find us somewhere fellowship we didn't have much of a church then her father served in this message in the in the word of god all over all over the world faithfully and uh at the time we did we started having boys and we started realizing they needed fellowship you're starting to realize when you have a faithful pastor that wants to push fellowship and push young people to get closer to god and because they're the next ones coming up i think there's some churches i see in the message like well what about the um well we'll forget about them no they're the next people coming up and i i where i'm going with this i don't know but i'll tell you what i uh rachel played another said she was shaking that night i looked over she thought i was asleep and i looked over and the faithful wife was just putting her resume they said we want you to be the chief she said actually i'm quitting she said my husband told me we're going to quit i'm going to follow the leading of the lord i applied all over the place tennessee everywhere indiana wherever they called us up about a month later he said no this insurance company called said we're going to pay we're going to pay your closing costs we're going to pay we're going to bounce every box we're going to go pay off your your closing your your closing costs and we're going to move you and your whole family in indiana we've been there seven years and i'll tell you what god is faithful and if you find your purpose you live out your purpose if he's called you to sing you sing with all your heart he's called you a sunday school teacher sing with everything that's within you he's called you a minister a pastor oh pastor the people with all you got yeah i'll tell you find your purpose in your life but we about lost everything but god said you're not going to lose everything i already know it and i tell you we've been blessed more than we can even ask god has blessed us more by stepping out by faith and i'll tell you he says great even brother brown talks about how if we just step up by faith how much greater faith and how much how much blessed we are when we step up by faith find your purpose until you die share your purpose but i'll tell you what someone said the other day said are you going to retire when are you going to retire when are you going to return i said i ain't going to retire i said ain't retirement for me i said i'll tell you what it is it's called refinement this i'm gonna fire something in my bones tonight and give me more of jesus tonight where i could share the word to like die brother i said he said when you gonna rest i was listening the other day someone said when you arrest brother branham he said i'ma rest when i get over there he's i'm gonna keep pressing on until i get over there i'll tell you to keep pressing on till you get over there keep pressing until you see your dad show up until he walks through the door and

it is i tell you there's a kid watching your life the pastor's being watched we're all being watched it's not just for the ministers tonight it's for every one of us tonight and brother brown said in this paraphrasing for time he says in this message he goes out of his body he comes back and he says and i kept hearing that voice and brother brett said i kept hearing a voice he said oh i don't want to go back he says i can't he said look i seen my old carcass here getting old and wrinkled and drawed up he's the disease all afflicted and i seen my hands behind my head he thought oh oh i have to go back to that again he said but i kept hearing the voice he said keep pressing on keep pressing on i believe that i can tell you anything tonight if i'm never back here again i want to tell you tonight to keep pressing on to keep serving god with everythingness within you tonight everything number two don't sit down on your prayers don't sit down on your prayers don't sit down on them don't sit down let's read in verse 41. and the lord said unto samuel how long will thou mourn i saw seen i was rejected from him he reign over israel fill thine horn with oil and go and he said i will send night into jesse he bethleh might for i am provided for a king among his sons verse six it says and it came to pass when they were come and he looked at elab and he said surely the lord's anointing is before him and he started praying he's talking to the lord he's praying to the lord he says but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or not on his height or statute because i refused him for the lord seeth not as a man saith before the man he said for the man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart so don't think you know someone's heart tonight i'll tell you what just serve do your purpose get in your purpose and serve jesus christ with all your heart and don't sit down on your purpose and don't sit down on your prayers he answered here he is he answered saul he answered samuel's prayers and he gave him what he was looking for he didn't just get it on the first try he went through jesse jesse started bringing his sons bringing him up kept bringing but he found his purpose he was looking for the king here's one here's one if you read through for time you read through chapter 16. he brought one here comes another cuts up the thing with seven he keeps going and finally finds a ruddy boy that you wouldn't think that he'd be choosing of god's king but i tell you why god don't you people look at the world and they're all caught up in the cove and this and that but i tell you what a perfect time to leave the world what a perfect time when the world's caught up in sickness and all this drama and all this thing that's going on and the bride just one day just keeps walking like he walked i believe it's coming around the corner that we're going to be walking like enid walked i believe we got that testimony we got that in the bible to show the bride of christ that's what it's coming down to it's a showdown time it's not a time to sit down brother i'm saying oh father i pray as your servant the only way we realize that that prayer changes things he said prayer changes a sinner to a christian he said prayer changes a sick man to a well man he said and i asked in joining prayer he said with this man that you heal his body may he go off this platform happy rejoicing in jesus name and i tell you i don't know if you've ever heard this quote but i tell you he said we have the most powerful thing he said prayer is the most powerful weapon powerful weapon that was ever put in the control of human beings now you take a statement tonight what the prophet god said he said prayer was the most powerful weapon you have tonight why don't we use it enough because we get caught up in things of the world in busyness of life but god wants us to cross a rugged christian soldier and get in your prayer closet and say lord show me your will tonight show me your will lord i want to be in your channel tonight i'll tell you he'll show you if you would just be stuck you just listen to that small that still saw voice but i want to show something tonight i hope i get to it but but luke said luke 11. i want to bring something out tonight really hit home for me jesus teaches on prayer it's really hit home hope it hits home for you tonight it says then it came to pass that is as he was praying in a certain place he said when he ceased one of the disciples said unto him lord he's his disciples think about this tonight the disciples could ask him for anything they wanted they saw the five loaves and the five fishes they could have not had to go to walmart anymore to go shopping anymore they could ask them anything he wanted he hung the stars in the sky they saw every miracle tonight but they asked him one question they said in a certain place when he was ceased he said one of the disciples said to him lord teach us to pray he didn't say how to pray he said to pray he didn't say how do we pray he goes on and says how he goes in he's telling you how to pray but the disciples said to pray so i'm here to tell you tonight just to pray just speak to him like you speak to your daddy tonight speak to him like you speak to your mommy tonight speak to him like you know him tonight that's like when that pla i tell you what that's like that lady that's shooting my woman she grounded an airplane tonight oh he says he walked in that room and he said he walked over to her he stopped hey mr parson i've been waiting on you lord i say lord i'm checking up tonight i say lord give me a better prayer life give me a lot a prayer life that will stop airplanes that will bring a servant to you to your road tonight let's stop by and walk down your aisle tonight and say was it me you were looking for was it me you were looking for tonight was it me you were praying about whatever it be the night i grant the lord give it to you tonight but it stopped the airplane tonight and it's just think about it for a minute stop it she comes up he says well why don't you pray he starts to ask her to pray he said i knew she knew jesus he said she spoke to him before have you spoke to him before think about it have we spoke to jesus like that i say lord help me i'm just being vulnerable tonight hey lord help me let me be more like that but i want to bring something out tonight he goes on verse 2 and he says and said unto him on verse chapter 11 of luke he said when ye pray say our father which are in heaven hallowed be thy name that king come everybody knows that thy will be done and heaven earth is in heaven give us this day of daily bread but i want to bring something out it really hit me it said for verse six for a friend of mine in his journey has to come to me and i have nothing set before him and it says and then he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed i cannot rise and give thee he says i say unto thee unto you thou he will not rise and give you him because he is his friend he says he is his friend yet because of his opportunity he will rise him and have give as many as he needeth you know what opportunity means tonight i look that up it means persistence it means persistence tonight it also means persistence to the point of annoyance tonight i tell you what you ever thought about your child tonight when you're in the you're in the you're have you ever been on the phone and you're in the house and you're getting on a call and it's perfect timing for your kids to start yelling and start screaming and then finally they're on the front door the boys are in the basement they're banging on the door you go to the bathroom you take a bathroom break mommies i'll tell you it's the truth and then they start banging on the front door and they're being persistent and they start banging on the door and they start banging on the door and all of a sudden rachel goes what but they get her attention they get her attention because they're being persistent because of their opportunity mama comes to the door and i want to tell you tonight just not give up on jesus christ to be to get persistent with god and be knock on the door and say lord i keep coming to the door i keep coming to you answer it i got a children this way

he fills you with all his fruits of his spirit you take while you say dad i love you with all my heart you might run my mom through the ringer and this and that she died six years ago at 55 she just fell over and but let me tell you something she gave her heart and the lord got re-baptized in jesus name and i'll tell you what we were out one day and they said they gave us our i'll just explain so it's really encouraging so we get there we get to the they said my mom said i don't want to be in the ground son i don't know she just said she wanted to be in a mausoleum i said what's that i said oh

fought for us i said i'll sign every document there is that's what god did for you tonight he he fought with everything he sent a son on ivory palaces for every one of us tonight he said here i send them for you tonight and he's gave you a purpose in this church tonight to keep pressing forward to keep giving everything you got and then my mom would come home and they said well my mom you ask rachel she said her one last request to my grandmother she said i really had nothing in life didn't have this but she gave her heart to jesus that's why it matters to me i don't care she's gone but i'm thankful that i can see her again and i'll tell you she said i want to be the highest i can be we got to the grave we got to the site they said sir sign this paper and rachel was there and we get there and for time she said sir all we have is the seventh one over i think it was seventh one over eight one over seven one over it was seven high i said oh jesus that's what she wanted and that's what you get mama and the boys will put flowers on there and you with this big old pole and you knock them off it might knock you out and i sometimes go mom you got what you got but we got grandchildren down here trying to put flowers in there to keep falling off but praise god anyway and we started talking and we were praising the lord we're gonna start singing songs and before you know it the white dove just comes walking across and i look up on there and i said boys you see that white dove i said praise god and we started taking we're going to ask her we got a picture of a white dove just walking back and forth and all of a sudden that white dove takes off god cares tonight i'm here to tell you you're here for a purpose and that's not just to talk about somebody that's about to lift someone up and say hey i'm not just just a message or i carry a tape or a i quote a scripture or a quote a quote i don't mean anything it's about the life and i saw that dove that dove went flying down you can ask her tonight the dove went flying off and went right to her daddy's grave and flew down to the daddy's grave and flew off and i said god thank you thank you for a confirmation lastly i want to say don't sit down for the people because there's people watching your lives and i want to share something samuel verse 11. it says for we it didn't say i it said for we will not sit down it didn't say singular it talked about plural tonight it said for we will not sit down so i'm here to tell you it's plural tonight it's not just for me it's not for just brother paul it's for everyone in this church it's for everyone listening tonight that we're not going to sit down hey i'll tell you it's not about sitting down you got grandchildren you got babies watching your lives you got family members watching your lives i tell you they're watching they don't want to just see a quote book they don't look at it my kids don't look just a quote book every day they want to

and say lord i just want to see i want to be like i want to walk by and see a shadow and be healed i tell you we got to get so caught up in the god in his channel and realize hey that if we could just get by his shadow it will be healed i tell you what we got to get so close to god but i want to hear one more thing to tell you don't sit down for the people don't sit down for people don't just sit down for what whoever tells you to sit down you keep pressing this bottle it was for the second time it says second king second but you can read this when you get home but second kings seven one through five there was four leopards one time that sat down at the gate they sat down but i tell you brother brown says he said now look as the lepers they laid at the gate he said they said why why you sit here till we die if we go to the city you're going to die he said if you stay here we're going to die but if we go down to the samaritans if they kill us we're just going to die anyhow he says so we'll save us we live so they rose up and went down and they got their camp and god rewarded their faith he said is that right reverend says and they he said they not only saved their self but they saved the whole samson the city samaria didn't they oh church i'm here to tell you tonight as the musicians come tonight i'm here to tell you tonight to don't sit down i'll tell you they got up they

becomes your life support tonight you'll get out of your bed and come to church when the doors are open i'll tell you brother brown says he'll put you on your back sometimes where you can look up and say god i see now don't let them get to that point in your life if you set down on your prayer life if you set down on your purpose or if you're sitting down for other people people are watching you people are watching you just like samuel he said for we will not sit down he said for we will not sit down romans 14 8 for whether we live we live unto the lord i love this for whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lords no matter if we die we live our every breath everything that's within us comes from jesus christ and when you realize that everything when you get up in the morning and you get breath in your body i say lord thank you for another day i want to serve you now i want to tell someone about jesus i ain't got to go run around and push the message quote down their throat i say just be a light into this world be a light there's just one scripture i want to read tonight everybody knows it first peter 2 9 but you our chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show your forth your praises unto him who hath called you out of darkness into light [Music] always called you out of darkness in
