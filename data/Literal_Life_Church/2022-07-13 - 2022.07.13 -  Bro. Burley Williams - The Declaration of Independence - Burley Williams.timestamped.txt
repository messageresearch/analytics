[0:01] amen i'd like to invite you to turn into
[0:03] your bibles
[0:05] to the book of numbers chapter 16
[0:08] and we'll read a
[0:14] scripture praise the lord
[0:17] i really did try to get out of preaching
[0:22] i really did paul wouldn't let it but
[0:25] we're here by god's grace
[0:29] amen numbers
[0:32] chapter 16.
[0:38] let's go to verse one
[0:42] nakora the son of ishar the son of
[0:45] kohath
[0:46] the son of levi and dayton
[0:49] and abraham the son of eliam
[0:52] and on the sun appeal sons of reuben
[0:55] took me
[0:57] and they rose up before moses
[0:59] with certain of the children of israel
[1:02] 250 princes
[1:04] of the assembly
[1:05] famous in the congregation
[1:08] man of
[1:10] renault they gathered themselves
[1:12] together against moses
[1:14] and against aaron
[1:16] and said unto them
[1:18] you take too much on you
[1:20] seeing all the congregation the holy
[1:22] every one of them
[1:24] and the lord is among them
[1:26] wherefore then lift you up yourselves
[1:29] above the congregation
[1:31] of the lord
[1:32] and when moses heard it
[1:34] he fell upon his face
[1:37] and he spake unto color and said to all
[1:39] his company said even tomorrow
[1:42] the lord will show who are his
[1:45] and who is holy
[1:46] and will cause him to come near unto him
[1:49] even him whom he has chosen
[1:51] will he cause to come near unto him amen
[1:56] you may be seated may the lord have a
[1:58] blessing to the reading of his word
[2:01] praise the lord
[2:03] amen
[2:04] i would like to uh
[2:06] take a little thought this evening
[2:08] uh
[2:10] i pray that you just listen to what is
[2:12] in our heart
[2:14] um i want to take a thought the
[2:16] declaration of independence
[2:20] the declaration of independence
[2:24] which we know that we just recently as a
[2:27] country
[2:28] celebrated that day
[2:30] uh which we also call it uh
[2:33] the fourth of july but uh
[2:36] i was reading the history about these
[2:39] things
[2:40] i don't know the deep deep history i
[2:42] don't get in depth in it but i just read
[2:44] enough
[2:45] that catches my attention
[2:48] and then i began to read a few things
[2:50] about it i'm pretty sure many of you
[2:52] know what it is
[2:53] but
[2:54] i'm gonna just go over it briefly
[2:57] what it is
[2:58] and because i believe
[3:00] everything in the natural pretty much
[3:03] you can see spiritual types in it
[3:05] that's what i believe especially when
[3:07] it's happening to a country
[3:09] on a national scale of things like that
[3:13] even inventions when something newly
[3:15] being invented a lot of times you can
[3:17] see a spiritual type inside of that just
[3:20] like the prophet when he preached a
[3:21] message countdown he was just looking at
[3:24] astronauts and things like that and it
[3:26] caught his attention
[3:27] so there's a lot of things catch my
[3:29] attention sometimes i might hear a word
[3:31] or so and it just sticks in my mind
[3:34] and i can't get it out my mind i just go
[3:36] study upon that word
[3:38] that's kind of what i normally do
[3:40] but i decided to uh look up some things
[3:43] on the declaration of independence and i
[3:46] find it to be quite interesting because
[3:49] to me it's it's the is fitting this age
[3:52] that we're living in
[3:53] now in our case when it comes to the
[3:56] declaration of independence we
[3:58] understand that when america started we
[4:00] know the history of it how that we was
[4:02] coming here for freedom of religion
[4:05] running from the catholics and so forth
[4:07] like that and just wanted to have
[4:08] freedom of religion
[4:10] and then when our country began to get
[4:12] established and so forth and it's my
[4:14] understanding is correct
[4:16] uh i think we was on a british rule
[4:19] british trying to rule us or european
[4:21] something like that i just can't quite
[4:22] remember all of it
[4:24] but i know when the declaration of
[4:26] independence was written it was written
[4:28] because they wanted to be free
[4:31] because the word independence means to
[4:34] be free
[4:35] amen that's what that word mean but it
[4:38] says here i just wrote some of their
[4:40] notes down they say independence day
[4:42] also called fourth of july
[4:45] in the united states the annual
[4:47] celebration of nationhood it
[4:50] commemorates the passage of the
[4:51] declaration of independence by the
[4:54] continental congress on july 4th
[4:57] 1776
[4:59] independence day is a celebration on
[5:02] monday july the 4th which is past
[5:05] a man i mean couple weeks ago in the
[5:07] united states so i begin to look into
[5:10] all these things
[5:11] and look into the words
[5:13] uh i look at the word declaration
[5:17] the word declaration it means a formal
[5:20] or an explicit statement or an
[5:22] announcement in other words uh you got
[5:25] something that you want to put out there
[5:27] something that you want to say you want
[5:29] to declare something
[5:31] amen and then it says here in the
[5:34] declaration of independ in declaration
[5:36] of independence i'm just going to read
[5:39] from the first portions of it of what it
[5:42] says when they begin to write this
[5:44] declaration which it was several men
[5:46] involved in uh
[5:48] writing this writing these things up
[5:51] it says it said we hold these truths
[5:55] to be self-evident
[5:57] that all men are created equal now
[6:00] naturally
[6:02] when uh
[6:03] we was wanting our freedom here in
[6:04] america to be free from the british
[6:07] naturally that was fine you know i can
[6:09] understand that i really do understand
[6:11] that then it said that all men are
[6:14] created equal
[6:16] they say that they are endowed
[6:19] by their creator with certain and
[6:22] illinois inalienable rights
[6:25] that's what it says it says inalienable
[6:28] rights and and then so i went and looked
[6:30] at the word an
[6:31] ineligible what that kind of meant
[6:34] because i didn't know what that word
[6:35] meant so i said i'll just look it up and
[6:37] just see what it means that means uh
[6:41] i just had the definition here i think
[6:43] it means um
[6:44] rights that can't be taken away
[6:47] so in other words they're saying these
[6:49] are the rights our creator giving us our
[6:52] ineligible rights that can't be taken
[6:55] away
[6:56] then it said that among these it begins
[7:00] to tell what the rights are it said
[7:02] among these are life
[7:05] liberty and the pursuit of happiness
[7:09] now it's interesting that when obama
[7:13] passed the hate crime law this is what
[7:15] he used
[7:16] but the part that he used i actually got
[7:19] this on my computer he made sure he used
[7:22] the third part when he said the pursuit
[7:24] of happiness
[7:26] he said because he feel that every he
[7:28] said this this has been something we've
[7:30] been fighting for decades and he said
[7:33] and today uh this is a victory that's
[7:36] what obama said he said everybody should
[7:38] have that right to choose
[7:40] their into their own in the pursuit of
[7:43] happiness but if they realize what they
[7:46] said in the declaration of independent
[7:48] they're talking about that
[7:52] that men are created equal that they are
[7:54] endowed by the creator with sudden
[7:57] unalienable rights now the creator
[7:59] didn't give them that right
[8:01] can we say man to a man to marry a man a
[8:04] woman married a woman so that's a little
[8:06] twisted up
[8:08] can we say man but notice it that among
[8:11] these are life liberty and the pursuit
[8:14] of happiness other words
[8:16] what we can do what we want to do
[8:18] live the way we want to live we want our
[8:20] freedoms to be able to do what we want
[8:23] to do and then it stated in here that to
[8:26] secure these right
[8:29] right in other words we want to make
[8:30] sure
[8:31] our rights are secured
[8:34] and it says
[8:36] to secure these rights governments
[8:39] are instituted among
[8:41] men
[8:43] deriving their just powers from the
[8:45] consent of the governed in other words
[8:49] amen then it said then whenever any form
[8:53] of government
[8:54] becomes destructive of these ends it is
[8:58] the right of the people to alter
[9:01] or to abolish and institute new
[9:04] government in other words when the
[9:06] government is not doing what we want to
[9:08] do
[9:08] it's our people we have the right as
[9:11] people to get into the office who we
[9:14] want to put in them to fit our desire of
[9:17] what we want
[9:19] can we say man that's why we are
[9:21] democracy country we can choose that's
[9:24] why we select our governments and all
[9:26] these things which uh we say we select
[9:29] but i'm here to tell you just that i
[9:30] don't want to bush above god select
[9:34] can we say man because the bible tells
[9:36] us god he sets up kings he sets them
[9:38] down god let whoever he wants to be in
[9:41] the office for his purpose to be
[9:43] fulfilled can we say man even the
[9:46] prophet tells us about these crooked
[9:48] voting machines and stuff all like this
[9:50] all these things god already know who's
[9:51] going to be the president even if the
[9:53] world be here another 10 years god
[9:55] already know who it's going to be
[9:57] whoever it's going to be it's going to
[9:58] be somebody that's going to fit god's
[10:00] purpose will perfect will it for god's
[10:03] purpose but here it is the rights of the
[10:06] people that's why when they get somebody
[10:08] voted in because you got to understand
[10:11] something especially in south carolina
[10:13] now we got people trying to get voted in
[10:15] for this
[10:16] a seat in the house and so forth you
[10:19] begin to see little uh uh flyers
[10:22] everywhere just everywhere but what's so
[10:24] interesting about politics
[10:26] all of those politicians to get elected
[10:29] they're gonna tell you what they want
[10:31] you to believe
[10:33] whether they believe it or not they're
[10:35] gonna they're gonna find out what's in
[10:37] the mind of the people what the people
[10:39] want then they're gonna start making
[10:41] promises i promise you you you get me
[10:44] into the office this is what i'm going
[10:46] to do i'm going to take care of all of
[10:47] this but soon as they get voted they
[10:49] don't do none of it in other words they
[10:51] say gotcha a me and now now i'm going to
[10:54] express what i really want to do
[10:58] that's politics can we say man it's just
[11:01] like i remember when obama got elected
[11:03] you know i used to hear amongst the
[11:05] black people and how we got obama obama
[11:09] and then all of a sudden about five
[11:10] months six months later i said man i
[11:12] wish i never voted for that man look
[11:14] what he doing i said well you only voted
[11:16] for him because he's black
[11:19] just to be prized that's the only reason
[11:21] why you did oh he black that's now you
[11:23] see what you voted for and so forth so
[11:26] they all make promises of what they're
[11:28] going to do but once they get in office
[11:30] they're going to start trying to fulfill
[11:32] their agenda
[11:33] but notice it's the rights of the people
[11:37] in other words the rights of the people
[11:39] when the government that they choose is
[11:41] not doing what they want to do they can
[11:43] either alter
[11:45] or abolish you know impeach we got to
[11:48] get them out of the office we need to do
[11:50] what we want to do that's the rights of
[11:52] the people and it's in our declaration
[11:55] of independence
[11:57] that's what the declaration dependence
[11:59] kind of in a nutshell is all about but
[12:01] what's so interesting life liberty and
[12:04] the pursuit
[12:06] of happiness
[12:08] praise the lord when i began to read
[12:10] that especially when it said there these
[12:13] are inalienable rights that our creator
[12:17] uh
[12:18] that are endowed by their creator with
[12:21] certain inalienable rights now
[12:23] inalienable and unalienable are actually
[12:27] kind of the same word i think you say
[12:28] one of them is approval plural and one
[12:30] of them is an adjective but they're kind
[12:32] of the same but what i find that's
[12:34] interesting you go right into the church
[12:36] a book the prophet of god said what the
[12:39] church
[12:40] had at pentecost is her inalienable
[12:43] rights
[12:44] amen he said originally she had the pure
[12:47] word of god she had the power of the
[12:49] spirit manifested in diverse signs and
[12:51] wonders and gifts of the holy ghost now
[12:54] they're going to declare that in the
[12:55] declaration of independence these are
[12:58] rights we're going to want nobody to
[13:00] take them away now the prophet god use
[13:02] the prophet to let us know what our
[13:03] rights are our rights are it's the word
[13:06] of god that's our rights to have
[13:08] everything that god promised us in this
[13:11] age it belongs to us and we gonna let
[13:13] nobody take that away from us
[13:16] can we say amen but now the declaration
[13:19] of independence
[13:21] people want their freedom they want
[13:23] their liberty they want to pursue their
[13:25] own way or happiness i find that is
[13:28] fitting to the leonicy and age on the
[13:30] spiritual sides people rights rights of
[13:34] the people this age have declared to god
[13:37] we want our independence
[13:40] we have a declaration of independence we
[13:42] want to live how you want to live
[13:44] whatever we want to do to fulfill our
[13:46] happiness lord they declaring this
[13:48] against god
[13:50] this is exactly what this age has done
[13:52] declare this against god we want our
[13:55] freedom we want our liberty and we want
[13:57] to pursue our own happiness regardless
[14:00] of what your word says
[14:02] but i want to go to your heaven
[14:06] that's what this world has actually done
[14:08] they have declared their declaration of
[14:11] independence against god
[14:14] can we say amen and then the prophet
[14:16] began to say this he says in the resume
[14:20] of the church ages he says i really like
[14:22] how he began to bring things down and
[14:25] begin to break him down because he said
[14:27] in the in the blue church eight book he
[14:29] said this time we haven't set forth the
[14:31] history of how the churches of these
[14:33] things happen he said we want to try to
[14:35] establish that now so he began to go
[14:37] back into the history of things he says
[14:40] i like how he began to break it all down
[14:42] he said the birth
[14:44] the birth of the church
[14:47] was at pentecost
[14:50] he said as the first adam was given a
[14:52] bribe fresh
[14:54] from the hand of god it was undefiled
[14:57] for a brief span
[14:59] so was christ the last adam giving a
[15:03] bribe per and fresh at pentecost and she
[15:06] remains separate and undefiled for some
[15:09] time so you got to watch the pattern
[15:12] he began to talk about when adam when
[15:15] god gave uh
[15:16] adam his wife she come fresh from the
[15:19] hands of god and she was undefiled for a
[15:22] short span that he says can we say amen
[15:25] did he begin to type it with pentecost
[15:27] because you remember on the pentecost on
[15:30] the day of pentecost uh
[15:32] that was the birth of the church but he
[15:34] said for a short time just like eve for
[15:38] a short time was undefiled
[15:40] so after pentecost when did the church
[15:43] start beginning to get defiled again it
[15:46] was under the ephesian church age when
[15:48] that nicholas and spirit was coming back
[15:50] up in the church to defile the church to
[15:52] make it powerless to make it lukewarm
[15:55] that's what it began to happen again so
[15:57] we find that even in the opening of the
[15:59] word god gave a fresh anointing to the
[16:02] bride of jesus christ but now the
[16:04] spirit's trying to slip back up in there
[16:06] can we say man to my amen to try to
[16:09] defile god's bride but she's too late
[16:12] can we say man because it's been
[16:14] prophesied god bride is not going to
[16:16] fall she's not going to be defiled she's
[16:18] going to overcome in this age it is the
[16:21] exact same pattern taking place
[16:23] amen but then he began to type these
[16:25] things amen then he began to give the
[16:28] scripture like in the book of acts how
[16:30] they was praising god having the favor
[16:32] with all the people and the lord added
[16:35] to the church daily such as to be saved
[16:38] he began to express how that at the day
[16:40] of pentecost how the manifestation would
[16:42] take place and the gift was taking place
[16:45] how the believer was knitted together
[16:47] all these wonderful things was taking
[16:50] place but the devil was also there amen
[16:53] saying now i got to find a way to defile
[16:56] these people see one thing you got to
[16:58] understand about the devil if he can't
[17:00] beat you he'll join you
[17:03] then when he join you he'll try to
[17:04] defile you
[17:06] those are his tactic those are his ways
[17:08] can we say amen praise the lord and the
[17:11] devil know how to act like a christian
[17:15] amen he knew how to act very well just
[17:17] like a christian because he know how a
[17:19] life christian life's supposed to be so
[17:21] he knows how to act it out
[17:23] can we say praise the lord then you know
[17:25] the prophet began to give the different
[17:27] scriptures uh or how god was doing and
[17:31] man things were manifesting in the
[17:33] church he said how long
[17:35] this continues we do not know but one
[17:38] day
[17:40] excuse me
[17:46] he said how long this continues we do
[17:48] not know
[17:49] but one day even as eve was tempted and
[17:53] seduced by satan so the church was
[17:56] contaminated by the entrance
[17:59] of an antichrist
[18:00] spirit
[18:02] amen now listen how he put this
[18:05] he said
[18:06] what specifically
[18:08] was in her midst that caused the fall
[18:12] he said what but revelation
[18:14] 2 6 the deeds of the nicolaitans
[18:18] now look now at the declaration of
[18:20] independence this the declaration of
[18:23] independence is all about
[18:26] people
[18:27] governing themselves to what they want
[18:30] and how they want things to be and if it
[18:32] don't be the way they want it to be they
[18:34] can abolish it or they can alter it
[18:37] can we say amen so now listen to what he
[18:39] says he said already the first age
[18:43] had turned from following the per word
[18:46] of god they turned from god's demand
[18:49] notice he said they turned from god's
[18:52] demand of a church
[18:54] absolutely depending on him see god has
[18:58] always always will wants his church to
[19:01] be dependent on him not themselves god
[19:05] don't want us to be dependent on
[19:06] ourselves he want us to be dependent on
[19:08] him and how do we be dependent on god is
[19:11] by putting his word before all things
[19:14] can we say amen but now he began to talk
[19:16] about how the antichrist spirit began to
[19:19] come in amongst the first church and
[19:21] then he said they turned from god's
[19:22] demand of a church
[19:24] absolutely depending on him depending
[19:27] entirely upon god to fulfill his word
[19:30] from start to finish apart from human
[19:34] government
[19:35] other words we want god to fulfill what
[19:38] he's saying apart from human government
[19:41] we want god to do it not no kind of
[19:43] human government to do it notice what he
[19:46] says now he said to
[19:48] nicolaitanism
[19:49] which is organizing a human government
[19:54] within the church
[19:55] so that nicolaitan spirit is actually
[19:58] making a declaration to god
[20:01] we're going to alter your word we're
[20:03] going to change your word we want
[20:04] everything to fit the way that we want
[20:06] to fit and live how we want to live or
[20:09] whatever your words say we're going to
[20:11] change it
[20:12] that's what they're trying to do to the
[20:13] master they want to change it try to say
[20:15] the prophet didn't mean this and he
[20:16] didn't he meant exactly what god told
[20:18] him to say what are we understanding or
[20:21] not he meant exactly what he said
[20:23] so who are we to alter it whenever
[20:25] somebody try to take this message change
[20:27] it what you're doing is on a declaration
[20:30] to god you want your independence you
[20:33] want your freedom to do whatever you
[20:35] want to do
[20:38] it's exactly what it is
[20:40] yes sir
[20:41] which is organized organizing the human
[20:44] government
[20:45] within the church he said which which as
[20:48] all governments do
[20:51] legislate for the people see government
[20:55] legislate
[20:57] for the people amen whatever you want
[20:59] them to do you pro you bring it to them
[21:01] you press them then they they'll try to
[21:03] fulfill that for you
[21:05] you see that's what we was reading here
[21:07] in the book of numbers
[21:09] that was a declaration
[21:12] that they brought to moses against god
[21:16] exactly what that was
[21:18] praise the lord let's look at that
[21:20] scripture again
[21:25] they come to moses
[21:30] they find the scripture again
[21:35] that was pretty strong how they come to
[21:37] it
[21:39] it ain't no different today what people
[21:41] do
[21:43] he said they rose up before moses
[21:46] with certain other children of israel
[21:50] i like all the scripture worded not just
[21:52] anybody
[21:53] of the children of israel certain
[21:57] so the devil anointed them
[21:59] to pick out the right ones
[22:02] amen he didn't know anybody
[22:05] listen to what he says
[22:07] certain other children israel
[22:09] 250 princes of the assembly
[22:14] famous in the congregation men of renown
[22:17] other words
[22:18] nathan and cora picked people with
[22:21] influence
[22:22] and he knew they got some influence on
[22:25] the other people so we need to pick the
[22:27] right ones to throw the influence the
[22:30] same pattern that the devil was using
[22:33] here it haven't changed today
[22:36] who are some of the most biggest
[22:38] influences it's preachers from the
[22:40] pulpit
[22:42] can we say man that's why the devil or
[22:44] not certain one of them to try to tear
[22:46] down this message what god given us this
[22:48] day not not just to anybody he wants
[22:51] somebody with some influence that
[22:52] they're known that's why i tell a
[22:54] preacher you need to humble yourself if
[22:56] god bless you got doors open for you
[22:58] you're able to go here you over go there
[23:00] you got to thank god for that but i'm
[23:02] here to tell you the more you go out the
[23:04] bigger target you come for the devil
[23:07] to get you to fall
[23:09] because that he know if he can get you
[23:11] to fall he can do damage you got to
[23:13] understand about something about satan
[23:16] satan is more interested in you
[23:19] he yeah he wants you to die he want to
[23:21] kill you but the devil is more
[23:24] interested in a backslider living
[23:28] than killing you and taking you to the
[23:29] grave
[23:31] he get more done through a backslider
[23:34] that is alive then this taking
[23:36] somebody's life
[23:37] you say oh where you going with that
[23:39] brother burly no now simpson
[23:42] why did they kill samson
[23:47] they didn't want to kill him
[23:49] they wanted to make sport out of him
[23:52] they just put his eyes out it wasn't
[23:54] more glory for them to see a defeated
[23:57] son of god still alive
[24:00] that was more glory for the devil
[24:02] that's so they didn't want to kill him
[24:04] they want to make mockery out of it
[24:05] that's why that's why the devil loved
[24:08] backsliders
[24:10] amen he loved people that are still
[24:12] alive and bring a reproach to this
[24:14] gospel so that other people can see it
[24:16] and discourage them so people be like
[24:19] wow this brother this system was going
[24:21] 20 years and now that i'm falling is
[24:23] this message right it's this gospel
[24:25] right i'm here to tell you this message
[24:27] is right i don't care if the whole world
[24:30] falls very well is gonna stand because i
[24:32] got the holy ghost and the holy ghost is
[24:34] a seal it'll keep you not from revival
[24:37] to revival it'll keep you until the day
[24:39] of your redemption that's what the holy
[24:41] ghost will do to you
[24:43] amen
[24:44] praise the lord
[24:46] so we're so thankful for that that's
[24:48] what the devil loves to do
[24:50] because the backslider the bible said is
[24:53] full
[24:54] of their own ways
[24:57] i don't personally don't even like
[24:58] talking to them
[25:00] because i got no time to hear their i
[25:02] already know they're full
[25:04] the bible tell me they're full
[25:06] of their own ways so what good is going
[25:08] to do me to sit down two or three hours
[25:11] listen to their ways
[25:14] as soon as i detect who they are say go
[25:17] you don't want no help
[25:20] we're here to help people not debate
[25:22] with them
[25:23] and you know when somebody wants help
[25:26] hey man some people just want company
[25:29] misery loves company
[25:31] can we say man i ain't got time for it
[25:34] my brothers and sisters but people have
[25:36] brought a declaration against god
[25:39] against this message declaring to god
[25:41] just like dayton and cora went to moses
[25:44] people doing the same thing they go i
[25:46] declare i want my independence
[25:49] the devil to deceive people so much that
[25:52] even when they leave the message they
[25:54] say the bible has come a new book to me
[26:00] no it has not
[26:02] yeah that's not
[26:04] the opening of the word make the bible a
[26:06] new book to us you don't reject it how
[26:07] can the bible come and do what the bible
[26:09] has now become veiled to you
[26:13] can we say praise the lord
[26:14] god open eyes the devil closes them
[26:19] yes sir
[26:20] declaring against god
[26:23] they rose up against moses gather
[26:25] themselves against moses and against
[26:27] aaron see that's the type against the
[26:29] prophet gets the priest so you're gonna
[26:31] have the same thing today they're gonna
[26:33] go against malachi 4 and they'll go
[26:35] against ministers that are trying to
[26:37] hold this message in a balance
[26:40] see today when you try to balance things
[26:43] that's when people get offended
[26:45] no it got to be a balance this message
[26:48] did not come to tempt the scales this
[26:50] message come to balance the skills it
[26:52] come to balance everything
[26:55] this message to balance your life
[26:58] come on now it'll balance your church
[27:01] it'll balance you
[27:03] because this is a balanced message
[27:06] praise the lord
[27:09] it's exactly right
[27:12] and you're wondering why
[27:13] a lot of things happening
[27:16] i don't get offended
[27:18] hey this is just like walking on a
[27:20] tightrope
[27:22] you know when you walk on a tightrope
[27:23] they use a stick
[27:25] you have seen the people using them
[27:26] sticks
[27:28] but if you notice they're not falling
[27:31] but it's a lot of movement in the stick
[27:34] why is that the stick is what helping
[27:36] them keep that balance
[27:38] so that's why we don't mind questions in
[27:40] the message
[27:42] when somebody asks this question this
[27:44] question we gonna study it and we start
[27:46] tossing it but we don't stop we keep
[27:50] moving
[27:51] because we're looking for that balance
[27:53] and we know god if you got the right
[27:55] attitude god will give you that balance
[28:00] yes he will he'll give it to you every
[28:02] time
[28:03] i'm so thankful for that world
[28:06] renowned famous
[28:08] in the congregation you see they already
[28:11] had pride
[28:12] thinking that there was something in the
[28:13] first place and i never knew exactly how
[28:16] to choose them that's why i humble
[28:18] myself that pride i'm gonna tell you
[28:20] something friend
[28:21] god know how to let pride out of your
[28:23] life
[28:26] he knows exactly how to suck it out of
[28:27] it whenever you get to a place you think
[28:29] you're something get ready for a fall
[28:35] i'm telling you these things from
[28:36] experiences
[28:39] i remember one time
[28:41] i gonna name the country
[28:46] i preached my heart out
[28:48] i really did
[28:50] at a service
[28:52] service was over
[28:54] a guy walked up to me
[28:57] he said
[28:59] a good service
[29:01] he said but you know i kind of like how
[29:03] your pastor preached you know michael t
[29:06] he said no that's kind of well the
[29:07] preaching that i like
[29:09] i said
[29:10] okay he said but it was a good service
[29:15] i walked off
[29:17] because i know i had a second service
[29:20] i walked off
[29:21] went in the room
[29:23] started studying
[29:27] come to the second service
[29:29] i remember the message i preached i
[29:30] preached a message called the truthiness
[29:32] of pentecost
[29:33] oh i preached my heart out of church
[29:35] jumping and i preach i preach i preach
[29:39] then when the surf was over the guy come
[29:41] up to me
[29:43] that's it
[29:45] that's what i'm talking about
[29:47] but when i went to my room
[29:51] god came
[29:52] and spoke directly to me
[29:55] he said you just preached to one person
[29:59] in that congregation
[30:01] to prove a point
[30:06] it let all my air out
[30:09] i got in the pulpit to prove a point and
[30:11] preach to one person
[30:13] even though the people was enjoying it
[30:16] i knew who i was preaching to to prove a
[30:18] point i got revelation too
[30:21] i can preach like michael t i can do it
[30:23] i can lay some things out
[30:25] but i learned from that
[30:27] i'll be me
[30:29] i'll preach exactly what he wants me to
[30:31] preach
[30:32] but he took god two times
[30:35] expect me good
[30:37] for my eyes to wake up
[30:39] another time it was at a youth meeting
[30:42] oh i preached
[30:45] i was young man i don't do that now
[30:47] a young fella boy i preach
[30:50] but paul i come out of that youth
[30:52] meeting
[30:54] chess all stuck out
[30:56] people was at the altar
[30:58] crying
[31:01] i come out it was a little boy came up
[31:03] to me
[31:04] he said hey
[31:06] yeah
[31:07] he said you're the most funniest
[31:09] preacher i ever heard in my life
[31:12] i said
[31:15] i just eased off
[31:17] and walked back
[31:18] god used a child
[31:21] to let me know i'm nothing
[31:24] without him
[31:27] god knows how to humble you
[31:29] he knows exactly that's why when i see
[31:31] people get dealing with high heads i
[31:34] said that's that's okay i believe that
[31:35] they're sons and daughters of god but
[31:37] did god know exactly where to stick the
[31:40] needle in you and let that air out of
[31:42] you he knows exactly how to do it see
[31:45] i'm just being honest some of you
[31:46] probably been through but you don't tell
[31:48] nobody but i'm just being honest
[31:50] god knows how to keep us humble because
[31:53] that's where power is at
[31:55] when you can humble yourself
[31:58] that's where the power is at right there
[32:00] but everybody want to be strong and
[32:01] brave and be known
[32:03] and forceful it's not all about their
[32:05] friends and we all it's all about giving
[32:07] god all of the glory and everything
[32:11] can we say praise the lord but there was
[32:13] a declaration
[32:15] that they actually bring against god for
[32:17] their independence
[32:19] moses did not choose god
[32:22] god chose moses
[32:25] the bible also said that god in the book
[32:28] of psalms it said god elevated moses
[32:32] moses did not elevate himself
[32:35] can we say ma'am god elevated brother
[32:38] branham
[32:39] brother branham did not elevate himself
[32:41] god is going to elevate his bride she's
[32:44] not going to elevate herself
[32:46] god is going to do it god is doing it
[32:50] can we say praise the lord so all these
[32:52] little things that are happening going
[32:53] on is all for a purpose and it's all for
[32:56] a reason but they don't have they don't
[32:58] brought a independent declaration spirit
[33:02] against the word of god that's what
[33:05] don't happen that's what's happening
[33:06] right now in this day
[33:10] can we say praise the lord
[33:12] i'm going to say this
[33:15] and i'll close
[33:20] we're living in a world
[33:23] all just thinking about this
[33:25] we live in a world of services
[33:29] it's a service for everything
[33:32] we got to have doctors
[33:35] nurses
[33:36] plumbers
[33:37] electrician it's a service for
[33:39] everything
[33:42] even the garbage man it's a service
[33:45] i begin to look in all of the things
[33:47] that for this uh society
[33:50] for the countries to move it got to be
[33:52] services to help this thing go
[33:55] i seen a video
[33:57] of the the garbage
[34:00] that they disposed daily
[34:03] in new york
[34:04] it's unbelievable daily not just one day
[34:08] daily so you and i
[34:11] certain day of the week you just pull
[34:12] your trash can out there
[34:14] there it goes they come and get it when
[34:15] institutes or whatever but that's a
[34:17] process all that stuff somebody had a
[34:19] service it goes so many different places
[34:22] before i get to where it's going
[34:23] that's a service
[34:25] i was thinking
[34:26] of this this country we wouldn't even be
[34:29] able to function without services
[34:32] because you got to have somebody to do
[34:33] something this
[34:34] and i i was shocked i was working on an
[34:36] individual house uh i'm pretty sure
[34:39] y'all got it up here too they got
[34:40] services they'll come to your house and
[34:42] change your oil in your car
[34:45] i said wow how lazy can you get
[34:49] now some people i know they do it's not
[34:51] because they're lazy because they don't
[34:53] have time cause some people are office
[34:55] people they just ain't got time to do it
[34:57] what i understand but i'm just like man
[34:59] what kind of service can i just think of
[35:02] right
[35:03] because they're out there
[35:06] they even got a laundry service
[35:08] you don't have to go to the laundry and
[35:09] take your clothes they come and get them
[35:11] take them iron them up and bring them
[35:13] right to you
[35:14] now we got uber we got all of these
[35:16] things services sir doordash all of
[35:19] these things
[35:20] but if we need all of these things so
[35:22] this uh society think and function
[35:26] god got something he need
[35:28] to
[35:31] he has a bride
[35:33] god has a five-fold ministry
[35:35] for us to be his servants his sons and
[35:38] daughters well we know we're his bride
[35:40] he's an israel servants we're his bride
[35:42] but god got you and me here so he could
[35:44] live through us
[35:46] to finish go to the message what is the
[35:48] holy ghost giving for he said it's for
[35:50] to finish the work the work that jesus
[35:53] did
[35:54] uh stopped it well at pentecost he said
[35:57] the holy ghost was given to the disciple
[35:59] so the ministry of jesus christ could
[36:01] continue on and that is the same reason
[36:03] why we have the holy ghost today so this
[36:05] ministry of jesus christ can continue on
[36:08] he doing it through
[36:10] us that's the reason why he give us the
[36:13] holy ghost he said the holy ghost is
[36:14] your comforter it's your rapture it's
[36:17] your salvation it's your peace it's your
[36:19] joy everything is in the holy ghost when
[36:21] you're born again you got it all
[36:25] just the same as a baby when it comes
[36:27] out of his mama wound though it's a baby
[36:29] everything is already in that baby to
[36:31] become a woman or a man fully grown it's
[36:34] in there but it has to grow
[36:36] the same as us being born again
[36:38] everything you have in you immediately
[36:39] when you're born again for the rapture
[36:41] is in you
[36:42] but still we have to grow
[36:44] daily in our walks with christ we grow
[36:48] daily
[36:49] can we say praise the lord amen and i
[36:52] believe we should grow daily
[36:55] i believe we should be able to look
[36:56] today
[36:57] and see something i grew a little higher
[36:59] from yesterday
[37:00] my thinking is a little different from
[37:02] yesterday hey man i think we should be
[37:04] able to reflect back on some things and
[37:06] we can see i have been growing by his
[37:08] grace
[37:10] is that right
[37:11] and you know so god has a bride
[37:15] regardless of all of the things that's
[37:17] happening
[37:18] he's going to have a people that's going
[37:20] to overcome all of these obstacles
[37:22] in this day
[37:24] because it's christ in us
[37:26] the hope of glory
[37:28] can we say amen
[37:29] i'ma say this
[37:32] some of you probably read this article
[37:35] uh
[37:36] about this uh airplane pilot falling
[37:39] asleep
[37:42] in his airplane
[37:44] i'ma paraphrase it i can't quite
[37:46] remember it word by word
[37:49] i was just reading it recently
[37:51] and it really stuck it really stuck to
[37:53] me
[37:56] it was these two lawyers and out in
[37:58] alaska
[38:00] and um
[38:01] i guess they were doing a case over
[38:03] there
[38:04] so they was getting ready to fly back to
[38:06] anchorage
[38:08] and they ran across a preacher
[38:11] a pilot
[38:13] and the pilot told them
[38:15] he said i could save you some money i
[38:17] got my own private plane i can take you
[38:19] back to anchorage now this lawyer guy he
[38:22] said
[38:25] how did he say he don't know why he
[38:27] agreed to do it from out of his best
[38:28] judgment he said the man talked them
[38:30] into it to get into the plane and said
[38:33] i'll fly you to anchorage he said he
[38:35] just did it
[38:37] of his best judgment
[38:39] then
[38:40] he said when he got there
[38:42] it went into the hangar seen the
[38:44] airplane airplane clean
[38:46] everything looking nice and stuff he
[38:48] said then it gets into the plane
[38:50] one of them sat in the back one of them
[38:52] sat in the front then the pilot takes
[38:53] off
[38:55] he said when they started flying
[38:58] the pilot said there are some clouds
[39:00] coming
[39:02] he said
[39:04] when i get in cloud he said i pass out
[39:08] now the lawyer thought he was actually
[39:11] joking
[39:12] he said it was a cloudy day that day i
[39:14] mean why do you even want to try this
[39:17] so when they got up there in the clouds
[39:19] he said he's looking at the man
[39:21] and then all of a sudden just assures
[39:23] the world
[39:25] the man passed out
[39:28] then the one that was sitting in the
[39:30] back
[39:31] he told them get the radio
[39:33] you know i can't remember the words that
[39:36] you they call it airplane language i
[39:38] don't it's a word that they use but he
[39:40] began to say help help help help
[39:43] but there was a plane in the area a
[39:45] cargo plane in the area picked up the
[39:47] help thing and he said y'all don't
[39:49] understand uh it
[39:51] it's some kind of word pilot talk
[39:54] and they said no sir he said we're on a
[39:57] plane and the pilot
[39:59] has passed out
[40:01] so the man that was in the freighter
[40:03] plane he said okay he said i'm going to
[40:05] go in a circle
[40:07] he said i'm going to go in a circle he's
[40:08] because if i keep i think he was heading
[40:10] to tokyo he said because if i keep
[40:12] flying he said i'm going to lose you he
[40:14] saw him a circle around he said the
[40:16] first thing i want to do is get you in
[40:18] contact with the uh what they call it
[40:22] is it flight command
[40:24] control tower he said i need to get you
[40:26] in contact with the control tower
[40:29] and then all of a sudden
[40:33] the control tower come on the plane
[40:37] and then the man said hello my name is
[40:39] so-and-so
[40:41] i'm calling you from the control tower
[40:43] he said yeah he said now understand
[40:45] you you got a situation
[40:47] he said you have a situation
[40:49] that the pilot has come passed out and
[40:52] they said yes
[40:54] he said now listen to me he said you
[40:56] gotta he's the one thing i got to get
[40:57] you to agree with
[40:59] he said what's that
[41:01] he said that you'll listen to my voice
[41:05] he said now you can't see me
[41:08] he's but i can see you first he said let
[41:11] me find where you're at
[41:13] so he looked at the radar
[41:15] he said now you can't see me
[41:17] he's but i can see you
[41:19] he said in four minutes
[41:21] you're gonna hit a mountain
[41:24] he said but if you listen to my voice
[41:28] he said i can get you home safe he said
[41:30] listen
[41:31] to my voice so all of a sudden
[41:36] uh i think he come back he got him away
[41:39] from the mountain
[41:40] when he got him away from the mountain
[41:42] and then he come back on the radio
[41:45] he said now
[41:46] you get ready to go through a bunch of
[41:47] clouds
[41:49] you know they can tell you all this
[41:50] stuff on them radar he said you get
[41:52] ready to go through a bunch of clouds he
[41:54] said it's going to get bumpy
[41:57] but what you still need to do is listen
[42:01] to my voice and the man said he was in
[42:04] the position he wasn't going to be like
[42:06] oh i got to listen to you he said oh no
[42:09] because in a situation like that
[42:11] you you'll be willing to listen to
[42:12] anything it's just like a drowning man
[42:14] you know a drowning man he'll drive
[42:16] he'll grab a toothpick
[42:18] if it floating right across and he'll
[42:19] reach and try to grab it
[42:22] so he said
[42:24] it's going to be bumpy
[42:25] it's going to be cloudy and i like what
[42:27] the man told him from the control place
[42:30] he said
[42:31] don't try to look at the storm
[42:35] he said because if you do
[42:37] you will die
[42:40] he said just listen to my voice
[42:43] and then all of a sudden he said that
[42:46] the man stopped talking to them
[42:48] now they're flying and he's bumping and
[42:49] bumping and bumping and they flying
[42:52] he said but then all of a sudden when
[42:54] all the bumping stopped they get out of
[42:55] the cloud he said the voice come back
[42:58] i said isn't that like our lord jesus
[43:00] christ
[43:02] sometimes you could be going through a
[43:04] bumpy storm
[43:06] but don't look at the storm
[43:08] you might can feel a lot of bumps and
[43:09] this going wrong that go wrong but don't
[43:12] look at that
[43:13] and then it'll seem like he ain't even
[43:15] there
[43:17] but faith should tell you he is there
[43:20] when that man said we didn't hear the
[43:21] voice for a while sometimes you don't
[43:23] hear god's voice
[43:25] for a while you want to hear it but you
[43:27] don't hear it you desire to hear it you
[43:29] don't hear it but that does not mean he
[43:32] is not there
[43:33] we know he is there because he promised
[43:38] and then all of a sudden
[43:39] when they went through all those bumps
[43:41] and storms he said then the voice came
[43:43] back on the radio
[43:46] while that man explaining all of this
[43:47] i'm looking at it totally different
[43:50] i said that's just like our lord when
[43:51] you went through something didn't
[43:53] understand why but when you don't made
[43:55] it through then he comes and speaks
[43:58] and then he tell you why
[44:01] this is why i let you go through that
[44:03] this is why this happened to you in our
[44:05] mind like lord why you just can't tell
[44:07] me up front what's going to go on that
[44:09] ain't the way he works
[44:10] because he got a test and he got to try
[44:13] your faith
[44:16] when jesus said man shall not live by
[44:19] bread alone
[44:20] but by every word proceedeth out of the
[44:22] mouth of god
[44:24] if you really want the impact of what
[44:26] jesus was saying in that scripture you
[44:28] have to go back to numbers
[44:31] to get the impact of it
[44:33] because remember the conversation well
[44:35] he said
[44:36] moses didn't give you that bread he said
[44:38] but my father from heaven gave you that
[44:41] bread so that gives us the authority to
[44:44] go back to see what that happened and it
[44:45] happened in numbers
[44:47] but the impact of it was god
[44:51] had them out in the wilderness god knew
[44:53] they was going to get hungry none of
[44:55] this surprised god
[44:57] because the bible said god suffered them
[45:01] to
[45:02] hunger he permitted them to hunger
[45:06] because god wanted to displace some
[45:08] things
[45:09] then they start telling oh you know we
[45:11] hungry you brought us out here in this
[45:12] wilderness to die and so forth and then
[45:14] you know here's the thing
[45:16] god said you tell them come tomorrow
[45:19] it's going to be they're going to have
[45:20] quail they're going to have uh what they
[45:23] call it manna we know it's called manna
[45:25] but you got to catch it
[45:27] when god told them
[45:29] that he was going to send it he spoke
[45:32] through a prophet and told them how to
[45:34] gather it
[45:38] because if god wouldn't have gave
[45:40] instructions they would have just jumped
[45:42] in there to
[45:43] fight me no i want more give me give
[45:45] them a note god said today you only pick
[45:48] so much
[45:52] look how that is that's why man can't
[45:54] live by bread alone but every word
[45:57] the manna the quail what's the bread
[46:00] but to tell them how much they can pick
[46:02] up and which day they can do it what's
[46:04] the word
[46:06] god testing them is they gonna keep the
[46:09] word they could have eaten and said
[46:11] come on man you already don't start out
[46:13] here you can tell me i can only get so
[46:15] much mother told him said no he said you
[46:17] pick up so much today
[46:19] and then when you do that don't lean
[46:21] none over it'll rot
[46:23] now think about moses telling them that
[46:25] they're like yeah whatever whatever
[46:27] whatever but you know what the next day
[46:29] it stinks just like moses told them
[46:32] because they they tried to go against
[46:34] the word like it ain't gonna happen then
[46:37] moses tell them if you don't pick up so
[46:39] much today and you try to wait till the
[46:41] sabbath to do it it ain't going to be
[46:43] none seen their mind is dropped today
[46:45] you drop tomorrow you're going to have
[46:46] to drop again guess what if they didn't
[46:48] do the pick up what they posted done
[46:50] saturday come on savage day when they
[46:53] they they can't make it fall
[46:55] because god was in control
[46:57] so god was proving them my word is what
[47:00] i say not what you want to do what you
[47:03] think i am the one that's in control
[47:06] and they was not keeping god's
[47:08] commandment that's how god does things
[47:13] and this man
[47:15] the voice
[47:18] kept talking to him
[47:20] and then he told him in the plane he
[47:22] said you're going to begin to descend
[47:24] down
[47:27] he said you're going to see some lights
[47:30] he said they're going to be in the shape
[47:31] of a cross
[47:34] he said when you see those lights
[47:36] i want you to know
[47:37] them the one's gonna guide you home
[47:40] now he said took them a couple times to
[47:42] try to land the plane but it got landed
[47:45] but what gets me
[47:47] after they landed
[47:50] well he said as soon as they land the
[47:51] plane
[47:52] that's when the pilot wakes up
[47:57] that's interesting
[47:59] but he said they got him
[48:01] and they put him in a motel that night
[48:04] he said then later on that night they
[48:05] heard a knock at the door i thought the
[48:06] man name was dave
[48:08] a knock at the door when the man knocked
[48:10] at the door
[48:13] he opened the door
[48:15] the lawyer opened the door
[48:18] he said how you doing
[48:19] he said you're dave i think it was dave
[48:22] he said yes he said he said i know
[48:25] he said i've never seen you till now
[48:28] he's but i remember your voice
[48:31] now i can put a face
[48:33] to the voice
[48:34] he said because it was the voice
[48:37] that i listened to got me here
[48:42] that's what the scripture says in the
[48:43] days
[48:45] of the voice
[48:47] of the seventh angel
[48:50] god didn't want us to focus on what he
[48:51] looked like
[48:54] people want to know if god black is he
[48:56] white is he pale i said i said where in
[48:58] the scripture
[49:00] that god commanded us to focus and
[49:01] figure figure out what he looks like
[49:05] i said it ain't there i said god ain't
[49:07] interesting for us to know what he
[49:08] looked like he's interested enough for
[49:11] us to lead and know what his word says
[49:15] was a fan you want to debate over color
[49:16] and all that's not bernie williams
[49:18] that's why he's in his word i said but
[49:19] if you really want to know what color
[49:21] god is
[49:22] i said you really want to know i can
[49:24] help you with that
[49:26] they said what do you mean i said
[49:27] whatever country you go to whoever was
[49:29] born again in that country that's god's
[49:31] color
[49:35] because that's god dwelling in them
[49:38] god dwelling in his bride if you want to
[49:41] know what color god is
[49:44] he wants us to hear this voice
[49:47] see it's not the fact listening to a
[49:50] tape hearing brother bannon's voice
[49:52] that ain't it
[49:54] it's the voice
[49:55] that's behind the voice
[49:59] because many people hear tapes every day
[50:01] still don't hear the message
[50:04] they don't hear what's behind the voice
[50:06] that's why you get those say well
[50:08] brother branham said just a man just a
[50:09] man no no no no i go back to the message
[50:12] unseen the uh the uns i
[50:15] can't even remember the title but you
[50:17] know the one that when god took over
[50:19] brother bread and body no looking to the
[50:21] unseen he said this
[50:23] this is not william branham
[50:25] this is a vessel that surrendered to me
[50:27] i'm using his voice
[50:30] god was behind the voice that's what i
[50:32] listened for
[50:34] jesus said my sheep
[50:36] will know my voice
[50:38] jesus was not talking about his literal
[50:40] voice
[50:42] because we don't have a clue what jesus
[50:44] voice sounded like
[50:45] his voice is in his word
[50:49] that's what he wants us to hear
[50:51] the people that brought a declaration
[50:53] of independence to god in this age and
[50:56] i'm here to tell them they're going to
[50:58] lose
[51:02] they're going to lose
[51:04] paul told him
[51:06] he said i seen your superstition to
[51:08] these inscriptions you got to this
[51:09] unknown god but that god that you talk
[51:11] upon so i got a declaration cause i want
[51:14] to declare him to you
[51:16] false i want to declare this god to you
[51:18] in other words paul said i'm going to
[51:19] make him known to you how did paul do it
[51:21] through the word because god was inside
[51:23] of paul
[51:25] god is in his bride how many of you
[51:27] believe the final voice is in the bride
[51:30] i believe that with all my heart that's
[51:32] why they ought to make us humble
[51:33] ourselves
[51:34] i never in my life and this time in the
[51:38] mess have seen so much attacks on
[51:39] marriages
[51:44] it's just happening everywhere
[51:47] attack on marriages because that's the
[51:49] devil
[51:51] the devil hates healthy marriages
[51:53] he can't stand it
[51:55] naturally or spiritual satan can not
[51:58] stand it but i'm here to tell i would
[52:01] challenge anybody
[52:03] you tell me you're born again
[52:05] you're born again
[52:06] your wife born again both of y'all born
[52:09] again
[52:10] now tell me why you got problems
[52:18] because the holy ghost inside of you
[52:20] will take you to the word and correct
[52:21] you
[52:25] it will correct you
[52:28] see we spend so much time trying to
[52:29] correct one another but not letting the
[52:32] word correct both of us
[52:35] the holy ghost will correct you in the
[52:38] word
[52:40] but selfishness
[52:42] in marriage is what kills them
[52:44] selfishness
[52:45] lack of communication finances all of
[52:48] these things kills a marriage
[52:50] and i promise you because they're not
[52:52] both relying on god
[52:54] for all those things if you don't know
[52:56] how to communicate with your wife
[52:58] i can help you with that easy
[53:02] go back to it when you was courtney
[53:07] you was willing to talk
[53:11] huh you was willing to talk
[53:13] because you want to convince her
[53:15] i'm the man
[53:22] didn't get married
[53:27] you okay
[53:29] why are you not talking
[53:32] and then man i got you now
[53:36] you should never stop that communication
[53:38] because if we don't communicate with one
[53:41] another in the marriage somebody's going
[53:42] to communicate with you
[53:46] and it's going to be old diablo
[53:51] exactly right he's going to communicate
[53:53] in your mind
[53:55] because he loves to tear up marriages
[53:58] healthy communication
[53:59] it just missed the devils up in marriage
[54:01] it messes him up
[54:03] huh
[54:05] i was just preaching at another church
[54:07] man i think i don't know if i offend him
[54:09] or not but i was being honest
[54:11] i said you know i said around the
[54:13] message we tell lies
[54:20] yeah
[54:22] oh i said i'm explaining to you friend
[54:25] that's when you asked your wife are you
[54:26] okay she said yeah
[54:29] and she knows she's not okay
[54:33] you asked her are you okay yeah
[54:36] and he know he's not okay
[54:40] you asked him again
[54:41] ain't nothing wrong with you no
[54:43] you ask again you sure ain't nothing
[54:45] wrong with you
[54:47] no
[54:48] what makes you think something is wrong
[54:50] with me
[54:54] when we are going to tell the truth
[54:56] now that's different
[54:58] if you're going through something but
[54:59] your faith don't come to a level you see
[55:01] the end
[55:02] that's different you can say i'm fine
[55:04] nothing wrong with me but when you know
[55:06] something wrong with you and you need
[55:08] your prayer partner you need your wife
[55:10] or your husband to help you through it
[55:12] you might always tell the truth
[55:14] yes i'm struggling
[55:16] i got a problem i'm going through
[55:18] something
[55:22] i know we don't want to um
[55:24] and it's hard for me to do that because
[55:26] we want to be macho
[55:29] you're going to say nah i'm going to
[55:30] show no weakness to my wife i want to
[55:32] know she got a strong man let me tell
[55:34] you show me a weak humble man that's a
[55:36] strong man
[55:39] that'll be willing to tell his wife his
[55:40] faults and his errors and so forth
[55:42] because he said hey i need you to pray
[55:44] for me listen what the prophet told
[55:46] about this woman this woman told her
[55:48] husband
[55:49] if you go out there
[55:51] and you mess up
[55:53] she should come back home
[55:56] i'll be waiting on you
[56:00] you our mind
[56:02] oh no i can't don't come back don't you
[56:04] come back here
[56:05] but i believe this
[56:07] by him telling her that
[56:09] and him seeing what kind of woman he got
[56:13] he would say how dare i even mess up
[56:15] with such a woman like this
[56:18] nah
[56:19] even though she would be waiting for me
[56:21] i ain't gonna mess up because this is a
[56:23] good woman
[56:27] that's exactly right
[56:28] but today nobody don't want to
[56:30] communicate we communicate with
[56:31] everybody else you know what most people
[56:33] that they might communicate with
[56:35] facebook more than they do that in life
[56:40] facebook
[56:42] i call it the vent television
[56:48] everybody want to vent vent vent when
[56:51] they should be catching the carriage
[56:52] upon jesus
[56:55] casting all your cares upon jesus
[56:58] all these things that wrapped up traps
[57:01] you're gonna use the wrong way and then
[57:04] you people put so much stuff on facebook
[57:06] and then you might go to a meeting you
[57:07] might see the person say
[57:09] are you okay
[57:11] and then we're like
[57:13] why are you asking me that oh the post
[57:15] that you posted i just want to know how
[57:17] you overcome that
[57:19] see all your information out there
[57:22] and you can be getting mad what's wrong
[57:23] with you you think i'm a weak christian
[57:25] whatever yeah you put it out there
[57:28] you created that they just responded
[57:33] praise the lord it's just the truth
[57:36] give me say amen give me give the lord a
[57:38] hand
[57:40] may god bless you tonight i'll start
[57:42] right there
[57:44] but this is what i want to help you just
[57:45] get this little short little thought
[57:47] that's in my heart
[57:49] that is the spirit of laodicea
[57:52] she had written a declaration
[57:54] of independence
[57:56] against
[57:57] the word of god
[57:59] saying
[58:01] i'm a widow i have need of nothing
[58:04] i'm going to live the way i want this is
[58:06] my rights these are my inalienable
[58:08] rights
[58:10] that's what they have told the lord
[58:11] jesus christ but the bride says
[58:14] lord i have no rights
[58:16] i let them all down lord because i want
[58:19] with what your word says for me about me
[58:22] to me that's what i want so i give
[58:25] myself away
[58:27] people are saying that someone i give
[58:28] myself away i give myself away that
[58:31] ought to be a true song
[58:32] that we literally just give ourselves
[58:34] away to it
[58:36] this is where it's supposed to be
[58:38] so he can't use us
[58:40] god said give me go give me give it get
[58:42] get come on give me give me you give it
[58:44] to me let me fix it
[58:46] i was talking to a guy
[58:49] i said
[58:50] i got a phone call i was telling brother
[58:51] paul
[58:53] [Music]
[58:54] four o'clock
[58:56] monday morning
[58:58] my phone rang
[59:02] and i answered it it was somebody i
[59:04] didn't even know
[59:07] he was a young boy
[59:09] he said sir i hate to call you this time
[59:11] of night
[59:12] he's about the demons
[59:15] the demons
[59:16] are trying to take me
[59:18] he said somebody gave me your card
[59:22] with your number on it
[59:24] he said and i kept it in my wallet
[59:26] he said something told me
[59:28] get it and call you he said i'm hoping
[59:30] i'm not disturbing i said friend when it
[59:32] comes to something like this there's no
[59:34] disturbance
[59:36] and he began to talk about the things he
[59:38] done
[59:38] and all of those things i said listen
[59:40] somebody tell you something young man
[59:44] there's nothing you can do there's no
[59:46] life you can live so low there's nothing
[59:48] you can jump into and just i don't care
[59:50] how horrible it is
[59:52] but god can't turn it around
[59:56] i said god can turn it around the only
[59:59] thing i know god can't fix is blasphemy
[1:00:04] but anything else
[1:00:05] god can fix it
[1:00:08] god specializes in taking the worst
[1:00:11] situations
[1:00:12] and turn them around
[1:00:14] that's how god does things
[1:00:17] can we say amen
[1:00:18] you and i
[1:00:20] god has given us the word of the hour
[1:00:22] and brother burnham said
[1:00:24] the word of god defeats the devil and
[1:00:26] satan can't stand it
[1:00:28] it's the word but that word has to be in
[1:00:30] you and come out of you and know how to
[1:00:32] withstand this devil that we're fighting
[1:00:35] so i told this young boy
[1:00:38] he began to talk about his daddy
[1:00:40] all his problems bitterness
[1:00:43] all of those things
[1:00:45] and i listened to him because i wanted
[1:00:47] him to talk
[1:00:48] and i said let me tell you something
[1:00:49] young man
[1:00:52] [Music]
[1:00:53] i said
[1:00:54] my daddy killed my mother
[1:00:58] when i was seven
[1:01:00] and i said i was in her lap when he did
[1:01:01] it
[1:01:03] i said when i gave my house heart to the
[1:01:05] lord
[1:01:06] we was able to lead him
[1:01:08] to the lord jesus christ
[1:01:10] i said when god come in my heart i
[1:01:12] couldn't hate my daddy because god
[1:01:14] changed me
[1:01:16] and just telling that boy that
[1:01:18] he said thank you now i see that there's
[1:01:20] hope for me for all of the things that
[1:01:22] i've done i wanted him to see all of
[1:01:25] this bitterness and stuff that you're
[1:01:26] doing in your life you just you just the
[1:01:28] devil want to keep you in that shape
[1:01:30] that's what the devil want to do bitter
[1:01:32] hating unforgiveness and then and
[1:01:35] payback revenge the devil want to keep
[1:01:37] people to them states
[1:01:38] but when you experience the love of god
[1:01:41] you can't hate
[1:01:42] you don't want revenge you don't want to
[1:01:44] pay back you let it all go because you
[1:01:47] know he forgave you
[1:01:49] when you experience forgiveness you can
[1:01:52] give forgiveness
[1:01:54] when you can see what jesus does for you
[1:01:57] can we say man because every one of us
[1:01:59] deserve to go to hell
[1:02:01] every one of us deserve to go to hell
[1:02:04] is that right
[1:02:05] there was a story
[1:02:08] this is a slave time
[1:02:10] a boy was found guilty
[1:02:12] and they was going to kill it
[1:02:14] [Music]
[1:02:15] but in that country
[1:02:18] before they can hang the slave
[1:02:20] the bell got a ring
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:24] and the day that he was to get home
[1:02:27] his mother
[1:02:28] went the night before and climbed up in
[1:02:31] the bed
[1:02:34] they put the
[1:02:35] rope around his neck
[1:02:38] and then the man should pull the rope
[1:02:40] pull it
[1:02:42] he tried to ring the bell
[1:02:45] the bell wouldn't ring
[1:02:47] because she was in between it and was
[1:02:48] bumping her
[1:02:50] and then the man said something wrong
[1:02:51] with the bell he said pull it a little
[1:02:52] harder they started yanking on the bell
[1:02:54] harder harder harder the bell went right
[1:02:59] and then that man said according to our
[1:03:01] custom
[1:03:02] we're gonna have to let this boy go free
[1:03:05] and then when they let him go free
[1:03:07] his mama fell out of the bell
[1:03:11] i'm so thankful
[1:03:12] for the blood of jesus christ
[1:03:15] and when the devil went to take my life
[1:03:17] when the devil wanted to kill me but
[1:03:19] because of calvary the bell couldn't
[1:03:21] reign
[1:03:23] i thank god for that
[1:03:25] what we need to do more and more in our
[1:03:27] lives every day fall in love with jesus
[1:03:29] because the more you fall in love with
[1:03:31] him all the things of this world just
[1:03:33] begin to vanish away
[1:03:34] and then you begin to realize my savior
[1:03:37] my redeemer and all the rest of this
[1:03:39] stuff is just a bunch of nonsense that's
[1:03:41] what it is may the lord bless you this
[1:03:43] evening better just sing a free version
[1:03:45] of that song i'm not a singer but that's
[1:03:47] what we need to do is give ourself away
[1:03:51] [Music]
