========================================

this and read together first samuel chapter 15 the last verse there in the chapter and then we'll read the first verse of first samuel chapter 16. so first samuel 15 verse 35 we encourage you to give full attention to the word of god today i believe we have some things that the lord has um blessed us with to bless you with and we just pray you have all listening ears to his spirit and there's as paul says we don't come to you with enticing words of man's wisdom trying to entice you to something or trying to use words to but there's a there's a greater uh way that god likes to work and that is his holy ghost opening up your hearts that you receive and he can break down any barrier he can break down any wall and give you what you need today so we're trusting in that we're praying for that verse 35 of samuel 15 and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of his death nevertheless samuel the prophet mourned for saul and the lord repented that he had made saul king over israel remember as we've been teaching the people chose saul they wanted a king so bad the people chose him god didn't choose him samuel the prophet anointed him he worked he he worked with them and then were coming to a place in scripture where he had disobeyed god that he took the prophet's position he had stepped out of place and the last thing completely disobeyed the the commandment of god so now god withdraws himself from saul and takes his spirit from him he's no longer go he goes on to try to be king but god has withdrawn himself from him but this is an interesting scripture where it says samuel mourned for saul and then chapter 16 verse 1 god responds to that and he says the lord said unto samuel how long will you mourn for saul how long will you mourn for saul seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel fill thine horn with oil and gold i will send thee to jesse the bethlehem bethlehemite for i have provided me a king among his sons my subject this morning is how long will you mourn how long will you mourn heavenly father we ask you to bless your word we thank we're thankful lord to see the the events taking place in the news and lord we're closer than we were five years ago we're closer than we were even a year ago and lord we just pray that this word today will bring us closer to you we pray that rapturing faith would come in the people lord and god threw your word that you would prepare us that you would make us ready that you if we're lacking something in our lives we pray that you'd show it to us this morning and give us those things where we're lacking i pray that you'll bring victory in the people and we're thankful lord for the last days we're thankful that we're living where we're living and we're thankful that we have this place to come and hear the word of god still open to us we consider it a great privilege lord to be here and we pray that you'll come and minister your word to the people as you see fit father and we commit the service in this day to you in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated this morning and a great thank you to the people who built me something here to hang my coat on it might need to be a little higher but i'm not complaining thank you so much i can put my water there and my coat and whoever did that i think mike piste and different ones the wesley i appreciate it brother thank you so much god bless you for that yeah [Applause] amen thank you it was getting pretty serious you know i was throwing my coat out in them so we have been looking at the scripture together uh at saul and david in the bible and one was the choice of the people and one was the choice of god both of those choices god approved and god anointed by the same prophet and so we get from that that under the same message we can have fruits of our own choice still taking place but then the fruits of our own choices over time prove what those choices are and we see the fruit of our own choices and see that usually it doesn't come out good when we choose our own way god lets us do that and so uh in a few services we looked at the fruits of saul the fruits that came out of his life the fruits that came from the people's choice and the same thing happens to us in our spiritual journey we thank the lord for his grace because god allows us sometimes to be able to watch the fruit of our own choices sometimes over years we can observe them and we can admit and be honest after it all that we shouldn't have fought so hard for our own choices uh how many would raise your hand and be honest say i know where that i know what that means i have been there done that i know what it means to make choices that i thought were so right and i fought for those things even twisting the hands of a god a little bit but then i got to see at the end that that was immature choices that wasn't god's will how many would raise your hand and say i've been there done that and so god allows us to see the fruits of it and we looked at all the fruits of saul and what began to come from his life we'll still look at those things after this scripture if the lord leads us we'll still look at because the next stage after this is when saul was still living trying to be king and david david was risen up by god is to be a king and now the tension began between saul and david those tensions speak clearly of sometimes attention in a home a tension in a church tension within the ranks of the message tension in different things and it's because god is raising up a different type of leadership that's christ-like leadership and god is phasing out the wrong type of leadership but while the two are there tension rises can you say amen and you we have observed those tensions so that's where we're going but today we see in our text that not only can you see the fruits of your decisions and we see the fruits of saul's decisions as wrong leaders that we have chosen but we find samuel the prophet mourning over saul and so when i read that i thought that's that needs to be talked about a little bit because this is something in human nature that we not only see sometimes the fruits of our decisions and we're upset at it maybe we're angry at it but but then there's there's something that samuel is doing here that even though samuel knew that saul was wrong even though he he rebuked him even though he said god's left you you're not really the anointed king anymore even though samuel himself seen all that he went through a time of feeling bad for saul and kind of feeling emotional about how many knows that prophets are human beings too and they can get emotional how many knows that john the baptist even doubted a little bit whether he was the messiah and asked his disciples to go ask if he was the one prophets are human beings as well and here we have a prophet going through a mourning time he wouldn't go see-saw but yet he's going through this bit of low time in his feeling bad for for saul being taken or the kingdom being taken from saul and we see samuel mourning over saul and there's so there's some human emotion involved that he felt bad for him that he was rejected from god now may the lord help me to get into this because that scripture would not even be there except there be some emotional thing that takes place in the human being when we come at the end of recognizing wrong decisions that we have made that we actually have a time of a low time that we actually have a time where we mourn over what's been lost we mourn over someone that has hurt us now that's strange because we can be very angry at something that has hurt us we can be angry at our decisions and yet there's a part of us that can go through a morning time and so i thought it was very unique and you know i i just want to take some time on this because it's so related to how we can be in our emotions sometimes god and so after a certain amount of time we're samuel and it doesn't say how long but samuel is mourning over saul he's in this state of mourning he's in is in the state of feeling bad for him he's thinking about him still now he should be saying god what's next he should be saying if he wasn't your choice then could you please show me who the next is i'm looking forward to the next step in the life of israel he should have been saying that he's going to say let's go forward let's move on but he wasn't he was still thinking about saul he was still mourning about saul he was having a pity party he was just all sad about it and he shouldn't have stayed there and i don't know how long he stayed there but finally god had to say to samuel listen it's time to move on it's time to get over saul it's time to get over your past because how many knows that i've preached before here your past has a power to it to keep a cloud over you to keep you from going closer to god your past has a power to it that if you dwell in your past and you mourn over your past even though god has forgiven you or your sins if you stay in depression about it you can't move on with god and the david christ cannot rise in your life until you have dealt with and come through and left your past as paul teaches us forgetting those things which are behind you know what i like about that scripture that it's not complicated but we complicated well what do you mean by that it's like what things do i should i still think about it just says forget yesterday forget those things are what you're behind and press toward the mark of the high calling paul just gives you permission to let it go just let it go and so we find something in here that is uh very very uh teachable to us all and i want you to listen because we want to get a bit deeper with it so god is ready to anoint a leader another leader out of his own choice and after a certain amount of time god did not delay to move on it was time kind of like in revelations 10 when the mighty angel christ comes down sets his foot upon the land and upon the sea and his last words were it says that and time shall be no longer no more delay that's enough and that's enough of man's ideas that's enough it's coming to an end can you say amen because he puts his land upon his feet upon the land and sea and christ begins to take over and say this has been going on for two thousand years where men have messed with the word of god but finally god says that's enough i'm gonna reveal my word to the people and bring him to a rapture somebody say praise the lord there's a time when god says that's enough can you say amen so this is a little bit of rebuke to god's own prophet because he's still mourning over saul who knows how long he was mourning but it was long enough for god to say that's enough and god could not move on to his true will until people's thoughts and attention and mourning were off of the past i'm going to say it again god could not move the people on to his perfect will until they were over the mourning and thinking of the past i think that's teachable to us don't expect god while you're just just still grieving for years over the past or over some situation don't be praying say god take me on take me take me on to psalm i want greater things i want greater revelation if you're going to stay there in a morning over the past it's difficult for god to do that because he's all about as the scripture says i will do a new thing saith the lord i want to do a new thing in your life i want to move you on i would love for you to just just let all that be washed away and you can get a fresh start tomorrow morning that i'm not thinking of the past whatever i've done wrong it's under the blood of jesus christ if satan tries to bring it up it's under the blood satan it's a no fishing zone you can't fish in the sea of god's forgiveness it's a no fishing zone i'm not letting satan bring up any of my past it's done i'm not even going to give one thought to what i've done it's under the blood and the only thing i'm thinking about is what god has for me next and god says you can live that way paul in the bible says you can forget those things which are behind and press toward the mark of the high calling god gives us permission to do that you don't have to think about it ever again and when it comes to your mind you just dump it out of your thoughts you don't have to think about it but it's not like us as human beings to do that we tend to mull over the past and some of us tend to mourn grieve over the past there is a human possibility for people to get stuck in mourning over their bad mistakes or their bad decisions it's in us as a human being to to stay in a stage of being stuck being actually stuck is is this speaking to anybody this morning to get stuck somewhere to get stuck in your past decisions to get stuck in your bad mistakes that you made and get stuck in the past or stuck over a leader who has fallen in your eyes or stuck uh you know i preached something years ago brother isaiah brooks came to my church and preached the sermon i i'll never get away from it i preached the series after it but it was called the images of the mind and i have preached there since then of how powerful images can be in people's minds image to me image can be more powerful than words because images stick in somebody's mind for a long time someone can ask forgiveness from god someone can leave a church because the leadership was bad someone can get out of a bad situation and come to a new church but the image in their mind stays sometimes for a long time the image doesn't die because that's all you're used to that's the leadership you're used to and sometimes people are expecting the new leader to be the same way and when the new leader does a little something that's similar it stirs up all the past and you go you get scared so oh no that's it's going to be the same thing it's because you're you're associating the new leader with what the old leader did i like to tell people hey listen i'm the new guy on the block i'm the new pastor don't associate with me with your past give me a chance i'm the new kid on the block in your life give me a chance i'm not perfect by any means but certainly please please don't put me back with that old pastor of that old leader try to give me a chance please trying to help you i wouldn't be here if i wasn't trying i wouldn't live here unless i was trying to help you and find a balance in the word of god and preach the message the way it should be preached people are hungry to see the message preached the way it should be preached can i get an amen it's a human possibility that oh oh you stay stuck in a leader that has fallen an image is more powerful than words that's another sermon in itself but sometimes it takes years for people even after they leave a leader it takes years a leader that's fallen or a leader that's left the word or a leader that's abused them sometimes it takes years for people to get over that and to get that image out of their minds you gotta have a lot of grace for people because image is more powerful images change over time i believe the holy ghost can change a nature in one moment how many believe that he can change this nature and your desire in one moment but images in your mind don't die at an altar overnight and it's because you get the holy ghost how many know you need the holy ghost you don't need religion you don't need to put the message on the outside talk about all the last day's events you need the holy ghost to make it in a rapture and so when you have that though you get the power to be able to overcome false images of the mind and you got to do it because that will bind you as a christian even as a holy ghost christian it'll bind you and it takes years for people sometimes to to die to old images in their mind they get stuck in mourning they get stuck in a certain place and so moving on we see that the images is such a powerful subject but we're going to move on it's a powerful thing but you see now they can people can be in another church and even under a different ministry but still stuck in the way as before images of the mind don't die overnight the spirit of god had left saul the spirit of god had left saul he is no longer being used and yet there's this lingering morning in samuel's mind morning oversaw and god says it's time to come out in the morning it's time to leave the past i have something better for you it's my choice i want you to stop right here this hall has to stop this morning has to stop it's time for you to move on because i have a better choice for you now and so uh this subject now brings me to something that i've been wanting to talk about for quite a long time and that's and this is this is a perfect place to talk a little bit about it i'd like to talk about mourning i'd like to talk about when a a human or a brother or sister goes into a mourning stage no no matter what mourning over a death mourning over a trauma whatever it is but i got to talk about mourning because morning it's real grief is real uh i hadn't understood some of this until i had someone close like my dad last year to to die in the family never had someone that close to pass away and so this become a bit more real to me in so many years even as a pastor i couldn't understand someone that close going and the grief that they would go through and you can be a bit critical sometimes but grief is real getting down about a loss it's real it's a real feeling and i don't think we should deny that i don't i think we should allow ourselves to go through a mourning process i i think that we should give people time and you know not try to figure things out from let them go through that morning can you say amen and grief is real mourning is real and uh so you know we we we can have so many deaths of family members and i understand it a bit better now and you know i i feel like i maybe dealt with things better than i thought but i just being asking maybe it all hasn't hit me yet but still the grief and the the mourning i experienced that i know i i guess i i feel tr very uh secure and i could go through it easier knowing about three things i know my dad completed his work on earth that's an assurity he completed his work he was supposed to do i know that my dad received his new body and he's over there i know that it's not doubt my mind and i also know that i will meet him again very soon so these are the types of scriptures and assurances that help us to be god gives us why does god gives us give us his word for this because he understands mourning he understands a loss and so god god understands those things and so maybe the full impact hasn't hit me yet and if it if it does then i'll need your strength and your prayers but knowing the hope it stabilizes things the lord but the feelings of mourning and the feelings of grief are real feelings can you say amen that i get to feel what others feel anyone who says that if i have the holy ghost then i don't a person with the holy ghost doesn't have grieving they shouldn't have mourning or grieving that's just crazy jesus himself wept over his friend lazarus so to say well the person you must not have the holy ghost because you're going through this great grieving and mooring over a loss that's just crazy because we're human beings jesus went through it human beings christians go through mourning christians go through grieving and god has a special way to minister to those who are in mourning over a loss can you say amen he says blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted jesus the bible says in isaiah was a man himself the reason he can minister to you if you're mourning the reason he can minister is that in isaiah it says jesus is a man who who's a a man of sorrow he was a man acquainted with grief and that's why god understands it and can minister to you because he was a man of sorrows he was a man of grief he was acquainted with grief aren't you glad you got a high priest tonight that was acquainted with grief that understands what you're going through and he can minister to you just exactly what's needed in those times of your life if you'll lean on him you see people in the world and sometimes even christians will turn to a bunch of things in their mourning and their grief they'll turn to alcohol they never were an alcoholic but they turned to alcohol a lot of people turn to alcohol they turn to this they turn to that they withdraw themselves they they pull themselves away with all the friends the body of christ sometimes the church they just they just but see that's not necessarily the answer god and you may feel that way and it's real but god depend on the lord because god has certain junctions of certain things of he drops in there because he understands your morning and he wants to help you heal and understand some things we'll never understand some things will come under that song that we used to sing with the family we'll talk it over in the bye and bye i'll ask the reason oh i love this this would be his name i'll ask the reason and he'll tell me why when we talk it over in the bible guy how many raised hands no there's some things we will not get answers for on this earth we don't know why we don't understand and if you're not willing to just trust god that way you may not grow as quick out of your mourning because you have to know there are some things that we won't understand but we'll talk it over in the by and by i'll ask the reason to my lord and he will tell me why but guess what in some ways god over time will give you the answers of why there was a quote i was looking for last night and couldn't find it but there was an incident when someone died and they asked the boy to pray for the boy that he wouldn't die he went on and brother bryan's comment was is that this was god's time for him to go because if he'd have stayed alive he would have went into this and when he went into that and god got away from the lord who knows that but god so we in our carnal minds we can't figure it all out but i have found with some people sometimes after a certain amount of time if they'll trust the lord he brings us answers he settles our hearts he brings us out of the grieving but grieving is real god cares about the grieving i care a lot more about the grieving and i just think people should be given time to grieve and if you do searches on google and everything you'll find all kinds of things they've got this narrowed down now there's stages of a grieving there's stages people go through all this stuff comes out of them that never was there before anger and everything else but you know what people need to be allowed to go through all the stages some said there's seven stages some say there's 12. i don't know we're not going to try to figure it all out but let people go through the stages of grieving is that okay with everybody give people pray for people don't say just you know there's nothing worse to say hey man listen quick you need to pull yourself out of this you need to be careful what you say because you must go through all those stages but you must go through them with the lord not in some little room dark closet somewhere by yourself with your video machine not a couch potato veggin on some series tv series you want to watch that's not really going to get you out of your morning i'm talking to you now this is real people turn you see what happens in the human spirit is when we get real low over something that happened our spirits get so low the devil starts to attack us and really started because there's a bit what happens is is there's a bit of giving up that happens in the spirit it's it's like i don't understand this this is too hard for me to handle and so it keeps working on us and keeps working on us and in our spirit and i have been here your spirit kind of just starts giving up now outwardly you're still going to work you're still maybe going to church you're still functioning out like doing going through the motions but in really you're giving up i'm talking to you this morning this is how the devil and when you start that's what the devil wants he's taking your spirit to a giving up then you might be online looking at all the stuff to cause you to doubt the message and talk without the lord doubt god exists because satan's taking your spirit that's low and now he's feeding you with all this stuff because he want to take you over the top given up completely on god it's real friends be careful what you do when you're there and you start giving up in your spirit because you'll start allowing sinful things in your life that you wouldn't normally allow and you're justifying it because you're low in your spirits you see your friends this is just us here and the whole world that's going to watch it when they post it sometimes i don't post it because you know what i'm talking about right now i take a bit of criticism around our ranks um and i know the people mean well but i think that's psychology brother paul he's preaching psychology just preach the message brother paul don't preach psychology but i'm trying to be me and if preaching about how the spirit works in your conscience and your subconscious is psychology then brother branham was wrong he talked about it and he was the best at talking about some reason a man with a seventh grade education could diagnose the spirit like nobody could and how humans work and there's nothing wrong with psychology as far as diagnosing the human being because after 6 000 years of history some of these psychology books can can can diagnose the human being they've got it down pat the problem with psychology is what brother brahm says psychology at the end is not the answer to the problem that's what we preach against psychology mind over matter and i'm going to do this and i'm going to have kind of like when the the doctor told brother branham when you get temper really gets high and you just tie a little string on your finger there and when you use it and he was ready to take that gun and shoot those guys that were being mean to him as a little boy and he looked over that string his teacher gave him and he just took that string and pulled it off psychology didn't work because he said he needed the new birth first he said the new birth started to take care of that temper i'm paraphrasing there he said the new birth he said i needed the new birth because you see that's when you have a power on the inside to overcome these things but psychology is not the answer but people can so i trust that you would trust me this morning i'm not here to preach psychology but i'm diagnosed the real way that people feel sometimes and christians feel that way anybody else has said otherwise they're in denial of what can happen to you is in your human spirit you get so low but god has a way to minister to those who mourn blessed are they that mourn so so i've been talking a lot about mourning over the death of loved ones and i think that's been really real in our church the last few years and so that's why i think the lord led me here but i want to say this not all mourning is over a death many things can bring into your spirit a mourning or a grief and if a human spirit experiences a shock of some kind a trauma of something in life a financial loss you lose everything that was job i'll read a quote about job in a minute you lose everything and by the way you could lose everything where are you going to stand then bear stand on the lord there's no guarantees of your job there's no guarantees of your you see so but someone hits a trauma and they can't handle it financial loss abuse sexual abuse mental abuse in their childhood or even now divorce is a trauma for not only the wife or the husband but the children of a divorce a trusted leader that you trusted so much fell into sin or fell away from the world with the word that's a trauma that's a shock to the human spirit abused people can it's a shock to their system a child hardly ever recovers because it's a shock to the human being for someone who is sexually abused as a little child they hardly get over that because god's not made us to have that happen to us and so a person can go into grief the rest of their life it throws the human spirit into mourning into depression sometimes that people stay in that for constant years it's real can you say amen and then there are symptoms that come from being in the depression or bringing in the grieving there's symptoms that pop up withdrawing from relationships withdrawing from the lord physical sickness they say can come from mourning physical ailments come as a result of someone being in mourning bad decisions people make bad decisions when they're in mourning they turn to alcohol or drug abuse or some other type of abuse or they turn to their video games in in an addiction to video games or they turn to their television or they turn to other things because this is the symptoms something's in depression someone's in depression it's kind of giving up on the inside as i said and even when they're going through the emotions on the outside their inside is giving up and turning to other things so you can google all this and find all the stages specific stages people go through people wonder what's wrong with them and what's going on and you can find out other people say you got to pull all this but listen i think we should give room i'm going to say it again i think we should get prayer and room for what people go through in a morning in a grieving period and not pretend it's not there and i'm a christian and i'm not allowed to feel this way can i get a bigger amen than that i don't think we should pretend i think we should be real but i don't think we should turn away from the lord i don't think we should turn away from the ministering of the body of christ i could be very specific today and i don't want to make this personal with anybody some of you went through grieving and you turned other things you withdraw yourself you're not as faithful to hear the word of god listen i'm encouraging as a minister that's not the answer sometimes the very place and channels god has to bring you out of your mourning you neglect those things and turn to other things amen let's take this a bit deeper deeper though morning is real and he comforts the morning but never forget in god there will never be a perpetual lifelong eternal curse to stay in mourning the rest of your life if you're around god he will never allow for it to continue the rest of your life and stay stuck in your mourning and that's proved by the text that i said today that god says all right you've mourned saul long enough samuel it's time to fill your horn with oil praise the lord oh i can get preaching now you know what it's time to do it's time to move on and it's time to get some oil some holy spirit and to fill your horn with oil and god's getting ready to anoint something else in your life it's time to get past your past it's time to get past your depression i had stories recently of of family members and children that have died i look at people i say i don't understand how they made it through except for god's grace they shouldn't even be sitting here today losing teenagers and losing moms losing boys and girls that young ages how do you process that but somehow they're sitting here by the grace of god because god cares for the morning and also god does not want you to stay stuck in mourning it says to samuel samuel says he says to samuel it's it's it's it's it's time to be done now with the morning it's time to fill your horn with oil can you say amen god is never into a perpetual lifelong curse eternal curse that's almost eternal curse that's almost uh oxymoron there it's you know i don't think in terms of something bad as being eternal not even there's not even eternal hell as many christian churches preach there's an eternal head there's no such thing as an eternal hell isn't that wonderful i think brother wrap preached out that one time in that wonderful to know that it's even god's grace that something like that god says no they're going to there's going to be an end to that as well and sometimes when you go through mourning i'm just taking my time today because that's all right with everybody this is a subject i've been wanting to speak to a long time and god finally gave me permission to do it i'm just gonna you know i i may take a little time here because i can kind of like a prison ministry a captive audience sometimes when god throws out a lifeline people have become so accustomed to their life of grief that they actually turn down god's lifeline and they stay there let me see this before god's throwing out lifelines and they choose to stay there this becomes a concern of a true genuine pastor or any other minister or sometimes parents becomes a concern because some things god clearly gives a way out god clearly gives some scriptural ministering to to bring someone out of that the answer is so clear but they didn't get it they didn't grab it they didn't take a hold of it and they walk out the building the same way that they were you can talk to a person after 20 years and they're stuck right there where they were 20 years ago everything comes out of them it's exactly the same thing that they said to you 20 years ago they're stuck never move beyond it it's incredible and it's concerning it's still stuck same anger same bitterness same thing russell friedman uh from the grief recovery institute and this is where you'll really label me a psychologist as well so i'm going to read a little bit what he says here because it it brought out something that's real with human beings and what i'm talking about as far as getting stuck there some of us have become very good at holding on to our pain we may have unresolved loss of trust experiences from our childhood that keep us in an almost perpetual state of acceptance of pain as a permanent condition now friends i want you to listen because this is where god wants to step in when the devil is going to take it to this perpetual type of state of acceptance of pain of eternal acceptance of lifelong acceptance of the grieving this is where god says i want to minister you out of that but this obviously from this man it happens many of us keep dragging the unfinished relationship of our past into all of our new relationships and by that he he not only means unfinished relationship of the past but sometimes when someone dies we have unfinished relationship it hurts us so bad because things got things didn't get said it's an unfinished relationship and it's awful hard it's completely completely impossible to finish what you wanted to finish with that person when god takes them so that's it in your eyes that's an unfinished relationship and one thing that it should encourage people do which it doesn't a lot but if you have those things and you viewed as an unfinished relationship i didn't get to say this this the person he went too quick she went too quick i it's an unfinished thing and and you think well i'm just going to live without the rest i want no one thing you can do trust the lord well one thing you can do is that to pour yourself in you might learn from it pour yourself into your relationships you have now pour yourself into your wife pour yourself into your husband and say all the things that sometimes get unsaid it's one way that you can that you can say i learned from this it's in god's hands what was unsaid but i'm going to show you you can finish those things too god can help you finish those things but if it's unfinished pour yourself into relationships now i mean just pour yourself into your wife pour yourself in your hands and your mate's going to be going praise the lord this is nice they're sharing their hearts with me they're giving me themselves they're given their heart this isn't some wall or some person that i'm just living with because i married him 30 years ago and the husband's saying he's why i said you never tell me you love me anymore i hear from my wife sometimes you just hardly ever tell me about it and one guy says i told you i loved you 30 years ago when we got married if anything changes i'll let you know i know not to ever say that it's your wife mike's going wow this is she's they learn something through unfinished relationships that now i can pour myself into my kids now i can pour myself into my mates now i'm going to call this family member and i'm going to do my part they may be shut down they might be at the wall just like they were uncle tom i shouldn't say tom uncle jesse that's a man jesse she's jessica you call uncle jesse and you say hey how you doing i just want to you know i just want to say that i love you and can we get together and have coffee and you do that and jesse may say listen i don't want to talk to you he may shut you down but at least you're making an effort now because why you've learned i don't like the pain of unfinished relationships what about your relationship with the lord wouldn't this be an opportunity to get closer to the lord instead of farther away wouldn't this be an opportunity to feed on the message and the word more than you ever have instead of get away from it so you can do that but he goes on to say here many of us keep dragging the unfinished relationships of our past into all of our new relationships and then acting surprised when they always in the same we may be ill-equipped to deal with the feelings we may eat we may be ill ill-equipped to deal with the feelings caused by the end of each new relationship and we may be unaware that almost all of our past relationships are incomplete or unresolved grievers develop a relationship to their pain grievers develop a relation now wait a minute i'm going what a person in grief can develop can can have unfinished relationships can pull themselves away from all other relationships in life but develop a relationship with their pain i want sister tina to sing a song today i sent him a few weeks ago and it's called the breakup the big breakup you know what she's breaking up from you know you know what the song says you're breaking up from having a relationship with fear the big breakup people develop relate they won't be around anybody else but they'll develop a relationship a relationship with fear grievous develop a relation to their pain as if their identity hinged on regarding themselves as unhappy many people become so familiar with those painful feelings that they are afraid to let them go if it were not so sad and if it did not have such dire consequences one would be tempted to draw a cartoon of someone clinging desperately to a horrible looking creature called pain terrified of losing it and yet that is exactly what it looks like some of us are able to acknowledge that we have sabotaged many relationships while we have the intellectual awareness that we are we are the common denominator in the sabotages we find ourselves unable to change our behavior if the intellect were the key to successful recovery then we would be able to think ourselves well or think ourselves out of it we would be able to understand ourselves into better actions clearly that does not work incomplete relationships create unresolved grief and unresolved grief creates incomplete relationships incomplete relationships can cause us to limit our lives can induce us to sabotage good relationships and can encourage us to keep choosing poorly unresolved grief can cause us to define ourselves as unworthy of happiness now we know that is a lie of your enemy a lie of the devil that we are unworthy of happiness again that is a lie i'll never be normal again that's a lie i can never come in i don't deserve to come into happiness again because of the unresolved things that i didn't settle and take care of with a lost loved one or a loss of this or decisions i made wrong but that's alive they mean no matter how true it looks to you it's a lie to say can you say man that you're unworthy of happiness the word says otherwise the word says because of calvary you're worthy of deliverance you're worthy of his grace you're worthy of his love you're worthy of happiness the word says you're worthy to be happy the word says you're worthy to have a good marriage you got to latch on to it said the word says it because the spirits will come on a low spirit and you're down your family's having trouble and the devil will say you're not even worthy of it so that's where you quit trying because you've been told by a lie i'm unworthy of happiness why then do so many people resist taking the simple and clearly defined actions of the grief actions that they should take we must learn how to grieve and complete relationships that have ended or changed so so then it is the ah we refer to how familiar we become with our pain i got to move on here familiarity can create a powerful illusion that change is not necessary just talking about the human being the psychology of how he works not how god necessarily works that's a powerful statement familiarity with pain and with your grieving can create a powerful illusion that change can't come or change is not necessary anymore because i'm familiar now and i have a relationship with the pain that growth is not possible and that where happiness concern 20 percent equals 100 percent what happiness is concerned am i equipped for happiness yes but i am much more familiar with pain as the direct result of years and years of practice i am expert at identifying relating to emotional pain happiness is an unwelcome intruder in how i relate to myself see god tries to bring deliverance or god tries to bring something and you're so used to the pain happiness is an unwelcome intruder in how i relate to myself we have all searched desperately for the key to happiness while it may sound simplistic to say that we held the key ourselves all along it is true access to our own happiness is directly linked to our ability to grieve and complete our relationships with people and events as well as our ability to grieve and complete our relationship to the pain we generate when we are reminded of the unhappiness we have experienced in our lives and many of us say over and over that if only this or that would happen i could be happy the thing might be love or money or success or fame if i could only have this then i'd be happy and yet how often do we get the very thing we wanted and wind up as unhappy as we were before and even more disillusioned to rediscover your ability this is where i disagree with the man to rediscover your ability to be happy you must go back and grieve and complete all your incomplete relationships from your past i disagree with them there i do agree with this part of it is that god can allow you to go back and to be able to find closure through the word of god and what he ministers to you to find closure for incomplete relationships you give god time he'll help you with that but god does not allow you to go back through your morning and stay in mourning the rest of your life is that okay with everybody and i hope that doesn't sound too much psychology i'm going to get some criticism for it but i'm used to that but listen i like to talk about how the human being works and how the devil brings his lies to a human being that's low i'm exposing him this way i'm not preaching psychology i'm exposing our devil i'm exposing the devil in your life that you can get over your past and over your mourning and over the trauma of what's happened in your life can you say amen the grace of god is with you this morning and here among us to help you get over your trauma to help you over mourning to pull you out of your depression can you say man that you can be a happy holy ghost filled christian walking with the lord it's yours this morning you're worthy of it can you say amen because of christ praise be to god i just feel like i ca i still can't wake some of you up but i'm praying all of us wake up and say thank you lord for the grace of god in my life thank you lord that you minister help during the times of trouble thank you lord that your word says that that i sought the lord and he delivered me from all of my fears all of my doubt all of my mistrust he'll dissolve all your doubts daniel says he's the god that does it he says you go back as you do so you will begin to find your normal natural desire i disagree with his answer about going back and i usually do with a psychologist conclusions to things never in god do we have this you must allow the lord to minister each thing that seems incomplete he can give you answers closure and some things he will answer clearly on the other side but nothing is impossible with god the same god that cleared up all of joseph's joseph's life and his hatred from his own brothers he cleared it up at the end and told joseph till he could tell his brothers instead of being angry at them god cleared it all up why did this happen why did they sell me into egypt why my own brothers did it to me i don't understand this finally over time god gives joseph a revelation and he could see clearly why he did it god will do the same thing for you now i know why and his brothers were thinking he was going to kill him he said no i love you god did this for a purpose to bring me into this position so that i could bless the entire nation the tender hand of jehovah my mom says that song's been on her mind lately the tender hand of jehovah guiding us and he gives us the answers why hallelujah hallelujah let's give god praise hallelujah to be scriptural about this it'll pull up the scripture genesis 37 35 we're like jacob sometimes when we come to our grief before joseph come into his positions and he found out his son was his son was dead or he thought was dead that's what jacob said when he was grieving about joseph dying genesis 37 35 and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted jacob i refuse he got this bloody garment that his son joseph his favorite son was dead but here's here's our reaction sometimes they tried to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said for i will go down into the grave unto my son morning thus his father wept for him that's the way we get i'm taking this pain to the grave don't try to comfort me the lord or other people i'm taking this to the grave i'm holding on to this pain and i'm grieving so much that i'm taking it that's pretty stubborn his son wasn't even dead he's going to get a blessing to realize later he wasn't really dead god was going to give a a big reunion someday to his son guess what you all god's got a reunion for you and your loved ones has passed away god has a reunion god has a celebration for you to be reunited with him well praise the lord there's another place here in mark 16 9 the disciples you know when jesus was risen early the first of the week mark 16 9 now when jesus was risen early for the first of the week he appeared first to mary and magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept they're mourning over jesus and it wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not that's somebody in grieving that says i'm kind of just sticking with the grieving i don't believe if you want to come out of your you're grieving in the morning you're going to have to start you're gonna believing to trust god is this okay with everybody it's the way we can be i'm gonna stay this way i'm gonna make excuses this way people can make excuses for not coming to church can find excuses to justify people can try to coddle me people can try to comfort me god never intended for us to have a life relationship with fear or pain or grief or mourn the rest of our lives how long how long will you mourn over saul you've had some souls in your life many of you but my question is how long will you mourn over saul is that okay it's time to fill your horn with oil and bring david in your life comes a point god says let's move on brother abraham says about job i think of job and the quote i think of job when he was old stricken in age you guys have that one i think of job when he was old stricken in age and his flesh was simply falling from his body from sores his heart was broken in grief remember now he left his children he lost all of his money he lost all of his farms he lost everything and he you talk about a man who's in grief his heart was broken in grief and every mortal part of his being was withering away and a great man like that who made a great impression to the world in his day and to see that and all that it was you know some ways the devil you're just finished you used to be a great man you used to be happy you used to have all this you speak faithful and church and all those now you know it's over for you bud so job's thinking it's all over he said he would go through the cities of the east and the princes would bow before him on account of his wisdom but here he was at his wit's end anybody ever been at your wit's end me and brother michael okay i must be preaching too long here his body was gone his property was gone his children was gone and that he and that he had was gone and then god in his mercy come down to job and he give him another sense that he could open his eyes and see the day when there would be a body he would receive he knew that there was coming one a just one who would stand in his place who would raise up the body of the dead and would you notice that god come down and visited job after a long time he said i know that my redeemer liveth i like these positive words that he spoke in it not i hope so i have a feeling there will be that's about the attitude of many today i have a hope that someday but job had more than that he said i know i know remember i said earlier about my dad i know he fulfilled his commission i know he has his new body this morning and i know i'm going to meet him very soon not i hope so i know so that's what god gave job is not some hope soul but some no-so hallelujah i know my redeemer liveth the positive side of it no more in the negative it's all positive [Applause] god don't leave you in your mourning friends at lazarus i said he wept at lazarus but then he ended the weeping he ended the morning and that's our god he wants to end the morning there has to be an end to the weeping ecclesiastics 3 1 says to everything there's a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born and a time to die you guys have that scripture ecclesiastes 31 to everything there's a season time to every purpose under heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plant a time to pluck up that which plant planted a time to kill a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance now you see the wisdom in revelation in this scripture our life will go through seasons but did anybody notice the seasons never stay perpetual they change and there is a time to mourn but there will come a time to dance hallelujah don't you ever accept that i'll got a relationship with this fear and relationship with this morning and i'll be here forever don't ever accept that here's three or four more excursion scriptures to you and then we'll close psalms 30 and verse 11. psalms 30 and verse 11 thou has turned for me my morning into dancing thou has put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness god can turn your mourning into dancing psalms 30 and verse 5 for his anger and dearth but for a moment in his favor is life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning everything i preached to you today is right here in the bible right here in the scripture and all i've said is mourning is not an eternal perpetual thing that you'll end your life with and go to the grave with god says no if you'll lean on me i'll bring you out of your mourning and bring you back to dancing again weeping may last for the night but joy comes in the morning i'm glad to serve a god like that can you say amen isaiah 60 and verse 20 isaiah 60 and verse 20 the sun shall no more go down neither shall thy moon withdraw itself for the lord shall be thy everlasting light and the days of thy morning shall be ended isaiah 51 11. therefore the redeemed of the lord shall return and come with singing unto zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their head they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee away i love this scripture here i'm going to end in that one keep it up the redeemed of the lord shall return we're already in that scripture isaiah's prophecy because as soon as the message came we're in a restoration returning back to the faith of the fathers we're returning back to zion again we're on our journey back to zion we're marching to zion and it says they'll be returning they'll be returning not not with depression and mourning and fear and just barely making it into the rapture just oh lord pull me up would you that's not what that scripture says our return our returning is happy is rejoicing we've come out of our morning we've come out of these things our return design is not just this gloomy doubtful barely making it into the rapture can you say man with all kinds of trouble bringing us down and living in depression that's not how we return but we return with number one singing singing singing if you're in depression start singing even if you're a monotone and can't sing just start singing nobody's gonna hear you but yourself and god they shall return with singing and musicians that was your cue to get up and come so you can get this preacher out of this sermon they shall return with what and it's not the song woe is me oh is me who is me [Music] that's all the words just woe is me love me i don't think it's that song i think it's another special i think it's it's special because it's they come with singing but the singing and everlasting joy shall be upon their head they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee away if you don't like me for the rest of the sermon and you didn't get anything else out of it all you need to do is to say lord that's my promise then that's your word and that's not speaking of that's speaking of the bride in her return to zion we're almost there we're on our journey to zion and on our journey we're not to be depressed just down we go through those stages but we don't stay there we're headed into this rapture with joy rejoicing gladness because we're worthy of happiness he has made us happy brother man says we got a right to be happy because of calvary we got to write to his promises they shall return with gladness and they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee away if you don't get anything else say isaiah 51 11 is mine today and i'm going to take it home with me i'm going to i'm going to grab a hold of this and say i'm that bride that's on our way back to zion and i'm going to say this is the way we're headed back we're marching to zion beautiful beautiful we're marching upward to zion that beautiful we're changing we're marching [Music] that beautiful [Music] [Music] beautiful [Music] oh [Music] [Music] used [Music] city of god [Music] [Music] is [Music] beautiful [Music] before we reach the heavens before we reach well we're marching [Music] close your eyes just for a minute how long will you mourn over saul take your horn say lord fill my horn with oil let me raise your hand say lord fill my horn with oil your holy spirit i didn't i didn't come to you today to preach to you to give you a better feeling that you feel good i come to tell you that you can let go of your holding on you can let go and let god have his way i'm not trying to entice you with man's word of wisdom to to try to make you feel temporarily happy i'm trying to say the word has told you there's there's an end to being down and staying down god has an end to it he has joys for you just take what i said and examine it think about it pray about it because it was intended today for you to think and realize if you're there if you've been robbed if the devil's robbed you of everything and some things even that were so consistent in your life before and now it's unraveled because of the kind of condiment a perpetual state of just i'm just going to stay here my message to you you don't have to stay there there's a body that loves you there's a god that loves you there's ministering spirits in the body that are working so well to rush to something if you just expose yourself to it god can meet the need within the body of christ don't distance yourself and don't withdraw yourself from the channels that god wants to minister draw you into that place of joy and confidence and happiness you do deserve it it won't always be that way as you may be bought into it will always be that way god has a victory for you this morning my precious lord we're closing the service now i pray that the words that i believe that you gave me i believe lord that if the people will grab ahold of your word not so much me but this word i believe lord there will be so much more overcoming and victory in their lives lord i still sense even today some just just troubled by something lord and i i would never rush them or push them to do anything lord you understand whether or not you know what they're troubled about lord i pray you'll minister to them this morning that even around this great light that's shedding in this word that's preached may they never forget that this word is for them too this word is for them this word of deliverance is for them they would just take it and latch on to it for themselves we don't want to come to church the same as when we we want to leave the same way that we came lord change us deliver us let our eyes be open lord to the state we're in help us not to hold on to some religious thing i'm okay because i'm in the message god just help us to shed all that help us to be real whatever state that we would be in you come and find us and love us out of it lord help us lord to be real because we serve a real god we're real people but we serve a real god thank you father minister dear people may there be big fruit great fruit that comes from the word spoken today because they are your words thank you jesus for your grace and i just say if there is a person that's still struggling over the losses they've had in their lives come alongside and be a friend to them love them comfort them be a guide to them lord be more real than you've ever been before so that they know they're going to come through it because you're with them you're a man of sorrows acquainted with you're with them and you bring them out of it lord by your grace minister to them lord we commit all that's been said now into your hands in jesus precious name amen
