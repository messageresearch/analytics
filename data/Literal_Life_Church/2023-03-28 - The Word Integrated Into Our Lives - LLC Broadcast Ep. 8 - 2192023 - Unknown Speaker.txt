hi everybody Pastor Paul LaFontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literallife.church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today thank you [Music] Jesus [Music] it is [Music] around the same he's dead [Music] we should never be [Music] friends with me [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] we should never be this way [Music] take it to the Lord [Music] take it to the Lord In Praise amen now these are the Commandments the statues the judgments which the Lord your God commanded to teach you that ye might do them in the land whether you go to possess it so the statues and judgments are what he's referring to is what came down from the mountain from Moses God's Prophet at Mount Horeb or another reference is Mount Sinai it's both it's the same thing but this is a significant point in history for God coming to his people and speaking through his prophet and what came from God is the word of God in statues and judgments and how to live and here it says when you go in to possess the land you're going to need these principles you're going to need these statues because when they went into the land when they'd crossed into the Wilderness but they'd give them that's when the battle really begun I've often said your battle doesn't begin until you get the Holy Ghost that's when the battle really begins and you enter the land and You Begin battling for your possession well his statues instructions were for to prepare them because he says you're going to need these things that my Prophet is saying you're going to need them when you get into the land and more every day you're going to need them even more so he says keep those statues and then he as he watches as he goes along in the scripture that thou mightest fear the lord thy God to keep all his statues and his Commandments which I command thee thou and thy son and thy son's son son that means your grandson all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged here therefore Israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that ye may increase mightily there's always a promise of God a blessing that goes from following the word it's always there as the Lord God of our fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honey hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might another place Jesus references that he said with all thy mind as well so it pretty much covers the whole human being if you're going to love God then be all in and love him with everything don't just give him your heart give him your mind don't just give them your uh don't just give one part of yourself but give your heart give your soul and give your might get it give everything that's the only way to really truly love God is to give them your all a lot of people today is probably not a person in the world you wouldn't ask in the world say do you love God everybody would say yes but it has actions to it and when you do it you don't love him and pick which parts you want of God you're all in and part of loving God of course is that what he said before you're embracing his statues and his Commandments and these things that's part of loving God but look how he says this now Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart with all thy soul with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart so so these words that I'm saying and that I brought through my prophet and spoke them these principles these Commandments this word that I've given you to live by was never meant to stay just in the head it must be in your heart so this ties back to Psalms chapter 1 verse 2 where the man of God is his Delight this will tie back to what I was talking to a couple weeks ago about these things his Delight is in the word he does meditate day and night that the thought life saturated with the word and positive things brings Victory and stability no matter what happens I want to title this tonight the word integrated into our lives the word because it's not that we just have the word in these Scriptures it says the word must be integrated into your life and when I preached on the thought life that's what that man did he in his law he doth meditate day and night he directs his thoughts to come always back to the word of God there's a lot of things we can think about but he directs his thought and he disciplines his thought bringing him back to the word thinking of a scripture thinking of a precept thinking of something Moses said back then it was Moses thinking of it and they'd always discipline their mind because that's what that man of God did that was blessed he meditated on day and night he was his Delight but it wasn't just that I loved the word and Alive the Lord I loved the word but he meditated on he disciplined his mind said I'm gonna I have a choice of my thoughts I have a choice what I'm going to think about every day and so if I have the choice and I don't have a choice in a lot of things but if I have a choice I'm going to choose what I'm going to think about how many knows the New Testament scripture that says think on these things instructions whatsoever is good report whatsoever is lovely whatsoever is pure not dirty what sort of a good report not bad report not gossip and I'm giving my mind and the rest gets trashed and I'm giving mine to good things I choose to think on these things and we know the power of that and so now that thought life being saturated with the word and positive things brings Victory and stability no matter what happens in our life it counters everything a thought life that is given to God counters everything that's going on the fears of coming judgment your internal fears your personal fears your fears of the future your fears that you might get the same genetic disease that your whole family uh four generations back as God your fears of the coming judgments your fears of what's happening in the world it is the counter the thought life being being uh Pleasant under the pleasant thoughts of God your thought life counters all things and it brings victory in your life it brings stability in your life it counters the fears it counters the spirit of laodicea which is a lukewarm Spirit a thought life under control of God filled with the spirit counters the spirit of laodicea and makes you on fire for God instead of lukewarm for God that's why how powerful this thought life is um it brings the Hallelujah in the valley your thought life under control brings the Hallelujah in the valley we must stay close to the Lord that's what these scriptures say and our world must stay close to his world God's world our world must stay integrated with the things of God if not integrated saturated when the the Bible talks about take this truth put it on the doorpost of your house teach it in the morning and night to your children put it in put it in the front let's of your eyes that means saturate your life with the word of God now there's a reason why he's saying that and I'm going to give those reasons tonight tonight maybe next Wednesday and I'm going to give the reason because God always has a good reason why he's saying it but the main theme tonight is that it's not just that you have the word is it integrated into your life and into your thought life because when you get it then you get Victory so R we must stay close and our world must stay integrated with the things of God if not saturated with the things of God and the principles of God if not the spirit of the age can dominate us even Believers can get us in a state of lukewarmness even the church we know the laodicean church it's the church he's talking about in Revelations 3. it's not unbelievers can you say Amen it's the church that's in a state of lukewarmness so that means that Believers if they're not countering saying God I want to stay on fire for you I want to stay close to you if you don't fight against that you'll automatically become a laodicean I don't mean to call the bride laosians tonight but I have to be honest that if we don't yield to God we come under lukewarmness and God hates that he wants to spill it out of his mouth he would rather have you cold he'd rather make a decision so many people right now are in the valley of decision they're good they're making decisions what to do right now whether to follow the counsel of God or follow their feelings and so many is in the valley of decision and so when you're in the in the in between spot it's a terrible place to be and when you become lukewarm in your walk with the Lord God says I would really rather have you cold or hot but I I the the lukewarmness is what makes me spill it out of my mouth I can't stand that lukewarm water coming from the church my dad used to say there's nothing worse when you're a kid and you're thirsting after playing an hour of basketball and you run up to a drinking fountain and it's lukewarm water nothing worse than a good hot water for tea praise the Lord nice ice water praise the Lord but when you're hot and you need something lukewarm you just what do you do [Music] that's my demonstration tonight that's my visual it's what God says he does with our lives that become lukewarm so I would rather have you cold I'd rather have you just admit I'm cold I'm I'm backslid I'm you know I'm making a decision I don't want this I want the world he would rather someone be honest than than to be in between God wants to see passion God wants to see the fires of the Holy Spirit God wants to see us trying we're not perfect but we're trying can you say Amen your love of God comes natural my love of God comes natural if God puts his love within you you don't have to work at that but staying on fire for God you got to work at it you got to fight for it can you say Amen you got to bring your heart and your passion underneath God down fire you got to stay close to the fire if you want to get on fire you stay close to the fire and you're not distancing yourself from where the fires of God are which is in the word of God around the saints of God can you say Amen so you know it's it's several good quotes today that we're talking about uh people being critical of the the rude people at church and somebody posted these are the same people that talk about all the rude people at church that uh never stay after to find out who the people really are to know if they're rude or not and then there's the type of people that's the the the drag racers brother magulis says I love it he says there's some Christians that are drag racers they drag themselves to church and then they race away I love it I love it problem is I see it I tell you we ought to come early and stay late can you say man we ought to come and get what we need to get praise the Lord I want to don't want to be a drag racer for sure naturally and spiritually so in this lukewarm age this is a powerful weapon against it those who want to stay on fire they stay close to the fires of God and and so if how many want to live above laodicea how many wanna how many wants to be on fire not a lukewarm Christian amen so I think if you listen tonight there'll be some things I guarantee you that would be a help to you if you listen close you'll hear some good things other people just filter it out uh to what you want to hear like you normally do so now in this setting of Deuteronomy just in case you don't know we're they're getting ready to enter the promised land and there's an emphasis from the Lord that we can take today as well because we've received a word from the mountain through a prophet again we'll get into that in a minute that was a pivotal point when God brought the word to the mountain for the people and God did it in the Old Testament God does it in the New Testament through a prophet and there's an emphasis after they receive the word from the Lord that we can take today as well and the emphasis is don't forget the statues and the Commandments and the judgments that I brought to you from the prophet and from the mountain Mount Sinai or Horeb was pointed to so frequently in the Old Testament so uh so many times it was pointed back to pointing back to you the statues even when they got in the promised land Joshua was to remind him and to preach to them the statues and the things that come from Moses as they come into their promised land so they were to be to to keep their minds filled with those things Mount Sinai was a turning point it was where a prophet was used to deliver the word of God to the people it was a huge pivotal point in history the word of God of how to live was dispensed through a prophet that's what happened God coming on the mountain with his glory and his Prophet would be given the word of and that word would be how the people should live for generations to come God said I'll teach you how to live without that they'd be lost they would become idolaters they would become they would be given but he gave them an absolute he gave them this is what this is from my heart this is how you should live as Believers in Jehovah and it was you talk about specifics read the read your Old Testament you talk about specifics in that wall I mean it was specifics right onto dietary laws and everything and and if you read those they're to give protection to the people for diseases and all these other things and God had it all in his mind to start with and if you were living in that day you'd almost have to say how does God know about all this if he's never really been here lived out life and he's bringing us such specifics how to live about adultery about young people about all these other things and he's just bringing specifically if this happens deal with it this way if this happens if a girl get in gets engaged and her father didn't know about it this happens to deal with it this way how does God well God created us and God knew then from the beginning so he says for my people I'm going to give my absolute I'm going to give my word to them so they won't be floundering around if they'll stay with my word they'll have power to be able to live this pivotal point of God on the mountain it was a turning point it was where Prophet was used to deliver the word of God to the people the word of how to live was dispensed through a prophet it had the glory of God in it and and and so it had so much glory in it that Moses had to Veil his face so I want you to say something and I'm taking this very slow I may not get to everything tonight but I just want everybody to understand I would love our children to be able to understand that when God brought the word on the tablets to Moses it wasn't just this um uh lifeless uh mechanical spiritless thing that took place the glory of God was all over that mountain and that's something the glory of God was all over that place to where Moses had so much the power and the glory of in his face that when he come down on the mountain the people had that they said put a veil over your face they couldn't even see it it was so powerful It's So Glorious so the the word isn't just the word the word isn't just tablets the word isn't just letter it has God's glory in it so it wasn't just this mechanical spiritless dry event the supernatural God was there in that mountain causing the mountain to Shake in other words it was not just the word but his presence coming to the people bringing the word to them with his presence all the glories of God all the blessings of God all the presence of God lies in his word so that's why we come through the channel of his word that's why we saturated into our lives that's why we get it in our you know start with the brain I mean the the mind is the wound to the soul start there meditate on it get it into your children's Minds let them memorize it because the potential of the glory of God is in his word when that triggers and it becomes a revelation to them uh it's over for the devil can you say man if a young if a young person catches by the holy ghost or revelation of who they are and catches these Revelations of the word the devil's day is numbered with that person amen he'll still fight him but that revelated believer the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against the Revelation the devil is finished when somebody gets a true Revelation from God and you can't get a revelation unless you're around the word of God hearing it amen you can't get it unless you're hearing because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so this event in Mount Sinai was so huge it was a pivotal point in history at least in the history of God's interaction with people but in Deuteronomy we we see here These Warnings of further instruction that now take these precepts that came from the mountain and from the prophet take these precepts take whatever came from God here and begin integrating them into your daily lives and I I emphasize daily lives and homes because that's what he that's what he talked about he he was referring when he's talking about put sitting with your children in thine house so the very prophet's message would now not stay at the temple or not stay on tablets he's saying bring what was said into your home let your children hear it let your grandchildren hear it put it on the posters put it on the refrigerator put it in your room put it on your phone put it everywhere you look put it in the front of your car put it everywhere that most places you can look you can have the word of God in front of you you can't do that at your job always but you have control of what you have in your home you have control of what you have in your own you have control of what you put in your mind and he's saying let this be saturated Let It Be integrated into your life this has power within it it must be integrated into our daily lives it must be red it must be talked about it must be spoken to the children and more so in this day as they hear the other voices of other standards and other absolutes thank God for the homes that I'm looking around here tonight that raise your children some of them may be astray but thank God that you held that word in front of them because that's what you were supposed to do the Lord young people God no matter how Wicked This World gets no matter how Wicked people get compromises borderline Believers don't always remember God himself brought his words of the people to live by and if you live by it you'll be blessed and you'll overcome it's just that simple I believe with all my heart so we must take what was dispensed from God and bring it into our lives and make it the Forefront of our conversations and our meditation we should surround ourselves with it I said we should surround ourselves and integrate and bathe ourselves in it constantly as much as we can we should surround ourselves with it why one reason he gives here in the scriptures is that when he says when you come into blessings the tendency to come into blessings is people forget God's principles you can use an example of something someone becoming successful and starting to make a lot of money money can ruin people riches can ruin people becomes the answer to all things of the Love of Money the love of money is the root of all evil but riches themselves when they increase for somebody it's a test of their character and so but you see if you had all that dumped on you it'll become a test it'll test everything that you are you know people sometimes they get a promotion and praise God for it but remember it'll be a test that you glorify God with it you go on with God but for a lot of people it was a test and you've seen what really came out of them they begin to Ditch things and ditch this and lay this aside and lay the word aside because the security of I can got my money to bail me out now I got my money so I don't need to depend on God as much it's such a deception such a deception so I want to stay like Paul and I trust that I can that he said and I've I've learned to be without and I've heard learned to have a lot and I've been in both places but I've learned whatever state I'm in to be content I'm not going to change my praise not going to change my worship not going to quit coming to church can you say Amen money's not going to change me I already have an absolute in my life I'm already a rich man I'm a millionaire spiritually I hit the lottery spiritually when I got saved I become a billionaire spiritually so any added blessings to pay the bills praise the Lord but if I never got it if I stayed a pulpr my whole life I'm a millionaire already the other reason that God warns he says when you get in there if you don't stay close to the world you'll be drawn to other idols because you're going to have the test of other idols so God knows how we are built as a human being and he's given These Warnings because we are built in a way that has the potential for a diversified heart God knows man has the potential to have a diversified Worship in other words he can worship many gods or he can worship one God that's not the true God but usually it's a diversified heart I'll give a piece of my heart to this God a piece of my heart to worship this I worship that I worship that a diversified heart and here in the scripture I read you tonight God says but I am one Lord and you're going to serve me you serve you only worship one God the human being with all of his emotions can be idolatrous and distracted to other gods than the one true God the only way to keep from that happening is to become consumed with one God to consume with God and the Christ who's the revealing of God can you say Amen God is looking at where our emotions and our passions are directed to I may look at you and not know where your passions are directed to I may not know that but God knows where your passions are directed remember worship isn't just when you're here in church raising your hands worship is the whole laying before something it's giving your heart and passion to something that's worship of the human being and the only way to keep that from happening is to become consumed with God that's another reason why he says stay saturated integrated with the word of God God is looking at where our emotions and passions are directed to this scripture shows that it's not just our soul he wants us to give but everything that we are that's why he says when you love me love me with all your it doesn't just say just love me with your soul and the rest of you just wing it no it's as integrated in all of our lives when you love me it's got to be with your mind soul body strength heart everything and why does God say that because he's a jealous God and all of our worship and passion and Direction goes only to one thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literallife.church and if you would
