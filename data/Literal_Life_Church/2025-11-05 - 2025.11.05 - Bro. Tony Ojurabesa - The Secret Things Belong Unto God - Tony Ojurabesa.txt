There in the spirit beholding his face. Yes Lord. Oh gang you power to run in this race. I long to be shy with God as the Lord. Shing with God in a secret place. Oh, there in the spirit beholding his face. Yes, Lord. For gaining new power to run in the race. Oh, I want to shout. &gt;&gt; And so tonight, you know, brother Tony is one of our family. I've been preparing for the services and brother Tonyy's part of the family here, brother Michael's uh dad. And uh so we count he comes and stays a long time with us and he's going to be here through Thanksgiving. So this worked out so I could prepare for those services for him to speak a little bit to us tonight. We appreciate him always being around. Appreciate his amens when he's here. When I'm preaching, &gt;&gt; preachers know how to say amen to a preacher more than anybody. I think they know that they need the amen. So, you give that to him tonight. He's going to share something in the word of God. I was talking to him to the office. I don't know uh have you if you've heard the Christians that have been killed in Nigeria in his country in the last this last year, but also the last couple months it's even more severe. One day there was 200 that were killed and brother Tony said it's mostly in the north um when that's happening. Um but you know it has a potential to to spread sometimes and so that's terrible you know to see that they're being killed for the Christian faith. And so let's just lift our uh brothers and sisters up and those that have lost their family members and uh somehow God could step in and change that situation because there's a lot of Christians losing their lives by the pressure that they're under there in the north of Nigeria. So let's pray for them if you would. Amen. So we're going to have brother Tony come tonight sharing the word of God. And we want to do as the song says we want to be shut in with God in that secret place. It's one thing about the word is it's a dimension to itself. And if we're drawn into that dimension, we can be in another place with him where he can speak to us. It's a little bit extra effort on Wednesday nights when we're a little tired. So to enter in and to just say, "Lord, just bring me in to receive what you have for me." Um just still enjoying an overflow of his presence here and in our lives from Sunday. I had such liberty to minister the word of God this Sunday. I pray brother Tony will have it tonight. You all have shown your hunger for the word of God. you I was shown your response to the word of God and u I believe like sister Julie was saying there at the uh the the communion service that God knows how to prepare for the right kind of revival and he may be just getting our hearts in the right place uh for him to send a true revival. How many would agree I' I'd love to see my life deeper in him but we don't want to work up anything. We want our hearts prepared for it. But I I trust our expectations will be that and every word he gives us even tonight will just add word upon word upon word upon word and then something strikes that and boy I'll tell you he he really has always has greater things in mind for us. So we love him tonight. Shut in with God and let's get behind the word of God tonight and bless our brother. As I said he's family. Brother Tony you're family among us. So you feel at home tonight to minister the word of God. And uh he's come in the country for a few conventions. convention speaker South America and Canada and different places. So we don't want to miss enjoying what the Lord has dropped in his heart tonight with God in a &gt;&gt; let's worship him now. Thank you pastor. Thank you pastor. Thank you. There in the spirit in his face my power to run in the race. I love to be shouting with God. One more time. Oh yes. Shut we go in the sea creepless. There in the spirit beholding his face. gaining new power to run in the race. Oh, I am called to be shouting with God. Hallelujah. How many of us tonight will say, Lord, I want to be shouting with you, Lord Jesus. I want to be in fellow with you tonight. God bless you all. You may have a seat. God bless you. We are so glad to be back in the house of Lord this evening to feed on the word and to fellowship. I want to thank the pastor for having me here to encourage the church a little bit. I kind of get me a little nervous but I believe believe that when there's called for duty we have to be ready &gt;&gt; and uh it's not by what our own might. He's not by our power by might by by his grace. &gt;&gt; So I want to thank the pastor for the his kindness to us and you all in this assembly for your love for me and my family all the ministers all the church elders. May God bless you all. I feel home here with you all. &gt;&gt; And you know I just came back from Nigeria. I was in Nigeria. I went to Canada for a convention to speak and then I came from there. But you know understand when I first come from Nigeria that like that my accent get little pretty heavy. So you need to listen very pretty close you know when you when we have our guest minister from the United anywhere in the world come to Niger and they preaching their accent we don't speak like they do but we have to listen very close to understand what they're saying. So you do the same for me tonight. May God bless you. I want to thank you all again. I thank pas pastor pastor John Paul and the lovely family. May God bless them for their kindness to us. Praise the Lord. I'm going to try my best not to take your time. I know this is Wednesday night. If I was telling brother Brandon that even back our church Nigeria, I hardly preach on Wednesdays because I know people are tired. They always watching their their their watch and then that made made the preacher really nervous. So I have my young minister and brothers to preach during the week on Wednesday and Friday night services and on Sundays I preach because sometime we have some guests new people in the church that need to hear about the gospel of Christ. So you be with me tonight and listen very pretty close. Praise the Lord. Like I said I'll try my best not to take your time but don't put you under pressure. Just say amen to the word of God. Hallelujah. You know what brother Abraham says whenever I come to the house of God he say time c seizes &gt;&gt; I know preach they don't like to hear that &gt;&gt; you know but that's the truth cuz we are dealing with an eternal word you hear what pastor pastor just just told you about Nigeria the killing Christian in our country right now that's not happening in America one of these brother said we don't have this opportunity anymore anymore &gt;&gt; they will shut our doors won't be able to come back here to put fellowship anymore. All this be a memorial. &gt;&gt; So while we are still here today, let's enjoy the fellowship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless you in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Then I want to wish brother Dana happy birthday. Where's brother Dana? God bless my brother. I was in his house last night with sister Jen. He's my son and my daughter-in-law, my grandchildren. Uh he's 80 80 years old. I think you don't look no 80. May God bless you, sir. God bless Rodana. I really love the family. And um the last time that um sometimes ago when I came to preach, I believe in the old church or here I believe in the old church I um I preach on a message, a scripture message that titled the rock of my salvation. &gt;&gt; Praise. I don't even remember that. And uh I don't know if I ever finish that message. A very powerful message that which I really I was blessed with. And tonight long willing if I have your favor and God's favor tonight. I pray for the auction auction of the Holy Spirit to advance a little bit further and dig a little deeper today in our own little humble way to cap off the message gloriously. But I just want to testify the fact that tonight Jesus is still the rock of my salvation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah somebody. &gt;&gt; And I hope tonight I see your rock too. That we said last time rock denote stability. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord somebody. &gt;&gt; The rock is the Christ is our rock. Christ the solid rock. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We are we sing that song. Praise the Lord. We have an anchor that keep the soul &gt;&gt; steadfast and sure while the billows roll fasten to the rock which cannot move &gt;&gt; grounded firm and deep in the savior's love. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care what kind of trial we have. &gt;&gt; There's an anchor that keep our soul. &gt;&gt; Like brother, I'm not the one holding him. He's the one holding my hands. &gt;&gt; We sing another song. Jesus hold my hands. I need you every hour. He hold my hands. If I'm the one holding his hand, he don't know how I drop this hand. &gt;&gt; But he's the one holding me. When I fall, he put me up. You ain't going nowhere. And he's doing the same to us. &gt;&gt; And that is amazing grace. Hallelujah. That's right. &gt;&gt; So I was going to speak tonight before on the grace of God. The God of second chance, God of many chances, which is based on grace of the grace of God. And that's what who our God is. &gt;&gt; He's God of many chances. &gt;&gt; If not for that, none of us will be here today. &gt;&gt; You remember I was thinking about Jonah. When God sent Jonah to Nineve &gt;&gt; and he got went to Tash on on vacation, God rather should have destroyed killed that man. But so God still give me another chance to go and deliver the message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So the same thing with David. Many of them like that. &gt;&gt; That's who we are today. &gt;&gt; We accept a God of many chances. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; May his name be praised forever more. Tonight if you don't have a Bible not to waste your time I'm going to read a couple scriptures and quotes of the prophet. If you don't make me nervous we close on on time. If you say amen to the word we go home on time. You don't but just look at like watching television we'll be here. for I'm just kidding. You're going to be here for a while. This This is Wednesday. Wednesday. And in Deuteronomy 29:29, I want to speak tonight uh for the next few minutes. I find los on the subject of um the secret thing things belong to God. And I subtitled it the supernatural adoption of the end time bride. supernatural adoption end time bride. So if you have a Bible tonight, children of God, let's read together from um um Deuteronomy 29:29 by for prayer if you don't mind. How many of us here have a need in your life tonight? God bless you. He knows all things. Hallelujah. That song say my Jesus knows all my needs. &gt;&gt; He satisfies and every need supplies. &gt;&gt; Whatever you need from him tonight, just put from him. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Let's pray at this time. Heavenly father in the name of Jesus Christ. We have come today to you again as our master savior God that can do all things. &gt;&gt; We are asking that you help us tonight Lord as your children. We are weak but thou are strong. Lord may you supply every need of the every hand that was raised up tonight. They signify a need one day or the other. maybe for healing of the body or some kind of need somewhere. But the Bible say you're the all knowing God. &gt;&gt; May you supply every need tonight in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. And as for me tonight, Lord, I'm so unworthy to stand behind this secret desk. I just came back from a many trip for four countries trip preaching the gospel. And Lord, I just pray that you give me strength &gt;&gt; and give me a clarity of speech to your children and let it be God speaking tonight. Amen. For a man's word shall fail, heaven are not will pass away, but your will stand forever more. &gt;&gt; In Jesus Christ's name we prayed. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 29 um verse 29 and it says the secret things belong unto the Lord our God. But those things which are revealed belong unto us and our children forever. Not for weekend or for Wednesday night but forever. &gt;&gt; That we may do all the words of this law. Hallelujah. And you know that there the Bible is not talking about doing the following law of the Pharisees or Pharisees. I'm talking about obeying the word of God. Hallelujah. Cuz in Matthew 5:16, Jesus said, "I did not come to remove the laws that to fulfill the law." Praise the Lord. And we today fulfill the laws of God by simply simple obedience by faith to his word. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Okay. Let's turn to 1 Corinthians 2 6-12 also and says how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery watch even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory. which none of none. Everybody say none. &gt;&gt; Which none of the princes of this world knew. For had they known it, they would they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But as is written, I had not seen nor ear heard, neither have entered into the hearts of men the things which God had prepared for them that love him. Then he said, "But I like that God had revealed them unto us by his spirit. &gt;&gt; For the spirit searchth all things, yeah, the deep things of God, the deep things of God, I like that." &gt;&gt; So much deep people of God that we can see today by God's God's grace that our journey from here to glory line is no longer a secret. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. somebody because the b the seals have been broken. Hallelujah. The Bible is no longer a secret to us. It's a it's an open book. Hallelujah. For the prophet, the prophetic promise for this day, this last day is in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he not day, as of many, one voice. When he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God shall be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets. Hallelujah. May I have a seat? God bless you. Um so Apostle Paul reaffirmed this truth in our testimony by saying I had not seen nor ear heard neither had have entered into the hearts of men the things which God had prepared for them that love him. But God can reveal them unto us by his spirit. For the spirit searchth all things. Yeah. The deep things of God. 11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man, which is a name. Even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the spirit of God. 12 Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God, &gt;&gt; without money, without price. 13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 14 But the natural man referee not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are specially discerned. But he that that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judge of no man. For who had known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him, but we have the mind of Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord. Um I want to start by saying that revelation is very important to the church of God, to the believer's life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We cannot come to church because somebody invited us or we come for our friends. say sake of our spouse's uh uh sake that make us make believers. &gt;&gt; We have to have our own personal experience with Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We have to be really born again. Hallelujah. And feel the holy ghost. Hallelujah. And brother Abraham said seven churches page 13 talk about the importance of re revelation there. He said the importance of re revelation by the spirit to a true believer. Now true believer now can never be overemphasized. That is we can never talk or preach too much to a general believer about revelation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Then he said revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like I talk about healing the other day. But say if you're sick, just imagine your healthy person standing in front of you and walking to that &gt;&gt; and you gonna be you'll be healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that's simple. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise. Yes, sir. If if you we just heard Apostle Paul said also a natural or canal man cannot understand the things of the spirit of God for they are spiritually discerned. Brother Brown said, "I am talking about all revelation. It is tremendously important to the church." Hallelujah. And also remember that brother Brown prophet taught us that Satan hates only two books in the entire Bible. &gt;&gt; And that is the book of Re Genesis and Revelation and the ending. &gt;&gt; Let me read a quote quickly in re the book of the seven church of Jesus. If I talk too too fast for you, that's just the effect of just coming back from for Africa. Just watch my lips. Hallelujah. And listen very closely. I love you, church. God bless you, brother. Say in this revelation, he tells us what the end of the devil is, how he's going to deal with the devil and cast him into the lake of fire. I like that. A amen. One of my one of my one of my preacher preacher friends said some time ago, he said, "If devil comes to show or remind you about your weakness or mistakes, you show me his end." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to be turned to lake of fire. Hallelujah. That's his saying. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's going to toast in hell like a bread. But our said he revealed the end of the wicked ones who followed Satan unbelievers and Satan hates that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then he continue by saying, "Have you ever noticed how Satan hates two books of the Bible more than all their others?" Through liberal theologians and pseudocientists, he is always attacking the book of Genesis and the book of Revelation. &gt;&gt; In both of these books, we find Satan's origin, right? His ways and his destruction. That's why he attacks them. He has to be exposed. And in those books, he is exposed for exactly what he is. &gt;&gt; Jesus said about Satan, he had no pardon me and I have no pardoning. The devil would like to prove that different but he cannot. So he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word word. &gt;&gt; That's what it does. &gt;&gt; Needs to doubt the word of God. Hallelujah. Man, the Bible say by his strip you are healed. &gt;&gt; He's going to give you another idea. Don't listen to the devil. Stay with the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You do whether you understand or not, just say, "Father, I don't understand, but I believe." Amen. Do like Peter. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The devil would like to prove that different. But he cannot. So, he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word of God. But when the church disbelieves Satan and believe the spirit revelation of the word, the gates of hell cannot prevail against her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, I I tell some some people in journey. I was in journey last month. I said, you know, God give me a grace to do. So when I come to the Lord, he g give me grace about how to deal with that. How many of us here have battle of the mind here? Let me see your hand. I know you do. I do too. I know you be lying if you say you don't. The devil talk to us in our mind every second &gt;&gt; every weird thought to weaken your faith to discourage you. &gt;&gt; But when that come to and it's a spirit is around. We don't see him but he's there. So what is this I do brother Paul in my bedroom Nigerian when they begin to talk to my ears all those nonsense I said sister I know you are here I cannot see but I know you are here I said the Lord rebuke you in Jesus Jesus name &gt;&gt; I mean to sing songs of praises I mean to praise praise God hallelujah &gt;&gt; but the man said good gospel music cast the devil out &gt;&gt; or sometime I put sermon tapes because he know that man is &gt;&gt; Paul I know Jesus I know too but who art thou &gt;&gt; he know that the voice God for this hour he that the atmosphere be clean for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And also remember brother said each of us the creator said we create the atmosphere in which we live. Praise the Lord. You can do that. Hallelujah. We begin to talk all kind of rubbish your ears or head. He's standing on your head. You don't see him but just say I know you here. Just go and bring with play some gospel song some tape. He will leave. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And know that Apostle Paul declared in our test tonight in 1 Corinthians 2:9 that I had not seen nor ear heard neither have entered to the heart of men the things which God had prepared for them that love him. I wish I have time tonight. This is a Wednesday night. I'm I want to be very careful to show us that we have some great event to look forward to. &gt;&gt; Great event. Glorious event people of God. Brother Gideon wonderful time. Come. Hallelujah. Somebody &gt;&gt; we have passed from death unto life. People of God, &gt;&gt; we're not only we are the bride of Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, but God has revealed them to us by his spirit. For the spirit searchth all things. Yeah. The deep things of God. &gt;&gt; That's why probably after the sea was open, we to talk about the future home. Hallelujah. The rapture. Things that are to be &gt;&gt; things that we never heard in church. church priesty &gt;&gt; because now we are living in a different dimension. Hallelujah. And we find out that the book of revelation is the program of God for redemption. And if you follow the order of the events in the book of revelation, you will see how our prophet orderly placed the book in accordance to God's eternal salvation plan. Right? From revelation chapter 1 to chapter 22. Yeah. Praise the Lord. Well, I probably thought about the guy that came to his brother Abraham James have eaten some hot pepper soup that night when he wrote that thing. He did understand their account. They cannot catch it. &gt;&gt; But God was showing John things that will be in the future is God's plan for redemption. Hallelujah. For example, here I probably taugh us in Revelation chapter one that Revelation chapter 1 through 3 is the gentile dispensation. Hallelujah. or the period of seven churchages which Apostle Paul also referred to as the fullness of times. Hallelujah. Galatians 4:4-7. Let me read that quickly. Galatians 4:4-7. Paul said, "But when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them." Who? You and I. &gt;&gt; That were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons. Hallelujah. There goes your spiritual adoption this tonight of the bride without any natural blood relation to add Abraham. Now we have access and claim to Abraham's blessings. We're not related to him. We're not Jews in the flesh. Hallelujah. But by the faith of Christ, we are Abraham's seed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody Romans 2. We are not Jews. We know Jew and Jew and are you average Jew like they're very proud. You go to New York see them there. I'm a Jew. I'm Jew but they not the real where the real Jew in the spirit. Romans 2:28 and 29 says for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly neither is the circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a Jew which is one inwardly &gt;&gt; and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit the Holy Ghost baptism and not in letter whose praise is not of men but of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody, I want to come to read Galatians 4:E 6. And be and because ye are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying aba father. &gt;&gt; Wherefore thou art no more a servant that Jesus told the servant saying you're not my servant. You are friends. You're my friends. Because his servant does not know what his lord does. &gt;&gt; He had to share some deep things with them. Wherefore th there are no more a servant but a son. How many of us are when he say son that sisters included now. How many of us are children of God? Here let me see your hand. Therefore therefore that no more no more a no more servant but a son and if a son then and here hallelujah of God through Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah somebody. We have claim to everything that Christ died for. Hallelujah. and everything that God gave father Abraham is ours as well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord somebody. Now quickly let me let me go through the other events in the book of Revelation before I got too excited here. Hallelujah. Somebody brother Deans brother Pauli in Georgia he told me in Georgia many years ago said I preach said brother Tony after the preacher have cleaned all the devils out of the church. Anybody want to preach? I see I hear you. &gt;&gt; So re chapter one to three are the seven watches or the seven church ages. You can help me put that on on is the sisters working? Are they putting my slide and then I'm going to use this right? Okay. No, I'm not there yet. Not that one. I only my quotes and not on pictures yet. God bless you. Go to my scriptures and quotes first. So revelation chapter one chapters 1 to3 are the seven watches or the seven churches. Revelation chapter 4 is the rapture. Hallelujah. For John was summoned to come up hither. John being the top of the bride. Hallelujah. Revelation chapter 5 up to 17 are the seven seals, the seven vials, the seven trumpets. Revelation 11 is the ministry ministry of those two olive trees, the two prophets, Moses and Elijah to the Jews to call out the 144,000 Benjamins from Israel for their uh atonement feast. Are you with me? Somebody say amen, somebody. And the brother did not return back to the earth again until revelation the 19th chapter with our groom on the white horse. You can give me that. Give me the Lord cried that white horses. Brother, sister, whoever is there at the back there, can you please give me my pictures then? Do you mind? Can they hear me? Hello. Please give me my my pictures. Do you can I No, not that one. The next one I put. There you go. That's Christ. That Revelation 19 there. Praise the Lord. Nasty. Thank you. Now I got you now. I got the hang of this on this one. That's Christ on the white horse. And the bride is coming by hand. No, no, no, no, no. I No, no, no. I don't need that right now. I'm sorry about that. Anyway, this high-tech thing, there something else. But Christ came back with you can see the host of heaven. That's you and I on the white horse. Come back for the millennium reign on earth. &gt;&gt; And this is coming people of God. This is still true story, true prophecy. &gt;&gt; And we're going to be there by the grace of God. Hallelujah. And after this is the millennium reign, the white throne judgment, the battle of Gog and Magog, new Jerusalem descending like a bride adon to her husband and eternity reign from there on. Hallelujah. But Abraham said here Revelation 4 verse 1 he read I want to read Revelation 4:1. He said after this I looked and behold a door was open. Now you can give me the door now. Okay. Where is that door that you just give me now? Right there. And I and I look and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice this just a symbol. And I heard and I and I heard and which and and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which says come up hither and I will show thee things which must be hereafter. Hallelujah that represent the rapture. Praise the Lord. Come up hither. Hallelujah. And then the message revelation 4 part 2 uh 961 uh January 1 it say now we find that after after these things the Bible said see after means that after the churches churches had ceased then John was summoned to come up hither higher come up higher which means come up here so she show him all that was going to happen in the world on the church age. Then after the church ages was over, we find that John was a type of the true believer that would be summoned by Christ on high. That's right. Someone come up hither. And we find out that the voice that spoke to him was the voice of a trumpet clear decently. And it was the same voice that spoke to him here on earth. Hallelujah. See, as long as he was in the midst of the seven golden candlestick, he was speaking to to the church. Oh, I like that. Speaking from the candlesticks. See, he was in the candlesticks. Speaking to from them to his church. Then when the church age has ceased, he left the earth and moved up to the heavens and he called his redeem up with him. That's what he promised. That wherever I am, you may that may be also, right? So, wherever Jesus Christ is, we're going to be with him there. Hallelujah. Oh, isn't that beautiful? It just made me just make my heart jump. Hallelujah. Praise God. It made my heart jump to to know I'm going to be in rapture. People are we not be in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Bible say we not we're going we are not going to sleep. Brother Dana I was telling brother Dana to I said very soon you're going to be 90. He said I don't want to stay that long. God bless. I said but that's longevity. Longevity is a blessing. He said that I want Christ to come. He has delayed too for too long. I want to come. I said but if he delays, if he tries as he likes, who are we to complain? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's praise. Even so come Lord Jesus. My confession tonight people of God is that I still believe this glorious end time message. People are leaving it left and right. I'm not going anywhere. Praise praise the Lord. I still believe this full word revealed word of Yah. Hallelujah. I'm not looking for another one. I don't want need another prophet another voice. I already got mine. I don't about you. &gt;&gt; I ain't go nowhere. I quit shopping when I came to this message. I am home to stay forever in this message throughout eternity. By the grace of God, &gt;&gt; I still believe that that God is the healer tonight. &gt;&gt; How many of us are sick tonight? If you are sick, my God will heal you. &gt;&gt; Why are they leaving the message? But the brand sent the message supernatural. said the reason why they doing that because they lose their faith. That's what they're doing. That's that's what happened. Once you lose your faith, you out on the streets. Don't ever lose your faith in Christ cuz he's not dead, people of God. He's still a healer. Hallelujah. He's still a savior. He still answered prayers. He still supply all our needs. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The problem is not with him. He's with us. Hallelujah. I believe our God can do all things. &gt;&gt; What what do I do tonight? &gt;&gt; I still believe in his grace. Somebody someone say we preach on grace too. No, no, no. We have plenty on the other side too. If you want the other one, we can preach on the other side too. But I still believe now on the grace of God. But Paul said by grace are ye saved and that not of your own. It's a gift of God. &gt;&gt; It's not by power by not what you have done. Hallelujah. But what he had done for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. I still believe tonight in the power the power of God. I still believe in his word. I still believe in importance mean all powerful. Hallelujah. In my Bible, the Bible say in Psalm 33:6 that by the word of the of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So our God is omnipotent tonight. He has always been. He can do all things. He can believe all things are possible for us. So, hallelujah. And he's not dead. Hallelujah. I told them in Brazil, we sing a song here in America. God's not dead. He's alive. God's not dead. He's alive. God, he's not dead. He's alive. I feeling in my heart. I feeling is that how it goes? I feeling in my whole body. He's not dead. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are sick now, my God will heal you. &gt;&gt; I don't care what they going through. He can deliver you from any kind of problems. &gt;&gt; He's not dead. Hallelujah. He's omnipotent. Hallelujah. Somebody years ago, there's a preacher in England called Author Pink. I don't know if you ever read his book. And he said he has something to say about the importance of God. And I want to read that to you. He said, "Well, may the saint trust such a God." They're not giving my quotes. I don't know. Maybe I should go back. I'm sorry I'm &gt;&gt; they just &gt;&gt; they don't have any Oh no. &gt;&gt; Oh no. I sent it. That's old devil. I sent to them. So I asked my son if they have WhatsApp number that I can send to WhatsApp for a backup. But that's okay. I'll be reading for you then. That's may make better. Then the after pink said well may the saint trust such a god he is worthy of implicit confidence. Implicit mean unlimited confidence. Nothing is too hard for him. &gt;&gt; If said if God were stinted in mighted mean to be inadequate or insufficient in in mind in power. If God was sced in might and had had a limit to his strength, we might as well despair on fear. But see that is clothe with omnipotence. No prayer is too hard for him to answer. &gt;&gt; Can somebody say tonight? No, I don't care what about they are not too hard for him to answer. No needs too great for him to supply. &gt;&gt; No passion too strong for him to subdue. &gt;&gt; No temptation too powerful for him to deliver from. and no misery too deep for him to deliver relieve. &gt;&gt; So no matter what you're going through tonight, his only potent can help you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He grant the victory and give you peace. Do you believe that tonight son of God? &gt;&gt; All right. Now quickly I want to go by my my sermon so I can close quickly. In my in our test tonight, we read from um Deuteronomy 29:29 on the secret things belongs to God, but things that are revealed belong to our children forever. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Before I left Nigeria, Pastor Paul, I was preaching on the subject of the kingdom of God and the kingdom of men, which we still have a lot to things to cover. That's how it is with the word of God, especially in the book of Revelation. God God's word is eternal. Something will lead to dead like Paul was saying the other day, you can't just stop. The word of God is interconnected. Hallelujah. There's no end to the word of God. It's eternal. Praise the Lord. Especially when we're studying from the book of Revelation, it is non-stop. Light upon light follows like Brown said to eliminate the word of God. Hallelujah. And there are so many too many so many secrets in I'm talking about this God's secret. The secret things belong to God. But things that are revealed belong to us and our children forever. There are so many secrets inside the book of revelation and that's why they are called mysteries. Hallelujah. And what is a mystery? We let the prophet go answer the question himself in the message. Is this the sign of the answers? December 3, 1962 paragraph 244. Brother said, "A mystery is scripture. A previously hidden truth now divinely revealed divinely but with the spiritual element in it. This part revelation &gt;&gt; then we need to mention the mystery revealed to the bright end time bride in this last days. He said the greater the greater mysteries and the great mysteries are he said number one the mystery of the kingdom of heaven. Hallelujah. That's the one we are talking on on now. Matthew 13:3-50. And our second mystery is the mystery of Israel's blindness during this age. Romans 11:25 with the with with the contest. Romans 11:25-26 says, "For I for I will not, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happen to Israel until the fullness of Gentiles become." Hallelujah. God blinded blinded Israel so they can come in. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They can they can be saved. They want to be saved but God blinded their eyes and so all Israel shall be saved as is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungoliness from Jacob. Praise the Lord. But now you know that one time was going to go to going to go to Israel to preach to them. uh his friend I believe Luis Petros a Jewish man said but if you can come to Israel and display this prophetic gift the Jews will believe you they believe in the Lord Jesus Christ but ra to Israel to preach and use the gift the prophetic gift before them because they believe the Jews always believe they're prophets and when he landed in Cairo Egypt and uh then he he The the word said you should go behind the anger and say the time is not yet &gt;&gt; Bill this not the time go and I send somewhere else went to India. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother said one I said see he love to he love to um go there and win some of them to Lord and said do you believe in the prophet? Yes. I said come on come on here and begin to display the gifts but it's not his ministry. Hallelujah. That's for Moses Elijah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He sent a message handwriting on the wall uh September 2nd 1956. He said here the other day but Aambrite showed me that picture 3 minutes before midnight. That wasn't that that that wasn't Christians. That was science said that the old clock has went away and the pendulum has beat back and forth back and forth through troubles and chaos and gospel sermons and messages until finally she's 3 minutes before midnight. And I see that picture and I seen them bringing those Jews. Excuse me. I seen them bringing those Jews in. Coming down from Iran. Hallelujah. Somebody &gt;&gt; bring them from Iran. Oh my. Hallelujah. Coming down from Egypt. Coming down from all over the world. And there's packing them in. boys packing their old mommy and their and their back and they went up in to interview them. When we when we landed just below and I landed in Caro, Egypt, I seen them big planes coming in loaded with with with um Is it off? What? What happened? Can I put this? Okay. Hey, thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. It's up again. What did I do wrong my brother? &gt;&gt; All right. There. That's there. Yes. When we landed just below and and I landed in Caro, Egypt and I seen them big planes coming in loaded with the with those people walk up and said, "What are you going to what are you going back to the homeland for? Are you going back there to die so you can be buried in the homelands?" Those old Jews with tears run down there. She said, "No, we are going there to meet the Messiah." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are going there to see the Messiah. He'll be there soon. M &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're not going to to die. They're going to see Messiah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And that is what we should make us to be on fire for God because &gt;&gt; that time is almost up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Once he say I accept the gospel is over. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; and then another message Jar brother say I was at Caro Egypt going to Palestine. The Jew will believe it. the Jews six signs and they will believe it and we had a bunch of them. I was going to bring thousand of them out. You see you that's plan to bring many many of them out into the the gospel. When Lis Petros sent the Bible back there when those Jews came off from Iran and was looking at the Bible they said if this be the Messiah they never heard anything about the Messiah said if this just be the Messiah then let us see him do the sign of the prophet and we believe it. I promise surely they will. I tell they'll believe it. &gt;&gt; Jesus said when you see the fig tree putting forth its yonder when them Jews coming in this with in the six point star of David flying the first time for 20 2500 years the oldest flag in the whole world they become a nation on the sixth day on the seventh day of May 1946. on the sixth day rather on the seventh day the the same time the angel of law appeared down there and sent out this message just just look at the time peace of God the scene that God commissioned the prophet in in Greenmail &gt;&gt; the following day exactly right you see it was for to know what take place then I was I was right at Caro and the Holy Spirit said not at this tower return back and I went back to Rome That's right. Just not the hour when the Jews receive the gospel, the gentile is finished. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Brown said, "Where where those Jews have been brought back to their homeland back in 1950s, his friend Li Petrus asked him to visit Palestine with prophetic gift in his life and that the Jews will believe on the Lord Jesus." But the prophet of God immediately bought his flight ticket to Palestine. But when they land in the carrot Egypt, the angel of the Lord stopped him from going to Israel because it is not the time yet for Israel blindness to the gospel of Christ to be removed. Hallelujah. That's number number two mystery that was revealed this. We don't know that. We've been dimension for many years. Nobody ever taught us this. &gt;&gt; But in this day, God opened the Bible. Now we know this truth. The third mystery is the the translation, the rapture of the living state sent at the end of the age. Hallelujah. The rapture of the saint 1 Corinthians 4:15 and also 1 Thessalonians 4:14-17 that people of God there will be a rapture in this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we are doing. That's why we are coming to church to be prepared. &gt;&gt; We are feeding on that word because we want to have that rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When the pastor come here to labor, it's a lot of work for him to do. People of God, it's not easy. Hallelujah. I'm saying that because I know I've been I know how it feels. I'm a pastor too and I know you have to go and study all night. I asked my son I couldn't sleep. She said yesterday I learned yesterday I'm going to preach today. I couldn't sleep. It's a lot of work. But that word is to prepare us for the rapture. &gt;&gt; That's why it's good to come to church. People of God, come to church people. &gt;&gt; Don't stay home and play tapes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come and hear the word of God. Hallelujah. But the brand said the fire for ministry is a bright dress wear. &gt;&gt; They they will dress you us for the rapture &gt;&gt; and they said rapturing faith is in the messages. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody the more you hear the word the more that word changes you. &gt;&gt; You don't see what don't understand what's going on in the street world but we are being changed. Like that person said that black person in the south said I I know I ain't what I'm supposed to be but I'm sure ain't what I used to be. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are changing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With that song said from glory to glory is changing me. &gt;&gt; Is changing me. He's changing me. His likeness and image to perfect in me. The love of God shown to the world for he's changing changing me from earthly thing to the heavenly his likeness and image to perfect in me the love of God shown to the as the preach the pastor is preaching other ministers we are being changed hallelujah &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; you just when when at the last supper when Lord was going to wash Peter's Peter's feet he said Lord Lord That's the Lord's job in Israel. He said Lord you won't wash my feet. The Lord said you don't Peter don't wash your feet you have no pard me. Oh Pet said that's that's different then not only my feet don't all my hair all my the Lord said no you don't need to do all that. He that cleans needs not what to wash. So you're already clean. He said the word I spoke to you has cleansed you. The sanifying power is the word of God. Hallelujah. It's not the word of man. It's not pastor Paul's word. It's God's word. It's not about my what is his word. &gt;&gt; You become the word and you see the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I love what my late friend Habbran said many years ago said before the word can work for you, you must first agree with the word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Don't resend the word of God. Young people don't resend the word of God. Accept it. &gt;&gt; Apply to your life. Hallelujah. I know there are some things that you to preach in the past that if you preach it today the church be will be be few in number don't want to preach about it anymore we preach about life people's life by biting gospel in the church hallelujah lost brother pastor preach the other day on Sunday they part of gospel hallelujah don't go about to run your brother and sister down hallelujah &gt;&gt; the Bible says speak evil or No man, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Don't ever go behind your brother or sister. How can you tell brother your sister God bless and go behind the back and run them? That that's not good. That's on Christian. That's ungodly. Praise the Lord. Always speak good of your brothers and sister. Brothers, if you have nothing, you don't have anything good to say, keep your mouth shut. Praise the Lord. I'm sorry. And if now that's the mystery of Israel and the rapture. Hallelujah. But before Israel can receive the gospel, we're going to be out of here. Hallelujah. And the fourth ministry of is the of the of the new is the New Testament church testament church as one body composed of both Jews and Gentiles. That's right. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says some Jews are going to be allowed to come in the gentile bride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that people like L Petros is a Jewish man, &gt;&gt; but believe this message. &gt;&gt; That's God's own prerogative. Hallelujah. The fifth mystery is to the church as the bride of Christ. We don't know that the church the bride of Christ, Pastor Paul. No, they don't teach us back organization. Jesus church. But now we know the church the true church is the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to stop there talking about um the the um I need to close pastor and I'm watching your faces and talking about the rapture. The Bible said blood flesh and blood cannot inherit God's wisdom kingdom. We have to be changed. Hallelujah. And I probably talk about the seven dimension. How remember the seven dimensions? &gt;&gt; He said there are seven dimension. Right. light matter time. Hallelujah. hate hate hell or or grave product that that now is on the under the or under the altar and part that hallelujah and the abort of abot of God are you with somebody &gt;&gt; I had that all that all this the devil's m today I had that quote I want to share with you but said we live on the first three dimension light matter time that's why our bodies cannot disintegrate Our bodies stay together. Hallelujah. And the fourth dimension is science. Praise. Praise the Lord. We talk about all kind of invention today in America and all over the world by science. But said what happened? The devil broke into God's laboratory. &gt;&gt; That this that's true. He just went to the laborator and peeped and closed the door and for those few second what he saw that's why he was able to achieve what he has achieved today. Satan being being an impersonator. Hallelujah. So the so the first three dimension is light, mother time. The fourth dimension is science. The fifth dimension is hell, hes or grave. And the six the sixth is paradise that now is. Let me stop there before I close tonight. We're talking about secret things that belong to God. When Adam and Eve sin in Garden of Eden, before they sin, they were living eternity in the garden, right? They are eternal. They are they are God. God of the earth and God is God of the whole universe. Adam named all the animals in the in the king in Eden. Hallelujah. And um after the sin came to mankind after the the fall everything changed. And we remember the Bible say in Genesis that God drove out of the garden. They were driven out of garden. And after they died, they could not go to God because the door was shut &gt;&gt; of fellowship. But just open that gate. Remember open that open ye gate everlasting gate. Remember Christ opened that. &gt;&gt; That's why you don't need to open that gate anymore. Today we have to open open the door for rapture. I'm come to that very close. Praise the Lord. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And after Adam and Adam and Eve all generation died, they could not go to heaven. So God in demonology said God prepare a paradise for them under the earth including demology a waiting place because they not the blood had not shed yet and that's why they were I can tell of some story now about that story so that I share with people I like that story that's why everyone that died from Adam to the to before Calvary that's why they were waiting for the blood to be shed shed and after the blood was shed there was a rapture man 27 right remember Bible said I can read it if you have time if you're not in a hurry but the Bible told us that in M 27 well when Christ crashed on was down the cross and in cry the lord was Eli Eli lamas bakani b said the grace of the saint cracked is that the truth that's in the bible That's right. &gt;&gt; And then they came out with him after his resurrection because they cannot come before him because he's a mighty conqueror. &gt;&gt; Are you with somebody? &gt;&gt; You have to go to that old paradise that then was to bring him out himself. &gt;&gt; Are you with somebody? &gt;&gt; And then when he went there, I I like the story that somebody told. He said when Lazarus died, Christ had not died shed his paid the price of for our sins. He said that uh when Lazar died was a a good follower of Christ and was faithful believer. When he pass died he went to that same place to wait. But when he arrived there like a a big city a waiting place. When he arrived there it was fellowship time. But man said death does not change who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; That only change your place of our board &gt;&gt; where you live. That's why he say if you're a liar here, you be a liar hell. &gt;&gt; If you're a Christian here, you're going to be a Christian over there. &gt;&gt; So when they got there to tele fellowship time and he saw and he saw father Abraham, he saw Isaac and Israel, Jacob and every everybody g their testimony. He said they postponed to testify was father Abraham talk about how he knew the Lord. Say oh children I know him. I know him. They say how do you know? say I know him. I remember when he came to me under the oak tree with two angels. He promised to give me a son. Me being an old man and he also told me about this plan to distrust and Gomorrah. After father Abraham was done, here come Isaac said, "Father Abraham, father, I know him too." They said, "How do you know him?" He said, "Well, after you are gone, he came to me and revealed him and said to me and said, we establish his covenant with you with me too." Really? Yeah, I know him too. Then here come Jacob said, "Grandfather Abraham, father Isaac, I know him too." Say, "You how do you know me?" He said, "Well, I can't remember. I can never forget that day that he came to me. We wrestle all night long." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wrestle with me and I wrestle with I let him go until he blessed me and he touched my side and been to limp. That's right. &gt;&gt; Really? And here's a new arrival in paradise. Then Lazarus and Christ was over there on earth in in in Jerusalem. And that story said that um the Lazarus said, "Father Abraham uh Father Isaac, I know him to this day. You are just a new arrival here in paradise. How do you know him?" Said, "I know him." He said, "Look." And at that time, Christ was at at this at the grave on earth. And he said, "Oh, I know him too." They said, "How you know?" He said, "Oh, I walked with him and went to preach with him." He said, "We eat on the same table, even sleep on the same bed." He said, "Nobody ever call my name like he called my name." He said, "Brother Lazarus." He said, "Nobody ever called my name like said about that time Christ was at his grave on earth and call him Lazarus come forth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At that voice, all these days too. He said they said when l when Christ called Lazarus that voice echoed into eternity sign for the owner of that name. Hallelujah. And that name if God Christ has not said Lazarus with that voice all the death in come up that proper &gt;&gt; but when he say Lazarus that voice went to the owner bear that name straight &gt;&gt; and Lazarus said in fact matter fact he's calling right now I got to go and left and came back to life on the other side on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's the that was I need to close tonight. People of God, these are the things that God has revealed to us this last and they are true. Praise the Lord somebody. &gt;&gt; Amenise. &gt;&gt; And they now the father that when cried down on the cross after Yes. Well, and if you readology said when you're going down down there, the first place you come to the where the s of unjust are sinners who turn down the gospel of the of God in their day. That's the first place you come to. You go keep going down, you come to where the devil himself is. He has a throne. How many know the devil has a throne? &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 28. in Nigeria some years ago and someone probably remember this one preacher testified how that he doesn't have much crowd in his church and some other preachers that have a large crowd large crowd in their churches came to him and said what are you what's wrong with you how come you don't have more members in the church what's wrong come on jo our our group so he said why do I do he said well come we're going to go to a place we're meeting at night you have to come with So they put him in the store so when the day they the day that fix came they they put him in an SUV and drove out of town into the woods and then later they come to a river at that river they said they found a ko what you call boat I don't know what you call boat we s on the on the river nobody's there at that night and they packed their SUV cars and um enter the cano and start paddling kenno and they want on that river all of a sudden that can went inside the water and they found themselves on the B Palashia place under the water. This is a true story of a preacher, Pentecostal preacher. And uh when they landed there, they saw somebody this devil himself on the throne. And you know that's Satan's plan from the from the beginning. That's why he was kicked out of heaven. He want to be like God. Is that not the truth? Isaiah Isaiah chapter 12 Isaiah 28 he said I want to raise his his throne above the stars of God which is the children of God. &gt;&gt; Right? You know that that's this day he has already got that throne. The devil add that on today. He has achieved his purpose. Today millions, billions are watching Satan today in the name of Christianity. Don't even know it. Preach a message a dutured by the world. Hallelujah. And Satan's Eden. Praise the Lord. The devil has achieved his purpose in this in this day. And uh but thank God for this message that we know the truth. &gt;&gt; He said, "Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free." Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why I cannot come to this this message and be to play around. &gt;&gt; We want to be saddened of God. We want to be serious with this message &gt;&gt; and and live for God. Live for Christ, &gt;&gt; be a witness for for Christ with our lives. &gt;&gt; We have come too far to look back. &gt;&gt; There are too many things. And then and then talking about then when Christ died on the cross he emptied out he emptied out that old paradise because there's a resurrection Matthew 27 right and he took those saints let's read it if you don't mind do you have time is that okay let's read Matthew 27 I'm going to pray after this I have I've not touched the other mysteries Matthew 27 Okay. 27. Let's read from verse Verse 44 46. And about the 9inth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, Lansakani, that is to say, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Some of them that stood there when they heard that said, this man collect for Elias. And straightway one of them ran and took a sponge and fill it with v vinegar and put it on a reed and give it to drink. The rest said let be let us see whether Elias will come to save him. But Jesus said when Jesus Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the ros rent and the graves were opened. Watch and many bodies of the saints which left arose. Well, Paul said even they saw father Abraham and Sarah two feet on the street of Jerusalem and they appear Abraham said we we've been noticed and disappeared. Hallelujah. And they came out of the grave after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many. Praise the Lord. That is why how when God Christ emptied out old paradise cuz he had another one made up here in heaven which is the sixth dimension today and the if you are a Christian the Lord call it home today you're not going down there you're going up &gt;&gt; we also call it solo the altar hallelujah it's is real place but taken there cut beyond the cut of time he was taken there the angel called him one time said in the one time in his bedroom said we like to see beyond a quarter of time said yes he will help me and he all of a sudden he saw that he left his body is that the truth and he find himself in a place beautiful place there's no language vocabulary to describe the glory of that place and saw the saint there and he said he even saw his daughter she chiron rose right and Sheron said daddy I said daddy I'm not you're about you're now about same there. There's no yesterday or tomorrow. It's eternity. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the daughter said, "Dad, you don't know just know where you are. We are in heaven." And that brother said, he said, "Heaven? Yes, this is heaven." Said, "Mama is waiting for you in the house." He said house. He has a house there. I believe that you also have your house there. Your mansions. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; He has promised that.

How many of us say, "Lord Jesus Christ, I just want to be a better Christian. I want you to increase my faith. Take away my worries, my anxieties, my fears, and grant me that rationing. God bless you. God bless you, brothers. God bless you. I see your many hands raised up. God bless you. God bless you, Lord. Help me to be like you, Lord. Help me to believe your word. Tell me, tell me to be strong. I don't care what I'm going through. Be my rock. Be my stabilizer in this message, in this word. Help me. Supply my and strengthen my faith in you. Heal my faith. Heal my body. Heal my spirit. God bless you. God bless you all. Pastor Paul, can you please come in? &gt;&gt; God bless you. The word, brother. Thanks, sir. Thank you. Yes. &gt;&gt; In Jesus name we press on. Amen. Dear Lord with surprise. Thank you Lord. before our eyes. We find the strength to press on. Before we're dismissed tonight, I don't want us to miss the theme of the scripture he quoted over and over again. And don't miss the depth of this scripture that said, "The secret things belong unto the Lord our God. But those things which are revealed belong unto us. God doesn't want to keep them to himself. He wants to give them to his children. Don't you feel privileged tonight that we are the people of the mysteries. All the mysteries he's talking about. Jesus said it's given to you to know the mysteries. It's not given to everybody. And that doesn't mean we put anybody out. But we should say thank God that I when I get a revelation it's God revealing secrets to me to his elect. And get don't you parents don't forget it's to us and it's to our children. Our children need revelation too. Can you say amen? And when you see that picture of the Jews, they're catching the mystery even back then. They're catching the mystery of prophecy and they're acting out by going back into the homeland. All of that our actions are to to act on behalf of the word of God because we're fulfilling it because he's holding the secrets but he's revealing them unto us so we can live them out. It's not just that we catch the mystery, but we live it out. We live it out. And guess who's going to fulfill the mystery of the rapture? &gt;&gt; Uh he's preaching to you tonight. There's a people that's going to fulfill that mystery. We're a people of that mystery. That's why it's real to us when he talks about the resurrection, the rapture, something registered down inside. Why? Because we're not just reading about it out of our Bibles. We're a people of that mystery. Praise the Lord. God bless you. We're going to close in prayer tonight. God bless you. you'd be dismissed to get your children home and such, but it's been good to be in the house of the Lord. I is brother Dan, it's his birthday, Sister Jane, he's 80 today, is it next week? Yesterday, man, I didn't know that. So, some of the cake they have back there for Aaron is for you, too. How about that? Happy birthday to you. All right. Praise the Lord. God bless you, sir. Enjoyed the word tonight, Brother Tony. God bless you. Heavenly Father, we're just coming to the dismissal of the service and we want to say thank you for the word that's so rich to us that this great these secrets that you held in you for all this time. You want to give them to somebody. You want to you want to deposit them to a people and watch them live it out. And we feel grateful tonight. May we uphold the name of Christ the very best we can, Lord. And to if we're privileged in our heart, then we know we want to live it just the just yielded to you. And I thank you, Father, for these precious riches. Lord, bless your people of God as they go home tonight and the homes that are listening. Bless the homes with your token in your presence.
