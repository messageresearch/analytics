[0:00] like this lord and with no pretense or
[0:02] no
[0:03] preconceived ideas or we just want to
[0:06] let you have your way and we pray you'll
[0:08] open up the word to us today and lord i
[0:11] pray that if there's a need for
[0:12] encouragement that you'll give
[0:13] encouragement
[0:14] if there's a need for healing in the
[0:17] body i pray that you will administer
[0:20] healing to the body i pray if there's a
[0:22] need in the spirit a spirit has been
[0:24] damaged
[0:25] someone's emotions have been damaged i
[0:27] pray that you'll be their friend and
[0:29] heal them today in their emotions
[0:31] i pray that your word will go forth and
[0:33] as it says here as we the people begin
[0:36] to cry lord we our christ go before you
[0:39] and you you hear the cries of the people
[0:41] we're thankful for that lord the deepest
[0:43] cry can be heard by your ears this
[0:47] morning and you have the answer for that
[0:49] cry we thank you father and we commit
[0:52] the service to you now in jesus name
[0:54] amen once you shake hands with somebody
[0:57] and say god bless you before you're
[0:59] seated this morning
[1:12] of all the places that god
[1:15] throughout the bible has come down or
[1:17] has spoken to the people or has moved
[1:20] spoken through a prophet he spoke
[1:22] through many prophets
[1:23] god did many mighty things and we have
[1:26] read those for many years now as i don't
[1:28] know how long you've owned your bible
[1:29] but you can read through the bible and
[1:31] see that god moved in situations he
[1:34] spoke in situations
[1:36] but out of all of those things
[1:38] there are three major
[1:40] moves of god or i'm going to call them
[1:42] three exoduses that happen in the bible
[1:45] times and in our day three exoduses
[1:48] and in those these were what we would
[1:50] call three major exoduses or exodus
[1:54] means deliverance there were three major
[1:56] ones in the bible and exodus means a
[1:59] coming out exodus means a deliverance
[2:02] exodus means that the people are caught
[2:04] in something and there's no way that
[2:06] they can get themselves out it's a major
[2:09] deliverance needed and only god showing
[2:11] up himself can bring deliverance to the
[2:14] people and he did that and and our
[2:17] prophet separated this into three major
[2:21] is the first one i've read the text this
[2:23] morning and the first one was a physical
[2:26] exodus out of pharaoh's bondage in egypt
[2:29] it was a fig
[2:30] physical exodus and that's where we have
[2:32] the first exodus the second exodus was a
[2:35] spiritual exodus out of bondage of the
[2:38] law into grace that second exodus was
[2:42] the time of jesus where god came down
[2:45] through jesus and he was going to
[2:47] deliver a people that was in bondage to
[2:50] the law and bring them to the the to
[2:53] grace can you say amen and that was the
[2:56] second exodus and that's huge because a
[2:58] a spiritual exodus is greater than a
[3:00] physical exodus matter of fact if you
[3:03] have a physical need this morning if you
[3:05] have a fix physical deliverance that you
[3:07] need i can tell you that god could
[3:09] deliver you physically and but but the
[3:12] greatest exodus and deliverance would he
[3:14] deliver you spiritually from the bondage
[3:17] spiritually that's the greatest
[3:19] deliverance and when he went to calvary
[3:21] and rose the third day it was an exodus
[3:23] for the people of god out of law unto
[3:25] grace can you say amen
[3:28] and then when we come to the third
[3:29] exodus which actually is on our day the
[3:32] third exodus i would say had both
[3:35] spiritual and physical deliverance
[3:38] because he not only delivers us
[3:39] spiritually out of the bondage of this
[3:42] satan's eden and of religious education
[3:45] and of the education of the world and a
[3:47] crumbling the crumbling world systems
[3:49] that we're living in the middle of now
[3:51] and also delivering us from the complete
[3:54] insanity and perversion in the world
[3:57] that we live in this final third exodus
[4:00] is a spiritual deliverance can you say
[4:03] man but thank god it's also a physical
[4:06] deliverance out of this inner rapture to
[4:09] a millennium someday
[4:11] this exodus i want to be a part of can
[4:14] you say amen this exodus is an important
[4:17] one just like the first one was the
[4:19] important one the second one was an
[4:20] important one but this one is both a
[4:22] spiritual and a physical deliverance out
[4:26] of the conditions that we're in to
[4:29] freedom
[4:32] we're living in the third exodus
[4:35] and if incidentally every exodus god did
[4:38] his order for it was the same way he
[4:41] ordered things this is going to be my
[4:43] answer this is going to be my
[4:45] deliverance this is how i'm going to do
[4:47] it and he didn't change his order in
[4:49] each one of the exoduses it's the same
[4:51] pattern if you want to look to see the
[4:53] way he will do it today you look back in
[4:55] the time of moses and he's going to do
[4:57] it exactly the same way that god doesn't
[5:00] change his ways and in three exoduses
[5:02] he's definitely going to do it the same
[5:04] way as he did it before but think about
[5:07] what i said this exodus is out of the
[5:09] bondage of satan's eden of religious
[5:12] education and creeds and dogmas and
[5:14] denominations and things that have
[5:16] twisted up god that's the deliverance we
[5:19] need and it's also a physical exodus out
[5:22] of the bondage of this satan's eden this
[5:24] crumbling world of systems that are
[5:26] falling apart and the complete insanity
[5:30] of the world and perversion of this
[5:32] world there will be no answer for this
[5:35] getting out of this perversion except
[5:38] god's answer it'll be his exodus it'll
[5:41] be his deliverance if we ever get out of
[5:44] this it'll be because god provided a way
[5:47] to get out
[5:49] and how arrogant man is to think that he
[5:52] can come up with those own answers
[5:55] how arrogant is our governments and our
[5:57] presidents and our our senators and all
[6:00] of them trying their best to find an
[6:02] answers to the problems around the world
[6:04] and won't look to the word of god that
[6:06] what god did back in egypt he's going to
[6:08] do the same thing again our deliverance
[6:11] will come through the word of god
[6:13] starting through a prophet can you say
[6:14] amen and there will be a voice that goes
[6:16] out and that voice will be our answer to
[6:19] get out of this world
[6:22] praise the lord now in each of these
[6:24] exoduses
[6:26] there was quite a few years that went
[6:28] without a visitation from god
[6:31] at least in the form of a major
[6:32] visitation where he came down himself in
[6:35] a major way
[6:37] it was 400 years that they were in
[6:39] bondage excuse me a little bit of coffin
[6:41] sickness and yesterday
[6:44] yesterday i woke up
[6:45] and uh
[6:46] something real strange happened to me
[6:48] there as i was waking up a couple of um
[6:51] the room was spinning and such and i
[6:53] think it's just from the sinus issue
[6:56] and uh so i just you know
[6:58] have been feeling better ever since and
[7:00] i just been rebuking that thing and i've
[7:02] come i'm here this morning to give the
[7:04] devil a black eye i'm going to preach
[7:06] amen
[7:07] so now it was 400 years
[7:10] 400 years that the people of israel were
[7:12] in bondage in egypt so there's a period
[7:14] of time even though god heard the cries
[7:17] there was a period of time where he
[7:18] finally moved in on the situation
[7:22] incidentally and i never knew this but
[7:23] it was about 400 years about the same
[7:27] time from the last prophet in the old
[7:29] testament malachi to the time of the
[7:31] second exodus of jesus coming it was
[7:34] about 400 years
[7:36] it actually as we if we place that in
[7:38] the church ages around the same time
[7:41] that it took now from the time of the
[7:43] dark ages of the churches back in in
[7:46] thyatira and those church ages before
[7:49] and next sunday brother uh i think it's
[7:51] next sunday where brother rap continues
[7:53] to study on the church ages in the class
[7:55] at 10 30 here if you want to try to be
[7:58] here early wonderful study on the church
[8:00] ages that he's doing he'll start that
[8:02] again next sunday morning but we find
[8:04] that it was actually from the dark ages
[8:06] to 1963
[8:09] from the dark ages stopping and the
[8:10] reformation beginning that was actually
[8:12] a time of about 400 years as well so we
[8:15] see even in the years it's a pattern
[8:18] that god's people come into a real dark
[8:21] time of bondage real dark situation and
[8:24] after so many years god stepped in and
[8:28] began to move on the scene and said i
[8:30] have heard the cries of my people and i
[8:34] am come down to deliver them
[8:37] he's still that god this morning friends
[8:40] he's still that god this morning but the
[8:42] trouble we get is how god is going to do
[8:45] it and we have to be submissive and look
[8:47] at god doesn't change his ways he does
[8:50] it in the same way the world keeps
[8:52] ignoring that god's gonna deliver his
[8:54] people the same way he did before
[8:56] and here he comes at the end now the end
[8:59] time and in all those years of 400 years
[9:03] things begin to mount up things begin to
[9:05] climax and things begin to get to a
[9:08] certain point in so many ways there's so
[9:10] much bondage that the people are under
[9:13] and i personally believe today it's not
[9:15] physical bondage we're not physically
[9:17] bound by anything it's spiritual bound
[9:19] bondage it's emotional bondage
[9:23] it's mental bondage
[9:25] it's a mental battle today
[9:28] can i get some more amens
[9:31] it's more of a mental battle than
[9:33] someone being in jail now overseas our
[9:35] brother from laos he's in jail that
[9:37] doesn't happen a lot here it's coming
[9:39] someday but he's in jail for preaching
[9:41] the gospel but i find in america and in
[9:44] these lands we're not going to jail
[9:46] being in bondage from the government yet
[9:48] but we are under a spiritual warfare
[9:51] that is bringing even sometimes
[9:53] christians under a bondage in their mind
[9:57] a bondage in their spirit
[10:01] and they are underneath things that they
[10:03] have never our children our young people
[10:06] are underneath spirits and bondage and
[10:08] emotional things that they've never been
[10:10] under before and can't even make heads
[10:12] or tails of why it's happening or what's
[10:15] going on they can't figure it out can
[10:17] you say a match and it is it is
[10:20] in other words when someone comes to
[10:22] that state there they begin to cry for
[10:24] an answer and look for an answer because
[10:26] but but it's so dark that they begin to
[10:28] believe there's not an answer for this i
[10:30] will always be this way i might as well
[10:33] just finish it off or whatever they the
[10:36] the spirits start to talk to them and
[10:37] say i there's no answer for this there's
[10:40] no answer so i i don't know what to do
[10:42] we've tried everything there's no answer
[10:44] for this but in israel's bondage in
[10:47] egypt god had an answer
[10:50] god had an answer to the cries of their
[10:53] heart god had the answer for the bondage
[10:56] they were feeling
[10:58] don't you ever lose hope that god has an
[11:01] answer for you
[11:04] we serve a god of deliverance we serve a
[11:06] god who has the answer we serve a god
[11:09] that no matter what kind of bondage it
[11:11] is god has the answer this morning
[11:14] god wants to deliver you
[11:16] god wants to hear
[11:18] and address and respond
[11:21] to your cries
[11:24] why are we even here preaching if we
[11:26] didn't believe god is still the same way
[11:29] why do we have this building why do i
[11:30] preach why why do we give these efforts
[11:32] why do because we believe there's the
[11:34] god of moses is still alive today the
[11:36] god of william branham is still alive
[11:38] today the god of paul can you say amen
[11:41] is still alive and we need more we need
[11:44] deliverance this morning more even than
[11:47] the children of israel
[11:55] we not only need this deliverance from
[11:58] think temporal things here
[12:00] but we need to get out of here
[12:03] i don't know if anybody's feeling the
[12:05] same thing
[12:06] but when i read this scripture friday
[12:08] night when he read it i could i have
[12:11] been feeling lately i have been feeling
[12:13] deeply just deeply moved
[12:16] by the state that this world is in
[12:19] i'm losing friends
[12:21] through covet i'm using we're losing
[12:23] warriors of the faith
[12:25] if this doesn't affect us may god may
[12:28] you just say lord make me broken so this
[12:30] will affect me if you're just cold
[12:32] towards this listen friends things are
[12:34] happening
[12:35] things are changing in this world and
[12:38] the only reason that maybe you're not
[12:39] moved yet is it hasn't come to your
[12:41] front door yet but where we're at now
[12:44] with afghanistan with with so many other
[12:46] situations taking place and the changes
[12:48] that's going on it won't be long where
[12:51] it's going to come to our door and
[12:52] affect us in whatever way it does but we
[12:55] will be affected
[12:58] and if you're a believer it will
[13:00] increase the cry of your heart
[13:03] that lord
[13:05] send us deliverance
[13:08] that it gets to the end of the book of
[13:10] revelations and he says i will come
[13:12] quickly and john responds who's the type
[13:14] of the bride says even so come quickly
[13:17] lord jesus come quickly lord jesus
[13:22] the only reason that you wouldn't feel
[13:24] that deep cry is maybe you're too bound
[13:27] to your possessions
[13:29] and life is still too convenient
[13:32] and you're just still having you have
[13:34] inconveniences sometimes that frustrate
[13:36] you but there's no cry yet
[13:41] well now i'm not preaching just nominal
[13:43] christians here i'm preaching to
[13:44] believers yet
[13:45] is there a deep cry in your heart
[13:48] lord deliver us
[13:50] or is life too comfortable
[13:53] see you're just inconvenienced when the
[13:55] covet thing came along when
[13:58] the the the atmosphere changes we're
[14:00] still pretty good economically in this
[14:02] nation
[14:03] but all that may change
[14:05] so you're just inconvenienced and so you
[14:08] may not have reached out to god but
[14:10] there's times coming will increase the
[14:12] cry of the heart
[14:16] where we have nothing else to depend on
[14:18] for our families
[14:20] except god
[14:30] may lord may the lord just use
[14:32] and anoint our words this morning
[14:36] and so the bondage climaxed to a certain
[14:40] point
[14:42] and god's people were living in the
[14:43] middle of all that going on in egypt
[14:47] and when it climaxed then them god's
[14:50] people were living in the middle of it
[14:52] and god's people began to cry out for
[14:55] deliverance because god had promised
[14:56] them but you see many years for many
[14:59] years they held the promise but there
[15:01] was no cry
[15:06] see i believe
[15:07] that it's not just that we believe the
[15:09] promise that we will be delivered i
[15:12] believe it's not just that we believe
[15:14] there will be a rapture
[15:16] but i believe there'll be a cry
[15:19] increase in our hearts
[15:22] because it's when the cries increased
[15:24] that's when god said i'm hearing i'm
[15:27] hearing and now i'm come down to deliver
[15:31] oh come quickly lord jesus
[15:34] so that's the question this morning and
[15:35] maybe a convicting question for every
[15:37] one of us i had to examine my myself how
[15:40] i've been preaching on lord moved me
[15:42] with compassion for the lost because of
[15:44] the times but lord how increased is my
[15:46] cry how comfortable am i in am i here
[15:50] and how high is my cry lord you maybe
[15:52] have some things that you're going to
[15:53] allow down the road to increase the
[15:55] cries but i say lord do it to me now
[15:58] increase the cries in my heart lord let
[16:00] me cry for the right things you know
[16:02] people cry about and i was talking about
[16:04] jonah he was crying over the crazy plant
[16:07] that was dying and his priorities were
[16:09] all messed up you remember i preached on
[16:10] that god don't help me cry over some
[16:13] plant that's dying but lord let me cry
[16:15] over souls that will be lost
[16:17] my family members can you say amen
[16:21] we cry over the wrong things sometimes
[16:23] but may god direct us that we're really
[16:25] crying out for his not just his promise
[16:28] but to see his promise manifested in our
[16:30] lives
[16:32] i hope message people are listening
[16:34] because we i believe that god has
[16:36] blessed us with the promises we hold the
[16:37] promises can you say amen we hold the
[16:39] promise of the rapture we hold the
[16:41] promise of these things they're not just
[16:43] stories in the bible they're not just
[16:44] something that lays there but there's
[16:45] something more to us but it can't be
[16:48] just a promise the cry has to rise in
[16:50] her heart lord come quickly
[16:55] amen
[16:56] how many would admit that we've had
[16:57] enough things in your life happened the
[16:59] last five years that has increased your
[17:01] cry
[17:03] praise the lord
[17:04] it's funny to say praise the lord to
[17:06] that
[17:07] but it could end up a very good thing in
[17:10] the end
[17:12] he said i never dreamed this would
[17:13] happen i never dreamed this was going to
[17:15] happen in my life and i didn't plan
[17:17] things that that happened this way and
[17:20] lord why me and and all these other
[17:22] things and why have you forsaken me and
[17:24] and all these other things but could it
[17:25] be could it be that it was to increase
[17:28] your desire and your hunger and your cry
[17:30] for the lord to be closer to him
[17:34] could it be to increase the cry to bring
[17:36] the promise of the rapture to past
[17:38] could it be god's allowed these things
[17:40] and increases all this bondage increases
[17:43] that we cry out for deliverance
[17:47] praise the lord
[17:48] so
[17:49] notice the words that are the people are
[17:52] under and i want you to notice these
[17:53] things and
[17:54] in egypt
[17:56] there was bondage under pharaoh and the
[17:58] bondage created and here's the words
[18:00] that were in the bible you just read
[18:02] groaning
[18:03] affliction
[18:05] sorrows
[18:06] oppression
[18:08] and cries
[18:10] that's all the words and god mentions
[18:12] all of them
[18:14] god named all of them to show you
[18:19] he knew
[18:21] that there was oppression going on
[18:25] he named them all
[18:27] bondage the cries of your heart
[18:30] oppression your sufferings he's letting
[18:33] you know
[18:34] i know what they are and i see you going
[18:36] through that
[18:38] i'm naming them
[18:40] aren't you glad to know and our brother
[18:41] said it the other day aren't you glad
[18:43] you know god's got it covered god knows
[18:45] all these things that are going on god
[18:47] knows your depression god knows your
[18:49] oppression god knows you're suffering
[18:52] god knows what you go there god knows
[18:54] your questions because the israelites
[18:56] had questions where's my god where's god
[18:58] in all this after all these years i've
[19:00] been doing this but where's god at they
[19:02] had questions in their heart and god
[19:04] said i know about all of these things i
[19:08] know about your suffering
[19:12] and i am come down
[19:14] to address
[19:16] these things in other words i want you
[19:18] if you don't get nothing else today when
[19:20] god came on the scene and did what he
[19:22] did through the prophet and then later
[19:24] on as they begin to come into the
[19:26] deliverance and leave egypt
[19:28] god i want i want you to know
[19:31] god
[19:32] god's answer
[19:34] was the answer to all of these
[19:37] sufferings
[19:40] the bondage
[19:42] the cries
[19:43] the suffering the oppression
[19:46] the mental battles
[19:48] god said
[19:50] i've got it covered
[19:53] i've got a deliverance in mind for you
[19:56] aren't you glad
[19:57] there isn't anything that i'm not aware
[19:59] of and also don't run to everyone else
[20:03] for the answer
[20:05] i have the answer
[20:08] and if i don't get time to get into it
[20:10] today i'll just tell you it was in that
[20:12] voice it was in that voice
[20:14] and some people think it was the voice
[20:16] of moses no
[20:18] moses it was only his vocal cords that
[20:20] god was using but it was a much greater
[20:22] voice there than moses
[20:26] it was the voice of the lord that from
[20:28] that point come into the land
[20:30] and then god said i'll even give the
[20:32] people signs because some of them are
[20:33] going to doubt whether this prophet is
[20:35] true or not i'll give them vindication
[20:37] i'll send the pillar fire over them and
[20:39] it'll have its picture taken i'll have
[20:41] them bleeding by a pillar fire i'll show
[20:43] them i'll come in a bill of fires or i'm
[20:45] with my prophet i'm not with all the
[20:47] other ones i'm with moses i'll give him
[20:49] vindication i'll give him two signs a
[20:51] sign he'll put his hand in his bosom
[20:52] it'll be leprosy puts it back i'll throw
[20:54] his staff down i'll give you signs but
[20:57] listen the sign has only convinced you
[20:59] of vindication it's not the sign that
[21:01] will deliver you it's the voice in the
[21:04] sign
[21:04] my voice is in the land my voice i'm
[21:07] here not the voice of moses the voice of
[21:10] god in moses
[21:12] and if you obey and follow that voice it
[21:16] is the answer
[21:18] glory be to god
[21:20] it is the answer for your deliverance
[21:23] you see people can't tie it together
[21:25] because they got their oppression
[21:26] they've got their problem they got their
[21:28] suffering but he's tying together his
[21:30] visitation and his voice he's tying it
[21:32] together for your deliverance from all
[21:34] those things
[21:35] questions for the paul that i don't
[21:37] understand it's been 20 years and i
[21:39] still understand why this happened in
[21:41] this church 20 years ago i don't
[21:43] understand how that preacher acted this
[21:45] way i don't understand why my family has
[21:47] treated me this way i don't understand
[21:49] what's going on in this marriage
[21:51] whatever it is i i can't make hesitation
[21:53] but god does not want you to stay there
[21:56] bound by that thing
[22:01] hear his voice trust his voice
[22:04] his voice is in the land
[22:06] and if you think that the voice was just
[22:08] in the prophet of the today and that's
[22:11] it then your voice is gone
[22:15] wasn't the voice of william branham
[22:18] the voice of god that's come in the land
[22:23] i'm
[22:24] i'm a vocal cord for his voice
[22:27] in this service this morning
[22:29] and when his voice is in the land
[22:31] it is
[22:32] our deliverance
[22:34] it's your deliverance from anything
[22:37] religious bondage pride
[22:40] suffering depression
[22:42] it's not in me
[22:44] but he's got something here
[22:47] that is the answer now remember it took
[22:50] a while for the deliverance to take
[22:52] place
[22:54] right
[22:55] so we can't be impatient we got to know
[22:57] that he's got the answer for us here but
[22:59] it took a while
[23:01] for it to manifest can you say man the
[23:04] first day
[23:05] that god says that there you read around
[23:07] the story and he actually told moses and
[23:09] the elders he said when you go to
[23:10] pharaoh first time he's not going to
[23:12] listen to you he's not going to give in
[23:13] just by you saying it that's why he gave
[23:15] the signs and then there was 10 plagues
[23:18] as soon as the voice of the lord spoke
[23:20] judgment fell on egypt
[23:22] as soon as moses began to speak
[23:25] i like what the brother said brother
[23:26] timothy friday night i could preach on
[23:28] this boy but he did such excellent job
[23:31] as soon as the voice was spoken
[23:33] pharaoh's days was numbered
[23:37] can you say man didn't that and then
[23:38] what he said brother jim
[23:40] as soon as the voice went out pharaoh
[23:43] and egypt's days were numbered it was as
[23:46] good as done but it took a while to
[23:48] happen but because the voice was there
[23:51] judgment came on the whole egyptian
[23:52] thing
[23:54] judgment came on pharaoh
[23:56] you let my people go that's it you're
[23:58] going to let them go and so now he knew
[24:00] there would have to be plagues so he
[24:01] began to send plagues on the earth even
[24:03] while the children of israel were
[24:04] sitting in
[24:06] bondage in egypt
[24:08] they sat and watched and there was a
[24:10] preacher here the other day i don't know
[24:11] who mentioned it i can't remember we've
[24:12] had a few in but i thought it was
[24:14] awesome he said the preacher said israel
[24:16] watched all the plagues and none of it
[24:18] affected them they watched as the frogs
[24:20] came they watched in goshen they were
[24:21] safe right so they watched and they're
[24:23] watching on the news they're watching
[24:27] fox news hopefully or
[24:29] newsmax
[24:30] and they're watching all these plagues
[24:32] fall around them and all this happening
[24:34] in the world
[24:37] and they're and it's not affecting them
[24:40] but this brother said the other night i
[24:41] can't remember if it's brother rich or
[24:43] windsor who was
[24:44] but he said all nine plagues didn't
[24:47] affect them but the tenth one
[24:49] came to their home
[24:54] oh i wish i had an hour to preach about
[24:55] it
[24:56] the tenth one
[24:58] the death angel was not only going to
[25:00] the egyptians but visiting the jews
[25:02] homes
[25:04] and every firstborn would die in other
[25:06] words i want you to listen now there is
[25:08] a plague
[25:10] deeper than just the plagues of covid
[25:12] and all these other things that are
[25:13] going on there there's a plague of
[25:15] spiritual death and it's not good enough
[25:18] to kill people spiritual out there it's
[25:20] coming for your teenager it's coming for
[25:23] your firstborn it's coming to invade
[25:25] your home
[25:29] just like sodom knocking on the door to
[25:30] come in lots home this spirit this
[25:33] plague they could not be exempt from it
[25:36] was going to attack and come for to
[25:38] bring spiritual death in that home you
[25:40] know why i can talk about this so freely
[25:41] because i experience this almost every
[25:43] day the attack of the enemy to try to
[25:46] attack my family relationship with my
[25:49] family my relationship with the lord to
[25:51] get into my home and to bring spiritual
[25:54] death instead of revival i fight against
[25:56] it all the time
[25:58] i get low kind of lollied or leg back
[26:01] into some kind of thing and i have to
[26:03] stand up and say wait a minute satan has
[26:05] taken over for some religion but this
[26:08] isn't a religion this is the mighty god
[26:09] i want to have a revival in my soul
[26:11] every day i want to pray when there
[26:13] needs to be praying i want to be on my
[26:15] knees i want to pray with my children if
[26:16] they're sick i want to pray if they need
[26:18] the holy ghost can you say mine and if i
[26:20] don't do that this this death in the
[26:23] land is not just to the egyptians it's
[26:26] trying to come in our homes as well
[26:30] but god gave brother brahma says there
[26:32] was three things in this exodus same
[26:33] today he gave a prophet he vindicated
[26:36] that prophet with a pillar of fire and
[26:38] then he sent a token
[26:41] we have the same thing
[26:44] under this third accident we have we
[26:46] have had the same thing
[26:47] and they put that
[26:50] red blood from the sacrifice
[26:53] bring the lamb into your house
[26:56] bring the lamb into your own house it
[27:00] was no longer
[27:02] at the church the
[27:04] synagogue had to be brought in your home
[27:08] the token the presence of the lord the
[27:11] holy ghost whatever you want to call it
[27:13] you have to bring it into your life
[27:16] it has to become a life
[27:20] and it was put
[27:22] on the home on the doorpost of the home
[27:25] so that when the death angel came
[27:28] let the death angel pass
[27:30] were safe at last
[27:34] so when the voice of the lord spoke then
[27:37] all of these things begin to happen in
[27:39] egypt
[27:40] but god
[27:42] was addressing
[27:44] the sorrows the oppression and the cries
[27:47] of the people and the answer would be
[27:49] in the voice can you say amen
[27:58] i skipped some of this
[28:01] i believe we're in a place in the world
[28:03] in the state of the world right now
[28:04] we're at a tipping point
[28:07] and i believe that the state that we're
[28:09] in
[28:10] it will not go back to a normal state
[28:12] and some of the things that are
[28:13] happening around the world it won't go
[28:15] back to a normal state as much as we
[28:16] want it to
[28:19] the things that are happening right now
[28:20] are the type of things that will bring
[28:22] greater pressures
[28:24] and then soon hit our doors and be
[28:26] affecting us
[28:27] i wish
[28:29] i wish if i was a prophet this morning i
[28:31] could be specific about how that will
[28:33] all play out but i wouldn't dare try to
[28:35] interpret it
[28:37] but we have enough holy ghost
[28:38] discernment to know when these
[28:40] situations get in these places then the
[28:43] next step is not to go back to a normal
[28:45] state it'll be an increased pressure and
[28:47] come to our door as well
[28:50] because if i can articulate it might
[28:52] shake some of you up more
[28:54] to have a greater cry in your heart for
[28:55] more of god
[28:57] i would love that but i'm not going to
[28:58] mechanically do it i'm going to ask you
[29:00] to trust the holy spirit this morning
[29:02] that you would in this service by saying
[29:04] god
[29:06] let me not be tied to this world in any
[29:10] way
[29:12] increase
[29:13] my cry
[29:14] for our deliverance
[29:20] and so
[29:21] when he mentioned the word cry and we
[29:23] read it in the scripture here i
[29:25] you know crying is more than weeping
[29:29] i believe when he says i heard the cries
[29:30] of the people it wasn't just there was
[29:32] tears
[29:33] people can cry sometimes in tears and
[29:35] it's fine
[29:36] but when i speak of the word cry it's
[29:38] something deeper that's in the heart
[29:42] it's something that rises up that's an
[29:44] inner craving it's an inner burden and
[29:47] i've been feeling this and not even able
[29:49] to articulate it and it's just something
[29:52] that that's crying out within us it may
[29:54] not even be a verbal cry but it's
[29:56] something within us that's a that's a an
[29:59] earnest cry in our hearts for something
[30:03] i remember my when i lived in slovenia
[30:05] there was a neighbor boy i told you the
[30:07] testimony and he's a just a little uh
[30:09] child there that had went over to the
[30:11] neighbor's pool and drowned in the
[30:13] neighbor's pool
[30:14] and uh the grandmother lived there and
[30:16] and and so they were friends of ours and
[30:19] so
[30:21] i remember sitting in my living room
[30:23] and
[30:24] i heard some commotion next door and
[30:26] they already had the emergency out and
[30:28] they were trying to revive the boy but
[30:30] one of the things that got my attention
[30:31] to get up and go over and see what was
[30:33] going on was this blood curdling cry
[30:36] from a man you know usually it's the
[30:38] women that do more of the screaming and
[30:40] crying which but but this was a man
[30:43] and and he was this cry got my attention
[30:46] it was a cry and it started just just it
[30:49] was deeper than just a verbal cry there
[30:53] was something yearning in that man's
[30:55] soul and this was the boy's father and
[30:57] he was over he wasn't even near the boy
[30:59] and when i walked over
[31:00] they asked me to come and pray and and
[31:03] the the the father was over there he was
[31:06] in the neighbor's yard he was way
[31:07] further away but you could hear us cry
[31:09] all over the neighborhood he was wailing
[31:11] before god and crying for mercy from god
[31:14] and the boy they were they were working
[31:16] on him the emergency and trying it i
[31:18] just standed off and prayed because the
[31:19] neighbor lady asked me to do it and they
[31:21] worked on work kept going and he was
[31:23] just but it was just something i'll
[31:24] never forget so that wasn't just
[31:28] a verbal thing there was something in
[31:30] here
[31:32] come to find out later he had already
[31:34] lost a son in an accident and this was
[31:36] the new son and here this boy is laying
[31:38] here nobody knows how long he was in
[31:40] that pool
[31:44] this was a different cry i tell you
[31:46] friends may god put in us a deeper cry
[31:50] not just weeping because we feel bad for
[31:53] what we've done but a a more
[31:55] dispensational looking at the times
[31:57] we're living and look in our position
[31:59] saying god this is too big for me i'm
[32:02] crying for you to give me the
[32:03] deliverance that i need
[32:05] you see people can try to help you from
[32:08] your problems
[32:09] you can help you can try to help
[32:10] somebody and people can try to help you
[32:12] on your problems but really it comes
[32:14] down to you when you get a cry in your
[32:17] heart that you want to change that you
[32:19] want deliverance
[32:20] you have to say lord i need you
[32:22] everybody's trying to help me but there
[32:24] has to be a cry within you to get help
[32:27] please lord help me and when you begin
[32:29] to cry in your heart and cry out to him
[32:31] from the depths i really need help lord
[32:36] that's when god responds to you
[32:39] and he has the answer
[32:41] and the boy
[32:42] was revived they didn't know how long he
[32:45] how long he was there and they took him
[32:47] in i think honey if he was in the
[32:48] hospital a couple weeks that boy is
[32:50] completely normal today
[32:53] not one not one ounce of brain damage
[32:56] nothing is completely normal god healed
[32:58] him completely
[32:59] [Applause]
[33:02] praise god
[33:03] [Applause]
[33:05] the doctor said he was a miracle that he
[33:07] was living he was normal again i give
[33:09] glory to god but i wanted to point out
[33:12] there was something in that man's heart
[33:13] that god heard
[33:15] that was a daddy
[33:18] and it wasn't just feeling bad it wasn't
[33:21] just a bad feeling it was a cry and when
[33:24] our cries get that earnest for god god's
[33:26] going to move god's going to step in
[33:30] is anybody with me here this morning
[33:34] amen so now
[33:36] we utter both verbal christ and enter
[33:38] christ sometimes as israel did no doubt
[33:40] israel was in the bed and there was a
[33:41] lot of verbal crying out to god but it
[33:44] climax and in this satan's eden the
[33:46] combination of religious confusion and
[33:49] the hollywood filth and messing with the
[33:52] minds of the people and all the filth
[33:55] that our young people have had to look
[33:56] at you don't think it messes with the
[33:58] mind it messes with the mind the filth
[34:01] that's in the world brings bondage to a
[34:03] mind
[34:06] to a mind pornography and filth of
[34:09] hollywood's movies in slaves of mind and
[34:13] they are bound by it
[34:17] but god was saying i know of your
[34:19] bondage i know of where the state that
[34:22] you're in and i have an answer for you
[34:28] anyone with the holy ghost is going to
[34:29] be grieving deeply inside over the
[34:31] condition this world is in but let it be
[34:34] known god knew and heard the christ god
[34:36] knew every detail of it can you say amen
[34:38] and i'd say the difference in this
[34:40] exodus and that one is he has come down
[34:42] in the flesh and can be touched by the
[34:45] feeling of our infirmities he knows what
[34:47] it's like because now in this exodus he
[34:51] was here 2000 years ago he came down in
[34:53] a body and the bible says he was tempted
[34:56] in every point as we are
[34:59] now the children of israel were crying
[35:01] out to a god that didn't had never
[35:03] experienced bondage before and so god
[35:05] still delivered them but now in this
[35:07] exodus when you cry out to god about a
[35:10] particular thing god has actually been
[35:12] here in a body and experienced what it's
[35:15] like to have a headache
[35:20] he's experienced what it's like to be
[35:23] tempted by a woman
[35:27] the bible said he was tempted in all
[35:29] points
[35:30] as
[35:31] we are
[35:32] so that he could be a faithful high
[35:34] priest to us
[35:36] and as i was saying to the young people
[35:37] the other night
[35:38] so that when we go to prayer
[35:41] it's not this strange thing that god
[35:43] looks back and say i'm sorry i
[35:46] i've never heard this one before
[35:50] i'm sorry i have never experienced that
[35:53] so i don't know really how it feels
[35:57] you're not talking to a god like that
[36:02] when you go to him about something now
[36:04] because he's been to earth
[36:06] and experienced these things brother
[36:08] bram says he was a baby
[36:11] he does why didn't jesus why didn't god
[36:13] send jesus and he come and come through
[36:15] jesus and go directly from that right to
[36:17] the cross because that's what he came
[36:18] for right he came to be the sacrifice
[36:20] right
[36:21] why didn't he why did he go through all
[36:23] the stages of life because when you go
[36:25] to pray today he's been through it and
[36:28] he knows
[36:29] he was a baby he was a toddler he went
[36:32] through the twozies
[36:35] jesus come on brother paul
[36:38] he might have the terrible twos
[36:42] which my granddaughter is getting
[36:44] way too close to that point
[36:47] you laugh
[36:48] but he was a human being
[36:52] and he went through all the stages and
[36:54] brother bram says he was a teenager so
[36:56] that he can understand what a teenager
[36:58] went through and how a teenager thought
[37:00] and how they process things in their
[37:02] mind and sometimes in their immaturity
[37:04] how they're trying to figure things out
[37:06] and he went through peer pressure and he
[37:08] went through trying to understand these
[37:10] things and in in the identity crisis and
[37:14] all of that you don't think jesus had it
[37:16] sometimes
[37:18] you know his mom's telling him this
[37:19] story and
[37:20] you know he's he and one day he's
[37:22] looking in the mirror and he's trying to
[37:24] figure out who he is and he looks in the
[37:25] mirror like teenagers do for long
[37:27] periods of time
[37:31] jesus is looking in the mirror and he's
[37:32] he's looking at his features and
[37:34] he's you know saying he looks over at
[37:36] his dad and he don't look anything like
[37:39] his dad joseph
[37:41] he looks over at mary and he says you
[37:42] know what i don't look anything like
[37:44] mary either
[37:45] and he's kind of going through an
[37:46] identity crisis like
[37:48] who am i where am i really from
[37:54] comes to his mom
[37:55] mary says well i'll tell you the story
[37:57] again
[37:58] goes to church that sunday
[38:01] the priest starts to read the bible in
[38:03] isaiah
[38:05] and as he reads every sunday
[38:07] jesus finally gets his true identity
[38:10] and i'm not the son
[38:12] i'm not the son of mary and joseph
[38:14] i'm the son of god i found my identity
[38:16] in the word of god
[38:18] he comes through those later teens comes
[38:21] through that didn't start his ministry
[38:22] to his 30 years old but why did he live
[38:25] through that so that when you
[38:26] pray when you pray
[38:29] it's not a god who doesn't understand
[38:33] he can be touched
[38:36] by the feeling
[38:39] of our infirmities
[38:42] he can feel it himself
[38:46] i'm really glad that i can go to a god
[38:48] like that
[38:50] but he has something greater than just
[38:52] staying with the feelings of it he feels
[38:53] the feeling of it
[38:55] but he has the answer
[38:57] he has the
[38:58] deliverance and it may not come for a
[39:01] while but for for the children of israel
[39:03] uh it was on its way as soon as moses
[39:06] started to speak it pharaoh's days were
[39:08] numbered as soon as he began to speak
[39:10] that voice all the wheels were in motion
[39:12] and i personally believe today
[39:14] that that when god sent this prophet in
[39:16] the last days in this third exodus
[39:18] although he's finished his work when god
[39:20] set that in motion the same way he did
[39:22] in the book of exodus and i want you
[39:24] people listening whoever it is listening
[39:26] whether you're in a denomination whether
[39:28] you're in an independent church you you
[39:30] watch the systems and you can't help but
[39:32] admit those systems are failing even in
[39:34] the independent churches because why
[39:36] there's something unraveling people
[39:38] can't get back to the absolute of the
[39:40] word of god and if you can't admit that
[39:42] we need a third exodus we need to get
[39:44] out of here but don't forget god started
[39:47] it through a prophet
[39:49] and i'm going to be very bold to you to
[39:51] say you cannot interpret the word and
[39:53] say he's going to do it something
[39:54] different today we're all going to find
[39:56] and get our deliverance by just coming
[39:58] back to the bible no god has an order
[40:00] god has a pattern and he did it the same
[40:03] way he did it in the first accident he
[40:05] done it in a third he's doing it in the
[40:06] third exit it's the same way can you say
[40:08] amen
[40:10] god doesn't change his pattern and you
[40:12] don't have a right to misinterpret it
[40:13] and make it some other thing for the
[40:15] last days he said and i can give you 5
[40:18] 10 15 scriptures maybe more it shows you
[40:21] there will be a ministry come to launch
[40:23] that restoration to bring us into a
[40:25] rapture
[40:27] it's in the bible
[40:28] don't you dare take that out and ignore
[40:30] and say i don't need a prophet don't you
[40:33] dare do it the scripture says too much
[40:34] about it and if there's an exodus god
[40:37] comes down he says i am come down to
[40:39] deliver my people but i'm sending you
[40:41] with a voice
[40:44] and in that voice
[40:46] he will continue his work he hears the
[40:48] cries of his people he hears their
[40:50] prayers but there's a period of time and
[40:52] then he finally
[40:53] finally steps in i'm not going to be
[40:55] long here i'll finish this up in another
[40:57] service
[40:58] finally god comes and begins to move
[41:02] there comes a point when god moves in
[41:04] and he moves in a big way
[41:06] and he heard them even when they didn't
[41:08] think he was hearing it's kind of like
[41:10] daniel when he went to prayer and
[41:12] fasting for 21 days he didn't hear
[41:14] anything no answer from the lord for 21
[41:17] days and then when the angel finally
[41:19] makes it to get to daniel he says to him
[41:22] i heard you i heard you when you first
[41:25] gave the first utterance out of your
[41:27] mouth i heard your prayer
[41:29] and i headed towards you but the prince
[41:31] of persia held me up i had to fight
[41:34] against demons to get to you but i want
[41:36] to let you know the first time you
[41:38] uttered that cry of your heart i heard
[41:40] you right then
[41:43] see we have to look at it according to
[41:44] the bible because we have cries we have
[41:47] things we request from god we have
[41:49] things and answers we're looking for can
[41:50] you say amen but we have to realize god
[41:53] heard you the first time that you said
[41:55] it
[41:57] so now we wait on the lord to do it his
[41:59] way
[42:00] we wait on the lord to bring his answer
[42:03] his way
[42:04] you know what we do as americans
[42:06] we're going to google it and figure out
[42:07] the answer ourselves
[42:10] that's the way the whole world does it
[42:12] i can figure this out it's like one guy
[42:14] who did a tile job for us said have you
[42:17] ever done this before he says well i can
[42:18] just google it
[42:20] you can learn anything today on youtube
[42:23] we were going
[42:24] and the job ended up kind of turning out
[42:26] that way too
[42:29] everybody's got answers today everybody
[42:31] can go and find all the answers
[42:33] and
[42:34] i just think i'm not against i'm just i
[42:36] think we should be careful
[42:38] of looking for answers everywhere else
[42:40] when the voice of god is in the land
[42:43] and god says it sends his answer you may
[42:46] have to wait a while but you want to
[42:48] take his answer for your problems
[42:52] over your concoctions
[42:54] can i get a greater amen than that
[42:57] you'll want god's answer because that'll
[42:59] be the best answer i need to move i need
[43:01] to do this i need to change careers i
[43:03] need this if a million questions what do
[43:05] i do next i got to make a decision this
[43:07] that and some some decisions have to
[43:09] come up quick unfortunately i don't like
[43:11] those kind of decisions that we don't
[43:12] have time to pray but as as much as you
[43:14] can take the time to pray and say god
[43:17] what is your will in this situation
[43:19] don't be in a hurry about anything
[43:21] some things you're considering some
[43:23] business adventures or whatever it is
[43:25] under this climate of this time in this
[43:27] economic world you better pray and make
[43:30] sure that's the will of god or you could
[43:32] get yourself into a lot of trouble
[43:35] we have a god to go to we have a god of
[43:37] deliverance we have a god who has
[43:41] the answers can you say amen his people
[43:43] were caught in conditions in those
[43:45] conditions and they knew but they knew
[43:47] they were called to something better do
[43:49] you know today that you might be caught
[43:51] in the conditions of this world a little
[43:53] bit but you know you're called to
[43:54] something better
[43:56] the children of israel had to know that
[43:58] my god's going to deliver me someday and
[44:00] i'm called to something better than this
[44:01] bondage i'm not called to be in the
[44:03] middle of this bondage i'm not called to
[44:05] stay here my whole life can you say amen
[44:08] you have a promise the egyptians didn't
[44:10] have that the jews had a promise you
[44:12] need to know that we're sitting in these
[44:14] conditions in the world but you know
[44:16] what i'm not called to stay here the
[44:18] whole time i'm not called for
[44:19] tribulation if you want to stay for
[44:22] tribulation go right ahead but i'm not
[44:24] called to stay here for tribulation i'm
[44:26] not called to be underneath these
[44:28] plagues of tribulation
[44:30] i've got a promise can you say but i've
[44:32] got to deliver that's going to come and
[44:33] get me and hopefully soon
[44:36] the sooner the better
[44:39] the sooner the better
[44:42] every time a leader would change in
[44:43] israel i brought this up at the
[44:44] beginning of the service just give me a
[44:46] couple more minutes here
[44:49] every time a new leader changed the
[44:50] pharaoh they were hoping the leadership
[44:52] would have the answer but it only got
[44:54] worse under biden i mean pharaoh
[45:00] the bible says
[45:02] in the
[45:07] the bible says in the process of time
[45:10] things increased they thought there's a
[45:12] new pharaoh in
[45:15] they thought this will release the
[45:17] bondage but it actually their size went
[45:19] up more and their cries went up more so
[45:21] the the the the leadership changing
[45:24] actually increased the cries of their
[45:26] heart
[45:28] for deliverance
[45:30] i say so be it let it be
[45:33] let it be in the process of time things
[45:35] increase and when they crea increase
[45:37] their cries increase the pressure deepen
[45:40] their cries and that's a good thing
[45:41] because when the cries deepen god moves
[45:44] in when it's more sincere
[45:46] i'd like to say for some people they're
[45:48] feeling an inconvenience sometimes but
[45:50] no cry yet
[45:53] oh somebody say praise the lord amen
[45:57] it's like the song says
[45:59] talking about a man he's not ready he's
[46:00] not he's not on his knees yet
[46:03] he's too strong to be weak
[46:06] he might be coming to church but if
[46:07] there's no brokenness and no breaking of
[46:10] that pride he's not ready yet for god's
[46:12] deliverance because he's not on his
[46:14] knees yet there's no cry of the heart
[46:16] yet
[46:18] he may have been inconvenienced
[46:20] but no cry yet with some people even as
[46:22] message believers it's not a cry yet for
[46:24] deliverance
[46:26] they still have it too easy there's no
[46:28] revival there's no brokenness to get up
[46:31] closer to get up close to god
[46:35] you miss a lot of church
[46:38] because of no real good reason
[46:41] there's not a deep enough cry there yet
[46:45] i love you
[46:46] but i'm gonna tell you the truth
[46:48] if there was a deeper cry you'd make
[46:50] your priorities right
[46:52] this isn't about church attendance
[46:53] nobody's keeping track of church
[46:55] attendance this isn't some denomination
[46:56] that keeps track of that this is based
[46:58] on a hunger and a cry of god
[47:01] and in these times that we're living on
[47:02] what is the priority i need more of god
[47:05] i need the fellowship of god i need the
[47:07] presence of god i need to be around
[47:09] god's people i need to be around this
[47:10] person i need to hear the word of god my
[47:12] children need to hear it my family needs
[47:14] to hear it we need more of the word not
[47:17] less of the word
[47:19] we need more of the cry of god not less
[47:21] of it i need my cry to increase not less
[47:26] my wife woke up this morning she says i
[47:28] don't know i can't wait to get to church
[47:29] she said i don't know how people survive
[47:31] without it in these times i have to get
[47:34] someplace and hear the word of god
[47:37] it's based not upon church i can
[47:39] guarantee you she's not here because
[47:40] she's the pastor's wife even though if
[47:42] she missed a lot you'd probably say well
[47:44] the pastor's wife ought to be here but i
[47:46] know her heart i know her cry she's not
[47:48] here because she's paula fontaine's wife
[47:51] she was going to church way before she
[47:53] met paula fontaine she was on the front
[47:56] row of happy valley way before she met
[47:58] me
[47:59] and she was a singer before she met
[48:01] paula fontaine too
[48:04] people don't know that great singer
[48:05] before she even met me but she was had
[48:07] the cry in her heart by the holy ghost
[48:10] way before she was a pastor's wife
[48:14] she'd be here i'm not trying to build
[48:15] her up there's many but listen pray that
[48:18] the cry of god would increase in your
[48:20] heart
[48:21] god's cries in your heart you can't wait
[48:24] till the doors are open
[48:25] see you made it in your mind that this
[48:27] is something about some type of church
[48:29] attendance record
[48:34] how your daddy and your mommy taught you
[48:35] or something
[48:37] they might have done that but i'm here
[48:39] i'm the new kid on the block
[48:41] and i'm here to tell you this has
[48:43] nothing to do with church attendance
[48:46] nobody's looking at keeping records here
[48:49] nobody
[48:50] this has to do with hunger
[48:52] this has to do with a cry
[48:56] you think the jews missed synagogue
[48:59] in egypt
[49:03] if they missed it was because the
[49:04] government made them stop beating
[49:07] egypt made them stop meeting maybe covet
[49:08] hit
[49:10] they couldn't meet anymore
[49:13] i tell you i'm going to be here when the
[49:14] doors are open
[49:17] until they close the doors
[49:21] when they close the doors and we're not
[49:22] able to then we won't
[49:24] but i want to take this might be my last
[49:27] sunday
[49:28] i'm going to be here until they shut the
[49:30] doors
[49:32] because i'm going to need it
[49:35] i have something down here crying for
[49:37] more
[49:39] i think when it becomes more serious
[49:40] upon the heart of a person you know i
[49:42] was watching the young people the other
[49:43] night so many sincere hearts coming to
[49:46] the altar
[49:48] and i welcome you this morning to
[49:50] speak to the lord
[49:52] come and we'll pray with you
[49:55] but you watch a meeting like that and
[49:56] you know there are sometimes people that
[49:58] get in the flesh it's not sincere they
[50:00] get in the flesh and they're just caught
[50:02] up in the emotion of the camp i know
[50:05] that happens but let's let's not
[50:06] criticize that
[50:08] because in that group there's some
[50:10] sincerity
[50:11] there's a cry of the heart god i need
[50:13] deliverance
[50:14] you see young people can get around that
[50:16] and sometimes they get caught up in the
[50:18] emotion of it and a lot of times they
[50:19] get in the flesh and they're not really
[50:21] getting anything depth of god they're
[50:22] just caught up in the emotion i
[50:24] understand that that's fine but what i
[50:26] was praying is that those are really
[50:27] there's some people that really need
[50:29] help
[50:30] there's some young people in there that
[50:32] i know that need
[50:33] a real
[50:35] filling of the holy ghost with the
[50:37] problems they have in life
[50:40] and when their cries go deep because i
[50:43] was watching and there was one boy there
[50:46] one of our own
[50:48] and i went to pray because i seen first
[50:50] time i seen brokenness
[50:52] weeping crying out to god just quietly
[50:55] just quietly but just something that was
[50:58] much deeper than just the just the
[51:00] shouting or some type of jumping
[51:02] there was something happening for one of
[51:04] our boys
[51:07] the crying went deeper never seen that
[51:09] yet but the but god touched him through
[51:11] the ministry and the cry i need more of
[51:13] god god needs that cry in your heart
[51:19] watch another boy he's getting married
[51:21] next week he's from brother ray's church
[51:22] and getting married you know you think
[51:24] he'd be sitting with his girl and his
[51:25] fiance and thinking about the wedding
[51:27] he's at the altar and there's just
[51:29] there's
[51:30] tears coming down and snot coming out of
[51:33] his nose had to get him a kleenex
[51:36] it's a week before his wedding he's
[51:37] getting married god's blessed them with
[51:38] a lovely wife but i say praise the lord
[51:41] that a man's at the altar like that
[51:44] broken
[51:46] such joy setting before his life and yet
[51:48] god i need you
[51:52] my cries i need you in this marriage
[51:54] i want to be a good leader i want to
[51:56] lead my home correctly
[51:59] when you see depth like that and it's
[52:01] not surface
[52:02] just shallow bubble dances
[52:04] you say
[52:06] that's what we need to see
[52:08] always this may not be a loud service
[52:10] this morning but the holy spirit is here
[52:12] this morning speaking to your heart
[52:14] all you need to do is just respond say
[52:16] lord this is what i need this morning i
[52:18] need my cry to deepen within my heart
[52:22] can we stand together
[52:24] when his voice began
[52:27] pharaoh's days were ended
[52:29] and when his voice began there was
[52:32] deliverance was as good as in the bag it
[52:34] was coming can you say man our
[52:36] deliverance is coming
[52:39] because of the voice of god being in the
[52:41] land
[52:42] and there was a there's a scripture
[52:44] there i don't know if i read it when
[52:45] they i did read it he says when they he
[52:47] says when they begin to hearken unto
[52:49] your voice i want to break down that
[52:51] word arkan because hearken
[52:53] it means to heark it doesn't mean just
[52:55] to to hear something it means to listen
[52:58] it means to step in and it gives
[53:00] attention to it when when they begin to
[53:02] give attention to this voice it will be
[53:05] their deliverance
[53:07] when they stop being distracted when
[53:09] they stop distrusting the prophet when
[53:11] they stop distrusting people and they'll
[53:14] hark and say listen this morning you
[53:15] don't have to necessarily trust me but
[53:17] if the voice of the lord speaking to you
[53:19] i would trust that voice
[53:21] no matter what you've been through i
[53:23] would trust that voice and say god
[53:26] you have a voice of god in the land and
[53:28] it is our only deliverance out of this
[53:30] mess that we're in
[53:33] political systems are crumbling
[53:35] government systems are crumbling
[53:37] nations are crumbling earthquakes are in
[53:40] the land everything jesus said can you
[53:42] say amen earthquakes in divers places
[53:44] men's hearts failing for fear everywhere
[53:47] fear of what fear of covet fear of the
[53:49] plagues fear of new diseases they said
[53:52] there could be up to four thousand
[53:54] variants to this coven
[53:57] did we solve the problem
[54:00] i asked you to listen listen
[54:02] listen do what you have to do but listen
[54:04] don't live by the fear that's in the
[54:07] land put your trust in the lord
[54:10] take all the precautions you feel
[54:12] personally responsible for but you
[54:14] better put your trust in the lord
[54:16] because there's no end to this thing we
[54:17] may be doing this forever
[54:19] 4 000 variants 4 000 different things
[54:22] that breaks off and the politics would
[54:23] love that to keep it going
[54:27] sorry about that i don't want to get
[54:28] political
[54:29] but they're going to use it as much as
[54:31] they can
[54:33] truth is we have a national pandemic
[54:36] right
[54:37] and jesus said jesus said all these
[54:40] things
[54:41] will begin to take place
[54:44] it should really make us convicted in
[54:46] our heart lord
[54:48] i'm crying out to you
[54:52] really need you lord
[54:54] you do it in your own way this morning
[54:55] but as they play softly i want you to
[54:57] speak to the lord i won't tell you what
[54:59] to say
[55:00] you speak to the lord
[55:02] you may have to ask the question lord
[55:04] where am i at this morning where where
[55:06] do i stand but he listed all these
[55:08] things jesus said all these conditions
[55:11] that we would be living in
[55:13] men's hearts failing
[55:16] some almost 200 000 people crossing the
[55:18] border they have another 70 000 to bring
[55:22] from afghanistan and some of them end up
[55:24] here i'm just going how is our economy
[55:26] going to take care of all these people
[55:30] now you have to do it now you got to
[55:31] bring them you have to take care of them
[55:33] children with no parents coming in all
[55:36] this is going to change the dynamic of
[55:37] this country can you say man
[55:41] it's overwhelming so what what who's
[55:43] who's got the answer this god has the
[55:45] answer man doesn't have the answer
[55:48] i think it's a time for us believers to
[55:50] be sober about it this may have been a
[55:52] sobering service for you this morning
[55:54] but i pray the love of god is in it to
[55:55] tell you he's got his eye on the cries
[55:57] of your heart
[55:58] he's got his eye on your oppression your
[56:01] depression
[56:02] your struggle and confusion in your mind
[56:05] god has his care and his eye upon it and
[56:08] he has the answer
[56:10] his voice is in the land
[56:13] let me raise your hand and say
[56:15] i know his voice is in the land
[56:18] if his voice wasn't in the land we
[56:19] wouldn't have any hope
[56:21] and that voice is going to take us to a
[56:24] rapture
[56:25] his voice is in the land he can change
[56:28] us he can deliver us he can deliver you
[56:29] this morning
[56:31] if he can bring us in a rapture he has
[56:33] power to deliver you this morning
[56:36] if you say lord i'm crying out to you
[56:39] if you're saying lord
[56:41] i need you
[56:45] [Music]
[56:56] i come
[57:00] to
[57:04] we're gonna pray you can come to the
