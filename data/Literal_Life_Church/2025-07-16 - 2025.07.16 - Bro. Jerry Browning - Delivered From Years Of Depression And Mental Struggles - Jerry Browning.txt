TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Praise the Lord everybody. It's good to gather with you again here. And uh tonight we wanted to sit and chat a little bit and fellowship a little bit with our brother Jerry Browning. He's with us and it's a guest here at our church. And when he called me the other day to come through, uh he shared with me a little bit of uh his testimony, what's been going on in his life here the last um 12, 13 years. And I felt it was important just to sit with him and ask him some questions about it. And uh I believe it will be a real blessing to you tonight uh just to ponder. He shared some of it in our service tonight and we appreciated the wonderful service tonight as well. But uh we welcome you and brother uh Jerry has served uh 26 years I think he said as a pastor there in Dixon, Tennessee and served five years in Desert Storm in the military. And so uh he's a warrior in several ways. But uh you're going to find out tonight that I believe he's a warrior against the enemy and what he has overcome and what he has got the victory over. And I'm going to let him share that in in talking about these things. I just like to lay a little foundation in the scripture, brother Jerry. Um you know, you mentioned a couple scriptures tonight. I was going to mention them as well. Scriptures that we know, but they're promises of God. I think the one in the Old Testament is, "I am the Lord God that health all of thy diseases." And I wrote down one today, Mark 1:34, uh, he healed all manner of disease and all sickness of divers diseases. So, I'd like everybody to hold that thought that when it's the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ, it doesn't just cover just certain physical things, but uh, he covers all the healing. There's another one in the Old Testament that says, um, I sought the Lord and he delivered me from all of my fears. And that would be specific for tonight because we want to talk about depression. We want to talk about anxiety, mental illness, and a lot of that is rooted in fear. And of course, a lot of it is rooted what Satan tries to bring. And uh so we want to talk about those things. Then when we move, of course, to the New Testament, we see Jesus going forth and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness and casting out all manner of devils. And then that was even before the atonement. That was before the atonement. So then he goes to Calvary and pays the price and he pays the price for our sin but also he leaves us an atonement. I just want to lay a foundation here that that atonement is a full atonement is it's not just that he took stripes upon his back for physical healing but for all of our healing. And that's what you said even in the service tonight is that there's nothing that the Lord has not covered. There's nothing that the Lord has not blessed us with to believe for to be healed because the atonement has certainly covered all of it. And so we're thankful to God for an atonement that covers it all. There's no limitations on the atonement that Jesus Christ has provided for us. And uh God has God knew that he had to provide for all manner of diseases, but all the things including 20th century 21st century problems and issues. God knew that ahead of time. and he paid the price and made an atonement for all of that. I say that because when we start to get to the end time, the mental illness and the depression and the and the anxiety and fear seem to be just multiplying isn't even a word for it. It's just it's something bigger. And I was talking to you today at dinner that we know that in Malachi it says the son of man arose with healing in his wings. So when God visits the generation and when he manifests in Jesus Christ and then the then he said the son of man will manifest again at the end time. If he rises again and begins to show himself the son of man ministry then he rises with healing in his wings and that means that the initial uh way that God shows and gets the attention of the people is he shows himself as the supernatural God that he begins to heal all the diseases just like he did in Jesus Christ. So when he come up in the ministry of the son of man, Jesus Christ again in the end time, it come up with healing in his wings. And so in the initial healing campaigns, which we believe brother Brandham was kind of the the spearhead to that, many books say that brother Brandham's ministry was the spearhead to that. And then there was many healing ministries after that. Uh it it struck America. went around the world, a healing campaign, uh many conventions, many tent meetings, thousands upon thousands of people healed. It was just a unique word, a work of God that showed himself alive again in healing. But I was saying to you today that a lot of that seemed to be that we heard about was physical healing. Cancer healed, the dead raised, uh uh all kinds of manner of diseases physically. And we didn't hear a lot about mental things and and depression. Uh I mean, brother Brandon mentioned it a few times in the prayer line and so we know it was there, but I don't believe it is as prevalent as it is today and grown as it is today. And so I wanted to say that that it seems like things God still heals physically, but he wants to heal even deeper uh emotional needs and and physical needs and and uh all all all manner of diseases. is and sometimes we don't look at as mental things or depression as a disease but in God's books it's all the same category it's all what the enemy uses to bring affliction on the human being and when you talk about uh someone struggling in their thoughts and their mind whether from their past or whether from as you're going to talk about tonight some of the different reasons that people can become depressed um whatever it is God covered that and so we see then it's been because of the the mental condition of the of the world. We see that we really are depending more and more on the Lord. We have doctors, we have medicine, but ultimately uh as we'll find in our brother's testimony tonight, we have to depend on the Lord. And when we do, we can have faith that in the atonement he's provided to bring healing as you as we're going to find in his victorious testimony tonight. I just like to say this last point too is that um I feel like when it moved to a lot more of that, it's less talked about. It seems like the the depression, the oppression, and I've haven't even had some preachers that they just kind of ignore that that's happening. Tonight we see from your testimony and being honest with us that uh this can happen to believers too with the Holy Spirit in their lives with a love for God with the Holy Ghost. Uh Satan can strike them too. Uh you said it in the service, I've said it before is that when you're born again, it's your soul that's born again. You got the other twothirds of you that's not born again. And it's the only parts that Satan's left with to to try to destroy, to try to defeat you cuz he can't get to the soul when once you're sealed in by the Holy Ghost. So Satan wres havoc uh on the mind. Brother Brandham preached the greatest battle over fault is the mind and in the mind. And so we see then that I think some people ignore this part. I I would just say it this way. Some people will even go see a doctor or come for prayer for physical healing, but they tend to hide prayer for and maybe even seeing someone to get help for the emotional or the depression or the oppression. So, we talked about that today and so maybe you have, you know, time to get into a little bit of that, but it's a privilege to be here tonight. And I just wanted to read one scripture that's be related that be has become re real to me in these things. As a matter of fact, I've ministered a little bit along these lines the last couple years. Philippians 4 and verse um 6 says, "Be careful for nothing." It says, "Don't be anxious about anything." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And you're nodding because this scripture's probably been very real to you. Don't be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. And here's the promise that goes with it. And the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and your minds through Jesus Christ. In other words, when he says hearts and minds, your minds means your thought life and your hearts means your emotional life. God covered it because he knows the soul's sealed in. But you see then if we'll go to God, he'll give us a piece for our hearts, for our thought life, and for our emotions as well. And he promised he said I'll protect your hearts and your minds which as I said the other twothirds of you is not born again. So he gives us an extra promise here that he would provide strength and peace and deliverance for not just our souls but our hearts and minds as well. So that's something that's really became more and more real to me as I've ministered it. You know, there's one thing diminished, and I've been, of course, every Christian's been through some things. But when you talk to a brother like you who has uh had 12 years of going through something like this, that's quite a long time. And I'm sure you had to cling to promises like this. So, you know, I I I just want I I I just want you to share your heart and share whatever the Lord gives you. You had quite a journey here that you've gone with the Lord. Never giving up, although the enemy is trying to tell you different things. Never giving up from any of that, but carrying on with the Lord until finally seeing it through to a victory over this depression and and all the things that you went through. So maybe just describe from the beginning what started happening when you come into this. What in the beginning kind of what happened? Well, at the beginning when I when it uh first started coming on me, I uh it it's you know I I would I would just had like a cloud of depression on me. Uh and it wasn't because of anything was going on in my life. I actually had some good things going on in my life, you know. Uh I had children getting married. I had grandchildren being born, you know, and and and things. And uh and so there there there was actually a lot of happiness going on around me. &gt;&gt; Wow. Uh but when this started I I began to feel like uh it really started manifesting where I just couldn't get out of bed in the morning. Uh I didn't feel like facing a day and and I didn't the anxiety and the depression and how it was just waiting on me. I thought, well, if I just stay asleep, I don't got to deal with it. &gt;&gt; And a lot of people I've talked to, that's what they do. They try to sleep it off, sleep through it, you know, because you're trying to escape from &gt;&gt; what you feel this is my reality. &gt;&gt; So, you're trying to escape from this reality, &gt;&gt; you know, and if you can get your mind turned off and go to sleep, you don't got to deal with it, &gt;&gt; you know. &gt;&gt; And but you can't live life that way. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. And uh so you know I would uh there was days when everybody else would leave and I'd be home alone and uh I would never even get out of bed &gt;&gt; and uh you know my wife would maybe come home later and and I'd say no but never got up. I never showered. I never done nothing, &gt;&gt; you know. And uh it was just trying when it gets on your sweat, you just try to escape. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh but then uh it just kept progressing, you know. uh to where uh I think the anxiety attacks started getting worse and uh it's it's you you feel like this something bad's going to happen &gt;&gt; and uh and it's not because of anything that has happened or anything that maybe you've witnessed although you know outside things that do happen or outside stressors they actually can add to it you know &gt;&gt; and with like myself when I started going through this &gt;&gt; then uh I uh actually I was the individual who uh a brother within our church. He committed suicide and I was the one who actually just discovered his body. &gt;&gt; Okay. and uh and that and so I on top of this I started suffering from uh post-traumatic stress syndrome &gt;&gt; from from that from seeing that you know &gt;&gt; and uh like I said you know I was uh I was in war and that but this was different because this all seemed out of place &gt;&gt; and uh so you know and I've never ever described to anybody the scene of what I saw and I never will &gt;&gt; uh but it was so horrific that I couldn't couldn't get it out of my mind. And uh so &gt;&gt; and that's what you were saying today is that before that though, you know, everything was going happy, your life was going good. And and I want to just hone down on that point is that you're telling me today is that is that this can strike somebody and you can start feeling depressed and feeling this way and everything seems to be going good in your life. &gt;&gt; Yeah, it well &gt;&gt; and that's the amazing thing. But then when you see somebody after they committed suicide in your church, brother in your church, &gt;&gt; uh then it seemed to take you over the top. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It was like the it was like it just I like I was on the on the edge of a cliff and this pushed me off. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You know, and that but uh you know I I I struggled with it keeping to myself a while I was struggling with. I wouldn't even talk to my wife about it, you know. I wouldn't talk to anybody about it. And then finally, um, I I did told my wife, I got to talk to you about what I'm what's going on. And my oldest daughter, she's a nurse. And so I I asked her to come and, uh, over to the house. And so I sat down with my daughter and my wife and I said, "Look, I I I'm" and I started to describe to them what I was suffering from. And this started in 2011. So then uh the brother and I the brother that committed suicide, it was actually on his wedding day that he did this. Okay. &gt;&gt; Wow. So, uh, then a year later, my youngest son was getting married and, uh, I was, um, at the house, uh, trying to, uh, get ready to go over to have this wedding and this just fear and anxiety just came on me and everything what that experienced from that day all come flooding back. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And uh and I was under so much fear and you know of course the devil's telling me your son's going to kill himself and this is going to happen and that's going to happen you know and it was just it was just such an attack &gt;&gt; and uh and that but so anyway after talking to my wife and my daughter who's a nurse my daughter said you got to go tell your doctor you know uh I I told her I said you know um it and I wasn't struggling with uh you know any past sins or mistakes or whatever I had done. It wasn't that &gt;&gt; you know but it would just I it was such a depression and it wasn't that I was depressed over anything that was had happened. &gt;&gt; All right. uh like I said this all started before that even the suicide had took place. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And uh so uh you know and so then then the anxiety which is a complete different thing cuz that can actually affect you and you can actually start feeling physical things from the anxiety. Uh it can cause you to feel like you can't breathe. uh you can actually feel things which I did at times where it's like uh like somebody had throwed like a 50 pound weight on my chest and was crushing me &gt;&gt; you know and uh and then you just you just feel like it you know and then with all of this you know so I went to the doctor let me say this I went to the doctor and uh after dealing with my primary physician for a while and then some other doctors and that you know and what they told me was they said as I told them I I got great things going on in my life. I don't know why I'm depressed, you know, &gt;&gt; and uh you know, and they said, "Well, it's" and so they began to explain it to me and and the way the best way I can relate to it to to people who don't know anything about mental illnesses and things, uh is that, you know, your your mind, your brain cells, there's certain chemicals that have to be produced in your body in order for your brain cells to to work properly, you know, and uh and and usually what I tell people. I said, you know, if you're familiar with like sugar diabetes, your pancreas has to produce uh insulin insulin, right? to to to regulate the amount of sugar that's in your blood, you know, and you got to have sugar in your blood, otherwise your brain can't function, &gt;&gt; you know, but if your pancreas is not producing the right amount of insulin, then you end up with too much sugar in your blood and people can actually uh can actually go into and have a stroke over it, you know, and uh and and but and then our bodies the other thing sometimes our bodies become what they call as insulin uh resistant, right? So there our body what it all comes down to is there's things in our body it's not functioning right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; And so and you know some people think uh when they hear somebody's got uh some kind of physical illness they always want to say well it's your weight you know. &gt;&gt; Well you know I know skinny people that have sugar diabetes. That has nothing to you know it's yeah it can help if you'll lose weight but uh but that's not really what the cause of it is. It's just that's just making you more insulin resistant. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. I like to hear that story too then. But sometimes we justify say we don't have to exercise now because skinny people get it too. But we still need &gt;&gt; Well, no. I Well, I'll tell you this. I I did start walking, exercising, doing things, you know, watching my diet because uh you know, these these mental things what it is uh your body you're it's supposed to produce certain chemicals. Yeah. And uh I I won't try to name all the scientific terms in that that but uh but there's things like serotonin and different things that has to be produced and it makes your brain cells work right and if these things aren't being produced that's why people can be depressed &gt;&gt; and it's not they're not pressed about anything. &gt;&gt; Okay? You know, so somebody, you know, the greatest uh hindrance to people that maybe uh be afflicted with this is the ignorance of other people, &gt;&gt; you know, because they're ignorant of what it actually is and they'll tell you, "Well, just don't think that way." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; And and it's not about what you're thinking. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; uh, you know, and and when but it is just like any other sickness. It is of the devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's the devil afflicting you with that sickness, you know. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I think I think about in the scripture, you know, you were mentioning that there wasn't a whole lot said maybe about mental illness, but I think about the man who we don't even know his name. &gt;&gt; Uh, everybody knows him by legion. And that wasn't his name. &gt;&gt; Mhm. That was what the demons that had got on him called themselves, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because they said, "We're many, &gt;&gt; right?" &gt;&gt; But the the real thing to draw from that that when when God delivered when Jesus delivered that man and he was healed that the people from the town came and the Bible says they saw him in his right mind, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; and uh and and they didn't know what was going on with him. you know, he he seemed to have this super strength, &gt;&gt; you know, when the demons were on him and things, but he was actually suffering from mental illness, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And and the the scripture testifies that because it says after Jesus cast out those devils, he was there in his right mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So before that, he was really suffering. Yes. You know, he wasn't living up in the tombs and and all this because he didn't want to be with his family. Yeah. you know, uh, brother Brandham actually in some of the messages, he really goes through and describes this man, &gt;&gt; you know, yeah, how, you know, he had a family and and things and he he he he didn't he wanted to be with his family. &gt;&gt; He couldn't function anymore like a normal &gt;&gt; father. So you know it it it's the the enemy just like that he uh comes against us with with uh physical illnesses you know of the body high blood pressure sugar diabetes uh heart disease or cancer or or any of these things you know it's the same thing he does with the mental and and so like I said the hindrance to people I believe uh is that they be is they become ashamed &gt;&gt; and sometimes they're ashamed and they don't want to talk about it because they they'll have even uh members of the ministry that don't understand it and they just want to tell people well you know what it is you just don't have the Holy Ghost you know and the thing about it is brother Brandham actually says a place in the message he says that a demon can come and actually afflict a person in their mind and he says and actually torment them and them actually go completely insane he says but that has nothing to do with their soul and that's what you were saying earlier, you know, that that's that those two outer realms. He can't touch that third realm, that soul. He can't touch that. And that's what brother Brandon was saying there. You know, he can inflict this out of here, even cause a man to mentally go insane. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But that doesn't mean that man doesn't have the Holy Ghost. It doesn't mean it doesn't touch his soul. &gt;&gt; Yeah. you know, so when you went to the doctor, um, breaking off of that point, when you went there, you did receive some knowledge a little bit about what was going on because the devil can beat you up like, oh my god, you first of all, you don't know what's going on if you've never had it. You don't know what's taking place. So, you go to the doctor and you felt a bit relieved to re realize sometimes this is not from the past. Sometimes it's not you don't have any you're not you're not having pressures in life. Of course, you were a pastor. He had some pressures but it w it wasn't really going bad but you learned something from them to realize sometimes chemically in your body something can be being messed with and not you know not working right. So you getting a knowledge of that probably helped a little bit because you said people sometimes it's ignorance sometimes they don't know and uh you know I think the devil really beats on that too. Sometimes when we become aware of what's going on, then we know how to bring it before God, you know, and just say this is what that the doctor says it is and you know, I might be able to help it a little bit and diet or whatever, but at the same time, it's an enemy. It's the devil. And uh you know, I think you get knowledge with that. But go a little further now just in that process of uh you know, just not you're still pastoring. So like the man in the Bible, he couldn't function with a regular family life. He actually pulled away from all that. You started pulling away from even that not being able to I think you said in the service tonight that you're kind of going through the emotion emotions when you were pastoring some because &gt;&gt; I it actually it it uh it started to get to a place to where you know and you know this brother Paul you for you to get a message to preach God's got to give you inspiration. That's right. You know, he's got to inspire you and God will use different things to inspire you. &gt;&gt; But but and so you have to wait for the inspiration before you can sit down and actually it doesn't matter how much you know, how much you've listened to, &gt;&gt; you know, as a believer, you know, God's got to put that spark of inspiration in there and then it all starts coming together where you can actually come and minister a message from it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, and uh what had happened to me was that wasn't happening any longer. M &gt;&gt; I couldn't I couldn't get no inspiration. My my mind uh even with like dealing with my my personal finances or even the church's finances at the time. I I I was sitting there one day and I just started weeping and I told my wife, I said, "I can't even do math. &gt;&gt; It was too overwhelming. &gt;&gt; It's just overwhelming me, you know." Wow. &gt;&gt; So, she started helping me out, you know. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I told her, I says, "This is just I can't take it, you know." And uh so it got to a point to where uh you know and then the anxiety and nerves I just had see I had a plethora of things going on &gt;&gt; and uh so then it you know getting around people made me nervous and then and then you start feeling like cuz it's the devil that starts battling you then with thoughts and you start feeling like a lesser person. you start feeling like something's wrong with you, you know, and so a lot of times you start drawing back from people and sometimes you draw back because you and you feel so alone because you feel like nobody is getting what's happening to me, you know, and sometimes the more they try to, &gt;&gt; you know, you know, there's like a stigma, I believe, in the message that people got this stigma. They they they're so against what they call psychology. And I would never tell somebody that's your answer, right? You know, uh but but the thing is, you know, uh even with all that, then people actually sit down, even preachers that that believe what it all is is this or that, whatever, they don't even realize sometimes they're trying to psychologically talk you out of this, &gt;&gt; you know, and and it doesn't work. You know, you can't use psychology on a devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's right. That's right. And uh and and and the thing about it is this affliction, it doesn't make sense. It it defies reasoning, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; my goodness. &gt;&gt; And uh so I know with even my wife and and that, you know, there was times she would just feel so helpless and frustrated and she'd say, "What can I do to help you?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, and that and and I would just tell her, "I don't know. Just hold my hand." You know, &gt;&gt; wow. And um uh so the more she actually learned about it uh and that then she was actually able and they they told us there's there's little uh uh triggers and different things that will show when somebody's like who's going to have an anxiety attack &gt;&gt; that that my wife began to notice there were certain little actions I would do. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Uh she said I would start to like just rub my temple like this, you know, and I was not even aware I was doing it and she could tell an attack was getting ready to go. going into that mode of an attack. And uh so &gt;&gt; wow &gt;&gt; um you know so then the more she began to understand then she could actually be there with me you know &gt;&gt; and have more understanding &gt;&gt; but she she had that's a thing too is that I remember scripture says my my people God said my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge and and I don't mean worldly knowledge but lack of revelation number one but also when someone chooses to be ignorant they don't want to find out you often I often tell people is that if we find out what it is we can name the devil. We can name what he's trying to do. But if we just want to remain ignorant and sometimes we learn, as your wife learned, what triggers it, what's going on, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Even though the answer is not psychology, uh we get enough to know, okay, I know what's going on now. I can bring it before the Lord. And I'm bringing up that point again is that seems like what's it feel like to have a panic attack? What's it feel like? um you uh it's well it works different for for different individuals I guess the way it might uh come on them but uh you um all of a sudden there's just like this whole feeling of doom that sets down on you know &gt;&gt; and and and you feel like and it does it defies reasoning you feel like something bad is just getting ready to happen to you &gt;&gt; and uh and that and then it it then there'll be actually physical effects that will happen to you. You know, it affects your breathing, it affects your heart rate, affects your blood pressure, &gt;&gt; uh affects all these things. And so when it starts affecting all them, you start physically feeling it then you know when your blood pressure right raises you know because if somebody has high blood pressure uh then you know they can start getting this pounding in the back of their head and things you know if their blood pressure raises too high you know uh if your if your sugar raises too high or if your sugar bottoms out it cause you cause you a fat it'll cause people to sweat. it'll cause them to uh you know uh um get real shaky or something or whatever you know and and they'll eventually they can pass out and and anxiety it kind of works that way you know and it starts affecting these other things in your your body blood pressure and and and different things and that and then your heart will race and it'll pound and then your chest will hurt and then and then sometimes there's and and what I believe is I believe it has to be demons because you'll feel actually like uh uh like I I always felt like a a heavy weight sitting on top of me like like as if you had somebody sitting on your chest. It'd be hard to breathe. &gt;&gt; You know, you can't expand your lungs. &gt;&gt; My my. &gt;&gt; And yet you look and you say there's nothing there. &gt;&gt; But it's still real what you're feeling. And it's still uh you know causing you to to have trouble breathing and things, you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I've heard some people describe a panic attack as kind of also feeling just crowded in and something's coming in you in on you like uh David described in Psalm 27 he said like an enemy encamped around you. I don't know if you ever felt it that way but you feel like something's rushing on you. &gt;&gt; When you start to have attack like that and you're around a lot of people &gt;&gt; that really has a bad effect on you. You want to just get away from everybody. &gt;&gt; Wow. Uh when when I would start to experience this, I would actually go into my bedroom, shut my door away from everybody. &gt;&gt; My &gt;&gt; and and just set to myself. &gt;&gt; And that's a hard thing to do as a pastor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You don't want to be around people, &gt;&gt; you know. And I uh I had brother Phil Bontreger was there with me. And so uh I know there was at least a month or maybe a little longer that he was doing all the preaching. I couldn't even preach, &gt;&gt; you know, and I I got so bad I couldn't even counsel with people. They people needed counseling. They had problems, something they were dealing with, but I was so tore up. I was no good, no use, you know. And of course, Satan then &gt;&gt; attacked me with, you know, with my thoughts through that. &gt;&gt; You know, saying, you know, show me all my uh deficiencies, you know, &gt;&gt; you're failing and that. And so, um, &gt;&gt; my &gt;&gt; I actually, uh, after some time, I thought I I've got to, uh, power through this, you know, like you said, I I served in the military. And of course, the military, they they teach you a lot of mind. They play a lot of mind games and they teach you mind control and things like that. And and and and they have a thing what they call it's mind over matter. You know, you know, no matter what's going on, you just set it in your mind and you're going to be okay. But this what I was going through, it defied all of that. Wow. You know, &gt;&gt; but I did actually uh eventually fall back on some of my my training from the army and said, I'm going to power through this &gt;&gt; to preach &gt;&gt; to preach. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, but my my issue was like I told you, I couldn't get any inspiration. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; And and I I it was like I and I was on some medication. Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We get I wanted to get into that next. And so that actually I I I would tell my wife, I don't feel anointed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; and and I felt like I couldn't feel anything emotionally or anything, you know, no feeling or nothing. I was numb. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, what I would do is then what I did was I just, you know, I'd been I had been preaching for years &gt;&gt; and and studying and had a lot of notes and different things and that. So what I did was uh I just, you know, Satan had me a fearing that I was just inadequate and I was going to lose everything, you know, &gt;&gt; and so what I did was I just went back and and I'm actually embarrassed to tell you, but I went back and I grabbed old notes that I had &gt;&gt; and I would just carry those old notes up to the pullpit. And and sometimes, brother Paul, uh because you know, with with when you get anointed in preaching, you know, you'll have maybe an outline or notes or whatever, but the spirit begins to come and you begin to say things that ain't down there, right? You know, and you couldn't do that and the Holy Spirit bringing things back to your memories. That wouldn't that wasn't happening my you know, so at times it became it was I felt like all I was doing was just reading off those pages. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Well, you showed you're delivered tonight because the way you preached at the church tonight shows it was inspiration for sure as anointed. Let's go. Let's talk a little bit about the medicine thing because you know that's always kind of taboo as well. Uh and I don't want to be critical but sometimes people will go to the doctor, visit the doctor, they'll go for medicines for that uh and physical things, but it's taboo to talk about medicines for something going on in a chemical imbalance or depression and things like that. And my belief on it is that uh anything that helps humanity, anything that's going to help them temporarily. That's, you know, that's a good thing. I always try to counsel people, but don't ever settle that you'll be on that for life. Um I don't think that's of God. I think that we should be believing and get off of that. But you uh you went out you went ahead and take took some medicines for this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, you know, Brother Paul, I uh I know some people believe if you take medicine for anything, it's because you don't have faith. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But but I don't believe that. I don't believe Brother Ben taught that. &gt;&gt; Appreciate you saying that. &gt;&gt; You know, y &gt;&gt; and uh but and I would say this from my own experience, I would do anything I could to help somebody to get healed to not have to be on that medicine. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. because there's so many horrible side effects, &gt;&gt; you know, and uh when somebody is suffering from from a chemical imbalance causing depression, anxiety, you know, one of the things that they deal with you is they know you're going to have suicidal thoughts. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the reason for that is you want to escape from it so bad, &gt;&gt; you know. Yeah. And and some people uh don't feel like there's any escape or way out and and you know they and then they end up they do end up committing suicide which that within itself we know that's a demon too. &gt;&gt; That's right. You know that's right. Y &gt;&gt; and and so u some of the side effects of these medications that are supposed to help you with this. One of the worst side effects is it causes suicidal thoughts. So, but there there's a lot of other side effects to them, you know, &gt;&gt; and uh I won't go into all the different side effects, but it affects you in a lot of physical ways. &gt;&gt; And that's why you didn't like being on it &gt;&gt; and I I didn't like &gt;&gt; How many How many years did you have to take it? How many years you taking? &gt;&gt; Well, you know, I was taking it probably about cuz it was about a year I suffered before I went to the doctor. &gt;&gt; Okay. And so for probably about 11 years uh but and they just as I just kept getting worse they they kept increasing the medications &gt;&gt; and then finally my uh primary care physician she told me she said you've surpassed my knowledge. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. &gt;&gt; She says I don't have any more knowledge in this particular area. She's my area expertise is the physical illnesses. &gt;&gt; Right. And so she she told me, which you know is a real no no for many uh message believers, says, "You're going to have to go to a psychiatrist." Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that they can actually prescribe you the right medications, you know. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; And so uh and and so a psychiatrist, it's not you sitting down and having a talking session with somebody. Yeah. They're they're actually they do talk to you to try to find out what's going on. uh like my my grandson Michael that's here with me. He he went to me with a couple of those appointments as he got older and he was says he told me he said that's a strange doctor said they never check your heart rate. They never do anything. All they do is sit there and talk to you, you know, but they have to ask you questions and you describe things and then they and then they uh they they want ask you questions with the medicines they've give you. Is it they want to know the effects? Mhm. &gt;&gt; And so I actually ended up at a point where they had actually they they I don't even remember how many different ones that I was on. I think maybe four or five different medications. And they had actually gave me the max dosage of every one of them, you know, and uh and and and I'd reached a point where no longer it wasn't even really helping me any longer. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; it's just the time for God to step in and all that. But the medications, they kind of, you know, they they they kind of make you feel numb. And by that, I don't mean that you're sitting around in a stoop or &gt;&gt; I mean it's like you uh something happy happens around you, you can't feel happy, &gt;&gt; you know, it doesn't affect you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, somebody can do something that normally would really upset you and you can't even feel upset, &gt;&gt; right? you know uh and and with that then you realize then uh you I used to tell my brother when my brother we were going places together I'd say I can't even feel excited in the services you know &gt;&gt; and I know we don't depend on emotions but man I still like them &gt;&gt; yeah exactly yeah me too &gt;&gt; I love to feel the you want to feel and that's normal &gt;&gt; and that and &gt;&gt; but it's just interesting the enemy has the depression where you withdraw from people and you withdraw, you know, and and but then you go on the medicines and it numbs you that you can't feel either. So, it's kind of like a double whammy there, you know. &gt;&gt; So, so the medicines &gt;&gt; I uh I talked to my brother a lot because he and I took a couple of trips together. Uh one back in uh 2017 and one in 2019. &gt;&gt; I remember that one to the Phil one to the Philippines, &gt;&gt; two of them were to the Philippines. Y &gt;&gt; and so I got to spend a lot of time with him, just me and him one on- one and talking and uh you know and uh and I was trying to express to him and I kept telling him I hate this stuff. I don't want to be on it, &gt;&gt; you know. &gt;&gt; And uh I went over to the Philippines and I remember brother Roel Soriano and brother Landlan, I don't know if you remember him. Yeah, good friend. So they they both told me they had saw me like 20 years prior to that when I'd went over there and preached and they were like ah you're different now you what what's going on with you preaching and brother Lland actually came over and visited me in Dixon and stayed with me to to visit and talk and he goes what's going on brother Jerry you don't preach the same you're different and so I was telling him this is what's going on &gt;&gt; you know &gt;&gt; and uh but then uh like I said I I did start walking every morning. Okay. And and I started uh uh dieting because you know they say when you when a person's suffering mentally they usually do one of two things. They either quit eating altogether and then they lose they lose unhealthy amount of weight you know or they eat for comfort &gt;&gt; more. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And mine was I ate for comfort. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know. Yeah. So, it was nothing for me to run out to a truck stop that had a a Subway or a McDonald's in the middle of the night and and and and grab food, bring it back, and eat because I thought, well, it was making me feel better, you know. And so, um uh I actually uh &gt;&gt; um I I got up I was way overweight, grossly overweight, you know, I still overweight, but I was really bad. &gt;&gt; And that was affecting me physically, too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So I um I I I started walking. I started uh watching what I was eating. And I was actually getting help uh uh medical guidance from nutritions and things like that. &gt;&gt; And uh and so I actually end up losing 80 lbs. &gt;&gt; And I'm not where I want to be yet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it did really start helping me, you know. &gt;&gt; It's so true. And I might as well be honest with you, too, you know, cuz I have the same struggle sometimes. And I remember two or three years ago, we had something come up in the church and I had lost 20 30 pounds. But when that thing hit the church, I hit a state of be feeling real low and I turned to food. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh you know, that's that's what depression can do. But we're always turning to something to help relieve it. But you know, that's not the answer for sure. What what is the uh let me just ask you this, brother Jerry. Um, was there a certain embarrassment that went with this? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. You you you felt you you did feel like shame and and and and also see because that there there there was individuals you you knew that believed or thought a certain way, you know, that you were associated with that you didn't want them to know what was going on with you. &gt;&gt; Okay? you know, &gt;&gt; and u uh cuz I mean, you had enough of the devil attacking you, telling you you ain't got it, and this is why you're suffering with this and all this, you know, &gt;&gt; and so you wanted to hide it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then you don't know, as I said, it's it's not very talked about. So, you got this fear is that you don't want it out there because you don't know how people are going to label you. You don't know what people are going to say. I mean, I think you get support from real, you know, people that understand, but you might get some criticism. So that's probably another reason why you don't want to tell anybody. But there is a certain embarrassment that goes with it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there there is an embarrassment that goes with it. Uh you don't want anybody to see you going through an attack. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, uh because uh you don't make any sense when you're talking. &gt;&gt; Wow. You know, &gt;&gt; my goodness. &gt;&gt; And uh I remember I was getting ready to I was 53 years old. I'm 62 now. I was 53 years old. And uh all of a sudden this anxiety and fear came on in me because my my grandfather that I grew up so close to, he died at the age of 55. &gt;&gt; And so this anxiety was crushing me. You're getting ready to turn 54. You're going to die. And that doesn't even make good reasonable sense, you know? &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Uh my grandfather, he worked in the coal mines. He had black lungs and and and heart. And uh before he came to the Lord, he drank and he smoked and he so he done all kinds of things that you know was against him. &gt;&gt; Contributed to it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so uh uh and and he actually needed open heart surgery and he refused to have it and then he died from a heart attack not long after that. &gt;&gt; But uh you know here was this whole thing just crushing on me. You're getting ready to turn 54, you're going to die. &gt;&gt; My goodness. you know, &gt;&gt; and uh and so, you know, and and the reason I mention that is because when that hit me, I was with my wife and I was actually outside the house by the driveway and and so I'm out there just blubbering and I'm telling her I'm going to die, you know, &gt;&gt; and she's trying to reason with me and say, "That doesn't even make sense, you know." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that and you so you there is embarrassment. You don't want nobody to see you like that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; and I mentioned tonight when I was preaching that, you know, I got a really good friend down there. in West Tennessee, Brother Boaten. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And I uh I actually would sort of withdraw from everybody. I wouldn't go visit no churches. I wouldn't go anywhere. I did come up to visit uh my folks and and my brother would kind of kind of push me and force me into to speak and you know, and that and uh but I didn't want to go anywhere else. Yeah. you know, and uh other brothers that knew me and had me come and I'd go preach and things like that, they they started asking my brother, "What happened?" Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, where what happened to him? Where is he? You know, &gt;&gt; and uh so uh brother Bomeen, he I didn't call him. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't leave me alone. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He called me. &gt;&gt; That's wonder, &gt;&gt; you know. And so wonderful. &gt;&gt; He he would call me. He would text me. He would uh uh he he would then come and visit me. He'd come and pray for me, you know, and and and but brother Bo never made me feel condemned. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, he and he didn't try to sit down and fix me. &gt;&gt; He wasn't trying to fix you, &gt;&gt; you know. He he would uh he would try to relate from uh things that he had went through and that, you know, &gt;&gt; uh and he would just uh you know, was telling me to have faith and he would pray for me. He'd come preach for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. you know, and uh and one time he came and preached for us and I was really at my lowest and and I was feeling so defeated and and so I like I said tonight, I don't even remember what he preached. I couldn't keep my mind together to even, you know, enjoy what he was preaching. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But um &gt;&gt; but he was a friend that &gt;&gt; I just want to stop on that point. He was a friend that wasn't trying to fix it. And what's amazing about this story is 12 years. I mean this a long time in your life as a pastor and you know we always when we're trying to help somebody as pastor help someone else we always trying to we got to come up with the answer quick. We got to get an answer you know get a quote or get a scripture and it's good to bring the scriptures but it's God's timing when he brings his deliverance. And someone spoke the other night at the at the church uh last week it was brother Brandon our assistant pastor about God in the waiting finding God in the waiting. And so we know there's a difference in miracles and healing and sometimes the healing takes a while. We don't seem to be willing sometimes to wait for that. Trust God. This was a long time for you. And uh you know just &gt;&gt; you know brother Brandham makes a statement about that what you were talking about healing and miracles. And brother Brandham said it takes more faith for divine healing than it does for a miracle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yep. I've read that before. It's it's amazing. But we seem to be anxious and people want to fix it and what can I say? You know even in my counseling how can I get to the bottom of this right away? And sometimes you just need that prayer of faith and that concern and that care and those encouraging words and uh let God bring it in in his own time, you know, and continue to believe that way. So, I know you're getting close to the end there of sharing uh what what happened uh in that service with brother Boen. Um what before you get there, I just want to say I want to ask what did God show you through these 12 years, brother Jerry? And what were the steps then that begin to bring you to your deliverance? What did God show you? And what were the steps that brought you to deliverance? &gt;&gt; What he showed me was, you know, that you can't if you're to deny that you're actually suffering from something is not faith. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. That's just denial. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; You know, when somebody says, "Well, I'm just not going to claim that." Well, I don't believe in claiming, you know, not claim, you know, that I believe in claiming your healing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. But don't lie to yourself and say, "Well, this doesn't happen. I don't this doesn't exist. That's not being real." &gt;&gt; That it is real. And if you you want to be healed from it, you you first got to say, "Yes, this is going on." &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. &gt;&gt; You know, right. &gt;&gt; And um and so I uh I I came to that to realize that, but I I also realized that wasn't what God had for me. God wasn't done for me. this wasn't his plan for me, &gt;&gt; you know, &gt;&gt; and um uh you know, and and many times we want, like you were saying, we want something instant. We just want to instantly be healed, instantly be done with whatever trial we're going through, &gt;&gt; you know, and I can tell you this, while I was going through all that, we actually had a a a court case come up within our family. somebody in our family was falsely accused of something and we went through a year-long court uh &gt;&gt; my &gt;&gt; case with this during that time &gt;&gt; my my my &gt;&gt; and uh and I remember during that you know praying and actually myself trying to fix this situation you know &gt;&gt; and God didn't he didn't want my help &gt;&gt; wow &gt;&gt; you know and God took care of it &gt;&gt; so that's one thing you got you had to learn in se several instances that God wants you to wait for his timing, &gt;&gt; just try to fix. And &gt;&gt; you know, it uh I can tell you this, I I remember a time when I first started pastoring, we had a lot of folks that were suffering from different illnesses in the church. And uh you know, I had I'd been associate pastor up there in Lorraine uh for for a number of years with my father, but okay. &gt;&gt; I just I just felt like, man, I I'm lacking in faith here or something to help these people. Mhm. &gt;&gt; And I thought, well, I need to have somebody come preach that I think that has a lot of faith. So, I called up brother Juel Forny. &gt;&gt; I said, "Come preach for me, brother. I got some people that need to be healed, you know." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh and I thought, "I really need some help in this, you know." &gt;&gt; But I through this I I believe I actually began to learn really what faith is. Faith isn't something that it's not just positive thinking, &gt;&gt; right? You know, &gt;&gt; exactly. It's it's um uh there's there's something that anchors. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it's something that surpasses understanding and reasoning. &gt;&gt; It's you know, as the Bible says, it's the evidence of things that you can't see. &gt;&gt; You know, the unseen. Brother Ram says, you can't see, taste, feel it, or smell it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But it's the evidence of it. You know, &gt;&gt; and uh uh I I you know, I might be suffering from this, but I got faith I'm going to be healed. And that's the evidence I am going to be healed because God's the one that gave you that faith, &gt;&gt; you know. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and his word is it's all through the Bible. It's all about faith. &gt;&gt; Yep. Yep. And that's the reason I ask what you learn through it because you know and that's one of the great things you learn and because I feel like that besides the victory of getting over the depression and that it's the it's the victories throughout that God is doing people don't see those as victories but the victory of learning the power of holding faith there and substance faith during the waiting. That's a victory as well. And sometimes we skip over wanting this particular thing to be delivered from. But God's got all this to teach you in between which are victories as well. You know what was the steps as we come to a close here pretty soon? What's the steps that led up to the full deliverance then? &gt;&gt; Um well as I was telling you you know I started trying to do what I could physically. Okay &gt;&gt; because they tell you that uh you know exercise kind helps uh your brain to actually start to function to produce the right kind of chemicals endorphins and so forth you know. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm going to start jogging tomorrow. I'm going to start jogging tomorrow. And and you know the the Bible tells us, you know, that there there's actually healing through laughter. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; You know, and when I and when I would think about that, I always thought about uh your your father, you know, and that song that he would sing and uh you know, &gt;&gt; the joy of the Lord is my strength. Oh my goodness. And uh so uh the more that they when the doctors started telling me this thing about these endorphins and all these things and how they help you and while they were telling me I just kept thinking about your father in that song he would sing you know and I then it would take me to the scripture on it you know. Oh my. &gt;&gt; And so I I you know and and and my dad used to say he would say look if uh you he said start praising the Lord and singing even when you don't feel like it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know because he says that the the angel of the Lord's encamped about those that fear him. But brother Brandham says he comes to his praise. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know &gt;&gt; and so I think that that's let me say this. uh you know I I had had trouble with with sleeping to try to get my mind to turn off. And so what uh what I did was I would put on music. &gt;&gt; And I believe there's a a lot of healing that could come through music. &gt;&gt; That's what &gt;&gt; you know and singing. And that's what I would do, &gt;&gt; you know, and it was it was like soothing. And we know in the Bible David would come and play on the harp and things and soothe Saul. Of course, we know Saul was being afflicted and we know why. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But still, it's healing from the music. It's anointed music &gt;&gt; and that. And so, uh, and then, um, &gt;&gt; uh, when I was having the, uh, the attacks of the PTSD, which and I don't want to drag this out, but, uh, you know, you you start experiencing everything that you experienced whenever that traumatic event happened. So, it it affects you again all over again. M &gt;&gt; and so uh and and then you actually lose contact with reasonable logical thinking. &gt;&gt; And so uh I had uh I had read where brother Brandham talked about uh having a a cross hanging in off his mirror in his car, &gt;&gt; right? And he would say something about when uh uh some ungodly woman come down the street, he would just turn and look at the cross, you know, &gt;&gt; and and then I thought about what with when he gives a testimony about John Ryan with his healing and that he he said I realized John Ryan needed something. He said, "So I told him, you just keep confessing by his stripes I'm healed." you know, and that. So, uh, when I was thinking about that, so what I did was, uh, I went and I actually, uh, I found a cross that was actually made for soldiers, you know, and I had been a soldier, so I found this cross and it was made for soldiers and that and it was on a piece of rawhide. &gt;&gt; And so, uh, I kept that with me. &gt;&gt; That's wonderful. And uh when I would start to to to go through this and have an attack that I would take out that cross and I would hold on to it, you know, and I would just claim I would just claim the blood. I would just claim healing. I would claim by his stripes I'm healed. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; and and the thing about it was, Brother Paul, you you think that it was, you know, like you said, healing did not come instantly to me. &gt;&gt; But it's persevering. &gt;&gt; Yes. And I think that's one of the things that I learned that I when I've talked to other people that are going through things like this is don't give up. You persevere. It doesn't matter whe whatever the sickness is. You know, if you're battling cancer, if you're battling whatever it is, yeah, I'm not telling them don't go have your do whatever that you feel led of God to do, whatever he gives you peace to do with treatments or whatever else, you know, but don't give up. Don't give into this is what my life how it's going to be &gt;&gt; because uh that's you know brother Brandham teaches us that that is not how God wants his people to be &gt;&gt; you know &gt;&gt; and that's why he provided a healing for us. He that's why he you know he talks to Sister Bruce in an interview and she's talking about her mistakes &gt;&gt; and and things and so brother Brandham I just want to point out this statement he makes. He goes, "That's what Jesus died for." And so I would hang on to that little statement brother Brandham would say and and when I was going through these things and suffering so say this is what Jesus died for. &gt;&gt; My that's good, brother. &gt;&gt; You know, he died for me. He died for me to be delivered from this. &gt;&gt; My my and as I said, the atonement covered it all. So that's that's wonderful. &gt;&gt; And so I just I just held on and like you said, and I I said it tonight kind of emphasized on it. &gt;&gt; I'm the Lord thy God that heals all. all of thy diseases. &gt;&gt; Thy diseases. &gt;&gt; Yep. &gt;&gt; So talk about that la that one service where you you know you've talked about you know and and brother Brandham talked about he said there's healing in music there's healing in laughter according to the scripture laughter doeth good like a medicine you know you talk about the medicine there's healing in medicine but all this leading up to that and then you come to growing into that service brother Bo spoke what happened there. Well, at the service, Brother Bo spoke, um, you know, I was I was still suffering really bad, but the the enemy was attacking me then, saying, you know, this is what it is. You just don't have it, you know. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; And in that service of Brother Bo come and spoke, uh, I I had my wife, I told her, I said, "Help me get up to the front." And so, she grabbed my arm and helped me up to the front and I said, "Brother Bo, lay hands on me and pray for me." You know, and uh, I didn't get healed, brother. I still suffered for several years after that. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; But but what happened in that service was you know the power of God came down and and u you know uh I fell out on the floor. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; You know and uh um brother Bo said he told the people he's okay. He he that's just the spirit of God. Yeah. You know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh and and and all it did was it just it gave me this little assurance, you know, hey, look, God still cares about me, you know. And uh &gt;&gt; didn't you get up the next service and say, &gt;&gt; well, no, it wasn't actually the next service. It was actually it was actually several years after that really. It still went on. But I after I started uh like you know walking and doing all these different things and that I started telling the the doctor I was seeing I said start I want off these medicines. I want to be completely off of them. You know &gt;&gt; and of course they tell you you can't go just stop taking them you know that uh it will cause other bad effects and stuff. So they started decreasing them little by little by little and then certain ones I came completely off of but I was still on I think maybe a couple right there but it was very reduced u prescription of them you know and so you know but I was I I really believed I was healed and and I was tired of going through this weaning process you know &gt;&gt; okay &gt;&gt; and so I I gave the testimony to the church cuz I was I was feeling different when I preached. I was feeling different when I studied, you know. I was I was just and I told him I said, "Look, God has healed me." &gt;&gt; And I said, "I want to tell you from this day forward, I'm not taking any more medicine." You know, I said, "I'm done with it." You know, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; And uh so uh you know, and of course then I went home. That was on a Sunday. I went home and uh that was during that week, Satan attacked me with anxiety attacks. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. you know, and of course he was telling me it's because you went cold turkey off these medicines. It's because you're not taking the medicines. It's because of this or that. You know, and I guess I I said cold tur, but you know, my wife talked me into and I don't I wasn't going to say this and God bless her. I love her. She loves me. Uh she she talked me into letting her decrease it one pill a day here. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. &gt;&gt; Until we were done that week. Okay. But anyway, by the end of that week, I was suffering really bad from an anxiety attack that was going on. And I I and I, like I said, tonight I I sleep with the CPAT machine, which has constant air blowing in your face, but I would lay down and it was like I couldn't breathe. And that started that Sunday night after I gave the testimony. &gt;&gt; And uh this is the whole thing. I believe you give a testimony, Satan's going to attack you from that testimony. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, exactly. &gt;&gt; And and and so he I I would I told my wife, I can't breathe. I would set back up. I said, "Lay your hands on me and pray for me." And I told her, I said, "I know I'm healed. I know this is just the devil, you know, but uh it wasn't something that I could just through positive thinking make go away." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And so I suffered that whole week through that. And I think maybe on Friday or Saturday, I text my my mom and I said, "Mom, you got to pray for me." You know, and um and and and to be honest, I did I hadn't reached out to anybody else in my church or anybody else. I didn't tell anybody else what was going on. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; Here. I gave this testimony. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, I think Satan was kind of shaming me again, too. &gt;&gt; And so, uh uh but I told my mom. So, my mom texted my brother who was preaching out somewhere getting ready to go into a service. And so, he sent her a quote. She forwarded to me uh where brother Brandham had prayed for somebody who had uh was cancer and said they were healed and then they got more sick and worse after that. And brother Brandham said, "Tell them that's the best sign in the world that they're healed, that they're &gt;&gt; and when I read that, &gt;&gt; uh, it wasn't that my thoughts changed, okay? It wasn't anything that something supernatural anchored." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and when it did, immediately that heavy weight that I felt like was on my chest and the and the breathing and all that, it completely changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, and and it was gone. And I've never that I think like you and I talked I think it was his last ditch effort of Satan right his last attack on me with that you know &gt;&gt; after you proclaim the healing get off the medicine &gt;&gt; and so uh you know and then you know it just supernatural happened there and then that was gone and I've never experienced any of it ever again. &gt;&gt; Never experiencing it again. And when was that that that day happened? &gt;&gt; September of 2023. And you never had any other bout with it at all? &gt;&gt; No. No depression, no anxiety, no nothing, you know. And and not only that, but I say God's restored me, you know, and and to the to the detriment of the devil. God actually taught me a lot through this, allow me to go through it, you know, like you look at Job. &gt;&gt; Job uh you know, everything he went through and where does Job come out at the end of it? Job comes out with one of the greatest revelations at that time and day, you know, he comes out with a revelation of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, &gt;&gt; exactly. &gt;&gt; And so I I believe that that &gt;&gt; I've come out greater and and &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; from that, you know. &gt;&gt; Well, and I don't claim to be a superhero, brother Paul, or anything like that, &gt;&gt; but but I can tell you this. Uh I I believe I I've got more tenacity about this than ever before. And uh uh I uh I'm like a bulldog with the faith on it now. Like brother Brandham talked about Jack Cole, you know. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh I I I just I I want to tell others, you know, no matter what you're suffering from, &gt;&gt; just don't quit. Don't let go. You are going to get your healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, don't never feel like, well, it's been going on so many years. This is just the way it's going to be. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know, just never quit. &gt;&gt; Well, you preached to our church tonight on being bullied &gt;&gt; by the enemy &gt;&gt; and you were bullied for 12 years. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir, brother. &gt;&gt; But one of the last things there that you said, and I actually thought it actually before you were saying it, is that you were afraid, intimidated, bullied by the enemy, but now I believe the devil's afraid of you. And you said that now the devil's afraid of me, and that's the way it's supposed to be. Uh, I'll tell you, he's he's on the run. And this testimony, he's on the run with a lot of people, too, because I believe it's going to be an encouragement. I wanted to uh say one last thing, and I I appreciate you taking this time tonight to to share. Um, I want to say thank you, brother Jerry, for the honesty, for the transparency, for the willingness to be able to tell the whole thing because I think there's still a lot of people that are not willing to do that when it comes to a subject like this. They don't want to talk about, as you said, it was embarrassing. Sometimes the environments we're in, we don't want to share weakness. And yet and yet uh brother Brandham spoke that uh message perfect strength by weakness. He says the the Pentecostals are always you know bragging about how strong they are. But it's when we become weak that he becomes strong. And that's what he tried to teach us is that to me it's not weakness for somebody to be transparent and open especially a minister of this message a minister of the message of the last days to be open about it is going to bless a lot of people because to me brother Biscll said something uh years ago he said the only way to deal with the devil is to expose them. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; The only day way to deal with demons is to expose them. That's why I talk about when you get more knowledge of what's going on you become knowledgeable. you become, okay, I know what's taking place now, but you're exposing through the confession of the of of the the cross, the blood of Jesus Christ, his healing. Um, you're exposing the enemy. And when you're transparent and share it from your heart, this is what happened. I'm being real. I'm a Christian. I'm a Holy Ghost fil, but this this was real. This happened, too. &gt;&gt; The the devil's power lays in remaining hidden. &gt;&gt; So true. And whenever he's exposed, he loses that power. &gt;&gt; So true. And I was just thinking yesterday, you know, the scriptures says two or three places he reveals the secrets of the heart. And uh and he still does that. You know, when they remain a secret, Satan can really wreak havoc with that. But when he reveals the secrets of the heart and we're honest about and we bring things, God brings them out, God exposes them. That's a victory. And I think it's a great step for you to do that. You know, I know of um I'm blessed to know a lot of ministers and a lot of uh friends and people that really do believe. My sister Sharon um was just healed of a tumor. She just completely gone as of a few weeks ago. Um we didn't expect her to uh live. It didn't look good for her and it was rough on our family and just uh you know, the Lord completely delivered her. So, you know, we believe those things, but we when we're going through something and you're honest, I know a lot of people, a lot of ministers, I think there's a smaller number that would be transparent about it, say, "I'm being real, and I'm not going to let the devil dechristianize me or take away what I've got, but this is real. I've been through it." And the and God's going to get the glory at the end of it. At the end of 12 years, God gets the glory for it. And so, I I appreciate it. I love you very much. appreciate your stand for the message all these years, but this brings an extra element I think that's going to bless some other people uh that's going through things and as you you've shared with them uh whatever they're going through, you know, don't give up. &gt;&gt; Don't give up for sure. So, I appreciate you, buddy. &gt;&gt; God bless you and thank you so much for sharing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. &gt;&gt; God bless you.
