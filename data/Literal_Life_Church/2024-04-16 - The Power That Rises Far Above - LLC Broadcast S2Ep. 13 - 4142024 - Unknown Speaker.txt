hi everybody Pastor Paul Le Fontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literall life. church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today I come to the garden Al while the is still on the [Music] [Applause] rose and the voice I hear falling on my ear the son of God [Music] discloses and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own and the joy we share as we take none other has ever Ephesians chapter 1 starting at Verse 18 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead can you say Amen so this power is what raised Jesus from the dead when he raised him from the dead and set him in his own it own right hand in Heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all praise the Lord today today we celebrate the morning that our Lord rose from the grave and uh it's celebrated around the world and we're thankful for that we're thankful that people in the world acknowledge a lot of people acknowledge that he rose again there's some who don't believe it some that need proof and uh but there's some who are believers that believe he rose and this is the day that most of the world gives to celebrate the Lord raising from the grave and coming out of the grave and that when he come out of the Grave was a fin Vindication and proof that he was truly everything that the word said about him that was the Vindication that was the proof that he was truly everything the word said about him there had to be a a proof to it uh we can say a lot of things but then people wait for the proof Jesus said things but he had the proof and he followed up with Vindication and so when he rose that was everything that was the Vindication and that was the proof that truly all the word had said about him uh and what he had proclaimed while he was on the earth uh in a Ministry three and a half years what he had proclaimed it came to pass and he said in three days if you destroy this body if you if you put this in the ground if you destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up again and he proved what he said was true let me say something to everybody this morning God has never failed when he speaks something God has never failed his word and it always has come to pass and it always will God has a perfect track record people will fail you and you may have a lack of trust in people but we can trust God cuz his word has always come to pass and the resurrection is the proof of that what Jesus said and what the word said he would do we know that it came to pass and we're celebrating that this morning we we want to go into the subject a little bit what Paul says here in Ephesians and uh by the world knowing that it's the Resurrection Sunday we also know some other things at least most of us we know that Jesus uh was both humanity and Divinity together how many believe that Jesus was both humanity and Divinity together as one man and uh we we realize that the Bible says that the fullness the fullness of the godhead bodily was in him bodily in other words all of God was poured into that vessel and and so people don't understand and I just say to you don't try to figure that out don't try to figure it out in your own mind anyway because when you try to figure out a man that has full Divinity and fully a man don't try to figure it out because you're going to get it all messed up hence Nia 3:25 ad they got it messed up they were trying to figure out how God was in man and when man gets his intellect that's how we get messed up with splitting him into three different persons let me tell you don't try to figure that out with your mind ask God for a revelation of it can I get an amen this morning it comes by Revelation that we would even come close to understanding how man was full Divinity and how he's full humanity and so we know that but we also know that at the end of Jesus life there uh there was a very much of The Human Side displayed as a matter of fact as he come to the last days of his life and the last hours of his life if you know your Bible you realize Jesus when he come to the very end there was very much human in it uh when when he come to the tragic court case when he was accused in court he was an innocent man and he was falsely accused when he come to the brutal treatment of his body when he come to the crucifixion and in a few moments I might elaborate on that a little bit knowing that it was Good Friday this past Friday and we we look at that we want to understand those things but his life at the end came to a turn that even the disciples didn't understand with the brutality and the crucifixion and the scourging and the mocking and the making fun of and he he lived the the the last days of his life and you can't find God in any of it now early in his life when he started his ministry you could find God the supernatural God was working through his words in other words he'd speak and the blind eyes would be open he would touch people and they'd be completely healed numerous Miracles took place in the Supernatural God was speaking to him God brought him up to the Mount Transfiguration and said this is my son in whom I'm pleased to dwell well so God was there but at the end of his life there's not many traces of God because God actually he was there but he withdrew himself because this man had to go to Calvary as our lamb and he had to go to Calvary as a man because God couldn't be killed God could not see be displayed in our eyes anyway in this defeat in this scourging and and we know the story is that the disciples are wondering and and they're saying even in the I think the garden is saying can't you call for help all the soldiers everybody's taking can't you call for help and Jesus said don't you think that I could call for thousands of Legions of angels and they would come and change us and he said but that the scripture might fulfill so there was an obedience to what the Bible said can you say am man had to be fulfilled and in that moment God as it in our terms withdrew himself and so we we know that it was God in man but yet we see this this withdrawal because he had to go to Calvary as our lamb and uh in the last hours in the very last hours he even with went without without any intervention of God at the cross there wasn't any intervention of God we're saying God God don't let this happen but you see the scripture had to be fulfilled and we had to be saved we needed a sacrifice you couldn't do it on your you weren't worthy enough no man was worthy enough somebody had to do it for us and so that's the reason there was no intervention of God in this act is because and in fact in fact he was so much left alone that he cried himself at the cross my God my God why has Thou forsaken me you remember he said that so this is evidence that he's feeling it he knows and he's crying out why have you forsaken that's the man crying out because he had to live in that moment that he felt forsaken even by God I'd asked for a raise of hands this morning how many has felt that way yourself he had to live where he's saying God why have you forsaken me God what where are you God why and and in worldly terms the last of Jesus life felt like a defeat over and over again there was no God in it it felt defeated it was defeat in Man's eyes but see see this morning let the record show that The Final End was not defeat and that's why we talk about the resurrection because as much defeat was there as much as God hath withdrawn himself I like the song that the choir saying Jehovah Jehovah has the final say can I get an amen this morning and I'm glad to say that the final end was not a defeat but the final end was a victory the final end was not all of this uh being forsaken by God but you see the the there was not a defeat but when when the body was dead and in the grave and that was it and in a dark uh cold uh grave with the Stone Road in front of it the power of God moved on that body and resurrected that body can you say praise the Lord Jehovah had the final say am I just want to say to you when God's involved he'll have the final say of every every situation of every condition come on I should have get a bigger amen than that I know when you're dark and under a tunnel of something and under just under something it's hard for you to say Amen to that but you should say Amen because God has a perfect track record and when he's involved he gets the final say and I can tell you he's going to cause us to end in Victory and if he did it at the cross and he did it here in Jesus life then we find that there was a power and this is what he says in Ephesians there was a power that come upon and set Jesus it was so powerful that it come on his body and raised him from the dead far above principalities and power so there was the power that raised him and and he did not just raise out of the grave and and and then walk back into the same conditions again did you realize when God raised him when the power of God raised him up he did not just come back to earth again now we know that he walked a few days on Earth but this power did not keep him this power he actually went to hell he he he he he seen the soul preach to the souls in prison but then the power was still on him he raised he raised past the grave he raised past the Earth he didn't come back into the same conditions again can you amen then the Bible says he raised far above and that's my message to you this morning when God raised him he raised far above the conditions again far above the Earth can you say Amen far above defeat somebody say praise the Lord how far did he raise him above principalities above Powers he broke through every demonic Dimension can you say am man this power was powerful enough to break through anything how far did he raise them above principalities above power above might Dominion every name that is named the most famous name we've ever had in the world the Caesars even famous names today God raised his name above every name not only in this world but also in the world to come and hath put all things under his feet I'm telling you this power raised him far above everything now he didn't just raise out of the Grave he didn't walk back into the same conditions which reminds me of some people that come to church and hear the power of God and don't respond and walk back into their same conditions again might be a lesson for us how many know the Bible says as Jesus talked about he says a man he said he the house can be cleaned and when the house is Sanctified cuz see sanctification isn't enough amen I could use a little bit more help this morning sanctification isn't enough got a lot of people that come under the presence of God get Sanctified they feel good they feel better their Spirits have been released from them but that's not the final step can you say amen he walks through Dry places and if he don't get that house filled seven other demons will come and fill that I'm speaking about what Jesus said that's how it works and so I'll tell you Jesus was not just raised back to Earthly conditions if he'd have showed up the same way they would have continued the persecution they would have continued the things and and all that he was doing being persecuted of but I can tell you God had to raise him above the persecution above the defeat above Earthly conditions amen far above how many this morning got things that you've been through you like to be lifted far above those things he didn't just raise out of the Grave he didn't walk back into the same conditions the power of Resurrection moved in actually in a place far above all things to a position position at the right hand of authority of God in a place called Heavenly places this is where the power of God that took the dead body of Jesus and raised him far above defeat and raised them past principalities far above and placed them in a place called Heavenly places and we've been taught by the word of God that that is not a feeling it's not a sensation I love the presence of God I Fe I felt it I know that it's real but when he said Heavenly places it's not a feeling it's not that it gives us tingles can you say am man Heavenly places is the believer's position in Jesus Christ somebody say praise the Lord he lifted Jesus to Heavenly places and I don't know if anybody noticed uh and scanned while I was reading about Jesus coming to Heaven place you probably didn't read it but I'm going to bring it up if you got your Bibles and if you don't they're going to have to bring it up back there I want you to go to Ephesians 1 back a few verses to verse three where it says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ did any anybody notice that the same place Jesus was raised to is the same place Paul's teaching that every believer who has the Holy Ghost has been raised into Heavenly places we got the same position and guess what most Christians don't know it that's right most Christians live below their privileges now I want to emphasize that because below your privileges is not where you're supposed to be living young people everybody below your priv privileges is not where you're supposed to be living if we only see our conditions of our broken Families Our corrupt world it's more it's more than clear to us our conditions we can see all of that we can see the the state that we're in if that's all we're looking at then we're doomed we need to see what Calvary has done for us and what the resurrection has done for us and that's what he's going to say here we need to see what count we needs our eyes enlightened that we know what Calvary has done for us and we know what the resurrection has done for us that's what I'm preaching to you this morning that do you know what Calvary has done for you do you or or is it just a symbolism do you know what Calvary has done for you and your condition and do you know what the power of the Resurrection can do for you in your condition who hath believed our report who to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he's talking about Christ here when he comes prophecy he was despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with grief now notice this is the mighty conqueror no before he was the mighty conqueror he went through this what for for you and what was he going through what was he feeling those last few days he was despised he was rejected anybody ever been rejected before he was despised and rejected of men a Man of Sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our Grieves how is this tied together he bore the things that we would bear he he felt everything that we would feel he had to feel it he had to feel what it meant to be lonely he had to feel friends rejecting him even his own disciples he had to feel being lonely without anybody in the world but just himself he had to feel that because why you would feel that and frankly friends you would never be able to tell God he doesn't understand what I'm going through and there might be some people in here that have said that to God God just this is new he doesn't understand why I'm going I'm here to correct you about that because if this is our perfect lamb he experienced what life would be for us and he bore it can you say amen he borne our griefs he carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him smitten stricken smitten of God and Afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed I'm adding in verse six all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all so let me tell you something that scripture tells you you're not in a different category in the sense of your human flesh all we all of us that covers all kind of covers everybody I don't care how much pride you have all we like sheep have gone astray am all of us in our own self are weak can you say Amen we've made mistakes we've made blunders even if you've hid them very well you're like a sheep that has gone astray and you will always go astray unless the Shepherd gets a hold of your life and all the sheep that have gone astray the answer is one thing and that's this lamb that's going to Calvary that whatever way way we have strayed he's given us a sacrifice that we can come back to and say God you did it for me he has a struggle in the garden and you know what the struggle was over God's will or his own will it was pretty intense because he was sweating and he his his his face had become so intense from the pressure and that battle of his own will that it was like great sweat drops of of blood and science says it got so intense that it turns into some blood sweat turns into blood that's the first time he shed his blood and guess what it was related to a struggle over his own will and God's Will has anybody ever had the same struggle is it tense yes in the court on under pilate he's being falsely accused he's being ridiculed he's being made fun of he's being mopped there's a robe put on him to mock him as being King a purple robe and then the crown of thorns the next place he sheds blood a crown of thorns is crushed where where crushed in His Head Shed blood came from his head anyone ever had any battles in your mind anyone having them today you don't have to raise your hand but I'd say if you live in this world you have the battle of the mind this age is mental this age is going insane people can't think straight it's everything a Believer could do can keep his heart in the word of God to keep his own sound thinking and I'm here to tell you the atonement and the shed blood of Jesus Christ addressed everything condition of this Modern Age he paid the price for you he shed blood in that area this the mental conditions the insanity the addictions of the Mind the pornography and he shed blood there in his head nobody those soldiers didn't know what they were doing when they crushed it in and blood came out of his head now we know what he was doing now we know what was taking now we know why he had to shed blood from there maybe you can remember that this week when the devil's got in a tail spin in your mind come on people maybe you can remember what this preacher has said to you that God did something for you God shed blood for that he shed blood at the whipping post 39 Stripes that's another place he shed blood and that's when uh anyone ever being wounded deeply like that and it was in his back the pieces of metal and different things put at the end of the whip so that it's not just a whipping in a normal sense but that it would cut the the Flesh and open up his flesh and all that is about opening up a wound and all these wounds where the flesh was just hanging down his back and we know we know if that person survived it'll take a long time but their the body would heal itself most of the time they died but they didn't want them to die they wanted to suffer so there was a long healing process to Stripes going in his back but it was that it was it was it was looking ahead because Isaiah says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity and by his stripes we receive healing somebody raise your hand if you're sick this morning by his stripes I'm Healed he already paid the price for my healing and though that would take days months to heal that back you've seen it in movies sometimes when it took days and uh months and sometimes years to get a full healing to that back and sometimes healing is a process but I can tell you it's not just the body naturally healing itself God provided in his atonement that for any sickness any cancer any disease we're not afraid of any of it cuz he paid the price for any disease to be healed somebody say Amen this morning it's might what what my Lord means to me this morning he means so much more to me and then the shed Blood on the cross pierced his side Nails in his hands and in his feet blood of course came forth from there but then they pierced aside and blood and water and Spirit came out and that's an important thing because we realize when when when his Spirit came out of him it praise the Lord the blood cell had to be broken and something had to come out of him why because we needed that same Spirit to be able to live how many needed that Holy Ghost that come out of him the blood cell had to be broken so it would come out of him and come back on the day of Pentecost and fill the Believers he shed blood so you could have the Holy Ghost this was the most cruel death that had ever taken place in history this was cruelty he was mocked he was spit in the face he was innocent but he was falsely accused he was made fun of two reasons why they there was such cruelity in this death he had to feel what extreme abuse he had to be abused because there would be people in this generation especially that were abused sexually abused mentally abused emotionally abused physically abused he had to be abused he had to be scored he had to be mocked he had to made be made fun of can you say am man and it was extreme cruelty because he had to feel extreme abuse and cruelty and what it felt like so that you could never go to him to say God you don't understand he understands cuz he felt he felt he felt that cruelty it was secondly an extremely cruel death because sin is Relentless sin is the most cruelty that can come to a human being I got a lot of people nodding their heads and say yes brother the Paul what my life has been through anybody listening Maybe you've had a pretty cushioned life but there's some people sitting here that's been saved by grace amen but sin they can tell you sin was cruel to their lives am destroyed their Spirit drugs destroyed how they think properly sin never sin is only sin is only some joy for a temporal time but every time it never ends upu right it's cruel to your life our sacrificial lamb went went through all of this for us he covered all the cruelty of a human experience his blood covered it all to redeem you my brother and sister his blood covered it all so
