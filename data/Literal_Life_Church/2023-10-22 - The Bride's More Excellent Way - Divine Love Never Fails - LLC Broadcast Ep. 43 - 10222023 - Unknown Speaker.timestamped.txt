[1:09] me oh the same
[1:13] God who spoke
[1:16] you the woman
[1:18] at the
[1:21] world the same
[1:24] God whose
[1:26] wonders to many

[1:35] God who
[1:38] parted the
[1:40] Raging Red

[1:49] God who's
[1:52] living in
[1:57] me oh the s
[2:00] God who
[2:03] created all the heavens and all the
[2:08] Earth he he came back living in Jesus
[2:15] and there was
[2:17] power in
[2:20] everywhere but now
[2:23] in these last days I'm beginning to
[2:33] see that it's that same
[2:38] God
[2:40] living in
[2:42] [Music]
[2:46] me the same
[2:49] God who spoke you
[2:55] oh will he is the same God
[3:01] who
[3:02] wonders to

[3:52] many
[3:55] to oh s God who
[4:01] parted the
[4:04] ring
[4:05] [Music]
[4:09] re he's the same
[4:12] God who's
[4:15] living in
[4:19] me
[4:20] oh he the sa
[4:24] God who
[4:26] living in me
[4:31] 2 Corinthians 4:18 in our Holy Bible
[4:37] while we look not at the things which
[4:39] are seen But at the things which are not
[4:42] seen for the things which are seen are
[4:45] temporal but the things which are not
[4:48] seen are
[4:51] Eternal so as Christians we uh we cannot
[4:55] look at just temporal things we cannot
[4:58] live uh with our eyes on just seeing
[5:01] things what we see in front of us
[5:03] because the temporal how many know that
[5:06] it's faith that makes us see the Unseen
[5:09] we have to live by faith can you say
[5:11] amen and Faith sees what is unseen Faith
[5:15] sees God's will God's plan we cannot be
[5:18] Christians that look at temporal things
[5:20] or the seen things because they're
[5:21] temporal they'll end they'll fade away
[5:25] but we must look at things that won't
[5:27] fade away we must live on things that
[5:29] won't Fade Away amen I find people live
[5:32] in the past a lot they live in a
[5:34] rearview mirror they live their hearts
[5:37] are all locked up because every day they
[5:38] live in a rearview mirror while they're
[5:40] driving that's very dangerous driving
[5:42] you know very dangerous to drive looking
[5:45] trying to drive looking always looking
[5:47] at something that happened in the past
[5:48] to you but to drive forward we must
[5:51] forget the past ask God to forgive us
[5:54] and forgive others and not look in the
[5:56] river but look ahead another reason that
[5:59] people don't look ahead with a positive
[6:01] attitude and a and a strength and by
[6:03] faith look into the Unseen is because
[6:05] they're looking at temporal things 1
[6:08] Corinthians 13:8 charity never faileth
[6:10] but whether there be prophecies they
[6:13] shall fail whether they pre tongues they
[6:15] shall cease whether there be knowledge
[6:18] it shall vanish away for we know in part
[6:21] we prophesy in part but when that which
[6:24] is perfect is come then that which is in
[6:26] part shall be done away so what is this
[6:28] speaking of of it's speaking of a
[6:31] transition that Christians make from
[6:33] temporal things even prophecies are
[6:36] temporal things transitioning from
[6:39] temporal things to Eternal things and
[6:42] one of the things that's Eternal is the
[6:43] love of God it'll never fail you so
[6:46] that's why we want to be living more by
[6:48] the love of God than temporal things
[6:50] that we see we we we may we our healing
[6:54] for our bodies we may be completely
[6:56] miraculously healed or a miracle take
[6:58] place but in some cases because of these
[7:01] bodies you'll get sick of something
[7:03] again so that that means that our
[7:05] healing is only for this life it's a
[7:07] temporal thing so in other words we
[7:09] believe in healing and we go to God for
[7:11] healing but we don't have our emphasis
[7:14] always on even those things that are
[7:16] temporal we must have it on the love of
[7:18] God we must have it on something Eternal
[7:20] something that lasts and so he's
[7:22] teaching this and notice the next
[7:24] scripture in verse 11 when I was a child
[7:26] I spake as a child I understood as a
[7:29] child I thought as a child now he's
[7:32] getting ready to really bring a
[7:33] correction to the baby Corinthian Church
[7:37] spiritual
[7:39] babies and what did they do when I was a
[7:41] child I spake as a child understood as a
[7:42] child I thought as a child but when I
[7:44] became a man I put away childish things
[7:48] he's talking about maturity he's talking
[7:51] about growing from temporal things to
[7:54] Eternal things and he's saying the
[7:56] Corinthians chose to emphasize and stay
[7:58] as children spiritually that when they
[8:01] CA came to church all they wanted to see
[8:04] is just a prophecy or a tongue or
[8:07] something like that which is not a
[8:09] problem it's that should be that's
[8:11] that's a a wonderful thing but if you
[8:13] only came to church just to see those
[8:16] things that won't last that won't keep
[8:19] you we should come to church to saying I
[8:21] want to connect with the Eternal God
[8:24] through Jesus Christ the word there has
[8:27] to be a connection with something ET
[8:29] etal so Paul says that we are moving we
[8:32] have to live and he's speaking to
[8:34] Christians here in First Corinthians you
[8:35] have to know he's speaking to the
[8:36] Corinthians we must not put our trust or
[8:39] live only on things that will fade and
[8:42] it's surprising to find him say that th
[8:45] we didn't we didn't expect we know about
[8:48] things that fade in our life friendships
[8:49] fade governments fade the world's
[8:52] falling
[8:53] apart we see everything fading away
[8:56] nothing last I'm going to talk about
[8:58] that in a minute minute and that's why
[9:00] we can't put our trust in something that
[9:02] don't last we can't teach our children
[9:05] to make their priority in life something
[9:08] that won't last can I get an amen I'll
[9:12] get to you parents in just a minute I
[9:13] want to give you some encouragement that
[9:15] we can't do that to our children but we
[9:17] are surprised to hear some other things
[9:19] that fade because these are things from
[9:20] the kingdom of God prophecies will fade
[9:23] tongues will fade knowledge will fade
[9:26] away so even things that are in the
[9:29] kingdom of God we take them we enjoy
[9:31] them but we can't put all of our
[9:33] dependence on these things CU they will
[9:35] fade away someday but there's something
[9:37] that will never fade away that's the
[9:39] elective love of God over your life he
[9:42] loved you before the foundation of the
[9:44] world his love never changes for you
[9:47] blessed be his name love never had a
[9:50] beginning so love will never have an end
[9:53] I like serving a God and I like serving
[9:55] him every day knowing that I am
[9:57] unconditionally loved for from before
[9:59] the foundation of the world and nothing
[10:01] that I do will ever change that it is
[10:04] spiritual immaturity for Christians to
[10:06] live every day consumed with temporal
[10:09] things caught up in temporal blessings
[10:11] even blessings from God caught up in
[10:14] temporal even little children when Paul
[10:16] says when I was a child I spake as child
[10:19] he's typing a young child they're CH
[10:21] they're a child they think as a child
[10:22] they act like a child and that's normal
[10:25] for a child but we can't stay children
[10:27] spiritually and he says and that's thing
[10:29] when when he types that even children in
[10:31] the natural choose quick pleasures and
[10:34] what feels
[10:36] good that's in our children they'll
[10:39] choose the the sucker over good food for
[10:43] them they'll choose temporal things
[10:47] they'll choose the the quick pleasure um
[10:50] they'll they'll pull out all the a young
[10:53] baby or child like my granddaughter will
[10:56] pull all the toys out of in the entire
[10:59] room and spread them all over with no
[11:02] thought of the dastardly thing of mom
[11:05] and dad saying go clean it up later they
[11:08] never think about that part they don't
[11:10] think long term they think of the
[11:12] temporal pleasure and they bring it all
[11:15] out and they pull them and they forget
[11:17] they have to clean it up and then you
[11:19] teach them that song clean up clean up
[11:21] clean up and you try to get the joy out
[11:23] of cleaning up in
[11:26] them for because they forget and they
[11:30] don't want to work hard and they don't
[11:32] want discipline teenagers teenagers most
[11:35] mostly don't like the discipline of
[11:37] school they like the fun they like the
[11:40] parties they like to go be with the
[11:42] youth they like to go out to Starbucks
[11:45] and spend all kinds of money there
[11:47] on a drink that should cost 20 cents is
[11:51] $8 but it's fun they never think of
[11:54] about the
[11:56] budget they want the fun but not work or
[11:59] school and and and and and they don't
[12:01] see that the teaching and training we
[12:03] give them for school what they learn in
[12:05] school what they learn at church what
[12:06] they learned in the youth meetings what
[12:08] they learned from the pastor and from
[12:09] the parents that's the stuff that's long
[12:12] lasting for life can you say Amen but
[12:14] they they don't want those things most
[12:16] of the time they kind of most kids buck
[12:17] up against that and and but the fun will
[12:20] be temporal and they haven't learned yet
[12:22] fun will be temporal but there are
[12:24] principles that you get in here that are
[12:26] not just for life but some of them are
[12:28] Eternal principles
[12:31] Eternal principles you know the old
[12:34] saying if you give a man a fish you'll
[12:36] feed him for a day but if you teach them
[12:39] how to fish you'll feed them for a
[12:42] lifetime so but we tend to be people we
[12:45] must not laugh at the children because
[12:47] we tend to be people who look at
[12:49] temporal things and gravitate to
[12:52] temporal things just like the teenagers
[12:54] let's not laugh at the teenagers that's
[12:56] just their age sometimes but we all as
[12:59] adults can stay teenagers spiritually
[13:01] that we live every day on temporal
[13:04] things come on now if you can't say Amen
[13:07] say
[13:09] ouch I want everybody to listen I want
[13:11] my teenage boys teenage girls everyone
[13:13] young and old to listen because these
[13:14] are important things we must say God I I
[13:18] love certain things in life but I must
[13:20] connect with you the Eternal God through
[13:22] Jesus Christ the
[13:24] word and nobody else can connect like
[13:26] that nobody else can bring that to you
[13:29] nobody else can do it's you saying Lord
[13:32] I need Christ in my life I need to find
[13:35] the Eternal God I need eternal
[13:39] life you have to say Lord I need eternal
[13:42] life the Rich Young Ruler has I need
[13:45] eternal life and guess what he had all
[13:48] the blessings coming to him from
[13:49] following the Commandments I did what my
[13:52] mom and dad said I did it I've done all
[13:55] the Commandments Jesus said have you
[13:56] done the Commandments he said I've done
[13:57] all the Commandments from my youth I've
[13:58] done all and guess what his life was
[14:01] blessed his life was blessed prosperous
[14:04] a lot of money because he followed the
[14:07] principles of God and yet the whole time
[14:11] he's hungry for eternal
[14:14] life so now you have the blessings of
[14:16] following the Commandments and still a
[14:18] yearning for the Eternal on the inside
[14:20] and he came to Jesus he said I've done
[14:22] all these things but he said what do I
[14:23] got to BU how can I get eternal life
[14:26] he's still lacking the person well he's
[14:28] standing in front of the right
[14:31] person you you're young people you're in
[14:34] front of the right preachers you're in
[14:35] front of the right people they're Christ
[14:37] in flesh presenting eternal life to you
[14:39] every service the rich was in front of
[14:43] the right person he was the person of
[14:44] eternal life he could give it right
[14:47] there and he turned it down and you know
[14:50] why nobody can make that decision for
[14:53] you young brother young sister nobody
[14:56] can make that decision for you it's you
[14:58] starting to say I've got a hunger for
[15:00] something more than just doing the
[15:03] Commandments God bless you for doing
[15:04] them thank you for being obedient thank
[15:06] you for not being rebellious God will
[15:08] have certain blessings for you if you
[15:10] how many knows there's a great blessing
[15:12] of even longer days on Earth by honoring
[15:14] and obeying your parents it's a
[15:16] principle of Life honor obey your
[15:18] parents and you you have long days upon
[15:21] the Earth can you say Amen but eternal
[15:23] life and the person of eternal life is
[15:25] something different and the person is
[15:28] presented to you all the time through
[15:30] the preachers I'm standing before you
[15:32] not as just a oversized preacher I
[15:35] present eternal life to you every
[15:38] service but you will not go into eternal
[15:41] life or have it until you accept it for
[15:43] yourself and say I and you'll never
[15:45] accept me say I need this if everybody
[15:49] else fails and my friends in the church
[15:51] go the The Way of the world I need God I
[15:55] need the eternal life in me every young
[15:58] man man every young woman every person
[16:00] has to come to that person to say do I
[16:03] have this person of eternal life in my
[16:06] life every person must answer that
[16:09] respond to
[16:10] it so it is spiritual immaturity and so
[16:14] what God does for you temporal is a
[16:17] wonderful thing but what he puts in you
[16:20] is eternal I'm going to say that again
[16:22] what God does for you is temporal what
[16:26] he puts in you is eternal
[16:29] many Christians that put hopes in things
[16:31] that fade away they tend to fade away
[16:34] themselves this life will disappoint you
[16:37] people would disappoint you there's
[16:38] nothing that's trustworthy in this world
[16:41] except the love of
[16:43] God it'll disappoint you all the time
[16:46] this life is full of more
[16:47] disappointments now than I've ever had
[16:49] in my life I can't look to the what I
[16:52] see I have to look at the Unseen that my
[16:55] God will never disappoint me can I get
[16:57] an amen God will never disappoint me
[17:00] this is the past that's the
[17:04] future our past binds us from the
[17:09] blessings and the positiveness of the
[17:11] future is anybody listening this morning
[17:14] we can't live life in a rear view mirror
[17:17] and looking and trying to drive in a
[17:18] rear view mirror and we look in the back
[17:20] and we have accidents back there and how
[17:22] many's ever went by and you're trying to
[17:25] how many know what a Gawker is we're all
[17:27] done it haven't we
[17:29] and so the traffic's moving very slow
[17:31] cuz gawkers because an accident happened
[17:33] we want to see who is it what well first
[17:35] of all is it a family or something had
[17:37] happened to our family my wife you know
[17:39] she always calls when she hears the
[17:40] sirens out front or out there she's
[17:42] calling all the kids where are
[17:46] you but we we drive by an accident we oh
[17:49] Lord that happened to them the car is
[17:51] all messed up and they're looking around
[17:52] and it slows the traffic down so we but
[17:55] sometimes people drive they're not
[17:56] looking where they're going do you know
[17:57] there's been incidents where where they
[17:59] crash cuz they're watching another
[18:02] crash does anybody know what I'm
[18:04] preaching this morning and then there's
[18:06] the rear view meal driving is you're
[18:08] looking oh going going going going going
[18:13] and we
[18:16] laugh but we have many Christians who
[18:20] live their constant Christian Life in
[18:23] the rear view
[18:26] mirror their hearts are locked and
[18:29] stuck in what happened in the
[18:32] past nothing can be viewed right in the
[18:35] future at all because they're they're
[18:37] looking back there at the accidents at
[18:41] the thing oh maybe it's some pretty
[18:43] scery maybe it's a good thing but most
[18:45] of it is something that happened and
[18:47] you're looking back there trying to
[18:48] constantly drive and we know any decent
[18:51] driver can't do that you can't properly
[18:54] be alert for the future of where you're
[18:56] going when you're looking in the past
[18:59] Paul deals with it in Philippians when
[19:01] he says forget those things which are
[19:03] behind press toward the mark of the high
[19:06] calling in
[19:07] Christ and the only way you can press
[19:10] toward the mark of what God has for you
[19:12] in the future is that if you forget all
[19:15] of your past how do I do that brother
[19:17] Paul first of all you ask forgiveness
[19:20] for what you've done wrong and you bring
[19:22] it under the blood of Jesus Christ no
[19:25] matter how dastardly it was some of you
[19:27] have done some pretty dastardly
[19:29] things but you could ask God forgiveness
[19:32] and still not get past it God could
[19:34] forgive it and you haven't forgiven your
[19:38] past and you haven't forgiven yourself
[19:41] now I know how our brain works because
[19:43] Satan has access to our brain and he's
[19:46] going to bring up our past to defeat us
[19:48] but you can quickly dump that out wait a
[19:50] minute that's under the blood wait what
[19:53] what are you doing I don't have to think
[19:56] about that anymore that's under the
[19:57] blood but most of the time we we linger
[20:00] and it comes
[20:02] back then we get angry and then can you
[20:05] imagine somebody's just dwelling on
[20:07] something that something was done
[20:08] dastardly to you you're dwelling on it
[20:10] and dwelling on it and then then you how
[20:14] many's ever got angry at your kids or
[20:16] angry at somebody in the house and you
[20:19] realize later you got to apologize
[20:21] because you weren't really angry at what
[20:22] they're doing you were just irritated at
[20:24] everything they're doing because you're
[20:26] mad at something from the past or
[20:28] something somebody else did to you
[20:30] people are smiling right
[20:34] now and you're taking it out on the kids
[20:36] you're taking it out on your wife you're
[20:38] taking it out on your husband it's
[20:40] nothing worse than living with somebody
[20:42] who a mate that lives constantly in the
[20:45] bitterness of the past because husbands
[20:48] get a lot taken out on them wives get a
[20:51] lot taken out on them there's nothing
[20:54] worse than it's rough it's like sit down
[20:57] this is under the BL blood forgive God
[20:59] forgives us forgive ourselves accept
[21:03] God's pardon accept his forgiveness and
[21:06] then forget it let's forget it and move
[21:08] on and then we forgive ourselves for
[21:11] what we' done wrong and then we forgive
[21:14] others who have done us wrong you can't
[21:17] have
[21:18] faith unless you forgive Jesus said that
[21:22] a Son of God has faith that if you say
[21:24] to this mountain be removed and cast in
[21:27] the say see it'll be done that's the
[21:29] kind of Faith that's in the potential of
[21:31] a son and daughter of God you can move
[21:34] mountains the next verse says and when
[21:37] you pray that you want to pray a prayer
[21:39] of faith when you stand praying forgive
[21:43] how many you want more faith what other
[21:45] scriptures Faith cometh by hearing
[21:46] hearing by the word of God it's good to
[21:48] stay in the word of God that's that
[21:49] builds it as well Faith cometh by
[21:51] testimonies people give testimonies that
[21:53] raises our faith my God can heal cancer
[21:55] God can raise the dead and there's some
[21:57] faith preachers that tell testimonies
[21:59] and that we rise in our faith to believe
[22:01] anything's possible God can use those
[22:03] things but if you had all of that and
[22:05] you had an unforgiving Spirit you cannot
[22:07] come into perfect faith without
[22:10] forgiveness you can't grow you can't go
[22:13] beyond it can you say Amen you lack and
[22:16] if you really say I want faith I want
[22:18] faith I'm a teenager I want more faith
[22:20] that I can move mountains that I can do
[22:23] exploits that I can do better things
[22:24] that I could that I could live a closer
[22:26] life to the Lord without forgiveness you
[22:28] can't move into greater Faith
[22:31] forgiveness is the power that comes in
[22:33] our lives to release the past and
[22:35] release things so that you can be lock
[22:37] locked in the past not blocked and
[22:40] locked here in the past but it releases
[22:42] you from the past and now you can pursue
[22:45] reconciliation and the future and what's
[22:48] next for you you can't go there without
[22:51] true forgiveness and releasing it and
[22:54] washing it away you might not even feel
[22:57] worthy that you can move mountains I'm
[22:59] not on that level at all well God's word
[23:01] says you
[23:02] are God's word says you
[23:04] are you can't get there you can't build
[23:06] faith if you live in the past can't get
[23:08] there with an unforgiving Spirit people
[23:11] limit this forgiveness thing and they
[23:14] they make it mechanical and they make it
[23:16] complicated and we got to figure it all
[23:19] out and God never asked us to do that
[23:21] there's a flood of his blood and his
[23:23] forgiveness flowing from Calvary and it
[23:26] flows right down to his sons and
[23:28] daughters right into their soul and when
[23:31] it floods through us then it spreads and
[23:33] we release it to everyone in our lives
[23:37] don't explain it don't try to complicate
[23:40] it I forgive and I release it in Jesus
[23:44] name because I want to go on with the
[23:46] Lord somebody say praise the Lord this
[23:49] morning from the temporal from the
[23:52] temporal that see that's the past is the
[23:55] temporal but he say we're looking to the
[23:57] Eternal can you you say amen and sons of
[24:00] God need to move from temporal things to
[24:02] Eternal things morning even good things
[24:04] of this life will pass do you know that
[24:07] even good things that we have here
[24:10] they'll pass because this that's a
[24:11] different life we know bad things pass
[24:14] and Fade Away we know that but the let
[24:17] me say it this way and this may surprise
[24:19] you I don't know but the very best
[24:21] things that this life can offer is still
[24:26] temporal is that true the very best that
[24:30] this life could offer is still temporal
[24:34] we must receive the person of eternal
[24:36] life we must live looking beyond what we
[24:38] see why first why why do we look beyond
[24:42] what we see and not be caught up in the
[24:44] temporal things of the world well
[24:47] because number one this world is
[24:49] scheduled for
[24:53] Destruction it's on the
[24:56] schedule judgment and destruction are
[24:59] coming and fire is coming said that God
[25:02] gave a covenant which is the most
[25:03] powerful thing he can give his people
[25:05] but one of the things when he destroyed
[25:07] this Earth with water one of the reasons
[25:09] two things we look at when we look at a
[25:11] rainbow is that we knew we know not by
[25:13] reading the Bible but we know that he
[25:16] destroyed the Earth by water because he
[25:17] gave this rainbow for the first time so
[25:20] we can look at a rainbow how many's ever
[25:21] seen a
[25:23] rainbow we can look at that and see two
[25:25] things when God said it was going to
[25:26] rain to Noah it did and destroyed the
[25:29] Earth by water it happened even science
[25:33] proves that the whole world Earth was
[25:35] covered with water but the other thing
[25:37] we see in the rainbow is the grace of
[25:39] God because he said when you see that
[25:41] rainbow I'll never destroy the Earth
[25:44] again with water that's his promise he
[25:46] made it and he's never done it again and
[25:48] he never will do it because God keeps
[25:51] his promises well we got a lot another
[25:53] little prophecy in there it says I will
[25:55] destroy the Earth with fire now if he
[25:57] did it with water then if he did it that
[25:59] time he's going to do it again this
[26:01] Earth don't get caught up in this earth
[26:04] and the businesses and everything else
[26:05] and that's your whole thing because it's
[26:07] all going to be gone someday this Earth
[26:10] is fitted for Destruction if you get
[26:12] your mind too caught up in what you're
[26:14] doing in business and not an internal
[26:17] perspective then you'll be caught in
[26:19] this thing and worried about this all
[26:21] the time and down by this all the time
[26:23] you have to remember this is all going
[26:24] to fade someday it's all going to be
[26:26] gone someday this Earth is fitted for
[26:28] Destruction 1 Peter
[26:30] 3:10 but the day of the Lord will come
[26:32] as a thief in the night in the which the
[26:34] heavens shall pass away with great noise
[26:36] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[26:38] heat it's prophesied this this world is
[26:41] scheduled for destruction of fire why
[26:44] you saying that to us just in case you
[26:46] didn't know your job your house
[26:49] everything you see here even this
[26:51] church will come under that
[26:56] fire
[26:58] and he says this will be burned up and
[27:00] then he comes to verse 11 and says
[27:01] seeing then that all these things shall
[27:04] be dissolve all things will be dissolved
[27:08] that pretty much covers it
[27:11] all if we know that they'll be dissolved
[27:14] what manner of persons ought ye to be in
[27:17] all holy conversation and godliness how
[27:21] should we be living Bound by the
[27:24] depression of temporal things of people
