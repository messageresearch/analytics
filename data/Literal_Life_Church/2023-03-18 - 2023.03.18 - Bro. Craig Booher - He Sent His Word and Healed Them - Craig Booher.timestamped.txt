[2:15] you all
[2:16] Psalms 107 and let's start with verse 8
[2:19] tonight
[2:21] and just say Amen when you find your
[2:23] places
[2:26] oh that men
[2:28] would praise the Lord for his goodness
[2:31] and for his wonderful Works to the
[2:33] Children of Men
[2:35] for he satisfieth the longing soul
[2:39] and he filleth the hungry soul with
[2:41] goodness
[2:42] such
[2:43] has sit in darkness
[2:46] and in the shadow of death
[2:48] being bound in Affliction in an iron
[2:52] because they rebelled against the words
[2:54] of God condemned the kinds counsel of
[2:57] the most high
[2:59] therefore he brought down their heart
[3:01] with labor and they fell and there was
[3:04] none to help
[3:05] then they Cried unto the Lord in their
[3:08] trouble and he saved them out of their
[3:10] distresses
[3:12] he brought them out of darkness in the
[3:14] shadow of death and he break their bands
[3:17] asunder
[3:18] all that men would praise the Lord for
[3:21] his goodness
[3:22] and for his wonderful Works to the
[3:24] Children of Men
[3:25] for he hath broken the gates of brass
[3:28] and he has cut the bars of iron and
[3:31] sunder
[3:32] fools because of their transgression and
[3:34] because of their iniquities are
[3:36] afflicted their soul abhorth all manner
[3:39] of meat and they draw near unto the
[3:41] gates of death and then they cry unto
[3:43] the Lord in their trouble and he saveth
[3:46] them out of their distresses hear this
[3:49] he sent his word and he healed them
[3:54] and delivered them from all their
[3:58] destructions
[4:00] praise the Lord I want to preach tonight
[4:01] on he sent his word and healed them
[4:05] God bless you you can have your seats
[4:07] this evening
[4:10] I want to continue my thought on faith
[4:12] tonight
[4:14] and brother Branham said the biggest
[4:17] curse there is among the Full Gospel
[4:20] people
[4:21] he said is that people are afraid
[4:25] he said God has made the provision but
[4:28] you are afraid to take God's word for it
[4:31] he said if we were not afraid tonight
[4:34] then you would take your healing by
[4:36] faith and know that God has promised it
[4:39] and the thing would go Plum away from
[4:41] you he said that's the reason I'm a
[4:44] Believer in healing I know that if you
[4:47] can get away from the scare and Love
[4:49] Takes its place something is going to
[4:52] happen
[4:54] he said there's only two faculties that
[4:56] govern the human one of them is Faith
[4:59] and Faith brings results
[5:02] he said and the other is fear and there
[5:05] is no value to it at all he said faith
[5:09] is of god fear is of the devil fear
[5:13] makes you weary and makes you wonder he
[5:16] said but it does you no good to weary
[5:18] and no good to wonder he said if you
[5:21] knew you were going to die tomorrow
[5:23] morning he said fear would do you no
[5:26] good he said but Faith you say what good
[5:29] would Faith do he said Faith would write
[5:32] your pardon he said to be weary don't be
[5:36] scared he said have faith and believe
[5:41] when we fear fear will hinder us being
[5:45] scared will hinder us it will hinder us
[5:48] from our blessings and God cannot work
[5:50] with us when we're afraid to take him
[5:53] out his word but when we believe God the
[5:56] spirit of God can move Among Us and and
[5:59] faith can begin to move and God will
[6:01] work with you then
[6:04] the Pharisees read the same scriptures
[6:07] Jesus read
[6:09] the Pharisees had the same Bible that
[6:13] Jesus had but brother Branham said the
[6:16] Pharisees could not make the word work
[6:19] because they did not practice what they
[6:23] read
[6:24] well
[6:26] he said now he said I want to see
[6:29] somebody that's got faith and will take
[6:32] God in his word we need somebody that
[6:35] will practice what they believe
[6:38] because faith without works is dead
[6:43] brother Branham said and I one time I
[6:46] went into a cave and and there was these
[6:48] little bats everywhere and and they said
[6:50] these bats have lost their eyesight
[6:52] because they had dwelt in darkness so
[6:56] long that they did not neither eyes
[6:58] anymore so it started birthing little
[7:02] bats and generations to come without
[7:05] eyesight altogether
[7:07] and brother Branham said if we were to
[7:09] take somebody's arm and strap it up
[7:11] behind them you just let 25 years go by
[7:14] pretty soon that arm will become dormant
[7:17] because you are not using it or if you
[7:21] yourself was locked in darkness your
[7:24] eyes would eventually become dormant
[7:26] because you are not using the god-given
[7:29] senses that God gave you and so brother
[7:32] Branham said that's the same with faith
[7:34] if the church is not operating and
[7:37] exercising faith in the word of God he
[7:40] said that faith will go dormant and the
[7:43] church will go powerless Hallelujah see
[7:46] it's the our very faith that contacts
[7:49] God it is your faith that brings the
[7:51] blessing of God to you tonight and we
[7:54] need to know how to use our faith we
[7:57] need to exercise our faith can you say
[7:59] Amen because he said faith without works
[8:04] is dead
[8:07] let's turn in our Bibles real quick to
[8:09] James chapter 2.
[8:12] James chapter 2
[8:15] and we'll start with verse 14.
[8:20] everybody love the Lord
[8:23] praise the Lord
[8:26] James chapter 2 verse 14.
[8:30] what does it profit my brethren
[8:34] though a man say he has faith
[8:37] and has not works
[8:39] can Faith save him
[8:43] if a brother or sister be naked or
[8:46] destitute of daily food and one of one
[8:48] of you say to them depart in peace be
[8:51] warmed and filled
[8:53] notwithstanding you give them not those
[8:55] things that are needful for the body
[8:57] what does it profit
[8:59] so faith if it hath not works is dead
[9:03] being alone
[9:04] yeah man say thou has faith and I have
[9:09] Works show me thy faith without thy
[9:12] works and I will show thee my faith by
[9:15] my works
[9:16] thou believest there are one God he said
[9:19] thou do us well for Devils believe and
[9:21] tremble he said but wilt thou know o
[9:26] vain man
[9:27] that faith without works is dead
[9:31] I like that he said oh vain man that
[9:35] means a man that is void of
[9:37] understanding it means he's empty
[9:40] opposed to full it means that his hands
[9:43] are empty and he's fruitless in what
[9:45] he's saying and he's false he cannot
[9:48] produce what he's talking about because
[9:51] he cannot produce the faith that he
[9:55] speaks
[9:57] so he says that faith without works is
[10:00] dead it's like a man with no spirit
[10:04] wow
[10:08] praise the Lord
[10:10] brother Brigham said people right now
[10:12] anyone can be free of their disease
[10:15] they can be free of their afflictions he
[10:18] said but we're scared to make a start
[10:22] we're scared that that and he said what
[10:24] happens is we're this is and I'm reading
[10:27] the quote he said we're waiting for God
[10:29] to come down and pull you out he says
[10:33] but God does not deal with us like that
[10:36] he said you're the one that's got to
[10:39] make a step
[10:40] you're the one that's got to step out in
[10:42] faith can you say Amen brother Brandon
[10:45] was given a gift not to heal the people
[10:48] but to stimulate Faith to believe God
[10:53] that's the only access that we have and
[10:55] if we can believe God it can change our
[10:58] situation it can take a sick man and
[11:01] make him well it could take a depressed
[11:03] man and make him free in Christ
[11:07] faith without works is dead
[11:10] the Bible said by faith Noah moved with
[11:14] fear
[11:15] because if you've got faith it'll move
[11:17] you
[11:18] if you believe you'll act upon that
[11:21] faith
[11:22] and so Noah believed it was going to
[11:24] rain
[11:25] Noah believed the judgments of God was
[11:28] coming
[11:29] so Noah moved with fear
[11:32] and the Bible said that he's he started
[11:35] preparing an ark to the saving of his
[11:37] household he was looking to the Unseen
[11:40] because faith comes by hearing God told
[11:43] him I'll destroy this world
[11:46] and Noah feared God the Bible said he
[11:49] was moved but fear brother Branham said
[11:51] you can't fear God unless you believe
[11:53] God
[11:56] are we Believers tonight
[11:58] so Noah by faith moved with fear and
[12:02] began preparing he grabbed a hammer
[12:05] and he started working on an ark
[12:09] praise the Lord
[12:11] and and there's you know Noah could not
[12:13] be a secret believer
[12:16] this isn't going to happen I mean he
[12:18] he's faith God wants him to display to
[12:21] the all unbelieving world
[12:24] don't you be afraid to stand for God
[12:27] don't you be afraid to say God has sent
[12:30] a message in this hour
[12:33] don't be afraid to believe in angels and
[12:35] visitation of angels and and the same
[12:38] Promises of God are all ye and amen
[12:44] Hallelujah
[12:46] and so Noah he said I believe it and he
[12:50] went out he didn't wait for the approval
[12:52] of the Bishops or of his own family but
[12:55] Noah's faith faith has an effect upon
[12:58] others
[12:59] and you better start believing right now
[13:01] it'll have a fact upon your neighbor
[13:04] Noah started working Papa what you doing
[13:08] God is going to send a deluge
[13:11] and his faith was contagious
[13:14] and the more that Noah believed it began
[13:17] to affect his children
[13:20] and the children began to believe
[13:23] I don't think we ought to indoctrinate
[13:25] our children I think we ought to believe
[13:27] God and they will see our faith and the
[13:30] fruits of our faith
[13:35] so Noah couldn't hide his faith
[13:39] you know did you know brother Branham
[13:41] said he sold his farm
[13:44] he was a very prosperous farmer and he
[13:47] said he sold his farm to get the money
[13:50] to build this Ark
[13:54] so now Noah looks ludicrous he's given
[13:58] up everything that he's worked for in
[14:00] life
[14:01] looks like an absolute fool
[14:04] turned in his investment sold this house
[14:06] got him a tiny little apartment and he
[14:09] invest in all this wood
[14:13] and he's he's got to do every bit of it
[14:16] himself
[14:19] and he goes out he's chopping Timbers
[14:21] and his sons come under the influence of
[14:24] Daddy's faith and they start helping him
[14:27] pack the Timbers and and little by
[14:29] little he's building this structure
[14:33] and then I was talking to Wesley just
[14:36] yesterday he was telling me how they had
[14:39] to beat the pitch out of another tree
[14:41] how many ever heard brother random say
[14:42] that they would cut another tree down
[14:44] and they would beat that tree till the
[14:46] pitch came out of it because the Lord
[14:49] said pictured inside and out
[14:52] and so you know how much pitch that they
[14:55] had to beat out of trees to cover that
[14:57] Ark
[15:00] and so God said it's going to rain in 15
[15:02] years of beating trees you would think
[15:05] I'm going to give up but Noah's Faith
[15:07] held
[15:09] but not just Noah's Faith held his faith
[15:13] was a testimony to every unbeliever in
[15:17] that area
[15:21] beating trees and beating the pulp out
[15:24] of them and that's why Christ they beat
[15:27] the pulp out of Christ in order to seal
[15:30] us with the Holy Spirit
[15:32] [Applause]
[15:33] Christ is our Ark
[15:38] but see Noah had works
[15:41] to go with his faith
[15:44] Noah believed it how many believe it as
[15:48] it was in the days of Noah so shall it
[15:51] be
[15:53] and so what a testimony
[15:55] now brother Branham said God has a
[15:58] principle and I want everyone to listen
[16:00] he said in order to see a miracle
[16:03] how many believe in miracles
[16:06] he said in order to see a miracle though
[16:10] you must obey the word first
[16:14] you must act upon the word first
[16:17] and then the miracle will follow
[16:21] everybody with me
[16:24] now notice Moses was the same way God
[16:26] told him I'm going to deliver the people
[16:29] Moses had to act upon the word
[16:33] before the Miracles would take place
[16:37] see it's obedience God wants obedience
[16:40] to the word of the Lord and you got to
[16:43] be willing you got to be willing to make
[16:46] a step you got to be willing to step out
[16:49] and claim it and act upon what you claim
[16:55] Moses made a step
[16:58] you see like how he threw down the
[17:00] serpent and it turned into a serpent and
[17:02] so it turned through I'm sorry threw
[17:04] down the staff and it turned into a
[17:06] serpent and then brother Branham said
[17:08] then the miracle followed
[17:12] when he came to the Red Sea
[17:14] he said Lord what do I do he said speak
[17:17] and go forward
[17:19] so notice he had to make a step and then
[17:23] the Red Sea moved back
[17:25] if you believe God God will make a way
[17:28] for you
[17:29] you've got to take a step you've got to
[17:32] reach out by faith and watch the Devils
[17:34] move back watch sickness move back watch
[17:37] the enemy move back God Will Make A Way
[17:43] but you've got to take a step of faith
[17:47] this is God's order this is God's way
[17:49] he'll make a way for you
[17:52] he'll make a way when you're hungry
[17:54] he'll make a way in Temptation he'll
[17:57] make a way when everyone turns her back
[17:59] he'll make a weigh-in trial
[18:02] Hallelujah
[18:04] Moses makes a step the sea goes back he
[18:08] gets on the other side and that's when
[18:09] his problems start
[18:12] he had less problems with Pharaoh than
[18:15] he did with his own church
[18:19] that came from heaven
[18:23] he had more of a fight with his own
[18:25] church than he did Pharaoh's Army
[18:30] and that's the way the devil does it's
[18:32] to destroy your faith
[18:35] he brings trouble in the church he
[18:37] brings trouble among the youth he he
[18:40] criticizes the pastor criticizes the
[18:43] music criticizes everyone it's the devil
[18:46] that's doing it
[18:47] [Applause]
[18:52] Moses first fight was the easiest
[18:56] because God just swallowed him
[18:59] then 40 Years of dragging a complaining
[19:02] Church
[19:03] this is where our faith
[19:06] needs to come forth and manifest when
[19:10] things aren't going right when things
[19:13] are sideways when everything is negative
[19:16] [Applause]
[19:18] Hallelujah
[19:19] [Music]
[19:21] when it's rainy every day complaining
[19:24] every day this is when we need faith
[19:27] [Applause]
[19:30] yourself
[19:35] you see we got to make a step
[19:38] brother Branham said when they stepped
[19:40] out how many babies would be born to two
[19:42] million people in one night
[19:43] [Music]
[19:47] coming and knocking on his door and
[19:51] you pray for me pastor
[19:54] how's he going to clothe
[19:56] there's no Walmarts in that desert
[20:00] how is he going to clothe 2 million
[20:02] people can you imagine the diapers
[20:08] he's got to feed him
[20:11] now this is an act
[20:14] faith
[20:19] Hallelujah
[20:23] but a journey of a Thousand Miles begins
[20:26] with one step
[20:30] lord it's better that I die than dwell
[20:33] with this people
[20:36] they were hungry so God sent them Quail
[20:40] right out of the ocean
[20:42] can you imagine the millions of quail to
[20:45] feed two million people and they and
[20:48] they didn't have arrows and machine guns
[20:50] they would just reach out and catch them
[20:52] out of the air
[20:54] how many believe in the miracles of god
[20:57] I believe if you're longing for an
[20:59] answer that the Lord will send it right
[21:01] through this building
[21:02] and all you got to do is reach out and
[21:04] get a hold of it or we'll believe in
[21:07] people
[21:08] they get hungry and God would drain the
[21:11] bread out of heaven and but they would
[21:13] come out and smell like Panera Bread
[21:17] have their coffee with God's angels food
[21:20] that was sent down from heaven
[21:22] amen
[21:26] no you say Lord how are you going to do
[21:28] it he does it in his own way but Moses
[21:30] job was to believe God
[21:33] we're going to the promised land
[21:36] God don't want us to know how he's going
[21:38] to do it he just wants us to believe
[21:40] that he will do it and he wants us to
[21:43] take a step of faith
[21:46] because God will honor his word
[21:50] get that word on the inside of you and
[21:53] God will obligate himself to that word
[21:58] our job is to believe it with all of our
[22:00] hearts
[22:02] you know Elijah
[22:04] at the brook of cedarth
[22:06] you know he had a mighty Showdown
[22:09] and the Lord said get to the brook of
[22:10] cedarth and he said well I have a place
[22:13] prepared
[22:15] and brother Branham said that God was
[22:16] faithful to his servant because he stood
[22:18] with the word of the Lord
[22:20] and God just rained down bread from
[22:23] heaven and God would just let him drink
[22:25] from the river what a beautiful place
[22:29] of quiet separation unto God
[22:32] and I imagine that was probably some of
[22:35] Elijah's best days up there in the
[22:38] presence of the Lord with no battles
[22:41] how many would love to have that no bad
[22:43] you know what no battles equals no
[22:46] people
[22:49] I know everyone else is the problem and
[22:52] we're waiting for them to get perfected
[22:55] come on folks
[22:59] but God wasn't going to leave it that
[23:00] way Lord he was just strengthening him
[23:02] for another battle
[23:04] pretty soon it dried up because
[23:07] everything in this world is temporary
[23:11] everything in this world is temporary
[23:14] you say I'm having a Revival they'll be
[23:17] coming ups and downs and negatives and
[23:20] positives there'll be trials but faith
[23:22] will take you to every one of them
[23:26] pretty soon it dries up Lord are you
[23:28] moving me sometimes your trials is not
[23:31] God's punishment but he's moving you to
[23:33] the next post but you've got to take a
[23:36] step instead of trying to hold on to
[23:38] yesterday's Revival you've got to say
[23:41] Lord bring me another one
[23:43] God says I have Revival for you but it's
[23:47] right through the Red Sea it's right
[23:49] through the trials
[23:53] Hallelujah
[23:55] and he said Lord
[23:58] my Revival's dried up
[24:01] and God said I've got a preparation made
[24:03] for you
[24:05] he said what is it Lord
[24:07] he said I have commanded a widow woman
[24:10] to sustain thee
[24:12] praise the Lord I've been living out on
[24:15] this ground for months on end I am
[24:17] looking for a rich with a woman
[24:21] with fellow feather tip feather pillows
[24:26] and
[24:27] Victorian decoration
[24:30] a little old lady that gives me a room
[24:32] and
[24:33] oh praise the Lord
[24:36] I imagine he hot footed it right down
[24:38] the mountain and what a disappointment
[24:42] when he gets to her gate and there is
[24:45] one meal between her
[24:47] and death
[24:52] God's timing is perfect
[24:54] because when we obey a miracle is going
[24:57] to happen
[25:00] no I I'm sorry Elijah knew God enough to
[25:03] know when you get into situations like
[25:06] that something wonderful he said well
[25:08] the harder it gets is the more we ought
[25:11] to believe
[25:13] the darker it gets the more faith we
[25:16] ought to apply
[25:17] because that's when the miracle takes
[25:20] place
[25:21] here's a little woman just barely enough
[25:23] strength and he said that's the one that
[25:26] you're is going to feed you and sustain
[25:28] you
[25:31] and the spirit of God comes upon him
[25:33] because he obeyed God's word
[25:36] he said woman bring me a drink
[25:39] and she went to move and he said and a
[25:41] little cake
[25:43] for I'm hungry
[25:45] and she looked and she said sir
[25:48] I'm a given heart I would give you all
[25:51] that I have
[25:52] got one meal between me and death
[25:55] and me and my son are gonna die
[26:00] he said but bring me one first
[26:05] for thus saith the Lord
[26:10] for thus saith the Lord
[26:13] you will be sustained until the trials
[26:16] are over
[26:18] Faith Comes
[26:20] by hearing the word of the Lord
[26:24] she knew this was the man that called
[26:27] for a three and a half year drought
[26:29] she knew his words had weight behind
[26:32] them
[26:33] so she went in by this is an incredible
[26:36] Act of Faith now God put her in a place
[26:39] where he gave her thus sight the Lord
[26:42] now she must act
[26:46] God brings the saith the Lord and places
[26:49] it upon us and then we must act
[26:55] we must act
[26:56] [Music]
[27:00] God puts us in our dilemma
[27:04] and something struck her heart
[27:07] I believe is the spirit of God
[27:10] and she went in and she took her last
[27:12] meal and her last oil
[27:15] and she dumped it out and began to make
[27:18] a cake
[27:19] and she brought it to the man of God you
[27:22] want to talk about faith and works
[27:24] together
[27:25] she brought the very thing that would
[27:28] sustain her son she gave like Abraham
[27:31] gave
[27:33] he said go back in and make you one she
[27:36] said I used it all obey the word of the
[27:38] Lord she went back in and she poured and
[27:42] when you pour out God is filling you
[27:45] back up
[27:47] every time you empty out God will come
[27:50] back and fill you up again
[27:54] take a step of faith
[27:56] empty out tonight I'm tired of my
[27:59] unbelief I'm emptying my attitudes
[28:04] let God come and fill you up again
[28:08] how many need a Revival in their lives
[28:10] how many need to feel a God God is here
[28:13] to give it to you but you must act upon
[28:16] your faith
[28:18] Hallelujah
[28:20] Hallelujah
[28:22] she was sustained
[28:24] by thus saith the Lord
[28:27] how beautiful
[28:29] God is searching for someone
[28:32] to act
[28:34] upon his word
[28:37] all of us can claim to be Believers but
[28:40] what good is our faith if it doesn't
[28:42] have works
[28:45] if I am sick I am commanded to act upon
[28:48] God's word
[28:50] is that the word of God
[28:52] now notice God loves to see our reaction
[28:57] the reason he did that was to test her
[29:00] faith
[29:01] so God put a stumbling block in the way
[29:06] I knew there was nothing to it
[29:11] and so it was just an intellectual
[29:12] conception the whole time
[29:15] but brother Branham said God cannot use
[29:17] a coward
[29:18] he said if the first trial comes and we
[29:21] run God cannot use you
[29:24] wow
[29:27] remember Martha
[29:32] you know brother Branham spoke of Martha
[29:36] how she called for the Lord and and he
[29:38] just ignored her
[29:41] he did it on purpose
[29:43] he was going to test her faith
[29:45] four days late and he comes walking in
[29:49] and here he comes and she looks up and
[29:51] sees him coming and there's no doubt the
[29:53] devil came and said you made him a robe
[29:55] you made him meal after meal you got
[29:58] kicked out of your church for that man
[30:02] and you believed he was a real preacher
[30:07] and now here he comes four days late
[30:09] it's like he didn't even care he knew
[30:12] about it
[30:15] but brother Branham said this was not
[30:16] her attitude
[30:18] she ran up and she said Lord
[30:21] if you had been here my brother would
[30:24] had not died
[30:26] and the spirit of God began to move and
[30:28] he said I am the resurrection in the
[30:30] life
[30:31] he that believeth in me though he were
[30:33] dead yet shall he live he that liveth
[30:34] and believeth in me shall never die
[30:36] believeth now this
[30:39] she said I know that you are the Son of
[30:43] God brother Branham said something
[30:45] happened by those words because God test
[30:49] our action and reaction when she said I
[30:53] believe that you are the Son of God he
[30:56] said the great cogs of God begin to turn
[31:00] he said her faith was the little Cog on
[31:03] Earth God's faith and power locked in
[31:07] with her cogs and it's began to generate
[31:10] the power of the Resurrection
[31:13] if our faith will lock in with God
[31:16] tonight it'll produce healing it'll
[31:19] produce Joy it'll deliver the captive
[31:25] and it was her attitude
[31:27] that begin to move the power of God and
[31:31] as soon as she said it he said where
[31:33] have you laid him
[31:37] I bet and they brought him to the place
[31:40] and the most incredible thing happened
[31:44] when he gets there
[31:46] he looks at Mary and Martha
[31:49] just you know just 100 pounds 100 pound
[31:52] girls
[31:53] and said roll away the stone
[31:58] why did he roll away this time why
[32:01] brother Brandon said he could have
[32:04] he walks on water he turns water to wine
[32:06] he stops storms
[32:11] we're always told
[32:16] take away the stone
[32:18] in other words brother Branham said that
[32:20] tells us that you have got to do
[32:23] something
[32:24] God is all-powerful healing his great
[32:28] coffers his Heavens are full
[32:30] His blessings are full tonight
[32:33] God's glory is fall tonight
[32:36] but he tells her you roll away the stone
[32:41] because you have something to do God
[32:44] wants to see you act God wants you a
[32:47] part of his economy God wants you a part
[32:50] of redemption
[32:54] and you've got to do some rolling away
[32:56] if you want a Revival tonight start
[32:59] rolling away your unbelief
[33:01] start rolling away all the devil's lies
[33:05] you've got something to do
[33:11] I don't know how long it took them to
[33:13] move that stone
[33:16] and they look over in England in a hand
[33:22] finally they get it off
[33:25] and about the time they made their
[33:27] feeble effort the spirit of God comes
[33:31] he said Lazarus
[33:33] come forth
[33:36] and a man that was dead four days
[33:39] his Spirit gone his blood cold
[33:42] worms through his body
[33:45] his cells came back together
[33:48] his Spirit came back into that body
[33:51] he stood to his feet and obeyed God
[33:54] and he walked out as a witness of the
[33:57] resurrection and the life
[34:03] he's the same God tonight
[34:07] but he wants us to roll away the stone
[34:10] there are stones in our way that we have
[34:13] not been able to get rid of for years
[34:14] and you're like God get rid of this for
[34:17] me he said you've got to do it
[34:19] you're the one that's got to separate
[34:22] yourself from all unbelief you're the
[34:25] one it's got to make us step towards I'm
[34:28] not going to baby you I'm not you're a
[34:30] child of God
[34:32] and I want you to make a move towards me
[34:36] brother Branham said Jesus now
[34:38] watch this he said if you want a miracle
[34:41] you've got to roll away the stones
[34:50] now my opening scripture
[34:53] was their souls were suffering and they
[34:57] cried to the Lord in their trouble
[34:58] everybody stay with me I'm getting to
[35:00] where I want to go
[35:02] the Bible said he sent his word
[35:05] and he healed them
[35:08] and delivered them from their
[35:10] destructions
[35:11] how many believe there's power in the
[35:13] word of God
[35:15] but if he sent his word how did he send
[35:19] it
[35:22] we know that there's many ways that he
[35:25] said it in the Bible First he would
[35:27] always send his word
[35:29] by a prophet
[35:31] brother Branham said that every time
[35:33] people got in trouble God always sent
[35:36] the word to deliver them
[35:39] God always send them the word in every
[35:42] case he said God will send a prophet and
[35:44] the word comes to the prophet and he
[35:46] said that's what delivers the people
[35:48] always because he is a god of Might he
[35:51] is a god of healing he is a god of
[35:54] Miracles and he said it takes the word
[35:56] of God to meet the challenge how many
[35:59] have confidence in the word of God
[36:01] brother Bradham said in every age it's
[36:04] the same Cry of the spirit he that hath
[36:06] an ear let him hear what the spirit
[36:08] saith unto the churches if you're a
[36:10] Christian you must get back to what the
[36:13] spirit is teaching the word for this
[36:16] hour every Messenger to every age will
[36:19] preach that word every Revival will be
[36:22] because men got back to the word of God
[36:25] again he said every time a people
[36:28] backslid the remedy was come back to the
[36:31] word the word is the answer for your
[36:34] healing for your joy for your peace
[36:38] God sent his words
[36:40] [Music]
[36:42] but how shall they hear
[36:45] without
[36:47] a preacher
[36:50] Faith cometh by hearing
[36:53] the word of God
[36:55] the Bible said that the preaching of the
[36:58] Cross is to them that perish foolishness
[37:01] but unto us which are saved
[37:04] it is the power of God
[37:07] everything that God could do for us has
[37:11] already been done at Calvary
[37:14] the price has been paid at Calvary and
[37:18] the preacher's job is to point you to
[37:21] Calvary and say there is your Victory
[37:23] there is your healing there is your
[37:25] salvation
[37:27] I want to talk about the power of God's
[37:30] word
[37:31] because a preacher when he preaches the
[37:34] spirit of God begins to Get Out Among
[37:37] the people
[37:38] this is not a communistic gathering they
[37:41] have plenty this is not some leftist a
[37:44] political show this is the house of the
[37:47] Living God
[37:48] and we are talking about the Eternal
[37:51] Word of God that has creative power
[37:53] behind every promise
[37:58] is that right
[37:59] brother Branham said God's word is a
[38:03] gift
[38:05] are you hearing me
[38:07] you realize the words that I'm speaking
[38:09] are not the words of a man they're the
[38:11] words of God
[38:13] and God's word to you is a gift
[38:19] praise the Lord but he got that
[38:22] now he said
[38:23] that the word is a conductor
[38:27] and then when the word is preached the
[38:30] holy spirit will follow this word
[38:34] how many believe that
[38:35] he said wherever the word is preached
[38:38] your pastor will preach he said all of a
[38:40] sudden
[38:42] across the building will go the Holy
[38:44] Ghost
[38:46] the word is the conductor of the spirit
[38:49] because the word is preached and the
[38:52] spirit follows it wherever the spirit
[38:55] follows the word and the Holy Ghost
[38:58] confirms the word
[39:02] you know how you come into the house of
[39:03] God and you feel that lift
[39:05] how many feel it in these meetings you
[39:08] feel the presence of God lifting that is
[39:10] a supernatural thing
[39:12] and it ain't brother Craig it's God's
[39:14] word and I know if I will be faithful
[39:17] and preach the word of God the holy
[39:20] spirit will be all over this
[39:21] congregation
[39:23] how many believe that and brother
[39:25] Branham said now the reason that we
[39:28] preach like this if I am preaching
[39:30] healing and quoting scriptures and
[39:33] preaching it gets you in the spirit to
[39:36] think about healing brother Branham said
[39:39] I must get you thinking that way in
[39:42] order for the Holy Spirit to move upon
[39:44] you
[39:47] that's what he says direct quote and he
[39:49] said now you let the mind which is the
[39:52] word the mind of Christ come in you he
[39:55] said and when you do and begin thinking
[39:58] God's thoughts it brings God's blessing
[40:01] and his power
[40:03] [Applause]
[40:06] praise the Lord he said it'll bring new
[40:08] life
[40:09] it'll bring Resurrection it'll bring new
[40:12] thoughts it'll bring a new person it'll
[40:15] bring death to life
[40:19] he said now why did God
[40:21] give us the great power of the Holy
[40:24] Spirit I give you power to tread upon
[40:26] the heads of serpents
[40:29] he said the reason God gave us this
[40:32] great power of the Holy Spirit he said
[40:34] is so we would operate the work of God
[40:37] by the energy of the Holy Spirit
[40:40] and the branch we know that the branch
[40:43] produces the fruit not the vine but the
[40:46] branch must receive the power of the
[40:48] vine and if we will yield ourselves to
[40:51] the Holy Spirit it will energize us to
[40:55] produce the fruits of God
[40:58] brother men have said every time in
[41:00] history that the Holy Spirit ever struck
[41:03] the church he said without fail a
[41:06] Revival of signs and wonders and
[41:09] miracles they healed the sick in every
[41:11] age they continued in every age when
[41:14] they let the Holy Spirit take control of
[41:17] their being
[41:18] he said Martin Luther prayed for a man
[41:21] and he was healed he said John Wesley
[41:23] prayed and
[41:25] 240 cases of sick was healed
[41:29] he said Dwight Moody did not even preach
[41:32] the principles of Divine Healing he said
[41:34] he didn't even teach it but when he
[41:37] would preach the gospel the Holy Spirit
[41:39] would begin to move over the audience
[41:41] and people would go home absolutely
[41:44] healed even though he did not preach it
[41:47] he said because the holy spirit is the
[41:51] Healer
[41:54] it was an automatic thing when the
[41:57] spirit of the Lord would move he said
[41:59] the holy spirit is the Healer and he is
[42:01] here to energize every heart and every
[42:05] life and to bring you into the promises
[42:07] of God
[42:09] how many know that it's for the front
[42:12] row the second row the third row all the
[42:14] way to the back row the holy spirit is
[42:17] here
[42:18] to energize our life and Victory
[42:22] to energize our faith to bring
[42:25] understanding of God's Eternal words
[42:31] how by the foolishness
[42:34] of preaching
[42:36] how shall they hear
[42:39] without a preacher
[42:42] and how can there be a preacher except
[42:44] God sends him
[42:50] Hallelujah
[42:51] I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus
[42:53] Christ
[42:54] for it is the power of God unto
[42:57] salvation
[42:58] to them
[43:00] that believe
[43:05] how many say Lord come by my way
[43:09] so when you receive the word of the Lord
[43:11] that is being preached from the pulpit
[43:13] and you take that word into your heart
[43:15] that makes you a conductor
[43:19] it makes you a direct copper line
[43:23] a conductor is something that transfers
[43:26] energy
[43:28] Hallelujah
[43:30] in a Believer is a copper wire
[43:33] and the the enlightening power of
[43:36] almighty God is looking for somebody
[43:39] that will believe
[43:41] so he can bring forth a healing or a
[43:44] resurrection
[43:45] he's looking for a copper wire
[43:48] he can pull all of that current down to
[43:51] the believer and out of that believer
[43:54] will come forth the glory of God
[43:57] that's why Jesus told Martha if you will
[44:00] believe you will see the glory of God
[44:04] we must come back to the word and
[44:07] believe it by faith
[44:11] now brother Branham said
[44:14] he said Mr ardenbright come out of here
[44:16] hear ye hymn 1957. he said Mr
[44:19] argenbright told me that seven has
[44:22] already been healed while I was
[44:24] preaching
[44:26] that is the original way
[44:31] that's the way of doing it
[44:34] preaching the word
[44:36] and the people getting healed by the
[44:40] preaching
[44:41] God sent his word
[44:44] to heal them
[44:47] now brother Branham said that is the
[44:49] first and initial way
[44:51] he said but then because we can be kind
[44:54] of thick-headed he will send gifts to
[44:57] try to help bolster that
[45:00] but God's first and original way
[45:03] he said is for the preaching of the word
[45:06] to bring it to you and you're to receive
[45:09] it
[45:11] Hallelujah
[45:12] do you love the Lord
[45:15] and brother Branham was talking about a
[45:18] minister uh Tommy Osborne how many
[45:20] remember Tommy Osborne
[45:23] is amazing brother Branham talked about
[45:25] him he said now Tommy there were many
[45:27] with gifts in their hands and and you
[45:29] know all kinds of oils and different
[45:31] things it was unscriptural but he said
[45:33] Tommy he said there is no fanaticism in
[45:36] Tommy whatsoever
[45:38] matter of fact Tommy was birthed out of
[45:41] other brother brenham's meetings and he
[45:42] come up and said brother Brandon do you
[45:44] think that I have a gift of healing he
[45:46] said you would have known it by now
[45:48] he said brother you don't need a gift of
[45:51] healing he said every preacher has the
[45:53] general commission to pray for the sick
[45:56] he said sit under that oak tree which
[45:58] was FF Bosworth he knew more about
[46:00] Divine Healing than any man in the land
[46:02] he said drink from him and go out and
[46:05] pray for the sick and he did that
[46:08] brother Tommy became so efficient and so
[46:11] gifted at preaching the word that he
[46:15] would not even form prayer lines now
[46:17] we're not against prayer lines because
[46:19] God heals my prayer lines he heals my
[46:21] anointing of oil he heals my music he
[46:24] heals in many ways so it's not to say
[46:27] God does it one way he is the Healer of
[46:29] all of our diseases
[46:31] but brother Brandon was talking about
[46:33] God wanting to heal by his word
[46:37] and he said Tommy Osborne would preach
[46:40] to 20 000 people and bring the word into
[46:44] such a place that the devil had no place
[46:46] to stand
[46:48] he said notice Jesus never used his
[46:51] power he used his word because the word
[46:54] will defeat the Devil any place
[46:58] any time
[47:01] I think this would be a good time to
[47:03] draw the sword on your enemy and cut the
[47:06] devil's head off that is tormenting you
[47:08] and affecting you
[47:11] the word of God
[47:13] will defeat the Devil any place
[47:17] any time
[47:19] under any circumstance
[47:23] it is the word
[47:25] that destroys our enemy
[47:27] it is the how many believe Jesus
[47:29] destroyed the works of the devil when he
[47:33] did it he did it by the word
[47:35] [Music]
[47:37] he sent his word
[47:40] and delivered
[47:42] the woman caught in adultery
[47:45] delivered the woman with a blood issue
[47:49] delivered the blind man delivered Legion
[47:51] who was out of his mind
[47:54] he sent his word
[47:56] and he healed them
[47:59] he said Tommy Osborne's a dear friend of
[48:01] mine young Christian use Mighty works
[48:04] all over the country not a streak of
[48:06] fanaticism he said he uses the
[48:08] scriptures and don't even have a prayer
[48:10] line
[48:13] once again don't say brother Craig don't
[48:15] believe in prayer lines I've done a many
[48:17] and I'll continue to do them till Jesus
[48:19] come
[48:20] our Prophet taught us this
[48:23] and he still had prayer lines
[48:26] but I'm trying to tell you that he sent
[48:28] his word
[48:30] it is written
[48:34] and God wants us to believe his word
[48:39] so it's not the hands of an evangelist
[48:43] it's not the great ministry of a popular
[48:46] person you're laying your hands or
[48:48] Christ is laying his hands on you
[48:52] you are looking to Calvary where God
[48:54] wanted you to look
[48:56] Hallelujah
[48:58] and when a man takes God at his word it
[49:01] destroys the
[49:07] do you know all Heaven is behind the
[49:10] word of God
[49:12] do you know what I'm preaching to you
[49:14] tonight
[49:16] can deliver any affliction
[49:19] can deliver from any problem
[49:22] how many believe that
[49:25] all power of God is behind this word
[49:29] brother Branham said there was a 17 year
[49:31] old girl that had come to the Tabernacle
[49:33] he said she was ate up with cancer just
[49:36] a 17 year old girl he said I never
[49:38] touched the child
[49:40] he said I went he said the devil wanted
[49:42] to cut her life short he said I never
[49:44] touched the child I went to the pulpit
[49:46] and I began to preach the word and the
[49:49] word healed her so instantly she rose up
[49:52] completely well
[49:55] Hallelujah he said she believed it
[49:59] and the word went forth
[50:01] and the word is God's life and the word
[50:05] is God's power and the word is God's
[50:08] promise and the word heals the sick
[50:12] whoo
[50:15] brother Branham said if we are sick we
[50:17] need to open up our channels to receive
[50:20] the word of God into our hearts
[50:22] he said in Durban South Africa 30 000
[50:25] people he said uh delivered at one time
[50:29] he said I never touched one of them
[50:32] he said they looked and they believed
[50:36] remember the Roman soldier
[50:40] or Centurion he said I'm not worthy that
[50:43] you come under my home
[50:46] I'm not worthy that you stepped foot
[50:49] well that that speaks
[50:52] because here's a man that actually
[50:54] admitted to the Lord that he was not
[50:56] worthy
[50:57] but yet he had a request and many of
[50:59] times when we go to the Lord with a
[51:01] request we actually forfeit our blessing
[51:04] because we are not worthy
[51:09] but here was an unworthy man that said
[51:11] if I ever receive anything from God
[51:15] I have got to ask
[51:17] and the Lord says ask that your joy may
[51:20] be full you say I'm so defeated ask God
[51:24] for power to overcome
[51:27] I just feel so bad ask God for his grace
[51:30] to to rise up above your trials
[51:34] Lord I know that I am not worthy
[51:38] but I also know that you're bigger than
[51:41] every devil and that devil is your enemy
[51:43] and I know sickness must bow and I know
[51:46] diabetes must bow and I know uh cancer
[51:50] must bow
[51:52] all I'm asking is to hear your word
[51:55] because I know there is Authority behind
[51:58] your words
[52:00] would you speak to your enemy and free
[52:03] that child
[52:08] that word is being preached to you
[52:10] tonight
[52:11] it is the word of the Lord
[52:14] brother Branham said this was the
[52:17] Gentile way
[52:20] that we believe
[52:22] his word
[52:24] brother Branham said it is the highest
[52:27] form of faith
[52:34] the Gentile way is to believe the word
[52:36] of God
[52:39] my word shall not return void
[52:43] but it will accomplish
[52:45] that where I sent it
[52:49] how many believe that
[52:51] God sent a message on this day
[52:54] and the world is rejected it but somehow
[52:56] you have responded
[52:58] it's God accomplishing
[53:01] turning our hearts back to the faith of
[53:04] the fathers how many knows God's word
[53:06] has an effect
[53:08] is it affecting you has it turned your
[53:11] heart back has it made you long to see
[53:13] the real or the real Church rise again
[53:17] do you long to see the new heavens and
[53:20] the new Earth and to live like we were
[53:23] created to live
[53:26] Hallelujah
[53:28] all power say all power
[53:31] all power and authority is behind this
[53:34] word if you will believe and act upon it
[53:39] Hallelujah
[53:42] he sent his word
[53:45] and he healed them
[53:47] you know many times
[53:50] I have seen in preaching many times I've
[53:53] seen Justin preaching not even on Divine
[53:55] Healing the Holy Spirit move out just
[53:58] this kind of preaching in an atmosphere
[54:00] like this and the spirit of God move and
[54:03] somebody testify of their healing
[54:06] I don't know if he's here and I don't
[54:08] want to embarrass him if he's here I
[54:09] know brother Joe C was one
[54:11] just sitting under the presence of God
[54:13] and God went right to him and he said
[54:15] brother Craig I never had a bulldog
[54:17] Faith he said God gave it to me
[54:20] praise the Lord
[54:22] and I've seen real afflictions healed
[54:26] but then I see him lose it
[54:29] and the reason they lose it is because
[54:32] they're expecting God just to heal them
[54:35] with no effort on their half
[54:37] or they don't know how to keep the devil
[54:39] away
[54:41] so I have seen many receive their
[54:43] healing and it's it's visible and then
[54:45] they lose it
[54:49] see but God wants to heal even in an
[54:51] atmosphere like this he wants your faith
[54:54] to be in him
[54:56] he wants you to set your sights upon him
[55:00] how many believe that
[55:02] and so many times when we're in a
[55:04] meeting like this you'll feel quickening
[55:06] power
[55:08] you'll feel Faith rising up in you
[55:11] and it's God
[55:12] it's God dealing with you I had it
[55:16] happen myself the preaching of the word
[55:17] was going and and I had vertigo and God
[55:20] said take me at my word and the devil
[55:22] said don't do it you're going to make a
[55:24] fool of yourself and the Lord said take
[55:26] me at my word
[55:29] and I testified before the whole church
[55:31] God healed me in that seat
[55:33] and God dropped a faith and God met me
[55:36] there when I confessed to my healing and
[55:39] the Lord delivered me
[55:42] two years later he came back I was
[55:45] preaching at a church he came back and I
[55:47] felt the whole place start spinning and
[55:49] the devil goes oh I got you now I'm
[55:52] about ready to walk out to preach
[55:55] and at first I'm like oh no
[55:58] and then something rose up in me
[56:01] and said the same God that healed me
[56:04] keeps me healed
[56:06] he went away and I never dealt with it
[56:08] again
[56:08] [Applause]
[56:12] Elijah said thus saith the Lord
[56:15] it shall not rain until I call for it
[56:19] stomped off into the Wilderness had a
[56:21] three and a half year Revival with God
[56:25] then he comes back and he has a showdown
[56:27] with the unbelievers and we talked about
[56:28] this last night that the reason that he
[56:30] stopped the heavens was to bring the
[56:32] people to repentance
[56:34] and after he was done with them they
[56:37] were repenting
[56:39] and God made a promise if they would
[56:41] repent he would open up the heavens and
[56:44] pour out his blessings because God wants
[56:47] to bless his people
[56:50] and Elijah went up to the mountain and
[56:53] he told geeza go out there and see if
[56:55] God is moving he went out and he looked
[56:57] and there was nothing
[56:59] oh man
[57:01] nothing in this revival meeting brother
[57:03] Paul
[57:05] he goes back and said nothing he said oh
[57:07] no no no we ain't stopping that click go
[57:09] back
[57:11] okay went back and said no I'm certain
[57:13] this time there's absolutely nothing
[57:14] there's less than the first time I went
[57:18] he said go back seven times
[57:21] and Elijah had his head in his knees and
[57:23] he's praying
[57:25] and gehaza went and looked and he saw
[57:27] something coming out of the water he'd
[57:29] look like the a man's hand
[57:33] he came back and said I see something
[57:36] but it ain't very much
[57:37] just like a little hand
[57:40] brother Branham said that was the first
[57:42] sign
[57:43] of God beginning to move on his promise
[57:47] he said the very first thing that that
[57:49] little nudge that you'll feel while the
[57:51] preaching of the word is going forth
[57:53] it's the size of a man's hand
[57:56] but if you won't run away and say Lord I
[57:59] receive that and I want that blessing
[58:01] the power of God will begin to multiply
[58:04] and God will heal you and deliver you
[58:06] and pour out his deluge
[58:10] the very first move of God
[58:13] the very first inspiration of God
[58:17] you need to reach out and say I accept
[58:19] it
[58:20] I'm accepting my healing is God moving
[58:23] on you I'm accepting my Deliverance

[1:00:56] daring face
[1:00:58] come on Peter
[1:01:01] come on Peter
[1:01:04] Jesus comes walking in on her troubled
[1:01:07] sea
[1:01:08] I know that some of us have real trials
[1:01:11] in our lives
[1:01:14] and God will do it just to test your
[1:01:17] reaction
[1:01:19] and the disciples are out in a troubled
[1:01:22] sea a storm is blowing things are out of
[1:01:24] control the cells are ripped and they
[1:01:27] look out in the darkness and these
[1:01:29] weren't little mud puddles brother
[1:01:31] Branham said they were White Caps going
[1:01:33] up and down 20 feet high
[1:01:36] and he said when they looked out they
[1:01:38] saw Jesus and when he made a step he
[1:01:41] said the whole White Cap would go flat
[1:01:45] and there's coming they're like ah a
[1:01:48] spook a spook
[1:01:50] now if you read your Bibles there's no
[1:01:52] spooks
[1:01:57] go ahead brother
[1:02:02] Branham said they were afraid they were
[1:02:05] afraid
[1:02:06] of the only thing that could help them
[1:02:10] I would have loved to see this
[1:02:14] it's out of control where's the Lord
[1:02:18] where's the Lord he's watching you
[1:02:20] matter of fact he's coming to fetch you
[1:02:24] hello
[1:02:26] the Sails are blowing the place is
[1:02:29] shaken the devil is howling and you look
[1:02:32] out when you think you're gonna sink and
[1:02:34] you see something coming don't be afraid
[1:02:36] of it that's your deliverance he sent
[1:02:39] the word
[1:02:45] the White Caps are moving flat on every
[1:02:48] step
[1:02:50] and they said a spook a spooky said
[1:02:52] don't be afraid
[1:02:54] God speak to the hearts of the people
[1:02:56] tonight
[1:02:57] don't be afraid it is high
[1:03:01] amen they knew that voice
[1:03:04] and they all got to looking
[1:03:06] and Peter was just the kind of guy we
[1:03:09] all like because he's quick at the
[1:03:11] trigger and he does things that we would
[1:03:13] probably do
[1:03:15] and Peter looked and said
[1:03:19] he said didn't he come
[1:03:21] Lord
[1:03:25] let me come
[1:03:28] and the Lord's out there he said
[1:03:30] come
[1:03:32] Come Peter
[1:03:34] and Peter's like
[1:03:38] and he starts coming
[1:03:41] and Jesus says come
[1:03:43] come
[1:03:45] here yes I praise the Lord pray and
[1:03:47] brother Branham said that water is 20
[1:03:49] foot
[1:03:51] but now he's walking
[1:03:53] why is he walking because the word
[1:03:56] commanded him to walk
[1:03:59] and he's walking and he took a step of
[1:04:01] faith
[1:04:02] Because he believes the word that spoke
[1:04:05] to him
[1:04:06] the same word that said come says you're
[1:04:09] healed says you're free says you're gods
[1:04:15] the same word that said Peter come says
[1:04:19] come unto me
[1:04:20] lay down your burdens lay down your
[1:04:24] complexes lay down all the unbelief
[1:04:31] he's requiring something out of Peter
[1:04:34] for Faith Peter
[1:04:36] I'm not going to pick you up and carry
[1:04:38] you around you're a Son of God you're a
[1:04:42] daughter of God

[1:04:55] Jesus is telling you come
[1:04:58] step out on faith step out to your
[1:05:01] healing step out for your deliverance I
[1:05:04] sent my word
[1:05:07] and as long as he believed
[1:05:10] he walked
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:18] and then
[1:05:23] oh
[1:05:25] oh Lord
[1:05:30] God help me the whole scene changed
[1:05:35] as soon as he let fear come in
[1:05:40] and just before he was ready to expire
[1:05:43] a great hand reach forward
[1:05:46] took hold
[1:05:49] him up
[1:05:53] you did so good Peter I'm proud of you
[1:05:57] no
[1:05:58] why in the world

[1:06:06] you know the word that I'm preaching to
[1:06:08] you do you know that you could walk on
[1:06:12] water
[1:06:13] that this word is just as solid if God
[1:06:18] says you can be filled with the Holy
[1:06:20] Spirit then you can be filled with the
[1:06:23] Holy Spirit
[1:06:25] if the Lord says you are healed I want
[1:06:28] you to believe I am healed
[1:06:35] come on Peter
[1:06:37] God's calling you
[1:06:40] he says come
[1:06:42] up by my word
[1:06:45] I don't need a pillar of fire I don't
[1:06:47] need a lightning flash I need God's work
[1:06:49] come
[1:06:52] you don't have to be in that trial
[1:06:54] forever
[1:06:55] you don't have to live under privilege
[1:06:57] forever
[1:06:58] God's telling you to come
[1:07:01] take a step of faith
[1:07:03] step out on God's promise have faith in
[1:07:06] God

[1:07:19] and if you have a need do not walk out
[1:07:22] of this building without reaching up and
[1:07:24] saying Lord
[1:07:26] I'm going to put some Works behind my
[1:07:28] faith
[1:07:29] I realize I gotta move away the stone

[1:07:38] your faith lay dormant

[1:07:47] how many believe he's the same yesterday
[1:07:49] today and forever how many believe he
[1:07:51] never changes

[1:07:55] out of this building and bring our loved
[1:07:58] ones back
[1:07:59] bring our loss back
[1:08:02] I believe he could bring the prodigal
[1:08:04] back
[1:08:05] he can fill your children with the holy
[1:08:07] spirit all things are possible
[1:08:12] we got to be a believing people
[1:08:14] I think this word we ought to believe
[1:08:17] God he can heal blinded eyes he can take
[1:08:20] cripples and make them straight again he
[1:08:23] can bind the Brokenhearted come on Peter
