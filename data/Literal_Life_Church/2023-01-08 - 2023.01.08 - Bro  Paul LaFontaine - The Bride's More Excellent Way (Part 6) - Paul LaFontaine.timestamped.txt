[0:00] Corinthians 13 if you'd like to read
[0:02] with me one verse there and then back in
[0:04] First Corinthians 12 we certainly
[0:06] appreciate all the Christmas gifts and
[0:08] cards that you sent I love to get
[0:10] pictures of the family put them all up
[0:11] on the house there I'd love to keep them
[0:13] throughout the year and thank you for
[0:16] your lovely words and kind kind comments
[0:18] and we love you all too very much and
[0:21] appreciate that we can serve the Lord
[0:23] together as a family it's just I love
[0:26] you very much appreciate and my most
[0:28] exciting thing is to take the Lord's
[0:30] supper together this afternoon we
[0:32] certainly would enjoy that praise the
[0:34] Lord First Corinthians 13 and verse 6
[0:38] Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoiceth in
[0:42] the truth and I'll just read where this
[0:44] now Divine love divine Capstone love
[0:47] rejoiceth not in iniquity it never
[0:50] rejoices in iniquity but it does Rejoice
[0:53] over something it rejoices it gets happy
[0:57] in the truth and when truth prevails and
[1:00] when honesty is there and the truth
[1:02] comes out that's where we Rejoice not in
[1:05] lies not in iniquity not when someone
[1:08] Falls not when someone makes a mistake
[1:10] there's no rejoicing and divine love of
[1:12] that but when someone finds the truth
[1:14] and we know that the truth shall set you
[1:17] free and so that is divine love and
[1:21] action that we rejoice in truth and and
[1:24] that truth prevails
[1:26] just add a scripture in First
[1:28] Corinthians 12 the chapter before verse
[1:30] 25 and verse 26 as Paul is talking about
[1:34] uh the body and how it works together
[1:36] and the Natural Body and then he types
[1:39] it with the spiritual body of Christ
[1:41] verse 25 and verse 26 that there be no
[1:44] Schism no division that there be no
[1:47] division in the body but that the
[1:50] members should have the same care one
[1:53] for another and whether one member
[1:55] suffer all the members suffer with it or
[1:59] one member be honored all the members
[2:01] Rejoice with it so there can't be any
[2:04] jealousy if someone suffers we don't
[2:06] gloat over that we're not happy over
[2:08] that they got what they deserved no we
[2:11] suffer with them so there's a point to
[2:13] be made here and if I don't get to it
[2:15] again today there's a point to be made
[2:16] there if somebody else in the body is
[2:19] suffering then you're suffering
[2:21] that's how much we're part of one
[2:22] another
[2:23] if someone gets honored then we're all
[2:25] honored and we rejoice in that
[2:28] that's how much we're tied together now
[2:29] you can act separate next I'm a I'm an
[2:31] island to myself all these other things
[2:33] but that's not what the word teaches the
[2:34] word teaches by the Holy Ghost I'm tied
[2:37] to a body of Christ somebody suffers I'm
[2:39] suffering that's why I pray for them
[2:41] that's why I lift them up that's why I
[2:43] encourage them because if they're
[2:44] suffering I'm suffering
[2:46] if they're going through something I
[2:48] want I don't want to come down with them
[2:50] but I want to lift them up and I want to
[2:52] feel the pain of their suffering because
[2:54] they're a part of me I'm a part of them
[2:56] amen I'll say it like my dad used to say
[2:59] it you didn't put me in the body of
[3:01] Christ so you can't take me out
[3:03] you didn't put the person sitting next
[3:05] to you in the body of Christ so you
[3:07] can't take them out
[3:08] so he used to say it this way as much as
[3:12] some of you might don't not want me or
[3:13] someone else you're stuck with me
[3:17] you stuck with me amen so learn to love
[3:21] one another praise the Lord and so I'll
[3:23] just read that again he says there be
[3:25] that there be no division oh God
[3:27] hastened the day when there would be no
[3:29] division in the body of Christ but that
[3:32] the men members should have the same
[3:34] care one for another and whether one
[3:36] member suffer all the members suffer
[3:38] with it and one member be honored and
[3:40] all the members Rejoice with it father
[3:44] we pray you'll bless your word and may
[3:46] you drop it in our hearts by Revelation
[3:48] the meaning of these things so deeply
[3:51] that love would manifest in our lives
[3:53] Divine Love Not Human love not natural
[3:56] love not a surface love but the Divine
[3:59] love that flows from Calvary we commit
[4:02] the service to you in these precious
[4:03] souls in Jesus name amen God bless you
[4:07] may be seated
[4:08] last time we talked about the the more
[4:10] excellent way and this is the more
[4:12] excellent way part six hopefully we'll
[4:14] finish this up next Sunday but last time
[4:17] we talked about the more excellent way
[4:19] that Paul talked about it is the way of
[4:21] divine love and the last thing we
[4:22] dropped off of which I don't feel like
[4:25] we had plenty of time to cover the
[4:27] subject but the last time we learned
[4:30] that God's Divine love in US does not
[4:33] keep record of wrongs so I want you to
[4:35] remember that because that's probably
[4:36] one of the key things of all these
[4:39] things that we've been preaching on that
[4:40] that that that love does not keep
[4:43] records of wrongs love does not hold a
[4:46] grudge for years but love forgives and
[4:49] the reason why this is an important one
[4:51] to re to to refresh your memory on is
[4:54] because this is the one I think we
[4:56] struggle with the most many times and
[4:58] that is we are bound when we hold on to
[5:00] a grudge of someone else we remain bound
[5:03] that person may be go on but we're not
[5:06] released we're not we're not bounced so
[5:08] forgiven this releases us and can
[5:10] release the other person as well so it's
[5:13] important that we don't keep records of
[5:15] wrongs and to clean the Slate of others
[5:18] just as God does with us to clean the
[5:21] slate and to forgive and to give others
[5:24] a fresh chance
[5:25] to release the wrongs through the true
[5:29] forgiveness of God to release wrongs
[5:31] through the truth you can't fully
[5:34] release them unless you come through the
[5:36] channel and the Forgiveness of God but
[5:38] when you bring your life through the
[5:39] Forgiveness of God then it releases the
[5:42] wrongs that others have done to you it's
[5:45] to wash the past history away to delete
[5:48] the past to click delete on our past
[5:52] steps with people it is very important
[5:55] to study this again and go back and look
[5:57] at it and it needs more than just a
[5:59] study I'll tell you this needs a real
[6:02] Supernatural manifestation in all of our
[6:04] lives
[6:05] some of us become professionals at
[6:08] keeping the score
[6:10] fresh in our minds of the wrongs that
[6:13] people have done to us
[6:16] some of us have it locked and lodged and
[6:18] it's it's blocked there in our memories
[6:21] and we're not even making any efforts to
[6:23] Let It Go
[6:25] but it gets lodged there I'm holding
[6:27] that 16 years ago they said that to me
[6:30] and they put me down and they criticized
[6:32] me and we hold it right there my friend
[6:34] I'm encouraging you if you stay there
[6:37] the other person isn't bound you're
[6:39] bound
[6:40] you're the one that's Bound in the the
[6:43] locked up of your mind of what that is
[6:45] and the Bible tells us love does not
[6:47] keep records of wrongs love pushes
[6:51] delete can you say Amen how do I do it
[6:53] brother Paul just ask God to help you
[6:55] just delete it just push delete erase
[6:58] the debts of others can you say Amen how
[7:01] can we not do that when God has done it
[7:03] for us when he pushes delete of our sins
[7:05] it's gone forever in the sea of God's
[7:08] forgetfulness how is it that we can't do
[7:10] that for others you can't move on in
[7:13] Victory if you continue to hold on to
[7:15] these things and keep them in your mind
[7:17] and keep a record and keep these the
[7:19] history of people there was one married
[7:22] man that said to his friend you know
[7:24] every time my wife and I get into a
[7:26] conflict she gets historical
[7:28] and his friend said
[7:31] his friend said
[7:33] you don't mean historical you mean she
[7:36] gets hysterical when you have an
[7:37] argument she gets hysterical he said no
[7:40] I mean historical what do you mean by
[7:43] that is that when we get in this
[7:45] argument she rehearses anything I've
[7:47] ever done in the whole history of our
[7:50] marriage
[7:52] so I'm right she gets historical now I
[7:55] know none of you know anybody like that
[7:57] or your wife or husband you don't know
[7:59] anybody like that but listen for me I'm
[8:02] going to be honest if you're not I'm
[8:03] going to be honest is that this is a
[8:05] real thing is that when people get angry
[8:07] about something the the whole history is
[8:10] right there and they bring it all out
[8:12] and I don't know why we do but it's like
[8:14] a weapon
[8:16] it's to get back at somebody I don't
[8:18] know anything else to say right now but
[8:20] I'm mad and all of a sudden I've got a
[8:22] whole list of what you've done then I'm
[8:24] taking you from after your salvation all
[8:26] the way through bang bang bang bang bang
[8:28] bang bang bang bang bang bang and then
[8:31] the person listening is like he's being
[8:33] shot bang bang bang bang
[8:36] she gets historical not hysterical now
[8:38] you might have some wipes that actually
[8:39] get hysterical at the same time
[8:43] and I don't know why they use the
[8:45] example for a wife but let's not get on
[8:46] the wives okay the wives had an
[8:48] incredible memory for things that's
[8:50] happened in the history but and I don't
[8:52] know psychological what all that is but
[8:54] listen now I'm not speaking on that I'm
[8:56] saying every one of us have a certain
[8:58] level of keeping the history of somebody
[9:01] come on people say amen
[9:04] and this is what the Bible teaches us
[9:06] the gifts because we don't have a right
[9:08] to hold the history of somebody if
[9:10] they've asked forgiveness or if they
[9:12] haven't we don't know we pray for them
[9:13] that God will bring them to that but we
[9:16] are bound when we hold a grudge towards
[9:18] somebody
[9:19] so I'm bringing that back up again
[9:22] because this part of divine love we
[9:24] really need to ask God to help us to
[9:27] project this it will set us free it'll
[9:29] set others free as well because we are
[9:32] giving them a chance and we're erasing
[9:35] their history so that we're giving them
[9:38] a chance for a fresh start
[9:41] I wanted to mention that again now today
[9:44] in the part of divine love that's spoken
[9:46] of in verse
[9:49] verse six we want to study this a little
[9:52] bit because this this meaning today of
[9:54] divine love really gets to the heart of
[9:57] what makes us really glad or what
[10:00] pleases us there are things that make us
[10:03] happy and please us and and things that
[10:05] make us rejoice but as Christians there
[10:08] are other things that should make us
[10:09] rejoice and one thing in Divine love in
[10:11] the Christian walk is that we should
[10:13] never have something that triggers
[10:14] happiness in us when someone else Falls
[10:17] we should never have something in this
[10:19] that triggers a joy in us that swells up
[10:22] when someone else Falls or someone gets
[10:24] payback for what they've done wrong this
[10:27] should not be a part of us this is not
[10:29] part of the love of God and it shouldn't
[10:31] be a part of us can you say Amen this
[10:34] gets to the heart of what we really
[10:37] should be rejoicing over and this is
[10:40] what triggers us to rejoice and it says
[10:43] that it never rejoices in iniquity but
[10:47] it rejoices in the truth the source of
[10:51] our happiness joy and rejoicing and
[10:53] pleasing and and and gladness should be
[10:57] truth prevails
[11:00] truth comes to somebody truth is
[11:02] preached truth is lived can you say amen
[11:05] that's why when when we have this world
[11:07] of such uh that's in such a mess and sin
[11:12] is glorified and sexual sin is glorified
[11:15] and living together as couples is
[11:17] glorified it's all okay and people play
[11:20] around with one another and sexually
[11:22] give themselves another before marriage
[11:23] I like to at a wedding emphasize to
[11:26] those there to in the whole world to
[11:29] take something that stayed pure until
[11:31] marriage and kept it that way under
[11:33] God's holiness I like to blast it to the
[11:36] entire wedding ceremony and everybody
[11:37] listening because it's not too often
[11:40] that truth and Holiness get praised in
[11:42] this world
[11:44] everything else gets praised
[11:48] look at these NFL players I'm allowed to
[11:51] say this look at them look at them
[11:53] yesterday all in the games they're all
[11:55] bowing the pictures they're all Bowing
[11:57] in prayer and they're kneeling my son
[11:58] Solomon brought this up Dad did you
[12:00] notice they're all praying for this NFL
[12:02] player that's in the hospital had a
[12:04] heart attack or something last weekend
[12:06] and they're all kneeling for all the
[12:08] games they canceled the game last week
[12:09] after they're all on the my goodness it
[12:11] looked like a big prayer meeting in the
[12:13] stadium
[12:14] and a lot of these guys are just thugs
[12:19] they are they live evil lives they love
[12:22] lives of sexual debauchery it's terrible
[12:25] how they live they're greedy you know
[12:28] 150 million is not enough money for them
[12:31] you know all their lives are full of
[12:33] this and yet there's kneeling down and
[12:34] praying my son Solomon brought it up it
[12:36] was just six or seven years ago when the
[12:39] whole world was criticizing Tim Tebow
[12:41] because he was kneeling at games
[12:44] persecuting for what he did but now it's
[12:46] all it's okay for all these hoodlums if
[12:49] they kneel and pray oh that's so nice
[12:51] all that's so good and so we praise them
[12:53] for all their sinful life and now we
[12:55] praise them for kneeling in prayer but
[12:58] you see now this world's messed up
[12:59] because it always praises the sin all
[13:02] along but it doesn't praise a holy life
[13:05] every day it doesn't praise when truth
[13:08] prevails can you say Amen it doesn't
[13:10] acknowledge the truth it doesn't rejoice
[13:12] in truth but Christians should rejoice
[13:15] when truth prevails not when lies
[13:18] Prevail can you say Amen but when truth
[13:21] comes to a person and changes their life
[13:23] when truth sets somebody free I tell you
[13:26] we ought to be shouting and rejoicing
[13:28] and happy when somebody gets free
[13:31] we shouldn't be happy when someone gets
[13:33] revenge or someone sin is glorified in
[13:36] this world
[13:38] what makes God happy is what we should
[13:41] what makes God happy should make us
[13:44] happy
[13:46] what Grieves God
[13:48] should grieve us
[13:53] talk about a stopping at a gas station
[13:57] in Timbuktu somewhere and you go into
[14:00] the bathroom
[14:02] and it hasn't been taken care of in
[14:04] months and that dirty filthy bathroom
[14:07] and it was used as an example by the
[14:11] prophet one time that that's how sin
[14:14] smells and looks to God
[14:19] and that's the way we should live is
[14:22] that how it smells and looks to God and
[14:25] Grieves them and it comes just as a
[14:27] nasty smell that's how sin should be in
[14:30] this world that's how it should affect
[14:32] us
[14:34] whatever affects God should affect us
[14:36] When sin prevails it should grieve us
[14:38] can you say Amen when everything Turns
[14:40] Upside Down In This World which it has
[14:42] it should grieve whatever makes God
[14:45] grieve should make us grieve but
[14:46] whatever makes God happy should make us
[14:49] happy can you say amen and divine love
[14:52] rejoices in the truth not in the
[14:54] iniquity can you say math what Grieves
[14:56] God should grieve us what makes God
[14:59] happy should make us happy as well and
[15:02] when and I'll get to it at the end of
[15:04] the service but there are seeing things
[15:05] in the scripture that we know makes God
[15:07] happy and makes the Angels happy and
[15:09] whatever that is that's what we want to
[15:11] be rejoicing over as well Divine love
[15:14] does not rejoice and get happy when
[15:16] others fall in sin Divine love whether
[15:19] it's you falling in sin or making a
[15:22] mistake or whether it's other people
[15:24] iniquity is not anything to get happy
[15:26] about if God Grieves that Rebellion then
[15:29] we should grieve at Rebellion whether
[15:31] it's in us or someone else if God is Not
[15:34] gloating that someone got what they
[15:36] deserved do you think God gloats when he
[15:39] brings forth a punishment or a judgment
[15:42] on someone that he's promised to bring
[15:44] and they kept running over God and
[15:46] rebelling towards the word and God had
[15:49] to bring forth his promise that you'll
[15:51] reap what you sow but do you think God
[15:53] gloats in the fact they got what they
[15:55] deserve I can tell you God doesn't gloat
[15:57] in it I can tell you God's not happy
[16:00] with it I can tell you God's not saying
[16:02] they got what they deserved I told them
[16:04] I warned them they give God is not
[16:06] thinking that God is not willing that
[16:08] any should perish
[16:11] God's not willing that anyone should
[16:13] turn against his word in rebellion and
[16:15] he doesn't gloat or rejoice when someone
[16:18] does it his heart is grieved
[16:21] and so God is not gloating that someone
[16:24] get what they deserve and if he doesn't
[16:26] then we should not if God carries
[16:29] through on his judgment and by how many
[16:31] would raise your hands to God is the god
[16:33] of judgment we don't hear that in the
[16:35] church World very much today because
[16:37] we've eliminated all the scriptures
[16:39] about but God being a god of judgment
[16:41] and following through with judgment but
[16:43] we have too many accounts in the Bible
[16:45] that once he gives the warning then he
[16:48] does bring judgment he brought it on
[16:50] Sodom and Gomorrah for their sin he's
[16:52] brought it before and he will do it
[16:55] again he can't let our nation that's
[16:57] resisted God and this world he can't let
[17:00] him get by or he wouldn't be a just God
[17:03] judgment is coming
[17:05] and so so if we look at God now many
[17:08] people misinterpret him and they only
[17:10] say it's only the Grace part God is God
[17:13] full of grace but he's also a god of
[17:15] judgment he's just can you say amen and
[17:18] if he broke his promise and let
[17:19] everybody get by with it when they won't
[17:21] take his path for forgiveness they
[17:24] choose their own way then there has to
[17:26] be a judgment to follow that he warns
[17:27] them and then he God's warning and then
[17:30] judgment that's his pattern warning and
[17:32] then judgment I say to you today if
[17:34] you're listening online if God's warning
[17:36] you over and over again for the life
[17:38] that you're living if God's sinning you
[17:40] are you ought to respond to that warning
[17:42] because that's God's grace to correct
[17:45] you and to warn you
[17:48] you keep turning it down then the Bible
[17:50] shows you come under the judgments of
[17:52] God
[17:53] but I want to say about the judgments of
[17:55] God he carries through on his judgment
[17:58] but the reason that God carries through
[18:01] is not because he wants to
[18:05] it's because he must be just and he must
[18:08] follow his promises if he lets you get
[18:10] by and made a promise I'll warn you then
[18:13] judgment's coming and he didn't follow
[18:14] through we wouldn't have confidence that
[18:16] God keeps his word how can we trust any
[18:18] of this as God don't keep his word but
[18:20] when he says something he follows
[18:22] through
[18:23] so when he says something about judgment
[18:25] he will follow through but he doesn't
[18:27] want to do that he is not willing or
[18:29] gloating that any should perish
[18:32] how many know the scripture in Hebrews
[18:34] God used to be first Peter God is not
[18:36] willing that any should perish and I'll
[18:39] tell you friends that that's in the
[18:40] heart of God why is it in our hearts
[18:42] that I'm not willing to see anybody
[18:45] perish
[18:47] I don't have anything to see anybody I
[18:49] don't care how bad they've been I don't
[18:52] care if they've been in prison I don't
[18:53] care if they've killed someone in our
[18:55] hearts we are not willing to see anybody
[18:58] perish because of that but we look and
[19:01] pray for redemption in a life can you
[19:03] say Amen how many believe in Redemption
[19:05] this morning I believe in Redemption of
[19:07] God I believe the lowest sinner can come
[19:10] to God and be changed
[19:11] [Applause]
[19:13] that's how powerful Redemption is it
[19:15] doesn't matter how low you've gotten God
[19:17] can redeem you God can save you but you
[19:19] got to accept his way you got to give
[19:22] your life completely over to him
[19:26] so now as we get into this a little bit
[19:28] the Greek word for
[19:31] um the Greek word her for rejoicing is
[19:33] uh the Greek word is Cairo
[19:36] Caro c-h-a-i-r-o which means to Rejoice
[19:40] to be glad to be delighted or pleased
[19:44] so when it says we don't rejoice in
[19:46] iniquity we rejoice in truth it means to
[19:49] be glad to be delighted to be pleased
[19:51] and think about when you are delighted
[19:53] about something what you think about
[19:54] when you're delighted about something
[19:56] you're pleased with something you're
[19:57] glad about something if you're glad
[19:59] about something you may talk about it
[20:00] you probably dwell on it you'll bring it
[20:02] up maybe you even make a a big deal
[20:05] about it all the time you magnify it
[20:08] because you're rejoicing over it you're
[20:10] pleased with it you're glad about it you
[20:12] rejoiced in it it makes you glad so
[20:15] that's the the Greek word to this type
[20:17] of rejoicing so you should now put that
[20:19] do you are you glad and delighted over
[20:22] iniquity in someone's life or iniquity
[20:24] in your life are you pleased with that
[20:26] does that make you pleased does it make
[20:28] you delighted hopefully not
[20:31] but we magnified so look at your life
[20:34] today look at your life today and say is
[20:36] there something in me that is pleased
[20:39] and rejoices as in glad and is delighted
[20:43] when iniquity prevails when someone
[20:46] iniquity is unrighteousness iniquities
[20:48] iniquities knowing to do good and not
[20:51] doing it
[20:52] and when that happens in your friend's
[20:54] life or a person's life or a Brother's
[20:56] life sometimes
[20:57] what is it in your heart what's your
[20:59] first feeling about it
[21:02] think about the things that make you
[21:04] happy I don't know what that is things
[21:06] that make you glad and if that's a part
[21:08] of it we need to hit an altar in a heart
[21:10] say Lord something's wrong with me if
[21:12] I'm gloating and happy and get a little
[21:14] happy feeling when somebody gets paid
[21:17] back
[21:18] for their Rebellion
[21:20] that little thing that says they
[21:22] deserved it
[21:24] when we leave that after God
[21:28] why don't we we leave that up to God so
[21:30] many people lately I've been saying why
[21:32] are you so Bound by what that other
[21:34] person is doing you're being bound and
[21:36] they don't even know it it's between
[21:37] them and God what they did
[21:39] you pray every day for them and that's
[21:42] all you can do but quit living under the
[21:44] bonds of worrying about what they're
[21:45] going to do
[21:48] release it in the name of the Lord
[21:49] release what they've done to you
[21:52] it's time to go on it's a new year
[21:56] brother Bob it's the new year can you
[21:58] say Amen Wednesday night we're on New
[22:00] Year's Revelations New Year's it's a new
[22:03] time why don't we leave the past in the
[22:05] past why don't we leave it in the
[22:07] graveyard of all the crazy stuff why
[22:09] don't we set our hearts on this new year
[22:11] 2023 is going to be a wonderful year
[22:14] with the Lord and I'm going to be free
[22:16] of losing sleep of all of this stuff I'm
[22:18] going to free be free of the bitterness
[22:20] I have towards people I'm going to let
[22:22] it go it's between them and God
[22:25] somebody said praise the Lord
[22:28] amen so now we look at our life as a
[22:32] Christian and he's we have to see what
[22:34] triggers the most Delight is it when
[22:36] somebody gets payback is it when a lie
[22:38] is told because that if you have the
[22:40] opposite of Truth we have a lie when
[22:42] lies are told then do we Rejoice over
[22:45] that and that lie travels around lies
[22:48] travel around faster than truth
[22:53] you know we're working to get the truth
[22:55] out all over the world we're sending
[22:56] Bibles everywhere but I can guarantee
[22:59] you lives of the scripture of travel
[23:01] much faster than the truth
[23:03] and in a local church gossip travels
[23:07] faster than the truth
[23:09] people buy into gossip as soon as they
[23:11] hear it they don't know if it's full
[23:13] truth yeah but but but you join in with
[23:15] it I'm gonna talk about gossip just a
[23:17] minute because you see now all those
[23:19] lies travel around and they hurt a
[23:21] person because lies are going around
[23:23] about a person and so you hear it come
[23:26] back and it comes back to you and you
[23:28] have a little feeling well they deserve
[23:30] that so I'm joining do you enjoy a
[23:32] conversation of juicy gossip that puts
[23:35] others down but you don't know whether
[23:37] it's truth or not
[23:40] I say hit an altar
[23:44] do you give yourself permission around
[23:46] your family
[23:47] talk down anybody in the congregation
[23:50] what's interesting they don't hardly
[23:52] even know that person in their own
[23:53] congregation but once they hear a little
[23:55] something they say something they join
[23:57] in with it gives a little little
[23:58] sarcastic joke and a little laugh about
[24:00] it and you don't even know that person
[24:02] you don't even know if it's the truth of
[24:05] what you're saying or hearing I say
[24:06] shame on us
[24:08] shame on us for joining in Gossip what's
[24:11] interesting is you don't like anybody to
[24:13] do that to you do you you don't like
[24:15] lies told about you as a matter of fact
[24:18] I'm going to go ahead and say it is that
[24:19] people what almost demand an apology if
[24:22] somebody gossips and something said
[24:24] about them they need to apologize to me
[24:26] but what's interesting is you don't
[24:27] apologize for anything you gossip you
[24:30] talk you put down other people and not
[24:32] once if you went and made it right
[24:35] so we don't like people talking about us
[24:37] and we get defensive about it we get up
[24:39] but we give ourselves permission to talk
[24:42] about anybody whether we know it's the
[24:44] full truth or not that's when we're kind
[24:47] of gloating over gossip
[24:49] and what we don't know and we're kind of
[24:51] happy and we kind of get a rush
[24:54] out of that atmosphere talking
[25:02] the pastor's hitting on Gossip because
[25:04] the devil of Gossip is always around
[25:08] you know he's not left with too much to
[25:10] work with but he always likes to get in
[25:13] conversations when it's gossip
[25:15] you form a friendship with somebody oh
[25:18] this is a real good friendship a lot of
[25:20] times it's not a friendship it's a
[25:22] gossip session
[25:23] and you like them because they give you
[25:25] freedom to talk about anybody
[25:28] that's not a relationship of a brother
[25:29] and sister in Christ that's not a
[25:31] relationship with a sister and sister of
[25:33] Christ that's a gossip session that's
[25:35] demon-possessed to tear down the unity
[25:37] of the body of Christ Amen brother Paul
[25:41] I give you instruction to start the new
[25:43] year and stop talking about people when
[25:47] you don't know the truth about it and if
[25:49] you know the truth even then be careful
[25:51] what you say to people pray for that
[25:53] person and if you got something to say
[25:55] if God's LED you to say something to
[25:57] correct them there's one person you need
[25:59] to go talk to and that's that brother or
[26:00] sister
[26:02] no other phone call no other person not
[26:05] Mom not dad not sisters not brothers did
[26:09] you know this about this oh
[26:14] if that feels good to you you're wrong
[26:17] brother and sister you're wrong
[26:22] I hear back things come back sometimes
[26:24] even other churches and I said how did
[26:26] they know about that how did they hear
[26:28] about that down there well somebody had
[26:30] to say something and I'm here to say in
[26:33] the name of the Lord we need to stop
[26:35] putting down other churches we need to
[26:37] stop putting down other people we need
[26:40] to stop gossiping and giving yourself
[26:42] permission to talk about anyone anywhere
[26:45] in this message
[26:46] [Applause]
[26:49] you want to grow to adoption you'll
[26:51] never get there by doing that
[26:54] and the reason is families do it is
[26:55] because it becomes normal to them
[26:57] they've been doing it for years it's
[26:58] their normal but I'm here to tell you
[26:59] it's not normal shame on you hit an
[27:02] altar and repent for the things that
[27:04] you've said
[27:08] do you enjoy a conversation with juicy
[27:10] gossip you don't know if it's the truth
[27:11] or not you just talk you know it's it
[27:13] doesn't feel good to have others talk
[27:14] about you but you can easily talk about
[27:17] others and get a good laugh about it
[27:19] other people's failures other people's
[27:21] stupid decisions you've never made a
[27:24] stupid decision in your life before
[27:29] you do realize that people make the
[27:32] subject always somebody else because it
[27:35] takes the attention off of their own
[27:37] problems
[27:39] can I get an amen it feels so much
[27:42] better to what do they call that deflect
[27:45] I think it's the psychological thing oh
[27:47] don't mention psychology they deflect
[27:50] the conversation to someone else and
[27:52] they blame someone else and they blame
[27:54] their parents and they blame this one
[27:56] because it feels good because it takes
[27:58] the subject off of their own problems
[28:01] so they deflected I think what the
[28:03] psychologist calls it and that's what
[28:05] human beings do it feels better it feels
[28:08] better that when you take the attention
[28:10] off your real problems and you're wrong
[28:12] to get with someone and talk them down
[28:14] someone in the church or somewhere else
[28:16] or talk your husband down or talk your
[28:18] wife down I say shame on you you're
[28:20] wrong to do that that's an atmosphere
[28:22] that you like you feel comfortable with
[28:24] but pray that God makes you
[28:25] uncomfortable with it we should not have
[28:28] a glad feeling in the iniquity of others
[28:30] we should grieve and pray and shut our
[28:33] mouths
[28:36] but we should rejoice and Delight when
[28:39] truth gets out
[28:41] when truth gives Deliverance to somebody
[28:43] when truth sets free that's when we
[28:46] should say praise be to God I rejoice in
[28:49] that with them
[28:53] you know it's not often in the times we
[28:56] live in that truth prevails in our court
[28:59] system
[29:03] but when it does it's cause for
[29:05] celebration
[29:06] how many has ever seen the court and
[29:08] there's a final verdict on something and
[29:09] that family
[29:11] has realized that the truth has gotten
[29:13] out
[29:15] there's no greater rejoicing when the
[29:17] truth comes to that court and Truth
[29:19] prevailed in that justice system
[29:22] that's good
[29:24] but today we don't get to the truth
[29:27] and I don't know all the reasons for
[29:28] that except for man as man has become
[29:30] professional liars and lies sound like
[29:33] the truth and and people are getting off
[29:35] with things in our society
[29:37] sin gets by sin gets off the hook
[29:40] violence is getting off the hook read
[29:43] your newspaper I mean newspaper nobody
[29:46] reads a newspaper read your phone read
[29:48] the read the news sin people that are
[29:51] violent are getting off within days
[29:52] they're being released with no bail
[29:56] so world we live in truth is not
[29:58] prevailing we don't have a prophet
[30:00] number one if we had a prophet sitting
[30:02] Among Us
[30:03] in that discernment thing discernment
[30:06] you couldn't hide anything from being in
[30:08] front of that Prophet all the Bible
[30:09] prophets discernments was there and you
[30:12] could try to lie all you want to and you
[30:14] were exposed
[30:15] I want to remind you that the word of
[30:17] God is quick and powerful and sharper
[30:19] than any two-edged sword and can discern
[30:21] the thoughts and the intents of the
[30:23] heart while I'm preaching if the holy
[30:25] spirit is here it can discern the
[30:26] secrets of your heart
[30:28] it can bring truth that's why we preach
[30:30] truth because truth will bring the truth
[30:32] out of our lives
[30:33] amen but the court system violence is
[30:36] getting off way off the hook way too
[30:39] much and we have some courts that are
[30:41] rejoicing not because of truth but
[30:43] because Revenge took place I want to get
[30:45] back at them as long as I can get back
[30:47] to them I don't care about the truth I'm
[30:49] rejoicing over vengeance
[30:52] what a shame
[30:54] that's not Justice
[30:57] and when we get to the truth of what
[30:59] happened that's what should be true
[31:01] rejoicing does not happen in our day
[31:03] very much because this is the age of a
[31:06] lying Spirit people learn to lie can you
[31:09] say Amen I'd like you to read about the
[31:12] last days in second Timothy Chapter 3
[31:14] The Lord brought this scripture up to me
[31:16] some of you are familiar some of you're
[31:17] not second Timothy chapter 3 verse 1
[31:20] says this know also that in the last
[31:24] days perilous testing times shall come
[31:27] does anybody know that we're in the last
[31:29] days
[31:30] so this is going to Peg the last days
[31:32] this snow also in the last days perilous
[31:35] time shall come for men shall be lovers
[31:37] or of their own selves Covetous boasters
[31:40] proud blasphemers disobedient to parents
[31:45] unthankful Unholy this is the
[31:48] characteristics of the last days without
[31:51] next natural affection a natural normal
[31:54] god-given affection for a man to a woman
[31:57] and a woman to man is being Twisted into
[32:00] some unnatural affection
[32:04] truce Breakers that means breaking
[32:06] promises
[32:08] false accusers incontinent no
[32:11] self-control false accusers in other
[32:14] words I'm going to accuse that person of
[32:16] something it's a false accusation but I
[32:18] enjoy doing it and I'm doing it fears
[32:21] despisers of those that are good and
[32:23] here's our text today despisers of those
[32:26] that are good
[32:29] despisers of those who are trying to
[32:31] live a righteous life
[32:34] Tim Tebow bows in prayer he gets
[32:36] criticism and persecution around the
[32:38] world now everybody else can do it and
[32:40] it's fine why because it's despisers of
[32:42] those that are righteous and good
[32:44] they're trying to live a holy life you
[32:46] will get persecuted in this world
[32:49] that's the world that's the spirit of
[32:51] the last days but it's not to be the
[32:53] spirit in the body of Jesus Christ can I
[32:56] get an amen it's not the spirit
[32:57] dominating your life amen
[33:01] despisers of those that are good
[33:02] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[33:06] Pleasures more than lovers of God having
[33:09] a form of godliness been denying the
[33:11] power thereof from such turn away it's
[33:14] amazing that all those characteristics
[33:15] we would put that's worldly people
[33:18] that's unbelievers no it says that they
[33:21] have a form of godliness
[33:24] religious people
[33:26] some in the ranks of the message and
[33:30] living out all of these characteristics
[33:33] were not to be dominated by the spirit
[33:35] of the world
[33:36] the spirit of the last days
[33:38] but were to be functioning and motivated
[33:41] by Capstone Divine love
[33:47] what an amazing scripture
[33:49] some Christian writers say it this way
[33:51] love is never glad when others go wrong
[33:55] to rejoice in the truth means to be glad
[33:57] about Behavior
[33:59] in accordance with the truth of God's
[34:01] word if someone you don't like falls
[34:04] into sin you don't gloat about it you
[34:06] grieve about it because God is grieved
[34:09] over sin if they repent then you rejoice
[34:13] I just want to say that my celebration
[34:16] comes
[34:17] as a person when there's dialogue
[34:20] there's openness there's repentance
[34:23] there's making things right there's
[34:26] there's can I have lunch with you can I
[34:28] have breakfast with you I need to get
[34:30] things out in the table and I need to
[34:32] make things right and the other person
[34:33] makes right there
[34:35] there's nothing that makes my heart
[34:37] swell more as a pastor to hear that
[34:40] people that hold grudges for years met
[34:43] with that person and cleared the air
[34:47] and they leave this is the truth this is
[34:50] what was done wrong it's under the blood
[34:52] I forgive you we're going on to serve
[34:54] the Lord It's the air the Slate has been
[34:57] cleared I'll tell you
[34:59] I just
[35:01] I get a rush of joy
[35:05] it's my personal testimony
[35:08] when I do it I feel better people are
[35:10] always thinking oh he must be perfect he
[35:12] never has to go to apologize to people
[35:18] Pastors make mistakes
[35:22] pastors mess up pastors don't always
[35:24] make the right decisions
[35:26] it's surprised for me to say that to you
[35:28] all
[35:29] I heard a pastor I didn't hear him but
[35:31] two or three weeks ago a pastor got up
[35:33] and fully apologized to the congregation
[35:35] because he acted out of place in
[35:36] something in a service heard of a pastor
[35:39] a couple months ago and somebody told me
[35:40] to go listen to the video took the whole
[35:42] service and said I was wrong in that
[35:44] completely wrong I apologize for it to
[35:46] this congregation I say praise the Lord
[35:49] that man's grown in the Lord
[35:52] he's got a lot of people within the
[35:54] message that can't ever apologize they
[35:57] know it all listen to Wednesday night
[35:58] there are know-it-alls Uzziah knew it
[36:00] all and he think he thinks he knew more
[36:02] than the priest the preacher and he come
[36:04] in with his rebellion and said I'll do
[36:06] this I'll take care of this and the
[36:09] reason leprosy struck his life is
[36:11] because he couldn't take correction
[36:18] I didn't expect to be this
[36:20] direct today
[36:22] but I'm looking at you and I'm looking
[36:24] at me and I'm looking at you online and
[36:26] I'm saying I love you enough to tell you
[36:28] the truth
[36:30] take your bitterness take your hatred
[36:33] take your gossip take all these things
[36:36] and bring them under the blood of Jesus
[36:39] Christ because so you can get a fresh
[36:41] start this year of 2023.
[36:45] amen rejoice
[36:49] writer Christian writer continues to say
[36:52] if is someone you don't like falls into
[36:54] sin you don't glow you you grieve
[36:56] because God Grieves if they repent
[36:57] Rejoice there's a fine balance to love
[37:00] though I like how he says this
[37:02] there's a fine balance to love although
[37:04] love is kind and overlooks the faults of
[37:06] others it does not compromise the truth
[37:09] or take a soft view of sin that's what
[37:12] our church world has done they've
[37:13] interpreted love is softening up on
[37:15] preaching against sin preaching against
[37:16] hell
[37:18] how many sermons you hear about hell and
[37:20] the Bible says there's a hell
[37:22] if your preacher never preaches on hell
[37:24] you better get another church
[37:26] if your preacher never preaches about
[37:28] modesty in the Bible you better get
[37:30] another Pastor because all of that is in
[37:32] the Bible
[37:33] we must preach against sin can you say
[37:35] Amen because if we love the people we
[37:38] preach against sin as well
[37:40] but today it's interpreted it's a soft
[37:43] view of sin and it's a compromise to the
[37:45] truth to allow another person to go on
[37:47] and sin whether it is a known sin or
[37:49] blind spot is not to seek his best it is
[37:52] not love love will sensitively confront
[37:55] and correct precisely because it cares
[37:58] deeply and knows that sin destroys love
[38:01] rejoices with truth
[38:04] we must speak the truth in love love
[38:08] gets excited when it hears those
[38:10] spiritual victories can you say Amen
[38:12] love gets excited when it hears of
[38:15] spiritual victories love encourages by
[38:18] expressing Joy over little evidences of
[38:21] growth
[38:23] a lot of times in our parenting we know
[38:25] about how to say all the wrong things no
[38:27] no no no no no no no no but you got to
[38:29] give praise when they're doing something
[38:31] right
[38:33] most of us parents fail in that I'll put
[38:35] myself in that there's not enough praise
[38:37] forgiven for the little growth and the
[38:40] little maturity and the little steps
[38:42] towards the Lord it ought to be
[38:44] celebrated my son and daughter got
[38:45] baptized it should be celebrated can you
[38:48] say Amen you look at him at eight nine
[38:50] years old 10 years old they might even
[38:52] not have a full birth of Christ yet but
[38:54] they're taking a step towards God in
[38:56] every little step should be celebrated
[38:58] by the body of Christ
[39:00] it's not that they are successful in
[39:02] this world and they beat all the
[39:04] competition at school well you should
[39:06] praise them for that but the greatest
[39:07] praise you should get is when they make
[39:10] steps towards the Lord even if it's baby
[39:12] steps
[39:14] celebrate it and if your brother's
[39:16] sitting next to you you may feel a
[39:18] certain thing about it but if he's
[39:19] growing in the Lord even if it's a baby
[39:21] step you ought to celebrate and rejoice
[39:23] with him somebody say praise the Lord
[39:26] amen and so I love how he says that he
[39:30] says we are expressing Joy over little
[39:32] evidences of growth John the Apostle of
[39:36] Love wrote I have no Greater Joy than
[39:38] this to hear of my children walking in
[39:42] truth
[39:44] for a parrot
[39:45] what's your greatest joy in life your
[39:48] business
[39:49] making money
[39:51] your IRA
[39:54] oh it's growing my IRA is growing
[39:59] who cares
[40:01] we're going to leave all this to the
[40:03] Catholic Church anyway
[40:05] [Music]
[40:06] oh I shouldn't have said that
[40:09] the Bible prophesies that somebody's
[40:12] gonna take over and whoever owns all
[40:15] the gold of this world
[40:18] we're going to have to sell out to
[40:20] something someday
[40:22] I just dropped that in that was free
[40:26] but you see now
[40:29] I have no Greater Joy my parents what's
[40:32] your greatest joy I have no Greater Joy
[40:34] than to see my children walk in truth
[40:36] and I'm going to keep praying until that
[40:38] happens
[40:39] now keep praying until that happens
[40:44] job job
[40:46] in the Bible in job 37
[40:50] help me out here put it up on the screen
[40:52] uh and you can get it in your Bibles
[40:54] there I'd still like you to bring your
[40:55] Bibles even though we're in modern times
[40:58] and the Bible is on everything else
[41:01] I'd like you to bring your Bible to
[41:02] church
[41:03] and job had something interesting here
[41:05] that he said
[41:07] is very humble
[41:09] with all that he went through and losing
[41:11] everything he could have become bitter
[41:13] but he actually became better
[41:16] instead of bitter he says something here
[41:18] I picked up on last night job 37 29.
[41:21] look what he says here job 37 29
[41:27] . that can't be right
[41:52] I'm a senior moment here
[41:55] you have to edit all this out of the
[41:57] video
[42:04] 13 15.
[42:10] what a shame I wanted to read that
[42:13] and I cannot find it
[42:19] I'm going to summarize and then I'm
[42:21] going to bring you that scripture next
[42:22] Sunday
[42:23] is that fair
[42:25] I don't know where it's at I can I can I
[42:28] can promise you though it's in the Bible
[42:33] I read it last night
[42:37] he was saying things about
[42:41] acting a certain way towards his
[42:43] servants when they came up
[42:46] and they'd ask him a question and he'd
[42:49] give them a bad attitude back because
[42:51] they were his servants and he was the he
[42:53] was in charge and then he he talked
[42:56] about
[42:57] when my enemy does something wrong
[43:01] and he pays for it
[43:03] he said then I glowed over it and then
[43:05] I'm happy about that exactly what First
[43:08] Corinthians 13 is saying
[43:10] and he goes into it and he's saying I'm
[43:13] under the judgments of God too and in in
[43:16] one of the verses he says it this way he
[43:18] said they were made in the womb just
[43:21] like me
[43:23] so now we enter into life and we have
[43:25] status and we have positions and we have
[43:27] and so we start to think and we're
[43:29] better and someone fails and we rejoice
[43:31] in it and I don't have any time for the
[43:33] servants and we do us and he says I Was
[43:35] Made In the Womb just like them I have
[43:36] no right to act better or put them down
[43:39] I can fall just like them
[43:42] I'm not an elite
[43:46] just because I say I am
[43:50] I'm not Elite
[43:52] preaching about Pride here today
[43:55] I'm not Elite because I'm in the group
[43:57] of the message of the hour
[44:05] I'm only Royal by his blood that's in Me
[44:08] by spirit
[44:10] but that gives me no Bragging Rights
[44:13] to treat others lesser than me
[44:18] no matter what revelation we have even
[44:21] in the ranks of the message no matter
[44:23] what Revelation that we have
[44:26] we're and we're the bride and we're
[44:29] we're the super race we're the bride
[44:32] we're the bride we're the bride if
[44:35] you're the bride why don't you act like
[44:37] your husband
[44:41] throat
[44:43] if you're the bride of Christ then why
[44:46] is it their characteristics because to
[44:48] me the bride of Christ by Spirit Bears
[44:51] the characteristics of her husband
[44:53] Christ
[44:54] can you say man how many conventions
[44:56] were the bride we're the bride we're the
[44:58] bride and so many attributes are not
[45:00] acting like the bride at all I say start
[45:03] acting like our husband if we claim to
[45:05] be his bride can I get an amen
[45:07] I think the bride has the same Spirit of
[45:09] her husband where does this arrogance
[45:12] and pride come from I'm anointed many
[45:15] mighty things are happening under the
[45:16] anointing under me well your husband was
[45:19] the most anointed person on the face of
[45:21] the Earth and with the full anointing on
[45:24] him he sat down and precious words came
[45:27] from his mouth
[45:30] another Minister brought it up and said
[45:32] that day
[45:34] and the prophet says he said the most
[45:37] anointed person in the world Jesus
[45:40] Christ what did he do Under the full
[45:42] anointing he sat down he opened the book
[45:44] and precious words preceded us it didn't
[45:46] say he shouted and danced all over the
[45:48] room he didn't say he screamed he was
[45:50] the most I'm quoting the prophet now the
[45:52] most anointed sat down and precious
[45:54] words proceeded from his mouth
[45:57] see brother Paul you again shouting
[45:59] absolutely not
[46:00] uh you can shout all you want to
[46:03] you can rejoice and get excited but just
[46:06] make sure it's because of the
[46:08] stimulation of what God's showing you
[46:09] it's not orchestrated it's not
[46:11] legislated and it's not pushed and
[46:14] that's not the evidence that we have
[46:15] something real
[46:16] that's not the evidence that there's a
[46:18] true anointing there
[46:23] if for the bride then let's act like our
[46:26] husband Jesus Christ can I get an amen
[46:28] I'm annoyed you well we should see what
[46:31] the anointing really is now I'm going to
[46:34] go to these quotes real quickly and then
[46:35] we're going to wrap it up because I
[46:38] believe that I've covered the subject I
[46:39] believe you're catching it
[46:41] so the next one says love does not
[46:43] rejoice with injustices or iniquities
[46:45] love to rejoices with when truth
[46:48] prevails so if you've caught that
[46:50] thought today this is that that channel
[46:52] of divine love that finds the the the
[46:55] the reason why it rejoices First
[46:58] Corinthians 13 6 this is our text and
[47:00] then I read to you in first Corinthians
[47:02] 12 there that there be so no be no
[47:04] division in the body of Christ but that
[47:06] the members should have the same care of
[47:08] one another and when the whether one
[47:09] member suffer all the members suffer
[47:11] with it or one member be honored all the
[47:14] members Rejoice with it in other words
[47:16] we are so tied together that's why we
[47:19] can rejoice when someone is honored and
[47:21] we can rejoice when someone comes to
[47:23] truth in a victory and a Deliverance in
[47:25] their life and that's why we can grieve
[47:27] when someone else is grieving
[47:29] give them a positive word give them a
[47:32] text of encouragement Interlink with the
[47:34] body of Christ
[47:36] New Year's resolution for some of you
[47:37] it's not going to hurt you to get closer
[47:39] to the body that you're a part of
[47:42] it's not going to hurt you to bring your
[47:43] young people and get them integrated and
[47:45] plugged in with the body of Christ not
[47:47] going to hurt you to invite somebody
[47:48] over
[47:51] why are you why are you so afraid of
[47:53] that
[47:54] why are some of you so afraid of it
[47:58] might say something that makes me
[48:00] nervous
[48:04] no that's your uncle that says things
[48:06] like that
[48:07] that's a family member
[48:09] I love you and I'm going to encourage
[48:11] you some of you are too detached from
[48:13] this body and you're missing out you're
[48:15] missing out on what God's providing with
[48:18] friendships developed here
[48:22] get back to what you're saying all right
[48:23] next next quote I do not know why I said
[48:26] that subject to speak on the return of
[48:28] the Prodigal Son brother Bobby speaking
[48:30] in Cleveland here speaking in Cleveland
[48:31] Ohio I do not know why I said the
[48:33] subject he was praying he says he didn't
[48:35] have a subject and he says I'm going to
[48:37] preach on the prodigal son and then he's
[48:38] after his prayer he says I don't know
[48:39] why I said that subject to speak on the
[48:41] return of the prodigal son I haven't
[48:43] read this scripture for the past eight
[48:44] years that I know of haven't read this
[48:46] piece of scripture and to go speak on it
[48:48] I guess it's been eight or ten years ago
[48:50] since I spoke on it and I think when I
[48:52] did I approached it from the way of the
[48:55] Pharisees the song that was left at home
[48:58] that felt bad towards his brother and I
[49:02] believe that's the way the story goes
[49:04] and he was very provoked because the
[49:06] father had received the Lost straying
[49:09] son back and his attitude of approach to
[49:11] it and I spoke to the church about how
[49:14] they should not feel that way that when
[49:16] a sinner comes to the altar the whole
[49:19] church
[49:21] ought to gather right around them don't
[49:23] you believe that
[49:25] he took a sermon not on the prodigal son
[49:28] because everybody preaches on the
[49:30] prodigal son he took a sermon on the
[49:33] brother of The Prodigal Son which is a
[49:35] type of a religious person and he gets
[49:38] mad because of all this party and
[49:40] celebration that his dad welcomes this
[49:43] kid back and he stayed faithful he's
[49:46] been going to church he's been paying
[49:48] his tithes he stayed faithful to his
[49:50] father he didn't take his inheritance
[49:51] and go spend it he said you're you're he
[49:54] comes to his dad all Angry he's angry
[49:56] his dad's saying my son come before he
[49:59] even gets back he's embracing him kill
[50:02] the fatted calf get the singers in
[50:06] let's have a celebration my son has come
[50:09] back home to me that was before he even
[50:11] had a repentance from his son
[50:15] he's just on his way back and he's
[50:17] already celebrating
[50:19] come on everybody everybody awake
[50:22] and and the Brothers From a Distance
[50:24] looking and he hears music the Bible
[50:25] says he hears the music and he says
[50:27] what's what's the deal with all the
[50:28] music what's the deal with all what's
[50:30] the party about Well your dad's son has
[50:32] come home and he's set a celebration and
[50:34] killed the fatigue he goes over to his
[50:36] dad's dad
[50:37] what's going on here I've been here the
[50:40] whole time he took his you know remember
[50:43] what he's done he took the entire
[50:45] heritance he's went out and spent it on
[50:46] prostitutes and every other thing it's
[50:48] gone he's on his way back and you're
[50:50] giving him the fatty calf and all the
[50:53] finest robes and
[50:55] I don't even have he said this in the
[50:57] Bible you haven't even give me a kid
[51:00] goat a baby goat
[51:02] that's how sarcastic is I don't even get
[51:06] a kid
[51:08] I haven't I've worked my fingers to the
[51:10] Bone and I don't even get a a baby goat
[51:15] and you're killing the fatted calf for
[51:17] him what's going on he says I don't know
[51:19] what to tell you son but I'm just happy
[51:21] my son has come back to me again
[51:24] [Applause]
[51:27] don't try to overthink it don't try to
[51:30] be critical when somebody comes back
[51:31] don't say well I never went that far out
[51:34] and they didn't no no no no no no listen
[51:36] we're all capable of running the
[51:38] farthest from God with the flesh that's
[51:40] in us but if somebody does they can't if
[51:44] they're a son and daughter of God they
[51:45] can't ever go far enough that God cannot
[51:48] reach them and bring them back and when
[51:51] they come back they don't need a code of
[51:53] ethics to live by they don't need to go
[51:55] through a process of whether we forgive
[51:57] them or not the Bible says we're still
[51:59] to rejoice when someone repents
[52:05] so are you the brother
[52:09] or are you the Prodigal Son
[52:14] religious Pharisees in the message
[52:17] that have all these things
[52:20] and feelings
[52:22] praise the Lord
[52:26] I'm ending this by saying and I'm ending
[52:28] at 12 25 I'm a good boy
[52:33] I'm ending this by saying there's a
[52:34] couple of other places that I want to
[52:36] remind you of of what we as Christians
[52:39] are Rejoice over and I'm going to end
[52:40] this by our vision because remember a
[52:43] vision my vision for the year if you
[52:44] want to join in is to get our minds off
[52:46] of every other thing that's going on in
[52:49] the ranks of our belief and get our
[52:51] minds on a soul a soul is worth ten
[52:54] thousand worlds a New Soul a repentance
[52:58] so a coming back Soul our hearts and
[53:00] prayers and our efforts should be on it
[53:02] take some cards with you I know that
[53:04] sounds mechanical take some invitation
[53:06] cards with you today take them and hand
[53:09] them out say well I live clear three
[53:11] hours away hand them out anyway and if
[53:14] that person calls you and says I think I
[53:16] want to go get them in the car and bring
[53:18] them in the presence of the Lord
[53:21] bring them
[53:24] but for us we're around here we get the
[53:26] word out
[53:27] the ads I'm on the broadcast today
[53:31] praise the Lord let's be praying would
[53:33] you all just raise your hand I'll pray
[53:35] that God calls the elected seed he can
[53:38] use anything to do it Lord use the music
[53:40] that's on there use the little 20-minute
[53:42] sermon on there God get a hold of your
[53:45] people let's get our Focus off of one
[53:47] another let's get our Focus off of all
[53:49] your past trouble let's get our Focus
[53:51] off The Grudges that we hold
[53:56] it's good trying to switch our focus and
[53:58] sometimes it's hard to switch people's
[53:59] Focus because they're so Bound by the
[54:02] past
[54:03] I'm trying to switch your focus come
[54:05] along with me
[54:07] come along with me
[54:09] you'll be happier I'll be happier
[54:12] there's something Joy raises up when a
[54:15] sinner repents Joy raises up with the
[54:18] little changes in a person's life Joy
[54:20] raise it up when somebody's here we
[54:21] haven't seen they may look like the
[54:22] world and act like the world and got all
[54:24] the habits of the world but we're all
[54:26] gonna already gonna talk to the deacons
[54:28] and policing insecurity don't worry
[54:30] about that we'll take care of it but we
[54:32] want them to come in the presence of the
[54:34] Lord and be transformed and changed
[54:43] praise the Lord
[54:46] so there's two places that
[54:51] we're to Rejoice over number one when he
[54:54] gave power to the disciples before
[54:56] Pentecost before the Holy Ghost to go
[54:58] out and heal the sick and cast out
[55:01] Devils they sent out sent them out two
[55:03] by two Jesus didn't go with them he gave
[55:06] them power to cast out devils and when
[55:08] they came back after that whole journey
[55:09] they were rejoicing and shouting and
[55:12] having a good time and they said this is
[55:15] the reason for the rejoicing even the
[55:17] devils are subject to us
[55:20] how many believe the devils are subject
[55:22] to a son and daughter of God
[55:24] I mean at least when you lay your hands
[55:25] on that child it's not you but it's
[55:27] through the name of Jesus that child can
[55:29] be healed
[55:31] my daughter Ryan sent me a quote this
[55:33] week I loved it so much because it it
[55:35] articulates what I've been feeling
[55:37] lately the power of the local church or
[55:39] what God can do in the local church not
[55:41] globally but what he can do in local
[55:43] church there's some influences that are
[55:45] undermining the local church and what
[55:46] God can do in them even within our ranks
[55:49] oh I can sit home and if this preacher
[55:52] is not on I can watch this one and I can
[55:54] watch that one and then and meanwhile
[55:55] the local church doesn't have any value
[55:57] to you I believe the local church God
[55:59] can do something and that quote she sent
[56:01] me says he said you're waiting around
[56:02] for a big evangelist to pray for you or
[56:05] a big healing line and he says your
[56:07] pastor has the same Authority as that of
[56:09] visiting evangelist to lay hands on you
[56:11] and you can be healed he said in not
[56:13] only the pastor a member of the body of
[56:16] Christ in your church has just as much
[56:19] Authority as the visiting evangelists
[56:21] [Applause]
[56:25] let's not undermine what God can do
[56:27] among us we're going to have meetings
[56:29] we're going to have special meetings in
[56:31] March third weekend in March we have
[56:32] brother Craig Brewer here for three
[56:33] nights and so we're looking forward to
[56:35] it we're praying God to do something but
[56:36] we don't have to wait for special
[56:37] meetings we don't have to wait for a
[56:39] special evangelist right now God can use
[56:42] his authority in the church
[56:46] I love that so much he says you you
[56:48] don't have to wait for him your pastor
[56:50] can lay hands on you
[56:52] the body of Christ can lay hands on you
[56:54] but here's here's what he said when they
[56:56] come back and we Rejoice the devils are
[56:58] subject to us Glory
[57:00] and Jesus corrected him he said don't
[57:03] Rejoice because devils are subject to
[57:06] you but the reason you should Rejoice is
[57:08] because your names are written in the
[57:10] Lamb's Book of Life
[57:14] [Applause]
[57:15] and just saying friends he's correct and
[57:18] he's bringing correction
[57:20] to the whole Pentecostal world
[57:23] that the source of your rejoicing
[57:25] shouldn't be that devils are running and
[57:28] you have authority it should be that
[57:30] your name is written in the Lamb's Book
[57:32] of Life because if it's written there
[57:34] that's why you have authority
[57:36] and don't just see how rejoicing over
[57:39] shouting and Devil's subject and my such
[57:41] don't you see how that can get off track
[57:43] we're we're rejoicing and worshiping for
[57:46] the wrong reason
[57:48] but if you come into this service
[57:50] and God hasn't done any Miracles yet God
[57:53] hasn't changed anything in your life yet
[57:54] you're what you're looking for to change
[57:55] you can start worshiping already without
[57:59] nothing happening yet because your names
[58:01] are written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[58:04] you can shout around this room on the
[58:07] first Psalm Gideon sings
[58:10] and then he's going to look at you and
[58:11] say wow this is great
[58:15] you don't have to wait for God to do
[58:17] something
[58:19] you can shout my name is written in the
[58:21] Lamb's Book of Life he's called me and
[58:24] loved me before the foundation of the
[58:25] world that's the reason I Rejoice that's
[58:27] the reason I can Shout I'm one of his
[58:30] [Applause]
[58:33] so that's the first season I'm giving
[58:34] you reasons to Rejoice now the second
[58:36] one is that when he said Jesus said it
[58:39] he says the angels and all of Heaven
[58:42] rejoice when one sinner repenteth
[58:48] source of joy
[58:52] what makes Heaven Rejoice what makes
[58:54] shouting in heaven what makes Heaven
[58:57] Come unglued
[58:59] not when someone Falls
[59:02] but it's one sinner it's not just one
[59:04] sinner comes back but he repents when we
[59:06] see true repentance and fruits of it
[59:08] coming
[59:09] that's the reason for our shouting and
[59:11] rejoice
[59:13] can you say man
[59:15] one all of Heaven that's when the Angels
[59:19] rejoice
[59:22] heaven doesn't Strike Up the Band
[59:26] for any old occasion at hand it's got to
[59:29] be a special thing just to hear those
[59:32] Angels Sing there's only one thing that
[59:36] we're sure about that can make those
[59:39] angels jump and Shout it's when a sinner
[59:42] makes the Lord his choice that's when
[59:46] the Angels rejoice
[59:51] did you like that
[59:54] amen all right I'll sing it again
[59:57] what's the course again I forgot the
[59:58] chords already
[1:00:01] there's only one thing that we're sure
[1:00:04] about that can make those angels jump
[1:00:07] and Shout it's when a sinner makes the
[1:00:11] Lord his choice that's when the Angels
[1:00:14] Rejoice that's the purpose that's the
[1:00:16] reason that's when they get excited in
[1:00:18] the other dimension they're here this
[1:00:20] morning somebody repented in this
[1:00:21] service some people have blocked me off
[1:00:24] some people have locked up he's
[1:00:26] preaching at me my brother's sister
[1:00:28] that's not true
[1:00:30] I love you
[1:00:34] but
[1:00:36] the other dimension this morning
[1:00:38] is rejoicing
[1:00:40] because so many in their heart has come
[1:00:42] closer to the Lord
[1:00:44] maybe even repented you don't always
[1:00:46] have to go to an altar to repent say
[1:00:48] Lord I'm wrong and I see this through
[1:00:50] this service this morning I'm wrong
[1:00:52] you're right forgive me
[1:00:55] and if it's true repentance you know
[1:00:57] what in the other dimension they're
[1:00:59] shouting they're rejoicing they're happy
[1:01:01] when a sinner comes back when a sinner
[1:01:04] comes we are to be saying praise be to
[1:01:08] God
[1:01:09] because two things we Rejoice because
[1:01:11] they're getting saved second of all
