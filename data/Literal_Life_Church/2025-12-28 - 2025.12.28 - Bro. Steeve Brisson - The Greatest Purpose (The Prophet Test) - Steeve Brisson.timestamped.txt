[22:10] If I [singing] could make just one
[22:13] request
[22:16] that would [music and singing] mark all
[22:17] the days I have left.
[22:22] I'd rather [singing]
[22:23] not be [music] known for treasures and
[22:26] fame or trophies and [singing]
[22:30] colors I know will fade.
[22:35] Instead, I would rather [singing]
[22:38] be known [music]
[22:41] by the kindness and love [singing] that
[22:44] I show.
[22:47] to be [music and singing] known for
[22:49] patience and longsuffering.
[22:54] A giver of life [singing] by the words
[22:57] [music] that I speak.
[23:01] So [singing] with every breath you give
[23:06] to me, I pray it's [singing] your glory
[23:10] that they see.
[23:14] And of all the words this world could
[23:18] say,
[23:20] may they say I [singing]
[23:23] am full of grace. [music]
[23:31] I'll be the first to confess
[23:37] I'm not always found at my best.
[23:43] But Lord, [singing and music] be my
[23:45] strength in those moments I'm weak.
[23:49] And I'll keep on [singing] giving the
[23:53] grace I've [music] received.
[23:57] So with every breath you give [singing]
[24:01] to breathe, I pray it's your glory
[24:05] [singing]
[24:06] that they see. [music]
[24:10] And of all the words [singing]
[24:12] this world could say,
[24:16] may [singing and music] they say I am
[24:19] full of grace.
[24:22] [music] Oh. [singing]
[24:26] Oh.
[24:29] Oh. [singing]
[24:35] Oh.
[24:38] [singing and music]
[24:49] And finally [singing] when I see your
[24:52] face
[24:55] and I've reached the end [singing] of my
[24:58] race. [music]
[25:01] I don't [singing] want to [music] be
[25:03] known for finishing strong, but as
[25:07] [music] someone [singing] that your
[25:09] grace carried all along.
[25:16] [music]
[25:16] So with every breath [singing]
[25:19] you give to
[25:23] I pray is your glory
[25:26] that they see.
[25:29] And of all the words this world could
[25:34] say,
[25:35] may [singing] they say, "I am full of
[25:40] grace." [singing]
[25:42] Oh.
[25:45] Oh.
[25:47] [singing]
[25:47] [music]
[25:52] Oh.

[26:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let them say that of
[26:14] us.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; May I be full of grace. May I enter in
[26:18] that place where he says, "Well done,
[26:20] thou good and faithful servant.
[26:22] that we were full of grace. Praise the
[26:25] Lord. Thank you, Bran sisters. Missing
[26:27] two of them. Um had to go two had to go
[26:30] back to work um back to Quebec. But it's
[26:33] good to have the anointed [music] music.
[26:35] And of course on the music app for the
[26:37] church, Fountain House, you can find all
[26:39] the music and theirs is [music] the most
[26:41] recent on there. And it's been such an
[26:44] incredible blessing to many already. So,
[26:46] if you want to hear all the four girls,
[26:48] um we'd certainly uh encourage you to
[26:51] get on [music] that and listen to it.
[26:52] And uh it's been kind of a we're having
[26:55] brother Steve from Quebec today and his
[26:58] wife and family been in all of the pet a
[27:00] lot of the petites. Most of them have
[27:02] been [music] in town. We have some of
[27:04] them moved here and then because this is
[27:06] in between looks like this might become
[27:08] the place they come in for Christmas.
[27:10] So, I'm calling it the Petite Brassan
[27:13] invasion
[27:14] or the French invasion. That sounds more
[27:17] like a war or something like the French
[27:19] invasion.
[27:22] But good families and good to have
[27:24] [music] him with us and we're looking
[27:25] forward to the word this morning and uh
[27:27] we appreciate their lives through the
[27:29] years. He was back here doing a family
[27:30] series [music] for us uh in the summer
[27:33] and we certainly enjoyed it. It's been a
[27:35] great blessing to us and we look forward
[27:36] to the word [music]
[27:38] uh this uh today. I wanted to say how
[27:40] much joy I got out of the service last
[27:42] Sunday as we What a blessed time to
[27:44] celebrate. What a way uh can't think of
[27:46] a better way to celebrate [music] this
[27:48] time and uh we trust you had a merry
[27:50] Christmas with your family, a good time
[27:52] of worship and also just being together.
[27:54] But last Sunday, [music]
[27:56] it gave me great joy to worship the Lord
[27:58] that way. But you know what? To be able
[28:00] to shine the light all of us together on
[28:03] [music] ears that haven't heard, uh eyes
[28:06] that haven't seen to to spread the light
[28:08] like that. I went home and I couldn't
[28:10] sleep. I felt [music] such joy. You
[28:12] know, you want to find joy in life,
[28:14] share what you have with somebody else.
[28:16] It's not in money. Can you say amen?
[28:18] It's not even in the presents. [music]
[28:20] You know, Chris, you know, if you do
[28:22] give your children gifts, the kids like
[28:24] the gifts, but we shouldn't get all the
[28:26] joy out of that. Our joy ought to be
[28:27] sharing the greatest gift that's ever
[28:28] [music] come to us. And that's this word
[28:30] in the last days, Christ revealed. And
[28:33] uh boy, it just thrilled my heart to be
[28:35] able to do that. and all of the
[28:37] atmosphere and just whatever it was.
[28:38] Can't say enough about it. We just get
[28:40] great joy out of sharing with so many
[28:43] ears that's listening. If you're a
[28:44] visitor this morning, God bless all of
[28:46] you and all the visitors from out of
[28:47] town. [music] God bless each one of you.
[28:49] It's good to have you and the house of
[28:50] the Lord. I wanted to also say happy
[28:52] birthday to my brother. um I wouldn't
[28:54] have enough time to share all that my
[28:57] brother Isaac has contributed behind the
[28:59] scenes and also out front for [music] he
[29:02] was one of the first ones here move
[29:04] moved here with me some 35 years ago I
[29:07] guess it was and he's been [music] with
[29:09] me from the start and he has helped do
[29:12] everything that we do in so many areas I
[29:14] couldn't mention all of them and I want
[29:16] to say I appreciate him I think his
[29:18] daughter said it well she's probably
[29:19] going to beat me up for reading this
[29:21] this morning but she [music] sent this
[29:23] to the family and I think it expresses
[29:24] Isaac well. She said, "Happy birthday to
[29:27] my dad." And we'll just say this is from
[29:29] all of us if if she doesn't mind. This
[29:32] year brought unexpected trials, but
[29:34] through every one of them, you chose
[29:36] obedience over fear. Listening closely
[29:39] to what God [music] has was asking and
[29:41] stepping forward in faith. You build a
[29:43] thriving business that now blesses
[29:44] churches across the country. [music] You
[29:46] wrote a book that musicians say has
[29:48] transformed the way they think. Now
[29:50] reaching hearts around the world. You
[29:52] chose your health, losing 100 pounds,
[29:56] you're way ahead of me, [applause]
[30:00] and showed us and showed us what
[30:02] discipline [music] and stewardship look
[30:04] like. Most of all, you've kept our
[30:06] family rooted in God, steady and
[30:09] faithful, [music] no matter what trials
[30:11] the enemy tried to place in our path.
[30:14] I'm so proud of you. And Ike, we are so
[30:16] proud of you. And you know what? She
[30:18] said it perfect. She said it perfect. We
[30:21] love you. We appreciate you on your
[30:22] birthday today. May God abundantly bless
[30:25] you for the years of labor that you've
[30:27] given to this church, the ministry, and
[30:28] around the world. [applause] We love
[30:31] [cheering] you.
[30:35] [applause]
[30:36] Praise the Lord. And even though you
[30:38] asked for lights to be put on the drum
[30:39] [music] thing for Christmas and I said
[30:41] no, of course,
[30:44] the drums always already have enough
[30:46] connotation to them. We don't need to
[30:48] put lights on them for sure. But uh what
[30:51] a joy to be able to work through u my
[30:54] brother who has given so much and as I
[30:56] said to this [music] church but also the
[30:57] kingdom of God and now continues to
[31:00] travel out and help with many areas of
[31:03] the church not only sound but also some
[31:05] other areas of teaching [music] as well.
[31:07] So we appreciate you so much. Praise the
[31:09] Lord. We're going to stand and invite
[31:11] our minister this morning. God bless you
[31:12] all for being [music] faithful to the
[31:14] house of God. those that are listening
[31:16] online and we uh this moment is the most
[31:19] important moment in life when we just
[31:20] say Lord I am hungry. How many would
[31:22] raise your hand say I'm hungry for the
[31:23] word of God. I'm hungry to hear from God
[31:26] this morning. [music] If you'll hold
[31:28] that before him this is the most
[31:29] important part of our lives that he
[31:31] would have something to deposit to me
[31:34] this morning. I come you know I get my
[31:36] mind off I'm the pastor so I'm thinking
[31:38] well [music] who's here and who's not
[31:40] here. I've learned to shut all that out.
[31:42] you you God knew who would needed to be
[31:45] here. You're here this morning, but
[31:47] God's here. That's the main thing. And
[31:50] so I shut it all out. I shut out the
[31:52] pressures. I shut out everything because
[31:53] this moment, he would have something for
[31:56] me. And I want it. I want it for all of
[31:58] you. But I want it for myself, [music]
[31:59] too. Whatever God has for me. I don't
[32:01] know care if you're a teenager. I don't
[32:03] care if you're 10 years old. I don't
[32:04] care if you're care if you're 80 years
[32:05] old. [music] All of us need one thing.
[32:08] Man, Jesus said, "Man shall not live by
[32:10] bread alone, but by every word that
[32:12] proceeds from the mouth of God." So this
[32:14] moment, say, "Lord, speak to me. Fill my
[32:16] heart. Feed my heart. [music] I need it,
[32:18] Father." Don't try to get in on your
[32:20] parents. Don't try to do that if you're
[32:22] young. Just say, "But God, you can give
[32:24] something to me this morning. You can
[32:26] you can fulfill my heart. You can fill
[32:29] my heart with something [music] from the
[32:30] word." And uh I think that's important.
[32:33] You know, Brother Ed, you gave a late
[32:34] prayer request [music] there, and we'll
[32:36] just take that right now. Brother Ed got
[32:38] in a little late and he said a very
[32:40] close friend found out [music] they have
[32:43] masses on their lung. She's knocking on
[32:46] God's door and I [music] pray for peace
[32:48] and finding her finding the Lord.
[32:52] Our precious [music] heavenly father,
[32:55] brother Ed has stood in the gap for this
[32:57] friend, Lord. There's [music] masses,
[33:00] Lord, on her throat. And we pray in the
[33:03] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you
[33:05] will intervene. you'll step in, [music]
[33:06] Lord, that you show that you care for
[33:08] her, Father. You already did when you
[33:11] took the stripes upon [music] her back.
[33:12] So, I pray, Lord, you'll bring healing
[33:14] to her body. Lord, as she reaches out
[33:16] [music] to you, I pray you'll touch her
[33:17] and she'll give her heart to you, Lord,
[33:19] as well. The greatest healing that can
[33:21] [music] take place. But Lord, come along
[33:23] and be mindful of her need and her cry
[33:26] for help this morning. We stand all as a
[33:28] congregation in the gap for her. Touch
[33:31] her, bless her, [music] be with her,
[33:33] Lord, and heal her, we pray. And we
[33:35] commit it in the name of the Lord Jesus
[33:37] [music] Christ. Amen. Everybody said
[33:39] amen. Amen.
[33:43] [singing]
[33:45] Holy
[33:48] are you Lord God
[33:52] Almighty.
[33:57] Worthy is the lamb.
[34:01] Worthy is [music] the lamb.
[34:05] You are holy. Can we lift our hands and
[34:08] worship him? The lamb this [music]
[34:09] morning. Holy. [singing]
[34:13] Just close it all out. Worship the Lord.
[34:15] You Lord [music] God
[34:19] Almighty.
[34:21] [singing]
[34:22] Hallelujah.
[34:24] Worthy [music] is the lamb.
[34:28] Worthy is [singing] the lamb.
[34:32] You are holy. [music]
[34:35] [singing]
[34:39] Sing it one more time.
[34:41] [music] Holy, [singing]
[34:46] holy [music]
[34:51] are you, Lord [music and singing] God
[34:55] Almighty.
[35:00] Worthy is [music] the lamb.
[35:04] Worthy is the lamb.
[35:07] You are [music] holy.
[35:10] Holy
[35:19] God
[35:21] Almighty.
[35:23] [music]
[35:26] Worthy is the lamb.
[35:30] Worthy is [music and singing] the lamb.
[35:34] You are holy. [music]
[35:40] Hallelujah. Amen.
[35:43] How many are happy to be in [music] the
[35:44] house of the Lord this morning?
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Certainly serve the living God.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Certainly happy to be with you.
[35:52] And as our brother said, this is the
[35:54] French invasion. [music]
[35:56] We've been undercover since a little
[35:58] while. It's becoming obvious now, but we
[36:01] first sent our sweetest undercover agent
[36:03] in Sister Miriam,
[36:06] which [music] took a key position in the
[36:08] church, got really close to the pastor.
[36:11] Then we sent a second layer, you know,
[36:14] in Francis and Rachel, and they're about
[36:16] to be deployed into a key position as
[36:18] well. And after that, [music] we started
[36:21] a third wave with Ann and Josh. So we
[36:24] came here for Christmas just for inspect
[36:25] the troops. Everything was tight
[36:28] and [music] so
[36:31] it's a blessing because they've been
[36:33] Francis was in Edmonton and Ann were in
[36:36] Phoenix and is expensive to celebrate
[36:39] Christmas together. So this is the
[36:41] [music] kind of central place we can
[36:43] drive. So we had a great week this
[36:45] weekend this week with the family and so
[36:49] it's a blessing and this church is
[36:50] already a blessing. Brother Paul, the
[36:52] [music] the the church, the ministry,
[36:54] the music ministry has also been such a
[36:56] blessing for my daughters to be able to
[36:58] find confidence and a place that they
[37:00] can grow. And then brother Kenny and Ike
[37:03] has [music] been such a instrumental and
[37:05] give them confidence and they became
[37:07] uncle Kenny and Uncle Ike for my
[37:10] daughters. [music] And so it this is
[37:12] really really precious, you know, to
[37:13] build friendship through the years.
[37:14] Brother Paul, I love you dearly. I
[37:17] consider you a close friend of mine. And
[37:19] and so this is this this is really
[37:21] precious. And so obviously when brother
[37:23] Paul [clears throat] said, "Well, if
[37:24] you're around, do you want to minister?"
[37:26] Yes. I says, "Yes, of course. It'd be a
[37:28] privilege to [music] share the word
[37:30] again with you." Amen. So we had we had
[37:33] a great week. He said, "I want to
[37:34] congratulate also Solomon and his wife
[37:36] for the new new baby on Christmas. Is
[37:40] that is that something?" Right. Right
[37:43] away my thought was about money like
[37:44] this. you you save money, you know,
[37:46] because you just give one gift and you
[37:48] save on the cake also. You you know, you
[37:50] get a Christmas log, you put a candle on
[37:52] it. So, I thought that's pretty
[37:53] efficient as uh
[37:56] congratulation. Congratulation.
[37:59] Amen. So, we will turn in our Bible this
[38:01] morning and the book of Deuteronomy
[38:03] chapter 18.
[38:17] We wanted to go home tomorrow, but
[38:19] there's a huge storm sitting in Eastern
[38:22] Canada, and it's going to hit quite
[38:24] hard, especially in Quebec. So, you
[38:26] might have to stay another day extra
[38:30] to be safe.
[38:33] I want to entitle this this morning as
[38:35] you turn to Deuteronomy chapter um 18.
[38:38] I want to entitle this as uh I've just
[38:41] hooked my computer. I want to entitle
[38:43] this the greatest purpose. And as a
[38:46] subtitle I want to title this the
[38:49] prophet test.
[38:51] The prophet test. And so we will read
[38:53] Deuteronomy chapter 18 verse
[38:57] 18.
[38:59] I will raise them up a prophet from
[39:01] among their brethren like unto thee, and
[39:04] will put my words in his mouth. And he
[39:09] shall speak unto them all that I shall
[39:11] command him. And it shall come to pass
[39:13] that whosoever will not hearken unto my
[39:15] word, which he shall speak in my name, I
[39:18] will require of him. But the prophet
[39:20] which shall presume to speak a word in
[39:22] my name which I shall have not commanded
[39:24] him to speak or thy shall speak in the
[39:26] name of other gods, even that prophet
[39:28] shall die.
[39:30] And if thou say in thine heart, how
[39:32] shall we know that the word which the
[39:34] Lord hath not spoken? When the prophet
[39:36] speaketh in the name of the Lord, and
[39:38] the thing follow not, nor come to pass,
[39:41] that is the thing which the Lord hath
[39:42] not spoken. But the prophet has spoken
[39:45] it presumptuously, thou shalt not be
[39:47] afraid of him. Amen. Let's bow our head.
[39:50] Lord Jesus, we want to thank you. Such a
[39:52] privilege to be gathered in your house
[39:54] this morning. And Lord, it's it's it's
[39:56] it's a blessing. We we know you are
[39:59] here. It's a promise. We feel your
[40:01] presence through the worship to the
[40:03] special. And Lord, now you want to move
[40:07] in our midst through your word. Take
[40:09] control Lord this morning over every
[40:12] heart, every spirit on our own thought
[40:15] &gt;&gt; and have your way Lord we pray
[40:17] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. Yes.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[40:26] These this morning a couple of service
[40:28] combined together. So I will some some
[40:31] are some part of the sermon I will just
[40:32] give the highlight because you know
[40:34] you've been well taught. I know for sure
[40:37] you've been well taught in the word. And
[40:39] so I will some part of the service I
[40:41] will hit the highlight because I want to
[40:42] reach a certain point.
[40:45] And so I want to talk a little bit this
[40:48] morning as we uh enter into this uh God
[40:52] has gave us keys to discern prophets but
[40:55] also men of God to discern spirits when
[40:58] we talk especially about prophets
[41:00] obviously we know we've received a
[41:01] prophet in our age and sometime it had
[41:03] become lately you know it become
[41:06] question and people start questioning
[41:07] this and it becomes at one point some
[41:10] brings some confusion to the people and
[41:13] at one point they they they they're
[41:14] trying to find a way to like to to be
[41:17] sure that where they stand and what do
[41:19] we believe in and and and so we fall
[41:21] back into this scripture which is called
[41:23] you know we it's it's it's the prophet
[41:25] test because God this is the way that
[41:28] God speak and and you can you can leave
[41:30] my PowerPoint on if if it's okay uh
[41:33] because I'm I'm I'm going to move
[41:34] quickly through those slides. And so we
[41:36] for many years we've looked at
[41:38] Deuteronomy 18 as the prophet test and
[41:40] something that we can rely on to see if
[41:42] if God speak through a man. If somebody
[41:45] comes and say he speaks in the name of
[41:46] the Lord, this is this is the reliable
[41:49] test. Like what if if what if he what he
[41:51] says will come to pass then you can
[41:53] believe him. But you we have instances
[41:56] in the in the Bible, let's just take
[41:58] Jonah Jonah for for for a minute where
[42:01] he he he went through the city and
[42:03] prophesied that the city would be
[42:05] destroyed in in 40 days.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; He didn't say if you don't repent, go
[42:10] look at the scripture. He says that city
[42:12] will be destroyed in 40 years, thus says
[42:15] the Lord. But it never happened within
[42:18] 40 days.
[42:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when the prophet spoke, he
[42:23] spoke the mind of God at that moment.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; But God saw the people's reaction. And
[42:30] when people repented,
[42:33] &gt;&gt; God said he found grace. And so we could
[42:36] say Jonah was a false prophet because
[42:38] what he said didn't happen.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; But he spoke the mind of the Lord at
[42:43] that time. And we know that God doesn't
[42:46] change his mind because you know that
[42:48] city was destroyed later but God give
[42:51] gave grace to those people and delayed
[42:54] the word.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Same thing happened for the king
[42:59] Ezekiah. We say in French Ezekas
[43:02] sometime those it's a bit hard to find
[43:05] the right name how they translate it in
[43:07] English. But that that king got
[43:08] prophesied by the by by a prophet Isaiah
[43:11] that he would die. prepare your house
[43:14] because you're going to die. But then he
[43:16] cries out to God. When he cries out to
[43:19] God, Isaiah is not even out of the
[43:21] court, God says, "Turn around
[43:24] &gt;&gt; now. Go say something else."
[43:27] &gt;&gt; And so when we focus so much on that
[43:30] scripture that if what he says come to
[43:32] pass, then that's like this is the only
[43:35] test. But it's not the only test.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; It's something deeper than that. Right.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; Now the other test is Deuteronomy 13.
[43:45] The the Bible says um if he if there
[43:50] arise among you a prophet or a dreamer
[43:52] of dreams and he giveth thee a sign of
[43:53] our wonder and the sign of the wonder
[43:56] come to pass. So if we think that the
[43:59] only sign if what he says happened then
[44:01] and we must listen to him then God says
[44:04] wherever he spake unto thee saying let
[44:06] us go after other gods which thou hast
[44:09] not known and let us serve them thou
[44:11] shalt not hearken unto the word and so
[44:13] but that prophet what he prophesied
[44:16] happened but the other test is where is
[44:18] he pointing at where does he want to
[44:21] lead you
[44:26] &gt;&gt; because God says he has spoken.
[44:29] He has spoken to turn you away from the
[44:31] Lord your God. So it's not just signs
[44:34] and wonders or prophecy that are
[44:36] fulfilled, but the the other test is
[44:38] also where is he pointing at? Where does
[44:41] he leads you?
[44:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Is he building in and that that prophet
[44:45] test is not just for prophet, it also
[44:47] from ministers,
[44:49] &gt;&gt; you know, where is he pointing at? He
[44:51] can be a good preacher. He can lay out
[44:53] the word, but where what is he trying to
[44:55] build? Is he trying to build his own
[44:56] kingdom or he's bringing in you to
[44:59] Christ? Hallelujah.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; So that brings us into the New Testament
[45:04] which I call the New Testament prophet
[45:07] test. And that prophet test or that
[45:10] spirit test is first John 4 verse one
[45:14] where it says believe beloved believe
[45:16] not every spirit but try the spirits
[45:20] whether they are of God because many
[45:22] false prophets are gone into the world.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Thereby know ye the spirit of God. Every
[45:29] spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ
[45:32] is come in flesh is of God. And every
[45:36] spirit that confessed not that Jesus
[45:38] Christ is come in the flesh is not of
[45:40] God. And this is that the spirit of the
[45:42] antichrist.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; So now we have another another key
[45:47] that's been given to us to test whatever
[45:50] a man of God or or or a prophet is is
[45:53] sent from God is that if he confess that
[45:56] Jesus Christ has come into flesh. Now
[45:58] when when John said that it was relevant
[46:01] because in that time a lot of people
[46:03] denied that you know Jesus was more than
[46:06] a special man that he was a he was a
[46:08] prophet but he was you know God made
[46:10] flesh and so you had people that deny
[46:13] that they wanted to stay with Moses they
[46:15] wanted to stay with the law but right
[46:17] now in the modern Christianity you you
[46:20] don't really find any people that will
[46:22] deny that
[46:25] &gt;&gt; but still a A lot of those modern
[46:28] Christianity portrayed a false religion
[46:32] Babylon but they don't deny that Jesus
[46:34] Christ came into flesh. So sometime we
[46:36] see that scripture says yeah that would
[46:38] work then but it doesn't work now
[46:40] because this is now how we discern
[46:42] because there's so many people out there
[46:44] that are talking about Jesus Christ came
[46:47] into flesh and all that. And so it it
[46:49] becomes like a bit of trick. He's like
[46:51] is that scripture still relevant?
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Can we still apply that scripture? And
[46:56] and lately when I started studying those
[46:58] things as you know uh in our area people
[47:00] started asking questions and doubting
[47:02] and all that I dove and start to study
[47:05] that and share it with also with another
[47:07] pastor and it was a it was a great
[47:08] study. I came to realize that that
[47:11] scripture
[47:13] didn't talk about historical Jesus
[47:16] Christ.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; So the fact that you recognize that one
[47:20] day in the past that Jesus Christ came
[47:22] into flesh is not the test.
[47:26] But the test is be able to recognize
[47:29] Jesus Christ in the flesh today.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Because the Satan has no problem
[47:35] pointing in the past.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; You've done this, he's done that, he's
[47:39] been here, he's been there. Yeah, no
[47:41] problem. But Satan will always fight the
[47:44] manifestation of Christ in our day.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; And that's been a trap laid in every
[47:50] generation from ages to ages. every age
[47:54] fell that trap, they would recognize the
[47:56] Christ manifestation of the past. But
[47:59] missing Christ Christ manifested in our
[48:01] day. And when when I say that some of
[48:04] you is like, "Yeah, Christ manifested in
[48:06] our day was manifested in to a prophet."
[48:09] And I mean if that's what that's where
[48:11] your mind went when I said that you've
[48:14] been trapped
[48:19] &gt;&gt; because what what John refer is
[48:21] referring here he's saying so this is
[48:24] the same scripture but he said then he
[48:26] points where Christ is the next verse is
[48:29] ye are of God little children and have
[48:32] overcome them because greater is he that
[48:35] is in you than he that is in the world.
[48:38] So, we're not looking even though we
[48:40] appreciate and we've found the keys in
[48:43] in finding Christ being manifested in
[48:46] somebody else's life and and in a
[48:48] prophet and God is manifested in your
[48:51] pastor, which is great and you can
[48:52] recognize that. But the key is that you
[48:56] want to see Christ manifested in your
[49:00] life because if he's not in your life,
[49:02] you've missed the greatest purpose of
[49:05] all. That's my title this morning, the
[49:08] greatest purpose.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; My subtitle, the prophet test. But I'm
[49:14] not preaching on prophets this morning.
[49:16] My burden is to preach about you because
[49:19] it was all about you. That's what God
[49:22] had in mind before the foundation of the
[49:24] world. And this is what the ministry of
[49:27] mystery of God is finished. What was the
[49:29] mystery? Sometime we get caught up into
[49:31] mysteries, you know. Well, there was
[49:33] this, there were that, and we we're
[49:35] having in our mind information. Even the
[49:37] seals sometime people think that's
[49:38] information. Well, we learn who was the
[49:40] white horse and we learn about this and
[49:42] we learn about that. But the real
[49:44] mystery of God is not about learning.
[49:47] [clears throat]
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Even though we appreciate learning,
[49:50] &gt;&gt; we need to know these things. It's and
[49:52] it's all good. But we can have our heads
[49:55] filled with knowledge, good, awesome,
[49:57] great knowledge that makes your brain
[49:59] explode. But if you miss the mystery of
[50:02] God, you've missed the greatest purpose
[50:05] of God in your life.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; So the prophecies, Revelation 10, the
[50:11] mystery of God should be finished at the
[50:13] voice of the seventh angel. And I don't
[50:16] want to dwell on those things. That's
[50:17] the highlight I'm going to hit. I'm
[50:18] going to go really quickly because
[50:20] you've been taught these things. I'm
[50:21] using that to go somewhere else.
[50:25] So the greatest thing the mystery of God
[50:29] should be finished. So what is the
[50:31] mystery of God? You know that we then
[50:33] right away we go to Colossians verse
[50:36] chapter 1 verse 26 that the mystery
[50:39] which had been hid from ages and from
[50:42] generation
[50:44] &gt;&gt; but now is made manifest to his saints
[50:46] to whom God would made known in what is
[50:48] the riches of the glory of the mystery
[50:50] among the Gentile which is Christ in
[50:53] you. So that is the mystery, the mystery
[50:56] of Christ. Where is Christ? Christ was
[50:59] in a prophet. Christ is was in his is in
[51:01] his bride. But it's it's it has to get
[51:04] personal. Where is he today? It's still
[51:08] a mystery. He's been revealed personally
[51:11] to you.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Even Revelation 10 finished with you
[51:17] have to eat the book which the book the
[51:20] seals prophet seals is Christ. Those
[51:22] seals are Christ. The book is Christ.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; These are all symbols. But sometime we
[51:26] get lost in symbols.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; But they're not symbols anymore because
[51:31] they got revealed. God hides. When it's
[51:33] a mystery, it's in symbol forms.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; But when it's not a mystery anymore, we
[51:38] know what it is. So we know the book of
[51:40] redemption is Christ. Our name was in
[51:42] the book before the foundation of the
[51:43] world. It means we were in his we were
[51:46] in his mind before the foundation of the
[51:47] world.
[51:48] So if we have to eat the book like
[51:50] Revelation 10:10 says, it means that we
[51:53] have to have Christ in us which is the
[51:56] greatest purpose of all ages that was
[51:58] hidden but reveal in the end time. It's
[52:01] not to have church membership. It's not
[52:03] to become friends with the pastor or a
[52:05] great man of God of know everything
[52:06] about him. It's to have to know that
[52:09] Christ is in me. The hope of glory.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:16] Even Thessalonians revealed to us that
[52:19] when Jesus shall be revealed from heaven
[52:23] with his mighty angels
[52:26] which were seven
[52:29] then right away that scripture goes into
[52:31] verse 8 verse 9 which talk about
[52:33] vengeance and punishment.
[52:35] And so sometime we miss that scripture
[52:38] because we're like well this is not the
[52:40] judgment day but we we know that when
[52:42] that headstone comes down the bride says
[52:45] grace grace
[52:47] &gt;&gt; but during that season tribulation sets
[52:49] on earth it's also judgment
[52:52] &gt;&gt; the prophet says judgment hit the the
[52:55] west coast the bride is not under that
[52:58] judgment but slowly it's it's it's it's
[53:01] progressively entering into tribulation
[53:04] with judgment is going to start hitting
[53:06] the earth and it started in 64.
[53:09] It's a change in the season. But for the
[53:12] bride, we are not seeing that scripture
[53:15] of fllaying fire taking vengeance who
[53:17] shall be punished with everlasting
[53:19] destruction. That doesn't apply to the
[53:21] bride. What applies to the bride is
[53:23] verse 10 and verse 12. So if we use the
[53:27] scripture and skip 8 and n which doesn't
[53:30] apply to the bride
[53:33] I skip eight and nine.
[53:36] Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with
[53:38] his mighty angels when he shall come to
[53:41] be glorified where
[53:45] &gt;&gt; in his saints to be admire in all them
[53:50] that believe
[53:52] in that coming
[53:54] that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[53:56] may be glorified
[53:58] in you which which accomplish which
[54:01] brings the revelation of the greatest
[54:04] mystery of God which is Christ in us.
[54:07] And so that was the purpose of that
[54:10] message.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; And so if we go back to the prophet
[54:14] test, the prophet test is you want to
[54:16] discern a prophet, you want to discern
[54:20] spirits.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; The test is what was the climax of that
[54:25] man?
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; What was the climax of the prophet's
[54:29] ministry? all the healings and all the
[54:32] teaching that all his ministry was not
[54:35] about that. It was about a climax and
[54:39] the climax was to be able to point to
[54:41] Christ but not just Christ up there but
[54:44] Christ coming down but coming down where
[54:47] Christ in the bride and so if you can
[54:50] summarize the ministry of a man and try
[54:54] you don't have to be an expert in bridge
[54:56] building you don't have to become an
[54:58] archaeologist you don't have to be an
[55:00] expert in US history all you have to do
[55:03] is to bring to filter a ministry
[55:05] ministry, a prophet ministry through the
[55:08] scriptures, what was he trying to do?
[55:11] How can we summarize his whole ministry?
[55:13] And if his whole ministry and the climax
[55:16] of everything he did was to point to
[55:18] Christ in in in human flesh, then you
[55:22] meet first John 4 test prophet test.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Some people want to judge if that
[55:29] prophecy has been accomplished. Has that
[55:31] one's been fulfilled? And how do you
[55:33] know? You're not the one who spoken it.
[55:34] That's right. That's right.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; We would need to disqualify Jonah
[55:38] because he said it would be destroyed
[55:40] &gt;&gt; and it didn't happen because something
[55:42] else moved in the scene and people got
[55:44] repented and then the king repented and
[55:46] God says, "Okay, I'm delaying this." But
[55:48] we are not we're not witness of what's
[55:51] going on when God speaks something
[55:52] through a prophet, what's going on in
[55:54] heaven. and what that word cause a
[55:56] reaction and then people change and they
[55:58] do this and God says okay since you've
[56:00] done that I'll send this prophet again
[56:02] or things are moving but we've seen many
[56:06] for many years we've seen prophecy like
[56:08] a concrete block
[56:10] &gt;&gt; but God is alive and he's working with
[56:13] his people and sometime he sends a word
[56:16] because that's like a picture of that
[56:18] moment at that moment this is what God
[56:21] is saying
[56:23] &gt;&gt; but then people move They repent.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; They adjust because God has spoken. God
[56:28] God is like I don't want to sound
[56:30] sacriiggious, but God is dancing with
[56:32] you. He's alive. He's moving with you.
[56:35] He's not rigid like a concrete block
[56:37] like the law.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; He's alive.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; So when he sends his word, he sees your
[56:43] reaction.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; But we've seen the word as something
[56:47] that is is not moving. And now we can
[56:51] disqualify true men of God because they
[56:54] said something but later on it turn into
[56:56] something else.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; So this is not the prophet test.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; It is partially
[57:04] &gt;&gt; but the the real New Testament prophet
[57:06] test is where that minister where does
[57:10] that prophet points the people to
[57:13] &gt;&gt; and what is his greatest purpose?
[57:16] &gt;&gt; You even finished the seven church age
[57:18] book and he at the end he's there. I'm
[57:19] not here to create a following.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to build denomination. I am
[57:25] here to build a strong relationship
[57:27] between the people and God.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; So the pinnacle of his ministry is when
[57:41] he preached Christ is the mystery of God
[57:43] revealed. Then he lays out the three
[57:46] great purposes of God hidden from ages
[57:49] and generation. It's been hidden. It's
[57:51] been fought. Satan has fought every age.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; And every age has fallen into trap of of
[57:56] of of of
[57:59] be able to see only God manifested in
[58:02] their messengers.
[58:04] &gt;&gt; It was like God was in Luther. My we
[58:07] built a church around him. We created a
[58:08] movement around him. He was such a great
[58:10] man of God. But they miss because if
[58:13] Christ were in them, they would have
[58:15] moved in next with Wesley and then they
[58:17] would have recognized Isa Street because
[58:20] Luther was there to bring them to Christ
[58:23] &gt;&gt; and then Christ would lead you to more
[58:24] light and every ages fall in that trap.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; They did recognize their messenger.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; But today in 2025, that's not the
[58:36] challenge. That's right.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; The challenge is to recognize where is
[58:39] Christ
[58:40] &gt;&gt; now.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; And yes, of course, it went to men like
[58:44] Luther and Wesley and Aza Street and
[58:46] William Brham and all these great men of
[58:48] God. There's been a restoration. There's
[58:50] been there's been a building, but to hit
[58:53] a climax and the climax is you and
[58:56] Christ together, this invisible union.
[58:59] Hallelujah.
[59:02] So the first purpose was that God wanted
[59:05] to reveal himself to the people.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; He wanted so badly and this is if you
[59:11] feel my motive this morning.
[59:14] It's it's it's to bring this this
[59:17] awareness cuz we can caught we can get
[59:19] caught up into churches and this and
[59:22] that and this one says this and then
[59:24] then we get lost in the purpose and when
[59:27] we lose the real purpose we fall into
[59:29] religion
[59:31] &gt;&gt; and we don't want religion. We want
[59:33] something alive and that life is a
[59:35] personal relationship. Yes, brother so
[59:37] and so can do this and sister so and so
[59:39] can do. God bless her heart. She's led
[59:42] this way. But what is God asking you?
[59:45] What is the manifestation of the spirit
[59:47] of God in your life?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; God is not a cookie cutter where
[59:52] everybody's going to be the same. But
[59:54] for many years, we wanted people to be
[59:56] the same.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; You see that quote and we use quotes
[59:59] like a cut a cookie cutter.
[1:00:03] forgetting that that the word is alive
[1:00:06] and the and and Christ when he gets in
[1:00:09] your life, he will use you the way
[1:00:11] you've been brought up in your
[1:00:12] personality. I have my own personality.
[1:00:15] I'm not like brother Paul
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; and he's not like me. And God doesn't
[1:00:20] want us to be the same.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; But we fellowship with the differences
[1:00:24] knowing that God is using him. He's
[1:00:26] using me and he wants to use you. And
[1:00:30] you don't have to pattern yourself about
[1:00:32] somebody else or another minister or
[1:00:34] another deacon. Well, that church, the
[1:00:35] deacons though, they do this, this, and
[1:00:38] that. Bless their heart. If it works for
[1:00:40] them, great.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean it's going to work here.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Well, how are we going to know? God
[1:00:47] wants to reveal it to you.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; So, that's the desire of God. He wants
[1:00:53] to reveal himself to the people. The
[1:00:56] second purpose is to have the
[1:00:59] preeeminence.
[1:01:01] Now every age fell in almost every age
[1:01:03] fell in that trap that the messenger had
[1:01:05] the preeeminence which was not the
[1:01:08] desire of God. The desire of God is that
[1:01:11] Christ would have the preeminence in his
[1:01:13] body of believers that his bride that he
[1:01:16] might live in his people
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; which is the greatest purpose of God
[1:01:22] which is revelation 10 in Colossians
[1:01:25] chapter 1. He wants to be in you
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; and thirdly to restore the kingdom to
[1:01:31] its righty position.
[1:01:34] If you want to summarize the prophet's
[1:01:36] purpose, Christ because that was not his
[1:01:38] own purpose. He would have been a
[1:01:41] hillbilly and and and probably a drunker
[1:01:43] like his dad.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; But God saved him from that.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz he had a purpose.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; So he sent this man with no schooling,
[1:01:51] no good background
[1:01:55] for a purpose. And that purpose is
[1:01:57] summarized here
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; to let us know that.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Don't you think the devil will let us go
[1:02:06] like that without a fight?
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Right in the days of Paul,
[1:02:12] Paul knew the mystery of iniquity does
[1:02:15] already work. Amen.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; As he's speaking, as he establishing the
[1:02:19] church, that spirit is already crawling
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; to to switch to shift the focus.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; And it's been a fight in every age.
[1:02:30] Shift the focus. [snorts]
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Shift the focus.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; And already in the book of Revelation in
[1:02:36] the first age, the second age, they talk
[1:02:38] about the deeds of the nicicoatans. And
[1:02:40] and you know that it's I'm still trying
[1:02:42] to hit the highlights.
[1:02:45] And from the deeds it became the
[1:02:48] doctrine
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; and the doctrine of the nicolate and and
[1:02:52] and history thought that that was like a
[1:02:55] group of people that were really bad at
[1:02:57] founded a religion and all that.
[1:02:59] Actually, we know that the meaning is to
[1:03:01] to conquer ley
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; and conquer ley is to remove the
[1:03:06] manifestation of Christ in your life and
[1:03:09] to put it solely onto into inside of a
[1:03:12] perfect saint in front of you that
[1:03:15] everyone admires.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; And that's been the fight in all ages,
[1:03:20] all seven ages. That spirit would would
[1:03:22] never if if if if you recognize a holy
[1:03:25] man, if you recognize a prophet and he
[1:03:27] cannot shift you away from that, he
[1:03:30] wants to remove the presence of Christ
[1:03:32] in your life and say, "Well, how great
[1:03:34] was he?" Huh?
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; To conquer ley is to remove the
[1:03:40] manifestation to remove Christ out of
[1:03:43] your life. And if you're sitting in
[1:03:45] church, he will put you and if he cannot
[1:03:48] send you away from church, he will allow
[1:03:50] you to be sitting there crossarm
[1:03:52] admiring the manifestation of Christ in
[1:03:54] your pastor.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's such brother Paul, man, that's
[1:03:58] such a a man of God. And that church,
[1:04:00] man, is so amazing. What about you? I
[1:04:02] don't know.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; You've been tricked
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; because brother Paul has been sent. This
[1:04:09] church's been sent. But why? right
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; to promote
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; to push a manifestation in your life.
[1:04:17] But that spirit that right away Paul he
[1:04:20] call it the mystery of iniquity
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; that was the first horse rider
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; and either horse rider is still here but
[1:04:28] today it's different because today it's
[1:04:30] spiritual death because if not Christ is
[1:04:32] not in you
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; you're going into the tribulation
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; into the day of judgment. But if Christ
[1:04:41] is in you then you have a call come up
[1:04:43] higher.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:48] And that's exactly when you talk about
[1:04:50] con to conquer ley that's exactly what
[1:04:55] the first horse rider did because that's
[1:04:58] first horse rider came he was dressed in
[1:05:00] white so he's tricky you think he's a
[1:05:02] good guy but he's not and a crown is
[1:05:05] given unto him but he went for
[1:05:06] conquering and to conquer which those
[1:05:09] two words so he went to nikao and to
[1:05:12] nika
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; which is nicolatan so he went to conquer
[1:05:16] But he went to conquer who
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; the ley.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; And what was the purpose? How does he
[1:05:23] conquer? Remove Christ out of your life.
[1:05:26] Remove the spiritual leading. God wants
[1:05:28] to lead sons of God by the spirit of
[1:05:30] God. But he wants to remove that. You
[1:05:33] sitting there and you can admire. Oh,
[1:05:35] praise the Lord. This brother is led.
[1:05:36] Wow. Praise the Lord. This pastor is
[1:05:38] doing such a great work. But what about
[1:05:39] you?
[1:05:42] Christ wants to come establish himself
[1:05:45] inside of you the temple of God and live
[1:05:48] inside of you, fellowship with you, lead
[1:05:51] you, activate those gifts that for you
[1:05:53] to be grace, grace, mercy for your
[1:05:56] generation that you become Jesus walking
[1:05:59] in flesh. And that is the purpose of
[1:06:02] God. That's why the prophet says, I
[1:06:04] didn't come to create a following people
[1:06:06] that's going to admire me. Even though
[1:06:08] we admired him,
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; but it doesn't stop there.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Because there's a greatest purpose.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; But it's been tricky. Oh, it's been
[1:06:18] tricky. Every age has been tricked.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; So the prophet says Paul saw it coming,
[1:06:31] but he warned them about this subtle
[1:06:33] priesthood that would come and take over
[1:06:35] with its false doctrines. He knew they
[1:06:37] would implement a way of worship that
[1:06:39] excluded the people from any part in a
[1:06:42] holy spirit ministry.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; And even right today among those who
[1:06:46] claim to be free and full of the spirit,
[1:06:48] there is not too much freedom in the
[1:06:50] lady. And the best day we can see is a
[1:06:52] few preachers with inspired preaching
[1:06:54] while the flock just flocks just sits
[1:06:57] there and tried to absorb this.
[1:07:00] This is a far cry from Paul who said
[1:07:02] that when all came together all had the
[1:07:05] leading of the spirit and all
[1:07:06] participated in spiritual worship.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; But the problem is that it happened in
[1:07:14] every age. One at one point the
[1:07:16] messenger is used by God to promote
[1:07:20] Christ and the people. Yeah.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; But when Satan takes over, he'll use the
[1:07:25] messenger to kill the movement of the
[1:07:27] spirit in people's life.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; You imagine one day somebody that was in
[1:07:32] the Lutheran church felt the leading and
[1:07:35] it it is hard. It's like I don't think
[1:07:37] it's right to smoke cigars.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; I know our messenger did, but
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; I feel in my heart that God is holy and
[1:07:44] we have to be different. And you see an
[1:07:46] elder that's Lutheran say, "You go sit
[1:07:48] down." Our messenger was smoking. So who
[1:07:53] are you?
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Where do you come from? But the Holy
[1:07:56] Spirit wanted to move deeper in the
[1:07:59] word. Deeper in the word. But now that
[1:08:02] spirit's taking control and using the
[1:08:05] same messenger that God is using, but
[1:08:07] now using it to kill the revival.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; It happened all the time.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; They try to destroy Jesus ministry with
[1:08:17] Moses. that was a prophet of God.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; They did the same thing with John the
[1:08:24] Baptist.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; When the US invaded Iraq in 2003,
[1:08:30] they found there were 65,000 followers
[1:08:32] of John the Baptist.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; 2003
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; called a mendin or something like that.
[1:08:38] All dressed in white, all about
[1:08:39] purification. They still baptized, but
[1:08:41] for them Jesus is a fraud.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus is an impostor.
[1:08:47] The prophet said the first coming and
[1:08:50] the second second coming will be
[1:08:51] parallel in every way.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; But they found their security and their
[1:08:58] safety. In John the Baptist, he was
[1:09:00] their messenger. We feel safe.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; We're with the right guy.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; We're with the right guy. With him, we
[1:09:06] feel safe.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; But as you said lately, we fellowship on
[1:09:11] that. He was not the light,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; but he testified to the light.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; So even Martin Luther said, "The Pope
[1:09:22] and his bishops have nothing to do but
[1:09:24] impose burdens on souls and strip them
[1:09:26] of their possession instead of guiding
[1:09:28] them to Christ, which is the prophetess.
[1:09:32] Where do you lead people?" But he has
[1:09:36] not separated the people into classes so
[1:09:39] that the masses are led by the holy
[1:09:40] priesthood. Nor is there a place there
[1:09:43] where they are separate in their worship
[1:09:45] of the Lord. God wants all to love and
[1:09:47] serve him together. Nicoleism destroyed
[1:09:50] those precepts and instead separates the
[1:09:52] ministers from the people and make the
[1:09:54] leaders overlord instead of servants.
[1:10:04] Now I want to switch into my part two.
[1:10:07] Why is it this way? Why it why is this a
[1:10:11] pattern?
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; It's a pattern because there's something
[1:10:15] inside human being. It's called innate.
[1:10:18] You say innate idolatry.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Idolatry permeated into people. Idolatry
[1:10:25] is in the people. It's in this flesh
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; and it rises heads all the time.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; So let's let's look at couple of
[1:10:36] examples of idolatry and and see and try
[1:10:40] to for God help us this morning to see
[1:10:42] to see the pattern and and be able to
[1:10:45] understand and that that study would
[1:10:47] give us some keys.
[1:10:49] So when we talk about idolatry, we need
[1:10:51] to go to Exodus chapter 20. And God
[1:10:55] says, "I am the Lord thy God, which have
[1:10:57] brought thee out of the land of Egypt,
[1:10:58] out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt
[1:11:00] have not no other gods before me. Thou
[1:11:03] shalt not make unto thee any graven
[1:11:05] image or any likeness of anything that
[1:11:08] is in heaven above or that is in the
[1:11:09] earth beneath. Thou shalt not bow down
[1:11:12] thyself to them." And Jesus comes and in
[1:11:15] Luke 4 and he and he and he says the
[1:11:17] same thing. He says, Jesus answer unto
[1:11:19] them, get deep behind me, Satan, for it
[1:11:22] is written, thou shalt worship the Lord
[1:11:24] thy God, and him only thou shalt serve.
[1:11:27] So he he's repeating that commandment,
[1:11:29] that instruction, thou shalt not
[1:11:31] worship.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:34] any other gods.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; But this he says that in chapter 20 and
[1:11:42] we jumped in chapter 32
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; and they're like
[1:11:47] make us gods.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; But why did they feel like they needed
[1:11:53] something is because the prophet was
[1:11:55] gone for too long.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; The prophet went up the mountain. It's
[1:12:00] like he's not returning.
[1:12:02] But for a little while they were hoping
[1:12:04] he was returning.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; They also believe in the return ministry
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; because they needed something. They need
[1:12:10] human flesh. They could not have
[1:12:12] confidence that the manifestation of God
[1:12:15] in their human flesh. They need to
[1:12:17] cleave unto God in human flesh outside
[1:12:19] of them. And since that prophet was gone
[1:12:22] for too long that idolatry start to rise
[1:12:25] inside of them that needed. We need a
[1:12:28] God we can touch. Aaron, give us
[1:12:31] something.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Which Aaron represents the miniful
[1:12:35] ministry.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; Put us something in front of our eyes.
[1:12:40] We can worship and feel confident about
[1:12:42] ourselves.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Instead of pointing, Aaron should have
[1:12:47] said, "What are you guys talking about?
[1:12:49] God [screaming] is with us. Yes, Moses
[1:12:51] on the top of the mountain. The put a
[1:12:53] pill of fire is here. The one who
[1:12:55] brought us out of Egypt will make us I
[1:12:57] don't know what's going to happen with
[1:12:58] Moses. God knows. Let us have faith and
[1:13:01] believe that this pillar of fire gonna
[1:13:03] lead us to and that was supposed to be
[1:13:05] the the role of Aaron. But he collapsed
[1:13:07] [screaming] under the pressure of the
[1:13:09] people
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; cuz they wanted something a god they can
[1:13:14] relate and they could touch.
[1:13:19] So when the people saw Moses delayed to
[1:13:22] come the lost of a prophet
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; they say make us gods which shall go
[1:13:29] before us for as for this Moses the men
[1:13:33] that brought us up out of the land of
[1:13:34] Egypt we were not what he's become of
[1:13:37] him
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; and that was just a couple of days
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; right
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; that's not much
[1:13:45] it just come out of Egypt. They're
[1:13:47] probably not mentally strong. Their
[1:13:48] faith is weak.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; But the ministry should have support
[1:13:53] them.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; But the ministry was not strong enough
[1:13:56] either.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; The Levites, Aaron.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; And he
[1:14:05] and he did it.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; And God was like, if I was talking and I
[1:14:10] was God, like, what are you guys doing?
[1:14:12] Like,
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; can I not talk? Can I not remove my
[1:14:14] prophet for a couple of days and you
[1:14:16] guys collapse and but they were freshly
[1:14:19] come out of Egypt. So idolatry was still
[1:14:21] inside of them. So they wanted something
[1:14:22] they related to that they're used to.
[1:14:27] And also
[1:14:29] one of the reason this happened is that
[1:14:31] in Exodus 20, God said
[1:14:35] when God said bring the people to the
[1:14:37] bottom of the mountain because God
[1:14:39] wanted to speak directly to the people
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; which is the purpose of God also.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, God speaks through prophet. Yes, he
[1:14:47] did send a prophet. But you know what?
[1:14:49] Today you also want it's not a
[1:14:52] competition like when we preach that
[1:14:54] sometime people like well he wants to
[1:14:55] get rid of the prophet that's not the
[1:14:56] point
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; but the point is he also wants to reveal
[1:14:59] he wants to lead you the Bible says sons
[1:15:02] of God are led by the spirits of God it
[1:15:05] doesn't say prophet only or preacher
[1:15:07] only but sons and daughters of God are
[1:15:10] led by the spirit of God
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; and obviously we know if it's against
[1:15:15] the word you know it's a false spirit
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; but he wants to lead you.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; So God wants to speak directly to you
[1:15:23] like he wanted to speak directly to
[1:15:25] Israel.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; But you know what they did?
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; The mountain was shaking. There was
[1:15:30] lightning. There was thunder. People
[1:15:32] were just frightened.
[1:15:34] And they said unto Moses, "Speak thou
[1:15:36] with us, and we will hear, but let not
[1:15:40] God speak with us."
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; We want to hear about the prophet. We
[1:15:45] want a prophet speak, but
[1:15:47] the rest that's scary. Like God's going
[1:15:49] to lead me. How do I How do I know God?
[1:15:51] I I don't know.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Let the prophet say it.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Let the prophet say it. So, you see the
[1:16:00] pattern.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's been the challenge of
[1:16:04] ages and generation. That's why
[1:16:06] Colossians says that mystery that's been
[1:16:08] hidden from ages and generations, which
[1:16:12] was what? Christ in us
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; wants to speak directly to you. Wants to
[1:16:17] have fellowship directly with you.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; But how many people today like oh no I
[1:16:24] prefer to hear it on the tape.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; I prefer no let let the prophet say it
[1:16:28] like who am I? Who am I?
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Who am I to say anything? Who am I to
[1:16:32] have my own leading? That's scary.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; What if I do a mistake? What if I have
[1:16:38] it wrong? Go do a mistake.
[1:16:41] Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; God's going to teach you.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; If you do a mistake, you think it's the
[1:16:46] end of the world,
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; God is going to tell you, "Okay,
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; good try, son. I'm happy you try. You
[1:16:52] try it. Now, let's do better." Next time
[1:16:55] I was talking with you, I said left, you
[1:16:57] went right. Well, let's say I said
[1:16:59] right, you went left. It's better.
[1:17:08] Verse 21. And the people stood a far off
[1:17:12] and they just said, "Moses, you're the
[1:17:14] one who talks to God. We're going to
[1:17:16] stay far from God and we want you in
[1:17:19] between."
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; But do you see the purpose? God took
[1:17:21] Israel out of Egypt in the desert to
[1:17:23] meet to have that meeting at the
[1:17:25] mountain where God comes down.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing in our age. God came
[1:17:32] down.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Prophet brought us to the foot of the
[1:17:35] mountain.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; God came down. And now there's supposed
[1:17:39] to be that connection.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; And prophet said, "If this is it, I must
[1:17:44] decrease
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; and he must increase."
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; This is the appointment. This is the
[1:17:48] greatest purpose. I've set up the
[1:17:50] appointment. Elizer set up the
[1:17:52] appointment.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; You love this man. You love this wife.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Get married so I may decrease.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; But people are like, "No, no, no, no,
[1:18:01] no, no, no. Stay with us."
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; So history repeat itself. all the time.
[1:18:08] It's a mystery from ages from
[1:18:10] generation.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Other example that are pretty amazing.
[1:18:16] But you talk about the brazen serpent.
[1:18:18] Now remember God said don't do any
[1:18:21] image.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; Don't do anything. So some people think
[1:18:23] the Bible contradicts itself but it
[1:18:25] doesn't. God said to the people you
[1:18:28] don't do it on yourself.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; But then God came and says now I'm
[1:18:32] asking you to do one.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Which is totally different. Right.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; So what what did did Moses made a
[1:18:38] mistake
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; because at one point he says thus said
[1:18:41] the Lord God says don't do any image and
[1:18:43] then he comes down and he says now thus
[1:18:45] said the Lord do one
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; we'll start a website
[1:18:50] Moses was a fraud.com
[1:18:54] you see how things are moving the word
[1:18:56] is alive
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; if you so if you want to disqualify
[1:19:00] Moses you got a basis here and there's
[1:19:03] sure many other places.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Don't do it and then do it like
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; now. What's amazing is that God says,
[1:19:15] "Do that serpent and put him on a on a
[1:19:18] stick, that fiery serpent, and when you
[1:19:21] want to and when you're going to look at
[1:19:22] that serpent, you're going to get
[1:19:24] healed.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; If you're dying, if you look at this,
[1:19:27] you're going to you're going to live."
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; And it was it was an amazing revival.
[1:19:32] And that serpent, even though for us
[1:19:34] it's quite amazing that God would do
[1:19:35] that, that serpent was a revival. God
[1:19:38] sent life in the camp using that as an
[1:19:43] instrument for people to have faith in
[1:19:46] something they could see. And God was in
[1:19:48] it.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; But you know what happened?
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; They kept it.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; They're like, "Wow, that worked. Let's
[1:19:55] keep the serpent
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; because and and and I can I can imagine,
[1:20:00] you know, how many testimonies that came
[1:20:02] out of those that healing campaign.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; It was a healing campaign.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Everybody got healed. So you you can
[1:20:09] imagine how many years that they would
[1:20:11] they would witness, oh yeah, my uncle
[1:20:13] was there that day. He was he was he was
[1:20:15] 60 feet from that. Like Moses came and
[1:20:17] he put it there and my uncle was 60 feet
[1:20:20] from that. He was so close to the
[1:20:22] platform when the the the serpent when
[1:20:24] that happened.
[1:20:25] And then he looked and he was like he
[1:20:27] was sick. He was about to die. Somebody
[1:20:29] had to turn his head cuz he was like he
[1:20:32] couldn't even move. And men talk about
[1:20:34] and say you know you know how testimony
[1:20:36] sometime gets bigger with the years,
[1:20:37] right? And so so they move his head and
[1:20:40] they open his eyes and when he saw that
[1:20:42] he was brother they was I mean you
[1:20:44] should have been and and the kids are
[1:20:46] listening to that because they were not
[1:20:47] there and they're like oh man. And but
[1:20:50] you know we still have the serpent.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:20:54] And then the years goes by and and all
[1:20:56] the witness that's been there are now
[1:20:57] dying. And now we find in the camp
[1:20:59] someone that's still alive.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; So it goes behind the pulpit and
[1:21:04] brother. Yes, sisters. I was there that
[1:21:07] day when Moses and it became the
[1:21:10] attraction every Easter. Well, every
[1:21:12] year, you know, they bring that
[1:21:13] testimony of of what happened with that
[1:21:16] serpent and and and then the last man
[1:21:18] dies and now we have no more witness,
[1:21:20] but we still have the serpent. Wow.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; And that lasted probably for so many
[1:21:28] years because when when Josiah came in 2
[1:21:31] Kings verse 18,
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; the serpent was still that brazen
[1:21:37] serpent was still there. But now they
[1:21:40] are burning incense to it and they they
[1:21:42] gave him a name and now they're
[1:21:44] worshiping the thing because God has
[1:21:46] used that so mightily
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; that they felt safe because uncle so and
[1:21:52] so and grandpa was there and he got
[1:21:54] healed so that thing worked not
[1:21:56] realizing that was that was an
[1:21:58] instrument temporarily
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; for you to believe God is a healer. If
[1:22:03] he did then he can do it now but you
[1:22:06] don't need the the the instrument.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; You need a connection with God.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Now, what's amazing is that it's not
[1:22:17] Josiah. It's Ezekiel. He was as the 16th
[1:22:20] kings in Judah, which was about 500 700
[1:22:25] years later
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; they're offering incense. So, you see
[1:22:30] how from years to year it becomes bigger
[1:22:32] and bigger and bigger and now it's not
[1:22:34] even look at it. Now, he give it a name
[1:22:35] and offer him incense.
[1:22:38] a Christian nation
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; built on that principle. Thy shall not
[1:22:44] have any image. Thou shalt not worship
[1:22:46] it.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; God didn't say worship it. God says look
[1:22:49] at it.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; So you see the principle, the pattern.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; It's constant.
[1:22:59] Same thing first Samuel about about the
[1:23:02] ark of the covenant.
[1:23:04] So, Israel is in defeat and and
[1:23:06] Philistines are are winning the the
[1:23:08] battle. Now, they're afraid and and so
[1:23:10] they said, "Let's go get the ark of the
[1:23:12] covenant and bring the ark of the
[1:23:14] covenant in the camp. It may save us out
[1:23:18] of the hands of our enemies." Think
[1:23:20] about a thought. Now, the ark of the
[1:23:22] covenant was the closest thing you can
[1:23:23] get to God. That, you know, the the the
[1:23:26] ten commandments were inside and and the
[1:23:28] arc covenant, nobody could touch it if
[1:23:30] they would die. It represent the
[1:23:31] presence of God. So they're like okay
[1:23:33] God because you know Israel was
[1:23:35] defeated. Eli the pastor his two sons
[1:23:38] were backsliden. Eli was back. So Israel
[1:23:40] is not a good in good terms with God and
[1:23:43] suddenly they want to get a hold of
[1:23:44] something. So they're like you know what
[1:23:46] we're going to win if we bring the ark.
[1:23:48] Now what's amazing is the Philistine are
[1:23:51] they they were idol worshipper.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; So they really believe in those kind of
[1:23:56] thing. So when they saw the ark coming
[1:23:58] Israel was like oh man we're dead. we're
[1:24:01] good as dead.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; But they didn't know God was not there.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; But they thought if they bring the ark,
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; then God is with us.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; And and it's the same thing that ages
[1:24:14] has done every age, if we keep the
[1:24:16] message, if we bring back the messenger
[1:24:18] constantly, it means God is with us.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; And it becomes something that that
[1:24:25] should be a blessing. it become a trap
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; and a dying religion.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; So the Philistines were like oh no and
[1:24:35] they were afraid because they said
[1:24:37] because they are idol worshipper
[1:24:38] themselves they said God is coming to
[1:24:40] the camp because Israel had such a
[1:24:43] revival that the the earth tremble. The
[1:24:45] Bible says the earth trembled because
[1:24:47] they were shouting. They had such a
[1:24:49] revival. Hallelujah. The ark is there.
[1:24:51] You know they got excited. The music and
[1:24:53] all this. Praise the Lord. And the Bible
[1:24:56] says the earth ring. So Philistine was
[1:24:58] like, "We're good as dead."
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; They really believe it. You talk about
[1:25:01] faith in something. They have faith so
[1:25:04] much in the ark that this would bring
[1:25:06] the presence of God. But they had it
[1:25:08] wrong because what God wants is a broken
[1:25:11] spirit and a contrite heart. He doesn't
[1:25:13] want artifacts.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; God is looking for a heart that is
[1:25:19] contrite. A heart that is broken. A
[1:25:21] heart that's going to humble itself. And
[1:25:23] then he's going to come down.
[1:25:25] Now if you rely on so artifact or
[1:25:27] historical events, historical events has
[1:25:30] no power.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; And then Israel went through a better
[1:25:38] defeat, a slaughter. You imagine the
[1:25:41] confusion when you go back to your tent
[1:25:42] that night.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; I believe in that message for all those
[1:25:45] years.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Can't believe we're been defeated this
[1:25:48] way.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Put my trust in that. It's probably all
[1:25:51] fake anyway.
[1:25:53] I was told the ark had such a power
[1:25:55] people could touch it and die. I was
[1:25:57] told this is all nonsense. It was all
[1:25:59] fake. There's no power in that.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Imagine how many people walked away of
[1:26:05] the believing the ark that it was
[1:26:06] something special.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; It was something special, but they've
[1:26:10] misused it.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; And in misusing something that was sent
[1:26:16] from God, [screaming] there was no
[1:26:18] effect. Is that Jesus said because of
[1:26:20] your tradition? You make the the word of
[1:26:23] God have no effect.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Gideon's ephod. You saw you say ephod.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Ephod. Sorry my
[1:26:40] so amazing. Gideon. Why a man of God
[1:26:43] bring such a revival in in the camp?
[1:26:46] Victory defeated. A victory is not
[1:26:49] supposed to happen. There are 300 and
[1:26:52] they come and have such a great victory.
[1:26:54] And so, so again, same thing happened.
[1:26:58] Israel find confidence. Finally, we have
[1:26:59] a man we can rely somebody we going to
[1:27:01] look on to. God is with him. And so, if
[1:27:03] God is with him, we're safe. He's going
[1:27:05] to lead us in victory. So, they feel
[1:27:06] comfortable and all that. But now, the
[1:27:08] problem is Gideon's getting old.
[1:27:13] That's why sometime God will pull out
[1:27:15] his own men. He's he's using
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; because everybody is leaning on him
[1:27:20] heavily.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; And yes, God is in that man, but his
[1:27:24] purpose is to be in you.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; He wants to be in your life.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; So, at one point, yes, God will will
[1:27:31] will pull out a man that you stand on
[1:27:34] your own and you'll be you'll be
[1:27:35] unbalanced for a while. Oh Lord, what's
[1:27:37] going on? You're not with us anymore.
[1:27:38] And like God's like, wake up.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; I'm here.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; You're not looking in the right place.
[1:27:47] So when when when when Gideon gets old,
[1:27:49] then the men of Israel said unto Gideon,
[1:27:52] "Rule thou over us,
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; but thou thy son and thy sons sons
[1:27:59] also."
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; That they want to establish a lineage
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; to feel safe knowing that after Gideon
[1:28:06] leaves, his son's going to take over.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; And after his sons leaves, his son's
[1:28:12] going to take over. So we can build
[1:28:13] build some headquarters
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; and feel safe that we're following a
[1:28:17] lineage of godly men.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; It's a pattern. And in the Bible that's
[1:28:21] called idolatry
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; cuz that's not that was not God's
[1:28:25] purpose.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; But they want to build a system out of
[1:28:29] something that God has done
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; and it's been the trap for ages and
[1:28:33] generation.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; But the mystery of Christ that it's been
[1:28:37] hidden from ages and generation is
[1:28:39] Christ not only in Gideon. Christ not
[1:28:42] only in Moses, Christ not only in
[1:28:44] William Brown, but Christ in you,
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; your hope of glory.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Now, what's good is that Gideon didn't
[1:28:51] bite onto this. He didn't he didn't play
[1:28:52] the game. He's like, "No, that's not
[1:28:54] happening. I will not rule over you.
[1:28:56] Neither shall my son rule over you. The
[1:28:59] Lord shall rule over you." So, he had it
[1:29:01] straight. He's like, "Good, Gideon.
[1:29:03] Praise the Lord." But then
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; he made an ephod.
[1:29:10] So even though in his own desire he
[1:29:13] wanted to block idolatry
[1:29:16] which is putting something between you
[1:29:18] and God which human being does all the
[1:29:20] time
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; and we've done it and then we wake up
[1:29:24] God is like your focus is at wrong place
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; and God sometime will allow a man of God
[1:29:28] to make a mistake because you're looking
[1:29:30] at him too much
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; you're not seeing Christ through him you
[1:29:33] are caught up in the veil
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; so God will show you a flaw in the veil
[1:29:39] for you to turn your hearts to God.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; But some some sometime people get so
[1:29:44] disappointed when they see a flaw in the
[1:29:46] veil that they throw the veil and God in
[1:29:48] the garbage.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; There's flaws in every man of God.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Why it it's on purpose? Because God
[1:29:56] wants you to keep your eyes on him.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; That's what's happening with so many
[1:30:01] disillusioned people. They throw
[1:30:04] everything out because they saw a flaw.
[1:30:07] Welcome.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; If you see a flaw, praise the Lord. It
[1:30:11] was about time.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; That's what I tell people when they come
[1:30:14] to our church. We all always when people
[1:30:16] first time visit our church, they always
[1:30:17] think we are great people.
[1:30:20] And wow, such an atmosphere. You people
[1:30:22] are so loving and yes, we are we are we
[1:30:24] are that. Yes, we are loving and
[1:30:26] welcoming. you come, we're all going to
[1:30:28] surround you with love and my you're
[1:30:30] going to feel really special like the
[1:30:31] couple of first service you come and
[1:30:34] then and it's not because it's a fraud,
[1:30:36] you know, it's it's genuine. It's it's
[1:30:38] it's the reality, but I'm like, wait,
[1:30:41] it's all true, but there's there's
[1:30:43] another side. It's not it's not the dark
[1:30:45] side, but it's it's the human side.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; There's going to be flaws. You realize
[1:30:50] there's some people are there that don't
[1:30:52] know what they're doing there. And you
[1:30:54] know, you're going to you're going to
[1:30:55] realize that these are just human being
[1:30:57] that love the Lord.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Because I don't want you to be so
[1:31:01] excited and then one one year down the
[1:31:02] road, you're going to leave this place,
[1:31:04] well, they're just a bunch of hypocrite.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Their selling game is amazing. They feel
[1:31:08] like a lovely, but then after that
[1:31:09] realize they have flaws.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Cuz your eyes need to be on God.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; No perfect church, no perfect deacons,
[1:31:19] no perfect pastors,
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; no perfect prophets.
[1:31:23] Even though for many years
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; we've been sold the perfect prophets.
[1:31:28] Never any mistakes, no failure, no
[1:31:30] flaws.
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; And on top of that, it's not like he
[1:31:33] hide try to hide it. Listen, go listen
[1:31:34] to the tapes.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; He's not hiding anything. He's putting
[1:31:37] up front. But when you're veil into
[1:31:39] idolatry,
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; you're just well, he's saying that
[1:31:42] because he's humble. He was humble, but
[1:31:43] he was real.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:49] So he built that ephod golden
[1:31:53] brought brought earrings and requested
[1:31:55] 1,700 shekeets of gold and all that I
[1:31:57] need to go quick and he made an effort
[1:31:59] there for and put it in the city. So he
[1:32:01] put he put a memorial somewhere and
[1:32:03] guess what it turned into idolatry.
[1:32:08] They went titter and whoring after it
[1:32:09] which thing became a snare unto Gideon
[1:32:12] and to his house. So even though he
[1:32:13] blocked the idolatry about himself and
[1:32:15] his family and his sons, he built
[1:32:17] something and people went after him.
[1:32:19] Even Guide, the Bible says Guide fell
[1:32:21] into that snare.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; So you see when God raises something,
[1:32:27] idolatry wants to creep in. Paul was
[1:32:29] like that thing is creeping already.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; And this is the spirit of the antichrist
[1:32:34] which is what Nicolan spirit which
[1:32:37] conquered lady remove Christ out of your
[1:32:39] life.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; And it's so subtle. It can look so good.
[1:32:43] It can look so genuine. It can look so
[1:32:45] much of what God wanted,
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; but it's not.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Now, what I'm wondering, and I have to
[1:32:53] bring it to a close, but what I'm
[1:32:55] wondering is
[1:32:57] at one point into history, you can call
[1:32:59] this idolatry.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Talk about the snake. The first day is
[1:33:04] not idolatry.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Wow. So, at one point, how many how many
[1:33:09] how many years after that, like somebody
[1:33:11] gets up and is like,
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; I think we've been we're going a bit
[1:33:14] overboard with this
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; for sure. The first guy, the first man
[1:33:20] in church that raised up is like, I
[1:33:22] think we're pushing this a bit too far.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; That guy gets excommunicated.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; The first one who gets up, he's he's
[1:33:30] he's no good for nothing. He gets you.
[1:33:31] You don't believe it. My uncle was
[1:33:33] there. How dare you?
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; That's not what I'm saying. I'm not
[1:33:36] saying it's not true. It's it's totally
[1:33:38] true. That's the problem. It is so true
[1:33:40] and so great. You guys are missing the
[1:33:42] point.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; You're missing God.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; But how long take take Gideon Zod like
[1:33:50] how long does it takes for somebody to
[1:33:52] to to catch on that? It's been too far.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; It's going overboard. We're missing the
[1:33:58] greatest purpose.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:04] The first one who says it, he gets
[1:34:06] excommunicated.
[1:34:10] Even the temple, the temple was such a
[1:34:13] great thing
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; for for Israel. And obviously it is. It
[1:34:18] is a great thing. But you know what
[1:34:20] Jeremiah because he's a prophet, he
[1:34:22] picks on it one day because now people
[1:34:24] are putting their trust in the fact that
[1:34:26] they have a temple. Yeah.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; And then he says, "Thus say the Lord of
[1:34:32] God of ho, the Lord of hosts, the God of
[1:34:33] Israel, amend your ways and your doings,
[1:34:35] change your ways,
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; and I will cause you to dwell in this
[1:34:38] place. Trust ye not in lying words,
[1:34:42] saying, "The temple of the Lord, the
[1:34:44] temple of the Lord, the temple of the
[1:34:45] Lord." There's something about
[1:34:46] repetition sometime that makes people
[1:34:48] confident
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; and and and and the spirit of God picks
[1:34:52] it there.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Repeat it. Repeat it. Like those lying
[1:34:55] words, the temple of the Lord, the
[1:34:56] temple of the Lord, the temple of the
[1:34:57] Lord. You know, some religious people,
[1:34:59] they repeat it, repeat it, and the more
[1:35:01] they repeat it, they feel like they're
[1:35:03] in a trance and they feel like more
[1:35:04] confident. They get all excited. But
[1:35:06] these are lying words.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Cuz what Jeremiah says, "Amend your ways
[1:35:12] and your doings."
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; You've not got just you didn't give
[1:35:18] justice to the widow. You didn't do
[1:35:20] this. And even when Jesus come, the
[1:35:22] disciples are like, "Look Jesus, look at
[1:35:23] the temple.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; See what matters of stones and what
[1:35:26] buildings are here." So, so the one who
[1:35:28] spoke to Jeremiah, now he's standing in
[1:35:30] flesh. He's walking by the temple. The
[1:35:32] disciples are caught up into that same
[1:35:33] look at the temple. Look, look at the
[1:35:35] stone. Look at this. Look at that. Jesus
[1:35:37] is like, "You guys don't get it. That
[1:35:38] thing will be destroyed. We'll be
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; we'll be dust. There won't be even one
[1:35:41] stone laying on the other."
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; The temple is in front of you and you're
[1:35:46] missing it. They should have been about
[1:35:48] Jesus like, "Wow, wa, look at the
[1:35:50] temple. It's so amazing."
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; But they're talking to the temple, about
[1:35:55] a temple.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; How great was a day temple?
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; It's not like Jesus wants to crush their
[1:36:03] party. Like they're so excited and Jesus
[1:36:05] is like, "Yeah, you like this. I'm going
[1:36:07] to crush it." That's not the point.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; The point is not that. The point is like
[1:36:12] you're missing it. You have the that
[1:36:15] temple was talking about the temple
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; which you are by the way. You are the
[1:36:20] temple of the Holy Ghost. God wants to
[1:36:23] dwell inside of you.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; I got so many example but I got to I got
[1:36:35] to stop. But even the prophets Jesus
[1:36:38] Jesus said the same thing.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; They had so much trust in Moses.
[1:36:43] Yeah, that's right.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; He says, "How can he believe which
[1:36:47] receive honor one or the other and seek
[1:36:49] not the honor that cometh from God only?
[1:36:52] Do not think that I will accuse you to
[1:36:54] the father. There is one that accuseth
[1:36:56] you, even Moses, in whom ye trust."
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; For had ye believed Moses, ye would have
[1:37:06] believed me, for he wrote of me.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; It's exactly what happened in our age.
[1:37:11] The climax of that prophet was about
[1:37:14] Christ in us making us preach, making us
[1:37:17] sing, making us writing songs, making us
[1:37:20] witness on the street. You know Jesus,
[1:37:22] you know what? Jesus wanted to be where
[1:37:24] do you work? What shop do you work? What
[1:37:26] school do you go to? Do you want Do you
[1:37:28] know that Jesus want to go to that
[1:37:29] school?
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; That's why he sent you there.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; It's not about you. Once you give your
[1:37:34] life to the Lord and you become the
[1:37:36] temple of the Holy Ghost, do you know
[1:37:37] that where you've been sent to, you're
[1:37:39] not supposed you ended up there. You
[1:37:41] thought you were going there. Always
[1:37:43] think okay Lord if this didn't work and
[1:37:46] that's working out you are doing
[1:37:47] something.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; You are moving me around. You think you
[1:37:50] think your life is like flipping a coin
[1:37:52] and oh man
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; God want Jesus in flesh wants to be in
[1:38:00] that school and it's you. He wants to be
[1:38:02] at that coffee shop. He wants to be at
[1:38:04] that work plant. You thought you were
[1:38:06] about to be transferred, but you were
[1:38:08] not transferred because there's a soul
[1:38:10] there. And Jesus himself wanted to step
[1:38:13] in that department,
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; but you thought it was about you because
[1:38:17] you wanted to go there and you wanted to
[1:38:19] have that 50 cents raise,
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; but it's not about that. Once you give
[1:38:24] your life and you are the temple, when
[1:38:26] something doesn't happen the way you
[1:38:28] planned, you're like, Lord,
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; what are you doing?
[1:38:33] And that should become something that we
[1:38:35] are quick to react when something happen
[1:38:37] because we like to plan. You know why?
[1:38:39] Because we like safety. We like comfort.
[1:38:42] And it's okay. You can try it. But when
[1:38:44] God push you around and destroy your
[1:38:47] plans, you should say, "Lord,
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; you are working now."
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; That's why whatever plans we do, we say,
[1:38:54] "Lord willing." James says, "Lord
[1:38:57] willing." Why? Because we know that
[1:38:59] Jesus is inside that temple. And this is
[1:39:01] not a concrete block dead. It's a living
[1:39:04] thing. It's a living word. And he want
[1:39:06] to use us. He wants to move us because
[1:39:09] we are the sons and daughters of God.
[1:39:11] And we are led by the spirit of God.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; And it's all nice and cool to say in
[1:39:16] church, amen. But when God rules our
[1:39:19] plans because he wants to move us this
[1:39:21] way, why we have a sad face? We all
[1:39:24] disappointed. Why? Because we don't get
[1:39:27] it.
[1:39:31] coming on this trip. We were driving. I
[1:39:34] had my car. My daughter had Mary at her
[1:39:36] car cuz she's going to the winter youth.
[1:39:38] So, we were driving separately and then
[1:39:41] she stopped at the gas station and she
[1:39:42] thought that she had an oil leak and the
[1:39:44] the the she had a a mechanical failure.
[1:39:46] So, I I was ahead of her. So, I turned
[1:39:48] back and as I'm turning back, I says,
[1:39:50] "Okay, Lord,
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; what are you doing?"
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; And we can exercise oursel when our plan
[1:39:56] gets changed because we left really
[1:39:58] early. We were tired like we want to get
[1:40:00] there not too late and then all our
[1:40:02] plans look like it was falling apart
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; but I'm driving I says Lord what are you
[1:40:07] doing?
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; What this is it what is it about
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; because you're doing something
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; and it ended up being a false alert. We
[1:40:16] it was nothing big deal. We went and we
[1:40:18] drove. But just to give you an example
[1:40:20] when when when when something happened
[1:40:23] always like oh that devil or that old
[1:40:24] devil that old devil your life is the
[1:40:27] devil has no control over your life. You
[1:40:30] are a son and daughters of God. You're
[1:40:33] not a game that the devil is playing
[1:40:35] with. [applause and cheering]
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; But when we are so used to rely on
[1:40:40] systems and rely on other people when in
[1:40:43] our own life we get tricked into
[1:40:45] something changed we don't know where to
[1:40:47] look at. We're trying to find a quote.
[1:40:49] We're trying to find pastor. What are
[1:40:50] you thinking? It's good to consult these
[1:40:52] things. But God is like, "Why don't you
[1:40:54] ask me?
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; I'm the one who disrupted your plan, not
[1:41:00] the devil. I'm I'm in action right now
[1:41:03] in your life. Can you recognize me?"
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; Even Samuel, he was not used to God's
[1:41:09] voice. In the middle, God wokes him
[1:41:11] three times. And that every time he goes
[1:41:12] to the pastor because he's used to a
[1:41:14] system. If something move, you go see
[1:41:16] the pastor. And I got nothing against
[1:41:18] it. Sometime people don't consult
[1:41:20] enough.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; So I don't have that's not the the
[1:41:22] thing.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; But the the point is that God want also
[1:41:25] to speak to you.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; And at one point Eli even though he was
[1:41:28] a backsliden pastor, he he he caught it.
[1:41:31] He says this is God talking to you.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; This is God.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; What do I say? Well, tell him you're
[1:41:37] listening.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Tell him you got the line. 10 on 10. I
[1:41:42] got you.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Speak to me, Lord. Amen.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; The musicians can come.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; We got many example. Daniel stat
[1:41:54] Daniel's image that was built. The king
[1:41:56] built an image to the prophet. We got so
[1:41:59] many examples. But I think you get the
[1:42:01] point.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; But I wanted to give so many example for
[1:42:04] you to see. It's a it's a common thing.
[1:42:06] It creeps in
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; right away. You have a good moment with
[1:42:10] God. Right away the devil is like, "How
[1:42:11] can I trick this? I can I tr how can I
[1:42:14] trip the wire? How can I reverse the
[1:42:16] current?
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; How can I turn this positive into
[1:42:19] negative right away? As you are in the
[1:42:21] presence of God right away in his mind
[1:42:23] is how can I I need to shortcut this
[1:42:25] right away. As sons of God empowered by
[1:42:28] the spirit of God is so dangerous
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; that God the Satan wants to stop that
[1:42:33] and it's dead in its tracks.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is why I preach my
[1:42:37] heart out this morning for to reconnect
[1:42:40] a son and a daughter of God to say,
[1:42:41] "Lord,
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; I want to be connected to you."
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; That is the greatest
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; purpose.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; But Satan wants to bring us when the
[1:42:54] means become
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; the purpose.
[1:42:59] &gt;&gt; When the means, the se the brazen
[1:43:01] serpent was a mean. It was a way God the
[1:43:04] prophet is a way God is. It's the the
[1:43:06] mean. But the greatest what is the
[1:43:09] greatest
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; purpose?
[1:43:13] Let's bow our heads.
[1:43:18] Lord Jesus,
[1:43:23] we love you so much, Lord.
[1:43:26] And in our simple humanity, Lord, we
[1:43:28] have
[1:43:29] we are sometime naive.
[1:43:32] We get distracted.
[1:43:35] We get disrupted.
[1:43:38] Lord, your word has touch us, Lord,
[1:43:41] in a special way this morning.
[1:43:46] We feel your presence. You're in You
[1:43:49] want fellowship with your sons and
[1:43:51] daughters.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; You want our hearts to be turned to you.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Forgive us, Lord.
[1:44:01] Forgive us our distraction, Lord.
[1:44:04] Forgive us, Lord, of
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; putting things between
[1:44:10] you
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; and me.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; We want, Lord Jesus, to
[1:44:22] your presence and your person
[1:44:27] be inside of us.
[1:44:29] Once you're established, Lord, we want
[1:44:31] to be able to listen.
[1:44:33] to be led
[1:44:36] led out out of our own system,
[1:44:40] led outside of our own religion.
[1:44:43] Whatever we built, Lord, to
[1:44:46] make us feel comfortable,
[1:44:49] we all built system Lord.
[1:44:53] Lord, let's help us Lord to walk out of
[1:44:57] our own system.
[1:45:01] Give us Lord to be flexible,
[1:45:07] Lord. Am I a sheep that you can lead?
[1:45:12] You've led us to this day so far. You've
[1:45:15] led us in so many ways.
[1:45:19] But Lord, is there a greater potential
[1:45:21] inside of us that we are blocking
[1:45:25] because we're reaching out for safety?
[1:45:28] We're clinging on to other things. We're
[1:45:32] not letting go.
[1:45:34] We have thoughts. We have a mindset that
[1:45:37] are blocking us.
[1:45:39] A religious mindset, a way of thinking.
[1:45:42] Lord, come down this morning. And set us
[1:45:45] free from oursel.
[1:45:48] We all built religion. We do it every
[1:45:50] day. Lord, we want to be safe. We want
[1:45:52] to make sure
[1:45:55] we find our safety in your presence.
[1:45:59] and in your leading Lord
[1:46:01] in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:46:06] Open
[1:46:08] [singing] our eyes. Let's stand up.
[1:46:12] Lord,
[1:46:16] we want to see Jesus
[1:46:27] to reach out and touch
[1:46:32] him.
[1:46:34] Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:46:37] and say [music and singing]
[1:46:38] that we love
[1:46:42] him.
[1:46:47] [music] Open [singing]
[1:46:49] our ears,
[1:46:53] Lord,
[1:46:58] and help us [singing and music]
[1:47:00] to live.
[1:47:04] [music]
[1:47:09] Open
[1:47:10] our eyes,
[1:47:14] Lord. [music and singing]
[1:47:18] We want to [music and singing] see
[1:47:22] Jesus.
[1:47:25] Sing it again.
[1:47:27] [music]
[1:47:30] Open [singing] our eyes, [music]
[1:47:34] Lord.
[1:47:37] Come. Amen.
[1:47:40] Want to see
[1:47:45] [music]
[1:47:49] to reach out.
[1:47:52] touch
[1:47:55] him [music and singing]
[1:47:59] to say that we love
[1:48:04] [singing]
[1:48:05] him. [music]
[1:48:09] Oh [singing]
[1:48:13] [music]
[1:48:16] yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[1:48:21] Help us.
[1:48:24] [music] Help us to listen. [singing]
[1:48:31] Open [singing] our
[1:48:34] eyes,
[1:48:36] Lord. [music]
[1:48:40] We want [singing]
[1:48:42] to see.
[1:48:47] You are the center, [singing and music]
[1:48:51] the center of my life.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; You're the reason [singing]
[1:48:59] why
[1:49:03] I can live more [singing]
[1:49:05] abundantly.
[1:49:07] [music] Let there be nothing, let there
[1:49:09] be nothing, [singing]
[1:49:12] nothing [music] placed before you.
[1:49:17] So I can see you in plain
[1:49:19] [singing and music]
[1:49:20] view.
[1:49:24] I want to do everything
[1:49:27] through Christ.
[1:49:30] The center,
[1:49:33] the center [music and singing] of my
[1:49:36] life.
[1:49:37] You are the center.
[1:49:40] You are the center. Is that your prayer
[1:49:43] this morning?
[1:49:46] No distractions. No distractions.
[1:49:49] You're the reason [music]
[1:49:52] why [singing]
[1:49:55] I can [music] live more abundantly.
[1:50:00] Let there be [music and singing]
[1:50:02] nothing,
[1:50:04] nothing placed [music] before you
[1:50:09] so I can see [singing] you in plain
[1:50:12] view.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; I want to do everything through
[1:50:19] [singing] Christ.
[1:50:22] The center,
[1:50:25] center [music and singing] of my life.
[1:50:31] Seems I have a million things
[1:50:34] [music and singing] to do.
[1:50:37] Everything gets placed in front of you.
[1:50:41] But Lord, it's not my desire
[1:50:44] [music and singing]
[1:50:45] to see it go that way.
[1:50:50] Here's our prayer. And so I'll [music]
[1:50:53] rearrange my
[1:50:57] seeking for your will down on my knees,
[1:51:02] giving you. How many want to give him
[1:51:04] the first place? [music]
[1:51:06] Hallelujah.
[1:51:07] Knowing it's your strength I can't
[1:51:11] replace.
[1:51:12] You [music] are the center,
[1:51:16] the center [singing]
[1:51:17] of my life.
[1:51:22] You're the reason [music] why.
[1:51:27] Oh, I can live more [singing]
[1:51:30] abundantly.
[1:51:33] Let there be nothing
[1:51:37] nothing placed [music and singing]
[1:51:39] before you.
[1:51:41] I can see you in plain view
[1:51:49] [music]
[1:51:50] everything through Christ
[1:51:54] the [music] center
[1:51:58] of [singing] my life. [music]
[1:52:02] Thank you, brother. I just wanted to say
[1:52:05] how blessed we are to hear these words
[1:52:08] this morning [music] from the Lord. At
[1:52:11] the first of the year, I always pray and
[1:52:13] ask for God to give us the direction. Of
[1:52:16] course, I have to make decisions about
[1:52:19] meetings this year and who to bring in.
[1:52:21] There's a host, an army of ministers to
[1:52:23] bring that can bless us, and I just want
[1:52:26] to be led of the Lord. But I also look
[1:52:27] at that theme [music] that God is
[1:52:29] leading the church in. And the last few
[1:52:32] services, he's just setting a a tone if
[1:52:35] you're catching it. And I'm really
[1:52:36] excited about where the Lord's leading
[1:52:38] us. Uh, brother [music]
[1:52:40] Jeremy Shriner was here to use same
[1:52:43] example if all of you know if you're
[1:52:45] catching it about um uh [music] the the
[1:52:50] ark. Yeah, the ark. And he brings that
[1:52:52] in. And so I just appreciate
[1:52:56] the word. I appreciate the honesty. It
[1:52:59] it might make us feel just a little
[1:53:01] uncomfortable. Where's he going with
[1:53:02] this? But it's God challenging us
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; to make sure he's the center of our
[1:53:07] life,
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; not any man.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm beginning to wonder if in the
[1:53:14] Webster's dictionary,
[1:53:16] Steve Brassan's name is right next to
[1:53:18] honest
[1:53:20] because that's what I appreciate about
[1:53:22] him. No, it's not brother Steve. It's
[1:53:24] the Holy Spirit being honest,
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; almost raw with us [music] to make us
[1:53:29] look at something. And you see, we've
[1:53:31] heard these scriptures for many years.
[1:53:32] We've said, "Amen." We know what the
[1:53:34] mystery is. We've heard Christ in you,
[1:53:36] the hope of glory. How many reach? We've
[1:53:37] heard that. We know this is God's
[1:53:39] purpose, where he's headed. But I'm
[1:53:41] wondering if we've had enough time to
[1:53:43] really have the discernment to know how
[1:53:46] much Satan is trying to distract you
[1:53:49] from that goal.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; We can say, "Yes, it's Christ." and me,
[1:53:54] but maybe you're not getting fully to it
[1:53:56] because even in our own ranks, there are
[1:53:59] efforts of the enemy to distract us
[1:54:03] towards a man,
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; towards a pastor,
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; towards the false security that I'm in
[1:54:08] the message.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; I've been in the message for 30 years
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; to to lean on something. And whenever we
[1:54:15] lean on something, even if it's good, is
[1:54:18] it distracting us from that revelation
[1:54:21] of Christ in you, the hope of glory?
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; And I said to a minister a few weeks ago
[1:54:25] at lunch, I I said it to him this
[1:54:27] weekend, is that I don't know if we've
[1:54:29] done our homework to go through the
[1:54:32] message and to be able to pinpoint
[1:54:34] certain denominational characteristics
[1:54:37] that the prophet identified,
[1:54:39] nickelanism, all these other things. And
[1:54:41] we avoid h we don't we don't avoid him
[1:54:43] but we we don't have to read that
[1:54:44] because that doesn't apply to us right
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; oh no it's the same devil
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; and he wants to take this revelation
[1:54:52] this simple revelation and keep you
[1:54:55] [music]
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; from that and coming into that
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; but I like to say his Satan's days are
[1:55:01] numbered
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; and the word God has given and the
[1:55:04] people that's standing here in this hour
[1:55:07] are the people that will finish this
[1:55:09] revelation. Amen.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; They will be the people. She's going to
[1:55:14] come to it no matter what. But we have
[1:55:15] to have the discernment to say, "Lord,
[1:55:17] is there something distracting me? Even
[1:55:19] my false comfort blanket of of I'm a
[1:55:23] part of this group. I'm a part of this
[1:55:25] church and this is the ne next great
[1:55:27] teacher and you just go rah over this."
[1:55:30] Just be careful of that.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; God's wanting to all that to decrease
[1:55:35] [music] and himself to increase in our
[1:55:37] eyes.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; God's God's saying it more specific than
[1:55:44] he's ever said it. And he loves us
[1:55:46] enough to be honest and tell us the
[1:55:48] truth on these things. And I I want I
[1:55:50] would Would you raise your hand and
[1:55:52] agree? I want God's greatest purpose to
[1:55:54] be fulfilled in me. No other purpose, no
[1:55:57] other agenda from the enemy. No other
[1:55:59] distractions, nothing else. Just to have
[1:56:02] that [music] completely fulfilled in our
[1:56:04] lives. And that's why he sent the
[1:56:06] message of the last day. That's why he
[1:56:08] sends prophets to us. That's why he sent
[1:56:10] the five-fold ministry. But none of that
[1:56:12] is to be a replacement
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; for what he wants to do. You say, "Well,
[1:56:17] my wife won't come along or my children
[1:56:19] won't come along or I got this. Let's
[1:56:21] let's not make any excuses.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; I I probably if you go there and really
[1:56:26] say, Lord, I'm going to manifest this
[1:56:27] purpose in my life. I'm not waiting for
[1:56:29] family members to come with me." Yeah,
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; probably if you go there, they'll get a
[1:56:35] hunger for it themselves cuz they see
[1:56:37] you've changed. They see you coming into
[1:56:40] something that you've never come into
[1:56:42] before.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I love the word. Thank
[1:56:45] you, brother Steve. You're your family
[1:56:47] here. You're at home here. And he just
[1:56:49] [music] um you know, when I say I talked
[1:56:51] to that minister about we need need to
[1:56:52] do our homework to to discern these
[1:56:56] denominational things and distractions.
[1:56:58] you did your homework
[1:57:00] and you brought it out just well today.
[1:57:02] God bless you. Praise the Lord. We
[1:57:04] appreciate it. Amen. Just [music] two or
[1:57:06] three things I want to mention to you
[1:57:08] that are very important to me before we
[1:57:09] leave today. Um
[1:57:12] I know I I um I was blessed with the
[1:57:16] Christmas present of another grandson.
[1:57:18] And I always hesitate announcing because
[1:57:20] it's almost like every service I'm
[1:57:21] announcing a dedication or another
[1:57:24] grandson or granddaughter. But we're
[1:57:26] glad to welcome Solomon Emanuel Jr. to
[1:57:29] the service this morning and healthy and
[1:57:31] I'd surprised to see them here in
[1:57:33] church, but they're here and uh we're
[1:57:35] proud of them and we God bless you
[1:57:36] Solomon and Lily. We're very happy to
[1:57:39] welcome uh that little boy into our
[1:57:41] lives. Praise the Lord. I would like to
[1:57:44] call upon the church to pray this week.
[1:57:46] Tomorrow starts a uh a meeting we've
[1:57:48] done been doing for almost 40 years.
[1:57:50] It's 17 and up singles from all over the
[1:57:53] country, sometimes different countries,
[1:57:55] and they come from everywhere. It's a
[1:57:57] and they come because it's a special
[1:57:59] time of special teaching, special
[1:58:01] preaching, and also they're a special
[1:58:03] group of young people. Uh it's just
[1:58:05] incredible just what comes together. And
[1:58:08] so, we'll have that again here in Grass
[1:58:09] Lake the next three or four days. I'm
[1:58:12] asking the congregation, there's going
[1:58:13] to be about 170 young people. Would you
[1:58:15] all uh raise your hand, agree to take it
[1:58:18] to prayer over the next three days that
[1:58:20] these lives would be touched and changed
[1:58:22] and you can really help me in that
[1:58:24] because your prayers can really make the
[1:58:26] meeting go the direction and a better
[1:58:28] direction so that it will help the young
[1:58:30] people that are coming. It's a
[1:58:31] tremendous time and a beautiful
[1:58:33] gathering of the people. So we we would
[1:58:36] appreciate you taking each of their
[1:58:37] lives and praying for them as they're
[1:58:39] there. They as I said they they set
[1:58:41] aside their time and their money. Let's
[1:58:43] also pray for this storm that it
[1:58:44] wouldn't be as much damage to keep.
[1:58:46] There'll be a lot of flights coming into
[1:58:48] Detroit and we don't want that to be a
[1:58:50] huge hindrance. So, pray for the storm
[1:58:51] that God will move it. Send it further
[1:58:54] north or something so that we can get
[1:58:55] those flights in tomorrow uh
[1:58:59] not send it your way to Quebec, but but
[1:59:02] uh somewhere other than uh here for sure
[1:59:05] because we we need to get those young
[1:59:06] people in. And there's pray for the
[1:59:08] staff too. There's a a lot of
[1:59:10] responsibilities, a lot of things that
[1:59:11] have to be done here in the next few
[1:59:13] hours even to prepare for tomorrow for
[1:59:15] all these coming into Grass Lake. So, if
[1:59:17] you would take them to prayer, we'd
[1:59:19] certainly appreciate that. Amen. We love
[1:59:21] the Lord. We appreciate him this
[1:59:23] morning. And uh don't leave here. If you
[1:59:25] have a need, just come up afterwards for
[1:59:27] prayer. I know brother Michael wants to
[1:59:29] pray together with the brothers here of
[1:59:31] a need. If you have something, brother
[1:59:33] Bart, why don't you come and we'll just
[1:59:34] lay hands on you before this. Is it your
[1:59:36] your name was a surgery? I heard Mark,
[1:59:38] but then I thought, "No, it's Bart
[1:59:39] having that." Would you mind coming
[1:59:41] forward and we'll pray for you for that
[1:59:42] surgery coming up this week? And anyone
[1:59:45] else who would need prayer, but we'll
[1:59:46] just close in prayer and dismiss you.
[1:59:48] God bless you. And we won't be here this
[1:59:50] Wednesday because of the retreat, but we
[1:59:51] will be here next Sunday starting Sunday
[1:59:53] school at 10:30 and the regular service
[1:59:55] as well. Let's be in prayer for the new
[1:59:56] year. Let's be in prayer for where God
[1:59:58] wants to lead us. We're hearing those
[2:00:00] little revelations. I always call it New
[2:00:02] Year's revelations. We don't need New
[2:00:04] Year's resolutions. They don't last. But
[2:00:07] how many want New Year's revelations?
[2:00:09] Lord, which direction? What do you want
[2:00:10] me to do? And as our brother said, what
[2:00:12] do you want me to do for your kingdom?
[2:00:14] Something happened to me, but Lord, why
[2:00:16] did it happen? Are you going to use me
[2:00:18] somehow for your kingdom? [music]
[2:00:19] Let us be open. Let's not be
[2:00:20] complainers. Let's not be negative.
[2:00:23] Let's not complain about our problems.
[2:00:25] Let's just give Satan a black eye this
[2:00:27] year. Stop complaining. Say, Lord, all
[2:00:30] things work together for the good to
[2:00:31] them that love God and that are called
[2:00:33] according to the purpose. Let's be a
[2:00:35] positive people and uh I'll just spring
[2:00:38] off some of these brothers what they've
[2:00:39] been preaching and preach some things in
[2:00:41] the new year here that I think will be a
[2:00:42] blessing. We'll [music] set some order
[2:00:43] also for next Sunday for the new year as
[2:00:46] well. So, we're looking forward to that.
[2:00:48] We usually have a watch night service at
[2:00:50] the uh at the camp. So, we're not able
[2:00:52] to have one here, but we encourage you
[2:00:54] to pray. I'm sure there'll be some
[2:00:55] online that you can listen in on, but we
[2:00:58] encourage you to gather your family
[2:00:59] together and pray the new year in if
[2:01:01] they're if the kids are still awake
[2:01:03] anyway. pray the new year in and uh
[2:01:05] we're looking forward to God's
[2:01:06] blessings. Heavenly Father, thank you
[2:01:08] for the word that's just dropped [music]
[2:01:10] so rich to us this morning. It's above
[2:01:12] and beyond what we can explain. We thank
[2:01:15] you, Lord, for your servant, Lord. When
[2:01:17] he said he preached his heart out, he
[2:01:18] definitely preach his heart to [music]
[2:01:19] us this morning. And we're thankful for
[2:01:21] him. Bless him and his family. Be with
[2:01:23] them, Lord, on their journey home. Move
[2:01:25] this storm, Lord, [music] in the name of
[2:01:27] Jesus Christ. Just pave the way, Lord,
[2:01:29] for the retreaters that are coming in.
[2:01:31] pave the way for brother uh [music]
[2:01:33] Steve and his family to get home. And we
[2:01:36] just pray you'll protect us, watch over
[2:01:37] us. We take each of those 175, [music]
[2:01:40] 180 lives uh young people coming from
[2:01:44] all different directions, Lord, to
[2:01:45] [music] just be able to come in this
[2:01:47] atmosphere and be able to learn of you.
[2:01:50] Lord, we [music] have the opportunity,
[2:01:52] you have the the place in our lives and
[2:01:54] in this retreat to be able to set the
[2:01:55] direction for just [music] hundreds of
[2:01:57] young people and families for the
[2:01:59] future. I pray that you'll do it, Lord.
[2:02:01] I pray you'll anoint the ministers,
[2:02:02] brother Rap, Brother Trevor, Lord, and
[2:02:06] anoint it, Father, that the things can
[2:02:07] be said that would plant the seeds,
[2:02:10] Lord, for wonderful things, Christ being
[2:02:13] revealed [music]
[2:02:14] in those young people in their lives,
[2:02:16] Christ in us, the hope of glory. Thank
[2:02:18] you, Lord, for this service. [music] May
[2:02:20] the fellowship be sweet today as we
[2:02:22] commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Take me [music] deeper.
[2:02:27] Let's sing that as we go. No, I want to
[2:02:29] sing the second verse of that one. Go
[2:02:30] back to this one here. Second verse. God
[2:02:32] bless you each one. If you needed
[2:02:34] prayer, just come forward. Gideon, you
[2:02:36] go ahead. And whenever I begin
[2:02:39] [singing and music]
[2:02:41] with prayer,
[2:02:43] you have never failed to
[2:02:44] [singing and music] meet me there.
[2:02:47] And all the other things of
[2:02:50] [music and singing] life just seem to
[2:02:52] work out right.
[2:02:57] My eyes are fixed on you and you
[2:03:01] [singing] alone. [music]
[2:03:03] Lord, please come and rule upon this
[2:03:06] throne.
[2:03:08] So that in this life [music and singing]
[2:03:10] of mine,
[2:03:13] I can feel your presence [music]
[2:03:15] all the time.
[2:03:18] You are [singing] the center,
[2:03:21] the center of my life.
[2:03:27] You're the reason [singing]
[2:03:29] why
[2:03:33] [music] I [singing] can live more
[2:03:35] abundantly.
[2:03:38] Let there be nothing,
[2:03:41] [music]
[2:03:42] nothing [singing] placed before you
[2:03:46] so I [music] can see you [singing] in
[2:03:49] plain view.
[2:03:53] [music] I want to [singing] do
[2:03:54] everything
[2:03:56] through Christ.
[2:03:59] The center, [singing]
[2:04:02] the center [music]
[2:04:03] of my life. [singing] You are the
[2:04:07] center.
[2:04:08] You are [music] the center,
[2:04:12] the center of [singing] my life.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; You're the reason why
[2:04:23] I can live [music and singing] more
[2:04:26] abundantly.
[2:04:28] Let there be nothing,
[2:04:32] nothing [music] placed [singing] before
[2:04:35] you
[2:04:36] so I can see you and claim you.
[2:04:40] [singing]
[2:04:43] I want to do everything
[2:04:46] through Christ,
