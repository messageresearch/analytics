========================================
Kings if we go back in the Old Testament and I just want to continue our subject from last Sunday a little bit and we were preaching on enough oil to finish the journey enough oil to finish the journey this would be part two of that this morning Second Kings and because so many families are down at the camp I'm going to need extra amens this morning from all of those that are here in order to preach amen remember amen means succumb to the devil II Kings chapter four is where we want to read second Kings chapter four amen do you love the word of God amen and then I'm going to read before I forget I'm going to read this text and then we had an urgent prayer request from our brother Matthew Paulson just came in just a little while ago to a text and we want to remember him in prayer forgot to get it into the prayer requests so I'll read that and they're probably listening in this morning from South Carolina so we just want to read that I'm going to go ahead and read that before I read the text Brother Paulson says please remember our daughter Jessica in your prayers this morning she has been suffering from chronic lyme chronic lyme disease Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Bartonella she is having left side weakness slurred speech excruciating pain in her neck and head she said it feels like knives they also found more lesions in her brain she has been to ER two times within a week they have ran tests giving her medicine and nothing has helped she has seen several Specialists and is scheduled to see a neurologist tomorrow morning we know God can completely heal her please pray for us thank you brother sister Paulson they they listen in here from South Carolina and brother Paulson will definitely take Jessica to prayer this morning while we're opening the service and we pray God's healing for her we don't know why these things are happening but we pray it's so that God's glory can be revealed amen and I don't know if brother they mentioned sister Elizabeth's testimony but there was a positive report from Sister Elizabeth Murphy this morning that her uh the the in her bone marrow it's shrinking the cancer is shrinking a bit she's got a really good report this last week before she headed to Florida so they're very excited they're going to keep believing and holding up the word of God for her cancer we do not fear cancer here we do not fear any disease Lyme disease whatever it is there's nothing too big for our Lord so we stand by the banner of the blood of Jesus Christ for all these needs amen let's let's just read this morning second Kings chapter four now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the Creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be Bond men so it was very rough times down the road from when Elijah pronounced judgment on the whole generation the whole nation and so there this this godly woman is living under the Shadow and the gloominess and the debt and all that's happening and now they want to take her sons take her family under the debt creditors are coming she appeals to Elisha not Elijah Elisha and Elisha said unto her what shall I do for thee tell me what hast thou and thy house and she said thy handmaid hath not anything in the house save a pot of oil I don't have anything but a little pot of oil and then he said go borrow the vessels abroad of all thy neighbors even empty vessels borrow not a few and without when thou art come in Thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy Sons and shall pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full so this is not a public show the third poll is not a public show shut yourself in your house with your sons and start pouring that oil into these vessels she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed glory be to God and the oil stayed and then she came and told the man of God and he said go sell the oil pay thy debt and live thou and thy Children of the rest praise be to God Heavenly Father we pray you'll bless and anoint the word this morning every soul that's listening today is important to you every life wherever they may be is important to your economy and Lord God I pray that you would anoint us today to get out of the way and your anointing would come through and the word would come through and Lord that you would break every stronghold of the enemy Lord that you would break down barriers today Lord we have this urgent request father from our brother Polson for Jessica we're going to as a congregation lift her up Lord into your presence this morning under your care the great physician now is here the sympathizing Jesus Lord I pray that you would honor a father's faith and our faith this morning and Jessica's faith we don't know what's going on but I pray father you'd get to the bottom of it Lord and that you would heal her that you would restore her that you take away not only the symptoms but the cause of this we curse it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you bring glory to yourself Lord and we commit it now to you leaving it in your hands completely we pray you'll bless the service bless the service down at the camp today bless all those are gathering Lord May our young people be filled with the Holy Ghost May our young people be filled with the Holy Ghost Lord not some type of emotion but Lord the real genuine filling of the Holy Ghost I pray and then Lord if someone gets emotional Lord we're thankful for that too we praise God because we know Lord when there's a change in a life then we know Lord we're bound to get emotional we're cry we'll express ourselves to you we'll Worship You Lord because we know that you're doing something in our lives we pray you'll bless the word and bless our time together today every visitor that's here we just place in your hands in Jesus name we ask it amen amen God bless you once you shake your hands again with your neighbor there before you're seated and God bless you each one now we just want to uh continue on with our subject here this morning and uh last time we last time we talked about this we read in Matthew 25 the mystery under the seventh seal which the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord so in Matthew 25 we have three Parables that are related to the seventh seal or the coming of the Lord and that Parable spoke about the first Parable spoke about was about the oil that was essential to finish the journey it's about five wise virgins five foolish virgins and the only difference in the two there wasn't hardly there wasn't hardly any difference in those two groups Gathering they were virgins they were Sanctified they loved the Lord they took the journey and the message to go meet the bridegroom they were all in the same group but the only difference is one had oil in their laps the other didn't have oil in their laps and so we were speaking about this oil that is needed at the end time the last thing that they needed for the last leg of the journey was oil the only thing the main thing and so if that's a theme right now in the last days for our lives then we should be saying Lord there's one thing most important in me in my family's life do we have the oil and do we have enough of the Holy Spirit to finish the journey that's that should be dominating our minds more than any business adventure more than any family problem more than any sickness Lord do I have the oil and he made it the most prominent thing in the parable of the seventh seal and the coming of the Lord and so it became essential uh what I'm basically preaching is essential oil this is this the real essential oil that I'm preaching about and so now the foolish virgins they discovered that they didn't have it the last minute they discovered they had everything and they loved the Lord and they had all this but they discovered they didn't have the oil they came in the message to pursue the bridegroom they heard the midnight cry because when it says midnight how many know what it says midnight that's at the darkest time so it was at the darkest hour when the world had become dark when it had become full of perversion in everything that it was at that time the Midnight Cry the final cry went out rise up it's time to meet the bridegroom and take the last the last step of the journey to meet the bridegroom and so they were virgins they were Sanctified they they rejoiced in all this cry they they actually woke up to the cry it wasn't just the wise virgins that woke up they woke up too they all woke up I heard the cry I heard the Midnight Cry and they all were trimmed their lamps all were the same as far as tripping they were pure good people the prophet mentions they were pure good people Sanctified vessels of God but lacking the oil to take the final leg of the journey and that's pretty serious I can't preach it any more serious than what the parable gives it it's for our time it's for right now and so now if that's the essential thing there shouldn't be any other more essential thing in our lives except Lord every teenager ought to be saying I can't get in on my parents coattail every teenager should be going to God and say that's what the parable said my God warned me that the only thing lacking was the oil I better make sure God I'm seeking the Holy Ghost for myself if my dad don't have it my mom don't have it it doesn't matter I've got to seek this for myself it's more important than anything in life how many would say Amen to that if Jesus said it was important and that's the parable we're living in right now and you're interested in the coming of the Lord and you're interested in meeting the bridegroom if you're interested in that then you have to have the oil you have to have the Holy Spirit you have to know that you have the Holy Spirit in your life not just that you love God but there's an identification of the depth of your soul that I believe this word of this hour and I'm following it as best I can with all of my heart my goodness so important I want to remind just now some things of the final summary I gave of Matthew 25 last Sunday and then we'll go into to some things today it is foolish here's my summary of Matthew 25. it's foolish to pursue Christ the bridegroom without the oil first that's actually what they did they began the journey without the oil discovered they didn't have it you have nothing but trouble along the way if you try to pursue the bridegroom without the oil be nothing but trouble so like I said last Sunday I just want to encourage you I want to challenge you rebuke you whatever the Lord would use me to do to say you have to take this before God yourself but I won't sit by and just Pat people on the shoulder and say you're okay you're okay when I don't want to deceive Anybody Everybody personally on their own level needs to go to God and say Lord do I have this if I'm lacking it if I do have it I need more of it can I get an amen and maybe in the next few weeks I'll talk about what the Holy Ghost is what it is not so we have a greater understanding because the Holy Ghost is one of the most debated confused subjects Even in our own ranks it's so confused sometimes and I can tell you God did not do that God is not the author of confusion God has told us straight in the word and straight in the message so there'll be no confusion it's the devil that takes young hearts and old hearts and confuses them about the very thing that they need the essential oil and Satan confuses people about it and so maybe we'll go into that we'll see how the Lord leads but today I want to remind you number one it is foolish to pursue Christ the bridegroom without the oil first it's gambling with your life to think that trimming your lap every now and then is enough isn't that what the parable says they were trimming their lap I'm going to church I'm being in the message I'm in a message church and it is is gambling with your life to think that trimming my lap every now and then in church or being stirred to wake up by the Midnight Cry is enough it was not enough it is not enough to depend on others it's not enough today to only open your Bible just at church it's not enough to overcome this Midnight Hour of Darkness with just being a good boy it's more than being a good boy it's more than being a good girl it's not enough to wear the right clothes it's not enough just to attend a message Church you have to have the whole true Holy Spirit the oil in your life excuse me for being so straight but you can't get any more straight than what the parable preaches to you some were lacking oil and they discovered it and they said oh can and then they tried to depend on and take from oil from the other ones and they said wait a minute wait a minute and I feel like I have to say that to people sometimes because people can be so needy and they're claiming something what's their what they're cleaning to clinging to sometimes is their own lack of the Holy Ghost themselves and they see the strength in you but you see now I'm saying I I've got enough just for myself to finish the journey that's what they said the wiser we only have enough for ourselves to finish this journey go to them that buy and sell go get it yourself come through the same thing do the same thing it's sell out to yourself to get what's needed and I want to say this lastly about Matthew 25 it's about having what's needed to finish this journey it's not that you started this journey in the message it's about how you end can I get any help this morning it's not that you start praise the Lord that you started praise the Lord that you believe praise the Lord that you set on a journey to see the bridegroom praise the Lord you started but for my all the Bible things Bible scriptures that I read and I'm going to read some to you this morning it's not about just that you started it's how you end it's how the the journey ends can you say amen and how tragic it would be that you started the journey but now you're kind of doubting and you're kind of phasing out no no this is not the time to phase out this is not the time to stop praying it's the time to pray more this is not the time to become more worldly and Dabble and more worldly things it's the time to become more sanctified wouldn't you say Amen the last hour the last leg of the trip the last run of the race it's not the time to be Dilly dallying around it's time to run with all of our hearts it's trying to go forward can you say Amen it's not the time to get Lexa days ago it's not the time to get loose it's not the time to look for things you can get by with is that the time I think of Jesus when he was in the garden his last hours there it got so dark and his disciples he took him in to pray they fell asleep in the garden they all fell asleep because why did they fall asleep they didn't recognize the hour that they were in this is it this is a wrap up and it's not a time to sleep it's time to pray Brothers I need your prayers but they couldn't do it because they didn't recognize the hour anybody who recognizes this hour right now the final seconds we're not three minutes before midnight we're just a few seconds before midnight and anybody who catches that Revelation is not praying less they're praying more they're not they're not they're not pulling away and getting more bitter they're saying Lord Heal My bitterness take me closer to you anybody who recognizes where we're at right now there's going to be changes in their life the oil is the most essential thing and I want to live and I want to be filled with it and so you know that's the thing is the is the final stage of the journey the final leg this is not a time to be dabbling and playing around and playing church it's not the time for it and when Jesus was in that Garden that's what I was finishing Jesus was sitting there he come and woke him up he said go ahead and take your rest now but he said this hour the Bible says that Jesus he prayed he come and found the sleeping he prayed again and the Bible says he prayed more earnestly than he'd ever prayed in Jesus Final hours it was not this attitude this is all wrapped up anyway it's just about over I'm predestinated to do this oh how many predestinated people that think they're so predestinated and we heard it Wednesday night from Brother rap I love to say Amen to the truths of predestination I believe God knew me before the foundation of the world but that doesn't justify laziness that actually should build Faith to say I'm one of them and I'm going to finish this journey well I'm going to finish this journey filled with the Holy Ghost it's not the things that I'm predestined Jesus said well this whole thing's predestinated anyway I'm supposed to go to the crossing and so he just lays back and he said you know what you guys are sleeping make some room for me I'm going to lay down and take a nap too the Bible says he prayed more interesting he didn't pray less he prayed more he entered in more anybody hearing what I'm saying this morning and so in the darkest hour the final leg of the journey that's not the time to play around can you say amen that's not the time to be doing something less that's not the time to be moving along in the social media with the direction that the defectors are going and the people who left the message and keep in your eye man look what they're getting to do now look at oh look what they get to wear now this is not the time to be looking at them if they keep going they're fitted for Destruction are you called to that no you're not called to that it's not a time to loosen up and say God I need more of you somebody say Amen this it's not a time to be just just say oh they say we're here we're going to finish it up let's finish well let's finish the last leg well let's run with patience or race success before us it's about finishing well it's not that you had enough to start it's about you had enough oil to start it's about you have enough to end it's about finishing it's not that you started I'll come back to that in just a minute with all the scriptures that talked about talk about God's interested how we finish not just that we start with the Lord we find here in the text of Second Kings chapter four that it is it's another witness in the Old Testament of the last days essential thing because anytime you read scriptures about Elijah or Elisha you're talking about our day because how many would say in Malachi 4 it says he'll send Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and I we believe he has sent that that Ministry is done it's over he's fulfilled that scripture Malachi fulfill if you're listening on the broadcast or any other way come and talk to me because there's been a lot of Prophecy fulfilled that people don't know it's been fulfilled it's been fulfilled already and we're living in the time of that right now and so now because we're in the days of when Elijah was fulfilled when we go in the Old Testament and read about Elijah and Elisha we're right in our time the types and shadows apply to us and we can say I'm living right here well in this chapter it's not Elijah because he went up in a chariot and he passed the ministry on to Elijah because Elijah asked for it he said I'm praying what's your prayer what do you want of all things how do you write what do you want above all things she's poor she could have asked for anything all the money in the world and God would have given it to her sister how do you write in that example but she said of all things I want the salvation of my two sons and she got it can you say Amen she got it got it and so when we come to Elisha he says to Elijah what do you want Elijah says what do you want Elijah says that a double portion of your spirit would fall on me Hallelujah oh my what a request that's what you asked for that's what I'm going to give you you know you have to ask for things God doesn't just hand it to you so when he comes about you ask whatever you come to Hattie wrightboy you you better think that through and from the depths of the soul the Lord knew what she was going to ask for something came ask for the right thing Elisha said you know what I want a double portion of the spirit so now Elijah goes off the scene and Elisha she bride it's not the masculine part it's the feminine part now everything we read about Elisha now is typing I wanted to say first of all there's so many types in this that I don't have enough time today to preach on all the types another thing is I like to keep my jacket on so I look proper and good but it's too hot today so I'm taking my jacket off which means that I'll probably preach even harder Hallelujah so now uh and by the way I just wanted to mention that if you ever notice now when I go over like this my tie stays straight it doesn't fall down there's a reason for that and she doesn't want me to embarrass her but sister strew sitting in the back to embarrass her even more sister's true and my wife and probably many other women get frustrated when preachers ties go all out of sorts they're going everywhere and so sister's true she thought on this for probably 20 years I imagine and she said I've got to develop something for this problem in Preachers so I'm going to reveal the secret over National Television sisters Drew sewed together something here that you put your tie and it comes under the buttons it's an amazing invention I asked if she had the copyright on it yet I'll do it and I'll make the royalties off of it it holds the tie in while preachers are jumping all over it's um it's an amazing it invention it's incredible such talented people in this church she has a lot of other talents besides that but this is a good one and and you know just quickly somebody laid a bunch of neckties out on the table to give away to everybody last Sunday that's just a bunch of neckties I want to say thank you for that appreciate that somebody paid their tithes and they didn't do it secretly they laid it out on the table so God bless you for that and here you Brothers need tithes you can have some of my ties there's so many types about Elijah and Elisha concerning this day I don't have time but I want to bring out one first of all and that is Elisha and Elijah both had meetings with widows with women and they were widows and they were living in a dark time both of them and they had a need during the dark time that's a type of the Bride because we live in the darkest times we live in a time of debt spiritually can you say Amen we're in in debt the world's in debt spiritually we're in a time that they want to take our children how many raise your hand they want to take our children so all these scenarios are here and both these women had some Elijah came to one Elisha came to another one and it's interesting how they dealt with them they let they lived in famine they lived in debt they lived in depressing times they lived in a time of loss they were barely getting by but then the scripture says in chapter four I read you but in the middle of that there cried a woman under those conditions a woman cried now wasn't there other people crying during that time wasn't there other women crying I'd say there was I'd say because of the depressing times and the debt and all the the depression there was probably other women that had tears and and that's fine God knows about that too but yet God this this one these women got God's attention their cry got God's attention and so now that's a wonderful thing to recognize that they both went to Widow women and that was to their that was their mystery because Elijah he had a dispensational Ministry he spoke to the whole nation he brought a curse on Jezebel he brought a curse on Ahab and the whole house which was a Jehovah Jireh believing King he was the king of Israel but he married the wrong woman and so now Elijah came to put a curse on all that thing and he stopped up the Heavens there was no rain there was famine in the land all the conditions a lot of the oh boy let me say it a lot of the conditions we're in right now is because Elijah came in this hour and he spoke the word and our nation and our world rejected Elijah and that's why we're in the conditions that we're in so remember that can you say Amen it's because Elijah has come that we live in these conditions but the bride has to live in it until the Rapture time the bride's living in these conditions and so there was others crying but this one got their attention and they went to these women so now I want you to notice something else there was a change in leadership from it was the same message but it was a bit of change in leadership from Elijah to Elijah because we know that Elijah had a double portion of the spirit of the Prophet but the change in the manner the pro the prophet said Elijah was bold Elijah called fire down from heaven he spoke to the entire dispensation Elijah he rebuked the whole generation his indictment was to the whole religious system he spoke boldly to Jezebel but Elisha Elisha he didn't do all that he didn't speak judgment to the whole uh generation and dispensation he didn't have to Elijah had already done it it's not to the whole generation but Elijah's Ministry was more to the personal effect it wasn't to the nation it was more to the person it was to Naaman it was to this widow woman it was dealing personally and anytime he got involved with preachers it didn't go so well remember when he first was first finished there they were looking for Elijah they said we're gonna we're gonna go find Elijah would you come with us he said you know Elijah's gone on The Chariot they're trying to bring Elijah back they're trying to act like Elijah's still here they're trying to say brother Brown's going to speak for us tonight and I'm going he is he's not here he did his ministry he's gone under his reward and you're saying to the young people brother Branham will be our speaker tonight there's something not right about that now I believe in the voice I believe he brought us back to the word I believe and listen to the voice but to say he's here he's not here he's gone unto his reward and there's a change in administration from the hymn to the she from Elijah to Elisha and I'm telling you Elijah spoke to the whole He indicted the entire religious system not the people but he indicted the entire religious system for crucifying the Son of God afresh again but Elisha when he came he didn't do that it was more of a personal level to meet the god meaning the personal needs personal Revival not a national Revival a personal healing to individuals a personal restoration to individuals not judgment now I want to say to you that God is still a god of judgment and God may put us back in line when we're out of line but for the most part we're not here now to pronounce judgment like Elijah did anytime a pastor or Minister today tries to be the prophet and pronounce judgment on everything he's out of his office Elijah's already done that anytime a pastor tries to take it into his own hands to pronounce judgment especially individually to somebody he can give discernment he can give counsel but when he takes it his hand pronounced judgment over the whole thing he's taken the office of a prophet and you're not a prophet you're a pastor that's why you hurt people can I get an amen from somebody stay in your office they listen so much to the prophet that they think okay this is the way I'm going to do it with my own congregation not always you're not a prophet you're a pastor the manner has changed the leadership has changed don't try to be a prophet to the people God's already a sinner Prophet but try to be a pastor to the people and let me just say this we need more truly God called Pastors in this message we don't need somebody to try to be a prophet to us we didn't we don't need this great teacher to expound upon and bring us all the answers we need teachers but not one with all the answers can you say man God's pointing us back to the word he's given us a message that's the only message we have to preach and now we be in our calling to minister to the people as God given us thank God he called me to be a pastor 35 years ago I don't know why he did I still ask the Lord why have you done this why did you choose me to do this but I can't get away from it it's my burden it's my calling and I'm going to keep doing it until the rapture Elijah pronounced Judgment of the whole system Jezebel he wasn't afraid of jezel he was Bo just telling it like it is and but but Elisha his manner was more to the personal thing and I just want to say once again about judgment the bride is the true bride is no longer under the judgments of God she has the Holy Ghost she's past judgment so why do you keep bringing judgment on the bride she's past judgment praise the Lord you say what about when Elisha called two she Bears Out of the Woods because he got offended at his complex about his bald head oh I got another sermon one of the things preachers needs to do two or three things preachers have to grow out of personally in their walk with God they've got to grow out of their complexes because sometimes they preach their complexes and not the word of God in that day if you think that he was that's the day that Elisha was acting like Elijah a little bit because he's going to call the sea Bears out and kill those kids and brother Brown said he that was not the holy spirit that was him acting in his own way but it looked like Elijah he's getting out of Step his ministry wasn't Elijah to pronounce judgment like that it was Elisha and so he acted out of place he made a mistake did I say that on National he made a mistake and he preached his own complex should we go through the Bible and talk about Moses the great prophet who made a mistake and one day struck the rock twice because of his frustration with the people and his temper got up to the people so bad he was supposed to strike at once and struck it twice made a mistake God said the Earth temper that thing you're not even going in the Promised Land it's in your Bible everybody hold your Bible it's it's in there God's true Prophet definitely but he made a mistake there he got in the flesh and so Elisha that's the one time I don't know why I'm elaborating on this it's not in my notes but I like to say that he called them out he shouldn't have done that because once again it's this whole thing is that the administration or the leadership had changed under Elijah even though the spirit was the double portion the administration of it changed a bit because it was not to speak to the nation there was not to be a national Revival that was that day he called fire down and then Israel they all they come around that he did Elijah was to do that can you say man around the country almost in every major city in this nation Elijah spoke now Elisha he ministers and he ministers personally it's not a national Revival and so now one of the things that Elisha does clearly is when someone has a need he always asks for them to do something first before he meets the need now Elijah had the power if somebody was out of money or somebody Elijah he'd just say okay it's yours that's it it's yours but somehow with Elias Elisha he's asking for them to do something and then they get their miracle Naaman was struck with Leprosy and he comes sinned he didn't even go himself he said you you go and tell Naaman he needs to dip seven times in the dirtiest River in all of Israel Jordan he needs to go dip seven times and then he'll receive my healing now this is a great man and he's and he doesn't even come himself my dad used to say that the servant knocked on the door and Naaman came to the door and it servant he said I asked for Elisha to come he said Elijah said he's not coming he just sent me his servant well I want to see the man I want to see the pastor himself good thing he didn't have that attitude but he says um he said if you go down and dip seven times in Jordan you'll be healed just at that moment is a test of your faith but it's God asking you to do something dirty not dirty in the sense of sinful but doing something that's not convenient not easy sometimes for some people they can't even come to the altar there's been people coming to this church I've never seen them at the altar I've never seen him repented except for healing for their body they never come to repent they don't have to repent now you don't have to come to the altar but sometimes God asks us to do something not to embarrass us but to show that we're real and we're going to be honest I need to repent not enough repentance last Sunday we're so glad to see a few in the altar repenting because God had made a call last Sunday for repentance I rejoice in those who came but I'll tell you I'm I'm praying for a lot but whether it's in your seat or here it's a call to repentance in this hour what's being preached it's a call for your life to repent before God so go and dip seven times okay all right I'll go do it and maybe he was grumbling the whole time I wanted to see Elijah I wanted to see the guy and he goes down this is the muddiest river in in all of Israel the Jordan why couldn't he pick this how could he why why do I have to do this why do I have to wear this why did the prophet say to do it this way why was he so specific about shorts pretty quiet in here I'll just say to you you're better off in life to not mess with God's absolutes if he laid an absolute in there there's a reason for it it's not a Hell or Heaven issue but it's put there for a reason okie dokie praise the Lord everybody he finished the story he went ahead and dipped seven times and when he come out he was healed of his leprosy so this Prophet was asking you to do something first a personal contact with God through Elisha but he's asking for you to do something first and he did that with this woman he says woman what do you have need of what can I do for you she says they're going to take my sons we're in debt you know my husband's gone I'm a widow he served you with the fear of God he loved the message of the hour he's gone we're under the pressure of this famine and they're going to take my children I have nothing he said you have nothing she said I have nothing do you have anything well I've got a pot of oil left now when Elijah dealt with the widow woman she had a little a little meal and she had a little bit of oil and he says I want you to take that and make a cake she said well I'm making the cake it's my last cake for me and my son to die we're gonna that's it we're finished go and make the cake take what oil you have put it together make a cake and bring the cake to me so I can eat God knows how to test you in What You Won't Give Up but she did it and she got a miracle and this woman said all right he said go get all the vessels empty them all make sure there's nothing in the vessels empty out the vessels and and and then you start bringing this together and the sun sun started to do it behind closed doors in a secret place with God and they filled every vessel up every empty vessel vessel was filled with the oil can you say praise the lord it's a type of our day bring your empty vessel to God empty out of yourself empty out of your knowledge and your past bitterness and your past experiences empty out of your religious Pride empty out of all of it and say God fill it now with your oil she had a pot of oil that's all and this is the way the prophet said and I'll finish up this part and then we'll move along she had a pot of oil that's all you have to give what you got how many believe you have to give what you've got see I believe I got a little bit of God in Me here give it to God because you need more can you say Amen I'm going to say I need more of his oil to make it through this present Darkness to make it to the last leg of the journey I need more I don't need more religion I don't need more of smearing on the message I need more of this oil and you have to ask God for it this is what I have I give it to you fill me with more of it can I have that quote uh here it's in perfect strength perfect weakness he comments on this widow woman can I have that one or do I have to push this okay one one this this lady had just a vessel with a little oil in it and she had nothing her two sons was going to be sold for bondsmen she had nothing else she could do with this little vessel of oil wasn't very much she was at the end Elijah said to her said what have you got in your house said just a little oil in a vessel said go to your neighbors borrow plenty of them there look getting ready before it even happens huh get ready David heard that sound in the mulberry bush Elijah saw a cloud just the size of a hand said I hear the sound of abundance of rain if God can only get some empty vessels that's right he said fill the house full of them amen see what God wants God's got to have empty vessels listen we've got to we've got so much Doctrine so much ecclesiastical nonsense until we're down at the end of the barrel there's only one thing left turn to God in his word and if you'll do that get some empty vessels take out all the methodists out of them all the Pentecost out of them all the Baptists out of them and just let them be vessels and set them up in the house and then take from this vessel and begin to pour just begin to pour she had enough to take care of her and her kids and everything else and pay off all of her debts why why just what little she had consecrated it to God and following the word of this Prophet she came out right somebody say praise the Lord she came out right praise the Lord now let me go back to this theme of finishing you know God is looking for ones who can finish the race not just starters it's not that you begun believing this message of Christ a lot of people begin how many knows that 2 million come out of Egypt under a prophet's message how many know that there's a lot of people that began the journey with a prophet out of Egypt through the Wilderness there was a great host that did that there was a lot of starters but very few finishers it's that you it's not that you begin but it's that you that's how you end is that you end the same way Jesus said if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed God is a completer how many knows that God is a completer God is not wanting to start something in you he wants to finish something in you he that hath begun a good work in you will be faithful to complete a work in you and so if we're at the completion we should be saying God you're the completer how do you want to complete my life is it just to make a lot of money no no God how do you want to complete my life I look some of the older people in our church and the older people through the generations and I always refer to them being the older people even though I'm 50 something years old they're still the older people but I look at some some pillars in this house of God and pillars around the country that are in our mentors and I see where this message can take somebody in their old age their lost of the bitterness they've lost these things they become prayer warriors that's what them and their wife do they're enjoying life they're enjoying their grandchildren but they're filled with the spirit and they're praying and taking needs I couldn't survive without some of them praying for me they're doing it and I say Lord that's where that's that's where this message is taken to me me not more worldliness not wondering who I am but I know who I am it's stability it's a pillar in the house of God and that's what you have to ask where am I going how will I end up in this Christian walk because there's a lot of people ending up forsaking it walking away at this last minute of the journey no we're not supposed to jump off the sidelines out of this race the last minute no we're supposed to finish the race [Music] I look at her say God that's right when I was a young preacher I went to a Minister's meeting and they had a couple Brothers there from Africa which have so much less of conveniences than me they live very meagerly those Brothers they don't have nothing but yet they have the wealth a lot of them some of them speak English some another language but I came and listened to them to speak and I'm being honest with you that as a young man I was affected not just at the depth and the wealth of what they preach I thought my you don't hear this from even some American ministers this just has such a purity to it in such a depth to it in such a but it wasn't just that it was just the maturity of where this message had taken their lives the balance in their life the maturity you couldn't sense any any uh questionable where they stood you knew where they stood and it wasn't bold or arrogant it was just balanced character of Christ and I said as a young preacher I said if that's where this message is taking us I'm ready to go it's not taken us to more childhood and juvenile attitudes and just doubting in things of the world still trying to figure out who we are it's taken us to maturity and adoption how many would say this message has taken us to adoption not teeter-totter and whether we know what we believe in but it's take us to strengthen the word confidence in the word and this generation marks gray hair they mock the old stay young forever ever seen a 60 year old and his wife on Harley it's funny it's like be careful when you're on that thing what are you doing where did you get that what are you trying to be here you're 60 years old maybe 70. I don't know but what are what image are you trying to live out you are not 21 years old anymore sup the news flash because why we're in a generation that older people and just that sin seniority and the wisdom and growing and learning things is mocked and the Bible's the opposite way we should be glad to have those gray-headed people around we should be glad to have those bald-headed people around it's not just their bald head or their gray hair it's if they've grown in the word got an amen on the bald heads there that they've grown to such a maturity and stability we can we can lean on that and say and I've said it before young couples are raising young kids they never go ask the older ones who've already raised 10 kids we don't have to ask for advice I know how to do it already what a shame it's because this generation the odor are mocked and they're the ones that's been there done that got the t-shirt and they're never asked for advice hardly at all if they do that when they reach 35 years old say Dada need your advice or something they come in and you're okay you're 35 and now you're starting to ask for advice because they knew everything they knew everything you knew everything but the hard knocks that we go through we might know something to help you praise the Lord God is a completer he that has begun a good work in you will be faithful to complete it a lot of people start the race but who will finish it can you say Amen we're in a race to win can you say Amen I looked up the word endure and to the end because I knew I felt like I remember it had been the Bible several times it was endure until the end and it says in First Corinthians 1 7 I'm going to go through these quickly so you may not be able to keep up up there but go ahead and give it a try Rebecca First Corinthians 1 7 so that you come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall also confirm you until the end that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ he shall confirm you unto the end Hebrews 3 6 Hebrews 3 6 but Christ as a son over his own house whose house are we If We Hold Fast the confidence and the rejoicing of Our Hope firm unto the end say that with me unto the end hold firm unto the end Hebrews 3 14. for we are partake made partakers of Christ if we're partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast until the end Hebrews 6 6 11 Hebrews 6 11 and we desire that every one of you to show the same diligence for to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end and the last one in this section is Revelations 2 26 Revelations 2 26 and he that overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give power over the Nations God is a completer God is looking at those who want to complete and finish this race until the end but there's a lot of things that's discouraging us to jump ship but it's not that you started it's how you're finishing oh you don't know the stress you don't know my kids you don't know all that I've been through you don't know all the message situations yeah I know some of it I don't really want to know all of it all I know is there's a washing in the water of the word that you can wash your past away and start fresh today and say Lord how do I want to end this race and all this bitterness or do I want to let it go Let It Go and in this race running this race with fervor being filled with the spirit let my kids see me filled with the spirit let my kids see me in that secret place with Christ let my kids maybe even call me fanatical but let them see he was a man filled with the spirit he didn't get it all into all the games and everything as much as I did but I can tell you he was a man of prayer he was a man in the spirit he was a man that could laugh at wholesome jokes he's a man that could have fun but he was a man that was on his knees and filled with the spirit of God somebody say praise the Lord there's some other ones here in Matthew 24 10 if you'd like to turn there Matthew 24 10. I want to read all of these or two of them in Jesus prophecy and I'm ending here real soon I I'm going to do that Matthew 24 10 because I believe that you're getting the subject here this morning anybody being blessed a little bit to help you Matthew 24 I'm trying to preserve my voice a little bit I'm recording a new uh CD and working on it tonight and every time I scream and preach there's not much left and I think I've already done that it's too late Matthew 24 look at this pick this up in verse how about yeah verse 10. this is the end time now and then many shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another Well boy that sure sounds like today a day of betrayal and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many so notice the pressure of the last times pressure people betraying you the pressure of being many being offended easily offended the pressure of betraying one of the pressure of actually hating one other people hating one another that's not just in the world too by the way I've experienced it within the church that's a pressure that's a Darkness can you say Amen it's an internal Darkness sometimes it's there and then it says many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many now let me just say something about false prophets you know what they are you can have false prophets till God sends a true one you can't have a counterfeit dollar until you have a real dollar so there would be no false prophets unless there was a true one to work off of so we should say I see the false prophets but that says there's a real one I got to find the real one and follow him it's real simple and another thing about false prophets another thing false prophets are known for saying things opposite of the true prophet that's sent from God there's a true Prophecy from God and they become counterfeits to it and a lot of times they're known because they're going to say what's opposite the true prophet of God what he said they're going to say the opposite and in many cases the false prophet is speaking against what the true Prophet has said false prophet Spirits are speaking against the true prophet and what he said that's a pattern in the Bible look it up God sends a true Prophet then the false one comes along and he's saying something opposite of what the true Prophet is saying that's how we know it's a false prophet and then verse 12 notice now you got the pressure of betrayal the pressure of the love going cold the pressure of false prophets the pressure of people hating one another many false prophets verse 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold that's what we deal with in this generation but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved Hallelujah you know what that tells me somebody's going to endure all this somebody's going to endure false prophets somebody's going to endure being betrayed he's looking to those that will endure all of this because he that shall endure to the end not somebody who gives up and says I can't take it no more this betrayal in the message word I I'm finished he's looking for those but he that shall endure to the end through all of this shall be saved Mark 13 and verse 11. notice the conditions now notice we endure these conditions how many just say Amen to this he has the oil for us to make it all the way until the end this oil will cause us to endure to the end some more conditions is Mark 13 11 when it says but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought before what ye shall speak neither do you premeditate what you're going to speak but whatsoever he shall be shall be given to you in that hour that speake for it is not ye that speak but the Holy Ghost praise be to God I don't have to if I'm brought before I'm being questioned and challenged or something I got the Holy Ghost within me and you don't pretend I need to prepare for six months and be prepared for this not if you have the Holy Ghost Inside don't pre-mediment take under what you're going to say he said you depend on the Lord and in that hour when you need it the Holy Ghost will speak through you that tells me the Holy Ghost is going to speak to the bride can I get an amen the Holy Ghost is going to speak through you and you may not have all the knowledge of every quote in this message but if you've got the oil it'll speak through you when you need it in that hour praise the Lord now the brother now the brother shall betray the brother to death and the father shall betray the son and the children shall rise up against their parents that's all pressures in our time so I need the grace of the Lord because sometimes children can come into the spirit of the age disobedient to parents it's the spirit of the age the terror against the very ones that love them turn against the very Pastor that loves them they'll rise up against their parents and shall cause them to be put to death verse 13 and ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he is everybody prepared as we get closer to the final stage of this journey to be hated of all men because of the name of Jesus Christ are you prepared for that and you should be honest I don't know if I'm up to that I don't have enough oil for that it's time to pray for more oil because there's more pressures coming you'll be hated you'll be hated for this message why are you linking Christ with the message because Christ sent the message the message revealed Christ the Christ of the ages has been revealed through this message it's the person of Jesus Christ that's why I said a few Sundays ago this message isn't just a set of books and tapes it's the revealing of Jesus Christ in the last age and so when we name the name of Christ in this way in the word for this hour we will be hated of men for his namesake but he that shall endure until the end shall be saved [Applause] I love all those scriptures that say he that shall endure to the end I see my name in there somehow with all my mistakes and all my blunders and all that people don't like me or whatever I see my name Lord I want to be that one I don't care how much betrayal I don't come here how much there's all kinds of politics I just want to endure to the end and I want to finish well I want to walk through those doors into the other dimension and hear only just a few words well done thou good and faithful servant well done oh I feel his presence here so so real here this morning don't you just watch you just lift your hand say Lord I feel your presence near I just want to say how much I love you right now I just want to say Lord from the depths of my heart I love you I love this word I love this message I'll stand for it Lord Hallelujah and I want to hear those words well done well done oh what are the greatest scriptures here to wrap it up in his first Corinthians 9 24 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize no they was running a race there's a lot of runners in the race there's a lot of Runners can you say man but only one receives the price so run that you may attain you know what that says I'm running this race to win can I get your attention this morning if you got in this race then you should get in to win I'm in here to stay for the duration and I'm finishing the race and I'm finished and I got in this race to win not to lose not to quit if you're running in the race there's many running in the race but there's only one that's striving to win so run that you may obtain in The Message Bible it says you've all been to a stadium and seen all kinds of athletes in the race everyone runs but one wins so run to win Hallelujah run away be in the race to win follow the bridegroom run towards the bridegroom I'm going to finish this last egg of the race I'm about to finish it with the oil can you say you can't finish it without the oil run the race she brought her vessels that girl brought her vessels empty to be filled with oil it made all the way to the end it was enough the Bible said and the oil stayed that's my sermon to you this morning the oil stayed there was enough oil to finish out the darkness to finish out the days of famine she she lived through it all and guess what she got her children back too somebody say praise the Lord she got her children back they didn't take them away from her this soil is so powerful it'll bring your children back to you this oil is so powerful it'll bring you into the glories of God this oil is so powerful it'll heal cancer this oil is so powerful it'll give us rapturing Faith this oil is powerful to make you a mighty warrior this oil is hard when you give your face when you don't have faith the most essential thing at the end time is the oil so we empty our vessels and we say Lord let me empty out and fill me back up with your oil if I go out of here with not a dime to my name I don't know from one day to the next about the economy we've got a little bit stashed a very little bit stashed in some kind of stocks and bonds that we got to build a little bit of real estate I never know one day the next event it could be gone but I don't care I want to be filled with the oil that's the most essential thing if I'm poor the rest of my life if I don't have anything I'm gonna go in with the oil I'm going to have it burning in my lab somebody's going to look at me and say there's a man that's on fire for the Holy Ghost and for the word my testimony you know you choose your own testimony I teach young people you choose your own testimony what do you want people to say about you how do you want to be known a lot of times you get to this age you start to see talk about your legacy what Legacy do you want to leave I think you should do it as a young person what testimony what Legacy do I want to leave what testimony do I want in the congregation is someone that's just worldly somebody just dabbles in church and out of church you choose your own testimony I tell you I say I want to be a testimony if there's nobody else on the young people that's filled with oil I want them to be able to speak on their lips and say there is a youth that's filled with the oil [Applause] praise be to God you love him this morning let's run this race to win let's not run it to quit some of you have been thinking about quitting some of you got those doubts I've been enjoying a sermon by Charles Spurgeon I just I just love some of his sermons and I might take a sermon on it off of his sermon I don't know if that's permissible or not to preach on Charles spurgeon's sermon but he he does a incredible job of Brother Steve of dissecting uh talking about Abraham brushing all the he brought this worship this sacrifice did it like God he's waiting for the fire to come down but he's got to keep all the fouls off of the sacrifice and Spurgeon goes into this whole thing of Us coming to church and us trying to worship God and all the fouls are coming and if we don't swish them away or blow them away we're going to be cheated out of worship and he goes into detail of all the thoughts business thoughts what some of you been thinking this morning you can't keep away from your phone right now some of you can't keep on what am I doing tomorrow what's my schedule what's this shame on you you can't even give whole worship to almighty God he goes the thoughts of business and this what's this going to happen what's the stock market going to do then he calls a evil lustful thoughts come to you while you're at church hey come to you to rob you the fouls are coming around in your thought life can't worship God freely unless you Swish and push away all those fouls say get away all those thoughts right now I don't care if I lose every dime tomorrow I'm here to worship God today I'm going to give them Sundays to him I'm gonna give every day to him but Sunday's for sure I'm going to give to him undistracted not my thought life being distracted listen listen I'm ending right now I'm ending right now listen we should run this race we jumped in this race and we started running I didn't plan this but my wife says I need the exercise you all jumped in this race towards the bridegroom you all jumped in or maybe you're barely and I don't know why get to the very end and just somebody said this message isn't true somebody said this we're on the last leg of the journey and we didn't join the race to lose we joined it to win to finish the last leg so you might be out of out of breath like I am just running around there I'm out of breath you might be out of breath you might get discouraged sometimes you might be out of shape spiritually I pray a faith would just ignite you this morning because I'm here to tell you as a gospel Minister we are on the closing seconds of time this thing is just about over I heard a message preachers say that 20 years ago well we're a lot closer now than when that preacher said that we're like seconds a lot of seconds closer so all the more reason to jump in this race and if you're in it to say I'm in it to win it I said I'm in it to win it it's a song Sherry who can run home and write it but we compete you know I'm writing that first before she I'm in it to win it and you reach the last leg what a shame you just give out see I've seen too much I've done too much I just no we're almost there this is not the time to compromise good give me fill me with your oil Lord to make the last leg of the trip and you feel him he just feels you whoo glory be to God Murray I want to finish the trip I made it to win it I want to finish the race with courage and with strength and the one thing I'll need to finish it and that's the Holy Ghost let's stand and Worship the Lord together oh we want to finish this race Hallelujah is it in is it in a time right now to seek more oil can you say man isn't it time we should be praying more instead of less isn't this the last second to draw closer instead of further apart isn't it isn't it the time to draw close together in congregation instead of split off isn't it time to be more faithful to services and not less isn't it time to come and be repenting more than less repenting isn't it time to be more in the word than other things maybe it's a Time For Less movies more of God isn't a time to be more on fire for God than lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God is it time to be more Sanctified instead of pushing the envelope and the edge of what we should wear or do isn't it a time to seeking more spiritual fellowship and relationship than shallow relationships and shallow Fellowship isn't it a time that we stop hanging around friends all the time that are the wrong friends but hang around with friends of like Precious faith I'd say if there's any time this is the time to do that this is the last seconds of time this is the last leg of the race and we're going to rent it with prations can you say Amen I can run through a troop I can leap over a wall hallelujah hallelujah he's my rock and my shield he gets strength for all Hallelujah I am free from condemnation that's the song sis Jesus is the rock of my salvation I can run through a troop I can leap over a wall Hallelujah Hallelujah I'm not really interested in your thoughts of what the devil's giving you that you're not worthy of this this morning not interested I'm interested you get a whole anointing your faith Lord anoint my faith Forgive Me Lord approaching this lazy but today I'm going to seek more of God that's what I'm interested in I

a wall Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] deal he gives power to all Hallelujah [Music] Jesus is the rock of my salvation [Music] Hallelujah [Music] I'm gonna make it he already said that I would I'm gonna make it the last leg of this journey
