[0:00] we've been reading out of Luke 15 we've
[0:01] been teaching out of it a little bit and
[0:03] preaching and so we're gonna pick it up
[0:04] now and the prodigal son Luke 15 has
[0:07] three parables in it and this is the
[0:09] last parable that he gives starting here
[0:11] in verse 11 he said a certain man had
[0:13] two sons and the younger of them said to
[0:15] his father father give me the portion of
[0:17] goods that fall it to me and he divided
[0:20] them unto his living and not many days
[0:21] after the younger son gathered all
[0:23] together and took his journey into a far
[0:26] country and there was there wasted his
[0:29] substance with riotous living and when
[0:31] he had spent all there arose a mighty
[0:33] famine in the land and he began to be in
[0:35] want and he went and joined himself to a
[0:37] citizen of that country and he sent him
[0:39] into his fields to feed swine and he
[0:42] would fain have filled his belly with
[0:44] husk that the swine did eat and no man
[0:48] gave unto him notice what happens here
[0:50] right now he's not wet back with the
[0:51] father yet he's not back in church he's
[0:53] not but something happens that's very
[0:55] significant and when he came to himself
[0:58] and that tells us he came to who was
[1:03] himself it wasn't out with the swine who
[1:07] was his true identity he's a son of God
[1:09] can you say man but he had to recognize
[1:12] I'm not this I'm a son of God and so now
[1:16] that at that mother end to me friends
[1:18] that's a crucial moment that's the most
[1:20] important silent moment in a person's
[1:23] life only God can give that man a woman
[1:25] a revelation like that sometimes it's
[1:27] not with the big emotion not big on
[1:30] television stations it's a personal
[1:33] revelation I am a son of God I am NOT a
[1:36] son of this world and when he came to
[1:39] himself he said how many hired servants
[1:41] of my father's have bread enough to
[1:43] spare and I perish with hunger I will
[1:45] arise and go to my father and will sand
[1:48] him father I have sinned against heaven
[1:50] and before thee look at the humility now
[1:52] and AM no more worthy to be called thy
[1:54] son make me as one of the hired service
[1:56] look at the humility he doesn't come
[1:58] with arrogance and pride expecting
[1:59] anything he comes with repentance and
[2:01] humility and that's the way to come back
[2:03] to God
[2:04] and he arose and came to his father and
[2:07] when he was yet a great great way off
[2:11] his father saw
[2:12] and had compassion and ran and fell on
[2:16] his neck and kissed him and the son said
[2:18] unto him father I've sinned against
[2:20] heaven in thy sight and no more worthy
[2:22] to be called thy son but the father said
[2:24] to his servants bring forth the best
[2:25] robe and put it on him and put a ring on
[2:28] his hand and shoes on his feet this sure
[2:31] isn't a different this is a very
[2:33] different response than a lot of
[2:34] religious Pharisee people when somebody
[2:37] comes back oh boy you got to come
[2:39] through the seven steps of whatever here
[2:42] you can't just walk in here that's not
[2:45] how the father did it put a robe on it
[2:48] why he's a son he was born a son in any
[2:52] trouble that has been caused the
[2:55] father's going to take care of it
[2:56] but the subject in the rejoicing he's a
[2:58] son and bring hither the fatted calf and
[3:01] kill it and let us eat and be merry for
[3:03] this my son was dead and is alive he was
[3:07] lost and is found and they begin to be
[3:11] merry somebody say praise the Lord now I
[3:14] know I'm keeping you standing but I just
[3:16] want to add a couple other scriptures
[3:18] with this so that when I refer to them
[3:21] you'll see where they're at mark chapter
[3:22] 13 and verse 27 and I'll try not to be
[3:25] too lengthy today because this is a vast
[3:29] subject so we'll just take it in pieces
[3:31] but we'll just get in this segment here
[3:33] and I want to speak on the ministry and
[3:36] joy of sons coming back the ministry and
[3:41] joy of sons coming back and I believe
[3:44] we're in that hour can you say man
[3:47] dispensation Lee were in the hour where
[3:50] sons are recognizing who they are and
[3:52] they're coming back to the Father amen
[3:55] wherever you're at mark 13 verse 27 and
[3:58] he's in prophecy now for the end time I
[4:01] can't read all these but Jesus is
[4:03] breaking down the seven seals and the
[4:06] time of the seals and the time of the
[4:07] church and all the pressure on the
[4:09] church but in the middle of all this he
[4:11] seeks about false Christ's and false
[4:12] prophets shall arise with the true
[4:15] anointing on them the anointing is not
[4:17] false but the Prophet himself is false
[4:19] because he doesn't bring the true Word
[4:21] of God so we learn all that but he went
[4:23] in the middle of this he says this verse
[4:24] 27 and
[4:26] shall he send His angels and shall
[4:28] gather together his elect from the four
[4:31] winds from the uttermost part of the
[4:34] earth to the uttermost part of heaven go
[4:38] with me quickly diffusions chapter 1 and
[4:40] you'll hear it again
[4:41] and the reason I'm really reading these
[4:43] prophetic scriptures from Paul and from
[4:47] Jesus is because I'm finding now that
[4:50] Luke chapter 15 in the three parables I
[4:53] really believe that they're prophetic of
[4:56] the day we live in if he's in chapter 1
[5:01] appreciate your patience so you just
[5:04] wanted to read these in that way you'll
[5:06] know where I'm getting them from you
[5:09] love the Lord this morning
[5:11] seasons chapter 1 and verse 10 the same
[5:17] theme that in the dispensation of the
[5:19] fullness of times he'll do what he might
[5:22] gather together in one all things in
[5:26] Christ both which are in heaven and
[5:28] which are on earth even in him what's
[5:31] that mean
[5:32] sons coming back sums coming back in
[5:35] whom sons and daughter excuse me I got
[5:37] to say that you know sons in the Bible
[5:39] represent sons and daughters we're all
[5:41] sons of God spiritually but it's the
[5:43] sons and daughters coming back in whom
[5:45] also we have obtained an inheritance
[5:46] being predestinated according to the
[5:49] purpose of him who worketh all things
[5:50] after the counsel of his own will that
[5:54] we should be to the praise of his glory
[5:56] who first trusted in Christ in whom ye
[5:59] also trusted after that ye heard the
[6:02] word of truth the gospel of your
[6:03] salvation in whom also that after you
[6:06] believed you were sealed with the Holy
[6:08] Spirit of promise which is the earnest
[6:11] or the downpayment the Holy Ghost is the
[6:13] downpayment it's not the full possession
[6:15] yet which is the downpayment of our
[6:18] inheritance until look at this season
[6:20] now the redemption of the purchased
[6:22] possession unto the praise of his glory
[6:27] it's prophetic we get the Holy Ghost all
[6:30] through the agency got the Holy Ghost
[6:31] but it's only the downpayment there's a
[6:33] day coming we get the full possession
[6:35] and we're living in that time may the
[6:37] Lord had his blessings to the word god
[6:39] bless you may be seated
[6:40] now as I said the whole chapter in in
[6:43] Luke chapter 15 the whole chapter is
[6:48] about lost sons and backslidden sons
[6:51] coming back that's the theme the whole
[6:54] theme you remember I started out this
[6:55] with Jesus sitting there and this is the
[6:58] chapters start with Jesus amongst the
[7:00] sinners amongst the publicans and he
[7:03] didn't go out to them they came to him
[7:05] and they were around him listening to
[7:07] him talk and it was the Pharisees in
[7:09] Chapter in verse two that said why does
[7:12] he receive publicans centers so that's
[7:14] what set the theme for these parables is
[7:16] Jesus the Son of Man was actually so
[7:19] attractive that the public Republicans
[7:22] and sinners felt comfortable to be
[7:24] around him you remember what I said how
[7:26] many would like you to live a Christian
[7:27] life that it's so much Christ that this
[7:29] same manner that sinners and publicans
[7:31] actually enjoy being around you too
[7:35] often in the church Christians are not
[7:37] an enjoyment to be around because
[7:38] there's no passion in their life about
[7:40] Christ it's a religion to them I don't
[7:42] think it was that way with Christ I
[7:44] believe there's something about him that
[7:46] even the sinners and publicans felt
[7:47] comfortable to be around him
[7:48] and so that's how this theme because
[7:51] when the Pharisees criticized it and
[7:52] said hey you know you're receiving
[7:54] you're eating with publicans centers and
[7:56] these people we don't get around people
[7:58] like this and this is not what we do and
[8:00] so he criticizes so now in order to
[8:02] explain what was happening there he goes
[8:06] into three parables and the parables are
[8:09] about lost sons lost sheep lost coin and
[8:12] a lost son or son that backslidden so
[8:15] the parable is about lost sons and sons
[8:18] coming back sons that were lost coming
[8:21] back that's the theme in the parables at
[8:24] the Sheep it's a coin it's a son that's
[8:27] already belonged to the father
[8:28] they were just lost I want you to
[8:30] remember the Sheep it was already the
[8:33] shepherd sheep the coin was already the
[8:37] woman's coin the prodigal son was
[8:40] already a son can you say mine
[8:44] it wasn't he became a son he was already
[8:46] a son in anybody who studies
[8:48] the Bible knows predestination if you
[8:50] ever were a Christian you were a
[8:52] Christian in God's mind before the
[8:55] foundation of the world the lamb was
[8:57] slain before the foundation of the world
[8:59] in God's mind because he knew sons had
[9:02] to be redeemed and so this parable says
[9:05] these are not people that are people
[9:07] that are coming they're already sons but
[9:10] they've lost their way
[9:11] they either backslidden or they haven't
[9:13] even come to the Father yet and so now
[9:16] it's this I want to say this clearly now
[9:19] these parables are not about serpent
[9:22] seed he's not referring to serpent seed
[9:24] what's serpent seed
[9:26] give me another servant to talk about
[9:27] that there were two seeds that were in
[9:30] Genesis can you say men and and so so
[9:33] now but he's not referring to serpent
[9:36] seed he's referring to sons that were
[9:39] already the fathers sons everybody
[9:42] understand that so so now it's sons
[9:45] coming back and the reason that Jesus
[9:47] did not push away these sinners and
[9:48] publicans listen the reason he didn't
[9:51] push away reason Jesus didn't say oh man
[9:53] wait a minute why are you guys gathering
[9:54] around me what are you doing like this
[9:56] is this is making me nervous here I mean
[9:58] what's this gonna look like me sitting
[10:00] around with publicans and sinners he
[10:01] didn't say any of that and you know why
[10:03] he didn't push away the sinners and
[10:05] publicans because in that group might be
[10:08] some of his sons in fact I think he knew
[10:13] that was some of his sons and so why
[10:16] would he push away people that were
[10:19] potentially that his own sons his own
[10:22] seed can you say man that were coming
[10:24] back to him that's all
[10:26] that's what his ministry is all about is
[10:30] finding lost sons that were
[10:34] predestinated in the father before the
[10:37] foundation of the world why would Jesus
[10:39] push away the sinners Republicans
[10:41] because among them is some of his sons
[10:43] and this is the only way for them to
[10:45] come back that's what his ministry is
[10:47] all about and the Pharisees in their
[10:49] religion and denominations had got to a
[10:52] place that I can't even be around in
[10:54] other words they had lost the focus of
[10:57] who the son at what the ministry was can
[11:00] I get an amen
[11:01] they
[11:01] completely lost what Jesus Christ the
[11:04] cinnamon and the whole ministry was all
[11:05] about they completely lost the idea
[11:07] because they said look at him being
[11:09] around the sinners and Providence they
[11:10] lost the fact that this whole thing the
[11:12] gospel is about calling sons calling
[11:16] sons drawing them back to God so I don't
[11:21] know what they were doing they were all
[11:23] about their rituals and religions and
[11:24] outward manifestations of what a
[11:27] righteous man should be if you know your
[11:29] Bible that's what Jesus always repeat
[11:31] the Pharisees for it was an external
[11:33] thing it was all about external things
[11:36] let's be careful in the message we don't
[11:38] become all about external things can I
[11:41] get an amen
[11:42] there's too many too many slants to the
[11:45] years that put emphases on external
[11:47] things and don't dump out the external
[11:49] things I believe there's external things
[11:51] that are spoken over the scripture that
[11:52] are important don't you dare dumping
[11:54] dump them out but don't you dare take
[11:57] the message and make an emphasis on
[11:59] external things before you see a son
[12:02] come back in his soul because you're
[12:04] gonna make another religion and lord
[12:08] have mercy we don't need another
[12:10] religion we don't need another
[12:13] denomination within Christianity there
[12:16] are thirty five thousand different
[12:17] denominations within Christianity we
[12:20] don't need another denomination we need
[12:23] a manifestation of the son of man in the
[12:26] people's lives that draw sons back to
[12:29] God somebody say Amen this morning oh
[12:32] man I'm heated up I'm heated up about
[12:36] this this is what the message is all
[12:38] about just what the mess is all about
[12:42] I'm just got to warn you today I had
[12:44] seven fillings put in my teeth
[12:47] just a couple days ago and my wife
[12:50] noticed and getting a notice that I'm
[12:51] talking kind of funny because
[12:53] something's happening back here don't
[12:54] know what it is so I'm just warn you if
[12:57] I talk funny don't laugh and also this
[13:01] may be a very short service today
[13:03] because if I recognize I'm talking funny
[13:05] I'm not gonna go on with that too much
[13:07] further but you know this is such an
[13:11] important thing to recognize that Jesus
[13:14] did not
[13:14] pushed him away when they were sinners
[13:16] because out of that there might be sons
[13:19] there who were coming back and he said
[13:22] in one place I forgot to quote this last
[13:23] Sunday because I forget a lot of things
[13:25] but he said in one place he says I did
[13:28] not come to call the righteous the son
[13:34] of man did not come to call people that
[13:37] were already righteous in their own
[13:40] righteousness my ministry that even the
[13:43] message did not come to call the already
[13:46] righteous it come to call sinners to
[13:49] repentance and we need to be reminded of
[13:54] these things can you say men so now the
[13:57] the ministry now as we focus in deeper
[14:00] the ministry my ministry is to call my
[14:03] sons and daughters to call my sons the
[14:06] gathering of Christ the Son of man in
[14:09] whatever age the gathering is not for
[14:13] the purpose to stroke the religious
[14:15] pride of people the correct preaching of
[14:19] the gospel is not to stroke and comfort
[14:23] the religious pride that's in people can
[14:27] you say Amen that's why you look in the
[14:29] Old Testament and in the new you find in
[14:31] most cases biblical prophets usually
[14:35] weren't coming in prophesying good they
[14:39] were for correction they were to get
[14:41] Israel back in shape they got away from
[14:44] God that's why they were popular so now
[14:48] in the ministry of Christ in the
[14:50] atmosphere in gathering of of where he
[14:53] is around it's not to stroke the
[14:55] religious pride of people that's not the
[14:57] son of man that's not the ministry in
[14:59] the last days we cannot have an
[15:01] atmosphere in our lives or our churches
[15:03] that drive people away and make it
[15:05] comfortable for us that was so good I
[15:09] think I'll say it again you say well
[15:12] you're just gonna read from your notes
[15:13] today don't you don't you just let the
[15:15] Holy Spirit lead the Holy Spirit was
[15:17] leading me when I typed these out last
[15:18] night let me find it again there it is
[15:22] we cannot have an atmosphere in our
[15:25] lives or in our churches that drive
[15:27] people away
[15:28] and make it comfortable for us that's
[15:32] not the Ministry of the Son of Man
[15:34] something's wrong even in our own ranks
[15:37] if the atmosphere is not comfortable
[15:39] that they can sense the presence of God
[15:41] and they can come to a repentance in God
[15:43] and they can recognize their identity as
[15:45] sons and daughters of God that's what we
[15:48] gather in church for that's what the
[15:51] preaching of the gospel is for and so
[15:55] now we can't and and and we can't preach
[15:58] the blood is off the mercy seat and
[16:01] expect to find the last predestinated
[16:04] seed and some of you know what I'm
[16:07] referring to certain doctrines that
[16:09] start to emphasize the Lambs off the
[16:12] mercy seat he's left the mercy seat how
[16:15] could we ever have an atmosphere taken
[16:17] the doctrine that far I realize he arose
[16:20] in revelations 5 I'll refer to in a
[16:22] minute when he arose and he advanced
[16:25] into the vision of John and the the
[16:27] title deed to the earth fell out of
[16:29] son's hands fell out of Adam's hands
[16:31] went back to the hands of the original
[16:33] owner and until that time nobody had
[16:35] rights to the earth again like son
[16:36] should have it but somebody stepped
[16:38] forth into a vision and they said the
[16:40] line has prevailed John don't weep the
[16:42] line of prevailed you know who stepped
[16:45] forth in that vision when John looked to
[16:47] see a lie and he didn't see a line he's
[16:48] seen a lamb who's the lamb your kinsmen
[16:51] and you ought to rejoice because your
[16:55] kinsman somebody who was worthy and your
[16:58] kinsman took the book of the title deed
[17:01] that has happened in our day can you say
[17:04] man but then we have we have a process
[17:07] that's going on in the last days of him
[17:09] calling sons and then taking his full
[17:11] possession ending in a rapture so don't
[17:14] you dare tell me that mercies there's no
[17:17] mercy on the on the mercy seat because
[17:19] the lamb has went forth and now it's all
[17:21] a judgment seat you can't preach that
[17:23] and create an atmosphere for the last
[17:26] elected scene to come in it's the false
[17:28] doctrine and so now Jesus didn't say I
[17:35] really can't stay and talk with you
[17:37] senators I got like I've got a kingdom
[17:39] to run I got a I got
[17:41] things to do I got a plan for a kingdom
[17:43] I don't have time to be around sinners
[17:47] the kingdom is about sons and daughters
[17:49] of God the kingdom isn't about this
[17:52] church or the church that we build this
[17:55] year next year the kingdom is not about
[17:57] a building can you say man the kingdom
[18:00] is not a the kingdom is not about a
[18:02] place the kingdom about is not just the
[18:05] money in because what good would the
[18:06] Millennium be without sons and daughters
[18:08] there that are the kingdom people what
[18:11] good is a kingdom without the king and
[18:12] the queen and I'm here to tell you he's
[18:16] building a queen with character that
[18:18] she'll rule and reign with Christ for a
[18:20] thousand years honeymoon in the
[18:22] Millennium I wouldn't want to be there
[18:24] unless I was with the rest of the bride
[18:26] of Jesus Christ can you say man and my
[18:29] King Jesus Christ yeah I'll tell you the
[18:33] reason he that he was about these is
[18:35] because that is what the King knows
[18:37] about there is no Kingdom without his
[18:39] sons to rule with him and they're never
[18:41] that it'll never listen now his kingdom
[18:44] will never be complete until every one
[18:47] of his sons have recognized who they are
[18:50] and have come back to him Jesus doesn't
[18:55] say let me count up you can make
[18:58] calculate okay we got enough numbers now
[19:00] we can make it happen
[19:01] that was funny laughs thank you have a
[19:07] calculator and say you know what we've
[19:09] meet we've met the quota this is about
[19:12] how much people we needed a millennium
[19:13] we're good
[19:14] shut it off rapture we're done no no it
[19:18] won't be complete until every son is
[19:19] back that was in the mind of God from
[19:21] the foundation of the world so a lot of
[19:23] the reason we're still on this earth
[19:24] some of you fed up with her server I'm
[19:25] fed up with it too but most of the
[19:27] reason why we're still here is the last
[19:29] elected scene hasn't come in yet the
[19:31] last son hasn't come yet but when it
[19:33] comes when the last elected seed and all
[19:36] of his sons have come back to the Father
[19:38] we're getting out of here that's why I
[19:42] can sing it's going to it's going home
[19:43] time I said it's going home time we're
[19:46] in the hour can you say man he's calling
[19:49] his final son's back and when they come
[19:51] whether they're sitting here in this
[19:52] congregation
[19:53] and have not come back to God or whether
[19:55] they're a prostitute on the streets of
[19:57] Toledo when they come God's going to
[19:59] draw them and when the last one comes in
[20:01] we're getting out of here and the
[20:04] kingdom and the Millennium will not be
[20:06] complete until every Sun is back some of
[20:10] you have been some of you have child
[20:12] children that are away from the Lord he
[20:14] ought to reach a hold of that right now
[20:15] with your hand reach all that promise
[20:17] and said I believe my son is a son of
[20:18] God I believe my daughter is a daughter
[20:20] of God and I reach a hold of the promise
[20:23] right now that not one that the father
[20:25] has given me not one will be turned away
[20:27] all that the father has given me will
[20:30] come I don't know how it's going to
[20:32] happen I don't know how we're going to
[20:33] do it I don't know how it's it's a big
[20:35] hurdle and you look at this prodigal son
[20:38] you look at this prodigal son he felt
[20:40] unworthy to come back and you would
[20:43] think he'd be running back he wasn't
[20:45] running back because he felt unworthy to
[20:47] come back he's hasn't he stayed a far
[20:49] off role for a long time and I find sons
[20:52] that have messed their lives up they are
[20:55] they have it in their heart already to
[20:57] come back but they feel too unworthy let
[21:00] me tell you what the father did was that
[21:02] he didn't wait for him to come and
[21:03] repent he didn't wait for him to get all
[21:05] the way back to church the father ran
[21:07] out to him what do we do with sons that
[21:11] are far off we go to them praise be to
[21:20] God I feel like running today hallelujah
[21:25] am I talking funny or I'm doing all
[21:26] right everybody understanding all right
[21:29] we can continue so now there's there's
[21:31] no Kingdom without a son so let's move
[21:32] on so now I feel there's take just a bit
[21:35] deeper now I feel that this mark 11
[21:37] excuse me this Luke chapter 15 I feel
[21:40] that this the seventh seal revelation is
[21:43] all over this chapter and I didn't
[21:47] realize it till just the last few days
[21:48] but the seventh seal the coming of the
[21:50] Lord the seventh seal revelation what
[21:52] he's doing in the last days is all over
[21:54] these parables why do you say that
[21:57] brother Paul because in the last days as
[22:00] I read you two scriptures there's many
[22:01] more that refer to it the scriptures for
[22:03] the last days it refers to there is a
[22:06] gap
[22:07] during there's a gathering there's a
[22:10] calling and there's a gathering of his
[22:13] elect from the four corners of the earth
[22:15] the angels will call for it and there's
[22:18] a gathering of is his elect from the
[22:20] four corners of the earth now naturally
[22:22] that's happened to Israel and it's still
[22:25] happening to Israel right now
[22:26] whatever happens naturally to Israel
[22:29] happens to the bride's spiritually you
[22:33] listening whatever happens to Israel
[22:35] naturally happens to us spiritually so
[22:37] with the Second World War and the wars
[22:39] that took place many of the wars we find
[22:41] that there was a gathering of Israel
[22:43] back to her homeland she's still
[22:44] gathering back there it's a spiritual
[22:46] gathering and all his elect which would
[22:47] be there'll be many Jews gather back but
[22:50] there's a hundred and forty-four
[22:51] thousand their elected Benjamin Jews
[22:53] that are going to come back to Israel
[22:55] and receive Christ they're the elect but
[22:58] they've been gathered for the four wins
[23:00] spiritually God calls his sons in the
[23:02] Gentile bride he calls his sons from all
[23:05] the corners of the earth I don't know
[23:07] what corner you were in but whatever
[23:09] corner it is you were sitting in a bar
[23:13] you were with all kinds of men you women
[23:15] you were abused you were somewhere you
[23:20] you were atheist you didn't believe in
[23:22] God at all it doesn't matter what corner
[23:24] you came from if you're a son you're
[23:28] coming the obstacles isn't a problem
[23:32] with God because you're a son and what's
[23:34] that son recognized he's gonna start
[23:36] heading back once he recognized like the
[23:38] praça side
[23:39] what am I doing here what a discovery
[23:42] that the greatest discovery that can
[23:46] happen in a believers life is like what
[23:49] am i doing this for what am i doing here
[23:53] why I'm why am I in this bar
[23:56] why am I in this adulterous relationship
[24:00] this isn't me
[24:02] greatest discovery you can make I've
[24:05] tried my whole life to live like they
[24:07] live out there but this isn't me I'm a
[24:11] son of the father and I'm going back can
[24:17] you say man friends
[24:19] what a wonderful thing hope Solomon
[24:22] doesn't mind me sharing this but he
[24:25] shared it with his mom but you know he
[24:27] works in a restaurant as a waiter and so
[24:29] people can when they get a little you
[24:31] know drunk or sniffing he start saying
[24:33] so they asked him wearing what to school
[24:35] he said I went to Stateline Christian
[24:36] school right away they know that it's a
[24:37] conservative school they're very you
[24:39] know strict in certain areas there which
[24:41] I'm glad for and so right away oh yeah
[24:45] so the next question are you a virgin
[24:48] you take some off guards well yes I am
[24:52] so you've a matter of fact he says I've
[24:55] never even kissed a girl you'd imagine
[24:58] the laughter you can imagine this the
[25:00] smirks they said Oh son I let yes and
[25:05] here's my car let me take you out let me
[25:08] talk to you a little bit about about
[25:10] real life and having some fun so first
[25:17] of all young people and everyone you're
[25:20] always going to have traps for somebody
[25:23] to redefine your identity and to tell
[25:27] you you know what you're like us you're
[25:30] more like us than what you realize if
[25:32] you really let your you let yourself go
[25:34] there a little bit you'll find you're
[25:36] missing out on a lot of fun what a trap
[25:38] what a what a deception so he thinks
[25:42] that because he was at state liners
[25:44] because he's me raised in a Christian
[25:46] home whatever it is but I just started
[25:47] that as I was preaching I thought thank
[25:49] god praise the Lord Solomon took a stand
[25:51] said no this is the way I believe this
[25:53] way I'm gonna do it
[25:54] praise God but I got to thinking now if
[25:56] that goes deeper in Solomon that's not
[25:58] because he went to Stateline Christian
[26:00] school that's not just because he was
[26:02] raised in a Christian home that's all
[26:05] great and I think us parents should
[26:07] provide the best atmosphere that
[26:08] coincides with our beliefs as much as we
[26:11] can that's just my per se that's my
[26:14] opinion as a as a as a parent that's the
[26:17] way I've approached it is that if I can
[26:19] I tried to bathe and then ease them into
[26:22] being exposed to the things of the world
[26:23] that they have to be exposed to but when
[26:25] they're young I'm gonna try to put them
[26:27] as best I can as atmospheres at the
[26:29] closest to what I believe and so now but
[26:32] I want to
[26:32] that being said that doesn't guarantee
[26:35] that there would be someone that stays a
[26:37] virgin
[26:39] can you say man what does it come down
[26:42] to a son of God recognizing his identity
[26:46] that I'm a son and when that revelation
[26:49] is strong and powerful it's strong
[26:51] enough to go up against the temptation
[26:54] to say the same thing that Jesus said I
[26:57] am not of this world
[26:59] I am not from here I live here I'm in
[27:03] this world but I'm not out of this world
[27:05] I'm not a son of this world
[27:07] I don't function like they function in
[27:09] the world I'm a son of God can you say
[27:11] man was it state line that did it I
[27:13] believe it's a recognition that I could
[27:16] he didn't say it but he could say to
[27:18] them this is real simple I am NOT you
[27:22] and I know the reason we don't say that
[27:25] sometimes because it's belittling that
[27:26] person you have to be careful what you
[27:27] say but you say in your heart I know why
[27:30] I'm not you we're different
[27:33] by the grace of God I'm not you I'm a
[27:36] son of God okay can you say man that's
[27:42] the revelation that's needed so now the
[27:45] seventh seal revelation is that is in
[27:47] the last station it's a gathering elect
[27:49] to come back to the full inheritance
[27:50] you're still with me
[27:53] alright in their renovations yesterday
[27:55] they took the clock down so we're all in
[27:58] trouble now the taking of this book in
[28:00] Revelations 5 is about taking his
[28:02] possession back and our rights as sons
[28:04] bringing sons back to full inheritance
[28:07] revelations 5 when he takes that book
[28:09] it's the title deed to the earth Adam
[28:11] lost it he was the son of God on the
[28:12] earth he was in charge of the earth he
[28:14] had all power he can name the animals he
[28:16] can move trees he can move mountains he
[28:18] was a minor God on the earth can you say
[28:20] man but that title NIDA and that power
[28:22] and all that went with that he lost it
[28:24] in the fall so he didn't have the rights
[28:26] to it anymore I'm here to tell you when
[28:28] our lamb steps forth in revelations
[28:30] chapter 5 after 2,000 years of ancestry
[28:33] ancestry in incest in seseri work in
[28:37] other words he was our intercessor for
[28:39] 2,000 years and he was making our high
[28:42] priest making Appeals because he was our
[28:46] high
[28:46] but there was a change in motion when we
[28:49] come to revelations five that our lamb
[28:50] we went to Calvary and paid the price
[28:52] now steps forth and he's the only one
[28:55] worthy to take that deeded book and take
[28:58] that with our names in that book and he
[29:01] knows who the sons are he's gonna call
[29:03] his sons now from heaven and from Earth
[29:06] that's why in Revelations 5 he says when
[29:08] he took the book the Prophet said that
[29:10] it was a most sublime thing in the
[29:12] scripture and last Sunday I preached to
[29:14] you heaven begin to rejoice fact all the
[29:17] elders and all the ones where the
[29:18] prayers went up all those years they
[29:20] begin to rejoice over this taking of the
[29:22] book and it's word he has made us kings
[29:25] this priest the prophet word that he
[29:28] says he's taking us back to make us
[29:31] kings and priests in other words it's
[29:32] not just the sons on earth it's all of
[29:35] heaven rejoicing and they're saying he's
[29:38] gonna bring us all back to sons and
[29:40] daughters about he's gonna bring us back
[29:41] to be kings and priests and we shall
[29:44] reign on this earth wasn't gonna happen
[29:46] until the lamb took the book and that's
[29:49] why I said last Sunday whatever heaven
[29:52] rejoices over we're rejoicing over I was
[29:55] trying to just say what is it Lord about
[29:57] this what is it about this book this
[30:00] book going into the hands of our kinsmen
[30:03] that's a significant thing because your
[30:07] brother Christ your kinsman one of your
[30:10] own kind is that you understand what I'm
[30:12] saying came to earth and lived in a
[30:14] flesh body like yours has today has a
[30:18] hold of the title deed with all the
[30:22] names of the sons in it that's why they
[30:26] rejoiced that's why John shouted so loud
[30:30] he said everything in earth and
[30:32] everything in heaven and air all the ana
[30:34] lever ething heard me shouting I got a
[30:36] tad excited must have seen his name
[30:42] there under the seals he got excited can
[30:45] you say man I'm gonna skip over most of
[30:49] this part skip to the end here but this
[30:53] now because of that in the last days is
[30:55] a ministry I'm gonna call it of
[30:57] reconciliation
[30:59] Paul in second Corinthians five said
[31:02] Christ was reconciling us back to the
[31:05] Father and he says we have this Ministry
[31:08] of reconciliation so Christ had it
[31:09] wherever Christ is and if crisis in his
[31:12] bride what is it it's a ministry to
[31:15] reconcile sons that have gone away and
[31:18] reconciling put them back with the
[31:20] father so our ministry is to through the
[31:23] word this is to wrecked because he said
[31:25] it's a word of reconciliation our
[31:27] ministry is to take this word and take
[31:29] the life of Christ and reconcile sons
[31:32] back to the thoughts that God had in
[31:35] them before the foundation of the world
[31:38] somebody say praise the Lord and guess
[31:42] what you want to know what the message
[31:43] is that's what the message came to do
[31:46] this message is a gathering of sons it's
[31:49] the it's the angels calling in the last
[31:51] days for all the sons for the four
[31:52] corners and gather all in that are in
[31:54] Christ and gathered and whether in
[31:56] heaven on earth it's a great gathering
[31:58] of sons to call them all back to their
[32:00] inheritance and the lamb has the
[32:02] inheritance the title deed to all the
[32:03] inheritance and it's ready now to be
[32:05] handed back into use his children but
[32:07] you see now the word is to reconcile us
[32:11] back to the thoughts of God don't you
[32:13] forget that that's if you have Christ
[32:15] that's one of the main reasons he's
[32:17] given you Christ inside your life and
[32:18] that is to be available and create an
[32:20] atmosphere for lost sons and loss and
[32:24] backslidden sons to come back to God and
[32:29] I'll say it again this is the message
[32:33] that's what the message is you say well
[32:36] what about all the parts of it that
[32:40] trying to refer something else because I
[32:43] always refer to the same thing seems
[32:44] like but what about all the details
[32:47] about dressing modest and what about
[32:50] this and what you know what about all
[32:53] this that's that's in the message it's
[32:55] all still a part of sons coming back
[33:00] because if he's restoring daughters back
[33:02] to God then he would reconcile them back
[33:05] with what - what a daughter of God
[33:07] really dresses like can I get a name man
[33:11] that doesn't have to do with religion or
[33:13] Amish or anything like has to do with
[33:15] our Father God hovering over his
[33:18] daughters and saying I loved them so
[33:21] much I want to reconcile them back to
[33:23] what a daughter of God really is because
[33:26] they've heard way too many images they
[33:28] watched Hollywood way too much and
[33:30] they're tainted in their mind what a
[33:32] woman is I love them enough I'm gonna
[33:36] tell them through a prophet the
[33:38] restoration of this great position of a
[33:42] woman somebody pray your sisters ought
[33:45] to be clapping right now for me thank
[33:48] you that's what the message is every
[33:52] detail would see how fast to drive and
[33:55] all these other all those other things
[33:56] well I just look at it and saying sons
[33:58] are B sons are being called back to
[34:00] their true identity because the identity
[34:04] of the world and sometimes the identity
[34:06] of a denominational Christian and I
[34:09] don't mark all denominations like this
[34:10] but sometimes the image of a
[34:12] denominational Christian I couldn't
[34:14] follow it because there's no holiness
[34:17] there there's no sanctification anymore
[34:19] sanctification is marked but I believe
[34:22] in sanctification because it's in the
[34:24] Bible
[34:25] so that Christian he can keep his movies
[34:28] all the dirty movies he can still say
[34:31] some dirty jokes at work he can drink a
[34:33] little here and there he can do this I'm
[34:35] not happy with that type of image
[34:37] because I look in my Bible that's not
[34:38] the Bible image sons of God are gonna
[34:40] walk around he can't tell any difference
[34:42] in them and the guy at the bar I'm
[34:44] preaching hard now but I'm not here to
[34:46] not here to make it soft for you I'm
[34:48] here to tell you the truth are you
[34:50] interested in the I dieted identity of
[34:52] sons and daughters of God or are you
[34:54] interested in somebody's version of what
[34:56] a Christian should be I can't follow
[34:59] that I'm not interested in that it
[35:00] should be something different not odd or
[35:02] strange but it should be something
[35:03] distinct something different the
[35:05] identity of sons and daughters of God
[35:07] are coming on the face of the earth and
[35:08] they're gonna be displaying what the
[35:10] true sons and daughters of God are young
[35:14] people don't borrow from the image of
[35:15] the world get your mind out of the
[35:17] magazine get your mind out of the books
[35:19] because it's tainting your image of what
[35:21] your identity really should be where
[35:25] should I get
[35:25] I might get in the Word of God say why
[35:31] is the person doing that why are they
[35:33] starting to dress so sexy and why are
[35:35] they going off in that direction I'll
[35:36] just tell you one thing they're not in
[35:38] the word there's no way you can say
[35:41] baptized or bathed in this word all the
[35:43] time and come up with conclusions like
[35:45] that and come up with me you can't do it
[35:47] because the words a filter a thinking
[35:52] man's filter and back in the old days
[35:54] they had a slogan for the cigarette
[35:56] company a thinking man's filter or
[35:57] smoking man's taste and they were they
[36:00] were doing it to try to sell more
[36:01] cigarettes so they put a filter so you
[36:03] get all the tire you just get some of it
[36:04] oh did it make people want to smoke more
[36:06] of them because they had to get the same
[36:07] amount of tower tar oh yeah this is
[36:15] God's filter we bring our lives through
[36:18] this filter this is a thinking man's
[36:22] filter we bring our lives through the
[36:25] filter this word and I guarantee you
[36:26] what comes out the other side is a son
[36:28] and daughter of God the true identity of
[36:31] God amen praise the Lord you love him so
[36:36] now let me get done this last part here
[36:39] of your true identity because this is
[36:42] the calling of sons alright
[36:44] anybody seen in the last few years the
[36:48] great thrust
[36:54] anybody seen in the last few years the
[36:56] great thrust of companies doing ancestry
[36:59] research and DNA testing and that just
[37:07] come up I don't know how many years it
[37:08] just you just noticed it now it's a huge
[37:10] thing big thing so you pay so much money
[37:12] to ancestry.com and so and so now as
[37:18] believer in mature believers now look at
[37:20] this what happens in the natural in
[37:23] science is the type of what God's doing
[37:26] spiritually in the church so what the
[37:29] Prophet taught us okay we were in the
[37:32] horse and buggy days we didn't have
[37:34] automobiles well the church was in the
[37:36] horse and buggy days
[37:37] under Luthor restoration of
[37:39] justification then we came to the
[37:42] Automobile science invented the
[37:44] automobile so we're going faster the
[37:46] church is going faster it came in to the
[37:49] Wesley's age of sanctification the
[37:51] church was restored back more then we
[37:54] come into the airplane somebody the
[37:56] Wright brothers science develops an
[37:59] airplane so we're no longer in horse and
[38:01] buggy we're no longer no automobile
[38:03] we're flying high you know who that was
[38:04] 1906 Azusa Street Pentecostal the
[38:07] Pentecostal movement had a flying high
[38:10] brother enjoying the blessings of God
[38:12] the nine spiritual gifts in the church
[38:14] clapping our hands rejoicing can you say
[38:17] Amen I'm glad we still got that but it's
[38:19] not the last move of God Pentecost is
[38:22] not the last move of God that was the
[38:26] only small reflection of the original
[38:28] pink costs we're supposed to get going
[38:30] back to all of Pentecost lost not Azusa
[38:33] Street back to the damned Pentecost so
[38:36] science brought to the airplane and what
[38:38] was the next step
[38:39] astronaut Age so we're not just staying
[38:42] in the Pentecostal age the astronaut age
[38:44] where you leave the earth can you say
[38:46] man you're not just flying above above
[38:48] the where the clouds are you're going
[38:50] above the clouds and you're going to
[38:51] different planets so spiritually the
[38:53] church began to do this so what I always
[38:54] look in the news I would look for these
[38:56] developments in science one of them you
[38:58] could talk about is the development of
[38:59] the laser of light the development of
[39:01] light light light has been developed so
[39:04] much they can do so many things with
[39:05] light and surgeries with light piercing
[39:07] so what is that reflective of the light
[39:09] has become stronger the light has become
[39:11] more powerful the light is the word for
[39:13] the church she's got a powerful word
[39:16] so here when I begin to see these
[39:17] ancestry things come up it's all about
[39:19] identity it's all about people who have
[39:22] a hunger to find their true identity
[39:24] where did I come from why do I use my
[39:28] nose look this way whoa who's my what
[39:32] country did I come from did I originate
[39:34] in Africa that I did I did an Elizabeth
[39:37] Warren she got in trouble for all this
[39:39] you know she just threw it out there and
[39:42] it's something and then she had the dita
[39:43] so anyway let's leave that alone but
[39:45] anyway you know it's people who want to
[39:47] attach themselves but they want to find
[39:49] out their true ID
[39:51] can you say men and this thrust and this
[39:54] hunger is so so now they come to this
[39:56] place that they are no longer satisfied
[40:00] with things that are judged from the
[40:02] outward appearance are no longer
[40:04] satisfied with things that are judged
[40:07] from the outward appearance they want to
[40:09] find get to the seed realm they want to
[40:11] get to the DNA realm oh friends we ought
[40:16] to be shouting right now whatever
[40:18] happens now she's having spiritually the
[40:19] bride I'm no longer happy with a
[40:21] religion people judge me from the
[40:23] outside
[40:24] what's my spiritual DNA where did I come
[40:28] from
[40:28] how so now these people pay big sums of
[40:34] money now to say where they come in and
[40:36] they can stand there and say showed up a
[40:37] picture and here's my
[40:38] great-great-great-grandfather not
[40:39] actually I thought I came from this
[40:41] plant I come from this country and it
[40:43] goes back and it makes them feel happy
[40:44] or makes them fine kind of like a sound
[40:46] like a son that didn't know his father a
[40:49] daughter didn't know his father and
[40:50] they'll have these shows on TV where
[40:52] they'll have a a reunion they're gonna
[40:54] see their true father after 30 35 40
[40:56] years old they're gonna for the first
[40:58] time see their true father by the DNA
[41:00] testing by the by the testing they do in
[41:02] science and so it's a great union and a
[41:05] lot of times it reek brings a lot of
[41:06] peace to that person who's tried to
[41:09] figure themselves out their whole life
[41:13] looking at their adopted father and
[41:16] mother and trying to say I don't look
[41:17] like that why do I act this way they're
[41:19] not me they're not my blood I love them
[41:21] they're my surrogate father mother but
[41:24] but but they're but they're who am I
[41:26] like where did my traits come from can
[41:29] you say mine and a lot of times that
[41:31] Jesus you know Jesus felt the same way
[41:34] he looked over one day and he's looking
[41:36] in the mirror he looks over at his mom
[41:38] he's looking at his face look at his
[41:41] features looks at his mom's doing man I
[41:43] don't know I don't look like that very
[41:45] much
[41:45] looks over his dad I you know I don't
[41:48] look that hood and begin to wonder
[41:49] himself Who am I where did I come from
[41:51] something's odd here something strange
[41:53] and even though she was the incubator
[41:55] can you say man Joseph had nothing to do
[41:57] with it
[41:59] but these people get on these shows and
[42:01] all of a sudden when they meet and they
[42:02] spend a few days with
[42:04] their true father this is test their
[42:07] testimony a piece settles in their life
[42:10] because now I know really where I came
[42:13] from
[42:13] I'm telling you that's a spiritual
[42:15] meaning to it for the hour that we're in
[42:19] right now this isn't just the
[42:21] Pentecostal blessing friends this isn't
[42:23] just an external identification of a
[42:25] Christian this is a search spiritually
[42:30] the seals are the seals is a spiritual
[42:34] exploration of the DNA of the church so
[42:44] the other one that came up a few months
[42:46] ago is this place called 23andme okay
[42:55] science fulfilling man's hunger to be to
[42:57] get it you are and they say on this
[42:59] website you are made of cells and the
[43:01] cells in your body have 23 pairs of
[43:03] chromosomes zomes your chromosomes are
[43:06] made of DNA which can tell you a lot
[43:07] about you
[43:08] explore your 23 pairs today find out
[43:12] what your 23 pairs of chromosomes can
[43:14] tell you 23andme offers two personal
[43:17] genetic services health and and ancestry
[43:21] and then just ancestors you can pay for
[43:23] however much it is and you can do
[43:25] healthy can you imagine now listeni and
[43:27] this I read this on the radio there
[43:28] they're taking these things and they're
[43:30] finding out their individual health
[43:32] weaknesses their health
[43:35] Bent's that that they have to watch out
[43:38] for and they're not doing it by a doctor
[43:40] looking externally at symptoms anymore
[43:42] they're doing it from the DNA it could
[43:46] preach another our friends can you say
[43:48] man the word has been open to us the
[43:51] book of redemption has been open the
[43:53] seven seals have been taken off and the
[43:54] bride is learning her true spiritual DNA
[43:59] we're learning what sons of God didn't
[44:01] say in Romans that were in the day when
[44:03] the manifestation of the sons of God
[44:05] will take but all creation is waiting
[44:07] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[44:10] amen that's why I say that when Jesus
[44:13] our kinsmen took the book another son
[44:15] took the book back that our first son
[44:18] our first father Adam lost and when he
[44:20] fell we all fell with him
[44:22] does everybody understand when Adam fell
[44:24] we all felt with them that was the first
[44:26] Adam how many know there was a second
[44:27] Adam how many know there's our first Eve
[44:30] she found by the word she fell away from
[44:32] the word but if there's a second Adam
[44:35] there has to be a second Eve can you say
[44:38] man and our second Adam Jesus Christ
[44:41] he's our kinsman and he emerged into
[44:42] this this vision of John and he has the
[44:45] book of redemption in his hands and he
[44:51] begins to break the seals off and it
[44:52] begins to show our true identity and a
[44:54] so the sons of God can see who they
[44:56] really are from the foundation of the
[44:58] world and begin to rejoice in it can you
[45:00] say man he said ancestry services in
[45:04] house services proofs gives insight on
[45:06] your genetic health risk carrier status
[45:09] traits wellness and ancestry we analyze
[45:12] compiled and distill the information
[45:13] extracted from your DNA into 125 plus
[45:16] reports about you and you can access
[45:19] them online and share with your family
[45:21] and friends our ancestry service helps
[45:22] you understand who you are where your
[45:24] DNA comes from your family story we
[45:26] analyze compound distill your DNA
[45:28] information into reports on your
[45:29] ancestry composition ancestry detail
[45:32] reports maternal and paternal whatever
[45:35] that word is and whatever that next word
[45:40] is your DNA family and provided DNA
[45:43] relatives tool your DNA family and can
[45:46] provide a DNA relatives tool to enable
[45:48] you to connect with relatives who share
[45:51] the similar DNA praise be to God what we
[45:59] all here for how in the world do you get
[46:03] a group of people that have come so many
[46:04] different backgrounds sitting here this
[46:07] morning worshiping together
[46:08] brothers and sisters because he's
[46:11] revealed our true DNA and it brings our
[46:14] true family members together praise be
[46:17] to God that's why you're here you're not
[46:21] here for church you're gathering with
[46:23] your family here blood family can you
[46:27] say me you're discovering who you are
[46:30] can you say man no wonder it's a
[46:33] rejoicing no mother it's a joy like the
[46:35] prodigal son hey I'm going back to my
[46:38] father because that's who my identity is
[46:41] blessed be his name
[46:44] we're in so what hell that's just
[46:46] wonderful so their yarn science and here
[46:48] we are spiritually when the seven seals
[46:50] were open I'm wrapping up now I promise
[46:52] you when the seven seals were opened it
[46:55] reveals our spiritual identity why now
[46:57] why did you do it in the last days
[46:59] because it's time for the manifestation
[47:01] of the sons of God all creation is
[47:03] groaning for the manifestation of the
[47:05] sons of God why to get back to the sons
[47:08] with the title deed in their hand again
[47:11] you say now here's what I want you to
[47:13] catch we were saved and we were we knew
[47:15] we were forgiven 2,000 years ago by
[47:17] Christ who went to the cow our land went
[47:20] to Calvary and he paid the price to
[47:23] redeem us back that's all he did you say
[47:26] man and that's fine we rejoice in that
[47:29] most of Christianity today in their
[47:31] churches celebrate Calvary and the
[47:35] forgiveness of sins but they only go
[47:38] that far but they haven't read their
[47:40] Bible close enough to realize at the end
[47:42] time under the seventh angel revelations
[47:45] 10-7 there'll be a the mysteries of God
[47:48] should be finished and we have our lamb
[47:52] and revelations 5 he's done with Calvary
[47:56] 2,000 years or worse yet sitting at the
[47:58] right hand of authority of the Father
[48:01] there's a movement and he steps forth so
[48:06] now remember what I said the first Adam
[48:08] because it is him and he's because their
[48:10] fault we all fell so if that can happen
[48:13] that way then when our kinsman our
[48:16] brother second Adam takes this book and
[48:19] he has it in his hands
[48:21] if we all fell by our first Adam we're
[48:24] all beginning to rise by the second Adam
[48:26] but we're not just forgiven by Calvary
[48:29] we're taking the full possession back
[48:32] God's gonna give it fully back to his
[48:34] son all right I'm gonna end on this
[48:37] example when to quit I said much more
[48:39] there say for example the LaFontaine
[48:43] family here there's about 22 23 24 of us
[48:46] say we had a piece of land and we all
[48:48] lived on it say we all went in debt and
[48:51] we all went to jail all of us we lost
[48:55] our land lost our possession it was sold
[48:57] and given giving back and it was just in
[49:01] a place and we all were in jail
[49:04] because of the debt okay Isaac is the
[49:07] only one who survived it he didn't go to
[49:09] jail Ickes my brother if you don't know
[49:12] Isaac's my brother he's up here playing
[49:15] the organ
[49:16] so we're all in jail we're just waiting
[49:18] okay
[49:19] so then because I guess the one who's
[49:21] able to do it Eike Eike wins the lottery
[49:27] and he has the money to go and bail us
[49:31] out and pay the price so he goes to the
[49:33] pawn shop as it were he goes to the city
[49:35] he goes to this and say now listen this
[49:38] is this land was owned by our family
[49:40] okay
[49:40] I'm their brother and I have the I can
[49:43] pay the price they can't pay it but I'm
[49:45] paying the price right now are you
[49:47] children young people listen to me I'm
[49:49] explaining revelations five to you all
[49:52] all your children all the children they
[49:54] owned this all that all all the family
[49:57] owns that but I'm here because I'm able
[49:58] and I'm paying the price right now but
[50:00] for some reason Isaac he pays the price
[50:03] but he doesn't get the deed he leaves
[50:04] okay so now when he comes back and gets
[50:07] his cellphone and calls us while we're
[50:09] in jail we start to pass the phone
[50:11] around we're pretty excited because the
[50:13] price has been paid our redemption has
[50:17] been paid that's that's quite a
[50:19] rejoicing that's one of the first things
[50:23] I believe our needs are recognized can
[50:24] you say mine you don't pray the price
[50:27] for your own sins you don't pay the
[50:29] price for your mistakes you don't do
[50:31] penance for your mistakes
[50:34] Jesus either paid it off or he didn't
[50:36] pay any of it he paid it all every
[50:38] mistake you made every sin that you were
[50:40] born with sin that you were born with
[50:42] and everything that you've committed
[50:44] came on that cross that day and he took
[50:47] and paid the price for it
[50:50] that's what makes us live reverent
[50:52] before the Lord but we're all rejoicing
[50:55] we're having a good time but there's
[50:56] still a bit of hesitancy in our heart
[50:58] because we don't have our land back and
[51:00] we haven't been delivered out of jail
[51:02] yet we're basically still held up in
[51:06] jail and so you can rejoice over your
[51:09] price being paid it's the potential but
[51:11] the finish of redemption is not
[51:13] completed yet can you say Amen
[51:17] so now I I goes and he's already paid
[51:22] the price and he walks into that place
[51:24] and he shows his receipt for paying the
[51:27] price which in this case it was Jesus in
[51:29] his blood he shows I paid my blood for
[51:31] this we I paid the price of blood and so
[51:33] when he shows the receipt the guy goes
[51:35] back in the file and he gets the entire
[51:38] possession of the land everything is set
[51:41] free everything and he brings that paper
[51:43] out the title deed to ownership to it
[51:46] and he hands that to Ike and Ike has
[51:48] that catch this now
[51:51] catch this it's not in the hands of the
[51:52] city anymore it's not in the hand of the
[51:57] enemy anymore the ownership and the
[52:01] title deed is in the hands of my brother
[52:06] hallelujah it's not in some file it's
[52:10] not there anymore it's changed I'm
[52:13] preaching what has happened in the last
[52:15] days according to revelations 10 and
[52:18] according resolutions 5 were not in the
[52:20] age of the seven churches anymore we're
[52:22] in the last days when the mission should
[52:24] be finished and what's the ministry to
[52:26] reconcile all sons back to their full
[52:29] possession and the first thing that had
[52:32] to happen in the last days as the seals
[52:34] had to be ripped off of the book of
[52:36] Redemption and now he throws it to his
[52:38] prophet on earth and he begins to reveal
[52:40] these things so the identity so you can
[52:42] see your name in the book and so my
[52:44] brother Ike he gets his cell phone
[52:45] matter of fact we call him
[52:47] we heard he was going down there to pick
[52:48] up the title deed and we call him on his
[52:50] cell phone and say I I what did you do
[52:54] he said I went in I show my receipt I've
[52:56] got it you've got it
[52:58] I've got it you got it Ike kind of like
[53:02] what I call him when he's at the Music
[53:04] Store did you get it I got it did you
[53:07] get it can you got it I've got it guys
[53:11] guys
[53:13] the Fontaine's where they add guys he's
[53:17] got it in his hand our brother has the
[53:19] ownership in his hand our kinsman has
[53:22] the ownership in his hands so whether
[53:25] we're completely out of jail or not it
[53:27] doesn't matter it's gonna happen real
[53:29] soon now cuz our brother Jesus Christ
[53:33] our kinsman today has the book of
[53:37] redemption in his hands
[53:40] we're in a different hour we're not in a
[53:44] denominational time it's a different day
[53:47] God has blessed us I'm sure you got a
[53:50] dyke like where you at where are you at
[53:53] he's not even here call me where you at
[53:55] shoulda brought my phone Mike do you
[53:57] have it I got it so I passed the phone
[54:00] around to the whole family because they
[54:01] have to hear that he has the title deed
[54:03] got it I got it
[54:05] got it where we had like in the bathroom
[54:09] okay you've been here what I've been
[54:14] saying you do do you got it you got the
[54:16] title deed you got it
[54:18] you sure you got it is it in your hand
[54:21] it's in your hand
[54:25] I don't think he knows what I'm talking
[54:27] about does he's in the bathroom you
[54:33] think you think we're gonna be happy in
[54:34] jail I think we're gonna get cited and
[54:39] then he begins to make the movement
[54:41] brings the title deed up too we see our
[54:44] names in that I my name's on the deed my
[54:46] name's on the possession jailer comes
[54:49] and says is that your name that's my
[54:50] name it's me it's my true identity
[54:54] it's my possession it's mine
[54:57] opens up the jail door walk out of there
[55:01] free man
[55:02] tell Fontaine family's got you happy
[55:06] family lafawn days are gonna sing a
[55:08] little bit been singing for 50 years but
[55:11] no sing is gonna come like this I think
[55:15] they ought to come and sing right now so
[55:17] I can quit preaching come on come on the
[55:20] Fontaine family I just told you you're
[55:23] rich I know a lot of you think you're
[55:25] not rich but you are as sons and
[55:27] daughters of God your spiritual
[55:32] millionaires this morning I'm talking to
[55:35] you all now as sons and daughters of God
[55:38] your spiritual millionaires this
[55:41] raptures as good as in the bag it's as
[55:44] good as done because why my kinsmen my
[55:47] kinsmen has the book of redemption in
[55:50] his hands have you recognized your true
[55:53] identity have you recognized who you are
[55:57] have you recognized who the prodigal
[56:00] sons are brother loyal it's those that
[56:04] are recognize your identity you know
[56:05] it's beautiful about that story is that
[56:07] he didn't come through in a 10-step
[56:09] seminar on how to work his way back to a
[56:11] son he already was a son and you know
[56:15] the moment he changed you know the
[56:17] moment the real change we think well
[56:19] it's when he come back and repented or
[56:21] he said when he come back and got the
[56:22] robe on no no the moment he changes when
[56:24] he said is when he said somebody help me
[56:31] out
[56:34] he came to himself I just came to myself
[56:38] trying to remember that the change
[56:40] happened I mean remember the story that
[56:42] brother Branham told one time of the
[56:43] used car dealer and the used car dealer
[56:46] was a center he doesn't didn't serve God
[56:48] his wife did he went not she went to all
[56:49] these conventions everything but he what
[56:51] he didn't care about God anything so he
[56:52] reaches one day he's working as a used
[56:54] car salesman which is usually isn't this
[56:56] little shady anyway but uh he picks up
[57:01] this track somebody threw it in the
[57:03] trash and he picks this track so where
[57:05] were you spend eternity here some some
[57:07] little track from whatever and so he
[57:09] starts to read through this and read the
[57:11] scriptures and something happens in him
[57:14] and he recognizes his need for God he
[57:18] turns his life right there okay so now
[57:21] what happened with him is that he went
[57:23] to his wife she said you need to come to
[57:25] the convention story you got to get this
[57:26] so they went to a Billy Graham they went
[57:28] to different conventions not Pentecostal
[57:30] ones they different different
[57:31] conventions and he was searching for and
[57:33] I got to get this I gotta get something
[57:34] he says whenever I went he told this to
[57:36] brother bream says whenever he says I
[57:38] tried to get something I couldn't get it
[57:39] then he goes to the Pentecostal
[57:40] conventions and he had people
[57:42] prophesying over him and different
[57:44] things and all these different things
[57:45] going on and and so now then then they
[57:48] go to all these conventions and he goes
[57:49] to all Roberts and our Robert says you
[57:51] mean you can get it you get it speak
[57:52] speaking tongues and tried to teach him
[57:54] to speak in tongues hello hello you're
[57:59] not to teach somebody's speaking Tony's
[58:02] the Holy Ghost does his work but you see
[58:06] he's searching for something and we came
[58:08] to brother Brandon brother Brent says
[58:10] you know what you know when your change
[58:12] took place you said you don't need to
[58:13] keep searching when you read that tract
[58:16] your heart changed right there you got
[58:20] your you got what you needed right there
[58:21] now you just need to grow in the Lord
[58:24] and that's what happened to the prodigal
[58:26] he recognized I'm not this I'm a son of
[58:31] God and to the father that's all that
[58:34] needed to happen can you say man can we
[58:38] stand together
[58:39] are we happy that other preachers
[58:41] getting done here what are we singing
[58:44] guys to hopefully I priests over you can
[58:46] think of a song
