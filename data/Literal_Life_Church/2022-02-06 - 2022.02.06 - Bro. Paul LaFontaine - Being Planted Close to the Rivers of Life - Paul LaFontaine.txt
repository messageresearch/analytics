TRANSCRIPT
========================================
psalms 1 1-3 this morning as we talk about verse 3 a little bit and may the lord bless and anoint his word for our lives this morning each of us have needs each of us have places that we're in in our in our walk with the lord and god is sensitive to where we're at and has the word to be able to take us on to know him in a deeper way so we're thankful for that we trust in that and uh i love him so much this morning i appreciate his grace in our lives amen psalms chapter 1 and verse 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful so this man has distanced himself and and got away from all of these influences and he does it for a purpose and he's blessed by doing it he moves himself away from all of these influences intentionally and then verse two his delight is in the law of the lord because all of us in life have to have a delight we have to have something that we're passionate about this blessed man his delight is in the word his delight is in the presence of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night which we derived our series on our thought life may continue with that a little bit wednesday night but he's he's not just wanting to be in in the word but he's wanting to meditate upon it and he's wanting it to be the dominant thing in his thought life verse 3 and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper so the very end of this is seeing a believer a blessed man in this position and he is his leave shall not his he shall not wither and whatever he doeth shall prosper that's such a blessing to see this blessed man of god and all of it goes back to where he is planted where he's positioned and this message has taught us that we must be positioned in jesus christ we must find our position in the word of god for the age we live in because there's power in position there's flourishing in our position when we step out of our position that thing that's when things begin to fall apart but being planted and rooted in the right place brings this his leaf shall not die and everything he doeth shall prosper i'll tell you i want to be planted wherever that is at amen heavenly father bless your word today and bless each soul that we have lord not under my care as such but they're under your care every soul that's here every soul that's listening in they're under your care this morning and i pray father you'll just as they're on the potter's wheel that you tenderly with your hands mold them and make them lord into your perfect image and to your likeness lord and each time we meet together your word gives us another step another line upon line another another place that we can look at by revelation and see that's where i want to be that's where i want to walk i pray the word would be encouraging to every heart every age group this morning as we commit this service to you and feel your presences here may you do your work we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen i want you to shake somebody's hand before you're seated there and god bless you for coming this morning now we want to take a look at the word of god and take this section here verse 3 and i'd like to title this planted close to the rivers of life being planted very very close to the rivers of life planted close to the rivers of life believers how many know that believers are predestinated we have learned through the word of god and one of the truths that has been restored and the balance of that truth has come to us through the message of the hour and to take us back to biblical truth that believers are predestinated before the foundation of the world and it's not that you just came to an altar one night but god in his mind predestinated all believers he knew what choice would be made and he knew and so thus he predestinated you to be conformed to his image we know that but i want to look at today that they the believers are not only predestinated but believers have a predestinated place where they belong as well not only does god predestinate them but they have a predestinated place where they belong they have a predestinated place that they are planted in every age and god knew in his mind god knew you in his mind and you were what we refer to in the last days you were a seed of god how many knows that the believers are not only predestined but they're a seed of god and this understanding came to us as we realize that jesus towards the end of his ministry began to lay out the truth of the seed doctrine and he began to talk about seeds falling into different places he began to talk lay out this thing and it was towards the end of the prophet's ministry that he began to lay out in 64 and 65 so many themes that talked about that you're a seed of god if you're a son of god you always were before the foundation of the world all of my children were inside of me before i was married but it took the betting ground of marriage for my sons that i can fellowship with my two sons and my two daughters this morning because of the betting ground but they were always inside of me in seed form in cell form can you say man if that is true in the natural that it is certainly true in the spiritual that the reason you can say amen to the word of god today the reason you love him and want to worship him the reason that your heart says amen to the word of god is not because you mechanically or intellectually come up with that something is inside you but it's before the foundation of the world there's no way you could say amen to it or believe it or receive the new birth unless you were there with him from the beginning in his thoughts and so we have this term you're a seed of god if you are a true christian you're you were one in god's mind before you were one of those christians you were one of those believers in god's mind before the world was formed but that seed also if we're a seed of god it also has a place because a seed has to have a place to be planted a seed if we're a seed of god how many would raise your hands i believe i'm a seed of god but a seed has to have a bedding ground a seed has to be planted and so we we see a truth unfolding here not just that we are a seed of god but that a seed has to be planted and he predestinated the hour that we live in the time that you would live in that you would be a seed of god during a certain time and you would be planted in a certain age you could have been born in any age but he predestinated the age that you were born in and you would be planted in that age and not just planted in an age you would be planted in the word that would come forth in that age that's where you would be planted because in the word christ is the word christ is the revealed word of every age and when that word comes forth in that age that's the place that you're planted in so your place is predestinated as well he has a word for every generation he has and if he has a word for every generation your position would be planted in that word there's only one place then that that seed of god can thrive we read about a tree here that's planted in the right place besides the rivers of water and it is only in that predestinated planted place that the seed will grow and the seed will thrive it reminds me of brother brahms saying that israel and he refers to a scripture i can't think of it just now but he refers to israel being planted and being in egypt then god brings them out and brother brahma says israel was a good vine but she was planted in the wrong place in egypt so all the potential of the people of god they were god's people all the potential that laid in you it's all there but israel was planted in the it would never thrive in egypt it would never work in egypt oh but i'm a child of god i'll be i'll be fine here in egypt and actually a lot of them wanted to go back after they come out of it but not true believers joshua and caleb said no i don't belong planted in egypt i don't belong planted back there god gave me a promised land to live in and israel was a good vine but she was planted in the wrong place once she got planted in her predestinated place then she began to thrive and this is true of your life you can be a seed of god but planted in the wrong place that's why we say there are many fine christians and many christians that i believe we never speak against people and what god has in their lives we speak against the systems of denominations but brother brahm says not the people there's good people in there and there actually is some still called to come out of that can you say man i'm speaking to you if you're listening to me there's a call in the end time to come out of her my people to come out of babylon and i say if you hear that voice don't wait any longer come out of that system because you can never thrive spiritually under a system of denomination but the people he says are good people so we never criticize what god's done in their life we never want to do that because some people are just planted in the wrong place might as well go ahead and say it that some people are planted in the wrong church even within our own ranks and they're not thriving because they're planted in the wrong place i don't want to just talk about just churches and what church this is much deeper than just what church you belong to or go to this is being planted in the word of god in the balanced word of god in the full gospel in the full unrestricted gospel with no denominational taints to it that's where a believer belongs you got a message influence but it's still a denominational approach to everything you're not going to thrive in that and if you don't think we have denomination creeping into some messes churches i'm telling you you might as be honest there's some they come from the baptist background and their church has become a message baptist church there's some that come from a pentecostal background and that pentecostal tradition and influence is influencing them that they're a pentecostal message church we are called out of all of those systems to come to the light of this word and we are to die to traditions of pentecost we are to die to traditions of baptists and methodists that tree is to be pruned of all those denominational things there's one place that a seed will throw thrive excuse me revive there's one place a seed will thrive and the scripture tells us it's close to the water now water in the bible represents life water represents life and this tree is planted close to the source of life i want you to notice it's wording now in your bible uh psalms one and three i want you to notice how it's worded if you would it is worded that it says and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers plural of water singular so though there be many streams and many rivers and brother brown referred to the nine spiritual gifts and he referred to all the different diversity but but you see now it may be many rivers but it's one water it's receiving from one source so don't ever get in your idea that there's a lot of different waters and a lot of different denominations there's a lot of different sources for life there is only one source for life there's only one water it's a singular water can you say amen and though there be many rivers there is one source for spiritual life it's not in any it's not in many sources there's one source for life and that's in the word of god for your age christ the revealed word for the age one source and it doesn't come from other sources god provides in that age one source so this tree is planted close to the source of life a seed of god will never belong in another source but christ the word the word for the age in the word for the age is the source of life his seed will be planted there and that's the only place it can thrive the potentials in a seed will never produce in the wrong atmosphere or the wrong environment never that's why he also predestinated which is i'm what i'm presenting here this morning he also presented he not he not just predestinated the seed but he predestined the right environment in every age for the seed to grow into a tree planted so close to the life source that the roots would go down very very deep see that's what god wants in your life he wants you planted in the right place so that your roots can go way deep deep deep down and grow and this tree is planted so close to the life source that the roots go down and are permanently connected close and are connected to the moisture provided by the water of life now i i'll let you apply that to yourself because we position ourselves we we we make decisions of whether to plant our lives close to this word or far away we make those decisions god provides the place but if you keep bucking up against it you're going to find you're not going to come to your full potential but here's a brother that had been planted close to the source of life and his roots go down deep and it's so connected to the moisture in that water from that river because things grow where the river's flowing oh i want to stay there don't you everything grows where the river flows is the name of the the lyric in the song everything grows where the river flows he's right there and his roots are so close that it's it's it's sucking in the moisture that comes from being close to that river now the prophet goes on to israel complaining when they got away from water in the wilderness and they all of a sudden being out in the desert and he refers to the cactus and plants that are in the desert most of them are all sticky if you get on the ground in the desert he says you get all sticky because they're pokey and and it's because they don't hardly receive any water you see sometimes you take the same plant you put it in a different thing where there's a lot of water that stickiness goes away and then he refers to people becoming murmurs complaining sticky feelings on their shoulders and it's it's a dead giveaway to a person and their attitude and their spirit and how their anger is controlled all those other things it's a dead giveaway to where you've planted yourself spiritually because there's no way you can be sticky like that to everybody and be living close to the waters of life because if you're close to the waters of life it softens you it makes you gentle that's why brother tony i like the scripture excuse me the quote back early on where brother brahma says and i quote it often because it's so simple but it's so profound i'd like to proclaim it in every seminary in this world that's trying to learn the bible he says that the only way to be led by the spirit of god is to be gentle and not to know a whole lot and i'd like to read that in every seminar in this world the only way to be led by the spirit of god is to be gentle and not know a whole lot the waters of life make you softer and gentle without it you get hard all right i'll get back to my notes you know when i walk down there it's going to get more practical it seems like you'll get a lot of amens in that section but you know what you plant yourself by the waters of life it's going to be a different result and your different result in your attitude every day you don't get hard when you're close to the lord when you're close to his waters you don't hold grudges against people for years when you're close to the water you don't keep on with your bitterness when you're close to the water it all gets washed away praise the lord so one thing that i learned in my research here is that there are stages to a seed or should i say there's stages to a tree and because this is referred to a tree and in a minute i'll get to that we are typed the bible as trees that's why david says it you you may be a seed but you see now there are stages to a seed you may be a seed and maybe you have said that i'm a seed of god praise the lord and you've even sung about it in conventions for years i'm a seed of the lord i'm a seed of god but you see now a seed really doesn't bear fruit in seed form so you can sing about and you can proclaim all you want to i'm a seed of god brother praise the lord glory be to god i'm a seed of god why don't we have people rejoicing and saying i'm moving moving beyond i'm a seed of god that i've become a tree planted by the rivers of living water and i can see the fruit bearing in my life let's have a convention about the trees of god praise the lord the seed doesn't bear fruit it it has the potential to all the potential is in it but you see now there are stages to a seed and that's why that's why god not only predestinates the seed but god watches over the seed god cares for the seed there are predestinated stages there are predestinated trials in your life you know we didn't hear that term until we were taught by the prophet that even our trials god allows certain things for a seed of god and they are predestinated trials joseph's brother selling him and putting him in a pit and all that thing that happened it was only at the end that god could look at the he could show him the vision of his life and realize his life was predestinated his position was predestinated but his trials were predestinated as well to get him in that right position somebody say amen this morning that's when we grow up and it wasn't until the end that joseph could say to his brothers you're intending for me to kill you for what you did but i can't do that because i'm standing here with a revelation that the tender hand of jehovah i said the tender hand of jehovah what you did in evil god has worked it out to good so a seed a seed has to be put in a place and cast to come through stages and it is watched over and then it's god's cares for and there's a predestinated place for it to be right in his presence and so now let me just take a little bit of the stages here and in my feeble way i realize i have people in my congregation that plant things and love to plant things and their green thumbs i'm not a green thumb my daughter i bought her a a uh mri i brought her a book for christmas because she wants to do learn more about planning she's really good at it already and so but wait we have experts here in this church and so you can imagine the position i feel in talking about plant life and all these other things but uh you correct me if i'm wrong but a seed a tree seed especially has goes through stages and and the there's a predestinated place for a seed of god to be in the right presence to first be germatized because the first thing that happens to a seed it is germatized and to be dramatized by the holy ghost it's to be put in the right atmosphere and if that seed is not dramatized it's never going to grow it's never going to fulfill anything it's never going to come to its full potential and i'll say that this morning you young people everyone else i don't say it to put pressure on you i say it to make you seek god you can never go anywhere intellectually with this you have to be born again and baptized by the holy ghost there is no psychology that can bring you into an overcoming life it takes a birth and a german tizing of that seed on the inside and that's when you begin to pray god god fill me with the holy ghost i need the holy ghost in my life i need this that i've been feeling all my life i need it to be dramatized and when it's germatized something happens to it and it begins to break out of the seed and it begins to grow from that point on because it's been dramatized from what i've heard there's actually three stages in the being germatized there's three changes to being germatized i didn't realize this and you can read about them but there's three sages and i said that's perfect because he says water blood and spirit is what brings the new birth so a seed has three stages even to the german dermatizing and so now three stages even to be dermatized water blood and spirit we have to be dramatized by the holy ghost the seed has to be germatized we're not interested in a denominational experience we're not interested in a message put it putting on we're not interested in intellectually doing all the right things and wearing all the right clothes intellectually if you do it out of respect i believe god will bless you for it thank you for it because it is god's pattern but we're not interested in you stopping there in just an intellectual receiving of this message coming to church and putting this on because you grew up in it is not what we're interested in there is a dramatizing of the seed that's inside of you that comes by only an experience of the holy ghost in your life dad mom can't give it to you i can't give it to you it's when you begin to get desperate and say god i need this more than anything else in my life it's not just giving your heart to the lord you may do that but this is a new birth that's a change of your desires on the inside but i want you to know about the german germatizing stage that it happens underground we can't see when a seed is germatized so what are all these pentecostal influences that make it such a public show where now sudden we know the person has been baptized by the holy ghost by what we see really in nature you don't see when it's dramatized jesus said he said the war the wind blow it where it listeneth and you hear the sound but you can't tell when it comes and goes so is everyone that's born of the spirit jesus said we don't see this part but when it happens it's real why are we trying to make it such a visible thing is i know that person's been baptized by the holy ghost because they shouted and they danced all over the building we don't know that until we see the fruit that comes from their lives and i believe in shouting i believe in dancing i believe when the spirit comes through i don't think you should sit there like a bump in the log i think the holy spirit makes us cry and weep and worship and open our hearts you do it at a ball game why can't you do it in here i believe in shouting but because a person shouts because the atmosphere is charged with the holy spirit doesn't mean a person's getting a new birth let's see this thing brother tony's underground when the dramatizing of the seed happens it's not visible when god put his seed in mary there was no sensation nobody seen it and yet the son of god was was the cell began forming and nobody's seen it and she didn't feel anything it was the holy ghost without sensation one of the mysteries that's been revealed particularly under the pentecostal traditions one of the mysteries is to receive the holy ghost without a sensation without a feeling we are birthed by the word of god incorruptable not by a feeling not by a sensation not by just the local evangelist that comes through that creates an atmosphere i understand that for a new birth but unless that heart is you you say i need a change there's not much of a change taking place there it says underground the stages that's going on underground and and so so then from that then we find uh then it shoots up the next stage of the seed is it shoots up into a little blade and it's actually called a shoot it's called a chute because it shoots up and it's just a little blade that comes up through the ground amen and so and then when it shoots up and it's a chute then we have what they call a seedling it's not a seed anymore it's a seedling i might start becoming a green thumb ma'am i might be down helping you in the garden this year she's been asking for help for years and now they're done with all that they buy it at the store like me now it's a lot easier a seedling is a very young tree notice it's been germatized but it's a very young tree perhaps one or two years old that has been grown from seed in a tree nursery and transplanted to the area where the new forest will emerge so this is another stage a seedling stage now some some steeds get spread and you know there's different areas where they get spread but in our world and in this generation the seedling is a very young tree and it's it's planted in a in in the environment of a tree nursery and it's tre then it's transplanted to the area where the new forest will emerge seeds serve several function for the plants that produce them key among them of these functions of the of this nursery or this functions of the this this seedling time three key functions nourishment of the embryo dispersal to the new location and dormancy during unfavorable conditions and i want you to notice now dormancy under unfavorable conditions in other words dormancy is is you could reword it like it slows things down a little bit because of the harsh conditions or because unfavorable conditions it wants to ensure that this seed gets a good start and so if there's unfavorable conditions this this is the the work now that takes place a dormancy it may slow things down a little bit because of the conditions but nevertheless we see that this is a stage and so i want to say to you that god in his caring gentle nature especially when a seed has been germatized god the great nursery director is going to watch over this seedling god is going to nourish this seedling the word nourishes in the bible we are to be called to nourish things the husband is supposed to nourish his wife in spiritual things can i get an amen from the brothers nourishing her and cherishing her so in this work god is god is watching over us he knows what we need and even though uh its unfavorable conditions he cared and watched us he nourished us uh show that uh slide of the seedling while i'm talking about it even though there's unfavorable conditions he cares over us he watches over us he nourishes us and the the prophet said we must bear with the weak until they are strong you guys have that seedling picture there he said we must bear with the weak until they are strong now it has all the potential to be strong but there's a process there's a there's stages that it goes through it's not been planted it has been planted but it hasn't been planted in the final predestinated place yet and so because of that we see that it has to be nourished god has to care over it and that's why we have this theme the prophet saying we must bear with the weak until they are strong how many will agree with me that when you start out you have all the potential to be strong but there's a lot of christians that are that are weak and need to become strong then you have the prophet preaching perfect strength through perfect weakness this is a strange title to preach amongst pentecostals because we're always professing pentecost is always professing how strong we are and now i'm going to take a sermon on weakness and show you that when you're weak he becomes stronger that's when we learn our dependence on him that's the truth none of the pentecostals we're talking about strong it's always about the boldness and the davids and i'm i'm not against any of that preaching we need that to build faith but don't ever forget that sometimes in your weaknesses paul sought the lord three times about something and he realized through this weakness god is made stronger god has a strength coming in your life that is something different than the way you see it's going to happen and so even a seed of god is seedling god cares for that because he wants to take it through certain things and there's conditions that would be too harsh to you i couldn't find the scripture last night but there's one place god refers to the children of israel we know for 40 years they were in the wilderness and didn't go in the promised land they could have with him within three days but they stayed there but one reason is not just because they didn't respect the prophet but one place god says god says and i'm just paraphrasing because i couldn't find this christian but it's in there trust me it's in there or i wouldn't be saying this but he referred to them being there and he sent him to an army and they got all down about having to fight this army and as god was saying you're not ready to fight this little army here then you're not ready to go against in the promised land you're not strong enough yet so god in his time was getting used to this stuff so that they could become strong a seedling in this maybe nursery or wherever whatever it is god is watching over it because the conditions sometimes can be a little harsh but he wants to ensure ensure that you begin to get strong truly strong is that okay with everybody how many believe god's watching over your life even though there's unfavorable conditions somebody's had unfavorable conditions to your life how many has wondered whether why why the lord even called you sometimes trials you go through you wonder why the lord he called you but you're still here today and you realize god was watching over you through unfavorable conditions it's like i didn't know how i survived that but i'm here and i survived it by the grace of god because god's watching over his seedlings and so now then a tree i have to move on now then the tree goes from the seedling to the sapling and that's over three foot tall seedling is under three foot tall a sapling is over three feet tall and you see friends i just wanted to get to get to the point there's so much to this and it speaks of a son and daughter of god a seed of god they go through a lot under god's care all the time they're under god's care they go even after they're dermatized they go through stages can you say amen but they're under god's care so many ministers who sometimes speak of the seed of god they're preaching of its potential but quite often we don't hear a lot of preaching about the stages that a seed goes through amen and it's there's not a thing wrong with preaching you into your potential and preaching the potential and the power that lays within you and all the potentials if you're a seed of god you have all the power and potential to become a full-grown uh fruit-bearing tree for god you have all the potential there every apple that a tree will ever produce is in that little seed so we understand that but too often we preach and we preach the potentials of a seed but we don't preach the stages of a seed and so the expectations are way out here and somebody's saying oh and i'll never reach there but if you know you're a seed of god you can say i'm going to reach there i got it within me but lord what do you have to take me through to get me to that place lord i want to be planted by the river permanently the rest of my life what you got to do with me to get me there so so much of this speaks about the sons and daughters of god under god's care all the time so many ministers speaking of these things and i respect all ministries not speaking against anyone but sometimes we miss that it's speaking of the full mature son of god full adopted son of god now and i believe a minister even referred to it being you when you're when you're born again you're a full matured adopted fully matured son of god right then well potentially you are but there the adoption process is that you have the spirit of adoption when you're born again but now you go through a training time till you come to the full spectrum of adoption that's the way i believe it we must see the full potential it's fine to preach that way but we must also see that every seed goes through stages even after it's been germinated seedlings are not bearing a lot of fruit yet how many would agree with me that seedlings are not bearing a lot of fruit yet but it's in them it's in them but they're not bearing a lot of fruit if if none and according to our text god has a place for you to be planted you will never bring forth all that's in you until you have permanent and settled and planted in the right place none of this transplanting and going and moving around from place to place it doesn't work spiritually for a believer he has one place for you to settle down put your roots down be planted by the word of god and stay there for the rest of your life this you know how many has ever had brothers had your wife want you to go move a plant that's here and you're gonna dig it up and some of them are pretty big already but she wants you to dig it up because she thinks it belongs over here and i don't know why she's asking me okay brother mike thank you i feel better two okay there's three fourths oh can i get a witness can i have some more in this oh i feel so much better now i'm going to talk about it this is fine where it's at it's doing good and i'm not experienced enough to know to take this thing out brother tony and make sure that i get enough roots because if you don't get enough roots and you don't get that thing planted right over here that thing is going to die and that's why i'm nervous about doing and i've had some of them die and then i get blamed because they die it's terrible it's not fair but this uprooting i think it needs to be over here and replanted over here and if you did that a lot it gets weaker it's not god's intention for you to be uprooted and replanted and uprooted and replanted and uprooted it's not god's intention for a plant some of them survive some of them don't we're talking about the predestinated plan of god where to be planted he has a place for you his position for you and so when we grow in the lord we realize that he cares for this section but then he moves us on and it's and so that was my my theme to you this morning is that this brother and sister is planted close to the river of water rivers of water and he brings forth his fruit in his season this is all about spiritual man growing under the word of the age and the spirit of the age the holy spirit and growing until you become a fruit can you say amen the more you move it the more the weaker it becomes we don't need a lot of this planting and replanting and moving and uprooting and then planting notice you're not meant to stay a seedling or a sapling can i tell you that this morning you're not meant to say stay a seedling i don't preach i preach adoption i preach we're growing to adoption this is the age to adoption and every person in here and every person listening if you're a believer this is the age of adoption it's not the age to stay in our immaturities and our carnality it's the age to grow to fall matured believers bearing the fruit of this message bearing the fruits of the spirit every day that's why i preached because why you're not meant to stay as a seedling you're not meant to stay and brother branham refers to some places that they're hot bed plants and they have to be babied and pampered how many knows that i believe there's a care that the lord gives in a seedling stage but these hot bed plants he said they have to be pampered and babied and coaxed to come to church and coaxed to do this that's a hotbed plant he said a real thorough bed a real seed of god you put him in the right environment and something's going to come forth babied all the time should i go into it he's just a fat little baby he wants his bodily don't mean maybe wants to be pampered he wants to be coaxed everything careful of their feelings i'm looking for a church that's grown out of having their feelings on their shoulders and coming to church with their carnality and their minds on everybody else and the drama in the church i'm looking for maturity that somebody lays all those thoughts down and says i'm coming today for one reason i need the lord i'm coming to sing my songs and create an atmosphere where somebody can get a new birth somebody can be delivered amen instead of sitting down and say looking around oh yeah i knew that about them oh yeah okay get in come on get me going now got to be babied to come to church got to be cokes along got to walk on pins and needles so get that thing down walk on pins and needles so you don't offend anybody and if you're preaching with the love of god you'll never preach too hard for a seed of god if it's the word and love they want to hear it preach it none of this sugar-coating it and ignoring certain subjects like modesty and he said then if the world the word the lord leads me into a subject i'm going there that's right that's right and thankfully i have some here that said let's go there i'm ready to go with you if it takes the hide off my back let's go there by the holy spirit preach it in love don't come up here unless you've got it full of the love of god but don't ever stop preaching it because you can never preach the seed of god out somewhere to backslide you you can never do that this is the thing they want to hear hallelujah somebody say praise the lord amen and so now we see we notice you're not meant to stay a sibling you're not meant to see a sapling in those places your roots let me see a sapling with a tree it's almost four four three or four feet already and it's in that big canvas and that burlap sack or whatever it is and it's there it's just like you're going that can never reach its full potential it's meant to be planted somewhere and even it's grown up to four feet and it looks like some plants coming out no it's still not planted right it's got the big burlap sack around it and it's there in the nursery still it's like what are you doing still in the nursery you have to take that thing and put it where it's meant to be for the rest of its life to bring forth fruit amen buy that thing and take it plant it in its right way and that's god he doesn't let you sit around the church he wants to keep you as a sapling you say no no now now they're ready i'm going to plant them permanently by the wherevers of water the reason i don't buy those big saplings sometimes i don't get them because i can't afford them once they get that stage they want a lot of money for them but it's because the potential is there it's already you put in the right places seeing these things ready to go oh i love the word don't you i got to finish this up now god wants you to thrive god wants you to produce not a denominational life can you say man but the real fruits of the message of your day to see the beautiful fruits of the word in your life how many wants to see the beautiful fruits of the word in your life this is what in the natural this is what it this can turn to this as they bring the other ones there this can this can turn from a tree you have the other ones that can turn to this amen next one that can turn to this oh that's my favorite peaches right oh man anybody getting hungry look at that just just just coming out everywhere flourishing this is our life in the holy ghost planted in the right place this is what life is about it's not about your job your job is a sideshow your investment your retirement that's a sideshow this is what you're on in life for this is what you're in life for all the fruits of this message to be expressed to this world all the fruits of jesus christ to be thriving and blooming like this and and fresh and someone can take a bite of your life and the juices of god flow out of your life brother tony drips down your face and next one this is your life next one this is what this is what it's supposed to look like this is thriving the next one ah man next one ah i'm trying to cover all the bases here this morning it's not what it looks like as a seedling it's not what it looks like when it's germatized that's the potential what it becomes this is your life i don't care if you've been 30 years under the moping under some bitterness you're not meant to stay there is what you're supposed to look like do we have one more we don't that's too bad i'm getting hungry let me know that can you give me about 20 more minutes here how many know that trees in the bible are a type of man and the key scripture we have for that of course is psalms 1. man is typed as a tree like a tree planted by the rivers of water so now if we go back to the garden of eden if you turn to genesis 2 if you go back to the garden of eden you realize that you'll never understand what happens in the garden of eden until you see a tree as a person my denominational friend if you're listening today you'll never understand what happened in the garden unless you understand the symbolism that's in the book of genesis and you understand it not through the lens of your denomination and what you've been taught in sunday school but you understand it through revelation and what it really was because you begin to look at it and you realize if you don't understand that trees represent persons you're not going to understand what happened in the garden and genesis 2 said verse 8 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and so chapter 2 is about the garden now so chapter 1 he's created everything and all these other things but chapter 2 is about a garden chapter two is about a garden if we're in chapter two of the genesis of the beginnings you can pretty much see what's in god's mind that this is about planting a garden and the fruits coming from a garden that's right the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there put man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil now it's not me that made a distinction in all the other trees and then he made a distinction of the tree of life and treated all good evil god did that he just made a distinction when he uses the word and also he didn't have to do that he could if they're all literal trees he could have just said well all the trees and they'll all bring forth the fruit but he god made a distinction and if you don't by spiritual revelation catch that listen now he's talking about natural trees but he's also talking about spiritual trees and i'm going to prove this to you here by the bible this morning and and so now the trio life of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge good and evil notice the tree of life is in the midst of the garden it's not like the other trees it's in the midst of the garden and the river went also of eden to water the garden here's a river that we're preaching about this morning there's a river that went out of eden to water the garden blessed be the name of the lord it's all there the garden the trees and the river of life river went out of eden to water the garden and thence it was parted and became into four heads then the name of the first with pisces that is which is com compassed at the whole land of have yeah which there is gold so it goes into the names of the the rivers there and then verse 15. and the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it and the lord god commanded the man saying of every treat of the garden thou must eat freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in that day that thou eat us thereof that thou shalt surely die so that's that's you know if you're looking at literal trees now now wait a minute what's what's going on here what's the distinction because it it it you don't normally normally have that it's just if it's just a literal tree now there's a warning against eating of this you'll die and the lord god said it is not good that man should be alone i will make you help me for him and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam calls every living creature that was the same thereof and adam gave names to all the cattle to the fowl of the air to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found a helpmate for him and the lord god calls us steep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh there up so let's not talk about eve although i will say this all right in the same chapter that he talks about the garden literally is the woman coming from the man who is the female part who is the part that will bring forth fruit eve wasn't in the first chapter at least not in this form she's not in the third chapter she's not no when she's formed and god brings this female part she's the one that's going to bring forth fruit that's why brother branham preached the bride tree it's not christ is the tree of life it's not just that but there is a bride tree there's a second eve to come out of adam she's in the second chapter where the garden is oh somebody say praise the lord so for those of you who are listening you want me to prove that these two trees were not literal cheese but they're persons there's a mystery behind it and it's hidden in the parable jesus spoke in parables and if you didn't understand the parable what was behind it you're going to take it all literal a lot of times denominations said take it all literally take a lecture but we're supposed to have a spiritual life but we take everything in genesis and everything literally now you can't do that you have to have a revelation of what god's trying to say and in the garden of eden it's not all literal trees and so the first one he refers to is he says let me just get it now he says but also in the midst of the garden this tree of life now i'm here to present to you that those two trees are persons they're they're they're a being they're the tree of life is a person and the tree of knowledge of good and evil is a person i'm going to prove it chapter 3 and verse 8 and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day really oh there's a voice of god walking in the garden it isn't interesting he says there's a tree of life in the garden and now we have a further intimidation there's a voice of god in the garden so that tree is not a literal tree that's a person that's our lord speaking [Applause] so the tree of life is a person and they heard the voice of god walking in the garden of the cool day and adam and eve hid themselves from the what from the presence of the lord a god among the trees of the garden so among the trees of the garden is this person the tree of life now who's the tree of knowledge gonna be is that a person chapter 3 and verse 1 thou the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god hath made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the tree of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be god as gods knowing good and evil oh somebody's talking about good and evil and the tree in chapter 2 says it's a tree of knowledge of good and evil and now here's a here's a person talking through the creature of the serpent and what's his message if you take of this you'll know good and evil guess what this is the tree of knowledge of good and evil talking and the scripture bears witness of that that was a little serpent seed 101. amen scripture proves itself friends this is a restored truth in the bible but then eve is in chapter two so the trees are there's a mystery behind the trees but even two and eve has a mystery behind her because she's the mystery of the bride tree that there be a bride tree come out of christ then out of calvary there'll be a bride come out of christ eve was the female part and naturally even eve she's in chapter two naturally what should will she do she will bring forth fruit that will be her purpose it's said of mary i i think her cousin said blessed now blessed art thou among women blessed is the fruit of thy womb to bear fruit naturally but this is speaking of the second eve the bride tree spiritually and what are we supposed to do bear the fruit of christ and then if you jump over here with me to john 15. maybe you guys can bring it up in the back john 15 verse 1. then we're going to read it off the screen john 15 is where jesus picks it up and he says he goes so far as to say i am the true vine and my father is the husband next one every branch in me that beareth not the fruit he taketh away and every branch that bear fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which i've spoken unto you abide in me and i in you and the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me i am the vine ye are the branches the mystery of eve the mystery of the second eve that's why i preached the bride tree can you say amen i'm the vine you're the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing how many would say amen to that if you're not abiding in the vine you can do nothing you can't live this life without being connected by a new birth to the vine christ is the vine but the bride is the branches and the branches bear the fruit can you say amen next one if a man why not in me he is cast forth as a branch and his withered and men gather them and cast them into fire they are burned next one if you abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what she will and it shall be done is there any more there this next one and if you abide me and here is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so shall you be my disciples it's wonderful and the father has loved me so i've loved you continuing my love so now what's the father's desire for you to bear not just little you know little puny little things and not just a few of them but jesus said i've predestinated you to bring forth much fruit and then he says if you're bringing forth fruit i'm going to prune you again that you'll bring forth even more fruit more fruit much fruit much fruit it's in there three times in there much fruit much fruit so he took the tree of life brother brown says he pruned it at calvary why did he prune that tree how many believe the tree of life was at calvary god pruned it at calvary then a bride comes forth a bride tree came the in the church and then when she gets started just a few years church organization began to try to take over and so at the end time the bride tree was birthed at pentecost but then church denominations and organizations the first organizat the first organized church was the the catholic church and from there many daughters that followed the systems and all of it has been denominational ideas mixed in with the bible so the bride tree couldn't thrive the bride tree couldn't be all that she was supposed to be but in the end time he says i will restore the bride tree i will restore and so in the end time he comes to prune the bride tree again and to plant her in the right place the end time message is to come and to prune the bride tree of all her denominational ideas the message has come to prune off all the things that are denominational ideas because we cannot bear the fruit of christ fully without with these denominational ideas so he speaks to that messenger he prunes this bride tree but he doesn't just prune it he plants it in the right place that's the bride tree friends he's watching over the whole thing it's time to bear the fruit it's time for adoption brother tony it's time to wrap this up and at the last days in the middle of satan's eaten i will have a bride tree and she'll have all of that beautiful fruit of the message in her life and it only happens when he prunes and friends if he prunes the bride tree universally then he prunes your life personally that's what people don't like is the pruning they don't like the rough preaching they don't other you see but god's gonna prune your life he says in the quote investments 1963 and i'm watching my time here only been an hour i'm going to wrap it up and that great tree that great tree of life when he come on earth this is the one quote that i had if you you guys have it there that great tree that great tree of life when he come on earth they chopped it down by a roman spear and hung it on a roman tree isn't that amazing they took our tree of life and they hung it on a roman tree that's what the cross was made out of a cursed tree but in there he redeemed a bride tree the bride tree one just like him that eve tree from the garden of eden that tree that had fallen even the beginning and adam walked out with her now adam comes the second adam knowing that he had his eyes open to come to receive his eve and now as the prophet said genesis chapter 2 now genesis 2 he reaches inside of adam he brings out this female part that is to be the fruit bearer hallelujah and then that's only a type because at calvary his side is pierced blood and water come out the spirit of life come back where does it go on the woman in the upper room on the day of pentecost i'm gonna have a bride tree [Applause] the second eve is on the scene she is the one that's gonna bear the fruit and then that rotten devil begins to bring in all these denominational ideas and cut this tree down and cut it down to the roots and all the years that the palmer woman the palmer worm and the cankerworm begins to eat at that bride tree for 2 000 years of church history but joel says joel says i don't care how far they get it down to the stump i'm gonna send my prophet and i'm gonna restore her back to a blooming tree again hallelujah and friends if he said he's going to do that to the bride worldwide he's going to do it to your life personally i don't care what satan has taken away from you i will restore saith the lord you're under a god that has the power to restore everything that you've lost in your life [Applause] i don't care what he's taken away if it belongs to you god's going to give it back to you and you see people delivered from all their denominational ideas and all their addictions to pornography and to see them delivered from all their all their all their things that satan's beating them over the head about it to see them deliver to bitterness to see somebody delivered and god says i'm restoring that tree and to see them in church completely free with their hands raised i'm free to bear the fruit of the lord i'm free i don't have to come to church bound anymore i don't have to monday morning get about by the same things i'm a tree that's going to bloom with the message of god in my life because he said that i would [Applause] he said i will restore saith the lord and now as the prophet said the prophet said he said the prophet said david said he'll be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water he's using the same scripture as my text to refer to the bride tree tree planted by the words grant it lord that we the waters of life will water this bride tree in the last days where all the denominational branches have been pruned by the husband men this message you think that's it's hard it's so harsh i don't even want to share with him but you better share it with people because it's not some mental man trying to be harsh sisters it's not some man trying to bind your life it's the husband man it's the farmer the great farmer is pruning your tree let him come let the husband come and prune my branch because i want to bear in life what i was supposed to bear who cares about a tree that's bearing bitterness and and all this other stuff in the world of worldliness and bound by pornography that's just you're a statistic like all the rest of them why don't you give the place i'm not going to bear that fruit anymore i'm here to bear the fruits of christ and he said i would is that the whole quote this bride tree he said it will water this bride tree and all the denominational branches have been pruned by the husband men and now the spirit of god is living anew in the top of the tree which come from the heart of the tree the word granite lord and this is in his prayer and may they bring forth much fruit this bride tree is going to bring forth much fruit she's doing it already he prunes off the denominational ideas the message does that it's still doing it he prunes off the denominational ideas that you have because he whatever background you come from whatever family you come from you have attachments there that are stunting your growth and ministry today i believe is not just ministering to blast the denominational systems brother braham says and is your life worthy just so we don't say yeah all those people out there let's just bring it home a minute he says and is your life worthy of the gospel he says a brother he says can bear he says if you don't follow christ daily you will take on an organizational life so there's no sense in blasting denominations when you and your thinking can be a denomination in yourself stunting the growth of fruit in your life and you may hold on to your baptist ideas you mean your pentecostal i'm not slamming the baptist all systems are wrong you may hold on to your pentecostal ideas that's why people don't go on with the fruits of the message because they're they're hanging back in pentecost they want to see a reviving of pentecost again it's not what we're here for there's ministers that haven't died to their pentecostal ideas and traditions pentecostal traditions haven't died to them and they're mixing them in with the message it'll confuse the people but we're called to the fruit in the tree his fruit and to do that he prunes your life i want to go to church where i'm being pruned amen and there's like a million other churches that you can go to and if you said i feel led to go somewhere else then people get scared to tell me that listen i want you to grow and thrive wherever you can grow if you're not doing it here you need to go you need to go i'm encouraging you find where you belong but there's a million churches that there's no pruning going on whatsoever they're too scared to do it they're too scared to bring the bear fisted gospel you can choose a place you're never going to hear anything that corrects your life but how good you are go for it i want to be in a church that's pruning me the word is pruning me because then i'm bringing forth what the real fruit of a christian is ah praise the lord i gotta find a place to end here i'm over time amen so not just to be [Music] visiting this scripture is not about to just visit the river when you need help well i got another sermon on it some people just visit the river when they need help take a little trip to the river today because i need to be encouraged this tree is not visiting the river this tree is planted by the river and its roots are going down i'm here i'm settled nothing's changing that's why we have too much worry brother rap so capably brought that service last sunday what a blessing wonderful message because that's where we live many times where the devil and there's the trouble with many is that that worry is because we're not living close enough and planted by the river you seek god for temporary help we have a host of people that many times seek god for temporary help and in an emergency they seek god but it's not being planted close to the river i heard a quote from corey tim boom this week i loved it it's very short it talks about our prayer life i heard a quote from this i have and i'm going to quote it because i heard this quote from corey timberlao and i have a lot of confidence in her life and what she knew of the lord and she she said this and it cut to the very core of me is prayer your steering will or your spare tire enough said because you can use prayer as your spare tire you can visit the river when you're emotionally wanting something but that's not what i'm preaching this morning i'm preaching a believer a son and daughter of god saying lord plant me right by the life and let my roots go down so deep that i would never move again young person if you could say that to the lord from your heart this morning i need and see that's when young people they're in the foundation stage of their their in foundations you can lay the right ones or you can lay the wrong ones god's a god of right foundations and you're such an important time of the decisions you make now in your teen years will affect your years for life down the road say well i've already made some wrong ones correct them right away say god forgive me of that you've sown a bad seed then the way to change it is to start see sowing the right seeds so you can have the right harvest your life can be fruit bearing your life can be joy your life can be happiness i don't care what you've been through your life can be the exuberance of the spirit of god and the freshness of the holy spirit there isn't any sin there isn't any fault there isn't any mistake that would keep a believer bound to that to the rest of their life there isn't one of them god's grace and restoration says i can bring them out of anything and will thrive in the kingdom of god how many believe what i'm preaching this morning if we don't believe it we shouldn't come to church we believe the presence of the lord can cause you to thrive no matter what you've been through i believe it with all my heart can you say amen i believe that god can cause us and we don't want to be our prayers to be spare tires we want to be just visiting the river every now and then we want to be planted in the house of the lord planted by our families a brother was asking me this week about his uh decisions for different things got to making careers and the the thing is i always have basically the same answer as a pastor i'll tell you what i told him i'll tell you you're going to get the same answer in those decisions pray about it with all your heart and i believe god will lead you but one thing for sure god is going to bless a man who makes a decision to stay close to the word of god where there's a channel feeding your family and that you have your family in church you don't pick some career and i'm talking to everybody now you don't just pick some career it's gonna keep you out of church constantly and keep your family and you're away somewhere else and your family is just struggling along god can't bless a decision like that you might make less money but you want to make those two priorities top of the line because you know why this is an hour not to be replanted and plan moving around we need to be planted and know where we belong [Applause] and we need to be there with our kids watching us there never seen a god not prosper a man that's made decisions like that hallelujah his prayer your steering wheel or your spare tire you know i took an hour 15 minutes to preach and corey ten boom does it in one sentence and i don't even believe in women preachers shouldn't have said that we don't live on worry the scripture brother read is familiar to us be careful for nothing don't worry about anything but in everything through prayer that's prayer without ceasing i said i'm not going to bind myself with worrying about something i'm going to my god every moment if i have to i'm not going when i'm in emergency for a spare tire this is a steering wheel that's guiding my life praise the lord let's stand together what i like about that tree friends planted the roots go down your roots go deep enough there's no way to get that out and take one of those machines you'd have to rent it from brother hatfield stump cutter grinder oh boy i've i've rented those and i've seen the roots going all the way out to the front yard it's like i to pay you to keep going i mean my goodness but see that's what god's looking at for a spiritual life just so deeply hugely rooted not going to get it out that's where i want to be with the lord none of these fly-by-night part-time christians planted i know where i belong i know where i'm at i'm close to christ this is where we need to be and he's rooted there and his leave shall not wither but the man says he doesn't die and everything he does shall prosper what i love about it is that when you come anchored like that in christ then you say i shall not be i shall not remove i shall not i shall not [Music] so we need a revelation we need to be planet and we need this revelation i won't be removed oh i [Applause] shall not i shall not let it be more than just a song this morning let it be a revelation shall not be i shall not be moved just like that's [Music] jesus is my savior [Music] that's [Music] [Applause] [Music] sing a second verse second verse in my christ abide i shall not in his love i'm hiding [Applause] [Music] not be hallelujah [Music] [Applause] just i shall not one more verse one more [Music] fail verse never [Music] amen i just want to pray with you this morning if you bow your heads and say play does anyone hear that first line says jesus is my savior is anyone here this morning i was just praying quietly pondering the message this morning you haven't received the lord never receive the lord as your savior and lord never say i've been in church maybe a lot of years but i never for myself i never asked him to be lord of my life just raise your hand i want to pray with you this morning if this message has encouraged you to do that it led you in that way imagine most of you have but if you haven't encourage you turn your life over to the lord this morning amen amen so for all of you trees that are here this morning do you see the vision and would you say lord take my tree and prune it under this message take my tree and prune it let me be a thriving fruit-bearing life let it be lord just according to how was preached this morning god bless you god bless you i'll pray with you you pray with me something different than what you were when you came in today something different than what you were before he needs a yielded heart to him just the moment that i'm asking is there anyone else to raise your hand would you pray with me would i pray for these lives that's here this morning that's that for an hour and listen so intently lord setting aside their thoughts of everything else and giving you this moment lord to consider their spiritual life and consider where they're at maybe something has got them down and they're in a very slowing period in their life they're just stunted in their growth just stopped them for years but they're starting to see the vision but you don't want them to stay there they're meant to be a thriving holy ghost-filled joy-filled believer and they raise their hands they say lord help me this morning to be that tree that's pruned cut off anything lord that's not your fruit if i'm bearing a branch of bitterness cut it off of me this morning if i'm bearing a branch that's bringing forth a different fruit than what this message is cut it off my life lord remove it take it out lord by the root or let it just be the fruits of the message of this age what you intended your achievement which you wanted to achieve make my life a blessing lord make my life something that people can eat from it's a fresh fruits of god at this age forgive us lord when we go so many years planted in the wrong place may our roots go down so deep by the holy spirit lord if there's someone here this morning that has not been germatized by the holy ghost something hasn't even began in them lord because they still desire the things of the world they still want the world oh god may they seek that satisfying change conversion dramatized by the holy spirit where the desires change and i no longer desire the things of the world but my passion and my delight is in the word of god i may fail in my flesh and make a mistake i think a wrong thought but my desires the seed has been germatized by the holy ghost let it be lord [Music] for you must be born again that's what you said granted father for our children for
