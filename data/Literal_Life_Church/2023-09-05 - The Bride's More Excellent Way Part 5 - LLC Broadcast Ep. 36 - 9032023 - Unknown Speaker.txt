for a heart singing hallelu Hal [Music] Hallelujah Proverbs Chapter 19 and verse 11 I'm just reading this one scripture and we're going to preach off of this this morning in our series the bride's more excellent way and this is Proverbs 19 and verse 11 says the discretion of a man deferreth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression the discretion of a man deferreth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression and I might reword that there are many different translations but I'll just reword it so we might understand it a bit better and that is the discernment of a man the the caution of a man would defer make him not react so quickly in Anger what would defer his anger and it is his glory to cover a multitude of sins there's a glory in that there's a christlikeness in that and that is when you not only forgive but you pass over transgressions this verse in Proverbs 19:1 has just been um intriguing to me the last few days as we've been studying over and um this verse actually in one verse covers both of my new points as we cover them today in the bride's more excellent way just so you know if you haven't been a part of the series that we're out of 1 Corinthians 12 the last scripture in 1 Corinthians 12 says covet earnestly the best gifts but yet I show unto you a more excellent way and then Paul goes into all the attributes of love divine love in 1 Corinthians 13 and so we've been taking those things little by little and we're going to take two more of those things today what the excellent way is and what divine love is and how that translate in into Holy Ghost love being expressed in this hour from our vessels not just a shallow love but holy ghost Divine love expressed through us you when you project love when Divine love is projected not just I got it but when it's projected and manifested then Sovereign Grace can take over situations that we cannot handle that we cannot do something steps in how many would love it if the Lord would step into situations so when love is projected there's so there's a power that works in love love is the most powerful force in the world I shouldn't say love is because there's a lot of different versions of love that the world is given but Divine love Holy Ghost love is the most powerful force in the world can you say Amen there is nothing greater there is no demon there is no political power there is no government there is nothing more power ful than Divine love there's no church there's no system there's no religion that can be as powerful as Divine love and so this is what we want it to project we want it to project on our lives and so I'm going to cover two two more points of divine love and that is love is not easily provoked to anger number one love is not easily provoked to anger and love does not keep a record of others wrongs so that's the two we'll be looking into today love is not easy eily provoked uh to anger and love does not keep a record of others wrongs so there's just something intriguing about this particular verse and it's amazing that this one verse can say so much uh even about the points that I'm on today uh for and and to look at a man that could come to a place and and in God that it says here there's such wisdom behind this because it says the discretion of a man this isn't some worldly man this is a Godly Man the discretion of a man deferreth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression that is not the glory of the world that is not the way of the world that is not a man of the world this Glory has to be a glory that that has come in that man from go from God because the glory of the world and the way the world is is that we do keep record of wrong we don't cover transgression we remember transgressions we don't defer our anger we usually react in Anger that's the world's way but when the glory of the Lord comes in a man or a woman then it's going to be manifesting more of these things and that is a a deference because of discernment you step back and look and before you react in our number one default thing and that's anger before you react in Anger you defer it with wisdom and with discernment to say now wait a minute what is the what is the whole picture can you say Amen what is going on here before I just just respond in anger and then it is the glory of a man to pass over or to cover over a transgression that's been done to him or any transgression it's the glory I can say safely it's the glory of God to pass over a transgression of somebody else for a man to come into this kind of reaction and the covering another man's sins he would be entering into another Glory than a regular man reacting in anger and Vengeance quickly and keeping tabs on others wrongs is the glory of a worldly man in fact he's praised for it have you ever watched that the men of the world and our stars and our sports stars and our movie stars and the people that are everybody's looking to have you ever noticed how much they get a free pass from manifesting any character because that's the glory of the world so they get free passes all the time they we Overlook that because of their gift because they're good at football or whatever else and they live all kinds of lives and do all kinds of things and yet that that glory is the glory of the world because we're still going to praise them we're still going to glorify them we're still going to build them up as being a mighty Superstar and movie star and singer and all these other things no matter how how they live how much they cuss how much they they evade their taxes how much they the the dirtiness of their life how many marriages they have doesn't matter what they do we will still glory and praise them for their gift this is what the the world glorifies but when the glory of the Lord comes on on a man he doesn't hold grudges he doesn't hold on to the past and he can cover the sin of another can you say Amen the glory of the Lord was upon Adam he was in he was a he was a Son of God and he acts like God and when a Son of God comes into that place of Glory again through Redemption he acts like God and he reacts like God I said he acts like God and he reacts like God and we first begin to see this we SE it a little bit through the Old Testament but we first begin to see that the glory of God had come back in a man that had fallen from Adam because he was in that Glory Now That Glory completely fills the vessel of Jesus Christ and we see a man with the glory of God act like God do Miracles like God do do signs like God can do right in his vessel but it wasn't just that Jesus acted like God In Miracles and signs and wonders he reacted to situations like God would so it's not just that you act like God but that you react to life situation ations like God because it's God living in you so this next point of divine love is love is not easily provoked to anger Ecclesiastes 7:9 says be not Hasty in thy Spirit to be angry for anger resteth in the bosom of fools in this uh version of cab the same scripture says don't be quick to get angry for Only Fools nurse anger so that's that's a further interpretation if you have something in the booom of fool fools it actually goes back to a woman who has a baby in her booom she's going to feed that and nurse that baby and she holds it she protects it she nurses it and do you know that you got somebody nursing like a baby nursing their anger and holding it close to them their whole life no wonder if they're nursing their anger they're coddling their anger they're protecting their anger and they're holding it there instead of doing what Brother Kyle said a few Wednesday night you got to let it go real simple message you just got to let it go you got to let things go but this guy's not letting this go he's actually coddling and holding and nursing his anger holding it close to him for Life he's not letting it go at all don't be quick to angry because if you're nursing only the full nurse's anger and if you if you're quick to anger all that's going to do is keep Fest Ing and keep festering and nurse the anger further it has to come an end to your anger brothers and sisters listen to me we're always going to have the emotion of anger but if you're nursing it for life you'll see destruction in your path and you don't even recognize it because you have old anger and you're nursing it and anybody who tees you off just with one thing it brings back all the past memories and you're quick the reason you're quick to get angry is you're nursing your anger amen James 1 says wherefore my beloved brother let every man be swift to hear we need to be more listeners than talkers be swift to ear be more willing to listen than just react quickly Swift to hear slow slow to speak slow to anger slow to wrath why because the wrath of man not God now because how many knows God has a wrath yes it's a holy wrath but the wrath of man will never work the righteousness of God and that's a good reason not to nurse your anger anymore too it will never produce the righteousness of God there are regular irritations in life that that cause it's not just somebody being angry at you there are things that triggle us trigger us and they make us irritated at something okay and so we of course our our goal and our spirit should say Lord uh I want to get to this place that I'm even the regular irritations in life that we're more patient with it that we're more more restful with it and not to react and I encourage people premarital coun counseling um if you want to go through it with the the leadership here uh before you get married I encourage it and it's it's not ever to discourage somebody falling in love it's so that you research a little bit of your life and your spirit and your heart and the girls and you research it together in a very nice way but you're trying to see if there's any triggers in your life that that may might not realize that they're stepping on something and they irritate it and you have unresolved anger unresolved triggers there because now if you get in marriage and that spouse does not know what your past is then they're going to trigger and step on your pain and there's going to be a reaction and your spouse is going why in the world did you react that extreme because you really didn't lay your triggers and lay your pain before the Lord you didn't really discover it I love for young people to start laying these things before God now what's in me Lord that needs to come out Lord you're not going to get everything but at least you're working at it and the reason the one reason I tell couples to do it is because the devil has less grounds to try to divide your Oneness and your marriage he's got less grounds to be on if you're aware what triggers one another if you're aware of it it's half the half the battle right so there's regular irritations life I mean we we headed we went out for a few days and at the airport on Sunday night it was like there was this couple and they were a Nigerian couple brother Michael and they had their baby with them in a stroller and we're going through security and they're going to Nigeria obviously and I found that out later and I think they had half of their house they were taking with them through the security they had everything with them and the I don't know what they checked in but this was half their house here and the stroller was huge and somehow we got behind them and I realize I'm getting a little irritated because we're running a little late and it's like okay we need to get through security you know even if I'm not running late uh Securities irritate me anyway might as well admit it so anyway this nice couple and they weren't nice at that time because they were they had everything and then the guy the security guard had to get that stroller through the machine they you couldn't just drive it through the scanner it had to fit and they were crunching and I know they spent 20 minutes trying to Crunch this thing down and push it through the machine it's like just drive it through just leave it here buy one in Africa don't take and huge bags and just and stuffing this stuff through that scanner and it took forever and then as I come to the other side and it's taken us about a good over a half hour I would it seemed like I'm reminded of what I was preaching that Sunday Morning by the Lord usually that reminder comes from my wife but this came from the Lord and I wasn't even on this subject yet it's just all this subject of of divine love and I'll tell you I have been tested in my home life domestic life family I have been tested to the very core of Myself by these if this series isn't for anybody else it's for me to look at my life and say Lord I'm I'm struggling but I want this more excellent way I got to have it and so then we come through the other side and I start I said all right because of what I preach this morning I'm going to start talking to this couple asked where they were going going three months Nigeria ah we got Nigerian people in our church and I asked if they knew your names and I was just I I connected I connected and I found them to be the ni nicest couple both of them so nice cute baby I changed my whole attitud towards those people and they were very open they started talk I start to talk about the church and and they live close enough and I got I got the new card out and the people that I was so irritated at I handed him a card and invited him to church he says when we get home we're going to come and visit now if ID have stayed in my former attitude you think they'd come and hear me preach I destroyed it I didn't even get a chance to preach anything to him yet and I destroyed the chanes why why because my first discernment wasn't good of the situation and I was irritated so that's normal irritations but what about what about when what about what this provoking means the Greek word to for provoke means to sharpen to stimulate Rouse to anger that's that provoking pushing another's buttons okay and this is love is not easily easily provoked to anger but that's what it does sharpen stimulate Rous to anger the Phillips Bible paraphrases this love it is not touchy love does not have a hair trigger temper some people make everyone around them walk on eggshell because they're always their feelings are on their shoulders and they don't know how to act because they walk eggshells because because maybe it's you you keep everyone in eggshells because you're you're you're touchy and you're you're just you could blow up at any time it is not touchy love does not have a hair trigger temper some people make everyone around them walk on eggshells they're easily offended one little thing that doesn't go their way and boom they use their temper to intimidate and to punish now there's there's something to preach about they actually use their anger as a weapon to intimidate to push back to punish someone to get back at them and when you confront them many times they say sure I have a bad temper but a lot of people has problems I know I got that temper but you know what at least I just get it all out and it's over in a few minutes you know what that's like that's like a bomb it's like a bomb I just get it out there and you're actually Justified and it's over a few that's a bomb you drop a bomb and it's over in a few minutes but look at the devastation it leaves behind you think it's over you went back to work or you went back to your bedroom and you went back Kaboom explosion it's over I said it I said my piece it's done it's over it's not over because You Dropped a Bomb and look at all the devastation from the bomb when you're angry usually you're not loving one more Point love does not keep a record of others wrongs love does not keep a record of others wrongs and the scripture says love thinketh no evil so it's it's tied to our thinking love does not keep a record of others wrongs it thinketh no evil so it's tied to our thoughts a lot of times we're not keeping a record of others wrongs in a in a log somewhere or in QuickBooks but we're keeping it in our thinking that's why you it think love thinketh no evil because it's this thought process as you look at that person and you've got the log in your mind and so you're looking you're thinking evil thoughts of of them instead of positive thoughts instead of right thoughts you're thinking already and you're standing there talking trying to be polite if you even doing that and you're shaking their hand God bless you and you're you give a cold handshake because You' seen him from across the room and you think you're you're thinking you've got the whole record going over of what Dan has done wrong to you and his life and what he's done wrong to everybody and you're thinking all that through so now you give him the cold shoulder but it's all in your thoughts you keep it a record in your thoughts this is our text the discretion of man defer this anger and His glory is the Passover transgression 1 Peter 48 above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover a multitude of sins it doesn't keep record Divine love but it actually actually releases the record of somebody and it forgives can you say Amen so it's in the thinking really that we hold this account now this word when it talks about accounting it thinketh no evil and it's tied to the Greek here that's why we get the conclusion love does not keep a record of others wrong this is a counting word it's used of numerical calculation it is used the same word in the Greek is used of God that does not impute our guilt to us he does not impute sin to us which means he doesn't he he doesn't keep it on our account he releases it from our account but instead of imputing the righteousness of of Christ to instead God imputes the righteousness of Christ to our account and does not impute our guilt or our sin Romans 46-8 that's what it says so love doesn't keep a tally of wrongs and bear a grudge until everyone has has it paid for can I get an amen love does not keep a tally of wrongs and bear a grudge until everyone is paid for it doesn't try to gain the upper hand by reminding the other person of the past wrongs love forgives can you say Amen love forgives and it tries to even forget it's that's harder but for sure love forgives love forgives love forgives love love doesn't keep a record of others wrong how much do we do that how much record are we keeping of another person's wrong you know so God's the perfect accountant every little act will will not be forgotten can you say Amen every little thing that the whole world didn't see but you did somehow unselfish act you gave and you did something and God is the perfect counted how many believe God keeps perfect records except for one thing our sin this is why he's a perfect accountant too except for our sin in God's Great Quick Books perfect Quick Books God can go over and take all the things that we've done wrong and click on it and scroll down the whole list of our whole life and he Scrolls down and Scrolls down he Shades it all what do they call that shading it or clicking it he Scrolls down Scrolls down Scrolls down gets to the very end of all your stuff and QuickBooks that you did wrong and he's got it all blocked shaded and then he reaches over and he clicks the delete button clicks delete and you know how that happens with you even when you accidentally L do it it's gone it's in Oblivion you can't find it and all your sin was cast in The Sea of forgivness and God cannot remember it no more he deletes it thank you for watching our message
