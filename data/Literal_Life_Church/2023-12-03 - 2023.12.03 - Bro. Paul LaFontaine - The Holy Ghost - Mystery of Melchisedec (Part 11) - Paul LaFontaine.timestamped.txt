[35:43] you would and read in the book of
[35:47] Hebrews at times I've had
[35:49] questions and even failed to believe but
[35:53] he was
[35:54] faithful He's been Faithful
[35:57] thankful for that this morning praise
[35:59] the Lord Hebrews chapter 2 and I'm going
[36:01] to read from three or four places in
[36:03] Hebrews here catching uh a little bit
[36:06] about this um man mzc it's just
[36:09] mentioned several times in the book of
[36:11] Hebrews and there is a mystery under his
[36:14] life and I wanted to talk a little bit
[36:15] about it this morning and preach so we
[36:17] begin here in Hebrews chapter
[36:20] 2 Hebrews chapter 2 and verse
[36:25] 9 but we see Jesus who was made a little
[36:28] lower than the angels for the suffering
[36:30] of death crowned with Glory and Honor so
[36:34] you know now that from even from this
[36:36] scripture before we go on Jesus who was
[36:39] made a little lower than the angels He
[36:41] took on something lower even than what
[36:44] he was uh he was there but then he
[36:47] condescended and come and was made a
[36:49] little lower than the angels for the
[36:51] suffering of death crowned with Glory
[36:54] and Honor that he by the grace of God
[36:57] should taste death for every man so what
[37:01] Jesus did in his human uh Journey here
[37:05] in the in the human life what Jesus did
[37:08] had an effect on
[37:10] others because he tasted death for every
[37:13] man and it goes on to say further for it
[37:16] became him for whom are all things and
[37:19] by all are all things in bringing many
[37:22] sons unto Glory so you'll have this
[37:25] theme here where it's talking about the
[37:27] Son of God but then it's talking about
[37:30] Sons plural and they're tied together
[37:32] because whatever the son did the only
[37:35] begotten son the first son whatever he
[37:37] did has an effect on all the sons of God
[37:41] right in bringing many sons unto glory
[37:43] to make the captain of their salvation
[37:47] perfect through sufferings all right
[37:50] we'll pick it up here now uh in chapter
[37:53] 5 and verse 6 and as he saith also in
[37:56] another place thou art a priest Forever
[37:59] After the order of MDC who in the days
[38:02] of his flesh which he's talking about
[38:03] Jesus again in the days of his flesh
[38:06] once again saying that there was a
[38:07] season of 33 years that he come down and
[38:11] condescended and became a human being
[38:13] like us in the days of this flesh when
[38:16] he had offered up prayers and
[38:18] supplications with strong crying and
[38:21] tears unto him that was able to save him
[38:23] from death and was heard in that he
[38:26] feared
[38:27] though he were a son yet learned he
[38:29] obedience by the things which he
[38:31] suffered this is a real mystery because
[38:34] we wouldn't think that the perfect Son
[38:36] of God how many know that Jesus Christ
[38:38] was the son of God and he was perfect
[38:41] and and yet the scriptures speaks of on
[38:43] The Human Side he had to live out this
[38:45] learning obedience by the things that he
[38:48] suffered and being made perfect well we
[38:51] wouldn't think of him as being having to
[38:52] be formed or made perfect but there were
[38:55] elements that he went through in order
[38:57] to come to something to receive crown
[38:59] and glory in this life and he being made
[39:01] perfect he became the author of Eternal
[39:04] salvation once again unto all them all
[39:07] the rest of them that obey him so you
[39:10] can see the mystery is that we could
[39:12] never get out of here we could never
[39:13] make it through this human life we could
[39:15] never have any hope until he came first
[39:19] and lived out this life and that would
[39:22] have an effect Upon Our human life that
[39:24] that that actually we could follow him
[39:27] and go to the same
[39:29] Glory called of God a high priest after
[39:32] the order of mzc so look at that then
[39:35] and then he says of whom we have many
[39:38] things to say and hard to be uttered
[39:40] seeing ye are dull of hearing so he says
[39:42] I have many things to say about this
[39:45] MDC he said but but I can't elaborate on
[39:50] all the mystery behind this man because
[39:54] you're doll of hearing for when when for
[39:57] a time you ought to be teaching yourself
[39:59] ye have need that one teach you again
[40:01] which be the first principles of the
[40:03] Oracles of God and are become such as
[40:05] one need of milk and not of strong meat
[40:08] in other words you're babies you stay
[40:10] babies you want just to hear the
[40:12] principles of the of the things that are
[40:14] just the beginning principles of what a
[40:16] baby is taught when he first comes to
[40:18] the Lord but you can't just hear that
[40:21] you have to grow to become sons that are
[40:23] mature that can hear all of the word of
[40:25] God for everyone that useth milk just
[40:29] milk is unskillful in the word of
[40:31] righteousness for he is a babe that that
[40:33] Minister who only ministers milk he's a
[40:36] babe himself and he can't take the son's
[40:38] IM maturity if he's just bringing milk
[40:40] all the time but strong meat belongeth
[40:43] to them that are of full age even those
[40:47] who by reason of use have their senses
[40:50] exercise to discern both good and evil
[40:54] maturity and grown up is that we have
[40:56] our senses ourself that somebody doesn't
[40:59] have to come and tell us what to do we
[41:01] have our senses exercised we can discern
[41:03] the wrong Spirit and the right Spirit
[41:06] that's
[41:07] maturity you know I I tell people Hey
[41:10] listen God's given me some discernment
[41:12] through years I'm not checking it out at
[41:13] the door I'm going to use it it's Holy
[41:15] Spirit
[41:17] discernment therefore leaving the
[41:19] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[41:21] us go on unto Perfection well this is
[41:24] what Jesus did he he come on he was made
[41:27] perfect he come into Perfection not uh
[41:29] not in the sense that we think
[41:31] perfection in our bod sinless Perfection
[41:33] but growth to maturity let us go on to
[41:36] Perfection not laying again the
[41:37] foundation of repentance from dead works
[41:40] and of Faith toward god of the doctrine
[41:43] of baptisms and of laying on of hands
[41:46] and of resurrection of the dead or of
[41:48] Eternal judgment you can see these
[41:50] themes are very much a part of the
[41:52] kingdom of God the laying on of hands
[41:55] the healings can you say amen the
[41:57] doctrine of baptism these things are all
[41:59] essential Elementary principles but if
[42:01] we only preach those things and only
[42:03] emphasize those things we can't grow
[42:05] where we need to
[42:07] be of dead and unal judgment and this we
[42:11] will do if God permit which means that
[42:14] we will grow to Perfection and maturity
[42:16] if God permits last set of scriptures on
[42:19] mzd is chapter 7 verse1 for this mzc
[42:23] king of Salem priest of the most high
[42:25] God who met Abraham returning from the
[42:28] slaughter of the Kings and blessed him
[42:30] to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part
[42:32] of all first being by interpretation
[42:35] king of righteousness and after also
[42:37] king of Salem Jerusalem which is king of
[42:40] peace without father without mother
[42:43] without dissent having neither beginning
[42:45] of days nor end of life but made like
[42:48] unto the Son of God abideth a priest
[42:51] continually now consider how great this
[42:55] man was
[42:56] are you catching it now he says he's a
[42:59] man that met MDC but he had no beginning
[43:02] of days or ending of
[43:05] Life mystery behind this man but
[43:09] consider how great this man was unto
[43:11] whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the
[43:15] tenth of the spoils amen father may you
[43:18] bless your word today as we break it to
[43:21] the people may you anoint our hearts I
[43:24] father father there are many hearts
[43:26] of the people here and listening abroad
[43:28] that Lord would maybe if they need
[43:31] something from you you're aware of that
[43:33] need today and I pray Lord your Holy
[43:36] Spirit would take control that the power
[43:38] of God that's in your word Paul said I
[43:41] come not to you with enticing words of
[43:44] man's Wisdom but with power and
[43:47] demonstration in the Holy Ghost it's by
[43:49] testimony by witness that if there's a
[43:52] life of the Holy Ghost that's overcoming
[43:54] then Lord we can witness of that that in
[43:56] our own lives we have hundreds here that
[43:58] can witness of it in their lives so it's
[44:01] not just a intellectual gospel but it
[44:03] has the power with it to change lives
[44:06] and live an overcoming life let that be
[44:08] displayed through the preaching and
[44:09] through our lives this morning and we
[44:11] pray that you'll draw the Hungry Heart
[44:13] closer to you in Jesus name amen God
[44:17] bless you you may be
[44:20] seated there's amazing there's an
[44:22] amazing mystery under this person who
[44:26] met Abraham in Genesis 14 if you don't
[44:29] know where it's at That's Where It's At
[44:31] there's an amazing mystery so much so
[44:33] that Paul kept mentioning it in Hebrews
[44:35] and he said there's a lot of things
[44:37] under this life and mysterious and
[44:39] theologians through the years have tried
[44:41] their best to explain who is mzc who is
[44:44] this man is he just the priesthood is he
[44:46] uh they can't explain it because there's
[44:48] a mystery around his life and uh it it
[44:51] under it under this mystery is many
[44:53] things but under of course is the truth
[44:56] of predestination under mzc in the
[44:58] mystery there's the truth of
[45:00] predestination and there are other
[45:02] things uh the prophet says that we find
[45:05] here in this mystery of mzc the complete
[45:08] Secret Of Our Lives of the Journey of
[45:11] our lives so I I'd be curious to know
[45:14] what's under this mystery because it
[45:16] holds the complete Secret Of Our
[45:19] Lives I think that's wonderful and our
[45:22] and our journey and our destination as
[45:25] I've been preaching on that God has a
[45:27] destination for us when he gives us the
[45:29] Holy Ghost it's taking us somewhere
[45:32] there's a journey with the Holy Ghost
[45:34] there's a destination with the Holy
[45:36] Ghost and so I'm tying this in with the
[45:38] Holy Ghost series to talk about MDC for
[45:40] one service because we realize there's
[45:43] something so important under the mystery
[45:45] of this man and he says Paul says that
[45:47] this great man he calls him a man
[45:50] consider this man let's Ponder let's
[45:53] let's pray about understanding this man
[45:55] and yet yet he was eternal because he
[45:57] had no beginning of days there was no
[45:59] history to him when Abraham met him it's
[46:01] like where are you from he didn't come
[46:03] from any place there was no Heritage
[46:06] from him and he afterwards there there
[46:09] was no there was no record of ancestors
[46:12] and there's no record of descendants and
[46:14] so he met Abraham and here they had a
[46:16] meeting and they sat down this was after
[46:18] Abraham come back from the Battle of of
[46:21] delivering his uh his relative and he
[46:23] come back with the spoils of the battle
[46:25] and come back after that and mzc met him
[46:29] uh and had a meal with him there after
[46:31] his battle and so this was a very very
[46:34] unique meeting uh if you're listening
[46:36] this morning this was a special meeting
[46:39] with Abraham and it was very important
[46:42] that God manifest himself this way and
[46:44] speak to his son Abraham and Abraham if
[46:48] you read the scripture he he uh paid
[46:50] tithes of all he he he he worshiped he
[46:54] rejoiced and he really realized this uh
[46:57] vessel that was in front of him was
[46:59] telling him that he was the uh inheritor
[47:02] of all things he was he was going to
[47:04] inherit all things he was a he was
[47:06] giving his position and showing that you
[47:08] may not think you have a lot you may not
[47:10] think that you have a a a Heritage or or
[47:13] something that you're going to have
[47:14] descendants but you are going to have
[47:16] descendant you're going to be blessed a
[47:18] matter of fact there'll be hundreds of
[47:20] children of Abraham that come from
[47:22] you so he's telling his future some
[47:25] somehow this vessel in front of him is
[47:28] connecting him with the Eternal thoughts
[47:30] of God to tell you your life is not just
[47:34] here you're not just living a temporary
[47:37] human life but he made a connection with
[47:40] a vessel that was telling him something
[47:43] Eternal about
[47:45] himself Abraham you didn't begin here
[47:48] you were in the thoughts of God there's
[47:50] something that you were in the thoughts
[47:51] of God and Abraham is sitting there
[47:53] hearing this and not only did he hear
[47:55] his thoughts of who he was but who he
[47:57] would be now when Jesus comes on the
[47:59] scene he makes a statement he says I
[48:02] come from God and I go back to
[48:05] God and so Jesus held something within
[48:09] him that though he stepped into this
[48:12] space of time for 33 and a half years he
[48:16] held a revelation of where he came from
[48:19] and he held the revelation of where he's
[48:21] going I'm going to go ahead and say it
[48:23] if God should connect you with the
[48:25] eternal thoughts of God and you should
[48:27] know that while you're on Earth it'll
[48:29] affect how you act it'll affect how you
[48:31] live you won't be so disappointed in
[48:33] life because you know you came from
[48:36] somewhere and you're going back to
[48:39] somewhere and that's where I believe
[48:41] becomes the maturity of sons that we
[48:44] conduct ourselves as sons that we're not
[48:46] tossed about by every window of Doctrine
[48:48] and back and forth and don't know
[48:50] whether I'm saved one day and going back
[48:52] to Camp every year and getting the Holy
[48:54] Ghost again no there's a stability when
[48:56] a revelation strikes your heart you
[48:59] connect to the Eternal that this is just
[49:02] the thing that I come and gave my heart
[49:03] to the Lord in an altar and now I'm just
[49:05] struggling to get along when God gives
[49:07] you a revelation who you are you stand
[49:10] sure I come from God and I go back to
[49:14] [Music]
[49:16] God glory be to God boy you're getting
[49:19] into it quick brother Paul yes I am amen
[49:22] because there's a mystery under here for
[49:24] our lives right
[49:26] and that's why we have such instability
[49:28] when a person doesn't make a connection
[49:30] with the
[49:31] Eternal like Abraham did with
[49:35] azdc this is all just a a struggling
[49:38] thing it's about just this life and the
[49:43] Commandments of God become carnal that
[49:46] it's a law and it's a
[49:51] rule praise the
[49:53] Lord so he met Abraham he had no record
[49:57] of ancestors or descendants met
[50:00] Abraham and then he was gone or so we
[50:03] think he was gone after that but if he
[50:04] was eternal he wasn't
[50:07] gone brother Braham said he's whoever it
[50:10] was there meeting with Abraham he's
[50:12] still alive this
[50:15] morning and he unveiled to us that it
[50:17] had to be Jesus Christ but in another
[50:20] form to
[50:21] Abraham because God can change his
[50:24] mask it can be all God standing there in
[50:28] front of you and his his mask is
[50:31] different God and
[50:33] morphe he can change his mask like a a
[50:37] person in a play can play three or four
[50:39] different parts he goes back behind
[50:42] backstage and he changes his clothes and
[50:43] he comes out and acts the part of the
[50:45] villain goes back changes his cloth he
[50:47] he act he acts out another part he have
[50:49] three or four parts if he's a real good
[50:52] actor but it's all the same person so
[50:56] God and morphe God God changing his mask
[51:00] and this was Jesus Christ and so but you
[51:02] see he has this eternal uh part to him
[51:05] and so as all Mysteries should be
[51:07] finished and settled at the end time
[51:08] aren't you thankful all Mysteries will
[51:10] be settled and finished at the end time
[51:12] under the seventh angel of Revelations
[51:14] 10:7 how many believe that this morning
[51:17] under the seventh angel of Revelations
[51:19] 10 107 The Mystery of God should be
[51:21] finished and all the things that have
[51:23] been lost if you're listening here this
[51:25] morning
[51:25] uh maybe on the Internet or through the
[51:27] broadcast it's a glorious day that we
[51:29] live in it's a a powerful day it's a
[51:31] glorious time when God would take truths
[51:34] that have been lost through church
[51:35] history and covered up by Creeds and
[51:38] dogmas God says in the last days by the
[51:40] seventh angel I will unveil all of that
[51:42] and give all my truths back to the
[51:43] people again and all Mysteries will be
[51:46] finished and we'll understand what has
[51:48] been lost and hiding to us throughout
[51:50] Generations this is the hour and guess
[51:52] what this mystery of MDC had to be
[51:55] settled during this time at the end
[51:58] time so Paul Paul needs to reveal some
[52:01] things about this MDC but you know what
[52:04] he says there's many things under this
[52:06] story in this mystery mzc that are
[52:08] needed but I can't I can't tell you all
[52:11] right now back 2,000 years ago I Can't
[52:13] Tell You Why why couldn't he tell them
[52:15] why couldn't he bring all that because
[52:17] of their
[52:19] immaturities chapter 6 and verse 11 in
[52:22] the Amplified version and if you guys
[52:23] want to put it up there you can but this
[52:24] is concerning this mil etica we have
[52:27] much to say about it's hard to explain
[52:29] since you have become dull and sluggish
[52:31] in your spiritual hearing and discipline
[52:33] to listen reason I'm bringing this up is
[52:35] I I've been talking about maturity and
[52:37] so he said I couldn't tell you all these
[52:38] things because of your immaturity he
[52:40] says for though by this time you ought
[52:42] to be teachers because of the time you
[52:44] have learned all these truth learned
[52:46] these uh uh simple truths you actually
[52:48] need to be someone to now you should be
[52:51] teachers but you actually need someone
[52:52] to teach you again the elementary
[52:54] principle principles of God's word from
[52:56] the beginning and you have come to be
[52:58] continually in need of milk and not
[53:00] solid food for everyone who lives on
[53:02] milk is doctrinally inexperienced and
[53:05] unskilled in the word of righteousness
[53:06] since he is a spiritual infant himself a
[53:09] preacher that's a spiritual infinite a
[53:11] teacher that's a spiritual infinite but
[53:13] solid food is for the spiritually mature
[53:16] whose senses are trained by practice to
[53:19] distinguish between what is morally good
[53:21] and what is evil chapter 7 said
[53:23] therefore let us give get past the
[53:26] elementary stage in the teachings about
[53:28] Christ advancing onto maturity and
[53:31] Perfection and spiritual completeness
[53:32] now remember when he says leaving these
[53:34] principles he doesn't say we're ditching
[53:36] them we're leaving them we're going away
[53:38] from them no that doesn't what he that's
[53:40] not what he means he says we're not
[53:42] staying there on just those things we're
[53:44] moving on to
[53:45] Perfection okay just like 1 Corinthians
[53:48] 13 might as well bring it up when Paul
[53:50] says when that which is perfect is come
[53:52] that which is in part is done away well
[53:54] you're talking about the gifts you're
[53:55] talking about everything no that didn't
[53:57] mean Paul said we do away with the gifts
[53:58] they always should be in the church but
[54:01] when we're moving to Perfection we're
[54:02] moving to a greater uh deeper Holy
[54:05] Spirit that's leading us for the gifts
[54:07] to operate and that's excellent that's
[54:10] an excellent way of perfect love so we
[54:12] don't leave those things we don't ditch
[54:14] the gifts we want all those gifts in the
[54:16] church how many wants the five gifts of
[54:18] the fful ministry in the
[54:20] church amen you know there's a spirit
[54:23] that's working around to try to
[54:25] eliminate the five-fold ministry we
[54:26] don't need those gifts anymore we just
[54:28] need to push play I think that's the
[54:30] spirit of the enemy that does that God
[54:32] gave five spiritual gifts to the church
[54:35] the fivefold ministry to the church and
[54:37] we shouldn't remove them from the
[54:39] church God gave nine spiritual gifts to
[54:42] the church we don't have a right to
[54:43] remove them but when he says leaving
[54:46] these things he says that there's a
[54:48] deeper level there's something to move
[54:49] on to without ditching these things
[54:52] we've got to move on to perfection
[54:55] to excellent the excellent way to
[54:57] perfect love amen so now I I like how
[55:00] the Amplified words this that's why I'm
[55:02] reading it he says therefore let us get
[55:03] past the elementary stage in the
[55:05] teachings about Christ advancing onto
[55:07] maturity and Perfection and spiritual
[55:09] completeness completeness doing this
[55:12] without laying again the foundation of
[55:13] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[55:16] toward God of teaching about Washings uh
[55:19] baptism the laying on of the hands the
[55:21] resurrection of the dead and eternal
[55:23] judgment these are all important matters
[55:26] in which you should have been proficient
[55:28] long ago and we will do this that is we
[55:32] will proceed to maturity if God
[55:37] permits so this is the problem God had
[55:40] some Revelations to bring to Sons about
[55:44] MDC but they wanted to stay babies and
[55:47] did not want to receive this or were not
[55:49] able to receive it they wanted to stay
[55:52] in the comfort blanket of the elementary
[55:54] principle
[55:55] Sons cannot remain babies
[56:01] spiritually the Holy Ghost won't let you
[56:03] do it you can keep stomping your foot
[56:06] like a
[56:07] two-year-old and wanting your own way
[56:10] and ignoring other parts of the word and
[56:13] acting like a baby and staying staying
[56:15] in the realm of your carnality and your
[56:18] favorite preachers and your gossip and
[56:20] you're saying anything giving yourself
[56:21] permission to say anything I've covered
[56:23] a lot of these things you can stay there
[56:25] all you want to but if you stay in the
[56:26] atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and you are
[56:28] a son it will not allow you to stay a
[56:31] baby he's going to put trials and allow
[56:33] trials in your life to cause you to grow
[56:35] up and be a
[56:36] man be a woman of God to be a man of God
[56:41] some of those trials that you get say I
[56:43] can't believe God's using this I failed
[56:46] miserably God will God will allow you to
[56:48] fail because you got too much
[56:51] pride maybe I had to stop here and
[56:53] preach this a minute it's amazing to me
[56:56] what God can order in a person's life
[56:58] when they have so much pride or they
[57:00] have so much of themselves it takes an
[57:02] extreme thing that God has to do to
[57:04] Humble you as a son that you learn to be
[57:08] obedient to God you learn to follow his
[57:11] word and he doesn't push us and make us
[57:13] uh uh override our will he just makes us
[57:16] willing to
[57:18] go
[57:20] amen because he loves us but you stand
[57:24] back and look at your journey and you
[57:25] look at your story and you're going I I
[57:27] never would have wanted a story like
[57:29] this I don't like my story it's Unique
[57:32] to myself this happened this person died
[57:35] this person fell away this husband left
[57:37] me this W wife left me I never wanted it
[57:40] that way it's embarrassing I can't
[57:41] believe this this is not the ideal this
[57:43] is not the perfect thing this wasn't the
[57:45] perfect marriage that I wanted this
[57:47] wasn't the perfect thing and God in
[57:49] those weaknesses and Imperfections if he
[57:52] gets anything out of it it'll be to
[57:53] train you as a son and daughter to get
[57:56] out of your babyhood and stand up and be
[57:58] a man or a woman in God I'm going to
[58:00] serve him no matter what took place in
[58:02] my life I don't care if I'm divorced or
[58:05] there's been losses in my life I'm going
[58:07] to stand as a mature daughter of God and
[58:09] a man of God and I'm going to let the
[58:11] devil know I'm not going anywhere I'm
[58:14] not going anywhere I stand for the
[58:16] message of the hour I stand for truth
[58:19] that's right let 10,000 Fall by my left
[58:22] 20,000 by my right it shall not come
[58:24] nigh to me by the grace of God I'm going
[58:26] to stand right here somebody ought to
[58:28] say praise the
[58:33] Lord that's where God wants to get
[58:36] you mature
[58:38] sons and so Sons cannot remain babies so
[58:42] if they want to get more
[58:43] solid uh then they have to come to this
[58:46] so you need to be open and mature to
[58:47] receive stronger Revelation and some of
[58:49] these things you will receive and it
[58:51] will stabilize you it'll bring you to
[58:53] more and more stability and maturity as
[58:55] Sons God has things to give you this
[58:57] morning that will burn the immaturities
[58:59] out of your life and make you more
[59:01] stable more mature God has Revelations
[59:04] to bring you God has trials to allow in
[59:06] your life but he also has Revelations
[59:08] and if you catch some of those things it
[59:10] changes everything it changes your
[59:12] perspective it changes how you look at
[59:14] yourself it changes how you look at
[59:16] other people changes how you look at
[59:18] pastors can you say Amen there's
[59:20] Revelations to mature you as well and we
[59:23] can't remain babies if we want to
[59:25] receive those Revelations we have to be
[59:28] willing to eat spiritual meat and I
[59:30] don't believe spiritual meat is just
[59:32] deep deep doctrinal things I believe
[59:35] it's things that God gives us for Sons
[59:37] to
[59:39] mature may not be a deep deep doctrinal
[59:43] Revelation because I've seen a lot of
[59:45] people they can really explain the deep
[59:47] deep Revelations and Dazzle us with how
[59:49] deep in their types they can go and I
[59:52] don't see any growth in
[59:57] character something's wrong with that
[1:00:00] picture I think if he takes you deep in
[1:00:02] the word he takes you deep in your
[1:00:05] life I think if you're a deep Christian
[1:00:07] doesn't mean you can intellectually
[1:00:09] explain all the
[1:00:11] seals I think if you're a deep Christian
[1:00:14] he's taking you deeper in the word he's
[1:00:15] taking you deeper in a sacrificial life
[1:00:18] deeper in a prayer life deeper in a
[1:00:20] dedication lost in the presence of God
[1:00:23] can you say Amen
[1:00:25] you're not wavered and so affected by
[1:00:28] life's human
[1:00:33] experience the first thing in our first
[1:00:35] scripture that we read he shows here
[1:00:36] there is a connection with the Son of
[1:00:38] God and all other Sons what Paul is
[1:00:39] bringing is that Jesus Christ didn't
[1:00:42] just die if you want to go back to
[1:00:43] chapter 2 we refer to this again our
[1:00:45] first scripture we read Hebrews chapter
[1:00:47] 2 he said he shows that there's a
[1:00:49] connection with the Son of God and all
[1:00:50] the other Sons what Paul is bringing is
[1:00:53] that Jesus Christ didn't just die for
[1:00:55] Sons of just
[1:00:57] die uh Jesus Christ did not just die for
[1:01:02] sons of God but he would bring many sons
[1:01:06] unto Glory with him so now if I was just
[1:01:10] preaching the basic principle I would
[1:01:12] just say that Jesus Christ died so that
[1:01:15] we can be saved and take all our sins
[1:01:17] away that's not what Hebrews is saying
[1:01:20] he died for our salvation but when it
[1:01:22] says he died and lived out a life of
[1:01:25] suffering that he could bring many sons
[1:01:28] to
[1:01:29] Glory the same Glory that he would come
[1:01:32] to that doesn't mean he died just to
[1:01:35] save you from your sins he died to bring
[1:01:38] you to maturity to come to the same
[1:01:40] Glory that he came
[1:01:43] to that's what the scripture is saying
[1:01:45] to bring many sons not just to save you
[1:01:48] but bring All Sons to Perfection to
[1:01:50] maturity to adoption in their Human
[1:01:52] Experience you at some point in your
[1:01:54] life experience this uh holy ghost
[1:01:57] coming and you w and when that Spirit
[1:02:00] comes that Spirit coming to you will
[1:02:02] lead you and guide you into all truth
[1:02:05] you will overcome things you will come
[1:02:07] to the same Glory as the first son did
[1:02:09] that's what the scriptures saying is
[1:02:11] that when he the spirit because the
[1:02:13] spirit of his son the spirit of his son
[1:02:16] his only begotten son he will come
[1:02:18] living an experience but that didn't end
[1:02:20] the story he came back again on the day
[1:02:23] of Pentecost and the SP Spirit of his
[1:02:25] son Christ this the the not a different
[1:02:28] Spirit his Spirit of his son trinitarian
[1:02:32] is not trinitarianism is not the truth
[1:02:35] can you say Amen because when Jesus said
[1:02:38] when you see me you see the Father the
[1:02:40] father was in him and when the day of
[1:02:43] Pentecost came it wasn't some other
[1:02:45] spirit that came on them by tongues of
[1:02:47] fire it was the spirit of his son that
[1:02:50] came in his
[1:02:51] people now friends I'll tell you I'll
[1:02:53] just stop right here here and say if he
[1:02:55] lived out 33 and A2 years and he healed
[1:02:58] the sick and he raised the dead and he
[1:03:01] he lived through the Temptations of the
[1:03:03] devil and he overcome every one of them
[1:03:05] the Bible says in Hebrews he was tempted
[1:03:07] in every Point as we
[1:03:11] are in every Point Jesus was tempted
[1:03:15] women and everything else if it's said
[1:03:16] every point he was tempted that you
[1:03:18] would be tempted he was tempted in every
[1:03:20] Point whatever you face tomorrow
[1:03:22] whatever you fac last week maybe maybe
[1:03:24] you failed I don't know but whatever you
[1:03:26] were tempted in he had to come and be
[1:03:29] tempted with the same thing and guess
[1:03:31] what we got a story because he overcame
[1:03:33] it
[1:03:34] all he's already overcome it and then he
[1:03:37] said because I have already overcome you
[1:03:41] will overcome as
[1:03:42] well now friends you just got to think
[1:03:45] about if it's the spirit the H the Holy
[1:03:48] Ghost if it's the spirit of his son
[1:03:51] living in me he's already over come the
[1:03:55] world he's already put the devil under
[1:03:59] his feet he's already overcome can you
[1:04:03] say am man he's already been there done
[1:04:05] that got the T-shirt hate to say it that
[1:04:07] way but he's lived this experience out
[1:04:09] and that same Spirit who overcome it
[1:04:12] came was born went through a journey
[1:04:14] went to Calvary died resurrected the
[1:04:16] third day that spirit is living in me
[1:04:20] this
[1:04:23] morning
[1:04:25] what's that do it gives me
[1:04:28] confidence
[1:04:29] wow The Same Spirit that's already
[1:04:33] overcome everything is living in
[1:04:37] you what could the devil bring
[1:04:40] tomorrow what could he stir up against
[1:04:43] you whether it's through your the
[1:04:45] economy the the the your finances uh
[1:04:48] what bill could come that you didn't
[1:04:50] expect what family drama could be going
[1:04:53] on
[1:04:55] that could ever be bigger than God's
[1:04:58] spirit being in you to overcome
[1:05:03] it God
[1:05:06] hallelujah I can live confident not
[1:05:08] proudful but
[1:05:10] confident that's the kind of spirit
[1:05:12] that's living it's his Spirit of his son
[1:05:15] and will the spirit of his son bring
[1:05:16] many sons to Glory yeah he'll bring him
[1:05:19] to
[1:05:20] Glory because God didn't just have one
[1:05:23] son in my in mind but he had he
[1:05:25] predestinated a world of Sons and
[1:05:27] Daughters of God and they were all in
[1:05:30] his mind be before the foundation of the
[1:05:32] world God had his in his mind a family
[1:05:36] God had his mind he predestinated a word
[1:05:39] of sons and daughters not just one son
[1:05:41] we we hear of his only begotten son but
[1:05:44] in your scriptures brother and sister
[1:05:46] and those who are listening there's too
[1:05:49] many references to Sons Sons God
[1:05:53] predestinated a world of sons and
[1:05:56] daughters not just the only begotten son
[1:05:59] not just the first son who came we can't
[1:06:02] just preach about him but we can preach
[1:06:04] about the power of him living in the
[1:06:06] rest of his sons they were in his mind
[1:06:08] as well you were in his mind as well how
[1:06:11] many you believe this morning you were
[1:06:12] in his mind just as much as Jesus Christ
[1:06:14] was in his mind all of his sons were in
[1:06:17] his mind before the foundation of the
[1:06:19] world so they were all come to not just
[1:06:22] a birth in Christ but the glory and the
[1:06:24] power in them like Adam had in the
[1:06:28] beginning before the fall like Christ
[1:06:30] had like Adam had they are partaking of
[1:06:33] the same power and glory in their lives
[1:06:36] because why they were a son in God's
[1:06:39] mind before the foundation of the world
[1:06:41] how does he do all this they all are
[1:06:43] included in his perfect son partaking of
[1:06:47] this testing and suffering in his life
[1:06:49] now we go back to Hebrews 2:10 and read
[1:06:51] it in the Amplified hope not hopefully
[1:06:53] you're not off ended by that I screen
[1:06:55] through these interpretations and these
[1:06:57] different Bible translations because
[1:07:00] sometimes they don't get it right
[1:07:01] sometimes I like the Amplified if they
[1:07:03] if they get it right and they just bring
[1:07:05] it out just a different way but it's the
[1:07:06] same theme uh you know brother Harold
[1:07:09] hillbrand used to call it the perversion
[1:07:13] version so we have to be careful of
[1:07:15] those things but he says in Hebrews 210
[1:07:18] for it was fitting for God that is an
[1:07:20] act worthy of his divine nature that he
[1:07:23] for whose sake are all things and
[1:07:24] through him are all things in bringing
[1:07:27] many sons to Glory should make the
[1:07:29] author and the founder of their
[1:07:31] salvation perfect through suffering
[1:07:35] bringing to maturity The Human
[1:07:38] Experience necessary for him to be
[1:07:41] perfectly equipped for his office as
[1:07:44] high priest now God's taken him to be a
[1:07:47] high priest for all the other people for
[1:07:49] the next 2,000 years he's going to set
[1:07:52] them at the right hand of authority as
[1:07:53] as a high priest that when we go pray he
[1:07:56] can be touched by the feeling of our
[1:07:57] infirmities did you ever think of if you
[1:07:59] went to prayer about a certain need in
[1:08:00] your life in this Human Experience that
[1:08:02] you prayed to a Christ who didn't know
[1:08:04] what you're talking about to a God who
[1:08:06] didn't know what you're talking about
[1:08:07] friends when you go and express things
[1:08:09] to him he knows cuz he's been here he's
[1:08:12] lived it out and when you pray whatever
[1:08:15] it is you think you got a new thing you
[1:08:17] there's nothing new to God Christ has
[1:08:19] been through it he knows how to overcome
[1:08:20] it and you pray God hears your prayer
[1:08:23] and the says that high priest is touched
[1:08:25] by the feeling of our
[1:08:29] infirmities and I like this last
[1:08:31] statement to bring to maturity The Human
[1:08:35] Experience necessary Christ to to have a
[1:08:39] human experience but to bring it to
[1:08:41] maturity through Human Experience
[1:08:44] necessary for him to perfectly be
[1:08:46] equipped for the office of high priest
[1:08:47] so Christ himself even though we look at
[1:08:49] him as perfect he had to experience
[1:08:51] things so he could be a faithful high
[1:08:53] priest so he could could come and be
[1:08:54] that high priest so in other words
[1:08:55] there's a position waiting there's a
[1:08:57] position he's coming to he had to come
[1:08:59] and experience what you experience in
[1:09:02] order to get that position of high
[1:09:03] priest how many know that Revelations 5
[1:09:05] says after the seal come into the hand
[1:09:07] the book come into the hand of Christ it
[1:09:09] says they worship he hath made us Kings
[1:09:12] and Priests we're going somewhere we're
[1:09:14] being molded for the Millennium we're
[1:09:16] being molded to rule and reign with
[1:09:22] Christ and the human experience must be
[1:09:26] used for us to come to maturity in order
[1:09:29] to rule and reign with
[1:09:32] Christ can't stay
[1:09:36] babies there it is Christ it was a
[1:09:39] journey bringing him to be a priest
[1:09:40] molding him to be something coming to
[1:09:43] maturity in The Human Experience the
[1:09:45] journey was to come to maturity in The
[1:09:47] Human Experience if I can express that
[1:09:48] to you you're here not for a job not to
[1:09:53] make a lot of money money and if you do
[1:09:55] praise the
[1:09:56] Lord if you don't praise the
[1:09:59] Lord cuz you're not here just to just to
[1:10:03] squeeze out this Human Experience to see
[1:10:06] how much money you can
[1:10:09] make do I need to say
[1:10:11] more you're not here just to get married
[1:10:14] and you know enjoy all the things of
[1:10:16] life and the material things of life and
[1:10:19] you're not here just for that if a young
[1:10:20] person could catch you're not here just
[1:10:22] to get married that's important and if
[1:10:24] God has a plan for you praise the Lord
[1:10:26] I'm sure he does find that plan find the
[1:10:28] will of God but always remember you're
[1:10:30] not here just to get married you're not
[1:10:32] here just to have jobs God has put you
[1:10:35] here for a reason young girl God's put
[1:10:38] you here for a purpose young man God's
[1:10:41] put you on this Earth in this journey
[1:10:43] and you might have 15 years or you might
[1:10:45] have 50 years or you may have a 100
[1:10:47] years but God chooses that your days may
[1:10:49] be over at 20 years old you could leave
[1:10:52] here and your days be finished but one
[1:10:54] thing for sure he put you on this Earth
[1:10:56] for a purpose and that's to mold in you
[1:10:58] what is needed as a son and daughter of
[1:11:02] God time to get up on the potter's wheel
[1:11:05] and say Lord here I am I'm
[1:11:07] Yours how long you going to wait well
[1:11:09] I'll do it someday when I'm not a
[1:11:10] teenager no
[1:11:12] more I'll give my life to
[1:11:15] God when I'm
[1:11:19] older why
[1:11:22] wait
[1:11:24] why not now say Lord I'm
[1:11:29] Yours who's telling you to
[1:11:32] wait say well I got a few things I want
[1:11:34] to enjoy and this message will restrain
[1:11:36] me from enjoying them yeah but talk to
[1:11:39] about 70 other people in this
[1:11:42] congregation and they'll tell you that's
[1:11:44] a big
[1:11:45] [Music]
[1:11:46] lie that's the biggest lie one of the
[1:11:49] biggest lies got some things to enjoy
[1:11:51] and I can't do it without the restraints
[1:11:53] of the message being over me I need to
[1:11:54] go enjoy some things first that's a
[1:11:56] lie you never enjoy life until Christ is
[1:12:00] the core of who you
[1:12:02] are there is no possession there is no
[1:12:06] relationship with a guy or girl there is
[1:12:09] nothing that trumps the relationship
[1:12:11] with Jesus
[1:12:13] Christ if you had it all and didn't have
[1:12:16] that you're missing everything if a man
[1:12:19] gain the whole world and lose his
[1:12:22] soul sons are coming here to be
[1:12:25] perfected and molded just like Jesus was
[1:12:27] to come to his kingship to come to his
[1:12:29] priesthood and so other Sons would know
[1:12:32] he did it and they would do it by the
[1:12:33] same power leading them we have to get
[1:12:35] into what he knew while he was in his
[1:12:38] experience so this is what I want to get
[1:12:39] into now what did Christ know when he
[1:12:40] got into his experience on Earth that
[1:12:43] set him towards the perfect will of God
[1:12:45] instead of his own will because he
[1:12:46] struggled with his own will in The Human
[1:12:48] Experience he had his own will there and
[1:12:50] he struggled all the way up to the end
[1:12:52] he struggled oh if it be possible
[1:12:53] possible let this cup pass from me and
[1:12:55] that was his will saying is there any
[1:12:56] way to get around this Calvary is there
[1:12:59] any way to get around this type of
[1:13:01] sacrifice he's struggling with it there
[1:13:03] great great blood drops of Tears blood
[1:13:06] drops coming down earnestly in the
[1:13:08] garden there's a struggle until the
[1:13:10] struggle was won the battle was won
[1:13:12] nevertheless Lord not my will but thine
[1:13:14] be done and at that moment the battle
[1:13:17] was one can you say Amen it wasn't just
[1:13:19] Calvary brother Brown says the battle is
[1:13:21] actually one in the garden
[1:13:24] he said the battle was one in the garden
[1:13:26] on his knees at an altar the battle was
[1:13:29] won because his will was
[1:13:32] overcome said I submit myself to the
[1:13:34] will of God whatever happens from here
[1:13:37] on out I'm going to walk in the
[1:13:39] scriptures of what he said and every
[1:13:41] place we have especially the ends of
[1:13:43] Jesus life that the scriptures might be
[1:13:45] fulfilled that the scriptures might be
[1:13:47] fulfilled if anybody doesn't have that
[1:13:50] goal then you got a wrong goal that the
[1:13:52] scriptures be fulfilled in my
[1:13:57] life think not that I can call 10,000
[1:14:00] Legions of Angel right now as Peter
[1:14:02] grabbed his sword and everybody's a will
[1:14:04] def Peter you know he just he must have
[1:14:07] just started in his immaturity just
[1:14:09] swinging the sword at everybody you know
[1:14:12] I don't know if he was a fisherman so he
[1:14:14] probably wasn't trained and he just
[1:14:16] slung around anybody taking the sword
[1:14:18] which we're not supposed to use the
[1:14:19] sword of the word to do that slices off
[1:14:22] the ear of one of the soldiers
[1:14:25] Peter as I said to you a couple weeks
[1:14:27] ago Peter you don't even know what
[1:14:28] Spirit you're of the son of man didn't
[1:14:30] come to destroy lives but to save lives
[1:14:33] put your sword away for those who live
[1:14:35] by the sword die by the
[1:14:38] sword that's not the kind of battle
[1:14:40] we're
[1:14:41] in he's swinging Jesus reaches up and
[1:14:44] puts that back on and he said but here
[1:14:46] they're all in there and they didn't
[1:14:48] understand what was going
[1:14:50] on and he said Peter don't you think
[1:14:54] that I could call 12 Legions of angels
[1:14:56] right now and deliver me out of all
[1:14:59] this imagine a Son of God and he knows
[1:15:01] his power but look at the
[1:15:04] submission but that the scriptures might
[1:15:07] be
[1:15:09] fulfilled he had a choice there to use
[1:15:12] his power as a Son of God to bring 12
[1:15:16] Legions of angels and deliver them out
[1:15:18] of that but then the scriptures wouldn't
[1:15:20] be fulfilled every obedient son is
[1:15:24] obedient is that what does the word say
[1:15:26] about my life in this human journey and
[1:15:29] every bit of it I want it to be
[1:15:31] fulfilled in my life if it brings hurt
[1:15:33] if it brings suffering if it brings
[1:15:35] losses whatever it is that the
[1:15:37] scriptures might be fulfilled in my life
[1:15:39] I mean raise your hand and say that's
[1:15:40] that's what I
[1:15:42] want and so this is how Jesus was and so
[1:15:48] so now what what made
[1:15:51] him uh
[1:15:53] what made him so have this
[1:15:58] confidence uh within him we have to get
[1:16:00] to that and know that in his experience
[1:16:03] he could set his will towards God
[1:16:04] instead of his own will before the G
[1:16:08] beginning let me just explain it this
[1:16:10] way before the beginning in in uh
[1:16:13] Genesis 1:1 you know what it says you
[1:16:15] were taught in Sunday School in the
[1:16:17] beginning
[1:16:18] God so the that's the only first thing
[1:16:20] we have is the beginning so in the
[1:16:22] beginning God God and he's an object of
[1:16:25] worship there was no family yet there
[1:16:28] wasn't anything it was just God an
[1:16:30] object of worship but before the
[1:16:32] beginning then it was there was no
[1:16:34] beginning it was just Eternal and God
[1:16:36] dwelt eternally there with just him and
[1:16:39] his thoughts even before Angels were
[1:16:42] created and so it was God and God is a
[1:16:45] spirit and so there he was with his
[1:16:48] thoughts with his attributes and then
[1:16:52] God wanted to to descend and begin
[1:16:54] coming down to man God wanted to begin
[1:16:56] in descension actually God wanted to be
[1:16:58] able to express himself in his family in
[1:17:02] different attributes that he had within
[1:17:04] himself and so he begins this
[1:17:06] condescension he begins this descending
[1:17:09] and uh Prophet said his first being was
[1:17:12] Spirit God Supernatural all right the
[1:17:16] great Eternal and second so that's the
[1:17:19] great Eternal that's the supernatural
[1:17:21] God in spirit but second he begin to
[1:17:24] form himself towards flesh so he's on a
[1:17:28] journey to condescend to form himself
[1:17:31] towards flesh the second thing is that
[1:17:33] he begin to form himself towards flesh
[1:17:35] in a
[1:17:40] theophonic the word but it's a body it's
[1:17:43] a
[1:17:52] theophonic body
[1:17:57] Christ I'm teaching Sons this
[1:18:00] morning in the beginning was the word
[1:18:03] and the Word was with
[1:18:07] God because remember he had God the
[1:18:09] Eternal Spirit there was no form of him
[1:18:11] right now he forms himself into the body
[1:18:14] called the word and in the beginning was
[1:18:16] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:18:19] the Word was God so you can't make two
[1:18:22] out of that
[1:18:24] so somehow in his mystery he could begin
[1:18:27] to form himself down to the human exper
[1:18:30] to Human by uh changing his mask and
[1:18:33] coming into a thing called the theophany
[1:18:36] which is called the word in the
[1:18:37] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:18:39] with God and the Word was God read a
[1:18:41] little further in chapter four verse 14
[1:18:43] of John 1 then we have the next phase
[1:18:46] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:18:49] Among Us so the whole journey there
[1:18:52] Jesus goes through that as he's
[1:18:54] condescending and coming down to his
[1:18:56] Human Experience condescending coming
[1:18:58] from thought to word the person perfect
[1:19:01] theophany body a visible manifestation
[1:19:04] to humankind of God that's what a
[1:19:06] theophany means if you look it up in the
[1:19:08] dictionary theophany means a visible
[1:19:11] manifestation to the to humankind of God
[1:19:15] a visible manifestation because God as a
[1:19:17] spirit we couldn't have any visible
[1:19:19] manifestation we couldn't understand we
[1:19:20] couldn't see he forms himself in some
[1:19:22] form form of a visible manifestation a
[1:19:25] theophany body and this is what he had
[1:19:27] come to Abraham in in a body but it was
[1:19:29] that theophany body in a body and now
[1:19:32] he's meeting with Abraham he's he's he's
[1:19:35] transort transporting himself into this
[1:19:38] meeting with Abraham this word is really
[1:19:40] what we could call John one in the
[1:19:42] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:19:43] with God the Word was God then the word
[1:19:45] was made flesh in other words he stepped
[1:19:48] out of Eternity into time when he became
[1:19:50] flesh he stepped out of that theophany
[1:19:53] that Eternal Body and he stepped into
[1:19:57] time that's when he became flesh he
[1:19:59] stepped out of etern Eternity into time
[1:20:04] now I ask you that question why did
[1:20:05] christ have to do that frankly in a
[1:20:09] nutshell why do you have to come all the
[1:20:11] way down to human beings and come into
[1:20:14] time why did he have to do it
[1:20:17] frankly we messed
[1:20:21] up
[1:20:24] like I said a few weeks ago you're all a
[1:20:25] piece of
[1:20:28] work and when Adam and Eve messed up you
[1:20:30] messed up too you're messed up you're
[1:20:34] all messed
[1:20:36] up and I'm really messed
[1:20:39] up and so we we we see then that he had
[1:20:44] to we were messed up if all of his sons
[1:20:47] of God are in his mind and that's a that
[1:20:50] can choke somebody that doesn't know the
[1:20:52] word that's that's real meat to accept
[1:20:54] the fact I don't know why it's hard to
[1:20:56] accept though that I was in God's mind I
[1:20:59] was in his lineage I was a seed of God
[1:21:01] in God's Mind by representation why it's
[1:21:04] hard because all of my sons this morning
[1:21:06] my two sons all of my sons two of them
[1:21:08] and my children were in
[1:21:10] me and they took the betting ground of
[1:21:13] marriage to bring them the past that's
[1:21:14] why they reflect the image they start to
[1:21:16] look like me they start to act like me
[1:21:17] they don't want to but they start acting
[1:21:19] like me they start have characteristics
[1:21:21] of me and that's the proof that's the
[1:21:23] proof okay that they weren't just some
[1:21:27] random no no they come from my
[1:21:31] genes my and some of my characteristics
[1:21:34] will be in them if that's true in the
[1:21:36] natural it's true in the
[1:21:38] spiritual I don't know why that's hard
[1:21:40] to
[1:21:42] admit that if we are Sons we had to be
[1:21:46] like Jesus Christ in the mind of the
[1:21:50] father if I'm going to be anything as as
[1:21:52] a Christian it'll not be because I'm
[1:21:55] trying to make myself better it'll be
[1:21:57] because I was in God's mind as a son
[1:22:00] amen so all the inheritance of the son
[1:22:04] comes with me and is given to me not
[1:22:07] because I deserved it but because I was
[1:22:09] in his mind and he will not lose one of
[1:22:11] them that was in his
[1:22:12] mind somebody ought to shout and say
[1:22:15] praise the Lord this morning Hallelujah
[1:22:18] so a visible so I got to move on here
[1:22:20] because you see why do you have to do
[1:22:21] that why did you come to it's because we
[1:22:23] messed up and if all the sons of God
[1:22:25] were in his mind then all would have to
[1:22:27] be manifested right if Christ was
[1:22:29] manifested his son all his sons would
[1:22:31] eventually have to be manifested someday
[1:22:33] they'd have to come the difference in us
[1:22:36] in Christ is that we skipped from God's
[1:22:40] thoughts we skipped our theophany body
[1:22:43] and we skipped that part and we came
[1:22:46] straight to the Human Experience we
[1:22:48] bypassed our
[1:22:51] theophonic Human Experience Jesus did
[1:22:55] not skip that Jesus did not bypass that
[1:22:58] Jesus came from the Son of God the
[1:23:01] thought of God an attribute of God to
[1:23:04] his theophany body and then to The Human
[1:23:07] Experience and that's why he knew all
[1:23:09] things that's why he stood with
[1:23:11] confidence and knew his place in the
[1:23:13] word and had perfect Faith because he
[1:23:17] had this uh Mind Of God that was flowing
[1:23:23] through him he knew where he came from
[1:23:26] now if Sons could catch that they would
[1:23:29] act different on
[1:23:33] Earth I mean it's called the Paul says
[1:23:37] let me just go off here a minute Paul
[1:23:39] says we receive the mind of Christ now
[1:23:42] friends if through this Holy Ghost we
[1:23:44] receive the mind of Christ in our soul
[1:23:48] and that's all that God has for you and
[1:23:51] all God thought of you and that's
[1:23:53] resident within you then and it starts
[1:23:56] to affect you by Revelation then you're
[1:23:58] going to start
[1:24:00] recalling how many is getting older and
[1:24:03] has a bad
[1:24:04] memory only me okay
[1:24:07] fine but I have to meet with my mom and
[1:24:09] my mom tells me stories of when I I
[1:24:11] could forget all my childhood all of
[1:24:13] it and she has to tell me and when she
[1:24:16] starts talking it triggers my memory oh
[1:24:19] yes and it's wonderful I love for her to
[1:24:20] do it because I hate forg getting things
[1:24:23] that were good I hate forgetting good
[1:24:25] good memories and it triggers it and
[1:24:26] brings it back it's almost like us
[1:24:28] spiritually when we're not born again we
[1:24:30] don't know who we are we're out there in
[1:24:32] the world we're serving the world
[1:24:33] dressing like the world acting like the
[1:24:35] world smoking like the world drinking
[1:24:36] like the world committing adultery like
[1:24:38] the world and all of a sudden now God
[1:24:40] touches your life and you come in
[1:24:42] contact with something
[1:24:45] Eternal and you begin to recognize wait
[1:24:47] a minute I'm acting like the world but
[1:24:50] I'm not really the world I'm starting
[1:24:52] starting to
[1:24:53] recall from the mind of Christ that I'm
[1:24:57] an
[1:24:58] attribute I'm a glory be to God I'm a
[1:25:02] quality I'm a characteristic I'm one of
[1:25:05] God's
[1:25:08] qualities glory be to God if you this
[1:25:11] week could look at yourself what's an
[1:25:13] attribute it's a quality or
[1:25:15] characteristic of someone else can you
[1:25:17] say amen and you could have that memory
[1:25:20] started and as we stay in the word and
[1:25:22] stay under the message in this open book
[1:25:24] of redemption the sons of God are
[1:25:26] learning who they really
[1:25:29] are when the prophet says I'm an
[1:25:31] attribute of God you start to see okay I
[1:25:34] know what that means I'm one of God's
[1:25:39] qualities the devil's told you you're
[1:25:41] dirt you're dirt you're dirt all your
[1:25:43] whole life you're dirt you're living it
[1:25:44] out and you're living from the
[1:25:45] experience of dirt and you he's told you
[1:25:48] that your whole life and he still tries
[1:25:49] to tell you that but when are Sons and
[1:25:51] Daughters of God got to rise up and say
[1:25:53] no I'm actually one of the qualities of
[1:25:58] God because God has no bad attributes he
[1:26:03] has no bad characteristics like us we
[1:26:05] have bad
[1:26:06] characteristics right are we going to at
[1:26:08] least say Amen to that this morning
[1:26:10] we're born with them we got traits of
[1:26:12] the family we got traits of we got
[1:26:14] spirits that you know we got it we have
[1:26:17] bad characteristics some we need to die
[1:26:19] to but God has none and so I can say ly
[1:26:22] say I'm one of God's
[1:26:25] qualities how can I word it I'm one of
[1:26:28] God's quality characteristics because he
[1:26:31] doesn't have any
[1:26:32] others when sons of God catch that
[1:26:35] that's a pretty powerful Life to
[1:26:39] Live amen praise the Lord oh glory be to
[1:26:43] God I'm excited about the word this
[1:26:46] morning I forgot my thoughts so I have
[1:26:48] to go back up here and figure out where
[1:26:49] I'm
[1:26:50] at oh I know what it was
[1:26:53] was um you know sons of God are starting
[1:26:56] to recall it's all coming back to them
[1:26:59] you know Sherry has a song It's All
[1:27:01] Coming Back to Me Now where were you job
[1:27:04] when I laid the foundation of the Earth
[1:27:06] where the sons of God shouted for Joy
[1:27:08] that's why when somebody shouts when
[1:27:10] somebody dances the aisles you know
[1:27:12] they're just expressing their original
[1:27:16] state don't get offended at that if you
[1:27:19] start to recognize this and get happy
[1:27:20] about it from the foundation of the
[1:27:23] world the sons of God are shouting for
[1:27:25] Joy but they connect with that memory
[1:27:27] and it comes back to them it's kind of
[1:27:29] like it's a little bit like deja vu
[1:27:31] anybody ever have Deja Vu and they don't
[1:27:33] know what that is till yet but we know
[1:27:34] what it is because sometimes and I used
[1:27:36] to have my friend brother Mark Johnson
[1:27:38] he'd be standing about four or five
[1:27:39] brothers and we'd be talking he'd be
[1:27:41] talking to us and then he would say he
[1:27:42] would just say stop everybody stop right
[1:27:44] here just a minute don't nobody move he
[1:27:47] said I've seen this before I've said
[1:27:50] I've I've said these things before
[1:27:52] that's deja vu something's coming back
[1:27:55] and they can't describe it but if that
[1:27:57] can happen that way how many's ever had
[1:27:59] Deja Vu happen it's like this spiritual
[1:28:01] Dayja Vu is saying I'm starting to
[1:28:03] recognize what I was in the mind of God
[1:28:05] before the foundation of the world it's
[1:28:08] coming back to me now and as it comes
[1:28:10] back you live every day by the mind of
[1:28:15] Christ that I am a quality of him in my
[1:28:18] father I'm one of the attributes or
[1:28:20] qualities of God I'm not what the devil
[1:28:22] says about me my mistakes are underneath
[1:28:25] the blood of Jesus Christ can I get an
[1:28:27] amen I can't get enough amens this
[1:28:28] morning my mistakes are all under the
[1:28:31] blood of Jesus Christ and I'm only seen
[1:28:34] by the father as a quality attribute
[1:28:36] that was in
[1:28:39] him my it all starts to come back to
[1:28:42] Sons when they connect with something
[1:28:45] Eternal this morning if you don't
[1:28:46] connect with that you're going to look
[1:28:48] at life carnal you're going to look at
[1:28:49] the word as carnal Commandments you're
[1:28:52] you're going to look at this as law
[1:28:53] you're going to you're going to see it
[1:28:55] completely different but if you have a
[1:28:56] meeting like Abraham had with mzc Jesus
[1:29:00] Christ he's going to connect you with
[1:29:02] the Eternal thoughts of
[1:29:04] God the difference in us in Christ we
[1:29:07] skipped our from thought life to
[1:29:09] straight to the Human
[1:29:10] Experience we never were in in our word
[1:29:13] Eternal
[1:29:14] Body because of sin we messed up we
[1:29:17] bypassed our theophany but guess what we
[1:29:21] have a theophany
[1:29:25] body Jesus had a theophany body we have
[1:29:28] a theophany body I don't know if
[1:29:29] anybody's don't know it but you you if
[1:29:31] you're a Christian you have the Holy
[1:29:33] Ghost the very reason you have the Holy
[1:29:35] Ghost is you heard from your
[1:29:38] theophany there's like an ellic cord
[1:29:42] from your soul to your word body it's a
[1:29:44] perfect body it doesn't get sick it
[1:29:46] doesn't get headaches it doesn't get
[1:29:50] depressed it doesn't have have any mind
[1:29:52] battles it never struggles with the word
[1:29:54] it says Amen to every word of God
[1:29:56] because it's a word
[1:29:58] body and that's what you heard from when
[1:30:02] you received the Holy
[1:30:04] Ghost it wasn't just I came to the Altar
[1:30:07] and you know I gave my heart to God
[1:30:09] that's fine that's wonderful but this is
[1:30:10] deeper than just giving your heart to
[1:30:12] God this is connecting with your
[1:30:13] theophany body when you recognize the
[1:30:17] eagle food for this hour you have heard
[1:30:19] from your theophany body you have
[1:30:22] connected with something Eternal and
[1:30:24] that's why when we begin to recognize
[1:30:26] that nothing that happens in this Human
[1:30:28] Experience can ever
[1:30:31] jeopardize the destination that I'm
[1:30:33] going to you see why the Holy Ghost is
[1:30:35] tied to this
[1:30:37] mzc it's very much tied to it and now
[1:30:40] God says I have to condescend further
[1:30:42] down now I have to come a little bit
[1:30:44] lower than the Angels God says it
[1:30:46] because it was God that was coming to us
[1:30:47] it was our kinsman redeemer he was
[1:30:49] coming down and coming to our level he
[1:30:51] had to come to to our level because of
[1:30:53] sin we sin so now he's condescending as
[1:30:56] Hebrews says Paul says in Hebrews a
[1:30:58] little lower than the Angels into time
[1:31:01] itself in a couple weeks we'll celebrate
[1:31:03] the time of the birth of Christ he comes
[1:31:05] down and he doesn't begin as an adult he
[1:31:08] begins as a baby because that's how we
[1:31:10] begin can I get an amen he lives out The
[1:31:14] Human Experience just as we do a baby
[1:31:17] adolescent teenager all of that he lives
[1:31:20] it out and he comes into the space of
[1:31:23] time why is he doing that why does he
[1:31:26] come to The Human Experience why did my
[1:31:29] Lord Jesus Christ have to become like me
[1:31:32] because I couldn't be redeemed unless he
[1:31:36] did I'm lost and this morning without
[1:31:38] Christ you are lost headed for a dying
[1:31:42] hell it's Jesus Christ that offers
[1:31:45] you life and eternal
[1:31:49] life but you have to accept C it you
[1:31:53] have to receive it well I'm an exception
[1:31:55] to the rules you're not an exception to
[1:31:57] the rules he is the way the truth and
[1:31:59] the life he is the connection to the
[1:32:02] Eternal there is no finding God in
[1:32:04] relationship without Jesus Christ the
[1:32:08] word and so
[1:32:10] he my sons are stuck in sin and Humanity
[1:32:15] I'm having such a good time this morning
[1:32:17] that I'm going to stay with it for a
[1:32:18] little while
[1:32:20] here and because I had three amens I'm
[1:32:23] going to do
[1:32:27] it
[1:32:29] so God says
[1:32:31] because my sons some of my sons are
[1:32:35] stuck in sin and Humanity they're stuck
[1:32:38] there they can't get out headed for a
[1:32:43] Hell Without Me they are lost I will go
[1:32:47] into time and put myself into The Human
[1:32:50] Experience and I will save them but I
[1:32:53] also will teach them how to overcome
[1:32:57] I'll give them my spirit so it can it
[1:32:59] started with him coming here overcoming
[1:33:02] himself and then putting his Spirit
[1:33:04] within them they will be redeemed they
[1:33:08] will have experience full Redemption
[1:33:10] they will come out of the muck and myy
[1:33:12] Clay they will come out of the worst
[1:33:14] possible situations they will be
[1:33:16] prostitutes sometimes they will be
[1:33:18] alcoholics sometimes they will have all
[1:33:21] kinds of dysfunctional family life of
[1:33:24] sexual abuse they will come through
[1:33:26] situations that are so you don't even
[1:33:29] have situations a hundred years ago like
[1:33:31] you have today they will come in Satan's
[1:33:33] e with all kinds of trash and dirtiness
[1:33:35] in their minds from pornography they
[1:33:37] will be in the worst case but my
[1:33:40] Redemption power will come to my sons
[1:33:42] and I will raise them out of it and they
[1:33:45] will be Overcomers praise the
[1:33:50] Lord
[1:33:52] they'll come under the power of
[1:33:54] redemption you see this Redemption is
[1:33:55] not just a sermon that you preach at
[1:33:57] your church on Sunday morning this is a
[1:34:00] power of redemption and when you come
[1:34:02] under that power it goes in One
[1:34:04] Direction it raises you
[1:34:06] up out of your sin out of your myy clay
[1:34:09] out of your habits out of your
[1:34:10] addictions and out of your contention
[1:34:13] and out of your gossip and out of your
[1:34:16] resentment and out of your doubts
[1:34:19] about everything
[1:34:22] I'll raise them up Jesus steps into time
[1:34:25] for 33 years on planet Earth and lives
[1:34:27] by Perfect Faith he deceits the enemy
[1:34:29] he's tempting every Point like we are
[1:34:32] why he's bringing many sons to Glory too
[1:34:34] his other Sons he did it he's not
[1:34:37] ashamed to call them Brethren did you
[1:34:38] know Hebrews said that next in the
[1:34:39] scripture I'm not ashamed to call them
[1:34:41] my brethren now I know we don't think of
[1:34:43] Jesus as our brother but Jesus referred
[1:34:45] to you I went for you because these are
[1:34:48] my brother and these are my
[1:34:50] family
[1:34:52] and he's not ashamed to call them this
[1:34:54] is my brother how many's ever had how
[1:34:57] many's ever had to stand unashamed with
[1:35:00] your brother or your sister or for
[1:35:02] family sometimes we have to stand for
[1:35:04] them when nobody else will stand for
[1:35:05] them Jesus stands where stands up for
[1:35:08] his
[1:35:10] Brethren Jesus died for his Brethren
[1:35:13] Jesus died Jesus lived an overcoming
[1:35:16] life for his Brethren Jesus went to
[1:35:18] glory to bring the rest of his Brethren
[1:35:20] I tell you that's an unselfish act I'm
[1:35:22] not just going to Glory myself I'm
[1:35:23] bringing All My Sons and Daughters to
[1:35:25] Glory somebody ought to shout amen I'm
[1:35:27] bringing all of them to Glory I'm
[1:35:29] bringing them they're coming they'll
[1:35:32] come hard they'll come easy but they're
[1:35:34] all going to come cuz all the father has
[1:35:36] given me All My Sons will come to
[1:35:39] me glory be to God
[1:35:43] hallelujah so now they get a revelation
[1:35:46] that I have a word body and the spirit
[1:35:48] the tutor will come and Lead Me and
[1:35:50] guide me into into all truth one big one
[1:35:54] is that is I've got a theophany one
[1:35:56] great truth of all the truths the Holy
[1:35:57] Ghost will teach you is I have a
[1:35:59] theophany the seven seal was revealed to
[1:36:01] show we have a theophany the Seven Seals
[1:36:03] were revealed to show we have a
[1:36:04] theophany the reason I'm responding to
[1:36:06] him and want to overcome is because I'm
[1:36:09] a predestinated Son of God just like
[1:36:11] Jesus his spirit is in me leading me
[1:36:13] back to Eternity he came into Human
[1:36:16] Experience to be perfected and to be
[1:36:18] matured and I can get excited about the
[1:36:21] journey that I'm in this Human
[1:36:22] Experience I can worship like I'm
[1:36:24] already there I can live like I'm
[1:36:26] already there because it's just as good
[1:36:29] as done in the mind of God can you sayen
[1:36:32] I can live every day as if I I can
[1:36:34] worship in church as if I'm already
[1:36:36] there some of you people need to Worship
[1:36:38] the Lord with all your heart as if
[1:36:40] you're already there cuz it's in the bag
[1:36:43] but I've been put under this tutor did
[1:36:45] you know that the Holy Ghost is called a
[1:36:47] tutor brother R called a tutor to lead
[1:36:49] you and guide you as a matter of fact
[1:36:51] let me blow your mind and say he says
[1:36:53] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is only
[1:36:55] just a temporal gift for you the real
[1:36:57] gift is that soul that lays down
[1:37:00] there see I I thought it would be quiet
[1:37:03] I don't understand all of it either that
[1:37:04] all I know is that he gave the spirit of
[1:37:07] a tutor to lead you in your human
[1:37:09] Journey until he leads you into all
[1:37:11] truth and you come to your theophany
[1:37:14] body the real gift is your soul you were
[1:37:17] part of God before the foundation of the
[1:37:18] world so he gives this paraclete in the
[1:37:20] Greek holy ghost is
[1:37:22] perite
[1:37:24] it's I'm sticking with this this is good
[1:37:27] 12:41 I got lots of time here so holy
[1:37:30] ghost means paracite or paricus in the
[1:37:34] Christian biblical term occurring five
[1:37:36] times in the text of the New Testament
[1:37:39] in this paracite in Christian theology
[1:37:41] the word commonly refers to the Holy
[1:37:43] Spirit and is translated an advocate or
[1:37:47] a counselor or a helper or pericet one
[1:37:50] who goes goes alongside to
[1:37:53] help now we know that it's living within
[1:37:55] us and we know that it's Christ but it's
[1:37:57] also known as a tutor because if you
[1:37:59] have babies you have to have a
[1:38:02] tutor you better you have to have a
[1:38:06] mommy if you're left to yourself as a
[1:38:08] baby no telling what'll happen to you
[1:38:11] God puts you under tutors God you put
[1:38:12] you under mommy then you go to school
[1:38:14] and you under teachers some teachers are
[1:38:16] good some teachers are bad but they're
[1:38:18] all
[1:38:18] teachers you're put under then you come
[1:38:21] under your dad and then you come under
[1:38:22] your because in The Human Experience if
[1:38:25] we didn't have teachers we would be a
[1:38:26] mess so in the spiritual experience the
[1:38:29] Holy Ghost is this parac one who goes
[1:38:31] alongside to help us through this human
[1:38:34] journey and leads us and guides us into
[1:38:36] all truth when you don't know something
[1:38:38] the soul registers by Revelation gets a
[1:38:40] revelation there's another truth there's
[1:38:41] another truth I'm always saying what's
[1:38:43] next Lord because I've already been on
[1:38:45] this journey I love one main thing in
[1:38:47] this life and that's the revelation of
[1:38:48] this word that's why I read it in the
[1:38:49] morning that's why I come to church I
[1:38:51] don't come to church just to see you I
[1:38:53] come because I might get another
[1:38:55] Revelation I come because I love to come
[1:38:58] I love the family of God I love his
[1:39:00] presence I love to connect with my
[1:39:03] theophany I love to hear from my
[1:39:05] theophany I've got a word body and I
[1:39:07] love to hear from it body what do you
[1:39:10] have to say to me
[1:39:13] today but one day we'll cut the
[1:39:17] umbilical
[1:39:18] cord like a baby
[1:39:21] and we'll go into that new body some of
[1:39:24] you in the broadcast you say where in
[1:39:25] the world getting that I'm going to
[1:39:26] quach the scripture if this Earthly
[1:39:28] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[1:39:30] waiting Eternal aonian Eternal Eternal
[1:39:35] no beginning of days nor ending of life
[1:39:36] no C that we have a body waiting for us
[1:39:39] sons have a body waiting for them aonian
[1:39:42] in the
[1:39:43] heavens it's a truth in the Bible you
[1:39:45] can't deny it so you weren't really
[1:39:48] saved one night at an altar if you're a
[1:39:50] real Son of God in his mind you were
[1:39:53] saved before the foundation of the world
[1:39:55] this tutor comes along and he teaches
[1:39:57] you things and he shows you and and Sons
[1:40:00] will make mistakes and he says son you
[1:40:02] you know the T says oh Prophet even
[1:40:05] elaborates about reporting back to the
[1:40:07] father and you know she's wearing short
[1:40:09] dresses and she's doing all this stuff
[1:40:10] and oh I have to bring a bad report I
[1:40:13] don't want him to bring a bad report to
[1:40:15] the father but I want to say I want to
[1:40:17] have that testimony he's really getting
[1:40:19] into the word he's really standing with
[1:40:21] the word he's acting like a mature son I
[1:40:23] put him through all kinds of Trials and
[1:40:25] he's standing there
[1:40:27] unmovable that's the report I want to
[1:40:29] get he's growing he's maturing and the
[1:40:32] tutor is just Distributing these things
[1:40:34] to to all of us by the Holy Ghost here's
[1:40:37] what you need next that's why I've been
[1:40:39] preaching in the Holy Ghost Series this
[1:40:40] is not a one night Affair this is a
[1:40:46] journey this mystery of mcedc is the
[1:40:49] mystery to pred predestination and it's
[1:40:52] a mystery how can we not preach
[1:40:54] predestination to
[1:40:55] Sons how can we not preach it to
[1:40:59] Sons they catch that truth of it can it
[1:41:01] go off the deep end where you get lazy
[1:41:03] and oh just whatever no no no I don't
[1:41:06] want it to do that you have to preach
[1:41:08] predestination to Sons so they can catch
[1:41:11] what they are by
[1:41:13] eternity and that will affect their
[1:41:15] future I came from God I'm headed back
[1:41:17] to
[1:41:18] God teacher a par Le one who goes along
[1:41:22] sides but he said that will be just a
[1:41:24] temporal gift for your Human Experience
[1:41:26] God loved you so much that he would give
[1:41:29] you the Holy Ghost for this Human
[1:41:31] Experience to lead and guide you into
[1:41:33] all truth to make sure that you go into
[1:41:35] all truth to make sure that you make a
[1:41:38] Rapture he ensures my sons will need my
[1:41:42] guidance and my teaching my Revelation
[1:41:45] while they're in that Human Experience
[1:41:46] I'll go with them I'll leave them my
[1:41:48] spirit and it will lead them into all
[1:41:50] truth until they make the Rapture and
[1:41:53] they walk into their new body next
[1:41:55] Sunday we'll finish this series on the
[1:41:57] Holy Ghost by talking about our new
[1:41:59] bodies and talking about this Earnest of
[1:42:01] the Resurrection is just an Earnest it's
[1:42:04] a down payment that we're going all the
[1:42:08] way it's just temporary for human time M
[1:42:11] the mystery of mzc is in a nutshell he
[1:42:14] was there all the time Jesus was there
[1:42:15] all the time he was in mzc with Abraham
[1:42:17] he's there all the time but he stepped
[1:42:19] into time
[1:42:21] if that's true if that's the mystery of
[1:42:22] mzc then can we say that as well I've
[1:42:26] been here all the
[1:42:28] time I just stepped into this Human
[1:42:32] Experience and when I'm done I will step
[1:42:35] out of it back into
[1:42:38] eternity I got stuck in
[1:42:40] time how many feel like you're stuck in
[1:42:43] time I'm just stuck here but friends
[1:42:46] you're not stuck here God's going to get
[1:42:48] you
[1:42:48] out God's getting you out out God's giv
[1:42:51] you the key to get out of here can you
[1:42:53] say
[1:42:56] Amen brother Bram says and who is this
[1:42:59] mzc so many things we can read in that
[1:43:01] but if you bring that quote up now we
[1:43:03] see the attributes the sons of his
[1:43:06] Spirit the sons look notice how that
[1:43:09] words the attributes the
[1:43:12] sons of his Spirit have not yet entered
[1:43:16] into the word formed body but a
[1:43:18] theophany the subject the body is
[1:43:21] subject to the word in Earnest waiting
[1:43:23] for the earnest the change of the body
[1:43:24] so the earnest is the down payment it's
[1:43:26] waiting for the change of the body now
[1:43:28] the difference between him and you
[1:43:30] Christ and you as a son you see he was
[1:43:33] at the beginning of the word and in
[1:43:35] morphe body he came in and lived in that
[1:43:37] in the person of
[1:43:39] mzc you want me to change it
[1:43:43] but go
[1:43:45] back
[1:43:47] but okay I think I got lost hold on I'll
[1:43:50] do it
[1:43:52] then later we never heard no more of mzc
[1:43:56] because he became Jesus Christ mzc was
[1:43:58] the priest but he became Jesus Christ
[1:44:01] now you bypass that you bypass that
[1:44:04] because in that form he knowed all
[1:44:05] things and you have never been able to
[1:44:07] know that yet you come like Adam like me
[1:44:09] you become from the attribute to the
[1:44:11] flesh to be
[1:44:12] tempted but when this life is finished
[1:44:15] here if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:44:17] dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:44:18] that's where we go that is the word then
[1:44:20] we can look back and see what we done
[1:44:23] now we don't understand it we have never
[1:44:25] become the word we've just become the
[1:44:27] flesh man not the word but and look
[1:44:30] clearly it makes it clear you will never
[1:44:31] be the word unless you was that thought
[1:44:34] at the beginning that proves the
[1:44:36] predestination of God you see you can't
[1:44:38] be the word unless you're a thought you
[1:44:40] had to be in the thinking first but you
[1:44:43] see in order to stand Temptation you had
[1:44:46] to bypass the
[1:44:49] theophonic to be tempted by sin and then
[1:44:52] if you stand all the father ha given me
[1:44:55] will come to me and I'll raise him up at
[1:44:57] the last day see you had to be first and
[1:45:00] then you see he come right down the
[1:45:02] regular line Jesus come the regular line
[1:45:04] you came The Irregular
[1:45:07] line oh I wish I would have come the
[1:45:09] other way well you didn't you're
[1:45:12] here but his Redemption is going to get
[1:45:14] you back in line the regular line was
[1:45:17] come before the foundation of the world
[1:45:18] his name was on the B go life then from
[1:45:20] that he became the word the theophany
[1:45:22] that could appear disappear and then he
[1:45:24] become flesh and return back again
[1:45:25] resurrected that same body in a
[1:45:27] glorified
[1:45:29] condition but you bypass the Theology
[1:45:31] and become flesh man to be tempted by
[1:45:33] sin and then if this Earthly
[1:45:35] Tabo be dissolved we have one waiting we
[1:45:38] have not yet the bodies but look look at
[1:45:40] this look at
[1:45:43] this look at this
[1:45:45] Ellie when this body receives the spirit
[1:45:48] of God the mortal life inside of you it
[1:45:53] throws this body in subjection to
[1:45:57] God
[1:46:00] hallelujah I've been preaching on the
[1:46:02] Holy Ghost this is the evidence of the
[1:46:04] Holy
[1:46:05] Ghost something has happened in you
[1:46:08] that's Eternal has come in you eternal
[1:46:10] life and it throws this body into
[1:46:13] subjection to God you couldn't do that
[1:46:16] through psychology you couldn't do that
[1:46:18] in a church system of just denomination
[1:46:20] it takes the Holy Ghost to do
[1:46:23] that guess what it does it throws this
[1:46:25] body did you ever think this is a sborn
[1:46:28] body it will always be a sinb born body
[1:46:31] you think of the miracle of God throwing
[1:46:34] a sinb born body under subjection to the
[1:46:37] word when it doesn't even want the word
[1:46:41] your mind don't want the word your flesh
[1:46:43] don't want the word it don't want to
[1:46:44] line up with the
[1:46:47] word why doesn't it well you don't have
[1:46:49] your word body yet these bodies are born
[1:46:51] in sin doesn't inherit the kingdom of
[1:46:53] God think about the miracle now though
[1:46:55] that he says when this body receives the
[1:46:57] spirit of God The Immortal Life inside
[1:46:58] you it throws this body in subjection to
[1:47:00] God hallelujah he that's born look look
[1:47:02] at the scriptures he's using now now we
[1:47:04] understand these scriptures he that's
[1:47:05] born of God does not commit sin he
[1:47:08] cannot sin now that does that mean
[1:47:11] sinless perfection in the flesh it
[1:47:13] doesn't mean that if it meant that we're
[1:47:16] all failures we'll never make it in
[1:47:18] because we live in a sborn body we think
[1:47:20] wrong thoughts sometimes we do wrong
[1:47:22] things we have to ask forgiveness that's
[1:47:23] what we have the blood for but we want
[1:47:25] to grow as sons that we're doing less
[1:47:27] and less to disle God and more and more
[1:47:29] to please him less and less of the
[1:47:31] mistakes can you say amen and never
[1:47:34] justifying a mistake oh I fell to that
[1:47:36] the other day and I asked God to forgive
[1:47:38] me and I went back to it again there's
[1:47:40] got to be a power of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:42] sometime in your life that you overcome
[1:47:44] that
[1:47:45] thing come on now we water down the Holy
[1:47:48] Ghost way too much but we don't water
[1:47:50] down the Holy Ghost it has power to
[1:47:52] cause you to overcome it has power to
[1:47:54] take over these Minds to take over these
[1:47:56] bodies and bring a body that doesn't
[1:47:58] want to serve the God doesn't want to
[1:47:59] come to church it didn't want to come to
[1:48:01] church this morning you might as well
[1:48:02] raise your hand and admit it your body
[1:48:03] didn't want to come to church you're too
[1:48:05] tired Wednesday nights you don't want to
[1:48:07] come to church and so this body so the
[1:48:10] Holy Ghost picks up as I said picks this
[1:48:13] body up that doesn't want to go to
[1:48:14] church and says you are going to
[1:48:17] church because something in the soul
[1:48:20] Rises up and says I need something from
[1:48:24] God glory be to God all right so he this
[1:48:29] born of God did not commit sin he cannot
[1:48:31] sin why we're looking at from the
[1:48:34] perspective of
[1:48:36] Eternity
[1:48:38] right Romans 81 there's therefore no
[1:48:40] here's another scripture there's
[1:48:41] therefore no condemnation to them which
[1:48:43] are in Christ Jesus they walk not after
[1:48:45] the flesh but after the spirit they are
[1:48:47] there there you are see that throws your
[1:48:49] body subject you don't have to say oh if
[1:48:52] I could just quit drinking if I could
[1:48:54] just just get in Christ and it's all
[1:48:57] gone because your body is subject to the
[1:49:00] spirit it's no more subject to the
[1:49:02] things of the world they're dead let me
[1:49:05] hear an amen don't water down the Holy
[1:49:08] Ghost you keep getting under this power
[1:49:10] of redemption it'll overcome
[1:49:14] everything they are dead your sins are
[1:49:16] buried in baptism you are a new creature
[1:49:17] in Christ and your body becoming subject
[1:49:19] to the Spirit try to live a a right kind
[1:49:22] of life like you women claiming you got
[1:49:24] the Holy Ghost and going out here
[1:49:25] wearing shorts and things how could you
[1:49:26] do it how could the spirit of God in you
[1:49:28] ever let you do such a thing as that it
[1:49:30] just can't be so certainly it can't be
[1:49:32] he's not a filthy Spirit he's a Holy
[1:49:35] Spirit and then when you become subject
[1:49:38] to that Spirit it throws your whole
[1:49:40] being subject to that spirit and that
[1:49:44] spirit is nothing in the world but this
[1:49:47] seed word made manifest or quickened
[1:49:50] Hallelujah Made Alive and when the Bible
[1:49:52] said don't do this that body quickly
[1:49:55] turns to it there is no
[1:50:02] question
[1:50:04] amen amen but I'm not done yet when
[1:50:08] there is a connection with Christ to the
[1:50:10] Eternal when this MDC meets you you
[1:50:14] connect with the Eternal there is a
[1:50:16] power in it for Sons to live this life
[1:50:20] you're tapping into God's mind can you
[1:50:22] say Amen the mind of Christ and you
[1:50:25] begin to live from that or want to live
[1:50:27] from that every day functioned by the
[1:50:30] Inner Man by the mind of Christ what's
[1:50:32] he thinking today what's his thoughts of
[1:50:35] me instead of my own you know the
[1:50:38] prophet was in a service like this
[1:50:41] sometimes and do you know that the Holy
[1:50:43] Spirit would allow him to catch the
[1:50:46] thoughts of
[1:50:49] people
[1:50:51] only a prophet I don't know what you're
[1:50:53] thinking this morning I know the spirit
[1:50:55] does and that's why I'll preach on
[1:50:57] things and people come up and say were
[1:50:59] you at our house last night were you
[1:51:01] behind the corner were you listening to
[1:51:04] us because everything we talked about
[1:51:05] you said the Holy Ghost knows what you
[1:51:09] said he a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:51:11] intents you can't hide anything from him
[1:51:14] but a prophet has a unique gift where
[1:51:16] he's looking he says now he said I I've
[1:51:19] somebody just thought
[1:51:20] that this is mental telepathy I caught
[1:51:23] that thought I caught that thought when
[1:51:25] you thought that
[1:51:28] amazing
[1:51:30] amazing but listen if God can catch our
[1:51:35] thoughts then why don't we catch God's
[1:51:39] thoughts why don't we say Lord let me
[1:51:42] catch your thoughts this
[1:51:43] morning Hallelujah let the Holy Ghost
[1:51:46] allow me to just catch his thought
[1:51:48] tomorrow morning when I get up and face
[1:51:50] my day Lord let me catch your thought
[1:51:51] for today who do you want me to witness
[1:51:53] to today how do you want me to live
[1:51:55] today let me catch your
[1:51:57] thoughts when Sons connect to this they
[1:52:00] mature into finding themselves in the
[1:52:02] mind of God I was in his thoughts from
[1:52:04] the beginning they're not tossed about
[1:52:06] in and out living up and down getting
[1:52:08] the Holy Ghost every Revival not
[1:52:10] clinging to Elementary principles for a
[1:52:12] comfort blanket to live in the past
[1:52:14] they're growing into further revelation
[1:52:16] of who they are walking in it every day
[1:52:18] not snag by temporary things you see now
[1:52:22] friends if you don't get anything else
[1:52:23] when you connect with the Eternal you're
[1:52:25] not as snagged by temporary things
[1:52:28] that's happening in this Human
[1:52:29] Experience I've got to do this I've got
[1:52:31] to do that I I'm I'm worried about my
[1:52:33] finances I'm worried I won't have a
[1:52:35] retirement you're caught in the temporal
[1:52:37] but when you connect with the Eternal
[1:52:39] there's a rest there's a peace in the
[1:52:41] Holy Ghost God will provide for me and
[1:52:44] my destination is in his hands when you
[1:52:47] find the Eternal element it affects sons
[1:52:50] of God to act mature instead of nervous
[1:52:53] and I got to do something for my
[1:52:54] retirement you know what you can do for
[1:52:56] your retirement pray that your kids get
[1:52:58] the Holy Ghost so they go on serving the
[1:53:00] lord when you're
[1:53:01] gone you know what you can do for your
[1:53:03] retirement go ahead and invest my wife
[1:53:06] and I do it but I'm not worried because
[1:53:08] you know your your retirement money in
[1:53:11] overnight can be completely gone by this
[1:53:13] economy you could work your whole life
[1:53:15] and it be complete you have no rest in
[1:53:18] those things you have no rest in your
[1:53:20] business but I can preach to you a rest
[1:53:23] this morning in the Holy Ghost that's
[1:53:26] the Eternal
[1:53:27] rest glory be to God it's an eternal
[1:53:32] rest I am stable I'm not tossed by
[1:53:37] temporary things that's going on some
[1:53:39] temporary things I could tell you some
[1:53:42] this morning see then I'd be sharing the
[1:53:44] negative I've been criticized more than
[1:53:47] I ever have not from this congregation
[1:53:49] but people talking he say I'm not even
[1:53:52] never
[1:53:53] mind if I didn't connect to the Eternal
[1:53:55] I'd be I'd be out of this thing just out
[1:53:58] of it after 35 years you have to hear
[1:54:01] you know you're not even preaching the
[1:54:03] message anymore listen if I was caught
[1:54:06] in
[1:54:07] temporary I would be worried about that
[1:54:11] but when I was 16 years old I tapped
[1:54:13] into the
[1:54:15] Eternal and somebody's temporal opinion
[1:54:17] of me which is a Lie by the way does not
[1:54:20] affect me I'm a human being and I say it
[1:54:23] affects my spirit sometimes but it
[1:54:25] doesn't affect my soul it doesn't say
[1:54:27] I'm throwing in the towel I'm finished
[1:54:29] with the I'm finished with all these
[1:54:31] people you know brother Brandon wanted
[1:54:32] to do that I'm finished he lost the
[1:54:33] feeling for the people Moses wanted that
[1:54:36] I'm finished I'm Lord just destroy all
[1:54:38] of them I'm sick of all of
[1:54:41] them that's right that's right that's
[1:54:45] carnal that's looking at temporary
[1:54:47] people and what they're saying and
[1:54:49] gossiping about but your heart has to be
[1:54:52] connected with something Eternal because
[1:54:55] guess what Hebrews says Brothers here we
[1:54:59] have no continuing
[1:55:05] City what's the message I listen to this
[1:55:07] week he's going oh that that's the title
[1:55:10] here we have no con City and he goes
[1:55:12] through his life story and he says I
[1:55:15] lost my dad he names four or five people
[1:55:17] lost my dad lost my two brothers lost
[1:55:19] lost my wife lost my daughter all within
[1:55:22] a certain amount of
[1:55:23] time he talked about when he was a
[1:55:25] little boy and he was sitting his dad
[1:55:27] was a drunker his dad was an alcoholic
[1:55:29] he said but I love my dad I love my dad
[1:55:32] and he said I would give a million
[1:55:33] dollars all I all the money if I could
[1:55:34] just sit across the table from him at 5
[1:55:37] years old and just be across and see my
[1:55:39] daddy's face he said I give anything but
[1:55:41] he said here we have no continuing City
[1:55:44] we can't go
[1:55:46] back people change people go up and down
[1:55:49] we go life goes up and down here we have
[1:55:52] no continuing City but we seek one to
[1:55:55] come that's Eternal your children are
[1:55:58] going to go astray sometimes your there
[1:56:00] going to be things ups and downs why did
[1:56:02] they do that why did my kid do that why
[1:56:04] did my wife do that why did my husband
[1:56:05] do that life is not certain life will
[1:56:08] change almost on a daily basis and you
[1:56:10] just need to say here we have nothing
[1:56:12] that's stable or continuing you might
[1:56:14] have everything your ducks in a row and
[1:56:16] it changeed in a moment's time but we do
[1:56:18] have an eternal weight of Glory we have
[1:56:20] an eternal
[1:56:23] consistency and we're looking for a city
[1:56:25] whose Builder and maker is
[1:56:31] God not snagged by things Eternal you
[1:56:34] guys don't have this quote in the back a
[1:56:36] man ought to be able to say I read this
[1:56:38] quote years ago and I was going to read
[1:56:39] it again a man ought to be able to say
[1:56:40] when you meet a man is is your a
[1:56:42] Christian experiences when was it the
[1:56:44] dearest to you your Christian experience
[1:56:45] when was it dearest to you you ought to
[1:56:47] be able to say right now
[1:56:50] well my best experience was back when I
[1:56:52] first got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:56:54] when I come first come then say Oh
[1:56:56] Brother you have fallen from
[1:56:58] Grace that's right you've left your
[1:57:01] first love showing that they had
[1:57:03] something in the beginning that they
[1:57:04] left it not not he that Beth but he that
[1:57:07] endureth to the end the same shall be
[1:57:09] saved not he all that saith Lord Lord
[1:57:12] not all that say Lord Lord will come in
[1:57:14] oh let me just let that soak in just a
[1:57:16] minute I was talking fast tonight anyhow
[1:57:19] so let us let that soak in a minute he
[1:57:22] that doeth the will of my father he that
[1:57:23] endureth to the end he that endureth if
[1:57:25] somebody say I believe he that that guy
[1:57:28] over there he's an old hypocrite well if
[1:57:30] you think that about me I'll just leave
[1:57:32] church I won't have any more to do with
[1:57:34] it all right there you are it shows What
[1:57:37] You're Made Of so somebody called him a
[1:57:39] hypocrite say I'll just leave that
[1:57:40] church I'll go somewhere
[1:57:42] else
[1:57:45] immaturity brother if it was a wheat to
[1:57:47] begin with it'll be a wheat at the end
[1:57:49] you just never stayed long enough down
[1:57:50] here you never make the thing right
[1:57:52] that's right remember therefore from
[1:57:53] when I Fallen go back and remember when
[1:57:55] you used to have the experience where
[1:57:57] you wouldn't talk about nobody you used
[1:57:59] to have the experience you wouldn't talk
[1:58:00] no about anybody anything went wrong in
[1:58:02] the church you didn't sit on your
[1:58:03] neighbor's steps over there and talk
[1:58:05] about the
[1:58:08] church I'm correcting some things from
[1:58:11] this
[1:58:14] quote when you had a real true
[1:58:16] experience with God anything that went
[1:58:17] wrong in the church you didn't sit at
[1:58:18] the neighbor step over there and talk
[1:58:20] about the church and talk about
[1:58:21] everybody else and fly loose and go join
[1:58:23] another church no you stayed right there
[1:58:27] patiently and prayed it out and God
[1:58:31] brought it on through when was your
[1:58:33] experience dearest to you oh it was back
[1:58:35] when I first got the Holy Ghost he says
[1:58:37] you've fallen for Grace you ought to be
[1:58:39] able to say right now is my closest
[1:58:42] experience with
[1:58:44] God because this is a
[1:58:46] journey this is It's be what I got back
[1:58:49] then has only become more real now
[1:58:52] brings confidence it brings rest that he
[1:58:54] had millions of attributes in his mind
[1:58:56] and I'm one of those attributes one of
[1:58:57] those qualities one of those features an
[1:58:59] inherent characteristic of God and I'm
[1:59:02] one of God's qualities I'll tell you
[1:59:03] that brings confidence it brings
[1:59:05] Assurance it brings rest in the Holy
[1:59:07] Ghost can you say amen and in who mzed
[1:59:10] again he says and that's the way with a
[1:59:12] Christian Hallelujah we know musicians
[1:59:16] can come as long as everybody listens to
[1:59:18] me now and that's away with a Christian
[1:59:20] Hallelujah we know when we walk into the
[1:59:22] presence of God something in US tells us
[1:59:25] that we come from somewhere and we're
[1:59:28] going back by that power that's pulling
[1:59:32] us when we come into the presence of God
[1:59:36] something tell us tells us that we came
[1:59:38] from somewhere and this thing is pulling
[1:59:41] us back to where we
[1:59:45] belong there's a power that goes with
[1:59:47] this Hebrews 7 7 15 can you guys put
[1:59:50] that
[1:59:54] up he refers to mzc again in this spot
[1:59:57] and Mark this down or in in your head
[1:59:59] remember to read this Hebrews 7:15 and
[2:00:02] it is yet far more evident that after
[2:00:03] the similitude of mzc there ariseth
[2:00:06] another priest who is made not after the
[2:00:11] law of a carnal commandment but after
[2:00:14] the power of an endless
[2:00:17] life when you connect with the
[2:00:19] revelation of mezc you connect with the
[2:00:23] with an endless life eternal
[2:00:26] life and guess what it has a power with
[2:00:31] it it's not just a religion not
[2:00:33] something I don't know if I'm in today I
[2:00:35] I have a bunch of no no no it's an
[2:00:37] endless life because you've tapped into
[2:00:39] a power of an endless life that's the
[2:00:41] mystery of mzc brother BR goes on to say
[2:00:44] when we come into the presence of God we
[2:00:46] know that we are come from somewhere
[2:00:49] where and we're going back again by that
[2:00:50] power that's pulling us that little Dew
[2:00:54] Drop he glistens and shines and shouts
[2:00:57] how many's ever seen a DW drop in the
[2:01:00] morning on a blade of grass millions of

[2:01:37] is actually reflecting us that he's
[2:01:40] there and he's he said and and and a man
[2:01:43] that's an attribute of God born of God
[2:01:44] knows Hallelujah when he come into
[2:01:46] contact with the Son of God he's going

[2:02:05] the more the sun comes up he's he's
[2:02:08] shouting a little bit
[2:02:10] more he's excited you ever see a little
[2:02:13] dud drop quivering like that or just
