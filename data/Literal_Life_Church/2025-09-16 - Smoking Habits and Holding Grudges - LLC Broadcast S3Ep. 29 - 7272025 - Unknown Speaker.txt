TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine and Literal Life Church in Petersburg, Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God. If you're hungry for more God, we believe you can be fed. And we pray that you'll be blessed. Visit our website for more information at literalife.urch. May God bless you, my friend. May the music and message encourage you today. You made a covenant with me. Signed by the blood that still speaks. Now I'm forgi. I'm called righteous. I'm made clean. Thank you, Lord. There on the cross at Calvary, you gave it all to purchase me. You are the savior and the god who sets me free. Now my heart cries. This is my redeemer. with my whole life. I will give you praise, all the glory to the one who's worthy because of Jesus. I have been changed. You made a way for me to enter into your holy place forever. And now I'm hidden. I am covered. I found peace. And into your likeness, you transform me, making me holy like you're holy. No longer I live, but Christ who lives in me. Now my heart cries. This is my redeemer. And with my whole life I will give you praise. All the glory to the one who is worthy. Because of Jesus I have been changed. You will bring freedom to the captives and good news to the poor. Healing to the broken and joy to those you mourn. You turn ashes into beauty. The ruins you restore. I am a testimony of the goodness of the Lord. You bring freedom to the captives, good news to the poor, healing to the broken, and join the mine. You turn ashes into the ruins you. I am a testimony of the goodness of the Lord. Now my heart cries, this is my redeemer and with my heart I will give you praise all the glory to the one who because of Jesus I have been changed. Because of Jesus, I have been changed because of Jesus. I have been changed. &gt;&gt; Leviticus 19 and verse 17 and 18. If you read with me, thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart. Where? In thine heart. Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and suffer and not suffer sin upon him. Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people. But thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. I am the Lord. There's another scripture in Proverbs 19 I will add to this is if I get to it to refer to it but it also is related to this. Proverbs 19 and verse 11. The discretion of a man defereth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression. I want you to notice here now we we have uh we have our interpretation of what the glory of the Lord is. &gt;&gt; And I believe we're experiencing the glory of the Lord in this place this morning. &gt;&gt; I believe the glory of the Lord can do many things to let us know his presence is here. But let us not limit the glory of the Lord because this man when he when he defers his anger and when he passes over a transgression then there's a glory in that as well. &gt;&gt; Don't limit the glory of God. &gt;&gt; So when this man forgives this when when this man releases and he passes over a transgression and he lets that anger flow away from his heart and his heart is clear. There is a glory of God in that. &gt;&gt; There's a glory of God in that. &gt;&gt; So this morning I I'd like to speak a little bit on and this is a strange title. Smoking habits and holding grudges. I figured I would get that response. Smoking habits and holding grudges. And you don't understand why my title is that, but you'll understand in just a minute. A few weeks ago, I read Markap 11. When I was reading Mark 11, which is a well-known scripture for the authority of the believer, uh most of you should know it. If you don't know it, it's where Jesus refers to mountain moving faith. And if you say to this mountain, be thou removed and cast into the sea, whatsoever things you desire in your heart, that which the father will give. And so, it's probably one of the most important scriptures. This is what the bride is entering into more and more. And that is that authority and faith to be able to say to this mountain, "Be thou removed." If you believe in your heart, can you say amen? And and the heart is right. Then we realize that it comes into this place of perfect faith. If ye say to this mountain and don't doubt in your heart, you you you you know this scripture well. You know this section of scripture well. Many preachers have preached on it and as they should preach on it because I believe this is something the bride more and more comes into. But what what amazed me is the attachment of the scriptures and the things Jesus said close to it. And you can't detach it, but he attached the importance of forgiveness right next to it. And when you stand praying, forgive. &gt;&gt; Now, you can preach Mark 11 all you want to, but if you're leaving out the rest of Mark 11 on forgiveness, you're not preaching the whole picture. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're going to preach Mark 11, preach the whole picture of Mark 11. Not just that we have the faith to speak to the mountain, but what is the conditions of our heart? What is the place we put ourselves in as a believer that we could actually come in that God could trust us enough to say to this mountain, "Be thou removed." &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but that's my desire. I'll go ahead and tell you my desire this morning. I was praying here last night, praying at the church, praying in this little room here quietly with the Lord. And I'll tell you, uh, something happened to me because as I begin to see what this forgiveness really is. But my desire is that my prayer would have power behind it. My desire is that when I go to pray or lay hands on somebody that there is an effect. There's not too many other goals or desires that I have in this life. And this should be every believer's desire that we when when we pray, it is the prayer of faith. And our prayer is an effectual and a fervent prayer that bombards heaven and gets the job done. &gt;&gt; What else do we have left? &gt;&gt; There are situations that I hardly can't deal with today and all I'm left with is prayer. And if all I'm left with is prayer, I want my prayer to mean something. I want my prayer to get through. Is anybody else in agreement that Mark 11 should be manifesting in the bride? That there's meaning behind our prayer and it's not just saying a prayer, but it's the prayer of faith that gets the results. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; That's my desire. And so now he brings in this this importance of forgiveness because this is the realms that the bride is called to. And we cannot ignore any part that gives us entrance into this. I want to know what's the entrance into me Mark chapter 11. What's the entrance? So you say faith comes by you say well faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. How many knows that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. But you cannot hear the word right unless your heart is right. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If there's something laying in your heart like unforgiveness, &gt;&gt; you're not even hearing the word right for it to build your faith. &gt;&gt; And that's why he puts this forgiveness at a level that is so is is just as important in as if you say to this mountain, forgiveness cannot be ignored. The freeing of the heart can never be ignored. So now the to so if you're going to preach Mark 11, you have to preach the rest of the story. Isn't that what Paul Harvey said? This is the rest of the story. &gt;&gt; You can't preach Mark 11 without preaching about forgiveness. &gt;&gt; That's right. You can't preach Mark 11 faith without preaching not having ought against another &gt;&gt; because it is the whole picture of everything. We we would all agree that the glory of the Lord would be present to see Mark 11 in action. We'd all agree that the glory of the Lord would be present to see Mark 11 in action. But in the proverb that we read, it speaks of a glory of a on a man that is the power of forgiveness. He he overlooks a matter. He releases a matter. He defers his anger towards someone. When he does that, there's a glory of the Lord that's in that. There's a power. We know there's glory in saying to this mountain, but there's a glory in the Lord when you forgive &gt;&gt; from your heart. &gt;&gt; We may not see the results of that. But nevertheless, the glory is in a man who defers his anger and overlooks a transgression. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Ah, praise the Lord. I want that kind of glory. And so when we come into that truly it is it is of God. This glory is of God and it sets us up into a freedom in us that empties us out. Empties us out and makes more room for more of his glory. &gt;&gt; Can I say it again? &gt;&gt; What is Why is he teaching on forgiveness? Because it empties us out of things that are shadows in our hearts. &gt;&gt; That's good. So it empties us out so that more of his glory &gt;&gt; can work in our vessel. I want to remind you all that the power of Calvary was released to us when he died. The full power of redemption was released to us when he died. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He said when he died the whole earth shook. It was such an incident and redemption was finished for sons and daughters of God. And it pulled sons and daughters of God, not only Jesus but other sons that had died in him. It pulled them into the power of resurrection. When Jesus died, it triggered a resurrection and the saints come out of the grave. When he cried from the cross and says, "It is finished. It was completely finished." And now not only him but sons could enter into resurrection power. &gt;&gt; And so that was the power of resurrection. But moments before the resurrection power came, before these are the words that came from Jesus as he looked at those that were shaming him, gossiping at him, falsely accusing him, beating him, scorging him, gossiping against him, embarrassing him. He looked at those people and he said, "Father, forgive them. for they don't know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; They're doing this, but they don't know what they're doing. And so, he released a forgiveness. The power of forgiveness was released to them. And none of those people even deserved it. Can I get an amen this morning? They didn't deserve getting any forgiveness. But I'm here to say, the power of forgiveness was released before the p other powers and the power of resurrection came. There was something that was released in him to say, "I forgive you. Forgive them, Father. They don't know what they're doing." Forgiveness. And the power of forgiveness was released before the power of resurrection was released. &gt;&gt; Maybe that's why Jesus put it in Mark 11. Maybe we shouldn't look down so much and try to hide things, but to say, "Lord, I really need to release all of my aught in my heart &gt;&gt; against those who've done me wrong, &gt;&gt; sir." If we're really serious about more faith, if we're really serious about walking in the precepts where the bride should be walking, if we're going to preach it and we're going to say amen to that, then we have to say amen to say, "God, change my heart. Soften my heart that I can release this forgiveness in me and release this au in me and forgive those who have done me wrong." You may be there this morning and I say, "Praise God, you're further along than a lot of the rest of us. God bless you, brother Paul. I don't have any odd against it. I'm a free person. People have done me wrong. I've released it like the maturity of Joseph to say what they did in evil. God has turned it to my good. That's the only way I'm going to look at it. That's my predestinated trials. Every evil that's been done to me, every gossip, it's turned to my good. God bless you. But for those of the rest of us who have things come along that you hold there, &gt;&gt; I pray that you could leave this morning with it released. But when we leave, I pray that we would leave because Jesus released the power and the height of forgiveness was released and all the other power was released after resurrection. All power, in fact, he said the words in Matthew 28:18, "All power is given unto me in heaven and earth." Full authority was given when full forgiveness was given. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you've ever heard this before. You probably have, but I want to emphasize it over and over again that with Jesus, the full and complete authority was released until he said all power is given to me in heaven and earth. The full power was released and authority when all forgiveness was released. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Peter's last words, excuse me, Steven's last words as he was stoned while he was being stoned, laying out this sin to their charge. &gt;&gt; And he left, but the heavens opened up to him. &gt;&gt; The glory of the Lord opened up to him. &gt;&gt; Are you listening this morning? &gt;&gt; While they were stoning him, Stephen said, "Lord, don't lay this sin to their charge." So why my title that says smoking habits and holding grudges? This is it from a quote. Brother Brand says in 1957, "Now while you're praying, shut in with God." There was those who raised their hands uh that wanted to walk with God, wanted to open their hearts to him. The altar is open now, my friend. I'd invite each one of you to come here at the altar and kneel down and say, "Lord Jesus, be merciful. I want you to come into my heart. Move all my fears. Move all my selfishness. Move everything out and come in. Come into my heart and be Lord. Oh, I believe you're my savior, but you haven't been my Lord. &gt;&gt; How many know there's a difference? &gt;&gt; There's a difference in just being savior and being lord. That means he takes up housekeeping and takes control of this vessel. &gt;&gt; That means if there's something that's odd, there's something that's wrong, it has to be released for him to fully set up housekeeping. I don't just want him to be my savior. I want him to be my lord. Now look at this. It's just a small statement. And now this is a discernment. He looks at this brother and and if you read the messages, you see the discernment. Uh when that ca came on him and he knew those things, it was accurate. He could see their life. He could see their doctor talking. He could tell their name. He could their house number, their street number. And and brother Brandham did not know that. But God knows. It tells us God knows all things about us. &gt;&gt; He knows your house number. He knows the trial your family's going through. He's completely aware. probably more than you are of your problems. &gt;&gt; And he proved this by that son of man gift working through a vessel like brother Brandham. God bless you, brother. This man name is Davis. He comes from Virginia. He's here to give up a habit of smoking and a little grudge that he's held in his heart against a loved one since he was a child. And when I read that, I thought, "Oh my, there's my sermon." &gt;&gt; That's what he's at the altar for this morning. &gt;&gt; This is things we come to the altar for. &gt;&gt; Now, first of all, I don't really have to preach against smoking. At least, I hope I don't have to. If you've got that filthy habit in your life and it's been proved over and over again for many many years of the damages to your body, I think when we come to smoking, there's no benefit to it. And yet people are so uh pretend they're so addicted that they'll actually know that it causes damage. My grandpa and Grandma Le Fontaine died of lung cancer and up until the end she's smoking those just smoking, smoking and smoking and she knew knows what it's going to do. Other family members died. How can a person know that and do it? That's how much an addiction can take you. &gt;&gt; And that's how much a person can hold tightly on to something &gt;&gt; even if it's doing them damage. Right. &gt;&gt; So my question to you is if that can happen with a smoking habit which everybody knows then this other thing that this man come to the altar for and I don't even know if he knew about the other thing. This is brother Brandon discerning this is what you're at the altar for. I think the other part was hidden since he was a child that he was holding a grudge. He might not have even known. But I want to make the point whether it's being released of a habit of smoking or whether it's being released of a grudge, it's the same thing. It's still something that holds on to a person. &gt;&gt; And this, brother, it was his whole life. &gt;&gt; What was it? Some vegetarian? No. A grudge &gt;&gt; against a family member. &gt;&gt; We don't know what it was, but it was a a grudge. And he's at the altar to pray. This is his need. This is his name. This is where he's from. And he's got two things. And to us, it looks like two very separate things. That's why I've said before recently in the past is that we have healing lines and and and prayer lines for deliverance of demons and deliverance of diseases. If this is true, where's the prayer lines to pray for grudges? Because here to me, I don't see it too much as being two things that were holding this man, holding him down, holding his heart against a loved one. And they're both things that binding him, and both things he needed to be delivered from. Can you say amen? He is at the altar for a smoking habit and a grudge. And I guess he needed freedom from both. It was all the way since he was a child that he held a grudge. How long can a person hold a grudge? &gt;&gt; How long can a person hold a grudge? He wants us to forgive and release grudges. Why? They are bad. And I want to safely say this morning, they're just as bad as smoking. Smoking is bad, right? We all agree. All the young people, everybody, smoking is bad. Both are dangerous. Smoking has years of research showing cancer and other things coming from it. And yet someone when they hold on to a habit, when they hold on to that, they think it's not doing that much damage. But over time, it's doing damage. People know the re the research and still hold on to it. But is the same with a grudge against someone, it has terrible damage as well. That's why they hold on. Lord, deliver me from this nicotine spirit. Sometimes they will say but nothing in their unforgiving spirit that they've had in a grudge for years in the science. Science says forgiveness reduces stress and improves health. Holding on to grudges causes and I you know you can look at this yourself. I don't want to read a lot of science or the psychology about about it but holding on to grudges this is clearly science now. This is not uh any from any Christian source. Holding on to grudges causes chronic stress, which harms your health and well-being. Forgiving others lowers stress hormones like cortisol decreases blood pressure and leads to a stronger immune system. It also lowers the risk of depression and anxiety. Studies show forgiveness even slows aging and increases longevity. &gt;&gt; Boy, do I ever need to forgive &gt;&gt; because I want to live a little longer. So you know this is science and you know what if you think that these inward heart things don't affect you physically go through the prayer lines and find out as he would say you can be healed of this but the real core problem was this thing and it wasn't a physical problem it became a physical why does the Bible say say laughter doeth good like a medicine &gt;&gt; if you're happy and you're free and you're laughing that is a medicine even for your own physical body &gt;&gt; that's why I miss my had he could come and sing the laughing song this morning. I watched him sing the laughing song all over this country and he made people laugh they hadn't laughed in 30 years. I'm telling you, they were healthier because they just learned how to laugh again. Some people need to learn how to laugh again. &gt;&gt; Some people need to learn how to smile again. Some people don't have the happiness in the Lord because the way they look at me in church sometimes while I'm preaching, I can tell something is wrong. I can't do anything to make them smile. But you need something in your life to release these whatever it is in your in in your body that makes you happy. And then it says when you forgive, science says it leads to changes in your brain that improve your ability to regulate emotions and reactions. Activity in the amdala which I hope I'm saying that right. Magdala which processes fear and anger decreases areas linked to empathy. Positive feelings and emotional control become more active. What? When we forgive. &gt;&gt; This rewiring makes you less reactive and more compassionate over time. This rewiring. How many want to be rewired this morning? &gt;&gt; Not by psychology, but by the Holy Ghost happiness. Amen. &gt;&gt; The kingdom of God is not meat and drink. The kingdom not is not just a dress code, but it's righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; This life is a life and it should be of joy in the Holy Ghost on Monday, on Tuesday. Why aren't you enjoying the joy of the Holy Ghost? But beyond that, what we're preaching on this morning, it's a hindrance to mountain moving faith. How many want mountainoving faith? This this lack of forgiveness is a hindrance to mountainoving faith. It is a hidden stronghold that limits the authority and the confidence of the believer. Brother Bram says in 1963 our number one heart disease the main thing that kills people today it's the number isn't it interesting he says s heart disease he said the number one disease I don't know if it's still today but it is a major thing heart disease isn't that the something that the natural types the spiritual man they already can prove that a man that holds grudges and a woman who fuss and stew and fight and argue they die it'll cause cancer fungus, everything else will set in. Ulcers is confirming what I read in science. All right. So, you were made to be happy and free. There's my sermon this morning. &gt;&gt; Smoking habits and holding grudges. &gt;&gt; Why do we have to get rid of them? Because you were made to be free and happy. &gt;&gt; And this isn't some seminar on trying to the 10 steps to make you happy. This is happiness in the Holy Ghost. This is happiness God purchased at Calvary. &gt;&gt; That the dark shadows over your life and the guilt over your life and the things that make you you can't even hardly fellowship with the rest of the believers because this dark shadow hangs over you. Listen, if you've done something in your past, bring it under the blood of Jesus Christ. Accept his forgiveness. Accept his pardon because a pardon isn't a pardon until it's accepted as a pardon. I believe the Lord has forgiven and washed away all of my sins. And today I look at one thing and that's my future with the Lord. The past is in the sea of forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; He does that to make us truly happy and joyful. He can look and see there ain't no shadows there. &gt;&gt; G. &gt;&gt; He has forgiven all. &gt;&gt; He's free. &gt;&gt; Now I can use him more effectively. Now his faith in the word takes a different level, a perfect faith. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Thank you for watching our service today.
