[26:59] this Wednesday night. Praise the Lord.
[27:01] God is good. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[27:07] Praise God.
[27:10] Uh well, I want to testify this morning.
[27:13] Uh that's why I didn't write it out if
[27:14] you were wondering. I'm just excited for
[27:17] what the Lord has done in our lives. And
[27:20] um if I were to tell you everything,
[27:23] there's so many little miracles that
[27:25] have happened through all of this in my
[27:27] own personal life. I've gotten so much
[27:30] closer to the Lord in the last eight
[27:32] weeks. Uh even and God has just been so
[27:36] good to me uh on the inside and and on
[27:38] the outside.
[27:40] Praise God. in my flesh and uh and in my
[27:44] spirit. So, I can't complain at all. No
[27:47] complaints. So, we're praising God. Um
[27:51] the Bible says they overcame by the
[27:53] blood of the lamb and the word of their
[27:56] testimony. And so, I just want to
[27:58] testify today that um we have uh been
[28:02] through a lot. Um but we feel like we're
[28:06] not victims, we're victorious. and the
[28:09] the the children of God have a right to
[28:13] um certain positive promises from the
[28:16] word of God. And we've been standing on
[28:19] those promises through the good times
[28:20] and the bad times. And as the songs all
[28:23] said today, uh he's still God in the,
[28:26] you know, no matter what we go through,
[28:28] he's just as powerful. And if he did it
[28:31] back then, he can do it today. If he
[28:32] made the sun stand still back then, he
[28:35] can do it today. And that's what we're
[28:37] trusting in. And I believe that God has
[28:40] been even through the sermons building
[28:42] our faith and uh and coming to this
[28:46] climax. Um we've been to a lot of
[28:49] different radiologist in the last um few
[28:52] months. Uh our first radiologist here in
[28:56] Parisburg
[28:57] uh had a certain treatment plan and we
[29:00] did that five weeks and the Cleveland
[29:03] Clinic had agreed with that. So we felt
[29:05] really a peace every time we went to
[29:07] radiation every day for five weeks uh
[29:10] every day of the week. We felt peace and
[29:12] we did not feel fear and we just knew
[29:15] that God was doing something and and
[29:18] with his people praying exactly at 3:00
[29:20] every day. Every time I went in there, I
[29:22] would get a host of texts and messages
[29:25] saying, "We're praying for you." And we
[29:28] appreciate those prayers. Especially uh
[29:30] the prayers of the children have been
[29:32] very powerful because I've noticed that
[29:34] when I ask them for prayer then all of a
[29:36] sudden I feel lots better. And so I
[29:39] believe that the children have just as
[29:41] much of the Jesus in their heart and
[29:43] power of prayer is definitely been um
[29:46] what's gotten us through all of this.
[29:49] So the exciting thing is that um we uh I
[29:55] want to give a little bit of background
[29:57] before I I um tell you the exciting news
[30:00] which you guys have already heard
[30:01] through the text but it's exciting
[30:04] because um after going through five
[30:07] weeks we our insurance got denied from
[30:11] Cleveland Clinic part of it and so we
[30:14] were like what the day that they called
[30:17] us back we
[30:18] I remember talking to my daughter-in-law
[30:20] and I said, "The footsteps of the
[30:22] righteous are ordered of the Lord." I
[30:25] don't know why, but I just kept saying
[30:26] that over and over. The footsteps of the
[30:29] righteous are there's a reason for this.
[30:31] I'm not going to get upset at the
[30:33] doctors. The doctors don't are not in
[30:36] control, folks. Hello. And so, uh, I'm
[30:39] not going to get upset at them. I'm not
[30:41] going to get upset at the insurance
[30:44] company. You know, they're not in
[30:45] control either. God is in control of our
[30:48] lives and the footsteps of the righteous
[30:51] or order of the Lord. And so they sent
[30:53] us to the U ofM
[30:56] and the first day I actually met them in
[30:58] person. They were supposed to do a
[31:00] treatment and they were going with a
[31:02] different plan of treatments and I did
[31:04] not feel settled in my heart about that
[31:05] at that time. But I just thought, well,
[31:08] you know, if this is what God wants,
[31:10] we're just going to go. And everything
[31:12] went wrong that day. Everything went
[31:15] wrong. And it wasn't the staff's fault.
[31:17] It was just uh just the Lord putting,
[31:20] you know, slamming the door on doing
[31:22] that treatment. And so it was um their
[31:26] MRI machine went down. That was one of
[31:28] the things, you know. So after a long
[31:31] day there, uh I was in terrible pain and
[31:35] I and they sent just sent me home. They
[31:37] said, "We're we're not going to do any
[31:38] treatment on you. We'll just send you
[31:40] home and we'll come up with something."
[31:41] Well, I got home. We were going on
[31:43] vacation the next week and I was in so
[31:45] much pain for a whole week that I just
[31:47] said, "Listen, I'm going to go ahead and
[31:50] just postpone anything right now. We're
[31:53] going to go on vacation and have fun and
[31:56] then when we'll pray about it all while
[31:58] we're on vacation. When we come back,
[31:59] we'll see what the Lord has." So, when
[32:01] we got home, they sent us to um and all
[32:04] of this time, for the last eight weeks,
[32:07] I've been in the emergency room eight
[32:09] times. I've been in an ambulance one
[32:11] time. Uh I have been extremely sick,
[32:15] sicker than I've ever been in my whole
[32:17] life, even through chemo, not able to
[32:20] keep anything down uh at all. And just
[32:23] um still still right now at this point
[32:26] just eating mostly
[32:28] uh applesauce and mashed potatoes. And
[32:32] uh I just think I I just keep thanking
[32:34] the Lord for mashed potatoes
[32:38] even though it's not keto friendly,
[32:41] but but I praise the Lord for applesauce
[32:44] and mashed potatoes. Anyways, um to get
[32:48] through uh the next phase, my
[32:51] radiologist sent me to another doctor,
[32:54] get one more opinion. We were hoping
[32:55] that this guy was the the one that would
[32:58] kind of really settle in our hearts. you
[33:01] know what we're going to do now. And so
[33:03] we got there, he explained the different
[33:06] kinds of treatments. He explained why
[33:09] the one that I was going to do at
[33:12] Cleveland Clinic, he didn't agree with
[33:13] that one. And as he's talking, all three
[33:17] of us, me and Vanessa and Henry, are
[33:19] just getting more and more down and down
[33:21] and down because what we thought was
[33:23] going to be like, "This is what we're
[33:26] doing," uh, just ended up being more and
[33:30] more confusing and more and more scary
[33:32] as he talked about the side effects of
[33:35] every single treatment. And there was
[33:37] going to be side effects no matter what,
[33:38] by the way. and what from what they've
[33:41] said. Now, praise God, I haven't had a
[33:44] lot of side effects from chemo because
[33:45] of your prayers. And so, that's the
[33:49] exciting thing is that we have a God
[33:51] that can control all of these things.
[33:54] So,
[33:55] uh we we're get in the car and it's
[33:57] always real quiet when we're all
[33:59] thinking, you know, nobody's talking and
[34:02] I'm just thinking, Sharon, what did you
[34:05] expect? You know, did you expect the
[34:07] doctor to have the answer? No, he
[34:10] doesn't have the answer. God has the
[34:12] answer. God knows what I'm supposed to
[34:14] do. The footsteps of the righteous are
[34:17] ordered of the Lord. So, this delayed us
[34:20] a little bit while longer while I'm
[34:21] getting healthy. And my radiologist
[34:23] said, "Let's just put a pin in all
[34:25] this." Well, the guy at Henry Ford said,
[34:27] "We got to do another MRI." This is like
[34:30] my 15th MRI, folks. No, not really. I'm
[34:33] just exaggerating. But so I said, "Okay,
[34:36] we'll do another MRI." Good. We said,
[34:38] "Good. This will give us a chance for
[34:41] the Lord to heal me completely and I
[34:43] won't have to do all of this bad stuff.
[34:46] I don't have to make a decision between
[34:48] this bad thing and this bad thing." And
[34:51] so I said, "Praise God." So we started
[34:54] praying. You guys started praying. And I
[34:57] put it out there for Facebook family to
[34:59] pray. And I believed with all my heart
[35:03] that it was just going to be gone and I
[35:05] wouldn't have to worry about. And every
[35:06] time I talked about it to on the phone
[35:08] to somebody or whatever, we would talk,
[35:11] yeah, either I have to do this or do
[35:13] this. And you just feel the tension and
[35:15] the stress. And then at the end of the
[35:17] conversation, I would always say, but
[35:19] God is able just to take it completely
[35:21] and then I won't have to worry about all
[35:23] this, you know. And so we went to the
[35:26] MRI.
[35:28] Um, the day before the MRI, I had
[35:30] amunotherapy and I have an oncologist in
[35:33] in Toledo that does my amunotherapy and
[35:36] he's a professional. He's incredible at
[35:39] all the stuff that has deals with chemo.
[35:42] And I he was walking out of the room and
[35:45] we're friends by now because we've been
[35:47] I've been with him for like three years
[35:49] or something. and he knows me and I know
[35:51] him. And I just looked at him and I
[35:53] said, "I'm praying that it's going to be
[35:56] gone tomorrow when they do the MRI." And
[36:00] he just kind of chuckled. He put his
[36:01] hand on my shoulder and he goes, "I hope
[36:03] you're right." And you know, of course,
[36:06] he didn't believe that that was right,
[36:07] but he said, "I hope you're right." So
[36:10] that was um that was funny. But anyway,
[36:13] the next day they did the MRI and this
[36:16] Tuesday got the phone call from my
[36:18] regular radiologist in Parisburg that
[36:21] the tumor is completely gone
[36:25] and that God has completely removed it
[36:27] from my body.
[36:33] So, we're going to sing a song uh that
[36:36] the Lord gave me several years ago, and
[36:39] Paul helped me a little bit with the
[36:40] verses, I think, but we're just praising
[36:42] God that he's the same yesterday, today,
[36:45] and forever.
[36:48] Wonderful.
[36:50] [Music]
[37:01] I look back
[37:03] on history,
[37:06] see the mighty God
[37:09] unveiled,
[37:12] proving
[37:13] over and over
[37:16] that his word can never fail.
[37:22] But I can't keep on dwelling
[37:26] on some past memory.
[37:31] Cuz now that same God
[37:34] is living
[37:36] in me.
[37:42] The same God
[37:44] who spoke you.
[37:47] at
[37:49] the well.
[37:51] The same God
[37:54] whose wonders
[37:56] too many
[37:58] to tell.
[38:01] The same God
[38:04] who parted
[38:06] the raing
[38:09] sea.
[38:14] The same God
[38:16] who's living
[38:18] in me.
[38:22] [Music]
[38:24] The same God who created
[38:28] all the heavens and all the earth.
[38:34] He came back living in Jesus.
[38:38] And there was power
[38:40] in his word.
[38:43] But now in these last days,
[38:48] I'm beginning
[38:50] to see
[38:55] that it's that same God
[38:58] who's living
[39:00] in me.
[39:05] The same God
[39:08] who spoke you.
[39:10] The woman at
[39:13] the will.
[39:15] The same God
[39:18] whose wonders
[39:20] too heavy
[39:22] to tell.
[39:26] Sing
[39:28] the heartened
[39:30] the raing
[39:33] se
[39:40] [Music]
[39:42] in me.
[39:47] Oh, the same God
[39:50] who spoke you
[39:55] well.
[39:58] The same God
[40:00] who wonders
[40:03] too.
[40:04] [Music]
[40:08] The same God
[40:10] who pardoned
[40:13] the raing
[40:15] sea.
[40:20] He's the same God
[40:22] who's living
[40:25] in me.
[40:28] Oh,
[40:30] he's the same God
[40:33] who's living
[40:35] in me.
[40:37] [Music]
[40:44] Hallelujah. Give praise to the Lord. We
[40:47] have reason to celebrate. Praise God.
[40:51] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[40:55] This means so much.
[40:57] That the Lord has answered in this way
[40:59] for our family. You don't know until
[41:02] you've been there. and and not even me.
[41:04] Until you've been in that position that
[41:06] Sharon and Henry and Vanessa have been
[41:08] in, you don't know what it's like going
[41:09] through it. And that's the time you
[41:11] really need to see the promise of God
[41:14] come through for you. So, we give praise
[41:16] to Almighty God today. We're thankful
[41:18] for him. I'm thankful for mashed
[41:21] potatoes, too, and applesauce.
[41:25] I
[41:28] I only get them once a year, but
[41:32] I'm much more thankful for when God
[41:34] answers back in such a big way. That
[41:37] tumor is gone. I want to let the devil
[41:39] know today that tumor is gone. It's
[41:42] gone. Somebody praise the Lord.
[41:46] [Music]
[41:51] Oh, rejoice.
[41:52] [Music]
[41:54] Look what the Lord has done.
[41:59] The darkness at the rising of the sun.j
[42:05] Rejoice
[42:08] and look where he's brought us.
[42:12] Just stop and think about it and look
[42:15] what the Lord has done.
[42:19] I remember
[42:21] I was living in darkness.
[42:26] He shine the light around me so I could
[42:29] see my way out.
[42:33] And when the lamb rose to claim, I can
[42:38] really s.
[42:41] And when I start to think about it, I
[42:46] shall
[42:47] rejoice.j
[42:50] [Music]
[42:55] in the darkness afterj
[43:00] [Music]
[43:05] [Music]
[43:13] [Music]
[43:17] trying to keep us defeated. Ain't that
[43:20] the truth?
[43:22] He always seems to point us to
[43:25] everything that's going wrong.
[43:29] I will only keep the eyes
[43:33] on the message of life.
[43:37] The joy begin
[43:40] [Music]
[44:05] Stop and think about it. What the Lord
[44:08] has done
[44:11] [Music]
[44:13] to come and save me.
[44:16] How he forgave me.
[44:19] Gave power to overcome

[44:27] What the Lord has done
[44:36] is
[44:41] [Music]
[44:49] [Music]
[44:54] [Music]
[45:00] Think about it. Ain't no time glory.
[45:04] Hallelujah for
[45:06] you.
[45:08] and look what the Lord has done.
[45:15] [Music]
[45:16] [Applause]
[45:22] Hallelujah.
[45:24] Praise be to God.
[45:26] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[45:33] Let's see the scriptures this morning.
[45:35] It's hard to preach now because you just
[45:37] want to spend the rest of the day and
[45:38] praise the Lord. He deserves it. Can you
[45:41] say amen? Praise the Lord. I know
[45:43] there's been besides Sister Sharon many
[45:46] victories this last couple weeks and
[45:49] we've had some of those testimonies, but
[45:51] don't ever let the devil tell you that
[45:54] God's not doing things. He's doing
[45:55] things both inwardly and outwardly,
[45:58] physically, mentally, emotionally. Our
[46:01] God is among us. Can you say amen? And
[46:04] he proves himself when there's faith. He
[46:07] proves himself to help you to overcome
[46:09] in every situation and everything the
[46:11] devil is using to intimidate us. Praise
[46:14] the Lord. We love the Lord today. We
[46:15] appreciate his goodness. And we wanted
[46:17] to give sister Sharon that time to give
[46:20] the devil a black eye and a testimony.
[46:22] They overcame by the blood of the lamb
[46:24] and by the word of their testimony. And
[46:27] uh so we don't mind giving time to that.
[46:29] That we got to let the devil know today
[46:31] that God is in charge. Can you say amen?
[46:33] Praise the Lord. We know God's will is
[46:36] in these things. And you know, we are
[46:39] we, you know, I've had brothers tell me
[46:41] that either way we win. And it could
[46:43] have went either way. That's up to the
[46:45] Lord. Our duty is to stand upon this
[46:47] word that he says he's the same
[46:49] yesterday, today, and forever. And we
[46:51] don't move from that promise. Can you
[46:52] say amen? We don't move from that
[46:54] stance. Uh what God does from that is up
[46:56] to him. And either way, Christians win
[46:59] either way. But we rejoice and we always
[47:02] like to put it out there and let the
[47:04] people know and our young people, our
[47:07] children need to see this isn't a God of
[47:09] history. He's the same God today. You
[47:13] watch uh if the children watch the Jesus
[47:17] different films and movies on Jesus and
[47:19] they see what he did 2,000 years ago,
[47:21] they ought to come to church and be able
[47:23] to hear that Jesus is doing the same
[47:24] thing. And I can tell you children, he
[47:27] does the same. He's not changed in any
[47:29] way. I'm going to read from 1st Samuel
[47:31] chapter 19 today. If you'd go back in
[47:33] the Old Testament with me and we'll read
[47:36] a um section, just a couple scriptures
[47:38] here. Many others we could add to it,
[47:40] but we'll just take this thought and God
[47:43] richly bless you all. And we are
[47:45] rejoicing. Excuse us for a little bit of
[47:47] nasal. We're still coming out of a a
[47:49] head cold this week. And I know many of
[47:52] you sent some prayers even this morning.
[47:54] We appreciate the prayers this week for
[47:56] our family as we watch that thing kind
[47:58] of go through our different homes and
[47:59] the runny noses and different things.
[48:01] And so hopefully this nasal will
[48:03] hopefully it won't be an irritation to
[48:05] you. If you make fun of me then when you
[48:08] have a nasal then I'll make fun of you
[48:09] too.
[48:11] 1st Samuel chapter 19 and verse 1 and
[48:14] two. Praise the Lord. And Saul spake to
[48:18] Jonathan his son and to all his servants
[48:23] that they should kill David. I want you
[48:25] to notice here how quickly and I I don't
[48:28] know the exact days or months but this
[48:30] is a at a very short time after David
[48:36] within days or within weeks maybe months
[48:39] but not longer than a year that David we
[48:42] see this incident now where everything
[48:44] changes in David's life and this is
[48:46] after he's been anointed to be king not
[48:49] in his position yet but he's been
[48:51] anointed to be king by the prophet of
[48:54] God. He has he has slayed Goliath in
[48:58] front of the entire cowardly army of
[49:00] Israel. He has been lifted up by Saul,
[49:03] the king of Israel, to a position over
[49:06] certain men in his army. All that's
[49:08] happened very quickly. And now within
[49:12] days or weeks, I don't know how long,
[49:13] but it's not longer than a year, Saul is
[49:16] instructing his son to kill David.
[49:20] Now you you can't process these things
[49:24] unless you understand
[49:26] what God is doing in his predestinated
[49:29] plan. And you can't understand what God
[49:33] is doing in our lives sometimes unless
[49:36] you step back and just yield to what the
[49:39] Lord is doing. Because trying to
[49:41] understand this, and you'll hear me
[49:42] bring out today, this wasn't the heathen
[49:45] army trying to kill David. He'll have
[49:47] that later. This is the the leader and
[49:50] the this is a leader the leader in his
[49:54] own house and in his own ranks that's
[49:57] going to try to kill him. Now Saul spake
[50:00] to Jonathan his son and to his servants
[50:02] that they should kill David. But
[50:04] Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in
[50:06] David. And Jonathan told David saying my
[50:10] father seeketh to kill thee. Now
[50:12] therefore, I pray thee, take heed to
[50:16] thyself until the morning.
[50:19] Listen. And abide in a secret place
[50:24] and hide thyself. Amen. Amen.
[50:28] That's right. Now, David's the one who's
[50:31] later going to have on in his songs, in
[50:34] his teaching, in all of his works, he's
[50:38] going to be the main one in the Bible
[50:39] that's going to have this mystery of a
[50:41] hidden place, a secret place, a place to
[50:45] hide. He's going to be the main one. And
[50:48] this is the first time those terms are
[50:51] introduced to him. And it wasn't just
[50:53] some spiritual place at that time. It
[50:56] was you're going to have to hide. You're
[50:58] going to have to find a secret place
[51:00] because the enemy is after you. First
[51:03] time it was introduced, God must have
[51:05] really opened up the revelation later
[51:07] what this really meant. And now he's
[51:09] opening it to us. Can you say amen?
[51:11] Lord, bless your word today and we just
[51:13] sit at your feet. We want to say once
[51:16] again straight to your ears this
[51:19] morning. Lord, thank you for healing my
[51:21] sister. Thank you for the healing that's
[51:24] going on in the congregation. Thank you
[51:26] for what you're doing, Lord. And we want
[51:28] to return back as the 10 lepers were
[51:31] healed and only one returned to say
[51:33] thank you. We want to be those ones that
[51:36] turn back and say thank you today. Thank
[51:38] you, Father. We pray you'll continue to
[51:40] bless your people. Bless the word today
[51:42] and give us your anointing. We pray in
[51:44] Jesus name. Amen. You may be seated. God
[51:47] bless you.
[51:51] hiding place. Uh in the Hebrew it's uh
[51:56] satir mistor. Satier mistor means hiding
[52:00] place. I'm just saying my Hebrew there.
[52:03] And because it is David that has most
[52:07] references to this hiding place, I feel
[52:09] to take a look at his life a little bit
[52:12] and to see the reason that he so often
[52:15] used the imagery of uh a tower, a
[52:19] fortress, a pavilion. In his songs, he
[52:22] used this imagery tower, fortress, a
[52:25] pavilion, a shield, a secret place. and
[52:29] and and often uh it shows that as as
[52:33] something that somebody that's running
[52:34] from something for safety and uh that's
[52:37] that's why he refers to that. It's so
[52:40] when you have that imagery, you have
[52:41] somebody that's running from something,
[52:44] somebody that's running from somebody.
[52:46] And that's some of the reason why David
[52:48] has uh brought this these things up as
[52:51] imagery of looking at talking about a
[52:53] tower fortress is because it shows
[52:55] somebody running from something to get
[52:57] into a place that would they would be
[53:00] safe. And uh I should note this before
[53:02] we go forward this morning that King
[53:05] David's life is referenced more than any
[53:08] other character in the Bible. 66
[53:12] chapters refer to David with 49
[53:16] references in the New Testament. So
[53:18] that's pretty significant. The life of
[53:20] David is mentioned that much in the
[53:22] Bible. And we know the reason why is
[53:25] because David's life is a type of
[53:27] Christ.
[53:29] And so and then we know that that the
[53:32] that the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:34] is in Christ. The bride comes out of
[53:37] Christ. How many knows that his wife
[53:40] comes out of him? Eve was inside of Adam
[53:43] before she was taken out. So if that's
[53:45] true, we have a second Adam. We have a
[53:47] second Eve and there's a people. There's
[53:50] a there's a bride and but where was she
[53:52] to start with? She was in Christ. So if
[53:55] we have David as an example in his life
[53:58] of the type of Christ, then we can also
[54:01] find our spiritual biography in looking
[54:05] at the life of David. He was a type of
[54:07] Christ. The bride of Christ is the bride
[54:10] of Christ is in Christ. So we will see
[54:12] things in David's life that is a
[54:15] revelation for our lives especially in
[54:18] this hour. We know Christ is the mystery
[54:20] of God revealed. We know the whole Bible
[54:24] reveals Jesus Christ. We know every
[54:26] verse of the Bible. If we don't if we
[54:28] don't see Christ in it, we got to go
[54:30] back and read it again because all of it
[54:32] is not just stories. It's complete
[54:35] revealing of Jesus Christ.
[54:38] So I'm just uh relating some
[54:40] foundational things here. The whole
[54:42] Bible reveals him. He is the principal
[54:45] theme. All of it reveals Christ. But
[54:48] David is a type of him more than any
[54:50] other types as the true king. But also
[54:54] not just that he's the true king, but
[54:57] how the kingdom age back in the Old
[54:59] Testament, how the kingdom age was
[55:02] ushered in. Now, we say, "Well, Saul was
[55:04] the king and he was anointed by the same
[55:06] prophet." Yeah, but Saul was a choice of
[55:08] the people.
[55:11] David was God's own choice. And I tell
[55:14] you, that's a big difference. Who the
[55:16] people choose and who God chooses.
[55:19] Because I can guarantee you one thing.
[55:21] Whoever God's choice is, he's going to
[55:24] stand with them no matter what. And any
[55:27] enemy that aligns himself against that
[55:31] has been chosen to go to the throne, I
[55:34] can tell you that enemy is in trouble
[55:36] before he even gets started.
[55:41] So, you know, and I've ministered on the
[55:43] difference of Saul and David and how
[55:45] they were anointed by the same prophet.
[55:47] There's many things I could go into with
[55:48] that that are relating to us being under
[55:51] a prophet in this age. And so the
[55:53] prophet anoints those uh those uh the
[55:56] prophet in the Old Testament anointed
[55:58] the priest. He washed the priest. Uh
[56:01] there's a type in there about the priest
[56:03] coming before Moses. And so every
[56:05] minister that's a minister of the gospel
[56:07] I feel like needs to be washed and
[56:09] anointed by the right anointing which
[56:11] comes through the word that's given by a
[56:13] prophet. So all these types are here. I
[56:15] can tell you that the that that the that
[56:17] that
[56:18] uh the the prophet Nathan, it was the
[56:21] same prophet that anointed Saul is the
[56:25] same prophet with the same anointing
[56:26] that anointed David. All within the same
[56:29] message, the same prophet. One was
[56:32] anointed, but he was a choice of the
[56:34] people, but God anointed him anyway.
[56:36] But one was God's choice. He was
[56:39] destined for the throne. Saul took the
[56:42] throne, but he proved over time who he
[56:45] was, right? Who he was, how he proved
[56:49] over time what his character was.
[56:53] Oh my. So that kind of includes
[56:56] everybody who's in and around the
[56:59] message under a prophet, being blessed
[57:02] by the prophet, being anointed. Can you
[57:05] say amen? But it's over time it's proved
[57:08] the character that comes out of our
[57:10] lives.
[57:13] Praise the Lord. And so this we as we
[57:17] look at David's life this morning, you
[57:19] know, we are here in the in in the in
[57:22] the ministering of the kingdom age
[57:24] again. We are there again back in the
[57:26] Old Testament, 1 Samuel, we are seeing
[57:28] the ushering in of a kingdom age under
[57:30] David, the true king. And so we are
[57:32] right on the edge of that right now
[57:34] because we're getting ready to enter the
[57:36] kingdom age. The day the the a the days
[57:38] of the son of David, him as king, son of
[57:41] David. We're entering in the kingdom
[57:43] age. The kingdom age has already been
[57:45] ushered in, so to speak, but we're we're
[57:48] not fully there yet until we get to the
[57:50] millennium. So, and then I might say
[57:52] this personally, I find David's life a
[57:54] great inspiration to me. There's always
[57:56] characters in the Bible that we relate
[57:59] to more than others. And I David's life
[58:01] has always been a great inspiration to
[58:03] see what he went through. I've been
[58:05] through a lot of those things myself.
[58:07] And so it's very real to me. Now, David
[58:10] wrote uh of this these terms hide me
[58:15] because he had first of all life
[58:17] situations that he had to run and he had
[58:20] to hide and he had to find safety. It
[58:23] was real to him when he wrote about
[58:26] running. When he wrote about a secret
[58:28] place, when he wrote about a cave, when
[58:29] he wrote about a pavilion, a fortress,
[58:32] that was real because he had to run from
[58:34] things. He had to run from people. And
[58:37] it was later he had to run. He didn't
[58:39] run from the heathen. He didn't It's
[58:41] interesting that David never ran from
[58:43] Goliath. It was the rest of the Israel
[58:45] that was running from Gol. He wasn't
[58:47] afraid of Goliath. We can't be afraid of
[58:50] Goliath.
[58:52] But see, it was a unique situation when
[58:54] you got the king of Israel kind of
[58:56] breathing down your neck and going for
[58:58] you. He had to maintain a level of
[59:00] respect cuz he said that's God's
[59:03] anointed. So, it was a little bit more
[59:05] difficult. So, he had to run. He had to
[59:07] find a place to go because he wasn't
[59:10] going to go after Saul. That was God's
[59:13] anointed. He wasn't going to lash back
[59:15] at him. So, this wasn't going for a
[59:17] Goliath. There was this going in a
[59:19] situation that was internal happening
[59:22] that I I'm sure as a young man David did
[59:25] not understand what was going on and why
[59:28] somebody within his ranks turned on him
[59:32] like this in jealousy. Amen. But
[59:35] friends, it happens.
[59:38] We got a jealous devil, but we got a
[59:40] jealousy devil that gets on people that
[59:42] they become jealous. You know, when
[59:44] people really get uh after us and the
[59:48] enemy gets after us, you know what? Uh
[59:51] you we should just say, "I must have
[59:53] something that the devil wants."
[1:00:00] And it's really true from the very
[1:00:01] beginning. His jealousy started all the
[1:00:04] way back even in heaven as his jealousy
[1:00:07] started and he wanted to lift himself
[1:00:09] out and drew an influence of the stars
[1:00:11] because he w he was jealous of the
[1:00:14] position of Michael. He was jealous. He
[1:00:16] wanted to be worshiped like that. He
[1:00:18] wanted that position.
[1:00:20] And when he come to earth, he was
[1:00:22] jealous of what Adam and Eve had. He was
[1:00:25] jealous. And so there's always tension
[1:00:27] in the camp in every place. There's
[1:00:28] always two seeds and two spirits
[1:00:30] working. And the other spirit was always
[1:00:32] coming against the real spirit because
[1:00:34] it was jealous. There was something
[1:00:36] there that they had. One thing Satan had
[1:00:38] that Adam and Eve have is creative
[1:00:40] power. He wanted creative power. And
[1:00:43] Satan could never have it. He doesn't
[1:00:45] have it this morning. He can only try to
[1:00:48] imitate or try to uh h put out something
[1:00:51] that is a counterfeit to God's creation.
[1:00:54] But Satan cannot create.
[1:00:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:00] So he's always been jealous and you know
[1:01:03] David is running from people and running
[1:01:04] from situations and he lived that out.
[1:01:07] The enemy breathing down his neck
[1:01:09] looking for a place to hide. Uh that's
[1:01:11] what he was and and the main enemy
[1:01:13] chasing him was a leader in his own
[1:01:15] people. I I I might say Saul is not Saul
[1:01:19] is not just a political leader. He's
[1:01:21] actually a leader. He's not a secular
[1:01:23] leader as much as he is the leader of
[1:01:26] the children of Israel, Jehovah God.
[1:01:28] He's he that's who he is. And so the
[1:01:30] main enemy now in early in his life
[1:01:32] chasing him was a leader in his own
[1:01:34] people, his own group. If you have
[1:01:36] heathens um if you have heathens putting
[1:01:39] you down, you expect that. If you have
[1:01:41] heathen nations coming against you, you
[1:01:43] expect that. But when a believer is
[1:01:45] attacking you, it's quite confusing.
[1:01:48] This was confusing to David. No doubt
[1:01:50] being chased. And I just want to go into
[1:01:52] this running from something or being
[1:01:54] chased. You know, it's uh I've read up
[1:01:56] on this just a tad. And being chased by
[1:02:00] something comes up often in some
[1:02:03] people's dreams. I won't ask for a show
[1:02:05] of hands, but it's quite often something
[1:02:08] that you're being chased by somebody or
[1:02:11] you're being chased by something that's
[1:02:13] the creature or there there's something.
[1:02:16] And so people have dreams like this and
[1:02:17] and they dream of somebody. This is
[1:02:19] common from what I find out. Common
[1:02:21] being chased. I've had it happen a
[1:02:23] couple times. I can't remember what the
[1:02:25] dreams are and who was really chasing me
[1:02:28] at the time. Might have been one of you
[1:02:29] guys. I don't know. But uh I've had it a
[1:02:32] couple times. But people some people
[1:02:34] they have it almost every night and
[1:02:36] they're they're they're sweating and you
[1:02:38] know and then then they wake up and
[1:02:39] realize that they're in their warm bed
[1:02:41] and they're in a safe place and it
[1:02:42] wasn't real. It was just a dream. But
[1:02:45] these things uh uh feel real when you're
[1:02:48] when you're having that and it's common
[1:02:50] and sometimes it's something chasing you
[1:02:53] as brother Brandham brought this up in
[1:02:54] the prayer lines. He'll go into this.
[1:02:56] He'll go into somebody's nervous
[1:02:58] problems. He'll go into the emotional
[1:03:00] problems and then the physical problems.
[1:03:02] Then when the Holy Spirit reveals it, he
[1:03:05] said, "You were chased by a dog. You
[1:03:07] were chased by this bad man." When you
[1:03:09] were you were chased by something, maybe
[1:03:11] even a parent. you were being chased by
[1:03:13] something and it was a very evil thing
[1:03:15] that has lingered with them. And so now
[1:03:18] their subconscious is feeling this thing
[1:03:21] of being chased. It brought a fear in
[1:03:23] their heart. And so now they're having
[1:03:25] because our subconscious sometimes
[1:03:27] that's what our dreams go into. We're
[1:03:28] feeling this. It's a part of us. And so
[1:03:31] you sometimes you're chased as a child.
[1:03:33] It starts with a fear. You become
[1:03:35] scared. Then you have dreams about it.
[1:03:37] But then when you come back to reality,
[1:03:39] you realize it's not a dream. but they
[1:03:40] feel real. I was reading a little bit
[1:03:42] deeper and uh somebody said, "Dreams
[1:03:45] about being chased often symbolize that
[1:03:47] you're avoiding a difficult situation or
[1:03:50] problem in your waking life that you
[1:03:53] feel is overwhelming or impossible to
[1:03:55] overcome. This could be anything that
[1:03:58] causes you stress or fear, whether it's
[1:04:00] a conflict, a responsibility, or an
[1:04:03] emotion you're trying to ignore."
[1:04:07] Goes on to say, "Fear and anxiety." The
[1:04:09] chase can also represent an underlying
[1:04:12] anxiety, fear of confrontation or an
[1:04:15] unresolved emotional issue. The thing
[1:04:17] chasing you in the dream is symbolic
[1:04:20] representation of what is causing you
[1:04:22] distress in your real life. Your dream
[1:04:25] reflects that and often it's something
[1:04:27] chasing you. Why, brother Paul, are you
[1:04:29] reading that? I'll tell you why I read
[1:04:31] these things sometimes that the
[1:04:33] psychologist would say it's because
[1:04:35] human beings it's common. But it's
[1:04:37] common with how the enemy works. You
[1:04:39] know why I read it? To expose the devil
[1:04:43] at his tactics.
[1:04:45] To expose the enemy. Cuz if somebody can
[1:04:48] say, "Hey, that's a little bit of me."
[1:04:50] And know that it's the devil doing that
[1:04:52] in your subconscious. They'll go on a
[1:04:54] journey to get to the bottom of what
[1:04:57] Satan is using in fear to keep you bound
[1:05:01] to get in your dreams. I tell you, I
[1:05:03] have testimonies of people that God
[1:05:05] completely made them free and all of a
[1:05:07] sudden their dreams are free. Their
[1:05:09] dreams are more godly dreams. Their
[1:05:11] dreams are happy dreams.
[1:05:14] Praise the Lord. So that's why I read
[1:05:17] it. It's to expose whatever the devil's
[1:05:20] using in our lives to even steal our
[1:05:24] dreams.
[1:05:26] It's not real, but it feels real.
[1:05:28] Something closing in on you is often the
[1:05:30] feeling of a something closing in on you
[1:05:32] is often a feeling of a panic attack.
[1:05:35] And this is why you're awake. You're not
[1:05:36] dreaming. It's the feeling of something
[1:05:39] attacking you. What a rotten devil.
[1:05:43] And so David, he's he's he raised terms
[1:05:45] of feeling surrounded by the enemy when
[1:05:48] the enemy is encamped around me. So now
[1:05:51] he's had that physically, but now that
[1:05:54] becomes very important to us because we
[1:05:56] can ex can know what it feels like to
[1:06:00] become feeling encamped with the enemy
[1:06:03] encamped around us. These are most often
[1:06:06] said by David in the Bible because he's
[1:06:08] experienced it in real life. But it
[1:06:11] shows the work of the enemy in demonic
[1:06:14] forces. The manner of his attack is to
[1:06:17] chase you and make you feel like you are
[1:06:21] outnumbered.
[1:06:26] That you are alone. And the devil's
[1:06:29] saying you're alone and I've got you
[1:06:32] cornered.
[1:06:34] But praise the Lord. I got too many
[1:06:36] places in the Bible that show Satan got
[1:06:39] burned when he messed with his elect.
[1:06:43] Can I get an amen? When Satan I've got
[1:06:45] places where Satan thought he was honing
[1:06:48] in on somebody alone. It looked like
[1:06:50] they were alone. You're alone. You're
[1:06:52] outnumbered. I'm going to overcome you.
[1:06:55] You're finished. I'm coming after you.
[1:06:57] I've got my all. I'm ganging up on this
[1:07:00] believer. And every time he does it, he
[1:07:03] mess with the wrong person. When Satan
[1:07:06] gangs up on a believer, he has a rude
[1:07:09] awakening to who he's dealing with.
[1:07:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:07:17] Satan didn't know what he was dealing
[1:07:19] with with my sister Sharon.
[1:07:23] He made a mistake to try to take it
[1:07:25] further.
[1:07:28] Oh, saints of God. When Satan comes
[1:07:32] against a true believer who's destined
[1:07:35] for the throne, he's messed with the
[1:07:37] wrong person.
[1:07:39] Can you say amen? When he tries to come
[1:07:42] around anybody else, it's one thing. But
[1:07:44] when he comes around a believer and
[1:07:45] encamps them and said, "I've got you.
[1:07:47] You're alone." But too many places,
[1:07:49] Satan gangs up. He gets a rude
[1:07:51] awakening. And as seen many times in the
[1:07:54] Bible, Satan finds out they're not
[1:07:56] really alone because the Lord of Hosts
[1:07:59] is standing there with them.
[1:08:03] Amen. Amen. There's been several
[1:08:06] testimonies of somebody who had an enemy
[1:08:08] come into their home or some type of
[1:08:10] somebody trying to break in. And so
[1:08:12] they're standing there and they said, "I
[1:08:14] ran away. The enemy ran away because I
[1:08:17] seen somebody standing behind you
[1:08:22] and they said, "There's nobody standing
[1:08:23] around me. I was by myself in the
[1:08:25] house." No, there was somebody standing
[1:08:27] by you and it scared me away. That's
[1:08:30] what Satan does all the time. He assumes
[1:08:32] that you're alone and he can gang up on
[1:08:34] you. But let me tell you, you're not
[1:08:36] alone.
[1:08:37] You're not alone. The Lord of hosts
[1:08:41] stands by the side of every believer.
[1:08:47] You remember Gahesi Gazi when he was
[1:08:50] there with the prophet and he said he's
[1:08:53] shaking in his boots and telling the
[1:08:55] prophet, "We're surrounded. We're
[1:08:57] surrounded." But then the prophet said,
[1:09:00] "Lord, open his eyes." Because you had
[1:09:02] to look through the eyes of eagle eyes.
[1:09:03] A prophet is an eagle. And you have to
[1:09:05] get under the eagle anointing. If you're
[1:09:07] under another anointing, the man age,
[1:09:09] the ox age, that's not the anointing
[1:09:11] today. We're under an eagle anointing,
[1:09:12] which means we can see things from up
[1:09:15] here. We can see things that the devil
[1:09:17] don't see and other people can't see.
[1:09:19] And said, "Lord, open that gahhes. Open
[1:09:22] his eyes that he can see." And God gave
[1:09:24] him the eagle anointing to let him see
[1:09:27] that beyond the enemy surrounding them,
[1:09:30] the whole host of God's army was in the
[1:09:32] background. And he said, "There's more
[1:09:35] with us that's than with them."
[1:09:41] Praise the Lord. Satan thought there was
[1:09:43] only three in the fiery furnace
[1:09:47] and kept looking and kept looking. But
[1:09:49] there's not three. We put three in.
[1:09:51] There was one like the son of man. They
[1:09:53] weren't alone. The three huge Hebrew
[1:09:55] children were not alone. And he was in
[1:09:58] the flames with them.
[1:10:00] Praise the Lord. So now we see then that
[1:10:04] if he's coming after you, you must have
[1:10:06] something that he wants to steal from
[1:10:09] you. If he's coming after you, you must
[1:10:11] have something. Maybe that's what you
[1:10:13] need to tell the devil when he's coming
[1:10:14] after you. Say, "Wow, you I must have
[1:10:17] really have some good stuff here."
[1:10:20] Is everybody awake this morning? Tell
[1:10:22] the devil, "I must have something here
[1:10:24] for you to come after me and surround me
[1:10:26] this way and make me feel alone, but I'm
[1:10:27] not alone. And I must have something you
[1:10:30] really want for you to gang up on me
[1:10:33] like this. I must be a true believer
[1:10:35] who's destined for the throne of God. If
[1:10:38] Satan is ganging up on me and
[1:10:40] surrounding me like this, that's where
[1:10:42] we get faith and get in a hiding place
[1:10:44] is that I'm under God's protection. He's
[1:10:47] here with me in this hiding place. And
[1:10:49] there isn't any army of the demonic
[1:10:51] forces that can do anything to change my
[1:10:55] destiny.
[1:10:57] I'm trying to encourage you this
[1:10:58] morning. I say you ought to raise your
[1:11:00] hand and say, "Thank God. This is the
[1:11:02] devil isn't afraid of me, but he's
[1:11:04] afraid of the Lord of hosts who's
[1:11:06] standing right with me.
[1:11:09] Blessed be his name." So David through
[1:11:12] these things had learned that he was not
[1:11:14] alone. And there was a deeper revelation
[1:11:16] of a hiding place that begin to develop
[1:11:19] in David's life. And he finally said, he
[1:11:22] finally said, "Lord, Lord, you you are
[1:11:25] my hiding place." He looked for physical
[1:11:28] places, but the revelation grew deeper
[1:11:30] and realized, "Wow, it's not a fortress
[1:11:33] physically. It's not a church. As we
[1:11:35] said last Sunday, it's not a church.
[1:11:36] It's being in Christ. It's a hiding
[1:11:38] place in Christ." And we realize that he
[1:11:42] had to be able to see a deeper
[1:11:44] revelation to realize, Lord, you are my
[1:11:46] hiding place. He often had a need for a
[1:11:49] tangible place. But his only real safety
[1:11:53] was in the Lord. His eyes of faith
[1:11:56] actually could look further and see the
[1:11:58] pre-rapturing condition and dwelling
[1:12:01] place of the bride. Let me say it again.
[1:12:03] this revelation that God gave him
[1:12:06] because remember David caught something
[1:12:08] of inspiration of Jesus in the on the
[1:12:12] cross
[1:12:13] and he spoke the same words. Nobody knew
[1:12:16] that was coming to three 400 years later
[1:12:18] but inspiration struck him and he could
[1:12:20] actually feel and live and cry out like
[1:12:24] Jesus did, my God, my God, why has thou
[1:12:27] forsaken me?
[1:12:29] And uh so now he's coming into he never
[1:12:34] comes into it himself, but he he's
[1:12:36] starting to see actually the place of a
[1:12:39] pre-rapture condition and a dwelling
[1:12:41] place in Psalms 27 of the people of God
[1:12:45] for this generation. So David, he
[1:12:47] learned as a young man the term secret
[1:12:49] place. And Jonathan said, "Go hide. Go
[1:12:52] find a secret place." He learned it
[1:12:54] young because of a surprising unexpected
[1:12:57] situation where the king of Israel a
[1:13:00] high position turned jealous against him
[1:13:03] and was seeking to kill him. You know
[1:13:06] the story and the children know the
[1:13:08] story that he was he was anointed in a
[1:13:11] private setting and then there wasn't
[1:13:13] too many people around. Then he goes to
[1:13:16] to to to the army to help them bring
[1:13:18] them lunch or whatever. Sees Goliath
[1:13:20] defying the armies of the living God.
[1:13:22] says, "Why is this happening? Why aren't
[1:13:24] we going against him?" They're all
[1:13:25] shaken in their boots. David has a
[1:13:28] tremendous victory in his life. And it's
[1:13:30] kind of like us. We we become anointed
[1:13:32] by the Holy Ghost initially initially in
[1:13:34] our lives. We have great victories
[1:13:36] initially in our life, but then we don't
[1:13:38] expect things to happen to turn against
[1:13:42] us so much after we have our initial
[1:13:44] victories. And if you're not on your
[1:13:46] toes and realize what God is doing to
[1:13:49] groom you and mold you into something
[1:13:52] different. You see, nobody in that whole
[1:13:54] generation was to be molded to be a king
[1:13:58] like David.
[1:14:01] So David had to go through things that
[1:14:04] others hadn't didn't have to go through
[1:14:08] because he was being molded for a
[1:14:10] different position. I can tell you this
[1:14:13] morning, brothers and sisters, don't
[1:14:15] ever compare yourself with everybody
[1:14:17] else. God has a special calling, a
[1:14:21] predestinated plan on your life. And
[1:14:24] that means your trials are predestinated
[1:14:27] to get you to a certain destiny.
[1:14:31] Say, why does that person have to go
[1:14:32] through that? Why do they have to? God,
[1:14:34] why is this why people say, "Why, God,
[1:14:36] why are you doing this to me? God, why
[1:14:39] is this happening to me? I I never like
[1:14:40] to go there. I don't think we blame God
[1:14:43] for anything because God's a big God. I
[1:14:45] want to be like Joseph saying to his
[1:14:47] brothers who tried to kill him, hey, you
[1:14:49] know, you meant it for evil, but God
[1:14:51] intended it for good. I got
[1:14:53] predestinated trials specifically for
[1:14:55] me. I'm going through this. That's when
[1:14:57] you look at it from a mature standpoint
[1:14:59] that I must be different. Satan must
[1:15:02] know that I'm different. That's why he's
[1:15:04] fighting against me because I I'm not
[1:15:06] being groomed just to be an average
[1:15:08] Christian, but I'm being groomed to be
[1:15:10] an overcomer to overcome this age. Can
[1:15:13] you say amen? And to actually to rule
[1:15:16] and reign with Christ, king and queen.
[1:15:22] I'm royalty, but I got to be prepared to
[1:15:25] rule like royalty.
[1:15:29] And so there's different preparation for
[1:15:30] that. And David didn't realize that
[1:15:32] early on. I believe he did later. But
[1:15:35] God was getting him in a position, God
[1:15:37] was as soon as he had his victory with
[1:15:40] Goliath. And that's just within just
[1:15:43] maybe even a few days, David went out,
[1:15:46] had another victory, he's on his way
[1:15:48] back with all the spoils and all the
[1:15:50] things that he's conquered. And the
[1:15:51] women begin to rejoice and say, "David
[1:15:54] has killed his thousands. Excuse me.
[1:15:57] Saul has killed his thousands. David,
[1:15:59] his 10 thousands. Oh, this could be our
[1:16:02] next king. And the Bible says Saul,
[1:16:06] here's what happened.
[1:16:08] Saul, anointed by the same anointing
[1:16:11] from pro from the prophet, was doing
[1:16:14] okay
[1:16:15] until he changed his looks towards who?
[1:16:19] Towards David.
[1:16:22] He got his eyes off of the prophet, off
[1:16:25] of God, off of his own calling, and he
[1:16:28] set his eyes on this young man, and he
[1:16:32] took the spirit of jealousy.
[1:16:37] Church splits, fusses in churches,
[1:16:41] tensions, and divisions in families
[1:16:44] often start because somebody becomes
[1:16:47] carnal. Instead of keeping their eyes on
[1:16:49] Jesus, they set their eyes on one
[1:16:52] another out of jealousy.
[1:16:56] Praise the Lord. And from that moment
[1:16:59] on, he turned his heart against David.
[1:17:04] But it didn't matter how much he turned
[1:17:06] his heart and how much evil and running
[1:17:09] after him he would do. David had been
[1:17:12] anointed for the throne.
[1:17:16] Now, I always say, was this all about
[1:17:20] showing something in Saul, or was this
[1:17:23] all about God allowing it to learn David
[1:17:26] some things that he would need to rule
[1:17:29] and reign?
[1:17:31] Is your trials all about the other
[1:17:34] person who did you wrong, or was it all
[1:17:37] about what God needed to teach you?
[1:17:42] I'm not getting a lot of response this
[1:17:44] morning and I'm prepared. That's fine.
[1:17:46] But I'm going to say it again. Maybe we
[1:17:48] should look on our life's things and our
[1:17:51] issues and our struggles we're dealing
[1:17:54] with that nobody else maybe knows about.
[1:17:56] But maybe we should look at it different
[1:17:58] as this has happened because of this
[1:18:00] person. This has happened because of
[1:18:01] this person. My husband did this. My
[1:18:03] wife did this. Maybe we should grow up
[1:18:06] and stop looking at them and start
[1:18:08] looking within oursel of what God's
[1:18:11] trying to grow in our life to meet our
[1:18:14] destiny.
[1:18:16] Because news flash, you're not at your
[1:18:18] destiny yet.
[1:18:22] Some of you think you've arrived and
[1:18:24] you're you pious. You got it all
[1:18:25] together. I don't. I don't. Listen, I
[1:18:27] don't know how you got there, but let me
[1:18:29] know. But I just want to tell you, I I
[1:18:30] don't think you're there yet. I don't
[1:18:32] think you're there yet.
[1:18:34] But are we growing? Are we under the
[1:18:37] right Holy Ghost? The the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:41] And have we been predestinated to the
[1:18:44] throne of God? Yes, we have. So, we got
[1:18:48] enough essential things there that are
[1:18:49] unmovable that I think that we can face
[1:18:52] any enemy. Praise the Lord. So, I wonder
[1:18:55] if we're we're learning why, and this is
[1:18:58] today. The reason that I'm bringing this
[1:19:00] up is that my I'm probing saying why
[1:19:02] David wanted so much to hide with the
[1:19:05] Lord. What was some of the things he was
[1:19:08] hiding from? And now we now we don't
[1:19:11] want to say well he was hiding from Saul
[1:19:14] or he was hiding later on from the
[1:19:16] enemies. Uh no, it was deeper than that.
[1:19:20] There was other things that David wanted
[1:19:22] to hide from. We're going to get into
[1:19:24] that. I wonder if the pressure he felt,
[1:19:27] David felt was so similar to the other
[1:19:29] ones who are anointed for the throne or
[1:19:31] for the kingdom age which is his bride.
[1:19:33] Not everyone was anointed for that end.
[1:19:35] But whoever is predestinated to it will
[1:19:37] go through expect unexpected trials
[1:19:41] to have and to learn to find for the
[1:19:44] purpose of that secret place through it
[1:19:48] all to drive us to that place. See, all
[1:19:51] of it worked for the good because it
[1:19:52] drove David not only, excuse me, it
[1:19:56] drove David to not only a physical
[1:19:57] safety place, but it drove him to the
[1:20:00] revelation that my only protection is in
[1:20:02] the Lord, and I can hide with the Lord
[1:20:04] in that. And and he said in Psalms 27,
[1:20:08] he says, "Hide me in." He said, "The
[1:20:10] Lord will hide me in his pavilion, in
[1:20:12] the secret place of his tabernacle." I
[1:20:15] preached to you that he said one thing
[1:20:16] have I desired and that's to dwell in
[1:20:19] the house of the Lord forever to live
[1:20:21] every day in that presence
[1:20:24] and friends we won't run towards that
[1:20:27] because if we're running from something
[1:20:29] we need to run to the right thing
[1:20:32] do you know that David as soon as he ran
[1:20:35] from Saul he didn't run to the right
[1:20:37] thing he ran to the enemy's camp
[1:20:42] boy doesn't that speak of a lot Lot of
[1:20:44] people when they have tension in the
[1:20:46] church and somebody does them wrong and
[1:20:48] I'm just running. I'm going to run from
[1:20:50] this whole thing and they ditch
[1:20:52] everything and they run and start
[1:20:54] playing with the things of the world.
[1:20:55] They get around people of the world and
[1:20:57] they think that's the safety place. It's
[1:20:59] not.
[1:21:01] But we run to where we think we should
[1:21:04] this is a safe place. In this bar with
[1:21:06] my friends is a safe place. I don't have
[1:21:08] to deal with legalistic Christians.
[1:21:12] The devil's deceived you. That's right.
[1:21:15] Because en the enemy camp, he ran and
[1:21:18] kind of got in by deception to the
[1:21:19] enemy's camp and thinking that was a
[1:21:21] safe place to be with the enemy's camp.
[1:21:24] That's not a safe place either. We don't
[1:21:27] need to run to the enemy's side. We
[1:21:29] don't need to escape into all kinds of
[1:21:32] perversions on the internet when we're
[1:21:34] running from something, running from
[1:21:35] stresses, running from a past that's
[1:21:38] wrong. We don't need to run to something
[1:21:40] of the world. He's trying to teach us
[1:21:42] run into that safe place with Christ.
[1:21:45] Run into own your own personal walk with
[1:21:48] Christ. If the whole world falls apart,
[1:21:50] if wife or husband falls apart, it's
[1:21:53] teaching us where do I run? I run to
[1:21:55] Jesus.
[1:21:57] But where do we run today? We do like
[1:21:59] David. The first thing is we run to some
[1:22:02] escape into some computer or some phone
[1:22:05] or some place. We feel like ah I feel
[1:22:09] safe here by myself with my phone.
[1:22:13] Wow, what a deception.
[1:22:17] You feel safe with your phone.
[1:22:22] I don't you know a lot of these things I
[1:22:24] say is not in my notes so it must need
[1:22:27] to be said.
[1:22:29] You feel safe alone on the couch with
[1:22:32] nobody around. I don't have to deal with
[1:22:33] people. Reminds me of Mark Johnson.
[1:22:35] Brandon and I were talking about this.
[1:22:36] Mark Johnson years ago used to be in our
[1:22:38] church, brother, up here in Ann Arbor.
[1:22:39] And he said he's in the Delta Airlines
[1:22:43] and he said they give him a big
[1:22:44] promotion to move from the baggage to
[1:22:46] come upstairs and be in the front desk
[1:22:48] and be and so he can make more money and
[1:22:50] everything. So, brother David, I
[1:22:52] remember he he went up there, he took
[1:22:53] the job for three or four or five months
[1:22:55] and then he quit it and he went back to
[1:22:56] baggage. I said, "Why'd you do that?" He
[1:22:58] said, "I can't deal with people."
[1:23:01] And he says, "Baggage don't talk back.
[1:23:05] He said, "I can take those bags and
[1:23:07] throw them over in the plane and I can
[1:23:09] do anything and they don't talk back.
[1:23:11] They don't get angry with you. They
[1:23:12] don't cuss you out."
[1:23:16] So funny. Sometimes I feel like doing
[1:23:18] the same thing.
[1:23:21] But we I I can't get off this point
[1:23:23] without saying every one of us
[1:23:27] escape into something we think is safe.
[1:23:30] But I'm here to tell you as your as your
[1:23:33] pastor, you better make sure it's a safe
[1:23:36] place
[1:23:40] because it may not be safe at all. You
[1:23:42] might be coming out of the frying pan
[1:23:45] into the fire,
[1:23:47] but you think it's it's not with around
[1:23:49] people. if I just got this and and I can
[1:23:53] and I can safely text people and I can
[1:23:56] give them a piece of my mind on the
[1:23:58] internet but never have to be with them
[1:24:00] face to face.
[1:24:03] People will say things
[1:24:05] on a text that they'd never say face to
[1:24:08] face. Some people would. They'd say it
[1:24:10] face to face, but they just they blow
[1:24:12] off blow off all this and there's like a
[1:24:15] volcano and they're all fine and they're
[1:24:17] at church and they're worshiping, but
[1:24:18] there's this festering thing that's
[1:24:20] never been dealt with. And then you
[1:24:21] trigger them the wrong way and the
[1:24:23] volcano. All this stuff just comes out
[1:24:26] and you get it. You get a tongue
[1:24:28] lashing. They haven't dealt with things
[1:24:30] in their heart. It's a festering
[1:24:32] volcano.
[1:24:34] Festering is the lack of a better term,
[1:24:35] but it's it's it's a rumbling. What's
[1:24:37] the word? Josiah.
[1:24:41] What's a volcano do?
[1:24:44] It erupts. But what's it doing before it
[1:24:46] erupts? It's Huh?
[1:24:50] Rumbles.
[1:24:52] Got all these engineers in here and
[1:24:54] everybody. I can't figure this out.
[1:24:57] Then it erupts. And then they you get a
[1:24:59] tongue lashing. It just all comes out.
[1:25:01] And then you know what I do? Lord, I
[1:25:04] can't react to that.
[1:25:06] I'm going in my my secret place. I'm
[1:25:09] going to pray for them because
[1:25:10] something's unresolved in their heart.
[1:25:12] I'm going to love them.
[1:25:15] I might put some boundaries in place,
[1:25:17] but I'm not going to have a lack of
[1:25:18] love. Can you say amen? But but the
[1:25:22] thing is is that we we we escape into
[1:25:25] things sometimes that we think is the
[1:25:27] answer and we think that being away from
[1:25:30] people is the safest place. But that's
[1:25:32] not always because we can turn, as David
[1:25:34] did, to the wrong thing. We can we can
[1:25:36] get involved in the wrong thing. And
[1:25:37] sometimes people with texting, you you
[1:25:40] can misinterpret text.
[1:25:43] Know why I'm saying all this? You can be
[1:25:46] misunderstood.
[1:25:47] David was misunderstood.
[1:25:50] And that was before text was around.
[1:25:52] Even more so with texting and sending a
[1:25:54] little message on, you know, people send
[1:25:56] their little messages on Facebook and
[1:25:59] they just send a little misguided
[1:26:02] missile to get a point across to
[1:26:03] somebody.
[1:26:05] You come with Come with me. I'll show
[1:26:07] you a Bible. You're supposed to go to
[1:26:08] that brother or sister face to face and
[1:26:10] resolve that.
[1:26:13] It's safer for me to just do it here and
[1:26:15] take my shots and my bombs from here.
[1:26:18] But things can be get misread. You can
[1:26:20] misread something. I was thinking about
[1:26:23] a funny thing a few weeks ago when I
[1:26:25] asked Henry how he lost all this weight.
[1:26:28] 55 60 pounds now. Way to go.
[1:26:32] And he's he said the the carnivore diet
[1:26:37] and I heard carnival.
[1:26:45] So I'm thinking funnel cakes, hot dogs,
[1:26:50] snow cones,
[1:26:52] deep fried Twinkies.
[1:26:55] I'm going, "How did you lose all the
[1:26:56] weight on that?" But hey, I'm in. I'm
[1:26:58] going for the carnival diet.
[1:27:01] carnivore
[1:27:02] only meat. But you can you see h I
[1:27:06] thought it was funny because it's how we
[1:27:07] can misinterpret and just hear it the
[1:27:09] wrong way. And if we do that when we're
[1:27:11] face to face, we'll definitely do that
[1:27:12] with text.
[1:27:14] And then the devil, brother Brand
[1:27:16] preaches the message God being
[1:27:17] misunderstood. What a powerful message
[1:27:20] because even God is misunderstood
[1:27:22] sometimes. And when you have
[1:27:24] misunderstandings with God and with one
[1:27:26] another because you didn't clear the
[1:27:28] air, the devil gets under
[1:27:30] misunderstandings
[1:27:32] and people run into their so-called
[1:27:34] hiding place, but they're not resolving
[1:27:36] it because they've taken a
[1:27:38] misunderstanding of something and
[1:27:40] they've tried to figure it out on their
[1:27:41] own. And I'm talking about running to
[1:27:43] the wrong place because we find that
[1:27:46] I've got to get back to David here, but
[1:27:47] in a short time of being anointed,
[1:27:49] slaying Goliath, raised to a leader in
[1:27:51] Saul's army to having to run from Saul
[1:27:53] and run for his life and find a place to
[1:27:55] hide in the biography of a man dested
[1:27:59] for the throne. In 1 Samuel, that whole
[1:28:02] book of the Bible, most of it is David
[1:28:04] being tested by a spirit against him and
[1:28:08] a pressure within the camp of Israel,
[1:28:10] within the people of Israel, mainly from
[1:28:12] the leader. That's the first biography
[1:28:14] of his life in the book of 2 Samuel is
[1:28:18] placed on the throne. So, I'm trying to
[1:28:20] point out to you, there's a season that
[1:28:22] you're anointed for the throne, but
[1:28:24] you're not positioned yet.
[1:28:27] And what happens in between being
[1:28:29] anointed and positioned and placed?
[1:28:33] There's a testing period.
[1:28:35] It's a character testing.
[1:28:38] You're being groomed for something.
[1:28:40] David was being groomed for something.
[1:28:42] And before the throne, there was a
[1:28:44] pressure uh a place that he needed to
[1:28:47] find. A place of confidence, a place of
[1:28:50] rest, a place of joy. We can look at our
[1:28:53] own lives that God will test us. That we
[1:28:56] learn to depend on being living in a
[1:28:58] place of confidence no matter what
[1:28:59] people says about you. A place of rest
[1:29:01] no matter what storms come in life. A
[1:29:04] place of joy no ma no matter how many
[1:29:06] killjoys you're around.
[1:29:09] No matter how negative people you're
[1:29:10] around. You could live in a home the
[1:29:12] whole home is negative all the time.
[1:29:14] Complaining all the time. Well, you
[1:29:16] either got to find your your place of
[1:29:18] joy or you got to move out of that home.
[1:29:21] Yeah, I'm not talking to you 5-year-olds
[1:29:24] now.
[1:29:27] But you got to find your place if you're
[1:29:29] going to live under that or you've got
[1:29:30] to move to another place because it's
[1:29:33] not good for you to live around
[1:29:35] negativity that influences y'all all the
[1:29:37] time. Said that to my son-in-law this
[1:29:39] morning. It's a negative world out
[1:29:41] there, isn't it? He said, "Yes." And if
[1:29:43] we're in a negative world, Josh said, if
[1:29:45] there's if we're in a negative world
[1:29:47] with negative spirits and everything's
[1:29:49] negative, everything's scary, everything
[1:29:51] negative, then we've got to really work
[1:29:53] to stay positive,
[1:29:56] to speak things positive, to find the
[1:29:59] good, to find the right thing. Because
[1:30:01] you're if you feel comfortable around
[1:30:03] gossips and complainers and those who
[1:30:06] are speaking against the pastor and the
[1:30:08] departments of the church, if you feel
[1:30:10] comfortable about that, you should look
[1:30:12] at yourself and see why you feel
[1:30:14] comfortable around that because you're
[1:30:16] never going to grow hanging around
[1:30:17] people like that.
[1:30:21] You got to find your place of joy. You
[1:30:23] got to find your place of being
[1:30:24] unaffected by accusations. Before the
[1:30:27] rapture, there's a place, not a physical
[1:30:29] place, but it's a state of mind. Living
[1:30:31] in a revelation above the enemies,
[1:30:33] threats and lies, living above those
[1:30:35] things. As David said, you set me up
[1:30:38] upon a rock so that it's above my
[1:30:40] enemies. That's the place. The first
[1:30:42] place David ran to, of course, was the
[1:30:44] enemy. And he joined with him, but that
[1:30:46] was a trap. Can you say amen? You can't
[1:30:49] hang around and view wrong things. You
[1:30:52] can't hang around the enemy's camp and
[1:30:54] get victories. You can't hang around
[1:30:57] your phone all the time and get
[1:30:58] victories. You got to get to a place
[1:31:01] that these things cause us to run to his
[1:31:04] hiding place. And this is what David
[1:31:06] learned.
[1:31:10] Let me go into a few things here talking
[1:31:12] about this
[1:31:14] kingdom age coming to us. David was
[1:31:17] anointed by a prophet in a simple
[1:31:18] incident. No one's seen just his family.
[1:31:22] Did not take the throne right away. Some
[1:31:24] things he went through. These are a few
[1:31:26] things I wrote years ago, but I brought
[1:31:27] it back up. Some things he went through.
[1:31:30] There was some things David had to go
[1:31:32] through first, but the kingdom age was
[1:31:34] coming. I believe when the kingdom is
[1:31:37] coming, there's a quiet preparation work
[1:31:40] going on in a minority. And David was a
[1:31:43] minority because God was grooming him
[1:31:45] for something different. When the
[1:31:47] kingdom age is coming, there's a quiet
[1:31:49] preparation going on in the lives who
[1:31:52] are destined for the throne. Yes,
[1:31:57] God is a trinity in the sense of
[1:31:59] different titles he works in. We don't
[1:32:02] believe the trinity here that God's a
[1:32:04] trinity in different persons. You can't
[1:32:06] that's not that's not even common sense
[1:32:08] to think that way. But God is a trinity
[1:32:10] in the sense of different titles that he
[1:32:12] works in. He's all one person, but he
[1:32:15] works in different father, son, holy
[1:32:16] ghost. He came in three sons names. The
[1:32:19] son of God, the son of man, and son of
[1:32:21] David. They were different offices that
[1:32:23] he was in. It's all him, but it's how he
[1:32:26] manifested himself. Everybody hanging on
[1:32:27] with me here? He came 2,000 years ago as
[1:32:31] son of man, even though the Jews called
[1:32:34] him the son of David. They kept
[1:32:35] referring him to son of David. Uh
[1:32:37] remember the gentile woman who called
[1:32:39] him that and he did not respond. But he
[1:32:42] did when she called him Lord. Son of God
[1:32:44] was in the church age. So now I'm
[1:32:46] skipping now. He came as son of man and
[1:32:49] then we realize he went into another
[1:32:51] phase of son of God for 2,000 years. The
[1:32:54] pouring out of the Holy Spirit or the
[1:32:55] Holy Spirit. And so that was a different
[1:32:57] it was the same God but it was in a
[1:33:00] different manifestation. Son of God
[1:33:02] after he came a son of man. Then he came
[1:33:05] a son of God in the church ages. The
[1:33:08] invisible God in the people continuing
[1:33:11] the works of Jesus Christ in spirit form
[1:33:14] because God is a spirit. In the last
[1:33:16] days, I'll pour out my spirit. He said
[1:33:18] that's what he did on the day of
[1:33:19] Pentecost. Uh uh men shall dream dreams.
[1:33:22] Uh young men shall see visions. Young
[1:33:24] young men see dream dreams. And I'll
[1:33:26] pour out my spirit upon all flesh.
[1:33:28] That's when it happened and began the
[1:33:29] son of God dispensation. But that is
[1:33:32] different than the son of man or the son
[1:33:34] of David. It's the And only bringing
[1:33:36] these things so that someone don't
[1:33:38] understand if hasn't heard this. This is
[1:33:40] very important. It's the whole
[1:33:42] congregation that that is now it when it
[1:33:45] moves from a son of man it's prophet
[1:33:48] it's more of a ministry of one man and
[1:33:50] then it breaks out into many as the
[1:33:53] congregation it's just God in a
[1:33:55] different form he came that way when he
[1:33:58] came as son of man missed him because
[1:34:00] they were expecting son of David the
[1:34:03] king they wanted to make Jesus a king
[1:34:06] but they're missing the office that he
[1:34:08] was in at the time he He didn't want to
[1:34:11] be referred to as son of David because
[1:34:13] he wasn't in that office.
[1:34:16] He was to come in that some 2,000 years
[1:34:18] ago as we come into the kingdom age, he
[1:34:20] would become the king of kings, the king
[1:34:22] of uh uh the king of David. In other
[1:34:25] words, he would become the king in a
[1:34:27] kingdom age. So now uh we have seen the
[1:34:32] son of man now in the last days. you
[1:34:35] know, uh, we have been 2,000 years as
[1:34:38] son of God. In the millennium, he's
[1:34:41] going to reign as son of David, and
[1:34:43] that's coming up real soon.
[1:34:46] But Jesus said there would be another
[1:34:48] small repeat of the son of man again in
[1:34:51] Luke 17:30 at the end time. Now,
[1:34:54] friends, you know, I just I want I don't
[1:34:56] want to be too deep deep here, but I
[1:34:58] just want you to realize a simple
[1:35:00] reason. God changes these dispensations
[1:35:03] for a reason.
[1:35:05] Why did he have to repeat the son of man
[1:35:07] again just before the son of David the
[1:35:10] kingdom age? There was a purpose. And if
[1:35:13] you look back in David's time that he
[1:35:16] was in a certain manner in 1 Samuel
[1:35:19] dealing with David getting him ready for
[1:35:21] the throne before he took the throne. So
[1:35:24] God has a manifestation time that what's
[1:35:27] he doing? He's doing something to groom
[1:35:30] his people for the kingdom age and to
[1:35:33] come in as son of David as king. Jesus
[1:35:36] said there'd be another repeat of son of
[1:35:38] man that all three be in his body but
[1:35:40] he'd be in the ministry in the ages.
[1:35:43] It's the whole congregation but in our
[1:35:45] day we see him come and a member of his
[1:35:47] body in a way that he never did before.
[1:35:51] I'm talking about the prophet of this
[1:35:53] hour and and a son of man revealing the
[1:35:56] son of man and the son of David part is
[1:35:59] in him but he's not king yet he's not
[1:36:02] queen yet but there is a people being
[1:36:05] prepared for the throne because it's not
[1:36:08] just king or Christ king of kings that
[1:36:12] comes to the throne he comes to the
[1:36:14] throne with his queen
[1:36:21] Hallelujah.
[1:36:23] You know, we know him more sometimes as
[1:36:27] son of God. And now we've got to know
[1:36:29] him as son of man because we've had that
[1:36:31] prophetic ministry come.
[1:36:34] And so in the son of God, everyone has a
[1:36:36] portion of the spirit. Now we come to
[1:36:39] know him through this office of son of
[1:36:40] man. It's so wonderful. It's a
[1:36:42] mysterious thing to the church world.
[1:36:44] And I can tell you that most of the
[1:36:46] church world in Christianity misses when
[1:36:48] he changes dispensations like this from
[1:36:51] son of God to son of man. But Jesus
[1:36:54] said, "I'll I'll I'll come again." Luke
[1:36:56] 17:30, even when the son of man is
[1:36:59] revealed, son of man, son of man. Most
[1:37:03] of the Christian world has missed it,
[1:37:04] but he's in a different office now.
[1:37:07] Not just the spirit of the Lord in his
[1:37:09] people. Not just Pentecost, but
[1:37:12] something even at a greater level, in a
[1:37:14] different level. He comes in the office
[1:37:17] of it's a mysterious thing to the
[1:37:19] church, but he comes in that office.
[1:37:21] We've been fellowshipping around the
[1:37:22] office of the son of man. Then we see
[1:37:24] this Messiah sign in the uh son of man,
[1:37:28] the same one of 2,000 years ago. But
[1:37:30] there's more. He said, "We're feeding on
[1:37:33] the body word of the son of man."
[1:37:36] So if we're feeding on the body word of
[1:37:39] the son of man, there's a substance that
[1:37:42] comes with this ministry of the son of
[1:37:43] man that we feed on and that we become.
[1:37:47] And I believe to sum up, it's it's
[1:37:50] molding us into another thing
[1:37:52] altogether. Not just to have the Holy
[1:37:56] Ghost like at the day of Pentecost, but
[1:37:58] actually coming under the son of man to
[1:38:01] come under anointing to prepare us for
[1:38:04] rulership. Can you say amen? Proof in
[1:38:08] scripture,
[1:38:10] Revelations 5, when the the book is
[1:38:12] open, the book of redemption, first
[1:38:14] thing that they begin to worship and
[1:38:16] say, he hath made us kings and priests.
[1:38:20] So the effect of the last days seals and
[1:38:23] book being open is not just that you get
[1:38:26] the Holy Ghost, but you're being groomed
[1:38:29] into kings and priests. Why? Cuz the
[1:38:33] kingdom age is coming.
[1:38:35] Why do we have so many environments
[1:38:37] that's only pushing just one thing? Just
[1:38:39] get the Holy Ghost. And I think we
[1:38:41] should always have that. I think a birth
[1:38:43] atmosphere should be created by the
[1:38:44] people of God that our young people
[1:38:46] could be birthed. That those who don't
[1:38:47] have the Holy Ghost should be birthed.
[1:38:49] But it's not just that that we preach.
[1:38:51] We're under a different administration
[1:38:52] now. That's not just to give us the Holy
[1:38:55] Ghost, but to take us, mold our lives,
[1:38:58] and to groom us, and train us,
[1:39:01] to take us through things, to give us a
[1:39:04] word that the rest of the world's saying
[1:39:05] that's not even important. But we're
[1:39:07] saying it's important because it come
[1:39:09] from God's prophet to get a bride ready
[1:39:12] for the millennium.
[1:39:15] It's not important to them. It's
[1:39:16] important to us even among our own
[1:39:19] ranks. They say that brother B saying
[1:39:20] that's not important and what he said
[1:39:21] about that. I won't get into specifics
[1:39:23] but a lot of people that's not
[1:39:24] important. Everything that he says is
[1:39:26] important to me.
[1:39:28] It has value.
[1:39:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:35] So we're feeding on the body word of the
[1:39:37] son of man. The son of man anoints a
[1:39:39] people for the throne. It's different
[1:39:40] than son of god. It's not the actions of
[1:39:43] the holy spirit. It's the character of
[1:39:45] the king. Amen.
[1:39:48] It's the character of Christ in his
[1:39:50] people that begins to take the limelight
[1:39:52] now. So now he's not grooming just just
[1:39:56] to have us the Holy Ghost, but he's the
[1:39:58] that what takes the limelight now is the
[1:40:00] character of Christ being groomed in the
[1:40:02] people. That's why many will miss this.
[1:40:04] There's a very small number being
[1:40:06] groomed for the throne. The world is in
[1:40:08] a place that praises. And I just want to
[1:40:10] make a comment about this uh concerning
[1:40:12] with the news that's come out the last
[1:40:14] couple days. And I say this
[1:40:16] respectfully, but we live in a world
[1:40:18] that in a place that and and maybe it's
[1:40:21] because even in the church world when
[1:40:24] the gifts of the spirit are manifested
[1:40:26] through the Holy Spirit. And you do know
[1:40:29] that anybody can come under that
[1:40:31] anointing and manifest a gift.
[1:40:34] That's right.
[1:40:36] My dad used to say at a little
[1:40:38] storefront church that he'd be preaching
[1:40:40] in, a drunk would come in and get under
[1:40:42] that anointing, prophesy, a true
[1:40:45] prophecy, and go back out to being a
[1:40:48] drunk.
[1:40:50] Now, why do I say that? Not because we
[1:40:52] don't believe in the gifts, but the
[1:40:54] gifts are a certain level that somebody
[1:40:56] can get under the anointing, but not be
[1:40:58] changed by the Holy Ghost. Number one,
[1:41:00] but not grow into the character of the
[1:41:02] Christ. what's more important, not just
[1:41:04] the gift. So, I say that to say we live
[1:41:06] in a world that has come to a place that
[1:41:09] uh well, I need to find my place in my
[1:41:12] notes. We live in a world that's come to
[1:41:14] a place that praises excellent gifts,
[1:41:20] but character
[1:41:22] does not matter. As long as we have the
[1:41:25] gift, it's an excellent gift and we're
[1:41:28] making money off of the gift.
[1:41:34] this what is it Shawn Diddy I think is
[1:41:36] his name the rap star it's such a
[1:41:39] grieving thing to see
[1:41:41] ah I have to be careful of being so
[1:41:43] rough because I know the man has a soul
[1:41:46] but such
[1:41:49] such amalistic perverted
[1:41:52] things and what scares me is men like
[1:41:55] this will get off
[1:41:58] you know why because people are more
[1:42:01] interested in keeping his gift going
[1:42:05] than even the perversions that he's
[1:42:08] done. He needs to be in jail now.
[1:42:12] But you see, it's it's the world we live
[1:42:15] in. And then recently, in the last
[1:42:17] couple days, something coming out about
[1:42:18] Michael Tate. He's a he was he's been in
[1:42:21] a couple groups. I think Christian rap,
[1:42:23] but also prominent groups for many, many
[1:42:26] years. Sexual m misconduct and drug
[1:42:29] abuse for years.
[1:42:31] And we're talking back in 2004 when it
[1:42:34] started. How in the world did this not
[1:42:36] get out by now? And I can tell and it's
[1:42:38] in the the article from the Christian
[1:42:40] magazine said it's been known and
[1:42:42] circulated in Nashville for years. And
[1:42:44] you're going really this is amongst the
[1:42:47] so-called Christian realm of Christian
[1:42:49] music, but all of it stays in the
[1:42:52] Nashville realm and it's been a known
[1:42:54] thing, but how does it after 25 years it
[1:42:57] doesn't get out?
[1:43:01] It's It's kind of hidden. And they
[1:43:03] called it an open secret in Nashville. I
[1:43:05] don't know what that is. An open secret.
[1:43:10] Why? Why? It's about protecting the
[1:43:13] celebrities and the gifts that they have
[1:43:16] to make money.
[1:43:19] My point is, it's not about their
[1:43:22] character. It's about their gift.
[1:43:30] We are not called to that.
[1:43:34] We are not called to be a part of that
[1:43:36] type of mindset.
[1:43:39] We are trans transitioning into a
[1:43:41] kingdom age and mo moving away from an
[1:43:45] emphasis putting put on the gifts of a
[1:43:48] person. What gifts do you have? Praise
[1:43:50] the Lord. Use those gifts. But the
[1:43:53] emphasis is not on the gift and not
[1:43:55] their character. We're in a transition
[1:43:57] preparing a people to rule and reign for
[1:43:59] a kingdom age
[1:44:01] where you I could probably say that
[1:44:05] gifts won't be emphasized so much in
[1:44:07] that at all. It's not good when we let
[1:44:09] that approach come in our ranks and let
[1:44:12] me just speak against our preachers
[1:44:14] maybe become that way but it comes about
[1:44:16] the gift. We lift up preachers. We maybe
[1:44:20] lift up singers. We lift them to a
[1:44:21] certain place and we give them a free
[1:44:24] pass sometimes because of their gift.
[1:44:27] Let's not let that type of mentality
[1:44:30] come in our own ranks in the message.
[1:44:33] We're being groomed for something
[1:44:35] different than just lifting up gifts and
[1:44:38] making celebrities.
[1:44:45] What am I preaching? I'm preaching what
[1:44:47] are we hiding from?
[1:44:52] God, hide me from it. This is one thing.
[1:44:55] Hide me from the world's way of doing
[1:44:57] things.
[1:44:59] Hide me from Hollywood.
[1:45:02] Hide me from the way the Christian world
[1:45:05] buys into all that. Hide me from all of
[1:45:09] that.
[1:45:12] I'm preaching. What are we hiding from?
[1:45:15] And notice the scene changes in
[1:45:17] Revelations 3. And
[1:45:21] brother Brandon brings out that we have
[1:45:22] a Christ in a rejection mode, being
[1:45:25] rejected just as David was before he
[1:45:27] came to the throne. All through the
[1:45:28] church ages, he's there. But the last
[1:45:30] church age, it says Jesus is on the
[1:45:32] outside knocking, trying to get into
[1:45:35] that church. So now we have the rejected
[1:45:37] king. Just like David, we have a
[1:45:39] rejected king. The king of kings is on
[1:45:42] the outside of the church trying to get
[1:45:44] in. They're going forth with all their
[1:45:46] things that they're doing, but he Christ
[1:45:48] the word is on the outside trying to get
[1:45:50] in. And you know what he says that he,
[1:45:52] you know, you know the the the the
[1:45:55] Leonian church age admonition to all of
[1:45:57] us. But I'll just pull out one thing. He
[1:46:00] said, "He that overcomes, I'll tell you
[1:46:02] what, let's just read it because uh I
[1:46:07] you've got time
[1:46:10] and you have time because I just told
[1:46:12] you you have time. Revelations chapter
[1:46:15] 3, the Leosian church age. Here we are
[1:46:18] under church of the Leosia. Verse 14,
[1:46:21] right? These things sayith, amen, the
[1:46:23] faithful and true witness, the beginning
[1:46:25] of the creation of God. I know thy works
[1:46:27] that thou art neither cold nor hot. I
[1:46:29] would that thou work cold or hot. So
[1:46:31] then, you know, let us pray that we'd be
[1:46:34] on fire for God. Let us pray that we
[1:46:37] have Christians that are sold out to
[1:46:39] this word,
[1:46:41] not just in it.
[1:46:44] So then, because you're lukewarm and
[1:46:46] neither cold nor I, I will spew thee out
[1:46:47] of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I'm
[1:46:49] rich and increase with goods, and have
[1:46:51] need of nothing, and knowest not that
[1:46:53] thou art wretched and miserable, and
[1:46:54] poor, and blind, and naked. I counsel
[1:46:57] thee to buy me gold tried in the fire,
[1:46:58] that thou mayest be rich, and white
[1:47:00] raignment, that thou mayest be clothed,
[1:47:02] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[1:47:04] appear, and anoint thine eyes with Isa,
[1:47:06] that thou mayest see. As many as I love,
[1:47:09] I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous
[1:47:11] therefore and repent. Behold, I stand at
[1:47:14] the door and knock. If any man hear my
[1:47:16] voice and open the door, I will come
[1:47:19] into him and will s with him and he with
[1:47:22] me. Sounds like a secret place.
[1:47:26] You open up to him. It's you and him.
[1:47:29] Can you say amen? But look at this. To
[1:47:31] him that overcomer. Overcometh. How many
[1:47:35] would raise your hand say praise the
[1:47:36] Lord. There's got to be some overcomers
[1:47:38] to the lukewarm leodysian age. There's
[1:47:41] got to be some people that are sold out,
[1:47:44] not lukewarm.
[1:47:47] To him that overcomemeth will I grant to
[1:47:51] sit with me in my throne,
[1:47:54] even as I overcame and is sat down with
[1:47:58] my father in his throne. What's what's
[1:48:01] the the prize for overcoming this age?
[1:48:05] What's the ultimate end? You have an
[1:48:08] invitation to the throne.
[1:48:13] That's the prize of this age.
[1:48:16] You have an invitation
[1:48:18] to the throne.
[1:48:21] Christ is rejected in this age. But
[1:48:23] those who invite him in, he's Christ
[1:48:26] trying to knock on the church aids that
[1:48:27] rejected him and then offers an
[1:48:29] invitation for us to the throne. He has
[1:48:32] already come. Now, he has invited us to
[1:48:34] not only over overcome, but he's
[1:48:36] entering the time of son of David. He's
[1:48:39] bringing us in with him. We're in that
[1:48:41] time. We will be prepared for it. It's
[1:48:44] inviting us to the throne. Not another
[1:48:47] healing revival.
[1:48:49] What is that? The last church age.
[1:48:51] What's the invitation to? Not another
[1:48:53] healing revival. Not a pouring out of
[1:48:56] his spirit on all flesh again. No, it
[1:48:59] doesn't say that. It doesn't say he that
[1:49:01] overcomes will have a lot of great
[1:49:03] spiritual moves of God. No. He will sit
[1:49:06] with me in my throne. Some think if we
[1:49:08] don't have a shouting time, God is not
[1:49:10] doing anything. That's not true. We had
[1:49:12] a shouting time this morning. We will
[1:49:14] continue to do them. But God is doing a
[1:49:17] deeper work than just a healing revival.
[1:49:19] The word of God says, "He that overcomes
[1:49:22] this age," where are we going? It's an
[1:49:24] invitation to the throne.
[1:49:26] We're being groomed to rule and reign.
[1:49:30] I'd rather be groomed and ready for
[1:49:32] that, friends, than just a feeling or an
[1:49:35] emotion or something like that, a
[1:49:37] temporary feeling. I want my character
[1:49:40] to be molded into a kingdom character.
[1:49:46] So, hiding place. I talked I didn't I
[1:49:49] hope you're not offended. I could be
[1:49:51] very I could break into other venues of
[1:49:54] Christian music. And from what these
[1:49:57] magazines say, this is prevalent going
[1:49:59] on within the Christian realms. You know
[1:50:01] what it is? We got to hide from this
[1:50:04] lifting a gift because Saul where he
[1:50:06] lost it. The reason he got jealousy is
[1:50:08] because his gift
[1:50:10] he was comparing his gift. Now they got
[1:50:12] another another kid's rising up.
[1:50:16] How can I hold on to and maintain my
[1:50:19] position?
[1:50:21] It wasn't about character. It was about
[1:50:23] his position.
[1:50:25] So, it was about his gift. It was about
[1:50:26] who he was. And so, he turned his guns
[1:50:29] towards David because why? And if David
[1:50:31] needed to be groomed in something, one
[1:50:33] thing he needed to hide from is becoming
[1:50:36] like Saul. Can you say amen?
[1:50:39] He dealt with a person like Saul. I
[1:50:42] believe every son and daughter of God
[1:50:44] will eventually have an interaction with
[1:50:46] a Saul.
[1:50:49] more than likely in the message ranks
[1:50:52] because those two characters that thing
[1:50:55] plays out all the time amongst the body
[1:50:58] of Christ.
[1:51:01] David, a man after God's own heart.
[1:51:03] David
[1:51:05] being groomed in the character for
[1:51:07] something and then a man who turns down
[1:51:10] that grooming of his character and turns
[1:51:13] to his own way and then that person
[1:51:16] turns against David. I believe every son
[1:51:19] and daughter of God will eventually have
[1:51:20] an interaction with Saul. And it's a
[1:51:22] test. Do you want to become a David or
[1:51:25] do you want to become a Saul?
[1:51:29] Lord, hide me from becoming a Saul.
[1:51:33] Don't forget Saul was anointed by the
[1:51:35] same prophet.
[1:51:37] But Lord, don't let me. Lord, hide me
[1:51:41] from becoming Saul.
[1:51:44] What happened to Saul? He wasn't a
[1:51:46] heathen. He was right there part of
[1:51:48] God's own people. He's king of God's
[1:51:49] people. He believed the same way David
[1:51:51] did. Saul being right next to David was
[1:51:54] a contrast to David. He became an
[1:51:56] instrument to mold character in him.
[1:51:57] Saul was a believer, but he had
[1:51:59] something in him. God tested him to
[1:52:01] bring that out. Finally, it was
[1:52:02] manifested. He is struggling within
[1:52:04] himself and struggling in his
[1:52:06] relationship with God. And instead of
[1:52:08] just turning to God and dealing with
[1:52:11] that, he turns his javelin at someone
[1:52:14] who is at peace, who is anointed.
[1:52:18] Saul lost his anointing, so he turns his
[1:52:20] javelin towards someone who has peace
[1:52:23] and just behaving himself, serving God
[1:52:26] in simplicity, in humility. And friends,
[1:52:29] you're going to get javelins shot at you
[1:52:32] when you're trying to just live that
[1:52:34] simple, humble life.
[1:52:37] David has not one ounce of bad feelings
[1:52:39] towards in his heart towards Saul. But
[1:52:41] now David will have to experience
[1:52:43] someone trying to kill him and kill his
[1:52:45] influence. The big thing God is teaching
[1:52:47] David first is how to respond to all
[1:52:51] this. To not let his heart become
[1:52:54] bitter, to not let his heart become a
[1:52:57] Saul no matter what. David had no motive
[1:53:01] to remove him or undermine his
[1:53:03] leadership. You all know the story. He
[1:53:05] would never. He had no motive to get an
[1:53:07] iron and fight against Saul. I won't
[1:53:09] touch God's anointed. He runs from it.
[1:53:12] David has no motive to remove Saul or
[1:53:15] undermine his leadership at all. When
[1:53:17] the sword gets hurled at him, he just
[1:53:20] dodges it. When the javelins come, he
[1:53:22] just dodges it and he runs. Human nature
[1:53:25] would make us pick up another javelin
[1:53:27] and throw back at him,
[1:53:30] but he can't do that because he's been
[1:53:31] groomed for the throne.
[1:53:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:36] There's a lot of things the last couple
[1:53:37] years I said, I sure need to defend
[1:53:40] myself in that. I that brother needs to
[1:53:42] be set straight
[1:53:44] and I give it up and I run to my hiding
[1:53:47] place
[1:53:49] because some things are just not not
[1:53:51] worth it.
[1:54:01] David was handed perfect opportunities
[1:54:03] to kill Saul himself,
[1:54:06] to kill his influence. And he didn't do
[1:54:08] it. He said, "That's God's anointing."
[1:54:10] He had to overcome the urge. He had to
[1:54:12] hide from the urge to strike back in
[1:54:15] revenge and completely give up revenge.
[1:54:20] What was David wanting to hide from?
[1:54:22] Becoming bitter like Saul.
[1:54:25] responding the same way as the ones who
[1:54:27] are treating you bad. Hide from that.
[1:54:30] Hiding from becoming a Saul ourselves by
[1:54:33] hanging around them. We're called to be
[1:54:35] molded for the throne, not become bitter
[1:54:37] people. Saul was in a group of
[1:54:39] believers. David was able to see a
[1:54:42] contrast right within his own ranks, a
[1:54:44] difference. Oh Lord, help me to break
[1:54:46] express this. Saul being in the message
[1:54:49] and David being in the message, David
[1:54:51] was able to see a contrast of two
[1:54:54] different characters. I think of when I
[1:54:56] was a young preacher and I was invited
[1:54:58] by different ones to come different
[1:54:59] places and and an older minister asked
[1:55:02] me to go. He was doing different youth
[1:55:04] camps and different things and I don't
[1:55:06] know what it is but I just felt checked
[1:55:08] in my heart not to form a union. I could
[1:55:11] shake the brother's hand. I could send
[1:55:12] him an offering. and I could support it,
[1:55:14] but I just held in linking myself up
[1:55:16] with that. There was something in me
[1:55:18] that says, I have a choice who I want to
[1:55:21] really join in and put my gift in.
[1:55:25] My gift was given to me by God. It's
[1:55:27] important where that gift is placed in.
[1:55:31] Lest it should become tainted.
[1:55:34] I'm protecting. I'm watching over that
[1:55:36] gift. God gave it to me. And so, I back
[1:55:39] off. You know, that person, they ended
[1:55:41] up becoming a Saul. They ended up
[1:55:43] controlling. They ended up looking like
[1:55:45] a thing where they wanted to control
[1:55:46] young minister. I say, "Thank God that I
[1:55:48] kept myself away from that." Not in
[1:55:51] every situation. I did that. I fell into
[1:55:53] some things. But I'll tell you, there's
[1:55:55] something in my heart. Lord, if you see
[1:55:57] those characteristics of Saul, you pray
[1:56:00] for them, you respect them, but you say,
[1:56:02] "Lord, don't let me hang around that
[1:56:04] because I don't want to become that type
[1:56:06] of character."
[1:56:08] You still with me this morning?
[1:56:10] David was able to see a right contrast
[1:56:12] within his own ranks, within the
[1:56:14] message, same prophet, a difference.
[1:56:18] God, hide me from becoming that. That's
[1:56:20] not what I want to be. You are molding
[1:56:22] me for something greater down the road
[1:56:24] until I get there. Hide me from being
[1:56:26] influenced or intimidated by this other
[1:56:28] side that's among us. Hide me from
[1:56:31] misunderstandings. Hide me from the
[1:56:34] wrong thing that I see in that
[1:56:35] character. Hide me from negative people.
[1:56:38] Hide me from a negative world.
[1:56:41] Psalm 64:2 says, if you I'm going to
[1:56:44] bring these scriptures as I try to bring
[1:56:45] it to a close. Hide me from the secret
[1:56:48] counsel of the wicked. These are the
[1:56:50] things that David said to hide him from.
[1:56:52] He said, "Hide me from the secret
[1:56:54] counsel of the wicked, from the
[1:56:55] insurrection of the workers of
[1:56:57] iniquity." It says in the amplified,
[1:56:59] "Hide me from the secret counsel and
[1:57:01] conspiracy of the ungodly ungodly, from
[1:57:04] the scheming of those who do wrong."
[1:57:07] These are things David said to hide me
[1:57:09] from.
[1:57:11] There's more. Psalms 31:15. Deliver me
[1:57:13] from the hand of my enemies and from
[1:57:15] them that persecute me.
[1:57:18] Some more places in Psalm. Deliver me
[1:57:20] from the deceitful and unjust man.
[1:57:24] Another place. Deliver me from the blood
[1:57:26] guiltiness. Deliver me from mine
[1:57:27] enemies, oh my God. Defend me from those
[1:57:29] that rise up against me. Deliver me from
[1:57:32] the workers of iniquity and save me from
[1:57:34] bloody men. Deliver me from the
[1:57:36] oppression of man. So will I keep thy
[1:57:39] pre precepts. Can you imagine? Deliver
[1:57:41] me. Hide me from the oppression of man.
[1:57:46] Rid me and deliver me from the hand of
[1:57:48] strange children. That's an interesting
[1:57:51] one. Deliver me from the hand of strange
[1:57:53] children. I I I can't say that. I didn't
[1:57:55] think about my own children that are
[1:57:57] strange sometimes.
[1:58:02] Deliver me from the hand of strange
[1:58:04] children whose mouth speak of vanity and
[1:58:06] their right hand is the right hand of
[1:58:07] falsehood. Psalm 71:3 Be thou my strong
[1:58:11] habitation where unto I may continually
[1:58:14] resort. Thou hast given commandment to
[1:58:16] save me for thou art my rock and my
[1:58:19] fortress. I'll leave you with Psalms 91.
[1:58:21] You can read it at home. It's so good
[1:58:23] because it continues to bring out what
[1:58:25] David is saying. I need you to hide
[1:58:27] from. And I just want you to notice as I
[1:58:29] bring it down to a close is that you
[1:58:31] would think he'd be saying hide me from
[1:58:33] the camps of the enemies. But you know
[1:58:35] what he's mostly saying? Hide me from
[1:58:38] people. And what mostly what people are
[1:58:41] doing.
[1:58:43] Most of these scriptures to deliver him
[1:58:45] from are related to people.
[1:58:48] They're related to people.
[1:58:51] Not armies, not things like that. It's
[1:58:54] people who are against. It's people who
[1:58:57] influence you towards negative. It's
[1:58:59] people that oppress you. It's people
[1:59:02] that that persecute you. It's we have to
[1:59:05] say, "Lord, hide me from these
[1:59:08] influences." I could preach a whole
[1:59:10] sermon on hide me from the influences of
[1:59:12] the world. We should know that and we
[1:59:14] should do that. But now internally, hide
[1:59:16] me because every person gives off a
[1:59:19] certain energy. Brother Abraham says,
[1:59:22] "There's certain people, you know, you
[1:59:23] don't like to say it, but there's some
[1:59:24] people you just love to be around. You
[1:59:26] feel comfortable. You feel you can be
[1:59:28] yourself, and there's other people,
[1:59:30] they're very nice people, but it's
[1:59:31] difficult to be around them because
[1:59:33] everybody gives off an energy and
[1:59:35] everybody has a certain slant and
[1:59:37] everybody gives off certain thing. And
[1:59:38] guess what? You're going to have to
[1:59:40] limit yourself and hide yourself from
[1:59:42] the wrong type of people. You say,
[1:59:44] "Well, don't get around him." No, we
[1:59:46] don't have that choice. Sometimes you're
[1:59:47] going to hide yourself with the Lord of
[1:59:49] being influenced by their manner.
[1:59:56] And I'll bring up the quote which is in
[1:59:58] harmony with this that I read at the
[2:00:00] last last Sunday. I don't want you to
[2:00:02] miss this. Have you ever come to a
[2:00:04] place, Brother Bram says, have you ever
[2:00:06] come to a place in life where Christ
[2:00:09] meant more to you than all the arguing
[2:00:11] you could do about your church? Now I
[2:00:14] just read you all the places in David
[2:00:16] where mostly it was people and the way
[2:00:20] they were being that David asked to be
[2:00:22] hidden from
[2:00:24] and now many places in the hidden life
[2:00:27] in all these early messages it's about
[2:00:30] being hidden from look at this
[2:00:34] have you come to a place in life where
[2:00:35] Christ meant more to you all the arguing
[2:00:37] you could do about your church oh that
[2:00:39] doesn't happen in the message at All
[2:00:44] not
[2:00:47] has Christ meant more to you than all
[2:00:49] the world.
[2:00:52] I don't mean from an emotional or a
[2:00:54] mental workup. Isn't that interesting?
[2:00:56] The two sides. There's an emotional
[2:00:59] workup and there's a mental workup. And
[2:01:01] you can be all worked up by either
[2:01:03] thing, but that's not living in the
[2:01:06] hidden place with Christ. That's just
[2:01:08] being worked up by something.
[2:01:10] We've had both in the message for some
[2:01:11] 60 years now. Slant towards the
[2:01:14] intellectual. It's just the quotes. It's
[2:01:16] all intellectual. You figure out all the
[2:01:18] seven seals. You got you're in the
[2:01:19] rapture. And then you have this swing
[2:01:21] towards emotionalism and Pentecostalism
[2:01:24] and it feels good. Brother Bram says,
[2:01:27] "No, no, that's not what I'm talking
[2:01:28] about. Have you ever come to the place
[2:01:30] that you that that Christ meant more to
[2:01:33] the world? I don't mean from emotional
[2:01:35] word. I mean from the depths of your
[2:01:36] heart that's something settled settled
[2:01:39] in there that's something taking place
[2:01:40] that you don't know how it come but
[2:01:43] you're hid away and your whole motive is
[2:01:45] to serve Jesus Christ have you entered
[2:01:48] that place my dear brother have you come
[2:01:50] into that place where you don't care
[2:01:54] what anyone says
[2:02:00] I haven't been there all the time but I
[2:02:03] want to live in there every day.
[2:02:06] And he says, "It's not that you have an
[2:02:07] attitude and act smart that I don't care
[2:02:09] cuz you I don't care. I don't care. I
[2:02:11] don't care." No, no, no. That's the
[2:02:13] wrong attitude. But it's it's being
[2:02:15] insulated from that affecting you in
[2:02:19] that hidden place. You see? And so he
[2:02:21] says, "Where have you come to that place
[2:02:22] where you don't care what anyone says?
[2:02:24] Not to go out and expart, but till the
[2:02:26] love of God is so anchored into your
[2:02:27] heart. Have you come to the place that
[2:02:29] you don't care what anyone says?" I just
[2:02:31] want to just say, you know, that's where
[2:02:34] this hidden place, what are we hiding
[2:02:36] from? Stuff like this.
[2:02:39] We're too affected by it. We're too
[2:02:41] affected by what our boss says. We're
[2:02:43] too affected by what our husband or wife
[2:02:47] says.
[2:02:52] We're too affected sometimes by
[2:02:55] something that's said that's not a
[2:02:57] correct conclusion or diagnosis of
[2:02:59] things.
[2:03:01] We're too affected by it. We come have
[2:03:04] you come into a place where you don't
[2:03:05] care what anyone says. Not to go out and
[2:03:07] exart but to the love of God is so
[2:03:10] anchored into you that you can't see
[2:03:12] nothing else. Your whole motive is to do
[2:03:15] the will of God. Love for everybody
[2:03:18] flowing free from everywhere.
[2:03:21] You you see the song lyric I sent you
[2:03:23] last Monday. Old song. There is a quiet
[2:03:27] place.
[2:03:30] far from this rapid race. And I love the
[2:03:34] last line. It says that we when we come
[2:03:37] out of there
[2:03:39] to live each day a new day with love for
[2:03:43] all mankind.
[2:03:46] You live in that place. There isn't any
[2:03:48] other result except the love of God. Not
[2:03:52] fighting, not being influenced by them,
[2:03:54] not joining in with the fight. Amen. But
[2:03:58] I'm here in a place and I would rather
[2:04:00] you draw you into that love than for you
[2:04:03] to draw me out. You remember the guy the
[2:04:05] maniac and brother Brand said he was
[2:04:07] trying to get me to fight with him.
[2:04:11] True.
[2:04:14] He was trying to get me to come into the
[2:04:16] same spirit and pull me out of the
[2:04:18] perfect love. And later he called it
[2:04:20] perfect love. He was in an atmosphere
[2:04:22] and I looked at that man that was a
[2:04:25] maniac getting ready with his fist up
[2:04:27] spit in his face and he said something
[2:04:30] come over me. He said oh I wish I could
[2:04:32] have that all the time.
[2:04:35] Something come over him and he says I
[2:04:38] looked I felt pity for him. Where did I
[2:04:40] was in the
[2:04:42] I was in the hospital. My mom looks like
[2:04:45] she's not feeling well. She just headed
[2:04:46] home. I had to take her to urgent care
[2:04:49] Tuesday and we were in there all day
[2:04:54] and I'll share this with you. I was so
[2:04:57] broken cuz we were in a room and then
[2:05:00] there was another bed in the room and
[2:05:01] they brought this man and there was
[2:05:03] eight policemen with this man.
[2:05:06] He didn't hardly have any clothes on. He
[2:05:08] tattoos all over his body and he was
[2:05:11] just loud and cussing and arrogant. And
[2:05:15] I was going, "Oh no, they're bringing I
[2:05:17] don't know why they're bringing in
[2:05:18] because my mom, she needed to rest. I
[2:05:20] was getting her kind of figure out what
[2:05:22] was going on." And then I would take her
[2:05:23] home, but she needed to sleep because
[2:05:25] she didn't sleep the whole night before.
[2:05:27] This man was crazy. They brought him in.
[2:05:28] And you know, then slowly the as they
[2:05:32] they got him, they didn't get him
[2:05:33] settled down, but it was just the nurses
[2:05:35] with him. And I'm going, if this guy
[2:05:37] took six, eight cops to bring in here,
[2:05:40] why are the cops leaving?
[2:05:43] My mom's in here. I'm in here,
[2:05:50] you know, and I don't get exposed to a
[2:05:52] lot of this stuff, but I was so critical
[2:05:54] at first and I I thought, my goodness,
[2:05:56] this and and I was looking at it. But
[2:05:58] then, you know, there's something about
[2:06:00] when somebody's and he was, you know,
[2:06:02] overdosed or just on drugs. I don't know
[2:06:05] what kind of drugs, but he was a mess.
[2:06:06] There's quite a few cases of drugs. It
[2:06:09] was on Tuesday in the in the hospital's
[2:06:11] rooms that day. So, I got to see this
[2:06:14] firsthand. And quite often when drugs
[2:06:16] numb a person, I remember my uncle Jim
[2:06:20] when he would get drunk on alcohol, uh,
[2:06:23] he was the most religious person, the
[2:06:25] nicest person. Talk to dad about how
[2:06:28] well he raised his family. U,
[2:06:31] hardly any cousin except what they call
[2:06:34] nice cousin.
[2:06:36] He was just and he talked about God and
[2:06:38] he talked about this and he talked about
[2:06:40] his real problems because they're numb
[2:06:44] to the regular
[2:06:46] thought process and the actually the
[2:06:48] demonic forces against their thinking
[2:06:51] that puts them in a certain mode that
[2:06:53] they never accept Christ. But when you
[2:06:55] numb all that then they look at life a
[2:06:57] little bit. See see and that's where the
[2:06:59] Holy Ghost kind of numbs us from life's
[2:07:01] things a little bit where we look at
[2:07:03] things through the eyes of Christ. But
[2:07:04] you see I see it with him. So this guy
[2:07:07] he was way on drugs but he be to in that
[2:07:10] hospital room
[2:07:12] talk about what he come from
[2:07:15] and I was almost weeping to see the kind
[2:07:18] of childhood and he actually I wrote the
[2:07:21] quote down that he said he said my
[2:07:23] biggest fuss is that why is there such
[2:07:26] injustice and cruel things done to the
[2:07:28] children in our generation? Yeah. And he
[2:07:31] was speaking of himself and all the
[2:07:33] children. And he he was right. It's
[2:07:35] terrible how children are treated. It's
[2:07:39] terrible the environments that children
[2:07:40] are placed in. It's terrible what
[2:07:42] they're allowed to watch.
[2:07:45] Innocence is lost. But this was an
[2:07:47] extreme case where he was he was beaten.
[2:07:50] He was tortured. He was tortured with
[2:07:53] fire. He just goes and and the more I
[2:07:55] got into it and he was still cussing his
[2:07:57] head. So I had to ask him to move mom to
[2:07:59] a different room. But my heart went out
[2:08:02] to him to realize that
[2:08:08] Satan can take somebody that far
[2:08:12] and that kind of background. It's it's
[2:08:15] not fair
[2:08:17] that somebody ends up that extreme of a
[2:08:20] situation. So mentally gone.
[2:08:24] And I tell you, when you're in a world
[2:08:26] like that, you want to be in a place
[2:08:30] with the Lord to be available
[2:08:35] because that thing it could affect you
[2:08:37] and you could become, you know, a bit
[2:08:39] mental yourself trying to figure out
[2:08:41] what's going on. But you I had a care
[2:08:43] and a love for him seeing where he came
[2:08:45] from. But
[2:08:48] it's such a strong spirit. You can be
[2:08:50] influenced by it. We need to be in a
[2:08:53] place of such strong love of God that we
[2:08:56] know where we stand
[2:08:58] and the love of God can overflow from
[2:09:00] us. We're not being influenced but be
[2:09:03] we're being an influence to them. Can
[2:09:06] you say amen?
[2:09:10] What did David had to hide from? Well,
[2:09:12] trying to point out to you as we close
[2:09:14] now the musicians physicians can come.
[2:09:19] There's a lot of things that we need to
[2:09:20] hide from.
[2:09:33] CJ Williams said, "Here are three things
[2:09:35] that make the unbeliever want to get
[2:09:36] away from it all." And he talks a little
[2:09:38] bit about how we have we plan vacations
[2:09:42] and we want to get away from it all and
[2:09:44] we want to go and that's all fine.
[2:09:45] That's great. But sometimes that can't
[2:09:48] replace the hiding place and the getting
[2:09:50] away from everything like the hiding
[2:09:52] place in Christ.
[2:09:54] See people go on vacations and they're
[2:09:56] more angry when they come home from
[2:09:57] vacation.
[2:09:59] You get a vacation at all. They're more
[2:10:01] mad at each other
[2:10:04] because you're not in Christ enough.
[2:10:11] I don't always live up to the quote that
[2:10:13] we have up there as as much as I want
[2:10:15] to. This week I I overreacted and I
[2:10:19] spoke a bit harshly to my daughter. Had
[2:10:22] to come back and repent to my daughter
[2:10:24] and my granddaughter.
[2:10:27] Ellie, I always want to do that because
[2:10:31] there's never a justification for things
[2:10:33] that are done disrespectful.
[2:10:38] But I know my desire is I want to live
[2:10:41] in that place that he's talking about
[2:10:42] every day.
[2:10:45] David had to learn that his reactions
[2:10:48] and his responses to a Saul. His
[2:10:52] reactions is what he wanted to have a
[2:10:54] hiding place. Though his reactions were
[2:10:57] a Christlike reaction.
[2:11:00] CJ Williams said, "Here are the three
[2:11:02] things that make a believer want to get
[2:11:03] away from it all, but things that should
[2:11:05] move us to flee to Christ and find our
[2:11:07] hiding place." Number one, worry. Worry.
[2:11:11] We want to hide from worry. This
[2:11:13] includes all the what-ifs that we
[2:11:15] entertain, the bad possibilities we play
[2:11:18] out in our minds, and all the variables
[2:11:20] of life that we cannot control. If you
[2:11:23] feel overcome by worry, hide yourself in
[2:11:26] the Lord.
[2:11:28] Be still in his presence. Find comfort
[2:11:30] in the truth of his word and recognize
[2:11:32] that your life is hidden with Christ in
[2:11:35] God. So we hide ourselves from worry.
[2:11:37] The next one, we hide ourselves from
[2:11:39] conflict. If you are at odds with
[2:11:40] someone and you find yourself angry and
[2:11:42] fed up, you don't need to stew over the
[2:11:44] situation and plot your next move. You
[2:11:47] need the guidance of the Lord and the
[2:11:48] spiritual composure to re-engage the
[2:11:51] problem with grace and with love that
[2:11:53] comes from the Holy Spirit before you go
[2:11:55] back to that person. First, go hide
[2:11:58] yourself in the Lord.
[2:12:00] The third thing is weariness.
[2:12:04] This may be another pandemic around us.
[2:12:06] People are busy and too busy and too
[2:12:11] tired from being too busy.
[2:12:16] We need to do better at focusing on what
[2:12:18] is truly important.
[2:12:21] But the fact is that if you seek to be
[2:12:24] faithful and diligent in your calling,
[2:12:26] you will have a busy life. Of course,
[2:12:29] God designed it that way, but also gave
[2:12:32] us himself as a hiding place.
[2:12:37] If you ever find yourself feeling just
[2:12:39] plain tired, hide yourself in Christ.
[2:12:45] Don't run to some other so-called safe
[2:12:48] place that you think. Run to Jesus.
[2:12:52] If I'm going to run, I'm going to run to
[2:12:55] Jesus. Amen. I'm going to run to Jesus
[2:12:59] into
[2:13:01] thy chamber.
[2:13:05] Be free. Holy
[2:13:08] Spirit.
[2:13:10] Speak to
[2:13:12] me gently
[2:13:15] as I close
[2:13:18] the door. Let's stand together.
[2:13:22] Heaven
[2:13:24] we lover
[2:13:27] let thy presence
[2:13:30] since cover
[2:13:33] shakana
[2:13:36] unend me
[2:13:39] is what I long for. Into that chamber.
[2:13:45] into
[2:13:48] my chamber
[2:13:51] be free. Oh,
[2:13:54] the spirit
[2:13:57] speak to
[2:14:00] me gently
[2:14:03] as I close
[2:14:06] the door.
[2:14:08] [Music]
[2:14:09] Heavenly
[2:14:12] lover,
[2:14:15] let thy breath
[2:14:18] since cover
[2:14:23] une
[2:14:26] [Music]
[2:14:27] is what I
[2:14:30] long for.
[2:14:32] Go into
[2:14:35] [Music]
[2:14:39] our Jesus be free. Holy
[2:14:43] Spirit
[2:14:46] speak to
[2:14:48] me
[2:14:51] as I close
[2:14:54] the door.
[2:14:58] Heavenly
[2:15:01] lover
[2:15:03] that thy presence
[2:15:06] since covering
[2:15:10] [Music]
[2:15:14] me
[2:15:16] is what I
[2:15:19] hope for.
[2:15:21] Would you lay your hands on one another?
[2:15:27] My precious
[2:15:29] Lord Jesus,
[2:15:31] [Music]
[2:15:35] I just want to take this moment and
[2:15:37] speak to you again.
[2:15:39] Tell you how much I love you, Lord.
[2:15:45] With all the things, Lord, that comes in
[2:15:46] our life.
[2:15:48] I want to say thank you that this
[2:15:50] started as a relationship at 16 years
[2:15:53] old with you,
[2:15:55] person of Christ.
[2:15:58] Lord, my prayer is nothing, no person,
[2:16:01] no influence, no
[2:16:05] pressure
[2:16:07] would ever take away
[2:16:10] from that relationship that started when
[2:16:13] I was 16 years old.
[2:16:15] In fact, Lord,
[2:16:19] restore me back to all of that, Lord.
[2:16:21] that that is the only and the most
[2:16:23] important thing in my life is just that
[2:16:26] inner chamber where you speak to me
[2:16:29] gently.
[2:16:30] I close the door from all the other
[2:16:32] things and pressures.
[2:16:36] Lord, today we're in a time of rejoicing
[2:16:38] for you, showing you as the great healer
[2:16:41] again.
[2:16:43] that the stripes upon your back, Lord,
[2:16:45] are still we're still seeing the value
[2:16:48] of that, Lord, and bringing healing to
[2:16:51] my family, my sister, and many others,
[2:16:53] Lord. Sister Kathy is true. Almost
[2:16:56] instantly, Lord, her knee was healed.
[2:17:00] Lord Jesus, we thank you for these
[2:17:02] things. And then, Lord, I'm pointing the
[2:17:05] people to something else, something
[2:17:06] greater even than that this morning. is
[2:17:09] that this Christ that can heal that we
[2:17:12] would be in a hiding place with you that
[2:17:15] Lord we would receive healing of our
[2:17:17] hearts, healing of our minds and
[2:17:21] protection and isolation or insulation
[2:17:24] from being so affected by the worries by
[2:17:28] the confrontation
[2:17:31] by the pressures
[2:17:33] that this life offers every day. We
[2:17:35] can't change those pressures. We can't
[2:17:37] change people. We can't change them,
[2:17:40] Lord.
[2:17:42] But Lord, we can change where we're
[2:17:43] living from. And we can live in that
[2:17:46] place with you.
[2:17:48] Lord, I'm pointing to people. I hope
[2:17:50] they see it. I'm pointing them to a a
[2:17:53] deeper life in you, Lord. Not a surface
[2:17:56] life, but I'm pointing them to something
[2:17:59] deeper. I can't ask them to go there
[2:18:01] deeper, Lord, unless I go there myself.
[2:18:03] And Lord, I'm praying that you'll guide
[2:18:06] me, that you'll lead me, and Lord, that
[2:18:08] you'll bring me to a place of a complete
[2:18:11] trust in you no matter what comes my
[2:18:15] way. Forgive us, Lord. Forgive me this,
[2:18:18] Lord. This as I see
[2:18:22] our prophet referring to being so caught
[2:18:24] up with the fusses among people and the
[2:18:27] church splits and the someone
[2:18:30] persecuting us. Lord, forgive me for
[2:18:32] spending so much time letting my spirit
[2:18:35] being affected by that. God, forgive me.
[2:18:38] Forgive me, Lord, for any arrogance or
[2:18:41] pride that's within me. Lord, today the
[2:18:44] saints have laid their hands on one
[2:18:46] another before we would go and go back
[2:18:48] to our homes. We lay our hands on our
[2:18:51] brothers and sisters, upon our children.
[2:18:53] And we pray Lord that the the Christ
[2:18:56] that has been present with us today
[2:18:59] would come into our hearts, come into
[2:19:01] our homes, come into our lives, and we
[2:19:04] would
[2:19:06] bring the curtain down, Lord, and come
[2:19:08] into that inner veil with you, Lord.
[2:19:10] Come into such a deeper fellowship with
[2:19:12] you that Lord, if the whole world falls
[2:19:15] apart, which it is, Lord, that we would
[2:19:18] find that place. Overcomers in this age
[2:19:23] are being groomed for something greater
[2:19:25] than just a feeling or emotion or even
[2:19:27] another healing revival. He that
[2:19:29] overcomes this age is heading to sit
[2:19:32] with you in your throne as you have
[2:19:35] already overcome and sit in your throne.
[2:19:39] You've got some Davids here. You've got
[2:19:41] some people, Lord, that have as a
[2:19:45] pastor, I can't believe what some of
[2:19:47] them have been through. Lord, it's been
[2:19:49] so hard. But oh, Father, build their
[2:19:52] faith today to realize there are unique
[2:19:54] pressures and trials that are only to
[2:19:57] sons and daughters of God.
[2:20:00] When we get on the other side, Lord,
[2:20:02] come to a judgment day when everyone's
[2:20:04] judged, then Lord, we'll see people
[2:20:06] says, "There wasn't anybody that could
[2:20:08] have a good marriage in Leodysia. There
[2:20:11] wasn't any teenager in Leodysia that
[2:20:14] could overcome the traps, the sexual
[2:20:17] perversion. There wasn't any musician or
[2:20:19] preacher that could overcome the the the
[2:20:22] the trap of popularity and stay humble
[2:20:26] and simple. There wasn't anybody that
[2:20:27] could do it. And Lord, there should be
[2:20:29] some that raised their hands on that day
[2:20:31] and say, "By God's grace, I was able to
[2:20:34] overcome the age of Leodysia.
[2:20:38] Let me be one of those, Lord. I pray by
[2:20:41] your grace, let these people enter into
[2:20:43] that. Father, Lord,
[2:20:47] do something greater among us. Send us
[2:20:49] personal revival in our hearts, Lord.
[2:20:52] God, change lives. Change hearts. Change
[2:20:54] people. Lord, if we think that we're
[2:20:56] settled in a certain place, take us on
[2:20:58] to know you in an even more settled and
[2:21:01] greater way. And thank you, Father. We
[2:21:04] give you the glory and the honor and
[2:21:06] praise this morning. You're the King of
[2:21:09] Kings. You're the Lord of Lords. Thank
[2:21:12] you Jesus. We ask these things as we
[2:21:15] close down Jesus name. Amen.
[2:21:21] My wife
[2:21:24] had a great point this morning is last
[2:21:26] night she was watching
[2:21:28] that King of Kings, that movie with
[2:21:31] Ellie.
[2:21:33] Wonderful little movie of the life of
[2:21:35] Christ.
[2:21:37] My wife thought it was interesting that
[2:21:40] the Pharisees and the religious
[2:21:42] legalistic people were taking Jesus to
[2:21:44] court because he forgave people's sins.
[2:21:49] That was the accusation
[2:21:51] is he was forgiving. And if they're
[2:21:53] living by the law, there's not much
[2:21:54] forgiveness in that. But that was he was
[2:21:58] he was you know what the song used to
[2:21:59] say? Jesus was guilty of love in the
[2:22:02] first degree.
[2:22:04] and they were accusing him because he
[2:22:06] forgave people's sin. Let that be my
[2:22:09] accusation
[2:22:11] that I have the love and forgiving
[2:22:12] spirit of Christ to forgive. Let it be
[2:22:16] so. I pray. God bless you. You're
[2:22:18] welcome to worship, spend time with the
[2:22:21] Lord. Welcome to come up for prayer. We
[2:22:23] just close the service for those who
[2:22:25] need to go. God bless you. Wednesday
[2:22:27] night, we have brother JZ Kameda from
[2:22:29] Nigeria here. I heard good things about
[2:22:31] his ministry and we're looking forward
[2:22:33] to hearing him. God bless you each one.
[2:22:38] Into
[2:22:40] thy chamber.
