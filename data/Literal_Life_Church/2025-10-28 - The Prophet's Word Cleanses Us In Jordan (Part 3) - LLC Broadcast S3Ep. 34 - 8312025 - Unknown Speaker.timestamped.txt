[4:37] Then when he then went he down and
[4:40] dipped himself seven times in Jordan
[4:43] according to the saying of the man of
[4:45] God. So here is non acting according to
[4:49] the word of a prophet and doing what he
[4:51] didn't want to do according to the word
[4:53] of a prophet. But look what he did when
[4:55] he followed this way and this word of
[4:58] the man of God. His flesh came again
[5:00] like unto the flesh of a little child
[5:03] and he was clean. Sometimes the word of
[5:07] a prophet lingers for a while. But if
[5:09] you obey him and follow what he said to
[5:11] do, you're always going to see a
[5:13] prophet's word fulfilled.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; And so let's go over in 2 Corinthians 15
[5:18] if you would. And let's add something
[5:21] Paul said in here that would be related
[5:22] to finishing this subject here of non.
[5:26] Now, if Christ be preached that he rose
[5:30] from the dead, how say some of you that
[5:34] there's no resurrection of the dead? In
[5:36] other words, there's some preachers who
[5:38] were saying there's going to be no
[5:40] resurrection for the saints. We believe
[5:43] there's a resurrection of Christ, but
[5:45] there's going to be no resurrection of
[5:46] the saints in Christ. Well, how can you
[5:48] preach the resurrection of Christ and
[5:51] not believe there's a resurrection for
[5:52] the saints? That's the very reason
[5:54] Christ was resurrected so his people
[5:57] would be affected by resurrection power.
[6:00] But if there be no resurrection of the
[6:02] dead, then is Christ not risen. And if
[6:04] Christ be not risen, then is our
[6:06] preaching in vain and your faith is also
[6:09] in vain. If he hasn't risen, then
[6:11] everything we're doing today is in vain,
[6:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[6:14] &gt;&gt; It has to have an end result of a
[6:16] resurrection. And that power of the
[6:18] resurrection. Verse 15. Yay. And we are
[6:21] found fault false witnesses of God
[6:23] because we have testified of God that he
[6:25] was raised up Christ whom he raised not
[6:27] up. If so be that he that the dead rise
[6:30] not. For if the dead rise not, then is
[6:32] not Christ raised? And if the Christ and
[6:35] if Christ be not raised, your faith is
[6:37] in vain, yet are and ye are yet in your
[6:40] sins. Then they also which are fallen
[6:43] asleep in Christ are perished. If in
[6:46] this life only we have hope in Christ,
[6:48] we are of all men most miserable. Your
[6:51] very best day, even as a Christian,
[6:54] without the hope of a resurrection or
[6:56] rapture in the other side, you're of all
[6:58] men most miserable cuz we're believing
[7:01] something that doesn't have a climax and
[7:02] an end result in a new body in a
[7:04] millennium. Can you say amen? What good
[7:07] is all of it if we don't need if we
[7:08] don't believe there's something coming?
[7:11] If verse 20, but now is Christ risen
[7:14] from the dead and become the first
[7:16] fruits of them that slept. For since by
[7:18] man came death, by man uh by one man
[7:21] came death, by man came also the
[7:22] resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam
[7:25] all die, even so in Christ shall all be
[7:28] made alive. But every man in his own
[7:30] order, Christ the first fruits,
[7:33] afterwards they that are Christ at his
[7:36] coming. I want you to notice now he was
[7:39] the first fruits but the truth of
[7:41] resurrection will go on until the end
[7:43] and in this hour there will be another
[7:46] resurrection of Christ saints.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; Then cometh the end when he shall have
[7:53] delivered up the kingdom of God even the
[7:55] father when he shall have put down all
[7:57] rule and all authority and power for he
[8:00] must reign till he hath put all enemies
[8:04] under his feet. I don't know if you
[8:06] noticed it, but Christ is still putting
[8:08] enemies under his feet. Say, "Well, he
[8:11] did all that." No, no, he's still doing
[8:12] it because it's the work's not done yet.
[8:15] Where is he putting the enemy under his
[8:17] feet? Under your feet.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; He's finishing the work in the bride.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; And when that's all done, there's going
[8:24] to be a great homecoming and
[8:26] resurrection.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; So, do you understand today that Paul's
[8:30] saying we still Christ still has a work
[8:32] to do in our lives? And what is it?
[8:34] We're putting all things under our feet.
[8:37] Christ is finishing that work in us.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; For he must reign till he had put all
[8:43] enemies under his feet. The last enemy
[8:45] that he shall be destroyed is death.
[8:48] Well, I can say that's true because
[8:49] there's a rapture. There's going to be a
[8:51] people that are raptured that escape
[8:53] death. I want to be a part of that
[8:55] group. I don't know if I'll be I don't
[8:56] know if I'll kick the bucket someday,
[8:58] but I'll be in the resurrection. But I'd
[9:00] like to be a part of that group that
[9:01] escapes death
[9:03] &gt;&gt; right from this body to the new body.
[9:05] For he hath put all things under his
[9:07] feet. But when he saith all things put
[9:09] under him, it is manifest that he is
[9:11] accepted which did put all things under
[9:13] him. And when all things shall be
[9:15] subdued unto him, then shall the son
[9:17] also himself be subject unto him that
[9:19] put all things under him, that God may
[9:21] be all in all. Else what shall they do
[9:24] which are baptized for the dead, if the
[9:26] dead rise not at all? always back to
[9:28] this subject is that why are we
[9:30] baptizing everybody in the symbolism of
[9:33] a death and a resurrection? I tell the
[9:36] young ones that are being baptized, I
[9:38] try to make it simple for the young ones
[9:40] to realize one of the parts of baptism
[9:42] is is a type of a death, burial, and a
[9:44] resurrection. When I put you, when
[9:46] brother Paul puts you under the water,
[9:47] it's typing your life is dying in
[9:49] Christ, but I don't leave you under the
[9:52] water. I bring you back up. There's a
[9:53] resurrection and there's a new man
[9:55] coming in your life. There's a new
[9:57] resurrection. There's a new life. So
[9:59] Paul's saying, why? I know it looks like
[10:01] I'm preaching already, but I am.
[10:04] Paul's saying, why do we baptize people
[10:06] in this symbolism if we don't believe in
[10:08] a resurrection?
[10:10] &gt;&gt; He's correcting these preachers. And why
[10:12] stand we in jeopardy every hour? And
[10:13] then he says, why are we having such
[10:15] hardships? Why are we going through such
[10:18] trouble? And then he says this profound
[10:20] statement that right in the middle of
[10:21] this resurrection thing. He brings a
[10:24] point that our we are we are dying but
[10:29] it's not a one-time event. And he says
[10:32] this that we quote a lot of us all the
[10:34] time. I protest by your rejoicing which
[10:38] I have in Jesus Christ. In other words,
[10:40] I'm going to say this publicly to all of
[10:42] you believers. I die daily.
[10:48] Wow.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; It's just in the middle of all this
[10:51] dying and resurrection and all this
[10:52] resurrection power and the only way he
[10:55] can come to a resurrection is not to be
[10:58] one night at an altar dying to himself.
[11:00] I die not every year at camp.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; Not once a year for Christmas service.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; This is a death that's not even in
[11:10] church. This is a death to yourself. And
[11:12] what is it? Daily we die.
[11:16] daily we give up of our own will and say
[11:19] Lord thy will be done. I think a
[11:21] wonderful revelation that's come out of
[11:22] this story of non is don't question the
[11:25] places God takes us to die to ourself
[11:28] and in this case it was Jordan. Non
[11:31] questioned the place that God told him
[11:33] to go to. One of the dirtiest rivers if
[11:36] not the dirtiest river. He actually
[11:38] suggested why couldn't it be some other
[11:39] cleaner rivers and more distinct than
[11:41] the ones in dis Damascus. But I think we
[11:45] learn that that we don't question the
[11:48] places God takes us to that cause us to
[11:52] die to ourselves.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; That we don't question that, that we
[11:57] grow out of questioning that Jordan
[12:00] represents death. Don't try to figure
[12:03] what God asked us to do or to give him
[12:07] better options of the way to do it.
[12:10] And so this is what we learn is that we
[12:12] we we should learn not to question what
[12:15] God has asked us to do because if it
[12:18] ends up in our healing if and and God
[12:21] has different ways that he heals. God
[12:23] has different ways he brings
[12:24] deliverance. It's the same power of God
[12:26] but he asks us to do different things
[12:28] sometimes in order to get there. We
[12:30] learn from non that he had to overcome
[12:32] his pride, overcome his questions about
[12:35] this crazy uh thing the prophet's
[12:37] servant asked him to do. He had to
[12:39] overcome all that and be trustworthy in
[12:42] the prophet's word and go do it and
[12:45] follow through with obedience if the
[12:47] prophet asked to do it. And that's when
[12:50] we find when he was completely obedient,
[12:52] then we find the prophet's word coming
[12:54] to pass in his life. So don't try to
[12:57] figure out what God asked us to do or
[12:59] don't try to bring him better options.
[13:01] Don't underestimate how God is dealing
[13:03] with the sin of this generation
[13:06] &gt;&gt; through the voice of a prophet. You can
[13:08] come kicking and screaming and start you
[13:10] know taking picking and choosing but
[13:12] listen listen let's just respect the way
[13:16] God is dealing with sin. Let's respect
[13:19] how God wants to wash our lives.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen?
[13:24] And in this case, non who wasn't even a
[13:27] believer had to respect going down and
[13:29] dipping seven times, and you can come
[13:32] kicking and screaming, which he did. But
[13:34] when he got obedient and did exactly
[13:36] what the word said to do, guess what? He
[13:39] got his healing.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; Don't underestimate how God deals with
[13:42] sin.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; And the way he chooses to do it. And you
[13:46] see, friends, God never needs to put a
[13:48] show on to anyone. In other words, God's
[13:50] ways are not our ways. We sang that. We
[13:52] preached that last Sunday. How many
[13:53] believe God's ways are not our ways? We
[13:56] got to trust his ways. And then God
[13:58] never does something to put on a show to
[14:00] anyone. He never says, "Do this because
[14:02] I kind of want to flash my power and
[14:04] just flash everything to the world." God
[14:06] does not do things to put on a show to
[14:08] anyone. So if it's odd what he asks us
[14:11] to do, it must be then for whose
[14:14] benefit? He doesn't like to show off to
[14:16] the world. So if he asks us to do
[14:18] something strange, it must be for our
[14:21] benefit. Yes,
[14:23] &gt;&gt; cuz he don't need to show off.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; But if he wants to bring healing to you
[14:27] and he asks you to dip seven times in
[14:29] the muddy Jordan, it must be he's
[14:31] something he's trying to teach you. So
[14:34] God's way, he's not trying to show off.
[14:37] It's for our benefit. So it must be a
[14:39] test sometimes. He must it must be for
[14:41] our growth and increase trust and faith
[14:43] in him. Even Jesus did some strange
[14:45] things. And I don't want to spend a lot
[14:46] of time on this, but even Jesus asked
[14:48] for strange things. Did strange things.
[14:50] He's he grabbed some mud out of the
[14:52] ground. He spit on the mud for the blind
[14:55] man. That's an interesting mixture of
[14:57] his spit and the mud bringing the
[15:00] healing of a blind man. It's pretty
[15:02] gross, actually.
[15:04] I wonder what the people thought when he
[15:06] was doing that. I wonder what the blind
[15:08] man thought as he hears a spit.
[15:13] If he's like you, he's in his mind. He's
[15:16] blind, but he's hearing spit. He's
[15:18] hearing mud being crushed together with
[15:19] the spit. And I can't help but the blind
[15:22] man's saying, "What in the world's going
[15:23] on? What's Jesus doing?" He has the
[15:27] power just to speak the word.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; Why isn't he just saying it to me?
[15:33] Because don't underestimate what God is
[15:36] doing. There's a reason he's doing it.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; And we'll never figure that spit.
[15:40] Another place he he spit uh there's
[15:42] another place that he actually he
[15:44] doesn't spit in the mud but he he
[15:46] actually he spit on the tongue of a
[15:48] blind man.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; He touched the ear of the deaf person.
[15:52] He touched the mouth of the dumb. He
[15:55] healed on the s Sabbath day which was
[15:57] wrong to all the Pharisees. He healed on
[15:59] the wrong day. He he he worked outside
[16:02] of the box. He didn't deal with every
[16:04] sickness the same way. Can you say amen?
[16:06] And God's always been that way. Moses
[16:09] held up a brass serpent and said, "If
[16:11] all the people will look towards it," I
[16:13] don't know why God did it that way, but
[16:15] guess what? If they look towards it,
[16:17] they were healed and kept from the
[16:18] serpent's bite.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; They walked in Peter's shadow and got
[16:27] healed.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[16:33] &gt;&gt; It wasn't laying on the hands that time.
[16:35] It wasn't speaking the word that time.
[16:37] They just got in Peter's shadow and they
[16:39] were healed.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; That wasn't Jesus. That was Peter with
[16:43] Jesus in him. There's different ways,
[16:46] the same power, but it's out of the box
[16:48] sometimes. And that's only for us to see
[16:51] if we're willing to take the step into
[16:54] Jordan of what it is. Are we willing to
[16:57] trust the Lord what he's asking us to
[17:00] do?
[17:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God just needs humility
[17:04] to his word. And the way he said to do
[17:06] this, this is odd. You say, "Lord, this
[17:09] is odd." But his word said to do it, and
[17:12] I'm going to trust the Lord, but it's
[17:14] death to ourselves. Jordan means death.
[17:17] It's death to oursel. That's the work
[17:19] he's doing. It's a complete death to
[17:21] ourselves. So now in our text, Paul is
[17:25] correcting this men's teaching that's
[17:26] saying there's no resurrection for us. I
[17:28] already preached on a little bit. I
[17:29] don't have to say much about it, but
[17:31] Christ proved that he uh when he died,
[17:33] he rose again. Christ proved that there
[17:35] would be a resurrection. He did it
[17:37] himself. And here's the principle Paul's
[17:39] bringing. There's always a resurrection
[17:41] after death in Christ. There's always a
[17:44] resurrection after death. That's what
[17:46] he's preaching to these men. There's
[17:47] always a resurrection after death in
[17:50] Christ. And there's always a death
[17:53] before resurrection in Christ.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; You holding on to that? Yes,
[17:58] &gt;&gt; sir.
[17:59] There's in in the Lord there is always a
[18:03] resurrection after death.
[18:07] But also in the Lord, there's always a
[18:10] death before resurrection.
[18:13] That's the principle of Christianity.
[18:15] And guess why we can believe it for
[18:16] ourselves? Because Christ proved it.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; He died and he rose again.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; That kind of death in in the Lord, that
[18:24] kind of death according to the word
[18:26] always brings a resurrection.
[18:28] And there's no resurrection without that
[18:31] kind of death first. And what I mean is
[18:33] not by a physical death. We don't have
[18:34] to go to Calvary. Thank God he paid for
[18:37] our sins. But then Jesus says every day
[18:41] a person ought to take up their cross
[18:43] and follow Jesus, showing there is a
[18:46] cross for each of us to bear. And we
[18:48] ought to take up that cross. Just like
[18:50] Jesus took up his cross for us, we ought
[18:53] to take up our cross. Oh no. Maybe a
[18:55] Baptist said, "No, he's taking the cross
[18:57] for us. It's not a life of the cross.
[18:59] It's an easy life now. No. Jesus said,
[19:02] "You have a cross to bear. You have a
[19:04] burden to bear."
[19:05] &gt;&gt; And a lot of people aren't willing to
[19:07] pick up that cross.
[19:09] &gt;&gt; But there's a cross for each of us. And
[19:11] he says to pick that up. Why? Because
[19:12] the principle is there's a there's in
[19:15] Christ, there's always a resurrection
[19:17] after death if there's a true death in
[19:19] Christ. But there's always a death. You
[19:22] can't come to resurrection power without
[19:25] a dying out to yourself
[19:28] &gt;&gt; and dying daily. You can't come to more
[19:31] of the Lord unless you're willing to die
[19:33] to something. I'd say this, if you want
[19:35] to come to more of the riches of God,
[19:37] there's something you have to die to.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; And when you die to that thing, you open
[19:42] the door to come to more of his
[19:44] resurrection power, more of his grace,
[19:46] more of his riches. You say, "Well, it's
[19:47] a free gift." Yeah, it's given to you.
[19:49] But there's something that we have to
[19:50] lay down and give up in in an unselfish
[19:54] Lord, I'll follow you. Whatever you tell
[19:56] me to do, whatever it is, I'm willing to
[19:58] do it.
[20:00] &gt;&gt; Christ was a death
[20:04] at all levels. We often think of the
[20:07] cross, the final death, and it was the
[20:10] worst death a man could die. And it was
[20:12] we we we celebrate it. We had at
[20:14] communion, the Lord's supper, we he said
[20:16] to remember my death. But before he had
[20:19] a physical death, his death was on many
[20:22] levels, not just physical. If that's
[20:26] true with the Lord, it's true with us.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[20:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus died to his own will. Jesus died
[20:36] turning down temptation of Satan in the
[20:38] wilderness when he was tempted by three
[20:40] different things. He had to die to being
[20:42] tempted. He was tempted in all things
[20:44] like we are. So he had to die to what he
[20:47] was tempted by. I won't fall to that
[20:49] temptation. He had to die to himself and
[20:52] trust God. We have to do the same thing.
[20:56] He died turning down temptation. And the
[20:58] temptation is using his power as a or
[21:00] his gift for just a show or popularity.
[21:03] Satan tempted him and says do this, do
[21:05] this. And and he was tempting Jesus to
[21:08] use his power for a show or for
[21:11] popularity. Jesus had to die to
[21:14] influences that would make him more
[21:17] popular.
[21:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus had to die to the temptation to
[21:25] use his gift for show or popularity. I I
[21:29] pray that all the gifted people will
[21:32] listen to me because Jesus had the
[21:34] greatest gift that any man has ever had.
[21:37] But he had to die to the temptation to
[21:40] use that gift for a show or for
[21:42] popularity.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus had to die to the temptation to
[21:47] use his gift to work up the crowd.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; He didn't do that.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Men can use their gift to work up the
[21:56] crowd into a frenzy. Men can use their
[21:59] gift and fall into popularity. Men can
[22:02] use their gift, but Jesus had to die to
[22:03] that. He was off to the kingdoms of this
[22:06] world and all of its money. He was off
[22:09] to the kingdoms of this world by Satan
[22:11] and all of its money. He turned it down.
[22:13] He had to die to that. He died in
[22:15] poverty. He had no money. He died to
[22:17] defending himself. He became poor. Oh,
[22:20] praise the Lord. I'm remembering
[22:21] scriptures now. He became poor. He
[22:24] became poor so we could become rich.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[22:31] &gt;&gt; He had to die to the temptation to
[22:33] become richer. And I'm I'm not saying if
[22:35] God don't bless you, but I'm saying you
[22:37] can't buy into the riches of this world,
[22:40] if it's in your heart and you're tied to
[22:42] that too much, you got to die out to
[22:44] that desire for the the the the root of
[22:46] it. Can you say amen?
[22:49] &gt;&gt; It's not money, it's the love of money.
[22:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus had to die to that. It's not just
[22:55] Calvary he died at. He died to himself
[22:58] in all these things.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He was offered money.
[23:03] He died. He What's Can I go on? He died
[23:07] to defending himself when he had the
[23:10] right to defend himself.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Oh boy. I won't listen. I ain't going to
[23:19] ask for a show of hands.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; But he had to die to every desire to
[23:25] defend himself even when he was
[23:27] completely right. That's right.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; The closer he got to Calvary, he opened
[23:34] not his mouth. And if any man in history
[23:37] had a right to defend himself and was
[23:39] falsely charged, it was Jesus Christ.
[23:42] And he gave up the right to speak and
[23:45] say anything about it. He said,
[23:47] "Whatever you say, thou sayest." He He
[23:51] died. He died in Pilate's hall already.
[23:54] What did he die to? The right to defend
[23:56] himself.
[23:59] Jesus died these levels of death. He
[24:02] died to himself before he came to the
[24:05] death of the cross. He died to defending
[24:07] himself. He died to committing to too
[24:09] much men. The Bible says he did not
[24:11] commit himself to them because he knew
[24:14] what was in the heart of man. He had to
[24:16] die to committing because in our
[24:18] emotions, we commit ourselves to men. We
[24:20] don't need to commit just to men. We
[24:21] need to commit to God first. And Jesus
[24:24] was completely committed to God first.
[24:26] And he actually, the Bible says, he did
[24:28] not commit himself to some men because
[24:31] he knew what was in the heart of men. If
[24:34] he'd have put all of his commitment, all
[24:36] his eggs in one basket, even with his
[24:38] disciples who left him at the end,
[24:44] if he just give all his commitment to
[24:46] them, he would have been disappointed.
[24:48] Can you say amen? He had to die. He had
[24:52] to die to committing to men too much.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; He did not lean on his disciples for him
[25:00] to carry on to Calvary. They all left.
[25:04] They all betrayed him.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; He had to die to depending on a group.
[25:12] Oh, friends, I I know you're quiet. I
[25:15] know this is this is I don't like to
[25:18] move quickly on these things because I
[25:20] realize that my Lord Jesus didn't just
[25:23] go to the cross and physically die. He
[25:25] had a death at different levels going
[25:27] on. And we are called to the same thing.
[25:30] He died to living on man's approval. How
[25:33] many believe Jesus died to living off of
[25:35] man's approval? He told the the the
[25:37] Pharisees, "You live for the praises of
[25:40] men. You live to be complimented by
[25:42] men." He says, "You don't live on the
[25:44] praises of men. You live on the praises
[25:46] of God. Am I acceptable to God?" But
[25:48] some people live on social media how
[25:51] many likes they get. And you can live on
[25:53] the praises and how many likes you get.
[25:55] Jesus had to die to wanting the praise
[25:58] of men. Some of you didn't get any
[26:00] praise from your father. You didn't give
[26:02] any act acknowledging of your gifts. And
[26:05] so you've got a big void in your life
[26:07] and you keep trying to fulfill it. But
[26:09] you see now you need to look to the
[26:11] heavenly father for your complete
[26:13] approval because men will disappoint
[26:16] you. Fathers will disappoint you.
[26:19] Families will disappoint you. But I can
[26:21] tell you you can find your approval in
[26:23] Jesus Christ. He died the ultimate
[26:26] death. And guess what? That wasn't
[26:27] Calvary. When I say the ultimate death,
[26:29] the prophet said the spirit left him in
[26:31] the garden. He's it was a death to his
[26:32] own will in the garden. Before he died
[26:34] on the cross physically, he died in the
[26:36] garden of Gethsemane. And we fell from a
[26:39] garden. How many knows we fell from the
[26:41] garden of Eden?
[26:43] &gt;&gt; So it was a garden and we were in that.
[26:46] We were enjoying the presence of God and
[26:48] everything was perfect. We fell from the
[26:51] Garden of Eden. But Eden, but guess
[26:52] what? How did we get back into a promise
[26:54] to get back to Eden? How many believe
[26:56] we're going to get back to Eden again?
[26:57] How many believe we're going to be
[26:58] restored back to what Adam and Eve lost?
[27:00] We're in the process right now. But how
[27:04] did Jesus pave the way to get from
[27:07] falling from the garden even to get to
[27:09] the garden even? I can tell you it was
[27:11] the garden of Gethsemane.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; You know why a lot of Christians don't
[27:15] come to the glory of the Lord in their
[27:16] life? Because they're not willing to go
[27:18] to the garden of Gethsemane. And what
[27:21] happened in Gethsemane is said, "Father,
[27:24] if it be possible, let this cup pass
[27:27] from me."
[27:28] &gt;&gt; That's the human side.
[27:31] But the God side comes out and says,
[27:34] "Nevertheless,
[27:36] say it with me, not my will, but thine
[27:40] be done." That's Gethsemane. And you
[27:42] can't get back to Eden without this full
[27:45] death to self. The only way to a
[27:47] resurrection is death. When someone is
[27:49] dying in the Lord, just really dying out
[27:52] to them. Say, "I give up. I let Jesus
[27:55] take over. I'm giving this up. I'm today
[27:57] I'm leaving and I'm leaving this at the
[27:59] altar. You know what it is to God? It's
[28:02] beautiful.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Only in Christ's kingdom is death a
[28:08] beautiful thing.
