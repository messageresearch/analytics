Lyrics:
Everywhere I go
Every time I call
When I need You most
You hear and answer all
And I am well aware
That You are always there
Everywhere
Every hurt I feel
Every tear I cry
When my faith is low
You're still by my side
Even through despair
You hear my desperate prayer
Everywhere
Everywhere this life may lead
Everywhere this road takes meLord,
I know that You'll be there
And from this day until forever
We'll see it through together Hand in hand
Every little smile
Every happiness
When I feel You close
And know that I am blessed
I love that You are thereTo hear my joyful prayer
Everywhere

Written by Jerry Kelso and Sheri LaFontaine
