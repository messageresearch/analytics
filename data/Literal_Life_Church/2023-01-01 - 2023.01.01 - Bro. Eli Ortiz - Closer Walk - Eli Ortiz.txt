TRANSCRIPT
========================================
or maybe not but I want to witness this morning of the word of God and what he has done for us amen so New Year we have a subject this morning and I for this New Year I believe that for me my desire is a closer walk to God I don't know what is yours but this morning I want to be more closer to Jesus this year that I've ever been before I want this journey you know to Draw Me Closer the guy will close with drawer closer me to him this year because that is my desire you know we can worship Him from afar but that will just take you so far I want to get as close as as he wants me to get actually because he wants you to walk with him talk to him you know fellowship with him more than you deserve that you know that he wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than what do this how the Holy Ghost this morning his desires greater so I want to fulfill his desire this morning amen so let us read from from Brother Bradham shalom 64. year 64. I don't know what is okay you got my notes okay here we go brother says oh wow okay can we start with 137 did I give you the wrong notes maybe that's not the beginning yet okay it's something what's going to go wrong it's going to go wrong don't worry about it we're going to make mistakes we're going to make errors so just apologize that I know I'm going to make mistakes okay beforehand and I apologizing that beforehand okay New Year's New Year what about it bring what new hopes he says we are one year closer we are one day closer than we were yesterday he says we are one hour closer than we were when I started he says 15 years ago 15 minutes to 11. it's 15 till 12 now we are one hour closer we don't and we don't look back we look forward see last time I checked uh what would I he said 15 years when I started in the message so when God called me to the message it was uh uh in those days I'm talking about maybe 60 years well this is this has been written about 60 years but brother Brown says 15 minutes when I started in the semester 30 years ago we were three minutes to you know you know the atomic Cloud that they keep track of you know the apocalyptic things we work three minutes to midnight that's what brought about 15. so that was 20 years ago you know where we are today seconds you know they updated the clock to 30 to 90 seconds so I think it is even who knows even less than that how close we are I mean the scientists said that's how close we are and you and me know and I know that that's how close we are because when all these things start happening look up because your Redemption is near amen so let us pray right quick and then we get into our message Father we thank you once again for this opportunity that we have to to father to stand here father I'm here present father to in my postal Duty father we want you to to come father we want to and we love your presence this morning Father that's what we come father we we love to be around you and your presence and your people father and now I ask you father that I will get out of the way father what I want you to come and you take control father and you speak to your children through this verse of Father by we ask you these things and granted father be be with those that are traveling back from the meeting father uh keep and protect and cover them uh that the Angels who will will bring them and remove any obstacle that Satan wants to put in a way foreign father we love you we thank you and we appreciate you for in the name of Jesus Christ we ask you all these things amen and amen so in order to talk about closer you can sit down I'm sorry I already apologize for all my mistakes so I don't have to you know you guys think this is easy I might make it look easy but it's not easy I can never get adjusted you know every time I come to preach I get nervous I'm glad because if I would get adjusted then I get worried if it gets comfortable and normal then you know you'll be habitual you know I could worry about it but I'm glad I get nervous because then I have to depend on the law to give me peace and strength and gave me wisdom to do what I need to do because it's his work anyway so closer closer walk with God closer walk in 2023 is what I want this is the first day and we're starting you know the right way in church bye what what a better way to start a year but in church communion with God giving God the first fruit the first of the year he can have it in fact you know we are close and closer and we are even closer than you think we are to the coming of the Lord actually you know we've seen all the things going in the world you know the chaos and and all these things happening in wars and rumors of war and pestilences I mean I never knew I mean I'm 73 right now and I have gone through some hurricanes in Portugal and I have got some epidemics too you know what's the field that killed people but I never thought that after I grew up when I was 73 I was going to see a pandemic I never seen one not this close but I mean there were some other places that happened in my times but I mean this is close finally I can say that I lived and made it through a pandemic and I thank the Lord because he saw the Lord that keep us he's our healer you know he's the one that lead us on garos in all things but these are getting I mean listen it's not going to get better from here on don't sit there and think you know we are going to go back to normal normal is not longer here any longer what you and I knew with Norma is not here we might get to some normalities but it's not going to be what you and I used to know that's normal so now we don't know what to expect and I know one thing I'm only expecting the coming of the Lord because for now on things are not going any better so we need to prepare ourselves and get closer and move closer closer to him until we can disappear you know like Enoch he had such a close walk that he walked and he walked until what it was not because God took him that's what we need to do Focus ourselves to start walking closer and closer until one of these days he says okay come home that's what I'm looking forward everything else behind those are distractions what is going to happen is going to happen amen so how do we get closer to Jesus so I want to go to the letter of Paul that he wrote to the Philippians in chapter 3 but before we get there what I want you to know that the closer we get to God see through Jesus Christ then we get stronger I mean this might get weak but in my weakness that is where my strength is at because I'm not depending on my flesh see I'm depending on his strength so the joy of the Lord is my strength so The Closer I Get With God through Jesus the stronger the happier we become what we are facing life struggles when we face you know all the old deals that we that we Face we counted all Joy James says see the closer you get to God you know you are contempt like like Paul says it doesn't matter what I find myself raise your poor hungry with a lot or less or or this you know whatever situation he found himself he says I am contempt ugly terrible I am content because I know that wherever Satan throw at me all that evil that he wants to do to us God turned us to good because he said that he says you know all things were for good so let's say that whatever he wants to he cannot create any weapon that can destroy you you know that I don't care if it's cancer I don't care if it's coffee I don't care let it throw you anything in fact this year I thought Satan this morning you know ah I woke up this morning but he's faithful Satan is faithful than me it was all before me you know why he was waiting for me first of the year sometimes I think Satan is more faithful than a lot of Christians you know he was waiting for me already the beginning the first day the first hour of the year I mean this morning I was stressed out opposite stressed out you know because first I have a burden right now that I had to die on love you know plus you know we had the the children's with us you know Tina is and Kenny went to do their team that they need to do I told my wife this morning oh I had a bad memory this morning bad dreams I forgot what it is to take out three children I mean I forgot that I I mean we don't have children no more you know Hallelujah this morning I was stressed and now the kids getting ready they need to eat we need to go oh my goodness throw the trash Christy I'm just basically my wife is trying to cook and do something so we can eat after service oh my God and then I was I mean Satan was really you know trying to you know he don't he don't you know waste any time it's a good enemy you know so he was there so I had to stop oh my God I said you know Satan you know I know you got up early enough you know to wait for me but I'll tell you something you know Satan enough is enough this year you know I am just going to move forward and this year I'm only behind all that mistakes and all the errors that I made last year you know leaving all that behind and let's move forward now yesterday is gone we turn in a new chapter in New Year where the chapter is closed you know come back and read it again do you every time you open your book you don't say well let me go wait a minute I forgot I go back to chapter then you never get to you never get to move forward Because by the time you get to the before it's time to close and you know go so we closed the chapter last year whatever mistake we made wherever errors you committed whatever choices you did bad choices or whatever happened it's bad everybody said move forward because you cannot move forward until you close a chapter you cannot read another chapter until you close that chapter and if we're done with that chapter let's move to 2013 now I mean 23. we are moving forward not backwards you know we don't want to carry any weight it is hard as it is can you imagine carrying last year and then waiting for this year and the idea to come sorry that's gone whatever I did is Forgiven God don't remember and I don't want to remember amen so color all joy sometimes it's like you may you may not have certain you know this thing here we go I'm trying these new things I'm sorry uh certain sometimes sometimes when we are with ourselves at home or maybe we are in the car going somewhere we go camping you know sometimes you don't have uh someone to encourage you when you are down or depressed you know maybe the day girls are not around the pastor is not around you know no one is around to encourage you and help you but you see that is the time that you need to depend in God because God will never leave you God will never forsake you see and that is the time we need to walk closer to God and experience God in such a way that when we need help he's a hub you know in trouble times because sometimes you cannot get hold of your pastor to pray for you sometimes you can get hold to the Deacons you know but that is the time that you know that you know that you know God because you can speak to God you know you can enter in and tell him your troubles he already knows but you need to voice it he wants to hear you telling him he wants to do it but he wants you to talk to him to commune with him to fellowship with him this morning so that's why we need to get closer and closer until we become you know like a husband and a wife there's some intimacy you know that's close we have to get to him you know he wants that God wants your fellowship in fact God desires your fellowship that's why he make you and me from the very beginning he created us so he could have a family and he could have Fellowship God wants to walk with you God was a walk in you this morning because when there's no one else around that's when you know that you know that you know that you know him see that is the time and we had to walk that close and experience him in such a way that when we have a need we know that he's going to provide all our needs amen amen and we trust God that he's going to do that so when we go to through things in life we need to know that we have a good relationship just like a wife and a husband you know he's there to protect her he's there to keep her safe he's there to provide he's here to take care he's there to do that that the Bible said husband what love your wife see ask Christ love who the church that's a true call guys see and the wife said why why to your husband now I'm going to make a statement that might shake you a little bit husband your wife's gonna have to submit to you at all you should have went to you know why because it's not by force you cannot pressure you cannot demand for her because the Bible said uh you know don't the the way this work is you love her into submission like Jesus Christ loved you into submission you need to love your wife and your wife know if you love him you know that way you know I call a couple one day he says you know she says uh I she was kind of having some troubles here and there with the husband to do certain things I said this is easy ask your husband ask him this question do you love me as you love Jesus and sure he's going to say yes okay then can you take care of this for me now he cannot say no because he says I love you Jesus loved you all you have to remind your husband is that Jesus love you and he needs to love you just as Jesus loved the church and they come back off from that so listen we love God love us that way and we should love our wife the way that God Jesus loved the church amen why Sumit you know we love God not because he forced us to love God when did God force you to no he loved me first and that makes me to love him more because see take care of me he do all things for me he protected me he keeps me he coerced me he blessed me he provide for me that's what the husbands do why because he loved me so I in return what you think I want to do I want to love God the same way see not because I have to not because she have to it's because love constrains me to love her and she to submit to me so it's all a love walk okay it's all a love affair okay this walk is all A Love Affair and the closer the closer we get with God we want to enter in that Intimacy in that love affair you know that we want to do all we can because we want we love God this walk is a love affair and sometimes you know we we go through things that we don't understand sometimes we in this Walk of Life in this journey things happen and we don't have a reason why but it doesn't matter because we know that God knows we don't but he knows why he allowed certain things to come to our life he knows what he lets say that those brings certain things to our life so the only thing I know is that God is going to make things well for me in fact you know sometimes uh we see that after we go through any situation circumstances and we trust God to take us through that God sometimes don't tell your children's everything God don't tell the prophets everything sometimes we are wondering why why why but the Lord just says you know move on move on and trust me see this this work is also trust oh by faith walking with him so when we get to those places we trust God in everything that is happening to us even though he wouldn't understand why because God has something better for you at the end of that God is doing this for your own benefit and my benefit actually he's using Satan as a tool to shape you and to form you but we have to go through certain things in this world but after all is said and done you know one of the things I see that everything feeds and fall into place right away see all I had to do just be still away on the Lord let him do the barrel for me you know you don't have to be a stressed when you get through situation you walk in with God you don't stress out he's your husband and you know what happened don't get stressed just tell the devil I am blessed so you tell the devil you know uh I am the challenge you know I am the answer to your challenge when he comes this morning that's what I told him okay come on you know you know let's go because I am the answer to your challenge when he comes like a flood you know God raises a challenge a standard that's you and me so we know all that God is going to make everything good for us at least for our own benefit maybe you will not like what God had to put you through nevertheless he for your own good that God do what you do in this world so Philippians let's get to Philippe and then so how how we are going to get closer to Jesus than this year because that is my desire I want to get closer I want to get out of here I want I want I want to want to walk and walk with God I'm telling why until I'm no more no longer you don't see me anymore you know but if you don't see me you won't you know don't worry because we will see each other someplace else right not here don't get worried if you don't see me no you worry you just you don't see me next year what happened to me like I don't know that brother left nah we all living together okay now bro Paul says but what things were gained that Philippians 3 7 what it will gain to me those accounting laws for Christ first thing then we start working process you know whatever he gained his former life you know he's from her life he was he was going to be a rabbi he studied I mean to be a a a teacher that's what a rabbi is I mean he was going to have have phds and ddls but what what happened to all that education what happened to those that intellectualism well one man dies he produces a dead man you don't produce life intellectual education you cannot say God that produce death the only thing that can produce God of life is the word of God and that's it Stephen was you know stoned to death Paul was there he incarcerated the Christians that's all you know intellectually she can produce look at Moses what did he Moses produce with all his intellect and all his intelligence and the second one in command in Egypt from the Pharaoh what he produced one then man see that's the first thing I don't want my thoughts I don't want my ideas in the matter I don't want your thought and I don't want your idea all I want is his thought and his ideas in anything in my life Paul says that is the first thing when you start walking with God you know might as well forget it but you think you know because we don't know he knows all things he knows what's best for me he gave me the holy spirit so he can lead me and guide me not for me to decide what I'm going to do and what I'm going to do I want to be led just like a lamb I want to be guided that's what I my husband do he take me and he lead me he's not going to leave me in trouble you know like he says a blind following a blind and then they both falling in a hole we're not following nothing blindly we know what we follow we know this is the truth we know this is what God intended this is the light of the hour this message I'm not going crazy and if I'm going crazy leave me alone I'm happy you know this walk supposed to be happy work this works supposed to be a walk that that fulfilled unsatisfied you know just like Paul my former life did not satisfy me at all I thought it was temporary you know another one about because I Try by myself didn't work out I made too many mistakes you know I don't want the life we cannot serve Mammon and God we have to choose this year who are we going to move forward with if you find yourself walking and doing things if you find yourself coming to church and you finding yourself coming in Wednesday Sundays you're finding yourself doing the same thing every day in the same way the same uh you know doing it the same way and then nothing is and you're not moving forward then we need a change because when we come to church well we pray when we read the Bible when when we do all these things something has to change because he promised me he said he will be Transform Me and that's what I want I want to change I'm tired of Eli I am really tired of this guy no but he says he promised me that he would change me you know from glory to glory to glory that means that it's not a one-time deal or obviously the Holy Ghost 40 years ago praise the Lord but what is God doing for you today if that's all it is and you're coming to church and that's all you are then you will never move forward from there you know when we come to church and we read about us every day from this first day every day we need to be moving forward and if you find yourself doing the same thing the same way all the time and nothing happening you need a change and God has to answer for that change that's why we come to church so guys can shape us they work on models the word can take away all the things that is not God and it starts showing me what God is you know the world got come forward and you can see a glimpse of God and when you see God you can see yourself in him that's why the whole thing about this war the more you know him the more you know him the more you love him the more you know yourself when I was in the world I didn't know what I was I didn't know who I was but when I came to Jesus finally I know who I am I know what I am and I know where I'm going before I didn't know I was just lost in the world and everything decision I made every choice you know and he had no guarantee some came out good in fact at least one of it came out good I married my wife and I think that God has something to do with that even though I wasn't walking in his will but that's the choice that will that I would like to do again if I had to repeat it I would marry my wife again I got no complaints you know after being 40 some years married 46 whatever we're going to you know and that is the walk with the Lord every day you know we sing that little song you know the love of Jesus you know tomorrow is better than today you know I cannot wait for tomorrow because tomorrow's going to get better sister see that is what we need to look forward you know if we are stressed and depressed let's let's we need a change we need to now look we need to fix our eyes and that goal in Christ Jesus let's move forward this year because I know he wants to bless you but God is waiting for who you know sometimes we think we're waiting for God to see no God is waiting on you and me but if I said the Rapture is overdue because it's waiting for us to get ready I think this is a year that we need to start moving and getting ready for that Rapture you know God has a lot of things for us this year God wants to bless you God wants to bless this church God has things that the eyes and ears are never heard and I can never see not even can you imagine what God has prepared for the children's but you need to go and get it God already gave it to you it's yours you know Joy like Joshua and Caleb let's get it it is our he promised to us it's already yours healing is yours this morning just for the asking and believing whatever you have need this morning you can have if two can agree concerning anything you know and believe you can have it this morning and we don't have more than two people here okay he said that whatever two or three together he will be here his presence is here and I want to get close to that presence I want to get close enough I'm going to be refreshed this morning y'all don't want to come to church to live the same way I came in I want to be refreshed I want to be alive I'm going to be happy you know some people come to church and they think it's boring well you don't know the Jesus that I know that's not a boring moment see I want to come to church and I want to live different every time I come to church every day on this walk this year every time I come I don't want to be the same person that comes into this church maybe you don't notice the CH the change because it's gradually you know Progressive and you see everybody just about every week so you know just like your children when they start growing up you know they come to you man I think I I think I got taller come on then you go to the wall and make a mark next next five minutes I think back to you know why well you can see it because you are there within 24 7 and you can see their progress but I see you maybe once a year so I noticed a change but you don't because you see each other just about every week and whatever you're seeing is so gradually that you think nothing is happening but I'm telling you today something is happening in this church in you maybe you cannot perceive it but it's happening it is happening God will bless you just continue so we want to walk closer and we want to walk deeper not just closer deeper we want to get deeper that's what you know did he went all the way in until he was no longer seen one of these days I want to walk So Close That You Don't See Eli any longer I want people to see Christ in me it's what I want to impossible no it's not impossible for God is not that impossible and for you if you can't believe anything nothing is impossible for you neither things are possible you can believe this morning listen my friend they confused brother Branham with Christ yes or no how many people have confused you with Christ but I'll be honest not yet do I want to be there sure I want to have the same work that brother brother had to the point that people confused them with Christ and they started baptizing in his in his name why that's how close he was walking with God that he no longer you cannot even long and see brother Branham but you surprised the manifestation of Christ in him that's how close I want to walk what about you do you want to set it for Less after he has given us just about everything he gave himself he became flesh he died for us what else do you want him to do he gave his life for me I want to give mine for him does that mean I have to die out and let him manifest himself through me you need to give God that Liberty God wants you to give you the freedom to do that God would not impose if you don't want to if God is not going to make you this has to be a free choice you got to make the choice God have your way this year from now on have you're in everything that I do lead me and guide me because I want the word brother Brown said the only place that this world is going to see Jesus is well in between you guys because this is it this is what he is right now in New in you and you in me see his name whatever I put my name what is his name at in you in you in Jesus Christ he knew the Holy Ghost it's not a day any longer and the only place they're going to see it is what he knew when you go to work when you go to school what are they seeing walk closer this year closer until you and him can become one and that's what the Bible says about wife and husbands it's a mystery Paul says they become what I want to become one with him until I can completely disappear in him my wife used to tell me you know when we marry and you know honeymoons and all this stuff die out it might slow down but it hasn't died out I mean you know you get older anyway but the point that I'm making is she used to tell me I like to you know completely just get inside you you know when we used to embrace it um just so you can take me everywhere you go I can be with you all the time I just like to squeeze myself in you and that's how I'm feeling about Christ I want to walk so close that I want to squeeze myself that's what he wants anyways that is what he won but he's waiting on you and me to make a decision to forsake everything like Paul everything so he can have preeminence in our bodies in our minds in our spirit in our life in our families he wants to have first place in everything so then people can see him and no longer you see because you are manifesting that Spirit of Christ amen so intimacy let me let me just can be using this word around intimacy and a simple way that I can explain it in a simple way and it's a simple word anyway closeness see closeness is is intimacy you know it's kinship you know is is when somebody is a relationship that is hard to Heart they call him you know like David this is a good example God testified that was God testimony not man testifier of David and what he says he said man after what my own heart you know I like to have that testimony this morning I like to hear those who are from God Eli he said man after my own heart I mean I'm gonna do all his will and everything that he requires I want to fulfill all his desires because that's what Debbie did that's what he thought of him that this man will do and carry out everything that God will tell you and he did but I want to be that I want I want to hear if I don't hear that I want to hear that day you know it says oh good I'm faithful you know servant come at least those words that I was faithful I was faithful to his word I was faithful in everything that I did I was faithful to church I was faithful to everybody I was faithful to him you know God is faithful God will never fail you whatever he promised he will do it you and I can fall and can fail but he cannot fail and whatever he says he will fulfill in you if you're his children's and he called you and he failed you he started the word and he will finish it he cannot lie to me but I gotta put myself in there and that question you cannot sit down and just wait until one day with a little magic what you done you done that's not how it works it's a progressive walk then you have to make decisions Jesus had to make a decision he had a choice can this call pass that is another way we can you know when I have to go to the cross and what was the answer well the answer must have been no because he says that will be done then and that's what we want sometimes you know you know sometimes we want to make choices before you make any choices even though you wanted to do that you want to do you need that talk to God because he has a perfect I don't my choice I will fail but he has a perfect word he's perfect and he will never fail you so ask him Lord if this is okay or can I do this just like Jesus says can I no this is mine and he chose what to do God's will than doing his will another thing we need to do you know sometimes we want a lot of things we don't need them we want to do a lot of things we don't need them but one thing we can do whatever he bet us to do whatever his will is this year from day one that's what I want to do because that is how you walk closer to him that is how you please God you know that is how God you know uh you get closer to him and you can please him as well and you can do his desire no but we knew that because Jesus had a choice sometimes he didn't have no choice he did have a choice he could marry if he wanted to you know that romance said he couldn't marry her children the family boy he Sanctified himself for what for you and me and you and I we need to do the same thing we need to sacrifice certain things sometimes you know sometimes we make excuses anyway well I don't want to I don't I don't well let me get in the subject anyway I don't want to go to church I'm tired I'm this and that and the devil can come and he can just you know push buttons I know you tired last night we went to sleep late another Asana you know uh we said all kind of commotional fireworks and Banks everywhere and I went to sleep late we all went to sleep late I have excuse I'm gonna stay home but you know I want to be here because that is his will this morning that whatever he had I will be here with him with you guys with the body you know this is a body movement this is not just a one-man show foreign closeness so that is the simple meaning of the word intimacy close Heart to Heart Walk so this morning continue looking at that let's go to the next uh verse a it say you doubles and I count all things by laws for the Excellency see all things are lost you know he left his throne he left everything behind you know his Royal robes his crown he left at all and gave it all for you and me and he took my filthy robes and he gave me his truck his white robes I mean it's a Priceless you know privilege to serve the Lord amen we need to know that Excellency process count all things but laws for the Excellency see you know we sometimes we find we find people you know that are very excellent you know Royal queens and kings you know and people like to be there and they're present look at after this last the queen dying now we have a different I mean she's just more famous than that our president I think in fact I think she's more famous than cry for them you know they hold her like you know like cheese some kind of a goddess let me say it that way you know but Christ for you and me that is what we want to hold Christ in our life the Excellency of Christ the privilege that we have to to to worship him you know that's priceless I don't know why people I want you to understand this I want people to understand those that are listening you know it is it is a privilege to worship God it's a privilege to come to church it's a privilege that we come together as a body you know it's a privilege you see I said I can't all think love for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus see the more we know him the more you know him the more you love him see that's what the work is all about the more we know him the more you love him see for the knowledge not mental knowledge not education not intellectual the knowledge of who the more you know of him the more you know of you in the beginning what happened to Adam well when when she came out on his side you know Eve you think Eve knew everything she was like a little baby isn't this with nothing the sponge you know the brain was empty who had to explain her who she was who had to explain her while she was doing there who had to explain her what was what God Said the husband she told her who she was now I shall call you what woman but that was him all the animals came he named all the animals he knew because God was in in him he was a son of God she was born out of his side and he has to tell them everything who she was what she was how to do things where we going and what we needed to do Christ did the same thing with for you and me I was lost one time and then I became a baby in Christ I don't even know anything who told me who inspired me who shows me who gave me a revelation of the knowledge who he is because as long as I know who he is I know who I am because I came out of him and that was Adam responsibility and this is your responsibility husband to show your family your wife your children who they are not only by speaking but also by showing see you are God to your family and that's the only God they're going to see your children is you because you're going to tell if God said God said God said and then they keep an eye on you to see what are you going to do so you know you got to leave while you talk you got to walk your talk you've got like you said don't do that God is not interested or that or God will not want you to do that when they're looking at you and you're doing it you are God to your families and your responsibilities to train your kids just like that I'm trained they were in the way they should go amen and the more you love them the more you want to see them going the right way amen and that was Adam at the beginning so Paul said Lord for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord so this this knowledge is it's not a one-time thing this is like I said it's Progressive that's why we come to church so we can learn more more and more see or who God is so you and I can then look at the mirror of the world and see yourself in the in that word I said that's what I am that's who I am the more you know him the more you see of him the more you know who you are that's what happened to Eve see a new husband the more they see Jesus in you the more you love them and the more they want us to meet we don't make him we don't force him we don't press them we love them into it that's what Jesus did to you guys in the beginning so progressively we become more more deeply in love with God not only with God but with his people because you can say I love God God on me are tight like this but he says if you love God and you don't love your brother is what that's a lie because if you love your brother the way God loved you it will be a different story if you forgive all that the way he forgave you that's a different story because now you can now never forgive somebody unless you experience the Forgiveness of God if you have a spirit of forgiveness of God you will know how to forgive somebody because if God forgave you why wouldn't you forget somebody the same thing we love you cannot love someone unless you know what love is I Didn't Know What Love Is and then no at one time until he loved me first see my heart at the beginning Ezekiel says you know when I was out there and he came to me he had to change first what my heart I had a Stony heart you know what Stony heart means is it's a rock nothing was seen and nothing goes out that mean I don't care about you and I don't even care about myself that was one of my problems I was bitter with everybody with myself I didn't care and I don't care what nobody was said that's what I left home because nothing goes in and nothing goes out and I cannot even love myself with that kind of a heart so what is the first thing got to do you have to give you a heart of one of Flesh something that is tender something that he can mow something that you can love him and love yourself that is the first change that had to happen because you cannot love yourself how can you love others but if you said you love God then you gotta you have to love everybody listen to me what good it is for to love those that love you and you don't love the rest of them no I'm not complaining about you guys this is not a judgment you love me and I'm not from this congregation and that's what you had to do because you had to love everybody else like you love each other they say a lot that you have for this and then you have to treat the same person or everybody that come from another church with the same love it's just one oh it cannot change so God already bought you I've gave you a tender heart now he can deal with you you know now you can love yourself and you can love other and then the next thing is what he give you what a spirit a new spirit or he would change your spirit not it's not the Holy Spirit it is the spirit that you have in you because that's who you are in your spirit your mind you know your memory feelings emotion all that is who you are you will shape and more by the world at one time and all that you knew was that but God came to change God had to change your way of thinking God had to change the way you're looking God had to change the way you hear things now you have to go to a complete change because now things are different see now you can hear the word of God you can hear the the voice of God and then you have a different attitude towards his word towards his people towards church all that has to change before I didn't want to go to church I didn't go to church for years I was born in church but then after I was 18 not until about 10 years later but see God take care of that God changed my attitudes towards the church towards the people endorsing that is the second thing you know because I had a lot of thoughts and idea about what I thought it was right God had to change and what is the last thing he do once he gave you a new heart justify you and he sanctify you what is the next thing now he said I will give you new spirit now I will guide you now I will lead you now I will show you all things to come see that's what the Holy Ghost is to Mentor you through this process so we have to have the Holy Ghost if we're not there yet we need it if you want any change in your life you have to have the changer in you the Holy Spirit cannot do it cannot make it out there without him because he's stronger it's greater it's better than Satan that is outside and we have to have him because by myself oh but this message is so difficult it's so hard yes you try to leave it in the flesh it is hard I can agree with you but you better have to get out of the way and let him lead through you this message that's what he had done with me I don't have to try I don't because he says I started the work and I will finish it I'm trusting God that through the Holy Spirit he shaped me he moaned me for glory to glory you know what I need to do surrender surrender to God yield to God my members you know like Romans says we want to be transformed not conformed to the world I already conformed to the world one time to the Fashions of the world that didn't work I wanted to be transformed change by the renewing of what the way you thought the way you saw all that has to change see it becomes the Bible becomes new to you everything becomes new to you see intimacy Acts uh 13 22 I quoted that for you that was uh about David now first John 1 7 says but if we walk in the light we are really living and walking in him as he is in the light we will have one Fellowship through unbroken Fellowship not when we want to when we please or we like to we always have fellowship with one another see and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleans us from all sins first John 1 20 if a man says I love God and headed his brother you know you say but I don't hate him yeah but you don't like him neither you know what that's called passes hey [Music] that's called passive age in fact anyway if if you want to bottom line you have to love your enemy so you don't have no way out even if that is your enemy it's not your brother you still have to love him the way you love the one next to you no difference because God don't have no respect of person I like you more than a God we all the same in his kingdom we cannot decide how we love you this much and I will love you you want God to do that with you God cannot do it because he cannot love you more and he cannot love you less we can do see we should have a consistent persistent love to everybody you know we should respect everybody even if they're sinners enemies even if they say four things even the Christians should even the judge you even if they say four things you should love them right because that's what God did to you so God is your feet your eyes your mouth your ear so you can go and love someone for him God put someone in my heart so I can love him the son says do you can love it through me that is how the work is going to be done let's quickly I don't even know how much time I got but anyway Philippians 3 9 again and be found in him not having my own righteousness he says which is of the law that's what Paul was saying but that wish is through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith he said so the Bible tell us to seek the kingdom of God first right and all the other things sometimes we do it backwards but anyway let's seek God and his kingdom first so if the doors are open of this church what he says see the kingdom of God first I understand people get sick I understand vacation I'm not talking about that but if you hold in town and you're well okay we all get tired but the joy of the Lord is my strength you know I can come to that door depressed I can drag this guy to that door he gave me a hard time this morning but I'm going to drag him to church and I'm gonna tell this fled it is my time now I'm tired of you you made a mess of me the whole Wing you gave me a hard time now it's my time to give you a hard time now you sit down you shut up and wait until I'm done that's what you need to tell the flesh drag it to church I don't care if you don't feel funny you talk listen sit it down and said shut up it's my time right and then you start worshiping the Lord and before you know you forgot about the guy because he went to sleep I mean not you the guy that's Satan yeah Satan shut up you know I had enough for you this is my time to worship god this is my chance to to rise to Heavenly places in Jesus you stay there and don't even move I'm going up in the spirit I'm going to rise up because that is where you come you know that you cannot hear from God you can come to church if I mean in the flesh um We're All In the Flesh I Came In the Flesh don't stay in the flesh your spirit needs to rise up to Heavenly places because that is where he wants to talk to you if you don't rise up to that level you might just read the same way you came in so we need to just come to service you know let's be refreshed and let's just rise up to that level and let God give us peace Comfort whatever we we need Happiness joy all these things we can find in him he says rather he says which is our God faith so Jesus said he said to John the Baptist when he came down to the world he's coming down to the world to be baptized Jesus and then what did John said uh-uh I cannot do this I need to be baptized for you I mean I'm not even worthy to to even unless your your Sonos to take your shoes what did Jesus said it behooves to do what to fulfill everyone righteousness you know what righteousness is do the right things think the right things and do the right things you think Jesus needed to be baptized to receive the Holy Ghost what did he do was not seen in him what did he need to repent from do you think that he was a child needed to be presented to the priest so they they can present them and do whatever they do you know like we present our babies we didn't but he's he did it anyway right because he needed he was an example to us he was a model so he said let us fulfill what oh and you know what you want me had to do see not our righteousness but fulfill the word of God in our lives whatever he says whatever he said we do see we are fulfilling that's why we come to church that's why we read our Bible that's why we hear the word not so they can go from this year to this year not this way but that we can fulfill all righteousness that means you think right and the only way to think right is this word and to do those things that we know our right to do that is how we walk in righteousness that's how we work in Christ that's how we know the knowledge you know you cannot do something that you don't know what to do I mean if you cannot perceive you to be something you cannot be that I mean if you don't know the question how would you know the answer but that's when you come to church so you can learn of him and then you have to go and fulfill that this is not just come to hear nice sermons and I'm not the one that's going to give you a nice time but whoever I mean there's a lot of good places I've come to this Pulpit I'm not even worthy to take casino to fit in their shoes I'm not a preacher anyway but listen to me I just love God and I want to see if I can help you in any way I can that's all but he's righteousness his word needs to be fulfilled who is going to fulfill that word you and me let your will in heaven be done where you know who is going to do it who is going to fulfill God's righteousness how people are going to see all that what you are here because he wants to use you to fulfill his word in you so people can see on one of these days they're going to say God is going to play the little bride I said this is what I meant you know what a what a good wife is you you you fulfill that part you know what a good wife's supposed to be you know what a good husband's supposed to be why because you learn it God taught you God gave you a revelation now that's why we leave that's why we we address it that's why we got long hair no long faces okay be happy so that's why we come because we want to learn so we can fulfill his word we all have to fulfill his word we are not living here until the last one is in and is dressed the word of God completely God is not coming for half of the Bride or missing at all or missing uh anything God is going to come for his body complete body and if you are part of the body the body you need to fulfill your part I don't care if you just come to church just to sit down and clap if that's all God say do that um whatever you do do it well don't just have kind of well okay I'm done do it well do it in such a you know excitement and excited that you can excite your partner next to you you know how those people are that that you kind of down on somebody or bubbly and jumping and suddenly you start and then they start whistling I start singing and you start singing you know don't tell me you don't do that I like Christmas you know just sometimes people is nicer in Christmas I don't know why but that's the best time of the year people I don't know if because they get drunk I don't know but but people are nicer in Christmas that's why people love this season they give and they take you know I'm sorry or forgive me oh yeah go ahead you know everybody's nice but after Christmas is gone back to the same thing again but anyway you know and sometimes you know this is the for people the best time of the year just for that reason but I forgot what I was scared I don't even know what I was going with this thought I remember in the middle anyway righteousness which is of god by faith you know you cannot please God without faith Eno please God Jesus please God why because they did everything that God required fulfill all the word and that is the only thing that please God by faith tomorrow that he speak to you and you do that that's that's how simple it is God Speak I do it and you know I am here to be accepted not by you but I want to be accepted by him and I'm already accepted by him I'm here because I want to please him because uh doing so I will also please you guys in in a sense as a body I do my part in the body you know that God put me to do ministering oh deacons whatever part you play a school teacher or whatever part you will do it because you want to please God whatever gift he has given you Philippians 3 10 says that I may know him see that is the only reason but I may know him in the power see what power in the quickening power in the power of his resurrection is what I want to Paul said he says uh and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering so what does this mean if he suffer and he learn obedient Christ suffering their obedience in the suffering what do you think is going to happen to you it won't be no less to know him in the fellowship of his suffering you know sometimes we want to have all the good things but we don't want the bad ones but you know he suffered and he learned obedience do you think I needed to learn opinions he knew everything he did everything right but listen to me children some young people you know how to make a mistake to be obedient that's what I did I learned by my mistakes Jesus didn't make any mistakes but he needed to learn obedience so this is the concept God spoke and he didn't disobedience that's it that's how simple it is that's count to him for obedience and the way that he the things that he went through it was obedience that means he didn't do what he wanted to do why do I have to do that you know like children why well and then can't walk out of excuses he didn't have no excuses God spoke so when parents children tell you throw the garbage the last later or why when you know when you do it you're being obedience and it comes to you as obedience it'd be a sacrifice to you to dump the garbage but it's obedience so you don't have to make a mistake you don't have to do what I did to learn you know to have all these teachable moments you don't have to make a mistake my father tried to tell me that he tried to lean me the right way my mom and you know what I told him when I was just sitting there I was rebellious you know what I said I don't want to leave you old-fashioned and I don't want to leave your experiences I want to leave mine what a mistake when I found out that I just went through what they went through and they were trying to tell me don't do that this is what's going to happen all I had to do just be obedient and do what they thought and I would be all right but no no hard-headed yeah I needed to do what I wanted to do so I learned you know how to learn young people you know how to learn that way you can be obedient just by doing by your parents tells you to do the pastor sometimes gets on you guys I know I've been here before but that is a face responsibility anyway as a pastor you know he don't hate you he don't want to you know be mad at you he's just trying to help you so you can be obedient so you don't have to fall in the hole then learn oh man actually went that way too late you're gone see you know so the word of God will lead you it's a lamb unto your feet I'll guide you so you will never get into do we have problems we come to you I mean that came to Jesus Jesus went to what he went don't you think you're going to be getting less than that you will go through that thing too and you don't have to wait for trouble because trouble will come to you but your response is to your troubles to everybody to everybody that offends you to everybody that said bad things about you to to the things that happen in your life the only thing you have you have your response to those things see and a response should be Godly you know our response to should be the same response a Christ response he went on suffer all the way unto death and he did not want open what well I opened my mom more than once at least but he didn't you know why he opened his mouth because he was fulfilling the word of God righteousness so he knew already this is me the word said this is what I do and I do it so if somebody comes to you I give you a hard time you know Connor oh joy oh yeah right praise the Lord thank you Lord for this circumstance they're going to come you know it's nobody have offended you don't worry they will offend you somebody will but what you're supposed to do you're not supposed to retaliate did Jesus retaliate it no why because he needed to fulfill the word of God and you need to fulfill the word of God this morning you have a whole year to start all over again forget what happened last week last year start again and fulfill this righteousness you have everything you need to go from Earth to heaven said you got the Holy Ghost you have everything you have need the pastor is here to guide you and lead you and help you you know so you can get there so we are without excuse we are not ignorant anymore the way we respond okay if we do it it will do because we want to then we learn that after we do it we're guilty we feel guilty of course we feel guilty you know why because the Holy Ghost convicts you said you shouldn't answer it that way you should have done that and then we feel guilty spare yourself for the guiltiness and prepare yourself all that you know things that you have to go through just do what's right and you're happy and he's happy but when you don't know when I don't do what is right what we feel guilty then we cry forgive me Lord I didn't want to do that that's not my desire now we go through all this and cry and I'm not good and I'm not worthy I don't know how you love you know we go through the whole thing and then spray yourself all that stuff just do what's right next time you you in the situation remember spare yourself all that learning process I don't need a learning process you already knows what's going to happen and how it's going to come out just trust God do what's right fulfill the word of God in your life amen I know you guys kind of quiet because you know like me stay late ate too much play too much had too much fun now I'm paying for it anyway this journey Progressive Journey the more we walk the more deeply and intimate we get with God that is how this walk is this walk it is to get to learn to be like him see to get involved with him to get involved with one another to get involved see we're in a world that that we start understanding who he is and who we are and without understanding the more we understand his character then you start understanding what character you should be also because without character we are not going to make it that is not going to unders The World God with our character so while we're looking at are we walking we see God's character in the word and what he and what he will do he trains us you know sorry it trains us and he he lead us and he shape us then as we go we are learning how to what to have his own character because we cannot handle the world with our character you know what this robot says Matthew 11 28 30 come unto me or thee that are labeled heavy laden you know overburdened people that are overburdened sometimes and I will give you what rest see I will make things easy for you see maybe the things are not easy but God in the in the middle of chaos God can bless you look at the the the the three Hebrew children you know here's the three people and they didn't have a brother Paul was talking they didn't even have a promise but he said if he saved us or not we are not bowing we going promise or no promise but we are not going to do that and that should be our response just as well it doesn't matter what happened I'm gonna do his will I'm gonna like it maybe I had to suffer it doesn't matter what but what happened the winning and a four month shows and who was you know they're morphing Jesus they are funny show with them then there was four now you think that was great let me show you something greater than that that the poor person is in you in you in you in you in you you have a promise and you have a holy ghost to help you with the promise and those Hebrew children they haven't even a promise don't even have the Holy Ghost you have everything you have need to resist the devil and do the right things see doesn't matter what happened take my joke uh the 29 up on you and learn on me that's what the Holy Ghost is there so you can learn on him Christ it is our example it is a model it's a little me for I am make gentle I'm kind and sweet so you and I to be we should be kind to one another we should be sweet we should not prefer some other than above others we should respect everyone we should be kind we should be sweet we should be humble Paul says and lowly humble remember I preached last time I came I preacher someone you remember what I was tired of humble be humble and in heart and you shall find rest unto what unto your soul that's what a lot of people that are going through and fro on Restless there's a lot of people that cannot have peace in their life they don't know if they're going or coming what to do what not to do you know what they need a change because this is not burdensome this is not hard this walk is Holy heart if we try to do it in ourselves in our might in our efforts but this he said take my joke it's easy see because he will guide us and he will show you know what a thing is that you take two animals and you put a joke on them and it's it's like this and those two are yeah that's what we do with with the ox or something when we want to turn the ground and you know if this one tries to pull that way this other one said ah we're going that way but I want to go this way no you can go that way so the same thing Jesus got you Jesus is your Mentor Jesus is your helper and every time you try to take a detour what happened the holy spirit said no and then um but I wanna I'm thirsty nope see that is why he's there the Holy Ghost is there to guide you and to lead you and to keep you straight but to have a choice still see God gave you a choice so he cannot force you but he will give you a talk don't do that if you have the Holy Ghost you know what I'm talking about conviction give you a talk don't do it when you feel that talk don't do it when you doubt remember I said don't do it if you're not sure don't do it wait upon the Lord in those moments okay he will lead you he will guide you he will keep you straight towards the mark towards the goal that is him he said take my joke up on you and learn me and it says in 30 says for my yoga CC not hard it's not hard it says it's not sharp you know it's a and my burden is light so I prefer to take his burden let him take give your burdens to him Jesus and take his burden that is light this year they just put it all in him you have a burden you have a concern you have something going in your life you have a situation just give it he wants you to give it to him see and he will take care of it all we have to do is just surrender and say and you know hear Lord I have this problem you know just tell him like it is he wants to hear your voice he wants to hear you you know this you have to voice he cannot help you until you voice his will and your concerns that's it the only way the word of God is going to take flesh gospel you own it a thought then you speak and it becomes one flesh a word and then if he's manifested that's how it works that's what happened to Satan as well listen to me resist the devil you know why he put a thought in your mind and you think it's your thought he wants you to own it you know like they're going to have a class with for man's lost him that's a problem with men's then you driving down the street he comes a naked women half naked women anyway and then you take a look because you need you know you're driving of course you're not gonna you I can you know I can avoid it what okay first look you know you got a free out of your card you know free look so anyway but receives the devil because now that that was saying look at how good it looks and Babylon you know it's not working but that is not your thoughts you need to understand man that is that you thought uh so I brought the battle that's not you but he put this thought to see if you're going to own them because as soon as you think it's you you know what happened you own them and then it become what a realization in your life you start acting up that because you think it's you there's no sin in the temptation when when he comes and said to you you're not sinning is what we take it and then he produces that so there's nothing in tempting he can tempt you all day long you are not sinning all you have to do is receive this Satan that's not me that's you you know why people feel depressed they're not because they are depressed you know who is depressed Satan because he know he's saying and he's depressed and so people have been depression in church and at home but you know that's Satan you are depressed life is awful whatever he give you all this reason and if you own it it is not you it is the spirit of depression that he puts in you and then you own it and then you say I'm so depressed don't wonder I understand why you are depressed because your own that thought all you have to do resist the domains don't accept the box of rattles don't accept the thought realize that that's his thought and just keep moving you don't have to think he's going to get you more than one so just keep moving uh he gave me a lot of thought I walked all the line and I thought and okay that's your Satan and you're going to pay for that you want me to own it so I can pay I don't I'm tired of the boohoo boo I don't want to be I want to be right so we walk every day and we are bombarded you know oh you know Medias and these and all right now I remember Christmas time you know you walk into Walmart and you walk into the stores and you hear the music you know jingle bell jingle bell you never saw Jingle Bell throughout the whole year and you don't care about Jingle Bells but as soon as the spirit comes music carries a spirit media everything game they carry spirit so then you know working in the store oh my goodness I hate that song but I'm singing that why because I heard it you know I own it and I started singing it became a reality I don't want to make his word a reality I want to make God's word a reality receive the thought you don't have to take them you know how to buy you know how to accept them realize that is that is his thought and not yours so if you understand that then you can understand more when the thought of God's coming to your mind right I mean you know when I'm mad and when I have a spirit of whatever I mean you know by sometime I get moody when I don't eat you know my sugar goes like this and my mood goes like this then my wife feeds me and then I get happy and I kiss on it but see because I don't know food made me happy I'm not the only one I bet you it will make you happy and some of us more happy than others the way we eat anyway no I like I like those places that you can make a pig out of yourself you know that that doesn't that's a scene anyway that's a scene to indulge what let's just bring it right to your living room over eating this endorsement anyway anything in excess you know that you can drink enough water until you drown yourself anything in excess it's not good for you okay so anyway let's leave that there so anyway thoughts you know there's all kind of spirits it's all kind of voices are there and all they wanted to find a place to watch to make their up you know a boat you know that that Jesus talks about that person that that uh cleaned his house you know his life he he received the Lord everything was clean and it stayed that way he never was filled with nothing but if you don't feel it with something somebody else will feel it for you that's why we had to have been filled with the Holy Ghost because if we don't feel it you know and you are not a match for Satan and then he took seven more and came back and the house wow the house is clean yeah justify sanctified but never feel so what happened the second stage was worse than the one than the first one you know what she's that one a religious stage he was still a Christian he believed in Christ he accepted but he became a Hua a religious spirit that is the worst spirit I had dealt with that is the spirit that killed and put Jesus in the cross I went to Africa I'd be going around many many years and and I go places and the worst spirit that I can find is the people you know we make a line after we pray sure we can pray for the people at the end of the meetings and I've seen this the first time I saw the Spirit they will laugh right in your face they will come and they will last in your face that religious spirit is the hardest one to get out that's why you get seven see seven is what completion see that person is completely mad anyway it's what it is and I don't want to be completely mad I want to be completely out of my mind so I can have his mind I want to be completely empty so he can fill me with the Holy Ghost I want to be empty but I want to be filled with his spirit see I want to be I want to he's Jesus you know joke is comfortable it's gracious it's Pleasant it's happiness it's peace it's Joy everything that you need you find him in Christ if you allowed you'll find it I want to reach you uh talking about intimacy this is how brother Branham puts it because it is a big part of walking you cannot walk with someone you don't agree with that person right that's what the Bible says two cannot walk you know I've been married 40 some years and sometimes I don't agree with everything with my wife but it has nothing to do with the Bible I mean what are we going to eat today well I I want Mexican no I'm tired of Mexican what do you want Oh I want salad I don't want no Saucy but I'm talking about those things but when we come to the word of God we are one in the word of God okay we agree but if you cannot agree with God you don't agree with your pastor you don't agree with your in the world how can you walk so brother brother is trying to put this in profession this is what he says God provided with I don't even know okay see what that means okay oh my goodness it's already that time okay okay here we go the next room is the bedroom now brother brother was talking that I don't care if a house has a hundred rooms 50 bathrooms and 10 kitchens it's still basically is the kitchen the living room and the bedroom the next room is the that's the last one because in that one is what intimacy happens you know what I'm talking about you people that are married that's what intimacy that's where life happens you see that's where you know uh they come together as one limit advances let's leave it there that's what that happens and that's what God wants without intimacy we are the bride of Christ and he's the bridegroom he wants intimacy but we got to get into that room now what is the first room I'll get to that in a minute the first room is the kitchen you know what is that room Fellowship we love Fellowship that's a lot of people and I don't know who they are not so I don't know who I'm talking about but I know it happens they love you because the Way You Are and they like to come to church because they feel good the way you treat them and then you have a all good kind of music programs a drama program and you got all kind of things that you offer you know that the Lord is using you Outreach programs and people love that and they come and then you don't see them again for a while until you have another something special and they come only because they like your fellowship see and some of us sometime in this message will happen is we can have Fellowship in the kitchen around a piece of chicken you know we got padlocks and we have Fellowship around food but when you come to the word of God you don't see him again see those are the people that like to come and they love and they like you what you got and then what the Church offers and that's it no commitment they don't make any commitment to the church to the pastor to you guys I just want to enjoy what you have the good part that I like but you know this one I don't know no commitment that's the kitchen the next room is the living room now the living room is when you communicate see that is when you and the little bride gets together and sit down after a good dinner you know okay we saw we worship now we are happy now now sit down I'm gonna fit you and then after with it we're going to talk see so here the word come forward God wants to communicate to you see and that is where you have to bring your expectations you know what happened to Corpus they don't last too long when they get married because they never sit down to find out who is who and what do I expect of you and what you expect of me I think couple that they get married and they never sit down to talk you know they were too happy with the with the food but they you know they thought that that was the whole team you know so when they get married she expected that he will act like the father that he knows that's what she knows that was his first love that is his father so he think he's marrying his father and he should act just like that's what she had he was looking for a mother because that's all he knows that was the first wife the first I mean the first woman that's the one that took care of him I mean he's looking for wife so what happened again they never sit down to talk about expectation so now things start working the way it should be but I expected you to do this and he said but I expected to cook well I never cooked my mango but I told you and he so then what happened after a while they don't even last the living room God is going to tell you what he expect of you see that is when you talk to God said I got laid out the rules here it is you know this is what I want you to do this is the word this is how you should walk this is how you should Converse this is how you should communicate as my wife this is what I want you to do you know cut your hair you wear dresses you know wear pants out for the for the ladies meant to cut your hair you dress you put pie you take your shorts off at least in public you know Vermont says that put bathing suits and short and go in public so because sometimes I you know I put my pajama shorts at home but I'm going to sleep I'm not you know displaying myself out there that's what I'm saying depending while we're talking sometimes we say well my mom said no one not short well listen to me we're not gonna get there that's not the scope of my preaching that what I'm saying is expectations and the pastor come and you come every Sunday that's what people that don't make a commitment they don't know what God expects of you that's what he come this is what God wants this is what you need to do this is what I expect of you and then you can walk in it because now you know what you're supposed to do the husband Aram Jesus tell the little bride this is what I'm expecting on you and if you do this you know I love you no he's not going to love you less you don't do it and he's not going to love you more and you do it because nobody can take you away nobody comes from the love of God not even Satan you know he already love you and you cannot do nothing to for him to love you more and you can do not unless that he love you less neither he's love you but like everything else when we made mistakes we got to pay you know for the things that we do just like a child you tell them to do something and we don't do but they had to they had to that's a responsibility that he was supposed to do so he's accountable for that if not you pay for the consequences right if you and I don't do what we're supposed to do God the Bible said that he chastise those that we want but he lost he lost you but sometimes he had to strain you out if we don't because he already told you I expect from you exactly God don't play around exactly perfect this is what I want you to be this is how my wife to be you know Jesus is the Lamb and he's going to marry what alone he's not going to marry you know like Satan he has also a bride it's called the Jesus is not filthy Jesus is clean and Jesus is pure and Jesus is Holy who you think is going to marry someone that is going to make that way in in this work and brother bear says now then when you got when you get to this bedroom then see people might get to the kitchen the Life Fellowship no commitments they might another advance to the to the living room and they start coming and they start hearing what is required what God required and sometimes they don't want to do that uh that's too hard I don't think we need to do that well I'm a Christian and and I don't think we have to do all that I just forgot to to love us what they got all kind of excuses okay so you don't see them too long after a while they come and they disappear but that's not where I want to go I want to go further than I says you come to the fellowship and what a relationship now your brother brother Paul talks a few serious about relationship and about uh fellow I know I know that because I listen at them but fellowship and relationship now a simple uh definition or relationship is a connection that's all simple and simple form is a connection you have to have a connection that's why people come and go they don't handle they don't connect you know sometimes you meet somebody and we ask you how it was that did you like them did you connect it that's why we said yeah I think we we have the same kindred spirit we connected there had to be a connection without a connection there's no nothing no no way to continue because there's nothing if we don't have the same values the same belief the same thing there's no way we can there has to be a collection and this is our collection that we believe the message we believe the word of God we believe that the world the hour that's something that connects us a relationship is a collection you become into what a relationship from fellowship we have to be come to collection that's what happened in intimacy you husbands and why it's a connection you know brother Paul talks about when a man and a woman come together you know sometimes it's all lovey Lobby you know and it says once they do that that connection leaves an imprint that's why we don't want to do something unless it's got to prove anyway I don't that's not my trick you know you'll be coming into a relate then you have complete one I don't just want Fellowship I want complete Fellowship complete Fellowship is I'm moving from the kitchen to the living room to what to have intimacy with my bridegroom that's what he wants he says he said because you cannot have complete Fellowship until you become one into a relationship you know what today that's what the people today the the younger people they don't want to have a commitment that's why they only want to have Fellowship because they don't want to compete and they live together because he don't know if that's going to last or not I mean that's kind of a bargain you know let me not go there anyway you know why why pay for the milk when you have a cow that's what they said there that's not the way to go so what happened no commandment because well I don't know if this is going to last and if it's not going to last since we are not married we will go our separate way no commitment see no relationship no connection there's nothing to connect them anyone knows that and listen so it's with the church today now the church today we got too many people we got too many of them that are ashamed to go into a complete now first was complete relationship I mean complete Fellowship that is complete relationship with God to the bedroom New Life new birth that's what children conceive if we if we are the brother of Jesus Christ then why can't now we go into a relationship this year if you are not in that relationship and you're finding your side not changing and everything is going the same way all the time you continue doing the same thing you might want to find out if you are in that relationship with God or not complete that's when you surrender completely you saw to God and you said do unto me that's what the marriage happens you know it says then all the sameness and backwardness and all gone for us because sometimes we don't feel good you know that's what pastors and you know they don't they don't have one he had to do but I think in in Tucson they cannot come together to have Fellowship around the world because everybody had their own you know ideas and revelation so what happened is everybody free backwards and difficult they come together and they feel unease why I'm not feeling honest when this church do you feel honest on this church when I'm around you do you feel kind of I don't know about this guy no why because we connected I am connected to Christ you're connected to Christ we have an interesting mankind so we don't feel shame or we don't feel bad awareness and we are okay okay I'm okay let's walk together I don't care if I belongs on somebody in Texas you know you don't say murder a church Bride is a body so the same body that is here we have a portion of my body in Tucson so I should feel the same way that I've been in Tucson that I feel here with you I should feel the same way under this pastor that I feel under that Pastor is not something is wrong I lose a collection because my connection is that poor my connection is not brother dog my connection is Christ it is the spirit of God that I'm looking at I'm not looking at man and I'm not looking at church what church I'm going or you going I'm looking at going with Christ that's where my sight that's what I'm focusing in Christ and if you are in Christ and you are in Christ and all this is okay then all this is okay vertically as well see because we're not looking at the church to satisfy me see that's what expectation I was telling you God be expect something for her and they were all the way around and when that expectation Islam made you know what happened you get disappointed people come to church on time looking at you and you and you and the pastor and we're not perfect yet not yet you know I still made mistakes so what happened we get disappointed oh well look at what he did oh look at what he said well you know what that's going to happen but I'm not looking to the pastor and not looking to the man I'm not looking to the church and look into the spirit of God of Christ you know he says and then he continues saying standing on the street you know it says uh oh relationship born it says let's see what I am here well I read it from here at 27 I think it was 27. oh I think I finished it all no I didn't I'm in brown again second mistake I made you know why I'm allowed only three mistakes a year and I already made two you know what happens if I made the last one three strikes and I'm out you won't see me until the next year that I got had three strikes again two strikes okay let's see where that one is at way okay wait well it's one before that I don't know who's doing okay okay Shameless and backwardness and all gone from us go back to the first one and we come into complete relationship be born again okay complete relationship be born again the Holy Spirit has to be there that's one of the things that has to be the president of the United States could be standing in the street you can shout hallelujah praise the Lord hallelujah you don't you don't care you don't care who see you you don't care uh you know who hears you and we go to church we should be the same way if you are wondering you know but I better don't try to or Don't Clap too loud or don't say too loud because they listen you call me to have an experience with God everything else you block it out you came to worship God you not came here to be accepted by the people you came to be accepted by him your worship is to him he needs to accept that worship it is your sacrifice to him not to anybody else and he's the one needs to be pleased with your sacrifice yeah I'm not the one that tells you it's good borrowing different that's between you and who and God he says she will never come in he says okay he said you are born again you are a new child you are in the Chicago Glory with God fellowshipping with you here we go again brother Brian is trying to bring an image an imagery here and the image is that the Tabernacle in the desert you have the auto Court you got the holy and you have the Chicana Glory now in in the outer core it rains it was nothing it was no no no tetram no no roof so what happened is uh if it rains you get mad and if the sun don't shine you get mad and if you get too cold you get mad and if you get too hard you get mad see your your feelings go up and down if you stay in the outer core if you come just to Fellowship because you like the people and you like what they give that's it you know one day you come and then you don't you're like a JoJo up and down up and down up and down so what happened is in the outer core you know nothing is stable one day you got it in a good mood let's say you're not in that got a good mood so what happened you need to move to the second one the second one is what the Holier the holy and in the Holy One is the candles and the the show bread right and Jesus is the bread it's a better life and he is the light and in that one at least you you are better than being the other core but that's not the end of it because the light can go off you know the wind come or they pray for God to put the bread and now you're hungry and there's no light and it's dark now I'm scared well you need to move to them other one that is what the Shekinah Glory see intimacy that's where Fellowship you know and then you have here the living room communication companionship and then you fall into the Chicana Glory that is your complete intimacy complete Fellowship that is where you have in fellowship with God that is when you when you have a problem when you walk this year you start walking and you have a problem you get in your closet and you close the door and you get inside that she kind of glory and I tell you and I promise you that you will not come out the same way you went in see because there there is where you have a fellowship complete fellowship with who with God Amen he says and continue saying he says this thing it says Chicana Glory fellowship with him that's what the what we need today this is what we want this war to be closer to God we got to get in the Chicana Glory we need to move forward we need to get in in him he's in you and you and him he said in that day you know that I'm in the Father the father in me and I mean what it could become a connection it becomes a Unity it becomes a completeness because three is perfection see he in me and me and also knew so that's all you need enter into that complete relationship with God said that's what today brother is worship under the blood Worship in complete relationship intimacy with God it says to die out that is going to require to die out we have come as far as we're going to come last year yeah we are 2000 to 2023 we have come as far as we're going to come unless this year we sacrifice more we had done a part but you're going to require a little bit more sacrifice and depend on the sacrifice you made that's how far you're going to go are you willing to sacrifice and allow your entire life for him that is what's going to require bro everyone says so we need to sacrifice more we're already going to church twice and now or never miss a church it's not about missing Church nobody's keeping authality to see when you came and who came and holding that's not what it's about it's about completely dying out and let God live through you that's all right let's not miss it then over here says in Philippians 3 11 um by any means am I attained unto the resurrection of the Dead see expectation that was his expectation when we come to church we have to have an expectation as well he says Jeremiah 29 11 says for I know the thought that I think towards you said the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you one you expected in what disrespecting and what is your expectation whatever your expectation is that is your expected in what is poor expectation was what the Rapture the change of the body you know to have that quickened life in him like Jesus said that Spirit of Jesus raising from the dead and is in you and in me Paul says that will what raise you up that was his expectation at the end is that he promised me that he started working will finish it he promised me see if that is my expectation when I come to church he promised me that he will satisfy me that he will meet my niece that this is my healer he's my protector he promised me and God cannot lie and Paul said my expectation is that when I get to the end of the road what I will be rise up again and every person that had died in the past 2000 years even in the Old Testament they was looking towards that expectation and now we look into that sacrifice that he made in the cross for you and me so if we die or we go in the Rapture but if we die when we die we go to sleep with the same expectation that all those Christians has in 2000 years that God will raise me see so we don't have to be afraid of that because we cannot die as much as God can die and Paul says you know I got a body here and I have another prepare so here or there he was happy because we are not going to see that this had to go in the ground but that's condemned already this flesh it says First Corinthians 1 7 9 so that that you come it says behind login so God has give you everything God has gave all the gifts that this church needs for what he says behind no give waiting for the coming of the Lord this church God had gift you with what you need to help each other to grow to develop until the what the coming of the Lord you had no you are not lacking here you are not lacking anything in fact you are blessed with what you have but all this has a reason to be all this come to prepare you for the coming of the law it's not an entertainment it's not entertainment it's to get you ready you made that connection you get in the intimacy with God and you had that expectation but when you get there that is your expectation that he will rush you in that day hey who shall also establish you says confirmed or established you he's going to bring you to a manifestation see or he's waiting for you and I to let him have his way he wants to be manifested in flesh again and he will his word will be manifested but he is waiting on you and me to give him and surrender and give him the Liberty to take over that's all and he wants you to do that and he wants me to do that he says Until the End see on to the end he will finish the work to the end he will vindicate this word see that you might be blameless no shame no gear no sin that is my expectation you know he said he will have a a bride with our spot with a wrinkle no shame no guilt no sin I'm free and when I die I will die without expectation see that I am a Son of God now nothing now I am a Son of God he says that you may be blameless he said in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ the day when he comes you kind of stand there and you know how to be ashamed because you don't but you're supposed to do he did what he's supposed to do and here we are what he promised he will give you that expectation if you believe it and that's what you're expecting to be in that day in his presence you know will not give with nothing we're not shame that's what we're going to show a virtual holy bride will not Sparrow no ring online God is faithful see that means he's reliable see we can depend on God today you can maybe not depend on me but you can depend on his word what he promised he will bring it to pass in your life he says he's trustworthy by whom you were called into what a fellowship see in complete Fellowship he called you so he can have fellowship with you and you with him complete Fellowship he says uh of of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord through his through Jesus Christ is what we have in this Fellowship he called you this war this war and the Every Soul of this world is that we have Fellowship complete Fellowship intimacy we got we need to get there we are not living here until the last one gets there you might be there you might be there about us we gotta wait for the last one to get there because there is what we're going to meet you know then we're gonna go we're going to meet there as a body it says complete Fellowship in the song Sugar we were created God created us for that God wanted Fellowship God wanted a family this is not your idea you know when God saw and I'm almost finished hopefully when God thought when Adam says you know it should not be a man to be alone he was alone that was an Aram idea because Jesus God was alone in the darkness you know before the foundation he was alone that thought was not Adam thought that was God thought because God is projecting his thoughts so he made him a maid you know so God was alone and he also wanted to have Fellowship that was his idea that's why he created you and me so we can be a family and he started creating the bride you know from the beginning from from uh they opened the course brother said that was the birth of the church that's what he started bringing her slowly through Seven Ages now she's here 60 some years after brother now she's an adult she's a now she can be married because that's going to happen right here and then we're going to go to the supper see here is what the connection is going to happen the marriage happens here in this side of time not over there we're going to the wedding supper see so here is where all that connection is happening amen so let me reach you let me reach you uh let's jump to uh Shalom again I want to finish this this Shalom 140 verse 140. let's jump a little more so we can advance quickly oh yes sir New Year doesn't mean turning a new page it says oh no not turn a new page it's turning to the Hua to the word see that's what the word promised for today see what the light of the day is supposed to be the light of the deities the message of the hour and what the word promised is that we will have fellowship with God complete fellowship with God see we're going to walk towards that what we ought to do this year is not go back to crits and things go back to our or to our denomination no go back to all the nomination but turn to the word see what kind of light is supposed to shine what kind oh Church to the word get back to the word flip the right switch quick punching around in electric light see artificial man-made turn to his word and see the promise of the day of today and then once we see that promise we walk into it we need to find out what God requires what God expect and let's walk into that in this year if you know if God help us that's what we want to do we want to progress we want to go forward and then see what the promise is watch foreignification of vindication see when it is Vindicated and this message it has been over Vindicated it's already Vindicated see and then see what the promises the identification the Vindication then you know wherever you are in the light or not if this world will not produce what God said it will produce you in the wrong track is this word produces love and you're not loving one another like you're supposed to then something is not right in this word Pro promise that you will have fellowship with one another not only with God but with with each other if it's not producing that then something is wrong if this word is not producing the word in you completely God in flesh again the manifestation of God again in this earth then win the wrong track we need a change to me I want to see what promised for the day I want to know what the light of the hour so I can know how to walk you cannot walk it you don't know where you're going you might say I know the message I believe brother Brown and I believe the Bible yeah I'm standing on the on the message here but which way are you going you need to know what direction you're going are we going to towards God are we going left or right so brother says unto long to walk in it sometimes like a child when you have to you know help him walk and take the first step and that's what brother Paul do as a pastor helping you to what to walk in the right direction as you learn showing you that's the way we're going and then he put a vision you know in front of you that is the vision and that's where we're going see and his vision should be the same thing as my vision you know how many Holy Ghost do we have in this message it's just one Holy Ghost and in that Holy Ghost is doing that and you have to do the same thing in me why I don't understand some people are doing their own thing and then they said I got the Holy Ghost or I understand my Holy Ghost don't let me do that you won't have a different Holy Ghost see I want to know what the light of the hour is so I can know how to walk in it I want to know where I am living right now see my friend uh I want to know how far up the road I am that's for me is a it's a softbox I like to know just because when I used to be younger and even all that I like to be in control no longer in control but I need to know where I am where I'm going and how to get there well how are you going to get can you imagine if I leave Tucson and I'm going to Michigan and I throw my phone away and no map I'm going to do so okay good luck you might end up in Mexico I don't know someone in Tijuana so you need to know where you're going you need to know where you are and you need to know where that is and you start walking towards the goal towards the mark so that's what we're doing here that's what your pastor do encourage you show you the vision this is the goal this is the objectives forward March and then he looks back where's everybody you know stick with your pastor because he he is equipped responsible to take you all the way through amen but we know who holds the future I don't know what the future is none of us do but we know who holds the future so you don't have to know everything you don't know how to understand anything but you must believe everything in this message on the word of God and the one last thing patience patience some of us guess so some of us gets in social behavior I think and many a good man has done that you get into too much hairy you want to see you want to do it yourself never put your never what is the saying never put your your uh in front of the horse the car in front of your horse thank you okay listen don't try to be ahead always follow the lord stay behind don't get any frowned because of his plan because you don't know how can you know if you don't have nobody leading you see brother says you're doing it yourself you're trying to lead yourself you try to do things on your own and we can don't get in a hurry be still you know let God do the the way show you the way don't try to be ahead of God because we're going to fail amen patience let me reach you this and I will finish Romans 5 1 4 therefore by justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access to faith into his grace where we stand a rejoicing hope of glory now are not only so about we glory in Tribulation sacrifice we're gonna be we're gonna be uh uh be learned by by the things we we experience good bad and ugly listen my friend I don't say mother how it happens but we should always move forward you know when times come bad times good times we're gonna serve the Lord see I don't care if I have to drag myself to the door don't let nothing distract you don't let nothing pull you away from this world no because some people like to serve God when everything is going good when they're in the mountain but when things are going you know the wrong way now they don't know if they want to serve God God what God is love God would not let us do that no see he says and so but we glory in tribulations man what's wrong with this guy Glory how many light to glory and pain and suffering but he did Glory because God is doing something God is shaping you he's using those things so he can mold you those things help you also knowing that the tribulation Works what patience you know why because you got away on the Lord when you're in those situations God is trying to teach you something way up on me be patient because I'm working I'm doing something you don't know you don't see it but I'm working even if you don't feel it even if you don't see it I'm working because God is faithful he says and patient experience once you go through whatever you go through then you have a what experience now when you experience God the more you experience God the more confidence you have on God see and experience bring what hope he says and in your passion you possess your what your soul better things for you this year but beloved we are persuaded we are convinced better things of you better things this year Paul said it says and things that accompany things that are near coming salvation through a company salvation through we does speak this is why Paul speaking for God it's not alrighteous to forget or to overlook he said your works and labor of love which you you have showed towards his name and in that you have ministered to the Saints unto the mystery and we decide that every one of you do show the same diligence persistent to the full Assurance or development you know go all the way see all the way through of Hope on to the end all the way he said that ye be not what slot for some people in this message the world they they grow kind of the symptoms they lose interest they lose interest of church the most interesting farming Fellowship they don't pray anymore why posted they be not lost for he said but followers of them who through faith see walking close to God the entire personality on God in Christ an absolute Trust and Power in wisdom in goodness and by practicing with passion endurance and waiting for the fruit in this season patient is a virtue it's not something that that you can get just like character character is not something that I give it's something that Embraces something that we have to work for not work in the center of working but you have to fight for character you God is going to bring you it's something that that is not given to us it is something that we're gonna have to you know put ourself in the bottom and just push all the way through and every experience that we go through it brings one a little bit more character a little Roma character a little bit more character amen shall we stand sorry I kept you this long but it took me three days to come this way and I only took a couple of hours so you owe me
