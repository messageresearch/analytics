========================================

I've seen a vision harsh and sweet one who gave all he had for me I've seen the passion of his death and the forgivness in his final breath now I can never be the same my heart has been forever changed I've got to live in love and give because he [Music] gave now I'm giving my life way laying it down on the altar now I'm giving my life [Music] away the very least I can offer is my own so here I stand [Applause] today giving my life [Music] away no earthly price could be too great and no sacrifice to my much to make no way of [Music] measuring the cost next to the blood of Cal's cross so if I live I live for him oh if I die I count it again my life is not my own but his from this day on and now I'm giving my life away I'm laying it down on the altar now I'm giving my life away the very I can offer is my so here I stand today giving my life [Music] now I'm giving my life away I'm laying it down on the altar now I'm giving my life away the very least I can offer is my own so here I stand today giving my life [Music] away so here I stand today giving my love life away [Music]
