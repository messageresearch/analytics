evening Lord circumcise my lips my my mind and my heart and Lord don't allow that any word will come out of my mouth that is not pleasing before you Lord I ask all these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen praise God hallelujah open our Bible Romans chapter 15. let us read the verses one to three it says within that are strong ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves let every one of us place his neighbor for his good edification for even Christ please not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproach the fell on me and one more scripture uh in the book of uh in First Peter chapter 2 verse 5. says ye also as Lively stones are built up the spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ may the Lord and blessing upon the reading of his word and you will be seated in the presence of the Lord and uh tonight I would like to title this message uh uh the royal priesthood Hallelujah he also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ spiritual priesthood Hallelujah now when you talk about priesthood in the Old Testament the priest they are those people that uh they live uh with a dedicated lives Hallelujah to God and not to live for their own Hallelujah serve for the brethren and uh when Joshua divided the land uh they didn't have a portion of the land Alleluia and yet Gada was taking care for them and God is their portion and they are they are those uh uh the other tribe of Israel that uh didn't care so much for they don't do so much and they don't care so much for the things for the material things but they are more on the spiritual side they they work in in the temple to serve for the Brethren Hallelujah and uh the Bible said that uh he has made us in uh Revelation chapter five verse 10 that he has made us Kings and Priests unto our God Hallelujah and uh King uh priest in the Old Testament and then uh their Works their their job halleluia is to serve people is to serve their brethren and then uh the Bible said that he has made us Kings and Priests unto our God now the natural Israel is a type unto the church which is the the spiritual Israel Hallelujah now this evening I would like to to take an example of Israel's Journey when they came out of Egypt and when they journeyed into the Promised Land Hallelujah and brother Abraham said that uh many people refer the promised land to Millennium to the millennium and he said it is not the promised land had Wars and killings the Millennium won't have any wars or killings it referred to the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit the battlegrounds Allelujah and uh once we become a part of that body the body of Jesus Christ and barbraham said that we are not on a picnic we are on a Battlefield that's why maybe some of you are wondering why you have more the trials that you that you are having now Allelujah is uh you know more you have more trials than uh the first time you accepted the message Hallelujah because uh in uh uh we are not in in a picnic and we are on a Battlefield now in Israel's Journey to the promised land there were three stages the same to the three stages of Grace when when God redeemed his church Hallelujah and uh Redemption Abraham said that Redemption means to bring back to its original position and uh Israel there are rightful position is not in Egypt the rightful position is in Canaan land Alleluia and they were just born when they were born at that time they were already under there are the bondage they were already under uh their their task Masters and uh they don't they didn't do anything but when they were born that was already their situation Hallelujah but uh you know their rightful position is in Canaan so God had to redeem them and bring them back to Canaan the same thing with the church Hallelujah we were born in sin uh when we were born we are already born under bondage of sin Allelujah under the spirit that worketh the Bible says that worketh in the children of these obedience Hallelujah but by his grace we have also this uh three stages of Grace by justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost this is to bring us back into our rightful position justification when they left Egypt after they heard the message of of the prophet of God believing the word then they separated themselves from the Egyptians and then sanctification after they crossed the Red Sea and killed all the things behind them like all the Egyptians all Egypt all the world was killed behind them and uh through the uh the blood that kills all the human desire and he is sanctifying us hallelujah from the desires of evil then the last stage is the baptism of the Holy Ghost is when they crossed Jordan Hallelujah into the promised land which uh their inheritance laid and Jordan means death halleluia and uh by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are born after uh the third stage Hallelujah which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and through the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are born into that body we become a part of the body of Jesus Christ First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 13 for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body not because you are a member of this uh Church the little literal church but you have this experience Hallelujah to be baptized with the Holy Spirit into that one body and then you become a part of that body and when you become a part of the body like just like God Israel after Crossing Jordan then the greatest battle that happened in the time of Israel was after the Cross Jordan not the wind they just left Egypt but when they started to possess the promised land those that had crossed Jordan death Alleluia they have this great battle all this land Hallelujah all the land in every place that the soul of your uh uh fourth have trade Hallelujah that land is yours the promise is yours Hallelujah all will be yours but God he did not just uh give them easy like that but when God promised Hallelujah the Promised Land he put some Giants and he put some old cities and well-trained soldiers Hallelujah and behav to fight every inch of their inheritance it's the same thing to us brothers and sisters but the only thing that but the only good thing that God has done is he said the battle is not yours the battle is of the lord we are fighting Hallelujah a battle that is already that had been already conquered Hallelujah we are fighting an enemy that's been defeated Allelujah and we only have we only need to have faith Hallelujah on the word of God and not to to live Hallelujah by our by our senses by our emotion Hallelujah but we have to live what the Lord what the word of God says hallelujah now in the natural battle it needs teamwork Hallelujah that's why like you have the the number one military force in the world is the United States and you can even in the in the Philippines the U.S forces they go there with our Philippine forces and they they do some war games Hallelujah military exercises a teamwork the ground forces how they use the artillery the Air Force the Navy and they must have in Perfect Harmony Hallelujah and uh in the Philippines we call it balikatan exercises balikatan means shoulder to shoulder Hallelujah and when you are in in a battle Hallelujah if you are in in ground force Allelujah you are with the ground force you have to fight Hallelujah with your body shoulder to shoulder and sometimes you know when I was uh when I was a boy there is uh there was a military come near to our house and this armies sometimes they are not in the field they go to to places and sometimes I remembered one time the the they were drinking at my at our house and sometimes these uh these soldiers they are having sometimes uh quarrel with the uh with his fellow Soldier they have sometimes misunderstanding but when they are in the field they have to forget all their misunderstanding Hallelujah and they have to help one another Hallelujah and brothers and sisters it's the same thing Hallelujah we are in this great battle maybe you have some misunderstanding your upset your with your sister you feel upset with the brother but brothers and sisters you should know your enemy Hallelujah we should have we should fight shoulder to shoulder Hallelujah and you have to cover your your body Hallelujah and fight your true enemy uh eternal life is living for others Hallelujah in the message that they on Calvary he says now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfect eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you have an eternal life because eternal life is living for others that's why in Romans chapter 15 verse 1 it says we that are strong ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves Hallelujah now remember that uh you cannot bear the infirmities of the week when you yourself is weak Hallelujah we know yourself is still a baby and that's the reason one of the reasons that God gave us the fightful ministry is in order for us to not to remain children in Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11. he says 11 to 14 he says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the defying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto a perfect man if you will look this word perfect if you will click it and see the Greek Lexicon it means perfect means full grown matured adult Allelujah till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God so he gave he gave us despiteful Ministry of the knowledge of the son of God a perfect man in order for us to be full grown to be matured to be adult and to the measure of this teacher of the fullness of Christ verse 14 that we henceforth be no more children Hallelujah those two and fro and carried about with Ibraham abduction by this light of man and cunning craftiness whereby Delight in weight to deceive in order for us to not to remain children Hebrews chapter 5 verse 12 for when for this for the time he ought to be teachers so Paul was a little bit disappointed after uh uh doing his part to help them in order for them to be matured he says he ought to be teachers what what is the use of teachers to help others to grow Hallelujah then he said he have made that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as that need of milk you're still baby need of milk and not of strong meat and here is uh some signs about a babe or a child First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 1 verses 1 to 4 he says and I breathe in could not speak unto you as unto spiritual means as anti-spiritual but it says us unto colonel you are still a babe when you are carnal Hallelujah but when you are spiritual then you are full grown Hallelujah even as unto babes in Christ they are in Christ but they are still Hallelujah babes I have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto you were not able to Bear it neither yet now are ye able for ye are yet carnal Allelujah so carnality means being a yet a babe for year yet carnal for whereas there is among you in being we knew see these things in weighing and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and work as men for a while one says I am a Paul and another I am a bipolos are ye not carnal carnal in a babe Hebrews chapter 5 verse 13 for everyone that uses milk is unskillful Hallelujah in the word of righteousness for he is a babe Hallelujah it means when you are when a man is when uh when a Believer is still a babe he is unskillful imagine you go to war and you have a babe you have a big video he cannot help Hallelujah he is just a burden Hallelujah brothers and sisters we are in this great battle Hallelujah and we need to grow Hallelujah and he has made us Kings and Priests Alleluia means priest Hallelujah to offer up sacrifices Hallelujah for the brethren Hallelujah so being a babe is unskillful and now here are some signs of a man being a matured one John chapter 21 verse 18 he says verily verily I say and today when thou was young the goodness thyself and focused whether the worst but when thou art behold Thou shalt stressport thy hands and another shall guard thee and carry thee wither the word is not when you are young you do whatever you want to do and you go to places that you want to go when you are still young you know your own will but when you became old you became matured you don't know anymore the things that you want to do you just transport your hands and somebody's will even though you don't like to wear yellow shirt Hallelujah you can do nothing because it is no more you Hallelujah it is somebody who wants uh to put the you need to put this the shirt and you just have to stretch out your hands Allelujah you don't go to places that you want to go it is no more your will be done when you become old you learn how to say lord it's not my will but your will be done in me it is no longer you that liveth Hallelujah just like Paul Hallelujah before his conversion halleluia he wants to persecute he wants to kill the Believers Hallelujah but after he was converted he was no longer living for his own it is now Christ that lives in him instead of persecuting the Believers he become now a support a help to the Believers Hallelujah that's why in Galatians chapter 2 verse 20 he says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live it's not I that liveth but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God it's not even his own faith he is living the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me Hallelujah we are a man started Living halleluia under the leading of the Holy Ghost he is old and then that's the time that he can help Hallelujah the week Luke chapter 22 it was better Hallelujah it was Peter 31 and 32 he says and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan had desired to have you that he may save you a sweet but I have prayed for they that thy faith fell not and when they were converted strengthened thy brethren although Peter was determined to protect Allelujah his master when his master said the shepherd shall be smitten and the Sheep shall scatter Peter in his Human Nature he said Over My Dead Body Hallelujah and then when Malco was trying to arrest the Lord and he drew his sword and you know he went to cut the head of Malco but malko escape and it was only his ear was cut Hallelujah but uh Peter Peter put back put back your sword Hallelujah and then before his conversion halleluia just a lady isn't it that you are with with that Jesus I don't know what you are saying Hallelujah he denied three times Allelujah then uh it seems he is a tough guy but he was a covered one Hallelujah but brothers and sisters but when the word Peter you cannot help now but when they were converted when was Peter was when Peter was converted after when he was baptized with the Holy Ghost filled with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's the time he says when thou art converted that's the time yet that you can strengthen your brethren I believe birds and sisters that Peter he got a wife the Bible said he got a mother-in-law if you have a mother-in-law I believe you he got a wife and maybe he he got children Alleluia but after he was converted that's why one time he was complaining Mark chapter 13 verse 20 to 30 then Peter began to say unto him Lo we have left all and have followed the Hallelujah and Jesus answered and said verily I say unto thee unto you there is none that had left house so I believe he got the house Allelujah left house or Brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gods and in the gospels but he shall receive 100 fold now in this time houses and Brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life Hallelujah I believe maybe his neighbor was watching Peter when Peter was leaving his house leaving his family I think Allelujah and maybe his neighbor was thinking oh this is a responsible person Hallelujah he is living you know he got a responsible for his family Alleluia but he is living he always leave his house his family but the thing that they don't know is there were thousands of Soul being held Hallelujah they were Believers that being helped because when he he became converted he is no longer living for his own but he was living for others Hallelujah doing his Hallelujah his uh his obligation to strengthen the brethren Hallelujah after he was converted after he lived under Alleluia the leading of the Holy Ghost and that's the time that he became matured Allelujah in the Lord Hallelujah you know Israel before deposits The Land Before the Cross Jordan Alleluia and Moses Jose he had died he chose 12 spice Hallelujah in every tribe he just won Maybe if somebody will ask a brother Paul you you send our president one representative from your church and maybe purple will uh look for uh one who is who is matured in the faith that it seems he is already matured in the faith Hallelujah maybe that was that was the thing that happened to Israel they chose somebody who is uh who is like spiritual and then they went to search the land Allelujah and when they returned Numbers Chapter 13 Verse 26 and they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel and to the children apparent to kaddish and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the Lamb Hallelujah and they told him and said we came unto the land wither thou sentest us and surely it flew with with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it Allelujah you know how they knew how they knew that the land is fluid with milk and honey flowing with milk and honey before they they got into that land the word of the Lord had already told them that that is the kind of land that they are going to possess and he said this is the fruit of it this is the evidence of the word of God that the word of God is true Allelujah but brothers and sisters after that report then they continue and said nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are world and very great and moreover we saw the children of Anna there and their malachites dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the devil sites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell in the sea and by the coast of Jordan Hallelujah I first they gave a report according to the word of God debates on the word of God yes the word of God is true and this is the evidence imagine brothers and sisters just one cluster of grapes when you buy a cluster of grapes this time maybe it's only one pound or one kilo but at the time just one cluster of Braves two of them carrying it Hallelujah and this is the fruit this is the evidence that the word of God is true so when they look to the world Hallelujah this is the evidence the word of God is true but then they started Hallelujah telling the report based on their emotions on their on the thing that they saw By Their Eyes by their carnality Hallelujah but the men that went and he said no and they brought up an evil report of the land that they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which uh we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up inhabitants how do you know that they are eating inhabitants Hallelujah who told you you go there when you go there and then you can you return you are all still 12 why did you say who is the one lacking who is the one missing is there somebody missing among the club Hallelujah because it's only they are just basing it through you know their fear in their hearts and in their the negative things in their mind and that's carnality Hallelujah he says it is inhabitant the rope and all the people that we saw in it her men of a great stature and there we saw the Giants the sons of Enoch which come of the Giants and we were in our own sights our own site as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight we were in their sight as grasshopper did this giant told you that you are just aggress repair to me Hallelujah it is only by their carnality halleluia and when they gave their karna their reports basing on their carnality instead to help the congregation Allelujah it made the congregation weaker and doubted the word of God Hallelujah Numbers Chapter 14 verse 1 and all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried and the people wept that night and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them what God that we had died in the land of Egypt or would God now we had died in this Wilderness and therefore had the Lord brought us unto this land to Fall by The Sword and our wives and our children should be afraid were it not better for us to return into Egypt Hallelujah imagine brothers and sisters because of their carnality of being a babe being weak Allelujah it did not help the weak Hallelujah it made them more weaker halleluia instead of just believing to what God had said it's instead of believing Hallelujah the leading of God imagine brothers and sisters after 40 years Hallelujah there is no feeble among them they did not work and yet after 40 years they are still alive it is enough versus sisters to to trust on the word of God Hallelujah just to live by it Allelujah verse 5 then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the Assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel and just what the son of nun and Khalid in in calib the son of japoni which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they speak until the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we passed Pastor the church is it is a is an exceeding good land Hallelujah then here is here are Joshua and khalib they are not basing on what we should what we saw they are missing the report on what the Lord had said Hallelujah they rent their clothes and verse 8 it says if the Lord Delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey if the Lord Delight in US if the Lord pleased us hallelujah how to please God without faith it is impossible to please him Hallelujah without faith what is faith faith is the substance of thing hope for the evidence of being not sin not by our observation not by our emotion but Hallelujah just to believe what God what the word of God is Hallelujah so they always believed the word what the word says hallelujah and not uh what they see with their eyes and then verse 9 only Rebel not ye unto the Lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us their defense is departed from them and that the Lord Is With Us fear them not imagine brothers and sisters they were in the same group they saw the same thing they tested the same fruit of the land Alleluia but the other two the based on the word of God the report on the word of God and the other halleluia and the others they based on what they see what they feel Hallelujah brothers and sisters those that are carnal those that debate the report on their Hallelujah on what they see Allelujah it did not help the Believers it weakened Hallelujah the Believers now verse 40 and they rose up early in the morning and verse verse 9 only a rebel not against the Lord neither very the people of the land for the Earth bread for us so the other said we are just grasshopper Hallelujah and their side the same Hallelujah saying that they saw in the Promised Land but those who are basing with their emotions we are grocery but just when calib who are who were basing the report on the word of God this is they are just bread to us Hallelujah and there depends is departed from them and the Lord Is With Us feared him not but all the congregation bid Stone them with stones and the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel verse 14. and they rose up early in the morning and got up got them up into the top of the mountain saying no we be here and we'll be up unto the place which the Lord had promised for we have sinned and Moses said now wherefore now do we transgress the Commandment of the Lord but it shall not prosper Moses said if you transgress the Commandment of the Lord it will never prosper for the Lord is not among you that ye be smitten before your enemies for the amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you and ye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the Lord because ye are ye turned away from the Lord therefore the Lord will not be with you but they presumed to go up unto the unto the hilltop nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and Moses departed not out of the camp and the amalekite came down and the Canaanites which dwell in in that hill and smooth them and disconfited them even until hormone Allelujah because of their carnality carnality is being at being children weak and their carnality made the people doubt the word of God at its cost Allelujah death to thousands or maybe Millions died in that day he died Hallelujah but thank God we have just one calling we need just one Khalid today Hallelujah then Joshua chapter 5 verse two to five at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time we know that uh our circumcision is not of the flesh it's of the Heart by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah make them uh and and and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time and Joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins and this is the the cause why Joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of Egypt that were males even all the men of War died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt and now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt then they had not circumcised now here is the thing all the men all the mail that came out of Egypt they were circumcised but those that were born in the wilderness they were not circumcised so they need Allelujah before they possessed the land they need circumcision so that's only a type brothers and sisters but maybe you are wondering thinking why did it not circumcise in the wilderness when they were in Egypt they were busy they were working hard Allelujah they were under the other taskmasters and they don't have the prophet they don't have somebody to remind them about the camera of God to their father Abraham and yet they have time to circumcise but when they were in the wilderness they were not busy God was providing all their needs Hallelujah and then why is it that they were not able to circumcise their male child and they have the prophet to remind them Allelujah about the cabinet of God but if you see brothers and sisters leaving Egypt is justification and in the wilderness is sanctification it is not the time it is not the stage of baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is when they crossed Jordan so that's why the message is is very perfect if they you know it will break the pattern if they circumcise one of them in in the wilderness but no one of them were circumcised and we are in the wilderness they were just circumcised after Hallelujah when before the the Hallelujah deposits the land halleluia and circumcision because they are going now to fight a battle and they are they are going to help their Brethren possess the land and they cannot persist the land without being baptized with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah so our baptism of the Holy Ghost is the type of circumcision not influence but in the heart halleluia and you know brothers and sisters make the sharp knives Hallelujah and circumcised the male child the the men you know brothers and sisters when it was your parents Hallelujah who decided to circumcise you it is not your you know it is not your own decision Hallelujah you become circumcised by the decision of your parents but this time it is no longer the decision of your parents it is your own decision whether you have you have to face that that or not Hallelujah that's why brothers and sisters to be a part of that body to be born again it is not because your parents are believers it must be your own decision Hallelujah you have to face that sword hallelujah hallelujah the Surplus place Hallelujah the things the fleshly thing Allelujah it would be your own decision you need to have the same experience as your parents have Hallelujah Joshua chapter 1 verses one to nine now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord speak unto Joshua the son of non Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all these people unto the land which I do give to them unto the children of Israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses for the from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the the Great River the river you protest all the land of the Hittites and unto the great City toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee not any man hallelujah it's enough Hallelujah to believe the word of God [Music] not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of their life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail the inner forsake thee Hallelujah so you have to lead the people you have to help the people hallelujah be strong and about good courage so how how you can how he can help the people is when he is strong and have a good courage For unto these people shout thou divide and inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them Allelujah now the question is how to be strong verse 7 only be those strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to though according to all the law Hallelujah just observe to know according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left hand it means maybe this word is not it seems uh it seems to you that this is not right but you have to obey everyone not to do your own will but to do hallelujah what the word says Hallelujah and that's the time you can help you have you will be successful Hallelujah to help your brethren Hallelujah not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou me is prospered whether so every dog goest this book of the Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou me is observed to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and have a good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with the withersoever down go west Hallelujah and then Joshua chapter 3 verses 1 to 4 says and Joshua rose up early in the morning and they removed from him and came ah to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and lust there before they pass over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when ye say the art of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it there shall be a space between you and it about 2 000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which ye must go for ye have not passed this way Heather for her to fall vinissi the priest bearing bearing the art Hallelujah then you have to pack up and you have to to follow the priests to follow the ark Hallelujah and just don't come near there will be a space of two thousand cubits means three thousand feet don't come near don't overtake Allelujah brothers and sisters who was the leader of that time the leader was Joshua which is the type of the Holy Spirit in our day it was just what the leader but visibly uh the visible that was leading them it was not Joshua it was the ministers those ministers that they put the word of God above their hearts Allelujah don't come near to it Hallelujah and maybe you have you are thinking I have a good idea I got more Revelation than my my pastor Hallelujah although we have the Holy Spirit but God hallelujah give us ministers Hallelujah you have to fight just follow them don't overtake them in the message uh in the in the church age book The programian Church agencies but the hidden Manna was a special Revelation because he had to teach the others he had to teach means to help others see was a little more knowledge of the scripture that he could teach others he's supposed to be is that right you'll never live no higher than your pastor Hallelujah you just remember that see because he's the Shepherd that feeds you if he's if he's the shepherd he's got to know to know where the Manna is to feed the sheep is that right and God will not break his his word and God will not break the pattern Hallelujah that's why Allelujah maybe you will uh you are thinking oh I'm I'm better than my pastor I got the a deeper Revelation than my pastor no brother the the prophet said you will not live higher than your pastor don't come near to it just follow Hallelujah and he will he will lead you into the Promised Land Hallelujah now it's uh this is in chapter Joshua chapter 3 verses 14. and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over Jordan and the priest breaking uh bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and asked the that bird the ark were come unto Jordan and the faith of the priests that bird the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for Jordan overflow with all the banks all the time of harvest that uh the the waters were came down from above he stood and rose up upon and hip very far from the city Adam that is beside zaritan and those that came down toward the Sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed override against Jericho and the prince that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people will were passed clean over Jordan here comes the priests halleluia maybe it was Joshua who commanded them okay praise you go and stand in the midst of Jordan and then the Bible says that the current was strong maybe the priests were thinking how about if I will be drawn Allelujah in that River but brothers and sisters because it is the Commandment to stand there Allelujah they don't care if they will drone Allelujah what they were thinking is there are people that needs to possess the land but brother sisters the good thing is when this started walking into the water and the river was was cut off Hallelujah and Jordan became Allelujah a dry ground and the Bible said Allah all and all Israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over Jordan how many hours you think they were standing Allelujah bearing that Ark you know how heavy that Ark was it was made of wood and then overlaid with gold oh my and then the table of stone were there Alleluia and maybe it's only several kilos but brothers and sisters is standing there until all Israel were able Hallelujah were passed that Jordan and you have to stand there Hallelujah and not moving how many people how many Israelites were at that time I will give you brothers and sisters an idea but uh I am not making Doctrine in this uh particular scripture the prophet said they came out of Egypt 2 million is that right two million of them came out of Egypt Hallelujah you know and then they were in the wilderness 40 years 35 years ago it was only me and my wife and then today Hallelujah we are already 11. we got seven children me and my wife nine plus two granddaughters we are now 11. from though we became 11 in 35 years how many do you think Israel became in 40 years maybe some of you you don't want to have many children because you know clothing food they go to school Hallelujah but you know Israel they do not work they do not care about food God gave them food Hallelujah they do not care about their health there was no fever among them in 40 years so and then they want to to have many soldiers to fight so what's the reason to control and they were not doing anything Hallelujah I will not tell you what's in my mind but how many they were during the time but I believe there were so many Hallelujah although the the two million were killed in the wilderness because of their unbelief God destroyed them in the wilderness Alleluia but you know brothers and sisters while they were crossing and maybe some of them they were having fun you know they are not in a hurry and maybe some of them they are pulling their animals their ship their goats and their cows and brothers and sisters they were happy because they are crossing they have seen Hallelujah maybe their their parents uh told them about how rich he was became a dry ground but now they themselves experience it they were happy Allelujah and maybe some of them were looking on the ministers oh these ministers they are having a nice you know fine linen and while I'm I'm only wearing an ordinary clothes or this he is lucky because you know he is a priest Hallelujah maybe sometimes we say oh he is lucky because because he is a pastor you know he's God is blessing him and you know but the thing that they don't know is under that fine linen nice dress Hallelujah there were knees shaking I had Allelujah sometimes we have to understand those that bear they are does that bear the word Hallelujah and not only the you know you have problems the pastor has already he also got problem you have a family you also got family you have stomach he also got stomach Hallelujah and you have to pray for him support him Hallelujah and love him Hallelujah understand he also his vision is also a human being like you Hallelujah so Revelation 5 10 and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and shall reign on on the Earth Kings and Priests he used this uh this uh this verse and he says Kings and Priests plural every son and daughter of God hallelujah he has made us priests Hallelujah ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house and holy priesthood for what to offer up spiritual sacrifices sacrifices not only the pastor not only the minister but every son and daughter of God he has made us hallelujah Kings and Priests to offer up spiritual sacrifices what is sacrifices sacrifice is like for example sometimes you you don't feel to come to church that is your will but when you say sacrifice it is not when you like it Allelujah but when you do not feel to come that's the time that you have to sacrifice Hallelujah sometimes I cannot bear any more this sister this brother you are the matured one then you have to Hallelujah sacrifice for the weaker one Hallelujah you have to offer up sacrifices Hallelujah may the Lord that blessing may the Lord bless us all and bless his word and anything that I have said that your pastor is not Hallelujah just just forget it God bless you all and I give now back the time to our beloved pastor
