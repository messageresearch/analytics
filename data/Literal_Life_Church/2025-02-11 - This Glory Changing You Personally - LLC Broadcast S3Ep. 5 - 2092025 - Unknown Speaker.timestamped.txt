[6:56] before here we are Lord jus
[7:00] J I'm calling you we need
[7:04] you
[7:08] [Music]
[7:11] Jesus Deuteronomy 30 and verse 11 if you
[7:15] read with
[7:16] me for this commandment which I command
[7:20] thee this
[7:22] day it is not hidden from thee neither
[7:25] is it far off now wonder why he had to
[7:28] say that this commandment and this word
[7:31] that's come from God from Heaven to his
[7:34] people it's not far from you why would
[7:36] he have to say that because people begin
[7:38] to feel like it's a far off it's
[7:41] unreachable how many has ever felt like
[7:43] that I just feel like I'm a I'm aloner
[7:45] and this is the things that's being
[7:47] preached is it's unreachable to me God
[7:49] see how many you ever felt like God is
[7:51] just so far away from
[7:52] me and so this word that he said he's
[7:55] given he said I I want to let you know
[7:58] that it's not hidden it's not hidden and
[8:00] neither is it far off goes on to say it
[8:03] is not in heaven it is not in heaven
[8:06] that thou should us say who shall go up
[8:08] for us to heaven and bring it unto us
[8:11] that we may hear it and do it you don't
[8:13] have to do that who's going to go up to
[8:14] heaven and bring it down because that
[8:16] had already happened here when God sent
[8:18] his word through Moses and brought the
[8:20] word to the people then he says neither
[8:22] is it beyond the sea that thou should us
[8:24] say who shall go over the sea for us and
[8:26] bring it unto us that we may hear it and
[8:30] do it so the theme is is that don't let
[8:33] the devil tell you that it's so far away
[8:36] from you God has brought it close and
[8:39] it's closer to you than you
[8:41] think in other words my theme today God
[8:44] does not want these things to be distant
[8:46] from you he wants to bring it personal
[8:49] to you how close is it verse 14 but the
[8:55] word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth
[8:59] M and in thy heart that's pretty
[9:04] close and if it's not there today then
[9:06] he's letting you know that's where he
[9:08] wants us to be he wants the word to be
[9:11] in your mouth and in your heart it's
[9:13] nigh thee in thy mouth and in thy heart
[9:16] that thou mayest do it I have one more
[9:19] scripture in the New Testament in 2
[9:20] Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 18 but
[9:24] we all with open face beholding as in a
[9:29] GL last the glory of the Lord this also
[9:32] speaks of a pretty close relationship
[9:35] it's not distance it's open face it's
[9:38] face to face can you say Amen we all
[9:41] with open face beholding is in the glass
[9:43] the glory of the Lord what happens are
[9:46] changed into the same image from glory
[9:50] to glory notice it doesn't say a
[9:52] one-time event of being changed one
[9:55] night at an altar but we are constantly
[9:57] changed
[9:59] as we're looking in his face we're
[10:01] constantly changed from glory to glory
[10:05] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[10:08] Lord I believe in change I believe we
[10:11] can keep changing and it's by staying
[10:14] with our face in the face of Jesus
[10:16] Christ people think that they're more
[10:18] connected today because of social
[10:22] media they think that I'm more connected
[10:24] with people than I ever have been in my
[10:27] life because of social media I want to
[10:29] let you know that's not completely a
[10:31] true
[10:32] connection that's not a face-to-face
[10:35] connection and actually culture trains
[10:37] us to be that way that we start to
[10:40] believe that that's a
[10:42] connection and people con are convinced
[10:44] that they're more connected than they've
[10:46] ever been with social media but we're
[10:48] not really connected we're actually less
[10:50] connected than we've ever been
[10:52] relationships are suffering and
[10:54] relationships are going AR because we
[10:56] think that we're connected because we're
[10:58] on our phone connected with the whole
[11:00] world but you're not really
[11:03] connected it's really deceiving us into
[11:06] thinking that we're connected when we're
[11:08] when we're by ourselves we're we're by
[11:09] ourselves with our phone and we we're
[11:12] deceived into thinking that we're we're
[11:14] connected that way uh and and it's it's
[11:17] it's that somehow that we're connected
[11:19] to the cyber world so we're connected
[11:22] and none of it is fa to face so that
[11:24] that can teach us that because we are at
[11:27] church uh sometimes we feel like we're
[11:29] personally corrected connected to Christ
[11:32] just because we're at church doesn't
[11:34] mean we're connected this
[11:36] morning I might say some things that
[11:38] offend you but just give me a chance
[11:40] here and just think about it because I
[11:42] like to talk about what's really real
[11:44] there could be a possibility that you
[11:46] could be in church but not be
[11:52] connected and culture has kind of made
[11:55] us that way to where we we have a slot
[11:57] and we do something it's got to be
[11:58] pretty quick I have a hard time
[12:00] preaching for an hour an hour and a half
[12:02] because we're we we're in a generation
[12:04] of add attention and deficit disorder
[12:06] we've been taught to have everything
[12:08] quick and so we've got it done we've got
[12:09] a certain time for church we got to get
[12:11] going and so it's difficult we see now
[12:13] we're being taught to be that way we're
[12:15] being cultured into that way and as I've
[12:18] said before it doesn't work with the
[12:20] Bible or the scripture because it the
[12:22] Bible says be still and know that I'm
[12:25] God be still and know God how many want
[12:27] to know God this morning you're going to
[12:29] have to learn how to be still to take
[12:31] some time and listen to his
[12:34] voice the Bible says they that wait upon
[12:37] the Lord shall renew their strength
[12:39] anybody want to have new Strength this
[12:40] morning well it doesn't come quick we
[12:42] have to wait upon the Lord so all this
[12:45] culture that we get is completely
[12:47] contrary with connecting with this
[12:51] Christ I think ought to tell the truth
[12:53] about it because we all fall under this
[12:55] uh cultural wave that we're in so we
[12:58] just because we're in church doesn't
[13:00] mean we're connected because we have a
[13:02] Bible app on our phone does not mean
[13:04] we're
[13:05] connected that you're connected with
[13:07] your friends from camp on your phone
[13:09] doesn't mean you're
[13:10] connected does not mean you're connected
[13:13] with Christ and and and we we went from
[13:16] you know I was thinking last night we've
[13:18] gone from Deep face- tace conversations
[13:22] spiritual conversation you know when we
[13:25] didn't have our phones before and didn't
[13:26] have all this we went from Deep
[13:29] face-to-face conversations we then we
[13:32] went to texting and then we moved to
[13:35] FaceTime what is that face time it's not
[13:37] really FaceTime we move to FaceTime then
[13:40] we move to
[13:43] chats just chats and everybody everybody
[13:47] notice how we're moving now from
[13:49] something that's lengthy and a
[13:50] meaningful deep conversation I only have
[13:53] time for just a
[13:55] chat go ahead go ahead and be quiet if
[13:57] you want to
[13:59] culture is moving us into this and that
[14:02] wasn't enough you know that's next
[14:07] Snapchat not just a chat but it has to
[14:10] be a Snapchat it has to be quicker
[14:13] because I don't have time I just want to
[14:15] have flash a picture show me what you're
[14:17] doing I'll show you what I'm doing I'm
[14:19] on to the next
[14:20] thing
[14:24] Snapchat in this world there's an attack
[14:28] on time for relationships because
[14:30] relationships take time let's start with
[14:33] our relationship with the Lord
[14:35] relationships take time and we're being
[14:38] robbed of our time for things that
[14:39] really don't matter but what's what's
[14:42] suffering relationship our relationship
[14:44] with the Lord is we're not connecting
[14:46] with the Lord like we
[14:47] should we're not connecting with our
[14:49] children like we should we're not
[14:51] connecting with our families we don't
[14:53] have to do it and and and it comes as I
[14:55] said to to a Snapchat these these them
[14:58] these names that they give stuff really
[15:00] say something sometimes and we don't
[15:02] pick up on it but it's it's really
[15:04] saying where we're going can you imagine
[15:06] a Snapchat my wife H me up this week
[15:09] with it I was begging her please don't
[15:11] don't put that on my phone but some of
[15:13] the family pictures come up on there and
[15:15] I've had it for a week and I'm when I
[15:16] get home today I'm asking her to take it
[15:18] off I'm sick and tired of
[15:20] it it's not how I want to function cuz I
[15:23] feel this
[15:24] nervousness already these alerts coming
[15:28] every few minutes just from my family I
[15:30] won't let anybody else on
[15:32] there just from just about what do we
[15:35] have t 10 family members now I don't
[15:37] know what it is and it's just like bang
[15:39] bang bang bang please honey please take
[15:41] it off of my phone I can't keep up with
[15:44] my
[15:45] taex so I stepping back I'm not being
[15:48] critical if you have that you're still a
[15:52] Christian Maybe
[15:59] but but listen you know we can laugh
[16:01] about it but we have to be Discerning
[16:03] Christians we can't just swallow all
[16:06] this like the rest of the world does
[16:08] right because their relationships are
[16:10] hurting we have the Lord to call on for
[16:12] relationships but their relationships
[16:14] are really the highest divorce rate we
[16:16] ever had people with all kinds of abuse
[16:18] all kinds of things there's no
[16:20] connection whatsoever fathers to
[16:22] children and marriages and all these
[16:24] other things and you're going to tell me
[16:26] that that doesn't have uh that doesn't
[16:28] have a association with it that somehow
[16:31] it's teaching us that the relationship I
[16:33] don't have the time to put into it I'm
[16:36] on to the next
[16:38] thing don't tell me it's not related it
[16:41] is related and we need to be Discerning
[16:43] Christians can you say Amen in this
[16:45] world there's an attack on time for
[16:47] relationship and the same people who are
[16:50] incredibly connected to the whole world
[16:52] on their phone are the same ones
[16:55] sometimes saying they've never been more
[16:57] lonely
[16:59] oh tell the truth brother Paul the same
[17:03] ones that say they're more connected
[17:05] than they've ever been are experiencing
[17:08] loneliness and some of them
[17:12] depression now how can you be connected
[17:15] with everybody around the world and have
[17:19] that well some other reasons for
[17:20] depressions come but I can tell you
[17:22] sometimes they scientifically is
[17:24] associated with social media more
[17:27] depressed people than we've ever had
[17:29] but they say they're connected it's
[17:31] because it's not a true
[17:34] connection and I wonder if all of this
[17:38] makes us very shallow people instead of
[17:44] the deep people we should be I can
[17:46] guarantee you Christ is not wanting a
[17:48] Snapchat chat relationship with you
[17:51] every now and then a quick prayer hey
[17:54] bro help me
[17:56] out I'm in need of help in this
[17:58] situation
[17:59] God does not want a Snapchat response
[18:02] from you God's wanting relationship with
[18:05] you God's wanting time with you can you
[18:08] say
[18:09] Amen lel' haris sang a song years ago
[18:13] and I've always been moved by the
[18:15] lyric he said in the verse there he was
[18:18] just waiting in our old familiar place
[18:22] an empty spot beside him where once I
[18:24] used to wait to be filled with strength
[18:26] and wisdom for the battles of the day I
[18:29] would have passed him by again if I
[18:31] didn't hear him say and the course goes
[18:33] I miss my time with you those moments
[18:36] together I need to be with you each day
[18:39] and it hurts me when you say you're too
[18:42] busy busy trying to serve
[18:46] me busy trying to serve the
[18:49] Lord but how can you serve me the Lord
[18:52] says when your spirit's empty there's a
[18:55] longing in my heart wanting more than
[18:58] just part of you it's true God says I
[19:01] miss my time with you second verse says
[19:05] what will I have to offer how can I
[19:07] truly care my efforts have no meaning
[19:10] when your presence isn't there that's
[19:13] right but you'll provide the power if I
[19:16] take time to pray I'll stay right here
[19:19] beside you and you'll never have to say
[19:22] I miss my time with you those moments
[19:26] together I need to be with you each day
[19:29] and it hurts me when you say you're too
[19:32] busy busy trying to serve me my heart is
[19:36] longing for more than just a part of you
[19:38] it's true God says I miss my time with
[19:43] you I just wish I could continue on in
[19:45] this because this is where we're
[19:48] at God has called us to the deepest
[19:51] relationship you know I refer to a term
[19:53] called the third poll and if you don't
[19:55] understand that on the broadcast or here
[19:56] today when I return when I refer to the
[19:59] third poll of Jesus ministry which is
[20:02] repeated again in the last days God had
[20:04] different levels and Jesus had different
[20:06] levels of a his ministry number one was
[20:09] a first part and it was healing last
[20:12] Sunday the brother John he brought it up
[20:14] and showed us that we are a three-part
[20:16] being and so the first poll dealt with
[20:18] physically in other words we're a body
[20:20] we're a spirit we're a soul the second
[20:22] part was our spirit and that was the
[20:24] second pole that was discernment Jesus
[20:26] healed the sick and then he discerned
[20:28] the thoughts and the intents of the
[20:31] heart but there was a third part it's
[20:33] the deepest place that Christ could go
[20:37] that third pole that third area it takes
[20:40] us deeper into a personal you know what
[20:42] the third pole is it's a personal it's a
[20:44] personal relationship with him it's a
[20:47] personal experience with the
[20:48] supernatural God and it's not just the
[20:51] one time at the altar
[20:54] event it's a constant change from glory
[20:56] to glory that's
[20:59] as we're close to him face to face how
[21:01] many this morning want a face to-face
[21:03] relationship with Christ how many would
[21:06] like to exit some of these things that
[21:08] we're so bought into that's making us
[21:10] everything has to be quick and and puff
[21:12] potatoes and quick this and fast food
[21:15] and going in and out we've got to
[21:16] realize listen this is doing damage to
[21:19] the way we look at God and the way we
[21:21] look at relationships how many wants a
[21:24] FaceTime relationship with God a real
[21:27] FaceTime and not a Snapchat I don't want
[21:29] to have just a Snapchat every morning
[21:32] with my Lord I want to take my Bible I
[21:34] want to look to the word I say Lord this
[21:36] is more important than anything else in
[21:38] my life you may not have time in the
[21:40] morning with your job but there has to
[21:42] be time that you not only spend with him
[21:46] but you have time to communicate with
[21:48] him and he has time to communicate with
[21:51] you every day through the
[21:57] day David said said blessed be the name
[22:00] of the Lord who daily Loth us with his
[22:03] benefits Jesus said give us this day our
[22:07] daily bread this isn't in every camp
[22:10] meeting you go back and get the Holy
[22:12] Ghost again every camp meeting you go
[22:14] through the prayer line again this is
[22:15] something more eternal than that it's
[22:18] something more consistent than that this
[22:20] isn't giving us this Daily Bread every
[22:22] year at camp or every Sunday at church
[22:24] give us this day our daily bread let me
[22:27] communicate with with him daily can you
[22:29] say Amen because the glory of God is
[22:32] wanting to change you personally and he
[22:36] gave unto Moses when he had made an end
[22:38] of communing with him on Mount Si two
[22:41] tables of testimony tables of stone
[22:43] written with the Finger of God verse
[22:45] chapter 32 and when the people saw that
[22:47] Moses delayed to come down out of the
[22:49] mountain the people gathered themselves
[22:50] together unto Aaron I'm going to read
[22:51] real quickly because I want to read a
[22:53] lot of this they gathered Aaron and said
[22:55] unto him up make us Gods which shall go
[22:57] before us for with as for this Moses the
[23:00] man that brought us up out of the land
[23:01] of Egypt we what not what has become of
[23:03] him and Aaron said unto them break off
[23:05] the Golden Earrings which are in the
[23:06] ears of your wives of your sons and your
[23:08] daughters and bring them unto me and all
[23:10] the people break off the Golden Earrings
[23:12] and that were in their ears and brought
[23:13] them an A and and he received them at
[23:15] their hand and fashioned it with a
[23:16] Graven tool having it then mol uh made
[23:19] into a molten calf and they said these
[23:21] be thy Gods o Israel which brought thee
[23:23] out of the land of Egypt and when Aaron
[23:25] saw it he built an altar before it and
[23:28] Aaron made Proclamation and said
[23:30] tomorrow is a feast to the Lord I want
[23:32] everybody to notice it was God that
[23:34] chose a prophet to bring them out of
[23:35] Egypt and here the people said nah we
[23:38] don't need a prophet we'll come up off
[23:40] our own way here's the gods that brought
[23:42] us out of Egypt they rose up early in
[23:45] the morning and offered burn offerings
[23:46] and brought peace offerings and the
[23:48] people sat down to eat and to drink and
[23:50] Rose up to play it become a
[23:53] heathenistic sexual perversion even yeah
[23:58] amen
[23:59] I tell you you leave the word of God you
[24:01] open yourself to all kinds of spirits
[24:04] you serve other Idols you leave this
[24:07] word you leave the stability of a good
[24:10] church preaching the balance of the word
[24:12] of God you open your family to all kinds
[24:14] of
[24:16] spirits you'll serve other gods and the
[24:19] Lord said unto Moses go get thee down
[24:21] for thy people which thou broughtest out
[24:23] of the land of Egypt they have corrupted
[24:25] themselves they have turned aside
[24:26] quickly out of the way which I commanded
[24:28] them they have made them a molten calf
[24:29] and have worshiped it and have
[24:31] sacrificed there unto and said these be
[24:33] thy Gods oh Israel which have brought
[24:34] thee out of the land of Egypt and the
[24:36] Lord said unto Moses he's still in the
[24:37] mountain I have seen this people and the
[24:39] Lord said unto Moses Moses up there and
[24:41] God said I have seen this people and
[24:43] behold it is a stiff necked people now
[24:46] friends the point I'm making is that
[24:48] this glorious event that God himself is
[24:51] going to descend in a mountain and bring
[24:54] his word to the
[24:57] people but that's not the end he's got a
[25:00] people to deal with that are stiff
[25:04] necked so the message isn't over until
[25:08] he deals with our
[25:10] stick stiff nakedness so this glory is
[25:14] going to have to go deeper than just
[25:16] having the
[25:19] tablets because the people's hearts
[25:21] aren't in a condition
[25:23] yet that glory in the word in the the
[25:27] opening of the word has to become
[25:30] personal to the people to deal with
[25:34] their
[25:35] hearts stiff necked Moses they're stiff
[25:37] necked which is means they're they're
[25:39] rebellious and they dig their heels in
[25:42] and I imagine if you think of a stick
[25:44] neck person they're not moving at all
[25:46] this is what God described as his people
[25:49] and the condition now therefore verse 10
[25:51] let me alone that my wrath wrath May Wax
[25:54] Hot against them this is God speaking
[25:56] and that I might consume them and I will
[25:57] make of the a great nation he says I'll
[25:59] just destroy all of them this how angry
[26:03] God got I'll destroy all of them and
[26:05] I'll start over again that's God
[26:09] speaking and Moses besought the Lord his
[26:12] God and said Lord why do thy wrath Wax
[26:15] Hot
[26:16] against thy
[26:18] people Moses being a type of Christ had
[26:21] to remind
[26:24] God but this is your people
[26:29] which thou Hast brought forth out of the
[26:31] land of Egypt with great power and with
[26:33] Mighty hand wherefore should the
[26:34] Egyptians speak and say for Mischief did
[26:36] he bring them out to slay them in the
[26:38] mountains to consume them from the face
[26:39] of the Earth turn from thy Fierce wrath
[26:41] and repent of this evil against thy
[26:43] people remember Abraham Isaac and Israel
[26:46] thy servants to whom thou swearest by
[26:48] thine own self Moses reminding God of
[26:50] all this history and said unto them I
[26:53] will multiply your seeds Lord remember
[26:55] your promise I will multiply your seed
[26:57] as the stars of heaven and all this land
[26:59] that I have spoken of I I will give unto
[27:01] your seed and they shall inherit it
[27:03] forever and the Lord repented of the
[27:06] evil which he thought to do unto his
[27:11] people and why did the Lord have to
[27:13] repent of this thought of evil to
[27:16] destroy his people cuz Mo Moses said
[27:19] this is your
[27:22] people I don't want to remind you this
[27:24] morning listen if you're a child of God
[27:27] then you can come under the judgments of
[27:29] God there's no way for God to completely
[27:32] send you to hell if you're a born again
[27:34] believer God may get even angry with you
[27:38] but you are his
[27:40] people you're his son you're his
[27:43] daughter and in this case Moses had to
[27:47] say but Lord look what the world's going
[27:49] to say I want to remind you this is your
[27:53] people and I don't care how much stiff
[27:56] necked they are I don't care how much
[27:57] their heart would wander away from you
