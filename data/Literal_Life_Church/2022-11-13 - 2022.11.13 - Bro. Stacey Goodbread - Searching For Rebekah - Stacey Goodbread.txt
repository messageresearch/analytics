========================================

don't want my mind we want his mind the only way he can get his mind is God just jumps in there and does the rest right we're not here theological teaching or or some great big scholar stuff but uh thank goodness because you'd miss me miss on that one here but it's this is the 24th chapter verses 58 I want to read that scripture there real quickly then you'll pray and they called Rebecca and and said unto her we'll go with this man and she said and I thought the greatest thing that she could ever say in all that she had experiences she made a decision and she's I will go amen that's a great the three words that I guess is amazing that I think we all make those same words in different ways but we all made the decision now I will go amen and I think that's the greatest thing she did in this whole experience that she had she made that final Choice I'll go with you Lord I think that's a major thing it's by our hearts Lord Jesus we are grateful to be here this morning that you have invited us here Lord and we ask you Lord to have your way as we approach the word of God tonight today Lord this morning you got to have people here and we ask you Lord to take control take control of the word take control of your people take control of the anointing of God in this place this morning that you'll bring the light upon the hearts of your Believers Lord we're living in the light of the hour it's Lord is a tremendous thing the world might not understand the power of the light of the word and how it affects every person that comes in contact with it Lord but I pray you will help us to understand this wonderful anointing you've given to us we ask you in our lord to bless your word and Bless the people Lord bless and give us the right words to say and that we step aside that you can have your way Lord and bless this little building in the church here in with the Paul in the ministry Lord you've just given so many blessings to so many around the message around the world that you've blessed you've given him the ministry to reach out to our young people and do the great works that needs to be done I pray now your blessing for that work and all that's here to push forward that effort and we ask it now in Jesus name amen you can be seated praise the Lord amen how many would like to be Rebecca amen I I think we can say I believe be honest and I got in my notes I said this is the hour of Rebecca because we can look at all the women outside the church I said we can look at the bottom of the women in the Bible we can see you know go and find out we can find out you know we look at Mary for instance and she had her day and her calling and and she met an angel and she believed the word didn't she and she believed the promise and through that came Christ and then you know and then she that was her Duty and that was her hour and that was what God called her but something anointed her to believe you know I think it's a very important thing to don't ignore the anointing that we've received and it's a great calling because it does things we're not if it was just tradition or just maybe I would think just intellectual teaching and just knowledge of the word and knowledge of a Bible and coming to church and singing great songs and we would be just as like we would probably be shortcoming because there's greater greater ones can sing better and greater preachers than us and in a way of theology Theology and so on they would have missed the calling but thank goodness it's not on those things but I believe this whole experience that we have experienced it kind of doesn't come from these things it comes from the anointing of the holy ghost that comes in this hour to receive to bring forth and look for a bride I believe here uh we find out there was a God was looking for a bride I see we can find out also we talked about a little bit before I have over we see that in the days of we have Rebecca here but we also have a Sarah you know that Sarah in the Bible Sarah was a tremendous woman wasn't she you know if we turn the Bible real quickly there I want to read about Sarah now and we're going to go back to Rebecca as we can just get a little Foundation here over in the uh Genesis the 17th chapter maybe we can go there and we'll just move forward a little bit but you know Sarah was a unique person Abraham was a unique person and but they you know come from Abraham come from a family of of just idolaters and nothing special there but there was something special in him and we all that was said and all that done that didn't hinder what God had in store for Abraham there was still something down on the inside amongst all the mess that God had to get out and bring forth and manifest so he called him Abraham and he called Sarah and they begin to move and God given you know there had to be a promise take place but I want to believe one thing and I think that God does not sit not on some great platform somewhere letting his work move itself I believe God's in every movement I believe God's in every single uh I every single step of the way that God is orchestrating these things because there's no way we could make it happen it had to be God bringing and forth the order and making things a move in its way we will be here you know I never planned on being a Christian in my whole life I was wasn't saved as a young boy I was saved as a man in the in in the military I was I was raised not very religious I didn't raise in a message I didn't know anything about God much she said I know I went to a Church of God and that's all I had I went there just because I had to go there it wasn't nothing that I really found there but you know what I I I didn't know inside there's something you couldn't figure out but through the years you forget those things and the world grabs you and I wasn't a good fella but I found God or God found me I know the one meeting there is that when when the Bible says no making come to me except the father draw him first well I know that's the fact because I never looked for God Adam Eve never sought God God sought them when they was when they fell they hid themselves because that's the nature of man we always hide we always try to avoid the problem I wish I'd avoid the confrontation always want to get away and maybe we can we can just push the problem under the rug but God doesn't allow that especially for us but Adam and Eve when you find out they found and God looked for them and he found them and we can feed the Bible all through the scripture it's the same exactly same circumstance and none of us here isn't any difference God found you you know because he was looking for you you know this is your hour you know we can look in the past look at all the ages right we know the history but God look for those Believers in those ages found them place them and they become the bride for that hour in that age we can find them all the way up through the the growth of the bride and to the point that here we are today and you know so I know that how it is that God can find somebody and and change things in almost a moment you know when I was in the world I was in the military and I was a a rascal you don't want you would never want anybody around me you know that's how we were in the world most of you probably been there but I was there and God found me and that and and that place it wasn't a good place God found me but I'm gonna tell you where God found me I was in a bar when God found me sounds weird doesn't it but I was in a bar drinking when God found me I was sitting there like I always done military people I was by myself that day sitting at the bar I could look at it like it was right now it's been 30 some I guess the 1980s he found me right there I was sitting there I never much looked for God never cared about God but I knew there was a god but I never liked to be witness to me because I knew I said I'm going to hell leave me alone that was my attitude at a Baptist girl one time always witnessed him I said leave me alone I'm going to hell and that's where I'm going to go so don't mess with me no more that was my attitude believe me that you would think don't get this guy to church but that's what but then I found out I was in a bar and then I was there and I'm going to say my testimony because I think I need to and I was in that bar drinking like normal and then I felt something in there the music was playing I had a drink in my hand I can know exactly I can see it right now something strange happened I felt something were reaching to me and pulled something out there was a hand coming up bar and I was believe me I'm a I'm a rascal I said what just happened I can I knew something just ripped out of my heart I said man what was that and I I couldn't and I just I looked around the music was playing something happened but I said you know what it must be me so I started drinking and I drink more and I drink more and I was trying to silence that bothered something that I couldn't now get away from and I stayed that way for months and months and months and I would fight it and I would fight it and I didn't know what was happening things were changing in my life and I still didn't understand it I still did the same thing you know I always say that when God deals with somebody it's not going to overnight things sometimes when people come into churches not overnight things sometimes you know we have a lot of people come to their church and they're not maybe on our level I would guess that sounds kind of self-righteous but they're not in the thing do you think they should be in and they come and they they come with what they have that's all they got but to say you don't know where they're at you don't know where God because God is on God is getting with him on that moment in that time on their schedule on his schedule with them not on your schedule I can imagine if people would saw me and that wasn't it wasn't a message there was a this guy he's definitely a serpent seed you know because definitely our government I had the good characteristic of it but it wasn't me but I for you for months and all of a sudden I said I'm gonna go home on vacation and I went home on vacation and uh my sister was going to church in a Church of God of Prophecy and here I am still bothered still bothered couldn't figure it out went to my old friends and the old bars back home and they look at me says what's wrong with you I said I don't know what's wrong with me it was bothering me it it aggravated me I didn't like it but something was bothering me and everybody saw it and I felt it and I couldn't get away from it but I went to church one morning because my sister was going to church and I would stay in their house and I said I'll just be respectful and I'll go to church didn't want to go but I wouldn't the Church of God of Prophecy here's a denomination you know that and I went there and I don't know what the man said don't nobody I don't know the ceremony and I don't think you know I don't think really had no difference I think God wanted to get me still just long enough and I was sitting there all of a sudden I the altar call was made and I really felt pulled in to go to the Altar and I went to the altar now you have Pentecostals there everybody's trying to teach speaking in tongues and laying on the and I didn't know about that didn't care about it I just knelt down on my knees as Lord Jesus coming to my heart and forgive my sins and be my savior at that moment that same hand that was in the bar came back this time he didn't take it he placed something different that hand wreaked on that flat on that poop on that on that altering and stuck into me that missing part that was I couldn't figure it out and I said that's exactly what it was and there's where God got a hold of me there's where God saved me and then I stayed in the denomination for several years and the founding there was something more problem with me something got to be more and something got to be more and then I found that what God is doing it was the light of God just shining down on me bringing me greater into a greater place you know and then I then I found what God was doing now and it was like that's exactly what I was looking for again see God always takes you further and further and further in the light of the word and I believe what I'm saying is it's an anointing that grabs a hold of you there's a there's a there's something that begins to move in a people and God is God's timing in God's searching and God looking we know the story of the ego it was it was the Holy Ghost type of an eagle searching for to finding who you are and finding God's elect and then the scriptures verify that all through the Bible and I was looking through theirs and seeing how Sarah was called by God and I don't think Sarah looked for God I don't think Abraham looked for what was going on they were there because God was looking for them God found me looked for me found me in the unusual place he found Sarah and Abraham in a situation you know what you know because they didn't know what was taking place but Abraham at that moment he recognized God on the scene Sarah didn't know what was taking place you can look and find out in the Genesis and watch what Genesis says over here with Abraham and Sarah you know he but she began to uh go and find Sarah and one thing you can understand in the Bible in Genesis the 17th chapter or you'll find out here's Abraham and Sarah but watch what takes place you can read it later watch what takes place and I thought was a strange thing that here's Sarah behind the tent and Abraham came with the the the the the angels of God Three Angels We Know Two went to Sodom one stayed with Abraham but that one Angel began to say his main priority and I think God's priority God is praying God's priority today is you are the priority of God Nothing Else Matters to God you are the very priority of God he you're the reason he came You're the Reason God has brung a visitation he needed you and you didn't know you needed him but he needed you and then we found out later that I need him I think a lot of times we don't know what we need until God comes on the scene now I know I need God but I didn't know I needed God but God knew I needed God because God needed me God works on both levels you understand Sarah was there and Sarah was in the tent and we know the history of Sarah she was she was Bare and always has been nothing changed in her life she was just Baron Abraham couldn't have young youngins at all but God had a promise and he sent the promise to them but he said first thing he didn't go look for Abraham at that moment really his attention was where Sarah could you imagine Abraham come to the great angels of God and hear the word he recognized one had to be Jehovah my Lord you visited me and could you imagine you've been Abraham and and you are the husband and you are the very one and he looks to Abraham's word Sarah where is Sarah I I'm the one I'm the Abraham where is Sarah at I think there's a key thing God came and he looked for Sarah Sarah had up something to do in the kingdom of God Sarah God needed her because she through her was going to come up from us where is she at and in her immaturity of course you know immature she laughed when he says you're going to have a baby that's ridiculous you know immaturity we do dumb things but watch as as the promise was given to her anyway she began to grow and begin to mature and now the promise become more relevant more real to her and when she walked in the promise and believed their promise and walked in a promise for so many years that finally it came to pass but he was looking for her God searching out Sarah God searching out his people and it's not leave it there because we found out that God knew Sarah Abraham and we know the the miracle we know how that's the type of the rapture we understand here they were old people old ages 90 years old and stuff and they went to a king and the King fell in love with Grandma or did she or did he I think maybe they had a change something took place not just that but she was restored back what's your restoration not you know remember the restoration is different than a than a Reformation you had reformations right Sarah didn't have her information he didn't just correct it and did a little correction here make her young again it was beyond that but he'd done a restoration He restored her back the way she was before she was barren see He restored her back to the original condition that she could bring forth a promise and I was thinking that seriously we had reformers and reformers and reformers but they all they did was to correct era it'll add a little more here and just move this around and and move that around we had our our Luther and Martin Luther and all and and Wesley and they just corrected a little messed up and just corrected this and but never had a restoration come Sarah brung a restoration God restored her right back to her youth again right back to where she could bear she had no that was never there but he restored that and I believe we're in a restoration now the difference now restoration is to bring it back to the original not just tweak it here I don't know a few my brother that does restoration in cars you know what you have to restore a car I like cars I like a 1967 uh GTO personally can't afford them but they're sure pretty cars he said go look for one I said what I look for he says look for the block of the engine that's the most valuable part of the car if you got the true original block you can restore it back if you don't have the block what good is the car so the value in a real restoration is the power that's on the inside that drives that you can fix the dents and the scratches and all these other things he said that's not word we can fix that but the reality the most valuable is that on the inside and that's what they look for and they restore I think you know God don't care about your scratches and your discs because we come to God all dented all scratched all messed up completely goodness you ain't very good Lookout you have no value at all in you and the world don't see the value because the world don't or the world is not a restorer but God is the restorer and God begins to come on the scene and he looks past your problems you know you think oh my sins are so great I have so many things I don't know that doesn't bother God oh he wants to look down is there's something on the inside that can believe my word and he looks and finds the seed of God and there's the original see you think you see this ain't the original but that is the original that makes this valuable and one day this is going to drop off but the original is what God's looking for because he's bringing a restoration again he's restoring us back to where we come from not to Pentecostal denomination not to not even to the book of Acts our faith isn't restored to a uh we we like to go back to to John and and Peter and all these that's fine but I think our faith goes way back past that because brother Madam also says we have the faith of Abraham that can believe and breathe their promise and to bring that problem stuff that's way back there that believed that when you was unbelievable and so our faith is we have been now restored back to something greater this is a great Reformation Mr restoration beyond all that so God is looking for to restore you back to your Regional with that said there's an anointing that comes behind that so Sarah had that and she brung forth a promise didn't she what'd she bring forth Isaac what a wonderful promise so God needed Sarah to bring the promise right but see it wasn't finished Isaac's born but he's got to grow up and then another woman comes on a scene called Rebecca and the Book of Rebecca in Genesis 24 we can find something else happen here God now he had a promise he needed a he needed he needed uh Sarah to bring the promise but now God needs a bride for a promise we have Isaac's a promised son but where is his bride so God had to look for a bride for Isaac so we have to find a bride for the promise because he was a promise seed and God has have a bride for a promise see so what does he do he goes and searches for her look in the book of look in the book of uh Genesis you know I just with that always comes to mind with me look at Genesis the uh let's go to Genesis the 24th chapter real quickly and you'll we'll start there a little bit but you know it goes back to my thought a little bit on on what's taken place is don't ignore something so simple well you got your hold your chapter can you hold your Bible there because everything runs together we can see Sarah we can see Rebecca we can see Mary all those things had something in common there was a power behind it there was an anointing behind it something was moving in the background and they were just players in a great play and we are players in a play you know we can we we we God has your you have a position in the play you're a great Orchestra he says you're the you're that that or that makes the music you you bring forth that music in the great symphony symphony our Orchestra you have a conductor you have the one that wrote the song you were in that type of plane right you have a place but look over if you could let's go to I think first John how many believes we're in the light of the hour let's look real quickly can I go something already make it simple people wonder what the message is you ever thought about that it says what do you believe I believe the message well what is the message you ever asked that question what do you mean the message you ever think about that if I'm asking you hey what is the message you would say well uh brother badham and no it's not but the Venom is not the message if you think brother bam is a message or I'm the message or by the Paul's a message then you got your you get so you're off your something's off here but watch what the Bible says and I'm saying that we believe the message is not something new for this day it's always been the same way Through the Ages they've always had the message of God but watch in first John let's read something let's go John 1 first John 1. watch I like when they always go back to the beginning why is it they go back to the beginning that was you from the beginning you know you know John 1 1 also started the same way that which was from the beginning what are they trying to tell us there's something taking place that which was from the beginning which we've heard which was seen in our eyes we looked upon and our hands handled the word of life how can you even handle there's something great there is more than a carnal understanding watch what he says keep further further I've I I've seen it we've handled it for the life was manifesting we've seen it and we bear witness and shown to you and show unto you eternal life what which was with the father and was with manifesting to us so think about it real quickly these are the brothers talking about something they've experienced they've they are handling eternal life life was manifested they had contact and they bear witness and they have handled eternal life can you ever handle eternal life it's more than what just words you're handling eternal life that was their experience they're trying to explain the message watch this is an explanation they're trying to do because you ever they pray tell everybody what do you guys believe well this is what believe that which was from the beginning is what we believe we've seen it we've we feel it we we've handled life they're in a position of tangible handling something eternal have you not had that experience this is nothing new for you watch what he says for the life was manifested we've seen it we bear witness and we show them to you how have you ever shown anybody eternal life I don't know how but I guarantee you we can say I'm shown to you eternal life we've experienced that we've grabbed total life you are Eternal people God is giving you the understanding of what eternity is and you grab the hold of eternal life and if I can show you this but it's difficult watch we've seen it we declared it go back to that which we have seen we've manifested and we've seen it we bear Witness that which we've seen in the declaring to you also we have Fellowship one with the other and the fellowship with his father and with his son Jesus Christ keep on going let's keep on going and these things we say unto thee that your joy may be full keep on going we're going to keep going down for this is what amen amen I'm gonna read this that which was from the beginning which you've heard which we've seen with our eyes and we looked upon and our hands have handled eternal life it's not not a revelation see we can see that by Revelation I've handled eternal life I've seen it I've tasted it I see it by Revelation you do that so you can all you can you can kind of understand you can agree and you can see exactly the same thing they got a hold of or that got a hold of them has got a hold of you that was from the beginning that's what we have heard that we have seen that our eyes have looked Upon Our Hands have handled the word of life has not that been in your experience can you explain that you probably ain't able to explain it because you can just talk about it but it takes something you have to experience that to understand this so it's hard to explain it but they said but this is the message so what is the message you've seen it you've heard it you've tasted it you've handled it this is the message which we heard of him and declaring that God is what light in him is no Darkness at all so what is a message God is light and there's no Darkness the simple thing goes what is that message light don't get complicated when light comes to you real genuine Supernatural experiential light that is the message in every age it's always been the same we make it Complicated by trying to put people in the mix we make it complicated well I believe it's brother Bam's message it never was never has been what brother Madam received was the same light you received what Paul had is the same light that brother Benham had the same light that you have Paul had nothing greater than you he had Faith to believe it and it moved in his life and put him into action brother Madam he was a messenger to come because he had to have a prophet Malachi 4 because the Bible says there had to be a restoration so he sent a prophet and God used a man to bring the word that he could declare light to you the seals were open everything was made mermaid revealed it opened up and now we're in the day the Bible says this is a time in the evening time there shall be light why because Darkness faced it was upon everything gross darkness of people but light had to be brung forth that we could see Who We Are you'll never recognize it you're the bride without God really bringing forth the light of the word to you so that's the message of the hour is that God is light and if he is light there's in your life there is no Darkness he reveals the hidden things that's what light does the seals are open the hidden things we feel because the light was there so what is a message simple and that's that's a good answer God's light how do you mean well the Bible says the light of the world brings forth the word and God is light and we've walked in that light if we walk in that light what does it say read that for the verses 6. no darkness and we say and do you have fellowship with him and walk in darkness you lie and the other truth so you cannot say well yes I believe it and still walk in the dark on that not under the revealed word oh I uh you can you can see that a mile away I've seen people come and play the guitar and run around but it's something you can't put your finger on it he said you can impersonate you want to you can't really bring that verse seven here's the key but if you walk in the light as he is in the light you got to stay with the word can't go in front of him he can't go behind him you got to stay right in time right in a step and you're walking in the in in the the movement of God we have Fellowship one with the other and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanse us from all sin aren't you glad there's a covering now there's an umbrella protection that the Believers are under because you're walking in the light of the word there's an anointing on you that believes and walks and trusts and has faith in it now real quickly let's go to uh just rather quick over to uh let me go here real quickly get a little bit further if you don't mind uh first John 2 and verses uh 20 another thought he goes right there too he says first John 2 24. let that therefore abide in you what which was that that abide in you which ye have what are you go back to the beginning and heard from the beginning from the beginning you've heard something from the beginning something speaks forth from the beginning something begin you that which we advise and use that which we have heard they hadn't experienced they've heard something something grabbed them it changed them and they caught a word that comes from the eternities and brings them and shows them there is a you've heard that which was from the beginning that which spoke into Heavens that's which created all things that voice had come down from heaven said let there be light and there was light that's what you've heard and that which we heard from the beginning which which that which we have heard from the beginning shall remain in you so now the what you've heard has to stay in you it's got to remain in you what is that the voice that speaks to you that which was from the beginning that presence that God must remain in you and if he he says remember so also you continue in the Sun and in the father don't forget verse 25. and this is the promise that there hath given to us even eternal life now they understand eternal life a little bit more how many here understands eternal life more I never knew an eternal life then unless you don't teach it that way they don't teach the fact that you had to be in the beginning to be eternal they never taught that because God is eternal he never began he never ends you can't get eternal life at the altar denominations believe that they put a the time frame well you just received the eternal life what a big lie that is what a big deception that is that a church give it to you no you you just recognize you had eternal life when you come to God and he reveals himself to you and he you now has heard something grabbed you changed you and you oh had the same experience I had but a different form a different way is that all right it says here verse 20 first but the promises made that eternal life These Things are Written unto you concerning them that seduce you but watch 27 but the anointing in which you have received of him abides in you so what was abiding let that was from the beginning abide in you but it's an anointing now so there's an anointing that abides in you which come from the beginning which we know what that anointing is it's a light that leads you and guide you and reveals things to you because the light is a revealer and God is light you can't separate God from light from anointing from much which for heard from the beginning it all comes together as God manifests himself in the lives of Believers and he brings his own anointing upon you and he believes you and you seem like you just I don't know do I just believe you ever heard that uh coming out of denomination if you've never been there it's something you understand that you says wow I've never heard that before but I believe it and the general overseer says well you can't believe that that's not what the church teaches I said I don't know about that and I stood in the office and he called me every name in the book I said I'll tell you what my brother I'll pray for you he said don't you pray for me I pray for people people don't pray for me you watch that devil rise up a little bit so we excommunicated me but that's okay I wanted to get out anyway amen something going on God got a hold of me revealed to me what God was doing in my life I think what you have what this does is not really reveal much more than I would say it's the most important thing about this that he abides in you and he teaches you you must have him and it's between you and him he comes searching for a bride that would have that characteristic of believing and trusting to be a bride he don't search for anyone God's very picky he wants a wife that's going to believe him and accept him and everything right he says so what is the anointing we understand the anointing of course it's the Holy Ghost we make the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues and things like that there that's that's your gifts of the Holy Ghost but we want the person the person brings forth the effects of the life of believer it's the person in you that had that you now receive the same Revelation that the prophet received or you're just nothing but a bird a parrot you recruit your quotes good you quote better and I quote you know every paragraph every page every scripture in the Bible you're just a parent with a good memory without the Holy Ghost there's no salvation without a complete salvation without the Holy Ghost you can be saved and Sanctified but the Holy Ghost puts you in service with Jesus Christ put you in a place that he can have a relationship with you that's the anointing that you've received not to put you in a church and to keep you there but an anointing that's going to bring a maturity in the bride that's what it's doing Sarah matured the all matured they come to a place now here's Rebecca and what is he doing he's sending out a message to find his bride so we understand this or are we okay with the light there amen is that okay because I think it's important what a thing it is to know what light is amen because it's it's a good thing to understand really what we're under it's beyond us Beyond any man it's an anointing we received now Brooke go back to Genesis the 24th chapter watch what Sarah here she is now Rebecca I mean coming to the point and she begins now here's Abraham old now of well-stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things I'm sorry I'm gonna go to uh Rebecca here yep here we go and Abraham said unto his Elder servant to the house rule over that I had put I pray thee thy hands under thy thigh and I will make thee swear by the Lord God of heaven and God of the earth that thou should take a wife unto the son of a Daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell that shall not do that God's very picky of where he gets his people amen unbelief won't fit in God's God's picking he don't want someone that's dragged through this and still had their hearts elsewhere you're not ready for a marriage that way how would you marry a wife that has a boyfriend over here and you have I love you but yeah I like him too you can't marry that she has a several complete relationship with that and come right to you so you're all You're My All In All you're the only one you're the one I love because God don't do that to you God don't flirt with denomination I like them too but like you too more so but I like them God severely they rejected him many years ago and if you reject God God don't hang around rejection do you leave him alone He Goes Forth he'll find his wife throughout the ages but the wife will always be loyal to him he will he knows your heart you want to marry a wife make sure he says no boyfriends on Facebook you know I always say when you get married wipe out your sisters wipe out those old boyfriends if you want to keep it wipe it our brothers wipe out your girlfriends you shouldn't have anymore said well I'm just keeping in touch you don't need to keep in touch with the old things well they're nice no they're not no that's fine leave them alone cut it short because that's a devil that will work in the background to get you talking to him and he's hey I just thought he was on my mind yeah that's the devil trying to interfere and disrupt your wedding and just watch your bad relationship or your marriage you got to be careful the devil is out to destroy you that's why pastors we very careful who we counseling what we counseled I don't take a single woman in my office and close the door I don't say well let me sit there and talk to you me and you by myself don't do it you know why the devil will use that and maybe nothing's there but somebody might walk by and have a bad report on you and my job as a medic on the fire department I never treat a young woman by myself I won't allow the devil to interfere one accusation your life is ruined you got to protect yourself you gotta you gotta get away from anything that appears to be evil the Bible says because you have you are the bride keep your keep your skirts spotless and don't get caught up with the things of the world so here's Rebecca Rebecca was a person God chose her because she was that nature she had a character but what do you do he goes and sends forth his servant and watch very quickly on the uh versus uh five and the servant said that servant said unto him here's Elias you're talking to Abraham pure venture the woman will not well the woman will not follow the willing to follow me until the land must I bring thy son again unto the land which thou cameth and Abram says unto him beware doubt that thou shalt bring not thy my son hither again the Lord of Heaven which took me from the father's house and from the land of the kindreds and spaked and which spake unto me and this and that swore unto me saying unto thy seed I will give this land he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shall take a wife unto my son so Abraham you know he always think about your past experiences I like that he goes back we know he took me from this he took me from here he took me from my kindreds he came from all the unbelief the same God that did that gave me a promise here I think it's good to go back and put markers in your life we have monuments of Victories around the world around the nation you know we ran a great battle here we got a a marker of a great battle won by the you know Civil War battles the union won a battle here this Confederates won a battle here and they put monuments because they've they've made a conquering battle and they laid a stake down there that you can remember John Joshua crossed the river and he put a monument there to remind the people what God done on Jordan he says pass some Stones there that your children will know and your children shall remember what God did you know why because God wants you to remember how you overcome how God LED you through you know why it's not for mainly it's not for God as much as for you because you'll need those markers you'll need them because one day you're going through a hard time and you said like oh God I'm lost I don't know what to do I feel horrible I feel like a sinner but join the cloud you know the devil doesn't put that thing on everybody who are you look at your past you how in the world God save someone like you but then you go back and you say oh God but then you begin to think but God did this God found me in a bar God did this in my life God led me from this point into that point and to that point that's the god that is the same message as ever and if he did that for me praise God he'll do it again so Abraham he uses past markers to give him the faith to say if God did it then don't you worry Elisa he'll do this this time he had no doubt in what God said because God already proved to him who he was now you need that type of faith not in what God did for me but what God's done for you and what God is doing for you every time you have a victory remember that every time God's help you overcome will it be smoking or drinking when you're coming to the out of the world or be whatever it may be or any bad habit Mark that in your life and remember that day that God gave you Victory you'll need that one day now you never see a monument up for a loss we lost the battle here we'll put a big statue up don't do that you don't find that only the victories so make sure you put the victories there you don't got to put well I found back said don't leave that Monument there that don't want that you want God's Victory monuments in your life and then he'll take those monuments and you'll use those monuments for God to give you strength and faith that he never he's always the same and he said that he began to that's the truth but watch what he says he says uh and if a woman he said and if the woman will not so he's going back well Abraham what if she won't come God will send it but but now Abraham God willing what if she doesn't want to come see Ellie he's just just a man trying to do a job and you know he's got a task he's got to do he's got to go find a wife or Isaac that's Abraham's son what a challenge into a city that he's never been probably I don't know but he goes there blindly what is he going to do now we can type elegia with this day there's a Rebecca that needs to be found and what is God doing he's got to send forth a messenger to bring a message to find his bride watch what he says here if the woman will not willing to follow me then thou shall so he says he Abraham gave this if the woman will not be willing to follow thee thou shall be clear with an oath only bring not thy son hither so he gave another Assurance if you have Oath but Abraham was not even worried he knew good and well she would follow he said and the servant put his hand upon the thigh of Abraham master and swore by him concerning the medal and the servant took ten camels and I'll go past that all that and he came to the chemist to kneel down the city of the well and the time of the evening even the time the woman goes out to draw but watch what he does he wants something to happen Lord I don't know what did you say here next verse 11 verse 12. watch what he says here it's evening time is it he said Lord say oh Lord please thy good Master pray that you send good speed this day and show me kindness to my father Abraham my master verse 13. watch what he says behold I stand Here by the will of water and the daughters of men of the City come out to draw water keep on going and let that come to pass at the damn store whom I shall let down the picture I pray thee that I may they may that I may drink and she say drink and I'll give the camel's drink also and let the same be she that thou has appointed for their servant Isaac therefore shall I know that thou has sent kindness to my master so here he gave a a a a duty for God Lord let this happen he gave a fleece before God let this happen Lord let me let this come to pass and watch what she did and you understand what happened we see and she come to the place and now here she comes and he she did exactly what he asked her to do gave him drink gave this camel's drink verse 15 and it come to pass before they had done speaking that the Rebecca came out from both of Bethel and Son of Mika Monica and the wife of nehor Abraham's brother and her picture upon her shoulder what an experience that was as soon as he said that here she come you think God doesn't rearrange things he arranges different situations it was already arranged you don't think that she was I mean I don't think she knew what was happening I don't think Elysia had the Assurance but God had both moving at the same time he had Elijah there and he had Rebecca there Rebecca was on the same wavelength as God and Elisha was on the same wave as God together they come together but they never knew exactly they was doing what they was doing you never knew you was coming to God when you went to church and got saved God just placed you the right place at the right time and the Holy Ghost was there and he found you he convicted you and you came to the altar dimple you can come to the Altar and dry out confession the prophet said and you'll be nothing but a sinner when you come and a sinner when you leave but let God call you and you'll leave a saint because when God calls when God does it it doesn't do in vain it's impossible for God to fail in your life it's impossible God can never fail your experience you might think you're failing but remember there's a greater anointing than you think you have God is moving on your behalf everything is moving because God has orchestrated your life completely you're not here by chance you're predestined that means he knew you away from the beginning he knew you were here so it's not as coincident that you're here at this hour this day this age because he's prepared you for that day that's why I'm saying we're prepared for this hour you look at the world you look at thought of my condition you look at the world of transgender and that mess out there oh you shouldn't say that I'll say what I want to say it's a devil anointing our children and the parents are under demon are anointing to have their children under that Spirit of anointing and if they come together and and stand against it maybe there'll be a change but I don't think so because we have to come to sodomites and the world in a sodomite condition ungodliness Even in our own government homosexual and men dressed like women and they're part of the health department and part of this department how disgraceful of a nation that said under God We Trust but that's the way it's got to be there's an anointing on the people to do what they do but watch now she come that way and here she comes God worked on her side and brung her right to the angel she did exactly what she did she come there and she gave the water she gave the camel water she gave him water and here which God was doing he found the wife for whom he found the wife four the promise who's that the you know who's the promise is Christ is always a promise and he looks for a bride and what are you to do you're the one that God come to find let me read something here if you're okay you are with me amen let me read something from I think my things are going let me find something here you love him what's here now oh did Rebecca say I'll go God praise God that's what we want to do now is the is the hour now is a time of decision we know it's Rebecca and Isaac being blood blations but now but but now they're typing Israel natural seed but by faith Christ come on the scene which is not by Nature not by natural he didn't come that way he come a supernatural bride now did you know that that uh when Rebecca came that guess what happened something else came before her this is important watch this quote you never probably knew this maybe you did it was an even time when he commented the well near the city and all and it was all about the time Rebecca had to make a decision it was in the evening time when he come to the well near the city it was about the time that Rebecca had to make a decision I believe listen this I believe that the Lord beat Elijah or him there about a half hour for he will send his angels before you and make a way clear it must have been about the angel that God spoke to Rebecca's heart and says go to the water you see so but that says an angel God because the Bible says those tennis Angels before to prepare the way so the angel came and got to Rebecca the prophecy about a half hour before Elise you're gonna see him so he prepared a heart before even the messenger came and he got her ready because he she was going to receive something but he got her heart ready to receive it you think that God didn't send an angel before you when you heard this message and prepare your heart oh yes he did you didn't believe it out of your own natural way you didn't believe it because your denomination taught you to believe an angel got to you and something how he prepared your heart to receive that message he said oh God what did it the angel got to you got your heart ready and you received the word like Rebecca did because Rebecca is a type of you this is Rebecca's hour this is the hour of Rebecca this is the hour of the Bride because we are the wife of the promise you're the wife of the promise you're the one that gives the promise a wife that he can he can bring forth his life through and he's and she left with Eliza and took her journey all the way there what happened when she got to the tent she dropped everything he was surprised everything else where was Eliezer at he was off the scene it was in his job his job was to bring and find it and leave her at the steps of the promise and God and the believer is now moving in direction to receive the promise and prepare her it wasn't that she received the teaching no forget that it's beyond teaching because I can teach you a lot of good things that don't mean anything but elieza taught her of the character and the nature you know can you imagine let me tell you about Isaac he's a man of character and begin to talk to her about who he is and all the great things in the nature and characteristics that he has and so that's what drawed her his nature his character it wasn't some story or some Doctrine we teach because I can teach you Doctrine and Doctrine induction but if you don't know the character of Christ and you know don't you don't go for that you just become an intellectual a message a message Theologian because you've never found we want to find the character that's the attraction see the brother says what attracts God to the people what attracts God to you you're attracting you attract God by believing this word that's what attracts God that's what the Bible says that's what he says you attract God has attracted to you because you keep his word sure so you ready to keep his word that's attraction that God has oh she's wonderful she'll keep every word I have faith in her her heart single with me she don't know no other one but me oh I'm glory to God what's God doing now taking a bride bringing to a place bring into a position Oh Glory to God what is he doing bringing her to that place watch I said surely the word of God the same character that is that in there that you dealt with would be in the same Basics that would be on my question this was the brother man said this I like this he had a question Lord let me find a character in the Bible that represents what God is doing right now and watch what he said oh surely there's something in the word of God from Genesis to Revelation that some character in there that you dealt with would be the same basis that would be my question that's the question he had if someone done something you got after him about let him turn to the place in the Bible if someone whatever it is done it'll lean my way well I've done wrong I've done something you want to do you haven't done let's see the character in The Bible like that and I close my eyes just let the Bible Bible fall open put my finger on the scripture so he went there looking for a character that would describe what's taken place maybe in his ministry as well and the bride and Genesis 24 7 came to him Elijah Abraham Stay full servant the model servant of the Bible sending being sent to hunt the bride for Isaac oh children over me surely that's that's right with the rest of the message pulling out a bride Oh Glory see the prophet recognizes that the message of Elijah was a message to go and pull out a bride the angel got to her before everything was set in place oh don't think this message is some type of Hocus Pocus stuff God is bringing a reality in God's people and I want to make sure amen that God is bringing forth and you know when God brung a message and he brings and and he's looking for a bride there's an anointing that releases out because there's the angel coming so when you know you're in the hour there's anointing been released and what does that anointing do goes and finds and looks and looks it's the Holy Ghost anointing bringing you into a position and God is going to meet the challenge and you're going to meet that challenge of the hour that's the anointing we received right there what's anointing we received that's anointing that God has anointed you to receive all that God has for you in this hour I believe we're in that hour right now how many believe that I believe we're in a time that God is bringing forth all these wonderful things we're in an hour now that's so great that we can barely contain the Revelation is coming down in your hearts it's a truth we're we're bringing forth the word the word revealing to you remember this is not our message this is not the prophet's message this is God's message to Eliezer and we get to the point we think we put names and titles on what God is doing don't forget you're the equation God came to get you you're the bride I'm the bride it's not me and brother Paul and this one you are the elect God's bride you're the one he's coming for you're the one that he sends down the anointing to grab a hold of this message that's doing their job and it's not anything come by a man brother Batman had to clear that up he says this what you received it's it's I am not the son of man just that's not me don't confuse the prophet with something greater than he is don't don't make his ministry a shame he's I was only there when he come and he come to reveal himself I'm just one standing there when he does it as his ministry of a prophet to come to to bring forth the word to you but remember it's always on that side that God doesn't revealing the pressure Prosper can't reveal nothing to you he can't save you he can't redeem you he can't bring Revelation to you all we can do is bring the word bring the message and bring what God the scriptures and the God goes out and does the rest you know these things but I think we're an hour now that we have a great challenge you have your home your life your spiritual walk your families your children all this in at weighed out Upon Our Lives and with that you've got to understand there's some there's a way that God has planned that you have to be faithful keep God first keep your family first keep your desires with God and then but yet don't be a fanatic but the man says the worst thing that happened to Martin Luther you know the biggest problem is wasn't a Catholic Church he said it was a fanaticism that followed his message that was a hardship Luther had to deal with so let's not make this wonderful Gospel of Jesus Christ The Gospel is not preaching the word it's it's not just preaching the gospel is the life of the word being revealed to the people the gospel come to save you the gospel found you it's the anointing of the Gospel by the holy ghost that finds and captures you and bring it back and you can say what Paul says I have been apprehended of that I have been apprehended by the word of God he said not that I've apprehended or I have called but has apprehended me and there's a key see let the word apprehend you put you in prison of love that nothing else matters let that which you want to apprehend get you and you got and if it's got you you'll get what God has for you amen you love him I believe it I believe God's doing now is a great move that we got to understand and don't ever think that you're you and don't get it get common don't let this message become just a common thing like God is on the move and it's a great hour look at what's taking place what an hour we're living in now that we can we can be a participant of what God is doing and God is bringing the bride to perfection not in your way his way near his way don't don't get ahead of God's program just let your faith stand let God do the perfecting let God do the dressing let God do the work in your life and don't get too fast and too quick because your time is God's timing all right God's timing should be your timing don't get worked up and just distracted and and depressed because you don't feel like you're growing strong enough just believe God have faith in God and let God bring the increase see God's a farmer God's a tiller God's the one that nurtures God's the one that cultivates a Believer so let God do it just lay in the presence of the Sun and let the sun bake out all the greenness of you don't get ahead of God just stay on courts just ride on this Glory ride on this word let that word take you home that's what that's the vision that he had when he's up that Creek jump on the log and ride it to the camp and that's what we got to do right write the message write the word all the way to Glory don't worry about anything else just believe God you know because the reason you believe God because God dealing with you the reason you're hunger and thirst because God's revealing things to you if you didn't have hunger and thirst that means God's not messing with you but because you do want more and you feel God I just need more that's because God's got more for you that's true that's why he says he says why would a what comes first the water the fin the fish had to have water before it could swim in so he put a fan on a fish's back because water was there to be swimming he put a hunger in your heart because there's something God wants to give you so why do you hunger and thirst church he said because God's trying to reveal things to you so while you're hungry and as you're thirsting just enjoy the blessings because just believe in what God reveal his Mysteries and reveal and you'll know that what day you're living in you'll come and recognize on a closing I'm gonna read this quote if I can real quickly what God has done just what God is now showing you he's bringing you to a place he is bringing you to a place that he's bringing the revealing let God do it I couldn't find it you see here amen and we'll just close out real quickly on this what God is doing I think what now we're in an hour we have to let God take us home let God take his will be faithful with him and let God do exactly what he wants to do amen bringing the bride to that place amen can we stand real quickly and I'm going to close out I just want to make sure and I'm excited because I can see these types coming together you know I've never seen so much scripture and so much prophecy made manifest in the last four or five six years of my life never we don't know what day it is that's not our job I don't put times and days and hours that's ridiculous I just want to know when that happens I'll be ready it might be 30 years maybe five minutes plan like it's going to be whatever plant your Fields go make your house go buy your church go do these things don't worry about that God has timing your timing should be God's time that means you just keep going as God has planned for you to go and don't worry don't get closed down and go crazy just believe what God is bringing you to amen amen let's see here there we go here we go he says uh amen well God I have that here I want to read that before we close out we can do a musician's coming up I guess I don't know that's why I call them up but I think you've let me come I'm just glad that God can bring us to a place now that God is bringing us into position that he can work through the bride amen they will all find it a little bit but I'm glad God's a great architect how about you I'm glad he is amen hearing about Hearts now and I was asked God to have his way how many believe that you're a Rebecca I hope so God has sent an elegia to find you that Holy Ghost goes and reaches out and searches every part of the world of pioneer and somehow he says Lord I believe amongst all the controversy of all the unbelief all the problems that you have to go through to believe you believed anyway the church is really coming to understand what's taking place now he says this the church is beginning to understand the message to hear the message and to understand it better friends I listen you got to lay in the presence of the sun we got to be ripened our faith isn't ripened intellectually we're hearing a message of God has given to us seeing the signs that he's shown to us proven by the Bible is there but oh how the church needs to lay in their presence until it's tindered up you know the great sweet in the spirit so that it can bathe down something that speaks to the message something that speaks the message you heard and you get harshened have to break in and that because you've got to clinch it like a nail to hold it sometimes it needs to be preached hard it can clinch right but when the church once gets it the elect is called out and separated then the presence of God I know it'll be something like that people was there when it takes a Rapture so God says you are now coming to the recognize and understand what God is doing I think we're understanding now we went to a lot of different and we've been through a lot of brother Paul we've been through a lot of changes through the message haven't we we've been in this position and we have the theologians we have the time where it was quoting and quoting and quoting then we come to this time and it's amazing how we've come to those those little things and here we are and God is bringing that bride to a greater maturity than we're very imagined and you are the great you're in such a mature state right now you might not understand yourself but that don't make a difference what God sees is important you'll never see yourself there I don't think because you'll if you see yourself perfect you'll quit I think we just you know your God always want to keep your thirsting and trying and reaching and reaching for more if you stop reaching you'll die if you stop drinking your thirst to death you'll die it's natural death and spiritual death you don't hunger and thirst he keeps you hungry he keeps you thirsting he keeps you fed he keeps you going because if you don't you'll die and when it's time for you Perfection he'll make the Rapture and he'll take you out of here until then we're all growing together how many believe you're growing but we're going together you know why there's not going to be an individual Rapture it's going to be a full Rapture so somehow God puts it all together and will all go up in a moment we're going to go how I don't know but that means we all got to be ready at the same time I don't know how he's going to do that but Paul I don't know how he's going to do that but I know he will because the word said he would in a moment in a twinkling of eye she's gone that means everybody had to be in their position in their place and now if we look at ourselves I don't know if I'm going to make it you'll make it be have faith in the word if you don't think you're going to make it get to the doctor make sure you're going to make it but the bride knows who she is Rebecca has an anointing to recognize her position Lord Jesus we glorify your name we thank you for your word or we glorify you now and thank you for all you've given to us Lord let us begin to just focus and and meditate upon Lord what you have done in our lives bringing us to a maturity bringing the word to reality let the word strike us Lord every day let us believe and follow every step Lord that you can send a messenger to come Elijah to strike and find the bride Lord Jesus and here we are responded seems like a supernatural response it is because the Holy Ghost a supernatural God that knows the language of the Bride speaks to the heart of the people in our own language that we can understand what the world might not understand Lord I believe you have a language of the Bride that you speak to us in a supernatural experience a revelation is a a language that you give us the rest of the world will understand this language but Lord you have given us that that Supernatural Supernatural intelligence that that language to us becomes so real and we can hear you speak to us and we can see your word come into reality it's because you speak the language of the Bride Lord God that we have and it's the same language Lord you've always spoke Through the Bible Through the Ages the same Believers with the same language the same anointing believe in the same gospel bring the bride to the same position ready for a Rapture in Grace Lord I praise your name and we glorify you now Lord we give the people to you you'll move on the hearts of our families our homes dear God you'll help us to be better parents help us our children be better Believers Lord there's always more room for improvement in our walk Lord I want to be a better husband I want to be a better father I want to be a better provider I want to be a better exam simple to my children my home my wife and I'm sure Lord Jesus's sisters has the same desire she wants to be a better mother she wants to be a better wife or a husband dear God a better example Lord if we can have the spirit of Christ in our home if we can just laid everything to the altar if we can just love one another let the word bring that love in our homes let our children let our children feel that let them see God operating in our homes as young little fellas they need to see Mom and Daddy they need to see the prophet said don't take your children to a Sunday School you bring them this Sunday School it's not Sunday school that does it but mom and dad must bring them with them there's the example of the Prophet said take them there let them see God in you because that's all the god they know right now is a God and Mom and Daddy Lord Jesus help us to be always the parents that grow with our children Lord will grow every year as they get older we've never been the parent every year we knew parents for a new age help us to be wise on how we are with our children what to say as they grow older we grow older Lord help us to be just bring forth an example that they can see that there's a real God Mom and Daddy has shown to me that God is real I don't care what the world does the bible Lord you said if you raise the children in the right way Lord it'll never depart to always remember how that God you led moms and dads and examples to show that God is in flesh living his life to the people that they can see a working God a working family a home has committed to you oh what a great platform a great Pulpit at the home that the children see all the time not just church on Sunday though Lord these needs more than that he needs God in the home help us as parents to be that for your our family Lord to raise them in the way they should go because when they get older we don't know what's going to happen but we know they'll never it will never depart them we can have confidence that wears them right way they'll go in that direction so Lord we have a seed to plant we have an example to be as we grow and mature let us be example to them and those around us bless your people today guide them and keep them in your hands Lord watch over them in Jesus name amen hallelujah glory to God Amen you love him I hope it wasn't confusing to you sometimes I talk fast and I gotta slow down and I'm very fast speaker I got interpreters that says Slow Down slow downs and they're pretty good but I says okay I have the slop and but you know I hope you understood I didn't get more here today but I'll be God's the same okay God's the same yesterday forever I think we're just one great bride across the world wanting the same thing God Have Your Way in our lives so God bless you and thank you for bearing with me for this hour or so and thank you for putting up with me and inviting me and and bringing that anointing that I can enjoy the spirit of Christ in the place here and a good people and music and love and worship it's always good to have to come to a place that you haven't got to pull and push and wear you out you know a bridge getting wore out when you're dead but when you're alive you draw that gift amen and thank you for that it's enjoyable for
