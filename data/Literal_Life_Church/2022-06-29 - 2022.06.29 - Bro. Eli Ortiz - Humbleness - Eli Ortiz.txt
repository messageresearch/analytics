========================================

it is a pleasure and always a honor to be in the house of the Lord be with Believers of the same believe in the same thing the same message the same Bible the same God same spirit so it's always good to be among believers and tonight uh us brother was saying uh you guys worked very hard last week and you might be still a little tired I didn't work that hard but I did a little work so but I'm older so I'm tired but I'm more than tired because I'm retired that's being tired twice you only been tired once you don't know what it is to retire twice you find out one of these days yeah because my grandchildren they sure give me the wrong for my money or their money I don't know they tired me out quickly those those guys said I don't know where they get so much energy anyway so it's it's a joy to be here and we have fun last week and again uh it is always a pleasure and an honor to be I'm on your guys today you know I feel at home so that says a lot so I'm comfortable and I'm not I'm an at ease so that comes for something because I've been around and not every place you go you you feel welcome but I thank you for you lovely uh his church with us and thank you for your for everything you have done for us since we've been here and uh from the church in Tucson love divine we bring your greetings from the pastor on the church and uh may God will bless you richly for all your efforts not only within the body but also what you do in the mission in the mission field because I know you guys are busy doing this work and as long as we're here we will work for the Lord amen let's let's read from Philippians chapter 2. uh let's read verse 5 and 8 it's on the screen if you don't it says bless this mind be in you so what he's saying how the same attitude have the same mindset think the way he thought that is also in Christ Jesus that we being in the form of God who being in the form of God thought is that robbery to be equal with God being God you know the logos God empty himself in him the logos that was God's form God forming himself in the creation that was the first thing that was created the logo God created himself in the creation and he took a form called the logos but later on we know who the logos was and then he becomes a man and he says sorry not Rory so even that he was God equal with God he never took advantage for it and you and I we need to learn that you know whatever position we are called we don't take advantage of our positions in all our gifts because it is God that provides everything it is God against everything he said he didn't take advantage of being who he was but made himself alone reputation I looked at the word reputation he says make boy make of non-effect I like this one too empty to make empty to make void deprive underbain useless a non-effect so see he came and he couldn't have a reputation but he emptied himself and I like that word because the more you empty yourself the more you can have of him but the problem is not me it's not the person not the church you are your worst enemy and we're going to see that the more you empty yourself the more he can feel you and the more he can feel you we're going to see what the effects of the result of that will be tonight he says and he took the form of a servant he left his Royal clothes he left his stroll and he became what a servant see he didn't take advantage he didn't want everybody to worship him or maybe wanted to do for him but I'm God so you know I require this he requires a lot of stuff but he don't force anybody and was made in the likeness of man it will come a body Jesus the body so let us pray father we thank you once again for this opportunity that we have to to look at your word we ask you to to give us what we have need father tonight you know we what is in our heart and you know what it takes father I don't know but you do know father so I'm I'm gonna do my best to stay out of the way keep my thoughts my side here my opinions I don't want them but I want yours tonight I want the man of Christ father to be displayed but we thank you again for your goodness your your your what you do what you're doing and you will do for us father tonight and you are done we love you and we thank you bless this congregation the pastors and why father and those the deacons those who are that are in offices father trustees father we we love you and we ask you that you racely will bless them in Jesus name we ask you these things amen and amen so you can be seated so verse 8 says and being found in a fashion as a man he humble himself that's what I wanted to get to because the preaching the title is humbleness I don't know I'm not too good with titles but we have to put one so I chose that one so if you feel a lot it doesn't matter it is the content doesn't matter so and being found a fashionable man he humble himself and became obedient not only he humble he said but he became obedient or to what or to death even the death of the cross so I believe that we are he is our example tonight and if he came and that was at least his main you know qualities or characteristic or character we cannot do we less than that now remember he was he humbled himself he was obedient all the way to the cross and that's you and I we have the same Journey there's no different Journey if God is the same just say today and forever he's doing the same in you that he did with in Christ can be no different so we need to Humble ourselves we need to be obedient unto death I mean this guy had to die when we are here the only time we are here we are dead physically or or spiritually but we had to die to ourselves die to our desires and that takes obedience but obedience is produced by humbleness that's my title then so the humble you are you're going to find out that more obedient you will be and the more you become like him because the more you die out the more humble you get and the more obedient you get process in Roman 9 13 4 if you live after the flesh you shall die so the flesh has to die there is no good thing in this flesh see but if you through the spirit mortify or kill the disease of the body you want you shall live and we know that Jesus came and he didn't do nothing on his own he had a mind he could think he could do things he had opinions in fact he had a will but he decided to empty himself out of all he thought all his you know whatever he thought he was right or wrong to just to do the will of the father see so whatever he saw the father doing that's what he done so that's why I'm saying he empty himself he empty his mind see just to do the will of God and it's no different tonight that's what we have to do if we want to be out of here because this body you know it's not going to inherit eternal life we know that this condemned is going down what he came from to the ground but there's something in you that's leaving and he has to eternal life brother Banner says he never lasting life he says obedience is better than sacrifice because some people think because I don't give him my tithing because I come into church because I'm doing this because I'm doing that I must be home you know humble and obedience well no that's not what it means it means that you're doing a lot of things it's not a lot of things that make you humble it's not a lot of things that make you you know faithful it's not that's righteousness and that is our righteousness that's not his righteousness the time that we put our eyes on what we do that's righteousness and my righteousness would not get him anywhere another one my righteousness I want his righteousness so he said obedience better than sacrifice do what the holy spirit says do what we need tonight is to let loose of all our little old squishy you know that's probably Kentucky on the squeezy ideas I never heard that one and let the Holy Spirit you are taught here you know what is right and what is wrong so what he's saying you're not ignorant and if you do what you're doing and because you ignorant because you got the holy ghost that will rebuke your will you know convict you that's not right that's not wrong there's no excuse do what the Holy Ghost tell you to do because Satan is going to tempt you I know that he's going to put ideas and he's going to tempt you with things but we have a choice you know the choice is to do his will see and let the Holy Spirit you are thought here that's what the ministry is for that's what your pastor is for that's why when you come to church to teach you what's right and wrong so when you go out there you have something I mean if you don't know right or wrong like a little child you know he don't know evil he don't know bad good or indifferent so they do whatever they do because they don't know but we'd like to train them you know because they're going to stay that way forever we train our children in the way they should go so when they get older that we know what depart so the same thing with us we come to church the pastor is just chopping away you know creating a masterpiece you know God is through your pastor in the ministry is chipping away that God don't like he's making a masterpiece and a chip away and a chip away and so what he desires we come out but this flesh had to be out of the way so when the the Holy Spirit convict you on in the services do it don't make excuses you know let's do what the Holy Ghost because that is what is called the sermon that's why we come to church to know what's right or wrong so we have this sermon when we are there by ourselves that Satan likes to see you by yourself because it's easier to attack one person that the whole congregation here you feel good because he's not here see because we have rebuking but he's still waiting outside the doors and he touched to take advantage of his situation so the more humble we become the more obedience you become because you're humble into the word of God to the will of God and the more you humble to the will the more obedience you come and through that obedience them come faith faith is the most I mean uh faith is a demonstration of your humbleness and your obedience see because faith is all actions see faith without action is dead so the more you walk in Humble is the more you obey the more your faith will increase because you're going to be doing the will of God see it was no it was no uh fight between the flesh it's always a struggle but Jesus knew what to do so you and I the same thing you know he tempted he was tempted by the devil but he knew use a word and you and I that's what we do we come to learn so we can rebuke that Satan and use the right word see but we know that faith without love is is nothing so let's not get out of balance where you know I'm humble and I'm obedience and I got faith well then you have to love because faith without love means nothing Paul says I can move mountains I can do this I can do that but without love we are nothing so I'm glad that God put checks and balances in the world you know if I'm humble then I had to also have love and if I'm obedient I had to have faith so you start examining yourself this is in my life it's not let's go to God examine my life and let's develop let God bring that that is in you it might cost you you might have to suffer for it because God is going to test you you know but that's its way but that is his love to you it's not that his mother you want to destroy you that is love to you when he let you go through all those things he's trying to bring something out of you and the quicker we humble to him to his hand the better we will be but the Bible says in Humble thyself I was talking to a man the other day he was just organizing a church up pull out of our organization that they did and a clear word brother both and that church where they had the greatest Church there for so long and then the Lord was was blessing then the people got to the place that they wanted to polish up you know become a denomination like the rest of them and then they throw into organization and what they did they just throw see and then he said humble Christians either is there did not all their life had been taught against it so they walk away from it so you what you are taught is very important you cannot live the heart when you are taught by your pastor and your pastor is teaching you how to be humble but the Bible says that's now they they they have it says humble Christians in their dinner or their life had been thought against it and that's one of the problems we have in our churches we get a lot of people all the time but they've been trained by all the churches you know I'm not saying that they're bad or indifferent I'm saying they've been trained different than you've been trained so they come to church and then we have to retrain them and then in the meantime we have to be you know patient with them because they have been trained sometimes wrong how to get the Holy Ghost everybody got ideas on how to get their Holy Ghost that's just one way to get the Holy Ghost see but people have been trained in different ways so homeboy says humble Christians said they did not all their life had been taught against it so they walk away from it now they have got a group and the Lord has blessed them until they are coming in up into a big place now again with a church now that puts up about four or five thousand people see what homeowners will do to humble yourself you know not have anything against government and gifts and be complaining but just to follow the leader the ministry and they are studying all over so we sit right here that Jesus taught us in this verses that we read that we need to submit to the father uh we also need to be humbling like he was humble unto death the really you got two choices tonight Jesus had two choices you can choose between being humble or being humbled Jesus knew that he had a choice he went to the Cross he said father can we have some other way to that I had to go to the Cross this cup will pass away me he he was human and he had choice but what he chose he said nevertheless let's do your will because if you're a Christian fill with the Holy Ghost and God has called you and failed you and you are sailed listen either you humble or you will be my humble and I don't want to be humble by force my desire is to humble myself because he wants me to be humble I want to be humble I don't want to be pressure I don't want to be pushed into being something I want I want to desire my heart to be that way like Jesus was so that's the only two choices you have if you're a real Christian you ain't got no way out of this somebody's well let's go the easy way all right let's let's do it oh you're gonna be you know or you call that word in Spanish that's a bad word though in Mexico but they drag you by the legs you know the other one got to drag you you don't want to be under his Wrath you want to be under his law because when he discipline you he will discipline not his children he will do a love and he knows what's best for you so whatever he do I I trust God I have confidence in God I don't care how body looks like see I'm not trying to figure it out and do this and do it because you know what I I do that a lot lately you know if I had to decide before I tell you lately before if I want to decide what part of my life I wanted to live is right now from 25 to 100 if I make it to 100. I don't want the 18 to 25 or 25 to 40 because you know I was a teenager on rebellious and then I have family and I had to find a job and I had a career and I had to bring a family but if I had to decide what part I wanted to live and serve the Lord is this one right now because I'm a little wiser I understand more I know more so for me now I I understand more than I used when I used to be a teenager so As I Grew you know I learned I am very seasoned earlier why but it wasn't something that was handed to me this is what life taught me so I'm more better not to handle things that come to me than what I was a teenager so if I had to live a life this is the one for God I like to live my last 25 years someone I want to live the whole thing but if I want a servant truly and get in there will be my last 25 years if I can make it that far so Christ he says oh I lost my okay Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever only thing he could do now he might do like he did when he was here in Earth because the Bible says he's the same yesterday today and tomorrow so whatever he did yesterday he will do today in you he cannot change that you have to come the same way he came he says it is right is that right and when he was on Earth he did claim he did not claim to to be a great person see because the Way Up Is Down and if you want to be great he will abase you it will degrade you you know when you put people in pedestal don't do that God will bring him down because Jesus never did see he says and and when he was on Earth he did claim he did not claim to be any great person he just preached the gospel he dressed like the other bands went along just like make and humble so most of the time they didn't even know he was in the house because he never put attention to himself or brought attention to himself well I'm here I'm a bishop so and so don't take so and so you know in fact he tried not to be noticed see so just preach the gospel now Hebrew chapter 2 57 8 25 say Christ begin his work what did he do what washing how to Humble lowly how he was not a great northern man as a theologian but he was humble make gentle he wasn't a mighty preacher I'm glad he put that there because I'm not a mighty preacher in fact I don't know how to preach his voice wasn't heard in the street he wasn't blowing trumpets and coming you know he's come he comes out the the the main guy you know without me you are nothing no he humble himself and he did not too you know he just here I am and that's one of the things that we're going to start learning what do we what do we expect or what qualities or character to be humble is you don't bring attention to yourself at least to start with no and God could next one everlasting life he says and God could ever get a man and a woman today in this Tabernacle anywhere else that it will pay no attention to what's going on around them see sometimes we like to compare ourselves with somebody else you know but submit themselves to the Lord as an individual unit he says God will lead with the same man today that he let he let them so what he did yesterday he will do today God will not change the program see God gave us a message and the message is supposed to be the address see you cannot add to the Dress well um heavy here let me like something out or oh I'm too skinny let me put no you might might as well either gain weight or lose weight to feed the Garment but you cannot alter the Garment okay he proved that he he is with us what we need today is humble submitted lives submit yourself don't squeeze yourself back so throw yourself out by saying another place take yourself and throw yourself out don't bring it back this guy is dead don't exclusive back in you that's why he's being empty yourself take that guy and forget him keep him down don't let him rise up so meet yourself don't squeeze yourself back into it don't do nothing but lay it straight with the Holy Ghost with the Holy Spirit what the spirit says do do quickly don't say well I'll wait and find out what this is and that is what the holy spirit says do go and do it see I am in that you know part of my life that I had to learn not just learning easy learning I was I was tested and I went through a lot of things but I know now that when he speak I do because I know what happened when I didn't I tried one time it didn't work good for me so that means you have to be in tune with the Holy Spirit you have to be prayed you have to read every day you have to walk in the spirit you know you had to find him every day you don't have every Sunday every Wednesday this is an everyday walk it's a journey so you cannot just you know forget about him all week and then when you have trouble then find them it's just don't work that way we go from experience to Spirit and from glory to glory and the more you know him the more you experience God the more you can trust them and that takes a lifetime because God is not going to reveal to you everything at one point that's a journey some people like to think you know they have this mentality well they focus on the end result I wanted to get out of here and waiting for a change to our body but what they don't understand is that the process is just as important as a result the journey is just as important as the result because without the journey without the process you don't have no results but some people like to focus to the Future and to the result this is what I'm going to be this is what God is going to do for me but what he's doing right now because if you skip the process you will never make the results and God is trying you God is testing you every day that's part of the process to humble yourself so you can die to yourself we can die to ourselves so we can when we get there you know we know where we're going we know the end result we just have to you know submit ourselves surrender ourselves to God so that can become a reality keep our eyes in the vision Matthew 23 11 12 says but he that is greater among you shall be your your servant so that's part of being humble not equality brother said be humble let yourself be the Lords of all do you want to be the first be the last you want to be the one that know it all make yourself stupid dumb you know sometimes I was thinking I'm afraid in this I got brothers that talk to me you know once a week or whatever I see him and they tell me the same story again they forget that they told me the story and I heard I don't know how many times but when they tell me that I I don't tell them you know how many times you're gonna tell me that story you know oh you know I don't want to make him feel bad I don't want them to you know not intentionally so so I said well I put the face like um maybe I did maybe I know but they tell me the story and I do the same thing I will laugh on the point to laugh I will say hi yeah I'm surprised because it is not about me I want the brother to feel good you know it's all about the other person it's not about me being great that's why brother brother everybody loved brother Branham because brother brother make the person feel better horror of themselves than than brother himself to that point that the other person you know he made him feel like he was somebody he says humble yourself God will feed lift you up don't figure that God owes you anything remember you owe him all in verse 12 of uh Matthew says and whosoever I mean I'm sorry uh Matthew 23 12. and whosoever shall assault in such a beer base see brought down and he died and he that shall humble himself shall be what exalted brother said but we must all come in one way there's no two different door no number one the number two number three no that's just one door and that is the straight and narrow way and we all gonna have to come through that but we must come to one way does come knowing that we are nothing and he is all see I've been willing to surrender ourselves to him in order to receive benefit from him if we think we are something God cannot use you I don't care how effective you are how many skill you have how good you are that kind of used you know you have to just become nothing and if you something is for the grace of God that we are what we are but he gets all the credit he gets all the glory and honor I'm so glad that he chose me but Allah says I have nothing to do with this he shows me and I'm glad he showed me because I wouldn't chose him myself somebody asked me hey what do you want to join us of sobriety or whatever he was or a club or something I said if you knew me you know I wouldn't even choose myself to go into just you know if you knew who I am you would not do that but I'm glad that God made all that good for me he cleansing me he saved me he cleansed me he filled me and that life is gone now I am somebody but I am somebody because him before I was a nobody thinking that I was somebody you know pretending to be somebody oh happy don't tell me you didn't okay put your Halos down don't tell me that you never pretended uh see you guys want to have your first girlfriend you pretended I tell a joke you know I'm gonna tell a joke and I'm supposed to joke in the puppy but when I met my wife you know I picked in there that I was rich I bought him a car you got a down payment for car and all that I was trying to impress her then I thought well you know later on she found out that I didn't have no money so let's leave it there because you don't want to know the rest so it says then when you humble yourself down God will insult you but when you assault yourself God will see that you are brought a base degraded humiliate it be leader demeanor so see I don't want I don't have anything to do that anyway Peter says humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may assault you in due time the image of Christ says do you really mean that say Amen congregation say Amen now it's in that sweet spirit I do not have it that anything I know in the world you can take all the rest of the world and the fancies and the intellectuals all your doctors rabbis Bishop holy fathers Just Give Me Jesus that's right just let me have him that old-fashioned way I feel him way down in my heart and watching my life see he keep track of his life and see my desires is to serve him so if he's another desire tonight not to serve him then let this sum in our life that should be our only concern is to serve him he said meek to serve him humble make a lonely that's what we need friends that's Jesus that's the Jesus of the Bible not the Jesus of the intellect but the Jesus of the Soul if God is in my soul I live like healing you know if they said brother says if you have the spirit over time you do what you do what Beethoven did if you have the the spirit of the cowboy they're in jail whoever cardboard you like you will go to shooting you know robbing banks whatever but if you have the spirit of God in you that's what you do you manifest his life because with the spirit of him lives in us so if our life is not producing that there's something wrong it has to reproduce Christ in us the hope of glory of glorification so if it's not we need to then surrender maybe a little bit more be more sincere try to be more humble so the Bible says sometimes John the Baptist says I had to decrease so he can what increase so the lower you go the heart he will assault you the Lord the the the the Lord you go and you make yourself nothing you will make something see the Way Up Is Down so John says Ah to decrease your flesh actually increase your liking your desire your ideas your opinions you have to let all that God and the whole journey is to do that God is shipping away all that that is not him so him can appear so the more he chips the more you see his glory see and as a minister that's what I'm trying to emphasize tonight the importance of being humble humility is important but also the fact that being humble is a character is a character and it's a character trait and you cannot live via without the right character in fact the only reason you you hear because you're trying to get that character the character of Christ so hombolis is a character trait and if Jesus had to have it from the beginning to the end until death until this thing dies completely physically and spiritually discarded you know and become humble we are not going to live here until the work is done but I'm glad that he promised me I he says he started the work and he was what he will finish it so is that on me or me is to humble myself and let us finish the word that he started on me see Paul at one point he was bunking against the prick you know until God had to say I'm going to just stop the more you do that the more you hurt yourself you're not getting anywhere anyway but did you surrender your life to me then we can work together we can do something but that's one time we find ourselves just walking again the you know the word what we need to do just let go and let God and surrender our life or whatever he said do do yeah and you receive the glory of God God will do for you because God cannot lie if he promised you that he's going to do something and you do something he will do it you need healing just be humble and come to him humble and tell him you know I am nothing I don't know what else to do but you told me you know that you will heal me and he said if you ask you will answer see God will not lie to you I'm gonna when you come to me and you ask I will answer it's not going to be quiet he might you don't mind you maybe don't like his answer but he will answer you it says so I want to quickly let me see what time I have I don't know what's okay quickly I want to give you some qualities or characteristics what a humble Christian is see so you can look at them we're going to use the Bible on the message and see how many you have and how many you lacking I cannot cover them all but I'm gonna give you a a taste of what a humble person would do the first one is they lead to serve or they live to serve see um in Galatians 5 13 are you there says Brethren you have been called into Liberty only use the liberty for an occasion for not for on a not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by law sir one another so serve what one another and don't use the Liberty don't use your position to an advantage well I'm gonna love this guy and this guy because they love me but and then you gotta click now see that's taking the Liberty that you have in God for your honor banished maybe you want to be with this on this one because she got certain you know brother deals that you want to do and you know this one is poor and this one is you know it shouldn't have been that way we should we should treat everybody the same see that's the first train we are here to serve one another serve God and serve the body Galatians 5 14 for all the law is fulfilling one word even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself so if you love your neighbor or thyself who is my neighbor or anybody that cross your path so if you love your neighbor you're going to love your neighbor the way you like to be loved right do you like pain suffering you like people to mistreat you and use you or Force you accuse you but don't do that because you need to love in the way you like to be loved three people the way you like to be treated be kind even if they're not kind to you because you still want them to treat each other way how they're going to know all education you are the teacher you know the truth so love thy neighborhood thyself brother says you know people want Power and really they don't know what power is they really don't know what goes with it see they don't know what they're asking for because power with a character is evil brother Brown said the Way Up Is Down always if you want Power see how humble can you get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and then you got got more power see we want more power you know the power is in the tone the Bible says you know you can do good or bad evil or good because power is in there so the words that you're saying can do a lot of damage you can do a lot of good so when you see each other the Bible say edify one another say the things that are gonna identify somebody else I don't care you don't feel good and then every time they ask me how you doing brother I said I'm doing I'm doing good in fact I'm doing better than you and they start thinking that's what I want them to think I said I'm doing better at 73 that you're doing a 50. when you make it to 72 we can argue that but I will be way up there away from you so I want to see people that are struggling sometimes either the sick or anything and they and I see him in church and I say hi I don't tell him well you sure look bad you should stay home I don't need I don't I don't need you just no I tell him first thing I see him I said wow you look good today and I had done that and I'm making this up and the brother looked at me like wow you're the first one everybody that saw me today he was in the door and there was his way home everybody just looked at him and said go home I said but no you look good and then he kind of got a little energy he kind of and then went into the service he felt better your words carry a lot of power and if you want to edify somebody you know let the spirit lead you you know what you look like had nothing to do with anything your situation had nothing to do with anything that's the problem we look to most other situation we look at uh the body messages you know body languages but see you got the power to change all that in fact you have the power to change the armor fear in this service if you want to you got power in your tongue right now to change the atmosphere that's when you come to church you should praise the Lord and you should worship God because when you change that atmosphere the Bible said that he dwells in the presence of his people so if we come with the right attitude with the right mental attitude with the right mindset you can change this service can fall or can rise depend just to take one person in the wrong mindset worrying about whatever they worry about well I gotta go to Walmart or after Churchill thank you brother because I know some people out there here but their money is in Walmart or they're thinking about the beans that are burning at home you know I hope this bridge will get done because I you know we're going to lunch and we're going to do this with us when Sunday used to come my children never asked me what were you doing number one rule in my home Sunday is for the Lord I mean every day is a robot Sunday I did not schedule anything on Sundays because I didn't want nothing in between me and God I gotta hurry up get out of the Church Road to whatever party or whatever you want to do park or have fun then run back to church no no function the only function that I have was God and that's what they learned my children learn listen I'm not rich I'm not poor neither but I don't have big million dollars to leave my children reaches or properties but one thing I wanted to leave them is the Legacy of a man the leaf of God the love God I want them to see that in my life see you are a God to your children's let me tell you what you can tell him what to do or not to do but they're not watching what you're saying they're watching what you're doing because they don't understand what you're saying but that Washington says but that why are you telling me that you're doing it see because the you are the God and if you're going to preach make sure you line up with the word because it's in vain so always you want Power see get away from worldly things humble yourself in fact when I when I came in the Lord brought me into this message back in 1990 89. uh I lost family I used to get with them together for Christmas and presents and Easter you know I was just you know I was a good Baptist anyway and I used to do all that stuff um birthdays and whatever we celebrate we go to the park when this message came uh they schedule everything on Sundays I don't know why people do Sundays on Saturdays so I told them you know don't invite me and if they do you know I'm not going to go because I already know what I'm going to be a Sundays and I lost a lot of family now last time that they but they didn't bother me anymore and I didn't go anymore because I said you want to do something you want me to go do it on Friday or something but not on Saturday even if a family come from out of town to my house you know if they don't want to come to church I said well you're still here and he's here's this book or whatever watch whatever and I'm going to church no because my God is first family is second and church it's less because if you love family you love family you are family We Are Family amen well let me get off that says God I want you got more power than man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noisy because you have been over the been to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ see you have to conquer I'm not your enemy you need to conquer yourself listen we are here to overcome not overcome the preacher you need to overcome your own flesh and before you try to overcome me why don't you overcome yourself before you want to take that being that is in mind or that stick or whatever in my eye take that being that is in yours see overcome yourself first that's what you're here for because you have it over the conquered yourself and commit yourself to Christ to humble yourself before him that is really power so you want Power tonight you need to been nothing nobody whatever he says to do do you know you know you show my church that is humble and I believe this church is humble that's what I'm bringing this anyway real humble not an arrogant church just a sweet Humble Church and I believe that you made me feel wanted you made me feel like I'm part of the group you know and it makes me then participate and do things I do it's because you made me see it is you making me feel that way see on that church I I will say it all the time you are a very humble church and that's because your pastor because you don't get that well that you get a teaching from it and tell you what to do see because you have been over the to Congress that you show me a church that's humble real humble not arrogant church just a sweet home of church and I will show you a church that has the favor and power of God see that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling yourself before God and letting God just work through you because let me tell you what it's not you it is him working through you that make you who you are to begin with so we surrender to him he will make what he wants of us you know the only place people are there going to see God is in you but the Bible says that's the only place they're going to see it and if they're going to see Jesus again in Earth it has to be the same Jesus yesterday and today and forever Jesus was humble Jesus was slowly he says uh forever but that's right that's the thing it takes humility but it's so hard it's easy to say but I know I'm human I know how that works humbling yourself also before God and letting God just work through us don't have to make a lot of noise you know agree a Christian don't don't let the left know what the right is doing in fact you do things for other people and you don't blow trumpet in fact nobody know who did that to that person because nobody's taking credit oh I did you know what I did no you do things on the quietly nobody knows but if you try to you know do it so people can you know say that you're good and you give him then you die that's not the purpose in fact whatever you do don't let your left hand know what your right hands is doing second to have a reserve they have an inner stream second Corinthians people that are humble they have an inner strength therefore I take pleasure pleasure what's wrong with you Paul I take pleasure in infirmities it says and reproaches are you going to be happy when people mistreat you and kick you and they did all things to this you know to Paul he says in necessities in persecution in distress for Christ's sake for when I am weak he is strong so next time we get to a situation that we look like God there's no way out oh I don't know what God is doing this praise the Lord because the Lord is doing something in your life you know when you are weak it's when you're strong that's the mentality it's not the other way around but how do you feel brother about I don't know I feel bad well good because it's your strength he is just strength so when you're going through things and he led his sickness and the disease and this happened to you if you're a real Christian humble Christian you don't complain about it you said Thank You Lord you know I don't have no strength anyway in fact trying to stand in this Pulpit if it wasn't for his strength I will be probably sitting just like you guys because if I start thinking that I can do something for God that was the end of my the ministry because I had nothing to offer the only thing I had to offer is nothing we come to God offer nothing if you can offer something to God then there's not Christ anymore it's not it's you and Christ and it's not your crisis him only so therefore we know we take pleasure wow every time you have a pain every time you have suffering every time you have a situation you're supposed to rejoice Paul that's what Peter says intestine in in in everything rejoice sing a song you know why because God is doing something in your life now humble thyself brother Brown says look at Jesus nothing but one bundle or what a love you know what what you do what happened when you take a rose and you squeeze it hmm you kind of smell the fragrance see the more just squeeze it the more the fragrance comes out see and that's what happened to us the more the world squeeze us the more God let squeezing come love should come out see if something has come out you retaliate and you want to get even that's not being humble in fact the more they squeeze God the more he loved the people in the cross yeah dying he said forgive them they don't know what they're doing and he didn't open his mouth I mean some of us we I'm gonna get even I'm Gonna Get You Back you know no humbleness means that you have to suffer let his suffer see that is the only way you can be obedient you know that by his suffering he learned what obedience and I said to myself what did Jesus have to learn obedience is God in flesh but this is what that means you don't have to be a disobedient son to learn obedience in fact you don't have to do something wrong to learn what's right what you have to do do what is right even if you think it's right or wrong doesn't matter Jesus did everything right and he proved that he was obedience see you don't have to experience life so you can become you know like me I have to I experience life I did many things so I can find out that we're wrong not when your parties tell you you're that strong don't do it your obedience and you don't do it and that countless or obedience you know how to experience what people have experienced like me in this message to know how God the love of God or to know how good he is you can do his will all the way be obedience and you will be a bundle of love just wait he said nothing but a bundle of love he was God manifested if God Express himself to us a God is present himself to us no one the Miracles and things happen just humble lies and consequent in life that come from just from being God to be a man you know just to express God through himself that's what made him what he was you get it you just God is praising himself to the flesh say he he what he was always said that may Jesus God to me was the way he humbled himself he was so great and yet became so small so being humble a humble person that is it's not a sign of weakness being a homo person is not a sign of powerless but it's a great Inner Strength that comes from God see because when I'm weak he's strong that's what Paul is saying see three I gotta hurry up here three they admit their mistakes husbands and wife okay you need to learn how to say I'm sorry I'm not talking about somebody else just hold on somewhat sometimes confess your fault one another he didn't say confession confess your fault and pray for one another that you may be healed see the reason sometimes we don't get our healing is because we need to confess because it this is what he's telling me if you confess it's your fault to one another then you can be healed the effects of urban prayer with righteousness we know that one we like to quote that one but we let the other half that if you confess say I don't care if you do it intentionally or you do it because you want to do it if somebody's hurt because something you said it's not what you said it how he got it or how he perceived you said if he's offended that person that was not your intention you need to go make a right because a person that is humble cannot meet the mistakes I made many errors and I'm still making many mistakes but the key on it is to make it right but if I say when you come through those doors make sure your life is right make sure you make everything right make sure that you don't come to the store because he says it will be it will be pouring out it you know why it will come that day brother says that nothing will come through those doors but because it's not here we are not you know you know like Safara you know because we are not there yet and we're not seeing it in church I don't mean that it's not happening one of these days we might we need to make everything right before you come to the stores it's going to be called out how I don't know what is that's what he says so confess your thoughts before you do food washing before you turn the communion you know you need to make this try before you do that because it can be detriment to you instead of Health to you will be death to you that's what Paul said many of you are sleeping dead and sick why because you cannot discern the body so stay healthy just do what's right confess you're forced to one another and God will heal you brother says himself humble thyself I was thinking here one little illustration to back of what I'm saying he said now we look at this watch to find out what time it is unless that uh unless there that every instrument in that was any any part of that what she said it's coordinated one with another we will never know the correct time do you know what time we're leaving you know the times this is the time of redemption this is the time to go but you will never notice it because the only way you can notice that everything has to work like a clock right or you would not know what time it is we never know the correct time is that right and that takes all of us all together and that's what I saw last week you got to work all together if we want to see the purple ready to do something for God coordination with everyone of us together to Humble ourselves before God and confess are wrong and pray and believe God for these things see it's like a watch we all got parts some more some less but do you know what time we are leaving right now you know what's going in your church the only way you know that is when you see everything working together in one Accord in one unit then you see the power of God coming down now you know what's going on and you know where you are and you know what's happening but when they Discord what happens and the the parts of the watch are not working some parts are working so I'm not working you cannot tell what's going on it's confusion and like I said I can pray that this church is not confused you guys were not confused last week because you forgot about yourself and you started working as a union you started working for one another to get things right in fact you forgot everything about yourself that week you can do that at church the same way you do your part you work your part and then you can see the power of God coming down then you know what time you let you you live that's why some of the churches are so confused because everybody's pulling different ways and then the wash is not working time's not working they don't this is doing that she's doing that he's doing that the kids are doing that and people are confused you know well what we supposed to do but when we are in one mentality we want to call it one mindset with the word as his bridge then we know where we are we are not lost we know the presence of God is in this place we know where God is and we know what he's doing see chaos we don't like chaos God cannot move in chaos when everybody wants to do whatever they want that's chaos because everybody wants to pull their own way but what we need to come together humble us off and then bring the power of God down he's promised that he will do it amen he said the circle coordination for every one of us together to Humble ourselves before God says and four uh another characteristic another quality they seek input from others but you know what happened when you think you know it all right that's not being horrible what kind of home about myself because I know so much it's hard to Humble when you think you know it all you don't ask for help when you think you know it all you know ask for for inputs when you think you know oh you know you want to even rebuke or correct the pastor see I know the message and I read see and that's I'm saying I'm not making I know this happens in churches the people that get up and trying to strain out the pastor in fact there's some people that tend to strain the prophet tell him what he meant Oh this is what he meant you know so so what we what we well we are uh Escape so we we get input for mothers there the Bible said here in Proverbs 2 7 but not wise in our own eyes fear the lord and depart from Evil be not wife in their own eyes the person who is wise in his own eyes is rarely so in eyes of other people you see I don't care how who you are in the sense you can describe who you are but if I want to know who you are brother says you're going to know that Pastor look at the wife you want to know about how good is your husband ask her she's the one that knows sometimes you know the bus stop bubbles you know sometimes we way up there and the wife come and yeah we go back down to earth you know we believe to be something that we are not without to be you know and she sat there with her pain big pain and all they had air comes out you know you want to know what a man's belief look at the wife you want to know what a man believed and who he are what he are look at the children look at the family see so let's not be washing our own eyes you know I am interested what people said about me I'm not saying that you know I need people opinions but sometimes when we don't understand that sometimes people look at you and see what you're saying and see what you're doing see and if if you don't line up then something is wrong but the Brown says above all things it is our individual soul that we are responsible before God see it is you if you go there it is not whether I go or he goes it is you go in see you if you first and you have got to look to die and come sweet before the Lord and another is saying don't expect with someone else to start or doing it you need to start in your life well when I say uh all this thing happening in church I will jump in when I see that you know water trouble I jump in no why do you have to wait don't you want to be the first no I just wait to see what's going to happen with that thing then I join but if you don't go right I don't join well what kind of mentality is that we're working together we helping each other so you are responsible for yourself and you are first you have got to look to die and come sweet before the Lord and I have always found out that a man that humble himself is a man that God has drawn when you take a person that just checks out and know everything and you cannot tell him nothing at his arrogance see why that person that never gets anywhere but you take the person that humbles themselves and walk sweet sweetly so by humbling yourself the characteristics of not we I don't know at all I know a lot you know but I don't know at all and if a man tells me that law at all I stay away from him brother says if you find somebody that thinks he knows the Lost stay away from that man because they don't who I mean we just saw a finite our money so how can we know it all God is infinite how can we know everything about God or everything about anything see brother says here five he says they know themselves second Peter 3 18 says they they have a special Revelation who they are and what they are but girl in Grace and in knowledge of Our Lord Savior Jesus Christ to him glory both now and forever now the NIV says for who makes you different from one else First Corinthians 4 7 for who makes you different from one else what do you have to do you did not receive and if you did receive it why do you boast I thought you did not so see everything that we do everything that we come or will be come from God and if we come from God we cannot boast God don't share his glory with no one so if we said we receive it what do we both if we say we didn't receive it you know is is the same way the same thing now next thing is genuine they are genuine says Philippians 2 4 don't look at out only for your own interest for for the interest in others humble people know how to The Importance of Being authentic see you gotta be the same person this is what I'm going to hit here because you have to be the same person that you are in church that you are at home that you are a school if not you're pretending if you a humble person you're a humble person wherever you go to everybody else to that lady in the Walmart that gave you the church chained you or the one that you know did something to you this is not just for believers only this is not for The Clique Jesus did not do that he was kind he loved he has no respect the person whoever they were and we had to do the same thing we had to be the same not all in private all but we had to be the same person when we're in church when we in public or in our personal life in a home uh in every situation and with every kind of person we should be the same if I wish you three people the same way we treat each other if we're not doing that we are pretending to be humble see brother Banner says humble that sir and they come to me and said brother Brandon said we went out there in the office the church office the other day and I said one of the leaders of the class and then said what what more what must we do and he said find a man to be the Shepherd that has no reputation I guess they were looking for pasture said no reputation I'm glad because I will fit that category nobody knows me when I travel a lot and here you are oh I'm Brothers also I never heard of you I said no because I don't have no reputation I've been living under the hotel or brother dog everybody dog brother the dog but I'm behind and I don't bring myself any reputation people don't and I try not to and I will not do it it says it's a find a Shepherd that has no reputation in in all denomination it's just a real good genuine sweet humble brother that live the life God will take care of the rest see a good pastor that just feed the sheep and the home and be humble and then God will do the rest not some big know it all coming and instead put this in order and this has to be this way turning things around I said I will never work or this will never work you just go to that's it first keep peace in the church just work together and you must keep up your part of it so we see what time we are living we may be closer than you think we are see seven quickly they treated they they treat others with respect that's a big one for me you know it doesn't matter who he is you should treat everybody with respect I don't care if it's a three-piece suit or is somebody in the overalls you should treat everybody the same way that's a sign of being humble for there is no respect of person with God and as you would that men should do to you do you also to them likewise see and humble people are consistent and disciplined in their treatment with others we got to be the same if not we are different so but the poetries be the same way and and you should see me the same way and we all should treat ourselves the same way but you don't you don't belong to the church it doesn't matter I belong to the body so you should treat people that are coming from other places even though they are not part of this assembly ask the word your brother and sister and accommodate and be lovely and you guys do you guys do uh with respect it says over here Romans 12 16 B of the same mining towards one another mind not high things but condensed condensed to Men of lost State be not wise in your own concede see live the New Living Translation live in harmony with each other don't be too proud to enjoy the company of Ordinary People and don't think you know at all you know sometimes people used to tell me in churches you know they always invite the same people to to the home to eat or to have parties so you know but always the same people then they complain that they don't have any friends I said well you don't have any friends because you don't show yourself friendly I said why don't you do something this year take this year and start and every Sunday or Wednesday check somebody else that you don't know you know fine and because you said to another family why they're saying people the same why don't you go around until but the end of the year you know who is in the service I know everybody and invite everybody my children used to tell me God you're always picking out this message homeless what are you bringing all these people home because I know how I feel when you go to a church and they ignore you for three or four years they don't even know you there big churches you get lost in big churches and I don't like that uh so everybody that came new to church I will introduce myself I don't care who they were I introduce myself I like to know you a little better would you like to have dinner with me and I used to take him home sometimes I have a home full of all kind of people my children say well you get well you invited every homeless people in church in this message I said yeah because I know how it is see I want to treat everybody the same way I know how it feels it took about three years you know and I went to the Tabernacle when I that was new nobody knew who I was nobody knew where I came from what happened to me just came and sat down and brought my family and I sat there about about three years later on the brother from the pope he says oh we have a family here a new family that's happened here three years not that I need a nourishment it just I took that long you know anyway brother Brown says we want to keep rolling smoothly sweetly in and in order of the Lord so just remember that your part may be the main sprain is talking about the wash again or maybe the the leader part some little hand or some little arm the winding stem whatever is maybe or it may be the hand on the face of the clock that tells the time but wherever you are whether you attack us it take us all working together in harmony with god with the gospel Jesus Christ to bring this to pass you know what why why the Rapture should we do because we have not been able to do this we're still forcing with one another we were divorcing with all the other churches you know we should not do that I mean it's if you go to someone and you say forgive me I did something wrong and the person don't want to forgive you that's not on you you did your part if you want to go to another church you want to base it and you want to see and you want to enjoy and people look at you like you know you got you know lepra or disease or something you know that's on them you know sometime in Tucson that's the only thing now that's the churches and they cannot see each other I see people sisters in Walmart and brothers from another church and as soon as they see me they turn around see they don't want to see me and even in pictures you know nothing and then they said that they are the bride I'm not I'm not criticizing them because that is the teaching from the pulpit I don't blaming the people see I'm blaming the teaching I come from the pulpit says it doesn't matter what part you're about whatever it is it takes all of us to do to together to work at Harmony with the gospel Jesus Christ you know maybe the piano is playing good and he's playing good with this and this one but if you're not entering in and enjoying and praising the Lord then you're not doing your part even it's your party church is to say amen that's your part even if your party just to clap that is your part means your party just to open the door and greet people like they're doing warmer that is your part I don't care housing insignificant the clock will not work without that part you cannot tell the time you'll be lost so it doesn't matter how small or how big just do your part and when all the parts come together then the machine is nice and oily it's working together fine and the pastor is happy you know like I said sometimes you know if Mama is Happy the house is happy see because his mama is not happy I'm not happy and the children are not happy so we try to keep Mama happy see we do what we can do was the part was happy you know the wife is happy and you know everybody's happy you think he says you think if give is so great what we call out as Paul said though I have faith that I can could move mountains and I have no charity now I'm not in think of that until you say well I understand the Bible so I understand the Mysteries see and still go out and to do this and have no charity I am nothing I haven't got no word I haven't got nowhere yet see the maintenance love God and humble yourself number eight I'm almost done yeah eight humble people they understand their limitations because sometimes we like to come to church and we don't want to give an appearance that we that we don't know anything we want to pretend that we know in fact some people come to church so they don't criticize you know when they criticize people don't come to church but if I don't come to church they they're gonna say something well that's not the reason you come to church you come to church because you love God see but some people like to or if I don't go to church I love the pastor is gonna Point me out from now but that's not the reason anyway so we know our limitation second Corinthians 12 5 is such as one will I Glory of such and and when will I go again of myself I will know Glory but in my infirmities again um perfect strength by Perfect weaknesses you come you come say now Lord I have been in school for 40 years now I am an intellectual student I can quote the Bible with my eyes closed God cannot use a bit of that see or belong to the biggest church see um oh Lord oh I am a Pentecostal glory to God I just received the Holy Ghost uh the other night Hallelujah you are going to make me do this and do that God cannot use no whatever you get late I realize you are late and then coming back and humble yourself and then get weak for now and find out you are human but if I said being late sometimes you know to God will abase with downgraders or let something happen to our life where we cannot get out of it then we scream out but we don't want a way for God to Humble us that way see number nine he says they are a model a model the way they model the way they are sample humble people there are samples they are leaders see usually the Bible said Mark those that do good but also said Mark those that they're not that good that that create controversies and and things like that so if you have someone that is like that it's good you mark them if you want to be like somebody that's the guy you want to be like see so no there will be an example to the congregation an example to you Ephesians 2 24 29 said let not corrupt communication procedure of your mouth but that which is good to to the use of edifying that he may Minister Grace on to others I already talked to you earlier about that but the brother said now surely after all these years in the field and around the world I see getting the people I thought I had to know a little bit about the the gates to enter in our and if you want to get somewhere with God never let an arrogant Spirit ever come around don't let No Malice come and no matter what anybody says if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against the person see you'll be sweet and kind remember God love you when you were in sin and if the spirit of God is in you you love the other person when he is being wrong see just pray for him and love one another about everything love God I love one another and humble with God around one another and God will bless it and this is hard telling that he will do amen my conclusion here we go humble people they lead from within not without Colossians 3 to us says put on therefore as the elect of God a holy and beloved bowels of Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind meekness and long suffering Colossians 3 13 forbidding one another see and forgiving whatever forbearing one another is to tolerate one another you know to be patient with one another it says to forgive one another If any man have a core against any even ask I forgave you so also do you brother Brahman says he and this is my last quote and we can have all things in fellowship and common love one another then God will work with us and we are keeping time that the people come by and said if you want to see a church that is really humble and I'm looking at one you want to see a church that is really humble a church that really love God drop in there at that Tabernacle you know one time I'll watch them look at and the care they have for one another respect and when the gospel is being preached how Reverend and how everything just in order then they can look and see what time we are living because the church had to unite but if you can unite in here how can you Unite with everybody else and the word that Russia is going to happen this is how you're going to tell when time comes but the man says you know it's a mystical body around the world you're not people got the idea that we are going to get together in one place and unite it's not so the only place we're going to be all together unite it says in heaven we will meet him in heaven in heaven we will be together but here before that happens before we get close to that you see the churches you know around Ohio Michigan you know this church you see everybody coming together see as we've been talking and then suddenly change happens and then that church had their way out there in Michigan Ohio and another state they start experimenting the same thing and then we are not going to meet all together here in the earth in one spot in Jerusalem yeah but are they in Africa suddenly then the time comes and everybody's together as I just playing then you're going to see changes changes changes and suddenly a changeover body and then we will get together in the air not here in there and they can look and see what time we are leaving they they see the spirit of God moving among you you know that's the only God they're going to see there's people there that they are in trouble you know chaos and they're looking for just to lead a light of a sunshine to you know to shine on their darkest problems and and you have it but you by yourself you can only chase a thousand but if you can get with the brother that's ten thousand and the more we get together more light the more light and the light will reject the darkness that is pressing but we all got to come together and humble our son that is working together is telling the time but but if it's not working then the time has stopped I always used to tell to myself the only reason that God will stop working on me is when I poke a hole in his let me let me give you the illustration so you understand what I mean you have a spider you don't like spider don't worry it's a spider web and that little spider toys all day you know all day and then comes a little boy like me and then oh look at that poor she has toil all night all day now she had to stop completely the one fixed the hole that I caught so that's what happened in church we keep poking holes and poking holes so the church stopped because we got away for you now we gotta wait for this and we gotta resolve this one we cannot go forward now we have to go back and fix things so don't give a pass to a hard time let's move forward it's time to move forward we cannot go backward any longer so the only place to go is that way so let's fix our problem let's fix all our fall let the speed have harmony let's love one another let's forgive one another it doesn't matter because I want to move forward don't you want to move forward don't you want to see the day of the Lord coming don't you want to see your body change I want to move forward I don't want to start standing stand still in in time see because I used to sit just like that spider the only reason that I can't stop the god the hand of God in my life is that I poke a hole in his work then he has to go back and okay gotta get you back here let me put it this other way sometimes you have a besetting sin it happens and sorry Lord and it happens but you know it's going to happen until finally you have enough Faith to to face it that you have a problem you know like alcoholic that you're gonna help someone until they face the fact that they're an alcoholic if you have problems you have anything in your life until God take care of that you will move forward do you know that the only way you can move forward is that you could overcome that in your life and then you can move forward but as long as we're still dealing with the same thing the same issue and the same problem we just spinning law uh you know our lives so the sooner we let God take care of our leader teens the body can move forward because Julie the part is needed he said they can look and so what the spirit of God moving among new great things same wonders and things will be taking place if the things working together is is telling the time but if it isn't working then the time has stopped then people come to the church and say yeah I went to that church but nothing was happening in fact I think we have more in the Baptist Church than what they got there I mean I saw low faces long dresses and long hair but that's all I mean if that's what it is I can have that in the Baptist Church too no that's why some people sometimes do you talk to people on the sea and you try to to tell them about the gospel you try to give him testimony and they look at your life and they said well you know yeah I think I got more than what you got because you talking but I don't see anything you know I like to see a ceremony lived and preach I need to finish but if it isn't working then the time has stopped I won't tell the time no more so if we want to know what time we are leaving just start everybody working together in the gospel you want to see a Revival in the church it says we're together see it says so we want to know what time it is it's like where to get in the gospel loving one another and loving God and the handoff is the hands inside will tell the time what we are living in do you believe that and amen you can't stand to your feet thank you for being so patient with me and thank you for putting up with me and I know that it's not an easy thing as my wife not easy to put up with me so but uh I thank you guys I thank you for your love and thank you for your kindness and I thank you for everything you have done uh since we've been here I love you guys and and uh we love you and now I know we don't sometimes have the same opinions and sometimes we don't agree but that had nothing to do with anything we're still brothers and sister in favor of I said go to the back go the house and go ahead and disagree and fight and force and kick but when you come to the front you know with your arms around each other listen I've been married 45 years now I'm going 46 this year thank you and I still cannot agree 100 with my wife I mean if I cannot agree with my wife you think I'm agree with you totally 100 we're going to have these agreements face it we're going to have different ideas and thoughts and opinions but let that not separate us from one another see we're all different uh I'm from Puerto Rico but was from Mexico and you're from there and you're from there God has a variety we are not all different we don't like the same things so if you don't like cherry pie you know fine I don't but don't this Fellowship me because you know our life but I like Apple you know you know I come from another country I was shaped and forming different than you were shape and formed but see when we come into the gospel we kind of agree with one thing and we can win one Accord the word the word is correct everything else is meaningless thank you yes love you I don't think you want to dismiss or you want me to dismiss that's one thing I don't know how to do singing I can carry a tune in a bucket

spirit of God the only way to be led by the spirit of God is to be gentle and to not know a whole lot and that's it and when we get to know too much and we put that out there it has all the characteristics of not being able to work together not being able to work function as a body and all these other things so the channel That humility let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus this is his mindset this is his this is how he functions how he walked on this Earth he thought it not robbery to be equal with God he knew his position with God he knew who he was he knew he was God on Earth but yet he made himself a no reputation he intentionally made himself less popular even though he's getting more popular he intentionally made himself of no reputation to stay simple
