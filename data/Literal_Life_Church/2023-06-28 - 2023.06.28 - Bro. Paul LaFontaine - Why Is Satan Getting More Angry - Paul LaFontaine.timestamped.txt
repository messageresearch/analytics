[0:15] behind it and that we are the weapons in
[0:18] God's Armory to be able to come out in
[0:20] this hour be able to face whatever
[0:22] things that come our way praise the Lord
[0:24] it was God who chose you to live at this
[0:27] time in this place if you'd have chose
[0:29] yourself you would have chose another
[0:30] time but it was God who chose you to
[0:32] live during this time so if he chose you
[0:34] to be here he'd give you the tools he'd
[0:36] give you the weapons he give you the
[0:37] faith to be able to make it through this

[1:08] else we'll watch the kids for you
[1:10] amen Daniel chapter 3 we're going to
[1:13] read a couple places in the scripture
[1:14] and that's one of them uh in Daniel
[1:17] chapter 3 we welcome all you tonight
[1:19] it's so good to be in the in his house
[1:20] and be able to feel his presence and
[1:22] worship him what he deserves all of our
[1:25] worship and praise and all of ourselves
[1:27] and so it's always a joy to be able to
[1:29] have the place and time to do that and
[1:31] just give it all to him amen
[1:34] Daniel chapter 3
[1:36] and then in the New Testament after that
[1:38] I want to read in second Timothy chapter
[1:40] 3. Daniel chapter 3 and verse 16 if we
[1:44] could read together before we're seated
[1:47] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego answered
[1:50] and said to the king o Nebuchadnezzar we
[1:52] are not careful to answer thee in this
[1:54] matter if it be so our God whom we serve
[1:58] is able to Deliver Us From The Burning
[1:59] fiery furnace and he will deliver us out
[2:02] of thine hand O King but if not
[2:04] be known unto thee O King that we will
[2:06] not serve thy Gods nor worship the
[2:08] golden image which thou has set up then
[2:11] then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury
[2:16] and the form of his Visage was changed
[2:19] against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[2:22] therefore he spake and commanded that
[2:24] they should heat the furnace one seven
[2:27] times more than it won't to be heated
[2:30] second Timothy chapter 3 in the New
[2:33] Testament We'll add some scriptures here
[2:36] to the the text and the context second
[2:39] Timothy chapter 3.
[2:42] verse 12.
[2:44] yea and all that will live Godly in
[2:48] Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[2:54] but evil men and seducers shall wax
[2:58] worse and worse deceiving and being
[3:02] deceived evil men and seducers shall wax
[3:06] worse and worse doesn't say that it will
[3:10] get better and better as you have many
[3:13] years as a Christian
[3:14] if you're living Godly in Christ Jesus
[3:17] then the spirits and the the forces
[3:20] against you will get worse and worse
[3:23] evil men and seducers shall wax worse
[3:26] and worse deceiving and being deceived
[3:28] and I want to speak a little bit tonight
[3:29] in the service on why is Satan getting
[3:33] more angry
[3:36] why is Satan getting more Angry how many
[3:39] believe that Satan's getting more angry
[3:42] how many believe that Satan has always
[3:45] been angry
[3:46] all right but how many believe in this
[3:48] last hour he's getting more angry and
[3:51] he's howling even more well there's a
[3:53] reason for that and it's not just
[3:54] because he doesn't like your personality
[3:57] there's a reason that Satan is getting
[3:59] more and more Angry as we get closer to
[4:01] the Rapture amen heavenly father bless
[4:04] your word tonight may offer it freely
[4:07] Lord for my heart may you replace Lord
[4:10] the burdens that I have may you unburden
[4:13] me Lord and may you bring the joy of God
[4:15] in my heart so that I can freely
[4:17] Minister your word to your precious
[4:19] people tonight whoever's here whoever's
[4:21] listening whoever would listen later
[4:23] father if there's a heart that's
[4:25] hungering for more of you we pray you so
[4:28] anoint our words I'm just a human being
[4:30] but you can anoint men of God to speak
[4:32] words of life and that you would bring
[4:34] deliverance and hope and strength and
[4:36] encouragement to a heart that's seeking
[4:38] you and we trust your truth will set the
[4:41] people free in the name of Jesus Christ
[4:43] we ask him amen
[4:46] and God bless you may be seated
[4:49] I'm going to read a little bit tonight
[4:50] as a foundation from Brother Branham and
[4:53] we'll get to it just in a minute and I'm
[4:55] going to read from a sermon that he
[4:57] preached Christ The Mystery of God
[4:59] revealed and um
[5:02] I want you to notice the title of that
[5:04] Christ The Mystery of God revealed is
[5:07] and that he's saying and I always look
[5:09] at some of these things that's not just
[5:11] a sermon title and I trust it would be
[5:13] that way with my sermons as well that
[5:15] it's not just a title but but it's an
[5:17] announcement and it's a it's a
[5:19] proclamation of where we're standing
[5:20] right now and that's what I believe
[5:21] about many of these titles it's not just
[5:24] sermons but it's announcements saying
[5:26] where the bride is at in the last days
[5:28] Christ The Mystery of God revealed even
[5:31] in that title is a lot of Revelation but
[5:34] notice he says he will be revealed
[5:36] Christ will be revealed and he will be
[5:39] revealed by revelation
[5:41] and then uh then we see that in that
[5:45] title it says Christ will be revealed
[5:47] it's one thing if we know about Christ
[5:49] Jesus of 2000 years ago in our stories
[5:52] from Sunday school and we see the four
[5:55] gospels and we see he lived 33 years and
[5:57] we see his fleshly days here on Earth
[6:00] but it's another thing that God drops a
[6:02] revelation of who Christ really is and
[6:05] actually the new birth is the revelation
[6:08] of Jesus Christ personally to you not
[6:11] just the church receives it not just a
[6:14] group that receives it but it's
[6:16] personally to you the new birth is a
[6:18] revelation of Christ personally to you
[6:21] and when that Revelation comes listen I
[6:23] can tell you it's not just that you
[6:25] understand Jesus in the four gospels
[6:27] Christ becomes real and personal to you
[6:29] and so that that time that title is as
[6:32] an announcement it's it's what is
[6:34] happening now secretly and we're just
[6:37] not talking about his life here on Earth
[6:39] but who he is is revealed in the day and
[6:41] its fullness in this day is in its
[6:44] fullness Christ will be revealed in his
[6:46] fullness and who is he revealing it to
[6:49] he's revealing it to his body his people
[6:53] because we are the body of Christ if the
[6:57] body of Christ is without the head then
[6:59] she's not really the body of Christ how
[7:02] many believe tonight and I'm just laying
[7:04] in some foundational statements that I
[7:05] know you will at least nod to and amen
[7:08] would be nice but if you nod to it how
[7:09] many believe Christ is the head of the
[7:12] church he's the head
[7:14] he's the if we want to call it he's the
[7:16] brains he's the he's the one that
[7:18] directs just like your body your head if
[7:20] you cut your head off you're finished
[7:21] the body has no function without the
[7:23] head and so Christ is the head of the
[7:25] body the body has nothing can't be
[7:27] nourished can't be filled can't can't
[7:29] move can you say Amen without the head
[7:32] and so now in the end time we see Paul
[7:35] and Colossians saying the head that he
[7:37] is the head and by him and through him
[7:39] consist all things and she is the body
[7:42] but the head must be connected in a
[7:45] union with the body and through
[7:47] denominational ages of 2000 years
[7:50] denominational ideas has so destroyed
[7:54] the word of God and taken away from the
[7:55] word of God that you take away from the
[7:58] husband Christ and the body has become
[8:00] detached from the head
[8:03] but in the end time the head returns and
[8:06] reveals himself and when the head comes
[8:08] back and the body catches it she becomes
[8:10] one with him for a rapture
[8:13] so that's the prophecy for the end time
[8:15] and so it's him who's revealing himself
[8:18] to his body his people that's what's
[8:20] happening right now spiritually that's
[8:22] what's happening we can talk about
[8:24] what's happening in the news we can take
[8:26] prophecy and and bring all these things
[8:28] but what spiritually happened is the
[8:30] bride is recognizing her headship Christ
[8:34] has returned you say well he's returned
[8:37] not in a physical body yet but because
[8:40] that's when we meet him in the air but
[8:42] Christ has returned in the fullness of
[8:44] his word why has he done that because
[8:47] he's the head and the body's got to
[8:49] connect with it before Rapture and so
[8:51] when she recognizes her headship her
[8:53] true headship and her headship is not a
[8:55] denominational head her headship is not
[8:57] a church her headquarters is not
[9:00] somewhere here on Earth
[9:03] she's recognizing her true headship
[9:06] which is Christ the word and that is
[9:09] what's happening in True Believers she's
[9:11] recognizing her headship Christ is here
[9:13] he is my head I'm becoming one with him
[9:16] and his word is coming through him that
[9:18] I'm truly his body
[9:21] amen his word is flowing through the
[9:24] Bride As she brings herself in the word
[9:26] so with that in mind and just in case
[9:28] you haven't listened uh to that service
[9:31] or maybe you need to listen again just
[9:33] to remind you he says in that as a
[9:36] foundation that in the mystery of God is
[9:37] threefold and he says number one and
[9:40] brother uh Stephen mentioned this on
[9:42] Sunday the mystery of God is threefold
[9:44] number one what did God want to do
[9:45] what's the what's the achievement of the
[9:48] entire Bible it's one mystery of God but
[9:50] it's threefold number one is God wanted
[9:53] to come down and become man and show
[9:55] himself to the people in flesh so that
[9:57] was the first step of his threefold
[10:00] mystery is God came down and become
[10:02] flesh Jesus was another was not another
[10:05] person of the Trinity he was God in
[10:07] flesh the fullness of God how many
[10:09] believe that so now he fulfilled that
[10:12] part of his ministry but but that wasn't
[10:14] the full mystery the second part of the
[10:16] threefold mystery is for the people for
[10:19] the for the for him one once he's here
[10:22] to have the preeminence in his body to
[10:25] have his preeminence in the people so he
[10:28] would have to be here in order for him
[10:30] to take the position of preeminence in
[10:31] the body for 2000 years the preeminence
[10:34] has been denominational ideas for two
[10:37] thousand years it's been man's ideas for
[10:39] two thousand years it's Church systems
[10:41] and so they get away from the true head
[10:43] the husband Christ and then he says I
[10:45] will bring it back I'll bring my
[10:46] headship back the bride recognizes it
[10:48] and she'll leave all other husbands and
[10:51] choose that one husband Jesus Christ
[10:52] didn't Paul say in the Bible I've
[10:55] espoused you to one husband I fear less
[10:57] like Eve was deceived in the garden I
[11:00] fear that Satan would deceive you and be
[11:02] subtle like it was before taking you to
[11:04] other husbands but I'm I'm I'm laboring
[11:07] with you in the gospel to bring you to
[11:09] that one goal that you come under one
[11:11] headship and it's only Christ that you
[11:13] have one husband and it's only Christ
[11:15] all other husbands will be dead can you
[11:18] say Amen
[11:19] so you know here we have the second part
[11:23] is is the preeminence coming in a people
[11:26] and that's where we live right now the
[11:28] third part of his mystery is to restore
[11:30] them back completely to Eden again the
[11:33] head the body restored Back to Eden like
[11:35] the Garden of Eden again and that's what
[11:37] George just that's the summary
[11:39] I just gave you the summary of your
[11:41] entire Bible everybody hold their Bible
[11:43] up
[11:44] I just gave you the summary of every
[11:47] type every shadow everything that was
[11:49] done here every story that you knew from
[11:51] Sunday school there's one summary and
[11:53] now I'm reaching back into the back part
[11:55] of God's mind before he allowed all this
[11:58] to happen what was his achievement what
[12:00] was his purpose
[12:03] and I just said it to you that he'd
[12:05] reveal himself to man that he'd get the
[12:07] preeminence in a body
[12:09] and then he'd take them back to Eden
[12:10] again and restore how many believes got
[12:12] to restore he's going to restore us back
[12:13] to Eden
[12:14] man he's going to restore us back to
[12:16] Eden again completely so that's the
[12:19] summary of your entire Bible that's what
[12:21] was the back of the back part of God's
[12:22] mind to achieve through time and he's
[12:25] wrapping up the second part now
[12:27] and he's almost on on the verge to go to
[12:30] the third restoring us back to Eden
[12:32] again let me say it this way Christ is
[12:34] the head of the body
[12:36] and the body at the end time recognizes
[12:39] that this is our this is our head Christ
[12:42] that's come back to us the word has come
[12:44] back to us again through denominational
[12:46] ideas he's restored the full word back
[12:48] to us and thus Christ our head is back
[12:50] and it's revealed to her this is him
[12:53] this is the one we see in 2000 years ago
[12:56] this is the true Christ revealed and
[12:58] when she recognizes my head is here this
[13:01] is Christ she Embraces it she becomes
[13:03] one with it by the Holy Ghost and when
[13:05] she does she becomes his hands and his
[13:09] feet on Earth
[13:11] where's Jesus he's in his people
[13:13] what's the final manifestation to this
[13:17] world of Christ not Jesus in the air but
[13:20] Jesus in his body
[13:23] and you say Amen
[13:24] we meet him in the air but when the word
[13:27] comes back according to Revelations 1 he
[13:29] sets his foot upon the Land and Sea
[13:31] Christ that Covenant angel that rainbow
[13:33] Angel that's Christ there and when he
[13:35] comes down and descends that's not a
[13:37] physical return the physical return is
[13:39] to meet him in the air in a Rapture this
[13:42] is a word returning of Christ the full
[13:44] word because that's who how many let me
[13:46] step back a bit how many know that
[13:49] Christ is not just the physical body
[13:51] that was here 2000 years ago Christ is
[13:54] the word
[13:55] he's the person of the word
[13:59] John 1 and 1. in the beginning was the
[14:02] word Matthew starts out the birth of
[14:04] Jesus and the story Luke Mark Luke tells
[14:06] about the the beginnings being the birth
[14:08] of Christ John starts it with a with the
[14:11] eagle anointing on John he starts the
[14:14] whole Beginnings not at the birth of
[14:16] Christ but to tell who this Christ
[14:18] really was and that was in the beginning
[14:20] was the word and the Word was with God
[14:22] and the Word was God and the Word was
[14:26] made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's
[14:30] John's Eagle Eye describing what this
[14:32] birth of Christ was
[14:34] who is he well he was a Healer who is he
[14:38] he's a counselor he's a prince of P
[14:40] please but if you miss the part that he
[14:43] is the word revealed in every generation
[14:46] that is Christ when Christ Reveals His
[14:49] word to any generation that's a
[14:51] revealing of Christ and when he brings
[14:52] the word to that generation that's
[14:54] Christ revealing himself Jesus is the
[14:57] word Christ is the word can you say Amen
[15:02] he comes under this headship she
[15:04] forsakes all others uh all the other
[15:07] man's ideas she leaves she exits you
[15:10] find this in the Book of Revelations
[15:12] where babylon's there Babylon is uh is
[15:16] means religious confusion and the world
[15:19] is full of religious confusion
[15:20] especially in Christianity and the call
[15:23] to the bride at the last days is to come
[15:27] out of her my people
[15:29] her come out of come out of that system
[15:32] come out of that Babylonian religious
[15:35] confusion and come to where come back to
[15:37] the word
[15:39] praise the Lord come back to the true
[15:41] headship and there's a people it won't
[15:43] be a church doing it it won't be this
[15:45] church it's a it's an individuals coming
[15:47] back to the word and she comes back
[15:49] forsakes all the other man's ideas
[15:51] forsaking all others like a wife does
[15:53] when she stands in a wedding and she
[15:55] makes a commitment to that one man the
[15:57] bride makes a commitment to one man
[15:59] Jesus Christ all others I forsake all
[16:01] others it's like she takes a vow can you
[16:03] say Amen it's a more it's a more serious
[16:05] vow than what the girls and the guys
[16:07] take at the altar that's serious but the
[16:09] one you take to Christ uh I'll serve you
[16:12] for richer for poor and sickness and in
[16:15] health I'm not going to leave you I'm
[16:17] committed to you and forsaking all
[16:19] others as long as I shall live that's
[16:21] the commitment we make to our hardship
[16:23] Jesus Christ
[16:24] praise the Lord so she does and when she
[16:26] does when she does that the bride now in
[16:29] this hour it sets her in a Rapture
[16:31] condition to be restored Back to Eden
[16:34] praise the Lord so now
[16:36] you see now I said that because it gives
[16:40] the roots of the root of Satan's anger
[16:45] the root of Satan's anger is not just so
[16:48] you don't like you
[16:50] but the root of Satan's anger is this
[16:53] bride becoming one with her head Christ
[16:57] if you say Amen when you are becoming
[17:00] one and bring your life through the word
[17:01] and giving him the preeminence in your
[17:04] life and making him number one in your
[17:06] life when he he hates that more than
[17:09] anything because Satan has learned
[17:10] something and you know I feel very
[17:12] confident tonight if I don't get a lot
[17:14] of amens I'm going to give the devil a
[17:16] black eye tonight I don't care because
[17:17] he does not like me preaching like this
[17:20] because this is what's happening now
[17:22] I'm going to tell you what's making
[17:24] saying Satan angry from the beginning
[17:26] but he's also getting becoming more
[17:28] Angry as we get closer to this Union in
[17:32] this Oneness and this Rapture he's
[17:33] getting more Angry that's why the
[17:35] prophet took the Rapture text in Psalms
[17:37] 27 though a host should be encamped
[17:39] around me I will not fear hide me in thy
[17:42] Pavilion Lord praise the Lord why
[17:45] because as the everything intensifies
[17:47] and once intensifying oh world the
[17:50] worlds of the politics everything's
[17:52] intensifying everything's Under Pressure
[17:53] but why is it under pressure we're
[17:55] coming to the end of prophecies being
[17:57] fulfilled in the people of God the body
[18:00] of Christ she's coming to that moment
[18:02] where she's letting this word go through
[18:03] her and Satan can see some of the
[18:06] results of it and he's getting more
[18:07] angry at your life if you're the one
[18:10] bringing your life through the word and
[18:12] your family through the word he's
[18:13] becoming more angry at your family he's
[18:15] not going to walk away he's going to
[18:17] stand there more angry at you
[18:21] so now we get to the root of Satan's
[18:24] anger
[18:25] he gets more Angry as the Bride Comes
[18:28] under that headship
[18:30] he has passed God has passed his secrets
[18:34] to
[18:35] this bride he's passing his secrets to
[18:38] her through the word
[18:39] you ever have somebody that is telling
[18:42] secrets and they're not telling you what
[18:44] it is and you don't know what it is
[18:45] sometimes it can make you angry
[18:48] and Satan is watching in the last days
[18:51] the last 50 60 70 years as God through
[18:56] the ministry of the last days Whispers
[18:59] his secrets to a people when she's
[19:00] catching it
[19:03] and you know what I love he completely
[19:06] bypassed say he didn't need Satan's
[19:08] permission he left him out of it
[19:10] completely he's left him out because one
[19:12] thing about a revelation is that this is
[19:14] what he told Peter he said Peter you
[19:17] don't even realize all what you have but
[19:18] I'm going to tell you what you got right
[19:20] now when you said Thou Art the Christ
[19:21] the son of the Living God he said he
[19:24] said Jesus said Flesh and Blood did not
[19:27] reveal this to you
[19:29] you didn't get this from a seminary
[19:32] you didn't get this from man's teaching
[19:34] I gave you a revelation directly father
[19:37] from the father he said flesh and blood
[19:39] is not revealed but my Father in Heaven
[19:41] gave you a revelation bypassed all the
[19:45] man's ideas and the father deposited a
[19:48] revelation for him to burst out and say
[19:51] you're the Son of God you're the one
[19:53] that was supposed to come you think he
[19:55] figured that out in his head
[19:57] it was a revelation
[19:59] but I want you to notice the next thing
[20:00] Jesus said
[20:02] Upon This Rock
[20:04] of Revelation
[20:06] I will build my church how many knows he
[20:09] said that
[20:09] so he builds his church upon Revelation
[20:12] coming from God straight to his people
[20:15] not through seminaries not through
[20:18] intellectual teaching not through just
[20:20] figuring out in our brain I'll bypass
[20:22] that and I'll he may use her because the
[20:24] mind is the womb to the soul he might
[20:26] start there but it's not to stay in your
[20:28] mind it's to drop by Revelation into
[20:30] your art I will deposit that he says I
[20:33] will give you it came from your father
[20:34] and this is where I'll build my church
[20:37] upon Revelation and guess what the last
[20:40] part's the best the Gates of Hell cannot
[20:43] Prevail against it
[20:45] that tells me Satan's going to get angry
[20:47] what's he going to get angry at the
[20:49] revelation God gives you it's not that
[20:51] you don't like your personality it's
[20:53] that he's being bypassed and God is
[20:55] dropping Revelations some of you don't
[20:57] even realize all that God's deposited in
[20:59] your life tonight
[21:00] you don't realize in the last 10 years
[21:03] in the last two years maybe you've been
[21:04] around 30 years the secret thing that's
[21:07] been going on God has been depositing
[21:10] his Revelation and really revealing
[21:12] Christ to his bride
[21:15] say I don't feel worthy of it tonight
[21:17] you don't know how I feel tonight
[21:18] brother Paul I'm not going on your
[21:19] feelings I didn't come to preach to your
[21:22] feelings I come to preach to tell your
[21:24] position in Christ
[21:25] and you probably got more in you than
[21:28] what you realize
[21:30] you got lands and stuff laying down here
[21:32] that you don't even realize that you got
[21:34] I mean you have a revelation you
[21:36] understand you understand what I'm
[21:37] saying you understand what God has given
[21:38] you but you didn't know sometimes where
[21:41] all that came and you realize you have
[21:42] more in you than what what you realize
[21:45] and that's what Satan is mad at he had
[21:48] no hands in that and the Gates of Hell
[21:50] cannot Prevail against a man
[21:53] this is the way he said it
[21:55] Satan can't move a man with a revelation
[22:03] he can mess with your spirit
[22:05] he can depress you he can discourage you
[22:08] he can speak to your mind but one day
[22:11] that's going to be over too he can
[22:12] accuse you you're not a son of God look
[22:15] at the mistakes you made he can say your
[22:17] spirit can get low sometimes you can get
[22:20] physically sick in the body but then God
[22:22] can heal you can you say amen he can
[22:24] tamper with the outer two Realms of
[22:27] spirit and flesh because those two
[22:28] aren't born again
[22:30] but he can't get to the Revelation that
[22:34] God has deposited in your heart
[22:39] this is what makes Satan so angry
[22:42] helps us to be a mature adopted son's
[22:46] when you have that situation where all
[22:48] that live in Godly in Christ Jesus and
[22:51] take a stand and have a revelation shall
[22:53] suffer persecution and when it comes you
[22:57] stand sure-footed and you still
[22:58] confident because that person angry with
[23:01] me it's not the person it's the devil
[23:03] doesn't like what I have
[23:05] remember I talked about a few weeks ago
[23:07] the devil's learned this that the people
[23:09] get get a revelation and they act upon
[23:12] it from
[23:14] from
[23:16] Abel
[23:18] all the way through to the bride today
[23:20] Satan has learned that the people that
[23:22] get a revelation God bypasses Satan
[23:25] gives it to him even when they weren't
[23:26] worthy of it and Satan hates when they
[23:29] get a revelation
[23:31] from Abel
[23:32] how did Abel bring a blood sacrifice and
[23:35] Cain brought fruits
[23:37] one thing revelation
[23:41] he caught a revelation there no but
[23:43] there was no Bible there was no teaching
[23:46] on it there was no seminars on it
[23:49] got a revelation from God
[23:52] that it was blood that we fell by and
[23:54] now it takes blood to get us back so I'm
[23:56] bringing this bloody animal I'm slitting
[23:59] I'm gonna slit his throat I'm gonna let
[24:00] the blood come all over all of it and
[24:02] and Cain is over here on this side and
[24:05] he says I think it's of good fruits in
[24:07] our lives if that God honors good fruits
[24:09] and so he makes this beautiful table
[24:11] with all kinds of lush fruits on it
[24:13] God's going to be impressed with all of
[24:15] my good fruits makes it beautiful and
[24:18] Abel is over here and he don't know but
[24:20] just by Revelation he just does it and
[24:22] there's this big bloody table with a
[24:24] bloody animal around it and they both
[24:25] begin to worship and God says I accept
[24:28] Abel's and I reject Keynes
[24:34] and the only difference was God dropped
[24:36] a revelation this is what you bring in
[24:38] worship
[24:40] not your own fruits
[24:42] not some flowery altar
[24:46] blood we needed blood
[24:48] we needed a sacrifice for our sins
[24:50] the only one provided place to worship
[24:53] God is under the shed blood of Jesus
[24:54] Christ
[24:56] no other place to worship
[24:59] laying in some principles tonight
[25:01] and I hope you grab a hold of them
[25:04] so now
[25:05] we see then that it's revelation God
[25:09] gave Peter a revelation he bypass the
[25:11] hands of Satan and then there was power
[25:13] in it because he said the gates of hell
[25:14] should not Prevail against it that means
[25:16] he can get angry Satan can get as angry
[25:19] as he wants to get and do whatever he
[25:22] wants to do but he can never get to what
[25:25] God gave me he can never get to what God
[25:27] gave you if it is a true Revelation
[25:30] Satan can't get his grubby mitts on it
[25:32] can you say Amen no wonder he gets angry
[25:35] with what you have on the inside no
[25:37] wonder you have people that come against
[25:39] you no wonder that some the tension
[25:41] Rises sometimes and it festers towards
[25:44] you don't go don't blame the person but
[25:46] realize you can just raise your hands
[25:48] and say I must have something real
[25:50] Within Me For The Devil to be fighting
[25:52] me this much
[25:53] this church must be doing something
[25:55] right because I can tell you the devil's
[25:57] really fighting lately
[25:59] he's become more Angry he's wanting to
[26:02] cause more division but I will not stand
[26:04] for it I'll stand here and keep
[26:05] preaching this message I'll keep
[26:07] preaching the headship of Christ because
[26:08] I know some people and some young people
[26:10] are going to get the Holy Ghost can you
[26:13] say amen and it's going to make Satan
[26:16] more angry but I'm prepared for that I'm
[26:18] ready for it because I know this word
[26:20] will stand and the Gates of Hell shall
[26:23] not Prevail against a true revelation
[26:27] so let's get into these things that
[26:29] brother Branham said here in the first
[26:30] one and so I don't want you to catch now
[26:32] he's going to go into the subject of
[26:34] headship but he says a few times this is
[26:37] why Satan is howling this is why he's so
[26:40] angry right now he says when we see
[26:42] these great threefold revelation God in
[26:44] Christ Christ in the church the kingdom
[26:46] coming Adam and Eve redeem back to the
[26:48] Garden of Eden in the representation of
[26:50] Christ and his bride and then the
[26:51] kingdom is going to be restored
[26:53] according to his promise he just
[26:55] mentioned the threefold purpose just
[26:56] just like I did praise be to God now by
[27:00] the revelation of the threefold mystery
[27:02] the secret and by the personal
[27:04] Vindicated word by his original headship
[27:08] this is the same terminology I've been
[27:10] the original headship Christ
[27:12] and so I would just want to just hold it
[27:14] right there so now what she what is the
[27:16] bride recognizing his original headship
[27:19] what's come to us in the last days the
[27:21] original Christ of 2000 years ago his
[27:24] headship has returned my head is here
[27:26] and when my head is here I can be United
[27:28] in a marriage can you say a bride cannot
[27:30] have a wedding can have us can't have a
[27:32] ceremony if she doesn't have her husband
[27:34] around
[27:36] he could have sent her all these letters
[27:37] I'll be there I'll be there and then
[27:39] he's a no-show that has happened to some
[27:41] brides and it's pretty sad
[27:44] but you can get to the end time and
[27:46] Christ is a no-show no he showed up
[27:50] he's in the building
[27:51] and the bride says we can have the union
[27:54] now we can have the wedding because he's
[27:56] here my head is here I'm ready to
[27:58] unionize with him
[28:00] so the headship is returned and she
[28:03] recognizes it it is the original
[28:04] headship Christ himself it's not based
[28:07] upon any denominational idea or other
[28:09] man's ideas it's just Christ purely
[28:12] reveal himself the word the restoration
[28:14] of the word so notice he says here now
[28:16] go to the next one then he goes into
[28:19] this now not say well glory to God we
[28:22] shout hallelujah we sing now remember
[28:24] just a little later he's going to say
[28:26] this is why Satan is howling this is why
[28:29] Satan is so angry it's this headship
[28:32] returning and the bride could be coming
[28:34] one with it this is why Satan is
[28:36] becoming more and more angry
[28:38] as I said it's not your personality it's
[28:41] not just that this this that and the
[28:43] other it's not uh you know it's he
[28:46] doesn't like when the bride becomes one
[28:48] with him
[28:50] this is what makes him more Angry he
[28:53] doesn't like it when it's preached
[28:54] either
[28:55] but if that's he's going to go into
[28:58] something here and say well glory to God
[28:59] we shout hallelujah we sing that ain't
[29:02] that ain't it
[29:06] I I'm a missionary I've seen seven times
[29:08] practically around the world see I've
[29:10] seen heathens devils and everything else
[29:11] dance and Shout I've seen all kinds of
[29:14] fleshly manifestation that's carnal we
[29:17] don't judge
[29:19] the accuracy of a church or a camp
[29:22] by how much shouting is going on
[29:26] and I want to say this
[29:28] that's not what Satan gets angry at
[29:32] he's saying that here it's he's going to
[29:34] go online and say what's that he's
[29:36] holling at he's not we think oh this is
[29:38] what Satan's mad at he gets angry
[29:40] because they're speaking in tongues and
[29:41] they're shouting and there's dancing I
[29:43] believe in all that but I believe it
[29:45] comes as a result of the stimulation of
[29:47] Revelation when you get a revelation
[29:49] you're going to get emotional when God
[29:51] drops something in your heart you're
[29:52] going to get happy about it
[29:54] this isn't a dead cold formal religion
[29:56] this isn't an intellectual exercise when
[29:59] God drops a revelation in your heart
[30:01] you're going to get emotional some
[30:02] people sit and cry some people just
[30:04] raise their hands some shout the aisles
[30:06] but don't you ever use that as the
[30:09] clarification that That's what Satan is
[30:12] angry at because he's seen missionaries
[30:15] and heathens and Devils shout dance and
[30:18] even speak in tongues
[30:20] that's why you can't use it as a
[30:22] criteria for the evidence of the Holy
[30:24] Ghost
[30:26] can do it
[30:28] praise the lord well
[30:31] devils and everything else dance and
[30:32] Shout I've seen all kinds but I'm
[30:34] talking about what's he talking about
[30:35] the headship of Christ not that you can
[30:38] dance and shout and no I'm talking about
[30:41] the headship of Christ
[30:43] the headship has come
[30:45] you could dance and shout and not have
[30:48] be under the headship of this word
[30:51] and this word in the last days is a
[30:53] headship it's the true headship and when
[30:56] it comes we bring our lives under the
[30:57] headship of the word as a matter of fact
[30:59] we bring everything on our lives under
[31:02] his headship submissive what's the word
[31:05] say about it what music should I listen
[31:07] to what's the word say about it
[31:10] what kind of books should I read what's
[31:11] the word say about it and if there's a
[31:13] warning in this word in this message
[31:15] then the bride nobody else is going to
[31:17] do it I'm going to do what I want to do
[31:18] I'm going to watch the shows I'm going
[31:20] to watch I'm going to do it no but the
[31:21] bride says there's a word for it
[31:23] somebody preached that word and I'm
[31:24] bringing in submission my life under the
[31:26] headship of that word
[31:28] she's the only one doing it it's not
[31:31] about you can shout it's this headship
[31:33] of Christ notice being personally
[31:35] identified by the original history we
[31:37] have the answer to the devil's question
[31:38] amen glory next one we have the answer
[31:41] to the devil's question he Christ is
[31:43] risen and has paid the price and raising
[31:45] up her head or the body the devil can't
[31:47] stand it that's the reason these
[31:49] ecumenical kingdoms are setting up
[31:51] that's the reason they're all coming
[31:53] into what we're doing now the devil
[31:56] that's the reason he's howling the way
[31:58] he is his wickedness and his scheme has
[32:02] been uncovered by the Risen resurrected
[32:05] Christ in the headship over the body
[32:08] I'm preaching to you what Satan's really
[32:10] angry at
[32:11] and part of his anger
[32:15] is an ecumenical council that gathers
[32:17] together because they don't like the
[32:20] little groups that won't come in and
[32:22] agree and find some agreement with
[32:24] everybody
[32:26] come on brothers and they use the
[32:27] scripture Jesus said I pray that they
[32:29] all would be one they're losing using
[32:31] that scripture really how can two walk
[32:33] together unless they be agreed
[32:38] if that denominational system that's
[32:40] part of The ecumenical move is not under
[32:42] the headship of this word but under the
[32:44] headship of the organization how can I
[32:46] become one with that
[32:48] can't do it
[32:50] can't do it we we cannot come under
[32:53] anything except the true headship of
[32:55] Jesus Christ and part of Satan's howling
[32:58] is to grab get kingdoms together in
[33:01] their anger we're so upset we've got
[33:03] everybody but we don't have these young
[33:06] people we don't have this particular
[33:07] group this this they they won't join in
[33:10] with us they won't agree with us they
[33:12] won't preach it the way everybody should
[33:14] preach it and and there'll be a pressure
[33:16] come in the tribulation that they can't
[33:18] buy or sell unless they receive the mark
[33:22] how many know your Bible there's a mark
[33:24] of the beast study it it's not some
[33:26] worldly system or some planting on your
[33:28] head or your hand it's not that it's
[33:31] it's yielding your mind to a system
[33:33] that's wrong it's yielding your service
[33:35] your right hand to a system that's when
[33:36] you receive the mark and if you don't
[33:38] receive the Holy Ghost you will take the
[33:40] mark of the beast
[33:42] but we think it's of a of a
[33:45] a
[33:46] communism nature and if you study the
[33:49] Book of Revelation communism is only a
[33:52] tool to be used to come in the last days
[33:56] the King of the North King of the South
[33:58] in the Book of Daniel
[34:00] it's only a tool the real thing that you
[34:02] should fear
[34:04] is romanism
[34:07] boy I'm being plain tonight ain't I
[34:09] I might have to screen this going out
[34:12] I'm going to tell the truth anyhow
[34:15] a city that sets on Seven Hills
[34:18] a woman a church with the Beast system
[34:20] behind her of the old Roman Pagan Rome
[34:23] James de Papa wrong
[34:26] open your eyes Babylon
[34:29] so it's a form of Christianity that
[34:32] everybody comes into but it gets so
[34:34] angry at those groups who won't join
[34:36] with it we're going to put pressure on
[34:37] them and try to make them join
[34:40] it's part of Satan's anger and it's
[34:42] because the headship of Christ has come
[34:43] back to his body and he's getting more
[34:45] angry at that because she's becoming one
[34:47] with it next one
[34:49] that's it Christ the word he was the
[34:50] word he was the word and the church
[34:52] becomes the word by Me by him making her
[34:54] a part of him
[34:55] and that's the word again personally
[34:57] identified by him his property alone his
[35:00] property alone she is Redeemed by him
[35:02] through him for him and for him alone
[35:04] that's it then what the devil is how
[35:06] what the devil is howling about that's
[35:09] it's being revealed that's what the
[35:11] devil is how I'm going to go back to
[35:12] that last one please that what that's
[35:14] what the devil is howling about that
[35:16] it's being revealed to who to a people
[35:20] you know this last Sunday though they
[35:22] were enjoying the word of God you don't
[35:24] know what God was depositing to you
[35:28] then you wonder why you started Monday
[35:29] and the devil's angry with you
[35:32] God's doing something he can't get his
[35:34] hands on it Satan can't get his hands on
[35:36] it this is what the devil is howling
[35:38] about that it's being revealed if you
[35:41] can raise your hand tonight and say I
[35:43] know God has given me a true Revelation
[35:45] directly from his throne you know what
[35:47] guess what you're a target of the enemy
[35:50] his anger is getting worse in you
[35:52] sometimes it comes through family
[35:54] members but don't judge them it's just
[35:57] the devil that's mad at you
[35:59] because they're kind of like the echo
[36:00] medical Council that's trying to conform
[36:02] you back to the way they wanted things
[36:04] to be the husband's trying to get you
[36:06] back
[36:07] my wife has become a religious zealot my
[36:10] husband's become a religion this young
[36:12] person you're going off the deep end
[36:14] with this thing and they're pressuring
[36:15] you to come back into what's normal
[36:18] but when you get full of the Holy Ghost
[36:20] this is normal this is normal and I'm
[36:23] not going back I will go back I won't go
[36:26] back to the way it used to be Christ is
[36:28] my head now the word is my head every
[36:30] decision I make is through the word of
[36:32] God what does his word say about it
[36:36] and I don't live any other life except
[36:38] to see what his word says and when his
[36:39] word speaks that's the final word for me
[36:43] It's the final word for me
[36:45] praise the Lord somebody say praise the
[36:47] Lord
[36:48] amen why did you choose such a Teaching
[36:51] Ministry tonight when everybody's tired
[36:55] you have to take my coat off and just
[36:57] jump up and down to keep you all awake
[37:00] next one
[37:01] we're in a dangerous time remember the
[37:03] scripture says when these things begin
[37:04] to happen time is no more she's fading

[37:24] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[37:26] there's seven angels through through the
[37:28] church ages it's the seventh angel he
[37:30] says in the days of the voice of the
[37:31] seven Angel then the mystery of God will
[37:34] be revealed the mystery got to be
[37:36] finished
[37:36] through the vocal cords of the seventh
[37:38] angel then the bride receives it and she
[37:40] becomes one with that word can you say
[37:42] Amen we're in a dangerous time he says
[37:44] time no no I will no longer delay this
[37:46] Revelation for my bride The Book of
[37:48] Daniel says the same thing seal it up
[37:50] Daniel seal it up and it's all sealed up
[37:52] but when's it going to be open
[37:53] Revelations 10 in the days of the voice
[37:55] of the mystery of God should be finished
[37:57] I'll burst forth my Revelation why no
[37:59] more delay I won't hold it back anymore
[38:01] I'm going to give it to my people
[38:03] what a day to live in then he goes into
[38:06] the world events earthquakes Jesus said
[38:08] the beer you see them thousands killed
[38:10] the other day earthquakes in diverse
[38:11] places fearful sights in the skies
[38:13] pillars of fire like floating around
[38:15] like flying saucers they don't know what
[38:17] it is
[38:19] these things are signs in the heavens
[38:21] that we're close
[38:23] I don't know what this smoke is over us
[38:25] but it always makes you is this the next
[38:27] thing
[38:29] where is this in the scripture because
[38:31] it serves things awful odd
[38:34] is this the germ warfare is something
[38:36] falling here do I need a mask
[38:39] is the government going to bring us
[38:40] these big gas masks I don't know
[38:43] I'm just ready to go I don't know give
[38:45] me my mask but I'm ready to be raptured
[38:47] out of here
[38:49] they don't know what it is they don't
[38:51] have any idea what those flying saucers
[38:53] are next one he says did you notice the
[38:55] angels that come down investigating
[38:57] Sodom before Sodom was destroyed you
[38:59] remember that there was a bunch of them
[39:01] come down three of them one of them
[39:02] stayed with Abraham you remember that
[39:04] they were lights from Heaven that came
[39:06] down in the investigating judgment one
[39:08] look where you all found around the
[39:11] Pentagon things they find them that's
[39:13] the world judgment Sodom and there is
[39:15] one represented will be represented
[39:17] among the churches will be Christ
[39:18] himself vindicating to us see in heavens
[39:21] above and signs and the earth below
[39:22] that's what Jesus said there'll be signs
[39:24] of above and signs below the flying
[39:27] saucers the lights they're seeing they
[39:29] don't understand what they are but
[39:31] they're investigating Angels because
[39:32] we're very close to tribulation and the
[39:35] judgments of God
[39:37] so I'll go into this next one here later
[39:39] in the sermon I believe it is identified
[39:41] all the devil is howling about this the
[39:45] manifested truth of the promise of the
[39:47] word in ER alone they don't have the
[39:49] answer when Jesus come why didn't those
[39:51] Pharisees he said if I cast out my
[39:53] Devils by the Finger of God who do you
[39:55] cast them out by see he stood alone and
[39:57] his church stands alone she is not
[40:00] hooked with nothing
[40:02] one headship Jesus Christ but he
[40:05] identified by God being the body that
[40:08] was God dwelt in and the church is
[40:10] identified by his body doing the same
[40:12] thing she is his body the manifested
[40:15] truth of his promised word for the last
[40:17] days and she and she alone stands by it
[40:21] that's why the devil is howling
[40:25] he didn't know tonight why the devil's
[40:27] getting more angry this is why the
[40:30] headship has come
[40:31] Christ the word has come
[40:33] every day the Lord is showing himself to
[40:37] his true people and they're saying I
[40:39] want to become one with him
[40:41] I don't want to be distracted I don't
[40:43] want to be I want to become one and I
[40:45] want to have let him have the
[40:47] preeminence since he's here let him have
[40:50] the preeminence in this Kingdom did you
[40:53] know this is a kingdom here
[40:55] your body is even a kingdom
[40:58] who's going to be the king of your
[40:59] kingdom you your mind I don't trust my
[41:02] mind
[41:04] she said this is my Christ this person
[41:06] of Christ is here the word is here in
[41:08] this body if nobody else submits
[41:11] young person listen to me you're
[41:13] surrounded by thousands of young people
[41:16] first of all some who don't care about
[41:18] the word Christ they they that's fine
[41:21] but let there be a number of young
[41:25] people in this generation that says I
[41:28] want to bring my life under subjection
[41:30] to the word of God
[41:32] there will be a people there will be
[41:34] some at Judgment Day
[41:37] when some rise up on the stand
[41:40] and say I didn't follow the word as a
[41:43] teenager because it was too hard I
[41:46] didn't want it I rebelled against it and
[41:48] also here's another thing nobody could
[41:51] live that close to God and so I didn't
[41:53] do it
[41:54] God and God steps back and says he
[41:57] brings the young people from the
[41:59] laodicean generation he brings them up
[42:01] and says it's not true here's a whole
[42:04] host of young people coming from
[42:06] laodicea that became one with Christ
[42:09] I want to be one of those I don't want
[42:12] to be a statistic I want to be one of
[42:13] them that he stands with me because I
[42:16] stood with him he stands with me on the
[42:18] day of judgment
[42:20] praise the Lord that's why the devil's
[42:22] howling these great organizations have
[42:24] set up something to close her up I like
[42:26] this last part these great organizations
[42:28] to set something up because this is
[42:30] Satan's anger we're going to set
[42:31] something up to close up her churches
[42:34] they'll there'll be a pressure to close
[42:36] this church someday they'll never do it
[42:39] I love this
[42:41] she the bride will be taken up not
[42:43] closed up
[42:47] amen
[42:50] that's our promise
[42:53] not closed up taken up
[42:56] Hallelujah
[42:58] I love him so much tonight
[43:02] give me about two more minutes I should
[43:03] be done here praise the Lord
[43:06] this is why Satan is howling this is why
[43:09] Satan is becoming more angry it's not at
[43:13] a life that's a borderline believer
[43:16] Satan is not angry at borderline
[43:18] Believers Satan's not angry at
[43:20] compromisers
[43:21] Satan's not angry at the person who
[43:23] shouts Satan is not angry but you start
[43:26] living the life and you by a revelation
[43:28] you start living the life of Christ
[43:29] that's when Satan becomes more angry at
[43:31] you
[43:33] Satan is not howling of those things but
[43:35] he is getting more and more angry at the
[43:37] sons of God somebody is letting that
[43:39] word come through their lives and they
[43:41] are becoming with the word more and more
[43:42] he's getting his rightful position
[43:44] Christ is getting his rightful position
[43:47] in first place in their lives and every
[43:50] question of life gets addressed by the
[43:53] word first because he is her or his head
[43:57] he's my head the word is my head it's
[43:59] not because of your personality it's not
[44:01] because you go to church Satan's not
[44:03] angry at you because you attend church
[44:06] that doesn't make there's hundreds of
[44:09] people thousands around the world at a
[44:10] chin Church some of them were faithful
[44:12] than you
[44:14] it's not that Satan's angry because you
[44:17] come to church and I'm really glad
[44:18] you're here tonight many come from
[44:19] distances an hour and a half away
[44:21] sometimes longer here tonight in this
[44:23] service God bless you some listening
[44:25] from many places God bless you but
[44:27] that's not what Satan is angry with you
[44:29] about it's the Revelation that you hold
[44:31] it's your dedication to come under God's
[44:34] headship it's your submission because
[44:36] only the bride will be submissive to
[44:38] this word the rest rebound say I'm not
[44:40] going to do that I'm going to pick and
[44:41] choose what I want out of the message
[44:42] she's not doing that she's saying I
[44:44] value it all I want it
[44:46] she becomes one with it
[44:49] amen let me just say it this way the
[44:52] message of the last days reveals Christ
[44:58] and Christ is the head
[45:01] so what is the message it has revealed
[45:04] the fullness of Christ
[45:06] message is not a movement to me the
[45:09] message is not just a bunch of group of
[45:11] churches the message of the last days to
[45:13] me has revealed our head Jesus Christ
[45:17] what he wants what he desires how to
[45:20] live
[45:22] what this Bible says restoration of the
[45:24] true interpretation of this word of God
[45:26] it's all that can you say amen and the
[45:29] bride submits under that headship by
[45:31] revelation
[45:34] if you can't pray for anybody else pray
[45:36] for me as a pastor
[45:38] and the true Ministers of the rest of
[45:40] the last days because the Antichrist
[45:42] spirit is getting more and more angry
[45:46] at me
[45:48] for preaching these things and me being
[45:52] under his headship
[45:55] and so I don't take it personal anymore
[45:57] because I know Satan's angry because at
[45:59] the preachers who preach the headship of
[46:02] this word and bring themselves under the
[46:03] headship and bring this church under the
[46:05] headship of the word we're going to keep
[46:07] preaching the message of the last days
[46:10] and you don't experience it but many
[46:13] times
[46:14] it's like rubbing a cat's fur
[46:17] the wrong way
[46:20] while you're preaching
[46:22] somebody starts to squirm you know and
[46:26] it doesn't matter it just depends it
[46:27] gets their number one part of the word
[46:30] is corrective
[46:33] you know uh
[46:35] correction is another thing people run
[46:37] from today
[46:39] this generation does not want correction
[46:41] they react bad to it they don't want to
[46:43] be corrected but this word corrects the
[46:45] air this word corrects us
[46:47] and it takes somebody saying listen I'm
[46:49] willing if this is Christ correct to me
[46:51] in his word I'm willing to be corrected
[46:53] I submit to it
[46:55] but we live in a generation that they're
[46:57] not going to be corrected
[46:59] they're a victim if everybody is trying
[47:01] to correct them they're always a victim
[47:02] everybody's doing them wrong
[47:05] so you can imagine they don't take
[47:07] things too well from me because it's
[47:08] like that a cat being wrong the wrong
[47:11] way and so when I when I stroke that
[47:16] Pentecostal cap
[47:18] the other direction that gets angry when
[47:21] I stroke that Baptist starchy cat the
[47:24] other way it gets a little angry when I
[47:26] stroke that intellectuals and I hit on
[47:28] that through the word and I talk about
[47:31] Paul who was the most intellectual
[47:33] teacher and learned in man and I want to
[47:37] remind you when he came to the message
[47:38] of his day he said I had to take all of
[47:41] my past learning in all my years in the
[47:44] seminaries and I had to forget it and
[47:46] count it all as dung in order to receive
[47:49] the message of the day
[47:53] God doesn't need your formal learning
[47:56] when he's got Revelation for you
[47:59] God doesn't need intellectuals and
[48:01] that's why the word will correct
[48:02] intellectuals that's not going to get us
[48:04] into the kingdom
[48:05] so you rub that intellect before the
[48:07] people get mad you run those in modest
[48:10] girls and immodest guys might as well
[48:13] say guys you rub that you read some
[48:15] quotes and scriptures and you rub that
[48:17] cat the wrong way and they get swirmy
[48:19] squirmy and they get mad at you you rub
[48:22] that Pride the wrong way you rub those
[48:24] Jezebels running their homes and
[48:26] husbands
[48:30] you you rub that manipulative cat that's
[48:34] manipulating everybody in their home and
[48:36] their lives and you become the one man
[48:38] in their life that won't be manipulated
[48:40] by them and they don't like you they're
[48:42] manipulating everybody else but they're
[48:43] not manipulating me
[48:45] or the word and they don't like it they
[48:47] get angry
[48:49] there's this cat you know and brother
[48:51] Brahm says I remember in Tulsa Oklahoma
[48:53] there was an awful mess there with all
[48:55] them denominations and preachers
[48:57] and this is Oklahoma's Tulsa it's
[48:59] probably around Oral Roberts and
[49:00] different ones you know and it's just a
[49:02] big mess and they were fighting and I
[49:03] was sitting in the building and I got a
[49:05] vision and I I had a vision it was a
[49:07] pretty little old kitten and he was
[49:09] laying on the silk pillow and he was the
[49:11] cutest little fella I walked over there
[49:13] and I'm afraid of a cat I went over
[49:15] there and I began to rake him and he was
[49:18] going
[49:19] you know how they do when they make that
[49:21] funny noise you know and I was raking
[49:23] him and just patting pretty little kitty
[49:26] and he said purr just as fine you know
[49:28] and I looked over behind his pillow and
[49:30] it said his name and it said Pentecostal
[49:33] kitten
[49:36] well I thought now isn't that strange
[49:38] and I said this has got to be a vision
[49:40] now that I'm in and something said as
[49:42] long as you rake his fur this way he's
[49:44] all right but now if you want to see
[49:46] what he's made out of rake his fur
[49:48] backwards
[49:50] correct his Pentecostalism that's not
[49:53] based upon the word
[49:55] and so he said when you do that he said
[49:58] reckon so I raked his fur back and then
[50:01] my eyes stuck out you know how cats are
[50:05] green and he was a monster standing
[50:08] there spitting at me as hard as he could
[50:13] what made him angry his fur got rubbed
[50:16] the wrong way
[50:18] see Jake's rake his fur back a little
[50:20] bit and I experienced that sometimes
[50:24] and I know you do too
[50:27] sit there and get angry with me angry
[50:29] with me and and uh
[50:31] he's preaching on me and I don't know
[50:33] why he has to get on those subjects and
[50:35] I don't know why he has to say that but
[50:37] these aren't my subjects I'm trying to
[50:40] go to the source of the core of the word
[50:42] of God and and thankfully nobody I
[50:46] founded this church so when I bring my
[50:48] Bible up I can take any Scripture in
[50:51] this Bible and take a text and preach it
[50:54] freely
[50:57] I'm glad to have that freedom tonight I
[51:00] don't have a denominational help telling
[51:02] me what to preach and I'm thankful for
[51:03] that and I have a deacon board that says
[51:06] preach it every word whatever you feel
[51:08] to preach preach it freely in the word
[51:09] of God
[51:11] I have a congregation many Souls that
[51:13] sang preach it even it takes to Hideout
[51:15] I've had people you know it takes the
[51:17] hide off my back tell it like it is if
[51:19] I'm starting to live in sin preach
[51:21] against the sin if I'm getting off track
[51:23] now not everybody's saying that in the
[51:25] congregation
[51:26] but thankfully we have some and I'm
[51:28] going to keep preaching it and if
[51:29] everybody's gone someday then I'll
[51:32] preach it to my wife at home
[51:35] and then she'll preach to me a little
[51:37] bit no just kidding just kidding I
[51:39] didn't mean to say that that slipped out
[51:43] but I realized the devil's getting more
[51:45] Angry not because of me
[51:47] but because the headship I'm under you
[51:49] realize when you come to the message of
[51:51] the last days Christ it's the head and
[51:53] you're actually submitting to a headship
[51:56] it's a headship
[51:59] it is and if you're under the wrong
[52:01] headship sometime in your life
[52:04] and you learn the wrong kind then you
[52:06] don't trust headship
[52:08] but you don't need to mistrust the
[52:09] headship of Jesus Christ
[52:12] the word you need to trust that headship
[52:14] and you bring your life underneath it
[52:16] and headship works this way
[52:18] husbands
[52:20] as long as you're under the headship of
[52:22] the word your headship at home goes a
[52:24] lot better
[52:27] because God doesn't endorse the
[52:29] authority
[52:30] and a man in first in his authority if
[52:32] he's not under the headship of the word
[52:34] himself
[52:35] can you say Amen
[52:37] so this works and because you know all
[52:41] this is by headship being submissive you
[52:43] know some of the reason I one of the
[52:44] reasons I come to church with my family
[52:46] is that I love the word of God I hunger
[52:48] for the word of God but another reason
[52:50] is I have a certain responsibility to
[52:52] the rest of the body of Christ it
[52:54] encourages everybody else if I'm here
[52:57] and so there's a submission that says I
[52:59] might be tired and I might have
[53:00] something else to do but there's a
[53:01] submission under this headset and say
[53:03] I'm going to make being at church a
[53:04] priority
[53:05] why because I'm submissive under that
[53:07] headship the Bible says don't forsake
[53:08] the assembling of yourselves together
[53:10] yeah is that what the Bible says so I
[53:12] read that and I can say well that
[53:14] doesn't apply to me or that's not
[53:15] important but no there's a certain
[53:16] submission that comes with being around
[53:18] the body of Christ it's not just you're
[53:20] an island but you're submissive to the
[53:23] rest of the body and the work of the
[53:25] Lord that's going on
[53:27] it's all in the headship of Jesus Christ
[53:31] and so just to end this tonight you know
[53:34] why the king got mad you know why the
[53:36] king got mad and got in a fury about the
[53:39] Hebrews it's because of how they
[53:40] answered saying we are not going to Bow
[53:43] God can Deliver Us from the fire if you
[53:46] put us in there but we are not going to
[53:48] Bow if God doesn't Deliver us if God if
[53:52] God delivers us praise be to God but if
[53:54] you throw us in there and God doesn't
[53:55] Deliver us we want to let you know we're
[53:57] still not bowing to this image
[54:00] praise the Lord they took a stand why
[54:03] did they take a stand because they had
[54:04] the revelation of the true headship and
[54:06] Nebuchadnezzar was asking them to come
[54:08] under a different headship
[54:10] it was pressure to come under a
[54:12] different headship and worship a
[54:13] different image and worship a different
[54:15] thing just like the image of the beasts
[54:17] of the last days he wants you to come
[54:19] under the Antichrist spirit and worship
[54:20] something different a new version of
[54:22] Jesus Christ a new version of
[54:24] Christianity but they said no we're not
[54:26] doing that we're not worse and so they
[54:28] would not bow to be swayed to worship at
[54:31] that image at the feet of that image
[54:33] that everybody wanted them to and this
[54:35] is what made Satan angry it was their
[54:39] revelation of who to worship it's the
[54:41] revelation of Truth who the true king
[54:43] was can you say Amen they refused to do
[54:46] it even if they died God raises up a
[54:49] people that are not afraid to die for
[54:51] this gospel God raises up young people
[54:54] that are not afraid to stand for the
[54:56] word of God
[54:58] and hold that Revelation in their heart
[55:01] he and then he goes heat up the furnace
[55:03] heat things up out of his Fury make it
[55:06] harder on them make it more scary and he
[55:08] thought by saying you know what I'm
[55:09] going to do I'm going to heat this up
[55:11] seven times hotter and he thought he's
[55:13] looking for a reaction from him and
[55:14] they're still just
[55:17] whatever you need to do
[55:21] but I'm going to heat it seven times
[55:22] hotter
[55:27] whatever you need to do
[55:29] it's kind of like Jesus said to Judas
[55:32] you're delaying this thing whatever you
[55:34] need to do go do it quickly
[55:36] if you're going to try to cause a stir
[55:38] in the church
[55:39] don't wait go ahead and do it manifest
[55:41] what's in your heart
[55:43] get it done that's what he said to Jesus
[55:44] whatever you need to do do it quickly
[55:46] let's get it over with
[55:48] heat it up seven times why don't you try
[55:50] 14 times hotter
[55:53] because it doesn't matter in light of my
[55:55] Revelation it doesn't matter heat it up
[55:57] before the Rapture let it heat up all it
[55:59] wants to
[56:01] and why am I not afraid not because I
[56:03] have the intellectual fortitude to stand
[56:05] here and save young people and save
[56:07] people's lives from the onslaught of the
[56:10] sexual perversion and everything and the
[56:12] in modest of these in modesty of this
[56:14] age I don't have nothing in me to keep
[56:16] people back from that but I've got a
[56:18] word and a holy ghost that'll keep
[56:20] people from it and I'm going to keep
[56:21] preaching it because that's our hope
[56:22] it's the token that kept the death angel
[56:25] away
[56:26] it's the token applied to the home and
[56:29] the front post of the door it's the Holy
[56:31] Ghost the token is the Holy Ghost and
[56:32] I've got that to preach to you and
[56:34] that'll be your protection in this
[56:36] lustful age can somebody say Amen
[56:40] praise the Lord I was going to talk
[56:42] about the sixth sea a little bit but I
[56:43] think you get the message tonight the
[56:45] reason that Satan is getting more and
[56:47] more angry and now just say to you is
[56:50] that you better be in the word you
[56:52] better be standing you better say God
[56:54] give me more Revelation what you what's
[56:57] the most thing you need to pray for not
[56:58] just the people that have cancer not
[57:00] just your your child that's sick pray
[57:02] for anything you can bring to God but
[57:04] you know what he said to pray for more
[57:06] than anything revelation
[57:08] every time you come to church every time
[57:10] you open the word don't just open the
[57:12] word say God drop drop a revelation in
[57:15] my heart pray for Revelation more than
[57:17] you've ever prayed for it because that's
[57:19] the only thing that will get you through
[57:21] the Wiles of the enemy if you already
[57:22] got it raise your hand I already got
[57:24] some Revelations but don't start praying
[57:26] stop praying for more God drop some more
[57:28] in my heart God give me more I'm gonna
[57:30] need it you're going to need it brother
[57:32] Johnny you're going to need it
[57:34] your family's gonna need it all of them
[57:36] you're going to need it next week two
[57:39] weeks from now a month from now things
[57:41] are going to change more pressure is
[57:43] coming what do we need I mean more
[57:45] Revelation Satan is becoming more Angry
[57:48] all the time and we're going to need it
[57:51] praise the Lord
[57:53] was I supposed to say brother Johnny
[57:54] that's what he was when he was two years
[57:56] old in my church
[57:58] I think his brother John now sorry about
[57:59] that bud
[58:02] appreciate his family being with us
[58:03] tonight
[58:05] Hallelujah all right
[58:07] I'm all done
[58:11] Hallelujah I just
[58:14] I like to make the devil more angry
[58:18] settled in my heart
[58:20] there's no fear
[58:22] if you're still in fear say Lord take
[58:24] away my fears
[58:25] perfect love cast out all fear we're in
[58:28] God's hands in this last days we're
[58:30] totally in his hands to Spring your life
[58:32] under that headship of the word young
[58:35] person I know I mentioned the young
[58:36] people a lot tonight I didn't have in my
[58:37] notes but I'm appealing to you bring
[58:39] your life under the headship of that
[58:41] word say God fill me with the oil you
[58:43] know you know what the problem is today
[58:44] people aren't even asking for the Holy
[58:46] Ghost
[58:47] they're not even seeking it and it's the
[58:49] only thing that will get you through
[58:50] this age
[58:52] I think we need some youth that know
[58:54] that they don't have it and they've got
[58:56] a desires the world in their heart you
[58:58] have to ask for the Holy Ghost
[59:00] you have to seek it
[59:02] nobody's even asking for it nobody's
[59:05] even seeking it Where'd you say last
[59:06] time where's the last time I had a
[59:07] prayer line or had someone up for prayer
[59:09] the very few times somebody says they
[59:11] have needs I pray for those needs it's
[59:13] been a long time since I said I'm
[59:14] seeking the Holy Ghost for the Paul and
[59:16] I need you to pray that I received the
[59:17] Holy Ghost
[59:19] you just don't hear it anymore and
[59:20] that's scary to me because
[59:23] that's our key
[59:26] that's our Escape out of here nobody's
[59:28] going out of here without the Holy Ghost
[59:29] the oil
[59:31] that's our Rapture out of this place

[1:02:03] greater is he that is in the Hallelujah
[1:02:07] greater is he that is in me

[1:03:11] roaming to and for yes he is seeking
[1:03:16] whom he may divide
