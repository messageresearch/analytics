[0:22] beautiful building a beautiful place of

[0:31] coming up this way several years ago we
[0:33] visited here
[0:34] my family and i met well several years
[0:36] ago probably 10 11 12 years ago and you
[0:39] all were still in the building
[0:40] i believe maybe two buildings ago and to
[0:43] see what god has done here and bless
[0:45] this church with and i tell you
[0:47] the reason you have what you have is to
[0:49] stand for this message and i
[0:50] i want to say god bless you all we thank
[0:52] you for standing for the word
[0:54] and for the truth and sure want to say
[0:56] appreciate brother josiah mcclearney was
[0:58] up yesterday for the wedding and he
[0:59] offered to drive us up here and he was
[1:02] ministering the deacon from our church
[1:03] there back home so we appreciate him
[1:05] coming and
[1:06] we thank the lord for that and we want
[1:08] to look here in the book of malachi
[1:09] the fourth chapter and in the in the
[1:12] fifth verse i know
[1:14] as message believers we're all familiar
[1:15] with this verse but i just want to pull
[1:17] something out of here the bible says
[1:20] behold i will send you
[1:23] elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:26] the great and dreadful
[1:27] day of the lord and he shall turn the
[1:30] heart of the fathers
[1:31] to the children and the heart of the
[1:34] children to their fathers
[1:36] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[1:38] curse now
[1:39] i know a lot of people read malachi 4 5
[1:42] and 6
[1:43] and a lot of times the only thing they
[1:44] see in there is elijah the prophet but
[1:47] there's actually three different parts
[1:48] being fulfilled here
[1:50] it says i which is god will send you
[1:53] which is the bride of jesus christ
[1:55] elijah the prophet which we believe to
[1:57] be none other than
[1:58] that a man sent from god named william
[2:00] branham but i want you to notice here
[2:03] he actually says i will send you so it's
[2:05] not something you're going to find
[2:07] you're not going to make this man you're
[2:09] not going to make this prophet but god
[2:10] is going to send it
[2:12] so in other words he's going to send you
[2:13] a gift now in the book of ephesians the
[2:15] fourth chapter
[2:17] i want to look there maybe just to pull
[2:20] a few more scriptures here ephesians 4
[2:22] and verse number 8. this is a very
[2:25] familiar scripture
[2:26] in ephesians 4 and verse number 8
[2:31] paul here writing to the ephesians says
[2:33] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[2:35] on high
[2:36] he led captivity captive
[2:42] now that he ascended what is it but he
[2:45] also
[2:45] descended first into the lower parts of
[2:48] the earth
[2:49] now he that descended is the same so
[2:52] that ascended up far above all heavens
[2:55] that he might fill all things
[2:57] notice here what he did he gave some
[2:59] apostles
[3:00] some prophets some evangelists some
[3:03] pastors and teachers
[3:05] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[3:08] work of the ministry
[3:09] for the edifying of the body of christ
[3:12] till we
[3:12] all come in the unity of the faith and
[3:14] of the knowledge of the son of god
[3:17] unto a perfect man unto the stature of
[3:20] the fullness of christ
[3:21] that we henceforth be no more children
[3:23] tossed to and fro
[3:25] carried about with every wind of
[3:26] doctrine by the slave of men
[3:28] and the cunning craftiness whereby they
[3:30] lie and wait to deceive
[3:32] but speaking the truth and all love and
[3:34] love
[3:35] may grow up into him and do all things
[3:37] which is the head
[3:39] even christ now i i love verse 16
[3:42] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[3:44] together so this is not going to be a
[3:46] divided body
[3:47] but it's going to be a body joined
[3:49] together compacted by that which
[3:51] every joint supply according to the
[3:54] effectual working in the measure of
[3:56] every part
[3:57] making increase in the body unto the
[4:00] edifying of itself
[4:02] in love you believe the word this
[4:04] morning we ask the lord to add the
[4:06] blessing to the reading of his word as
[4:07] you
[4:08] may have your seats here for just a few
[4:11] moments
[4:12] from those scriptures today if the lord
[4:13] would help me i'd like to speak to you
[4:15] if i would title this
[4:16] i want to talk to you for a few moments
[4:18] here on operating
[4:20] the gift that god sends you operating
[4:23] the gift that god sends you and maybe
[4:25] just to
[4:26] thank you maybe just to uh to pull up
[4:29] a a thought out of that maybe just speak
[4:31] to you on the power
[4:33] of your pull the power of your pull
[4:35] operating the gift that god sent you i
[4:38] look here at the definition or the
[4:39] meaning of the word operate
[4:41] it means of a person to control the
[4:44] functioning of a machine
[4:46] a meant a process or a system so
[4:48] actually when you're operating something
[4:50] you're actually controlling it or you're
[4:52] you're moving it you're pulling on it
[4:54] you're causing it amen to move in a
[4:56] certain direction now
[4:57] and in the message glorified jesus the
[4:59] prophet of god introduces to us the term
[5:02] the operation of the holy spirit he says
[5:05] now
[5:06] may those without the holy spirit be
[5:08] born again tonight with the holy
[5:10] spirit he said i pray father that all
[5:12] the sick
[5:13] and the afflicted every ones will be
[5:14] healed this night
[5:16] he said get glory out of the service for
[5:18] we commit ourselves
[5:20] amen to thee for the operation of the
[5:22] holy spirit
[5:24] in jesus name how many this morning
[5:26] could say in this service
[5:27] i'm committing myself to you lord amen
[5:30] for the operation of the holy spirit
[5:32] in jesus name another place he says god
[5:35] in his mercy
[5:36] amen through the operation of the holy
[5:39] spirit reveals
[5:40] amen spiritual truth the word itself so
[5:44] amen the holy ghost comes down into the
[5:46] church it's not the
[5:47] it's not the preacher revealing the word
[5:49] he meant but it's the holy ghost himself
[5:52] coming down in the church he meant
[5:54] revealing the word which is the
[5:56] spiritual truth
[5:57] he said another place the holy spirit he
[5:59] meant was up on the church at pentecost
[6:02] and it came right down through that age
[6:04] right on down to the age to the lutheran
[6:06] and the baptist and the methodist on
[6:08] down
[6:09] he meant until in this age here it's
[6:11] still
[6:12] the same holy spirit so he meant that
[6:14] there are no two holy ghosts right
[6:18] there's no two uh there's no two lords
[6:20] there's no two holy ghosts
[6:22] there's no two gospels there's no two
[6:24] bibles amen there is one lord
[6:26] there is one god there is one faith
[6:28] there is one holy ghost
[6:30] amen and it's the same holy spirit that
[6:32] is here in the church this
[6:34] morning amen that was there on the day
[6:36] of pentecost he said then
[6:37] when people's faith gets to a place he
[6:40] said then
[6:41] they'll get the blessings amen to
[6:43] realize it's theirs
[6:45] he meant the same operation of the holy
[6:48] spirit
[6:48] will be operating in the church like it
[6:51] did back there
[6:52] amen just the same so when you when you
[6:54] begin to read the bible you hear about
[6:56] women like mary
[6:57] he meant you hear about women like
[6:59] hannah in the temple all different
[7:00] people in the bible
[7:02] amen that they heard that god could do
[7:04] something they they heard that god had
[7:06] the ability to heal or
[7:07] he had the ability to give child aim
[7:09] into a parent womb
[7:11] he meant they heard about all these
[7:12] things he meant but they didn't know if
[7:14] he could do it for them but then there
[7:15] come a time
[7:17] amen that their faith raised to a level
[7:19] that they was able to claim
[7:21] amen it's not just for the preacher amen
[7:23] it's not just for the priest but it's
[7:25] for me
[7:26] amen see them the purpose in these
[7:27] services is not
[7:29] amen just to come together three times a
[7:31] week or amen to sing a few songs but the
[7:34] purpose in these
[7:34] meetings amen is to preach the word
[7:37] until your faith comes to a level you
[7:40] realize
[7:41] amen it's not just for brother branham
[7:43] and it's not just for brother paul and
[7:45] it's not just for the evangelist
[7:46] amen but god has got something for me
[7:49] amen god has got a blessing for me god
[7:52] amen has got a healing for me all things
[7:54] are still possible
[7:56] amen to them that believe now amen i
[7:58] just want to say it like this the
[7:59] prophet of god will preach a message
[8:01] called
[8:01] amen things that are to be
[8:05] and in that message he says now fake if
[8:07] god in his mercy has the mother
[8:10] he meant before the little baby is born
[8:11] i don't know if you can give me anything
[8:13] on this floor but i'd appreciate it
[8:14] amen this little baby is born it's
[8:17] craving for some vitamin
[8:18] and the mother's word speaks forth he
[8:21] meant dad
[8:22] i want cantaloupe or watermelon i want
[8:24] something another why
[8:26] he'll do everything he can to get that
[8:28] he meant because he wants his child
[8:31] amen to be born as perfect as it can be
[8:33] now think about this
[8:34] he meant a mother carrying a child amen
[8:37] that that sounds good thank you
[8:38] he meant a mother carrying a child he
[8:40] meant wakes up in the middle of the
[8:42] night and she says dad i want cantaloupe
[8:44] or
[8:44] i won't watermelon hey miller maybe she
[8:46] wants a pickle or she wants a hamburger
[8:48] hey now here's the thing amen you've got
[8:51] to get up and you've got to go get it
[8:52] you got to go to the store you got to go
[8:54] to mcdonald's hey you got to go
[8:56] somewhere and get
[8:57] something to satisfy he meant the need
[8:59] you're not a creator you can't just say
[9:01] watermelon be here
[9:02] amen cantaloupe be here amen so you
[9:05] actually got to go and find it you got
[9:07] to go get it
[9:08] he said but notice here amen if a
[9:10] natural father is like that then how
[9:12] much more able her
[9:13] amen is the heavenly father amen for he
[9:16] is a creator amen then this morning if
[9:19] there is a need in your life desiring
[9:21] something
[9:22] from god we don't have to go find it
[9:24] amen we don't have to go dig it up
[9:26] amen we don't have to go hope the store
[9:28] is still open where we can buy it
[9:30] amen but there's something in the house
[9:32] of god amen we can speak the word
[9:35] amen and creation power can come in the
[9:37] church
[9:38] amen and the very thing you have need of
[9:41] amen can be manifested right before you
[9:44] he said he is here he meant to prepare
[9:46] us
[9:47] he meant a body like his own glorious
[9:49] body if we want to live
[9:51] he said then there is something in us
[9:53] that calls
[9:54] a men to live and there is something in
[9:57] us that calls somebody say calls
[10:00] it calls us to do right he said then god
[10:03] will
[10:04] call somebody on the platform or the
[10:07] pulpit
[10:08] that will preach the absolute truth amen
[10:11] see it shows you
[10:13] if you are a real child of god then you
[10:16] begin to cry out
[10:17] amen god take it away from me amen
[10:20] circumcise me from this
[10:22] take these things away from me it's
[10:24] needed for your heavenly home you're
[10:26] going to
[10:27] amen he's gone to prepare because you've
[10:30] got to be a
[10:31] real word bride of christ
[10:35] now think about this if there's
[10:37] something in your heart
[10:38] amen that's calling out to god then god
[10:42] will call a preacher
[10:43] on the platform he meant to preach the
[10:46] absolute truth
[10:47] and when you hear that amen something
[10:50] will cry out
[10:51] lord have been taken away from me now
[10:54] we're living in the day and time
[10:56] where there's two spirits amen that are
[10:58] coming to maturity those
[11:00] two spirits actually begin in the book
[11:03] of genesis one of those spirits
[11:05] amen is the true spirit and the other
[11:07] one is the false spirit now
[11:09] we all know there is a truth to
[11:11] everything right amen and there is a
[11:13] false now
[11:14] now i know people say well amen there's
[11:16] a true five-fold ministry
[11:17] and there is a false faithful ministry
[11:19] and if that if that's really what you
[11:21] want to believe you're an american
[11:22] amen you're entitled to believe whatever
[11:24] you want to amen but let me just say
[11:26] this the problem i have
[11:28] is when people begin to try to identify
[11:30] amen what the true ministry is
[11:32] and what the false ministry is amen but
[11:34] let's not take my opinion
[11:36] or your opinion let's take what a
[11:38] prophet said he said seek the word
[11:40] paraphrasing amen identifies the
[11:43] characteristic of god
[11:44] amen so the characteristic of the true
[11:46] faithful ministry
[11:48] is what the bible says amen as they
[11:50] preach
[11:51] the word amen they preach the word
[11:53] they're instant in season
[11:55] and they're out of season they reprove
[11:57] they rebuke
[11:58] they exhort with all long-suffering and
[12:00] doctrine amen so the true
[12:02] five-fold ministry amen preaches the
[12:05] absolute truth now in the book of john 8
[12:10] 30 chapter 8 verse 31 it said then jesus
[12:13] said to those jews which believed on him
[12:15] if you continue in my word amen then are
[12:19] ye my disciples indeed
[12:20] and ye shall know the truth and the
[12:23] truth shall make you free
[12:25] amen see then what is the truth he meant
[12:28] the truth
[12:29] is the word right amen now the prophet
[12:31] of god says here and i'm just laying the
[12:33] foundation
[12:34] he says now the other vision was
[12:36] contrary to the bible
[12:37] amen bankers was with the bible and god
[12:40] has got to keep his word do you get it
[12:42] he said now what happened to ahab he was
[12:45] killed that day
[12:46] and the dogs licked his blood as the sun
[12:49] went down
[12:50] out of the chair at the pool where they
[12:52] washed in the night that's true
[12:54] he said for one man who took god's word
[12:57] his vision lined up with god's word and
[13:00] it was perfect
[13:01] it was the absolute truth he said a
[13:04] vision must line up with god's word
[13:07] amen and a preacher amen must line up
[13:10] with god's word
[13:11] no matter what we think what we are the
[13:13] conditions of the country the crowd
[13:16] whatever it is amen we must line up
[13:19] amen with god's word so amen amen a
[13:22] preacher can't be half-hearted
[13:24] he meant a preacher can't have his own
[13:25] ideas and his own objectives and his own
[13:28] agendas
[13:28] he meant a preacher has got to line up
[13:31] with god's word
[13:32] he meant because he has got to bring the
[13:34] church in line with the same word
[13:37] now the prophet says like this he said
[13:39] those pharisees believed in many things
[13:41] and they believed it to be the truth he
[13:43] said they said
[13:45] we are god's children now watch this and
[13:47] they were
[13:48] until somebody say they were until
[13:53] they were until the word was preached
[13:55] and when the word was preached and
[13:57] vindicated
[13:58] then they become sinners amen for
[14:01] rejecting the thing
[14:03] that they know was right and they
[14:05] witnessed that
[14:06] they said we know that our teacher come
[14:08] from god and no man can do the things
[14:10] you do
[14:11] amen without god being in you now think
[14:13] about this amen they were the children
[14:16] of god until the word was preached and
[14:19] the attitude they took
[14:20] he meant towards the preached word which
[14:23] was vindicated and witnessed by god
[14:25] amen it changed them amen from being
[14:28] children
[14:29] into being sinners he meant by rejecting
[14:31] the word preached
[14:32] he meant if somebody can hear the word
[14:35] and can reject the word
[14:37] and can change the condition of their
[14:39] life amen then what can happen to
[14:41] somebody
[14:42] amen that hears the word but they don't
[14:44] reject the word
[14:46] amen they receive the word they accept
[14:48] the word
[14:49] they believe the word i'll tell you what
[14:51] it'll do it'll change you from
[14:53] depression
[14:54] amen to joy it'll it'll change you from
[14:56] sickness
[14:57] into health it'll change you from doubt
[15:00] into faith
[15:01] amen the word preached has still got the
[15:04] power
[15:05] to change the church now now let me just
[15:08] say this
[15:09] amen god has still got preachers
[15:16] he's still got preachers and they're not
[15:18] sissified preachers
[15:21] well that's a quote he said we just
[15:23] asked the ministers now i want you to
[15:25] hear this i'm
[15:26] just laying the foundation if that's
[15:27] okay he said i want you to hear this
[15:29] he said is there any ministers here
[15:31] that's in the building tonight that
[15:33] believes this message i preached
[15:35] he said these creeds and man-made
[15:36] doctrines today is not of god
[15:39] but they are of man he said and we
[15:41] really ought to go back to the bible way
[15:43] go back to the beginning i want some of
[15:46] those ministers
[15:47] amen to walk forward and stand here with
[15:50] me while we lay hands
[15:51] and pray for these people here he said
[15:53] on these on these people
[15:55] seeking for god's great blessing on
[15:56] their life he said some of you ministers
[15:58] if you will
[15:59] that believes this to be the vital truth
[16:02] he said don't come no other way see
[16:04] amen be a man
[16:08] who believes it to be the absolute truth
[16:11] amen now now that that is a that is a
[16:14] very powerful quote to me when a prophet
[16:16] says
[16:16] amen be a man and i i looked up what is
[16:18] that what does the definition
[16:20] of that phrase be a man me it means to
[16:23] put up with something
[16:24] amen or take responsibility for it he
[16:27] meant to deal with something
[16:28] amen such as pain or misfortune
[16:32] he meant without complaining so amen god
[16:35] is looking for preachers amen who will
[16:37] be men with this message
[16:39] amen god is looking for preachers who
[16:41] will stand toe to toe with the devil
[16:44] and will declare that god's word is
[16:46] still supreme above everything else
[16:48] amen he's looking for people who will
[16:50] take responsibility
[16:52] in the message a man running from the
[16:54] presence of the lord he said when you
[16:56] see this then in this day now
[16:57] when the word of god has made these
[16:59] promises of these things
[17:01] that we see happening now then we've got
[17:04] the responsibility
[17:05] he meant to either face up to it or get
[17:07] away from it
[17:08] you just can't stay neutral you've got
[17:11] to do something about it
[17:12] he meant something has got to be made a
[17:15] decision
[17:16] you cannot come in that church door and
[17:18] go out
[17:19] the same person you came in you're
[17:21] either going to leave better
[17:23] amen or worse you're going to leave
[17:25] further away amen are closer to god
[17:27] he said and how people amen shirt the
[17:30] responsibility
[17:32] amen now let me just preach to you for a
[17:34] second amen because i think if we really
[17:36] got a revelation of what a prophet is
[17:38] saying
[17:38] it would change the way we act in church
[17:41] amen it would be more than just coming
[17:43] and sitting on the pew and watching the
[17:45] preacher and saying well we're just here
[17:46] for a little intellectual gathering
[17:48] amen i think it would put a fire amen in
[17:51] more than the pulpit

[18:01] things that your pastor

[18:05] put together amen to show you that they

[20:00] ain't going to be a new building
[20:01] it'll be when believers amen can lay
[20:04] aside their own ideas
[20:05] and their own thoughts about what they
[20:07] think church ought to be and take what
[20:09] the bible says church ought to be
[20:11] and the bible said i would that all men
[20:13] would come together
[20:14] and would lift up holy hands and would
[20:17] give praises unto god
[20:18] listen friends amen this is not a social
[20:21] hall

[20:29] the very secrets of your heart
[20:33] now it amazes me that we it
[20:36] is it's okay it amazes me amen that
[20:40] we've let we've let the devil come in

[21:01] bitterness he'll get all mad at you
[21:03] amen brother paul you get close to their
[21:04] personal life amen well they're going to
[21:06] go find another church
[21:08] amen but let me remind you amen the
[21:10] bible has not changed what the word says
[21:13] that the house of god is still a house
[21:16] of correction
[21:18] well hello somebody amen the house of
[21:21] god
[21:22] is still a house of correction i believe
[21:24] in positivity
[21:26] i believe in preaching faith i believe
[21:28] in shouting
[21:29] i believe in rejoicing amen but if we
[21:31] ever back off
[21:32] amen of keeping the house of god amen
[21:35] clean
[21:35] and decent and in order we have backing
[21:38] off of the commission that god give the
[21:40] church

[21:44] this thank god for men of god who have
[21:46] not
[21:47] shirked the responsibility amen thank
[21:49] god for pastors
[21:51] that has not shirked their
[21:52] responsibility amen now
[21:54] amen i'm not preacher for a second amen
[21:56] because the devil wants to shut the
[21:58] pastures up
[21:59] he meant because if he can shut the
[22:00] pastures up and then there'll be no
[22:03] voice
[22:03] amen crying out against sin and
[22:05] ungodliness
[22:06] and unclean living in the house of god
[22:09] if he can set the pastor up
[22:11] there'll be no voice amen in the
[22:13] watchtower amen screaming about the
[22:15] enemy that is coming
[22:16] amen but i say god amen give our pastors
[22:19] the voices of angels
[22:20] amen give them the strength amen give
[22:23] them the courage
[22:24] amen give them the nerve and then give
[22:26] them the courage and boldness
[22:27] amen to stand and to declare god's word
[22:30] if it hurts our feelings if it hurts our
[22:33] families feelings
[22:34] if it hurts our pride how many will say
[22:36] i'm not here
[22:37] ain't meant to have my ego stroke and to
[22:39] be told how good i
[22:41] am i am here for one purpose and that is
[22:43] god
[22:44] you cut away and circumcise amen
[22:47] everything from my heart
[22:49] and is unlike you until the holy ghost
[22:52] amen can claim my vessel i can be more
[22:54] than a church member
[22:56] i can be more than a pew sitter i can be
[22:58] a messiah ant
[23:03] sir amen god give us preachers amen that
[23:06] will preach the word
[23:07] amen now let me say this god amen has
[23:10] sinned us some wonderful things
[23:11] amen i am thankful amen for everything
[23:14] god has sent us
[23:15] can i say it like this we ought to be
[23:17] faithful amen for what god
[23:19] has sent amen what god is sending and
[23:22] what god will continue to sin
[23:25] what are you saying i'll say this i am
[23:28] thankful for god
[23:29] anybody can i get a witness here anybody
[23:32] else thankful for god
[23:34] i am thankful for god i am thankful for
[23:37] the message
[23:40] i'm thankful for the messenger but you
[23:43] know what
[23:44] i am thankful amen for faithful
[23:46] preachers
[23:47] amen who are under the final messenger
[23:49] and they are
[23:50] boldly preaching the message i'm
[23:53] thankful for god
[23:54] i'm thankful for the messenger i'm
[23:56] thankful for the message he sent us
[23:58] amen but i am thankful that god has
[24:00] still got a voice
[24:02] in the land today now when you begin to
[24:04] realize this you'll see
[24:05] amen that every service amen is a
[24:08] service you ought to be thankful for
[24:10] every service is another space amen
[24:13] in time that god has allowed us to have
[24:16] now the bible says in revelation 2 21
[24:18] i gave her space amen to repent of her
[24:21] fornication
[24:22] and she repented not now that word space
[24:25] there
[24:26] it means time it means season it means a
[24:28] while
[24:29] it means often times it's either time
[24:32] long
[24:32] or short amen so every service amen is
[24:36] is another space
[24:37] amen if there's not something right to
[24:40] make it right
[24:41] every service is another space if the
[24:44] devil has brought something in your
[24:46] life that you know shouldn't be there
[24:48] amen it's another space to get rid of it
[24:50] amen amen now this this may be a little
[24:52] bit different but i'm just preaching
[24:53] what the lord put on my heart okay
[24:55] amen it used to be amen when people
[24:57] heard the preacher preach about sin
[24:59] and ungodliness if a preacher ever hit
[25:02] television one time
[25:03] he mean it used to be people couldn't
[25:05] wait to get home and kick the thing out
[25:07] of the house
[25:07] amen you know the devil's turned the
[25:09] tide he mean you let the pastor strike
[25:11] something
[25:12] and instead of getting mad at the devil
[25:13] they get mad at the preacher
[25:16] well hello somebody instead of getting
[25:18] mad at the devil
[25:19] they get mad at the preacher preaching
[25:21] but you ought to be rejoicing
[25:23] amen that god give you another space
[25:26] amen to hear the truth and give you
[25:28] another opportunity
[25:30] amen to be released from the thing the
[25:32] devil's trying to hang over your head
[25:34] now the prophet of god said do you know
[25:36] that this church speaking of this church
[25:38] was more wicked than they have
[25:39] do you know that she that he repented
[25:41] for a while and he walked softly before
[25:43] god
[25:44] he said you cannot say that about this
[25:45] catholic church she never repented
[25:48] but she has stubbornly destroyed any and
[25:51] all
[25:51] who tried to help her repent that is
[25:54] history
[25:55] now god kept raising up not only
[25:57] messengers to each age
[25:59] but he raised up some wonderful helps
[26:01] amen
[26:02] of those messengers he gave every age
[26:04] some wonderful men of god
[26:06] and they did everything they could a
[26:08] meant to bring the church back to god
[26:10] amen god certainly gave her opportunity
[26:14] and he gave her help to repent amen do
[26:17] you realize that the pastor
[26:18] amen is not just here for a job amen
[26:21] he's not just here
[26:22] amen to visit you in the hospital amen
[26:24] and to see it
[26:25] as you walk across the graduation stage
[26:28] amen but he is here and let me just take
[26:30] some liberty and say
[26:31] a pastor's word amen should not be
[26:34] subject to a psychologist's word
[26:36] a pastor's word for your family amen
[26:38] should not be subject to what some
[26:40] doctor thinks
[26:41] amen if god gives you a holy
[26:42] ghost-filled pastor and i believe he did
[26:45] you ought to raise his word above the
[26:47] words of a school teacher
[26:49] above the words of a psychologist amen
[26:51] because his words
[26:53] are not coming from a school amen his
[26:55] words is coming
[26:56] from the inspiration of the holy ghost
[27:00] amen he give another space he meant
[27:02] another opportunity to repent
[27:05] now watch this amen but did she repent
[27:07] by her fruits no sir
[27:09] she never has she never will she has
[27:12] lost her senses
[27:14] in spiritual things do you realize every
[27:16] time
[27:17] that you turn down another space to
[27:19] repent is another desensitizing
[27:22] amen to the spiritual side of your life
[27:25] remember the problem god talked about
[27:26] the young girl
[27:27] and he said young girl tonight you're
[27:28] not amen to give your heart to the lord
[27:31] he said she laughed and she walked out
[27:33] he said two years from then
[27:35] i saw her and she had a she had a look
[27:38] on her face
[27:39] he said and i asked her don't i know you
[27:41] and she said
[27:42] yeah preach you do she said won't you
[27:44] come up to my room and let me give you a
[27:46] drink
[27:46] and let me give you some hey let me let
[27:48] me let me entertain you
[27:50] he said how dare you amen offer a man of
[27:53] god such as that
[27:54] she said do you remember that meeting
[27:56] that night he said yes sir
[27:58] yes ma'am i do she said do you remember
[28:00] when you called me out he said how can i
[28:02] forget
[28:03] she said if you ever made it right you
[28:06] made it right that night
[28:07] she said and ever since that time he
[28:10] meant i
[28:10] laughed and walked away and i could see
[28:13] my mother's soul
[28:14] he meant fry in hell like a pancake and
[28:17] i would laugh at it
[28:19] what did he say he said she crossed the
[28:22] line
[28:23] he meant between repentance amen in the
[28:25] judgment of god
[28:26] she crossed the line between the mercy
[28:29] of god
[28:30] and the judgment of god he meant she
[28:32] send her day away to repent
[28:34] oh church amen i don't know what i'm
[28:36] bouncing against right now but it's a
[28:37] spirit
[28:38] amen i'm going to bounce against it amen
[28:40] how much longer are you going to carry
[28:42] amen that unforgiveness in your hearts
[28:44] how much longer are you going to carry
[28:46] that bitterness
[28:47] amen well somebody hurt me and somebody
[28:49] amen this
[28:50] is the season amen this is the time amen
[28:53] this is the
[28:54] hour amen to get rid of everything in
[28:56] our lives that is unlike god
[28:59] and let the holy ghost fall through us
[29:03] amen this is the time to repent now now
[29:06] i know people don't like repenting
[29:07] services anymore
[29:08] amen but they're still in the bible amen
[29:11] amen the prophet god said this heal at
[29:12] this age is to cry what
[29:14] i am wrong amen that's a hard thing to
[29:16] say in the world that says everybody's
[29:18] right
[29:18] amen but it's still in the message amen
[29:21] somebody's wrong
[29:22] and somebody's right and can i say what
[29:24] i believe i believe everything is wrong
[29:26] and the message is right
[29:28] amen i believe every preacher amen ever
[29:30] ever psychologist ever ever theologian
[29:33] ever
[29:33] ever seminary professor every one of
[29:35] them is wrong and william branham's
[29:37] message is right
[29:38] because it's not coming from the devil
[29:41] it's coming from god
[29:42] now when you begin to realize amen that
[29:44] this is more than a service
[29:46] this is more than a few songs this is
[29:48] more than putting some money in the
[29:49] offering plate
[29:50] amen this is more than just hearing a
[29:52] sermon but this is a
[29:54] place where lives can be changed amen
[29:56] we're souls
[29:57] amen can be free from the bondages of
[30:00] sin
[30:00] that it'll change your attitude towards
[30:03] the way you come to church
[30:07] hello can i tell you what the bible says
[30:10] amen the bible says the voice of joy and
[30:12] the voice of gladness
[30:14] and the voice of the bridegroom and the
[30:16] voice of the bride and the voice of them
[30:17] shall say
[30:18] praise the lord of hosts amen for the
[30:20] lord is good
[30:21] for his mercy endureth forever and of
[30:24] them that shall bring
[30:25] amen the sacrifice of praise
[30:28] into the house of the lord
[30:32] amen so when you come in the house of
[30:35] god you should not bring the sacrifice
[30:38] amen of unbelief and the sacrifice of
[30:40] negativity
[30:43] but you should bring the sacrifice
[30:47] of praise into the house now i think
[30:50] it's amazing how
[30:51] that in the bible you'll see there were
[30:52] three magis and the bible says when they
[30:55] come to the lord
[30:56] amen they brought gifts and the prophet
[30:58] comes along
[30:59] and he says what gifts do they bring he
[31:01] said they brought gold
[31:02] they brought frankincense and they
[31:04] brought myrrh he said see what they did
[31:06] was they brought to him what they
[31:09] thought of him
[31:10] he said what it was was gold was deity
[31:12] amen frankincense came it was service
[31:15] and myrrh was death he said so they come
[31:18] to him realizing
[31:19] he was deity in service to die
[31:23] amen now watch this amen and i say today
[31:26] the things we bring to him
[31:27] identifies our thoughts is about him you
[31:30] understand
[31:31] if you believe it with all of your heart
[31:33] every word of god
[31:35] you'll identify it amen by giving all
[31:37] that you have to it
[31:39] but if you don't believe it if you
[31:40] believe it's just a good place to
[31:42] associate
[31:43] with better people around church and
[31:44] things like that that's just about what
[31:46] you'll give
[31:47] he said just a few social hours with
[31:49] some of the congregation
[31:50] but if you really believe it with all of
[31:53] your heart
[31:54] then you get everything that's in you
[31:56] amen to it see
[31:58] and it identifies that you truly believe
[32:01] the message you believe it to be the
[32:04] truth
[32:05] if you really believe amen that this
[32:07] message is the truth
[32:09] if you really believe that the holy
[32:11] ghost amen is still in the church
[32:13] if you really believe in signs and
[32:15] wonders and mighty manifestation
[32:17] amen do you realize if an unbeliever
[32:19] come in here
[32:20] if you really believed it they wouldn't
[32:22] even have to ask you gideon what you
[32:24] believe
[32:24] he meant by your action in the house of
[32:27] god
[32:28] it will testify what you really believe
[32:30] amen
[32:31] brother paul's up here preaching his
[32:32] heart out and you're sleeping
[32:34] it shows amen you've not given your all
[32:36] to this service
[32:37] amen that brother paul is laboring in
[32:39] the word and you've got a frown on your
[32:41] face and you're mad
[32:42] amen it shows that you're not
[32:44] identifying yourself
[32:45] amen with the word that's being preached
[32:47] amen but you're looking at one preacher
[32:49] right here that still believes
[32:51] amen i want the world to know i want
[32:53] hell to know
[32:54] i want the angels to know i want the
[32:56] demons to know i want everybody around
[32:59] me to know
[33:00] when i hear the word i identify myself
[33:03] with the word i am hearing
[33:06] [Applause]
[33:08] hey you know what the bible said in
[33:10] nehemiah the bible says when ezra stood
[33:12] up and read the scroll
[33:13] amen the whole congregation said
[33:17] well we forgot that word amen amen think
[33:20] about that
[33:21] ezra read the word and the whole church
[33:23] said amen
[33:24] you know why because they wanted every
[33:26] onlooker to see
[33:28] i identify with what's being said i
[33:31] believe what's being said
[33:33] amen i'll say this amen we need to get
[33:35] our amen back in the house of god amen
[33:38] we need to get the ability
[33:39] amen to back the word back in the house
[33:41] of god hey
[33:43] hey can i preach to you for a second
[33:45] amen if the preacher says
[33:46] amen this message is right every
[33:49] believer that believes it
[33:50] ought to put a wholehearted amen behind
[33:52] it if the preacher says
[33:54] amen that ungodliness is still wrong
[33:56] every holy ghost clean living individual
[33:58] in the church ought to put their whole
[34:00] heart behind it because
[34:02] god has sent a gift to you he meant to
[34:05] manifest his life in you
[34:07] and to bring you to a place of
[34:08] edification and perfection
[34:11] amen see satan does not want this
[34:13] message preached
[34:14] he hates this message being preached and
[34:17] there is a reason why
[34:18] he does not want this message preached
[34:20] there is a reason why he don't want you
[34:22] to hear it
[34:23] or there's another reason he don't want
[34:25] you to pull
[34:26] on the gift that's preaching it
[34:29] amen now let me just let you in a little
[34:31] secret you're operating this service
[34:33] this morning
[34:36] you may not even realize that but you're

[40:54] the seventh seal or preach on daniel 70
[40:58] weeks or something

[41:14] or you can say god you know what you're
[41:16] up to and you know what you can do
[41:21] that preacher can be a thousand miles on
[41:24] the other side of every fault you're
[41:26] having
[41:26] but if you begin to pull on god and you
[41:29] begin to say lord
[41:30] i need an answer amen lord i need a word
[41:33] amen lord i need a breakthrough amen
[41:35] lord i need to hear an answer to this
[41:37] question
[41:38] is this message for me amen i've been
[41:40] fellowshipping with you all week long
[41:41] lord
[41:42] i haven't talked to brother paul i
[41:44] haven't talked to the preacher
[41:45] they don't know the questions and the
[41:47] thoughts it's up on my heart but you do
[41:49] lord
[41:49] and i need to hear something from you
[41:51] and you know what you begin to pull on
[41:53] god
[41:54] you begin to pull on god you know what
[41:55] you can do you can get a hold
[41:58] of the man that's putting the words in
[42:00] the preacher's mouth
[42:02] [Applause]
[42:04] you can get a hold of the man that has
[42:06] put the words
[42:07] in the preacher's mouth and i have seen
[42:10] god amen
[42:11] change the direction of an entire
[42:12] service amen to answer one question
[42:15] now let me just say this if the devil
[42:17] can put you to sleep
[42:18] you'll never get your answer if he can
[42:20] put your mind somewhere else
[42:22] you'll never get your answer but if
[42:23] you'll begin to push through
[42:25] if you'll begin to break through if
[42:27] you'll begin to say god
[42:28] i'm not backing up i'm not giving in i'm
[42:31] not quitting
[42:32] i'm not turning around i come here for a
[42:35] conference with you
[42:36] and you're still god amen you can still
[42:39] put the answer
[42:40] to my question in the mouth of your
[42:42] servant
[42:44] well brother andrew we really don't have
[42:46] much power let me say this
[42:48] there is a hidden power in this message
[42:50] the prophet said
[42:51] amen there's no power and steeples
[42:53] there's no power and pretty pews
[42:55] and there's no power in best stress
[42:56] crowds he said but it takes a hidden
[42:58] power
[42:59] of the spirit of god amen to break the
[43:01] toehold
[43:02] he meant that word in there to break the
[43:05] hold
[43:06] so it's not the personality of the
[43:08] preacher that'll break the toehold
[43:10] it's not the it's not the fanciness of
[43:12] how he says his words
[43:14] that'll break the toehold it's the word
[43:18] glory it's the word being preached
[43:21] that will break the stronghold remember
[43:23] told the story about the lawyer that
[43:25] time
[43:25] who went in the courtroom and he stood
[43:27] there and he cried and he boo-hooed
[43:29] and he hollered and the promise said
[43:31] when he got done he said the judge
[43:33] looked at him and said is that all you
[43:34] got
[43:35] he said well i did what i did what
[43:36] somebody else did he said sir
[43:39] it takes more than just all the emotions
[43:42] he meant to to win the case
[43:43] he said there's got to be some law in
[43:45] there now i know people love to take
[43:47] that quote and say well away with
[43:48] emotions and i say away with that
[43:50] nonsense too
[43:52] what do you saying away with the
[43:53] nonsense of saying we don't need emotion
[43:55] in the house of god
[43:57] anything without emotion is dead come on
[44:01] church
[44:02] anything without emotion is there amen
[44:04] brother paul they want
[44:05] they want dead song services they want
[44:08] dead musicians
[44:09] amen but you know what i don't like
[44:10] going to a church service amen and
[44:12] singing songs that makes me think i'm in
[44:14] a funeral home
[44:16] and i like some music that's got some
[44:18] beat to it i like some music that's got
[44:20] some feeling in it
[44:21] come on church amen let me just let you
[44:23] in a little secret if you don't enjoy
[44:25] what you're doing
[44:26] don't worry you won't be doing it long
[44:28] if you don't enjoy
[44:29] serving god don't worry because nobody
[44:32] will continue doing something
[44:33] that they don't enjoy doing but if you
[44:36] enjoy it
[44:37] something has gripped you you know what
[44:39] brother paul can i put
[44:40] my voice on record with your voice i
[44:42] enjoy holy ghost singing
[44:44] i enjoy music it's got some feeling in
[44:47] it
[44:47] amen this is not a house of mourning
[44:49] this is a house of worship
[44:51] this is a place where there ought to be
[44:53] a free spirit
[44:54] where there ought to be a free yield to
[44:56] let the spirit of god
[44:58] have been to move in the freedom and the
[45:00] authority of the holy ghost
[45:04] i believe in emotion but there's got to
[45:05] be some word in there
[45:08] and the prophet said see it takes the
[45:10] word to break the stronghold of the
[45:12] devil
[45:12] amen do you realize what pentecost did
[45:14] amen pentecost
[45:16] even give 120 cowards
[45:20] the boldness to stand up
[45:25] hey go ahead well can i just tell you
[45:29] what the prophet said
[45:30] he said they went up there a bunch of
[45:32] cowards he said but brother after he
[45:34] went up to pentecost speaking of peter
[45:36] he had a courage to put on the whole
[45:38] armor of god
[45:39] he said now watch what is it the word
[45:42] that he had walked with
[45:43] was in him burning him up with fire
[45:46] in his flesh and soul he had the whole
[45:49] armor of god on
[45:50] what is it god makes himself ever
[45:53] present
[45:54] in his own army he is with us he is in
[45:57] us that's the armor
[45:58] he is the word he is the holy spirit and
[46:01] the holy spirit is in
[46:03] us which is the word making the promise
[46:06] manifest
[46:07] for the spirit quickens the word he said
[46:09] what happened
[46:10] he said david met goliath and he picked
[46:13] up five stones
[46:14] and a slingshot and here he comes
[46:16] because something
[46:18] is fixing to happen because there's the
[46:20] word let's say this together
[46:22] the word the promise and the power
[46:26] david had the word the promise and the
[46:29] power
[46:30] and notice this to sling it that's what
[46:32] we need today
[46:34] is a man that will take god's word with
[46:36] the power
[46:37] of the holy ghost behind him he meant to
[46:40] press it out there
[46:41] and to watch it come to pass
[46:45] are you hear me god is looking for some
[46:47] men today
[46:48] that's got the courage amen to sling the
[46:51] word out there
[46:52] and to press and to press and to press
[46:56] until it comes to pass now brother paul
[46:58] any of you preachers here know
[47:00] that sometimes you preach and it feels
[47:02] like you're preaching against the wall
[47:07] ever been there it feels like you're
[47:09] literally
[47:10] amen pushing against the wall it feels
[47:13] like you're the only one
[47:14] that's doing anything to push but you
[47:16] know what you don't do
[47:17] you don't close your bible and say well
[47:18] we'll try again sunday or we'll try
[47:20] again next week
[47:21] you stand there and you keep on pushing
[47:24] and you keep on pushing
[47:25] and brother as you keep on pressing and
[47:27] you keep on pressing
[47:29] because you know if i just keep pressing
[47:32] before long that wall will come down
[47:35] amen you know how you can stand there
[47:36] and say that because i've seen it happen
[47:39] before
[47:43] hell is it the truth
[47:46] the word will still defeat the devil
[47:49] anywhere anytime under any condition
[47:53] he said see just throw it out there and
[47:55] keep on pressing
[47:57] and it'll come to pass his word of fire
[48:00] his army dressed
[48:01] with the ever present of himself amen so
[48:04] god has got preachers
[48:05] that are preaching the word the promise
[48:08] and the power
[48:09] amen they're preaching the word they're
[48:11] preaching the promise
[48:12] and they're preaching the power and
[48:14] those three together
[48:16] is causing devils to fall
[48:20] causing the walls to come down
[48:24] are you hearing me are you with me this
[48:26] morning see you've got
[48:27] you've got to keep on pressing because
[48:29] the word will still
[48:31] bring the enemy down that's why the
[48:33] devil don't want the word preached
[48:37] can i give you a testimony the devil
[48:39] don't want the word preached
[48:40] because it's through the preaching of
[48:42] the word that demons are cast out
[48:45] i was preaching in a meeting not long
[48:46] ago and while i was preaching
[48:48] amen the holy ghost just come to my
[48:50] heart so strong and said deal with the
[48:52] spirit
[48:53] and i begin to deal with a spirit of
[48:54] lust and a spirit of pornography
[48:56] how it'll come in a home
[49:00] how it will destroy a marriage how it
[49:02] will destroy a teenager
[49:04] how it'll kind of help put your mind in
[49:07] prison
[49:07] amen brother i didn't know why i was
[49:09] going that way amen but about that time
[49:11] there was a brother in the back
[49:12] he jumped up and he threw his arm out
[49:14] like that and he said i'm free
[49:20] are you awake this morning that might
[49:22] have not meant to nobody else around him
[49:24] but that was an answer you know what he
[49:26] did he called me he said andrew
[49:28] i've been battling those two spirits
[49:30] amen for months
[49:31] and the devil never said i would get
[49:33] free and he said so i had accepted
[49:35] just to live with it and try to control
[49:37] it he said but when the holy ghost spoke
[49:39] out of you
[49:40] and said you don't have to live with
[49:41] that death when you was called to defeat
[49:44] it he said that was my answer he said i
[49:46] got my breakthrough
[49:47] oh church he's still god this morning
[49:50] his word is still true this morning he
[49:53] is spoiled shady i
[49:55] if you need an answer amen push through
[49:58] come on woman with the issue of blood
[50:00] they don't want you to get to jesus but
[50:02] you know i've got to get to jesus
[50:04] if i don't get to jesus i'm going to die
[50:07] oh church of the living god
[50:08] when you get desperate enough to get to
[50:10] jesus you'll shake off formalism
[50:12] you'll shake off ideas you'll forget
[50:14] your recipes
[50:15] you'll forget your pride because you
[50:17] know if i don't get to jesus
[50:20] amen i'm going to be pale the rest of my
[50:22] life but if i ever get this presence
[50:26] come on church amen if i ever get this
[50:29] presents
[50:29] you know what sometimes you got to do
[50:31] you got to press through but when you
[50:32] get there that's all that matters
[50:36] sometimes you got to press through to
[50:38] leave that song service
[50:40] because there's people in there that
[50:41] need a victory there's people in there
[50:43] that need a lifting in their spirit
[50:45] and the devil don't want to get it so
[50:47] you know what he'll do he'll put bars
[50:49] and bars and bars and bars amen the
[50:52] gideon i'll tell you this keep on
[50:54] singing
[50:55] because before long the witness of
[50:57] heaven will open up
[50:58] brother paul there'll be times that look
[51:00] like nothing's happening
[51:01] but can i give you something this
[51:02] morning keep on preaching amen because
[51:05] before long
[51:06] the witness of heaven will open oh come
[51:08] on church there'll be services you don't
[51:10] feel like saying amen
[51:12] but keep on saying it amen keep on
[51:14] blowing
[51:15] keep on pulling keep on pressing keep on
[51:17] pushing
[51:18] keep on believing keep on worshiping
[51:20] keep on praising
[51:22] and before long you'll step out of that
[51:24] realm into an untapped resource
[51:26] where all things are possible there's
[51:28] unlimited revival
[51:30] [Applause]
[51:32] oh somebody giving some praise
[51:35] somebody give him some worship i'm
[51:38] talking about a church
[51:39] that believes god is still god and his
[51:42] word is still true
[51:43] and his power is still here and his
[51:45] spirit is still manifesting itself
[51:48] amen god is still sending preachers
[51:51] and services to give the people another
[51:54] space
[51:58] now when you realize this sometimes it's
[52:00] not going to be easy to get there
[52:06] sometimes you're gonna have to draw your
[52:08] sword
[52:11] and stand toe-to-toe with the devil and
[52:13] say i'm not leaving here till i get a
[52:16] blessing
[52:22] i'm preaching to you this morning
[52:29] 50 60 years the prophet's been off
[52:31] the scene
[52:34] the message is around the world
[52:41] and it's harder to get to church now
[52:42] than it's ever been before
[52:47] is that a coincidence all right
[52:50] well over here we might as well preach
[52:54] harder now to get the service than it
[52:55] ever was before all right
[52:58] over there i raised my hands i'd shout
[53:00] amen but i might spread covet
[53:05] oh brother andrew i'll tell you what i'd
[53:06] sing a special but the person sung
[53:08] before me had the microphone they might
[53:09] have cold
[53:12] well i'm cutting now you know what for
[53:14] that i'll tell you what he meant i'd
[53:15] come to church but but you know what i
[53:17] i i just i just i just need to stay home
[53:21] it's the devil doing that it's a spirit
[53:24] of fear to bind the church
[53:27] here's my question how long are you
[53:29] going to lay down to it
[53:33] how many more services are you going to
[53:35] let the devil rob you of getting a
[53:37] blessing
[53:37] because of the fear remember that and i
[53:40] tell you what
[53:41] i i'd go shake the preacher's hand and
[53:43] i'd go fellowship with my brothers and
[53:44] sisters but i'm afraid
[53:46] it's the devil trying to bind you amen
[53:49] from enjoying what god has sent you
[53:53] now let me just say this he a father
[53:56] leaves his son an inheritance right do
[53:58] you realize
[53:59] no other father has a right to tell that
[54:02] child
[54:03] what to do with his inheritance if
[54:06] brother paul
[54:07] amen leaves gideon an inheritance amen
[54:09] brother ken
[54:10] you don't have a right to come tell
[54:12] gideon what he can do with this
[54:13] inheritance
[54:14] are you following me because it's not
[54:16] his position to say
[54:17] you can't do this and you can't do that
[54:19] his father left him in heritage
[54:22] if brother paul left getting the
[54:23] corvette and said you can go the
[54:25] speedway and drive at 80 miles an hour
[54:27] even brother kenny's got no right to say
[54:29] gideon you can't drive at 80 miles an
[54:31] hour amen because the father
[54:33] left it in the inheritance he left it in
[54:35] the wheel
[54:36] and he sent the inheritance to the sun
[54:38] amen what are you saying preacher
[54:40] i'm saying the devil has no right
[54:43] he meant to tell the church of the
[54:45] living god
[54:46] what we can do with the inheritance that
[54:49] our father died for us to have
[54:53] do you realize our father died that we
[54:55] could preach the gospel
[54:57] our father died that we could lay hands
[54:59] on the sick
[55:00] and they could recover our father died
[55:03] that we could speak in tongues
[55:04] we could see visions we could prophesy
[55:07] we could sing songs
[55:09] we could have the joy and the gladness
[55:11] and the church
[55:12] our father died and he put it in the
[55:15] wheel
[55:15] and he sent a gift to interpret the will
[55:17] to us and the devil has no
[55:20] business telling the church what they
[55:22] can do
[55:23] with the inheritance god left her
[55:27] now let me just say this even christ has
[55:30] left the church
[55:31] some wonderful gifts but you realize the
[55:34] greatest gift he gave
[55:35] was himself can i have a few more
[55:38] minutes
[55:39] john 3 16 for god so loved the world
[55:42] that he gave somebody say he gave his
[55:44] only begotten son
[55:46] that whosoever believeth in him should
[55:49] not perish
[55:53] but have everlasting
[55:57] life the prophet said jesus was the
[55:59] greatest gift god ever give
[56:00] the earth the world amen now people have
[56:03] faith in it see there's the key
[56:05] the people have faith in it because
[56:07] god's gifts
[56:08] are always looked down by the modern
[56:11] religious world
[56:12] amen you can have all the gifts of the
[56:14] world you can have all the gifts of the
[56:16] word
[56:16] but unless you have faith in that gift
[56:18] it'll never operate
[56:20] let me just go through the scriptures
[56:21] here and can i are you awake
[56:25] can i can i read you some things that
[56:27] your father sent you
[56:28] can i read you some gifts he sent you
[56:30] this he said i will give you rest
[56:33] in matthew 11. in matthew 16 he said i

[56:37] the keys of the kingdom of heaven in
[56:39] luke 10
[56:40] he said i give unto you power amen to
[56:43] tread upon serpents and scorpions
[56:45] in john 14 he said the water that i
[56:47] shall give him
[56:48] shall be in him a well springing up
[56:52] into everlasting life in john 6 51
[56:55] he said the bread that i will give is my
[56:58] flesh
[56:59] which i give for the life of the world
[57:01] in john 10 28
[57:03] he said i give unto them eternal life
[57:07] in john 14 27 he said my peace
[57:10] i give unto you in revelation 2 22
[57:14] to him will i give power over the
[57:16] nations
[57:17] amen in revelation 2 28 and i
[57:20] will give him the morning star these
[57:23] gifts
[57:24] are to be manifested
[57:26] [Applause]
[57:28] these gifts are to be manifested in a
[57:31] people
[57:32] listen church we do not have to take a
[57:35] substitute
[57:36] when the word is full of the original
[57:38] promises amen brother andrew
