[5:12] Holy forever.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; First Kings 19 and we'll start reading
[5:22] at verse 9. We're picking up where
[5:24] Elijah here in the third phase of how
[5:26] the Lord dealt with him here. And he
[5:28] came thither thither unto a cave and
[5:31] lodged there. And behold, the word of
[5:34] the Lord came to him. And he said unto
[5:36] him, "What doest thou hear, Elijah?" And
[5:39] he said, "I have been very jealous for
[5:41] the Lord God of hosts, for the children
[5:43] of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
[5:45] thrown down thine altars, and slain thy
[5:48] prophets with the sword. and I even I
[5:51] only am left and they seek my life to
[5:53] take it. And he said, "Go forth and
[5:56] stand upon the mount before the Lord."
[5:59] And behold, the Lord passed by, and a
[6:02] great and strong wind rent the
[6:05] mountains, and break in pieces the rocks
[6:07] before the Lord, but the Lord was not in
[6:10] the wind. And after the wind, an
[6:13] earthquake. But the Lord was not in the
[6:17] earthquake. Now, this is extremely
[6:19] important what's being said here because
[6:22] God is going to show what he's going to
[6:25] be in
[6:28] &gt;&gt; and he's also going to show what he's
[6:30] not in.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; That's important,
[6:33] &gt;&gt; especially when you have people who are
[6:36] thirsty to find God and thirsty to find
[6:38] more of God. They're in a vulnerable
[6:41] state because we must not just seek it
[6:43] anywhere, but we must find what God is
[6:45] in and what he's speaking through. Amen.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; We could be very deceived into thinking
[6:50] God is in something. But he must make it
[6:53] clear to the prophet here where God is
[6:55] in where God is in. And he said he
[6:57] wasn't in the wind. He was not in the
[6:59] earthquake. And after the earthquake, a
[7:01] fire, all these real extravagant uh
[7:04] flamboyant things, very extreme things,
[7:07] but he's making it clear uh I'm not in
[7:10] any of those. And after the earthquake
[7:11] of fire, but the Lord was not in the
[7:14] fire. And after the fire, a still small
[7:19] voice and I can finish it. And God is
[7:22] saying, "That's where you'll find me.
[7:25] &gt;&gt; That's where you'll find me." Strange,
[7:28] isn't it? We look for big things, but
[7:30] God says at the end, "This is where
[7:31] you're going to find me." Uh, it's very
[7:33] important to talk about emotional
[7:35] instability
[7:37] and mental instability. You say, "Well,
[7:39] why do I need to preach to believers
[7:41] about that?" Well, uh, we're the only
[7:44] ones, I believe, that we have a place
[7:46] that we can go to bring any instability.
[7:49] Can you say amen?
[7:50] &gt;&gt; We're the ones that have a place to go.
[7:52] Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad you
[7:54] raised your hand this morning that we
[7:55] have a place to go for all of that? And
[7:57] that's what I'm trying to point you to.
[7:59] But to say we don't need to talk about
[8:00] it, well, that would be denying us as a
[8:03] human being because we are affected
[8:05] emotionally by things. We are affected
[8:07] sometimes mentally by things. But God
[8:10] has promised in his word that he'll give
[8:12] us uh mental stability. He says, "I wish
[8:15] above all things you prosper and be in
[8:17] health as your soul prospers." And that
[8:19] he would give you a sound mind.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; He would give us a sound mind. And so,
[8:26] uh, Calvary did not just provide a
[8:28] saving of from sin, but it also provided
[8:32] all things that we need to bring to him.
[8:35] And so now in the age that we live in,
[8:37] and I I elaborated on it last Sunday, so
[8:39] I don't need to talk about, but we
[8:40] explored a little bit of the cultural
[8:42] plague of addiction, the cultural plague
[8:45] of addiction. How many knows that we're
[8:47] in an age of addiction
[8:49] &gt;&gt; and and the addiction is usually from a
[8:52] lack of the reality of God in man's
[8:54] soul. People are turning to addictions
[8:57] and come to that because they don't have
[8:58] God. they don't have the availability or
[9:00] at least they're not seeking God because
[9:03] God is the source for our soul. God is
[9:05] the source for our emotions.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; And and so now we have a whole uh nation
[9:11] and world addicted uh by many many
[9:14] things they're addicted to and it's
[9:15] because they have not turned to the to
[9:18] the answer that God has given. And uh
[9:21] there's no sense in preaching about
[9:22] other people. But sometimes Christians
[9:25] in a hard time in their life don't turn
[9:27] to the answer that they know is the
[9:29] answer. They'll turn to other things to
[9:32] calm their nerves. They'll turn to other
[9:34] things to kind of settle them down. And
[9:36] they go through mental times. As I read
[9:38] last Sunday about Elijah when he was
[9:40] under the juniper tree, he was going
[9:42] through a real mental strain. He was
[9:44] going through a depression. So let's not
[9:46] deny who we are. We can have juniper
[9:48] trees in our lives. we can have low
[9:51] times in our lives and uh and so this is
[9:54] a reality in the hour we live in and I
[9:56] won't speak uh much more on on those
[9:58] things because we we covered it last
[10:00] Sunday but we realize there's a thirst
[10:03] because we are a three-part being and
[10:06] because we are emotional because we have
[10:08] our minds and not just our souls but we
[10:11] have our emotions that there are things
[10:13] that deplete us in our spirit uh sort of
[10:16] if we could call it this way constant
[10:18] withdrawals calls from our emotional
[10:21] bank accounts. And we live in a world
[10:23] that constantly drains us
[10:27] &gt;&gt; emotionally.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; Drains us mentally. Can you say amen?
[10:31] &gt;&gt; And I mentioned three things that causes
[10:34] that and that is it can be family or
[10:36] domestic trouble. Uh it can be number
[10:40] two a severe trauma that's happened in
[10:42] your life. You lose a loved one or you
[10:45] have something happen or someone treats
[10:47] you in a wrong way. there's some trauma
[10:49] that happens to your spirit. That's the
[10:51] second reason sometimes your spirit gets
[10:54] there's a withdrawal from your emotional
[10:56] bank. And then there's family and
[10:57] domestic trouble. That's number one. But
[10:59] then there's the third thing of the
[11:00] demonic forces. Just in the next
[11:03] dimension that is an increased pressure
[11:05] against the bride of Jesus Christ.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Every day in the other dimension,
[11:10] there's forces against you as a son and
[11:13] daughter of God that that are always
[11:15] trying to and I'm going to get to it
[11:17] today. always trying to mis mislead you
[11:20] or pull you away from or cause you to
[11:23] lose the value of the fountain and the
[11:26] source for emotional stability to turn
[11:29] you to something else to accuse the
[11:32] brethren. Can you say amen? Most of the
[11:34] Christians that's in this room and
[11:35] believers understand the battle that you
[11:38] face and it doesn't get any lighter.
[11:40] It's stronger. Demonic forces are
[11:43] against the bride of Jesus Christ to
[11:46] drain you. try to drain you spiritually.
[11:48] And even though your soul would be
[11:50] sealed into the kingdom of God, Satan
[11:53] with what he's left to try to drain you
[11:55] emotionally, to drain you mentally, to
[11:58] to drain you spiritually. Can you say
[12:00] amen?
[12:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; And and then we get weak. And and then
[12:04] when we get weak, we're emotionally uh
[12:07] uh just instable sometimes.
[12:10] But the worst part of it is is when we
[12:12] turn to hundreds of other remedies for
[12:15] this instability that we feel.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; The worst part of it is is we turn to
[12:22] other things to calm our nerves.
[12:23] Sometimes even something that is
[12:25] wholesome. We must be careful that
[12:28] there's not a replacement in our lives
[12:30] for the true stability that's in the
[12:32] word of God. My theme today is he's
[12:35] provided a voice within his word. And
[12:37] that still small voice is our full
[12:40] stability in our lives.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; That voice, that word is our stability
[12:45] for emotional pain. That word provides
[12:48] all things needed for for mentally not
[12:50] feeling right. Can you say amen?
[12:53] &gt;&gt; And so there's a place that God has
[12:55] given no matter what we've gone through.
[12:57] We crave the approval of others
[13:01] &gt;&gt; to meet an emotional depletion.
[13:03] Preaching.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; Preachers crave to be approved by
[13:09] others.
[13:11] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't be seeking to be approved
[13:13] by other preachers.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; You should seek, he told the Pharisees,
[13:17] you you love the praises of men more
[13:20] than the praises of God. And that's
[13:21] because people live emotionally off of
[13:24] the praises of men. But it's more
[13:26] important that you have God's support,
[13:29] &gt;&gt; God's approval than to s spend your
[13:31] whole life trying to build a big church
[13:34] or do whatever to impress all the
[13:35] preachers. I'm not here to do that to
[13:37] meet an emotional need. My emotional
[13:39] need can be filled in the word of God.
[13:42] Can I get an amen this morning?
[13:45] &gt;&gt; We're not here to build big churches.
[13:47] We're not here to impress other message
[13:48] churches. We're not here for that. We're
[13:50] here to preach the message of the last
[13:52] days and see lives changed.
[13:55] and to minister and heal people that are
[13:58] struggling in this hour.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; They need healing. Can you say amen?
[14:02] They need mental stability.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; And guess what? We've got the word to
[14:07] give it to them.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; We've got a place for it this morning.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; People need a lot of healing. Marriages
[14:14] need healing.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; And I wouldn't even get up here unless I
[14:17] knew that I'm pointing to a word this
[14:20] morning. I'm pointing to a still small
[14:21] voice
[14:22] &gt;&gt; that is the answer
[14:24] &gt;&gt; for every need.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; There's been a fountain opened in the
[14:29] house of David.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; If we'll drink from that, he has the the
[14:33] answer to our needs.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We crave the approval
[14:38] of others to be acknowledged. But you
[14:40] see, you should never take a gift and
[14:42] you should never try to be seen to fill
[14:45] an emotional void in your life.
[14:48] Am I speaking the truth this morning? I
[14:50] know this is right now where we're
[14:52] living, but we've got to grow into
[14:54] stable people. Can you say amen? We
[14:56] can't lean to the approval of others.
[14:58] And we can't live on our appearance. If
[15:00] I can just keep my appearance right in
[15:02] front of everybody, then that feels No,
[15:05] we must fill it with God's approval and
[15:07] God's love in our lives.
[15:11] Because I guarantee you, if you keep
[15:13] trying to fill it with other things,
[15:15] from Hollywood movies all the way to the
[15:17] approval of preachers, if you're trying
[15:19] to fill some need in your life, you will
[15:21] be disappointed.
[15:23] &gt;&gt; That's Satan's kingdom. Can you say
[15:25] amen? Every alternative he has is a
[15:28] disappointment.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; But in God, there's no disappointment.
[15:32] There's only satisfaction.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; There's only satisfaction. And may it
[15:38] may look sometimes it may look sometimes
[15:40] like God he didn't answer. Oh it didn't
[15:43] it may look like God's disappointed but
[15:45] God never disappoints us.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; God will never disappoint you.
[15:51] &gt;&gt; God will fill your needs. Can you say
[15:52] amen?
[15:54] &gt;&gt; God will establish you.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; God will stabilize you.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; God will even you out. Can you say amen?
[16:01] Amen.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; God can take whatever you brought to
[16:05] church this morning. And God can give
[16:07] you a stable, peaceful minded heart.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; Just say, "Satan, I'm going through this
[16:12] by the grace of God."
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; But we find all of it. We're not We are
[16:22] not here to fill our thirst for
[16:24] stability with all this with something
[16:26] else, but we find all of it in the Lord
[16:29] and his voice. And that's my theme. So
[16:31] now I believe God's calling us to be a
[16:33] stable people
[16:35] &gt;&gt; to express stability and consistency in
[16:37] an inconsistent world.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Confidence. The Bible says in Proverbs,
[16:42] meddle not with those people who are
[16:44] given to change. Don't fellowship a lot
[16:47] with people that are given to change.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; In other words, from one week to the
[16:53] next, you don't know where they stand.
[16:56] You look at their post and it's like one
[16:58] week they're posting something that's
[17:00] completely contrary to a Christian
[17:02] testimony
[17:04] &gt;&gt; and the next week they're quoting a
[17:06] scripture as if they're so close to God.
[17:08] It's an age of instability.
[17:11] Don't meddle with them that are given to
[17:13] change and instability. Don't depend on
[17:16] the government. Don't depend on anybody
[17:18] else. Can you say amen? Find your
[17:20] stability in the word of God and in his
[17:22] voice.
[17:25] I believe it's a people that God is
[17:26] raising to be confident, not arrogant,
[17:31] &gt;&gt; but confident.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Now, I'll say this to you. You're not a
[17:35] sinner because you get nervous
[17:36] sometimes. You're a human being.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; You're not a sinner because you get
[17:40] anger. Angry.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; Just be angry and sin not.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; God made us who we are.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; We get angry. It's an emotion. We we we
[17:50] get nervous. We have nerves. God put
[17:52] them in our body. We just got to find
[17:53] something to keep them calm. We got to
[17:55] find the Lord.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; But we will get nervous. Elijah got
[17:59] nervous. We can't deny how God made us.
[18:02] But it's when we choose temporal things
[18:05] constantly. And I'm speaking to the
[18:08] social media generation. I'm speaking to
[18:10] all of us who have millions of
[18:12] alternatives to calm our nerves. Excuse
[18:15] me. From medicine all the way to the
[18:17] entertainment of the world.
[18:20] We're in we're in Satan's Eden here. And
[18:23] if I could describe it, he's the god of
[18:25] this world. And because he's the god of
[18:27] this world, he presents things to
[18:30] believers even that would be an
[18:32] alternative to calm our nerves.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm not against any of it. As I said
[18:37] last Sunday, I'm not against if a
[18:39] medicine is helping, we give God glory.
[18:41] But give God glory.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; And don't ever think that's your
[18:44] ultimate end. God helps you through
[18:47] that, then say, "I give God glory. He's
[18:49] helping me." Because he heals through
[18:51] medicine. He heals through a little bit
[18:53] of love. He heals through a little bit
[18:54] of caring for somebody.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; Don't you put in a box how God heals.
[18:58] It's not just a healing line. It's just
[19:01] not a healing. God's bigger than that.
[19:03] God can heal you right now while I'm
[19:05] ministering this word. There's a still
[19:07] small voice speaking right now.
[19:10] You're not a sinner because you get
[19:12] nervous. But it's when we choose
[19:13] temporal things constantly and we never
[19:15] stabilize into a more faithful
[19:17] consistent walk with God. How many would
[19:19] raise your hand? I want a consistent
[19:21] walk with God. I want a relationship
[19:23] with him that doesn't go from camp
[19:25] meeting to camp meeting.
[19:28] &gt;&gt; Consistency. Can you say amen?
[19:31] &gt;&gt; God the the the pressure is uh you know
[19:35] for a believer this the way we got to
[19:36] look at it. If we if more pressure comes
[19:38] on us, then we look at it is it's it's
[19:41] going to turn it into more power over
[19:43] the enemy in our lives. Not God's not
[19:45] called you to just be stay in a juniper
[19:48] tree. And that's what we had the three
[19:49] phases of Elijah's life, a Mount Carmel.
[19:52] How many's ever had a Mount Carmel?
[19:55] &gt;&gt; How many would like to always every day
[19:57] have a Mount Carmel? Well, it didn't
[19:58] happen with Elijah, so it's not going to
[20:00] happen with you. Second phase, the first
[20:02] one was Mount Carmel. Then he went
[20:04] straight down, hit rock bottom under a
[20:06] juniper tree,
[20:08] &gt;&gt; sleeping it off for days. Depression,
[20:11] people sleep, they sleep, they turned to
[20:13] all kinds of things. But Elijah just
[20:15] slept it off. Elijah's sleeping it off.
[20:17] So he had he had a low time. He was
[20:19] wanting to kill himself. God just kill
[20:21] me. God, just shoot me. I'm finished.
[20:23] I'm done. I got Jezebel barking at my
[20:25] heels. I've got all this stuff going on.
[20:28] And I I've just He just come from that
[20:30] real high. Ministers, watch yourself.
[20:32] You come that high to that low and he
[20:35] come right through that to experience
[20:37] even Jesus experience this depressing
[20:40] feeling. Can you say amen?
[20:42] &gt;&gt; It's real. Don't deny that it's not
[20:45] going on.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; And and and so but you see, you have to
[20:49] know in those times that God has called
[20:52] you to something higher.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen this morning? God has
[20:56] called you for something more. Can you
[20:58] say amen?
[21:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. It reminds me of the the
[21:02] pilot was in a one seat plane and he was
[21:05] going and flying at a certain level and
[21:07] he hears something in the back and he
[21:09] looks at the back and there's this
[21:10] little mouse in the back just chitter
[21:12] chattering and the mouse actually as he
[21:14] was flying and he only had one seat
[21:16] there. He couldn't get back to the
[21:17] mouse. He just starts to eat at some of
[21:20] the wiring that's running the plane.
[21:22] He's eating it and he's he's going at
[21:24] and so this guy starts to sweat and get
[21:25] nervous. He's wondering what am I going
[21:27] to do now? I can't get to that mouse.
[21:29] And if he keeps eating at this, we're
[21:31] going down,
[21:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[21:33] &gt;&gt; And he thought and a thought and he that
[21:35] thing is still eating at those wires.
[21:36] And all of a sudden, he has this
[21:38] thought. Hey, I can fly higher than that
[21:41] mouse.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; I'm built to fly higher
[21:47] &gt;&gt; than any little creature like that. Can
[21:50] I get an amen?
[21:51] &gt;&gt; You know what he did? He just went way
[21:54] up high until he seen that mouse just
[21:56] disintegrate and fall over dead.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you this morning as a
[22:00] believer, you're not called to live like
[22:03] the rest of the world. You're not called
[22:05] to addictions. You're not called to any
[22:08] addiction. You need to fly higher than
[22:10] that. God's called you to something
[22:12] higher.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Not because you deserve it, but because
[22:16] he gave it to you.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; Say, you're talking about everybody else
[22:20] in this room. I'm sorry, brother and
[22:21] sister. I'm not talking about everybody
[22:23] else in this room. I'm talking about
[22:24] you. So when Elijah then when he comes
[22:27] through the juniper tree, then he comes
[22:29] to the third phase which I read you this
[22:31] morning. And he comes Elijah in the
[22:33] cave, Mount Carmel, the uh juniper tree,
[22:37] and then the cave experience is the part
[22:40] that I'm emphasizing this morning. The
[22:42] the cave was the third part of the
[22:46] mystery behind this. The cave is the
[22:49] third part of the mystery. How many know
[22:52] that three is perfection?
[22:55] &gt;&gt; You will find in your Bible the basis of
[22:58] this number three being a part of the
[23:01] mystery and types throughout your Bible.
[23:03] And I could list a bunch of them, but
[23:05] this three has a spiritual meaning of of
[23:08] seven is completion, but three is
[23:10] perfection. So you when you hit the
[23:11] three, then you hit a perfection. So in
[23:14] other words, it's not in the first
[23:15] phase. It's not in the second phase that
[23:17] you hit a perfection, but the third
[23:19] phase is what we're growing into. And
[23:21] that's coming to perfection. And the
[23:22] number three means perfection. You'll
[23:24] find it throughout the Bible. Three
[23:26] means in the Bible means wholeness.
[23:29] Wholeness.
[23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; And perfection. Not just perfection, but
[23:33] wholeness. So, you know, it was the it
[23:36] was the third angel that came to Abraham
[23:39] with his final promise. There was three
[23:42] parts to the Old Testament tabernacle.
[23:46] Took three days for Israel to cross
[23:48] Jordan. Took 10 three days before they
[23:50] crossed over Jordan. Daniel prayed three
[23:52] times a day. Jesus said, "Destroy this
[23:55] temple and in three days I'll raise it
[23:58] up again."
[23:59] &gt;&gt; And did he do it? Can you say amen?
[24:02] &gt;&gt; It was the third day that the mystery
[24:04] broke. It was the third day that it was
[24:06] a perfection that came.
[24:08] &gt;&gt; I could read you hundreds of more. You
[24:10] can look them up yourself. The number
[24:11] three has a significance to it. Jesus
[24:13] said, "Destroy this temple." Paul was
[24:15] three years in the Arabian desert until
[24:17] he come out with the mystery to preach
[24:18] the mystery of Christ. There's three
[24:20] phrases to the rapture. Can you say
[24:22] amen? A shout, a voice, and a trump.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; The mystery breaks under the three.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Mount Carmel, God gives you power and
[24:35] boldness like he did Elijah.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; The juniper, what is that experience? It
[24:40] tells us God will nourish us and sustain
[24:43] us when we are that low. Cuz he couldn't
[24:46] sustain himself. We learned in the
[24:49] juniper tree that when you can't take
[24:51] care of yourself,
[24:53] &gt;&gt; God will take care of you. God will
[24:55] nourish you.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; How many raises hand? I've been there,
[24:59] done that. I know what it feels like
[25:01] that I don't have the strength to go on.
[25:03] And God's faithful to me to send me some
[25:06] supernatural cakes. Can you say amen? A
[25:08] little bit of water. Can you say amen?
[25:10] Let them sleep it off a little bit. Rise
[25:13] up. Take nourishment. Can you say amen?
[25:15] Cuz we can't even get it for ourselves.
[25:17] But we learned under our juniper trees
[25:19] that God will be there and sustain us
[25:22] when we can ourselves.
[25:23] &gt;&gt; We learn in Mount Carmel to be bold and
[25:26] speak the word of God.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; Call fire down from heaven if needed.
[25:30] But you see now then we come
[25:34] to this third thing.
[25:37] It's kind of like two extremes in our
[25:39] walk. Must have been two extremes for
[25:41] Elijah to go from a Mount Carmel, which
[25:44] is the extreme of something glorious and
[25:47] God vindicating so much. You could tell
[25:51] God was there. That's
[25:52] &gt;&gt; right.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; God came and showed up.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; God showed up. God brought the fire. God
[26:00] proved to the whole world, all the
[26:02] nation of Israel, this is my prophet.
[26:05] This is him. This is God showed up in a
[26:08] in a big way. How many's had that happen
[26:11] in your life?
[26:13] &gt;&gt; And it's it's a wonderful, but it's like
[26:15] the two extremes because then you come
[26:16] to the juniper tree and it's the
[26:18] complete opposite
[26:20] &gt;&gt; and yet God is still there.
[26:23] &gt;&gt; The same God that brought fire down and
[26:25] vindicated himself to all of Israel, now
[26:28] he doesn't need to vindicate himself to
[26:30] all of Israel. Now he needs to just be a
[26:34] nourishment
[26:35] &gt;&gt; to his prophet. So God is God is
[26:38] bringing his prophet through this
[26:39] prophet process but he needs to show his
[26:43] show him the final mystery. It's the
[26:45] third one that he must come to and the
[26:48] bride must come to as well. He says
[26:50] stand out in front of the cave. Come out
[26:52] of that cave and stand up on the mount.
[26:53] I want to show you something. So God
[26:55] calls him to the cave and shows him
[26:57] something. He has a secret that he has
[26:59] to pass to Elijah.
[27:02] to stabilize things. And so now this
[27:05] third mystery, it's to stabilize and to
[27:08] show him. Because if get this now, it's
[27:11] and this is what it is today. Knowing
[27:13] he's going to show Elijah where I God's
[27:16] saying, I'm going to show you where I
[27:17] will be. Knowing where God is, where to
[27:20] find him. And friends, listen, that's my
[27:23] message this morning. Showing us where
[27:25] he is and where to find him is
[27:27] everything. We we have to look at this
[27:29] and we have to see it's essential that
[27:32] we know where God is and where to find
[27:34] him to get a hold of him today. Amen.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; This may be so just dirt simple this
[27:40] morning, but listen, I'm telling you
[27:42] this because we have an enemy that I'm
[27:43] facing even this morning in this service
[27:46] that is distracting the young people and
[27:48] distracting even bride members to cause
[27:51] us to lose value of where God is in the
[27:54] still small voice to cause us to fill
[27:56] our lives and make it busy to we don't
[27:58] have time. We don't sit still.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. and shut out all the noise
[28:05] &gt;&gt; so we can hear this still small voice.
