So our pastor comes um do we have do we have lyrics up there tonight? We have lyrics still right sister. Innocent man. Do you know that I wanted to sing that song as an innocent man? We've been singing in the car for Leo. He likes that song. You guys know the he say he he wrote it. So but I love the I love the lyrics. We we start when we come into our our new birth, sometimes the devil likes to make us believe that we're still a servant when we're actually a son, right? And the devil doesn't understand an innocent man like the son of God, like a son of God. Amen. He doesn't understand that. So, do we have those lyrics? Can you sing it tonight? I know I've been justified and he's been sanctified and he's already glorified seated with Christ. Nothing can pluck him from the father's hand. Oh, the devil don't understand. an innocent man. Can we sing that tonight? You know he's been You know he's been justified and he's been sanctified and he's already glorified seated with Christ. Oh from the father's hand. Oh, the devil don't understand. Last time, sing it again. Oh, you know, you know, he's been just be glorified, seated with Christ. No one can pluck from father's hand. Devil don't understand an innocent man. Can we sing it one more time? Oh, you know he's been justified and he's been sanctified and is already glorified. Seated in Christ. Amen. No one can pluck him from the father's hand. Devil don't understand an innocent man. No. No. The devil don't understand. An innocent. Sing it one more time. Let the devil know tonight. The devil don't understand. an innocent man. Amen. What a revelation. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. You know what a glorious position God has called us to. Being justified in his sight. It's just wonderful, isn't it? God bless you. Good to have you. And I know the roads got a little slick on us, but we were determined. We weren't some We weren't gonna miss church tonight. Uh, Sister Jamie was just telling me there's some cars in the ditches and stuff. So, we appreciate you all coming out and glad you're all here safe tonight. Praise the Lord. God is good and we appreciate his protection and safety and all that he is this evening. And it's good to be in fellowship with all of you. Is that brother Dan and Sister Elva here on a Wednesday night with us, man. And just relax, enjoy the service. And there's not, you know, 250 people here. you just we're glad to have you. Praise the Lord. He had to come in and do some measurements here with his brother-in-law. Good to have you here tonight, sir. God bless you. Some work to the church. So, we appreciate it so much. Is that brother Eli and sister Lydia with us as well. Tucson, man. We're blessed. Praise the Lord. Good to have all you and all of our visitors tonight. God bless you. Let's turn in our Bibles to Psalms 71 if you would. And um we're remembering in prayer. Did did they mention my sister Sharon in the prayer request? &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. She just this afternoon had uh first treatment there. So she was in a lot of pain when she left and uh so it was a kind of a rough treatment as well today. So let's be in prayer for her tonight if you would remember her. While the word's being preached, I believe the Lord can bring healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms 71, a couple scriptures in 71 verse 20 and 21. And tonight I'm finishing um 12-part series on the key to he cares do you care out of that message of brother Brandham. He cares do you care. So I'm finishing that up summarizing it and uh just bringing our last few points out of it. We've been enjoying so much this last year. Psalm 71 and verse um 20 and 21. I hope I have the right one here. Thou which hath showed me great and sore troubles shalt quicken me again and shall bring me up again from the depths of the earth. So many scriptures like this that show how far we think we can go where God can't reach us. But there's not God can reach us wherever we're at and deeper in the depths of it just is amazing. Thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every side. And then let's read the original text that uh brother Brandon read in his service, He Cares, Do You Care, which would be 1 Peter chapter 5. And to wrap this up tonight, we just wanted to read that scripture and remind us again of the text for the series. 1 Peter chapter 5 and verse um six. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time, casting all your care upon him, for he carth for you. In other words, that means casting all your casting everything casting your worries. cares usually is worries, anxieties, but I believe it's saying here we can take everything, everything that we can't understand, every burden, every need, everything. There's nothing too big for God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And he wants us to come in humility because the scripture before it is about to humble ourselves. You have to humble yourself before you can say, "God, I need you and I'm going to turn this care over to you." We hold on to a lot of stuff. And you know why we hold on to some of it? because of pride. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when we humble ourselves before God, then he says, "Cast all of your cares upon him &gt;&gt; because he cares for you." And this is the text, he cares. Do you care? And so I think we can learn something very profound out of that for our lives. So we just want to finish this up tonight and we'll just ask the Lord to help us. Heavenly Father, grant to us strength in your word tonight. And we're thankful for protection and safety to be able to come out to the house of God. And also all the others, Lord, from many places that uh distances, Lord, that are not able to come. Bless each one that hears the sound of the word tonight. We pray it would go forth, Lord, with power, with demonstration, not just in this service, but in our lives, Lord. Make it real to us, Lord, and draw us closer as sons and daughters of God to that perfect way. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. God bless. You may be seated. So, saints of God, as we just wrap up this series, I I see a a final theme here running in this service towards the end of the service to the middle and towards the end. And I didn't want to finish this without uh bringing this theme that I'm uh seeing in here towards the end of it. I'm actually going to do something uh a bit unique in that I I'm going to let brother Brandon himself finish this service out tonight for the last 15 20 minutes or so because once we lay in this theme then he uh he has some pretty nice things at the end of the service to say pretty pretty good. So I may just play that off of my phone and uh you can listen to it in the way he says it because it's just it's a better summing to everything I think than I could ever do. So, you know, for maybe those who are visiting, I approached this message of he cares. Do you care? I approached it a bit different. And we see in there a key to unlocking a supernatural God. Not now. There's some people in the world that are hungry for a supernatural God. They actually would like it. But we there's a people on the face of the earth that they don't want to just hear stories about it. They actually want to draw him into their lives. And that's a certain group of people. I believe I'm preaching to some of them tonight. I I desire that because I don't need a distant God. I don't need a God that's just in books and tapes. I don't need a God that's just in my Bible. I need a God every day that can be real to me that I can bring into life situations. And so, sons of God are always looking to those keys that that unlocks our faith and unlocks God and moving the heart of God. And there's so many keys the Lord's blessed us with last especially the last few years not just me and other ministry bringing those little keys and only sons are looking for those there's a key right there's something that unlocks the door that unlocks more faith and that unlocks moving the heart of God. None of us would have thought that what Haddie Wright said so moved the heart of God. The way she said it, the motive she said it, what she said, we would have never dreamed that that just moved God and he'd come into the room in such a special way. Said, "Ask anything that you will." So, we need to be open. Say, "Lord, teach us your ways as sons." Cuz I don't want to do the things that grieve you. I want to do the things that please him. I want to say the right word. I want to create the right atmosphere. I want to do the right things that God is welcome in my home. He's welcome in my life. He's welcome in my thoughts. He's welcome in my heart. So that any given moment, God can express himself as a supernatural God. And it's only a a special group of people on the face of the earth that really want to bring him and invite him. And you remember brother Brandham talking about uh he always comes where he's invited. But then one minister one day preached when I was a young kid. I remember him saying it's not just that you invite him, is he welcome? because the late because the the Pharisees invited him for the party, but he wasn't welcome. &gt;&gt; So, there's a group on the face of the earth. It's not just we're inviting you to come. You're welcome to come and take over. You're welcome to be God. Can you say amen? And so, so there's a key here to unlocking the supernatural God. And it's crucial that we in the times we live in know how and what moves the heart of God and that we can find access to him. We need him so much more than we've ever needed him before. I guess we could all agree on that tonight. We need his supernatural hand in our life more than we ever needed it before. We're dealing with pressures and things that we have never dreamed we'd ever see. And a lot of it, it's not you. I know the devil is trying to tell you it's you, but it's not you. It's your position in Christ that Satan hates so much. &gt;&gt; It's how close we are to the wrap-up. It's how angry Satan is as the bride becoming one with him. So a lot of times we look at our problems and say it's me or my mistakes or and sometimes it is but a lot of times we're taking all the blame when we have to realize we're living in the final stages of judgment coming. We're living in pre-tribulation. We're not it's not like it was a 100 years ago. We're living in different times where I've quoted this scripture and over and over again this week to myself that we battle not against flesh and blood. IT'S NOT YOUR BROTHER. IT'S NOT YOUR SISTER. IT'S NOT YOUR WIFE. IT'S NOT YOUR EMPLOYER. CHRISTIANS DON'T BATTLE FLESH and blood, BUT AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS AND spiritual wickedness in high places. So, we need to be adults in the in the Lord to realize just in the other dimension, there's demons fighting us every day, whispering. They're not out there. They're right next to our ear. &gt;&gt; And we have to have the faith to respond to that and realize that that we need a God that's on the scene. We don't need a religion. We need a God that's real. And we need his presence invited into the chaos of our world. Maybe not this world, but our world. We need a supernatural God in it. And so the world and our enemy, it's the world and our enemy who locks our hearts so God can't do what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; It's the world and Satan that likes to keep our hearts locked up. &gt;&gt; And I have I have found something, you know, something about being locked. I was just telling a brother this the other day is that when you have something locked up and your heart can be locked up. You can be a Christian and your heart's locked up. It's locked up by the past. It's locked up by the devil beating you up. It's locked up. You can't you can't fully give your heart because it's locked up by something. And Satan loves that. He comes to He's a thief that likes to kill, steal, and destroy a believer's victory. And so your hearts can be locked up, but you can you can go to a lock and you can try to beat the lock. You can try to get something and and pry the lock. But the easiest way to get that lock open is to find the key. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So if there's a heart locked up, you can be a preacher and just beat people over the head and try to knock that lock off. NO. IF YOU TAP INTO A SUPERNATURAL God and that person catches the key, that key unlocks that locked up heart. And all of a sudden, their heart's open to God. When I'm counseling, I'm looking for a supernatural God to COME IN AND UNLOCK THE KEY THAT THAT HEART IS LOCKED UP. &gt;&gt; As soon as that key is placed in there, it unlocks it. And all of a sudden, the devil better be on the trail because we're going after him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He cares. Do you care? I've labeled as a is a key to sons and daughters of God. It's a key. And the key was mainly is that he cares. Now, all of us know that. If I said, "Do you know that God cares?" Amen. He cares. All of us know that. But how much does he want to care? And brother Bram didn't just say, "Preach God cares." He said, "Do you care?" &gt;&gt; And that's the key because you can't bring two omnipotence together. You can't bring God stepping in on the scene to show he cares if someone doesn't really care. Oh, I want deliverance. I WANT TO GO DO THIS. And do you really mean it? Do you really care? God knows if you mean it. &gt;&gt; God knows if you want to repent. You want to confess? You want to do things right? You want to head towards God. You want to lay it all on the table. God can see your heart whether you do. And if you're not willing to do that, we've learned in this series, then you're limiting God from showing for showing how much he cares to change you and to change situations that you can't change. So, this is the key. If if nobody else was able to listen to this whole series, I'm giving you the summary tonight. The key in he cares, do you care? Is that he cares? But do you care? And when you bring those two things TOGETHER SINCERELY, NOW WE KNOW God's sincere, but we got to make sure we're sincere. And when you bring that together, the God of impossibilities, &gt;&gt; THE GOD, THE SUPERNATURAL GOD KNOWS you're you care. &gt;&gt; That's right. And there's not much at that point that can stop our Lord or stop the to keep the devil uh from stopping this from happening. &gt;&gt; It's a key. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, when we really want to help and care by repentance and confession and action, that's what we were on a couple weeks ago. Repentance, confession. These are the simple things God uh gave through his prophet. Repentance, confession, and showing action and showing fruits that were serious and sincere. God sees that and then he shows he cares. But at the end of the sermon is this really powerful theme that he shows the depth of how much God cares. And this is it. The depth of how much God can care that even after judgment is pronounced &gt;&gt; and you're actually living under some of the results of the judgment. We could apply that to our life. The sewing and reaping principle. You sowed a lot of bad seeds and even though you're a Christian, you're still reaping a harvest from that. That's reality. Because that's a biblical principle. &gt;&gt; Say, "No, no, I'm a believer now." No, no, no. The only way you can fix some things is to start planting the right seeds &gt;&gt; and you'll get a good harvest. But there are some things that that carry on because it's the sewing and reaping principle. And so now you live under certain things with that. But even the judgments of God can be pronounced. And you can live under some of those results of jud judgment being pronounced. But even then, he can show he cares &gt;&gt; by giving a way out &gt;&gt; when judgment is hanging over the whole world. &gt;&gt; If if there's somebody interested sincerely in caring and repenting, God will provide a way out of it even in judgment. It's powerful, friends. &gt;&gt; It's powerful because it if something looks like it's gone too far, this is the way we look at things. They've gone too far. It's irreparable. It's hopeless. You know, that's that's not speaking God's dialect. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You got to speak God's language. And you start labeling things like hopeless. Uh you know, it's not it's too far. It's gone too far. They've crossed the line. you know, uh, he's showed a pattern of up and down, of unfaithfulness his whole life. And and and and so we speak that kind of language, BUT GOD DOESN'T speak that kind of language because we CAN SEE SITUATIONS IN THE BIBLE and maybe even your OWN LIFE WHERE GOD HAS STEPPED IN WHEN WE DIDN'T EVEN DESERVE IT. &gt;&gt; WHEN WE DIDN'T DESERVE IT. AND THE UNFAITHFULNESS IS THERE. And and and IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S GO IT'S GONE TOO FAR. AND HE CAN SHOW HE cares by giving a way out. I think that's a loving God. We ought to thank him tonight. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because if something looks too far, it's a pattern of up and down. We tend to label it ah, you know, that's a pattern through the years of up and down, in and out, you know, saying sorry and, you know, then going back to something. And so when we know this principle that God can step in, God God the depths of he cares. This builds faith that even after he should have given up or it looks like he even g it looks like sometimes he even gave up. You look at this in God's people Israel is that it looks like in God's language sometimes the way he talks to them it looks like he's giving up. And yet you can find the threat of redemption even though it appears God said that's just get stand out of the way. I'm just going to wipe them off the face of the earth. &gt;&gt; And even in that &gt;&gt; David he's tapping into his tender mercies he called them. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And sometimes those tender mercies is to a people that didn't even deserve it. And yet if if one person will turn and say God I am sorry. Forgive me. Is there any way out of this? our Lord reaches us out his hand &gt;&gt; and even the whole na the whole nation that's why you know we we brought this up uh with Josiah the last few months pre preaching about him a few services and the last thing I was bringing is that when he went to that prophetus and asked I'm reading the book I want to start a revival I want to clean the temple I want to do all this and she said because your heart was tender towards the Lord because you felt that that that you wanted to change things and the book has been open to you God will bless whatever you do in the people, but the judgments over Israel still stands. &gt;&gt; That's what she said. So now that showed us that you can have a personal cleansing. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; REVIVAL EVEN THOUGH YOU LIVE in a nation that's already doomed. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Let's be honest. &gt;&gt; This the world and this nation has been pronounced by God's prophet. It's under God's judgment. It's not if, it's when. It's headed to tribulation. It's sooner than we think. Can you say amen? There's no redemption for it. It's it's it's it's over. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Well, I shouldn't say there's no redemption because God's going to cleanse the whole thing and bring a new millennium for his people. So, there's redemption for the earth. But right now, we're on the verge of all that. And so, we live under those judgments. This whole world's been judged. The prince of and power of the air has already been judged. uh the denominational system has been indicted, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Not the people, but let's pray because the whole denominational system received an indictment from God. You've crucified him. Aresh, &gt;&gt; it's already done. Been pronounced by his prophet. So now if you live in a time like that, um I just wanted to say that's a pretty troublesome time to live in as a believer because everything around us has been in a state of just basically barely surviving &gt;&gt; because the judgments of God are looming. &gt;&gt; And there's no trump that's going to fix it. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no, you know, no, all due respect, but no, it's it's been prophesied in the Bible, but Josiah had that promise is that it's Israel's still going to go into captivity. My judgment still stand, but you have found &gt;&gt; grace like Noah, he found grace in the eyes of the Lord. God pronounced judgment over that whole thing. The rain is coming. He said, "But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord." How many needs his grace tonight to make it out of this in a rapture? &gt;&gt; And th to those who WANT TO THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR HIS COMING TO THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR IT AND PRAYING FOR IT SAY GOD GET ME OUT OF HERE. &gt;&gt; HE has a grace for those people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he builds our faith. And so Josiah was that way. He he had a temporary thing there. So and I also want you to read uh in Nehemiah chapter 9. And I won't have time to read it tonight. Maybe I'll pull one scripture out of it because it was such a blessing today to see. And this is the people. Let me just make one comment about it and and read Nehemiah 9 is so beautiful. And you remember now this whole chapter gives the history of e Israel from Abram all the way on. And it clearly shows the history. It's honest about all the things God did. Abraham, the promise, they went into the land, then they went into Egypt in bondage. So it gives the whole history and these are the people that's reading the book and the history in Nehemiah 9. These are the people who had lived through the whole process of being under God's judgments in Babylon for 70 years. And guess what God said? After 70 years, I'll bring you out. &gt;&gt; Here's the people in Nehemiah 9 that's standing back in their land rebuilding the temple. &gt;&gt; Absolutely amazing. And so these are the people that have come back. Now they're reading their history. They've been the hope through a process of being under God's judgments, having to live in Babylon, not their own land. And now they're generations later now. Now they're back seeing their temple restored. And they're reading the history. And you'll find, you're going to have to read it at home. How many promised to read um Nehemiah 9? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Isabelle. Appreciate that. There's always homework that goes with these Wednesday nights, you know. There's always homework. So, Nehemiah 9, congratulations on your new job, by the way, Isabelle. Praise the Lord. God bless you there. Uh, see if they need any help. I might need a job after a while there, Isabelle. But you see now uh they're reading the history and and even they say in in in not so many words but just even when you did this even when Israel did this even when they rejected God in the wilderness it keeps giving the history we rebelled we were stiff necked we were it kept saying it but your tender mercies your mercies your mercies came to God's people and he says in one verse here in Nehemiah 9 I think let me just pick it up here in verse He goes through the whole history. Oh yes. He says verse 29, "And testified against them that thou mightest bring them again into thy unto thy law. Yet they dealt proudly and hearkened not under thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them, and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear. Yet yet many years dust thou forebear them and testifies against them by thy spirit in your prophets. Yet would they not hear. Therefore gavest thou them into the land of the people of the lands. Nevertheless, for thy great mercy's sake, thou dost not utterly consume them, &gt;&gt; nor forsake them, for thou art a gracious and merciful God. They didn't even deserve it. And you find that all through the history is that they did it again. They failed again. You're talking about a people under Moses that seen the pillar of fire and seen the supernatural and they still were immatured and rebelled against God. You think that's it? We're writing them off. No. No. God said there's there's a there's a measure of grace. I got a quote to you read Sunday. It's just powerful. Uh I'm not going to let it out tonight. That way you'll come back Sunday. So, so now you know uh in all these examples including Josiah as we've been preaching on him to conclude now he shows God cares even when God shouldn't care. This is the theme he ends this with. Things can go pretty low stages of pretty low uh and then yet how no matter how low they get, there's a lifeline thrown out when the people of God want it. when you care, then he'll show he cares. &gt;&gt; Why do we need to know this? Because we need to be mature. Let me say it this way. Why do we need to know this? Because we need to be mature and not write something or someone off too quickly. We need to be mature and not write someone or some church or some preacher or your brother or sister &gt;&gt; or they left. You know, I gave you the scripture Sunday afternoon there. Saul breathing out threatenings against the people of God. Just breathing out hatred. And you get that on the internet. people who have been in this message just breathing out just all kinds of venom and bitterness back towards it to get back. Some people I wonder why and they were some of them when are in our church and sometimes why don't you just we're not bothering you. Go live the way you want to live and God bless you. I'll shake your hand. Call your brother or sister. That's not good enough. &gt;&gt; And Paul he's breathing out just just venom and I'm taking these people. I've got letters. I've got endorsement for all the priests to go put these people in jail. And you know he's voted least likely to succeed in the kingdom of God. He would not get any votes from any Christians in that day as being the next guy to take the message to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; What about what do you think about Saul? &gt;&gt; What are you crazy? &gt;&gt; Let's vote ON SAUL. I AIN'T VOTING for him. &gt;&gt; You hear what he SAID IN THE PAPER THE OTHER DAY? YOU HE SAID you you did you see the Facebook? DID YOU SEE WHAT HE WROTE ABOUT US? YOU SEE WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO? WE WOULDN'T have given him any hope whatsoever. And yet God had his number. &gt;&gt; And so that's why we can't write anybody off. &gt;&gt; That's why we can't judge how much judgment they need to receive and they need to work their way back in penance or whatever else. We don't decide that. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, in a moment's time, the light CAME TO PAUL. IT WAS JESUS. And this man who was breathing OUT THREATEN IT GOT THE LIGHT AND WAS TAKEN OFF HIS HIGH HORSE. HE WAS BLINDED. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? Then he sent this man to pray for him and it was over. IT WAS DONE. THAT WAS IT. HE NOW WAS POSITIONED. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To do completely the opposite of what he was doing. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God cares. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God's ways are higher than our ways. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need to m be mature and not write somebody off or someone off too quickly. &gt;&gt; We need to be careful with the sword of this word that we have in this message. &gt;&gt; Everybody listening? &gt;&gt; Because there's some preachers using this sword to slice up other preachers. &gt;&gt; And that's not what the sword is for. &gt;&gt; That's not what this message is for. to prove how better we are in doctrine. &gt;&gt; It's my church so I can be open tonight on this Wednesday night. This message was not given us to debate or to slice up everybody else or even to slice up the denominational people. We don't have a right to do that. That's not the spirit even brother Brandham WAS IN. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T FIND THAT. EVEN THOUGH HE BLASTED THE SYSTEMS, he had a respect level for the men he was preaching to and and COMPLIMENTED THEM OF HOW MUCH THEY knew Christ and what they did FOR THE LORD. THAT'S THE ATTITUDE we need. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY COULD BE A SAW AND TAKE THIS MESSAGE SOMEDAY FURTHER THAN WHAT WE TOOK IT. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO QUIT TRASHING EVERYBODY ELSE. QUIT SPEAKING IT WITH EVERYBODY ELSE. QUIT USING THE WORD AS A SWORD on one another and use it on the devil. The sword was meant to drive to the heart of the enemy, not your brother and sister. I can't get enough amens tonight. I know that's THE TRUTH. I KNOW that's the truth. &gt;&gt; But we have used it. It's kind of like uh James and John there getting so excited and they're just said, "Well," they said, "Let's go, Jesus, and we'll just," they rejected. They said, "No, we'll burn the whole city up. WE'LL WE'LL CALL FIRE LIKE Elijah and we'll just burn, you know, we'll be like brother Brandham Elijah and we're just gonna They rejected this message. WE'LL BURN THE WHOLE city up. And those who know your Bible, that's what they were saying. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "You don't even know what spirit you're of." &gt;&gt; Bless God, we got the word. We're going to burn and fry them and be JUST LIKE PRO. GOD DIDN'T CALL YOU TO BE just like, brother Brandham. God didn't call you to be ELIJAH PASTOR. HE DIDN'T CALL YOU TO BE A PROPHET TO THE PEOPLE. HE CALLED you to be a pastor to the people. AND A PASTOR IS DIFFERENT than a prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, I'll say it again. Who would agree? We need to mature and not write something off or someone off too quickly &gt;&gt; because a person can go pretty low and we're going, I think they've crossed the line, but it's not up to us to make that decision. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It is not up to you. Who died and made you boss? &gt;&gt; Who died and made you the complete judgment of all? Let's be careful. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, this is how he brings in the theme and then I'll play the rest to you. But this is how he lays in. He says, and uh he cares. Do you care? Now, I'm coming to my text. I have a funny way of bringing I like to build up a lot of things and then hit my text. And now he's coming after talking about all these things that we've talked about the last uh 11 parts in this series. Now we find that in the days of Noah when God was going to judge the world when it come just like it is now because Jesus said it was he did he care? Did he care? He certainly he cared. He cared for what? Now after he had all listen this is the theme. After he had already know judgment was coming and had pronounced judgment he cared for those who cared. That's an incredible truth. &gt;&gt; After judgment was pronounced, &gt;&gt; there was so there was grace &gt;&gt; for those who cared. &gt;&gt; Judgment had been pronounced. He cared for those who cared. And that's the same as it is today. He cared for those who were willing to care. And we find that he sent them a prophet to direct them to direct his elected people to its provided way for their escape. That was the ark. That was Noah's ark. He said, "How does how are they going to find grace?" God sent a prophet. The prophet pointed them to the ark for the hour. That was God's grace, too. How many knows God's when God sends a true prophet, it's his grace. &gt;&gt; And then he sends an ark, which is a type of the word to come into the ark. And so he pointed and so we find that he sent them a prophet to direct them to direct his elected people to its provided way for their escape. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. You see, we find that God cared for his people. We're at the end. And we see we're at the end. There's not no way to build upon that corruption. Now, he's given the state of this world. There's nothing to build on. You can't build on this corruption. How can we build a city upon the charred ruins of Sodom and Gomorrah? How can we do it? I like that because he's given the conditions. We're in Sodom and Gomorrah. &gt;&gt; It's knocking at our doors. We have to put the token of protection around our children &gt;&gt; all the time. &gt;&gt; We are in Sodom and Gomorrah &gt;&gt; and the spirits of it around us. And there's no way to to correct it as the world. That's where how can we do it? There's only one phoenix left and that's the coming of the Lord Jesus. Praise the Lord. And that'll be his grace. So even after judgment, God sends his grace. I'm going to play the last part of this now, and you will find that he takes some extreme things to show us that God still cared. Notice the people's names that are mentioned from Noah all the way through. This is important because we are here under a world and a nation that has judgment has already been pronounced. As I just said, the denominational system has been indicted by God's prophet. The prince, Satan, has been judged already. And guess what? I believe Satan knows it. I know he knows he's been judged. &gt;&gt; And he knows he can't stop the revelation coming to this bride. &gt;&gt; He's trying. Christ the mystery God revealed. This is the revelation. Satan howls at it. &gt;&gt; He howls. He hates it. He doesn't hate you personally. This isn't a personal thing. He hates that you're becoming one with Christ. And guess what? You are becoming one with Christ. &gt;&gt; You're embracing this word. Who is it? This is Christ. You're becoming one with him. That's why you battle the devil so much. &gt;&gt; It's not your boss. And it's not it's not it's not flesh and blood. Can you say amen? It's principalities and powers that hate your position, hate your ONENESS WITH CHRIST. DESPITE YOUR MISTAKES AND ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE, THERE'S A ONENESS happening with you and your soul and God. And Satan hates that. He's howling at it. HE CAN'T STOP THIS REVELATION. It's in your ear all day. He's in your ear all day. How many would testify, "HE'S IN MY EAR ALL DAY LONG." Conditions we live in are results of being under God's judgment and pre-tribulation. Right now, we live on that under that. And yet, we can find grace and a God who cares in the middle of all that. We will need to know that especially in the coming days. I think it's going to get more pressure before the rapture as we just squeeze out of here. &gt;&gt; It's not going to light lighten up. Can you say amen? Satan's got not going to lighten up. He hates it. He'll fight any way he can. He's pronounced doomed. He's got pronounced he's got condemnation on him and he's going to he's like a he's like a mean angry wolf at the bride of Jesus Christ. He's just he's just venomous. at what we believe and what we stand for. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; He still is in our ear. And we need to know how to call on God. &gt;&gt; We need to know that God still responds to his elect when they truly repent. &gt;&gt; You need to know that because the devil says, "You you've gone too far. You don't have a right to talk to God." Now, we need to know we can talk to God. Can I get an amen tonight? We need to know this. When the devil's in our ear, YOU SAY, "WAIT A MINUTE. I GOT A RIGHT TO TALK TO MY GOD. I GOT A RIGHT. STEP BACK, SATAN." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CAST OUT DEVILS. &gt;&gt; DON'T FORGET THAT. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? WE BRING THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE. WE REBRANDS IN OUR HOME. WE PUT IT IN FRONT OF OUR CHILDREN ALL THE TIME. WE HAVE A RIGHT TO THESE THINGS. WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CAST OUT THE DEVILS THAT ARE TALKING IN OUR EARS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I talked to brother Diggs today. He says, "Let me know if you NEED TO COME UP THERE. I'LL DRIVE SOME DEMONS AWAY FOR YOU." &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HE DOES. LET ME KNOW. HE SAID, I SAID, "WELL, CAN YOU COME THE 14TH?" I CAN'T COME THEN. I said, "We'll get you up because listen, we want anybody who's going to run the devils away, &gt;&gt; but you don't need Brother Diggs to do that. YOU CAN DO THAT YOURSELF." AND THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO KNOW YOU GOT A GOD WHO CARES. &gt;&gt; YOU REPENT TO HIM. AND HE'S RIGHT THERE to show he cares and ready to step in. And don't forget, he's a million times more powerful than anything the devil can put in your face. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't God good? &gt;&gt; God is good all the time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Feel like preaching tonight for sure. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I want you to listen now to the extreme situations and the extreme he brother Brandham just seems to give the extreme extreme conditions Noah's day and all the way through. You're going to hear him talk about uh mostly about judgment being pronounced and people finding grace underneath that. &gt;&gt; Noah found grace. He talks about Hezekiah was pronounced you got only so many days to live. That was it. We thought that was it. And then he comes back and he repents and said God God gave them more days. &gt;&gt; The Ninevites, God forgave the Ninevites when they repented. &gt;&gt; The judgments were over them. And even Jonah is surprised that God forgave him &gt;&gt; and he's supposed to be the prophet of the day. &gt;&gt; Judgments coming down on Egypt. And when the judgments are coming in the death angel, he gave a token for his people. Amen. &gt;&gt; He talks about outsiders. Brother Bram does not accepted in the people of God. Rahab, outsiders. &gt;&gt; Don't you don't you label an outsider. &gt;&gt; Don't you put them in a category. &gt;&gt; People that stood for the word and stood alone and ended up poor because of it and ended up depressed because of it. Elijah was one example. He stood for the word against Jezebel and then he stood alone by himself with the word. Became depressed. Became down. Had no money. Had no food. &gt;&gt; Rejected. Talks about a secret believer. Don't Don't write off the secret believers &gt;&gt; because that might be a son of God and they're a secret believer. They'll come out of their closet someday. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Secret believers, ones who didn't get in the prayer line. He talks about you be listening talks about a neurotic talks about a harlot cast out by her parents. That's what I'm saying because he said it other places when she was just a little girl became a harlot living with all kinds of men selling herself. But God cared. &gt;&gt; God stepped in and show he cared. &gt;&gt; I love him tonight saints. God bless you as you listen to I'll let brother Brandham find finish this series of God and live by his word. Notice he cared for those who cared to escape in the days of NOAH AND HE SENT HIM A PROPHET AND THIS PROPHET DIRECTED THEM TO GOD'S PROVIDED WAY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW THAT'S GOD'S WAY OF DOING THINGS. &gt;&gt; SEE &gt;&gt; GOD spoke to Noah which was the word. It wasn't the written word then and told Noah to prepare an audit for the saving of the people and to WARN ALL THE PEOPLE THAT HE HAD ONE WAY OF SALVATION. &gt;&gt; AND THIS MAN WAS A VINDICATED PROPHET THAT PROVED them the way of escape. NOTICE THE HUMBLE AND SINCERE HEARD THIS MAN AND believed him &gt;&gt; and they escaped. They escaped what? the death of the world of sin that was being destroyed in that day. THEY ESCAPED THE DEATH ROUTE THAT WAS LAYING UPON THE WHOLE WORLD. GOD SO CARED. &gt;&gt; OH, GOD HELP US TO GO DOWN DEEP NOW before the prayer line. &gt;&gt; God cared. &gt;&gt; Yes. HE LOOKS UPON THE WORLD NOW TODAY &gt;&gt; AND HE'S CALLED AND HE'S CALLED AND HE'S SPURNED AND TURNED DOWN. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A CHANCE OF repentance &gt;&gt; at the beginning WHEN GOD TOLD ISAIAH TO GO UP AND PUT TELL HEZEKIAH HE'S GOING TO DIE. HEZEKIAH REPENTED. &gt;&gt; AND THERE WAS MERCY. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD TOLD JONAH TO GO TO NINEVE AND CRY OUT CUZ IN 40 DAYS HE DESTROYED A CITY. THEY CRIED OUT FOR MERCY AND THERE WAS REPENTANCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; But when they reject it, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT BUT JUDGMENT. &gt;&gt; AND THE NATION HAS REJECTED CHRIST. &gt;&gt; They failed to heed the call. &gt;&gt; So there's nothing left. But we're facing judgment. &gt;&gt; NOW, DOES GOD CARE ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVE REPENTED? AMEN. &gt;&gt; HAS HE MADE A WAY FOR THEM? &gt;&gt; NOW, WE'RE GOING TO see what he did in times past. Noah's time. He cared. He sent the prophet and he he brought the way and he showed them the way and he made THEM A WAY OF ESCAPE AND THEY ESCAPED THE JUDGMENT. HE ALSO cared for them. Uh we find OUT THAT HE BRINGS THEM TO A PLACE WHERE HE IN THE LAST DAYS THE WORD OF ALL BEFORE THE GREAT JUDGMENT COME HE SO CARED FOR THEM UNTIL HE PREPARED a way THAT THEY COULD COME INTO and would be FREE FROM ALL THE JUDGMENTS THAT was coming. &gt;&gt; Now he did that to the the elected. Now we know that he did THAT TO THE ONLY TO THE ELECTED. NOW &gt;&gt; they was the ONE WHO HAD ACCEPTED THIS JOURNEY OF LIFE. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE THE ONE WHO WERE PREDESTINATED TO SEE HIM. THEY WERE THE ONE WE ALL IF WE BELIEVE THE BIBLE, WE HAVE TO BELIEVE in predestination. &gt;&gt; That's right. Not God willing that any should suffer, but he know who would receive it and who wouldn't. &gt;&gt; HE ALSO CARED FOR HIS ELECTED PEOPLE in the days of the destruction of Egypt. They have down there in Egypt and become slaves. The days of Moses, he cared for THE PEOPLE. HE SENT THEM WHAT? A prophet again. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; AND HE SEPARATED HIS PEOPLE FROM THE UNBELIEVING WORLD FROM THE COMING JUDGMENT OF THAT DAY. Did he do it? HE CARRIED ON EGYPT AND HEAPED THEIR SIN SO HIGH UNTIL GOD HAD TO SEND JUDGMENT because he had already told Abraham and I WILL DEAL WITH THAT NATION. &gt;&gt; SO INSTEAD OF POURING OUT HIS WRATH UPON ALL OF THEM, he sent his care to them. HE SENT HIS COMFORTER TO THEM. &gt;&gt; HE SENT HIS WORD TO THEM. &gt;&gt; AND HE ALWAYS SENDS HIS WORD BY HIS PROPHET AS HE DID IN NOAH'S TIME. He did the same thing in the days of Noah &gt;&gt; in the days of Eli of Moses. WE FIND OUT HE done the same thing. He sent THEM HIS PROPHET AND THEY SEPARATED themselves from unbelief. &gt;&gt; Now that's the kind that come out. &gt;&gt; That's the kind that believed it. &gt;&gt; They believe Moses that he was a he to the EYES OF PHARAOH. HE WAS A FANATIC. HE WAS A MAGICIAN. HE WAS A HYPOCRITE. HE WAS SOMETHING HORRIBLE. BUT TO THE PEOPLE THAT WAS ELECTED TO COME OUT ACCORDING TO GOD'S WORD, I WILL BRING THEM OUT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He was a prophet &gt;&gt; to them. IT WAS GOD'S PROVIDED WAY. AND HE ALSO, NOTICE, they uh believed HIM AND ESCAPED FROM THE JUDGMENT OF THAT DAY. They believed Moses AND HIS HE ALSO CARED FOR them to bring them out. And he cared FOR THEM IN THE JOURNEY AFTER THEY COME OUT. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS IN THE PHYSICAL. THIS IS IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM. &gt;&gt; HE CARED. WHY? HE PROVIDED EVERYTHING THEY HAD NEED of while they were in the journey. &gt;&gt; He healed THEM WHEN THEY WERE SICK. &gt;&gt; He provided healing. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE PROVIDED A WAY FOR THEIR SICKNESS. HE PROVIDED A A BRASH SERPENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT THEY COULD LOOK UPON THAT BRASS SERPENT, A SYMBOL OF SIN, and be healed. &gt;&gt; HE FED THEM WHILE THEY WERE IN THE WAY. &gt;&gt; WHERE THERE WAS NO BREAD, HE RAINED BREAD OUT OF HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; HE FED THEM. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT HE CALLED THEM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SHOWING HE CARES FOR THOSE WHO CARE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF THEY'RE READY TO CONFESS AND REPENT AND BELIEVE AND ACCEPT, God cares. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU GOT TO CARE FIRST. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO ACCEPT WHAT HE SENT YOU. &gt;&gt; HE SO CARED FOR THEM THAT THEY'D BE SURE THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MISTAKE. HE HAVE VINDICATED HIS PROPHET BY A SIGH OF A PURE FIRE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT LET THE PEOPLE SEE THAT IT WASN'T JUST THIS MAN WALKING ON HERE. THAT WAS GOD RIGHT ABOUT HIM. &gt;&gt; HE was the one THAT WAS LEADING THE WAY. &gt;&gt; GOD CARES FOR PEOPLE WHO CARES. &gt;&gt; GOD CARES FOR THOSE WHO CARE FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; SO HE HAVE VINDICATED this man AND PROVED THAT HE WAS UH GOD'S SERVANT BY SENDING THEM A PILLAR OF FIRE TO LEAD THEM TO THE very land. And they KNOW AS LONG AS THIS SIGN OF THIS FIRE, A PILLAR OF CLOUD AND FIRE WAS FOLLOWING THEM, HE SAID HE TOOK NOT AWAY the pillar of fire and cloud. &gt;&gt; HE WAS WITH THEM FOR YEARS and years in THE WILDERNESS. 40 YEARS. IS THAT RIGHT? &gt;&gt; THE PILLAR OF FIRE WITH THEM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE'RE IN OUR 33RD YEAR LEAVING SEVEN YEARS LONGER. They would tithe the same. &gt;&gt; All right. A PILLAR OF FIRE LED THEM. HE cared for them. &gt;&gt; AND HE CARED SO MUCH FOR THEM TO HE LET THEM KNOW THAT THAT IT WASN'T SOME SCIENTIFIC THING. IT WASN'T SOME SLIP UP, BUT HE HAD VINDICATED THE MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; proven it. He so cared even for a woman THAT WAS AN OUTSIDER. NOT AN ISRAELITE. SHE DIDN'T BELONG to the group. BUT SHE WAS AN OUTSIDER, PRESBYTERIAN, Methodist or something. SHE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE. BUT WHEN SHE HEARD, &gt;&gt; HER NAME WAS RAHAB. &gt;&gt; SHE'S LIVING, SHE'S A HARLOT. BUT WHEN SHE HEARD HOW GOD &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WAS IN A PILLAR OF FIRE &gt;&gt; AND WAS LEADING THEM, &gt;&gt; LORD, &gt;&gt; SHE SAID, "LET CALLED OUT TO GOD." AND SHE SHOWED MERCY TO THE SPIES THAT HAD COME TO LOOK OUT THE LAND. AND BECAUSE SHE CARED FOR HER AND HER PEOPLE, GOD CARED FOR her &gt;&gt; in so MUCH TO THIS HARLOT &gt;&gt; THAT WOULD GIVE HER LIFE TO CHRIST TO THE CAUSE BECAUSE SHE'D SEEN THE SIGN OF A SUPERNATURAL GOD. AND SHE SERVED HER GODS right in her own denomination. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN SHE SEEN THIS GREAT SUPERNATURAL SIGN, SHE CRIED OUT AND ASKED for mercy and for mercy FOR HER FAMILY. AND GOD SO CARED FOR HER THAT THE WHOLE CITY LAPPED DOWN, ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER. BUT THERE WASN'T ONE ROCK MOVED ON HER HOUSE. &gt;&gt; He cared. &gt;&gt; Though her be an outsider. She wasn't in the group at that time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But he cared. HE ALWAYS CARED. &gt;&gt; HE CARED FOR ELIJAH &gt;&gt; WHEN HE AND HE CARED FOR GOD. &gt;&gt; BLESS THE LORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHERE IT COMES TO. &gt;&gt; CAST YOUR CARES UPON HIM FOR HE CARTH FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; PETER SPEAKING TO THE ELECT ELDERS. &gt;&gt; THE ELDERS AND THEM IN THE CHURCH. HE SAID, "PUT YOUR CARES ON HIM BECAUSE HE CARES FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; PUT EVERYTHING THERE BECAUSE YOU'RE CLEAN BEFORE GOD. YOU'RE YOU'RE WALKING AS SERVANTS OF GOD." &gt;&gt; GOD CARED FOR ELIJAH BECAUSE ELIJAH CARED FOR GOD. ALL THE OTHER PREACHERS HAD LOST THE VISION OF THAT DAY, HAD LOST THE WILL OF GOD AND THE LOVE OF HIS WORD, AND IT ALL WENT MODERN. &gt;&gt; BUT NO MATTER HOW MODERN JEZEBEL HAD HIM, &gt;&gt; the first lady OF THE LAND, &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEM OTHER PREACHERS, LET THEM WOMEN ACT AND DO, ELIJAH CALLED OUT AGAINST IT IN THE NAME OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; HE CARED FOR WHAT GOD SAID. &gt;&gt; GOD CARED FOR WHAT ELIJAH SAID THEN. BECAUSE HE SAID the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; God cares when you care. &gt;&gt; But you got to care first. &gt;&gt; NOTICE HE CARED WHEN HE CALLED ELIJAH BY HIS WORD OFF FROM AMONGST the denominations. &gt;&gt; LOOKED LIKE HE'D HAVE TO STARVE TO DEATH CAUSE THERE'D BE NO TITHE AND OFFERINGS COMING TO HIM. BUT HE SO CARED FOR ELIJAH. HE DIDN'T LET HIM STARVE DURING THE TIME HE WAS OBEYING THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He commanded the ravens to feed him. &gt;&gt; HE CARED FOR ELIJAH BECAUSE ELIJAH CARED FOR HIM AND he is the word. &gt;&gt; HE CARED FOR DANIEL. WHEN DANIEL CARED FOR GOD'S WORD ENOUGH TO PRAY SINCERELY. &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT THE KING SAID, I DON'T WANT NO MORE OF THAT DONE. ELIJAH JUST THREW OPEN THE SHUTTERS AND LOOKED TOWARDS JERUSALEM AND PRAYED. &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; ELIJAH CARED FOR GOD AND GOD CARED FOR ELIJAH. DANIEL CARED FOR GOD'S WORD AND GOD CARED FOR ELIJAH. HE SET A PILLAR OF FIRE THAT SCARED THAT LION OFF OF HIM AND STAYED DOWN THERE ALL NIGHT LONG. &gt;&gt; God cared BECAUSE DANIEL CARED. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; SINCERELY PRAYED KNOWING THAT IT GO TO MEAN THROW IT INTO THE LION'S DEN. IF HE DISOBEYED THE DENOMINATIONAL ORDERS. But he knelt DOWN BY THE WINDOW, NOT FEARING WHAT MAN SAID. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE THREW OPEN THE WINDOWS BECAUSE IT WAS A COMMANDMENT OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND HE PRAYED SINCERELY AND HONESTLY TO HIS GOD EVERY DAY. &gt;&gt; He cared FOR GOD AND HIS COMMANDMENT. AND GOD TURNED AROUND AND CARED FOR DANIEL AND HIS COMMAND his stand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; DANIEL CARED FOR GOD AND HIS WORD. AND GOD CARED FOR DANIEL AND HIS STAND FOR THE WORD. He'll do it every time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He cared for the Hebrew children WHEN THEY RESPECTED SINCERELY AND CARED FOR THE FAITH THAT WAS ONCE DELIVERED to them. &gt;&gt; The word of God. &gt;&gt; HE SO CARED FOR THEM THAT WHEN THEY BLOW THE TRUMPET, THEY HAD A COMMANDMENT FROM GOD. DON'T BOW BEFORE ANY HEATHEN GOD, ANY STATUES. DON'T BOW. DON'T WORSHIP HIM. THAT WAS THE COMMANDMENT. AND WHEN THEY SOUNDED THE TRUMPET AND SAID, "WE'LL THROW INTO THE FURNACE THOSE WHO DON'T," THEY SO CARED TILL THEY TURNED THEIR BACK UPON THE STATUE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; GOD SO CARED FOR THEM THAT WHEN THE HEAT COME ON, HE SENT THE FOURTH MAN DOWN THERE IN THE FIRE FURNACE &gt;&gt; and kept them cool. HE CARED BECAUSE THEY CARED. &gt;&gt; If you want TO HOLD ON TO SOME CREED, GOD DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO. IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT, HE'LL NEVER CARE FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING WHAT MAN SAID. BUT IF YOU HOLD A GOD'S WORD, YOUR TRUE SINCERE CONFESSION AND BELIEF, GOD IS A HEALER. THE SAME YESTERDAY, DAD FOREVER, HE'LL care for you. &gt;&gt; He cared that. He cared for the Hebrew children. &gt;&gt; And he sent them the fourth man to deliver him, which was Christ. We know that. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE LEPER CRIED, LORD, 10 LEPERS COME OUT AND CRIED SINCERELY, LORD, AND MERCY ON US. THEY HAD ENOUGH TO CARE FOR THEIR OWN WANTS. HE HAD A POWER TO CARE FOR THEM. HE CARED FOR THE LEOPARD BECAUSE THE LEPER CARED TO MAKE THEIR CONFESSION. CALL HIM LORD. &gt;&gt; HE CARED WHEN THE CENTURION CARED ENOUGH ABOUT HIMSELF TO SEND FOR HELP FROM JESUS. &gt;&gt; When the centurion pro SHOWED BY HIS FAITH DENOUNCED HIS IDOLS OF ROME AND CARED ENOUGH BUT PUBLIC WITNESS TO SEND FOR HIM TO COME HEAL HIS SON. JESUS CARED ENOUGH TO GO HEAL YOU. &gt;&gt; He cares when you care. &gt;&gt; You got to care first, don't &gt;&gt; he? He cared. HE CARED WHEN JAS CARED ENOUGH ABOUT JESUS. HE WAS A SECRET BELIEVER. He believed HE WAS RIGHT. BUT BECAUSE OF HIS DENOMINATIONAL STAND, HE COULDN'T COME OUT AND CONFESS IT. BUT WHEN HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER GOT SICK AND DIED, JERAS KNOW THE DEATH OF HIS DAUGHTER OR TO EXPRESS HIS CARE. HE CARED ENOUGH TO DENOUNCE THE UNBELIEVERS THAT WAS AROUND HIM AND PUT ON HIS LITTLE MINISTERIAL HAT AND WENT AND FOUND JESUS. WHEN DRY SHOWED, HE CARED JESUS SHOWED. HE CARED ENOUGH TO COME AND RAISE HER UP from the dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cast your cares on him or he cares. No matter what it is, he cared. &gt;&gt; HE CARED ENOUGH WHEN THERE WAS NOT EVEN A COMMANDMENT. SO, THERE WAS NOTHING SAID SO. HE HAD NEVER MADE MENTION OF IT. BUT HE CARED BECAUSE THE LITTLE WOMAN COULDN'T GET IN THE PRAYER LINE. AND SHE SAID, "IF I COULD TOUCH THE BORDER OF HIS GARMENT, I BELIEVE HIM." &gt;&gt; HE CARED FOR HER FAITH IN THAT IN SO MUCH THAT HE TURNED AND CALLED HER OUT IN THE AUDIENCE AND TOLD HER HER FAITH HAD MADE HER WELL. &gt;&gt; He cared because the woman cared. He cared WHEN AN EROTIC CALLED LEGION CARED ENOUGH UNDER OPPOSITION TO WIGGLE OUT FROM UNDER THOSE TOMBSTONES OF DEVILS AND GO OUT TO MEET JESUS AND THROW HIMSELF PROSTRATE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; When Legion them devils would never come if LEGION HAD TO PUSH HIS way out there TO MEET HIM. AND WHEN HE CARED ENOUGH TO MAKE THAT EFFORT, THAT STAND IN HIS BELIEF, JESUS CARED ENOUGH TO CAST OUT THIS LEGION OF DEVILS FROM HIM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And his neotic condition was gone. &gt;&gt; He cared when you care. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He cares when you care. NOW, WHEN THE BLIND MAN CRIED AT THE JERICHO GATE, "OH, JESUS BEING A JEW ORTHODOX, GOOD STANDING IN THEIR SYNAGOGUE." BUT WHEN HE SAID, "WHAT'S THAT NOISE GOES BY?" THEY SAID, "JESUS OF NAZARETH HAS A PROPHET." SAID, "JESUS, THOU SON OF DAVID." OH, WHAT A REBUKE THAT WAS TO HIS PASTOR AND PRIEST &gt;&gt; THAT STOOD BY. BUT HE DIDN'T CARE WHAT PASTOR, PRIEST, OR NOTHING ELSE SAID. HE WAS INTERESTED AND HE CARED ENOUGH TO GET HIS SIGHT. SO, HE CALLED OUT. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN THAT BLIND MAN WAS READY AND CARED ENOUGH TO CALL OUT, JESUS CARED ENOUGH TO HEAL HIM. &gt;&gt; He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. He cares when you care. But you got to care first. You got to prove that you care. &gt;&gt; HE CARES SO MUCH THAT WHEN A WOMAN LIVING WITH SIX MEN, &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IDENTIFIED AND KNOWED AND RECOGNIZED HIS MESSIAH SIGN OF DISCERNMENT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE CARED ENOUGH &gt;&gt; TILL HE FORGIVE EVERY SIN &gt;&gt; AND GIVE HER WATERS THAT SHE DIDN'T COME THERE TO DRAW &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SHE RECOGNIZED &gt;&gt; SHE SAID SIR I PERCEIVE THAT YOU ARE A PROPHET WHEN HE TOLD HER WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER &gt;&gt; AND THEY SHE'S LOOKING FOR THAT DAY TO COME ONLY SHE'D BEEN ALL CHURCH GROUPED &gt;&gt; she didn't have A CHANCE TO DO IT BUT WHEN SHE SEEN A MAN WHO COULD TELL HER WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER SHE SAID SIR I PERCEIVE THAT THOU ART A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHEN THE MESSIAH COMETH, HE'LL DO THESE THINGS. HE SAID, "I'M HE." THAT'S ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; SHE CARED. SHE LEFT HER WATER POT AND INTO THE CITY SHE WENT. &gt;&gt; AND SHE SAID, "COME SEE A MAN WHO'S TOLD ME THE THINGS I'VE DONE." ISN'T THIS THE VERY MESSIAH? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; She was something like Rahab. She cared until she alarmed the whole city. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; SHE CARED BECAUSE SOMETHING HAD BEEN DONE. WOULDN'T HAVE VINDICATED. SCRIPTURE HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO PASS AND MADE POSITIVE SURE. AND SHE CARED. &gt;&gt; SHE DIDN'T CARE WHAT THE MAN SAID OR SOMEBODY ELSE SAID. SHE SEEN IT. &gt;&gt; SHE was there when it happened. &gt;&gt; She cared. &gt;&gt; AND SHE CARED FOR HER PEOPLE CUZ SHE TOLD EVERY ONE OF THEM. AND IT CAUSED THE WHOLE CITY TO BELIEVE ON JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; She cared &gt;&gt; and he cared. &gt;&gt; Certainly it didn't. Jesus cared enough for the message of the day to bring these same things to pass as he said. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Till he died and rose again to send him by the Holy Spirit, the comforter to show his ministry today that he's still alive. &gt;&gt; He cared enough. &gt;&gt; Won't we care? That's the thing. Won't we care? He died for this ministry. He died in order THAT THE HOLY SPIRIT COULD be here in this day to show these things. He cared for you. He cared to bring it here. HE CARED TO MAKE THE STATEMENT. HE CARED BECAUSE HE LOVED YOU. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; He cared enough to do it to send the Holy Spirit to this make THIS MINISTRY TODAY. THAT'S HOW HE PROVED HE CARED IN THAT DAY BECAUSE HE COME TO VINDICATE WHAT GOD SAID HE WOULD BE. THAT'S THE REASON THE WOMAN RECOGNIZED HIM. &gt;&gt; She said, "I know when Messiah cometh, he's a prophet. &gt;&gt; WHEN MESSIAH COMETH, HE'LL TELL us these things." SEE, HE CARED ENOUGH ABOUT THE WORD OF GOD TO VINDICATE IT TO HER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, HE SENT THE HOLY GHOST THAT IN THIS DAY OF INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTION THAT HE MIGHT BY THE SAME HOLY SPIRIT PROVE THROUGH US THAT HE'S STILL THE MESSIAH. &gt;&gt; Prove in the same way he's the same yesterday, TODAY, AND FOREVER. &gt;&gt; NOW, THE QUESTION IS, do you care? &gt;&gt; What do you think about it? &gt;&gt; It's here. It's been proven over and over. DO YOU CARE ENOUGH TO believe it? DO YOU CARE ENOUGH TO CONFESS YOUR SINS THAT YOU'RE WRONG? &gt;&gt; CONFESS YOUR UNBELIEF &gt;&gt; AND ACCEPT IT. &gt;&gt; DO YOU CARE ENOUGH TO ACCEPT IT? HE CARED ENOUGH TO DIE AND RISE AGAIN TO BRING IT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; Do you care enough to accept it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S PROVEN ALL THROUGH FROM NOAH'S TIME ALL THE WAY BACK FROM GENESIS ALL THE WAY THROUGH. WE AIN'T GOT TIME TO GET TO IT ALL. BUT YOU SEE THAT HE CARES &gt;&gt; AND HE DIED THAT YOU MIGHT CARE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A WAY. AND HE'S BROUGHT THAT WAY. HE SAID EXACTLY WHAT THAT WAY WOULD DONE WOULD DO. AND NOW HERE HE IS TODAY SHOWING IT'S A TRUTH. &gt;&gt; NOW IN THIS EVIL HOUR THAT WE'RE LIVING IN, DO YOU CARE ENOUGH ABOUT IT &gt;&gt; TO WITH ALL YOUR HEART BELIEVE IT? &gt;&gt; WHETHER YOU STRIKE A PRAYER LINE OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT ISN'T IT? DO YOU CARE? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Cast your cares upon him. &gt;&gt; He cares for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; BE SINCERE ABOUT IT. YOU CARE ENOUGH TO BE SINCERE. FOR HE HAS PROVEN BY HIS AICATED WORD THAT HE CARES. &gt;&gt; HE PROMISED TO SEND IT. HE'S DONE IT. HE PROMISED IN THE WORD. HERE IT IS. &gt;&gt; He cares. NOW, WHAT ABOUT YOU? YOU ALREADY CARING THIS. &gt;&gt; He cared enough. He cared enough to conquer every enemy for you that all you have to do is to be sincere and believe it. He conquered death. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DEATH AIN'T nothing for me to conquer. It's already conquered. &gt;&gt; Sickness ain't for me to conquer. &gt;&gt; IT AIN'T FOR CHRIST TO CONQUER. IT'S ALREADY CONQUERED. &gt;&gt; I just have to care enough to believe it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you afraid of what somebody else has told you? &gt;&gt; ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DOCTOR'S DIAGNOSIS? &gt;&gt; Are you afraid of what the church will say to you? &gt;&gt; Are you afraid to stand a told to THE DEVIL SAY, "I'LL CONFESS MY SINS. I'LL LAID ASIDE EVERYTHING. I BELIEVED EVERY WORD. &gt;&gt; I AM LORD &gt;&gt; CREATED me a care. &gt;&gt; I You cared for me. I care for you. &gt;&gt; I think of that gracious old song. He carth for you &gt;&gt; through sunshines or shadows. &gt;&gt; He cares for you. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads now. We just can't go any further. &gt;&gt; He carth for you.

Made yourself real, vindicated yourself, Lord. You just need a people who care. You need a people, Lord, who reach out and repent with sincerity. Lord, that's all you need to work with. And Lord, we've learned this through this service that you gave us. Lord, it's more than a service. It's a key. Father, help us, Lord God, in our time when we leave this place in our everyday life. Help us, Lord Jesus, to take this key and unlock the things that are locked up.

Lord, we're thankful tonight as we bring the service to a close. We pray, Father, that you've deposited something within us that we could use every day against the enemy. We thank you, Father, we lift our hands and surrender to you and believe, Father, that all things are possible to the God that we believe in. May you come into our lives and come into our situations, Lord Jesus. May we humbly, as Peter has taught us in the Bible, that Lord, we humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God. And that humility would make us cast all of our cares, our burdens, our sins, everything. May we cast it on you because you care so much for us. Thank you, Father. Bless us and protect the people as they go home tonight on the roads and in their homes. Lord, until we meet and gathered together again, we commit the service now to you in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
