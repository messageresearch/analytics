[0:00] jonah
[0:01] this evening
[0:02] and a little minor prophet books
[0:05] sometimes hard to find and just find
[0:07] daniel and go three four books over from
[0:09] there and you're running right into
[0:11] jonah
[0:12] amen daniel's pretty easy one to find
[0:15] amen you don't want to have a sunday
[0:17] school kid beat you to the scripture so
[0:18] i'm trying to help you
[0:24] amen
[0:26] well we're happy to be here and i'm
[0:28] that's pretty loud up here guys so
[0:31] um
[0:33] amen that's sounding a little better
[0:35] praise the lord
[0:37] happy to be here and uh this has been a
[0:40] quite a busy year for me
[0:42] rather remarkably so i i normally
[0:45] would never have taken as many
[0:48] uh services as i have i've been going
[0:50] every month uh usually twice a month
[0:52] since the new year and that's pretty
[0:54] unusual
[0:56] but the lord kept telling me to accept
[0:58] and to accept and so
[1:00] amen when when i spoke to brother paul
[1:02] we had actually kind of already
[1:04] brainstormed it a little bit at the
[1:06] men's meeting and so he was following up
[1:08] and since he was first in line i
[1:10] couldn't say no plus then the lord told
[1:12] me to say yes so
[1:13] here i am amen
[1:15] it makes me nervous to preach
[1:18] in front of
[1:19] so many good ministers and brother paul
[1:22] particularly
[1:23] is probably
[1:24] right at the top of my list
[1:26] and has been forever i so enjoy
[1:29] brother paul's style of ministry his
[1:32] content
[1:33] his sincerity and his heart for the
[1:35] people
[1:36] so you're quite blessed here amen
[1:39] amen praise the lord you want to be
[1:41] thankful to god always
[1:43] amen um
[1:44] you know the bride of christ is looking
[1:46] for stable solid ministry a place where
[1:50] they can bring their families to and
[1:52] this is a shaking hour it's a
[1:53] troublesome time
[1:55] but we're we're to have shalom
[1:58] and god has provided that amen praise
[2:01] the lord so we're
[2:02] thanking the lord
[2:04] for what we see here nice beautiful
[2:06] facility amen but of course brother
[2:08] branham said the real beauty of any
[2:10] church is the character of the people
[2:12] amen so we're thankful
[2:15] that there's such a
[2:16] building project here that's been going
[2:19] on for
[2:20] how many years now brother paul
[2:25] that bad huh
[2:27] yeah
[2:28] so old timer's already setting it on him
[2:29] he don't even remember how long he's
[2:30] been pastoring
[2:32] amen but it's uh but it's been a
[2:34] building project in case you didn't know
[2:36] that amen that's what a pastor's job is
[2:39] he he
[2:40] he leaves the father's
[2:42] uh
[2:43] kingdom
[2:44] and the lord says here's a here's a
[2:46] here's a group of sheep
[2:48] take them into the world and
[2:50] and grow them and care for them and
[2:53] mature them and bring them back to me
[2:55] healthy and bearing wool
[2:58] and that's that's i'd say he's done a
[3:00] very good job for the master amen
[3:04] jonah chapter 2 and we'll just read up
[3:07] verses 1 through 10 and let you be
[3:09] seated it's extremely familiar to us
[3:12] then jonah verse 1 jonah chapter 2 verse
[3:15] 1 then jonah prayed unto the lord his
[3:18] god
[3:19] out of the fish's belly
[3:22] and said i cried by reason of mine
[3:24] affliction unto the lord
[3:27] and he heard me out of the belly of hell
[3:30] cried i and thou heardest my voice
[3:34] for thou hast cast me catch who look who
[3:37] did it
[3:39] see
[3:40] it it actually wasn't those
[3:43] boatmen those other seamen that threw
[3:45] him in
[3:46] god threw him in
[3:47] see
[3:49] for thou had cast me into the deep in
[3:52] the midst of the seas and the floods
[3:55] come passed me about
[3:57] all thy billows and thy waves passed
[3:59] over me then i said i am cast out of thy
[4:02] sight
[4:03] yet i will look again toward thy holy
[4:06] temple the waters come past me even to
[4:09] the soul
[4:10] the depth closed me round about the
[4:13] weeds were wrapped around my head
[4:15] brother branham you can see why brother
[4:17] brandon would say nobody had a set of
[4:19] circumstances like jonah
[4:22] amen so no matter how sorry for yourself
[4:24] you ever feel just go read jonah amen i
[4:27] went down to the bottoms of the
[4:29] mountains
[4:30] the earth with her bars
[4:32] was about me forever
[4:34] yet hast thou brought up my life from
[4:37] corruption
[4:39] oh lord my god he says now watch verse 7
[4:42] and when my soul fainted within me i
[4:46] remembered the lord good advice didn't
[4:48] it and my prayer came in unto thee
[4:52] into thine holy temple
[4:54] they that observe lying vanities forsake
[4:58] their own mercy
[4:59] so you want to remember
[5:02] that jonah made a conscious proactive
[5:06] decision
[5:07] to call the symptoms the lie
[5:11] and he called the promise the real
[5:15] that's that's proactive you got to do
[5:18] that
[5:18] he actually looked at very real symptoms
[5:21] this is not a metaphor this isn't a
[5:23] fairy tale this really happened to a
[5:24] human in real time amen and he looked at
[5:28] the symptoms which could not be equaled
[5:30] by anything you'll ever face
[5:32] and he made a choice to call the
[5:34] symptoms of the lie
[5:37] looking right at him with a wrapped all
[5:38] around him and he called that a lie and
[5:41] he remembered solomon's words and he
[5:44] said that's the truth
[5:48] so he says
[5:51] verse 8 again they that observe lying
[5:53] vanities forsake their own mercy see so
[5:56] you don't just keep looking at those
[5:57] circumstances you forsake your own
[5:59] mercies doing that
[6:01] but i will sacrifice unto thee with the
[6:04] voice of thanksgiving it's amazing he
[6:06] couldn't bring a lamb
[6:07] he couldn't build a fire he couldn't
[6:09] build an altar so he gave him the
[6:11] sacrifice of praise amen i will pay
[6:15] that that i have vowed salvation is of
[6:19] the lord and the and the lord spake unto
[6:22] the fish and it vomited out jonah upon
[6:26] the dry land
[6:28] let's pray
[6:31] master
[6:32] we thank you very kindly lord as i stand
[6:35] here tonight
[6:36] and lord i the enemy has fought this
[6:39] sore and
[6:40] but he he ain't nobody lord i remind him
[6:43] all the time satan you're nobody you
[6:45] don't have any say in my life lord i
[6:48] don't live by the mercies of lucifer i
[6:51] live by the mercies of the lord jesus
[6:53] christ
[6:54] lord and i will not forsake my own
[6:56] mercies tonight i will call everything
[6:58] the enemy has tried as a lie
[7:01] lord it's just a distraction and it's
[7:03] not going to catch my attention lord i
[7:05] my attention now it's focused on your
[7:07] word and i give myself to it humbly and
[7:10] unreservedly not determined not to take
[7:13] my own thought lord i'm just your
[7:15] assistant that's all i am they sang a
[7:18] song they invited me up here and i just
[7:21] followed you up here lord that's all
[7:23] i've done that's all i it's all i wanted
[7:25] to do and here i stand lord now take
[7:28] your word this is this is your people
[7:31] this is your plan this is your message
[7:34] this is your purpose this is your
[7:36] everything lord so we commit it now to
[7:39] you holy and entirely in the name of
[7:42] jesus christ amen god bless you friends
[7:45] you can be seated
[8:03] brother branham
[8:06] took a sermon and i i kind of in on
[8:08] purpose tonight decided not to put
[8:11] anything on a display
[8:13] because i i just i don't want to read
[8:15] these quotes in their entirety but i
[8:17] just want to
[8:18] take some snippets and read them out to
[8:20] you
[8:21] and try to get your mind going in the
[8:23] same direction as mine
[8:26] and uh brother branham in the message i
[8:28] am
[8:29] the resurrection and life
[8:32] uh he preached this sermon at the
[8:34] funeral of garnet peak
[8:36] and brother branham was just so
[8:38] impressed with that young man
[8:41] and uh with his his humble way
[8:44] and his here he was suffering had been
[8:47] suffering for many years
[8:49] and yet he he didn't blame god he
[8:52] actually glorified god to his dying day
[8:55] and we find here that brother branham is
[8:57] trying to get the audience he's
[8:59] preaching this over in kentucky uh back
[9:02] you know among some of his own people
[9:04] and he starts talking about how that if
[9:06] a seed is planted
[9:08] uh no matter how nice that seed looks if
[9:11] that seed is not germatized it will not
[9:14] live
[9:14] i love brother branham's simple ways i
[9:17] love the fact we were we were rehearsing
[9:19] today team of ministers and i sitting
[9:21] there and we got to talking about
[9:23] quantum mechanics and quantum
[9:25] entanglement that's a favorite
[9:27] topic of mine and and and i said you
[9:29] know it's it's amazing that science
[9:32] proves the existence of god and they're
[9:34] too ignorant to see it and the bible
[9:36] says that in their wisdom they became
[9:38] fools
[9:40] and so you really
[9:41] you want to get a clear understanding of
[9:44] the laws of the physical universe just
[9:46] read hillbilly prophet and you'll learn
[9:48] more about the nature of man and the
[9:50] nature of nature amen and the nature of
[9:53] god
[9:54] amen and once you see it all of that
[9:56] then it all makes sense and and so
[9:59] we find here that he makes this simple
[10:01] statement it's got to be germatized it
[10:04] it'll go into the ground and will rot
[10:06] and that's the end of it all right so he
[10:09] says now that how that jesus said except
[10:12] a man be born again he cannot see the
[10:15] kingdom of god so brother branham says
[10:18] we are placed here to make a choice and
[10:21] now he bear in mind he's preaching the
[10:24] funeral of this
[10:26] a wonderful sainted young man very godly
[10:28] young man that brother branham not only
[10:30] loved him but admired him would you love
[10:33] to be admired by a prophet and and he's
[10:36] talking about now he's trying to get the
[10:38] audience who have come to the funeral
[10:40] that's why i love preaching funerals i i
[10:42] don't like preaching weddings because
[10:44] everything's nervous and rehearsed and
[10:46] practiced and oh my goodness if you make
[10:48] a mistake it's second chernobyl and it's
[10:51] the end of the world
[10:53] and but but i love funerals and somebody
[10:55] said why do you love preaching a funeral
[10:57] i said because nobody will walk out on
[10:59] you and say whatever you want to say
[11:01] it doesn't even matter what you say
[11:02] everybody will sit there because the
[11:03] funeral
[11:04] and so plus you know
[11:07] if you're preaching the funeral of a
[11:08] believer then it's really not a funeral
[11:12] amen praise the lord uh brother paul and
[11:15] i were talking about that we both lost
[11:17] our dad um you know and uh over recent
[11:20] years and i was talking to my mom and
[11:22] she made the statement and brother paul
[11:24] kind of made the same statement so i
[11:26] jumped in with the same one-liner and uh
[11:28] brother paul started coming out and
[11:29] brother john died i said brother paul
[11:31] he didn't die
[11:34] he's not dead
[11:36] brother eddie brother john no no they're
[11:37] not dead they're more alive than any of
[11:39] us
[11:41] i promise you'd rather be with them than
[11:42] here
[11:45] amen
[11:46] so so when you're when you're preaching
[11:48] it that way and and you can you can even
[11:50] hear brother branham you know he's
[11:52] trying to get this kentucky audience to
[11:54] understand he's trying to get them to to
[11:56] understand the choice that garnet made
[11:58] he's trying to get them to make the same
[12:00] choice
[12:01] that he says it's got to be germatized
[12:03] hybrid corn you can plant it it won't do
[12:05] anything it's a nice seed but it doesn't
[12:08] have life it's a it's a it's life is
[12:10] perverted see
[12:11] and so this is why hybrid religion can
[12:14] never give you life it's got to be the
[12:16] living word of the age that you live in
[12:18] that's the only source that's able to to
[12:22] germatize the seed of god that's inside
[12:24] you the only thing that can bring that
[12:26] gene to life is the word of god the
[12:29] bible teaches that very clearly that
[12:32] we're not born of corruptible seed but
[12:34] of incorruptible by the word see
[12:37] and so it is faith in the word of god
[12:40] that brings the new birth it always has
[12:42] been that way it's never not been that
[12:44] way
[12:44] and so brother branham says any
[12:46] perverted life from god cannot live
[12:49] again we must be born again
[12:52] you know echoing the words of our lord
[12:55] you must be born again he says a
[12:57] believer has the life of christ within
[13:00] him i understand brother diggs was
[13:01] preaching along the gene of god last
[13:03] night
[13:04] but he talks about here a believer has
[13:07] the life of christ within him who rose
[13:09] up first for our justification to prove
[13:12] there is resurrection of human life a
[13:15] human body see because we because we
[13:18] live again because we've been germatized
[13:21] in other words
[13:22] uh born again of the holy spirit that's
[13:24] what germatized means if you ever wonder
[13:27] what it means to be germatized you're
[13:29] born again of the spirit of god that
[13:31] gene of god which is dormant in you
[13:34] but comes to life and that life that's
[13:36] inside it is zoe life that's god's life
[13:40] and that's god living inside of you
[13:42] and that's god continuing his program
[13:45] inside of you
[13:47] oh my friends that's where we have to
[13:50] remember
[13:51] you know i remember back in the in the
[13:53] day brother lonnie used to always make
[13:54] that point we've always got to see where
[13:57] the i am is that's so vital to see where
[14:00] the i am is that's when moses when he
[14:03] says
[14:04] they're going to ask me who sent you and
[14:07] what answer am i going to give them and
[14:08] god said you're going to say to them i
[14:11] am hath sent me in other words moses
[14:14] when they ask you who you are who sent
[14:16] you what authority do you have just say
[14:18] you're me
[14:21] just say i am hath sent me
[14:24] i'm here with the word inside of me and
[14:27] therefore the word i'm giving to you is
[14:29] his word
[14:30] and it has creative power in it
[14:33] now it's too early to get preaching yet
[14:34] so just calm down everybody
[14:38] so he says wherever you go whatever you
[14:41] look at see it's impossible to pass over
[14:45] these three concepts that are in nature
[14:47] death burial and resurrection we find
[14:50] out that resurrection only comes when it
[14:52] serves god's purpose that's an important
[14:54] point we find out that resurrection only
[14:57] comes when it serves god's purpose if it
[15:00] doesn't serve god's purpose no matter
[15:02] how beautiful it is how pretty it looks
[15:05] how much better it might look than some
[15:07] other seed that is germatized it'll
[15:10] never rise
[15:12] so you know it doesn't matter i mean
[15:14] this this auditorium is prettier than
[15:17] many auditoriums but it won't matter
[15:19] there's got to be germination take place
[15:21] here
[15:22] see you say well it's a wonderful
[15:24] facility that's fine and dandy but that
[15:26] the beauty of it the the the convenience
[15:29] of it won't get you a body change
[15:32] it'll take the word to do that it'll
[15:34] take your faith in the word to do that
[15:39] so if you if you don't then then all of
[15:42] your accomplishments we were pointing
[15:44] out to the church back home how that you
[15:47] know that
[15:48] paul talks about how and i don't want to
[15:50] get ahead of myself but how that paul's
[15:53] paul's great goal was that i may know
[15:56] him
[15:56] and the power of his resurrection i mean
[15:59] what else is there besides that for a
[16:01] believer i mean come on what what is it
[16:03] that you would chase more important than
[16:05] that
[16:07] i may know him in the power of his
[16:10] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[16:12] sufferings being made conformable unto
[16:15] his death why what's the point so that i
[16:17] can be a partaker of his life
[16:20] because life's all that matters nothing
[16:22] else matters life i gotta have life
[16:25] whatever you accomplish here wouldn't
[16:27] matter i said to the church there's been
[16:30] many great philosophers and many great
[16:32] uh educated men many great politicians
[16:35] many great uh champions of war and
[16:37] champions of politics and champions of
[16:39] education and and they knew the word of
[16:42] god they knew what it said they chose
[16:44] not to have anything to do with it so
[16:46] what does their life equal today
[16:50] zero
[16:51] for them
[16:52] we're we're here enjoying some of their
[16:55] knowledge they left to the world some of
[16:57] the inventions they left they're not
[16:59] enjoying it anymore
[17:01] see
[17:02] so so i'm enjoying it they're not
[17:05] so there's nothing more important than
[17:08] the pursuit of life
[17:12] he says you we might belong to church we
[17:14] might be fine people we might be a good
[17:16] character in the neighborhood a fine
[17:18] father mother sis son daughter
[17:21] but unless we are germatized with the
[17:24] spirit of god we will never rise in the
[17:27] resurrection it's finished
[17:30] i'm just wrapping uh these quotes up
[17:32] here i want to get them out of the way
[17:33] quickly nature calls out day by day the
[17:36] sun rises and sets the moon and stars
[17:38] come out the same the same thing
[17:40] everything in nature revolves in one
[17:42] thing death burial and resurrection
[17:44] isn't that funny he would call it one
[17:46] thing
[17:47] death burial and resurrection how's that
[17:50] one thing because it's all part of one
[17:52] thing as brother branham said in christ
[17:54] as a mystery god revealed the whole
[17:56] bible everything all the people all the
[17:59] stories everything that was ever written
[18:01] brother branham said god was working out
[18:03] one goal
[18:05] one purpose that he had in all the bible
[18:08] and everything and he says and and this
[18:10] afternoon we're going to look and see
[18:12] what that is and it turns out to be
[18:14] expression that god's whole purpose was
[18:16] to express himself god in christ and
[18:19] christ in you
[18:20] that's the hope of glory
[18:23] there's nothing else to give us any hope
[18:25] except that hope see
[18:29] so he says that um
[18:32] it's all one thing it's all a
[18:34] continuation now i can't i gotta breathe
[18:36] super careful because i'll really get
[18:38] into the morning material if i
[18:40] don't stop myself
[18:43] so death burial and resurrection death
[18:45] burial and resurrection it keeps
[18:46] repeating it everything in nature
[18:48] revolves around it every day of our life
[18:50] something is testifying to us death
[18:51] burial and resurrection we walk over the
[18:53] top of it many times but it's it's it's
[18:56] it's about eternal life it's got to be
[18:58] germanized and serve the purpose of god
[19:01] if it doesn't it cannot rise neither
[19:03] will we rise though we be good people
[19:06] and he's going to say it some more in
[19:07] case you missed it when he's talking
[19:09] about just being a good neighbor good
[19:11] character good father good mother good
[19:13] son good daughter and he goes on he says
[19:15] that that that though we be good people
[19:18] though we be church members though we be
[19:21] gallant neighbors fine people educated
[19:25] smart see life belongs to god alone
[19:32] and he's the only one who handles life
[19:34] so we must come to that place to be
[19:35] germatized by the word of god or will
[19:38] never rise again our life is totally
[19:39] finished see when we finish this life
[19:42] here that does it all together see if
[19:44] we're if we're not germatized by the
[19:46] word of god or any he just uses the
[19:50] other phrase or by the life of god
[19:52] see same thing you're going to really
[19:54] learn between tonight and tomorrow that
[19:56] the word of god is the life of god and
[19:58] the life of god is the word of god and
[20:00] the gene of god is the life of god and
[20:01] the gene of god is the word of god
[20:03] hallelujah it's all god continuing
[20:05] himself
[20:08] so we have our choice finally
[20:11] we have our choice
[20:13] we can be germatized by god you got this
[20:15] choice here tonight friends
[20:17] we can be germatized by god by his holy
[20:20] spirit and we can have eternal life if
[20:22] we don't
[20:24] when we die
[20:27] that's it
[20:30] we're ready for the judgment then
[20:33] why we didn't do it then the punishment
[20:36] it follows that for rejecting it
[20:40] so it becomes paramount friends
[20:42] that we can never
[20:44] bypass
[20:46] the most fundamental purpose of that day
[20:49] on calvary which was christ's
[20:53] death and we find out that that his
[20:56] death on the cross
[20:57] and his resurrection from the grave
[21:00] made the way for you to be born again
[21:04] see made the way for you to be born
[21:06] again there's no need to to go through
[21:09] life
[21:10] trying to to if you're a black bird
[21:13] trying to stick peacock feathers in your
[21:15] tail and claim you're a peacock doesn't
[21:18] matter set in a peacock church all you
[21:21] want
[21:22] have a perfect peacock pastor
[21:25] but you'll still be a blackbird you'll
[21:27] go out of here every sunday with with
[21:29] new shiny fluffy peacock feathers they
[21:32] won't stay in
[21:34] you'll have to come back next sunday and
[21:36] get some more they'll fall out you'll
[21:38] lose them you'll misplace them what did
[21:40] i do with my feathers because it's not
[21:42] indigenous it's not natural to you the
[21:44] thing that the thing that makes you a
[21:46] christian the thing that's most
[21:48] indigenous to you as a son of god is a
[21:50] gene of god
[21:52] and there's got to come a time when the
[21:54] omnipotent word meets an omnipotent word
[21:57] and life comes out of that
[21:59] [Applause]
[22:00] then you're off and running then you're
[22:02] building and then you're adding and then
[22:03] you're maturing
[22:06] of course
[22:08] see
[22:09] so it's it's becoming a brand new man as
[22:13] paul would say with a completely new
[22:15] nature not the one paul says we were all
[22:17] at one time had our conversation a lust
[22:19] of the flesh the things of the world and
[22:21] we're by very nature the children of
[22:22] wrath even as others but that that
[22:24] nature was not your original one
[22:27] the original one is god see
[22:30] so the question has never been you know
[22:32] where am i going when i die the question
[22:34] has always been where did i come from
[22:38] see i come from god i'm going back to
[22:39] god
[22:40] and there is not enough devils in hell
[22:42] that can stop that there's not enough
[22:44] circumstances can separate me doesn't
[22:46] matter what the circumstance is and
[22:48] nothing could separate jonah
[22:51] he had the worst set of circumstances
[22:53] imaginable but yet when he prayed god
[22:56] heard from heaven
[22:58] see
[23:00] so we're we we find out that it you
[23:03] become a brand new man with a brand new
[23:05] nature and a life following that
[23:07] demonstrates that supernatural change
[23:09] it's not natural
[23:12] born again of the same spirit that dwelt
[23:14] in christ that's the beauty
[23:17] of that day on calvary
[23:20] it gives you access to that same spirit
[23:22] that raised jesus from the grave if it
[23:25] dwell in you it shall also quicken your
[23:27] mortal body
[23:29] see so
[23:31] so when you when you don't
[23:33] when you when you just try to do an end
[23:35] around on that when you try to
[23:36] circumnavigate that and try to go
[23:38] forward serving god then you really you
[23:41] don't realize it but you obscure the
[23:43] reality
[23:44] that you you didn't become a son of god
[23:47] when you repented
[23:49] you found out that you were always a son
[23:52] of god
[23:53] once you're born of the spirit that you
[23:55] you've now begun as brother beckett
[23:57] would say you're now cooperating in the
[23:59] vision of god whose vision god's vision
[24:02] god had a vision of of me yes of you
[24:05] exactly and every day he's working to
[24:08] bring you to that vision i don't know
[24:10] what's happened in your life yesterday
[24:11] last week or what will happen tomorrow
[24:13] but i know what he's doing he's bringing
[24:15] you to a vision
[24:20] you discovered you'd always been a son
[24:22] from the loins of god you're having his
[24:24] seed gene placed deep inside you
[24:27] and and and and and the day you know
[24:30] that that happened brother brown says
[24:32] the day you were put into the earth when
[24:34] you became a living soul
[24:36] and that's an interesting term in the
[24:38] old testament a living soul
[24:40] because adam was formed out of the out
[24:42] of the dust of the earth
[24:44] and and then he became a living soul
[24:46] created he's the only animal built in
[24:49] the image of god and therefore the whole
[24:52] term living soul tr when you take it
[24:54] through the hebrew it's literally saying
[24:58] that it's praying dirt
[25:02] because
[25:03] a man is the only one who prays yes
[25:06] no other animal prays
[25:08] no other animal worships
[25:10] only a human why because he became a
[25:12] living soul see so now now god is
[25:16] connecting himself to the earth oh my oh
[25:20] my okay
[25:22] so he's so now we find then that
[25:26] that we
[25:27] we we certainly believe in spiritual
[25:30] growth and maturity that's what coming
[25:32] to church does that's what reading your
[25:34] bible and praying does
[25:36] and and but but you want to understand
[25:38] that that that maturing that growth is a
[25:42] continuation
[25:44] of a yielding that began
[25:47] in that first total surrender that's
[25:49] what it is it's not something different
[25:52] it's a continuation of that original
[25:55] total complete surrender a life comes
[25:58] forward and you just go the rest of your
[26:00] life surrendering surrendering
[26:02] surrendering surrendering say what does
[26:03] that do for me you grow you grow you
[26:05] grow you grow into whose image his image
[26:10] hallelujah
[26:13] it's a total surrender
[26:16] we receive this newness of life and
[26:19] and it you know it's a it's a it's this
[26:21] complete surrender that brings the gene
[26:23] of god to life and it's not hard to get
[26:26] i i i've been you know several times out
[26:30] this year preaching
[26:31] uh to to young people and my i remember
[26:34] growing up with this message and i don't
[26:37] goodness gracious the the holy ghost was
[26:39] like getting the baptism the holy ghost
[26:41] like pulling teeth like how do in the
[26:42] world do i even do it man that's so hard
[26:45] and and we'd come constantly constantly
[26:47] constantly costly come to the altars
[26:49] come to the altars come to the altars
[26:50] come to the altars say my goodness when
[26:53] is it going to finally change my life
[26:55] and and i want to tell you something
[26:57] tonight the holy ghost is not hard to
[26:59] get
[27:02] in fact his brother brandon would say
[27:04] god wants to give you that more than you
[27:06] want to receive it
[27:07] see
[27:08] so okay well then do tell what's the
[27:11] secret repent
[27:15] repent
[27:17] that's the only requirement that's ever
[27:18] been and then you don't wait 10 days or
[27:22] 10 hours you don't wait 10 minutes you
[27:24] don't have to wait 10 seconds but what
[27:26] you do have to have is a 100 percent
[27:29] total complete
[27:31] surrender
[27:32] you have to have a complete repentance
[27:34] and if you don't i'm here to tell your
[27:37] friends then god will never seal that
[27:39] vessel until that heart is completely
[27:41] 100
[27:43] you have come to know christ and by the
[27:45] time god gets you to that place i'm here
[27:48] to tell you you are so done with being
[27:51] you and you meet him and you don't want
[27:54] to be you anymore you want to be him
[27:57] hallelujah
[28:01] see this is exactly what they did in the
[28:04] book of acts they repented
[28:06] see and they they followed on to know
[28:09] the lord as hosea because that's the pro
[28:12] that's the promise in the old testament
[28:14] if people would just say man can you
[28:16] define the holy ghost it's not hard to
[28:17] do go read your old testament look what
[28:19] was promised to israel
[28:21] and israel spurned it went to the
[28:22] gentiles what were they promised i'm
[28:25] going to take out your stony heart
[28:27] i'm not going to just live above you i'm
[28:28] going to come down and live with you and
[28:30] i'm going to be a redeemer and then i'm
[28:32] going to live inside you and you're
[28:34] going to be a continuation of me
[28:37] hallelujah this is the jubilee
[28:40] [Applause]
[28:41] how is it today that somebody could
[28:44] imagine that they don't want that
[28:46] jubilee
[28:47] and say and i i get what you're what you
[28:50] run from a lot of times because we
[28:52] sometimes we see fanaticism we see
[28:55] misinterpreted theology and and we see
[28:57] you know all kinds of things that go on
[28:59] but i'm here to tell you don't let
[29:01] scarecrows keep you from a
[29:03] fire-breathing experience of the holy
[29:06] ghost it's the only thing that can
[29:08] change your life
[29:09] [Applause]
[29:11] see
[29:13] and so he will raise us up and we shall
[29:16] live in his sight then shall we know
[29:19] if we follow on to know the lord because
[29:21] the goal remember
[29:23] that the goal
[29:25] is a divine goal restoring you to the
[29:29] perfection of christ now i'm going to
[29:30] say a little bit more about that
[29:32] momentarily but but this is what paul
[29:34] was teaching the colossian church to
[29:37] whom god would make known what is the
[29:40] riches of the glory of this mystery
[29:43] among the gentiles which is christ in
[29:45] you the hope of glory whom we preach
[29:48] warning every man and teaching every man
[29:50] in all wisdom here's why here's the
[29:53] whole reason here's here's the payoff
[29:55] that we may present every man perfect
[30:00] in christ jesus see and so so you you
[30:03] and then you can see that if you if you
[30:05] just read acts 2 38 and then 39 and then
[30:09] 40 you're gonna find out they they
[30:10] become pricked in their hearts they
[30:12] repent there's thousands added to the
[30:14] church and then you know the next the
[30:16] very next thing you begin seeing
[30:17] immediately without any delay
[30:19] immediately you begin seeing then they
[30:21] that gladly received his word were
[30:23] baptized so they are immediately obeying
[30:25] the word
[30:26] and the same day were added three
[30:28] thousand souls verse 42 and they
[30:30] continued steadfastly in the apostles
[30:33] doctrine and fellowship and the breaking
[30:35] of bread and in prayers hallelujah and
[30:38] and that that's the evidence of the
[30:40] token is when you can say amen to every
[30:43] word
[30:44] not mental ascent but your life is
[30:46] saying amen that's what happened to them
[30:49] they continued steadfastly in the
[30:51] apostles doctrine
[30:52] [Applause]
[30:54] see
[30:56] because when you believe his word
[30:58] friends
[30:59] you can't you can't make it happen mary
[31:01] couldn't make it happen
[31:03] but mary could believe a word
[31:06] and i'm here to tell you something
[31:07] friends when i when when a child of god
[31:10] is confronted by the word of god there's
[31:13] really only one thing that child god can
[31:15] do and that's say amen
[31:18] and you see in the case with mary and
[31:20] the angel as soon as a a child of god
[31:23] says amen to the word there's only one
[31:25] thing god can do and that's bring it to
[31:27] pass he can't do anything different he
[31:30] has to bring it to pass
[31:32] because you said amen
[31:35] you believed it now he has no option but
[31:38] to do it
[31:40] hallelujah see
[31:42] so it's a definite experience that you
[31:45] have
[31:46] with the person of christ this is what
[31:48] restores the title deed to the church
[31:50] that's what came back to us under the
[31:52] seventh seal
[31:54] it gave us the abstract back it gave us
[31:56] the token back
[31:58] amen
[31:59] so don't don't don't be afraid of that
[32:02] my goodness people say well brother
[32:04] branham said you can't mix pentecost
[32:06] with this message
[32:08] well brother branham's certainly not
[32:09] talking about what happened in the upper
[32:11] room
[32:12] that's what the the upper room is what
[32:14] the message came to take us back to
[32:17] that's what the mess is all about
[32:18] receiving the token receiving the person
[32:21] getting the title deed an abstract deed
[32:24] backing a jubilee
[32:27] hallelujah
[32:29] it's obvious brother branham is talking
[32:31] about what became of the israelis a
[32:33] revival
[32:34] not talking about an original experience
[32:36] my goodness
[32:38] see so
[32:40] so of course we don't mix what became of
[32:43] the azusa revival with this the original
[32:45] azusa revival you it's part of this it's
[32:48] part of the part of the restoration of
[32:49] the bride tree
[32:51] but it but it but what it turned into
[32:53] because brother branham kept warning
[32:55] them he kept warning them you're going
[32:57] to keep sowing denominational seed and
[33:00] when the latter rain comes that's what
[33:03] you're going to be stuck with
[33:05] and you better stop now while it's
[33:07] former rain because as soon as that
[33:09] ladder rain comes that's it there's not
[33:11] another revival coming to the bride then
[33:13] the revival of the last day
[33:16] and when that revival came and seals
[33:17] were open you know what that happened to
[33:19] them they were stuck
[33:21] there's no way to receive those seals
[33:22] and so they had one option kick christ
[33:24] out and when they kept christ out god
[33:26] had one option have a prophet indict
[33:29] them for the second crucifixion of the
[33:32] lord jesus christ
[33:33] [Applause]
[33:35] and call a bride out of among the
[33:38] man-made systems so you're not part of
[33:40] that see
[33:42] so we are
[33:44] we are enjoying our latter reign we're
[33:46] enjoying our revival it is the bride's
[33:49] revival it's the word
[33:50] made flesh again
[33:53] i got to keep moving
[33:55] i got it i got to keep moving all right
[33:57] well we'll we'll go back in the morning
[33:59] the lord willing
[34:01] uh
[34:02] that's always subject to change but
[34:03] that's my plan anyway
[34:06] sometimes you get carjacked and you
[34:08] driving home and
[34:10] boom you you got to do something
[34:11] different
[34:13] so so we find then that
[34:16] that it is christ himself
[34:19] living his life from the throne of your
[34:21] surrendered heart
[34:23] a nature that was always inside the gene
[34:28] of god that was inside of you
[34:30] by election see
[34:33] and so you know it's dormant why you
[34:34] lived in sin before coming to know the
[34:36] lord so so then the so then the new
[34:39] birth is the perfect emergence
[34:42] of a brand new life within you just as a
[34:46] baby is separated from its mother when
[34:48] it when it's born it's a completely
[34:50] different unit and that's what brother
[34:52] brandon would say a brand new life when
[34:55] it breathes its its breath it breathed
[34:57] in the its own life its own personality
[35:00] and that's why brother branham would use
[35:01] the term
[35:02] brand new unit
[35:05] yet you're
[35:07] here we go brother oh my
[35:09] oh no i'm not
[35:11] i'm not going there
[35:12] oh my that's what we were talking about
[35:14] today but this is the continuation
[35:17] of god's life
[35:20] that's why only the that's why only the
[35:22] predestinated are considered in
[35:23] redemption
[35:24] it's not that god doesn't offer a legit
[35:26] chance to anyone to save himself from
[35:28] the sun toward generation you understand
[35:30] the foolish virgin not are not saved in
[35:33] the tribulation they're already saved
[35:35] from destruction
[35:36] but they don't go in the rapture because
[35:38] they're not born again
[35:40] you see what i'm saying they've never
[35:41] been germatized brother branham said
[35:42] they never got the moisture to make the
[35:44] seed grow
[35:45] see all right so so this is why we find
[35:48] that predestination of course is a
[35:50] byproduct of election and elections
[35:52] based on origin
[35:54] and so so this is why and i know people
[35:57] people don't like that though the world
[35:58] don't like it when you start talking
[36:00] about elected sons and i just say listen
[36:02] it's not the man that comes
[36:04] predestinated it's the gene of god in
[36:05] him
[36:07] see
[36:08] let's say what does that even mean well
[36:10] it just means that according to uh
[36:12] isaiah 42 there's only one elected son
[36:15] and that's christ said well how did you
[36:17] get elected i was in him
[36:20] i was in him
[36:22] i'm an expression that was in him and
[36:23] now i'm an expression and therefore i'm
[36:25] elected i come from god i'm going back
[36:27] to god that's why i believe that because
[36:30] i i can't not believe it because what's
[36:32] inside of me is what's inside of here
[36:35] so it doesn't even matter whether i
[36:37] understand it all my faith is
[36:39] supernatural it goes beyond my
[36:41] understanding
[36:43] hallelujah
[36:45] see
[36:46] so it's all about repentance you know
[36:48] when when you come into the world in
[36:50] that way all right now
[36:53] so so then when we come here
[36:56] to jonah
[36:58] said all that to come back around make a
[37:00] full circle
[37:02] so jonah prays unto the lord you're
[37:04] going to find out see that jonah's
[37:06] prayer
[37:08] it's it's a
[37:10] it's such an example it's such an
[37:11] affirmation of god's faithfulness
[37:15] in times of trouble
[37:17] no matter what your trouble is
[37:20] god is faithful
[37:23] do you know that the bible just goes
[37:25] ahead it's not trying to hurt your
[37:27] feelings but it just goes ahead and
[37:29] calls it like it is that even when
[37:31] you're not faithful
[37:33] he can't deny his own word and he must
[37:35] remain faithful
[37:38] thank god thank god see
[37:42] so jonah realized here in the belly of
[37:44] the whale that really nothing could
[37:46] separate one of god's own from him and
[37:50] i'm going to tell you friends there's a
[37:51] strength in that alone that will see you
[37:54] through the darkest time and the darkest
[37:55] trial and the darkest challenge and and
[37:58] and god brings us through these things
[38:00] and the enemy is allowed to get by with
[38:02] it and it's all working in the hands of
[38:04] god but just remember this that nothing
[38:07] as paul said nothing can separate me
[38:09] from the love of god which is in christ
[38:11] jesus
[38:12] and i and i i love i've said it for
[38:14] years yes it doesn't matter if it's a
[38:17] sword or peril or famine or height or
[38:19] death doesn't matter nothing can
[38:21] separate me and therefore then me can't
[38:23] separate me
[38:25] you can't separate you if i could have
[38:28] i'd have been finished a long time ago
[38:30] how long come on people ain't that the
[38:32] truth
[38:33] if it was really up to you you'd have
[38:35] been kicked to the curb a long time ago
[38:36] and i'd have been piled up there ahead
[38:38] of you but god rich in mercy
[38:41] loved me while i was a sinner
[38:44] hallelujah
[38:45] [Applause]
[38:48] so jonah prayed unto the lord his god
[38:51] out of the fish's belly and said i cried
[38:53] by reason of my affliction unto the lord
[38:56] and he heard me
[38:57] out of the belly of hell cried i
[39:00] and thou heard us
[39:02] my voice
[39:04] so when i read this friends i i have to
[39:06] agree that no situation
[39:10] no situation could ever prevent a
[39:14] repenting
[39:15] child of god from being heard
[39:19] when they pray
[39:21] do you just remember that tonight now i
[39:23] want to tell you this i'm at a part now
[39:26] and these next these next lines that
[39:28] i've got here in my notes
[39:29] i don't know why i'm saying it
[39:32] i haven't talked to your pastor about
[39:34] anything other than how good the food
[39:36] was today
[39:38] but the lord brought these necks some
[39:40] these lines upon my heart a couple of
[39:43] weeks ago and said when you get there
[39:45] this is a direction you're going to take
[39:47] you didn't exactly tell me when i found
[39:48] out this afternoon it's right now
[39:51] so i want you to understand this that no
[39:54] situation could ever
[39:56] prevent this is what we're reading in
[39:58] our in our in our text and i cried by
[40:01] reason of mine affliction unto the lord
[40:03] and so right here in the scripture where
[40:05] we're reading we find that no situation
[40:08] could ever prevent a repenting child of
[40:11] god from being heard by god when he
[40:14] prays
[40:16] and i want you to take courage tonight
[40:18] and the lord told me to challenge you to
[40:20] believe that i don't care what's
[40:23] happened i don't care what situation
[40:25] you're in you might have got yourself
[40:27] into it all by yourself but i'm here to
[40:30] tell you god will never not hear a
[40:33] repenting heart from his child
[40:39] i went down the waters come past me
[40:43] even to the soul
[40:45] i went down to the bottoms of the
[40:47] mountains the earth with her bars was
[40:49] about me forever
[40:52] but thou brought up my life from
[40:54] corruption
[40:55] oh lord my god
[40:57] when my
[40:59] when my soul fainted within me this is
[41:02] good advice
[41:04] when my soul fainted within me
[41:07] i remembered
[41:09] the lord
[41:11] and my prayer
[41:13] came in unto the
[41:14] end to thine holy temple
[41:17] i want to tell you something friends
[41:19] i've never been in the belly of a whale
[41:21] but i sure have felt many a time like i
[41:24] put myself in hell on earth and only the
[41:27] only only thing i could do at that
[41:29] moment when i couldn't help myself is i
[41:31] remembered that he loved me
[41:33] i remember that i was chosen before the
[41:35] foundation of the world and all i could
[41:38] do was lean back on that with my faith
[41:40] and raise up my hands and repent and i
[41:42] knew he would hear me from heaven and he
[41:44] did say how do you know he did because
[41:46] i'm standing here tonight as a believer
[41:49] and i'm still pressing and i'm still
[41:51] standing and it doesn't matter what the
[41:53] devil has done or tried to do you're
[41:56] still standing here
[41:59] hallelujah friends you realize what an
[42:02] impossible age that you're living in
[42:05] totally impossible too dark too evil too
[42:08] wicked too perverted there's no way no
[42:10] one no one's getting out of here alive
[42:12] it's too too dark and twisted
[42:15] we're going to have to have a body
[42:17] change
[42:18] oh i'm here to tell you something friend
[42:19] we're going to have to have that same
[42:21] god that matthew and
[42:23] the regeneration by the holy spirit he
[42:25] that same life is going to quicken your
[42:27] mortal body
[42:29] hallelujah
[42:35] when my soul fainted
[42:38] within me i remembered the lord
[42:41] they that observe lying vanities forsake
[42:43] their mercies but i will sacrifice unto
[42:45] thee
[42:46] with the voice of thanksgiving i will
[42:48] pay that that i have vowed
[42:52] and the lord spoken to the fish and it
[42:55] vomited out jonah upon the dry ground
[42:59] i mean now i want you to think about
[43:01] this and just try to
[43:02] put yourself here

[43:23] don't don't let those words become a
[43:25] cliche to you

[43:32] purpose for you can't be frustrated
[43:35] by you but god will use those things to
[43:38] correct and to grow and to nurture and
[43:41] sometimes it's because you've done wrong
[43:43] and sometimes it's because you haven't
[43:44] done anything wrong sometimes you're in
[43:47] a trial because you did everything right

[44:20] village somewhere this is actually a
[44:22] superpower of its time
[44:24] and we but you see
[44:26] having come through the trial let me
[44:28] just give you a piece of courage here
[44:30] having come through the trial
[44:33] jonah 2.0
[44:35] arrived in nineveh as an improved
[44:38] version over jonah 1.0

[44:45] way to your big impossibility he needed

[45:27] but just like jonah don't worry about
[45:31] the circumstances

[46:10] tell you the hell has come to the
[46:12] surface and the lid has been torn off

[46:24] of it

[46:31] repentance

[46:36] i want to say to you whoever you are
[46:38] whoever how many of you there are here

[46:42] it's too late you've you've made up the
[46:44] mistake too many times you can never get
[46:46] back on track that mission was given to
[46:48] somebody else it was knocked it's
[46:50] waiting on jonah it was way it's waiting
[46:53] on you jonah had to go through a
[46:55] circumstance to get the repentance god
[46:57] needed and when he got to the job he was
[47:00] more equipped to do the impossible
[47:03] [Applause]
[47:04] hallelujah
[47:06] if he was finished with you he wouldn't
[47:08] have brought you to the repentance
[47:09] you're coming out now get ready to do
[47:13] what he told you to do
[47:15] hallelujah
[47:17] hallelujah
[47:19] this is why brother branham could say
[47:22] jonah was never out of the will of god
[47:28] amen never
[47:30] say well it looks like he disobeyed god
[47:31] brother branham said out of the will of
[47:32] god impossible the footsteps of the
[47:35] righteous are ordered over the lord
[47:37] brother jason good grief please make
[47:38] sense of that i'll make sense of it in
[47:40] one sentence god sent him through this
[47:42] trial to prepare him for his impossible
[47:45] mission
[47:49] the mission he had was impossible the
[47:52] mission that's ahead of you is
[47:53] impossible
[47:55] no other age has ever been able to pull
[47:56] it off
[47:57] and you're in the worst age by far
[48:00] you're in the age of complete apostasy
[48:02] total darkness gross darkness upon the
[48:05] people you've got the double whammy of
[48:07] the days of lot and the days of sodom
[48:10] converging on you at once no ages ever
[48:13] faced that
[48:14] this is the only age where satan is
[48:16] actually the god of the whole age
[48:18] this is actually satan's eden he's had 6
[48:21] 000 years to get it ready i'm here to
[48:23] tell you something friends god also has
[48:25] a word ready
[48:26] god also when the enemy comes in like a
[48:29] flood god raises up a standard you
[48:31] believe
[48:32] that
[48:34] you see that in in prophecy you don't
[48:36] think that what you see happening abroad
[48:39] and overseas and see you're seeing
[48:41] prophecy come to pass friends
[48:43] the world is being led to the to the
[48:45] third woe
[48:47] it's irreversible it's irrevocable you
[48:49] can i you know when when i read in the
[48:52] book of revelation and the terrible
[48:53] things that are that are going to take
[48:55] place there i i would love to spare
[48:59] the earth that calamity but i can't
[49:03] neither can you
[49:05] and it's not like the world says well if
[49:07] we could just get them the gospel we
[49:08] could we could save the whole world if
[49:10] they just believed the gospel the gospel
[49:11] never came to save the world
[49:14] the same jesus who gave him the gospel
[49:16] and said take it as the same jesus who
[49:18] told tells him in matthew 24 what's
[49:19] going to happen to the world
[49:21] it's going to be destroyed
[49:24] man's 6 000 year run and a fallen
[49:27] condition is
[49:28] ending
[49:30] this 6 000 year run of mankind in a
[49:33] falling condition and nature can't wait
[49:36] she's groaning hallelujah bride of
[49:39] christ is groaning and god is ready and
[49:41] we're ready hallelujah the world is
[49:43] moving in that direction
[49:45] there's no way to stop it no way to turn
[49:47] it around god didn't come to with the
[49:49] gospel to save the world he came to with
[49:51] the gospel to save his family out of the
[49:53] world
[49:54] i'm here to tell you that there are
[49:56] judgments and calamities rushing to meet
[49:59] us and the only way out is up
[50:03] hallelujah how many want to go up
[50:06] [Applause]
[50:10] so this is why paul would say yay dallas
[50:14] i count all things in philippians 3 8 i
[50:16] count all things
[50:17] but lost for the excellency of the
[50:19] knowledge of christ jesus my lord
[50:22] for whom i have suffered the loss of all
[50:24] things and do count them but dung here's
[50:26] why
[50:27] that i may win christ
[50:30] and i you know i
[50:32] that that means a lot to me that that
[50:34] verse
[50:35] in philippians that i may know him the
[50:38] power of his resurrection this is why he
[50:40] was willing and paul didn't talk about
[50:42] losing losing bad things paul said what
[50:45] things were games
[50:48] no i didn't you know it's not like i
[50:49] gave away things that were hurting me i
[50:51] gave away prestige i gave away advantage
[50:54] i gave away position i passed up on on
[50:57] social acceptance i passed up on money i
[51:00] passed up on a comfortable life i passed
[51:02] up on authority in my church i had lots
[51:05] of friends i had a degree i had more
[51:07] letters on my behind my name than most
[51:09] of you have in your name that was paul
[51:11] amen
[51:12] but paul said what things were gain
[51:16] i counted those
[51:18] as loss
[51:19] because by comparison they could not
[51:22] touch
[51:23] the sufferings of christ
[51:27] they could not
[51:28] be found equal
[51:31] to be for what god had coming for his
[51:34] family
[51:37] and so
[51:38] so we find that
[51:40] that this that this you know so too many
[51:43] times that we
[51:44] we we study our bible and we read our
[51:47] bible and we study the message and we
[51:48] read the message and if we're not very
[51:50] careful sometimes friends we just stop
[51:52] at the accumulation of knowledge
[51:55] that's not even why the message came
[51:58] the message came
[51:59] not to just
[52:01] fill you up full of full of knowledge
[52:03] but the message came to to transform you
[52:05] into something
[52:07] see well we're transformed by the things
[52:10] that we gaze at we feed on the word of
[52:12] god and thus we're becoming the word of
[52:15] god
[52:15] and that's what really that's what
[52:17] really the message has come to do it's
[52:19] come to identify and god has a way don't
[52:22] you worry god's in control of everything
[52:25] you see i know the headlines look
[52:27] ominous but don't you worry god is in
[52:29] control of everybody
[52:32] so we find then that this is why
[52:35] paul would say in second corinthians 5
[52:37] 17 therefore if any man be in christ
[52:40] he is a new creature
[52:43] old things are passed away behold all
[52:46] things are become
[52:48] new
[52:48] so now this this is interesting
[52:52] because
[52:53] when when you think about redemption
[52:56] you you want to remember this and i'm
[52:58] gonna i'm gonna enlarge on this tomorrow
[53:01] the lord willing but redemption is the
[53:03] restoration and fulfillment
[53:07] of god's purpose
[53:09] in creation now say well that's that's a
[53:12] fancy way of saying it but it has a lot
[53:14] of meaning
[53:16] because creation happened at the dawn of
[53:18] everything
[53:20] it happened at the beginning so this is
[53:22] going all the way back to genesis now
[53:24] we're going back to see
[53:26] what's what's it all about what i'm here
[53:29] this has happened a message came i'm a
[53:31] believer i'm in a church before me my
[53:34] parents before them my grandparents
[53:35] before them and it goes back back back
[53:37] back back until we go all the way back
[53:39] through 2 000 years of church history
[53:41] then we end up at christ the keystone
[53:43] then we go on back to the prophets and
[53:45] the kings
[53:46] priest and we go on back to the children
[53:48] of israel we go on back through moses
[53:50] and abraham and and
[53:52] and and go all the way back to noah and
[53:54] then keep on going all the way back to
[53:56] abel
[53:58] and then we go all the way back into the
[54:00] garden and then we go before the garden
[54:02] and then we go we go all the way back to
[54:04] the earth was in darkness and void and
[54:06] chaos was on the face of the of the deep
[54:09] god is a master at bringing order to
[54:12] chaos
[54:15] and so you have to you have to remember
[54:17] that everything that that is in
[54:19] redemption
[54:21] is god
[54:23] it's it's it's a restoration and it's a
[54:26] fulfillment of his purpose
[54:29] in creation this is exactly why
[54:32] that in that when we read from genesis
[54:35] that that god uses that exact same
[54:39] wording god uses uh a new creation
[54:43] and so so so we find out then that that
[54:46] we we see this term used again
[54:49] because
[54:50] we when we talk about light shining out
[54:52] of darkness and and god said this at the
[54:55] time of creation let there be light
[54:59] now this is exactly why
[55:02] when brother branham is going to pick an
[55:05] example among several that he chose when
[55:08] he's going to pick an example how that
[55:10] you where the gene of god came to life
[55:12] he's going to go all the way back to
[55:14] when god said let there be light
[55:18] and brother branham says he was not
[55:20] creating the sun
[55:21] the sun that he already created the
[55:23] heavens and the earth
[55:25] in the beginning god created the heavens
[55:27] and the earth the sun was already there
[55:30] the earth was already there the seed was
[55:32] already there but there was a there was
[55:35] a thick blackness a billowing darkness
[55:38] uh the earth was in chaos and waters
[55:41] covered the face of the deep and there
[55:43] was no way for the sunlight to strike
[55:46] the sea
[55:47] because it was buried under all of that
[55:49] dark chaos and so the voice of command
[55:52] brother branham said the voice of
[55:53] command said let there be light god
[55:55] wasn't creating the sun
[55:57] he was speaking to the darkness divide
[56:00] separate drive back light must strike
[56:03] the seed i put the seed there to come
[56:05] forward and light strength the seed and
[56:07] life come forth and that's you you were
[56:09] born in sin you had a gene of god down
[56:12] inside of you it was covered over in
[56:14] darkness but an eagle screamed
[56:17] hallelujah
[56:18] you heard a word and what what was god
[56:20] doing god wasn't creating a son of god
[56:23] you already were a son of god he was
[56:26] speaking to the darkness
[56:28] and his word of command annihilated the
[56:31] darkness and light struck the seed and
[56:34] life came forward
[56:35] [Applause]
[56:39] so what so now it should make perfect
[56:41] sense to you that if he uses the exact
[56:44] same wording and the exact same plan the
[56:48] exact same methodology and then paul
[56:51] brings it over here and starts using the
[56:53] identical same words
[56:56] you see so what is your redemption it's
[56:59] god continuing his work of redemption
[57:03] god bringing forth his family so listen
[57:06] friends it doesn't matter
[57:09] what victories the enemy might have had
[57:11] in you they can't last
[57:14] say i made mistakes that can't stop you
[57:18] why
[57:19] because that has a shelf life
[57:22] that has an expiration date
[57:24] you weren't a sinner in the beginning
[57:27] you became a you were born in sin but
[57:29] that wasn't your original beginning i'm
[57:31] here to tell you that sin has a shelf
[57:33] life it's not eternal it didn't begin in
[57:36] god it's not going to keep continuing
[57:38] but your eternal life will always be
[57:43] hallelujah
[57:45] god said let there be light and there
[57:47] was light
[57:50] and god saw the light that it was
[57:52] good see
[57:56] so we find it and i i can see stuff i
[57:58] need to skip here and we'll try to pick
[58:00] it up pick it up in the morning
[58:05] so we come to job i promise you would
[58:07] come to job i want to come to him just
[58:09] before i push paul's button tonight
[58:11] we'll un-pause in the morning
[58:16] when brother branham
[58:18] is preaching this funeral
[58:20] of garnet peak and
[58:22] brother branham starts talking about how
[58:24] that he says you know
[58:26] just as the sun
[58:28] sets over the western horizon now here
[58:31] he is in campbellsville kentucky and
[58:33] he's talking to all these people he's
[58:35] trying to get them to understand
[58:37] why this young man laying in a casket is
[58:39] not a sad story
[58:42] and he said i know it breaks our hearts
[58:43] we're going to miss him he said but but
[58:45] you have to understand that just as the
[58:48] western just as the western sun fell
[58:50] over the western horizon he said
[58:54] it'll come back again
[58:55] in the eastern sky
[58:57] and it doesn't matter how many times it
[58:59] goes over the western horizon it'll come
[59:01] back
[59:02] again it'll come back again friends i'm
[59:06] here to tell you something there's going
[59:07] to be a lot of nonsense of my life that
[59:11] that goes over the western horizon but
[59:13] when it comes back up in the east i'll
[59:15] be clean and i'll be pure and i'll be
[59:17] righteous and i'll be holy
[59:20] is there anything we can desire more
[59:22] than that
[59:24] to know him in the power of his
[59:26] resurrection
[59:28] when it comes back up hallelujah friends
[59:30] that's what happened to me that's what
[59:32] happens to you
[59:33] all my sins went over the western
[59:35] horizon and on the next day when the sun
[59:38] rose i was new
[59:40] i was a new creation i was a brand new
[59:44] person
[59:49] the flowers live and they die and they
[59:52] live again
[59:53] the grass lives it dies it lives again
[59:57] and this is where job came to because
[1:00:00] that you know as i said to you earlier
[1:00:04] job
[1:00:05] my
[1:00:06] how are you going to make sense of it
[1:00:08] here's a man and and
[1:00:10] and job himself struggled with this
[1:00:13] why it's like i'm being punished and
[1:00:15] i've and joe just tried to figure he
[1:00:17] said you know if i had
[1:00:18] if i had cheated a man from his wages
[1:00:22] if i had taken a maiden by force if i
[1:00:24] had if i had lied and cheated and
[1:00:27] betrayed my family if i had did all of
[1:00:29] these things but i'm innocent of these
[1:00:31] things i i've done everything right i've
[1:00:34] i've given my sacrifices i've served god
[1:00:37] i taught my children the ways of right
[1:00:39] and all of these things are coming upon
[1:00:41] me and as a human being
[1:00:44] you know
[1:00:45] don't feel bad if sometimes
[1:00:48] your negative mind gets the better of
[1:00:50] you and you forget the promises of god
[1:00:52] because that's what job did
[1:00:56] and as righteous of a man perfect in all
[1:00:58] of his ways
[1:00:59] he was really missing the whole
[1:01:02] purpose in what was happening
[1:01:04] and it really took a profit i'm so glad
[1:01:06] for a prophet in this day because when i
[1:01:08] a lot of times when you read it you can
[1:01:10] get little snippets of of encouragement
[1:01:13] but brother branham when brother branham
[1:01:14] takes up job's life
[1:01:16] and he says see
[1:01:18] if job could have only realized as a
[1:01:20] paraphrase don't have it in front of me
[1:01:22] he said if job could have only realized
[1:01:24] that everything he went through
[1:01:28] all those heartaches and all those
[1:01:30] trials
[1:01:31] was just for one reason
[1:01:34] so because
[1:01:36] god
[1:01:38] desired to put a little bit more of his
[1:01:41] expression a little more knowledge of
[1:01:43] himself into the earth
[1:01:45] and and god wanted to and say what
[1:01:48] knowledge did god want to put into the
[1:01:49] earth he wanted to put he wanted to
[1:01:51] introduce the thought of a redeemer
[1:01:54] he wanted to introduce the thought of
[1:01:56] you didn't begin here you're not ending
[1:01:58] here just carry on i've got a plan
[1:02:01] that this is a this is an eternal plan i
[1:02:03] didn't figure this out yesterday your
[1:02:05] your mistakes don't make send me back to
[1:02:07] the drawing board i knew you before you
[1:02:09] were born i knew you when you were born
[1:02:11] i followed you around your whole life
[1:02:13] and i wouldn't leave you alone until i
[1:02:15] got you to surrender and that's god
[1:02:18] see that's what god does
[1:02:20] chases you around
[1:02:23] and and so so so we find out that
[1:02:27] that that you know he said that god
[1:02:29] wanted to put this knowledge of a
[1:02:30] redeemer in the earth but but you
[1:02:32] remember when when in the gospels jesus
[1:02:36] looks out a window
[1:02:38] and says
[1:02:40] the field is truly white unto harvest
[1:02:44] pray ye the lord of the harvest that he
[1:02:46] send laborers into his field and brother
[1:02:49] brown says it's interesting
[1:02:51] because he himself was the lord of the
[1:02:54] harvest
[1:02:55] and brother branham said in other words
[1:02:57] what he's doing is he's saying to the
[1:02:58] disciples i want to do this but i need
[1:03:02] you to ask me to do it
[1:03:04] because you're in this with me
[1:03:07] we're entangled together
[1:03:09] we're entangled and we're not separate
[1:03:11] we're the we're the you're just a
[1:03:12] continuation of me
[1:03:14] and so i want that that i mean that that
[1:03:17] that's what the seventh seal unveiled
[1:03:19] when it unveiled the mighty god it
[1:03:21] unveiled his body it unveiled christ we
[1:03:24] were talking about that today at the
[1:03:25] table the brothers and i that because
[1:03:26] that's why brother branham could stand
[1:03:28] between trinitarians here and oneness
[1:03:30] here and to say brothers frankly you're
[1:03:32] both wrong
[1:03:34] he's not one or two or three like you're
[1:03:36] thinking
[1:03:37] because because remember that the
[1:03:39] trinitarians in their formula they
[1:03:41] divided god into three persons
[1:03:44] but the oneness were wrong because in
[1:03:46] their formula it didn't include his body
[1:03:48] it was jesus only
[1:03:50] but the opening of the seals revealed it
[1:03:53] made the mighty god unveiled and when
[1:03:56] the mighty god was unveiled the plan of
[1:03:58] redemption was unveiled and when the
[1:03:59] plan of redemption was unveiled there
[1:04:01] was a people being redeemed
[1:04:03] who were part of the same creation
[1:04:06] who were with god and were part of god
[1:04:09] hallelujah and it revealed the bride of
[1:04:12] christ and chris then christ becomes the
[1:04:14] mystery of god revealed unfolded
[1:04:17] unwounded un unwound and the bride
[1:04:20] becomes the mystery of christ revealed
[1:04:23] it's it's the word made flesh again
[1:04:26] moving in the earth because god is after
[1:04:28] a kingdom
[1:04:32] and so he's saying god here
[1:04:35] he desired to put the truth of
[1:04:38] redemption
[1:04:39] in the earth and so he needed to find
[1:04:42] somebody
[1:04:43] who could ask him a question
[1:04:46] if a man die
[1:04:48] shall he live again
[1:04:52] oh my
[1:04:54] and god had to find somebody
[1:04:57] who yeah he got weak in his faith and
[1:04:59] yeah he felt sorry for himself and yeah
[1:05:01] he blamed everybody but the president
[1:05:03] and and finally the the fourth man the
[1:05:05] holy spirit coming and tried to slap him
[1:05:08] slap some sense into him come on joe
[1:05:10] hold on i'm going to talk to you i want
[1:05:12] you to get ready for this and this this
[1:05:14] was the revelation that god brought job
[1:05:17] job
[1:05:18] you know where were you
[1:05:20] when morning stars sing together and
[1:05:22] sons of god shouted for joy
[1:05:25] think job now god's not being sarcastic
[1:05:27] he's not trying to make him feel bad
[1:05:29] he's trying to get him to understand job
[1:05:31] where you think you were
[1:05:33] when morning starts singing together
[1:05:35] sons of god shouted for joy you really
[1:05:38] think this life is just about this life
[1:05:40] job do you are you really that
[1:05:41] small-minded to not realize that you are
[1:05:44] with god you're here serving my purpose
[1:05:47] you're going to come back to god
[1:05:51] and when he and when job asks the
[1:05:53] question the trees die and they live the
[1:05:55] flowers die and the grass dies and it
[1:05:57] lives but what if a man if he dies shall
[1:05:59] he live and that's when brother man said
[1:06:01] oh god that was it that's all he needed
[1:06:03] that he stepped out on a thunderhead and
[1:06:05] come roaring down get on your feet job
[1:06:07] i'm going to show you something when
[1:06:09] morning stars sang together you were
[1:06:11] there when sons of god shouted for joy
[1:06:14] you were there you didn't start here job
[1:06:16] you're not finishing here job this
[1:06:18] thing's bigger than you job
[1:06:21] it's bigger than your fails it's bigger
[1:06:23] than your trouble it's bigger than the
[1:06:25] devil and nothing can stop it
[1:06:30] and it's god rich in mercy and job said
[1:06:34] i get it i get it i get it and though
[1:06:35] the skin worms destroy this body i have
[1:06:38] a revelation that in my flesh
[1:06:41] i shall see god
[1:06:45] with my own eyes i shall see him
[1:06:47] [Applause]
[1:06:54] this is god
[1:06:55] saying to job
[1:06:56] you'll be all right job
[1:06:59] you'll be all right
[1:07:01] nothing here lasts this life is only
[1:07:04] temporal it's only here to serve my
[1:07:06] eternal purpose in redemption you'll

[1:07:12] and everything that ever loved you it'll

[1:16:32] age hand i just want to know him more
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:36] just
[1:16:38] [Music]
[1:16:42] jesus jesus jesus
[1:16:45] saints i can just hardly speak that the
[1:16:46] lord would bring us a special word two
[1:16:49] weeks ago
[1:16:52] last night today this is a special word
[1:16:57] just us
[1:16:59] and i'll tell you i receive it i say
[1:17:01] thank you lord for speaking to me so
[1:17:03] personally
[1:17:04] this is minister to me so much tonight
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:11] all the in between really doesn't matter
[1:17:13] when you're looking at eternal life
[1:17:16] you know the baptists talk about eternal
[1:17:18] life someone needs to receive eternal
[1:17:20] life
[1:17:23] different denominations and our former
[1:17:25] understanding is you need to receive
[1:17:28] eternal life and it's like it's
[1:17:29] something coming someday you receive it
[1:17:31] you get to live forever someday
[1:17:33] friends god is speaking to sons and
[1:17:35] daughters like he ever never has
[1:17:38] eternal life is not
[1:17:40] just in the future
[1:17:42] eternal life is in us right now
[1:17:46] it has no beginning it has no end
[1:17:49] and all he wants to get sons to do is in
[1:17:51] their trials and in their and if they
[1:17:53] backslide and wherever they're at
[1:17:56] i thought it was amazing tonight that he
[1:17:58] allows our trials
[1:18:00] like he did job
[1:18:02] so that we would ask the right questions
[1:18:06] if you didn't have the trial you
[1:18:07] wouldn't be asking the right questions
[1:18:09] and god saying i let you go through this
[1:18:11] because now you're asking some deep
[1:18:13] questions
[1:18:15] now you're asking things you should
[1:18:16] really be asking
[1:18:18] and god says i'm here to answer all of
[1:18:20] them i'm going to give you a revelation
[1:18:22] right now
[1:18:24] eternal life is not something to come
[1:18:26] someday
[1:18:27] their life is now it's his life in us
[1:18:30] and when it's a
[1:18:31] it's an eternal life perspective it's
[1:18:33] more than a perspective it's a
[1:18:35] revelation we start catching it and we
[1:18:38] i don't want to repeat what's been said
[1:18:40] just so perfectly tonight
[1:18:43] but
[1:18:43] once we catch these things the stuff
[1:18:46] that's in between
[1:18:49] god's bigger than all the stuff in
[1:18:50] between
[1:18:53] we heard last night
[1:18:55] he's god says i am that was
[1:18:58] i i am i i was help me out brother diggs
[1:19:01] i was
[1:19:02] he is he was he is and i i am that shall

[1:19:17] [Applause]
[1:19:29] [Music]
[1:19:35] to us tonight
[1:19:38] [Music]
[1:19:40] somebody told me something one time said
[1:19:43] there's encouragement from her brother
[1:19:46] i said maybe 10 years ago it helped me
[1:19:48] out so much
[1:19:51] i just said don't sweat the small stuff
[1:19:54] anybody ever heard that before
[1:19:56] don't sweat the small stuff
[1:19:59] god's doing something
[1:20:01] god's working help me out a lot
[1:20:03] i forget it sometimes
[1:20:05] but we need to have our minds on
[1:20:07] something much greater than all this
[1:20:08] stuff in between it doesn't mean that we
[1:20:10] don't get emotional we're affected and
[1:20:12] you know job he's crying and he's you
[1:20:15] know he's feeling the effects of losing
[1:20:16] his kids we're emotional human beings
[1:20:18] god made us that way
[1:20:20] but the difference in us is that god
[1:20:22] says you'll not stay there you're not
[1:20:24] going to stay in depression you're not
[1:20:26] going to stay down
[1:20:27] and even if your backside you won't stay
[1:20:30] there as soon as there's repentance
[1:20:33] [Music]
[1:20:36] i just mentioned something to my church
[1:20:38] can i say this it's only eight o'clock i
[1:20:40] just mentioned something sunday last
[1:20:42] sunday brother jason i said
[1:20:44] that little parable that jesus gives and
[1:20:46] the pharisees the pharisees in the
[1:20:48] temple
[1:20:50] and he's saying lord he's he's praying
[1:20:52] and there's the sinners over in the
[1:20:54] corner
[1:20:55] and they're both seeking justification
[1:20:57] and all human beings are seeking
[1:20:59] justification of god it's the ultimate
[1:21:01] so the subject is justification
[1:21:04] but you see
[1:21:05] man you can't get that with god
[1:21:07] on your own
[1:21:10] and this pharisee said lord i thank you
[1:21:12] that i'm not like the sinner over here
[1:21:15] and that i've given my tithes and he
[1:21:17] starts listing all of his credibility
[1:21:20] and all that he's done
[1:21:22] and he's seeking to be justified by god
[1:21:25] but by what he's brought
[1:21:27] and i've lived in this and i've been i
[1:21:29] grew up in the message and he's bringing
[1:21:31] all this stuff and
[1:21:33] then the bible says the sinner over in
[1:21:34] the corner
[1:21:35] [Music]
[1:21:37] he's smiting his his breast
[1:21:41] he said lord i only want one thing
[1:21:44] i want to repent right now and i only
[1:21:46] want one thing i just need your mercy
[1:21:49] he didn't bring any of his credibility
[1:21:51] he didn't bring any of his background he
[1:21:53] did anything that he did
[1:21:55] nothing it's there's nothing
[1:21:59] he said god i just want your mercy
[1:22:00] couldn't even lift his head but jesus
[1:22:02] couldn't even lift his head
[1:22:05] you think this is a little parable i'll
[1:22:06] tell you it's speaking of now don't you
[1:22:09] dare bring your own things to god
[1:22:13] we need to know him more we need his
[1:22:15] mercy
[1:22:16] he needs to hear the cry of our heart
[1:22:18] and we need true repentance can you say
[1:22:20] amen
[1:22:21] god will allow trial in your life so the
[1:22:23] son of god will come to true repentance
[1:22:25] true repentance not not i'm sorry how
[1:22:27] many knows that i'm sorry is not
[1:22:29] repenting
[1:22:32] repentance is returning saying god i
[1:22:34] gotta return i gotta go back
[1:22:37] and so he smites his breast and he said
[1:22:38] lord have mercy you know what the last
[1:22:40] scripture says he said i tell you
[1:22:43] that that man
[1:22:44] went back to his house justified before
[1:22:47] god
[1:22:50] wait a minute he didn't present anything
[1:22:52] he didn't say anything he didn't talk
[1:22:53] about he just asked for god's mercy he
[1:22:55] just repented he just asked for god's
[1:22:57] mercy
[1:22:58] and he got justified
[1:23:00] went back to his house i'll tell you the
[1:23:03] word that we've heard last night and
[1:23:04] tonight
[1:23:06] i pray some people walk home
[1:23:09] repented
[1:23:11] and you go back to your house truly
[1:23:13] justified
[1:23:14] in the eyes of god
[1:23:18] truly justified
[1:23:20] and i'm going to live in justification
[1:23:22] i'm going to live in eternal life
