[22:51] announcements before we uh get into the
[22:53] word tonight um the concert will be this
[22:56] Friday uh Joseph habedank and uh he's a
[22:59] wonderful singer also has a wonderful
[23:00] testimony about his the addiction that
[23:03] he had and come through it the Lord
[23:04] really helped him out of it uh I know

[23:23] a blessing to you I think even the young
[23:25] people would enjoy that however you want
[23:27] to do but we to announce it and the
[23:29] other thing I just want to say is
[23:31] marvelous is the works of the Lord don't
[23:33] ever think that God is not moving he is
[23:36] moving in Mighty ways and the devil
[23:38] would like us to think that he's not
[23:40] doing anything but there's I've had I've
[23:42] had so much response this week not about
[23:45] me but what the Lord is doing and he's
[23:47] doing Mighty things and we should just
[23:49] have a testimony service tonight God's
[23:51] moving in impossible situations God's
[23:53] moving in things uh there's been PE
[23:56] visitors that's been here too in the
[23:57] last couple Services theyve called and
[24:00] said we haven't felt the presence of the
[24:02] Lord like that in so many years and they
[24:05] just said God is present among you
[24:07] whatever you're doing keep doing what
[24:09] you're doing well I'm not doing anything
[24:10] I'm just letting him do what he needs to
[24:12] do but listen God is working and it's
[24:15] like the song says step into the water
[24:17] while the spirit's moving Step In The
[24:18] Water you don't want to miss out on what
[24:20] the Lord's doing and praying to him
[24:22] speaking to him and saying Lord let me
[24:25] be a part of the bride's Revival
[24:27] individually my myself let me be a part
[24:28] of it praise the Lord Genesis 15 uh if
[24:31] you allow me to continue on from Sunday
[24:33] a little bit we'll pick up Genesis 15
[24:36] and the only scripture I'll read as we I
[24:39] read the whole the whole first part of
[24:41] the chapter uh but we just need to read
[24:43] this tonight and when the after Abraham
[24:46] uh got the sacrifice ready I tell you
[24:48] what let's just read 7 through 11 let's
[24:50] do that make sure we have it in our
[24:52] minds and he said unto him I am the Lord
[24:55] that brought the out of er of the chaes
[24:57] to give thee this land to inherit it and
[24:59] he said Lord God whereby shall I know
[25:01] that I shall inherit it and he said unto
[25:03] him take me a heer of three years old
[25:06] and a she goat of three years old and a
[25:09] ram of three years old and a turtle dove
[25:12] and young pigeon and he took unto them
[25:14] all these and divided them in the midst
[25:16] and laid each piece one against another
[25:18] but the birds divided he not and when
[25:21] the fowls came down upon the sacrifice
[25:24] or the carcasses Abram drove them away
[25:28] amen father I just pray you'll bless
[25:30] your word tonight as we study your word
[25:33] train us teach us Lord fill us give us
[25:35] what we need for the journey we pray in
[25:37] Jesus name we ask it amen amen you may
[25:41] be seated God bless you tonight we'll be
[25:42] ministering this Sunday at brother Barry
[25:44] coffees brother Brandon will be speaking
[25:46] here at home so I know there sever a few
[25:49] on vacation and such but we'll have a
[25:51] service here and and I know the Lord
[25:53] will be speaking uh around the world to
[25:56] his people he's always faith faithful to
[25:58] his people so just pray for us while
[26:00] we're away just on Sunday there and
[26:02] preaching a couple services for brother
[26:03] Barry coffee in Hickory North
[26:05] Carolina I am so happy the Lord led me
[26:08] into this scripture Genesis 15 just a
[26:10] few months ago and then uh really is
[26:12] becoming more and more real to me um
[26:14] it's just a special thing that's just
[26:16] seems to be exploding for me as I
[26:18] studied again today and yesterday and
[26:21] just want to go into it just a little
[26:23] bit more while we have you here tonight
[26:25] and those that are listening online and
[26:28] uh we want to just go back into it and
[26:29] speak a little bit about this tonight
[26:31] this keeping the fowls away from our
[26:33] worship and our title this keeping the
[26:35] fouls off of our worship is what I'd
[26:37] like to title it and uh that's what we
[26:40] have to do and so it's God God is course
[26:42] coming to Abraham in this incident in
[26:45] Genesis 15 to reconfirm his promise that
[26:47] he gave him he's coming to confirm to
[26:50] him the the Covenant that he gave him
[26:52] the promise he gave him so it's
[26:54] reconfirming or confirming the Covenant
[26:56] that he has with Abraham and as you
[26:59] study it you realize this is not a
[27:01] covenant that is making a deal with
[27:03] Abraham that Abraham if you'll do this
[27:05] I'll do this this is an unconditional
[27:08] Covenant and you see God taking care of
[27:11] and doing it all and it's an
[27:14] unconditional it does it's not based
[27:16] upon the actions or performance of
[27:18] Abraham it's a different Covenant at the
[27:20] beginning God made a the adamic Covenant
[27:23] was he said you do this and and and this
[27:25] and this and so then man failed in that
[27:28] and we always fail when we're making
[27:29] deals with God man is always the one
[27:32] that fails you don't want to make a deal
[27:34] you don't want to want to be careful of
[27:35] promises that you make can you say amen
[27:38] I think promises are good but we want to
[27:40] make sure with God that in our human
[27:42] weakness sometimes we make a promise but
[27:45] the thing is I'm glad to be under an
[27:47] unconditional Covenant tonight with my
[27:49] God a covenant that says I have done it
[27:52] I have paved the way I have made the way
[27:54] for you and if you'll yield yourself to
[27:56] me I i' I've got this journey from your
[27:59] beginning all the way till the end I
[28:01] will finish it for you and so God is
[28:03] coming to Abraham to confirm this
[28:06] Covenant but he does it in a very
[28:07] strange way uh but as he does it it
[28:10] reveals so much about where we are at in
[28:14] the people of God right now because
[28:16] we're at the very end of the royal Seed
[28:18] of Abraham finishing up this journey
[28:21] Abraham began the journey and his Royal
[28:23] seed will finish the journey and if
[28:25] we're not the at the end I'm just crazy
[28:28] I don't understand we are at the end we
[28:30] are at the final generation uh and the
[28:32] final expression of the royal Seed of
[28:35] Abraham and I believe I'm preaching to
[28:37] some of those here tonight that's a
[28:39] pretty important time to be in and so
[28:41] when we go into the idea of Abram uh
[28:43] shwing these fowls away on Sunday we
[28:46] just begin to break into this idea of
[28:48] the sacrifice being there and Abram
[28:50] chewing off the fowls and keeping the
[28:53] foul birds away from the sacrifice God
[28:56] laid out a perfect sacrifice before him
[28:59] and uh and and he gave Abraham the
[29:03] specifics of a a perfect sacrifice that
[29:05] God would accept and and to and to lay
[29:09] Abraham to lay his life in worship
[29:10] before that it was a perfect sacrifice
[29:14] and it's in the end time that God
[29:16] actually reconfirms his promise to his
[29:19] elect again it's at the end time when
[29:21] God sends a prophet and he's
[29:24] reconfirming to his elect what he gave
[29:27] Abra abam at the beginning he's
[29:28] reconfirming it and speaking it again to
[29:31] the people and he's not only speaking it
[29:33] but he's showing himself present by
[29:35] signs and wonders and the sign of the
[29:37] son of man and the son of man manifested
[29:39] again by the discernment of Hearts he
[29:41] did it all to show the sons of Abraham
[29:44] I'm reconfirming that what I said to
[29:46] Abraham is now coming to pass God always
[29:49] does that with us God always doesn't
[29:50] leave us hanging every once in a while
[29:52] he visits in a special way to let you
[29:54] know I still love you my Covenant is
[29:57] still still there it's still hanging
[29:58] over your life I'm still going to
[30:00] fulfill it can you sayen you may not
[30:02] hear that every day if you stay in the
[30:04] word you'll hear it every day but you
[30:06] may not hear it every day but every once
[30:07] in a while aren't you glad could you
[30:09] raise your hand and every once in a
[30:10] while no matter how low you can feel and
[30:13] how how much the devil's beating you up
[30:15] God in his loving hand comes and
[30:17] reconfirms his love for you his Covenant
[30:19] for you I'm right I know where you're at
[30:21] right now I know what's going on and I'm
[30:24] going to finish my working you and
[30:26] that's what he did in the the last as a
[30:28] matter of fact uh Abraham got a
[30:31] visitation from
[30:32] MDC and uh then we find that was Jesus
[30:36] Christ being manifested there couldn't
[30:39] have been anybody else but Jesus Christ
[30:40] no beginning of days no ending of life
[30:43] he comes again several thousand years
[30:45] later in Jesus Christ in the flesh of
[30:47] Jesus but God gave us another visitation
[30:50] of MDC in the end time because it's the
[30:53] final stage of the royal Seed of Abraham
[30:57] and he got to visit with MDC and we get
[31:00] to visit him too you say well where is
[31:02] he at well open your ears he's been
[31:05] speaking to us amen yes sir amen he came
[31:09] and manifested in flesh he's still
[31:11] manifesting in the flesh of the Bride
[31:12] but it's a very unique thing I got a a
[31:14] new song on my uh project uh coming up
[31:18] coming out this Friday the brothers have
[31:20] been so good at getting it done for me
[31:22] and I got 12 songs there and one of them
[31:25] is here I am plugging my project on
[31:26] Wednesday night before every just no
[31:29] shame whatsoever but they're going to
[31:31] release uh 12 new songs here this Friday
[31:34] and uh one of them is who is this mzc
[31:37] because that mystery is so real to the
[31:38] bride that you realize who is this
[31:41] that's sitting Among Us who's speaking
[31:42] to us it's not just a man it's he
[31:46] himself and when you realize that and
[31:49] that's why when Abraham when he realized
[31:50] who he was sitting in front front of
[31:52] this mzc the king of Salem King
[31:55] theophany brother bradam when he
[31:57] realized that he praised and he
[31:59] worshiped God and he gave a tenth of all
[32:02] you didn't have to beg him for his
[32:03] tithes when he realized it was Christ
[32:06] there when it was he realized it was God
[32:08] sitting in front of him eating with him
[32:10] you didn't have to beg for his tithe or
[32:11] giving it just said I want to give
[32:15] because it's not a man I'm giv to it's
[32:17] Christ it's his kingdom and so these uh
[32:22] visitations and these covenants and
[32:24] these reconfirming covenants happened to
[32:26] AB Abraham and they happened to the Seed
[32:29] of Abraham at the end and one of the
[32:31] things that He blesses us with is a
[32:33] revelation of our perfect sacrifice and
[32:35] the atonement that he's given us um
[32:38] Abraham in his reconfirmation here God
[32:41] has him lay out these three animals and
[32:43] these the turtle dove and the pigeon and
[32:45] it all represents Christ it all
[32:47] represents something and I'm going to
[32:49] read it to you in a minute what it means
[32:50] it all means Christ but he lays out the
[32:52] perfect sacrifice he splits the three
[32:54] animals and he lays them a certain way
[32:56] and Abraham is standing in front of a
[32:58] perfect sacrifice now it's not a perfect
[33:01] atonement for his sins but before
[33:03] Calvary came it's the sacrifice that's
[33:05] God's going to accept now if you mess
[33:07] with that sacrifice you're tampering
[33:09] with God's perfect atonement and
[33:11] sacrifice but if you leave it alone that
[33:13] is going to be your answer you worship
[33:15] under that blood can you say amen and if
[33:18] you'll stay there and worship under that
[33:19] blood God's going to finish the the
[33:21] promise and so so we today we had a
[33:25] perfect sacrifice at Calvary but God
[33:27] comes and by Revelation shows us and
[33:30] reconfirms to us through the prophetic
[33:33] Ministry at the end what kind of perfect
[33:36] sacrifice we have we sang about it in
[33:39] the uh uh communion again and we we we
[33:42] Fellowship together Sunday night it was
[33:44] such a a special time together of
[33:46] testimonies and such a a a vulnerable
[33:49] the testimonies were just moved me to to
[33:52] hear people so honest and open and
[33:54] broken about where God had brought them
[33:57] from and what they were and what they
[33:59] are and it was just such a special time
[34:02] and we see then that as people of God
[34:04] come to the real uh reality of what the
[34:08] atonement has done for us and how
[34:10] perfect our sacrifice and how the the
[34:13] the worshipper doesn't have to be
[34:15] perfect but the sacrifice has to be
[34:17] perfect when we start learning that then
[34:19] we realize we release ourself in a rest
[34:22] and a worship to God like we've never
[34:25] had before and because because the
[34:28] atonement and sacrifice was messed up
[34:31] for 2,000 years by men's interpretations
[34:33] of Creeds and dogmas God had to come in
[34:36] the end time and speak through a prophet
[34:39] to reconfirm and tell us just how
[34:41] perfect our atonement really is that we
[34:43] can celebrate and worship under this
[34:46] atonement this perfect sacrifices
[34:48] sacrifice matter of fact uh one of the
[34:50] reasons the foolish virgin will have to
[34:53] go through tribulation is because she
[34:56] rejects the atonement in its
[34:58] fullness that's a
[35:01] heavy one of the reasons the foolish
[35:04] virgin will miss the Rapture and go
[35:06] through tribulation is because and I'm
[35:07] quoting from Brother random we they
[35:10] reject the atonement they don't reject
[35:13] Christ going to Calvary but they reject
[35:15] the atonement in its fullness that's
[35:17] right so the atonement has to mean
[35:19] something more than us just
[35:21] intellectually saying I believe Christ
[35:24] died for me at Calvary we have to tap in
[35:26] into the power of the
[35:29] atonement the Christ of the atonement
[35:32] what it did for us can you say amen and
[35:34] a lot of that was lost well how was it
[35:36] lost how was it lost by men teaching
[35:39] Creeds from the from the Catholic Church
[35:42] all the way through churches teaching
[35:44] Works instead of
[35:46] Grace messing with our atonement fouls
[35:50] coming down on a perfect sacrifice at
[35:53] Calvary and now you burn a candle now
[35:55] you confess to the the priest and from
[35:57] that all the way through to Pentecost
[36:00] until you have the last age true age
[36:03] true Pentecostal move but then
[36:05] Pentecostal Traditions turned it
[36:07] into Catholic says I'll go burn a candle
[36:11] I'll feel good about myself I burn a
[36:12] candle I feel righteous Pentecostal say
[36:15] if I just go down there and shout and
[36:17] dance a little bit with no life shout
[36:18] and dance they'll feel good about
[36:20] themselves it's the same
[36:22] works and I say that respectfully
[36:25] because I believe in those things as
[36:27] blessings of God I believe with all my
[36:28] heart people think I don't I believe in
[36:30] it because I do it myself but when you
[36:33] start putting that with your rest and
[36:36] peace that somehow you're accepted in
[36:38] the Beloved and you're accepted by God
[36:41] now you're talking works just like the
[36:42] Catholic church I spoke in tongues
[36:44] tonight so I must be righteous before
[36:46] God that doesn't mean you're righteous
[36:48] before God so all the way through the
[36:51] church has messed with the pure
[36:53] atonement the pure perfect sacrifice but
[36:56] but God speaks it purely again through
[36:58] his Prophet so that we can come to the
[37:00] right kind of worship the right kind of
[37:03] Freedom can you say Amen the right kind
[37:05] of Life In Christ that is dependent not
[37:07] on our works but upon the power of the
[37:10] atonement that's been what he's done for
[37:12] us at
[37:13] Calvary amen so a revelation of the
[37:16] perfect sacrifice and atonement has come
[37:18] back to us and they reject the atonement
[37:20] in its fullness so that means that means
[37:23] that I believe if they're rejecting
[37:25] something and that's how they missed the
[37:27] Rapture they believe there was an
[37:29] atonement but they reject the atonement
[37:31] in its fullness if you reject the Holy
[37:34] Ghost the true Holy Ghost you're
[37:35] rejecting the power of Calvary and the
[37:37] atonement in your
[37:39] life how many can say Amen you can't say
[37:43] well I believe Christ died for my sins
[37:44] and that's it and not take his Spirit
[37:46] into your life no that's the power
[37:49] that's the power of the atonement
[37:51] something poured out of Calvary his
[37:54] Spirit he took his body up up to heaven
[37:56] heaven but he he poured his Spirit out
[37:58] upon the people so there's a power in
[38:01] the atonement and the people of God come
[38:03] back to it in the end time and uh we see
[38:06] that to me it means that the atonement
[38:09] has been expressed to us in its fullness
[38:12] and has been been revealed to us and has
[38:14] been laid out to us as it was Abraham
[38:19] but all the fowls of Satan are still
[38:23] trying to confuse
[38:27] taint
[38:30] devour right during our time Satan's
[38:33] fowls are trying to mess with our
[38:36] atonement and when he does it contain
[38:40] our
[38:43] worship that our worship is not pure
[38:45] because he's tainted our sacrifice he's
[38:47] added to it he's taken away from it and
[38:50] that's a pretty uh when we add to
[38:53] something or we take away let's just
[38:56] talk about our sacrifice let's talk
[38:57] about what God did for us when we add to
[39:00] it or we take away from it that's a
[39:02] serious thing it's perfect when in
[39:05] itself is it not it's perfect when in
[39:09] itself and so the last scripture in the
[39:12] Bible says whoever takes one word of
[39:16] this out or adds one to that's the last
[39:18] warning you know what he's saying the
[39:20] last warning the last warning of the
[39:22] Bible must be pretty serious whoever
[39:25] takes out of this or puts in will have
[39:26] his name taken off the book of life
[39:28] that's pretty serious in other words
[39:30] he's saying don't touch
[39:33] this for 2,000 years denominations says
[39:37] has added to and taken away and he's
[39:38] saying to the bride don't touch
[39:41] it leave it
[39:42] alone believe it but don't touch it
[39:45] don't add to it don't add your Works to
[39:47] it don't take away from it don't loosen
[39:49] it up don't loosen up the gospel don't
[39:51] add to the gospel leave it alone and let
[39:54] it do its powerful work in your life
[39:56] keep it simple keep it
[39:59] uncomplicated oh how we need to hear
[40:01] that maybe even in our message ranks can
[40:03] you say Amen 2,000 years of church
[40:05] history that has messed with this and
[40:07] taken away from this Bible added to from
[40:10] this Bible and he's Sayang at the last
[40:12] few scriptures even all of us that are
[40:14] in the end time message leave it
[40:17] alone can I get an amen tonight leave it
[40:21] alone let God take it and put it in our
[40:23] lives the way he wants to don't try to
[40:26] interpret anything and I'm quoting there
[40:28] he says at the end of The Seven Seals he
[40:30] says now this is this is God's done
[40:33] something here but don't try to put any
[40:35] interpretation to what he's done just go
[40:38] and live a good Christian
[40:39] Life at the end of The Seven Seals did
[40:42] you know he said that same thing one of
[40:44] my daughters was saying last Saturday he
[40:47] said just take your Bible go go to
[40:51] church live a good solid Christian Life
[40:54] stay in the spirit of God and if God
[40:57] wants you to know anything he'll bring
[40:59] it to you and don't try to interpret
[41:02] what's taking
[41:04] place I wish a lot more
[41:07] preachers I'll go ahead and preach about
[41:10] preachers instead of you that's strange
[41:12] isn't it I wish a lot more preachers
[41:15] would have listen and would still listen
[41:16] to what he said pray preach the message
[41:21] don't add to it don't take away don't
[41:24] add to this Bible don't take away from
[41:25] it preach it in the power of the
[41:27] resurrection and let it do what it's
[41:30] going to do the third pole the seven
[41:32] seal all the let God interpret these
[41:34] things by bringing them to pass and I
[41:36] guarantee you he's doing it uh you
[41:39] better have your eyes open because he's
[41:40] doing he might do it under our noses
[41:43] right can you say Amen so leave leave it
[41:46] leave it alone so I understand so look
[41:47] at this that I'm so dis excited to
[41:50] discover this quote uh if you guys have
[41:53] it back there this quote came up uh
[41:55] today and and uh I didn't in all my
[41:57] studies last week I didn't know how he
[41:59] connected this uh Genesis 15 but we'll
[42:02] let the prophet connect it here and then
[42:03] we're going to get to some practical
[42:05] stuff at the end here do you have any
[42:06] quotes did anybody send you anything
[42:08] okay perfect and Abraham went and got
[42:10] the animals and he cut them in half and
[42:12] laid them so we're in 1962 here I
[42:15] believe it is 62 yes 1962 and uh Abraham
[42:21] went and got the animals and he cut them
[42:22] in half and laid them piece to piece but
[42:24] the turtle dove and and Dove did not
[42:26] separate the TR do and pigeon throtle
[42:29] Dove and pigeon is the same family so
[42:31] that represented Divine Healing which in
[42:33] both covenants is by faith you see that
[42:36] they're healed just one to the other
[42:39] other one if the old Covenant had Divine
[42:41] Healing in it how much more has the is
[42:43] this one got so he's saying the three
[42:45] animals that were used had to be cut
[42:47] because we realize that even at Calvary
[42:50] Christ was divided God took his body but
[42:52] he left his Spirit on the people so that
[42:54] when he brings it back together together
[42:56] it'll be one we'll be one with him so
[42:59] just like these three animals of the uh
[43:01] of the first three animals were divided
[43:03] and placed again beside one another on
[43:06] this sacrifice it all typed Christ all
[43:08] TY but he didn't divide the turtle doen
[43:11] pigeon because that's not something with
[43:13] the Old Testament the Old Testament was
[43:15] law but under grace he Calvary it's
[43:18] going to be a new covenant with the
[43:19] people so now turtle dove and pigeon is
[43:21] the same family so that represents
[43:23] Divine Healing which in both covenants
[43:25] is by faith see that they were healed
[43:27] how many knows that people were healed
[43:29] in the Old
[43:30] Testament so that that wasn't divided
[43:33] that same faith that would cause
[43:35] somebody to be healed by God in the Old
[43:36] Testament is in the New Testament as
[43:38] well God never got rid of that but but I
[43:41] like brother bram's point if the old
[43:42] Covenant had Divine Healing in it how
[43:45] much more has this Covenant got Divine
[43:48] Healing if God could heal non of his
[43:50] leprosy if God could heal in the Old
[43:52] Testament with a covenant that wasn't
[43:54] even a Calvary Covenant yet if God could
[43:57] heal diseases back then then he can heal
[44:00] diseases now how much more under this
[44:04] Covenant can God heal our bodies if he
[44:07] did that in the Old Testament the pigeon
[44:09] and the turtle do represent that praise
[44:11] the Lord I thought that was wonderful
[44:13] see if the old sacrifice had healing
[44:14] what about this one which is much better
[44:17] now but notice what he done here he took
[44:19] these three animals cut them apart laid
[44:21] them piece by piece and they did Abraham
[44:23] got back now that was the sacrifice and
[44:25] he watched until the sun was going down
[44:28] and fouls came down out of the air on
[44:31] Abraham's sacrifice
[44:33] vultures and Abraham cast them out shed
[44:37] them
[44:39] away what's this a type of Abraham's
[44:43] seed in the last
[44:45] day casting out Devils from the
[44:49] sacrifice now friends I didn't know that
[44:52] he had said that till today and that's
[44:54] what I preach Sunday it's a good
[44:56] confirmation I'm in the channel of the
[44:57] holy spirit cuz God led me and I felt I
[45:00] was on track but to hear it say just
[45:02] exactly how was brought out on Sunday
[45:05] that it's it's the it's the seed the
[45:08] Royal seed of the last casting out
[45:10] Devils from the sacrifice casting away
[45:13] from the sacrifice now think about that
[45:16] fouls trying to come on our perfect
[45:19] sacrifice and tainted that's right
[45:21] Demons of Doubt Demons of
[45:24] fear Demons of
[45:28] worldliness Demons of religion Demons of
[45:31] legalism
[45:33] legalistic all of it tries to come on
[45:35] and Tain this sacrifice but we have to
[45:38] stand and be sure of where we stand to
[45:41] sh the fouls off of this and say no no
[45:43] devil I don't want no unbelieving devil
[45:45] to come around I don't want any doubt in
[45:47] my mind my calling is to worship this
[45:49] perfect sacrifice and I'm going to
[45:51] Worship the Lord and what he did for me
[45:53] at Calvary is powerful enough to take me
[45:56] to the end it's powerful enough to heal
[45:58] my cancer it's powerful enough to give
[46:00] me the Holy Ghost it's powerful enough
[46:03] to send a Revival in my heart it's
[46:05] powerful enough and I don't want the
[46:06] devil to mess with it or give me doubts
[46:09] I'm just simply uncomplicated I'm
[46:11] believing it with all my
[46:13] heart somebody say Glory GL praise the
[46:16] Lord so now casting away from the
[46:19] sacrifice God promised it to sacrifice
[46:20] Christ the same yesterday today forever
[46:23] and all them unbelieving Spirits trying
[46:26] to devour it the man of God the Abraham
[46:29] seed stands there casting out the Devils
[46:33] away from it confirming the Covenant now
[46:36] the confirmation showing that Abraham's
[46:39] seed in I mean the loyal the Royal seed
[46:43] remember the natural seed failed because
[46:45] it accepted law instead of the word of
[46:47] Grace talking about the Jews they
[46:49] rejected Christ as a whole and they took
[46:51] their law instead so what did they do in
[46:53] that the natural Seed of Abraham failed
[46:56] and then he said so now so it is a
[46:58] roundabout in the Gentiles in the last
[47:01] day but there is a seed because you
[47:03] realize there's a church not the true
[47:05] church but a false church that once
[47:07] again turned down and failed and took
[47:11] Works instead of Grace 2,000 years of
[47:15] church history from the mother Church
[47:17] all the way through teaching the people
[47:20] and getting them to accept oh they
[47:21] accept Christ but they have a bunch of
[47:23] Works attached to it in order for you to
[47:25] gain entrance into
[47:27] heaven so the the the spiritual Seed of
[47:31] Abraham also had a failure in the sense
[47:34] they took law instead of Grace they took
[47:36] Church Creed instead of Grace instead of
[47:38] the real baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[47:40] so then we find then he says but there's
[47:42] a seed a royal seed with the word stands
[47:45] true casting out Devils doing great
[47:48] signs and wonders getting all the
[47:51] unbelief away from the word this is
[47:54] powerful friends I'm one of
[47:57] them these signs shall follow them that
[47:59] believe casting out devils and by the
[48:01] way casting out Devils isn't always just
[48:04] in a service it's not always that and
[48:06] it's not just Devils of uh insane or
[48:09] Devils of nicotine or Devils sometimes
[48:12] it's Devils of gossip and sometimes it's
[48:14] Devils of sometimes bitterness and
[48:16] sometimes it's Devils of other things
[48:17] that we wouldn't think but whatever the
[48:20] fouls are coming around we're to cast
[48:22] them
[48:23] out Hallelujah
[48:26] signs and wonders getting all the
[48:28] unbelief away from the word can you
[48:29] imagine it's look at that getting all
[48:31] the unbelief that's our duty as
[48:33] Believers get the unbelief away from
[48:36] this word right I keep doing that
[48:39] because that's my
[48:42] visual I don't have any better visual
[48:44] tonight brother Stephen it's like just
[48:47] get the fowls get the unbelieving things
[48:50] away from this word leave this word
[48:53] alone I love the core of this message
[48:55] message in this word bringing us back to
[48:57] Bible faith I love it I love the word
[48:59] you say brother Paul how do you know you
[49:00] have the Holy Ghost what's the evidence
[49:01] the best evidence I know is I love the
[49:04] word and particularly the word for this
[49:06] age I have no resistance in my soul to
[49:09] not one word of this age and that's the
[49:11] greatest evidence I love it I that the
[49:14] amener says Amen to it I can't deny that
[49:17] sometimes my mind or my flesh
[49:20] resist yeah that's right I hear
[49:23] something he says something your flesh
[49:26] uh and that's because my flesh isn't
[49:27] born
[49:28] again right but it's coming under
[49:32] subjection but when I got the Holy
[49:34] Spirit 16 years old the amen is down
[49:36] here and I love this word I I literally
[49:40] love the word the present truth that he
[49:43] sent there is no resistance deep down
[49:46] inside there's nothing it's and I don't
[49:49] say that to boast I'm just I believe
[49:51] that's the evidence that you have
[49:53] something receiving the word of God for
[49:55] your a AG is the evidence of the Holy
[49:57] Ghost so keeping Theo he said keeping
[50:00] the uh doing keeping the unbelief away
[50:04] from the word keeping the sacrifice
[50:05] clean keeping the word holy keep it
[50:08] reverenced not put anything with it add
[50:12] anything to it just keeping it away
[50:16] standing on guard letting nothing touch
[50:19] it that is the Royal Seed of Abraham how
[50:22] going to raise your hand and say that's
[50:24] where I stand
[50:26] and that's what I'm having to do almost
[50:27] on a daily basis I might hear a lot on
[50:29] the internet I might have a lot of
[50:31] different ideas but God help me to be
[50:33] that Royal seed that's brushing those
[50:36] fowls away and keeping the word clean
[50:38] can you say Amen keeping it reverenced
[50:41] keeping our respect towards one another
[50:43] reverent keeping the love in the
[50:45] congregation the true love can you say
[50:47] amen and those demons come around and
[50:49] divide us and make us no no no let's
[50:51] let's say no let's not go that direction
[50:53] let's keep this thing holy let's keep it
[50:56] right can you say Amen let's keep this
[50:58] message
[51:00] pure and anything not putting anything
[51:02] with it adding anything to it it's just
[51:04] keeping it away standing on guard
[51:06] letting nothing touch it I can't say it
[51:09] any better than that right there it's
[51:10] powerful friends and he said that's the
[51:13] Royal Seed of Abraham do what she's
[51:15] doing at the end
[51:18] time blessed be the name of the Lord
[51:21] that is the Royal Seed of Abraham no
[51:24] wonder this Genesis 15 means so much to
[51:27] us as we see Abraham's actions of
[51:31] keeping the fowls off of the perfect
[51:34] sacrifice you know it's when we have the
[51:36] right thing before us and worshiping
[51:40] under the right thing is when we have
[51:42] the greatest forces trying to mix it
[51:45] trying to taint it trying to distract us
[51:47] away from it let me say it again it's
[51:50] when you have the right thing the right
[51:53] sacrifice the right word is when the
[51:55] devil's trying to fight so hard against
[51:57] it okay he's trying to taint it he when
[52:00] we have the right worship with the right
[52:02] sacrifice and it's and it's the the the
[52:05] sacrifice and the power of it the word
[52:07] is changing us and when it changes us
[52:10] then we get stimulation a revelation and
[52:12] we raise our hands in worship and we
[52:14] we're in freedom of worship I'm
[52:15] worshiping under the right thing the
[52:17] blood of Jesus Christ purely not
[52:18] anything added to it or taken it away no
[52:21] wonder Satan hates that and tries to
[52:23] taint worship and taint the
[52:25] sacrifice to mix it to taint it to take
[52:29] pieces of the word and splice it
[52:32] together or not read the rest of it or
[52:35] not get a balance of it or only use the
[52:38] parts that maybe endorse our background
[52:41] I say that respectfully but sometimes we
[52:43] only read the quotes that endorse our
[52:45] background whatever religion we come
[52:48] from whatever denomination we tend to
[52:50] lean towards those particular quotes and
[52:52] leave the other ones out I don't think
[52:53] we should do that I think we should take
[52:55] all of the word of God and not just use
[52:57] parts to endorse what we come from in
[52:59] our background that's a serious thing
[53:02] places the pro places the prophet says
[53:05] things we can take to two extremes and
[53:08] that is either formalism or fanaticism
[53:11] I'm only saying this because the prophet
[53:12] said it himself he said you can take it
[53:14] to two extremes he said you can take it
[53:17] to formalism and and intellectualism or
[53:20] the other extreme is fanaticism we can
[53:22] sway swing way too to intellectual or
[53:25] way to the emotional side but we want to
[53:27] be in the middle of the road we don't
[53:29] want to taint it we don't want to add
[53:31] anything from the past to it can you say
[53:34] Amen we should pray and keep it balanced
[53:36] and Cast Away influences to bind up our
[53:40] worship and to scare us and to pervert a
[53:44] pure atonement that he gave us to
[53:46] worship under that's right praise the
[53:50] Lord I like when people worship free and
[53:53] I don't mean that they can just be free
[53:56] as far as physically worshiping they're
[53:58] free down here they're free in their
[54:01] Spirit they're emotions have been
[54:04] delivered from the bondage of Satan
[54:06] that's why they can shout they can cry
[54:08] they can raise their hand there's
[54:09] nothing binding them because
[54:10] everything's Unbound in here can
[54:13] somebody give me an amen tonight it's
[54:15] not just you physically do it but
[54:17] something has set you free in your
[54:18] spirit something has set you free in
[54:21] your soul I know what a soul freedom
[54:24] feels like I'm not bound by religion I'm
[54:27] not bound by dos and don'ts but there's
[54:30] a rest there's a Sabbath in my soul I
[54:34] know where I stand with God and when I
[54:36] come before him if I have a mistake I
[54:38] bring it quickly under the the blood of
[54:40] Jesus Christ and go right back to
[54:43] raising my hands and worshiping God
[54:46] hallelujah blessed be his name now I I
[54:49] want to switch this around a little bit
[54:51] tonight there's so much more you could
[54:52] go into and just from that quote there's
[54:55] so much you can go into but I'm switch
[54:57] this to a little bit practical side
[54:58] because it's a Wednesday night and we're
[55:00] just going to switch this a little bit
[55:02] same subject but I came across a sermon
[55:04] by Spurgeon and I referred to it uh
[55:07] Spurgeon the Charles Spurgeon the prince
[55:09] of preachers and he he uh he takes this
[55:14] scripture Genesis 15 and verse 11 and he
[55:18] takes it uh uh quite uh in a more
[55:21] practical way and I just can't get by
[55:23] without bringing out some of his points
[55:25] from it to help us a little bit and the
[55:27] way he takes it is that he looks at the
[55:29] interruptions from our thought life that
[55:32] interrupt our
[55:34] worship how many knows that can take
[55:37] place it's kind of a good place to start
[55:39] let's start with our
[55:41] thoughts the part that nobody can
[55:46] see the part that you can hide from
[55:48] everybody you may have traveled tonight
[55:51] and taken several trips in the last 30
[55:54] minutes while I've been preaching your
[55:56] mind could have exited here and went to
[56:00] many other things even while you're
[56:02] physically sitting in front of me saying
[56:04] amen every now and
[56:06] then because that's the power of your
[56:10] thoughts and I think it's important
[56:12] maybe to talk about this first because
[56:14] you can talk about all the other worship
[56:15] and all the other things but he says
[56:17] when we come to worship and he's
[56:19] particularly going to hone in on Sundays
[56:21] because 150 years ago that was the thing
[56:23] that's what you did on Sunday should
[56:25] come to worship so he really goes into
[56:28] the distractions in our mind to the
[56:30] fouls that come around to interrupt our
[56:33] worship even when we come in church and
[56:35] come to service he he really elaborates
[56:37] on the fouls that come in our minds and
[56:39] the thoughts and uh I'll tell you
[56:41] sometimes I hear Spurgeon say things 150
[56:43] years ago and I'm saying wow the devil's
[56:45] still the same today we're still
[56:46] fighting the same devil he was dead on
[56:49] on some things and he's a real Pastor
[56:52] you can tell he's a real Pastor too cuz
[56:54] he's seen so much The Human Side of the
[56:56] people and yet pointing them to Christ
[56:58] all the time and and so now he takes
[57:00] interruptions in our thoughts into our
[57:02] worship especially when we're sitting in
[57:05] church and also not giving one day a
[57:07] week Sunday to undistracted worship that
[57:10] was a big deal it's a big deal to me
[57:12] today it's been a big deal for my wife
[57:15] and I in our home to it's our my Sabbath
[57:18] is not Sunday but there's something
[57:20] about setting aside the first day of
[57:21] week for worship exclusively for fellow
[57:25] ship exclusively and not business or not
[57:28] something
[57:30] else all right so he speaking on not
[57:35] giving one day a week
[57:37] Sunday uh giving it un giving it to
[57:40] undistracted worship and so I want to
[57:43] touch on what he
[57:44] says Spurgeon says and I just I'm going
[57:47] to bring out a few points of what he
[57:48] said about the different thoughts we can
[57:50] have and then we'll bring it to a close
[57:52] tonight we might use this text he said
[57:55] uh Genesis 15:11 everybody still with me
[57:58] he said we might use this text if we
[58:00] chose as a picture of the ease which
[58:02] with faith repels all attacks that are
[58:06] made upon Christ the fouls brushing them
[58:08] away from the sacrifice the great
[58:10] sacrifice of the New Covenant answorth
[58:13] tells us that the original word which we
[58:14] translate drove he drove them away has
[58:17] in it the force of puffed them away as
[58:20] if a a very puff of breath these Kites
[58:23] and vultures and Eagles were he uses
[58:25] Eagles were at Once Driven away from the
[58:27] bodies of the victims Faith knows how
[58:30] when skeptical kites when Blasphemous
[58:32] vultures when speculative speculative
[58:35] birds come down to attack the sacrifice
[58:38] of Christ knows how to chase them away
[58:40] but with a puff of her breath we know
[58:43] whom we have believed the Bible says let
[58:45] the Earth let the Earth shake our
[58:48] confidence in him cannot move he is to
[58:50] us as real as a person as always nay we
[58:54] might doubt our own existence but Jesus
[58:56] his power his love his Precious Blood
[58:59] his prevalent atonement we dare not
[59:02] doubt
[59:03] that one puff of the breath of prayer
[59:07] and questions and cavals are gone one
[59:10] puff of the breath of Holy Faith In
[59:12] Praise And every skeptical attack is
[59:15] scattered to the winds as far as we are
[59:19] concerned when these fouls come down
[59:21] upon the body of Christ like Abram by
[59:24] faith we puffed them away he drove them
[59:26] away but I do not intend to use this
[59:29] text with such an object this morning
[59:31] this one of his morning sermons 150
[59:33] years ago I do not intend to use this
[59:35] text with such an object this morning
[59:37] though one might legitimately do so it
[59:39] seems to me to represent to us our duty
[59:42] when distracting thoughts invade the
[59:45] sanctity of our holy worship here's
[59:48] Abraham he has killed the victims
[59:50] according to the divine order he has
[59:52] laid them in their places according to
[59:54] the heavenly rule he is waiting until
[59:56] God shall over these victims make and
[59:58] ratify the Covenant but meanwhile the
[1:00:01] buzzards the kites the vultures sent the
[1:00:05] B sense the body from afar and hastened
[1:00:08] to Devour the Flesh of the bolock and
[1:00:10] the ram Abram chases them away that is
[1:00:13] so his sacrifice may not be spoiled and
[1:00:17] he may have real fellowship with
[1:00:22] God brothers and sisters we never
[1:00:25] attempt to worship god without finding
[1:00:27] some difficulties in the
[1:00:30] way now you some of you have been
[1:00:32] serving the lord many years how many you
[1:00:33] raise your hand I can agree with Charles
[1:00:34] Spurgeon tonight we never attempt to
[1:00:37] worship God remember worship is not just
[1:00:39] a church lifting our hands worship is
[1:00:41] our life towards him every day and so so
[1:00:44] now we never attempt to worship god
[1:00:45] without finding some difficulties in the
[1:00:48] way and he quotes a poem that says what
[1:00:50] various hindrances we meet in coming to
[1:00:53] The Mercy Seat
[1:00:56] what various hindrances we meet in
[1:00:58] coming to The Mercy Seat now you can be
[1:01:00] coming to any other thing but when you
[1:01:03] begin to come to the real mercy seat
[1:01:05] with the power of atonement coming back
[1:01:07] on your life hindrances get in the way
[1:01:10] thoughts get in the way Satan gets in
[1:01:13] the way seen young people just so close
[1:01:17] to coming to a Brokenness to to cross
[1:01:19] the sound Berry and come into Christ and
[1:01:22] they get bombarded with all kinds of
[1:01:25] things yeah some boy or girl comes along
[1:01:28] or some thing of the world that they're
[1:01:30] feeding on comes along some new thing
[1:01:33] and they were just on the verge of
[1:01:35] crossing the sound barrier and Satan
[1:01:37] interrupts at all of it because why they
[1:01:39] were setting their eyes and their heart
[1:01:42] towards The Mercy
[1:01:43] Seat what various hindrances we meet in
[1:01:45] coming to The Mercy Seat we and our
[1:01:48] assemblies are like angels in
[1:01:51] theirs when the sons of God came
[1:01:53] together Satan came also with with them
[1:01:54] how many knows that in the days of job
[1:01:56] when the sons of God presented
[1:01:57] themselves Satan was there
[1:02:00] too so sons of God when they come to
[1:02:02] present themselves Before the Throne of
[1:02:04] God Satan comes that's a scriptural uh
[1:02:06] scriptural truth we find that where what
[1:02:09] wherever we may be and in whatever frame
[1:02:12] of heart and with whatever earnestness
[1:02:14] we may attempt to worship God there is a
[1:02:18] servant with us who must be told to stop
[1:02:21] at the foot of the mountain while we go
[1:02:23] and worship God Yonder on the
[1:02:25] Mountaintop or else our offerings will
[1:02:27] not be profitable to ourselves nor
[1:02:30] acceptable to God now how important is
[1:02:33] our worship before the Lord and how
[1:02:36] important is our sacrifice that he's
[1:02:38] revealed to us in this hour how
[1:02:41] important are those two things it's
[1:02:45] everything our worship is our life
[1:02:47] before this sacrifice God gave us and
[1:02:50] this word that power that comes from the
[1:02:51] word the two most important things in
[1:02:54] your life young person parents the most
[1:02:57] important things you set before your
[1:02:59] children is what Christ has done for us
[1:03:02] can you say amen and our lives are a
[1:03:04] worship unto him because of it our lives
[1:03:07] are a worship the priority it's above
[1:03:11] any other
[1:03:13] thing
[1:03:14] but you're going to have a
[1:03:17] battle because you start to set your
[1:03:20] heart towards the mercy seat and your
[1:03:21] children's Hearts you're going to have
[1:03:23] the devil will bringing some
[1:03:25] fowls that you have to sh away but
[1:03:28] Spurgeon says it's our thoughts Spurgeon
[1:03:31] says if you guys pull up that and here's
[1:03:34] the thing he getes from Charles Spurgeon
[1:03:36] I'm going to read some of what he said
[1:03:37] and I'm going to encourage you to go
[1:03:39] read it because I can't read all the
[1:03:40] paragraphs under it it's a full sermon
[1:03:42] it's tremendous stuff but here's what he
[1:03:44] says the types of thoughts that invade
[1:03:46] our worship Wicked thoughts worldly
[1:03:48] thoughts anxious thoughts annoying
[1:03:52] thoughts ecclesiastical
[1:03:57] thoughts I don't know uh you can't sit
[1:04:01] here and say oh he's from 150 years ago
[1:04:04] how many can raise your hand and say
[1:04:06] yeah he's got some truth here to what
[1:04:07] he's saying of what interrupts our
[1:04:10] worship Wicked thoughts worldly thoughts
[1:04:12] anxious thoughts annoying thoughts
[1:04:14] ecclesiastical thoughts and so the first
[1:04:17] are wicked thoughts the Sons of Satan
[1:04:19] the wicked thoughts are the Sons of
[1:04:20] Satan these respect no sacred places the
[1:04:23] sanctity of our closet has been violated
[1:04:25] with thoughts of
[1:04:27] lust the Dignity of The Mercy Seat has n
[1:04:30] sufficed to rep repress the vile
[1:04:33] insinuations of blasphemy wickedness
[1:04:35] though it dwelleth no more in the heart
[1:04:37] of the believer yet seeketh to find a
[1:04:39] lodging there did you notice how sound
[1:04:42] that Doctrine
[1:04:44] is wickedness though it dwelleth no more
[1:04:47] in the heart that's what I just preached
[1:04:49] you the desire for sin is burned out by
[1:04:51] the power of Calvary and the Holy Ghost
[1:04:53] so there's no more desire for sin on the
[1:04:56] sole level wickedness though it dwelleth
[1:04:58] no more in the heart of the believer yet
[1:05:00] seeketh to find lodging there and well
[1:05:03] do it affect its purpose at times for it
[1:05:06] terth like a wafering man for a night
[1:05:09] lingering there sufficiently long to Mar
[1:05:12] our devotion and to prevent our having
[1:05:16] joy in fellowship with God Wicked
[1:05:20] lustful
[1:05:23] thoughts
[1:05:25] today someone saidh in the world was did
[1:05:28] you have to meet with the men and just
[1:05:30] talk about the word on sexual temptation
[1:05:33] is there something wrong in the church
[1:05:35] you have to do that and I just kind of
[1:05:37] chuckled I said yeah my church is the
[1:05:39] only church that has issues with that in
[1:05:42] the entire message yeah
[1:05:45] right it's so funny
[1:05:48] sometimes no I'm on a I'm on a campaign
[1:05:52] with the word of God a
[1:05:55] Counterattack with the Holy Ghost to
[1:05:58] help our men become men and overcome The
[1:06:01] Temptations of this age and that's just
[1:06:04] simply it but Wicked thoughts can invade
[1:06:06] us the most vile thoughts can invade a
[1:06:08] Godly
[1:06:10] Man especially when he's trying to
[1:06:12] worship he's trying to do something
[1:06:13] right he's trying to get into the word
[1:06:14] of God and wicked lustful demonic
[1:06:17] thoughts even to a woman can come to her
[1:06:20] and it's like how can they have the
[1:06:21] ocity to invade sets a sacred places I'm
[1:06:24] trying to come into they don't care
[1:06:26] they're going to invade it Charles
[1:06:28] Spurgeon is dead on Wicked lustful
[1:06:30] thoughts can invade your mind to stop
[1:06:32] your stop your pure Worship in the Lord
[1:06:35] can can you say Amen then he says
[1:06:37] worldly thoughts in company with these
[1:06:39] foul
[1:06:41] vultures these things called worldly
[1:06:43] thoughts which spring from the force of
[1:06:45] habit the wheels have been running the
[1:06:46] last six days in this direction and
[1:06:48] history gets into the seventh day the
[1:06:50] first day excuse me the last six days
[1:06:52] the wheels have been running the last
[1:06:54] six days in this direction it is not
[1:06:56] quite so easy to reverse the action and
[1:06:58] to make them go the other
[1:07:00] way we have been sinking sinking sinking
[1:07:03] in the myy clay of Daily Business it is
[1:07:07] not very easy for the soul that lies
[1:07:09] cleaving to the dust to rise at once
[1:07:12] towards heaven on
[1:07:15] Sunday it is no wonder when you have so
[1:07:18] many things to think of in this age of
[1:07:20] competition 150 years ago the age of
[1:07:25] competition it is no wonder when you
[1:07:27] have so many things to think of in this
[1:07:29] age of competition that The Ledger
[1:07:31] should lie there in front of the Pew
[1:07:34] instead of the Bible and that at times
[1:07:36] the daybook should come in when your
[1:07:39] hand holds the himym book or that you
[1:07:41] should be thinking of a bad debt or of a
[1:07:43] long account which is rather precarious
[1:07:46] instead of meditating upon the
[1:07:48] faithfulness of God of the pardons
[1:07:51] bought with the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:07:54] you're thinking about business
[1:07:57] life you're letting those thoughts
[1:07:59] invade the worship that is around the
[1:08:02] greatest thing in the world and that's
[1:08:03] the atonement for your life you gave
[1:08:06] yourself permission to by be diverted by
[1:08:09] what he calls worldly thoughts and I
[1:08:10] agree with them business thoughts life
[1:08:13] thoughts the
[1:08:14] cares praise the
[1:08:16] Lord these tra tra tra these traffickers
[1:08:21] molest the very Temple and we have not
[1:08:23] always the scorge of small cords to
[1:08:25] drive them out or the commanding
[1:08:27] presence of the Savior to say take these
[1:08:30] things hence it is written my house
[1:08:32] shall be called a House of Prayer but ye
[1:08:34] have made it a den of Thieves oh that we
[1:08:37] would be that way like Jesus putting
[1:08:40] those cords together and driving the
[1:08:41] money changers out of the temp temple
[1:08:43] and saying wait a minute get out of here
[1:08:45] this is a house of prayer this isn't a
[1:08:48] house of
[1:08:50] business praise the Lord oh it's
[1:08:53] convicting to me for sure and it's not
[1:08:55] just for Sundays we can't let business
[1:08:58] dominate our minds and thoughts all the
[1:09:01] time
[1:09:03] true but especially Sundays and how many
[1:09:05] other how many a mother comes here here
[1:09:07] with all her tribe of children on her
[1:09:12] shoulders it's 150 years ago how many a
[1:09:16] father comes here with thoughts of where
[1:09:17] he shall Apprentice his eldest
[1:09:20] son 150 years ago how many fathers come
[1:09:23] into the assembly into church 150 years
[1:09:26] ago and their thoughts are turned
[1:09:28] towards how I'm going to mentor and how
[1:09:30] I'm going to take this appren and make
[1:09:32] his life
[1:09:39] better or what shall become of his
[1:09:42] younger
[1:09:45] daughter I've had those
[1:09:51] thoughts that's all while you're in
[1:09:52] church
[1:09:54] yeah Eternal things temporal
[1:09:57] things and if you were listening to the
[1:09:59] word he might give you some answers how
[1:10:01] to Mentor that son he might give you
[1:10:04] some Word answers but when you're
[1:10:06] dominated to figure it all out in your
[1:10:07] mind yourself you're being distractor
[1:10:10] from
[1:10:14] worship besides Wicked and worldly
[1:10:17] thoughts and I'm I'm encouraging you I'm
[1:10:19] not hiding this go read the whole sermon
[1:10:21] because he's not done there he brings it
[1:10:23] out
[1:10:24] and I'm going wow this is amazing for
[1:10:27] him to say it this direct it's so true
[1:10:30] about us letting our thoughts life
[1:10:32] invade our worship not only at church
[1:10:36] but other times but he's talking about
[1:10:38] at church besides Wicked and morly
[1:10:39] thoughts another set of ravens would be
[1:10:41] croaking over us I mean anxious
[1:10:44] thoughts which are the fruits of our
[1:10:46] unbelief oh saith One how can I help it
[1:10:49] how can I help it how can I help these
[1:10:51] anxious worrisome thoughts if you knew
[1:10:53] my condition in business you would not
[1:10:55] Marvel that I that care or worry would
[1:10:58] come in today loss after loss
[1:11:01] continually going backward though with
[1:11:03] energy and perseverance I seek to make
[1:11:06] progress you don't know how I feel I've
[1:11:09] got justification for these worrisome
[1:11:12] thoughts if you knew the condition of my
[1:11:15] business right
[1:11:17] now everybody don't forget that this
[1:11:19] isn't Paul Le fonting saying this this
[1:11:22] is CH spur
[1:11:25] if you knew the condition in my business
[1:11:27] you would not Marvel that worry would
[1:11:29] come in a today loss after loss
[1:11:31] continually going backward though with
[1:11:33] energy and perseverance I'm doing my
[1:11:34] best I seek to make progress a large
[1:11:37] family a once extensive connection the
[1:11:39] constant fear of
[1:11:41] ruin the constant fear of Ruin it's all
[1:11:44] going to fall
[1:11:45] apart how can I hope to chase away
[1:11:48] anxious thoughts and carking cares of
[1:11:51] the day of rest how can I hope to do
[1:11:53] that how can I chase him away my brother
[1:11:55] I make many excuses for you but while I
[1:11:58] make all excuses let me remind you that
[1:12:02] it is written casting all your cares
[1:12:05] upon Him that means worries for he carth
[1:12:11] for
[1:12:13] you at least today there is no need that
[1:12:16] you should carry that burden he's
[1:12:19] talking about Sunday can there be one
[1:12:21] day a week at least that you you don't
[1:12:23] carry that
[1:12:25] burden can there be one day out of
[1:12:28] seven way out of
[1:12:32] balance if we can't get at least one day
[1:12:34] to
[1:12:35] it sometimes in our prayers and in our
[1:12:38] Sabbath worship we shall be disturbed by
[1:12:40] those carryon crows
[1:12:42] called annoying thoughts The Offspring
[1:12:46] of our vanity I will just mention some
[1:12:48] of them that you will that you will
[1:12:50] think perhaps rather odd but I have no
[1:12:52] doubt you know them we have known
[1:12:55] sometimes a sister come to worship and
[1:12:57] she
[1:12:58] notices why is Mrs so and so is why Mrs
[1:13:02] Sono is dressed differently from what
[1:13:04] she was in last
[1:13:07] Sunday and she had a new Bonnet the
[1:13:10] Sunday
[1:13:14] before Oh silly
[1:13:17] soul to be allured like a butterfly with
[1:13:21] colors and flowers
[1:13:25] you think I'm a hard
[1:13:27] preacher then look at Yonder at the
[1:13:30] brother and you're looking over at a
[1:13:32] brother saying there is so and so
[1:13:34] sitting in the opposite gallery that he
[1:13:37] did not want to see today at any rate
[1:13:41] for he does not like that
[1:13:47] man and he feels that his very presence
[1:13:50] is a detriment and a drawback to the
[1:13:53] Poss possibility of devotion so he sits
[1:13:55] on the other
[1:13:56] side or perhaps my brethren as you came
[1:13:59] in there was some little mistake at the
[1:14:01] door or when our friend got to the Pew
[1:14:04] he found it occupied by somebody else
[1:14:07] that's my
[1:14:10] seat or he is not occupying just the
[1:14:13] door seat where he likes to sit or
[1:14:14] perhaps he's standing in An Inconvenient
[1:14:21] place I wish they would be quiet so I
[1:14:24] could listen I wish they would settle
[1:14:26] down sit down so I could see the
[1:14:29] preacher well maybe you need to stand up
[1:14:32] and see the
[1:14:34] preacher you know we're chuckling at
[1:14:36] this stuff and it's 150 years ago but
[1:14:38] I'm saying he's dead on because our
[1:14:41] thoughts can invade our freedom of
[1:14:47] worship sometimes I say I wish on one
[1:14:50] Sunday God could gather all the thoughts
[1:14:52] that all of you thought and me too and
[1:14:55] the next Sunday that would be the sermon
[1:14:56] we get them all thrown up on the
[1:15:02] screen wow what a revealing
[1:15:06] time and I'm sure we're all self
[1:15:09] rightous saying I can't believe he was
[1:15:11] thinking that in
[1:15:15] here she didn't like my
[1:15:18] dress well I'll tell you I'm right in
[1:15:22] style I set the patterns in this church
[1:15:25] oh
[1:15:26] boy what if we had all of them up and we
[1:15:29] took our little vacations and our little
[1:15:31] visits outside of service I think he has
[1:15:34] a valid point here tonight I'm going to
[1:15:36] get ready to close but I didn't want to
[1:15:38] pass this practical advice to us
[1:15:41] okay apply what Abraham did to the
[1:15:44] sacrifice and apply it to your thoughts
[1:15:47] nothing should be able to invade our
[1:15:50] freedom of worshiping God
[1:15:53] especially when we come here I do my
[1:15:55] part to keep this place Sanctified this
[1:15:57] building set aside no other events going
[1:15:59] on in here keep it quiet you can come
[1:16:01] here anytime and pray throughout the day
[1:16:04] we if the door is not open we'll get it
[1:16:05] open for you this is a place set aside
[1:16:07] for him if we do that then when you come
[1:16:10] how about a prar a preparation in your
[1:16:12] heart to say I'm going to give my full
[1:16:15] mind and attention to what God's going
[1:16:17] to do in this
[1:16:19] place let me finish this he says he says
[1:16:23] uh I will mention the brood of fowls
[1:16:27] which will haunt Mount Zion I mean in
[1:16:29] the last one is ecclesiastical thoughts
[1:16:31] so what do I mean by these why that
[1:16:33] sometimes when our minds should be
[1:16:34] perfectly free from work for worshiping
[1:16:36] God Church business perhaps Church
[1:16:38] differences thrust them themselves upon
[1:16:41] us the Deacon thinks he may worry
[1:16:43] himself a little about something that
[1:16:44] has occurred with the poor the Elder
[1:16:46] thinks it would be a justifiable to be
[1:16:48] thinking over the case of such and such
[1:16:50] uh a refractory individual who case has
[1:16:53] troubled him the member thinks he may be
[1:16:55] fretting about the dullness of the
[1:17:00] ministry the minister thinks he may be
[1:17:02] groaning because some in the galleries
[1:17:04] have not joined the church and and and
[1:17:06] mark all these are good things in their
[1:17:08] places but they have no business at all
[1:17:11] with us when we come to God's house to
[1:17:13] worship him then these birds even though
[1:17:17] they they uh then these birds even
[1:17:20] though they like The Sparrows that build
[1:17:23] under the ease of the altar must be
[1:17:25] driven away for until we can get rid of
[1:17:28] all we shall not find the day of rest
[1:17:32] such as it should be nor will our
[1:17:34] worship be acceptable Before the Throne
[1:17:38] of God nor our own Souls derive The Joy
[1:17:42] they ought to have from the service and
[1:17:45] the presence of the
[1:17:47] Lord this may be simple
[1:17:49] tonight Charles spurgeon's points may be
[1:17:52] simp simple and practical but they are
[1:17:56] right how about we start with our own
[1:17:58] thoughts when we talk about brushing
[1:18:00] away the fouls off the sacrifice how
[1:18:02] about we start with our own thoughts
[1:18:03] getting in the way of our worship in the
[1:18:05] way of our Sundays in the way of our
[1:18:07] victory in the way of our freedom to
[1:18:13] worship I'll close on this scripture
[1:18:16] casting down imagination that's right
[1:18:20] come brother Kenny we're going to sing
[1:18:21] freedom and worship cast ing down
[1:18:24] imagination in every High thing that
[1:18:28] exalteth itself above the knowledge of
[1:18:32] God where's that at brother Paul want
[1:18:34] don't you to go find it tonight it's
[1:18:36] your homework amen casting down
[1:18:40] imagination and every High thing that
[1:18:44] exalteth itself above the knowledge of
[1:18:47] God bringing into
[1:18:50] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[1:18:54] of
[1:18:56] Christ hey we're called to cast out
[1:19:00] Devils we got to keep the table
[1:19:03] clean we got to leave the atonement
[1:19:05] alone can you say Amen we got to leave
[1:19:07] the message alone don't add to it don't
[1:19:10] take away from it because the message
[1:19:12] and the atonement the power of what God
[1:19:14] done is what frees us up can you say
[1:19:16] amen and so we have to cast out thoughts
[1:19:18] how many believe you got to cast out
[1:19:19] thoughts of the
[1:19:20] past that's one of the files that come
[1:19:23] on this sacrifice to remind you what
[1:19:25] You' done but we got to cast that away
[1:19:27] and say Lord I've been forgiven that
[1:19:28] you've forgiven me so when his thoughts
[1:19:30] come back around Satan's defeat it say
[1:19:33] no no no no I'm going to worship God
[1:19:34] freely he has Set Me
[1:19:38] Free freedom to worship freedom to
[1:19:41] praise when we've Cast Away these
[1:19:44] thoughts that are not of him amen can we
[1:19:47] stand and pray before we sing
[1:19:50] this precious Lord
[1:19:53] we are spoken to tonight by the
[1:19:57] word by your prophet of our age by a
[1:20:00] great minister of God Charles Spurgeon
[1:20:04] and Lord if he was able to express it
[1:20:06] that way way back then we know today
[1:20:08] that Satan fights our thoughts and
[1:20:10] fights our worship to taint our worship
[1:20:13] today more than ever we who are
[1:20:17] privileged to have the revelation of the
[1:20:19] atonement restored back to us like never
[1:20:22] before for we are a privileged to enjoy
[1:20:25] the word of God as we do to enjoy Lord
[1:20:28] the coming through the the mouthpiece
[1:20:30] that you have set for this generation
[1:20:33] and be able to look our at our Bibles
[1:20:36] and Bible faith without any veils on it
[1:20:39] without any tainted this on it without
[1:20:41] having to bring it through the filter of
[1:20:43] a denominational Creed we who hold the
[1:20:46] precious word of God and the pure
[1:20:49] atonement sacrifice of Christ help us
[1:20:52] Lord not to see it tainted or divided or
[1:20:55] Lord to be messed up or confused or
[1:20:58] complicated help me as a minister Lord
[1:21:01] to preach such a powerful word that the
[1:21:05] people would be able to worship freely
[1:21:08] under the true opes of the word of God
[1:21:11] that's my desire Lord and I pray you'll
[1:21:14] Grant it in these Hearts if there's
[1:21:16] thoughts that invade them if there's
[1:21:18] thoughts of business thoughts of
