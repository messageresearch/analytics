[0:00] look to him tonight
[0:01] a gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're so
[0:04] thankful that that's more than just a
[0:06] song to us but a testimony of your power
[0:09] to save and to keep and to redeem in
[0:12] each of Our Lives father we have
[0:14] gathered together from many different
[0:15] places different different backgrounds
[0:18] we stand before you tonight as the
[0:21] redeemed of the Lord
[0:22] father we just ask now that you would
[0:24] just take this time and this service
[0:26] take this time which we've set aside for
[0:28] you and may you just come Lord we've
[0:31] invited you but may you be welcome now
[0:32] in this place to come and to have your
[0:34] way in our lives and in our hearts may
[0:38] you bless each one father may you touch
[0:40] the different needs tonight in a way
[0:42] which only you can do it Lord for you
[0:44] can do exceeding abundantly tonight in
[0:46] this place above anything that we could
[0:48] ask or even think father we just expect
[0:51] we look with expectation to what you're
[0:54] going to say and to do and we thank you
[0:56] we ask now all these things and may you
[0:58] receive all the praise and glory and
[1:01] honor for we asked in Jesus Christ's
[1:03] name amen may God bless you if you have
[1:06] your Bibles this evening I'd ask you to
[1:09] turn with me to the book of Nehemiah
[1:11] the second chapter I've been kind of
[1:13] doing a bit of a series of different
[1:15] places and I can just pick it up
[1:17] wherever but I was talking about the
[1:19] idea of a greater World contrasting the
[1:22] world that we are in now with the world
[1:24] which is to come and uh you know God he
[1:27] uses the law of contrast to prove his
[1:29] attributes you know there was attributes
[1:31] in him as a redeemer as a savior and of
[1:34] course we look at the seven Redemptive
[1:35] names of Jehovah and he's manifesting
[1:39] parts of himself attributes of himself
[1:41] to us that which is going to be
[1:43] displayed in a greater world the world
[1:45] to come and so I'd like to take a
[1:47] thought tonight
[1:48] the architect
[1:50] of a greater world
[1:52] and if you're with me here in the book
[1:53] of Nehemiah normally I would start here
[1:56] in the 11th verse but I'm going to look
[1:58] at the 10th verse of course Nehemiah has
[2:00] been given permission to go
[2:02] and rebuild the Wall in Jerusalem I
[2:05] think it's kind of interesting to look
[2:07] at it in the the context of the time
[2:09] that we live in they had a restoration
[2:11] of the temple there have been a
[2:12] restoration of the word but there were
[2:14] some homes and some lives that were
[2:16] centered around this place of worship
[2:18] that needed rebuilt still so Nehemiah
[2:21] obtains permission to go and to rebuild
[2:23] this and the enemies of of the Lord find
[2:25] out about this in the tenth verse and it
[2:28] says when sambalat the horror night in
[2:29] tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of
[2:32] it grieved them exceedingly that there
[2:34] was come a man to seek the welfare of
[2:37] the children of Israel I think it's
[2:40] interesting your enemy is grieved when
[2:42] God sends a man your way like a pastor
[2:44] like a minister I hope tonight by the
[2:46] help of God I can fulfill that how it
[2:48] Grieves your enemy when somebody comes
[2:50] with your welfare in mind God sends you
[2:52] somebody with a message to help you out
[2:55] Nehemiah of course he comes here verse
[2:57] 11 he says I so I came to Jerusalem and
[3:00] was there three days and I arose in in
[3:02] the night I and some few men with me
[3:04] neither told I any man what my God had
[3:07] put in my heart to do at Jerusalem
[3:10] neither was there any Beast with me
[3:12] saved the Beast that I rode upon
[3:14] and I went out by Night by the gate of
[3:16] the valley even before the dragon well
[3:18] and to the dung port and viewed the
[3:20] walls of Jerusalem which were broken
[3:22] down and the gates thereof were consumed
[3:24] with fire then I went on to the gate of
[3:27] the fountain into the king's pool but
[3:29] there was no place for the Beast that
[3:31] was under me to pass then went I up in
[3:34] the Night by the Brook and viewed the
[3:36] wall and turned back and entered by the
[3:38] gate of the valley and so return and the
[3:42] rulers knew not with her I went or what
[3:44] I did neither had I as yet told it to
[3:48] the Jews nor to the priests nor to the
[3:50] Nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest
[3:53] that did the work
[3:55] then said I unto them ye see the
[3:57] distress that we are in how Jerusalem
[4:01] lieth waste and the gates thereof are
[4:03] burned with fire come and let us build
[4:07] up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no
[4:10] more a reproach than I told them he
[4:13] begins to give a testimony then I told
[4:15] them of the hand of my God which was
[4:18] good upon me as also the king's word
[4:21] that he had spoken unto me and they said
[4:23] let us rise up and build so they
[4:27] strengthened their hands for this good
[4:30] work may the Lord bless the reading of
[4:32] his word you may be seated this evening
[4:34] so we're talking about the architect of
[4:36] a greater world you know one of the
[4:37] things that a a person that's in the
[4:39] world maybe a person that hasn't really
[4:40] sought the Lord or carnally minded
[4:42] person they they look at the world and
[4:45] the condition it's in today and they ask
[4:46] the question you know if God is a good
[4:48] God and God made everything why is the
[4:51] world so bad why is there homelessness
[4:53] and and sickness and starvation and
[4:55] oppression and every evil work if he's a
[4:58] righteous God why does he permit so much
[5:01] evil if he's a loving God why does he
[5:03] send people to hell and the answer is to
[5:06] why the world is so bad and it's evil is
[5:09] that the world that we live in today is
[5:11] not the result of the design of God but
[5:14] the perversion of that design by Satan
[5:16] so he is the architect of this Cosmos
[5:19] that we are living in today he perverted
[5:21] the original design and he's transformed
[5:24] it in what the prophet would Now call
[5:25] Satan's Eden amen and so I look at this
[5:29] original creation we want to go back and
[5:31] look at the original creation for a
[5:32] moment and brother Brandon he he goes to
[5:34] some length to really dramatize talking
[5:36] about the original creation how God
[5:38] would take 6 000 years to carefully
[5:41] craft a world for his children to dwell
[5:43] and he caused Great volcanoes and magma
[5:46] to shift into certain positions to to
[5:48] bring up mountains and and form land
[5:51] masses and the prophet said he would
[5:52] plant seeds and he would cause life to
[5:54] come forth from those seeds and he would
[5:57] create a situation where the lion and
[6:00] the lamb could lay down together and he
[6:02] places the stars and he sets them in a
[6:04] certain kind of an orbit and even today
[6:06] we can't build a clock that measures by
[6:08] the same precision as the cosmos of that
[6:11] creation and the prophet makes a
[6:13] statement he said it was perfect peace
[6:15] Perfect Harmony amen
[6:18] and so I want to remind you and I want
[6:20] you to think about this tonight that
[6:21] when God begins to paint this great
[6:23] picture or to craft this Great
[6:25] Masterpiece and he's looking at the
[6:27] world and doing these things he's not
[6:29] taking a blank slate or a blank canvas
[6:31] but he's taking a canvas of chaos and
[6:35] and of Darkness because the Bible says
[6:37] that the Earth was without form and it
[6:40] was voided this time when he began to do
[6:42] these things and we see this pattern
[6:44] time and time again with God and it
[6:46] would be one thing if God took a blank
[6:48] slate if he took an empty canvas and he
[6:50] created a masterpiece on that area he
[6:52] fashioned some sort of a masterpiece out
[6:54] of that but but the spirit of God begins
[6:56] to brood over the Earth and it's chaos
[6:59] and in its Darkness it begins to brood
[7:01] and it begins to change what you know
[7:03] the prophet said maybe it was a volcanic
[7:04] landscape or whatever it is and out of
[7:07] that condition he creates this paradise
[7:10] and brothers Branham says that God is a
[7:13] great contractor amen he lays all the
[7:16] material out it's not like me now I
[7:18] don't want to keep you Earl long tonight
[7:19] but I'll just tell you this I'm not a
[7:21] professional builder I'm not a
[7:22] contractor when I start a home project
[7:24] I've got to go to the store four or five
[7:26] times most of my time fixing something
[7:29] simple is spent going to the store and
[7:32] buying another screw or buying another
[7:33] Hammer I've got three at home I don't
[7:34] know where they're at go get another one
[7:36] amen but a professional knows what he
[7:39] needs at the beginning and he lays it
[7:41] all out it's already laying there and
[7:43] God is this great contractor everything
[7:46] he needs is laying there and he begins
[7:48] to work with the material that's laying
[7:50] there Amen in the midst of chaos and
[7:52] disorder and you know it's one thing if
[7:54] a man if he starts a business or a
[7:57] project or a church or whatever if he
[7:59] runs it right and he makes it successful
[8:01] that's a great thing but it's an
[8:03] entirely another situation if a man
[8:05] would take a business that was failing
[8:07] or a church that was falling apart or
[8:09] government or whatever it is and it's
[8:11] falling apart and it's going the wrong
[8:13] way and God and a man would take that
[8:15] and turn that around
[8:17] that takes a special kind of man a
[8:19] special kind of talent and that's the
[8:21] kind of man Nehemiah is here when we
[8:23] read in the Bible when he comes to
[8:24] Jerusalem there's not just a bunch of
[8:26] Timber laying out for him and some
[8:28] bricks that are stacked up and some nice
[8:30] machinery and everything's just looking
[8:31] good when he comes it's in distress it's
[8:35] chaos his beasts can't even go through
[8:38] the door half the time
[8:40] and Nehemiah doesn't come in there with
[8:42] a plan drafted up he didn't consult with
[8:43] some Architects and say well I think
[8:46] this is how we're going to restructure
[8:47] everything he's got he's got nothing
[8:49] from a man no sort of a plan or idea of
[8:52] his own but he comes in there to a
[8:54] disaster
[8:56] it's a disaster what he's looking at
[8:58] nobody wants to walk into a disaster and
[9:01] fix it but that's what God gave them
[9:03] and that's what God works with so many
[9:05] times there's rubble and there's debris
[9:08] he can't even take his mouth through but
[9:10] what he does with it is what made him
[9:12] such an example to us that he could take
[9:14] it in this condition and turn it into
[9:17] something that would magnify the Lord
[9:21] he has handed chaos and disorder many
[9:25] times you and I don't ask for the
[9:26] problems we have it's just kind of
[9:28] handed to us he testifies himself you
[9:31] see how great a distress we are in the
[9:35] walls lay waste Jerusalem's waste the
[9:37] gates are burned with fire and Nehemiah
[9:40] could have looked at and said you know
[9:41] what it's worse than I thought it was
[9:42] going to be I heard it was bad
[9:44] you know I heard about back in Babylon I
[9:46] heard about with the medes and Persians
[9:48] you know this is a lost cause I I knew
[9:51] there was going to be trouble but let's
[9:52] forget the whole thing it's a lost cause
[9:55] just forget it
[9:57] you've got to give me favor with the
[9:59] King God allowed me to be here God made
[10:01] Provisions for me and he brought me to
[10:04] this place but you know what the work's
[10:06] too great for me I can't do it
[10:08] let's forget the whole thing but that's
[10:11] not what he does he says you know you
[10:13] see how everything lies in wastes
[10:14] therefore let us come come let us build
[10:18] it up together
[10:20] you see the work is great it's going to
[10:22] require some great workers it's going to
[10:24] require some Vision it's going to
[10:26] require some sacrifice but we're going
[10:28] to do things with this when everybody
[10:30] else sees chaos they saw Rubble they saw
[10:33] distress but when Nehemiah looks at it
[10:36] he has a vision he sees there's
[10:38] potential laying there to build it into
[10:41] something new something greater than it
[10:43] was when he found it
[10:47] and the people he addresses they're all
[10:49] seeing the same thing maybe some
[10:51] scratching their head well listen we've
[10:52] looked at this for the last few days a
[10:54] few months how's the man going to
[10:55] rebuild us but he begins to testify got
[10:58] to give me favor with the King God had
[11:00] permitted me to be here God had
[11:02] permitted me the provision to be here as
[11:05] he begins to testify about what God had
[11:07] done in his life they get inspired
[11:09] listen if God can do that for Nehemiah
[11:12] he can do it for you he can do it for me
[11:14] he can take chaos like he did in the
[11:17] beginning and bring it into order
[11:20] amen they had been uh he they had been
[11:24] uh the scripture talks about they were a
[11:26] byword and a hissing to the Nations and
[11:29] people are making fun of them but God is
[11:31] going to take away their approach
[11:33] through restoration
[11:36] they're going to take a chaotic
[11:37] situation and bring it back to order and
[11:39] I want you to remember this tonight no
[11:41] matter what you're going through God
[11:43] excels at bringing order out of Chaos
[11:47] it's not just capable it's not just good
[11:50] at it he excels at taking the worst
[11:53] situations the most dire circumstances
[11:55] in turning it into a masterpiece you
[11:59] know what I'm talking about many of that
[12:00] was your life you can testify that's
[12:02] where you were but where are you at
[12:04] tonight God took the worst he took chaos
[12:08] and when the world looked at you and
[12:10] said that's impossible nobody can fix
[12:13] that God saw you like Nehemiah saw them
[12:15] laws he said there's a son there's a
[12:18] daughter of God laying in the midst of
[12:20] that
[12:21] you say it's impossible God Specializes
[12:24] and things thought impossible
[12:27] we look at the beginning out of this
[12:29] primordial chaos God brings Eden
[12:33] he didn't just fix it up
[12:35] made it perfect
[12:38] we're talking about God we're talking
[12:39] about Redemption
[12:41] he's wanting to he's wanting to
[12:42] demonstrate this is what kind of a
[12:44] redeemer I am I'm not just a good
[12:47] handyman not just a good Fixer-Upper I'm
[12:50] a redeemer I can take the worst and make
[12:53] it Paradise
[12:56] I can take the most dire circumstances
[12:59] and we even make a masterpiece
[13:02] but the RAM says this and Satan's even
[13:04] God's even was established in
[13:06] righteousness Satan's Eden is
[13:08] established in sin because Satan is sin
[13:10] God is righteous and God's kingdom was
[13:13] established in righteousness and peace
[13:16] and life and Satan's establishment is in
[13:19] sin and religious sin and I want to talk
[13:21] about this for just a moment because it
[13:23] makes sense that Satan's Eden was
[13:25] established in sin because it was
[13:26] founded and predicated on a single lie
[13:29] it was found on a lie and everything
[13:31] that's taken place today every every
[13:33] hospital and every sickness every
[13:35] depression it's all because it was
[13:37] funded on a lie Thou shalt not die
[13:41] so of course he distorts the commandment
[13:44] and we know the penalty of thereof is
[13:46] death and he's a pervertor of the truth
[13:48] and you know I think about this often
[13:50] that's all he can do is pervert he's not
[13:53] a creator
[13:55] sometimes we look at the world today and
[13:57] we think what a what a dire circumstance
[13:59] it is but listen Satan's never come up
[14:01] with anything on his own
[14:03] he's just the perverter of what God has
[14:05] done he's obsessed and you I think about
[14:07] this how frustrating it must be for a
[14:11] being that is obsessed with his own
[14:13] beauty that desires his own kingdom to
[14:15] glorify himself and to have a kingdom
[14:17] like the sons of God for all that yet he
[14:20] cannot create a blade of grass
[14:22] he can't create squirrels he can't do a
[14:24] single thing to think how frustrating it
[14:27] must be that in all of his achievement
[14:29] and all of Satan's eaten God has freely
[14:31] given to you and I what Satan always
[14:34] desires because death and life are in
[14:37] the power of your tongue your tongue has
[14:40] the power to create an atmosphere your
[14:42] tongue has the power by faith to speak
[14:45] worlds into existence and go live on
[14:48] them you were freely given he took the
[14:50] very dust of the Earth the very lowest
[14:53] thing he said out of this I will fashion
[14:56] Sons and Daughters of God to thwart the
[14:59] enemy
[15:00] and you serve as a constant reminder
[15:02] tonight that for all of his achievement
[15:04] and all that he can do and all the chaos
[15:07] he can create he has no power to create
[15:10] he has no power to redeem
[15:12] [Music]
[15:14] amen
[15:17] now you can use your tongue for good or
[15:19] evil amen there's creative power there
[15:21] but you know it's like it's like James
[15:23] says a falcon does a fountain bring
[15:25] forth bitter Waters than sweet God
[15:27] forbid you can take your tongue and you
[15:29] can say things to destroy people or as a
[15:31] Christian you have power in the words
[15:33] that you say they're not your words but
[15:36] as an amateur God I'm just when
[15:37] submitted to the headship of God the
[15:40] same one that created the heavens of the
[15:42] Earth the same one that raised Christ
[15:44] from the dead is in you to restore order
[15:48] to bring peace to bring Harmony into
[15:51] lives that are in chaos
[15:53] including your own
[15:54] hey man the words you testify over your
[15:57] own life will dictate where you're going
[15:59] to live at tonight
[16:01] amen
[16:02] and we look at Satan's eating today and
[16:04] and I want you to remember Satan did not
[16:07] build this Eden on his own he needed a
[16:08] man to do it because he he understands
[16:11] the potential that lies in man he
[16:13] understands it in your tongue is death
[16:15] and life it's there's creative power
[16:16] there and so he takes hands of willing
[16:19] people to fashion and to shape this Eden
[16:23] and he's so engineered this Eden today
[16:25] it's so designed to deceive the whole
[16:28] world
[16:29] whose names are not in the Lamb's Book
[16:31] of Life
[16:32] but yet for all that like I said he
[16:33] still can't redeem his soul
[16:35] amen can't create a squirrel he can't do
[16:38] one thing he cannot give life he can
[16:41] only take it
[16:43] hey man listen that's all he can do he
[16:45] can take he can rob he cannot give life
[16:49] but yet God has allowed you as the body
[16:51] of Christ to be instruments of his
[16:53] righteousness amen
[16:56] so he sewed everything in in confusion
[16:58] The Whole World's confusing they don't
[17:00] even know they don't know what their
[17:02] gender is they don't know what's right
[17:03] they don't know what's wrong what is
[17:04] right is wrong what's wrong is right the
[17:05] whole thing's upside down the whole head
[17:07] is sick the Bible says and I want you to
[17:09] remember that the fruit of chaos is
[17:12] confusion
[17:13] that's why the world's confused today
[17:15] it's in a chaotic State the fruit of
[17:18] chaos is confusion but the fruit of
[17:20] warrior is harmony
[17:22] not the harmony that men try to create
[17:24] with themselves or political
[17:27] affiliations it's the Harmony and
[17:29] creation itself that allowed a lion and
[17:31] a lamb to lay down together that allowed
[17:33] the cosmos to dwell together where
[17:35] there's no death no sin no
[17:37] unrighteousness the Divine Harmony is
[17:40] the fruit of the order of God because
[17:42] God is not the author of confusion
[17:44] where you see confusion you know who the
[17:46] author is amen the world's falling apart
[17:49] today
[17:50] the things of the world are falling
[17:51] apart and even all creation in the Bible
[17:53] says it groans within itself creation is
[17:56] groaning you think it's just you the
[17:58] whole creation's groaning because
[18:00] everything that can be shaken will be
[18:02] shaken it's being shaken right now
[18:05] so all the disorder in the world today
[18:06] it's a testament or an identification
[18:09] that Satan's the the the the author of
[18:11] it
[18:12] amen you take a certain man and I'm not
[18:15] an expert but you take certain artists
[18:18] and you know certain artists will make a
[18:20] picture a sculpture and you can make all
[18:22] kinds of imitations and all kinds of
[18:23] things and they look just like it but
[18:26] but a real expert they know how to
[18:27] identify the real from the fake because
[18:29] that that first author that first
[18:32] painter that first artist they use
[18:34] certain paints they did certain things
[18:36] that looked different and so they can
[18:39] identify who created something based on
[18:41] certain qualities inherent in the Arts
[18:44] and so we can look at the world today
[18:46] and we can look at the situation and
[18:47] realize this is Satan's brand of
[18:49] craftsmanship God didn't set the world
[18:52] in the condition it's in today it fell
[18:55] into it through death and Chaos that's
[18:57] how you know the Bible says his wisdom
[18:59] Satan's wisdom it's Earthly it's sensual
[19:02] it's devilish where envy and strife is
[19:06] the Bible says there is confusion
[19:10] Endeavor evil work in other words where
[19:12] Satan has wrote the the where he is the
[19:14] author of it that's why you have
[19:16] confusion that's why you have every evil
[19:18] work that's because he was the architect
[19:20] of it amen
[19:22] it's how you identify like an architect
[19:24] like an artist it's something that
[19:26] identifies it's his work but God is not
[19:28] the author of confusion he's the author
[19:31] of peace
[19:32] it's his identification in in creation
[19:35] it's his identification in Recreation
[19:37] and Redemption there's order there's
[19:40] Harmony there's restoration
[19:42] it looks like what it was designed to be
[19:44] in the first place amen
[19:47] as Believers we understand tonight I
[19:48] hope we understand this that the heavens
[19:50] and earth are going to be renovated what
[19:52] you're looking at today is not what it's
[19:54] going to be you can look at the world
[19:55] today and say how's it ever going to be
[19:57] because the architect has a plan
[20:00] he's already declared it he's already
[20:01] laid out the blueprint amen old things
[20:04] are going to pass away all things are
[20:07] going to be made new amen and God is a
[20:09] good contractor the material he needs is
[20:11] already laying here tonight he doesn't
[20:14] need a new ball of dirt he doesn't need
[20:15] a new word what he needs tonight for a
[20:18] new creation is already laying here just
[20:21] like in your life it was already laying
[20:23] there in the midst of confusion there
[20:25] was a seat in your life there was a word
[20:27] over your life and God begins to move
[20:29] upon that and it brings it into order
[20:34] amen
[20:35] all the things that are seen today
[20:37] they're made up of things which are not
[20:38] seen they're all upheld by the word of
[20:41] his power
[20:42] amen the worlds the Bible says they're
[20:44] upheld by the word of his power the
[20:46] materials there we believe in the word
[20:49] of God tonight amen if you believe in
[20:51] the word of God you believe in the word
[20:52] of his power we believe in the moving of
[20:54] the Holy Spirit you say why because the
[20:57] Same Spirit moved across the Earth to
[20:59] the beginning and brought it into
[21:01] harmony I believe that same spirit is
[21:03] here tonight in our lives taking chaos
[21:06] in sickness and disorder and bringing it
[21:09] back into harmony bringing it back into
[21:11] peace the fruit of righteousness his
[21:14] spirit is here tonight doing it in our
[21:15] lives
[21:16] we believe in the resurrection we
[21:18] believe in eternal life why because
[21:20] we're Witnesses of it this Earth is
[21:22] being redeemed the prophet said it
[21:25] Hadith baptism in the flood it was
[21:27] Sanctified when the blood of Christ fell
[21:29] from the cross and we understand tonight
[21:31] it's fixing to be burned with fire it's
[21:33] baptism of fire why to bring forth this
[21:38] new order
[21:39] this new Heavens this new Earth a place
[21:42] where everything will return
[21:44] back into Divine Harmony again
[21:47] a place for everything and everything in
[21:49] its place
[21:50] amen I don't know if we got any
[21:52] organizers here tonight but you know
[21:53] what I'm talking about this Fork goes
[21:54] here and this spoon here in my sock
[21:56] drawer amen we're not talking about
[21:57] organized religion we're talking about
[21:59] an order that God laid out people get so
[22:02] shook up by the idea of of order listen
[22:04] that's a that's biblical things should
[22:06] be in a certain order that's what makes
[22:08] it work
[22:09] I tell you what when your car is not in
[22:11] order it don't run the right way does it
[22:13] because everything that's in that engine
[22:15] hopefully is designed to work in a
[22:18] certain way it's there for a certain
[22:20] reason and when God made everything
[22:22] everything he made had a certain
[22:24] intention behind it
[22:27] God's intention behind everything he
[22:29] made was was the was harmony with his
[22:32] creation it was peace amen and so
[22:35] everything he's doing it has an
[22:36] intention and he's going to bring
[22:38] everything back into that and that's why
[22:39] the scripture says that the former
[22:41] things will pass away we read about it
[22:43] in the Book of Revelation
[22:45] he'll wipe away every tear from their
[22:47] eyes the Bible says there'll be no more
[22:49] death Hallelujah
[22:51] no sorrow no no crying no pain for the
[22:55] former things are passed away and he
[22:58] that sat on the throne declared behold
[23:01] think about that word behold God's like
[23:04] look over here it's pay attention look
[23:07] or see or take notice I want you to see
[23:09] this behold I make all things new
[23:13] God wants you to see he's drawing your
[23:15] attention behold I make all things new
[23:18] put your attention on the craftsmanship
[23:21] that I've raw in this new creation
[23:24] amen because listen in your own lives
[23:26] you might not always see it you might be
[23:29] looking tonight like Nehemiah and a
[23:31] bunch of rubble you might be looking at
[23:32] unpaid bills you might be looking at
[23:34] sickness you might be looking at
[23:35] problems or mind battles maybe you've
[23:38] dealt with it for years I don't know
[23:40] where you eat at tonight but behold look
[23:42] at this don't look at your problem
[23:45] tonight don't look at the circumstances
[23:47] look at what he's doing behold I make
[23:51] all things new
[23:53] amen praise the Lord listen Paul says
[23:57] the same thing in second Corinthians
[23:58] chapter five If any man
[24:01] be in Christ he is a new creature old
[24:04] things are passed away behold look see
[24:09] all things are new all things are of God
[24:13] it's not talking about your flesh he's
[24:15] talking about that inward man
[24:18] God didn't do a Part Way job when he
[24:20] saved you if he sealed you he sealed you
[24:23] to the day of your Redemption
[24:25] and you right now as a Christian all
[24:28] things that pertain to life and
[24:30] godliness they're in You by the Holy
[24:32] Ghost
[24:33] behold all the materials already laying
[24:36] there look at this everything's laid out
[24:38] already
[24:40] amen
[24:42] so we identify Satan his Works Jesus did
[24:44] the same thing Saint John the 10th 10th
[24:46] chapter he said the thief
[24:49] comes what to steal
[24:51] to kill and to destroy but I have come
[24:54] Hallelujah I believe that's why he's
[24:56] here tonight in us I have come that you
[25:00] might have life and you might have it
[25:02] more abundantly
[25:04] God is not out tonight to steal your joy
[25:07] amen that's the enemy he's not here
[25:10] tonight to steal your health he's not
[25:12] here tonight to steal your peace he's
[25:13] not here tonight to steal your blessing
[25:15] that's why the enemy comes but he's come
[25:17] that you might have a life and that you
[25:19] might have it more abundantly
[25:21] you know what abundance is more than you
[25:23] need now I just got enough life in me to
[25:26] make it to the next church service I've
[25:28] got just enough life to be happy for a
[25:30] couple days and then when I run Drive no
[25:32] you've got abundance of life you drink
[25:36] this water you never have to thirst
[25:38] again
[25:39] people coming they're trying to crank it
[25:41] pulled all the time I I wish I could get
[25:43] more of this I wish listen if you're
[25:45] planted in this Fountain you can have as
[25:47] much as you want you just have to drink
[25:49] it he's giving you life and it
[25:51] abundantly
[25:55] all the joy You'll Ever Need Is In You
[25:56] by the Holy Ghost if you've got the Holy
[25:58] Ghost
[25:58] the kingdom of God's not meeting your
[26:00] ink it's righteousness and peace and joy
[26:04] in the Holy Ghost
[26:06] now you might not tonight I wish I had
[26:08] my my joy it's still there
[26:11] don't let the enemy tell you it's gone
[26:13] he's lying to you
[26:14] he's trying to steal something from you
[26:17] because it doesn't belong to him
[26:19] it belongs to you that's what makes him
[26:21] a thief it's yours
[26:24] my joy is not diminished my peace is not
[26:27] gone my God tonight is greater
[26:30] than any works of the enemy greater is
[26:33] he that's in you than he that's in the
[26:35] world my architect he's not built on a
[26:37] faulty Foundation he's not built my life
[26:40] after circumstances and chants but
[26:43] before the world began he knew the plans
[26:45] he had for you plans for peace and for
[26:47] an expected end
[26:49] you're not some shock or something mean
[26:52] to you're a masterpiece you're the
[26:54] habitation of the Living God
[26:57] he ordained you
[27:00] to be the dwelling place of his spirit
[27:04] Hallelujah
[27:06] no but brother look at all the wreckage
[27:08] look at all the broken pieces of my life
[27:10] in all that yet God chose you for this
[27:13] purpose
[27:15] listen you weren't designed to be sad
[27:16] you weren't designed to be sick that's
[27:18] through that's through a fall but the
[27:20] healers here tonight the redeemer's here
[27:23] tonight and he's working in your life
[27:25] and that's what makes you different
[27:27] because God has an order and he has a
[27:30] way
[27:31] and whenever we'd venture outside of
[27:33] that
[27:34] whenever we deviate from this
[27:37] we've we've taken up with the same
[27:39] author that has designed Satan's Eden
[27:41] when we deviate from this blueprint
[27:43] that's where trouble comes in our lives
[27:45] I'm not just talking about circum I'm
[27:46] talking about real trouble because we
[27:48] have left the original design but if you
[27:50] stay with this I'm not promising you'll
[27:53] never have to work with some Rubble I'm
[27:55] not promising you're never going to come
[27:56] to some walls that I wrote down but what
[27:58] I will promise is the architect will
[28:01] restore back
[28:03] He restored the word on this day he is a
[28:06] restorer and then he can ReStore in your
[28:08] life
[28:13] there's something different about you
[28:15] than the rest of the world you think
[28:16] about it God has an order and a way to
[28:18] things like I said and Satan's got his
[28:20] own thing what makes us different
[28:22] you look at Lucifer Lucifer's desire in
[28:25] the beginning you know he desired to
[28:27] have the glory like God he wanted God's
[28:29] power he wanted his glory he wanted his
[28:31] position he wanted his kingdom there's
[28:33] one thing about God Satan didn't aspire
[28:35] to be in
[28:37] he did not aspire to be God in his
[28:39] character
[28:42] he wanted power position Prestige he
[28:45] didn't want the character
[28:47] of God
[28:48] and that's What Makes You Different
[28:50] tonight
[28:52] amen
[28:53] it's not that you come to church it's
[28:55] not that you say Amen it's not all these
[28:56] those things are good they're fine but
[28:57] the character
[28:59] in your life in the midst of Chaos in
[29:03] the midst of rubble and darkness and
[29:04] confusion the character you demonstrate
[29:07] brother said we've been invited think
[29:09] about this it's an invitation tonight
[29:11] you've been invited to shape your
[29:13] character after his after Christ
[29:17] now the world doesn't look at that
[29:18] invitation and get real giddy about it
[29:20] you know if their favorite rock star or
[29:22] somebody invite them they'd be right
[29:23] there and here comes a notice you've
[29:25] been invited to have the character of
[29:27] Jesus Christ and like we'll see ya
[29:30] well who wants to do that I do
[29:33] you do what put that in you God put that
[29:36] in you
[29:38] your character must be proved because
[29:41] your time-tested memorials hey man so
[29:45] God will take the very works of Satan's
[29:47] Eden and use the chaos and use negative
[29:50] circumstances and use problems to prove
[29:53] that you are a time test Memorial
[29:56] you're not designed for this world
[29:58] Satan's Children are designed for this
[30:00] world you might you've not been designed
[30:02] for this world that's why you don't fit
[30:04] in there's nowhere in the plan for you
[30:06] you've been designed for the world to
[30:09] come
[30:11] I just don't know why I don't fit in
[30:12] you're not supposed to that shouldn't
[30:15] discourage you you should be so happy
[30:16] I'm so glad that there's no room for me
[30:18] in this building because I'm going to a
[30:20] greater one I'm going to a place where
[30:22] all these things cease to be
[30:27] so you look at the intent God is not
[30:31] like men
[30:32] God doesn't just do things on a whim or
[30:34] willy-nilly doesn't mince words
[30:36] everything that God did always has a
[30:38] specific intent behind it that's why the
[30:42] Bible says there's a purpose to
[30:43] everything under heaven amen
[30:47] So Divine intelligence
[30:49] gives Divine intent
[30:51] for a Divine Purpose
[30:54] your purpose is not like the rest you
[30:55] have a Divine Purpose there's prophecy
[30:58] that was spoke over your life before the
[31:00] worlds began and your purpose is a
[31:02] different kind of purpose your purpose
[31:04] is to glorify God in his character
[31:10] the scripture talks about Jerusalem in
[31:12] the Book of Ezekiel the 40th chapter the
[31:13] very end there
[31:15] it's time out in the time of restoration
[31:17] of things in the Millennium the worship
[31:19] and the oblation are restored in Israel
[31:21] and all these things
[31:22] and it's interesting because the Bible
[31:24] talks about this the very the very last
[31:25] part of that chapter
[31:27] the Bible says that the name of that
[31:29] City talk about Jerusalem the name of
[31:31] the city from that day shall be the Lord
[31:34] is there in Hebrew it's Jehovah shama
[31:37] the Lord is there
[31:40] and so this is this prophecy is given to
[31:42] Ezekiel during the time of the Captivity
[31:44] the Jews are in Exile they're looking
[31:46] towards their Homeland their their
[31:48] prisoners they're Exile their City walls
[31:50] are broken down everything's falling
[31:52] apart but yet there's given a promise
[31:54] that one day people will look at the
[31:57] city
[31:58] they're going to look at their lives
[31:59] they're going to look at what God has
[32:00] done saying you know what the Lord is
[32:02] there why because only God could do that
[32:05] we know God is there because only God
[32:08] could have performed and fixed that
[32:10] place up from what it was Jehovah shama
[32:13] the Lord is there it's a witness they
[32:15] could look at the architecture they
[32:17] could look at the intent and say you
[32:18] know what that's God's handiwork that's
[32:20] not what a man would do that's not what
[32:22] Satan would do that's God God is there
[32:25] the Lord is there Jehovah Shama
[32:28] we one day we're going to be in a New
[32:30] Jerusalem and the Bible says there'll be
[32:32] no need for a temple there because the
[32:34] Tabernacle of God is with men the Lamb
[32:38] of God and the Lord God Almighty they
[32:41] are the light of that City let me
[32:43] testify to you for me it won't be that
[32:46] the Lord is there it'll be that the Lord
[32:48] is here because I'm not going to be
[32:50] looking at it from the outside but
[32:52] people are going to look at where you're
[32:53] at people are going to look at where I'm
[32:55] at and say you know what that's where
[32:56] Jehovah is Jehovah shama the Lord is up
[33:00] there that city is not like every other
[33:02] City the Lord is in that City
[33:05] how do you know you look at house
[33:07] designed you look at the character of it
[33:09] it shows or proves who the architect is
[33:14] ah man praise the Lord
[33:16] Jesus
[33:17] himself he told his disciples
[33:21] I'm going to prepare a place for you
[33:24] hey man it's already there's already
[33:26] been preparations made I'm going to
[33:28] prepare a place for you that where you
[33:31] are
[33:32] I'll be there also Jehovah Shama
[33:36] he designed it so that you would
[33:37] cohabitate it with him he didn't design
[33:39] it for himself alone nor did he design
[33:42] for all of us to be there without him it
[33:44] doesn't work unless we're all there
[33:46] because the Lord is there and we're
[33:48] there
[33:49] praise the Lord
[33:52] all the materials already laying there
[33:54] the Bible says that second Corinthians
[33:55] the I believe it's the fifth chapter of
[33:57] this Earthly House of a tabernacle be
[34:00] dissolved we've got one waiting
[34:03] God's not waiting and pending upon your
[34:05] demise on this Earth it should should
[34:07] the Lord tearing you die he's not
[34:09] waiting for those that moment to say you
[34:10] know what I'm going to go fix them up a
[34:12] little place or get them an apartment no
[34:14] we've got a house we've got a body we've
[34:17] got something that's already waiting on
[34:19] us
[34:20] because you were designed for it
[34:22] amen we are not like the rest of the
[34:26] world we are like Abraham Abraham was
[34:28] looking for a city with foundations
[34:32] it's built on something it's not like
[34:34] the empty promises of this world but
[34:36] it's built on something a foundation
[34:39] whose city the city the Builder and
[34:41] maker of is God
[34:44] Abraham was looking for it Abraham seed
[34:46] looks for it today amen we're looking
[34:47] for new heavens and a new Earth
[34:49] praise the Lord that's why brother
[34:51] Raymond I want to really touch on this
[34:53] for a second brother Branham said that
[34:54] Christianity is not based on replacement
[34:56] but on Resurrection
[34:59] Amen in other words he's not going to
[35:00] get a new lump of clay he's not going to
[35:02] get a new you what he needs is there
[35:04] he's going to resurrect or bring to life
[35:06] or Quicken what's already laying there
[35:10] amen
[35:12] why because he cannot deviate from his
[35:15] original pattern because there was an
[35:16] intent behind it
[35:18] right so how God said he wanted to do it
[35:19] in the beginning is how God's going to
[35:21] do it in the Book of Genesis the first
[35:23] chapter and the 26th verse the Bible God
[35:27] he makes us he makes a declaration he
[35:29] makes a covenant he said that he he
[35:31] looked at man and he behold that man was
[35:33] good he said let man have dominion over
[35:37] the earth now listen when God spoke that
[35:40] the fall didn't change that
[35:42] the passage of time didn't change that
[35:44] sin did not change that God ordained for
[35:47] this Earth to come under the Dominion of
[35:49] a man and so it will be in the end
[35:52] because God can never leave the original
[35:54] design
[35:56] amen
[35:57] brother Brown says this in the future
[35:58] home message is 64. he says the Divine
[36:01] Architects praise the Lord
[36:03] say I didn't come up with it anyway
[36:05] the Divine architect has designed this
[36:08] for his beloved oh what a place it must
[36:10] be Hallelujah think about tonight
[36:13] friends what a place it must be when
[36:15] divine nature a Divine architect has
[36:18] designed it for a Divine attribute
[36:20] that's been divinely predestinated by a
[36:23] Divine God who's the author of Divine
[36:25] Life what will that City look like think
[36:28] of it
[36:28] remember it's not heaven Johnson John
[36:31] said I saw it coming down out of Heaven
[36:34] it's got to be on the Earth
[36:37] see not this Earth's gonna pass away
[36:39] it's a redeemed Earth God didn't say he
[36:42] was going to raise up a new generation
[36:44] he is going to redeem the one that's
[36:47] here
[36:48] saying this for a reason listen if God
[36:50] ordained you for that purpose no matter
[36:52] what you do you can't change that
[36:55] because you didn't start it you're not
[36:57] the author of it so you can't be the
[36:59] finisher of it if God designed you for
[37:01] that he can no more get rid of you than
[37:03] it could the Earth or the Sun or
[37:06] anything else
[37:07] hey man
[37:09] not this or it's going to pass it's a
[37:11] redeemed Earth God didn't say he was
[37:13] going to raise up a new generation he's
[37:15] going to redeem the one that's here he's
[37:17] going to raise up a new one he redeems
[37:18] the one he repeats himself so I'm not
[37:20] just
[37:21] amen he's gonna the one that's already
[37:23] here he ain't gonna make no new world
[37:25] it's this one right here he's just gonna
[37:28] burn it off and cleanse it like he did
[37:31] you
[37:33] and then he makes a statement I think
[37:35] this is really profound his plans must
[37:39] forever remain
[37:42] remember that his plans must forever
[37:45] remain that means his plans for you must
[37:48] always forever remain
[37:50] now his plan and what you look like
[37:52] might not always be the same thing
[37:54] that's where we get discouraged say well
[37:56] I don't look like I ought to look like
[37:57] well that's because he's not done yet
[38:00] hey man remember I I use this a lot God
[38:03] is always reliable but God is never
[38:06] predictable there's a difference
[38:08] God is reliable but he's not predictable
[38:10] he'll tell us something we know he'll
[38:13] bring it to pass but he'll never do it
[38:15] the way you and I think he's
[38:17] unpredictable his ways confound the wise
[38:19] but he'll do it all the sin
[38:23] and that's why I make this this I'm
[38:25] saying all this to make this point we're
[38:26] talking about Jehovah shama the Lord is
[38:28] there how do you know he's there the
[38:30] Harmony and the design shows that he
[38:32] made it
[38:34] the design shows us his architecture
[38:37] I think about the book of Exodus and and
[38:39] you look through the the first five
[38:41] books of the Bible the Torah and and God
[38:43] he begins to show Moses the plan one day
[38:45] for a tabernacle he designs a tabernacle
[38:48] with curtains it's supposed to be and
[38:50] I'm not going to go through all the
[38:51] particulars tonight because I couldn't
[38:52] remember it all anyway but you know
[38:53] there's Badger skins and there's
[38:55] curtains there's an outer Court there's
[38:56] the inner Court the ark all these things
[38:58] God designs us Moses doesn't sit down
[39:00] one day on top of the mountain with a
[39:02] scratch pad and a napkin say well you
[39:04] know what I I think this would be a good
[39:05] design and I will consult some
[39:07] Architects I'll get a couple of
[39:08] estimates made up that's not how this
[39:10] works God shows him the pattern and he
[39:13] if he follows the pattern God will bless
[39:16] him because he followed the pattern amen
[39:18] God's chosen it because God the
[39:21] architect he has a plan and and brother
[39:24] Graham talks about this he says that
[39:25] this Bible for us today this is the
[39:28] blueprint he says but the Holy Spirit
[39:30] fills it in for us it builds it up
[39:34] so if we want to look like what this
[39:35] says the Holy Spirit does the work in US
[39:37] amen
[39:39] I think about it again you read in the
[39:41] book of First Kings the sixth do we have
[39:43] any builders contractors whatever in
[39:45] here to show hands maybe a couple people
[39:47] God I'm I feel better now I could say
[39:49] whatever I want you wouldn't even know
[39:50] it's all about Joyce and that's the only
[39:53] word I know but
[39:56] you look in the book of First Kings the
[39:58] sixth chapter
[39:59] and Solomon is is building this Temple
[40:02] and we're probably hopefully we're all
[40:03] familiar with the story but David he he
[40:05] commissioned Solomon to build this
[40:07] Temple and he goes and gets Lumber and
[40:09] gets all these different things and he
[40:10] begins to build it and it's remarkable
[40:12] the prophet talks about it as well
[40:14] you know in the entire time that this
[40:16] work is done there was never the sound
[40:18] of an ax or a hammer there's no soul
[40:21] there was never the sound of any tools
[40:23] that was working in that Temple all the
[40:26] pieces were fabricated off-site and then
[40:29] they're brought to the temple and
[40:30] they're put together
[40:32] and I begin to think about this now
[40:33] again I'm not a professional but just
[40:35] from an engineering standpoint that's
[40:37] absolutely astounding
[40:39] to think that men
[40:40] could make pieces of wood and make
[40:43] pieces of pillar and then make these
[40:44] things and they bring them together and
[40:46] it fits together perfectly
[40:50] yeah listen that doesn't happen
[40:52] hey man listen not only is the pattern
[40:55] that's what I'm getting at Not only was
[40:57] the design perfect they never had to
[40:59] reach you know re-measure something or
[41:01] well this beam is going to be too high
[41:02] or this is that not only was the pattern
[41:05] perfect from the get-go but the workers
[41:07] human men
[41:09] human labors were so inspired by the
[41:12] blueprint they were so inspired by the
[41:15] plan of Solomon that he had from God
[41:17] that they themselves begin this perfect
[41:20] craftsmanship and when they breathe
[41:22] together everything fits perfect
[41:25] not not one thing and it's short not not
[41:27] one bit it's a it's perfect why because
[41:29] they got inspired
[41:31] by the one that designed it amen that's
[41:33] absolutely extraordinary
[41:36] especially to me because I can't put two
[41:38] pieces of wood together to save my life
[41:39] I gotta saw this and cut that and read
[41:41] about you praise the Lord
[41:44] but it fits together perfectly
[41:47] so much they don't have to make
[41:48] Corrections they don't have to fix
[41:49] anything because the design was so
[41:52] perfect they come under the same
[41:54] inspiration and I believe today this is
[41:56] why I say this that I believe today God
[41:58] is doing the same thing with his church
[42:01] with his bride amen we are Lively Stones
[42:04] the Bible says in a spiritual house and
[42:07] we're so honed by the spirit of God so
[42:09] there's no Schism or Gap and listen if
[42:12] God can do it with natural workers
[42:14] that's amazing then why do you think you
[42:17] can't do it with you and I today
[42:19] good yeah you believe the scripture the
[42:21] testimony of that temple being built
[42:23] that way and and Moses and all these
[42:25] different things if they were that
[42:27] inspired what do you think you're
[42:28] inspired by today the same one
[42:31] the same one's working in your life he
[42:33] has so designed you he is so working on
[42:36] each and there's not one Schism not one
[42:38] Gap
[42:40] you know that's something you hear a lot
[42:41] to do we hear it about it a lot you know
[42:43] the churches are divided the churches
[42:44] we've got denominations and groups and
[42:46] schisms and this and that even in the
[42:48] message we've got so many different
[42:49] divisions I want to remind you the
[42:51] church is not divided
[42:54] Paul says that in First Corinthians 12
[42:55] Christ is not divided he's not men are
[42:59] divided people divide but the body of
[43:02] Christ is not divided if you're in the
[43:05] body of Christ it will fall into place
[43:08] perfectly no matter where you're at
[43:10] today he can bring you from Lebanon he
[43:12] can bring you from Syria it doesn't
[43:14] matter when it comes together it's going
[43:16] to fit perfectly
[43:18] not one more thing's got to be added or
[43:20] taken away it's perfect in design it's
[43:23] perfect in its execution amen
[43:25] amen
[43:27] praise the Lord
[43:29] I say this for a reason you and I aren't
[43:31] shaping the stones anyway
[43:33] God's doing the shaping amen God's the
[43:36] ones that's shaping this bill he's
[43:37] shaping you up amen because listen
[43:40] sometimes it seems impossible it seems
[43:43] absolutely impossible that God could
[43:46] reconcile people from every Kindred and
[43:48] tongue and nation and bring them
[43:50] together to make one body that seems
[43:52] impossible
[43:53] how do you get a bunch of people
[43:55] together for the Rapture they can't even
[43:56] get along when they go to church
[43:58] how you gonna do it Lord because he said
[44:02] what seems impossible to us it's
[44:05] possible it's just as possible as the as
[44:07] the Tabernacle in the wilderness it's
[44:09] just as possible as Solomon's Temple
[44:11] that God could take human beings with
[44:14] problems and faults and failures and
[44:17] take human beings and so Inspire them to
[44:19] make a perfect masterpiece
[44:23] why because he's the same architect
[44:24] today he's the architect of a greater
[44:27] world
[44:28] they had the Divine pattern then by
[44:29] David we have it today by the word of
[44:32] the Lord amen
[44:33] I think this is interesting First
[44:35] Chronicles 28 David's talking to Solomon
[44:38] now he's laid out the provision he's got
[44:40] gold he's got beams he's got everything
[44:41] laid out
[44:42] and at the end of all of this Solomon
[44:45] apparently has just made her he's
[44:46] worried
[44:47] well I understand why you're asking me
[44:49] to do something impossible I gotta do
[44:52] this perfect the first time there's no
[44:53] way
[44:55] and the Bible says David all this said
[44:57] David the Lord made me to understand in
[44:59] writing by his hand upon me even all the
[45:03] works of this pattern in other words
[45:05] David's like I didn't design this God
[45:07] did it
[45:08] and David said the Solomon said be
[45:11] strong of good courage in other words
[45:12] don't get worried be strong and of good
[45:15] courage and do it don't think about just
[45:18] go do what he said to do
[45:20] just go do it
[45:22] fear not nor be dismayed why for the
[45:27] Lord God even my God will be with me he
[45:31] will not fail thee nor forsaken until
[45:35] thou has finished all the work for the
[45:37] service of the house of the Lord amen he
[45:40] lays all this out he tells his son all
[45:42] these things he's got all this know-how
[45:43] he says son don't be afraid I know it
[45:46] looks hard I know it looks impossible I
[45:48] know you have every reason to think
[45:50] it'll never work out but there is one
[45:53] reason it will work out my God is with
[45:56] you he will not fail thee he'll never
[45:59] leave you he'll never forsake you
[46:02] and if you're here tonight because God
[46:04] brought you here tonight let me remind
[46:06] you he will never leave you he will
[46:08] never forsake you and that's why you're
[46:10] more than adequate
[46:12] you're not adequate in your own ability
[46:13] you're not had to quit in your intellect
[46:15] but you can do all things through Christ
[46:18] who strengthens you you're not here
[46:21] tonight of your own accord
[46:22] the Bible says it's God that works in
[46:24] you both to Will and to do his good
[46:27] pleasure
[46:29] amen
[46:30] my am I
[46:33] I want to remind you tonight the same
[46:35] architect that designed the worlds with
[46:38] meticulous care he laid out the
[46:40] foundations the same God that designed
[46:43] these this Tabernacles the same one that
[46:45] designed the temple he's the same one
[46:47] that's gone to prepare a place for you
[46:51] you are not fashioned after this world
[46:53] but that which is to come
[46:55] amen and sometimes we like Solomon we
[46:57] get All Shook Up Lord how are you going
[46:58] to do in my life it seems like it seems
[47:00] like sometimes the the more I do it
[47:02] seems like it's it's harder you go
[47:04] through times we go through valleys
[47:06] because that's where the fruit is it's
[47:07] not all mountaintops sometimes we're
[47:10] going through maybe you're going through
[47:11] the worst situation in your life tonight
[47:13] maybe you've got more mind battles
[47:15] tonight maybe you've got more problems
[47:16] tonight than you've ever had before and
[47:19] you're sitting there wondering Lord I
[47:20] feel like I'm so far away from what you
[47:23] want to do in my life but listen he said
[47:25] I won't fail you I won't forsake you I'm
[47:29] gonna bring it to pass
[47:30] out of the worst circumstances
[47:34] we get All Shook Up
[47:36] how's it going to happen how am I going
[47:37] to make an erafter how am I going to do
[47:39] this
[47:39] sometimes we get so shook up we don't
[47:41] know how we're going to make it through
[47:42] the day
[47:44] but I want to remind you fear not
[47:46] don't be dismayed my God won't forsake
[47:49] you he won't fail you he had begun the
[47:53] work in you is faithful to complete your
[47:56] life
[47:57] your times
[47:58] have not been left a circumstance
[48:02] amen
[48:04] amen your life is not life just you're
[48:08] not just floating like Driftwood your
[48:10] life and times are not based on
[48:11] circumstance it's not based on winds
[48:14] it's not based on current events it's
[48:16] based on the will of God
[48:19] God's taking great care God has a great
[48:22] interest in your life to make sure
[48:24] you're shaped into his likeness in all
[48:27] things because he wants his character
[48:28] that's what he's looking for
[48:31] listen you and I get worried about God's
[48:33] not worried about it
[48:34] God's not worried about any of us
[48:35] tonight he's not up there ringing his
[48:37] hands in heaven we're down here writing
[48:39] his hands for that matter I just don't
[48:40] know how I'm going to get that one in
[48:41] there's no virtue and worry anyway we
[48:44] were how many times you worry about
[48:46] something and you worry and you lose
[48:48] sleep and you I don't know how it's
[48:49] going to be you're here tonight and that
[48:52] thing that you just thought was going to
[48:53] overwhelm you it's just
[48:56] a disc amen well I'll raise my hand amen
[48:58] listen if he brought you this far he's
[49:01] not going to leave you now he didn't
[49:02] bring us this far to leave us
[49:04] he didn't teach you to swim to let you
[49:06] down hey man oh but brother my life's a
[49:09] complete mess I've got all kinds of
[49:11] issues everything's going wrong let me
[49:13] remind you once more God excels at
[49:16] bringing order out of Chaos
[49:18] the very thing you look at and say it
[49:20] can't be is why it will be
[49:22] the very thing you let discourages the
[49:25] very evidence that God wants to do
[49:27] something in your life
[49:29] amen listen if he can take dry bones and
[49:31] make an army he can take your life and
[49:34] make a masterpiece
[49:36] he can take a look that's devastated and
[49:38] bring it back into order
[49:43] how many times
[49:44] has he made a way when there wasn't even
[49:46] a way he made a way
[49:48] but there was no way out when you're
[49:49] against the sea he made a way
[49:54] my my
[49:56] you know I've heard this for years men
[49:58] men took this message and they turned it
[50:00] into a mess well that might be true but
[50:02] that's not my testimony my testimonies
[50:05] my life was a mess and God sent me a
[50:07] message
[50:08] listen my life was a mess and God made
[50:10] it a message I'm not just preaching I am
[50:13] the message that God is still a redeemer
[50:15] God can still bring order when my life
[50:18] was a wreck he made it a testimony he
[50:21] made it a message your life is a message
[50:24] you're living Epistles you're right and
[50:27] known of omen
[50:30] other people can take it and do what
[50:31] they want but for me it's Jehovah shama
[50:34] the Lord is there when I look back at my
[50:37] life and I see where I'm at today when
[50:39] you look in your life and you see where
[50:41] you're at you say you know what the Lord
[50:43] is there the Lord did that in my life I
[50:46] didn't do that
[50:48] I can't do that but he has done what I
[50:50] could not do
[50:53] Jehovah Shama
[50:55] the Lord is there
[50:57] Hallelujah
[50:59] listen
[51:00] brother Brown was preaching about job
[51:01] one time I think he had him on the ice
[51:03] sheet for six weeks or six months so
[51:05] what are you gonna get him off the ass
[51:07] sheep there brother Brandon well you
[51:08] know I don't know it's time of decision
[51:09] he said
[51:11] listen
[51:14] maybe you I don't know what you're going
[51:15] through probably none of us going
[51:16] through what job went through but maybe
[51:17] you're going through something tonight
[51:18] listen job's friends showed up
[51:21] and after they showed up and I commend
[51:23] them you know they sat there seven days
[51:25] in silence think about that we make fun
[51:27] of him for what they said but think
[51:29] about how sincere they were
[51:31] they sat there for seven days
[51:33] and then they begin to speak and listen
[51:36] they didn't have to tell job listen job
[51:39] I think you're in trouble
[51:42] listen Joe I think you're going through
[51:43] a trial job job did not need someone to
[51:46] identify that he was going through
[51:48] listen job he got it the message was
[51:51] loud and clear well you think you're
[51:53] going through something Joe you think
[51:54] I'm going through something what do you
[51:56] mean
[51:57] you dumb or what
[51:59] of course I'm going through something I
[52:02] know what I'm doing listen he didn't
[52:04] need someone to tell him what he was
[52:05] going through we all know what our
[52:07] problems are you know tonight better
[52:09] than almost anybody else what your
[52:11] problem is what your situation what
[52:13] you're so you know what it is you don't
[52:14] need me to tell you job didn't need
[52:17] somebody to tell him what he was going
[52:18] through what he needed was somebody tell
[52:20] him why
[52:22] why am I going through this and his
[52:25] friends had a lot of ideas
[52:27] well I looked up this blueprint one time
[52:29] and I knew this guy and I met this guy
[52:31] one time I shook hands with a guy and I
[52:33] think this and I think that they all had
[52:35] ideas well I think this is why
[52:38] but God knew why
[52:40] well maybe God's mad at you Joe God was
[52:43] bragging about him
[52:45] listen you go through things sometimes
[52:47] think why am I going through this God's
[52:48] making a boast about you to the enemy
[52:51] there's a son of God there's a daughter
[52:54] of God they're a Time tested Memorial
[52:56] you can touch them you can hurt them you
[52:58] can put them through certain things it
[53:00] don't matter they will not deny me
[53:03] because they didn't start I put
[53:05] something in them
[53:07] listen God put something in brother
[53:09] random when his daughter died and his
[53:11] wife died he wanted to give up but he
[53:14] wasn't designed to give up and when he
[53:16] wanted to give up he found himself
[53:19] speaking the same thing job said the
[53:21] Lord gives and the Lord takes away
[53:24] blessed be the name of the Lord
[53:31] why am I going through this Lord why
[53:33] that's the question we ask in other
[53:36] words what's the intention
[53:39] there's yeah you know I'm just speaking
[53:41] words in there what's the intent or
[53:43] purpose behind what I'm going through
[53:46] that's our question if we're all honest
[53:47] whatever you're going through that's
[53:49] your real question tonight you know what
[53:50] you're going through but Lord why am I
[53:52] going through this
[53:54] why Lord why do we live in such chaotic
[53:56] times why do we go through all these
[53:59] things why is the world so bad today but
[54:01] listen tonight you and I know why
[54:03] we know the Bible says all things work
[54:07] together for good
[54:12] to them that love God
[54:14] to them who are the called according to
[54:15] his purpose
[54:18] his intention his purpose
[54:21] that's why why am I going through this
[54:23] Lord people go through things all the
[54:25] time
[54:26] but you go through things for a
[54:27] particular reason
[54:29] all things work together
[54:31] for good
[54:34] no matter what it is no matter how bad
[54:36] it is all things work together for good
[54:38] to them that love God hallelujah
[54:42] to them who are the called
[54:45] according to his purpose
[54:47] we look at the intention and purpose of
[54:50] God's design our life and no matter what
[54:52] we go through like
[54:54] Lord I
[54:55] I don't know why Always I'm in this
[54:58] situation but I know alternates because
[55:00] it's for my good
[55:04] Ness amen
[55:07] I think it's really important
[55:09] why we do things why we do the things we
[55:12] do as humans even it reveals our
[55:15] intentions so many times what we're
[55:17] doing is not nearly as important as why
[55:19] we're doing it
[55:21] we can do all the right things
[55:23] for all the wrong reasons
[55:25] amen
[55:26] why do we do the things we do
[55:29] we have to ask ourselves well Lord why
[55:32] why do I feel this way why do we do this
[55:34] why we have to check but we know why God
[55:36] does
[55:37] all things work together you're designed
[55:40] by the architect of a greater world
[55:42] you're designed with purpose and power
[55:45] designed to be in His image
[55:49] it's funny you know it's funny because
[55:51] uh
[55:52] well I heard this statement years ago
[55:54] People Are People
[55:57] are funny you know like we're each these
[56:00] little clusters of drama and activity
[56:02] and lots of people they let the world
[56:04] passing by and they blame the system we
[56:06] we blame the church we blame our
[56:08] families we blame whoever everything
[56:09] that negative happens to us we've got to
[56:11] blame somebody
[56:13] but I'm saying this for a reason as
[56:15] Christians sometimes we blame ourselves
[56:19] and maybe you're supposed to but maybe
[56:20] not
[56:21] see Christians have this really
[56:23] I know it's Christians a lot of times
[56:25] they get frustrated with themselves
[56:26] because they possess this unique
[56:28] capacity that the world doesn't possess
[56:30] the capacity to look at what you've done
[56:33] and repent because you could be wrong
[56:35] because the world doesn't do that the
[56:37] world doesn't sit there well you know
[56:38] maybe I'm wrong about this no they they
[56:39] always think they're right you actually
[56:41] sit there and say maybe I was wrong
[56:43] about that because you acknowledge that
[56:45] there's a possibility you could be wrong
[56:48] sometimes you assume you're wrong even
[56:50] when you're not
[56:53] sometimes you sit there and you beat
[56:55] yourself up
[56:56] hey man you get discouraged you know
[56:58] it's like the disciples at the Last
[57:00] Supper each one of them sat there Lord
[57:01] is it I is it me am I the one that's
[57:04] wrong
[57:05] well they weren't all wrong in that
[57:07] sense amen
[57:09] sometimes when something's amiss in our
[57:10] own lives sometimes we we blame
[57:12] ourselves we're looking we were the
[57:14] first one and listen that's better than
[57:16] assuming everyone else is wrong first
[57:17] don't get me wrong but sometimes it's
[57:19] not that you did anything wrong
[57:21] sometimes it's not your fault sometimes
[57:24] it's just the purpose of God
[57:27] amen
[57:31] for you that feel that weight tonight I
[57:32] want to encourage you
[57:33] have patience with God
[57:36] because he is the one bringing
[57:37] everything in divine order in your life
[57:39] no matter what you're dealing with no
[57:41] matter what your problem is let me
[57:42] remind you that the Lord is there
[57:44] he's Jehovah Shama
[57:46] let patience
[57:48] have a perfect work in you
[57:51] the Bible says it's through faith and
[57:52] patience
[57:54] we inherit the promises
[57:56] the Bible says you have need of patience
[57:58] that after you have done the will of God
[58:00] you did the right thing
[58:02] that you might receive the promise
[58:05] brothers and sisters we endure many
[58:07] things in life everybody does but you
[58:09] and I are called to endure them
[58:10] patiently
[58:13] amen
[58:14] sometimes we're very quick to lose
[58:16] patience but the Bible says the
[58:17] husbandman of this Earth he waits with
[58:19] long patience
[58:22] for the fruit of it
[58:25] amen
[58:26] you know you look at the time it took to
[58:28] complete Solomon's Temple I think it was
[58:29] seven years you look at all these
[58:31] different things
[58:33] I ask myself and you you can disagree if
[58:36] you want I guess but you look at the
[58:38] time that God takes in the original
[58:39] creation he takes thousands of years and
[58:42] he does all these things and
[58:44] I I began to pray about it one day I'm
[58:46] like why did God take so much time in
[58:48] the creation why God can he could do it
[58:51] all at once right I mean he's able to do
[58:53] anything why does God take all this time
[58:56] to do it because some things are worth
[58:59] taking time for
[59:01] that's why
[59:03] when you take your time with something
[59:04] and you're applying your time to it the
[59:07] passage of time it allows transformation
[59:09] to take place it's an Evidence of your
[59:12] care
[59:13] it's an evidence that you are investing
[59:15] into something you take time with your
[59:18] children because they're important to
[59:20] you you take time for a project that you
[59:23] care about at work or at home because
[59:24] it's important to you so God does it as
[59:27] an Evidence of his care in your life
[59:30] so why isn't God done working in my life
[59:31] today because he wants to work on the
[59:33] whole thing
[59:35] because you're that important to him so
[59:37] he takes his time amen his time is an
[59:41] Evidence of his care for you listen God
[59:43] likes the way he designed he doesn't
[59:44] like the fall he doesn't like the
[59:46] consequences but he likes the real you
[59:48] God think about that tonight there's
[59:49] something about you God likes
[59:52] you know some of you feel like God loves
[59:53] you but maybe doesn't like you you know
[59:55] because we do that with people sometimes
[59:58] well I know God listen God likes certain
[1:00:01] things about you he likes the way you
[1:00:03] sing at church he likes the way you
[1:00:05] think about somebody that nobody else
[1:00:06] thinks about he likes the way you pray
[1:00:08] he likes the way you smile when he makes
[1:00:10] you he likes certain things about you
[1:00:13] God is not discouraged with you God is
[1:00:17] not as quick to give up on you as we are
[1:00:19] on him Nehemiah did not give up and I'm
[1:00:21] bringing this to head here but he did
[1:00:23] not give up because there was problems
[1:00:24] in rubbish
[1:00:26] amen I want to encourage you to have
[1:00:28] patience with God have patience with
[1:00:31] each other have patience with yourself
[1:00:33] amen
[1:00:34] amen well why can't I be this way
[1:00:36] because it's not maybe the time yet have
[1:00:39] patience with yourself sometimes that's
[1:00:41] the hardest person for us to have
[1:00:43] patience with
[1:00:45] we look at everybody else you know I I
[1:00:47] can't remember who said this I heard a
[1:00:49] man say this one time the problem is we
[1:00:50] we see every blooper in our life and
[1:00:52] watch everybody else's highlight reel we
[1:00:54] see the best parts of their life and we
[1:00:56] see the worst parts of ours and we
[1:00:57] sometimes we get discouraged and we lose
[1:00:59] patience that patients have a prefer
[1:01:02] perfect work in your life amen
[1:01:05] don't worry about criticisms
[1:01:08] when Nehemiah went to build this wall
[1:01:10] sandblot Tobias they got together you
[1:01:12] know what they said they said if a fox
[1:01:14] would run on this wall it would fall
[1:01:15] over
[1:01:18] God's Bill not that don't look that
[1:01:19] impressive
[1:01:22] but Nehemiah he was called on the by the
[1:01:25] Lord to to rebuild this
[1:01:28] the Bible says the people rebuilt the
[1:01:29] wall because they had a mind for the
[1:01:31] work and you know what happened to the
[1:01:33] critics they started getting worried
[1:01:36] maybe the critics in your life maybe
[1:01:38] they're laughing today well he don't
[1:01:39] look like much she ain't she don't
[1:01:40] amount to much but God begins to do
[1:01:43] something in your life oh Fox would
[1:01:45] knock that over the next thing you know
[1:01:47] God begins to work in your life and God
[1:01:49] begins to turn the situation around and
[1:01:50] the critics now they're getting worried
[1:01:53] oh my they got desperate because they
[1:01:56] realized criticism wasn't going to stop
[1:01:58] the work
[1:02:02] don't let criticism in your life stop
[1:02:04] the work you keep building you keep
[1:02:06] laboring your labor is not in vain
[1:02:10] he is not forgetful of your labor of
[1:02:12] love
[1:02:14] by the time they get done building the
[1:02:16] Bible says all the Heathen round about
[1:02:18] they looked at Jerusalem Jehovah's there
[1:02:21] Jehovah shama they looked at it and they
[1:02:23] realized they perceived the Bible said
[1:02:25] that the work was wrought of God
[1:02:28] even the enemies had to testify God did
[1:02:30] that
[1:02:32] you live such a life until even your
[1:02:34] enemies can look and say you know what
[1:02:35] God did that and they have to
[1:02:37] acknowledge it
[1:02:40] it's just a matter of time until your
[1:02:42] enemy realizes there's nothing
[1:02:44] he can do to stop God in you
[1:02:47] as the musicians would come tonight
[1:02:49] there's not one thing the enemy can do
[1:02:52] to stop you
[1:02:53] God started it
[1:02:55] God's gonna finish it I want to
[1:02:57] encourage you tonight like Nehemiah

[1:05:00] right but may we stay fastened upon this
