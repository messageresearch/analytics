[10:40] [Music]
[10:45] Jesus
[10:49] born in second Corinthians chapter 2
[10:52] and verse 11.
[10:55] I'm just there's just the whole section
[10:57] of scriptures but I'm just reading one
[10:58] for time's sake and this is the only
[11:00] thought that I want to get to
[11:03] Paul says lest Satan should get an
[11:06] advantage of us
[11:08] for we are not ignorant of his devices
[11:16] it's a good scripture for what I just
[11:18] talked about
[11:21] let me read that again I didn't tie that
[11:24] to get together until just now
[11:26] lest Satan should get an advantage of us
[11:30] for we are not ignorant of his devices
[11:34] so Paul expresses here that
[11:39] the way things that are supposed to be
[11:42] in a Christian walk and that is the
[11:46] normal way in a Christian believer's
[11:48] Life is that Satan should not have the
[11:51] advantage over us
[11:53] we know it should be the other way
[11:56] around that we should always have the
[11:58] advantage over Satan
[12:01] and and so he expressed as the less
[12:04] Satan should and if you want to read
[12:06] this week uh the preliminary scriptures
[12:08] and what led up to him saying that is
[12:10] actually based upon forgiveness and
[12:12] forgiving one another and forgiving a
[12:14] man who sinned in the church in First
[12:15] Corinthians he sinned and that he was
[12:18] openly coming to church still and taking
[12:20] communion and it was sinning and so they
[12:22] weren't dealing with it they were
[12:23] immature they weren't dealing with the
[12:24] sin in the count and so he rebuked them
[12:26] in First Corinthians and said deliver
[12:28] one up and deal with that sin well they
[12:30] dealt with it and the boy repented and
[12:33] then now he's talking about restoring
[12:35] him and bringing him back and forgiving
[12:36] him and if you forgive him then we'll
[12:38] forgive him so he's in that subject and
[12:40] then he comes we want him he says we
[12:42] want to make sure that's all clear lest
[12:44] Satan should get an advantage of us for
[12:47] we are not ignorant of his devices Satan
[12:50] is not to have an advantage in a
[12:52] believer's life we're not called for him
[12:55] to take advantage of us we're not called
[12:58] for the devil to slap us around we're
[13:00] not called called for the devil to bully
[13:03] us we're not called for the devil to
[13:05] intimidate us
[13:06] [Applause]
[13:07] can I get an amen this morning we're not
[13:10] called for the devil to slap us around
[13:12] and take advantage of us and intimidate
[13:15] us and I'm reminded of a quote that says
[13:18] overcoming means recognizing the devil
[13:21] at every one of his tricks in other
[13:23] words we want to live a life that's such
[13:26] ahead of the game that even before he
[13:28] brings the Temptation we know what it is
[13:30] we know the path that Satan's going down
[13:32] we know what trap he's trying to bring
[13:34] us in I would like to be able to live
[13:36] I'm just speaking to my wife the other
[13:38] day and was talking about the blood of
[13:39] Jesus Christ and I said hun it has to be
[13:42] two sides of the blood of Jesus Christ
[13:44] that it has the power to forgive us when
[13:47] we make a mistake how many believe it
[13:49] has the power to forgive us when we make
[13:51] a mistake how many is glad for that
[13:53] power but we also know there's another
[13:56] side to the blood of Jesus Christ and
[13:58] that is it has the power in it to
[14:01] protect us and keep us from sin and so
[14:04] many churches only preach this side of
[14:06] it that he forgives us when we sin but
[14:08] they Don't Preach enough on the other
[14:10] side that it's powerful enough to even
[14:12] keep us and protect us from sin
[14:16] best case scenario is we're living close
[14:18] to the Lord and there's less and less
[14:20] mistakes happening because we're living
[14:22] under the power of God every day to
[14:24] protect us from sin I can give you
[14:26] scriptures for that but that's the case
[14:28] we don't want to preach either side
[14:29] because a lot of times churches will
[14:31] preach the one side where if you get
[14:33] this and you have this experience you're
[14:35] going to do this and you're never going
[14:36] to make a mistake again that's not true
[14:38] then why would we need the blood of
[14:40] Jesus Christ because we're still in
[14:41] these bodies and we make mistakes
[14:44] but if we keep preaching this side we'll
[14:46] go on and on and keep making mistakes
[14:48] and not call upon God say God let me ask
[14:50] forgiveness from you but God put a power
[14:52] in my life that I would never do that
[14:55] again
[14:56] can I get a greater amen this morning
[14:58] the blood of Jesus Christ has covered it
[15:01] all for the believer's life
[15:03] and he is not supposed to be
[15:05] intimidating and taking advantage of
[15:08] Satan is not supposed to be taken
[15:11] advantage of us to have the advantage
[15:13] means this dude to have the advantage
[15:16] means a condition or a circumstance that
[15:19] puts one in a favorable or a superior
[15:23] position I'm going to read it again it
[15:25] means that a condition or circumstance
[15:26] that puts one the devil in this case it
[15:30] that condition or circumstance has put
[15:32] the devil in a favorable or a superior
[15:35] position in your life in other words
[15:38] something happens some incident happened
[15:40] a condition happen you got under the
[15:43] right atmosphere excuse me you got to
[15:46] understand maybe a wrong atmosphere
[15:47] because it goes both way right
[15:48] atmosphere a wrong atmosphere is going
[15:51] to put either God or the enemy in a
[15:53] superior position in your life so
[15:55] conditions or circumstances someone has
[15:58] a trial someone has a lost loved one
[16:00] someone has something bad happened to
[16:03] them even if a Christian
[16:04] circumstances or certain conditions if
[16:07] we're not careful it's not just what
[16:10] happens to us it actually elevates and
[16:13] promotes Satan in a superior position in
[16:16] our life I'll make it simple you make a
[16:18] mistake and the devil's beating you up
[16:20] and putting you down you're nobody
[16:22] you're not a son or daughter of God and
[16:24] keeps even though you have forgiveness
[16:25] you'll be beating yourself up the
[16:26] devil's beating yourself up and so now
[16:28] you stay there and guess what the devil
[16:31] has used your mistake to put himself to
[16:34] give himself a promotion or you gave him
[16:37] a promotion to a superior place in your
[16:40] life that he's taken advantage of the
[16:43] situation a lost loved one
[16:46] oh God you know we there's hard things
[16:49] to go through but the worst part of it
[16:51] is to give Satan through that situation
[16:54] a superior position in your life he's
[16:57] taken advantage of you he's beating you
[16:58] up he's keeping you depressed
[17:01] he's making you question the word of God
[17:05] and so to take advantage means a
[17:07] condition or circumstances that puts him
[17:09] in a superior position things happen and
[17:12] Satan gets in a superior position over
[17:13] you through that many circumstances
[17:15] happen in life and in a church many
[17:19] circumstances happen many different
[17:21] Spirits can come in a church and then at
[17:24] the end of it he if Satan takes
[17:26] advantage of the situation then we got a
[17:28] problem because we're going to have
[17:30] situations
[17:32] we're going to have circumstances
[17:34] but if Satan gets the advantage in it
[17:37] that's the problem can I get an amen
[17:40] he binds things up he kills unity and it
[17:44] was just a situation but if it turns
[17:45] into Satan getting a promotion in your
[17:48] life let me say it clearly if a
[17:50] situation or a trial or something wrong
[17:52] you've been done wrong or a mistake
[17:54] you're made that's one thing we can
[17:56] bring it to the Lord can you say it back
[17:58] but that's one thing but if if it makes
[18:01] you give Satan a promotion in your life
[18:04] and his position that's where you're
[18:06] going to have a problem
[18:07] he does not have a right unless you give
[18:10] it to him for a superior position to
[18:14] take advantage over you
[18:17] somebody say praise the Lord
[18:19] he doesn't have a right for that
[18:21] position
[18:22] we got to kick him out can you say man
[18:24] sometimes Satan takes little things and
[18:27] makes them huge things
[18:30] sometimes Satan takes something little
[18:32] and you can deal with it and he makes
[18:34] them big things and he gets the victory
[18:36] he gets dominance over you in the end
[18:38] result he's defeating you and we should
[18:40] say no devil no devil we're not going to
[18:43] let you do that you have not been given
[18:45] any Superior position in my life you're
[18:48] not going to take advantage of me you're
[18:49] not going to use any extreme situation
[18:51] to take advantage of my life he doesn't
[18:54] belong in that position he doesn't
[18:56] belong in your thoughts can you say Amen
[18:59] who gave him a place at the table in
[19:02] your thoughts he doesn't even have a
[19:05] right for a place at the table in your
[19:07] thoughts and you give them a place at
[19:09] the table
[19:12] he doesn't have a right it's like when
[19:14] he comes in your thoughts you should be
[19:16] saying
[19:16] what are you doing here
[19:21] I didn't invite you
[19:25] what are you doing here
[19:27] get out it's the door get out
[19:30] can I get an amen trying to make it
[19:32] simple for all of us is that you give
[19:34] them a place in the table and he doesn't
[19:35] have a right in the believer's Life a
[19:37] place at the table he doesn't have an
[19:39] opinion he doesn't have an appeal why
[19:42] are you listening to Satan's opinion he
[19:44] doesn't get an opinion
[19:47] it's my private world
[19:51] and yet Satan
[19:55] finds any way that he can
[19:57] to get into your house
[20:00] because how many knows the Bible says
[20:02] he's a thief
[20:05] he finds ways to come through the back
[20:07] doors of your life or even the basement
[20:09] window
[20:10] and you're saying I got that secured I
[20:13] got that locked there's no way he could
[20:15] have got in there listen if you're
[20:17] dealing with the professional Thief
[20:19] I don't care how much you've secured
[20:21] your house a professional Thief they
[20:24] have ways
[20:28] you're not a professional Thief but
[20:30] professional thieves It's amazing And
[20:33] you think they never get in there they
[20:36] never get in that basement window nobody
[20:38] could fit through that basement window
[20:39] don't underestimate the thief
[20:43] don't underestimate the thief that Satan
[20:47] is trying to get in your house I said
[20:50] brother Paul what's my house hold up
[20:51] your hands
[20:53] point back at yourself
[20:55] this is your house
[20:57] and the Bible says it's a temple of the
[21:00] Holy Ghost it's and and it's not a
[21:02] temple of the Holy Ghost but you rent
[21:04] out rooms to the devil
[21:10] it's not you can't call it the temple
[21:13] the mind the spirit the body everything
[21:16] and you can't say God is allowed in my
[21:18] soul but my body or my eyes every once
[21:22] in a while I rent out for other things
[21:24] no no if it's to be filled every fiber
[21:27] is to be filled and controlled by the
[21:30] Holy Spirit but Satan is a professional
[21:33] thief and he knows how to get in the
[21:35] back door now we're learning what's on
[21:37] Satan's mind and you have to know you
[21:39] can't be ignorant of Satan's devices you
[21:42] cannot be dumb concerning his schemes
[21:45] that he comes against you you can't not
[21:47] shut every window and every door of your
[21:49] household it has to be protected by the
[21:52] blood and by the word every day can you
[21:55] say Amen because there are too many
[21:57] devices that Satan is in control of and
[22:00] he'll get he's gonna come in that
[22:02] basement window he's going to come in
[22:04] through that phone he's going to come in
[22:06] to that app that you have on your phone
[22:08] he's going to come in through that that
[22:10] new app that just came out he's going to
[22:12] come in through the movies that you're
[22:14] watching he's going to come in through
[22:16] the music you're listening to he's going
[22:18] to come into what you're listening to on
[22:20] the radio any place that he's given he's
[22:22] going to try to sneak in your house
[22:25] I'm asking you to go back to the
[22:27] scripture that Paul instructs us as
[22:28] Believers we should not be ignorant of
[22:31] Satan's devices
[22:33] we should not be ignorant of how these
[22:35] things affect the brain can you say
[22:37] about and we should live that the devil
[22:40] does not have an advantage over us in
[22:43] any area of our life he does not belong
[22:46] in that place can you say Amen this is
[22:49] the devil's mind you want to know what
[22:51] he's thinking every day God's got
[22:53] Protections in place for the daughter of
[22:55] the king I'm preaching to the daughter
[22:56] of the king today I'm preaching to the
[22:58] Bride of Jesus Christ and God has put
[23:01] Protections in place for her
[23:03] and every day the devil is trying to
[23:06] ponder and scheme to get around those
[23:09] protections you ought to know that and
[23:12] you ought to say I'm not ignorant of his
[23:14] devices or what's on his mind I'm Gonna
[23:17] Keep the Protections in place
[23:21] I'm gonna read the word to my kids you
[23:24] know I almost weep because you might
[23:26] some of you older ones may resist this I
[23:28] don't know what you're gonna what you're
[23:29] gonna leave saying today it's fine with
[23:31] me but you know what I'm preaching to a
[23:33] lot these young lives that's going to be
[23:34] baptized today these young children
[23:37] they're gonna hear from this pastor
[23:39] because they're going to go into a world
[23:41] that is perverted and dirty everything
[23:43] that's good they're gonna hear a holy
[23:46] man of God tell them what truth is
[23:49] because I care for the future if we're
[23:52] here another 10 years they need to hear
[23:54] truth they need to Value the Protections
[23:57] in place they need to Value when a
[23:59] pastor says don't be alone together in a
[24:02] car with a guy or girl they need a
[24:04] pastor who says don't be doing these
[24:06] things don't touch one another don't
[24:08] kiss one another until you're married I
[24:10] don't care what standards you've
[24:12] developed the message says it the word
[24:13] says it and I'm going to preach tell
[24:15] keep preaching our young children this
[24:17] beautiful God I just I'm tired of the
[24:19] devil taking advantage
[24:20] [Applause]
[24:24] excuse me for my anger I'm not angry at
[24:26] you
[24:27] but I'm standing I trust you stand with
[24:29] your standing Affinity who takes
[24:30] advantage
[24:31] we say something that's the way that I
[24:33] want to live before the devil
[24:37] I want to live every day that the devil
[24:41] what he's thinking is that I'd like to
[24:43] get him but he's so hard to get to
[24:47] come on people raise your hand how many
[24:49] would like to live a life where the
[24:51] devil gets up Monday morning and say I
[24:54] have issues with this guy because I've
[24:56] looked at his life he's got every door
[24:58] covered everything locked up it's gonna
[25:00] be hard for me to get a plan together
[25:04] because he's hard to get to the Virgin
[25:07] bride of Jesus Christ that they the
[25:10] bride Jesus himself the reason the Devil
[25:13] Couldn't get to Jesus is because he had
[25:16] been sprayed with the repellent of
[25:18] predestination he knew his position he
[25:22] knew he was in the mind of God he knew
[25:25] he was predestinated to come to this
[25:26] earth and that strength was a protection
[25:29] and a repellent against Satan
[25:32] I'm preaching to a bride in this age and
[25:35] a bride that's listening online there's
[25:37] been protections put in place the
[25:39] repellent of predestination has been
[25:41] preached and when she stands in her
[25:43] position in the word it's hard for Satan
[25:46] to get to her
[25:49] bride is living in a place that if
[25:51] she'll stay behind the protections of
[25:53] God's word
[25:55] God
[25:56] has made it hard to get to this bride
[26:00] unless you open the doors and ignore the
[26:02] word of God
[26:04] you say well we don't have anything
[26:06] today we don't have anything for the
[26:07] Modern Problems yes we do
[26:10] God has sent us a message of Christ of
[26:12] the last days God has restored us back
[26:15] to the word don't ever let the devil
[26:17] tell you that there's not something in
[26:18] the word for a protection and place
[26:20] against the enemy God has made it hard
[26:23] to get to this bride
[26:25] look at all the word he gave to us in
[26:27] this hour and if you'll respect it and
[26:30] you'll live it Satan can't take
[26:33] advantage of your life
[26:34] guess what
[26:36] Satan's days are numbered
[26:39] Satan will come to an end someday
[26:43] but the bride will not come to an end
[26:48] thank you
[26:50] this isn't the end for the bride you
[26:52] make a mistake it's not the end for you
[26:54] but there will be an end to Satan
[26:56] someday there will be an end to him
[26:58] accusing us there will be an end to his
[27:01] thoughts he's putting in our mind that
[27:02] one day the accuser of our Brethren will
[27:04] be cast down that's promises in the
[27:06] Bible aren't you glad today that there
[27:09] will be an end to this mind that's
[27:10] coming against you every day there will
[27:13] be an end to that but to the bride who's
[27:15] living in the protections there will be
[27:17] no end to her she's going from here
[27:19] she's going in a Rapture she's going in
[27:21] a thousand years of Peace honeymoon and
[27:23] then she's going to a new heavens and a
[27:25] new Earth she does an end she keeps
[27:27] going on for eternity
[27:30] even though she makes mistakes even
[27:32] though she's went through things even
[27:34] though she lived right in the middle of
[27:35] Satan's Eden with his mind just
[27:38] conniving things constantly
[27:41] conniving
[27:43] scheming what can I do
[27:46] get around all this
[27:49] certain things in place brothers and
[27:50] sisters
[27:51] I know what you got to say about
[27:53] yourself but you can just say God's put
[27:55] things in place
[27:57] if I'll read it and I'll feed on it I
[27:59] will put that in my mind
[28:00] there's Protections in place
[28:03] Satan will not be able
[28:06] to get around
