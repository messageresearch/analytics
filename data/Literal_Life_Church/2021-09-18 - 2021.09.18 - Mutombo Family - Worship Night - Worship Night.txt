[Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is who you are [Music] [Music] amen oh how good is it being house i was thinking it was eight years uh ago it was actually i met my wife we got engaged when i met your pastor and his sons i spoke to this youngest he was he was i think 12 he said me and my wife have been married now for uh nine years this august so it has actually been nine years so just god is so good i had a testimony in when i i came to the message when i was uh right around 20 years old and i met my pastor pastor matumbo and it changed my life uh it was something it was more than just the message it was the people that presented the message that people can actually be what the bible shows living the word seeing the miracles seeing the the fruits of how they are how we are it's it's awesome this if this is your first time or if this is something that you've been listening to i know the ministry here is is very popular on the internet dive right in and uh one thing i can say is that don't live 99 as a christian that one percent gap is holding you back from all your blessings and that was one thing i learned in the very beginning i said i'm doing it this is real i love the lord with all my heart i'm going to serve them with all my heart i'm gonna put him first and everything everything and god has opened up doors beyond imaginable uh when sorry i get emotional talking about god so we got married uh right after i met your pastor it was probably two or two months right around there we were married uh then we also obviously tried to have a family um and it took a long time um to the point where we started talking to the doctor seeing what was going on and they said that that my wife had something um that made it difficult to have a child um so we just gave it to the lord that's all we could do and we had the pastor come pastor ben and we prayed and we prayed and we said we're just going to give it to the lord it's in his hands now that's all we can do and uh about a year later this is close to three years in pastor ben was visiting our other church in africa and when he was praying uh god showed him a vision and he was he was going through speaking about the church to the lord and said um you know lord please remember my brother justin sister lindsey my wife you know they're faithful to you lord they just want a child and god showed him a vision and said you can stop praying for him i bless them with a baby boy [Music] and uh [Applause] and uh that message got back to us in maine and we just confessed it we didn't doubt it i said amen and we went out and started telling people we're pregnant no holding back we're saying yeah we're having a we're having a baby and they'd say oh how far are you i think we're like a week or two and uh people thought it was kind of crazy but we confessed it and infested and confessed it and confessed it and uh my wife wanted to get a test i said you don't need to get a test just keep confessing when i was at work one day she called me and she ended up buying a test i listened to this whole thing and she uh she took the test and it came out it was negative on on it and she threw it in the trash and she just kept walking around the house i'm pregnant i'm pregnant i'm pregnant i'm pregnant i'm pregnant i'm pregnant and an hour later she went back to that test in the trash and picked it out and it was positive [Music] [Applause] and so she called me crying and crying i'm pregnant i'm pregnant i said i know i know she goes no i'm really pregnant i really know and uh she told me she took the test and it came out positive and uh so the next big the trial the test so we said we're having a boy he saw a boy it's a boy and uh we go to the hospital to finally where she's uh to that point and we get tested to them we're pregnant and it they they do the ultrasound and they find out the data conception and the sex of the baby the baby was a boy and not only was it a baby boy but the date of conception they give you a couple day range it was the same day we had the vision [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] to say god is good is an understatement to say god is great we don't even have the words to speak what he can do the message the word christ just take it all in if you if you feel like something i remember when i was younger in the message pastor ben was preaching about the water how it how it washes your body and when you're alone and it's washing and you're in the shower that water touches every filthy place on your body and that word is the word of that water is the word of god and if we can be intimate with god and open ourselves up and let him cleanse us every filthy place just let it go and god can forgive you and you can move on and you don't have to ever look back and you're a new creation born again amen god is good all the time amen so god bless you i just want to share a little testimony with you thank you so much for for welcoming us here it feels so good to be uh this is one of the only message churches i've ever been in really off the uh off main in boston and it's just so good you can feel people's spirit here it's a great place uh you're very lucky to have a good pastor uh a good body of fellow of uh fellowship here so amen so god bless you we love you so much we invite you to maine and come see us god bless you all [Applause] so [Music] hey get in you're sitting a little too far away man yeah yeah come on come right up here [Music] i'm rejoicing night and day as i walk the narrow way for the hand of god in all my life [Music] now the comforter oh [Music] [Music] [Music] all the world has taken wings long ago [Music] now [Music] is [Music] with me fill my way every day
