to my God is biger better stronger greater than much better stronger than bigger better stronger greater than biger better stronger greater better stronger greater thaner stronger greater than 2 Chronicles 29 verse 1 Hezekiah began to Reign when he was 5 and 20 years old and he reigned 9 and 20 years in Jerusalem and his mother's name was abah and the daughter of Zachariah and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord according to all that David his father had done he in the first year of his reign in the first month opened the doors of the house of the Lord and repaired them now you got to know the reason that he had to open the doors and repair the temple and repair the doors is because they went through a cycle of rebellion against God under certain Kings and the temple got destroyed the temple was not taken care of and so the first year of his reign in the first month he opens the doors and begins to repair the temple and the doors and he brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them together into the East Street and said unto them hear me ye Levites sanctify now yourselves and sanctify the house of the Lord God of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness out of the Holy place you see in verse 15 that they did it they gathered their Brethren and Sanctified themselves and came according to the Commandment of the King by the words of the Lord to cleanse the house of the Lord now we pick up just a a a similar theme over in the New Testament I believe it's 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and I'd like to add that in so that it's on our our minds as well this morning what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify God in both your in your body and in your spirit which are Gods now there's a reason that he's saying uh have you forgotten to the Corinthians have you forgotten because if he says do you remember your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost if he's reminding them of what this Temple is for then that means we we can forget and he's going what don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost and I'd say many of us forget sometimes what this Temple is for it's not for our own uses but it's to be a temple of the Holy Ghost and it's not supposed to be the glory just in our soul but he said glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are by the way Gods you're bought with a price the blood of Calvary you're not your own own can you say amen and so you can't rent out parts of your house for other means it all belongs to him it's been purchased by him if we forget that then we'll tend to allow the body to be to bring things in and then sometimes God has to remind us cleanse the house cleanse the body because remember it's for the lord it's a temple of the Holy Ghost we had been learning uh in some of the services in the past that there are certain things that we can say or certain actions that we can do that really please the Lord and uh some things that please the how many just would just agree together I want to do things that please the Lord I think all of us have that in common I I want to do things that please the Lord and so there's something about that but there are sometimes things that please the Lord and make him smile and make him very and actually moves his heart there are some unexpected things sometimes that please the Lord and uh I'm sure there are many people who uh uh Express that they want to please God and and that is a wonderful thing in fact something within us is you know there's something within human beings that hunger for approval uh we like to be pleasing when we grow up we like to be pleasing to our parents we like to be we we like to seek approval approval is a great hunger in people's lives they hunger to be approved of they hunger to be praised they they hunger to want to be pleasing to people matter of fact some people go to an extreme and they're called people Pleasers they hear they live their whole life trying to please people and usually at the end of the life if they don't change that they get disappointed because they're living their life trying to please people and they realize it's not possible to please everybody perfectly the way that you want to so then they need to come to the Lord because you see now it's not about pleasing people that's a nice thing but it's Lord what can I do to find the channel to be pleasing to my Lord and a lot of people are confident to say I if I know my Lord is pleased with me then I don't need to seek the pleasing of everybody else as long as I have his approval can you say Amen so but there's something that burns within us for approval to be Smiled On and people will burn themselves out sometimes their whole life trying to get a person's approval sometimes it's his parents sometimes it's a dad it's amazing the extent that people go to their whole life and they're doing all of this to seek the approval of their father seek the approval of their mother they live their whole life doing it or a boss but then we must be honest and say sometimes that can disappoint you sometimes that's disappointing so this hunger that we have to be pleasing and things and and and might as well say it that some of our social media in fact I could safely say a lot of our social media is a platform to feed people who are craving for approval they always had it but social media brought it to a new level because now they take that hunger for approval and they put themselves out there and they're trying to impress what they're doing with their vacations or whatever they're doing and so all of it is is feeding I've got to have more likes today in order to function I've got to have more people approving of me and man if you get a whole host of people behind you it's feeding something within you but but our Prophet has warned us is that we shouldn't take a holy hunger of God and try to fulfill it through other things we have to take our hunger first to the Lord can I get an amen this morning if we have a hunger for approval if we have a hunger to be loved if we have a a thirst within us I've got to have this we should go to Christ first for that approval we should go to Christ first and this young people listen to me because you can go to everyone you can try to seek it in a boyfriend or girlfriend you can try to seek it in a in a new car but that hunger has to be filled first in our Lord Jesus Christ and then everything else seek ye first the kingdom of God and then all these things will be added to it everything else has worth and has value to it because you sought the Lord first he has to fill that hunger for love can you say Amen it's to be liked it's to be popular it's to be seen and so to have that approval come from God would probably be the ultimate approval to have Christ approval to have his he we're pleasing him uh wouldn't that be the ultimate approval is that we have the approval of God and I might add to you this morning that the scripture says that uh speaks of our approval our ultimate approval from from God actually does not come from us doing things that we were actually ultimate approved and accepted in the Beloved the Bible says we have been accepted in the Beloved young people say I'm doing all this because I want to be accepted they don't know they're doing it sometimes but they want to be accepted but as far as God's concerned when Christ went to Calvary and he became our sacrifice when God said I approve of that sacrifice when he approved of Christ he approved of you I need a bigger amen than that when he accepted the sacrifice he accepted you and if you'll receive him that's the ultimate approval is that you're not trying to do things because we don't gain entrance into heaven we don't gain salvation by anything that we do we receive the free gift of Salvation can I get an amen this is a free gift and if it means God's approval he didn't come down and say I've got to check you out a few years before I approve of you he checked out our sacrifice and he said it's perfect and when he approved Christ he approved [Applause] you so where do we draw this strength from we draw it because we don't want to get into this thing of earning earning ourselves but there's also a scripture that says grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption so so how do you explain that you explain it by saying we are sealed until the day of redemption the Holy Ghost is a seal in other words you don't get saved every year at Camp you don't get the Holy Ghost every year at Camp when you receive the true Holy Ghost it's a seal it seals God in your soul it seals the devil out can you say amen and you're sealed until when till next year's Camp no you're sealed until the day of our Redemption it is an ultimate sealing but why does he say grieve not the holy spirit because even with a person with the Holy Ghost can grieve the Lord now that doesn't tamper with the approval that I talked about but but we we can do things to grieve him and we can do things to please him and I'd say we want to have the the our heart to say I want to find the things that please the Lord can you say Amen sometimes we invent our own will and our own idea this if I go do this this will please the Lord you better make sure you know God gets blamed for a lot of stuff that was his will and it really wasn't his will because you're seeking approval from the Lord so you lay out the point plan and say this is a good plan I believe this will bring glory to the Lord and then all of a sudden all of a sudden you realize at the end of a certain time did it really please the Lord look for the characteristics of the scripture that please the Lord look for the value of life in the Bible and in the word in the message of the hour what value is instead of making up our own ideas I could preach a lot more about that but sometimes we invent our own ideas of what pleases the Lord a lot of times it's dos and don'ts a lot of times it's outward things and if I do this this will please the Lord but we really need to seek the word about that so sometimes things that please him though are different than what we think it was quite a surprise are you still with me here this morning it was quite a surprise to Martha that day when Jesus actually praised Mary for choosing to just sit and listen to him Martha didn't think there was no value in what Mary was doing you know the story if you don't I better tell it cuz you can't assume everybody knows it they got together at the house Martha is running around oh we've got the Lord here this is like a great thing we've got to do this what meal are we going to have and she's in and out of the kitchen just running around the recent uh one of the recent series on chosen shows it very well does that very well and she's just nervous on running around all this and Mary's sitting doing absolutely nothing and that's frustrating to uh Go Get It Go Get It Done type of person and she's putting value in serving and doing something for the Lord but no value in sitting and listening to the Lord see how we get our values messed up just like sitting here today you know what this to me and it's not because it's Paula Fontaine but when you bring your family and you sit and you shut everything else out and you say I want to sit I want what the Lord has to say to me for an hour and a half two hours 3 hours I'm not going to be that long but when you sit here and and say this has the most important value of the entire week above anything and Sunday is the first day of the week Sunday is only for worship it's only for rest it's only for Fellowship I set aside that day this has the highest value in my life what I could get in Revelation from the Lord has high value to it Martha didn't think so because she felt like doing something for the Lord has the greater value to it and she learned quite quite quick what Jesus was pleased with he was pleased with Mary thank you Martha for what you're doing I appreciate it but Mary has chosen the greater part today sometimes the greatest changes happen when you're sitting quietly obedient at his feet can you say Amen sometimes the greatest things can happen in quiet as you're sitting by yourself with your Bible and the message and could it be that the Lord after the whole week of doing everything else in your duties and what you have to do that you sit and you give the Lord an hour or two hours and you're praying and you're just it's undistracted time could it be the Lord smiles and is pleased with that above all the things that you're doing wow they're really they sent me a clear message that I'm first in their life the Lord and so now the greatest anointing I'm just to remind you the greatest anointing ever on a person was on Jesus and what did he do with the greatest anointing brother BR said he didn't run around the room shouting he sit and precious words proceeded out of his mouth that was a person with the greatest anointing on him that of ever any a human being Jesus had the greatest anointing and he sat quietly and precious words proceeded from his mouth if that's the greatest anointing we ought to be sitting and listening to that anointing we ought to see the value of listening to what Jesus is saying hallelujah so now a few months ago we were covering the seven things that God hates and even brother Steven TR is helping us with that uh the seven things that God and it was surprising to us to read in Proverbs the seven things that God hates we said well my we God hates this and God hates this and God hates smoking and drinking and drugs and God but you see when you come to those things it surprised us the things God really extremely hates sowing Discord among the Brethren it ended up being a lot of things that God hates that we didn't do so could it be the same way the same surprise as the things that please the Lord that they would be Sur surprises to in this age of adoption sons are really wanting to learn what pleases the Lord what really pleases the Lord adopted sons are sitting and saying Lord teach me what really pleases you because I want to live a life that pleases you in the adoption and the training of the son that's born in the family in that adoption process he puts him under a tutor all of his young years and so the tutor is training him and teaching him and then the tutor has to go back and give a report to the father how his son is doing oh he's rebellious he just won't listen he just he's he's got his own agenda and so what a terrible report to bring back to the father but then when he comes back and he can say he's matured he's listening he's applying the things he's you know what I can tell you in another year he's going to be trusted to entrust the entire Kingdom to him this is adoption because it's learning the things that please the Lord and when he came to Jesus adoption ceremony he come and what was the word heard from the Lord speaking there in the in in that mountain with Peter James and John what did he say this is my adoption now this is my son in whom I'm pleased that's right adoption is about pleasing the Lord but finding what really pleases him not our agenda what really pleases the Lord and so when we find out what a Grieves him then we stop those things and we find out what pleases him and there's just certain actions and there's just certain words that as we've been preaching on the third poll certain actions and words that can trigger moving the heart of God I want to be able to be in a position to say those things and do those action and you wouldn't even know it because God's invisible but sometimes then then we realize God was pleased with that decision God was pleased with one small things when someone takes a step towards the kingdom of God instead of stepping away from it sometimes when they take that step nobody hardly knows it but God knows it and he's pleased at every step you take towards the kingdom but when you see things in the word of God and they're not man's ideas but they are the word of God we offer up a heart God loves to see his children Embrace what they see in the word can you say Amen not out of Duty not out of law but this just because I love him and I want to serve him and I want to be pleased pleasing to my Lord so now uh you know I I want to take out of this 2 Chronicles a minute and uh it's it's something that I'm I'm actually doing double triple Duty studying here this week because we have the music conference coming up and we want to do a couple sessions there and we'll be talking about the purpose of worship and the power of worship and music in worship and so as I was reading along in the scriptures related to music I come across this 2 Chronicles 29 and and and so here it is is that when someone like this King becomes zealous to see uh that his house is defiled that the Lord's Temple is is defiled and they want to seek to cleanse it and to begin preparing it for the glory of God there's something about that in the scripture when a person said I see the house of the Lord it's not where it should be and I want to cleanse it and prepare it for God's glory this pleases the Lord but if you read your Bible if you're a Bible reader you read through this section of kings and it's it's very important to me because I see that God is making me a king and a priest through the word of God if we look at these years of Kings there were good Kings there were bad kings and this is outward worded at the very beginning of the scripture when he began to Reign whatever it was it says right away and he begin to rain at this age sometimes very young seven eight years old he begin to rain and then the next few verses say and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord but then there was another one that says he did that which is evil in the sight of the Lord so their hearts determined what they would do to bring heathenism back in and guess what got affected more than anything that really displeased God when they begin to turn their heart and didn't do what David said and what pleased the Lord when they made that choice guess what got affected the temple right the temple got affected eventually the temple and if you're affecting the temple to bring wrong things in the temple that's everything to God can you say Amen you know you can try to do a lot of things make a lot of decisions but when your temple is affected God is concerned your mind is part of your temple so this morning don't go away saying it's just the soul and all this no your mind is a part of your temple your spirit your emotions are a part of of this Temple and so something can enter in if your heart becomes blocked towards God and you get a little something in there what becomes affected you become affected your temple becomes affected now you can whatever you do to other people but when you get affected and you lose this purpose of being two things a temple of the Holy Ghost and a a House of Prayer that's the purpose of the temple a temple of the Holy ghosts and a House of Prayer your prayers need to be affected in your temple so that you can get a hold of God how many times I've been preaching it in this hour our prayer is the most effective thing right now because we may not have the answer to a lot of problems but when I go to pray I want my prayer to make it through to heaven and this was the temple it was a house of prayer that was the purpose you're to be a House of Prayer you're to have a purpose and anything that squatches that freedom to pray and that Faith to pray and that that freedom to worship freely in this Temple God is not pleased so you can hide it all you want to but we've got to have people rise to the occasion only eight Kings out of 42 were the ones that said I want to cleanse the temple I want everybody to sanctify themselves and I want to sanctify the temple we're going to begin going cleaning house we're going to clean everything else El that's wrong because the temple is important to me we need young people we need people to rise there are very few to say this Temple is important to God so it's important to me I don't just let everything come in my mind I don't just let any song come into my spirit I don't just watch any movie that's out there I am picky why because this is the Temple of the Holy Ghost somebody ought to shout amen thank you for watching our service today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall life. church
