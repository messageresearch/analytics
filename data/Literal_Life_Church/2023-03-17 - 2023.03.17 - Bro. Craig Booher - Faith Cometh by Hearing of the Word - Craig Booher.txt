TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's go to Romans chapter 10 very familiar scripture to us Romans chapter 10 thank you musician musicians just just feel like I just walked into a real welcome Spirit here Romans chapter 10. and we want to start with verse 8. everybody find your places but what saith it the word is neither even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and Shout believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shall be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek and for the same Lord over all is Rich until all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved and how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him whom they have not hurt and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah says the Lord who hath believed Lord who hath believed our report here it is so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God but I say have they have they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the Earth and the words unto the ends of the world I want to preach tonight a message on faith cometh by hearing the word of God may God bless us the reading of his word you all can have your seats this evening thank you brother Branham he preaches a principle that I think is incredible I just don't see anyone in the world that that preaches on it he in the way that he preached on it he said that God Lots his word a portion of that word to every age that in God's Great economy and God's Great mind that he brings his word to the Earth but brother random said only so much of that word is fulfilled in a generation in every generation so God Lots his word I think that's an incredible thought he Lots his word and he he in other words he takes a portion of that word and he manifests it in every age and so he sometimes will come through a prophet and he'll send it down through a prophet and the prophet will catch thus saith the Lord and he'll manifest that word to that age and then we've seen that God manifesting himself in in Noah or God manifested in Elijah God manifested in Moses or Jeremiah and then when the word comes to that age and it's interpreted it's manifested he makes that word live for that age he takes the words off the pages and he makes it material he makes it manifest so it was God in Noah God in Moses god in Abraham God in Joshua God and David God all the way and it is the predestinated that catch it when God reveals a portion of his word to that age the predestinated catch it Hallelujah do you love the Lord he said the spirit the spirit filled of that age he said catch the Revelation for that age and so but now faith comes by hearing the word of the Lord and brother Branham said now Faith is not a loose thing he said it's based on something he said you've got to know something about what you are having faith in before you can have faith in it he said so we we first must know what is God's desire what is God's plan and his approach to that plan then we can walk boldly to the throne of grace and we can plead what God has promised hey that's solid that is that's the way we can get something from the Lord that we must know what God's desire is what his plan is and how we are to approach that plan faith comes by hearing the word of almighty God now that word hearing means to understand a carnal man can't understand the things of God neither a man that is not born by the spirit but here means he that he said that Faith cometh by understanding faith comes by spiritual revelation understand means to apprehend the meaning or the intention of it means to comprehend to get a comprehension so if we need in order to have faith and to see God move upon the different needs that we have then we must be able to hear with us spiritual ear which means to understand what we're hearing so it's not just a casual observation but it is a spiritual grasp and a and a taking a hold of Hallelujah praise the Lord and an apprehending of what we are trying to get so it's just like brother Brennan had said that Paul Paul was not in the upper room Paul was an enemy to the church and then God met him on the road to Damascus and God did not send Paul to the bishop Peter to get taught in Apostolic Doctrine but God moved him to Arabia and by divine revelation revealed the gospel that he revealed to Peter to Paul so when Paul met Peter brethrenham said they saw I too I in Doctrine it was not the teaching of manner indoctrination of man it was the revelation of Jesus Christ that's why Paul said I did not receive this of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ so when we hear the word of God we need it to be revealed by the author the author that wrote the word must reveal the word to every individual to our young people to our old people to our needy people the spirit wants to reveal himself and he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit is speaking to the churches it was Paul that said I pray for you and desire that you might be filled with all knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding how many could use that tonight another place Paul said I cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ and the father of Glory may give you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him that the eyes of your understanding would be enlightened that you may know what is the hope of his calling what is the riches of his glory and The Inheritance in the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards us word who believe do we believe tonight Hallelujah so before we can ever receive from God we have to get into the spirit of God and then the spirit begins to show us things it is a work of the Holy Spirit he that has an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit is saying we need to be in the spirit to understand what he he wants to break it to us he wants to reveal himself to us he wants to take us up higher how many can say Amen and you say well you know look at John you know John is is walking around with the Lord he lived with him he knew his mannerisms he knew his ways he he was in his bosom he was in the Inner Circle what a relationship John had but in the Book of Revelation John did not understand that the lamb had to take the book he saw the book and and he wept because there was no man and he saw the lamb coming and he told him don't weep John for the lion has prevailed to open the book and when he opened it he shouted and he he came to an understanding that he did not know in the flesh he came to a deeper understanding sometimes we say I cut my teeth on a message pure I know all the quotes but the Lord wants to pull back his word and reveal it to us there are deeper places in God we've got to break out of a know-it-all mentality and we've got to say Lord my heart is hungry for you to manifest yourself in me surely there's more surely show me things I've never seen before it's our mindset limit us amen when you get down to the bottom you'll find unbelief limits us Beyond ahead knowledge it's a heart knowledge Hallelujah it is a work of the Holy Spirit brother said millions hear the words but do they pay heed to them he said but who will lend in here and and want to know the words of truth he said and we'll find the spirit of God will Enlighten him if your ear is open to the word the spirit of God will make that word real to you what a meaning this could be what a meaning this could be if we could get out of the buzz of all the distractions if we could break away from all the worries and say Lord take me into your power Lord if I need correction to give me my correction let me rise higher how many say Lord that's my prayer everything has to work together the church has to pray the laity has to pray we all come together and pray and it brings us into the presence of God Hallelujah in the first Exodus the Bible said when the time of the promise Drew night when the time of the promised junai which God swore to Abraham then God began to move upon the scene when the time of that word to be fulfilled and when the time of that word was to be fulfilled the spirit of God began to move and God will choose predestinated people to help bring that word into fruition because God does nothing but he reveals it through Believers he he comes to Believers in other words brother random said if God is going to manifest a certain word he will predestinated Believers for that age to receive that word to catch that word and so when God was going to fulfill his word he had an amram and a jock a bit that was there to receive because they believed and brother Ritter said when the time came for God to fulfill his own word uh and amram and jochebed begun to to have a burden for they knew according to the prophecy we're about ready to get out of here and they started praying in the will of God they knew it was the will of God the plan of God and they were a part of that plan and God moved upon them to start praying in a certain way Hallelujah it's amazing have you ever thought how that how in the world Moses being raised in the Egyptian schools how did he escape the indoctrination of Egypt and brother Branham actually alludes to that thought he said how in the world did he escape the indoctrination as they taught him Egyptian ways and taught him the way and and brother Branham said how this happened what defused the indoctrination of Egypt upon the life of Moses was a mother who nursed him and raised him on her lap and she said Moses you are a chosen one of Gods God's hand is on you you're different than other boys you're raised for a purpose and you are going to deliver God's people and faith comes by hearing faith comes by hearing the word of God he believed his mother's words it had an effect upon him oh yeah he had his ups and downs and he had his Hall of mistakes like all of us do but still God's word will prevail Hallelujah Moses you are trolls of the Lord now the word of God produces faith there were several prophecies where God had told Moses after 400 years I will bring you out with a mighty hand and then Joseph said surely God will visit you you'll take my bones out God's good for his word in me and so Israel when they came under the cruel bondage they began to cry for deliverance now what made God hear them as they were praying according to the program of God they were praying in the will of God and faith comes by hearing if you want to be healed it's because there is healing for you they wanted Deliverance because there was Deliverance for them and they began to pray in the will of God lord deliver your people Lord get us out of here above all circumstances against the greatest militaries Against All Odds God deliver your people Hallelujah and brother random said now you're praying something he said they were crying in the will of God and God had to provide what he promised if you're praying for something out of the will of God you cannot have faith see but they were right in the will of God Hallelujah so we must understand the will of God in order to have faith you've got to understand the word of God the message that God has sent to us the Bible said be not unwise Ephesians 5 17 be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is I don't think it's a time that we be casual I say this you know respectfully I I've talked to people that got good memorization but as shallow as shallow can be can tell you the quotes and quote to you but a shallow is shallow can be we need understanding from our hearts understanding what the will of God is furthermore understanding what the will of God is for our own individual lives how many would like that Lord I would like to understand my part in your great Plan of Redemption you know Elijah had marched right up into the face of Ahab and stuck his finger in his face and said it'll not rain until I call for it brother Branham said he did not stutter now you're talking about the king now you walk right up stuck his finger right at the end of his nose and said it is not going to rain until I call for it he said he knew where he was standing because he had thus saith the Lord see real Faith takes the fear away and that is based upon the word of God and Elijah now prayed and the Bible tells us he prayed and it rained not for the space of three and a half years he said he literally closed the heavens now this is amazing he said now why would a man pray that God would close the heavens he said people are starving people or he said but he knew the will of God he said the people had to repent God wanted them to repent so God shot the heavens not to destroy the people but to bring them back to the word of God [Applause] so the prophet he comes into alignment understanding the will of God praise the will of God shuts the heavens and this is not a man that was an angel he was a man subject to like passions like you and me he was a man with ups and downs but he caught the will of God and when he caught the will of God he prayed the will of God and he shot the heavens the Bible said the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and he Compares any of us to Elijah that could shut the heavens there is power in your prayers but you must know the will of God you must understand what God wants from you [Applause] more than coming to church more than letting the preacher preach a sermon but I am going to be a part of God's word made manifest I have a part you have a part we need to create an atmosphere where God can come down and bring his word to fruition Hallelujah Hallelujah I'll say it as simple as brother Branham said it faith is the revelation of the will of God faith comes by hearing the word of God now brother Branham said that this word is a road map to power to the power of God but we also know power without character is satanic so God just can't throw power out to people because we'd be zapping everyone that disagreed with our Doctrine so brother random said that's why we he gives it out so sparingly but brother Branham said that word and I'm quoting verbatim out of unfailing realities of God this word will lead you to power now why in the world would brother Branham tell us that because you know Wicked and adulterous Generations sign Seekers and why would he you know put Power why would we want power I mean we're too humble for that because we need power we need power to drive the enemy off our promises we need power in our church for our young people to to see that God is alive and that he answers prayer and there is nothing too hard for God how many can say Amen now brother Branham said that he had traveled the nation so much he said I found it astounding I told my wife he said now I can tell anybody uh what road to take to maybe let's just use California he said and I could tell them how much time it'll take them to get there within 15 minutes whether it be Florida whether it be Missouri whether it be Louisiana I can tell them he said because I have done it so much he said I just know it I understand it I I've experienced it he said that's why God wants us to know his word he said he wants us to know it inside and out and and be so versed with it to know that in my name you will cast out devils and it works and the prayer Faith Works now he said that word he said you that word will lead you to power he said that's the way God wants us to know his word we have just traveled in it we've tried it he said no his map is the Bible and the Bible is the road map that leads to his power he said faith leads you to power power produces the promise okay so God can't give power to those that are operating in their own will but God gives power to those that are operating in his will who is representing his kingdom and fighting to establish his kingdom amen so faith in the word of God leads us to power and that power produces God's promise Hallelujah now brother Branham said in first John chapter 5 verse 14 in the Pro gaming age he said this is the confidence that we have in him if we ask anything say anything if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us whoa if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us I know the devil tells you that your prayers don't go beyond that ceiling and and scarcely gets a foot over your head but the Bible said he does he said now we ask what is the will of God he said there is only one way to know the will of God that is by the word of God there it is if it's not the word you cannot have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word Hallelujah now here's a word for you God is not willing that any would perish but that all would come to repentance that is the will of God there is no one here that God Wills to be lost God Wills every one of us to be saved God will for us to be healed God will for us to be filled God Wills for us to live in Christian victory that includes you do you know when Jesus died on the cross he died for every person on the face of the Earth front words and backwards it is nothing you have done or I it is the gift of God everything in the Old Testament pointed to Calvary every Prophet everyone everything pointed there and everyone can be saved everyone can be healed now I know Redemption we know that there's an economy of God and Redemption are those that were in his mind before the foundations of the world and redeemed as a person a certain class but everyone can be saved that wants to be saved brother Branham said Redemption the word Redemption which means to bring back pertains only to the elect we understand that but anyone can be saved God not willing that any he is not a man that he should lie not willing that any would perish he looked at Cain and said if you do what your brother does I will receive you serpent seat but how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent see the preacher's job is easy in one sense because all he's supposed to do is point you to Calvary because Calvary is where you get over sugar diabetes Calvary is where you overcome depression Calvary is where you cast down nervous devils Calvary is where you overcome homosexuality Avery is where you overcome yourself [Applause] it is the cure to the human sickness and every preacher ought to be pointing to Calvary there is your salvation there is your Victory there is your healing there is your joy brother Adam said as I look across the nation going Beyond this Camp 1964. he said I'm fully persuaded that the people are not getting to Christ I believe it's the enemy that's brought the hindrance because the reason I believe this is he is not the object that they are pointing to do you know Doctrine does not save you [Music] Doctrine what you believe cannot save you who you believe does Hallelujah brother Branham said I'm afraid they're appointing he said to a Doctrine to a Dogma to a party to a sensation instead of pointing them to Christ the word [Applause] Hallelujah but God's program will forever be the blood from the time of the Garden of Eden down through the Exodus down Through the Ages God's program is the blood they've tried to educate it and denominated and make it a philosophy it is an experience that every one of us can feel received tonight the blood of Jesus Christ does not discriminate it's for the white man for the black man [Music] is for the Catholic it is for the Presbyterian it is for the methodists Hallelujah brother Branham said notice in the discernments the angel not one time ever said what church you belong to [Applause] if they were catholic he healed them if they were Baptists he healed them if they were women preachers he healed them [Applause] one blood for all nations one blood for all Races Hallelujah and it can free anyone from sin Hallelujah we believe in healing lines but the real healing line is Calvary we need to be lined up under Calvary and God let God let your spirit go to Every sick person in the sound of my voice by his stripes your heels Hallelujah he said we're only trying to get them to look to the man that already healed him and to get them to accept that by faith I believe every sick person was healed when Jesus died at Calvary there are no great ones Among Us healing does not come from a man healing comes from your faith in a finished work James said how can you have faith when you respect one another and when you when you have a respect of persons when we are all children of one father how can you have faith when you're looking to men and looking at the wrong place you must Center your faith on Calvary Paul did it Peter did it Mary had a shout and fit Mary had to do the same thing any man that ever reaches heaven will have to have his own personal revelation in the cross of calvary without any prejudice without any account of rank wealth personal friendship or popularity he has no respecter of persons God does not care about persons Hallelujah praise the Lord so when the preacher comes with the word of God he begins to preach to you you can be healed it's God's perfect will to heal you how did Brother Brennan get those results he didn't go through personal interviews and say well God can't I used to wonder that as a young man how there could be 20 000 people there and they receive their healing instantaneous because healing is for all how many believe that say Amen now all the preacher does is he comes with the word and shows you the will of God he's gifted to do it that way So Divine Healing is for everyone and the preacher is to preach the promises of God we are to preach the nature the unchanging nature of God if he was a Healer he'll always be a Healer and that his attitude cannot change if he did it for the woman with the blood issue he can do it for you if he did it for the thief on the cross he'll do it for you it is the unchanging attitude and nature of almighty God we must understand what Calvary done for us we must understand the principles of Faith healing and deliverance and there are principles that we must approach God by faith comes by hearing the word of God in other words spiritual understanding is revelation Revelation comes by hearing everybody get it so brother Branham talked about uh Samson contrary to you know the Sunday School pictures you know Samson is always ripped and you know spinning a lion on his finger brother Benham said now there would have been no mystery there because the whole story was they were trying to find the mystery but God did not choose a muscle-bound man brother Branham said he was a curly-headed little shrimp now we know the nature of God if we could take an entire sermon on the nature of God to say why he chose a curly-headed little shrimp see it had nothing to do with Man's power see God wanted the glory out of this and you know men are proud creatures that love to share the glory of God but God will share his glory with no one so he chooses a man they'll say I just don't know how he does it unless you knew his God then you could understand it so brother Brandon said now Samson was the curly-headed little shrimp he said but then when he got in trouble the spirit of God would come upon him and he said whether it was a lion he would rip it apart with his bare hands he said not because he was strong but because he had thus saith the Lord see he knew the will of God he knew he was put on Earth with a purpose to deliver the people of Israel and whether it was a lion or a thousand Philistines or whatever the enemy it was going to crumble and fall because he had a revelation of the will of God now Samson is not a man that I would have chose Samson got in trouble he had woman trouble and I I honestly think out of all the characters of the Bible I say oh my he goes into harlot's house he's he's always getting in trouble and I said Lord how the Lord in these things is speaking to us and then brother Branham answered the minute the the mystery even coming out of a harlot's house he lifts the gates of Gaza under the power of God how in the world is this working is because God was not looking at Samson he was looking at Seven Locks which represented his promise and God was not obligated to Samson he was obligated to the Covenant that he made with Samson and when God gave a covenant to Abraham no matter what Abraham done God sold himself into that promise and God made a promise he'll have a church without spots without wrinkle he has tied himself is obligated to bring forth his words no matter what we look like he is obligated to the message oh yeah Hallelujah Samson actually represented us studied in in the message you'll find Samson represented the bride now God's looking at Samson and as long as God could see the cover remember it grew back I will restore saith the Lord as long as that Covenant was there he could claim any promise and I think we could do it tonight I'm gonna claim him as my healer I'm going to claim the Holy Spirit I'm going to claim victory over this enemy [Applause] God's gonna give it to me because it ain't based upon my ups and downs it is based upon the unmoving rock of the revelation of God's word and Faith cometh the hearing hearing the word of God lord Let It Go a song you wrote past my ears to my over my head to my heart how many would like that in these meetings maybe sickness is holding you maybe an enemy is holding maybe there's a place you can't move over God will be looking down from heaven you need to tear into it and run it to Pieces by the power of God you don't have to live under your god-given privileges it is revelation that gives us Authority over the devil is that what the prophet said it is the river now Faith or Revelation comes by hearing the word the will of God and it is the revelation of God that gives us Authority over the devil now brother random said that's where eternal life Lays is knowing him personally yourself know his nature know what he does how he acts and when you do that you'll have a knowledge of his word and what he wants you to do see there's where Faith Comes you cannot step halfway thinking he might do it or maybe perhaps he will you've got to know exactly his will and you've got to believe it with all your heart [Applause] that's why God sent us a message that cannot be disputed because in order to have faith you have to have something perfect to have faith in because you and I are the moving object the God's word is the anchor to the soul so God gave us the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication to eliminate all questions so now we would know the perfect will of God in this hour and now we could begin to operate in the will of God which will bring us to power [Applause] which will produce the word there will be a resurrection you know Mary when she said beat unto me according to Thy word that God used a 15 year old girl to bring Redemption to the entire Earth he used the faith of a 15 year old any 15 year olds in here raise your hand anybody higher brother raise your hand couple he used the faith of a 15 year old child to redeem you and me to bring he used her faith be it unto me this is the way God works so brother Branham said there is a great enemy of faith scary he said the great enemy of faith is little timid hope he said the greatest enemy faith has is Hope because when a person is hopeful he said they actually leave faith he said now hope agrees with the Bible and he said hope believes the word of God and he said hope believes all of that but says look at my condition he said now Faith doesn't look at any condition faith comes and said I don't care about conditions God said so it's mine and he said that Faith actually flexes its muscles he said now hope looks for something way off but Faith claims it right now [Applause] he said hope expects it'll get better one day and he said as long as the devil can make you look off to another day that's as good as he wants he said but Faith takes the challenge right now and faith comes by hearing the word of God I'm not going to wait till tomorrow I'm going to believe God right now [Applause] Hallelujah he said Faith wands up its muscles but hope is passive he said hope is not active it's a bystander Hallelujah I I love history and I was doing a study on Alexander dowey and you know brother Branham spoke of Alexander dally and as I broke into his histories I was absolutely amazed thousands times thousands was healed thousands he was he came in the 1920s actually he was in the 1800s but he he lasted to the 1920s and great leaders like FF Bosworth and John G Lake and many of the great leaders and healing revivalists of the 20s came out from under him but how he came about Divine Healing which was lost in the ages the Bubonic plague had struck Australia in 1875 and I just asked that you bear with me I don't even have a clue what time it is praise the Lord thank you Bubonic plague 1875 had struck Sydney Australia and he reseted that his heart was Heavy because he had been visiting about 30 beds of the dying his flock that was dying and he had buried about 40 of them and he said that that as he cried out to God where is the god of the Bible that heals he said no prayer would reach his ear and he would cry and said Lord your arm is not shortened that you cannot say be saved he said but no matter what he said he couldn't turn the tide and he said this was not bad people he said these were strong Christians that were dying and leaving widows and leaving orphans and and he can do nothing about it and he said he felt like the enemy was just mocking as he would visit and try to encourage the people that lost their loved ones and he and he said he was he had his head hands in his head his head in his hands and he was like Lord you know what what is happening he said you've got to speak to me and he's praying and he's crying and as he's crying the lord gave him one verse in Acts chapter 10 verse 38 it he says that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power who went about doing good healing all that was oppressed of the devil and at that moment he realized oh the devil is the defiler and Christ is the Healer and it came from God he just saw that distinction that it was not sickness was not the will of God but it was The Offspring of Satan and he said is this is he thought he goes he all the sudden when that one verse came the door of healing opened wide and he said at that moment a knock came at the door and they they came in and said Mary is dying Pastor you've got to come to Mary and so he grabbed his hat and cloak and he rushed down to see the little girl and when he got to her bed she was groaning and grinding and clenching her teeth she was in total Agony blood and froth was coming from her mouth she was distorted in pain and he said as he looked at her his anger became and it began to grow toward it and he said oh Lord if you would give me a sharp sword to cut the serpent that's destroying this young child's life and he said there was a doctor there and the doctor was trying to comfort the mother the doctor looked over it uh Alexander dowey and said it does not God work in mysterious ways he said this is not the work of God he said this is the work of the devil [Music] and the the doctor was offended turned on his heels and and went out and he said he looked at it he became angry beyond description and he said he was looking at it and said this is not God's way he said this is not the will of God because Jesus healed all say all there was a press of the devil and so we looked at the mother and said why did you call for me she said I thought you could help he said we can help we can pray and he said so he prayed and he said it wasn't even eloquent but he began to pray and call upon God and quote the scripture you're the Healer of all of our diseases and and by your strengths we are healed and he prays and he said as he prayed he felt something come upon it and he said she's healed they came out of prayer and she is Motionless and the mother said is she dead he said no she's not dead she sleeps as a young babe would sleep he snapped his finger and opened her eyes and she sat up in bed and was completely healed now that was always in the word but God gave him a revelation by the word and Revelation comes by hearing the word of God which brought power which brought forth the promise of God and I want to say tonight it is so important that we know our enemy he has come to kill and to still and to destroy and the nature of the devil does not change like God's nature does not change and the devil will always put you in a prison house and the will always bind your joy the devil will always make you critical and tie you up but God will set you free [Applause] Hallelujah it is the devil that puts unbondage it is the devil that makes you sick it's the devil that brings confusion it is the devil that breaks the word of God [Applause] Satan is the enemy of the human race for this purpose Jesus was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil [Applause] sickness is a work of the devil diabetes is a work of the devil high blood pressure is a work of the devil the Bible said Jesus came out and said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliver it say Deliverance to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of the sight of the Blind and the Senate Liberty them that are bruised the Bible said Jesus healed all manner of sickness and he healed all that was oppressed of the devil and every time he went to a funeral he broke up the funeral he would raise the dead because he was destroying the works of the devil he healed the eyes of the blind he brought the tormented back to a normal State because he was destroying the works of the devil Jesus said as the father sent me so send I you and he commanded his disciples to cast out devils and to heal the sick because the ministry of Jesus Christ continues in the body of Christ if Jesus was to destroy the works of the devil then his body does the same thing our preaching should be to tear down the strongholds of the enemy our preaching should there be combat sickness and to set the captive free are we Believers here tonight the preaching of the Gospel is to turn over the devil's Kingdom to cast out the evil one to destroy sickness to destroy depression to destroy complexes to destroy the enemy and you need to start in your seat right now devil you have no power over me I will not cry another tear I will not take another beating Christ is my deliverer Christ is my joy Christ is my peace faith comes by hearing the word of God are you a believer in the word of the Lord Satan is a brother Branham said Satan is afraid say afraid he is afraid of the blood of Jesus Christ what what I thought we're the ones that are supposed to be trembling do you know that the devil is afraid of what you have clothed yourself in a Blood Washed Church brother random said he is afraid of it God came down and proved that no sickness could stand it was not William Branham he was a preacher pointing to Calvary and it worked now did you know that just as Moses was given a command to deliver the people that the church is commanded to deliver God's people that's exactly right and he told the disciples when you enter into the city Open the Eyes of the blind cleanse the leper freely you have received freely give you will tread upon the head of serpents is that what he said you will tread upon the heads of serpent and nothing shall stand before you faith comes by hearing the word of God faith is a direct revelation of God faith is the substance of things hoped for not timid hope but we actually possess the possession of what hope is looking for faith is not a peacemaker Hallelujah brother Branham said now if you believe it you will see the glory of God that's what he told Martha his her brother's Dead four days he said if you will believe you will see the glory of almighty God and brother Branham said this he said now Faith overcome death faith is the victory over death faith is the victory over sin faith is the victory over sickness faith is the victory over worry faith is the victory over frustrations faith is the victory that overcometh the world he said not a floating faith but a real faith faith is not a peacemaker hmm how may say Lord Give Me Faith he said Faith overcomes he said faith is a conqueror it conquers conquering Victory is the same conquer means to beat down to override to handcuff and to throw in prison it means the sin that ruled you now you rule it Hallelujah do you love the Lord brother Branham said if it's against the word it's your enemy that's that's strong anything that is not the word is your enemy now now Joshua overcome the Wilderness by faith he overcome every Temptation by faith and when they arrived to the promised land God said now it's yours but you've got to go take it so their job was no matter how big the giant no matter how big the wild cities their job was to take a step of faith and these weren't Warriors these were people traveling through the desert but because God was looking at the commission and they were willing to step out on that commission God was obligated to defend them so now all they had to do if the Giants had would reach the lights is take your sword and just and God would go start getting a little more confidence will be they're just Fallen even before he hits him he just foreign that's right brother Branham said before they could get to the line they would raise up and be healed but you got to have faith this ain't a hope so this ain't timid hope this is Faith faith comes by hearing the word of God brother Brennan said the very faith that you move your finger with is the very faith that performs Miracles we don't need a lot of faith we just need to know what God wants us to do with our faith [Applause] everyone here has plenty of faith but God wants us to utterly destroy take no prisoners do not bow to devils that's what he said do not bow to them don't even speak of them you will not run but your enemies will flee before you you will not bow you will not murmur or complain but the shout of the king is in the camp [Music] praise the Lord I think we ought to have a little righteous indignation did you know the Bible says to abhor that which is evil it means a holy anger do you know the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee how many believe that here tonight the Bible says give no place to the devil I want you to look at shamgar can I I have no idea what time it is can I go a little further yeah you know shamgar we know the story so well and brother Branham talked about him making his grain silos and bringing in his Harvest and and what a proud man he was and then the enemy said you know we're going to take what shamgar has we're going to take it so uh shamgar sees them coming down the road Trump and they they start taking his corn and he said please don't please don't take my well a little don't take it all could you leave some no we're going to take the wheat and we're going to take your chickens and I like eggs so I'm going to take your eggs and your milk cow don't take my milk cow please have mercy Mr devil don't take my milk cow and he took every bit of it before he left he grabbed shamgar by the face and he just pushed him down on the ground and everyone gave him a swift kick on their March out well maybe this next camp meeting the devil will leave me alone next year come along and he's ready for a good camp meeting and Trump Trump trump here he comes oh who now he's shaking oh no they didn't forget where the camp meeting was Trump trump they probably faced him down to the ground and they steal his chickens and three camps go by pretty soon when he comes to Camp there's there's just no joy at all it's sitting in the back just been in the message all my life it just don't work for me and God is sitting there going how long are you going to take this man and you know this is amazing part brother Branham said one day they came in and shamgar was not looking at them he looked at his wife and she's drawn up he looked at his kids and said you know what my loss is actually affecting my whole family my defeats is affecting the faith of my children and my wife how are they going to have confidence in the God that I serve and admitted he thought that the Holy Spirit gave him a slap on the back right man who are you I'm an Israelite we're different than every other nation in the world if I was just an Israelite that'd be one thing but we are the people of God and the Holy Spirit slaps him on the back again and furthermore I am a circumcised child of Abraham and the Holy Spirit slaps him on the back sometimes we've got to encourage ourselves in the Lord I am a believer I am an overcomer God has called me with a Divine Purpose in my life pretty soon brother said if you don't believe it say it until you believe it we ought to have a positive confession and as he said it he just felt an unction of strength and he said I'm sick and tired of it brother said we need righteous indignation we need to have a right that the devil is our enemy and God commissioned us to destroy the works of the devil and so he just looked around and he grabbed the first thing and think about it he's overcome and he just starts walking out to 600 men and they're laughing and then they're like he's serious and they're like laughing until he goes boom and a head goes over the moon and they're like dear God he's is this shamgar and they started dropping like flies God wants us just to have a little faith in it God wants us to quit sitting there just just relishing in our failure realistic in our in our inability instead of looking to God it's like God you promised me that I would be the header not to tell and my enemies will turn their backs Lord you promise me healing Lord you promise me Deliverance Lord you promised me that no enemy would stand before me you promised me a holy ghost reviver you promised where we would meet you would be there you promised me Devils would flee [Applause] it's your promise Lord we are born again of the spirit of God the circumcised children of Abraham and I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired you told me I could have my backslidden husband you told me I could claim my children [Applause] you pulled me Lord [Applause] I'm not just a denomination I'm the elected bride of Jesus Christ and I know what you want done with your words May the spirit of God begin to move pick up your Ox goat make the devil nervous get a fighting spirit in there Caleb got your Ox goat tell the devil he was defeated at Calvary tell him you're not taking it no more [Applause] Faith rise up the devil you Bluff long enough my Lord crushed your backbone all you have is words and I'm gonna shut your mouth tonight not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord but you've got to get tired of being pushed around you got to get tired of losing you got to get tired of living under your god-given privileges Hallelujah health when he began to think like that the Holy Spirit come upon him would he began to talk like that the Holy Spirit come upon him when we begin to believe like that the Holy Spirit comes upon us God give us a backbone God give us a faith in the word that you have sent us you have healing claim it you have your loved ones claim it [Applause] who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed brother Branham said in the Sixth Seal that the arm of the Lord was represented by the right hand of God the power of God who hath believed the report of the Gospel you know that's the first verse of Isaiah 53 that he was wounded for our transgressions by his stripes we are healed who has believed that report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed the arm of the Lord is revealed to them that believe his report the power of God is available to them that will believe him faith comes by hearing the word of God and when the Believers believed in The Exodus the arm of God stretched forth and released two million of them the very arm of God that released two million Jews can release you of your suffering the blood of the Lamb of woolly lamb in The Exodus released two million Believers what will the blood of God do and I'm asking you who has believed his report it's a question who has believed his report and to whom is the power of God revealed and in other words who is the word of God manifested to healing power lays in Calvary deliverance and freedom lays in Calvary did you know brother Branham said God is just as obligated to heal you as he is to save you a statement that is just as much the will of God to heal your body Christ's attitude is the same you say well I'm battling with unbelief the blood of Jesus Christ kills unbelief so brother Branham said he said they killed the very source and when Jesus died for our he or was opened his wombs his wounds for healing he was not just physical healing many times as we get older we need physical healing and and the young people can't even touch that they can't grasp that yet but it went deeper into the spirit Realm that God can actually there are children that live under terrible circumstances abused and can never speak about it and God knows all about it there is a blood that can come and heal those wounds and those injustices and those wicked things there's a blood that can go in where you have defiled your mind and spirit with pornography he can heal it and make you a gentleman he can go down into your fears and begin to pull your fears out by his stripes I am healed brother Branham said he went to the whipping post and as the Roman soldier took the cat of nine tails he said it just ripped the hide right off his back and they laughed earn chunks of meat is being pulled off he was those stripes that healed you Struck it and it was for you it was for me it was not advanced in vain and so powerful is the healing of God it'll go down into your spirit begin to take a confused mind and turn it and make a man out of it goes down into the sinful Soul the corrupted crooked soul and he straightens it back up again he makes the Crooked pass straight again [Applause] by his stripes who has believed his report he could take a heart make a man out of him make a lady out of it he goes down into the physical Realms the spiritual Realms and even into the very heart and there is healing for every row here tonight for those out on the stream there is healing those that were rejected those that can overcome the complex those that were hurt those that were done wrongfully but you know Jesus was done wrong he came out of Nazareth nothing good comes out of Nazareth he was given a black name and he's born with peasants he never had a real chance in life but you know he never used it as an excuse because our light shines brightest in the Darkness and your faith is like the light of God that runs the devil away and he did not complain he shined his light that God's Great Paradox that he out of Nazareth would come forth the Redeemer what about Toledo what about Lima what about your corner of the Earth that God would reach down to a person never had an opportunity God's given you one have you believed his report God's given you an opportunity he's given us an opportunity every one of us have dealt with hurts rejections deep unspeakable pain but I am the Lord I believe there's enough faith in here to start a Revival that won't quit to the coming of the Lord are you a Believer here you've got a claim you've got to step up and say I am a believer I'm a shamgar I don't have much in Ox Gall goat is all I need it's enough to whip the devil your little bit of faith is enough to whip the devil to claim your healing to claim your joy to get out of that situation that you're in for God to send an answer here this weekend and turn the whole course of your life to make you useful in the Kingdom not to give you a nice career so you go backslide but to do something for the kingdom of God [Applause] let the weak say I'm strong let the poor say that I'm rich how many believers do we have here we must understand what God wants done with his word and what he wants you to do is quit sitting there with passive hope he wants you to take him at his word draw your sword pick up your Ox goat grab your jaw and go to swinging at the Devil for your job in this life is to destroy the works of the devil the work of this church is one thing to destroy the works of the devil To Shine the Light to preach his word to sing the songs of Zion to raise the banner to lift the cross to shout to him [Applause] God wants an army say I need more than what I got he has more for us brother Branham said a real Revival is and we love to shout he said that's not a real Revival he said a real Revival is when you tear down the sheds and go to praying and getting right with God brother Branham said there's too much lack of sincerity and he tied sincerity with repentance the old-fashioned repentant meetings you say Lord I failed you I've made excuses I've been a coward I'm just going to call it what it is Lord I've been a coward I'm not gonna hide behind a fig leaf I'm going to step out and say Lord I'm sorry I want something different brother Branham was going to run off into the Wilderness and the Lord rebuked him and said you keep going on with your plans and you'll end up a bum he said Lord I don't want that I want something different and the Lord said I have you've got more gifts than that of Moses every one of us we need to have a conference with God and I believe if we will be pure in our hearts and really lay our hearts out before the Lord and say Lord I want what your will is I want your word and I'm not going to be afraid but I'm going to yield myself and let you use me the way you see fit I'm not going to be scared to step out I'm going to quit listening to all of the the Mind battles and I'm gonna step out and I'm gonna do something for you Lord I'm going to yield myself I am not going to be bound by this anymore how many say Lord that's my prayer I want to see the Holy Spirit come into my home and and Lord bring a Revival in my home I don't want to just appear like I'm religious I really want the Life of Christ in my children and my wife and in my husband I want to live in my home what I live here Lord I want to give it all as the musicians will make their way Lord I want to give it all and I just want you to search your hearts this is we're just preaching on faith tonight and in these meetings there's nothing pre-planned we just opening our hearts to the Holy Spirit and say Lord you come in you speak to me your nose are as good as your yeses you have a plan beyond my understanding I'm not demand I don't have an attitude I'm not demanding that you do it my way but Lord I'm gonna trust you how many will trust the Lord and Lord I want to go back and I want to lay it open I want to be pure and I want to set an atmosphere that your Holy Spirit can come in here and do beyond what we can imagine and Lord I'm going to do my part in this meeting if that's your desire raise your hand just lift it before the Lord Lord I'm going to do my part I'm going to search I'm going to pour my heart I'm going to come in with sincerity Lord forgive me of my wrongs whatever's on your heart brother whatever's whatever's on your heart something reverent something sweet and this is you and God now and I think it'd be good just to have a real cleansing faith comes by hearing the word of God and what we've got to do is move back all the unbelief all the sins that so easily besets us the things that hinder us the excuses made Lord I'm gonna face off with my excuses [Music] I'm going to face
