Hebrews 1 verse 1. God who at sundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by a son whom he hath pointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high that right there proves that Jesus Christ is God himself being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they For unto which of the Angels said he at any time Thou Art my son this day have I begotten thee and again has he said unto any of the angels I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and again as he said to any of the Angels when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of God worship Him Jesus Christ and of the angels He said saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire but under the sun he saith thy Throne o God is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom and I just noticed that today and studying and it just uh just inspires me just now even we'll bring that out later sometime verse 9 thou has loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore God even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows and now Lord in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands they Shall Perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment and as a Vester shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but Thou Art the same and thy ears shall not fail but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be The Heirs of salvation you can have your seats and I pray that God would bless his word now as we go forward Hebrews 1 and verse 4 said being made so much more better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they sister Genie I can text you this later but my title of the night is Haman the agagite the adversary and enemy Haman the agagite the adversary and enemy what I'd like to do tonight is there's a lot of types I've been bringing out different types and shadows of Nestor and and how it relates to our spiritual walk and I I didn't anticipate to have another uh insert into this but it was just the way things came and studying today so we'll maybe wrap up next time but I just this this uh there's something in here that so inspired me that I want to get to a little bit later but in this and and the reason why I'm bringing about uh Hebrews pulling in Hebrews is because it's talking about the angels and how how Christ was made uh a little bit later in Hebrews chapter 2 it says he was made lower than the angels and yet we find in chapter one the scripture says he's more than the Angels Jesus Christ was given a greater Authority than the angels He was above the angels and the Angels were set below him and and we find and and a lot of types between Satan and himself and and Haman in the Book of Esther and we know as we've gone on with the story of Esther how how that you're familiar with Esther how Haman is the arch nemesis of God's people and Queen Esther how he he uh brings about this plan to destroy God's people and that includes the queen Queen Esther and so we know how the story goes here but we just want to bring out a couple things how um in in our opening scripture it said it said uh an Esther chapter 3 how it said um after these things after Queen after Esther became Queen brother Paul asked in the office one day we were just talking about Esther um I forget who's in there with us and he just he just asked the question and I didn't think much about it and until I was studying this and he said I wonder what I wonder when Haman became promoted was it before after or after Esther became queen and I just thought well I wonder where he's going with that you know that's that's a peculiar question a way to think on it and but what I found was is that Esther's granted Queen and then Haman is promoted so after these things after our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life was was Lucifer promoted after our names were written after Christ died in in his his name was written on the Book of Life over our names and the blood was was going to be shed after that plan was in place then God started creating then God created angels then he created the heavens so our Our Fate of God's people was already sealed up in his book before we even had an enemy amen our names were written before the foundation of the world before Lucifer an angel was promoted and we see that that Haman is promoted and it goes to Great length to say he was promoted above all the princes he was promoted above above all his counterparts and we know that Lucifer Satan was promoted above all the Angels around him he was he was the right hand of God at that time and and and and yet he lusted for more and Haman is the right hand of the king the king we'll get to it here in a little bit gives Haman his seal and he says you're next to me your word is now my word and it cannot be broken and and yet we'll find that wasn't good enough for Haman so we see a lot of these these characteristics and the story The Book of Esther references many times how Haman wants to destroy the people of God it doesn't just say he wants to bind him doesn't want to say he say that he wants to put him in slavery it actually says over and over again when it talks about haman's desire is to destroy to utterly destroy to wipe out to destroy God's people and Satan of course would do that to your life tonight he would try to inflict a cancer on you or he would try to do something there's there's many needs that were brought before us tonight that we want to keep in prayer and and some of them we don't know where they stand with God and if God if if they were to pass on then we would just have to trust that we've we've committed them into God's hands I I had a there was I was at a funeral one time and I was just grieved in my spirit and it was a family member's funeral and I was just thinking but I didn't know where they stood and and it was it was you know a priest of that they had and you know not knowing truth like we know truth and and he made a comment and he said you know many times people on their dying death bed make their heart right with God and we'll never know it because they can't speak and and that that helped settle my spirit in that moment that helped bring me some peace and I just thought well I just I just trust that they did that and so we just have to trust that but Satan would try to get to you before you could have that chance but you remember the thief on the cross as it's been brought out many times he didn't have much of an opportunity until the end but he just said all he said he didn't say forgive me forgive my sins I've I can I be let down and baptize me all he said was remember me when you're in your kingdom and Jesus granted him eternal life so Haman Haman would want to destroy God's people Satan would want to destroy us before we could have that opportunity to give our hearts to God but he doesn't want to just destroy us he would take your life if he could sure that would be good but what he wants to do the most is to destroy your spiritual walk to destroy your relationship with Jesus Christ and he's put everything in our path today to be able to do that he's put he's put he's made the the internet and and and social media is is probably one of the greatest plagues that we have of today we have you know and you think that you know we know that it would be something physical but the Branham said there will be plagues that make cancer look like a toothache but there's plagues today that make cancer look like a toothache but in a spiritual sense they make they make the things that they had to deal with back then look like a toothache compared to what we have available and what Satan has has uh conjured up today to destroy us spiritually to get us sidetracked to get us so distracted that we become into a spiritual death that we we lose our spiritual strength that we lose the faith that we need to to defeat him in this hour the the that we that we lose rapturing Faith Satan is after that he's he wants to destroy us but we see uh now let's just draw some of these things out Esther six and you know what I'll just reference these for time's sake tonight but Esther 6. and and six through nine no let's let's read it let's read it Esther 6 6. all right sister Genie's with me she's doing good so Haman came in so this is this is Haman is is distraught he's I I think he's he's put out a decree that the people should bow before Haman whenever he's around well there's one man that won't bow and his name's Mordecai and it's driving Haman up a wall and so Haman um I forget what happens just before this but they're just they Haman is just beyond mad he's just ticked at this point he he cannot stand Mordecai he can't stand God's people he he wants to be lifted up and and treated like the king Mordecai's not doing it and he's stomping his foot and saying this isn't fair it sounds like a little kid you know and that's just what the devil is he's just a little kid so Haman came in and so he's he's out walking the king can't sleep the king says Hey somebody read read read my words back to me and they come across this instance where Mordecai foiled the plan that was gonna that those two men that were in the king's court were going to destroy the king and so the king says well what what was done to him to reward him well there's nothing written here and so he says well what can we do and then they said well then he says well who's around and they said oh haman's around and this picks it up so Haman came in he says go let him come in so Haman came in and the King said unto him what shall be done unto a man whom the king delighteth to honor now Haman thought in his heart to whom would the king Delight to be to do honor more than to myself who in the world would the king want to honor it has to be me it has to be me what pride and selfishness and Haman answered the king now this is him saying it's got to be me so I'm going to make it good I am going to get what I wanted I I'm watch this let the Royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and the Crown Royal which is set upon his head and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king's most notable princes that they may array the man with all whom the king delighteth to honor and bring him on Horseback through the street of the city and Proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honor and he's he's saying make him like the king dress him like the king put him on the horse like the king we know that Satan is is found riding a white horse in Revelations what's he doing he wants to be like the king the king is on a white horse let let me have a white horse and we know that he changes horses as he goes but so he has all of this in his heart and and he's he's saying King promote me so now we want to go over to Isaiah 14. Isaiah 14 and verse 12. now that was what haman's desire was now let's look at what Satan's desire is he says says Isaiah 14 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning he was made the Morning Star he was made the Angel of the Morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did US weaken the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will say and you know you are the stars of God and we know that over in Revelations there's stars in the in the hand and that's the messengers and here's Satan that's so bold I'm going to make my Throne I'm I'm gonna I will exalt it God so God gives him this position and then he says I'm going to exalt it I'm going to make it more than what the king made it how he ever thought he had the authority to do that I don't know I will say also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the North I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high let's stop right there Satan's great plan he he lays it out the Bible exposes it now we know what Satan's after now we know what Satan's trying to do now we know that Satan is trying to to rule over us and his only purpose is to destroy us his only purpose is to have dominion over you and and he can only have what God allows so so he'll bring everything about so that us and our free moral agency we make choices we we get presented with choices every day do we choose do we choose the Lord's Side or do we choose the enemy side and I and I regret to say oftentimes I do we all do we make the wrong choice and Satan presents that and he says hi I got him ha you know and and we've heard it before he's the one he'll tempt you and then he'll call the police on you he'll say hey buddy here here's this go look at this and then he'll say ha I got you and then he'll go before God and I'll say hey did you see what he did he didn't say hey did you see what I did he says Hey do you see what he did do you see how he fell to that do you see the decision that he just made so we see the desire to be like the most high now Esther and I'll just reference these back in Esther 3 we find that just just typing Satan and and Haman now we find that haman's haman's princes the ones that are under him and just just for typing's sake I'm going to say haman's demons tell them hey we can't affect God's people there's there's there's a man that is not bowing to you and when we talk to him we ask them why won't you bow and he said no I'm not going to do it and they said well please just just bow to him it'll make it easier for all of us and he said but he won't bow we we tried we tried to persuade him we tried to we tried to to let him have it we tried to tell him you have to bow and he still won't do it in the end of verse 5 says Haman was full of Wrath and when you won't bow to Satan's devices he gets angry and he says okay it tells us demons if you can't do it then I'm gonna have to do it and so then he comes down and he Wars against us verse 6 says so when when when haman's Devils couldn't get God's people to fall Haman went himself and where does he go he goes straight to the king the only source he could go to before he could touch the people the king's people the king's subjects before he could do anything more he had to go to the king for permission Haman accuses God's people before the king and it's interesting because you can read in Ezra and different books around Esther and these men are saying you know what king these Jews they're nasty they're nasty people they have their own laws they don't regard the king's laws they're Peaceable they're not causing any trouble but they're not doing they're not going the direction of remember last time we talked about the spirit on that Nation they're not going in that direction they're they're they're they're withstanding the evil Age and and the the demons can't handle that I don't know what to do with them I don't I don't know what to do with Wesley I don't know what to do with Henry and Sharon I don't know what to do with the different ones he names you by name the demons do and Satan says well I'm going to have to go myself if you can't do it I'll go but I'm so glad tonight that when when when the Angels couldn't do it when nobody else would fit the bill Jesus Christ God himself said you know what this isn't a job for you it's a job for me I'm going myself I'm gonna go myself Haman he comes and he asked permission later again he comes and he asks for permission uh to do something to God's chosen now let me just see here because I had this written down wrong so I just want to catch this chapter 3 verse 10. and the King took his ring from his hand and gave it unto Haman the son of hemedatha the agagite the Jews enemy and the King said unto Haman the silver is given to thee the people also do with them as it seemeth good to thee so this is Haman he's he's come to the king he's expressed I need your permission there's a people out there they're just nasty they're nasty people and the King says okay here's your permission now go over to Job chapter 1 with me Job chapter 1. we'll we can let sister Genie put it up verse 6. now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan once cometh thou then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth God and His Jewish evil then Satan answered the Lord and said the job fear God for not Hast not Thou made and hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou has blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land now in each throughout the history of the Bible each of the kings that were set over the Israelites when they had went into bondage I think except for well even with the Babylonians at some point the the children of God found favor with that King but there was always somebody that was that was trying to try to put blame and fall on them always somebody coming before the king and accusing him but they were always they always were given favor with those kings verse 11. but put forth uh but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face and the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth on hand so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord pull up job 2 chapter 2 verse 1. again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord and the Lord said unto Satan from whence cometh thou and Satan answered the Lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it nasty fella and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth God and His Jewish evil and still he holdeth fast his Integrity now watch this now God's going to brag on him say you tried you you consider them I'm just asking kind of it's almost like a mockery you know hey satan we've had this conversation before but have you considered my servant job have you heard about job he says and still oh yeah yeah that's right you did you did consider him still he holds fast his Integrity although thou movest me against him to destroy him without cause and Satan answered the Lord and said skin for skin yea all that a man hath will he give us for his life but put forth on hand now and touch his bone in his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face and the Lord said unto Satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life so when so went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord and smote job with sore boils from the soul of his foot unto his crown this is this is that that coming before the presence and we've heard these things before but I bring it to your remembrance again and and type it in with Haman he had to go before the king Satan has to go before the king before you can have a trial Satan has to go before the king before you can get sick Satan has to go before the king before somebody in your life could pass away Satan has to go before the king before he can do anything to you so we draw these similarities between Haman Queen Esther and the Jews adversary and Satan the bride Through the Ages adversary it's always been he's always been the adversary you do you don't have a new adversary this is the same adversary that the people of God have been fighting throughout all the ages Even in our story of Esther this was Satan behind this he was driving these Spirits behind remember we brought out in Daniel the Prince of Persia it was it was the spirit that was on that nation that was warring against the Saints and and but there's a spiritual battle as we brought out the last time there's a spiritual battle and and in that spiritual battle there's there's angels that either they're battling and they're warring against but they the Angels of Darkness will not overcome the angels of light because you remember there was a there uh I believe it was Michael gets called in who is who is Christ he gets called in and he starts he starts warring with the Prince of Persia so that this Angel this messenger could get to Daniel and he tells Daniel I heard your prayer from day one I heard your prayer from day one so that from day one when you when your request even becomes on your mind because your your thoughts speak louder in heaven than even your words but then when you speak it in prayer from that time on God is on the case God is on the case the angels are working for you they're working to get to you they're working to bring you your deliverance they're working to bring you your healing but it's this adversary that that we're up against now I want to follow because it the scripture is is is um so specific to say Haman the agagite and so I just I got curious one day and I said okay so what's the big deal about an agagite and and you know we've said it before and I learned it and and uh it was the The Sight and Sound story of Esther's kind of started me down this path um really good great job but in that they give some history and they said they at the the Aggregate and and they start giving the history of how Haman is in agagite which comes from um amalek and they and that's the king that Saul was supposed to destroy and he didn't and he he spared his life and so amalek's lineage continues on and here it is rising up again against Israel and now I just want to bring this back so so the agaric lineage we find in Genesis comes from Esau Esau has a son and his name is emelek then over in Exodus 17 verse 8 to 14. um we're doing good on time so let's let's go there Exodus 17. in verse 8. so Israel's come out of Egypt they've come out of bondage they've come out of the world and then their battles don't stop there then came amalek and fought with Israel and refitim and Moses said unto Joshua choose us out men and go out fight with amalek tomorrow I will stand at the top of the hill with a rod of God in my hand so Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with emelek and Moses Aaron and her went up to the top of the hill and it came to pass when Moses held up his hands that Israel prevailed and when he let down his hands emalek prevailed but Moses's hands were heavy and they went and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat there on and Aaron and Hurst stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the Sun and Joshua discomforted emelek and his people with the edge of the sword Moses's hands are outstretched and as long as they're outstretched Jesus's hands were outstretched and nailed to the cross so they stayed that way so we have our victory as long as they were outstretched and Joshua discomforted emelek and his people with the edge of The Sword and the Lord said unto Moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua I want to stop right there because I want to come back to this so you see how amalek I mean they're just they're right out of the way out of Egypt they come across the Red Sea they're they're on their way to the promised land and here comes this nasty fella and he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna try to tear him up he's gonna try to destroy him now Schofield makes a note on amalek and I just thought this was good so bear with me while I read this amalek was born after the Flesh and progenerator of the amalekites Israel's persistent enemy is a type of the Flesh and the believer so watch this now watch this type scriptures specific to say Haman the agagite when you go all this back again amalek is a type of the Flesh and the believer he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now but the conflict with amalek in chapter 17 sets forth the resources of the man under law rather than those of the believer under grace if you go read Romans 7 you'll find you'll find this starting to be discussed and Paul does a beautiful job at explaining this sets forth the resources of the man under the law rather than those uh of the believer under grace Paul says over there in Romans 7 he says he says I didn't know sin except for it was by the law so the law came and then and then it was like sin came with it and he said it's not that the law is bad he said I wouldn't have known that I was sinning except for it was by the law but then man can become so Bound by the law that that he he operates under law and and does away with Grace the man under law could fight and pray he could fight in Joshua he could he could pray under grace the Holy Spirit gains the victory over the Flesh in the believer's half amen now Romans 8 uh sister Genie if you could pull that up Romans 8 verse 2. I told you I had a lot of scriptures tonight but I hope I'm not losing you Romans 8 and verse 2 and we're just going to go to four so don't let me go past it for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh it didn't give you any overcoming power it just told you you were wrong God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemns him in the flesh amen that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us there's a righteousness in the law but it couldn't be done it couldn't be fulfilled in us without Christ who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit now Sister Genie Galatians 5 16-17 and then in Romans uh back in in chapter seven you find Paul is that's where Paul's saying I I constantly I want to do good but every time I try to do good Evil's with me and and that which I don't want to do that I find myself doing but I think it's so beautiful this week as I went there and and I found that Paul actually says never it's it's it's no longer I because of this sin and because of the law because of this law of sin and death that's working in my flesh he says it's no longer me when my desire is to do good and evil is present with me it's not I in the eyes of God that's doing the sin it's sin itself that's doing the sin so he says in God's eyes I'm no longer to blame when I sin it's not me doing it it's the sinful flesh that's doing it so so maybe I'm not saying that just right because I got more excited than what you're giving me right now he's saying in God's eyes when you do wrong it's not you doing the wrong it's not you anymore it's it's sin that's doing it it's sin gets the blame it's Satan that gets the blame because Satan introduced sin into into in the garden amen and so it's no longer you when you sin when you do wrong we beat ourselves up Satan calls the cause the police on us he goes before God and he's he's giving he's giving his his input to God his accusation against us he says hey you know look what he just did but God says no no he just repented that's not him that's sin doing that and sin will always be with us in this flesh sin it's just it's the of her nature and there's and and even though there's a wheat gets put in that it's still Cockapoo on the outside and it's sticky and I hate it Galatians 5 16 and verse 17. this I say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so you cannot do the things that you would so your desire is there your hunger is there your thirst is there God I don't I don't want to do this thing anymore I don't want to be bad I don't want to do evil and yet there's something in you that's always that's always drawing you to it and it's the flesh it's not you it's the flesh it's Satan always there to tempt you to always bring this thing to always work on the flesh because the flesh is not converted it's the sinful nature of the flesh is not converted it's not controlled by the spirit except you give submission to the spirit and your your flesh comes under subjection and that's through the power of the Holy Ghost so you can have dominion over your flesh but it's what do you submit to and if you're walking after the flesh it the flesh lusts against the spirit so we have to be in the word we have to you you have to come to church listen this isn't you don't have to come to church for attendance so so you can mark down in a book you don't have to come to church to pay your tithes we don't need your ties we you should pay them but we don't need them what we need for you to do is to come to church so you can be spiritually refreshed so you can continually walk after the spirit and have dominion over the flesh because the spirit and the flesh are constantly in war against each other foreign field ends he says but this Victory is only as the believer walks in the spirit acting in independency or or and I'm sorry I don't know that I can pronounce that right now Independence or Disobedience amalek the flesh gains an in an easy Victory so when we act in Independence or in Disobedience against the spirit amalek the flesh gains an easy victory now watch this I'm just going to make reference to this and this this is just some things that have opened up and I don't know how to fit them in or when but numbers and I'm not claiming to have any great Revelation okay it just opened up to me it's things we know we're blessed people but it's it's what's opened up to me numbers 14. um 42 to 45 is is 14 is kadish barnia and the the children of the Lord reject the word of God and they and they and they they look at their own self they look at their they're comparing their flesh they're looking at the Flesh and they say we can't do it they're they're this the spiritual enemy is greater than we are we can't win and but God said that's your land go take it before you take it I'll tell you what go get some fruit from the land it'll encourage your faith but when they come back they say oh we can't do it they're looking at their flesh oh I can't do it I can't live a Christian walk I can't I can't make it Satan's always beating up on me I'm always defeated I always walk into feet I'm always falling to sin I'm always falling to the same thing in my life and I just want to make new mistakes and and it's just just something new sometime would be great because this thing just seems I keep falling my flesh is too weak I can't make it Lord why did you choose me in the first place kadish barnia they wake up the next morning after after they've rejected the word of God after after God's judgment has come forward and they say hey Moses we're going to go defeat the amalekites they're just they're just up on the mountain we're gonna go fight them we're going to avenge our sin you'll see we'll we'll show them we'll we'll gain our Victory back we'll earn our way into the Promised Land that's all coming fresh by the way I didn't expect to say any of that Moses tells them if you go up you're going to be a defeated people God is telling you not to go you would think that they would learn okay we just rejected the word of God we just had judgment passed upon us let's let's follow the word of the Lord Moses says don't go God's not with you you will fall if you go up and they say we got to earn our way Moses we're going up they go up they fall because they reject God's word again they go up and they lose and this this brings up the point when we lay down the word to fulfill our fleshly desires because now this is a quote now you you have to lay down the word before you can sin you have to lay down God's word before you can sin and James said what's drawing you to that is is the lust of the flesh and will lose every time when you lay down the word you'll lose every time when you lay down the word you automatically choose to go Satan's way and you'll you'll come away feeling defeated you'll come away with your spiritual Faith hindered but I just want to read a couple more scriptures sister Jeannie are you still with me okay she's doing great let's give her a hand [Applause] Deuteronomy 33 28 sister Genie this is the word of the Lord that's over you if I wrote These down right Israel then shall dwell in safety alone the Fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine also his Heaven shall drop down do so this is if I'm remembering right in these scriptures sorry sister Genie I'm going to have to turn there because I think there's some good stuff here I believe that this is when Moses is going off the scene and he starts blessing Israel chapter 33 and verse 1 and this is the blessing where with Moses the man of God bless the children of Israel before his death and he said the Lord came from Sinai and Rose up from Seer unto them he shined forth from Mount Paran and he came with ten thousands of his Saints from his right hand when a fiery law for them yea he loved the people all his Saints are in thy hand and they sat down at thy feet everyone shall receive thy words that's the word of the Lord over you that's the end that's that's your end that's the end of this journey for you 33-28 and this is this is you know we've they've come through fighting amalek they've they've come through these things Israel then shall dwell in the safety alone the Fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine also his Heaven shall drop down do Isaiah 40 verse 26 and 31. Isaiah 40 verse 26 and 31. Lord let me make sure I got that right I don't think I do oh I'm not in the right spot in my Bible that's why sorry sister Jeannie I just got to see it to make sure I won't catch everything I want that's verse 25. to whom then will ye liken me or shall I be equal saith the Holy One 26 lift up your eyes on hit on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them all by name by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth why sayeth thou o Jacob and speak as though Israel my way is hid from the Lord and my judgment is passed from my God hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the Everlasting God the Lord the creator of the ends of the Earth faneth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint the going back to Hebrews if you continue on in Hebrews remember I said he was given charge over the Angels he was he was he was although he came and he was below the angels yet he was above them in power because it was God in flesh Jesus Christ and and Paul goes on to write that you are heirs to that you are heirs and and there's different scriptures in Ephesians and I think over in Galatians it says everything was placed underneath his feet so even though he was lower than the Angels even though Technically when he came in flesh he was lower than Lucifer because he because Lucifer was an angel yet it was God and flesh and when he died and his hands were were stuck to that cross out stressed they were they were nailed so they stayed up it gave you and I the victory over the Angels it says that all things are put under his feet and then in in another spot if it don't say it outright I think it does but if it doesn't you can get gather from it if you're heirs to that that everything is under the feet of Jesus Christ and your heirs to it then everything is under your feet including the angels amen so this is the word of the Lord over you this is the word of the Lord now if I can catch these and and we're doing good on time are you still with me amen sister Genie um numbers 24 verse 4. and I I hope I got in here what I wanted verse 4 we're going to verse 9. he has said which heard the words of God which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance so this is this is um Balaam but having his eyes open how goodly are thy tents oh Jacob and thy Tabernacles o Israel I want you to remember amalek represents the flesh as the valleys are they spread forth as Gardens by the Riverside as the Trees of Lane lean aloes which the Lord hath planted and as cedar trees beside the waters he shall pour the water out of his bucket and his seed shall be in many Waters and his King shall be higher than egg egg is the king of uh the amalekites and his kingdom shall be exalted God brought for him forth out of Egypt he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn he shall eat up the Nations his enemies he shall break their bones and Pierce them through with his arrows verse 9 he he couched he laid down as a lion and is a great lion who shall stir him up blessed is he that blesseth thee and curseth he that curseth thee let's go to Exodus back to Exodus 17 verse 15 and 16. oh she's fast and Moses built an altar and called the name of it uh Jehovah sorry Jehovah Nissi for he said because the Lord hath sworn that the Lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation and I think that's it so the Lord's going to have war with amalek let's catch one more Deuteronomy 15 17-19 Deuteronomy 15 then Thou shalt taken all and thrust it uh let's see I think I got that wrong Deuteronomy 25 17-19 sorry remember what amalek did unto thee by the way when you were come forth out of Egypt how he met thee by the way and smote behind most of the even all that were feeble behind thee when now has was faint and weary and he feared not God therefore it shall be when the Lord thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about this is what I wanted Malex the Flesh and it and he said that it'll constantly be warring with you but here it is therefore it shall be when the Lord thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it that's what Jesus Christ purchased that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of amalek from under Heaven Thou shalt not forget it amalek your flesh one day the remembrance of it is going to be blotted out we war against amalek we war against the flesh every day we we hate it we strive we we want to do right we can't seem to do right and yet one day the remembrance of your flesh is going to be blotted out from under heaven amen amen you can stand to your feet and I'm just I'm just gonna bring this down to a close Esther 6 verse 13 and 14. Haman is is distraught and he's Furious Haman told zaresh's wife and all his friends everything that had befallen him then said his wise men and dressed his wife unto him if Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews if if this people sitting here tonight and who listen to this later if they be the seed of of of Jesus Christ before whom thou Hast begun to fall Thou shalt not Prevail against him but shalt surely fall before him and while they were yet talking with him King the King's chamberlains and hasted to bring Haman under the banquet that Esther had prepared so even here Haman type of Satan he's done all this he's getting furious with this people he's getting furious with the people of God we we get furious with the flesh we get furious fighting the enemy and yet his own people haman's own people said you you're trying to make them fall but you're actually going to be the one that falls that's that's the end of Satan every attempt to destroy and accuse God's people to the king that Haman tried backfired on him and the King's Queen and God's people were exalted when it came down to the end the enemy's life was held in the Queen's hand and everything the enemy tried to do to God's people was actually done to him instead you remember he built the Gallows and he said make them as high as you can and then he was the one that was hung on them we know that over in Revelations and in other places in the Bible we find the end we find our adversary we've read about our adversary but yet over in Revelations he's cast into the pit and and he won't bother us anymore oh the day amen over the day let me read you a couple quotes real quick musicians can come if the church has been judged and they have judged themselves and have accepted the blood how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless you say there's no such a person every born-again believer True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God he is not trusting in his own works in the blood of Jesus that his confession has dropped into the Bible says so see he that is born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin remember when you're when you're under the blood when you when you're filled with the Holy Ghost it's no longer you it's sin that does it it's sin that gets the blame that's why it says in in the next right right in uh the next verse start of of Romans chapter 8 it says now that there is therefore therefore brother Paul has always told us go see what the therefore is there for it's everything in chapter 7 that we've been discussing is is the Flesh and warring and different things he says there is therefore now no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus how can you make a man a sinner when the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is between him and God that would scatter sin till there wouldn't be anything left of it see how can that pure blood of Christ ever let a sin pass there he cannot he cannot that's the word of the Lord over you you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you have sent you you never sinned at the first place you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ how can you if a man if I was supposed to die in the morning a man took my place I cannot die for that sin somebody took my place and Jesus the word took my place he became me that a sinner that I might become him the word amen let me hold true to it not the church the word amen oh that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day amen brother Michael you can play something soft let me just make sure I I might want to stop there but I do have one more possibly [Music] yes yes yes sorry I'm excited seven golden candlesticks in Exodus 25 31 it says and thou shalt make a Candlestick of pure gold of beaten work shall the Candlestick be made his shaft and his branches his bowls his knobs and his flowers shall be of the same the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes foreign Ty is found in him [Music] I don't deserve this what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God how can one fathom it how can one understand it though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for God hath spoken it and when I was listening to a message and maybe we'll bring out more some time but those last words just ring though we cannot do that we can accept it by faith for God has spoken it [Music] we've been given another chance at kadish barnia we've been given another chance the word of the Lord has been spoken over you the word of the lord it's not it's not a physical land now it's a spiritual land this is the word of the Lord that's been spoken over us in this generation it's been breathed over us let's not fail to believe it let's not fail to take him at his word and I believe he has Grace I believe more and more as time goes by that this is all Grace I believe it more and more and it's things like this that just make me want to stop and praise him for a little while cry for a little while because I I'm I'm not there I don't deserve it I I make choices every day the wrong choices and I wish I could take them back and I can't but it's his grace and this is this is it doesn't make sense it don't seem fair but he knew it wasn't fair [Music] and this is the word of the Lord over you
