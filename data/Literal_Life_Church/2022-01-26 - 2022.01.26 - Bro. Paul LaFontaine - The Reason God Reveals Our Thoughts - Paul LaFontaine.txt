========================================

praise the lord so tonight we want to jump right in here where we left off and maybe we'll just title this a different title tonight the reason god reveals our thoughts the reason god reveals our thoughts and don't forget in this series it's actually coming from uh a series that i'm bringing out of psalms 1. the reason we're into this thing about the thought life is there's one scripture in psalms 1 1-3 that talks about the man that is blessed and it talks about where he positions himself and it talks about him thinking upon the things of god and meditating upon them day and night and so because it's emphasizing a blessed man's thought life being under control i thought it necessary to take some time in our thought life and so but we're in this series if you want to be reminded what we're going back to it's this blessed man of god who walketh not in the accounts of the ungodly nor sitteth in the way of the seat of the scornful and so it's all about position it's a blessed man it's a believer but you have to position yourself correctly and he chooses to position himself away from the seat of the scornful away from the gossipers can you say amen out of the counsel of the ungodly out of the way of sinners he's distanced himself as much as he can and positioning himself away from those influences i think we need to do that the second verse says and on his law his delight is in the law of god his delight is in the word but on his law it's not just he delights in it it's not just that i love the word i like to go to church and i love to hear the preaching of the word but he actually when he goes home it's not just that he goes to church and listens to the preaching of the word he actually says i want to meditate on this day and night praise the lord this is this is a serious fellow here this is serious it's not just saying yeah i love the preaching and enjoying your preaching brother paul and i love to come and hear it and all these other no he's taking he's saying i want my thought life to be invaded i want my thought life i want the word not just to be a hero of the word but a doer and i want the word to consume my thoughts more and more so that's where i got this series on our thought life and it's becoming such a wonderful subject personally for me i will say though that what but you you're corrected all the time the word corrects where we're living and i'll tell you uh this has been a challenge for me to uh put the scanner on my thoughts i'm just gonna go ahead and say this i really believe and i here's the this this thought came to me on the way to church as i was thinking other thoughts than i should have for church and for the lord i was there weren't bad thoughts but they were negative thoughts and i caught myself and i only have a five-minute drive to work to to work to to church it's pretty bad when you've got a five-minute drive and you're already thinking negative thoughts but i said lord i just caught myself beep beep beep beep nope no no dump it out doubled up five minutes on the way to church and so i caught myself i said this is really real isn't it here's the pastor supposed to have his mind ready for the service and he's thinking things he shouldn't think and i said stop it right there so i this is really real you know what i thought this is why i thought maybe this came from the lord beside we human beings it's it's amazing and i'm gonna venture to say tonight that this is probably the place of most in our life that we exercise our rights more than any other rights that we have you know when we say something and we get caught for saying something wrong if we have god in our heart we're going to apologize and sometimes people without god in their heart they apologize sometimes but you know we're going to make it right okay because we've been exposed and sometimes if you have the holy spirit in your life you feel convicted of something you said and you you didn't you weren't exposed you just went and and corrected it you went and said you know i i said the wrong thing i am sorry i should not have said that that spilled out i should have never said that so we asked uh we would say i'm sorry for that but how many people apologize for their thoughts we're going to get into it tonight because there's several places quite a few places where the prophet is apologizing to god god i'm sorry i thought that how much is that going on because the thought life is this this this undetected unchecked private place and because it is we exercise our rights we can think i may not be able to do what i want but i can think whatever i want and when you start reading the scripture and you start realizing that the thought life can actually quench the spirit of god then you start saying it's time to grow to even let my thought life be corrected come on now casting down imagination and everything that exalted itself above the knowledge of god bringing every thought into captivity of christ that's living a deep life how many of us apologize for thinking the wrong thought towards somebody or thinking the thought towards god i say very rare but the prophet once again is growing as a son of god as an adopted son of god and he's growing to places that we haven't maybe been there yet but every son of god if jesus went there we're going there too if the first fruits of the harvest went there that's he waved it before the people can you say the wave in the old testament when they took that wave chief the first one to come to maturity and wave that mature thing to the rest of the flock and it was a sign the rest of the crop is gonna come to maturity and look at the maturity he's coming to he's actually saying god i'm sorry that i thought that thought praise the lord god helped me to live there god and he and thankfully brother ray he's helping me because i can't do this without him but what a deep life wow we all been taught as as christians to apologize when you say something wrong but apologizing when you think something wrong because you realize he he knows what we're thinking how many things are underneath underneath the blood praise the lord well uh i need to get into my notes that that wasn't my notes i need to get and start on my notes here praise the lord he's still here tonight all right so the reason god reveals so so he we was talking about sunday why does god come into this world of our thoughts and we've seen him do it in service time but he knows the realm of our thoughts all the time and it might go back to this reality and this statement that the prophet made our thoughts speak louder in heaven than our words i want you guys to pull up the first quote there and and he says where that came from we don't have a scripture for that but here's here's where that statement come from god's omnipresence knows what you're doing and even your thoughts one time is this the right one no it's the one in in the influence the first one in influence there 63. god's omnipresence knows what you're doing and even your thoughts one time while i was in a vision i was speaking to i was speaking to a being standing by me and he said back he said your thoughts are louder in heaven than your voice is on earth that's where it came from and he quoted this quite often but it was the angel of the lord who told him that your thoughts and he's teaching the son of god now that your thoughts speak louder in heaven than your voice on earth he knows what you're thinking you might say you do this and you do that and this but you see down in your heart if you think different then you're doing something wrong you should be just what you are you see and the heart the mouth would speak what's in the heart the mouth excuse me the mouth should speak what's in the heart see and so we find that the people doesn't realize the presence of god the mouth should speak what's in the heart he's he's saying that we need to get our thought life and we need to get what's laying in the secret parts we need to get it in line with what we're saying and what we're believing out here our thoughts have to be in line with what we believe and if our thoughts are not in line with what we're saying we need to correct our thoughts and get our heart together with what we're saying that what we say we really believe from our heart and we're not because god knows we don't know about your thought life but god can see he talked about the pharisees and he says uh he says they their mouths speak things but their heart is far from them and so now their heart was distant from the truth of god's word and yet they're speaking the truth of god's word so now as we grow in the lord we're bringing our thought life subject to what we believe what we say what we say we believe our thought and our heart is in line with that amen and then i like this last statement he says see so and so we find that the people doesn't realize the presence of god this is one of the things is that people don't realize that in the presence of god he can see our thoughts in the presence of god and matter of fact this is part of the evidence that you're in his presence you know a lot of people talk about his presence and they sung songs about his presence and it could be different meanings it could be they felt something and sometimes we feel something some sometimes we don't so there's a lot of evidence that people give that we're in the presence of the lord but as i said sunday this part of him discerning the thoughts is eliminated from most of christianity that he knows the secrets of the heart and the intents of the heart god they've removed it but part of the evidence that you know that you have been in his presence is when the secrets of your heart are revealed there's nothing hidden can you say amen and said and we find that people don't realize the presence of god this is a part of the evidence that you've been in his presence not a feeling not a sensation he's dealing with us at a heart level the secrets of the heart the secrets of our thoughts we know that we've been in the presence when god reveals the secrets of his heart by the word of god can i say it again people don't realize he says the the presence of god we know in that statement he made the angel made to him he says our thoughts speak louder in the other dimension then our words are what we're saying out here it's it's they're screaming out and so you can't hide anything so god he can look back and say one of the two things here is a people that i'm looking at what they're thinking and he probably seen this on the day of pentecost when the bible says they were in one mind and one accord that didn't mean that all their opinions were the same but they had one objective and that's to empty out of themselves and pray for god's promise to be fulfilled and they had that one objective together this is what we're coming to church for this is what we're in the upper room for we shut every other thought out right now we're praying for these 10 days brother baby says they were emptying out of themselves emptying out of things and they had one focus one mind and one accord and god looked at that and seen their thought life and their desire to be in one minor one accord is in line with what they're saying and then the holy ghost fire fell on that place one mind one accord but when you have a service where there's millions of different thoughts from unbelief to what i'm going to wear next week how am i going to pay my bill on monday to millions of thoughts going on and it's not about let's forget all that and praise someone through to the holy ghost what if there's a soul here that needs more of god you may not need it you may not you may be saved and filled with the holy spirit praise the lord but why is it that you're so selfish to leave it alone somebody else needs more of god so we focus say god what could you do in this little wednesday night service tonight i'm gonna focus it i don't care about my bills that i owe you know this is one place you can forget about your bills i give you permission because you're not going to solve anything tonight can you say man you'll pick it up tomorrow say god help me you're the provider i just sang it at church jehovah jireh but you're not going to deal with it tonight so focus what can god do for the kingdom of god what young heart can come to the lord what is who's struggling with depression that the spirit of god can sweep through that place and drive that cloud away what can you do if we could all get in one mind and one accord and stop thinking other things then then that's part of the presence of the lord it's an evidence that we've been in the presence of the lord god is watching this and he sees he's trying to see if the heart opens up in simplicity and faith and will drive out its own thoughts of doubt of overcoming trying to figure it all out in your own thinking you see and said lord i i'm tired of trying to figure everything out we're trying to figure out how god's going to do this and he didn't really ask you to figure out how he's going to do it i mean he could show somebody a vision he could give this is a distinct like a prophet i mean i wouldn't knock that if somebody said it praise the lord he tells you exactly what how god's gonna do it but god wants us to have simple faith that he's gonna do it but i don't have to think through how god's gonna do it i don't have to think through when's gonna god's gonna do it are you listening tonight anybody know that there's such a thing as overthinking something i know none of you none of you here tonight ever do that none of you do that i'm sure of it i'm sure but there is certain people that overthink life and overthink things and and besides fearing what's happened they're fearing what hasn't happened yet and they're scared of what hasn't happened or what might happen or what my children might do or the direction they may go and and so it hasn't happened yet but there's so much fear that it might happen that they're bound in those thoughts god does not ask us when we pray something to figure out and think through how he's going to do it but he asked for simple faith to stand there like a rock and say i believe god is going to do it i believe he's going to do it because he's able to do it i'm not budging on believing with all of my heart and when god looks at my thoughts and when god looks at my heart i'm not budging and god can see my faith isn't gonna budge whatsoever but i don't have to think about how god's going to do it i don't have to think it through when god's going to do it but he wants us to see our thought life saying he's going to do it i believe he's going to do it amen because he is able he's more than able that's what he wants to hear overthinking things man a whole sermon can be dedicated to overthinking overthinking and all the while the bible says let this mind be in you which is also in christ jesus all the while the bible says think on good things all the while about the bible's given us instruction how to guide our thoughts so when you overthink things you've probably taken a lot of your thought life just filled with wasted time can i get an amen so then we say something like i'd like to have a penny for every thought that was wasted thought i'd be a millionaire wasted thoughts had no value to him whatsoever never got you anywhere never never brought fruit amen so god is watching and he sees of our heart is open to simplicity and faith and open to driving out our thoughts of doubt our thoughts of trying to overthink something or how god will do something and so i was saying sunday that people will come in back in brother branham's day and in any of these revivals when they'd hear of a gift working like this i think people probably i would say because we're built this way they were coming to see they heard what god could do supernaturally the blind light thine eyes being open the dead being raised people delivered from their crutches people coming up from their wheelchairs cancers being healed innumerable amounts of miracles and they're hearing around the world this wasn't done in jeffersonville indiana read your history books it was done around the world and it spearheaded a healing revival so you got great crowds coming but a lot of people come for different reasons some come as just critics christian people coming to critics i'm out to prove it wrong i'm proud to find fault but other people come for a hunger for the supernatural god this is doing things like jesus did and i want to see he can do it again i've never seen this in my church and so i'm going to travel hundreds of thousands of miles with lots of money to get there because i want to see the supernatural i doubt too many people came because to see in order to see the secrets of the heart being revealed i don't know i'm just speculating that most of it is to see god perform a miracle but once they got into that presence then you realize people come for many different reasons some people come for good so i said sunday some come for come for bad reasons some come because you know of this that and just like when they come to church now some people come from a lot come for a lot of different reasons you want to believe people come just because they're hungry from the word and that's it but some people come to criticize some people come to find something wrong some people come because it's part of their schedule sunday going to church is part of their schedule they got a certain slot for that and then as i said when i preach over time what i should have then they're done they got to get right out because i went beyond their schedule and i think that i'll say it again because i think that we shouldn't schedule in god we should be we should be the ones flexible that if he wants to interrupt the entire schedule for the entire week instead we're scheduling in from 11 to 1 on sundays what if god wants to save your children what if god wants you to pray the rest of night here why don't you quit putting god in a schedule and be submissive to his schedule his plan and his will amen some come as skeptics always finding fault some have no trust in in in preachers and sometimes that's understandable because of what they've been through but they bring those thoughts with them and so everything's filtered through that fault of a preacher hurting them some are thinking in the service that this is all good but i'm unworthy of this i've done too many things i'm i'm not in this category i'm not and that's all the devil's thoughts i want to let you know that's all the devil's thoughts that none of that comes from god whatever thought that says you're unworthy of the blessings of calvary because of either what you did or because of you some your complexes that's that's not a thought from god you are not worthy except calvary has made you worthy of every blessing of calvary so that thought is not even of god i'm worth unworthy of all this and the healing is not for me because i've done too many things you see this whole thought life and and thinking i've seen this all before this is just an emotional workup i don't need it some people think this isn't for me some young people think this is not for me i don't want to be religious fanatic this is not for me so i'm thinking as soon as i can get out on my own i'm out of here these young young people think that it's all thoughts your thoughts satan's thoughts but it's not god's thoughts for you some thinking i'm too good for this i don't need to believe this i'm fine i got everything i need i don't need to accept christ completely and sell out lock stock and barrel i don't need to do that that's thoughts so you look at this these millions of thoughts going on in the other world no wonder god gets restricted no wonder god gets restricted in what he can do and i'm not trying to preach guilt on us tonight i'm trying to preach that our thoughts can quench and hinder how far god can go our thoughts can can stop how god wants to go deeper in our lives our thoughts can stop healing that what god wants to give you your thought can stop you from the healing i notice people that that they ask for you to pray for them but they're going to continue the pattern of of believing what the doctor said as if it's a final say i've got this he says i have this they give it a name he says i'll have this for life and they themselves buy into the idea that i have it for life we we don't know that the doctor doesn't really have the authority to say that especially when god is involved but their thought process i want to be healed but they have a mentality that they keep hashing it over and keep reminding this is my problem this is my problem this is my you know this is with me and and i got to do this and i got to do this to compensate for this and and so so now i'm trying to be respectful of the fact that god uses different things to help you and to aid you and to i'm not preaching against that i'm preaching against the thought life that has given up in the healing of god you can't ever give up on the power of god's healing of any disease including coven you guys got that um slide up there about omnicrom or whatever it's called i didn't i didn't i'm just putting somebody sent that to me and i'm putting it up probably get in trouble for doing it but i'll tell you who sent it to me brother the brother the preacher a couple weeks ago brother kathy and because the week after or that weekend they went home and they got covered and right in the middle of having covered him and his wife and family you're starting to learn the kind of man he is he sends us this because he's going to give the devil back because you have to remind the devil and you have to remind yourself it's real it's it's happening we protect ourselves we do what we can but never buy into the idea that this isn't touchable by the blood of the lamb all right take it down before i get into more trouble i believe it amen i believe it we have to remind the devil when he makes it uh so permanent amen amen can you say amen help me out here so these millions of thoughts and as i said we exercise our rights more in the thought life than any other place in our lives sorry for thinking that i'm going to read a quote in a minute i'm sorry for thinking that the prophet who says sorry for that and i just think that we exercise our right to think what we want to think too much we have a right as an american we have a right and we technically we do have a right to think what we ought to think but it's such a private world but we give ourselves permission to think sometimes we give ourselves permission to say whatever we want to say i tell you you better say lord help me to say a word in season and the right thing help me to say the right things and when i say the wrong thing to make it right can you say amen but don't give yourself permission to say whatever you want i say what i want when i want to say it there's a right thing to say and sometimes there's the right thing to say in the right setting because you might be saying the truth or you might be saying your opinion but you're not watching who you're saying in front of you might be saying something in front of your kids that probably shouldn't be said sometimes so if that's true in our words brothers and sisters then what about our thoughts it's the private world it's the it's the closed world have i talked about in this series that the the different parts of our thinking like the memory and imagination maybe we'll go into some series down the road here of taking each one of those and breaking them down how the devil uses them i did it years ago memory imagination conscience affection reason have i mentioned to you that your imagination part of yourself can think its thoughts think lustful thoughts think dirty thoughts you don't even have to look at something which when you look at things it's wrong because it just encourages it but the human being can in his imagination part can develop his own pornography and her own dirty thoughts the imagination has the power to create your own movie in your imagination create your own movie direct it write it direct it create it and sit in the theater of your imagination and watch it that's how powerful it is and nobody's seen it nobody caught you clicking on something on your computer or your phone you see so this is this is about the heart this is about a rule stay away from things on your phone watch over this and you get you get the holy ghost in your life and you lean on that power you're not going to be turned into those things you need something deeper and you need a deeper experience if you keep justifying that and keep going over and over and over again with it no you need a deeper experience but you know what it's a heart thing because if you've never seen another piece of something wrong and you lived in a world you never seen a woman scantily dressed in this world you would still have the power within your flesh to create the wrong things in your thinking it's true and so so i've never watched any of that that's i wonder sometimes i've never blessed god i've never seen any of that bless god well what have you watched in your imagination because you're just as guilty this is a heart matter this is what's in your spirit and the private secret places god sees when no one else sees i'm just asking you to think about and pray about it because this is real i mean we have yeah it's it's and so and so let's let me continue with the thoughts about what god's seeing that we think about it you know there's there's a reason that god looks into this area of our thought life and another reason why god looks into this is that he wants to correct those thoughts he wants to deliver you from those thoughts maybe as i spoke tonight you've been corrected and you're in my i need to bring this under subjection to the holy spirit god wants to correct those things in all of us and stop talking yourself out of just simple faith in god's word stop overthinking things can you say amen god's god stop overthinking god's already thought all of this through before the foundation of the world you're trying to think things through and you're trying to overthink it and i'm here to tell you tonight i'm here to tell the world god has already got everything thought through that all you make you say well praise the lord i don't have to overthink it i just submit my life to the thought of god a walk in his will god direct me tell me how to make decisions because guess what you've already thought it all through why would you want to think it through when god's already thought it through just saying i'm just saying why would you want to spend all that wasted time trying to how am i going to do this i'm using my fist but see what's happening in your thinking [Music] and from what i know of the message of what the prophet taught us about a prophet he reaches back into the very thoughts of god and he's not thinking it today he's not god's not going okay so how can i direct brother ray today um let me think this through you know he already thought it through before the foundation before you were around and how many remember the scripture in jeremiah i should have read it tonight but you know it so well when god says to jeremiah hey my thoughts are higher than your thoughts my ways i higher than your ways and i'd rather trust in a god who's got it all thought through already than to try to work it out myself yeah tell your friends if we believe in god and that he's omnipresent and he's all these omni things and if we believe it then he's got it all thought through sons of god have a predestinated plan that god had before the foundation of the world and even predestinated trials for you amen praise the lord i wonder if some of you are thinking i wish he just wrapped this up sunday and not continued on this is getting pretty in this is down pretty deep here trust me i when i'm pointing my finger at you i've got three pointing back at me it's true this ministers to all of us can you say amen did it ever occur to you that nothing's ever occurred to god did it ever occur to you that nothing has ever occurred to god he's got this and if you let him he will take matters in his own hands i wrote a song sharon here all right then i'll have to sing it he's taken matters in his own hand when i'm overwhelmed he understands well my boat may reel and rock until jesus takes command and he takes those matters in his own hands you can't sing in the service you're a preacher you can't do that well you can't tell me what to do you're not my grandchild you can't tell me what to do only her he's taking matters in his own hands when i'm overwhelmed he understands my boat may reel and rock until jesus takes command and he takes those matters in his own hand did it ever occur to you that nothing's ever occurred to god did you ever latch onto that thought tonight that says why do we have to overthink stuff because god has already thought this all through and sons of god are coming more and more in line with his thoughts that he had of them before the foundation of the world what's all this preaching what says all this opening up the seals in 1963 to god's people what's this opening of the book of redemption what is this preaching for the last 40 or 50 years from an open book of the open seals what's all the preaching what's the total of all what's the it's it's the sons of god realizing god's thought all this through and they're coming in line with god's thoughts there are sisters here living out in their heart and also in their dress god's thoughts of them before the foundation of the world they're doing it every day there are young men that are living out what a godly young man does and he's why he's catching the thought of god that i'm not supposed to be some scallywag in the world feeding on the things of the world he's called me and seen me before the foundation of the world to walk as a young man holy and clean not bound by lustful spirits he's caught the thought of god that's not me out there this is me right here in the word of god can i get an amen tonight god has already thought your life through even your predestinated trials we get in trouble when we start thinking we can just go off of that a little bit and start doing a little sideshow over here and it's going to try this out you better be careful and say lord bring me back into what your thought was for me for the foundation of the world man i just the lord the holy spirit just keeps helping to linger on that i don't know why so now it was a different gift to perceive the thoughts through the prophet even though he could do it again today they they had the people had to believe so let me just skip down here into some more of the quotes so uh yeah let me skip down here next quote and this this one would be in um testimony and get to these tonight because i didn't get to on sunday so notice now how in this thing that that they're in a service and notice how thoughts can can stop god okay let me see your hands just a moment i want to talk to you a moment brother this is the first case course tonight but i believe you have a tumor isn't that right a tumor it hit like a tumor and every time i start to make say something else it was because i was i couldn't believe it in my heart that it was a spirit that would be i couldn't hardly think in my heart my own heart that that young fellow would have a tumor so now brother branham is saying i i took him by the hand and you remember the sign that he had was that what what color his hand would turn and for those of you uh listening who would not understand that i respect that but um if god sent moses with two signs and he said and jesus said he sent he sent another prophet in the end time he came with two signs like moses and so one of them was if you study it is that when they grab their hand whatever kind of color that would turn he could tell the disease what disease they had so he's thinking when he did that it showed us a tumor and when he did that he in his own thoughts is saying this man is too young to have a tumor a lot of times we think that somebody asked me to pray the other day for a woman who's 31 years old and got cancer it just seems my goodness wow they're just too young for that but it's happening he said he thought he didn't say he thought this is this man is too young i couldn't think it in my own heart a young fellow would have a tumor i thought it might be something else some other something but it wasn't it was a tumor and the spirit every time i'd start say something it'd feel it break up tumor tumor tumor and i just couldn't hardly i'm ashamed of myself and apologize before god and there it is right there praise god that we have a man of god that is actually saying when i'm thinking wait a minute it can't be a tumor it can't be a tumor and the holy spirit's saying it's a tumor it can't be a tumor that's his own thoughts and until you get the acknowledgement of what the thing actually is you're not going to go anywhere so he's apologizing before god because right there in the prayer line he's got his own thinking interrupting he's got his own thinking interrupting he's got his own thinking can you say amen he's got his own thinking interrupting and this is when our thoughts gets in god's way your thoughts can get in god's way so i apologize before god i'm ashamed of myself james did he sin did he say something wrong he thought it and the thought was contrary to the revealing of what was really happening sorry lord my thoughts are getting in the way here but but that's what it is it's what is it it's a tumor now young man now he turns to the young man only god can heal you you know don't you you're just a laddy boy you want to serve him don't you brother will you do it if he lets you get well and you'll serve him all your life god bless you let us bow our head father i ask you to be merciful to our brother he's in need o god of being healed bless him now and may the spirit of the lord be upon him to make him well may this evil power that's on him may it leave and go away may he be healed in the name of jesus christ now just a moment audience it holds him i just want you to if you've listened a lot of the prayer lines you can see sometimes this will happen sometimes he sends them off the stage and goes to the next person but he says now wait a minute wait a minute it holds him in other words he's not healed yet he's not healed yet now you may raise your hand just in a moment if you want i want to see something here young man to increase your faith you're nervous and try to think your own thoughts so i wanted to read this because it shows us that you have the prophet's thoughts saying this can't be a tumor i don't think that's that and he has to correct that and now he's praying for the man and ask him in the name of the lord jesus christ to be healed of this tumor and then he stopped said now wait a minute something's wrong he's still nervous he's still nervous and he says you're trying to think your own thoughts trying to think your own thought so not only brother branham interrupted it with an assault not only brother branham now this boy and brother brown many times i want to see this person healed and so now he gives them instruction you're trying to think your own thoughts and you're nervous so god has to minister to somebody so they say lord calm their nerves settle them down from thinking their own thoughts i don't know what he was standing there thinking but it was keeping him from his healing has anybody ever done that before has everybody ever thinking thoughts even sometimes when you're being prayed for and i think we need to bring our thoughts and lie and say listen nothing else matters right now god if a body of christ a member of the body of christ and a minister like sunday touches them that's why i said before the service do you believe that your pastor could lay hands on you or a minister of the gospel or even another member of the body of christ the worst disease do you believe in simple faith that if they touched you you can be completely healed but but but no no no no buts do you simply believe it it doesn't even say to pray it just says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover doesn't even say to pray we pray but it's just laying on that's what he referred to one time he says for a believer he said science shows that light passes from one member of the body of christ light passes to their body when they lay hands on them now i don't believe you have to lay hands on i think as the uh the one man in the days of jesus said just speak the word can you say amen but then we got the way of laying on hands but it's not it's the faith of it it's not what you say in your prayer it's the power behind it it's the life behind the name if we've got the goods we don't have to be afraid of cancer if we've got the goods we we have to be afraid as parents to lay our hands on our kids if we've got the goods we don't have to be afraid when we pray god deliver save my kids from this direction they're going whatever it is we have to have simple faith that when i say it and pray it it goes to the throne of god everything is under the blood i'm asking forgiveness for everything it's there and now i stand with boldness before my kinsmen redeemer before my high priest can you say a man and i don't there's no unworthiness to this he makes me worthy to pray a prayer of faith sometimes they say and when i go over there and lay hands on that person i'm not even going to pray i've already prayed i'm going to lay hands on them and that's it i believe they're going to be healed but here brother branham has a thought that interrupts it and this young man is not getting in a moment that tumor can die and he can be healed and what's holding him up is his nervousness and thinking too many thoughts about it i asked you tonight if you don't get anything else out of the service i ask you to ponder and pray about what he's saying here because i do believe sometimes we are quenching what god could do because we're overthinking it we're too nervous about it too nervous about where this can go it can go a lot of places but for you to be nervous about we can't get ourselves into just resting that no matter how bad a disease no matter how bad the sickness no matter how bad the condition a person's in no matter how low they've gotten no matter how far that child has went out in the world no matter how messed up and mentally they are no matter how bad a a child is thinking immature thoughts and not thinking like an adult like they should it doesn't matter how bad it is we have to rest in our prayer that god is bigger than all of this can i get an amen from somebody tonight overthinking he wants just simply us to simply believe the word of god i'm closing here after this quote god knows all things and we have to rest in that please don't forget that quote the young man was overthinking it the young man was thinking his own thoughts about it and right there the thought of god the thought of god from the foundation of the world said i knew that this would be here i knew the young man would have a tumor and i know tonight that tumor is going to die that's god's thought but he's thinking his own thoughts this young man brother brahms say it couldn't be a tumor the thoughts of stopping us up once they just let that go and later in the quote the man is healed i didn't put it in he's healed of the tumor praise the lord last quote in testimony all right bring the lady howdy i've i've learned a lot in the last 30 years friends of listening to the prayer lines i've learned a lot it's not only built my faith but i learned how god deals with his people through the prayer lines because god's the same he's the same yesterday today and forever and the manner he deals with people in manner he deals with their nervousness the way he talks to them and the holy spirit's always a gentleman he's something private is going on there they probably just whispered to and say what about this because you couldn't hold a sin there and get your healing you never blasted it over the pulpit the holy spirit's a gentleman he doesn't want to embarrass you children remember that the holy spirit doesn't want to embarrass you but when there's a call that you need god and need the holy ghost and you need a deeper walk it's not to embarrass you it's calling for for christ for you to come closer to christ if there's an altar or call come and get more of christ don't hold back bring the lady how do you do lady do you believe with all your heart you're a real you have real strange feelings don't you especially in the late part of the afternoon i see you getting kind of a leery weary like feelings i remember when i had coveted there's the distinctions in it i don't know if you had the same thing but you know after two or three weeks i was i was weak i didn't have a lot of extreme symptoms but i knew i was weak and it was so funny because i would get up in the morning and feel energy uh brother frame i'd get up and feel like okay i'm over it and i'd start going okay i can get back to what i'm supposed to be doing and then about an hour i just uh and i i completely then i go back to bed the rest of the day another thing covert brought me is it changed my taste forever i don't know what it is but it just this just changed my taste and my smell and you really didn't want to know that but anyway i thought it was really interesting i don't know if you ever had this but when you have nervousness and you have something going on you have strange feelings don't you especially in the late part of the afternoon something about it the morning you can feel fresh and then for this lady in the late part of the afternoon she starts to kind of get a leery weary like feelings you're nervous what's the matter with you it's due to the time of menopause it's the changing time of life you get real weary thoughts i'm reading this i wanted to include this because this is another example of someone who's having a real life change of life menopause and it's bringing those things but it's not a demon some things are demons and some things are not but sometimes a lot of evangelists are just demons demon demon and you better know if it's demon or not and we'll pray for a demon but sometimes physical things of life can bring you down and then the devil starts beating you down more then a demon of depression can come but the core of the problem is she's going through menopause it's a changing time in your life and you get real weary thoughts real weary thoughts ever heard of them their thoughts but they're weary thoughts i don't even know what that is but anyway next one a few days ago when you heard of this meeting you told god if you'd let let if if he let you get up you'd be prayed for and you'd be healed isn't that right so here here's now the secrets of the heart he's telling her what her thought was and what she said to god many days before god if you let me get there and let me get up to that prayer line i believe i'd be healed isn't that right and you're taking some kind of a shots for that aren't you sister yes i see you're taking them you've seen it by vision she's taking shots from the doctor to help her with her weariness or whatever it is and all the things she's going through she's taking shots from the doctor yes i see you're taking it i see them give it to you in the isn't that right come here do you believe me as god's prophet have i told you the truth and you believe that comes from god of course she says yes it's all the truth he's exposed it he's talked about what the doctor says well if i told you what truth what was truth then by the spirit of god i'll tell you what's truth now oh i love that i love that because the same god who knows the past is the same god who knows the future and if he can tell you your past your past so accurately that you couldn't deny it then the same god can tell you accurately what your future is i love it friends and if i told you what truth then by the spirit of god i tell you what truth now you go out of here be real happy you're going to be well for christ has blessed you and you're going out to be well god bless you sister yes man praise the lord i'll tell you what's truth she had to believe what was truth there's no demon that he talks about there his weary thoughts physical condition that's real to life can you say amen weary thoughts and how does he do it well i know for the one sister that he told that she was going through menopause and she's curled up in the chair in the office and she's just nervous and just moving around and looking at things and and she says well i come to find out because i have three preachers one preacher told me i had five demons and one preacher told me i had ten and the other picture had more than that and these are all evangelists that told her you got demons she said i come to you she says i really want to know from how many demons do i actually have she's not even at the point asked for healing anymore just figure out how many demons and he said he said he just prayed he talked to the woman and you know it just it just kind of catching what's going on and then the lord revealed it sister you don't have any demons you don't have one demon you're going through the time of life here and you're real nervous about it it's messing all your hormones up and all this other stuff you're going through you don't have any but but she goes well but but what about the thing i think that's the thing what about about how many sister sister you don't have any demons [Music] and and so then he asked her did you want something to eat and before she said no i don't want to eat she doesn't eat the nervousness can make people not eat properly and all this other things and now i've always used the scripture here you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free you know brother ray that's not just truth is not just the serpency doctrine and the godhead it's the truth about your life you can take a lie of the enemy from the doctor or from your own thoughts but you want to know what god's thought isn't about it can you say man and this woman she began to settle down he said in the office and then he asks are you hungry she says yeah i'm kind of hungry she said well what do i do about the demon she he said i'm telling you again there's no demons what do i need to do right now go home cook your husband a big apple pie clean your house like you said to this woman go on happy rejoicing rest in god you know sometimes people don't want to hear that advice i can't do that they're too nervous but if you settle down and rest in the lord you go back to normal functions of life and say lord i'm i know this is just a normal thing i will come through it god will get me through it and i'm going to focus on what i need to focus on here and just love the lord and it's not any more complicated than that he said kind of hungry took her in the kitchen he said she had three eggs and toast and she had he said she ate a lot she's hungry she hadn't he wasn't eating she was a mess and it wasn't a demon it was her nerves it got the the best of her because of the hormonal thing she was going through i love it when he says sis go on your way happy rejoicing he's trying to teach him change your thoughts don't overthink this just think god's thoughts rest and it may not happen overnight but that's his instruction people are looking you need to fast for 40 days to get rid of this sometimes that's needed but sometimes it's just go on your way and change your attitude be happy enjoy the things that god has given you enjoy the children god has given you enjoy your wife enjoy your husband enjoy the services enjoy the word and stop thinking about everything so much and god will bring you through this time of menopause god will bring you through this time of midlife crisis when you're all messed up you know guys go through midlife crisis as well boy i didn't get any amens on that just as real as a woman she goes through it too and we're all over here saying why don't you just straighten up and we go through it too we internalize all of it and then we probably blow up and blow off but she doesn't internalize that thing but we go through it too and it's a real thing of life all the young people are saying what in the world is he talking about some things that happen to us are real we start allowing it to get us too nervous and overthinking things anybody heard that tonight overthinking thing doesn't do it because he's already got everything thought through he's taken matters in his own hand and i believe he is able more than able to accomplish what concerns me today he is able more than able [Music] to handle anything that comes my way you can stand he is able [Music] more than able to do much more than i could ever dream [Music] he's able more than able yes he is to make me what he wants me now will you sing it from your heart now aligning your thoughts he is able more than able yes he is to accomplish what concerns me today believe it tonight he is able [Music] more than abel handle anything that comes my way [Applause] oh he is able to [Music] do much more than i could ever dream he is able more than able [Music] to make me what he wants me to be can we pray together tonight lord jesus what you presented to us here tonight is it's amazing things to show us how much victory you want us to live in that you could invade our very thought life and correct it and scan it lord that we could redirect our thoughts to the man who said i i want to meditate on his word day and night i'd rather bring my thoughts under subjection and anything that's not of you to bring it in line with you already hearing of victories in the congregation closer walk with you just because they brought their thoughts thoughts in line with you so i pray for those tonight that are praying in their hearts and saying lord i really need help i need strength in this area seeing these different things in the prayer line of the woman with menopause and the young man that was nervous and the lord is such examples to us of how you love us and how you deal with us and how you want us to lay aside our own thinking and our own thoughts and embrace what the word says that you're going to do in us lord to believe by simple faith that you are more than able to accomplish anything that you want to in our lives lord i pray that the word that i'm speaking would go forth by the holy spirit and deliver and encourage and strengthen lord set the devil on the run in people's lives granite father i pray and i ask these things unmovable by the blood of jesus christ we ask it lord because we know that you're able and will do it grant victory to each christian tonight under the sound of our voice in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask him amen everybody said amen
