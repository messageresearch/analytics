========================================

we welcome you it's nice to have you here tonight in the fellowship for wednesday night god bless you welcome brother josiah sister ashley back from the trips and anyone else has been away and some are going away gets busy sister mary good to see you tonight god bless you amen and so summer gets busy with vacations and different things but we'll always try to provide for those who are here whether online or here provide the work the word of god and the food that we need if we're hungry so if you're available we'll certainly do our part to provide it here amen first peter chapter 3 and verse 7 will read tonight and don't forget our evangelists chris cathy brother chris kathy coming in sunday morning and sunday night we've had him once before i know you'll really enjoy him and he'll be with us sunday morning and uh on sunday night for six o'clock tri-state youth meeting so you're all welcome to that but it's brother chris kathy is evangelist from jeffersonville we've had him before and we know that we'll enjoy his ministry this week and looking forward to you be in prayer for that god bless you i think that's all the announcements at this time first peter chapter 3 and verse 7. likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so there's a certain violation of respect that can take place when a husband does not view his wife correctly there's a certain violation of respect and so the scripture deals with it very clearly and this will coincide with my subject sunday on oneness and my series on oneness and i want to get into particulars here a little bit but in the marriage relationship and in the husband and wife relationship a godly husband or a god-man must with respect and honor look at the wife properly as being the wake your vessel but at the same time realizing that you're heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers may be not hindered so there is a violation of something that a husband can do by simply not looking at his wife with the right balance and thus brings dishonor uh because he uses the word honor excuse me use the word dwelling with them according to knowledge honoring of the white uses the word honor and as under the weaker vessel as being ears together so there's a oneness with god and there's a oneness with one another and that never changes even though her vessel is the weaker vessel so if a man does not look at that right he will not respect her right and thus his prayers to god will be hindered i'm not hearing any echoing amens in here but it's the truth nonetheless and so if we apply that to all relationships and that's what i'm speaking on relationships if we apply that now then we have to have an understanding of who each member in the body of christ is in order for the respect level to stay very high because if we lose respect then we've lost something in the sense of how we view that person everybody understand so then it goes on to say finally be of all one mind be ye of all one mind having compassion one of another love is brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil somebody did me wrong i'm gonna do them wrong back no no that's not what we do or railing for railing but contrary wise blessings so somebody does you bad we send them back a blessing oh wow knowing that ye there they're they're unto called you're they're too called that ye should inherit a blessing for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that speak no guile let him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it this is about relationships it's about relationships it's all about relationship we say well who with everybody this is how we christians view things and he says things like he that will love life how many how many love life and want to have a good life all right a few of us for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil what you say can be tied to the quality of life for what that he will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil so what we say is important and his lips from that they speak no guy let him eschew evil run from evil and do good let him seek peace if you want relationships we're the one that's always seeking peace reconciliation whatever we have to do can you say amen praise the lord father bless your word tonight as we administer it through your holy spirit may we step out of the way and be you use the gift that you've given me to feed your people and we ask it in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated tonight i want to just before i go into this subject tonight i want to go back and echo two points from sunday just in case if you're a preacher you understand sometimes um that you preach something and you say did i nail that down enough did i summarize that did i get to the point so i'm gonna echo so i feel better so i'm gonna echo a little bit a couple points that i preach sunday so that we understand when first of all when jesus gave his final words of what the church will do i talked about three or four of them when he left this earth at least in his physical body he gave instructions to the church he gave where the church will go and one of them was the great commission and i was i wanted to make the clear point that the commission was not just to certain believers it wasn't just to apostles the great commission of go into the world and preach the gospel and cast out devils and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that commission is to every holy ghost-filled believer there's no exceptions to it can you say amen so i wanted to make the point that another can another prophecy he gave for the church is what i'm preaching on is that when he said that they will receive my glory and they will become one with one another as we are one the father and the son they will become one with us excuse me not with us but with christ and they will become one with one another that's a prophecy but that's jesus prophesying this jesus saying this is what the church will become my point just like the great commission it's not just to certain ones to become one with one another it's all holy ghost-filled believers and whether we think it's going to happen or not it doesn't matter it's going to happen because jesus said it and if jesus said it that settles it so no matter how bad it looks he said i don't we're never going to come into unity in this in this message well it's just it seems so divided well that's looking in the negative side i'm looking at what jesus said and i'm looking at the local congregation more than even nationwide or worldwide let it start at home he said because of the glory coming into the church they will become one can you say amen so there's no exceptions you can't say well i don't have to participate in that even though i want to be a sunday morning christian at the church i don't have to pray no no this is by the holy ghost and if you say you have the holy spirit and the holy spirit's number one evidence that the evidence of the holy spirit is to believe the word from your heart forever for the age that you live in and if you believe that i believe every word then i just read to you jesus word for the church especially at the end time when it is the day of oneness he said at that day ye shall know i and the father i and you you and me at that day they will become one and under that revelation there are no exceptions to just certain people that's why i love what brother josiah preached a few weeks ago and the sermons have been coming along into jesus life and how he responded to people treating him bad and all these other things and a local level with family and a congregation we have to realize the holy ghost is trying to do something in us he's trying to work deeper in us and it never produces just an island to yourself i'll go to heaven and i don't need anybody else i'm sorry brother and sister it just doesn't work that way he said we would become one as him and the father were one can i get an amen the second echo i want to give from sunday is isaiah 53 and it was interesting to see someone had suggested to listen to brother donny from sunday morning he was on the same scripture as i was isaiah 53 making some wonderful points but here's the point i was making out of it is god was pleased and satisfied with the offering and the sacrifice of christ he was pleased that's the word he was pleased to see him bruised god was pleased he was satisfied with that sacrifice and why was god satisfied with that sacrifice why would god even be happy about suffering it's not it's not that we have a god that just says i love when people suffer i like to make people suffer no no that doesn't have anywhere where it's going but when he sees the sacrifice of christ laying down his life by his own choice can you say amen but here's why it's it is god is here's why he's pleased with it god is pleased and satisfied with the offering or sacrifice that dies to self in order to restore relationship and bring true oneness because christ in his suffering would bring many sons many sons to glory as well so god is satisfied because this decision that christ has made i'm satisfied i'm breathing this in this suffering this pain this thorn in his crown all these other things taken place god was satisfied why not just because of suffering this suffering restored relationship with god and man this suffering broke the middle walls of petition between us this suffering brought better relationship not just better but brought man back one with god this suffering would open a way for them to receive the actual holy ghost in their soul without calvary you had no place to receive the holy ghost but because somebody suffered it would burn out the sin it would burn out the defiling serpent nature and replace it with what the very nature of god and what happens when you have the nature of god in you you have the same nature as the author written in the word and you as the same nature as the other person sitting next to you that has the holy ghost that's how you can become one with them not because you agree on everything intellectually but because by the same nature if i have the nature of christ within me i don't have any problem being one with him because by nature i have been bonded and bonded is such a a just a very surface word to use in this this is a oneness that no man can achieve this is won by spirit i am one with him because i have his spirit within me tonight you talk about relationship that's not two spirits trying to get along that's becoming one because you are the same spirit that's why tonight i can say amen to the word of god that's why since 16 years old i have no problem saying him into the world to the to the word i have no problem with it something resonates with you every time you hear the word and even when i'm convicted i have no problem responding i trust it if if the word takes the height off of my back or encourages encourages me and i'm on cloud nine for the weak it doesn't matter there's an amender down here he put it there can you say man that's why i can say amen to the world there's no resistance down here my flesh sometimes says that's probably the way it sounds but but my soul is always saying that's hard in my flesh but it's a man amen that's me i love that that's me yes that's my husband christ i'm his wife and i say amen and i submit to that word there is no resistance in my soul because i've met the author and i have the author living in me so because god was satisfied with that sacrifice that was explained in isaiah 53 he was pleased to bruise him in order to restore relationship then we learn something that there is a suffering and sacrifice that is made when you want to make relationships better now let's let's just say this if you reach out christ-like and you go through prayer i want to reconcile i want to restore i want to see things reconciled in a relationship that's wrong and bad someone did me wrong whatever it is i did them wrong they may not always respond right right away did we all respond right away to the lord some did some right away but some of you man you took a long time and it was god's love that went to calvary for you it was god's love that wouldn't found you it was god's love reaching out to you when you were rebuked for for your earrings and your short dresses and your makeup and all this stuff and you came in the first service and the preacher just whipped all that stuff when you come in there you didn't feel you so much you didn't feel so much it was the love of god but yet if there's something within you that changes you can you say man and that's that's my husband talking sister uh there's a sister of her name on wendy sister lindsay she visits here she goes to brother um help me out over here in akron and she said that uh first service she went to and here she's in the world and everything and she went to here brother brother isaiah brooks and lima he was the pastor there at the time and the first service brother isaiah was on he was on the dress code and he was bringing out the message of what what a woman should wear what a man should wear he was just bringing it down the line and i think he's a little bit like me where that we don't preach that every service but this service he was going at it and he was he was doing it and that's the first service you come and a lot of times we christians were kind of cringing saying does it have to be this service you're going to run them away well probably 90 you'll run away but wendy sat there and she said she testifies everything he preached on i was wearing. and he doesn't know her but god knows her had that man come in you know i've had visitors come that are catholics and for some reason sometimes they come and visit and somebody will call me and say uh sometimes but sometimes they won't i don't know who's there and that's the service i just you know take apart the system of the catholic church and they're there and you're going oh oh no don't do it don't don't don't say it you know but there's been people delivered that's right all of a sudden sister wendy was delivered that night gave her heart to god wonderful sister full of the holy ghost so don't be afraid of this word don't be afraid because why it's not them intellectually changing it's a nature change and when the nature changes something says amen to the word of god and something lines up with the word of god they don't have a problem getting rid of the makeup they don't have a problem getting with the short skirts and the earrings what the word speaks against can i get an amen here tonight there's not a lot of amen sometimes even people around the message anymore it's still the word it's still the truth and when you have the nature of god you don't have a resistance in your soul to that it's amen sometimes it's ouch but there's an amen that says that's my husband speaking and he's telling me as a daughter of god what i wear not the magazines telling me what to wear they may not respond right that was my point i'm i'm still bringing my points from sunday and i haven't got my message tonight so this is a problem they may not respond right right away when you go for relationship and reconcile you some people don't respond right away to god how many years did it take some of you and god dealt with you and you're a little kid but now it's just later on finally you responded how many can raise your hand it was that way so in when when god's reaching out to restore a relationship he goes to calvary and he starts to move on you by the holy spirit and you it's not everybody that responds to being reconciled by right away so if that applies with god dealing with us it applies when we bring a christ-like spirit to say i'm going to sacrifice i don't want to be self-focused here i'm going to make right what i've done wrong but i want to have an open conversation with somebody and i want to talk to them i want to say to them listen is there anything i can do to make our relationship better is there anything i can do to restore what's been lost years ago is there anything that can be done and when you start asking questions like that and you start oh being open like that you may not always get the response back because the holy spirit has to do it in their life too but nevertheless christ reached out when while we were yet sinners christ died for us praise the lord all right now uh 7 46 i'm just beginning my sermon for tonight then if you're counting time i want to speak tonight shortly on oneness working in different vessels okay how does this work oneness working in different vessels because guess what we're all different vessels just like i bring out about the husband and wife and paul's addressing peter's addressing paul addressed it peter addressed it and he's talking about the differences in in husbands and wife and she even in her vessel in her vessel is the weaker vessel but how many know that she's not the weaker wrestle when it comes to spirit one with god and one with one another the oneness that's not a weaker vessel but the vessel itself that's a weaker vessel how many knows that so now i i want to talk about how oneness works in different vessels because you know we are all different vessels we are all different personalities your personality is not sin it's before i get into sin in person's life because sin when you cross over after the garden everything comes into relationships all relationships are broken down they don't have the potential anymore to be what they were in the garden of eden before jealousy comes in hatred comes in blaming comes in the glory of god departs from them there's nothing there to work off of as far as oneness with other people and your husband and wife it's gone it's gone that's why today without god without the glory of god it's difficult to hold a marriage together because he's the one that created marriage right and we don't have an understanding have the glory of god we're just working off an intellect and surviving basically but you see now there's something greater than surviving there's overcoming there's the glory of god and when it comes into our life then we have something getting us back so i'm not even in the next few weeks i'll get into the sin part because there are normal things that are happening still today in relationships that we're still calling normal but they're normal under after the fall and after sin okay and we're still doing some of those things because we've been taught that's normal but we've been taught by hollywood the movies you watched whatever you were taught and so it's ingrained in your system this is normal this is how i treat another person this is how i act this is how i respond but there were things that happened under the fall like blaming one another like jealousy like sin like like all those things came from the fall they didn't come from before the fall they came after and so now we need to look at whatever's happening under sin we need to at least say if i'm doing that wait a minute god you're teaching me this isn't normal this is an order to normal to be a rage of anger in front of my children and in a range of anger just yelling in their face and anger and belittling them and and and belittling their character let me tell you brother whoever you are or sister that's not normal that's not normal that's not normal behavior for a christian if you make a mistake bring it under the cross when when that's a pattern and it's broken relationships your whole your whole wife your whole life you need to really look at your experience with god because the glory of the lord would be changing that that's under the fall that's treatment of other relationships under the fall that's not when the glory of god comes in it begins to change how many remember that from sunday from glory to glory he's changing me so what's it changing the nature of the fall was the serpent nature all that came with it uh just all the separations all the break up all the broken relationship with god everything come from the fall now because of coward the glory of god comes back to his church comes in by the holy ghost and now we come into a process now of by nature saying i'm reversing god's saying i'm reversing all these patterns that broke relationship and you've got something within you that builds strong relationships by the holy ghost hallelujah you got something that reconciles relationship that's you you've got something what do i do i look to the word this is what i need to do in this situation what i do this person that hates me the word tells you what to do if you get rebellious to say i'm going to do it my own way i'm you know i'm going to no no no we're under the glory of god here and from glory and glory he's changing us can you say amen so now you know we're living in the day at that day you shall know i and the father i knew you and me them and one another oneness we're living in the day of oneness and intimacy with the lord please don't read that word intimacy wrong the world has made it the sexual experience or whatever intimacy is a complete open relationship without walls there's no hindrances there's no walls we're living in the day being restored back to true oneness with god in one another and true intimacy with god and with one another no walls a relationship without walls you know friends and that's that's the revival that i'm looking for in our lives people talk about revival taking god this that and i'm i rejoice in any rejoicing of the word of god i mean if god chan whatever god can change the atmosphere in any service and do whatever he wants to do but if you want to know your pastor what kind of revival he's looking for i'm looking for a revival to come to the true oneness it's a revival to me when someone truly forgives another christian when believers come into oneness and die to themselves i'm wondering after sunday's service i wonder how many brothers went down and sat with their families this week and said after what was preached i'd like to sit down and talk with you and i'd like to have an open relationship how many brothers did it to their wives i'm not saying you had to do it i'm just wondering what effect this is having because we can not in church all we want to but if we are serious with god then we say now i'm going to be open with my family with my wife and i'm going to say what can i do to make the relationship better what have i done is there any walls up here that we can tear down so satan quits getting the glory i'm not saying that to be because probably most didn't do it and i'm not putting you down with that but i'm asking you is that what are we taking from this series in relationships to go ahead and go the way of calvary and the cross and say i'm going to go the suffering in the hard way a way that god's pleased with because if there is a reconciling a relationship at the end of it god is satisfied if that's a suffering thing to do god is satisfied praise the lord i think it's a revival when someone forgives someone when believers come into oneness and die to themselves for a greater oneness in their marriage and family and others that's also what jesus said the church would come to not just the great commission not just casting out devils not just if they drink any deadly thing not just they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he said they will become one as we are one that's part of the end time revival can i get an amen tonight don't forget oneness is a part of the end time revival it's not just laying on hands it's not just healing lines that's all part of it the supernatural needs to show himself in the church of god a book of acts church repeated again can you say amen friends but don't forget the book of acts church it wasn't just all miracles when someone lied to the holy ghost they got in trouble for it don't forget the book of acts church they sold all their goods because they were trying to meet the need in someone else there was other things working in the book of acts church and jesus said at the end they will become one as we are one that's the revival that i am looking for and this word i believe will produce it can you say amen now i wanted to say here that god created us a relational being in the beginning god created you a relational being what do you believe what do you where'd you get that it is not good for man to be alone and i use man not just in the sense of the brothers but the sisters because remember they were together as one spirit masculine feminine right so then he says it is not good then he puts him in two vessels then then he has adam there it is not good for man to be alone so he begins the process of taking the feminine part out they've never lost their one not oneness because when he took her out he said and they too shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife and the two shall be won so the oneness hasn't been broken there's still one in spirit but now their vessels are different okay and so god has created us a relational being it is not good for man to be alone if man is detached from relationship with others of his kind it's not good and it's not of god if someone would say i don't need anybody i don't need friends all friends have hurt me i don't need any friends anymore i don't need people i had a fellow tell me one time years ago he says i want to come to your church but he says i really don't want to be around the people i want to come and hear the preaching and get in my car and head home i don't need people and he's already off track and doesn't know his bible because christ is living in his people something's wrong with that picture and i mean you don't have to be bffs with everybody but it's the body of christ it's not even bff it's not even best friends forever no it's it's the body of christ if you have the holy ghost they have the holy ghost you're one with them and you can't go in this thing and says i can be on my own an island you can't do that because god made you a relational being he said it is not good for you to be alone god made us a relational being it's not just about marriage we know we apply that to marriage and read it at weddings that's not good for man to be alone so thus he brought and helped mate and that suffice the marriage but look at the picture now it's not good for man to be alone he made us a relational being so the great one of the greater fellowships is to have someone that's a companion in life there's nothing not a thing wrong with that desire it's a wonderful desire god put that desire within you the problem i have as a pastor is people don't approach it the right way and they get the wrong partner in life you need to pray pray pray pray you need to pray until the lord shows you the character of the word in a guy or girl and you need to build a strong foundation for a good marriage ahead of time and that is you're very close to the lord you have the holy ghost both are very close to the lord have the holy ghost and then you reach to that desire to have a husband or wife no problem whatsoever praise the lord god put it there i didn't put it there and i wouldn't try to take it out of you praise the lord you want a companion for life i don't care if you're 40 years old don't stop giving giving up hope her name might even be hope don't stop giving don't start giving up now there's nobody for me no no don't you if you have that desire then you pray and god you might still end up being 50 but you still might find what god has for you and it'll be more about companionship then it'll just be man god's finally gave me my companion we've had it here in the church one thing is just don't be in a hurry at young ages to form this without the maturity in your life because i'm all about meeting the need of a husband or wife but i'm all totally against of doing it out of lust or doing it too quickly or doing it when you don't know what the character of the word is yet yourself praise the lord amen brother paul amen amen amen if someone says i don't need nobody i don't need friends you're denying the way god made you it's the thirst god put in us for fellowship for companionship for friendship this intimacy of wanting a relationship without walls god put that within us wanting relationships without any walls is a thirst god put in us to have that type of relationship with people is the cry of every heart the whole world they even crave for it they want it so bad and look at all those as i said sunday who marry and have a tragic terrible divorce and a few years later sometimes within months they marry again why because there's a craving for fellowship i don't want to be alone so then they go on to the next person without the holy ghost they probably might marry the wrong person the next time too you see so it's all about the craving on the inside and going to god and remember it wasn't adam walking around saying god it's not good for me to be alone god it's not good for me to i need a wife adam wasn't crying saying i need a wife he had something within him that god could see how do you know what a wife was how did he know where the helpmate was he didn't but there was there was a craving on the inside but it was adam walker's son need a wife i need a wife need a wife no he was focused on what god gave him to do in his kingdom he was focused on that but there's god that come and said adam it's not good for you to be alone you're looking at all these animals and there's a male part and female part they have fellowship they have companionship all these other things and now my son is alone it's not good i'm going to provide help mate for you god is the one that orchestrated god was the wedding coordinator god made the pre-plans thank you thank you elaine praise the lord i got an amen from lane so this intimacy is a thirst to have that type of relationship with people is a cry of every heart we start with this pure thirst within us for intimacy and for closeness with somebody problem is as soon as we start getting close we realize that there is not a human being on earth that can properly be that kind of friend because the human race is fallen and in this particular age most of us never a person or a world without the holy spirit you're going to go through damaged relationships and it's going to make you disbelieve that god can fulfill that desire we have this pure craving for intimacy and closeness with somebody and then we get burnt don't forget it's a burnt world don't forget it's a fallen world don't forget that human beings do not have it within them without the lord to give that type of relationship back and so now if you have if you have something real and you try to connect on that type of intimacy besides the lord with someone else if they don't have the same thing it it can never be right they can't give you what you're looking for the human being can't fill that without god amen you can have companionship you can feel clothes all these other things but the real intimacy of relationship without walls and there's such a oneness there nothing would ever tear you apart that comes from god he can and that's why he said about the marriage god said jesus said excuse me jesus said when he was here on earth he said what god hath joined together no man can put asunder that's pretty strong if you orchestrated it things can tear it apart but if god was in it then there's that oneness can you say amen and what god has put together let no man put asunder there's such a bond it goes beyond any of the best super glue you could ever talk about it's a bond can you say man it's a it's it's it's for life can you say amen and then what about relationship with christ paul said he said there's nothing present there's nothing in the future there's no death nothing can separate me from the love of god that's in jesus christ praise the lord so now we start to look for this pure thirst the spirit there's of this intimacy problem is as soon as we start getting close real close we realize there's not a human being on earth that can probably be that kind of friend because the human race has fallen especially in this age most of us never had balances balanced images of relationships most of us come from a generation that never seen too many balanced uh images of relationships how many would admit to that most of us did not come from normal balanced relationships in jesus christ most of this generation didn't see them so if you haven't seen what's normal then you better be a good student to the lord you better be in class every day you better give the teacher an apple and say i am all ears to learn what true relationships are and how they're normal in the kingdom of god i want to be married you better be a real sponge soaking in what the word says or what a marriage is because if you've watched too many disney things and too many movies and too many chick flicks and you have been on social media and you've watched the movie stars how they go from wife to wife to wife and husband to husband and husband within sometimes hours if you watch britney spears uh married in vegas and break it up the next day you your mind's been messed up and you gotta have say lord wash all that out of my mind and you better become a student that's sitting at jesus feet giving him an apple saying i want to learn what real relationships are can i get an amen out of somebody here tonight you better be a teacher before you have someone you want to get close to first be a student and have her teacher say i need to learn because i've been hindered by this generational decline of true relationships you say well i had a good mom and dad and even without the lord and brother brahm commented so what about these marriages with that lord praise the lord they come to a oneness they're committed to each other it can happen it can happen but it can never be fully right brother bram says never be fully right without christ because he's the one that come up with marriage so it can't be the holy spirit oneness it's just a human oneness it's a human coming together and being committed to one another praise the lord we have some of those but for the most part we're at about 60 divorce rate in our nation about 60 percent divorce rate so people don't understand the true image of marriage you don't understand it you say well i understand it i've been in the message all my life well don't be so sure be a student say lord teach me and i say we should be settled in our relationship with our lord and our families before we pursue one with someone else most of us never see balanced images of relationships we have been damaged in our spirit so much we can't feel it for someone else we can't get what like it get it like we want it we can't give it like we want so we can't get what we want and we can't give what we want until we have this glory of the lord by the holy ghost come in our lives and when that comes in we have something to work off of that he can change me and teach me what true normal relationship is in all relationships but it's in us we're built for it so we approach life with this innocence wanting in this intimacy but we get dis disappointed so quickly and some get so down they become bitter and they close themselves and they won't even try anymore because they have stopped believing there is such a thing as being real close friends and close relationship with no fences people have stopped believing it so they don't even try it anymore they you and when you do you lose your freedom in life you're not free the quality of life is tied to the quality of our relationships not how much we own not how many trucks we have not how big a house we have you could have the loveliest house and inside the relationships are the walls are all up and it's just bitterness can i get an amen tonight you can have the nicest cars you can have all the money in the world there's a lot of people have a lot of money and they have zero relationship there there's no connection with their children there's no connection with their wife they're just existing together there's some message homes where there's marriages just existing together because they are too embarrassed to get a divorce that's wrong divorce but they live in hell every day i said they live in hell every day because they're not willing to go the way of calvary to get to a better relationship through the holy ghost and through the glory of god they sit there for years miserable saying we're married we're married but it's a miserable situation all kinds of walls up there's about 10 subjects you'd never talk about why in a marriage is the subject you can't talk about there shouldn't be any subjects you can't talk about we have this cry and the quality of life i know some might disagree with this but i'm going to say the quality of life is tied to the quality of our relationships number one with the lord no relationship can be written without the lord so the quality of life is the quality of the closeness that we feel to the lord can i get an amen the quality of life is based upon the quality of relationships and it's not just the lord but it's with one another because if we can develop some quality relationships with one another by the holy ghost and friendships that are based upon the word of god i got a friend out here i got a friend over here in college and all that well that's great but the more you lean towards that is it's not going to be good for you because there's only so much connection you can wait but the friendships you need to form is if you're saying you've got this glory and holy ghost in you you need to form friendships with another member that has the same holy ghost and there's where you find fulfillment of true friendships can i you're quiet tonight but i i believe you're catching it amen so the quality of life is tied to the quality of our relationship that's why we want to say pray and say lord how can i make it better what can i do lord what what path can i go down i might be suffering for a while i might open up a conversation a person just get mad and cuss me out i don't know but lord i'm i'm so willing because i want to go the extra mile to make relationships better i want to tear the walls down myself and do everything i can it's always will be the cry that is within us will always be there it will always be there no matter how much you deny it and say it's not there there is a thirst for good relationships amen and there's one way we can approach this as as we preach sunday selfishly can't be so focused can't be all about you some people on social media it's all about three people me myself and i thank you jayden for posting all of my pictures every day this week if i knew you're gonna do that then i want a little bit more if i'm gonna use your phone again in a service i'm gonna have a lot more control over what happens he took it monday tuesday wednesday thursday and friday and today was the worst one and he posted them every day just to show i'm all about myself right we'll watch you boy but um it's a self-focused world and there are venues to feed your self-focused thing so much work that's to be said about it i've got article after article that shows after all these years of social media they say this is mainly what it's all about people are craving attention craving praise and they're willing to do anything even alter the photographs now i didn't do that those are real photographs i am that good looking jaden but people will spend money to alter the photographs and make them look skinny and all of that that's how there's a craving to be accepted to be appraised to get the likes oh you are like a movie star babe man wow you're something it's this craving to be accepted this craving to be loved to be praised for who they are and all the while they said here's what the articles say disappointment after disappointment they actually go into depression teenage girls going depression because why it's never enough even if you got 10 likes it's not enough lust is never satisfied you all know that right that's the thing with luck there's no another never a final satisfaction with lust you're just looking for the next thing you want the next thing whether it's sexual or whatever it is if you do one thing you're looking for the next thing because lust is never satisfied it never satisfies in here so you're looking for what's next what's next what because lust is never satisfied genuine love in the lord divine love there's some satisfaction there and so now when you have relationships going on then you have to realize when when we begin to become hurt by these things we have to be careful because we don't want to lose what god puts within us that there are true good healthy uh godly relationships that we can have both for marriage and everywhere else but we can't do it selfishly that i want my needs met first people say when i am happy then i then i'll do things to make others happy we can't do that some people come into a room say until i'm happy nobody's allowed to be happy amen everybody see anybody like that if i'm having a bad day that everybody gets to have a bad day if i if you all don't make me happy in some way then i'm not going to do anything to make you happy so opposite of laying down your life you know and that's the thing you might as well say it about church what is this thing you you listening online and you hear tonight what is this thing where we go through something depressive and we go through a loss or something like that and the first thing that goes is you dump out i don't want to go to church you can go to walmart you can go to all your shows on your phone to escape into it what is this thing that when we hit depression i don't need anybody i don't need to go to church now now that's when you need to be encouraged that's when you need to be corrected that's when you need a fresh water to draw you out of your depression what is this and then you go another path i'm just going to block everybody out i don't need anybody and that's when you're really saying if i'm not happy then i'm not going to do anything else to make someone ha and the truth is it's the other way around there's actually true joy in giving when you don't get it back you know i went over there to the gas station sometime and see this this young girl and i can tell she's got you know three kids in the car she's putting in five dollars in the tank that's i know she's just barely making it to get to her job and and and i don't say this to both but sometimes i just go in there and i go up and i put my card in and i fill that tank for her do you know there's great joy in doing that and you make your account suffer and someone else gets happy because of it you see in the kingdom of god it's the other way around it's when we give unselfishly that we find satisfaction in life you're coming into a marriage and you look at what she can do for me or what he can do for me and she can meet my needs and i can meet her you're coming in for the wrong reason you're going and saying how can i how can i make this girl or guy's life better by my sacrificial to make them closer to the lord how can i make them a better christian it's not about your needs so until i'm happy nobody gets to be happy some pursue happiness others create happiness is this okay tonight says some pursue happiness and they're always pursuing it but they never get to it others create it there are two types of people givers and takers many times the takers are mooching off the givers all the time but it's the givers that seem to have the real happiness in life can you say amen it is the givers that find the true satisfaction in life it is the givers in a marriage that find the true satisfaction that you're going to do everything you can to meet their needs and get to know them in our marriage things that we talk about five needs of a woman five needs of a man that's the basic needs in both but yet there's other individual needs as you get to know that person and your lifelong perceive pursuit precede pursuit is to meet that person's need i'm living so that i can try to meet their needs and he's living to meet her needs that's when it's unselfish giving that's when you have happiness not when you're coming and saying will they meet my needs will they meet my needs and they never fully will and you set yourself up for disappointment now let's go into the prophet's message in this quote and oneness it says the word this this is some foundational things that i thought were amazing as we come into the subject more and more of oneness all right and this is what a great message oneness the word oneness means to be one with the word oneness means to be one with oneness united and now this is quite a subject and it deserves a lot more attention than i am able to give it and more than most any person on earth could able to give it so you can see where i'm at tonight this desert deserves a lot of tension and more attention that he was able to give it and more than any other person on earth it's pretty important subject but i would like to express it to you my opinion of it and with what god will give us later on in the a few paragraphs later the first man the first woman in the garden even was perfect harmony with god so much that god could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with adam and eve now that is perfect oneness god in his creation god speaking lip to ear with adam and eve and they were so perfect in harmony with god till they were one with god god and his family was one any man and his family a correct good noble obedient family is one with one another any family and if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family is broken somewhere they should all be one father with mother mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement praise the lord and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture that's god's purpose if you're not there tonight you say i'm not going to listen to the devil i'm going to say brother brahman said that's god's purpose and if it's in my inheritance i'm going to go for it that's god's purpose and his purpose as father supreme was to be one with his family earthly family adam and eve and the only way they could be one with family or with god was because god's nature was in them the only way you can truly be one is god's nature was in them that's that's the only way moves on later in the sermon a few paragraphs later he says and if you'll notice how that eve was united with adam she become a part of him god did you notice in genesis 1 27 he created man male and female created he them now the man was both male and female when it come to being in the spirit of feminist and masculine then god took his side a rib did you notice the part body part was by a byproduct but not the spirit the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished god took from the so the original creation eve was in adam they were one in spirit all right then i'm just taking it as brother brahm says it here then god took then god took from the side of rib did you notice the body part was a byproduct but not the spirit the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished god took from the side of adam a rib and made a woman but not the spirit the spirit was part of adam for he was both male man and woman uh feminine spiritually speaking both masculine and finished so before he separated him adam was both masculine and feminine now don't you see what this see the great picture we now he goes to us we in flesh are different we're like a byproduct a created being by holy wedlock but in spirit we are sons and daughters not some other spirit but the spirit of the living god now in that revelation in those words as simple as they are friends you will find the answer to oneness and relationships like never before to realize when i look at that person if it's a person with the holy ghost their flesh is a byproduct their flesh is different their personality is different but in spirit we're one it's a different way to look at it because if you get to looking at the flesh you'll start acting wrong towards them because you see their flesh you see how different they are than you so just hold on to that all right so in the garden i'm just trying to figure out now what to jump out of here and uh finish up so we'll have to pick it up next wednesday lord willing in the garden there was perfect oneness let me just move on because i've got to some of this already they were the same image and the nature of god but then god separated the vessels that's why i read to this scripture that the the husband give honor to the wife as the weaker vessel but you're heirs together so you're still one in spirit one with god by the holy ghost your heirs together with that there is no levels in that of weaker and stronger right it's all um it's all one spirit but yet in flesh she's a weaker vessel so now if he gets to dishonoring that and looking at her too much of the weaker vessel and belittling that and she gets to belittling him it's interesting thing about our culture because them not having the revelation that the man and woman should become one they're only looking at flesh when they get married and so now what we've had in our culture for all these years is the the women um belittling the men all the way from the movie the the the uh sitcom i love lucy you'll watch little traits there of i love lucy you watch him belittling uh whoever her husband was there ricky thank you brother daniel i see you've watched a lot of those grew up on that probably um ricky so now if you watch this look there's not much of it but there's little traces of her as the women's liberation moving starts to move in 40s and 50s even the spirit of it and she's giving these little belittling comments to some of the ways he is and all that's happening is they're capitalizing on the differences of a man and woman how they look at stuff how they see stuff and so now that was never supposed to bring a divide it was supposed to be respected and honored that's the way god made her in her feminine way that's the way god made him but now all of a sudden now she's looking at his rough ways and look where we're at speed ahead 70 years look at the belittling of men so much so that brother branham says that men are turned into homosexuality because there's such a dishonor to woman and there's been such also a dishonor to man he doesn't even know his place anymore because he's been so belittled for being a man do you understand he has been so put down for being a man he doesn't even know how to and he's scared to be a man to stand up and be a man he's a follower and not a man to stand up for truth and stand up for conviction stand up for the word of god god give us more young men like that girls are looking for them holy ghost girls are looking for them but you see the the culture the generation has tore down that man tore down that man and belittled the way that god made him so much that he just he's scared to be himself then he becomes feminine he's lost himself so much he begins to question i must not be a man then so i have to be a woman to be accepted in this society because that's who's made an idol is the woman lost his way he's lost his way so you got that going on but then you kind of see this shifting a little bit too where now the women are belittled the women are belittled for their nature and the way that they are and the the way god made them so man everything begins to break down but when i was bringing it the two vessels were separated god put the mask into one effeminate in the other i brought out some things about their differences and i'm not going to have the time to bring them all back up here tonight but there's one writer i wanted to read some of these differences because i want the young people and marriages here to understand here's what i want you to understand is that god had this marriage as an image on earth to show what the image would be of a bride and christ coming together in oneness and we would be a different vessel of course and we would have to respond to the lord but in this vessel we would have to have a oneness by nature with him but then there has to be an honor like a husband and wife she's one with you and in her inheritance with christ but she is the weaker vessel so he says that if the husband gets off track here and he starts to look at her and belittle her for her being the weaker vessel too much and i'm not talking about talking with one another i'm talking about belittling it you're a lesser specie of human being that's not the word it's not the word it's it's really funny how as i said the world shifts to belittling men and then sometimes in the circles of christianity and in the circles sometimes in our groups and i might have to hold this i want to make sure i say it just right i don't want to offend but sometimes in our groups i watch an overly belittling of the woman in our ranks and the man is here and the woman is here that's my most polite way of saying that and he's always believed as the truth-giver and we have to question everything she says because remember eve was the one that fell in the garden but i want to remind you that calvary is restoring us back to oneness not the woman that should become a women's liberal it's not that she's not under subjection to her husband i'm not saying that i'm just saying in spirit when a man catches a revelation and you've got an honorable godly wife you're going to celebrate the way god made her as feminist different and you're not going to belittle those difference as she's a lesser species of human being because that's not the word and that's not the message can i get an amen so essentially in the world we got a belittling of men but sometimes in our ranks we've got a belittling of women too much so and it just all accumulates where there's a dishonor going on for the woman there's a dishonor going for on for the man there's a dishonoring of women sometimes in our own rank and it it it has fruits to it i'll tell you friends it has some fruit to it that i haven't enjoyed watching through the years in our in some of our groups maybe we can talk about that more at another time but this writer says men aren't from mars women aren't from venus they're the same species from the same planet but the sexes certainly aren't the same exactly the same the differences between men and women are real important real and important this from a medical point of view they serve biological functions and can even help you better understand your health and needs when you know understand these differences these differences give each sex unique strengths that help with the most important task survival there are differences in the way male and female brains are structured how they process information and interact with chemical signals some examples men are more information containing gray matter but women have more white matter which connects different parts of the brain also women have bigger memory centers than men men are less sensitive to cold temperatures women have better senses of smell and taste okay that's why they come into the house there's something that smells bad in here and then she's trying to find out who it is tracking it down women they have 50 more cells neurons in their olfactory bulbs the part of the brain responsible for processing smells that's why they're that way women also usually have more taste buds than men the differences in the way in men men and women see the world are partly physical on average men are more likely to be colorblind but their eyes also sense movement better women are able to distinguish small difference in color and color better one thing you shouldn't do is use the differences between men and women to make a case that one sex is somehow better than the other one thing you shouldn't do is use the differences between men and women marriages have used the differences to justify terrible terrible bitter battles and a lot of times we know sin is in the picture and i'll get to that later not tonight but just sometimes the differences in male and female or female can bring such a divide that they're ready to call it quits and all it is is the differences in how god made them and it's not celebrated it's belittled brother ziada when you see those things as i was talking about adam starting to see those things in his wife when you start to see those things you ought to just step back before you act too quickly because if you start belittling it and you don't have a revelation that's really a part of me she's another part of me that's where you come to oneness is this honor and respect and throughout the history of human beings he finishes the differences have helped men and women survive i'm just say this again now through the history of human beings the differences if when they're looked at right can actually have helped men and women survive mostly working together amen that's the goal isn't it working together making life better there's no int living for the key part of each other love one another we can handle any kind of weather working together that was written by paula fontaine when they sell it when they celebrate these things and these are just biological mostly there's i said 200 differences or more emotional when these things are capitalized so here's my point i've got to move on that's adam and eve and maybe we'll get to that further my point is to look at that marriage and look at how we see that clearly god makes every one of us different not the sin part but he makes everyone in the body of christ different and that's why paul picks it up in first corinthians 12 and says we're a body and the hand cannot say to the foot i have no need of thee because you're not important you can't do it so does paul pick it up yeah he's picking up this idea that we're all in our personalities different we're not talking about sin yet we'll get into that but we're talking about the the subject tonight is that how does this oneness work when it's in different vessels and i'll just conclude by saying this in this point the utmost honor and respect for the other is because they are one if you don't know you are one you will never respect properly they are less than you in some part in your thinking if you do not have a revelation of oneness that you are one whether it's with the body of christ or your husband or wife wherever it is if you don't have that revelation you will dishonor and respect them too much and break the relationship you understand you will never respect properly and especially in a marriage unless you understand oneness and how god has made you one you hurt her you're hurting yourself you hurt him you're hurting yourself and if you have that disrespect they are less than you in some part of your thinking then they shouldn't be less than you they should be a part of you now let me end by saying this i was out early this morning and uh we're having a lot of birds come around um our house now a lot of different kinds of bird we put some feeders out and this is getting fun guinea and i especially are enjoying it in the mornings we're all enjoying it because we're getting a lot of i was down at brother jim and sister julie's house last year and man they got it down pat because just sitting there 10 minutes in their living room i seen birds i'd never seen before coming to their back porch now it's happening to us and we're getting some of the most beautiful birds unique birds and my thought this morning as i went into this tonight we serve a god a variety he hasn't made any of us the same you know they're all they all maybe got beaks and they all maybe got some things that similar but there's some things that are very different on those birds the woodpecker the other birds probably don't tap on the tree you know and put holes in the tree but the woodpecker he's built for that so people are built for different things they're doing different things one bird could be critical and this is what i get out of watching all these birds one bird could be critical and say what is he up there doing holes in the tree for what a waste of time you know that's just the way he is that's the way he's made and so i'm watching the uniqueness and i'm saying lord you have made us and that's just the bird kingdom look at all of god king god's kingdom and he never makes anything just cookie cutter the same the beauty of it the colors of it it's so beautiful so and there's strange ones and there and then i got to thinking how i've got some strange birds living in the house do with me i did i got to thinking i won't mention names but i got some strange birds the lord gave me in my own household i've got and sometimes even angry birds is that okay yeah that's a game if you want to play it i got these unique birds and then god sends me a son-in-law he's he's a strange bird too he's different very different than the fontaine's all this is for to reflect god's glory and what he's going to do if we're to come to oneness as families in a church and in christ we're going to have to get over the fact that we're trying to make that person in personality like us that god made them the way that they are for a reason now i'm not talking about sin yet sin is a different story okay if it's a sin in an individual and a serpent nature god has to deal with that and there's a lot of ugliness that comes out of sinful creatures it's all there is to it but i'm not talking about i'm just talking about differences that are not sin but we make them sin we make them i will not be i'm putting up my walls i'm never speaking to that person again you can't do that if just god made them a different personality you're not allowed to do that because god's a god a variety and i wanted to read you something as we close tonight i know i've been a little long for a wednesday night but i want you to look at this picture because this this was really neat not only does god have a variety in nature but some there's there's oneness expressed in nature and one example of all the oneness and nature they come together with all their differences they can come together in a oneness now if birds can do it human beings can do it by the holy ghost can i get an amen tonight there's sometimes oneness is expressed in the animal kingdom where they come together and an example is is the canadian geese as the geese take flight from the canadian shoreline they lift off from the water in a squawking discourse yet in the matter of seconds a line begins to emerge from the mass of brown feathers this line straightens arches slightly and then as on cue bends sharply to form a perfect v-shape canada geese fly in v formation for a very pragmatic reason a flock of geese flying in formation can move faster and maintain flight longer than anyone goose flying alone on his own can everybody say amen all right do i need to read it again a flock of geese flying in formation can move faster and maintain flight longer than any one goose flying alone synergy is a law of nature what is synergy how does it relate to leadership we have a lot to learn from these geese and i'm going to read you about six things and i'm closing i promise by flying in v formation i like v why that's great that's victory they're flying together to get the victory can you say amen flying in a v formation the whole flock adds at least 71 percent greater flying range than if each bird flew on its own praise the lord well i got happy about it anyway whenever a goose falls out of formation it suddenly feels the drag and resistance of trying to go it alone and quickly gets back into formation to take advantage of the lifting power of the bird immediately in front of it this happens this happens next one when the lead goose gets tired he rotates back in the wing and another goose flies point you know they didn't read any textbooks on this it's all instinct these geese honk from behind to encourage those up front to keep their speed that's why i love it every sunday morning and some wednesday nights when i hear some honks from the audience you know just for what you did to me let me know what a honk sounds like from a geese right now what's a honk come on your best honk no your best one real loud no you you pay back time yep how does the geese honk let me hear it that's the best you got all right is it did i did i embarrass you enough not really so it's coming still coming okay let me finish this these geese honk from behind to encourage those up front to keep their speed finally when don't laugh too much i'll make you all honk finally when a goose gets sick listen to this now this is powerful when a goose gets sick or is wounded by gunshot and falls out two geese fall out of the formation and follow him down to help and protect him they stay with him until he is either able to fly or until he is dead and then they launch out on their own or with another formation until they catch up with the group with their group man you see god oneness oneness is in nature can you say amen variety is in nature do you love the lord tonight amen i hit that at the end that goose thing and you didn't respond good enough so i'm going to preach it probably the next sunday i preach in there i'm going to go over it again there's too much in there to preach about that's too good amen let's stand together tonight let's give the lord a handclap of praise amen god is good all the time praise the lord let's pray together tonight our precious lord we thank you for this time that we've had we pray lord the things that that you have given us would be beneficial and edifying to the body of christ whoever should hear and lord we humbly ask you to help us to be better christians and better relational christians lord that we could find the keys and be led so much by the holy ghost change from glory to glory that lord we would love so deeply love like we've never been hurt before love and take the risk of loving someone that not being loved back and lord that we could have in the future better relationships in our families and our extended families and lord church brothers and sisters that are here but most of all father above all things that we could be in a close relationship with you we could get into that formation of that v lord as we fly together and we can work together like the man says about the husband and wife not making their differences something to fight over but actually working together and actually to for survival and not just survival but to overcome in this age working together strengthen the body of christ strengthen the people of this assembly all those who are listening lord in their relationships make them better by the holy ghost i pray make them more humble lord to one another make them more forgiving to one another lord may the forgiveness and the repentance and the the breaking down of walls that's in the holy ghost let it go forward and do its work in many families i know there's some family suffering some marriages suffering even right now in our assembly lord i've seen some of those things in those patterns and habits lord i pray you'll break those habits father may this conviction of the holy spirit just break every hard heart lord that's what you said is the reason divorce came is moses gave you a writing a divorcement he gave you permission for it but the reason was it because of your hard hearts lord help us not to have hard stony hearts towards any one father break us down lord and make us gentle and humble and loving lord to one another make us willing lord to break down walls that are there maybe for years and to sit down with one another and say i just want to see if anything can be done and then i could be a better in a better relationship with you we love you father we know that when the word is preached if we don't see the results tonight we will see the seed and the word blossom and it will not return void so i'm praying a revival in these things as well that there'd be better and better and better oneness between your people and between you and us lord by the holy ghost continue your work and let it be done i pray in jesus name we ask it
