[0:00] said we want to give the Lord time if we
[0:02] can't give him time speak to us then we
[0:05] we have something different going on we
[0:07] just want to give him all the glory and
[0:10] we want to give him he had time for us
[0:12] to go to Calvary he had time for us so
[0:15] we had time for him this morning second
[0:17] Corinthians chapter 2
[0:19] and verse 11.
[0:22] I'm just there's just the whole section
[0:24] of scriptures but I'm just reading one
[0:26] for time's sake and this is the only
[0:28] thought that I wanted to get to
[0:30] Paul says lest Satan should get an
[0:33] advantage of us
[0:36] for we are not ignorant of his devices
[0:43] it's a good scripture for what I just
[0:45] talked about
[0:49] let me read that again I didn't tie that
[0:51] to get together until just now
[0:54] lest Satan should get an advantage of us
[0:57] for we are not ignorant of his devices
[1:02] amen father bless your word today and
[1:06] may you stir up Lord the Holy Ghost
[1:08] within the people and if they don't have
[1:10] that father I pray you'll give them the
[1:12] new birth this morning they would yield
[1:14] their lives completely to you we
[1:16] Believers don't want to live lukewarm or
[1:19] even cold you said Lord you'd rather
[1:22] have us either hot or cold not lukewarm
[1:24] but Lord you would rather have us
[1:26] burning with the fires of the Holy
[1:28] Spirit In Our Lives I pray it be so
[1:30] bless this word today in the name of the
[1:32] Lord Jesus Christ we ask him amen once
[1:35] you shake somebody's hand before you're
[1:37] seated today God bless you in the
[1:40] blessing of the Lord
[1:43] now I want to take a subject this
[1:45] morning a short subject and talk along
[1:48] the lines of this scripture and we've
[1:51] been in much prayer spent the entire day
[1:53] yesterday telling the Lord we are
[1:56] completely and totally Available to You
[1:59] Lord the entire day no distractions
[2:01] nothing talked about a half hour with
[2:04] these precious young people that want to
[2:06] be baptized just popped over to the
[2:08] church and talked to them they were very
[2:10] receptive to the things we said in the
[2:12] instruction but other than that we just
[2:14] been before the Lord
[2:15] so we want to speak a little bit on this
[2:18] scripture and also one in the Old
[2:20] Testament so Paul expresses here that
[2:25] the way things that are supposed to be
[2:28] in a Christian walk and that is uh the
[2:32] normal way in a Christian believer's
[2:34] Life is that Satan should not have the
[2:37] advantage over us
[2:39] we know it should be the other way
[2:42] around that we should always have the
[2:44] advantage over Satan
[2:47] and and so he expressed as the less
[2:50] Satan should and if you want to read
[2:52] this week uh the preliminary scriptures
[2:54] and what led up to him saying that is
[2:56] actually based upon forgiveness and
[2:58] forgiving one another and forgiving a
[3:00] man who sinned in the church in First
[3:01] Corinthians he sinned and that he was
[3:04] openly coming to church still and taking
[3:06] communion and it was sinning and so they
[3:08] weren't dealing with it they were
[3:09] immature they weren't dealing with the
[3:10] sin in the count and so he rebuked them
[3:12] in First Corinthians and said deliver
[3:14] one up and deal with that sin while they
[3:16] dealt with it and the boy repented and
[3:19] then now he's talking about restoring
[3:21] him and bringing him back and forgiving
[3:22] him and if you forgive him then we'll
[3:24] forgive him so he's in that subject and
[3:26] then he comes we want him he says we
[3:28] want to make sure that's all clear lest
[3:30] Satan should get an advantage of us for
[3:33] we are not ignorant of his devices Satan
[3:36] is not to have an advantage in a
[3:37] believer's life we're not called for him
[3:41] to take advantage of us we're not called
[3:44] for the devil to slap us around we're
[3:46] not called called for the devil to bully
[3:49] us we're not called for the devil to
[3:51] intimidate us
[3:52] [Applause]
[3:53] can I get an amen this morning we're not
[3:56] called for the devil to slap us around
[3:58] and take advantage of us and intimidate
[4:01] us and I I'm reminded of a quote that
[4:04] says overcoming means recognizing the
[4:07] devil at every one of his tricks in
[4:09] other words we want to live a life
[4:11] that's such ahead of the game that even
[4:13] before he brings the Temptation we know
[4:16] what it is we know the path that Satan's
[4:18] going down we know what trap he's trying
[4:20] to bring us in I would like to be able
[4:22] to live I'm just speaking to my wife the
[4:24] other day and was talking about the
[4:25] blood of Jesus Christ and I said hun it
[4:28] has to be two sides of the blood of
[4:29] Jesus Christ that it has the power to
[4:32] forgive us when we make a mistake how
[4:35] many believe it has the power to forgive
[4:37] us when we make a mistake how many is
[4:39] glad for that power but we also know
[4:41] there's another side in the blood of
[4:43] Jesus Christ and that is it has the
[4:45] power in it to protect us and keep us
[4:48] from sin and so many churches only
[4:51] preach this side of it that he forgives
[4:53] us when we sin but they Don't Preach
[4:55] enough on the other side that it's
[4:56] powerful enough to even keep us and
[4:59] protect us from sin
[5:02] best case scenario is we're living close
[5:04] to the Lord and there's less and less
[5:06] mistakes happening because we're living
[5:08] under the power of God every day to
[5:10] protect us from sin I can give you
[5:12] scriptures for that but that's the case
[5:14] we don't want to preach either side
[5:15] because a lot of times churches will
[5:17] preach the one side where if you get
[5:19] this and you have this experience you're
[5:21] going to do this and you're never going
[5:22] to make a mistake again that's not true
[5:24] then why would we need the blood of
[5:26] Jesus Christ because we're still in
[5:27] these bodies and we make mistakes
[5:30] but if we keep preaching this side we'll
[5:32] go on and on keep making mistakes and
[5:34] not call upon God say God let me ask
[5:36] forgiveness from you but God put a power
[5:39] in my life that I would never do that
[5:41] again
[5:42] can I get a greater amen this morning
[5:44] the blood of Jesus Christ has covered it
[5:47] all for the believer's life
[5:49] and he is not supposed to be
[5:51] intimidating and taking advantage of
[5:54] Satan is not supposed to be taken
[5:57] advantage of us to have the advantage
[5:59] means this dude to have the advantage
[6:02] means a condition or a circumstance that
[6:05] puts one in a favorable or a superior
[6:09] position I'm going to read it again it
[6:11] means that a condition or circumstance
[6:12] that puts one the devil in this case it
[6:16] that condition or circumstance has put
[6:18] the devil in a favorable or a superior
[6:21] position in your life in other words
[6:24] something happens some incident happened
[6:26] a condition happen you got under the
[6:29] right atmosphere excuse me you got to
[6:31] understand maybe a wrong atmosphere
[6:33] because it goes both way right
[6:34] atmosphere a wrong atmosphere is going
[6:37] to put either God or the enemy in a
[6:39] superior position in your life so
[6:41] conditions or circumstances someone has
[6:44] a trial someone has a lost loved one
[6:46] someone has something bad happened to
[6:49] them even if a Christian circumstances
[6:51] or certain conditions if we're not
[6:54] careful it's not just what happens to us
[6:57] it actually elevates and promotes Satan
[7:00] in a superior position in our life I'll
[7:03] make it simple you make a mistake and
[7:05] the devil's beating you up and putting
[7:07] you down you're nobody you're not a son
[7:08] or daughter of God and keeps even though
[7:10] you have forgiveness you're beating
[7:12] yourself up the devil's beating yourself
[7:13] up and so now you stay there and guess
[7:16] what the devil has used your mistake to
[7:19] put himself to give himself a promotion
[7:22] or you gave him a promotion to a
[7:25] superior place in your life that he's
[7:27] taken advantage of the situation a lost
[7:31] loved one
[7:32] oh God you know we there's hard things
[7:35] to go through but the worst part of it
[7:37] is to give Satan through that situation
[7:39] a superior position in your life he's
[7:43] taken advantage of you he's beating you
[7:44] up he's keeping you depressed
[7:47] he's making you question the word of God
[7:51] and so to take advantage means a
[7:53] condition of circumstances that puts him
[7:55] in a superior position things happen and
[7:58] Satan gets in a superior position over
[7:59] you through that many circumstances
[8:02] happen in life and in a church many
[8:05] circumstances happen many different
[8:07] Spirits can come in a church and then at
[8:10] the end of it he if Satan takes
[8:12] advantage of the situation then we got a
[8:14] problem because we're going to have
[8:16] situations
[8:18] we're going to have circumstances
[8:20] but if Satan gets the advantage in it
[8:23] that's the problem can I get an amen
[8:26] he binds things up he kills unity and it
[8:30] was just a situation but if it turns
[8:31] into Satan getting a promotion in your
[8:34] life let me say it clearly if a
[8:36] situation or a trial or something wrong
[8:38] you've been done wrong or a mistake
[8:40] you're made that's one thing we can
[8:42] bring it to the Lord can you say it back
[8:44] but that's one thing but if if it makes
[8:47] you give Satan a promotion in your life
[8:50] and his position that's where you're
[8:52] going to have a problem
[8:53] he does not have a right unless you give
[8:56] it to him for a superior position to
[9:00] take advantage over you
[9:03] somebody said praise the Lord
[9:05] he doesn't have a right for that
[9:07] position
[9:08] we got to kick him out can you say man
[9:10] sometimes Satan takes little things and
[9:13] makes them huge things
[9:16] sometimes Satan takes something little
[9:18] and you can deal with it and he makes
[9:20] them big things and he gets the victory
[9:22] he gets dominance over you in the end
[9:24] result he's defeating you and we should
[9:26] say no devil no devil we're not going to
[9:29] let you do that you have not been given
[9:31] any Superior position in my life you're
[9:34] not going to take advantage of me you're
[9:35] not going to use any extreme situation
[9:37] to take advantage of my life he doesn't
[9:40] belong in that position he doesn't
[9:42] belong in your thoughts can you say Amen
[9:45] who gave him a place at the table in
[9:48] your thoughts he doesn't even have a
[9:51] right for a place at the table in your
[9:53] thoughts and you give them a place at
[9:55] the table
[9:58] he doesn't have a right it's like when
[10:00] he comes in your thoughts you should be
[10:01] saying what are you doing here
[10:07] I didn't invite you
[10:11] what are you doing here
[10:13] get out here's the door get out
[10:16] can I get an amen trying to make it
[10:18] simple for all of us is that you give
[10:20] them a place in the table and he doesn't
[10:21] have a right in the believer's life have
[10:23] placed at the table he doesn't have an
[10:25] opinion he doesn't have an appeal why
[10:28] are you listening to Satan's opinion he
[10:30] doesn't get an opinion
[10:35] Paul says we also live that where Satan
[10:38] does not take advantage but we also live
[10:40] where we are not ignorant of his devices
[10:42] and that's why he can take an advantage
[10:44] is because we are let me word in a
[10:47] different way Paul says we are not
[10:49] ignorant of devices we are not dumb to
[10:53] Satan's schemes we are not dumb I'm
[10:55] rewording it so we can understand it
[10:58] better is that we do not live as
[11:00] Christians being in being dumb to the
[11:03] schemes of Satan
[11:07] sometimes the person is truly ignorant
[11:09] they didn't know they didn't understand
[11:11] how Satan got in because they didn't
[11:12] know he could come in that way he didn't
[11:14] understand they didn't understand
[11:15] they're truly ignorant sometimes a
[11:17] person is truly ignorant but sometimes
[11:20] people choose to be ignorant
[11:24] sometimes people don't know want to know
[11:26] the word of God on something
[11:28] and every warning is in their way every
[11:31] believer warning them Pastor warning
[11:34] them
[11:35] mom every warning has been put their way
[11:38] parents warning them
[11:40] and they can't see Satan in the device
[11:43] that Satan is using
[11:46] or they don't want to
[11:48] oh that's just a little thing and that's
[11:51] just a little guilty pleasure of mine
[11:52] and it's an innocent thing I'm not
[11:55] really affected by it it's just
[11:56] something I escape into those romance
[11:59] novels you know that's something I've
[12:00] had in my life a long time they don't
[12:02] bother me at all
[12:07] it's my private world
[12:12] and yet Satan
[12:15] finds any way that he can
[12:17] to get into your house
[12:20] because how many knows the Bible says
[12:22] he's a thief
[12:25] he finds ways to come through the back
[12:27] doors of your life or even the basement
[12:29] window
[12:30] and you're saying I got that secured I
[12:34] got that locked there's no way he could
[12:35] have got in there listen if you're
[12:37] dealing with the professional Thief
[12:40] I don't care how much you've secured
[12:41] your house a professional Thief they
[12:44] have ways
[12:48] you're not a professional Thief but
[12:50] professional thieves It's amazing And
[12:54] you think they never get in there they
[12:56] never get in that basement window nobody
[12:58] could fit through that basement window
[12:59] don't underestimate the thief
[13:04] don't underestimate the thief that Satan
[13:07] is trying to get in your house I said
[13:10] brother Paul what's my house hold up
[13:12] your hands
[13:13] point back at yourself
[13:15] this is your house
[13:18] and the Bible says it's a temple of the
[13:20] Holy Ghost it's and and it's not a
[13:23] temple of the Holy Ghost but you rent
[13:24] out rooms to the devil
[13:30] it's not a you can't call it the temple
[13:33] the mind the spirit the body everything
[13:36] and you can't say God is allowed in my
[13:38] soul but my body or my eyes every once
[13:42] in a while I rent out for other things
[13:44] no no if it's to be filled every fiber
[13:47] is to be filled and controlled by the
[13:50] Holy Spirit but Satan is a professional
[13:53] thief and he knows how to get in the
[13:55] back door now when we the house that my
[13:58] kids were raised in on Bancroft there is
[14:01] Bancroft guest house now it's an Airbnb
[14:03] and so but for years for years we had
[14:06] little environments and critters that
[14:09] were up in the attic and I'm here to
[14:11] tell you I work for countless years
[14:13] probably 15 years at the problem with
[14:17] varmints in is that a new word
[14:19] environments the young people know what
[14:20] environments is something was up there
[14:22] squirrels or Chipmunks or some type of
[14:25] creature and they were in the attic and
[14:27] they just set up housekeeping up there
[14:29] ever every winner they would come in and
[14:32] they used my house they didn't pay any
[14:34] rent
[14:36] and they're up there and it's like so
[14:38] every summer I'd attack it again and I'd
[14:40] I'd have this and I'd have this person
[14:42] look at it and and we'd find holes okay
[14:45] the problem solved and we've solved the
[14:47] problem and then we're the worst place
[14:49] they came they must have knew me because
[14:51] the worst place that came was right
[14:53] above me in Becca's bed
[14:55] that was their party ground at night
[14:58] and you know chewing and so we're laying
[15:01] there you know just getting ready to go
[15:03] to sleep
[15:06] stuff being moved around and I don't
[15:09] it's no telling what they were doing up
[15:11] there and for years I'm not talking
[15:14] about I don't know how these things got
[15:16] in because I was doing everything to
[15:17] keep them out I don't know how they got
[15:19] in and and and and you're there and
[15:22] you're going what are they doing and so
[15:24] I get so mad after I've done everything
[15:26] to keep them out and then all of a
[15:27] sudden you know and so you know my wife
[15:30] can tell you I yelled out some nights I
[15:33] said get out of my house this is my
[15:37] house I did not invite you
[15:40] or I would get a chair and I'd be just
[15:44] pounding
[15:45] on the ceiling didn't I hon I just
[15:47] go oh I want to get some sleep
[15:53] and when I do that if I yell or if I'd
[15:55] hit the ceiling it got real quiet
[16:00] Who's down there
[16:02] the owner
[16:05] the owner
[16:14] dies my authority I don't hear anything
[16:17] you're as quiet as a
[16:19] Mouse
[16:30] anyway I got this professional company
[16:32] and they guaranteed it for five years we
[16:34] guarantee we'll come back every time
[16:36] until we find that problem had to pay
[16:39] him a lot of money to get a five-year
[16:40] warranty and guess what I found it was
[16:43] out front they found it one day after
[16:44] coming back three or four times they
[16:46] couldn't even find it and I kept calling
[16:47] and saying listen you guys guarantee
[16:49] this I still got varmints in this up
[16:51] there and they've come out and one day
[16:53] he was out there in the front and just
[16:55] underneath the siding they hadn't looked
[16:57] before they hadn't seen it just this
[16:59] little tiny hole in the front of the
[17:00] house you know how I need to get to my
[17:03] sermon here but this is an irritation to
[17:04] me
[17:07] it's like why didn't they come in that
[17:09] hole and just stay in the front of the
[17:11] house in Solomon's room somebody else's
[17:13] room besides mine
[17:16] how who put it
[17:19] what devil put it in their minds to come
[17:22] up that wall and travel all the way back
[17:24] to my bedroom
[17:35] if a thief is a professional he can find
[17:37] many ways into your house that you did
[17:39] not expect because he's good at sneaking
[17:42] in can you say Matt
[17:44] for there is now I want to talk about a
[17:47] little bit today
[17:48] uh the what's on Satan's mind brother
[17:52] Burley and I were fellowshiping about
[17:54] that a couple weeks ago and he got so
[17:56] inspired about it and I did too I think
[17:58] he went down and preached that BCF a
[18:00] couple Wednesdays ago if you want to
[18:01] hear it I'm sure it's a tremendous
[18:02] message he always breaks things down
[18:03] real good but he says he said we're
[18:05] talking about what's do people realize
[18:07] what's in the devil's mind what's his
[18:09] agenda what he wants to do
[18:13] and we're living in the last days where
[18:16] God said he would restore his word
[18:18] through Elijah and not so much restore
[18:21] not just restore the word but actually
[18:24] bring the mystery Revelations 10 7 in
[18:27] the days of the voice of the seventh
[18:29] angel the mystery of God should be
[18:32] completely revealed as he has declared
[18:35] to his servants the prophets at the end
[18:37] time he reveals the complete mystery of
[18:39] God and that means that we're going to
[18:42] go into not just restored word but we
[18:45] the Believers will be able to tap into
[18:47] what was in the back part of God's mind
[18:50] before the foundation of the world see
[18:53] his purpose see his plan and see you
[18:56] were in him before the foundation of the
[18:58] world that's what we're blessed to hear
[19:00] can you say Amen we're just not
[19:01] preaching little sermons here we're
[19:03] hearing what was in God's mind before
[19:05] the foundation of the world the message
[19:07] has revealed what was in God's mind but
[19:09] I want to tell you something the message
[19:11] has also revealed what's on Satan's mind
[19:14] his agenda what he's thinking about
[19:17] every day
[19:19] and the Bible tells us many places but
[19:21] here's one you're familiar with the
[19:22] thief cometh not but to steal to kill
[19:26] and destroy you know what that scripture
[19:28] said brother Billy and I were talking
[19:29] about it you know it says the thief
[19:31] cometh not but to do these things in
[19:33] other words he doesn't even show up
[19:35] unless he's out to kill to steal to
[19:38] destroy what the believer has
[19:41] to kill you to make you quit serving God
[19:43] to steal the good things God has given
[19:45] you
[19:47] and if he can just destroy
[19:50] he doesn't even show up
[19:52] unless he's
[19:54] stealing killing
[19:56] and destroying
[19:57] and you say Amen
[19:59] I ask you a question you're sitting here
[20:01] I'm glad to have you here but for many
[20:03] of you many years the devil stole things
[20:05] from you and you haven't taken them back
[20:06] yet
[20:09] he stole things from you you had a heart
[20:11] to serve God you were serving him you
[20:13] were going along you were lining up with
[20:14] the message in the word of God but
[20:16] somehow Satan mixed mess with your mind
[20:18] and now he stole things from you and you
[20:20] don't even realize it it's time for you
[20:22] to rise up and take them back
[20:24] time for you to realize that what's on
[20:26] the devil's mind is he's out to take
[20:28] advantage of you and he's taken
[20:30] advantage of you in your life right now
[20:32] and he's not to do that you have to rise
[20:34] in faith to stand against it can you say
[20:36] Amen quickly go with me to second Samuel
[20:38] chapter 13. much more I can say about
[20:41] that but I hope you get to the point
[20:43] that the thief cometh not but to steal
[20:45] to kill and to destroy can you say Amen
[20:48] we're learning what's on Satan's mind
[20:50] and you have to know you can't be
[20:53] ignorant of Satan's devices you cannot
[20:55] be dumb concerning his schemes that he
[20:58] comes against you you can't not shut
[21:01] every window and every door of your
[21:02] household it has to be protected by the
[21:05] blood and by the word every day can you
[21:08] say Amen because there are too many
[21:10] devices that Satan is in control of and
[21:13] he'll gonna he's gonna come in that
[21:15] basement window he's going to come in
[21:17] through that phone he's going to come in
[21:19] to that app that you have on your phone
[21:21] he's going to come in through that new
[21:24] app that just came out he's going to
[21:25] come in through the movies that you're
[21:27] watching he's going to come in through
[21:29] the music you're listening to he's going
[21:31] to come into what you're listening to on
[21:33] the radio any place that he's given he's
[21:35] going to try to sneak in your house
[21:43] second Samuel chapter 13.
[21:46] and
[21:48] you know friends
[21:51] I get up here and
[21:54] preach these things but something's been
[21:57] happening
[21:59] I just want to post the church okay
[22:05] there's some there's some reason there's
[22:07] one reason that I'm speaking these
[22:09] things and got off my subject on
[22:11] relationships because I feel like
[22:14] something's changed a little bit in our
[22:16] assembly and I feel like he's used
[22:18] situations and Satan is taking a little
[22:21] bit of advantage of us
[22:25] and the thing is is that I've been
[22:27] keeping that to myself for the most part
[22:30] but other Holy Ghost Field Believers
[22:32] have sensed it
[22:35] I had somebody text me this week and say
[22:39] I I hear you're going to preach
[22:42] something here on Sunday I don't know
[22:43] what you're going to preach but I'm
[22:44] going to stand together with you in
[22:46] prayer for this Sunday of service
[22:48] because this is a spiritual battle with
[22:52] the devil that's taken advantage of
[22:54] people
[22:56] there's a Godly sister who had a a dream
[22:58] and she was afraid to share it with me
[23:01] but uh
[23:03] and I'm not here to share dreams to make
[23:05] you afraid but I can tell you that about
[23:08] half of it has come to pass and she
[23:11] doesn't know anything about what's going
[23:13] on the congregation like I do
[23:15] half of it's come to us God through the
[23:17] Holy Ghost showed her through a dream
[23:19] things that's going on
[23:21] things that's taken place privately
[23:24] and I'm just waiting for the rest of it
[23:26] to be fulfilled but I'm just I'm not
[23:27] saying to scare you I'm saying to say
[23:28] this
[23:30] if you think that the Holy Spirit does
[23:32] not know what's going on privately
[23:34] you're greatly mistaken
[23:39] and he will expose it
[23:42] in his loving corrective way
[23:45] but you can't be around the Holy Spirit
[23:47] and continue to hide things
[23:52] some of it is some of the young people
[23:54] are not serving the lord privately
[23:57] and living a double life
[24:00] so I cry and I my spirits grieved
[24:04] that Satan would not get an advantage
[24:08] in their lives
[24:11] I love you and I'm going to tell you the
[24:12] truth
[24:15] praise the Lord
[24:17] II Samuel 13 this is related a little
[24:20] bit to that
[24:26] and it came to pass after this that
[24:29] Absalom the son of David
[24:31] had a fair sister whose name was
[24:35] Tamar Tamar Tamar however you want to
[24:38] pronounce it
[24:39] he had a fair sister whose name was in
[24:41] other words he was pretty
[24:43] whose name was Tamar and amnon the son
[24:46] of David loved her so this is a
[24:49] half-sister and he loved her so it would
[24:52] stop right there
[24:53] if that scripture was left alone by
[24:56] itself then we could all look at it as a
[24:58] pure love
[25:00] for this girl although he couldn't have
[25:03] her anyway uh
[25:05] when you use the term love for peer
[25:08] Believers you think of pure okay he
[25:11] loved this girl
[25:12] okay
[25:13] so just stopping right here now this
[25:16] story of amnon
[25:18] what's going to happen in this story and
[25:20] I'm not reading the whole thing today
[25:22] I'm going to break it down in further
[25:23] services but I'm I'm I'm what's going to
[25:27] happen is if you don't know the story
[25:28] I'll tell you the summer summary this
[25:31] son of the this this uh this um amnon is
[25:36] going to take advantage
[25:39] of a daughter of the king
[25:44] I said this
[25:46] amnon is going to take advantage in the
[25:49] story take advantage of a daughter of
[25:52] the king
[25:55] so when I read that and I read it
[25:57] through the years but I've never got so
[25:59] much out of it as reading it now
[26:00] currently is that when I read this and
[26:02] read the story then I realized my
[26:05] question was is that this is an extreme
[26:08] violation here that he's going to carry
[26:09] out
[26:10] but my question is is what's in the mind
[26:13] of that boy
[26:16] and how did he get to that point
[26:19] because you don't get to the point of
[26:22] overriding all these things because
[26:23] remember he's he's a religious boy he's
[26:26] around King David he's around he's he's
[26:28] a one of the lineage of David
[26:32] how in the world does it get in his mind
[26:34] and where was what was he feeding on and
[26:37] what was taking place in This Boy's Life
[26:39] to carry out to take advantage of a
[26:42] daughter of the king
[26:45] and I'm not going to read all that today
[26:47] you should read it though because I'm
[26:49] exploring what's in amnon's mind I'm
[26:52] also going to explore uh the family
[26:55] because it was related to some family
[26:57] issues two chapters before is David's
[27:00] sin which you can break down David the
[27:02] king's sin and this something began
[27:05] through the family here that that wasn't
[27:08] completely resolved and so now we have a
[27:13] sexual problem going on and so but I
[27:16] want to explore what's in amnon's mind
[27:18] as I just talked about the devil's mind
[27:20] a lot of this is associated with amnon's
[27:23] mind because you just asked how did he
[27:25] get there in his thinking what what his
[27:27] plan was we understand how he carried it
[27:29] out but how did he get there in his
[27:31] thinking because I have a mind the same
[27:36] type of Mind as amnon you have a mind
[27:39] like Eminem you have a brain
[27:42] and so we are susceptible to what goes
[27:46] on in our thought life we are
[27:48] susceptible to receiving things that
[27:51] would bring us to things later on down
[27:54] the road that we have allowed in our
[27:56] minds
[27:59] so the problem here is definitely of a
[28:02] sexual nature because he's going to
[28:03] carry out a rape to this daughter of the
[28:05] king and sexual things
[28:09] um there's something unique about them
[28:10] and as I keep talking it gets quieter
[28:14] and quieter and quieter
[28:17] and you have to know that I've been
[28:19] praying about this for a month and I'm
[28:21] prepared for that part because when you
[28:22] talk about sexual things and I will do
[28:24] it tactfully when you talk about it
[28:27] people are going to get quiet
[28:28] and some of it that's good that's
[28:30] healthy okay because it's a tight
[28:32] subject
[28:33] but I will not I will not allow the
[28:37] devil
[28:38] to privately defeat people's lives
[28:42] by not I'm I'm I want to hit this from a
[28:46] different flank as it were in war and to
[28:49] where the devil doesn't even know what
[28:51] hit him
[28:53] and I would love for some of you to
[28:55] stand with me in prayer every Thursday
[28:57] morning we're gathering with a few of
[28:59] the brothers in the area 7 30 and
[29:01] Thursday mornings for the needs of the
[29:03] church for some of these issues every
[29:06] Thursday morning if you want to join me
[29:07] with that on Thursday mornings at 7 30
[29:09] in your home I would love for you to do
[29:12] that because I will not stand by and let
[29:14] the devil take advantage of people's
[29:16] lives
[29:23] sexual things
[29:24] they're unique because they tend to
[29:27] embed themselves in our minds deeper
[29:30] than other things music has a great
[29:33] power to slip through uh because music
[29:36] has a power on the mind that dismantles
[29:39] the the reasoning and so Spirits can
[29:44] come through music easier than they can
[29:47] come through somebody just walking up to
[29:49] you and telling you to do something
[29:50] wrong and telling dirt to you through
[29:54] the music realm it dismantles our
[29:56] emotions and makes us softer and more
[29:59] gentle so we don't reason what's coming
[30:00] through so then the lyrics come through
[30:02] of the worldly songs and the spirit
[30:04] comes through and someone can take a
[30:07] demon Spirit by the music of the world
[30:11] [Music]
[30:12] but it goes in a little easier because
[30:15] the mind and our spirit and our emotions
[30:17] get kind of dismantled especially as a
[30:20] nice soft song that it's got
[30:22] orchestration and it's just it it just
[30:25] pulls the heartstrings and it it kind of
[30:27] dismantles any reason you guys that's so
[30:30] lovely that's so good but Christians
[30:32] need to be still on their feet to say
[30:34] what are they saying in this song
[30:39] you know there's an old Barry Manilow
[30:41] song which the young people wouldn't
[30:42] know but he wrote a song I write the
[30:45] songs I write the songs that make the
[30:49] whole world sing I write the songs of
[30:53] love and special things
[30:57] I write the songs that make the young
[31:01] girls cry
[31:03] I write the songs I write the songs I
[31:06] won't sing anymore because there's I can
[31:07] feel the demon Spirits coming in even
[31:09] without
[31:11] but it was
[31:14] just all guitar it was this is nice this
[31:18] is a very Universal thing and he writes
[31:21] the song it's Barry Manilow and then you
[31:23] read the first verse and you realize
[31:25] it says I've been alive forever
[31:29] and I wrote the very first song
[31:34] well Barry Manilow hasn't been alive
[31:36] forever
[31:38] and he didn't write the very first song
[31:40] So if you lose just a little bit of
[31:42] reasoning use your brain just a little
[31:45] bit and you have to ask who's talking
[31:47] here
[31:49] who's blatantly telling the world
[31:52] I'm the originator of this and I'm
[31:56] gathering you in for the battle of
[31:58] Armageddon and I'm using beautiful music
[32:01] to do it
[32:07] and Christians need to be on their toes
[32:10] and check everything that you're feeding
[32:13] on
[32:14] including some Christian music because
[32:17] Christian music today is some of it's
[32:21] very worshipful and some of it gives
[32:22] glory to God but some of it you better
[32:24] read the lyrics because you could take
[32:26] the lyrics and apply them to your
[32:27] boyfriend
[32:30] there's nothing of Christ in there
[32:31] there's nothing of the love of Christ
[32:33] there's nothing about serving the lord
[32:34] There's No Redemption there's no blood
[32:36] and you can take the lyrics and use it
[32:39] for your boyfriend or girlfriend
[32:41] that's why they can use songs over there
[32:43] for love songs Taylor Swift and they
[32:46] some of them they can use over here talk
[32:48] about the Lord I think there's a big
[32:49] problem with that
[32:51] but I didn't expect to say all that this
[32:53] morning but I did but the spirit and the
[32:56] the lyrics get through because we're
[32:58] dismantled a bit sexual things are even
[33:01] more embedded in our minds deeper than
[33:05] just about anything and Satan knows that
[33:12] Satan knows it
[33:14] so what would it be in Satan's Eden
[33:17] what would this be his main thing to try
[33:20] to destroy young boys and young girls
[33:24] and get them under a guilt and shame
[33:27] so that they don't even feel worthy when
[33:30] God begins to deal with them they don't
[33:32] even feel worthy to even come to God
[33:35] because their mind at an early age has
[33:38] been filled with sexual dirty images
[33:44] who's the author of that the same one
[33:47] who said I wrote the very first song
[33:50] I understand human beings I understand
[33:54] their brains and Friends there's a
[33:56] problem when the devil understands your
[33:58] brain and how it works and what you feed
[34:00] on when the devil understands that
[34:02] better than you
[34:03] that's a problem
[34:06] and we're not ignorant of Satan's
[34:08] devices
[34:09] we're not dumb or we shouldn't be dumb
[34:16] so this is why God has put Protections
[34:19] in place
[34:22] how many believe God's put Protections
[34:24] in place for our soul
[34:27] yes
[34:29] but
[34:30] God has put Protections in place in the
[34:33] Bible God has put Protections in place
[34:36] for our brains
[34:41] and if you're going to preach about the
[34:43] protections of the Soul then you got to
[34:45] preach about the protections of the
[34:47] brain
[34:50] not a lot of preaching like that in our
[34:52] ranks
[34:54] about the brain how it works
[34:58] and when I jump onto it and read quotes
[35:00] of the Prophet read scriptures
[35:03] some some ranks I get labeled let me not
[35:06] I just get quickly labeled
[35:09] something other than the norm
[35:11] that I'm preaching psychology and I'm
[35:13] just using scriptures in the message to
[35:15] show
[35:17] that God has put Protections in place
[35:19] for our brains not just our souls
[35:26] and you can ignore them
[35:29] all you want to
[35:31] but you are what you are
[35:34] and
[35:35] we may pay the consequences
[35:38] great consequences if we ignore
[35:43] that part
[35:45] there's a writer here
[35:47] Ted Roberts who words it this way
[35:52] I don't know if you ever thought about
[35:54] it but isn't it amazing how we are able
[35:56] to remember certain events in our lives
[35:58] and totally forget others
[36:00] for example can you remember what you
[36:03] ate for lunch on this date five years
[36:05] ago I can't yet we are able to remember
[36:09] nearly every detail of an incident in
[36:11] which someone deeply embarrassed us five
[36:14] years ago
[36:16] what are the differences between those
[36:18] two events is their depth of sensory
[36:21] impact so there's certain things that
[36:23] have a depth of sensory impact and
[36:24] there's other things that don't
[36:26] that's why we tend to remember the ones
[36:28] that have a deeper sensory impact
[36:31] how many of our senses were involved and
[36:34] How Deeply that's the question the
[36:36] embarrassment involved all of our senses
[36:39] and was also underlined with a strong
[36:41] adrenaline
[36:44] flow we wanted either to fight or to run
[36:47] in response to the disgrace that we felt
[36:49] because we were so affected in our brain
[36:53] in the adrenaline that flowed from
[36:55] somebody embarrassing us five years ago
[36:57] we wanted to either fight or to run in
[36:59] response into to the disgrace and the
[37:02] embarrassment we felt
[37:04] oh
[37:05] he says when I am in into a good book I
[37:08] always read it with a highlighter pin in
[37:11] my hand so I can find the critical
[37:13] information quickly in the future with
[37:16] the highlighter similarly our brains
[37:19] chemically highlight certain events for
[37:23] instance referral separating the
[37:25] significance from the insignificant I'm
[37:28] going to read that again similarly our
[37:29] brains chemically highlight certain
[37:31] events for instant referral separating
[37:34] the significant from the insignificant a
[37:38] major aspect of sexual activity is a
[37:42] strong release of adrenaline and
[37:44] endorphins which is why sexual events
[37:48] become imprinted in our brain almost
[37:50] completely more deeper
[37:53] than any other thing
[37:56] whether good or bad
[37:58] whether holy or dirty
[38:00] it has an effect
[38:03] and so I'm being real with you this
[38:05] morning and I'm asking you to be real
[38:07] I'm asking you to go back to the
[38:09] scripture that Paul instructs us as
[38:11] Believers we should not be ignorant of
[38:13] Satan's devices
[38:15] we should not be ignorant of how these
[38:18] things affect the brain can you say amen
[38:20] and we should live that the devil does
[38:23] not have an advantage over us in any
[38:26] area of our life he does not belong in
[38:29] that place can you say Amen now in in
[38:31] amnon as I try to bring this down a
[38:33] little bit now in verse 1 and 2 uh let's
[38:38] read verse two now so he says he loves
[38:40] Tamar okay he loved her verse two and
[38:42] amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for
[38:46] his sister Damar for she was a virgin
[38:49] stop right there how do you have that he
[38:51] loved her in verse one and he was so
[38:54] vexed that he got sick in verse two
[38:57] it's real clear here he thought this was
[39:00] love but this isn't love
[39:03] and we know we were living a generation
[39:05] that's messed up the word love
[39:08] you don't even know what love is anymore
[39:10] homosexual says he loves his partner
[39:13] lesbian says she loves her partner you
[39:15] don't know what love is if you're
[39:16] listening to me today I loved you enough
[39:18] in the love of the Lord to tell you that
[39:21] somehow love has been perverted
[39:24] because anything that's not God ordained
[39:27] and he ordained all this he created us
[39:28] as human beings and if you're getting
[39:30] off to and denying even the way God made
[39:33] you as a male or a female if you're
[39:35] denying that you're denying the god that
[39:36] made you
[39:37] and you can't twist love into those
[39:39] perverted things
[39:41] God's the Creator Satan is the perverter
[39:44] of what he creates Satan never created
[39:47] anything he would love to have the power
[39:49] of creation he's never had it he never
[39:51] will he only takes what God has and
[39:54] perverts it and so God is the Fountain
[39:56] of pure love can you say amen God is the
[40:00] Fountain of pure love between a man and
[40:01] a woman God is the Fountain of pure love
[40:04] for God God is the fountain to keep pure
[40:06] can you say Amen Satan takes it and
[40:08] perverts that down this down this down
[40:11] this until you have a homosexual lesbian
[40:12] saying I really love them I truly love
[40:14] them I'm sorry that's not true that's a
[40:17] perverted love
[40:19] why was amnon vexed I've been pondering
[40:22] it for two or three weeks
[40:25] how can he have love it just to me
[40:28] uh
[40:31] it's confusing
[40:35] these two verses are confusing unless
[40:38] you know the long-term damage lust does
[40:42] them to the mind
[40:44] if you understand the long-term damage
[40:47] that lust does to the mind and twist
[40:49] everything that's the only way you can
[40:51] understand this that his love what he
[40:53] called love because love does not have
[40:56] vexation to it
[40:58] can I get everybody a degree pure love
[41:01] does not have vexation what what does
[41:04] vexation mean glad you asked
[41:07] Vex in the Hebrew is yassar vexed in the
[41:11] Hebrews yasar throughout the Old
[41:13] Testament
[41:14] it means to be distressed
[41:17] to press
[41:18] to be narrow
[41:20] in other words this thing has become and
[41:23] has another word for uh vexation is
[41:25] obsession
[41:28] this is not love anymore it doesn't have
[41:30] freedom anymore it doesn't have respect
[41:32] anymore it loses all the boundaries
[41:33] loses all respect and everything else in
[41:36] life becomes
[41:38] falls into Oblivion and this becomes an
[41:41] obsession this is a narrow thought I
[41:43] must have her I must have her
[41:47] and he's calling it love and it's
[41:49] vexation with it brother and sister that
[41:51] is not love young people that is not
[41:54] love
[41:56] don't put love to that
[42:00] one thought how can I have this woman
[42:02] how can I nothing else matters in life
[42:04] how can I have this woman then you feed
[42:07] on these video games
[42:09] which have women in them
[42:12] and it only just fuels the the wrong
[42:15] kind of fire that's in you the obsession
[42:16] that's in you
[42:18] feed on those things are not becoming
[42:21] very popular today but I'm going to
[42:23] speak the truth you sit there and feed
[42:26] your mind of that and say you're not
[42:27] affected and I'm going to tell you again
[42:28] young brother you are affected by it
[42:31] and the devil is taking advantage of
[42:34] your spiritual walk
[42:36] when you sit there for countless hours
[42:38] hidden in secret playing those video
[42:40] games
[42:42] I tell you in the name of the Lord you
[42:44] better hit an altar because Satan's
[42:46] taking advantage of your life
[42:48] He Has Lifted himself in a position he's
[42:50] controlling you
[42:52] but it's narrow it's an obsession and
[42:54] becomes everything that's not love
[42:56] obsessed thinking was what he was all
[42:58] about he was obsessed about her that's
[43:00] not love when somebody's obsessed with
[43:02] somebody now I know romance can make you
[43:05] just really you know act funny I
[43:07] understand that that's a pure romance
[43:09] for somebody that's you know you you
[43:11] know my wife says when I first came to
[43:13] her house for the first time
[43:15] um
[43:16] uh the uh there was something about was
[43:19] asking for uh a a drink or something I
[43:22] can't remember what it was asking for
[43:23] something to drink and and I was the
[43:26] first visit so kind of in la la land
[43:28] that uh I can't remember the story now
[43:31] so
[43:34] it's not important
[43:36] and I know my wife doesn't want to get
[43:38] up and tell it today
[43:40] but I was in so much of La La Land that
[43:42] I just forgot to serve for a drink or I
[43:45] can't remember what it was but anyway oh
[43:48] no she was in la la land and my
[43:50] brother-in-law Henry was there and she
[43:53] served me a drink but Henry never got
[43:56] nothing
[43:58] she was the one that was la la
[44:00] not me
[44:02] walked right by him you know brought me
[44:04] a drink and it was like Henry wasn't
[44:06] there
[44:09] I know there's a romance
[44:11] but obsession is a different thing
[44:14] that's not love
[44:16] and a matter of fact romantic love will
[44:19] get you in trouble if there's not a
[44:21] solid respect of genuine love
[44:26] worldly songs are filled with romantic
[44:28] love
[44:29] have her sexually how he and and and so
[44:33] this is something that I would I'm just
[44:35] elaborating on because vexation of
[44:37] spirit and here's what he said to in
[44:40] verse two and Ammon was so vexed that he
[44:42] fell sick for his sister Tamar for she
[44:45] was a virgin stop right there already
[44:47] right there
[44:50] is a protection in place if it's upheld
[44:53] that he knew there was a boundary there
[44:58] that a god-ordained boundary
[45:02] and then he says
[45:04] then it says and he thought it hard for
[45:07] him to do anything to her
[45:12] in other words this Criminal Mind
[45:15] of amnon
[45:17] was standing there knowing I can't have
[45:20] my obsession but I'm not going to quit
[45:22] until I can get around because it's hard
[45:25] to get to her so I have to form a plan
[45:28] to get around because it's so hard to
[45:33] get to
[45:34] I say if a girl is hard to get to by the
[45:39] life she's living
[45:42] she's playing hard to get
[45:45] I say praise the Lord
[45:48] praise the Lord
[45:54] is this okay with everybody
[45:57] because that's God ordained and so
[45:59] here's this here's this mind it's going
[46:02] to figure out a plan and influence from
[46:04] a friend how can I do this and get
[46:06] around all this I want to tell you
[46:07] that's the devil's mind
[46:09] this is the devil's mind you want to
[46:12] know what he's thinking every day God's
[46:14] got Protections in place for the
[46:15] daughter of the king I'm preaching to
[46:17] the daughter of the king today I'm
[46:19] preaching to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[46:21] and God has put Protections in place for
[46:23] her
[46:25] and every day the devil is trying to
[46:27] ponder and scheme to get around those
[46:30] protections
[46:31] you ought to know that and you ought to
[46:33] say I'm not ignorant of his devices or
[46:36] what's on his mind I'm Gonna Keep the
[46:39] Protections in place
[46:42] I'm gonna read the word to my kids you
[46:45] know I almost weep because you might
[46:47] some of you older ones may resist this I
[46:49] don't know what you're gonna what you're
[46:51] gonna leave saying today it's fine with
[46:52] me but you know what I'm preaching to a
[46:54] lot these young lives that's going to be
[46:56] baptized today these young children
[46:58] they're gonna hear from this pastor
[47:00] because they're going to go into a world
[47:02] that is perverted and dirty everything
[47:05] that's good they're gonna hear a holy
[47:07] man of God tell them what truth is
[47:10] because I care for the future if we're
[47:13] here another 10 years they need to hear
[47:15] truth they need to Value the Protections
[47:18] in place they need to Value when a
[47:20] pastor says don't be alone together in a
[47:23] car with a guy or girl they need a
[47:25] pastor who says don't be doing these
[47:27] things don't touch one another don't
[47:29] kiss one another until you're married I
[47:31] don't care what standards you've
[47:33] developed the message says it the word
[47:34] says it and I'm going to preach tell
[47:36] keep preaching our young children this
[47:38] beautiful God I just I'm tired of the
[47:40] devil taking advantage
[47:41] [Applause]
[47:45] excuse me for my anger I'm not angry at
[47:47] you
[47:48] but I'm standing I trust you stand with
[47:50] you I stand against the enemy who takes
[47:52] advantage
[47:54] you don't want him to take advantage of
[47:56] us
[47:59] how can I get around these things how
[48:00] can I take advantage of her this is the
[48:02] mind of Satan and the mind of a lot of
[48:05] our men in this generation is how can I
[48:07] get around
[48:08] the boundaries
[48:10] because of what they're feeding on
[48:13] if you find a boy
[48:16] I'm gonna say something positive now
[48:18] if you find a boy that loves this word
[48:20] with all of his heart
[48:22] and you can see the spirit of God in his
[48:24] life
[48:25] and he respects the boundaries of
[48:27] parents both parents
[48:30] he respect the boundaries of virginity
[48:32] and the boundaries that's been in place
[48:34] to protect rigidity
[48:36] he respects that he's not trying to find
[48:38] a way around it with you
[48:43] and it doesn't bother him
[48:46] that it's hard to get to you
[48:49] it doesn't bother him a bit he's not
[48:51] trying to get around it he's not trying
[48:53] to find a way it doesn't bother him that
[48:55] you have bounties and protection around
[48:56] that doesn't intimidate him at all he's
[48:58] thanking God for it
[49:00] and he still likes you he still loves
[49:02] you he has respect for your feelings
[49:05] and the god ordained rules that's in
[49:08] place for a virgin I'm going to save you
[49:10] that's a boy to consider seriously
[49:14] because that's hard to find today
[49:19] he needs a job too
[49:27] [Laughter]
[49:32] you know
[49:33] w-o-r-k is more than just a radio
[49:35] station
[49:40] boy needs to know how to work boy needs
[49:42] to go get a trade he needs to go get a
[49:43] degree or a trade boy needs to put the
[49:46] time in so he can support a family
[49:48] some of you don't like this they're in
[49:50] love they'll make it the Holy Ghost will
[49:52] get them through
[49:55] get so tired of hearing that I know the
[49:57] Holy Ghost will get you through
[49:59] but
[50:02] without a vision the people perish
[50:05] without a vision the boy don't have a
[50:07] vision
[50:08] and he just wants to jump to something
[50:10] he don't have a vision he's not
[50:12] preparing at all there's a problem with
[50:15] that
[50:15] so I'll get off the work thing but you
[50:18] know he needs a job
[50:19] but if you got a boy that's
[50:22] comfortable with the Protections in
[50:24] place and with the daddy that's
[50:26] protecting and it don't bother it's not
[50:29] amnon it's trying it's it's hard to get
[50:32] to her how can I get around these things
[50:34] if you got a boy that's doing that I'll
[50:36] tell you how to
[50:38] you know consider that's really
[50:40] seriously
[50:42] but a guy or girl who's looking for a
[50:44] way around the principles and
[50:46] protections that's being preached of
[50:48] virginity
[50:49] you better run from that boy
[50:52] you better stay single for a few more
[50:54] years
[50:59] man brother Paul
[51:02] praise God it was hard for him to get
[51:04] anything to her
[51:06] at least say something that's the way
[51:07] that I want to live before the devil
[51:12] I want to live every day that the devil
[51:15] what he's thinking is that I'd like to
[51:17] get him but he's so hard to get to
[51:21] come on people raise your hand how many
[51:24] would like to live a life where the
[51:26] devil gets up Monday morning and say I
[51:28] have issues with this guy because I've
[51:30] looked at his life he's got every door
[51:33] covered everything locked up it's going
[51:35] to be hard for me to get a plan together
[51:39] because he's hard to get to the Virgin
[51:42] bride of Jesus Christ might I remind you
[51:46] that brother Branham said that they the
[51:49] bride Jesus himself the reason the Devil
[51:52] Couldn't get to Jesus is because he had
[51:54] been sprayed with the repellent of
[51:57] predestination he knew his position he
[52:00] knew he was in the mind of God he knew
[52:03] he was predestinated to come to this
[52:05] earth and that strength was a protection
[52:07] and a repellent against Satan
[52:10] I'm preaching to a bride in this age and
[52:13] a bride that's listening online there's
[52:15] been protections put in place the
[52:18] repellent of predestination has been
[52:19] preached and when she stands in her
[52:21] position in the word it's hard for Satan
[52:24] to get to her
[52:27] [Applause]
[52:34] I'm playing hard to get with the Enemy
[52:40] Hallelujah a couple more quotes and I'm
[52:43] finished thank you for your attention
[52:45] thank you for your love
[52:48] thank you for loving me
[52:52] amen
[52:55] it's hard to get to this bride this is
[52:56] the way he said it and uh our brother
[53:00] Branham said it you're not familiar with
[53:02] him sometimes we quote him quoted
[53:05] another Minister today but the brand was
[53:07] a great man of God
[53:09] in the in the last
[53:11] generation
[53:13] and uh was used in a mighty way
[53:16] so this is a quote from him the word
[53:18] said he was the Son of God the spirit
[53:20] proved he was the son of God
[53:23] Isaiah 9 6 was fulfilled and the other
[53:25] night many of you of the broadcast heard
[53:27] that he would give 60 some odd
[53:29] scriptures here almost I believe that
[53:30] proving that the scripture said that it
[53:32] was him
[53:33] so you know Jesus is in a pretty
[53:35] confident place because there's some 66
[53:37] Old Testament scriptures that speak of
[53:40] his position he's standing pretty strong
[53:42] in his position
[53:44] I believe about proving that the
[53:46] scripture said that that was him oh
[53:49] Satan tried and tried again to do
[53:50] everything one night laying on the back
[53:52] of a ship he's seen him to sleep and he
[53:54] said I'll destroy him right now but he
[53:55] couldn't he tried to tempt him in doing
[53:57] the wrong thing but he couldn't do it
[53:59] why he had been sprayed with the
[54:01] repellent of predestination they can't
[54:04] be deceived no no the word said he would
[54:06] be here amen they there ain't no devil
[54:09] going to bother him and no other Son of
[54:12] God that's predestinated to take his
[54:14] place he is sprayed with a repellent
[54:17] Satan's poison denominational doctors
[54:20] don't even touch him at all he moves
[54:22] right along nothing going to bother him
[54:25] see it didn't have an effect on him
[54:28] somebody say praise the Lord
[54:31] bride is living in a place that if
[54:33] she'll stay behind the protections of
[54:35] God's word
[54:37] God
[54:39] has made it hard to get to this bride
[54:42] unless you open the doors and ignore the
[54:45] word of God
[54:46] you say well we don't have anything
[54:48] today we don't have anything for the
[54:50] Modern Problems yes we do
[54:53] God has sent us a message of Christ of
[54:55] the last days God has restored us back
[54:57] to the word don't ever let the devil
[54:59] tell you that there's not something in
[55:01] the word for a protection and place
[55:03] against the enemy God has made it hard
[55:05] to get to this bride
[55:08] look at all the word he gave to us in
[55:10] this hour and if you'll respect it and
[55:12] you'll live it Satan can't take
[55:15] advantage of your life
[55:19] amen
[55:21] go ahead stand I'll quit preaching if
[55:23] you stand
[55:27] God has made it hard
[55:31] I'll comment on amnon and Tamar this is
[55:35] the exciting thing
[55:37] if you read later
[55:41] Tamar's life went on
[55:44] in amnon's life ended
[55:49] that's the end of the story
[55:52] Tamar went on with the Lord
[55:56] amnon days were numbered
[55:59] can you say Amen
[56:01] praise be to God guess what
[56:04] Satan's days are numbered
[56:08] Satan will come to an end someday
[56:11] but the bride will not come to an end
[56:18] this isn't the end for the bride you
[56:20] make a mistake it's not the end for you
[56:22] but there will be an end to Satan
[56:24] someday there will be an end to him
[56:27] accusing us there will be an end to his
[56:29] thoughts he's putting in our mind that
[56:30] one day the accuser of our Brethren will
[56:33] be cast down that's promises in the
[56:35] Bible aren't you glad today that there
[56:37] will be an end to this mind that's
[56:39] coming against you every day there will
[56:41] be an end to that but to the bride who's
[56:43] living in the protections there will be
[56:45] no end to her she's going from here
[56:47] she's going in a Rapture she's going in
[56:49] a thousand years of Peace honeymoon and
[56:52] then she's going to a new heavens and a
[56:53] new Earth she does an end she keeps
[56:55] going on for eternity
[56:58] even though she makes mistakes even
[57:00] though she's went through things even
[57:02] though she lived right in the middle of
[57:03] Satan's Eden with his mind just
[57:06] conniving things constantly
[57:09] conniving
[57:11] scheming what can I do to get around all
[57:16] this
[57:17] there's certain things in place brothers
[57:18] and sisters I know what you say about
[57:21] yourself but you can just say God's put
[57:23] things in place
[57:25] if I'll read it I'll feed on it I'll put
[57:27] that in my mind
[57:29] there's Protections in place
[57:32] Satan will not be able
[57:34] to get around
[57:36] I say praise the Lord
[57:39] I don't really know how to end this
[57:40] except for you bow on your heads and
[57:42] closing your eyes and praying and I'm
[57:44] going to ask you in the next
[57:47] well this service I don't mean to put it
[57:49] off so in this service
[57:51] I'm going to ask you to be very real
[57:55] the only reason that people you have
[57:56] enjoyed a lot of the services later
[57:58] lately
[57:59] I've enjoyed them
[58:01] we've heard some good things
[58:04] but I feel in my spirit the one thing
[58:06] that's really lacking is repentance
[58:09] and confession
[58:11] if we don't have repentance and
[58:13] confession
[58:14] we give the devil the advantage in our
[58:16] lives
[58:18] the only really two reasons people don't
[58:21] confess things that they've done wrong
[58:22] is because of Pride or because they're
[58:26] too afraid and embarrassed
[58:29] and I understand that
[58:31] but what would it be if you kept it
[58:34] hidden
[58:36] kept it quiet
[58:38] and Satan kept occupying a position of
[58:41] dominance in your life and he stayed
[58:43] right there
[58:46] there's a woman that committed adultery
[58:50] and
[58:51] brother Branham discerned the heart
[58:53] through the Holy Spirit and said
[58:56] 10 years later
[58:58] here she is teaching Sunday School
[59:01] and under the Holy Spirit it discerned
[59:03] but you did something in a car 10 years
[59:06] ago you committed adultery against your
[59:07] husband she was shocked by it it was
[59:10] exposed she said how did you know that
[59:11] nobody knows about that
[59:15] Holy Spirit knew about it
[59:17] not any man the Holy Spirit
[59:20] how did you know about that he said
[59:22] you're going to have to go confess that
[59:24] to your husband
[59:25] she said well I confess that to God
[59:27] years ago
[59:29] I I repented to God it's over now I said
[59:32] you need to confess it to your husband
[59:33] because you sinned against your husband
[59:36] when she went and did it confession
[59:39] completely made the devil move because
[59:41] for years she started to have
[59:43] illnesses and problems diseases and all
[59:47] this comes because she had unresolved
[59:48] unconfessed sin as soon as she confessed
[59:51] it to her husband Freedom came
[59:53] and this was the prophet's comment the
[59:56] devil has a right to sit right there
[59:59] when there's unconfessed sin
[1:00:02] now I don't know about you but I don't
[1:00:04] want to have the devil have a right
[1:00:05] anywhere in my life
[1:00:07] that's the way he said it now this is
[1:00:09] set up where the devil has a right to
[1:00:11] sit there and dominate and take
[1:00:13] advantage of you
[1:00:15] when there's things that's laying secret
[1:00:18] so I'm encouraging you in the love of
[1:00:20] the Lord
[1:00:21] take today take the coming days examine
[1:00:25] your life by the word of God and say
[1:00:27] brother Paul I have nothing to hide
[1:00:30] before the Lord
[1:00:32] before I pray would you raise your hand
[1:00:35] if you want to say I want to submit all
[1:00:38] of my devices completely to the Lord
[1:00:42] we're not going to get around some
[1:00:44] devices because we have to use them but
[1:00:47] we don't want Satan to abuse them how we
[1:00:49] will raise your hand and say I'm going
[1:00:51] to be really praying that all of my
[1:00:53] devices are not being used of the devil
[1:00:56] thank you
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:58] you see that's a personal decision with
[1:00:59] you and God it's a personal decision
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:07] thank you Jesus
[1:01:09] oh God
