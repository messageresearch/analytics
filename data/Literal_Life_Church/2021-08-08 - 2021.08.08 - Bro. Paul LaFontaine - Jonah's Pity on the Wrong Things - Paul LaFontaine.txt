========================================

jesus christ and i've been around him long enough for these years i know when he's present and he's here there isn't any problem or trouble there isn't anything that you are facing that's too big for the person that's here this morning so i ask you if you don't trust me or if you don't trust people or whatever you trust that person who's here and he'll he has the answer for you and he is the answer he not only has the answers he is the answer for your life amen jonah chapter 4 and verse 9. god said to jonah does thou well to be angry for the gourd and he said i do well to be angry even unto death and then said the lord thou hast had pity or compassion on the gourd for the which thou hast not labored neither madest it to grow which came up in a night and perished in a night you had pity on the gourd and then verse 11 and should not i spare nineveh that great city wherein are more than six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left and also much cattle and that's how jonah ends that's the last verse of it but i pray there will be something in here that we can learn from this morning how many has learned from the book of jonah already amen i trust the lord help us to express it our heavenly father it's one of those services lord that reminds me of when they dedicated the temple in the old testament and the priests could not stand to minister because of the glory of the lord that filled the place i feel that way a bit this morning lord i feel to just go in a corner somewhere and praise you and worship you thank you for what you've done and thank you for what you've thank you how you love each of these people here lord you know how to love us lord so we thank you for your glory and your presence and lord the heavens and earth will pass away but we know when we have your word we have everything so when i minister it this morning i pray that you will take it and anoint it lord let it be for each person as we learn from your word and learn the great lesson that jonah had to learn that your ways are higher than ours lord and we're to trust your ways because your thoughts are higher your ways are higher you know better than us so that's why we can trust you we love you lord put these things in your hands now for your glory in jesus name amen amen once you shake somebody's hand before you take your seat greet them in the name of the lord god bless you each one hey man pull myself together here a bit this morning praise the lord so we're going to go look this morning a little bit at jonah's life and we'll see how far we get we're just going to look at it just towards the end and i wanted to say this that something lord showed me that as he opens up the book of jonah to me and for those of you who don't know back when kovid was hitting so strong last year i started to read jonah and that's when things began to i begin to get curious about it because there's a lot in it that i didn't understand there's still some that i don't understand but it is a very mysterious life and jonah has a very mysterious and strange way that he responded to god and it became very i became inquisitive about it and so it's been that long since last year that i finally get to preach a series on it and it has opened up but one of the things that i seen is at the end of the old testament we know that there came an expression of christ at the very end of the old testament there came a final expression of a mystery that was in the old testament and that was jesus christ and so at the end of the old testament it all climaxed into jesus christ and he came and he everything that the types and shadows were speaking of in the prophets it had a climax time to come to jesus christ coming to earth going to calvary paying for our sins and then resurrecting the third day and so it all climaxed and he paid the price at calvary for us he went into a tomb and he come out the third day and so and then then if we know the scripture then we know at the end of the new testament he will do the same thing in the sense there will be a final expression of the same christ at the end of the new testament but it will be the same christ in his people the bride of jesus christ so it all kind of builds up and mounts up and and it gets explosive and then it explodes and there's this full expression so at the end of it is christ again and and you live during this time when this final expression of christ comes through our lives as the bride of jesus christ and so as we as we looked at this um short story in the bible of jonah and we've seen his flaws and we've seen his running from the lord and we've seen his uh his attitude and his anger his attitude to toward god even for giving mercy to the ninevites and anger and prejudice to the to the ninevites and and justice basically a stubbornness in jonah uh and uh you know his life with all of that stubbornness and with all of that anger his book in the bible his first part of his life the first pattern of his chapter typed the death burial and resurrection of jesus christ and you remember jesus said that he said you're looking for a sign he said i'll give you a sign as jonas was in the belly of the fish for three days show the so shall the son of man be in the earth and come out again the third day so no matter what we think of jonah and how bad it would look his life was a type of christ coming the first time that's pretty good can you say mine and so his his you know we look at all his life but it his life was written the death burial resurrection of christ and that's why jesus said it that way but what what god showed me in this last chapter it also has the mystery written of the bride in the last days the last chapter of jonah's life believe it or not has this mystery written of christ in his bride in the last days and what he lives through and what he's trying to express at the very end and we'll get to that and you'll know why i'm saying that but it isn't wonderful that a guy that uh we would mark off as being he doesn't look like a son of god he's not acting like a son of god he's got all the characteristics that just don't seem like as i said last sunday i would have just stopped the chapter right there at the third chapter and got a new recruit and just ditched jonah i would have ditched jonah completely but then i said it's difficult to ditch him because his name's on the book it's called jonah so you can't ditch him and incidentally your name is on the lamb's book of life too and you can't ditch you either can you say amen hallelujah but we would get rid of him but we couldn't and so now there's got to be something in here towards the end of his life that's expressing if he expressed the first coming of christ then he's expressing the second coming of christ but it's just hard to catch the mystery in it but if you keep looking and reading it becomes so plain that there's something in here that in this last chapter is something for us to draw from it's difficult to draw that conclusion on how this man is acting his anger his stubbornness and so it becomes an example of us all because no matter how perfect that you feel that you are this morning and some people think they're perfect and some people feel they're good people and that's all fine and dandy but if you're a son and daughter of god he's got to work on us and get all of the anger out of us and all the stubbornness out of us i know probably not nobody here is ever stubborn but jonah was and there's a lot of stubborn people that are christians that come a hard way and finally surrender can you say amen and if you think for one moment i've looked at this and seen me perfect i'll tell you i see way too much of me in jonah in this series i told someone the other day this has been a personal reflection for me because i see way too much i'm not perfect at all for sure and i'm not where i need to be but i'm i'm in the right place and i'm in the right presence this morning can you say amen lord people think you're super spiritual as a pastor man you can preach some real masterpieces you must be really walking in the spirit all the time you know i was going to tell you a couple sundays ago i had a dream this is how spiritual i am sometimes you think you have spiritual dreams and i've had spiritual dreams i haven't had a dream that my wife and i and this is just before about a couple hours before i come out to preach i had a dream that me and my wife were invited to go on a ufo this is my dream this you know and i come and preach and we had a great service this is two three hours before and i'm sleeping in a real deep sleep and this is what i that's what i dream about and i get mad i get mad at that i say lord can't i have a spiritual dream before i preach we were invited to go on a ufo and we i seen it come down in the dream and it hovered down and all the stairway came out from the ufo and i said honda we've been invited to go on this ufo and but i got nervous and i begin to delay because i was wondering if there's going to be enough snacks up there i'm serious this is what i'm thinking so we're around a bunch of stores and i'm i start running in these stores and pilfering through these snacks and twinkies and everything i'm i'm buying up and my wife she's out there waiting on me and there's only a certain amount of time to get on the ufo and i'm just buying up these and then when i get all these snacks and i'm thinking now do i do i need a phone charger up there or or does or does it just charge on its own in the ufo you laugh but that's what i'm thinking in my dream buy a few phone chargers and i'm doing this and all of a sudden and i don't know why it ends this way but i got left she went up the stairs and i'm running out with my snacks and the door closes and i miss it she goes without me and that's the end of my spiritual dream before i come up and preach i hate that and i hate the fact i'm even telling you you probably lose respect just be telling you that's how the dream was and i got left with all my snacks if you i tell you this i just saw this if you ask my wife it is the lord trying to tell me something there's a lot of meaning in that dream if you would ask my wife of what's most important in my life going with my wife on the trip or snacks but in jonah's life there's so much here that is just so opposite and we would have dumped him out but i'll tell you one thing god didn't and god kept working with him as we spoke last sunday he kept working with him and he's going to keep working with sons and daughters of god because we're in the time of adoption and we are to mature into adopted sons and we're to embrace all the word of god that he's given us and we're not to compromise on any of it and we're supposed to grow because it's not just that we would get a good feeling in the service or be able to shout and dance we want to be able to live just as high as we shout and we want to be able to see the expression of christ in our life that is the maturity of a a full matured son and daughter of god that's the age we're in the word that we've received is a word of adoption to take the people to adoption and i'm looking to see that in my life i'm looking to see it in your life that's what this message is meant to do not for us to have another healing revival although i enjoy that but it's to take the people as i said last sunday it's not how much you shout on sunday at church it's how your behavior is through the week praise the lord and so now you know it's difficult to draw the conclusion that this man had written in his life christ and in his his biography is our writing of christ himself when we look at the stubbornness when we look at the anger how can the very mystery of christ and the bride come out of all this and you ask the question can any good thing come out of jonah can any good thing come out of this last chapter of this man i want to remind everybody that that's what they said about jesus where he come from they said can any good thing come out of nazareth because nazareth when i was in israel a couple years ago nazareth is still to this day a city that's looked down on it doesn't look that that prosperous at all and back then it was even less prosperous and had some real bad people in it and all these other things and so when they said the messiah come out of there they said can any good thing come out of of nazareth that's what they said about it and that's jonah can any good thing come out of this life the last chapter of jonah i asked you the same question can any good thing come out of your life after all that you've been through can any good think of only by the grace of god something good can come out of it no matter what your life biography has been if he can bring it out of christ and where he come from and that city then he can bring it out of you as well can you say amen so before we're so critical of jonah we're looking at the mirror and and and we're looking to see before we examine the fruit in his life and examine the fruit in everybody else's life because that's what people tend to do they tend to become fruit inspectors and examine the fruit in everybody else's life this series has been a mirror to look at our own lives amen praise the lord and uh the first part reveals christ coming out of the tomb the second part is where we are right now and the mystery of the end time the conditions right now and what is needed and specific i'll say it the conditions right now that we're in the conditions of the bride the conditions of our life and what is needed and how god will deal with us to get what is needed for the hour and we'll elaborate on that what is needed for this particular hour in the final seconds of time we are at the end time if you're a visitor here today we are very we're at the very closing seconds of time we're at the end time it's the wrap up of everything things will not continue as they were before christ is has launched his second coming can you say man we're in the cycle of the second coming of christ so i would encourage you to look to god if you're a visitor this morning look to god if you're anyone this morning look to the lord it's time to seek the lord it's time to get closer to him it's not time to get further away and we're in that cycle but what is he doing right now and what is needed for the bride in this hour how should we respond and then jonah shows how god deals with jonah to get this result out of us and to bring us to a place really to bring us to a place that we realize that anger is one thing but that god himself his love and his compassion is greater than his anger amen how many know god gets angry he has a holy anger but we learn throughout the bible at the end of the day his compassion is greater than his anger i would like to live that way how many would raise your hand that something overrides in your life and your compassion is greater than your anger so all jonah you know really all jonah is eating jonah is needing a victory in divine love how many knows the bride that's what we're looking to a victory in divine love amen jonah needs a victory in divine love that's what he's needed is the same thing that we need a victory in divine love and so if we take a step back from wednesday night god ordered some things to test jonah he he made he he made him look at what he was lacking in his life and so he got real personal to see what he really did it was really to see what jonah was tied to and he was so tied to his anger and his unresolved anger whatever that anger came from god wanted to put a mirror in front of him and take him through things to be able to see this is what you look like this is where you're at of course you're not ready to minister to the ninevites or be happy they're they're repenting because there's some unresolved anger in your life and i want to keep letting you look at this until you die to it and so god touches a certain personal area of his life in other words his convenience it's the hot sun he's in the hot sun and god raises up within a few hours a gourd or a lily plant or a you know a certain type of plant and it it shades him and then the bible says he's extremely happy and then it turns around a worm begins to eat it and it's gone the next day he becomes extremely angry again and so god is really showing what jonah is tied to and where his emotions are going and see what his absolute really was we will have that in our life jonah was up and down in his commitment he was in and out and i'm just rehearsing some things real quickly just for the visitors so they catch up jonah was up and down as his commitment he was never fully in he was in and he was out he was led by how he felt rather than god's will the temperature outside affected his attitude that sounds like some of us sometimes the weather report affects whether we're going to be happy or not the temperature outside affects people's attitudes and this is what was what it was with jonah the ninevites affected his attitude because he didn't really initially like the ninevites and if things were going well in the weather and everything else he was real happy if everything was running smooth he was re he wasn't just happy he was real happy uh and when he was happy he was supportive he paid his ties he did what god told him to do if he was feeling happy and if the week turned out real good he was so pleasant to be around and he was happy but if the week didn't turn out good and things didn't turn out convenient he went back to his angry self again and god in his love tested him to show that he was not tied to the absolute of christ the word he was actually when push come to shove he sweated over the little things rather than the important things and in this case souls somebody i'm i asked you to put your seatbelt on this one because i'm going to be very plain and specific i've been preaching along now and i just it's time to get real specific now let's read the quote from wednesday night because this was a coat that i felt like not just the wednesday night crowd should hear but the sunday crowd as well so we need and we need to hear this agree again so he speaks in the message um in one of the messages here towards the end and he speaks of jonah and he says in the day that we're living now if you guys have that quote back there in the day that we're living in now and everything's so breaking up so fragile and carried away i think that this message would be very appropriate thing especially to christians when they are going through their deep waters now the christian church is passing through the deepest waters it's had for the last 2 000 years so the message he's going to preach is the absolute and he said the christian church is passing through the deepest water it's had for the 2000 years because we are coming to a spot to where there is something presented to christianity something they have to make a decision on and that would be false the antichrist spirit a false christianity that'll be presented and people will fall by that we're not interested in false christianity we want true christianity but we live in an hour that there will be a test of the antichrist spirit to choose false christianity or true christianity and we're coming to the spot that said something that we have to make a decision on and i think that the christian church ought to have something that they know that they are tied to instead of just floating about like a leaf upon the water the wind as the bible said carried about by every wind of doctrine we spoke about the different winds on wednesday night the eastern wind god sent jonah an eastern wind a vehement easter wind eastern wind we have north winds we have south winds and all of those represent spiritual pressures in our lives and to test us whether we will stand through the winds and then in ephesians he says we don't be children carried about with every wind of doctrine the winds come and blow the little leaf this way and then another one comes the north wind the south wind the east wind the west wind you'll never get anywhere you're not stable but the cr the christian life should be a stable life it would be something that's a principle that you are tied to that is more than life itself we need a principle of life that we're tied to that is more than life itself that's why paul could say to for me to live it's christ to die is gain we need an absolute to tie to but look what he says here he said and you must have something that you're tied to some people are tied to their business and that shows up in their life with push come to serve they're tied to their business more than they are to the lord some are tied to their families when push comes to shove they're tied more than their families than they are to the lord and their commitment to the lord some are tied to their creed some are tied to the uh tied to an army post we have a different things that we're tied to but i think as a christian we ought to be tied where we know is right you see because you might be tied to your family and your wife could leave you you might be tied to the army you might get killed you might be tied to any different things and it's got an end but there has got to be a final title post there's got to be something somewhere excuse me be somewhere that man has got to tie for his eternal destination because if you're going to trust in your work when your work is finished it's done when your family is taken it's over but there's only one thing that i think is a final tie post and i believe paul had a thai post in his life here and i'd like to sign in and if we'd call it that way and speak on that typos he said for me to live is christ and to die is gain paul had an absolute in his life paul had the final the final say in paul's life was not family was not business with not the pressures of life but it's what the lord says to do and whether i'm going to obey the lord or not and i'm going to live that way and if i have to die doing it i'll die doing it but i'm going to for me to live as christ to die is gain either way i win but i'm going to serve the lord anyhow how many wants that absolute this morning that's the thai post not your family your family may fail you people have a comfort blanket and resort back to their family all the time but you need to be tied to the lord because your family may not be there someday oh i don't believe that brother but my family all stick with i always stick with me there's a lot of families that learn that's not true especially if you make a real stand for the lord you'll have some family members leave you that's why you need to be tied to the lord tied to his word not your family i love family i love my family but i'm not tied my final tie post isn't to my family it's to the lord and so so for me to live is christ to die so that's where we find jonah we find that he wasn't tied to the right thing and today we're going to find out what he's really tied to and this is where we pick up our text again in verse 9 god says i i don't want to get to skip over this part of verse 9. god asked him the question do us thou well to be angry for the gourd so god says is your anger doing you well is it good for you to stay angry god's asking isn't it really amazing when the lord asks us honest questions whether it's anger or anything else he said he said jonah is is it is it really doing you well to stay with unresolved festering anger on the inside when the lord asks you those questions make sure you answer honestly is it really doing you good to stay in this festering anger at me and at other people you may not be angry at god this morning some people are angry at god you just may have had too many years of being angry and festering and with people and how they've done you wrong people in the church people outside the church preachers so anger has a way of in its innocence it has an innocence because our emotion we can get angry at something but we have to be angry at the right things and not angry at the wrong things and anger has a way of growing like a cancer like bitterness does and it just grows and grows and grows and if we don't deal with it then it starts to spill out and control our lives and then we get to jonah where he begins to take up with pity and stupid things and forget the compassion that he needs for other people that's why we got to die to our anger because if it festers it hinders our work of the lord it hinders us being free it hinders us being a free christian anger if it grows on the inside and it's never good and that's why when god said to jonah is it good for you to stay angry you're going to be surprised at his answer but the answer should have been no it is never good to hang on to your anger it is never does any good to hang on to it if it festers you've got to bring it to the cross and say god as you forgive us god help me and send a wave of forgiveness to wash away this bitterness and anger i have got to resolve this if if my dad or my daddy never repents to me or my mommy or the people in my life that's done me wrong i can resolve it through the cross of jesus christ i can see it healed within me so that i can go on and live my anger is not going to hold there until somebody makes it right i'm going to release it to calvary can you say that we have to do it because it's not good it brings bad things if you're a person that doesn't harbor a lot of anger on the inside of you i say praise the lord that's how you should be living but for the rest of us sometimes that lets something sit there and the devil gets a hold of it it can hinder our spiritual spiritual walk and we have to resolve it that's why he says in ephesians he says be angry and sin not don't let the sun go down on your wrath why because it grows it festers and we have to release it we have to forgive so when he asks does it do any good for you to stay angry at others at me at my will at when things go different than you wanted is it right and his answer should have been no anger has never done me well and then you could start explaining what anger has done for you anger has never done any anybody well you should be answering anger has never done me good as a matter of fact it has broken family relationships it has tore kids hearts to pieces it has tore churches up it has split churches it has made preachers abuse the people i'm telling you there's nothing good that ever comes from unresolved anger never been anything good come from and that's why we have to say lord you know what's inside me come lord no jonah should have been saying and once again here responds so he responds so crazy but he should have been saying no my anger hasn't done me good my whole life and lord i'm ready to bring it to you so i can be effective for your kingdom and uh we can list the things that it it destroys and if it destroyed things in your parents or your former church or whatever then it'll do the same work and you if you don't stop it right here and say i'm i'm done with this my dad was an angry man my mom was an angry person my you know and you can point back to that but you got to say lord this has to stop here that's one of the things sometimes i like about young people is that they don't have all the the history sometimes and they're more flexible to work with and more teachable they have less bitterness and less anger and so they're more teachable if you get older you develop all these disappointments in life disappointed in people it kind of grows and it's harder to get to you because you become a overly angry person at things and you put people in compartments and you you don't trust anybody but a young heart and brother brahm says this he speaks about that brother brahm says you know it's easier for the lord to get to you when you're young you see but i find today it's interesting that the devil wants to even poison and make young people bitter so he's going for the young ones and to take their innocence and make them bitter towards life and make them i don't have any thrust of life young people are supposed to be thriving and ready and excited about what's next in their life the devil can discourage them and they're not excited about life they still want to want to sit around and mope around and just watch movies all the time and they don't have that but there should be a vibrance in the holy ghost and then serving the lord there should be a vibrance about life that you're excited about the future that's the way it should be but i like working with young people because a lot of times they'll come and they'll they'll attend camps and they'll come things because they don't have all the history of all the separations that are supposed to be and we're not supposed to be with those people we're not supposed to be with those people they just come to the camp because they don't have those past hurts and experiences and they just come we want to be friends in the lord we want to walk we want to hear from the word that's why i hang around young people praise the lord there's something innocent about it something wonderful but you get some of the older ones they really need to die to those old old bitter battles holding on for dear life i'm never going gonna do this and i'm never gonna be around and that i'm leaving that church because i can't stand being around that person in that church i just they drive me crazy i'm sick of them so i'm gonna move to another church and god will have somebody just like that in the new church because why you're a jonah and you've got to be tested with your bitterness your anger and your you know if you move there if you're looking for the perfect church this is not the one i guarantee you this is not it but if you if you're wanting to move to a perfect church don't move there because when you get there it won't be perfect anymore oh did i just say that no perfect church but when there's a pure innocent people humble humble to say we just want to come hear the word be transformed by the holy ghost we just want to serve the lord we don't want politics we don't want drama i find there's a lot of people telling me that just give me a place a safe place to come just to hear the word of god no politics no drama no gossip praise the lord that's the way it should be we discourage that around here don't sit home and chew up people and no just don't do it don't do it let the holy spirit lead our lives somebody needs to be changed pray the holy spirit makes the change in that person that young person wearing something they shouldn't wear pray the holy spirit deals with their heart let the holy spirit lead the church instead of our own minds so this is where he says no he he's supposed to say no and he know what he answers he says yep he says yes you know what i do well to be angry he was so caught up with the way he was and so used to it he said you know what lord i got a right to be angry and if i die angry i will be fine with that he's a pretty bitter guy pretty angry to speak to the lord that way and just say you know what i got a right to be angry and that's just a huge lie you never have a right to stay angry lord said jonah just look at yourself right now look at you right now look what you just said really and then he goes into this jonah you're having pity on a plant that died but no compassion for the ninevites so now he's gonna he's gonna just in the next sentence he's gonna he's gonna help jonah look in a mirror and see just how pitiful he really is because he's putting emphasis on lesser things like the plant like the gourd and he's got so upset that that little plant has died so quickly and he's having such pity and compassion on his plans i was going to say on his dog too but i'm not going to say that because we have too many dog lovers here i don't know what you call this but this is just a strange awkward weird compassion that he had a misdirected compassion i don't know he has his focus on the wrong place i wonder sometimes we have our focus on the wrong thing and we're sweating over little things and we're getting angry over little things that just don't matter at all am i preaching to anybody this morning we're sweating over we're worried over we're getting we're making a big deal out of little issues and and sometimes that's what jonah was doing and so he has a misdirected compassion he has a focus on the wrong place he allows his care and his anger even to be taken up for a plant that died and less concern for souls we never want to be that way we can't grow into the bride of jesus christ and be who we are if we have more concern about life things and little penalties petty things instead of souls we must have a compassion for souls especially now our children's souls can you say that our other brothers and sisters in the church our own children the brothers and sisters the ones that are unsaved the ones who have left the message right now is the time for us to be focused on prayer and compassion for souls at the time of judgment can you say amen at the time of the end in a few weeks i want to get into lord and abraham and abraham praying for a lot because we see lot was making some great crazy decisions too but his only hope was abraham praying for him and crying for him lord would you spare them that's where we're at right now and if we have our focus on something other than it's supposed to be we're going to miss out on opportunities to be used of the lord to show christ love and compassion so interesting brother braham said yesterday he says we're in a time in shalom he says it my what a message we'll get into that more not in this service but another but he says he says we're in a time people are darkened that means they don't understand they don't know what they're doing and he says they're darkened and so you know what he says some people he says we are living epistles written in red of all man some people will never understand god except through you he said that my in other words they're not going to go on social media and understand who god really is they're going to understand a real god that's living in your life they're going to understand a god of the bible and a god that's real but they're going to understand god better not somebody's impersonation of god not some new new jesus that they created do you know in the churches today they've created their own jesus it's not a jesus of the bible but it's the jesus of their whole idol and concoction can you say a man in this this image this is our jesus and and and and he has all that to it and he lets us where we want what we want to wear he lets us cost he lets us smoke our cigarettes and do all these other things and still be a christian they've created their own jesus but i'm here to tell you there's a jesus of the bible and he's still the same yesterday today and forever he's still living today and where he's living is in his people and people will understand the true god through our lives that's how powerful it is that's where we need to be available but so many times we're like jonah that we're so distracted to petty things and uh praise the lord if you've grown beyond that i'm not preaching at you this morning but so many times we're like jonah we allow the care and anger for something little to override how much are we sweating over small stuff that means really nothing jonah jonas oh you poor little helpless little plant you're dying here's all the ninevites he's been watching from the hill and they're all over there repenting he should have he should have been shouting his souls are coming to the lord you've got people sometimes that i don't mean to be this critical but when the spirit's moving that's when you take off and you don't i tell you sometimes you need to stay and pray if you care about souls more than your dinner that's at home with the holy spirit's movement we should stay with that because souls are more important than your dinner souls are more important than your project at home and jonah said oh you poor little he's having pity on this thing it's starting to dry up and die oh this one isn't because it's fake you poor little network it's just i'm really you know what you're upset and i'm going to be upset with you i'm going to be angry with you because i'm good at being angry poor little thing here's all the ninevites over there and he's god points this out he said you're having compassion on a little gourd plant well it was big but you haven't you're having pity on this little plant and then in one night the worm comes up and these getting angry at the wormholes and worms i hate worms i can't stand those worms what do you think yeah you hate worms too i hate worms this is it's all in this realm of being caught up with this plant that died caught up in the wrong thing obsessed with the wrong thing praise the lord when the holy spirit's dealing with us it makes us squirm a little bit your business you should not be obsessed with your business you should not be obsessed with your new truck it's not important more important than souls your soul or someone else's oh i feel such pity for you i can't believe that the worm did that and all this happened and he's so focused on that and just this ivy pled i love you and you've been a victim in all this and i've been a victim and you've been a victim we're victims in all this you've been done wrong you're mad at that worm i'll be mad with you i hate worms you poor little gourd meanwhile no compassion for the souls coming to repentance angry at all the wrong things consume with all the wrong things i probably need to be more specific jonah a dying plant a dying people what's more important a scratch on your truck or a brother you've not forgiven a bad year for your investments or a huge limitless demand for bibles all over the world that they've never had a bible before that's all right that's right somebody bullied you at your school oh somebody bullied you while jesus was mocked by your social media friends and gamers you hang with custap you were bullied your lord was mocked somebody looked at me critically at church i know they looked at me at what i was aware and they were looking so critical and you miss the presence of the lord over and over again because somebody looked at you critically and god says is that really something to get that hyped up about i didn't like my supper last night it just wasn't what i wanted my drink wasn't made right at starbucks i'm mad are you really you're mad because your drink wasn't made right your supper wasn't you complained to your mom or your wife it just wasn't quite what i wanted they didn't make it olive garden they didn't make it like they usually do i met it really god says you're getting mad at this when 811 million people went to bed hungry last night all of us americans we need this to be balanced out my jobs didn't go well this week i'm so angry about it everything did just come together and i couldn't get them all done i couldn't do this and some of your children need salvation right now which is more important my boyfriend broke up with me i'm so angry with the way he did it i need someone really bad seek ye first the kingdom of god and all these things will be added unto you what about the kingdom just obsessed with the boyfriend the boyfriend the boy it's everything and i got hold on for dear life no you don't i'll tell you the thing that you hold on to for dear life the holy ghost the comforter christ that's what you hold on to for your life should we go on i got about 10 amends i need a little bit more than that i can't wait i can't wait until i'm just obsessed with the next avengers segment coming out i can't wait to it i can't wait till the next service wednesday night can you say man i can't wait till the next service you see how we become obsessed with earthly things i don't feel like worshiping today i've had a bad week i'm not going to stand up when the song leader says to stand up i'm not going to sing i just don't feel like moving i'm just going to sit here if i feel like entering in i've had a real bad week you let your emotions control you god let you look at it say all right go right ahead you had a you're mad you had a bad week and over here let everything that hath breath praise the lord bring the sacrifice of praise you override your tiredness every morning when you go to work at eight or seven or six or whenever it is or five in the morning i never had jobs like that to get up at five in the morning i didn't believe there was a five in the morning like there was at night but there is i guess but no matter how tired you are no matter how much a little sniffle you got you're there like clockwork so committed so faithful and yet you haven't read your bible in a week too tired your eyes start to get droopy too tired to come to church i'm not making too many friends here this morning but i think we should look at what jonah was looking at wonder how many will die from this next phase of kovid i say this politely i wonder over here how many souls are dying without god we become angry at this and obsessed with this over here but we can't do this and forget souls jesus said don't fear that one that would destroy the body but fear him who would destroy the soul and the body we're imbalanced and if we're going to be respectful and concerned about something we ought to throw ourselves in with souls because if that soul is saved and filled with the holy spirit if god takes him we know where they're going walmart didn't have what i wanted i went over there and spent the whole day saturday looking for it they didn't have what i wanted this is the bad side by the way spent the whole day there that's why i was so tired sunday morning i couldn't go to church because i spent the whole day at walmart saturday all my energy got used up but after the whole time i couldn't they didn't have what i wanted and maybe there was a soul at walmart that you didn't have time to talk to slow down and say here's somebody who's interacting with me and i could invite them to church i could say something to them and you didn't have time to do it because you got to get what you got to get because you need to get the project done at home i'm telling you friends we've got to change our lives we're not here to just do projects at home i'm preaching to myself and to you our full calling is not to finish projects at home and all the husbands are saying praise the lord i'm glad you told my wife that this morning they're going to remind them this week honey we're not here to do projects at home he's already saying it to his wife right back there he's always already telling we're not here that's not the obsession our business that's not that's not why we're here it's not why god called you to this message it's to be a holy ghost-filled representative to be available anytime for god to use us for his kingdom not your kingdom his kingdom and any money that we make whether it be ten dollars or a million dollars whatever god blesses you to make even that is focused on the kingdom take what you need to live by but you better have a kingdom perspective on what you're making and i'm not taking it off an offering right now that's how a television preacher would do it right there it's time for the offering no no i don't we don't have to do that here we never have to push for money god's taken care of us for 31 years there's no been no pushes anything like that we let the needs be known and god is taking care of us reminders we have but listen i'm not worried about it but your money all of it belongs to god i made it i worked for it well who gave you the strength to work who gave you the strength to work who gave you strength to go to your job god did so all of it everything that we own belongs to him and it has must be related to his kingdom how can i accomplish something for the kingdom whether it be overseas or whether it be in my own home i want to have a kingdom mind in my in my heart i want to think about the kingdom and the reason i have to say these simple things this may be very simple to some maybe you've grown beyond this praise the lord that you're there you're kingdom minded but you have to say it in this laodicean generation because we have so many distractions to put us on petty little things like the plant that we have pity on and we get angry at and forget the kingdom of god forget the salvation of our children forget what's important amen we should be about the kingdom more than anything can you say amen not petty things that will pass away this will all be gone this world is not my home i'm just passing through so there's a powerful part in here in the last verse that we'll get to and bring this to a close now i'm doing good it's only 20 to 1. you're still with me amen so there's just a real powerful part here i want to end on and it's in this last verse and you remember brother ben says i'd like to speak on jonah sometime and break all these things down the eastern wind and all this stuff and he says you even see jesus christ in there and so here at the last verse we see jesus christ in this last verse express and he says and i and should not i spare verse 11 should not i spare nineveh that great city where are more than six score thousands persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattle here's what brother bram says jesus christ is expressed here we find jesus christ expressed right here i'll reword it so you understand it i'll reword it the way jesus said it at the cross forgive them father they know not what they do so he points to the ninevites and when he says these words six thousand six four thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand what he means by that if you find other scriptures it means that they don't know what they're doing they don't know the sin that they're living in they don't have any knowledge of god or light of god light is knowledge of revelation darkness is lack of revelation lack of knowledge they don't he's trying to get jones to see they don't know what they're doing they need an advocate they need someone to pray for them because what they're doing they have no discernment to know what they're doing we become so critical of people because they know better than doing that they know what they're doing but i'll tell you in a lot of cases in this hour people's minds and thinking becomes numb by social media by movies and everything they become numb spiritually and they're living a life and they don't know what they're doing that's why jesus said it at the cross forgive them father they know not what they do and yet he still forgave them yet he still had compassion on them now this is where we're at friends and this is where we'll take the next service that we have to talk about compassion because to me this brings compassion to a level a deeper level that i'm a little afraid to go to sometimes but it brings compassion to a whole different level is realizing that person we say they know what they're doing they're adamantly doing it they're in rebellion against god sometimes they don't know what they're doing and they need my compassion and my forgiveness and my expression of christ from calvary and you'll see brother bradham deal with this we'll cover it in shalom because he come through a process even while he was preaching the seals of a complex that he said and he got accomplished people weren't listening to him and he developed an attitude towards the rickies and the requettas that were just in rebellion and these ricky's out there and he said god begin to correct him and he come to the scripture in shalom darkness was a isaiah 60. darkness was upon the face of the deep and gross darkness on the people that means lack of understanding of what they're doing they don't know the sin that they're living in now if you can look at it in that light we should be able to really have more compassion instead of they should know what they're doing they grew up in the church and they know better it's easy to say that but sometimes their mind becomes so dark they don't know what they're doing and that's where they need christ to say i forgive you can you say amen i want to be a light to you you're in darkness i'm the light can you say a man i am the light of the world jesus said you i'm the light of the world ye are the light of the world a city that can sit on a hill we are we are carriers of light this morning i'm going to tell you if you've got some darkness in your life i am a carrier of light you're being exposed to light here this morning which means you're hearing the understanding and revelation of god and you know what it's supposed to do pierce the darkness in your life kill the dark drive it away so you can be free i'm a carrier of light i can help you if you let me help you that's why visitors come sometimes and it's just so different for them to come into the presence of the lord wherever they're at in church and feel the presence of the lord it's just so odd and there's so much darkness in their understanding it's so bound that they don't trust it they know something's trying to pierce through and they block up and they walk out that door i just can't do it it's because you're bound up by darkness your former understanding your former teaching but if you trust him the light will shine through he'll drive away the darkness you know why i know that because when he said let there be light at the beginning that's what he did he spoke the first words he said let there be light and when he spoke it the prophet said it took maybe took thousands of years to pray spread over the earth and bring up all the seeds but when he said that to be light that was it and the quicker that he would respond to that light the darkness is all driven driven driven driven back driven back driven back and you come into the light you become a child of the light we enter a whole new level of compassion when we love and seek souls whose understanding has been so darkened that they don't know what they're doing they don't want to be the way that they are i'm quoting from brother branham and shalom they're nice people and many of them don't want to be in that condition but something binds them to it darkness has a way of binding in an understanding that won't let them see revelation we pick up a prophet who introduced us to this because of his own correction from the lord in our in our correcting and i'll mention in the sermons to you that this is expressed through brother branham and you can listen to them through the seals he's dealing with a complex but he comes to the message after the seal standing in the gap and it's in that message he expresses this complex and that's where he expresses i had been critical of the rickeys and raketas and he says i realized lord you died for them i needed to change my attitude towards them oh they're still rickies they're still slickers they're still worldly and some church people turning against the word so so in order for god to change them he said i need to change a different level of compassion it's so easy for us in the message to label somebody's serpent seed we've got so fine-tuned at this and i wouldn't call it fine-tuned it's some other thing than fine tune because it's not fine we got this word we get so sharp with it serpent seed write them off write them off i'm preaching to you a deeper level of compassion if we want to see people changed and we have to change so he expresses it in standing in the gap then he comes to the message humble thyself and he says i just realized i needed a little change in me not that i was sinning or anything he said but i needed a little change in my heart you know what that change was and humble myself he says i've got this terr wrong attitude towards those he said it seems to me if you would preach and say get out of that river you're headed towards the falls get out of that get out of that and you say it that would be enough they would get out of the boat and take your warning he said but people aren't doing it today and he says to me if i gave the warning let him go ahead and float down the river and i'll just go to go to someone else and he said god corrected me he said i ought to be running down the bank and continue to reach out and show compassion and keep trying he's bringing his prophet to a different level of compassion and that's what he's trying to bring jonah to he comes and he cares do you care he cares but do you care god can care and love all he wants to but do you care because some of us get the place we just don't care anymore it comes to shalom which we'll speak over the next few weeks shalom such a powerful thing showing darkness it's gross upon the people they don't know what they're doing but light is shining to still draw those out of the darkness oh i want a powerful message and he comes into 65 god who is rich in mercy god who's rich in mercy and i'm re i'm listing these services because this is where he's bringing something to us in this subject matter and that is we're in an hour where people need a god who's rich rich in mercy can you say amen when the times become severe and extreme then we need a god who's rich in mercy right we don't need a god rich in judgment we don't need a god rich writing people off we need to get god rich in mercy so salvation can really come don't you ever limit the mercies of god then he comes to the last one i'm going to mention god's power to transform and even in this he's trying to say to us no matter how dark and under the mud in the beginning when he said let there be light no matter how dark and how much the seed was buried under the mud no matter how much when he said let there be light if light pierces that if light touches that seed there's a power within the seed to come out of any darkness that they're in and that's why i say don't write somebody off because you could say some they are so dark in their understanding they will never see this they will never they are so their walls are up so bad there's been so mistaught by denominational creeds and dogmas they'll never see the light of this don't you never say that because when he said let there be light there was a lot of seeds laying in a lot of deep mud but they had what he taught us is there there was power within the seed to transform itself and begin growing if you're a believer here this morning and you may not see yourself a believer but if you're a seed of god and that you've got that part of god in you when light shines if you'll receive it you'll come out of any darkness that you're in you'll be washed of any sin that you've done you'll be cleaned by the blood of the lamb you'll set your life free as a son and daughter of god and your mind that holds it i'll never be that i'll never be even that will be crafts where god says yes you will be a son of god yes you will grow in this you will be a child of the light but you've got to let the light shine and i love the fact if you guys want to bring that last quote up i love the fact that they can be in the deepest mud and somehow when that light begins to shine something in the seed begins to spring out of the darkness praise the lord let's give them worship let's give them praise you know why it was brother sister because somebody we're the light of the world somebody had the right kind of compassion and love and burden by compassion it's not tolerance for sin but it's true compassion i forgive them father forgive them they know not they don't even know what they're doing they can't even think straight right now they're not even in their right minds how many know people right now you know they're not in the right minds let me see i'm not in my right mind maybe you're saying it about yourself but you know people there they're just the reason that they're not coming along is they're not even in their right mind this age would go totally insane brother said insanity is everywhere people can't think with sound minds anymore but i got an answer i got a man that was the maniac of gadirah that was filled with all kinds of demons and insane in one moment in the presence of jesus christ he got his mind back he got his mind back he could think clearly and brother brad says he went to his family and for years they hadn't seen him because he'd become a maniac and he was the changed man by being in the presence of the lord one time come back to his family fully clothed because he was naked he was so insane he tore his clothes off all these other but he he was the bible says he was in his right mind and fully clothed which made brother branham say you're not really in your right mind until you come to jesus christ you can't think clearly and properly without jesus christ power of transformation now when he said let there be light maybe there might have been hundreds of years maybe 800 years before there ever was a light but it come to pass because god said so i love this part and god is going to have a church i don't care how many dark ages we go through or whatever more god's going to have a church he is going to have a church can he come he is going to have a church without spot or wrinkle whether we are part of it or not because he has already said it was going to happen it's going to be there so when you talk about gross darkness upon the people it looks hopeless it looks like there won't be any more come in it looks like people can't find and accept this word of the light of the last days it looks so dim but he's encouraging us he's going to have a church it's going to come out of the darkness no matter how much darkness it's in whether we are part of or not he's going to have a church because he has already said it was going to happen it's going to be there you look at after two thousand years and they go through the dark ages like they did in the church ages went through deep dark times and then light becomes to come up in luther wesley and pentecost and then the full light of the opening of the seals full revelation understanding expressed in this last days we live in an exciting time friends and that that light just burst forth but we are livers of that light we are carriers of that light you need to hold the confidence and the compassion in your heart that there's no person under the deepest darkness that the light can't pierce through this is a powerful light this isn't head knowledge and just a bunch of books and tapes and cds and on our shelves this is light and he gave us that light to shine upon others jonah was having to learn your compassion is for some little plant but you need to redirect your compassion needs to be for souls not the little petty things of life i know i've been corrected this morning so i ask you have you been corrected a little bit this morning lord help us if we're lacking in compassion for souls move us with compassion instead of the petty things of life do your responsibilities don't leave your job if you if you want to leave your job and go overseas say i'm just going to go serve the kingdom if god calls you to do that and you leave the job you better make sure god's called you that's all i can say but if you want to do it come and let me know because i'll send you instead of me going overseas i don't want to go i i just like being home if you want to do it but i'm not telling you to leave your jobs i'm saying take the kingdom to your job you're there at that job you think you're there for your salary you think you're there to make money and move up the ladder you're there to be a son of god and serve his kingdom and be available to be a witness your business no matter how blessed it is first and foremost has been given to you to somehow serve the kingdom of god everything we do is for the kingdom that's what jonah needed to learn it's not about your little ups and downs and your plants dying your flowers dying whatever you that's not you may hurt a little bit but don't get angry at that and not get angry at the souls that are dying that's what you need to be obsessive about lord please move me with compassion for the
