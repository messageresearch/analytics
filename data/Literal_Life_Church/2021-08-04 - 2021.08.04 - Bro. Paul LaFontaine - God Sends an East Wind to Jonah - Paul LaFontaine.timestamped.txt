[0:00] chapter 4
[0:01] we'll continue to read in the book of
[0:03] jonah and take a lesson tonight in the
[0:04] word we do appreciate all that's come
[0:06] out and all the listening online
[0:09] and we're just believing the lord has
[0:11] something for us
[0:13] and
[0:14] we appreciate god guiding us and direct
[0:16] us to the last few services the way that
[0:19] he has
[0:20] and the things we're discovering in the
[0:21] book of jonah is quite different than
[0:23] what we expected but nevertheless i
[0:26] believe it's been a blessing to us to
[0:27] see a little bit of ourselves in jonah
[0:30] and see god's commitment to his son
[0:34] amen jonah chapter 4 and we're just
[0:36] reading one verse here and then maybe
[0:38] i'll add in in ephesians 2 and that way
[0:40] we don't have to go back and read that
[0:42] again so let's read
[0:43] jonah chapter 4 and verse 8 and it came
[0:45] to pass when the sun did arise that god
[0:48] prepared a vehement east wind
[0:52] and the sun beat upon the head of jonah
[0:55] that he fainted
[0:57] and wished in himself to die and said it
[1:00] is better for me to die
[1:02] than to live if you go over in the book
[1:05] of ephesians i'd like to add this in i
[1:07] didn't plan to do this but i plan to
[1:09] refer to it later
[1:10] in the book of ephesians which is catch
[1:13] it here in chapter 4
[1:15] talking about
[1:17] the winds of doctrine
[1:19] i think it's in chapter 4
[1:24] yes
[1:25] let's read from verse 11 and he gave
[1:28] some apostles and some prophets and some
[1:30] evangelists and some pastors and
[1:32] teachers
[1:33] for the protecting of the saints for the
[1:35] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[1:38] the body of christ till we all come in
[1:40] the unity of the faith and of the
[1:42] knowledge of the son of god unto
[1:44] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[1:46] stature of the fullness of christ that
[1:50] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[1:53] to and fro
[1:54] and carried about with every wind of
[1:57] doctrine by the slight of men and the
[1:59] cunning craftedness whereby they lie and
[2:02] wait to deceive
[2:04] but speaking the truth in love
[2:06] may grow up into him in all things
[2:10] which is the head even christ how many
[2:12] know that's the final goal is for sons
[2:15] to grow into adoption and to grow up and
[2:17] spiritually
[2:19] and that's what paul speaks of in the
[2:21] inheritance chapter here is that we can
[2:23] all through the fivefold ministry
[2:25] through all the gifts god provides
[2:27] through everything he's doing to bring
[2:29] unity and through us growing up out of
[2:31] our childishness to be so swayed by the
[2:34] winds of doctrine that's where we grow
[2:36] up and come into unity and that's where
[2:37] we come into growing is when we're
[2:40] stable and we're not so blown away
[2:43] that's kind of a modern term blown away
[2:46] but we can blow be blown away by the
[2:48] winds of doctrine and he doesn't want us
[2:50] to be blown by every wind that comes
[2:52] along he wants us to be stable
[2:54] amen heavenly father bless your word
[2:56] tonight pray you'll help us and anoint
[2:58] us lord and give us strength and lord
[3:00] whatever the day has given us and each
[3:02] one lord we pray we'd be able to set
[3:04] that aside
[3:05] be able to learn from your word and sit
[3:07] at your feet tonight we thank you for
[3:09] your presence being here we pray you'll
[3:11] minister to your people in jesus name
[3:13] amen
[3:14] god bless you may be seated
[3:24] so
[3:25] we're in a stage speaking about the
[3:27] stage of jonah's life where
[3:30] god has focused his attention on jonah
[3:33] and uh as we were saying sunday that he
[3:36] god it's strange that god would do that
[3:39] because he could be focusing on nineveh
[3:41] who had just repented he could be
[3:43] focusing on the nations and maybe other
[3:46] nations that need god but he's a big god
[3:49] but i find him after jonah does this and
[3:51] becomes angry at this last incident god
[3:54] begins to focus his attention on his
[3:57] elected son his son to to be able to
[3:59] teach him some lessons to be able to
[4:01] cause him to grow up a little bit
[4:03] because he's got some real immaturities
[4:05] he's got some ways about him that are
[4:07] inconsistent there he's got some
[4:10] unfaithfulness about him and yet as we
[4:12] said sunday he doesn't give up on jonah
[4:15] because he is a son god's going to stick
[4:16] with him and stay with him and give him
[4:18] grace and no matter how long it takes to
[4:21] work on him he's going to bring jonah to
[4:23] where he needs him to be a servant of
[4:25] god and a faithful servant a consistent
[4:28] servant and bringing a faithfulness back
[4:30] to god as god is bringing him a
[4:33] faithfulness and i said it in this
[4:34] series how many knows that god is
[4:37] faithful to you
[4:38] amen that's an easy question for a
[4:40] believer because we know he's been
[4:41] faithful so the question isn't god being
[4:43] faithful to us the question is how
[4:45] faithful are we to him
[4:48] and so when a son is unfaithful like
[4:50] jonah has been and shows so many
[4:53] strange characteristics and being up and
[4:55] down all the time and kind of a roller
[4:57] coaster in his emotions and never fully
[5:00] in never fully committed it seems like
[5:03] and so one day he's committed one day is
[5:05] not one day he's jumping on a boat away
[5:07] from the presence of the lord one day
[5:09] he's back and rejoicing and one day he's
[5:11] happy one day he's sad and then now he
[5:14] comes to a place that he puts an
[5:15] emphasis as we'll speak sunday a little
[5:17] bit emphasis on
[5:19] giving pity to this gourd plant instead
[5:21] of the great work of the lord and so god
[5:24] deals with jonah just a little bit
[5:26] deeper we know that he sent the the
[5:28] gourd plant to shade him or the and give
[5:31] him shade from the sun and then he
[5:33] quickly sent the worm to eat the gourd
[5:35] up and so then the plant was gone and so
[5:38] we know god was behind all that god was
[5:41] dealing with him god was as i said
[5:43] suddenly messing with uh personal things
[5:46] in other words personal conveniences
[5:48] that he had in his life
[5:50] and god began to mess with him a little
[5:52] bit not to be mean to jonah but god
[5:54] began to just touch what was going on
[5:56] personally there because god wanted to
[5:59] teach him a lesson don't ever think that
[6:01] god can't put his hand on something in
[6:04] our lives that's dear to us or something
[6:06] that we're tied to too close god can
[6:09] touch anything
[6:12] god is a big god can you say man don't
[6:14] ever think that there's areas of your
[6:15] life that god can't touch he can touch
[6:17] any area especially the place that we
[6:20] hoard over so much and we try to hold on
[6:21] to so much don't hold on too tightly
[6:24] because god can touch that area
[6:26] and god can let you know that you're
[6:28] really not in control of things but
[6:30] god's in control
[6:32] and so now we see then that god starts
[6:34] dealing with them even a bit deeper
[6:36] because besides the worm coming and
[6:39] destroying his shade and then he gets
[6:41] angry again it says god sends a vehement
[6:44] east wind
[6:45] god sends a vehemented east wind besides
[6:49] he has no shade his gourd plant is gone
[6:53] and a worm has eaten it and he's having
[6:54] pity on the gourd dying and all these
[6:56] things god says i'm going to send a
[6:58] vehement i'm going to uh
[7:00] the bible says he prepared he pro god
[7:03] prepared
[7:05] uh a vehement east wind to come now
[7:08] you'd have to do a little study to know
[7:10] what that means because he had a natural
[7:13] vehement east wind hit him which made
[7:15] the matter worse it didn't make it any
[7:17] better you would think god had taught
[7:19] him enough lesson uh just having the
[7:21] gourd die he's in the sun with no shade
[7:24] you would think that'd be enough but god
[7:25] actually goes extra and sends the worst
[7:27] kind of wind in the heat where his bald
[7:30] head no doubt was open to the sun as it
[7:32] was and now he sends this angry east
[7:35] wind against him which made it even
[7:37] worse
[7:39] that's what god said he prepared
[7:43] he prepared a fish one day for jonah
[7:46] can you say man
[7:48] you know
[7:49] why is i don't know why the scripture is
[7:51] using god's preparing these are strange
[7:54] things that god's preparing for us
[7:56] who knows next week that god hasn't
[7:58] prepared something for you
[8:01] and we're not going to look at it as god
[8:02] preparing anything but whatever he
[8:04] prepares it's for our good
[8:07] so here he's prepared of the imminent
[8:10] east wind and so
[8:12] winds are often spoken of in the bible
[8:14] and used uh as types of things that come
[8:18] in our way types of things that test us
[8:21] and i remember my dad even did a little
[8:23] series on the winds and broke them all
[8:25] down and i don't know where those notes
[8:27] are but if i'd had access to those notes
[8:30] mom i would have just used dad's notes
[8:32] tonight instead of my own
[8:34] he had a great little
[8:36] series on the four wins because all of
[8:38] them are in the bible and all of them
[8:40] type strange winds that blow in our
[8:43] lives in different ways to test us and
[8:46] how we react and how we behave to it god
[8:49] can allow
[8:50] certain winds to come in our life that
[8:52] are diff come from different areas and
[8:55] it's all a test on how we react to it so
[8:57] winds are often in the bible uh
[8:59] allegorically typing things that that
[9:02] come in our way and we never can tell
[9:05] which way a wind is going to come from
[9:06] how many knows that jesus said about the
[9:08] holy ghost about it being the wind he
[9:10] says the wind blow it where it's listed
[9:12] and you can hear the sound but you can't
[9:14] tell where it when it's coming when it's
[9:16] going it's one thing about the wind we
[9:18] don't know when it's coming
[9:19] and that's about that's just the same as
[9:22] the winds that's in our life we don't
[9:24] know where it's coming from we don't
[9:25] know when it's coming from we don't know
[9:27] whether it's going to be a north wind or
[9:29] south wind or we don't know what trial
[9:31] is coming next can you say amen that's
[9:34] the the problem with wind it just kind
[9:36] of
[9:37] and the wind is kind of how life is and
[9:41] that is we don't know where the next
[9:42] trial is coming from
[9:45] we don't know the uniqueness of that
[9:47] trial
[9:48] and uh the the fact is is that they're
[9:50] never
[9:51] hardly ever is there ever a perfectly
[9:54] calm day there's always some little wind
[9:57] blowing some days are calm matter of
[10:00] fact monday we were on the boat there
[10:02] with brother tom and it was an
[10:03] interestingly calm time on the water
[10:06] it's rarely calm out there on the on
[10:09] lake erie and brother tom usually picks
[10:11] the times that's not calm to go out
[10:14] uh i don't know why he has that he likes
[10:17] to take people when it's not so calm and
[10:20] it's a lot more fun to him to scare
[10:22] people that way
[10:25] still you know about he's probably about
[10:27] still 18 years old in his energy and in
[10:31] his we're not saying what your age is
[10:33] brother tom but he's still 18 years old
[10:35] about choosing the daring day on the on
[10:38] the seas and in the lake
[10:41] but rarely do we have
[10:43] in the natural rarely everyone so we'll
[10:46] have a calm day but a lot of times
[10:48] there's a wind blowing either north wind
[10:50] south wind
[10:52] an east wind or westerly wind it's a
[10:54] part of our uh uh our weather system can
[10:57] you say that
[10:58] and uh
[11:00] they're they are not predictable
[11:02] like life is not predictable
[11:05] a calm day is rare
[11:06] a calm day in your spiritual life
[11:10] is rare
[11:11] how many can testify that
[11:13] we love the calm days and when we get
[11:15] one when everything was pretty smooth we
[11:17] all thank god for it but we can't in
[11:19] this life have every day a calm day
[11:22] spiritually because we are in a battle
[11:25] can you say amen and we have a god that
[11:28] may allow things to get us from where we
[11:30] are to somewhere else and he has to grow
[11:32] us by our trials and so he allows a
[11:36] certain wind to come and everything
[11:38] isn't as calm as it was supposed to be
[11:40] it's not calm that day there's there's
[11:42] an argument that takes place there's
[11:43] something oh i wish that hadn't happened
[11:45] but yet it's all coming to test how will
[11:49] we react how will we behave as sons of
[11:52] god are we learning how to react to
[11:55] whatever wind comes our way
[11:58] so in a sense we could thank god
[12:01] for the wind
[12:03] i said we can learn to thank god for the
[12:05] wind
[12:08] there are four different winds that
[12:10] bring different things the north wind is
[12:12] cold usually
[12:14] the west wind brings storms the south
[12:17] wind
[12:18] is a warm balmy wind usually
[12:22] and it makes us relaxed the east wind is
[12:24] strange because the east wind it can be
[12:27] extremely destructive that's what the
[12:29] bible speaks of it's an extremely the
[12:31] imminent strong destructive wind
[12:34] although the west wind brings storms the
[12:36] east wind can be even when you get it
[12:38] strong east wind it can be more
[12:40] destructive than any even the storms
[12:42] from the west wind when god sent an
[12:44] eastern wind it was in the bible it was
[12:47] a destructive thing that killed that
[12:49] just knocked out of the plants and
[12:51] knocked i'll read a scripture to you in
[12:53] a minute where man thinks that he's got
[12:55] his whole crop planned and everything's
[12:57] going so well but if he's if he's
[12:58] turning his back towards god god can
[13:01] send the east wind and knock that whole
[13:03] crop out
[13:06] he allows that and to for instruction
[13:08] and for teaching and to teach sons
[13:10] so you know all these different wins do
[13:13] something but i find something
[13:14] interesting about the east one is that
[13:16] can be very destructive and more
[13:18] destructive than all the rest of the
[13:20] winds all of these are spoke of in the
[13:22] bible they are types of what god sends
[13:25] our way as a test
[13:27] what's the test
[13:29] what's the test will we learn to trust
[13:31] him
[13:33] will we stand strong in the wind or will
[13:35] we be wishy-washy
[13:38] will jonah learn to stop getting angry
[13:40] at every little thing
[13:43] will we learn to stop getting angry at
[13:46] every little thing
[13:49] will we let god
[13:51] bake all the greenness out of us as we
[13:53] preached on sunday he said brother brown
[13:55] said we're still green and we got to lay
[13:57] in the presence of the sun because we
[13:59] got greenness we had immaturities in us
[14:01] and the test is are we willing to grow
[14:03] out and let god get all the greenness
[14:05] out of us to bake it out of us can you
[14:07] say amen and and i said suddenly god
[14:10] goes to messing with jonah's comfort
[14:12] just a little bit
[14:13] and
[14:15] and and just just a little bit and then
[14:17] he goes further and prepares and he's
[14:19] wind like he prepared the fish like he
[14:21] prepared other things in jonah's life he
[14:23] prepared things and god has some things
[14:26] prepared for us
[14:28] if we need a lesson in our lives because
[14:31] we're not
[14:32] in a rapture yet we're not there yet can
[14:34] you say man and one of the reasons that
[14:36] we're not is because god is bringing his
[14:39] bride to adoption
[14:43] let me say that
[14:45] i believe part of that is to bring us
[14:47] back to the true not azusa street but
[14:48] back to the book of acts church
[14:51] can you say amen
[14:53] and we weren't there so we only have the
[14:54] prophet's perspective of what it was
[14:56] actually in the book of acts church i
[14:57] believe there's a lot of interpretations
[14:59] to it and he did say that azusa street
[15:02] was only just a repeat of that azusa
[15:04] street was only a restoration of the
[15:06] gifts but it resembled the pentecost a
[15:08] little bit but it wasn't the full
[15:10] pentecost restored yet
[15:12] so we're not we're not stopping at azusa
[15:15] street we're looking for a full
[15:16] restoration back to the faith of the
[15:18] pentecostal fathers
[15:19] the only added thing that we have in
[15:21] prophecy is sons of god coming to
[15:24] adoption in the age of adoption
[15:26] because this is the age of adoption
[15:29] they couldn't fully come where we're
[15:31] going today even though they have the
[15:33] holy ghost and they had the potential to
[15:34] go to it they couldn't fully because it
[15:37] wasn't the age yet it was the birth of
[15:39] the church it was the infancy of the
[15:42] church
[15:43] but now we're not in the empathy of the
[15:45] church we're in the growth and the god
[15:48] is not marrying a baby god is marrying a
[15:51] grown woman
[15:53] that has become the word like he's the
[15:55] word she agrees with the word because
[15:57] our husband christ is the word and we're
[16:00] the wife of the word can you say a man
[16:02] we agree with every word
[16:04] and we follow every word so that's why
[16:06] she comes to a place of maturity and
[16:08] that's why i preach it and emphasize it
[16:11] more than feelings or emotions or
[16:13] setting the people under expectations
[16:16] for just another tent revival that's not
[16:19] what we're shooting for
[16:21] we're shooting for sons to come to
[16:23] maturity let me say this
[16:25] if you come to the maturity of what i'm
[16:27] preaching that we're living
[16:28] spirit-filled lives every day like we
[16:30] should
[16:31] the works will follow
[16:34] the works you don't have to work up the
[16:36] works
[16:38] you live in the spirit god's going to do
[16:40] some things in your life you don't have
[16:42] to you don't have to expect that you
[16:44] just stay led by the spirit instead of
[16:46] your emotions instead of your own mind
[16:49] walk in the spirit can you say amen
[16:51] and you won't fulfill the lust of the
[16:53] flesh and god will do exploits in your
[16:56] life
[16:57] it just happens with a spirit-filled
[16:59] christian it happens can you say amen
[17:01] and it won't be a public show it may not
[17:02] be something that the whole world sees
[17:05] the third poll is not a public show
[17:07] but it is every bit of revival in the
[17:09] bride
[17:11] amen
[17:12] so these types
[17:15] of what god sends our way is the
[17:17] question will we stand strong
[17:20] will we let god break the greenness out
[17:22] of us and i said sunday god goes to
[17:24] messing with jonah's comfort just a
[17:26] little bit prepares an east wind
[17:28] and here god has some things prepared
[17:30] for us if we need a lesson and we need
[17:33] to he needs to get us where we need to
[17:35] be here's a bit of learning
[17:37] what it says from a commentator about
[17:39] the winds of the bible just a little
[17:41] research
[17:42] bible contains several references to the
[17:44] power of the wind its variability and
[17:47] its destructive potential besides such
[17:50] uh allegorical imagery in many places
[17:53] the wind is referred to in practical
[17:54] terms only the four basic directions
[17:57] though east west north and south are
[17:59] talked about out of the four winds of
[18:01] the bible the east wind is the one which
[18:03] is a is mentioned most often and it is
[18:06] generally described as very strong
[18:09] hot and a dry wind that's the east wind
[18:12] and that's the one spoken of most in
[18:14] your bible
[18:15] the book of genesis versus chapter 41 6
[18:18] talks of the heads of the grain that
[18:20] sprouted when that got withered by the
[18:22] scorching east wind in the book of
[18:24] ezekiel chapter 17 it tells how the
[18:27] strong and the tall vine was uprooted
[18:29] and got completely withered and stripped
[18:31] of its fruit by a dry east wind the east
[18:35] wind of the bible is also a fierce wind
[18:38] it can destroy ships on the high seas
[18:40] and the scriptures for all of this it
[18:42] can scatter and sweep out people job
[18:44] chapter 15.
[18:46] jonah 4 8 it was what we read tonight
[18:48] the book of jeremiah 18. the book of
[18:50] exodus describes how god brought it in
[18:53] 10 different forms of plagues over egypt
[18:55] the seventh plague was the plague of
[18:57] hail and it was followed by the next day
[18:59] by the eighth plague which was the
[19:00] plague of locusts
[19:02] exodus 10 13. the sequence was such
[19:05] that the massive hail storms had already
[19:07] rendered the ground wet the next morning
[19:10] god used the east wind to bring in a
[19:11] swarm of locusts which found in the wet
[19:15] sandy soil an ideal environment to lay
[19:17] eggs
[19:18] and breed in huge numbers whatever had
[19:21] survived the hail was completely
[19:22] devoured by locusts the following day
[19:25] god changed the direction of the wind to
[19:27] a very strong west wind and it caught up
[19:30] the locust and carried them into the red
[19:33] sea and not a locust was left anywhere
[19:35] in egypt god in one day can change the
[19:38] wind
[19:39] even in your life
[19:42] he's in control
[19:44] he knows what he's doing
[19:46] so we have got to grow up and be mature
[19:48] and be prepared if god allows a wind in
[19:51] our life we like calm days but if he's
[19:53] allowing a win we say lord i want to get
[19:56] the lesson i want to stand strong i
[19:58] don't want to waver by the wind in my
[20:00] life i want to be accepted that nothing
[20:03] can happen in my life unless god
[20:05] ordained it to happen
[20:08] all things work together for good to
[20:10] them that love god and are called
[20:12] according to his purpose
[20:14] all things means
[20:17] all things
[20:18] it covers a big territory it covers all
[20:21] territory
[20:23] and you don't isolate something and say
[20:25] this is a different deal
[20:26] not as the son of god this is a
[20:28] different deal in my life this is
[20:29] different god can't touch this all
[20:31] things work together for good so god has
[20:34] his hand in this
[20:35] and god is governing over things
[20:38] and people share things with me
[20:39] sometimes
[20:40] and
[20:41] in private which which is fine
[20:44] but there's one thing i i rest in
[20:47] and that is and i tell them
[20:50] no matter how secret this is no matter
[20:52] how secret a battle is
[20:54] god
[20:55] knows exactly what's going on
[20:59] you can't hide anything from him
[21:01] and that in itself gives me a pastor
[21:03] gives me rest can you say amen because i
[21:05] can go to a god who already knows what's
[21:07] going on and say god he's asked you to
[21:09] intervene in that situation god knows
[21:11] what's going on he knows how to fix it
[21:14] he knows how to repair it but we don't
[21:15] tell god how to fix it can you say man
[21:18] we actually say lord whatever you need
[21:20] to do but we're asking you to repair
[21:22] this fix it heal it lord bring this
[21:24] person healing lord we're calling on you
[21:27] to do it whatever way you want to do it
[21:28] but lord do it for your glory and when
[21:31] it's all over with we'll give god glory
[21:33] for it
[21:34] amen
[21:35] hallelujah
[21:37] [Applause]
[21:39] so god can change the wind every day the
[21:41] strong and the east the dry east he goes
[21:44] on here a couple paragraphs and then
[21:45] we'll finish the strong and dry east
[21:47] wind again played a major role in the
[21:49] parting of the waters of the red sea it
[21:51] was an east wind that enabled the
[21:53] israelites to cross it god used the
[21:55] strong east when to drive the sea back
[21:57] turn it to dry land and divide the
[21:58] waters that's pretty that's a pretty
[22:00] strong wind to divide the red sea and
[22:03] they walk across on dry land
[22:06] amen so the sheer power of the east wind
[22:08] that made all this possible was
[22:11] remembered for long and you can find
[22:12] that in psalm 78 26. in the book of
[22:15] hosea
[22:16] there is you can be turning there if you
[22:18] would i want to read this one in the
[22:20] book of hosea there's a warning for any
[22:22] who feeds on the wind pursues the east
[22:24] wind all day and multiplies lies and
[22:26] violence an eastwind from the lord will
[22:28] come blowing in from the desert his
[22:31] spring will fail and as well dry up his
[22:34] storehouse will be plundered of all its
[22:36] treasures and we find this over in hosea
[22:39] chapter 13 if you could
[22:41] turn there with me or maybe they could
[22:42] put it up on the screen
[22:44] we were just in hosea just a few weeks
[22:46] ago
[22:51] talking about their unfaithfulness to
[22:53] the lord and here's it says it this way
[22:55] hosea 13 and verse 15
[22:58] though he be fruitful among his brother
[23:02] an east wind shall come
[23:04] the wind of the lord shall come up from
[23:07] the wilderness
[23:08] and his spring shall become dry and his
[23:11] fountain shall be dried up he shall
[23:14] spoil the treasure of all pleasant
[23:17] vessels samaria shall become desolate
[23:20] for she hath rebelled against her god
[23:21] remember hosea is about israel rebelling
[23:24] israel become an adulteress so god comes
[23:26] in his judgment and he's letting them
[23:28] know here is that no matter what crops
[23:30] you got no matter what plenteous things
[23:33] that you have no matter what has been
[23:35] built up as being blessings in your life
[23:37] and all these things
[23:39] has has become fruitful for you
[23:42] always remember
[23:44] god
[23:45] can send an east wind
[23:51] you better give god glory in your
[23:53] business
[23:55] because at any time if god wants to
[23:57] teach you a lesson something that seems
[23:59] so secure can get an east wind from god
[24:04] he doesn't do it to be mean you know
[24:06] some of you new ones
[24:07] trying to understand god
[24:09] god never does something to be
[24:11] intentionally mean to anybody
[24:14] god is the one who chastened sons and
[24:16] corrects sons and he allows it's not so
[24:19] much that he he does it but he allows
[24:22] things he allowed things in job's life
[24:25] and so we have to remember that that he
[24:27] can send an east wind on some of the
[24:29] blessings on some of the things that we
[24:30] feel so secure
[24:32] and that's why we try to live humble
[24:34] with a business or live humble with our
[24:36] families don't ever be arrogant and say
[24:38] i put this together i did this i got
[24:41] this job i got this degree i made this
[24:44] successful it's by the work of my own
[24:45] hands you're saying all the wrong things
[24:49] i said you're saying all the wrong
[24:50] things you better say whatever i did i
[24:53] worked hard but i give glory to god for
[24:55] all the increase that's taken place and
[24:58] by the way give ten percent increase to
[25:00] god or you'll get in trouble too
[25:04] that's one of the ways that you show
[25:06] that you're putting god first
[25:08] god deserves god deserves all hundred
[25:11] percent
[25:12] but he lets you keep 90.
[25:15] what kind of deal is this
[25:17] he lets you live on 90 and he takes the
[25:20] 10.
[25:22] so don't get into this thing that hey
[25:25] i've got this successful god can send an
[25:28] east wind at any time it can all be gone
[25:31] that's the world we live in is people
[25:33] putting trust in man
[25:35] people putting trust in their own
[25:37] efforts their own energies their own
[25:39] gifts and i believe in gifts and i
[25:41] believe god can bless a gift i believe
[25:43] the gifts can make somebody successful
[25:45] my wife is talented in some areas that
[25:47] i'm not talented in i've tried certain
[25:49] things that have just fumbled she puts
[25:51] her hand on at certain things it just
[25:52] flourishes some things i put my hand on
[25:55] it flourishes that's just the difference
[25:56] how god's gonna bless something but all
[25:58] of it no matter how good your gift is
[26:01] the glory has to go to jesus christ
[26:05] and at any moment we have to realize his
[26:07] sons our god can send an east wind
[26:11] of the imminent wind
[26:13] and all of it that we've stored up
[26:16] can go
[26:19] so god can allow storms does anybody get
[26:21] anything out of this
[26:22] tonight god can allow storms
[26:26] and winds
[26:27] in life to blow
[26:29] and
[26:30] every one of these things is the type
[26:33] of what we go through spiritually
[26:36] god can send west winds which means
[26:38] storms in our life through the winter we
[26:40] receive west winds and that can have
[26:42] that can have a lot of snow with it that
[26:44] can have tornadoes with it we're in the
[26:45] time of season of tornadoes
[26:48] um
[26:49] west winds have storms
[26:50] and we will have storms come in our
[26:53] lives
[26:55] north wind brings
[26:56] cold
[26:58] winds usually cold winds blowing
[27:00] cold times
[27:03] times where you're challenged become
[27:05] cold in your experience with the lord
[27:08] things come in your life and it begins
[27:10] to take your revival fires away it
[27:12] begins to make you cold towards the lord
[27:14] and make you that just a starchy
[27:16] you can't worship no more you can't be
[27:18] free anymore and it's because a north
[27:21] wind has blowed in your life and you
[27:23] become cold in your experience with the
[27:25] lord you've let the north winds affect
[27:27] your spiritual walk
[27:30] you may be honest and say i let a north
[27:32] wind come into my life and i've become
[27:34] cold and floral i lost the fire in my
[27:36] life at least you can acknowledge it but
[27:38] we want to get to the place that the
[27:39] cold winds they may come but it's not
[27:42] going to take my joy away it's not going
[27:44] to take my shout away it's not going to
[27:46] take my worship away
[27:48] i'm going to come during a cold wind in
[27:50] my life and i'm going to give a full day
[27:52] of worship
[27:53] can you say man i'm going to come on
[27:55] wednesday night whether i'm having a
[27:56] cold winter or not whether i have a cold
[27:59] wind maybe everybody else is starchy and
[28:01] cold towards me or whether i am myself
[28:04] and my body is feeling cold on a cold
[28:06] wednesday night i'm going to come and
[28:08] give god glory
[28:10] [Applause]
[28:11] because i'm not going to become some
[28:13] cold christian when i was a boy my dad
[28:17] traveled to a lot of different places
[28:18] mostly message churches and i'll tell
[28:21] you you got into some places that it
[28:23] felt like going in a catholic or a
[28:25] methodist church and it was supposed to
[28:26] be a message church but it was methodist
[28:30] and like i told you about my dad he was
[28:32] himself wherever he was he come in there
[28:35] and i seen people laugh the head and
[28:37] laughed in 40 years
[28:39] he got them all cracking up and then
[28:40] when he got him cracking up then he
[28:42] brought the drove the point home
[28:44] straight through and you're dead and you
[28:46] need a revival and you need to come to
[28:48] life and he just had a way that he could
[28:50] get in there can you say amen and bring
[28:53] a revival like a live evangelist can do
[28:55] they can get in and stir things up if a
[28:57] church is getting formal god will send
[28:59] the evangelists along
[29:02] and bring conviction can you say man
[29:04] with a state made wait a minute we've
[29:06] got you cold towards the lord here and
[29:08] he'll just shake you all up and hang you
[29:10] over hell a little bit
[29:13] yeah
[29:14] god uses the evangelist you don't want
[29:16] it every service
[29:18] because you never feel like you're going
[29:19] to heaven
[29:22] that's why you need a pastor
[29:24] so you need the fifo ministry
[29:28] but every once in a while we need that
[29:29] to shake us out of our coldness because
[29:31] why we have cold winds blowing you might
[29:33] be having one and now in your life the
[29:35] cold wind blowing in your life just
[29:37] don't let it affect you
[29:39] say lord i feel a cold wind blowing you
[29:42] ever had that where you say something
[29:44] and uh it maybe offends somebody and you
[29:46] just feel a little cool wind coming back
[29:48] from them
[29:50] felt a little cold wind and the response
[29:52] they're coming back from me that's right
[29:54] i've had that in congregations you know
[29:56] felt a little cool breeze come back at
[29:58] me
[30:00] and so so so you can have coldness but
[30:02] you can have people get cold towards you
[30:05] that can be your cold wind i wonder why
[30:07] he's acting that way i don't deserve to
[30:09] be treated that way hey listen don't get
[30:11] in an uproar about it
[30:13] don't become cold yourself
[30:16] it's a cold wind blowing but don't be
[30:17] affected stand strong hold your position
[30:21] a south wind blows when a south wind
[30:23] blows
[30:24] uh it's comfortable
[30:27] there's a scripture that says
[30:29] uh woe to them that are at ease in zion
[30:33] woe to them that are at ease in zion
[30:36] and when you become at ease is when
[30:38] there's a south wind blowing kind of
[30:40] like when we leave here in february and
[30:42] go to florida and the southern breezes
[30:45] are flowing as soon as i get off of the
[30:47] aircraft i just love it
[30:50] but spiritually speaking that's not
[30:53] always good to just relax you and put
[30:55] you at ease because you can lose your
[30:57] fire with that too
[31:00] everything laid back and comfortable and
[31:02] you got your sunglasses on and you're
[31:04] just easing through every day and
[31:06] everything's cool and everything's good
[31:08] and everything's all right and all of a
[31:11] sudden your business is going well and
[31:13] your job everybody's treating you right
[31:15] at the job everything's just there's
[31:18] just a real southern wind blowing and
[31:21] it's going so good you got your
[31:22] sunglasses on
[31:24] life is looking so bright i have to wear
[31:26] sunglasses
[31:31] and then you forget to read your bible
[31:32] for four or five days
[31:35] and then you lay aside where you listen
[31:37] listen listen to the word and truth and
[31:39] preachers preaching and you start
[31:41] missing a few wednesday nights you start
[31:43] taking 50 000 vacations
[31:47] even when you're at home
[31:49] and spiritually you're being affected
[31:52] by a southern wind
[31:54] maybe that one can be most deceiving
[31:57] we know when we're getting a vehement
[31:59] east wind in our lives
[32:01] things are being taken away from us
[32:04] but we may not know as much when there's
[32:05] a southern balmy
[32:07] breezy
[32:08] wind coming in and things are so easy
[32:12] things are never meant to be perfectly
[32:14] easy in our lives
[32:16] they need to be calm
[32:19] right
[32:20] but not easy
[32:21] brother brahman says that christian life
[32:23] is not easy christian life it's an
[32:25] everyday rugged life serving the lord
[32:27] but we have a calmness we have a rest in
[32:30] christ no matter what wind blows our
[32:32] choir saying to us
[32:34] that we we have a rest we can enter into
[32:38] there remaineth the rest of the people
[32:40] of god and that's what i'm preaching
[32:41] tonight there remaineth the rest of the
[32:43] people of god so be careful of this
[32:45] worldly i think a southern wind is it
[32:48] introduces people to too much
[32:50] worldliness and they relax and they
[32:53] vegetate and they they're gonna you know
[32:55] veg on the couch and they i'm gonna go
[32:57] through this whole series and it may not
[32:59] be such a good series for your spirit to
[33:02] take in and and i think worldly things
[33:04] start to creep in and people start to
[33:07] develop worldly things and what they
[33:08] wear and all that and they think it's
[33:10] okay but they're being slowly wooed into
[33:12] something that's taken away from their
[33:14] fire spiritually
[33:17] the southern wind
[33:19] is blowing across the internet and
[33:22] making you follow those fashions
[33:27] just a few months later you're not where
[33:29] you were spiritually
[33:30] because the southern wind blew and a
[33:32] whirly wind
[33:34] blew
[33:35] we lose our revival we lose our fight
[33:37] things are too easy and we relax
[33:40] but the east wind is what we've
[33:42] emphasized tonight and it's what jonah
[33:44] got and it's the most destructive and
[33:46] that's the lesson that god can wipe out
[33:49] things that you hold on too tightly
[33:52] it was an east wind that god sent joke
[33:57] spiritually speaking god sent job an
[34:00] east wind
[34:01] can you say amen
[34:03] clearly he got an east wind because the
[34:06] things that he held here held near his
[34:08] children
[34:09] you know his family
[34:11] his possessions
[34:13] everything got wiped out by an east wind
[34:16] but guess what
[34:18] god certainly didn't do that to be mean
[34:21] to job
[34:22] he was proving something to the devil
[34:26] how many knows that you've heard the
[34:27] story of joe but up he was job is quite
[34:29] different than jonah
[34:32] and that's why you got to look in
[34:33] scripture not everybody is a job not not
[34:35] not everybody is a a a a a matthew some
[34:39] are peters
[34:42] where they say something before they
[34:43] think it
[34:45] not everybody is just this uh perfect
[34:48] person that we see in the bible some
[34:50] were doubters some uh
[34:53] got them lives messed up can you say
[34:55] amen
[34:56] some were doubting thomases saw some
[34:59] were the samson who who gave his uh his
[35:02] his strength to god but he gave his
[35:04] heart to delilah and these men have
[35:07] issues and jonah had issues but guess
[35:09] what all of these men are part of the
[35:12] economy of god all of these men and
[35:14] women in the bible had different facets
[35:17] about themselves and yet because they
[35:19] were sons god kept dealing with them
[35:22] until they made it right
[35:24] don't try to put yourself in a certain
[35:27] shoes of somebody in the bible and say i
[35:28] got be no you are your own person and
[35:31] god is dealing with you in his son in
[35:33] all your weaknesses god will send you
[35:35] wins to test where you're at
[35:38] because he knows you better than you
[35:40] know yourself
[35:41] and the only reason the devil knows you
[35:42] is because he studied you since you were
[35:44] born he knows your weaknesses too
[35:47] but god knows you more than him and god
[35:49] knows what you need to be taken away or
[35:52] given or whatever it is
[35:53] and what wind to blow in your life to
[35:56] test you
[35:57] and if you blow over
[35:59] if you're blown away by the wind
[36:02] that in itself is a test for you say
[36:04] lord i'm not where i need to be
[36:09] knocked you down again
[36:11] get back up a righteous man gets up one
[36:13] more time when he falls
[36:15] get back up and come back and be
[36:17] sure-footed and say lord
[36:20] help me i just got shown clearly
[36:23] that i'm not ready yet and i'm not the
[36:25] son i should be yet but i know you're
[36:27] molding me i know you're making me i
[36:29] know i'm gonna get there

[37:20] all the way
[37:24] amen let's give glory to god
[37:29] [Applause]
[37:32] samuel samuel just stepped out in the
[37:34] aisle to see the pastor singing a
[37:36] special there he liked that
[37:38] now he's going back in now i'm gonna go
[37:39] back to preaching he's going back in
[37:42] you like that samuel you like that one
[37:45] praise the lord you love the lord
[37:47] tonight
[37:48] amen god's sons are going to make it
[37:51] and you either come hard or you remember
[37:53] the kin sister anita probably heard me
[37:55] say this 27 years ago
[37:58] you either come hard or you come easy
[38:00] but if your son you're
[38:02] coming
[38:04] because all the father has given me
[38:06] will come
[38:09] so why come hard why come hard why don't
[38:12] you just surrender right now
[38:14] say i'm yours lord
[38:16] take what you want to take out of my
[38:18] life whatever it is my dad coming to the
[38:20] altar when he was young he laid his
[38:23] billfold on the altar he laid his watch
[38:26] on the altar and said my time is yours
[38:28] my money is yours my heart is yours
[38:31] everything is here at the altar
[38:33] why not say lord take it now
[38:35] my bit my successful business whatever
[38:38] it would be lord it's yours
[38:42] i'm just the overseer of it but it's
[38:44] yours you own it why not give it up now
[38:47] why come hard why why why do you have to
[38:49] come hard why not come
[38:51] easy as a son praise the lord
[38:54] so
[38:55] let me try to wrap this up here now
[38:58] why does god let different winds blow to
[39:01] test us to let us see where we're at to
[39:03] burn out some immaturities we can learn
[39:06] to be stand to stand sure-footed and
[39:09] stable
[39:10] to learn how to stay how many want to
[39:11] learn how to stand tonight
[39:14] i don't want to fall in the wind i want
[39:15] to learn how to stand
[39:17] not giving up because a wind comes
[39:21] it's it's meant to blow us down of
[39:22] course the wind is meant to blow us down
[39:25] but for job it was meant to prove to
[39:27] satan that job would stand
[39:30] so the wind is meant by the wind it's
[39:32] meant to blow us down but god when he
[39:35] sends a wind it's to prove a son of god
[39:37] that he can stand
[39:42] says
[39:43] as he comes before the lord
[39:45] do you can you suggest anybody and god
[39:48] says
[39:49] have you considered job
[39:54] i said all right i'll go after him i'll
[39:56] go after him
[39:57] his whole purpose god's whole purpose
[40:00] whole purpose and i know there was some
[40:01] testing for job i know some of that but
[40:04] he was proven to the devil you can take
[40:06] everything away from him and you'll
[40:09] never remove his absolute
[40:13] you'll never make him deny god you never
[40:15] let him leave this message
[40:18] he ain't going to do it
[40:21] and it happened and he stood strong amen
[40:27] so in ephesians 4 the reason i read it
[40:29] is he gave some
[40:30] apostles some prophets and some
[40:32] evangelists some pastors and teachers
[40:33] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[40:35] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[40:37] the body of christ till we all come in
[40:38] the unity of the faith and of the
[40:40] knowledge of the son of god unto a
[40:42] perfect man unto the measure of the
[40:43] stature of the fullness of christ
[40:45] that we henceforth be no more children
[40:48] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[40:51] every wind of doctrine talking about
[40:53] winds tonight i wanted to talk about the
[40:56] winds of doctrine
[40:57] because he says they can be floating and
[41:00] blowing through as well but we've got to
[41:02] be grown up christians and not babies
[41:03] and not be given into such doctrines can
[41:06] you say amen and and blown over by such
[41:09] doctrines and the way he words it here
[41:11] tossed to and fro god doesn't want us to
[41:14] be tossed to and fro
[41:16] now that may be a wind of doctrine or
[41:18] that may be a wind if something didn't
[41:20] come out as a result the way that you
[41:22] wanted it in your life in your business
[41:24] whatever it is some result didn't turn
[41:26] up the way that you wanted it well
[41:28] that's fine but you've got to not be
[41:31] tossed to and fro about it well you know
[41:34] what i just i just
[41:36] god did that or that happened i'll just
[41:38] quit paying my tithes
[41:40] really
[41:41] really
[41:42] i'll just cut it off he didn't do me
[41:44] right that preacher didn't do me right
[41:46] that person that just didn't i'll just
[41:47] cut that off and they'll see and you
[41:49] start making boasts like that
[41:51] you don't have a right as a sun to do
[41:53] that
[41:54] that's being tossed by the wind that's
[41:57] coming through your life people's
[41:59] unfaithfulness is tested by what they go
[42:02] through and it's amazing to me sometimes
[42:05] how something so faithful and then they
[42:07] just let it go when they go through a
[42:09] trial
[42:10] and god wants to see children that are
[42:13] not he don't want to see children he
[42:14] wants to be grown up but he children
[42:16] have the tendency to be tossed to and
[42:18] fro you know children are appealed by
[42:21] certain things that are
[42:22] colorful and flashy or loud sometimes
[42:27] they're easily tossed about they're
[42:29] easily swayed
[42:30] they're easily blown over unless
[42:32] kids are blown over by the wind easier
[42:34] because they're less weight they're kids
[42:36] right so we have to hold on to our kids
[42:38] in the strong winds sometimes
[42:40] wonder if god has to do that to us
[42:41] sometimes
[42:43] he wants us to grow up not be children
[42:45] so we can stand in the midst of the wind
[42:47] and not be tossed somewhere but children
[42:49] can be blown or they can be attracted by
[42:51] something a strange thing and a stranger
[42:55] and they can be running because that's
[42:56] their childish way and they don't have
[42:58] the wisdom yet we as christians can't be
[43:01] tossed about by every window doctrine
[43:05] and the winds of doctrine can be easily
[43:07] toted and preached today
[43:09] easier than it's ever been across the
[43:10] internet and if you're following all
[43:12] those things be careful what you're
[43:14] following
[43:15] because it can sound so good
[43:18] to me doctrines oh i didn't finish this
[43:21] don't be tossed to and fro and carried
[43:23] about every window of doctrine
[43:25] by the slight of men and the cunning
[43:27] craftiness whereby they lie and wait to
[43:29] deceive
[43:30] but speaking the truth in love may grow
[43:33] up into him in all things which is the
[43:34] head even christ
[43:37] to me
[43:38] doctrines
[43:40] i would associate doctrines with the
[43:41] north wind you know why
[43:43] because they tend to make you
[43:48] less spirit-filled
[43:50] and more doctrinally oriented
[43:54] and whenever you push too much doctrine
[43:56] especially strange doctrine
[43:58] it quenches the spirit
[44:02] it quenches the spirit-filled services
[44:06] too much
[44:08] doctrine especially strange doctrine and
[44:11] brother branham talked about even when
[44:13] you have a church that has all the
[44:15] doctrine right but no spirit you can
[44:18] teach doctrine too much
[44:20] and quench the spirit of god
[44:23] you can preach the spirit too much and
[44:25] not have any doctrine and then you're in
[44:26] trouble too
[44:28] but northern winds to me are kind of
[44:30] like strange doctrine they quench the
[44:32] spirit they bring arguments northern
[44:35] wind brings arguments amongst the people
[44:37] about doctrine
[44:39] nor arguments make people cold in their
[44:42] walk with god
[44:44] and cold
[44:46] in their
[44:47] feelings towards others
[44:49] how many splits have taken place over
[44:50] doctrine
[44:53] how many cold churches have been cold
[44:55] formal because of a fight over doctrine
[44:59] so i think it's the north wind that
[45:00] begins to blow us that we better get
[45:02] this straightened out and so it's
[45:03] doctrine doctrine and then there's
[45:04] arguments and then we're going to settle
[45:06] this and then every second then there's
[45:07] a big split and then guess what happens
[45:09] you quench the spirit and there's no
[45:11] freedom of the spirit there to bring the
[45:13] softness and conviction in people's
[45:16] lives to say i'm sorry i shouldn't have
[45:18] treated you that way brother i'm sorry
[45:21] brother i shouldn't got cold-hearted
[45:22] towards you none of us have a right to
[45:24] get cold-hearted towards anybody
[45:28] forgive me lord take this north wind of
[45:31] this doctrine i've been holding so
[45:33] strong to but all it's produced is
[45:35] argument of attitude
[45:38] the antichrist church was reduced
[45:42] to nothing left but the brother brahms
[45:44] says that the weapon of argument
[45:47] after the spirit of gone they're left
[45:49] with nothing but the weapon of argument
[45:52] argue are you arguing i believe the
[45:54] truth should be right i think we should
[45:56] have it right but when we take an
[45:58] attitude i'm right and everybody else is
[46:00] wrong
[46:01] i wonder if we've crossed the line
[46:05] the truth has got to be right but we
[46:07] don't always have to be pushing that
[46:08] we're right
[46:13] you didn't say that
[46:14] we we had a prophet come to zero in and
[46:18] hit that truth and get it right on the
[46:19] money
[46:20] and i think it should be i don't think
[46:22] we should play around with it
[46:23] but your attitude about being right and
[46:26] being the only one right
[46:28] now you're crossing the line
[46:32] because you ain't right on everything
[46:36] you ain't
[46:37] that's why god put me in your life
[46:43] and i'm not right on everything so
[46:45] that's why god put you and the rest of
[46:46] the body of christ in my life that's why
[46:49] he gave me a wife as well
[46:51] children that's right because they
[46:54] certainly can point out
[46:56] when you're not right
[46:59] so if all of you thought i was perfect
[47:01] and right just ask my wife and children
[47:03] tonight and they'll give you a true
[47:05] picture he's not all right he's not
[47:07] always right
[47:09] and he's not like a baptist preacher
[47:10] who's
[47:11] baptist preachers they say are
[47:14] oh
[47:16] they may not always be right but they're
[47:17] never in doubt
[47:20] think about that
[47:22] may not always be right but they're
[47:23] never in doubt that they are right
[47:28] doctrines are north like the north wind
[47:30] and then when the south wind blows
[47:32] everybody feels so good outwardly smooth
[47:35] and warm at ease and zion woe to them
[47:37] that are ease in zion makes us relax
[47:39] spiritually too comfortable whatever god
[47:41] allows to blow in our lives to come and
[47:43] blow us
[47:44] his desire is that we are not tossed
[47:47] about and not swayed
[47:49] where we become a people that we're
[47:51] ready to give up
[47:52] everything on any kind of wind that
[47:54] comes in our life
[47:56] we've seen that prove where people were
[47:57] very throwing the towel on the entire
[47:59] message
[48:01] and wonder if some of it because a
[48:03] strong wind blew and tested where they
[48:04] were at they didn't have the new birth
[48:08] they didn't have the new birth
[48:10] they loved the lord no doubt but they
[48:11] didn't have that full experience of the
[48:13] new birth yet that full
[48:16] because that's sealed to the day of
[48:17] redemption and that's never going to
[48:19] what's the evidence of the holy ghost
[48:21] you're never going to deny the word
[48:23] that's the evidence of holiness you're
[48:25] never going to deny any of the word of
[48:26] god people have
[48:28] wins though and they're ready to throw
[48:30] up everything just give up everything
[48:33] and i'm ready to stop this and that's
[48:35] why we have that up and down being
[48:37] tossed about and when that wind came to
[48:39] jonah his head was just frying in the
[48:41] sun
[48:42] when this the imminent wind eastwind
[48:44] came to jonah
[48:47] i kind of felt bad for jonah when i seen
[48:49] that scripture i kind of felt bad then
[48:51] about
[48:52] his head was frying in the sun god
[48:54] removed all the shade
[48:56] and you know when the wind blows the sun
[48:58] burns harder
[48:59] and you know what he did he went right
[49:01] back to his anger and he wanted to die
[49:04] so the work wasn't done yet in job
[49:07] even after a vehement
[49:09] east wind why
[49:11] jonah made a bad choice he wasn't
[49:13] getting it
[49:16] he could say god was in the storm in his
[49:18] life he could say god was in the fish he
[49:21] could say god was in the boat
[49:23] but he wasn't going to admit now that
[49:25] god was in the gourd
[49:27] god was in the worm
[49:28] or that god was in an eastern behemoth
[49:32] he wasn't ready to admit that
[49:34] you may be able to testify and say i've
[49:36] seen god in my life over here i said god
[49:38] way back there 20 years i've seen god in
[49:40] my life but what is god doing in your
[49:42] life right now
[49:44] and can you acknowledge that it's god in
[49:46] your life
[49:48] oh say amen or ouch or something
[49:53] god is everywhere loving you out of your
[49:55] unfaithful half-life your part-time
[49:58] servant life he's going to love you out
[49:59] of it and make you a trusting person in
[50:02] the lord i'm going to wrap this up and
[50:05] through any wind that comes
[50:08] we need an absolute and i'd just like to
[50:09] read this real quick a couple places
[50:11] that brother brown read and then i'm
[50:12] going to read you a quote and we'll
[50:13] we're going to finish tonight but
[50:15] philippians chapter 1 and romans 8 both
[50:18] of these scriptures
[50:19] is where brother branham read the text
[50:23] the
[50:24] absolute so i'm just going to read you
[50:26] the text because that's what understand
[50:28] why he would take this philippians
[50:30] chapter 1
[50:32] and verse 22.
[50:37] you guys okay but if i live in the flesh
[50:40] this is the fruit of my labor yet what i
[50:43] shall choose i what not next one for i
[50:46] am in a straight between two having a
[50:48] desire to depart and to be with christ
[50:50] which is far better
[50:52] nevertheless to abide in the flesh is
[50:53] more needful for you
[50:55] and having this confidence i know that i
[50:58] shall abide and continue with you all of
[51:00] your furtherance and joy of faith
[51:03] that your rejoicing may be more abundant
[51:05] in jesus christ for me by my coming to
[51:08] you again
[51:11] only let your conversation be as it
[51:12] becometh the gospel of christ that
[51:14] whether i come and see you or whether i
[51:16] be absent i may hear of your affairs
[51:17] that ye stand fast in one spirit with
[51:20] one mind striving together for the faith
[51:23] of the gospel next one
[51:24] and in nothing be terrified for your
[51:26] adversaries which is to them an evident
[51:28] token of perdition but to you of
[51:30] salvation and that of god
[51:36] for unto you is given okay let me let me
[51:38] find this here because the one scripture
[51:40] i only wanted
[51:42] one out of there
[51:44] and first timothy philippi
[51:46] philippines philippians
[51:54] that's not you guys fault up there in
[51:55] the video it's mine
[52:00] philippians 1.
[52:05] yeah the 21 20 and 21 is what i wanted
[52:08] according to my earnest expectation and
[52:10] my hope that in nothing i should be
[52:11] ashamed but that with all boldness as
[52:14] always so now also christ shall be
[52:16] magnified in my body whether i it be by
[52:19] life or by death for to me to live is
[52:24] christ
[52:25] and to die is gay
[52:28] now this is the text for the absolute
[52:31] there's such an absolute in paul's life
[52:34] that
[52:36] he looks at death you know we got a lot
[52:37] of fear of death today
[52:39] coven brought a lot of fear
[52:42] and it's still promoted to really make
[52:44] people fearful i don't think we should
[52:46] be fearful of anything as christians
[52:48] because when i think we should protect
[52:50] ourselves as we can but our life is in
[52:52] the hands of god
[52:54] i'm not leaving here until god says it's
[52:56] time for me to go and i thought we all
[52:58] believed that right covet doesn't change
[53:01] that
[53:02] and and so so but look at a man saying
[53:05] for me to live as christ but to die is
[53:07] to gain so he's got such an absolute in
[53:10] his life that nothing is going to move
[53:12] him no matter what comes his way no
[53:14] matter what when
[53:15] i win either way
[53:18] praise the lord so now here's his next
[53:20] text romans chapter 8 and this one will
[53:22] be real familiar to you romans chapter 8
[53:25] and then we'll read what he says in it
[53:26] real quick
[53:27] romans chapter 8 and verse 35
[53:30] he says and this is what he's reading in
[53:32] the absolute
[53:33] who
[53:34] shall separate us from the love of
[53:36] christ
[53:37] shall tribulation
[53:39] or distress or persecution or famine or
[53:42] nakedness or burial or sword or four
[53:45] winds
[53:47] or a vehemented easterly wind
[53:50] who shall be able to separate us from
[53:52] the love of god look at this absolute he
[53:54] has look at this stance that he has as
[53:56] it is written for thy sake we are killed
[53:58] all the day long we are counted as sheep
[54:00] for the slaughter nay in all these
[54:02] things we are more than conquerors
[54:04] through him that loved us for i am
[54:06] persuaded that neither death nor life
[54:08] nor angels no principalities nor powers
[54:10] nor things present nor things to come
[54:13] nor a north wind or south wind or west
[54:16] wind nor height nor death nor any other
[54:18] creature shall be able to separate us
[54:20] from the love of god which is in christ
[54:23] jesus our lord that man has an absolute
[54:28] that man's tied to an absolute right
[54:32] and he says in this quote then
[54:34] now he goes right at the beginning of
[54:35] the message and i just want you to pay
[54:37] attention real close and i'm closing
[54:38] here about five minutes
[54:40] every great achievement is tied to an
[54:42] absolute
[54:44] you cannot run life without having
[54:46] absolute you can't make an achievement
[54:48] without it being an absolute for it is
[54:50] the final tie post it's the hitch rack
[54:52] at the end of the journey it's a place
[54:54] where you're tied to something in the
[54:56] day that we're living in now and
[54:58] everything is so breaking up so fragile
[55:00] and carried away i think that this
[55:02] message would be a very appropriate
[55:04] thing
[55:05] what's he preaching on the absolute this
[55:07] message the absolute and he says i think
[55:10] the time we're living where everything
[55:11] is breaking up so fragile and carried
[55:13] away i think that this message would be
[55:15] very appropriate especially to
[55:16] christians when they are going through
[55:19] their deep waters now the christian
[55:21] church is passing through the deepest
[55:23] water it's had for the last 2000 years
[55:26] wow
[55:28] because we are
[55:30] because we are coming to a spot to where
[55:33] there's something presented to
[55:34] christianity something that they have to
[55:36] make a decision on and i think that the
[55:38] christian church ought to have something
[55:40] that they know that they are tied to
[55:43] instead of just floating about like a
[55:45] leaf upon the water the wind and as the
[55:48] bible said carried about by every wind
[55:50] of doctrine the winds come and blow the
[55:54] little leaf this way and then another
[55:55] wind comes the north wind the south wind
[55:58] the east wind the west wind you'll never
[56:01] get anywhere you're not stable the
[56:04] christian life should be a stable life
[56:08] it should be something that's a
[56:09] principle that that you are tied to that
[56:12] is more than life itself how many
[56:14] tonight want to make christ more than
[56:16] life itself
[56:17] more than this life
[56:19] if you get a sickness god can heal you
[56:21] but if you get a sickness that takes you
[56:23] i've got something in our heart that's
[56:24] more than this life
[56:27] that's what christ has to mean to is
[56:29] more than this life more than my
[56:30] possessions of life
[56:32] amen it has to be more than life itself
[56:35] and then and you might listen now you
[56:36] must have something that you're tied to
[56:39] some people are tied to their business
[56:44] some are tied to their families i never
[56:47] knew brother branham says this
[56:49] but it's so
[56:51] good to put the searchlight on us and
[56:54] say what are you tied to
[56:57] got to read this one sunday
[56:59] when there's more people here
[57:02] we all need it
[57:03] i'm going to read this one again
[57:05] because some people
[57:07] are tied when push comes to shove
[57:10] they're not tied to this word they're
[57:12] tied to their family
[57:14] their absolute is their family
[57:17] and listen i love family i they're
[57:19] they're the closest thing to me outside
[57:21] of jesus christ i love my i love my
[57:23] grandchild back they're saying amen to
[57:25] me tonight she's a wonderful grandchild
[57:28] can anita i know you guys got you know
[57:30] what five or ten now right three
[57:34] nothing like grandchildren they're the
[57:36] they're the reward for not killing your
[57:38] own kids
[57:43] nothing like family that's such a close
[57:44] tie
[57:46] but if i had to make a choice now i'm
[57:48] not tied to my family
[57:51] i'm tied to christ
[57:53] jesus even talked about some families
[57:55] where you have to make a choice unless
[57:57] you hate father and mother doesn't mean
[57:58] go you hate your father but there'll be
[58:00] choices sometimes come if they're
[58:02] swaying you away from this word
[58:04] you've got to make a choice
[58:06] some people are tied to their family
[58:08] some people are tied to their business
[58:10] some are tied to a creed some are tied
[58:12] to the army post
[58:13] we have different things that we are
[58:15] tied to but i think as a christian we
[58:17] ought to be tied where we know is right
[58:19] you see
[58:20] because you might be tied to your family
[58:23] and your wife could leave you
[58:30] my
[58:32] you might be tied to the army and you
[58:33] might get killed you might tie to
[58:35] different things and it's got an end but
[58:37] there has got to be a final tie post
[58:40] there has got to be somewhere that man
[58:42] has got to tie for his eternal
[58:44] destination
[58:46] amen
[58:47] because if you're going to trust it in
[58:49] your work when your work is finished
[58:51] it's done when your family's taken it's
[58:54] over but there's only one thing that i
[58:56] think is the final time post and i
[58:57] believe that paul had a typos in his
[58:59] life here and i'd like to to sign in if
[59:02] we'd call it that way and speak on that
[59:03] type host
[59:04] he said for me to live is christ and to
[59:08] die is gain
[59:11] now christ was paul's absolute it was
[59:13] his typos it was his it was the end of
[59:16] all arguments it was christ was his
[59:19] typos
[59:22] wonderful it's the end of all arguments
[59:25] what's first in my life we don't argue
[59:27] about that christ is first
[59:30] the word is first listening to the word
[59:33] of god is first
[59:35] and my boys and my girls my family they
[59:37] know that there isn't anything there
[59:39] isn't let me go ahead and say it there
[59:41] isn't any volleyball tournament there
[59:43] isn't any event that's going to be the
[59:46] main attraction in life over hearing the
[59:48] word of god not going to happen
[59:51] when my boys played baseball we let them
[59:53] play a lot of sports some people don't
[59:54] believe in sports we let them play uh my
[59:56] wife likes sports i like sports and so
[59:58] when they come and talk about those
[1:00:00] wednesday night practices and all that
[1:00:02] say you know what solomon gideon you're
[1:00:04] out you know you can't do it and
[1:00:06] sometimes the coach would change
[1:00:08] to another night so we could go to
[1:00:09] church but i taught them you're going to
[1:00:11] be in the house of god we're going to be
[1:00:13] here in the house of god
[1:00:16] right because there's a tie post in our
[1:00:18] lives
[1:00:19] and it's not football
[1:00:22] when football's gone someday
[1:00:26] when baseball's gone someday
[1:00:30] i want a deeper typos than that and i
[1:00:32] want my children to have a deeper type
[1:00:35] host
[1:00:36] because that's going to be gone someday
[1:00:39] praise the lord
[1:00:41] one more quote here in uh the
[1:00:43] restoration of the bride tree
[1:00:45] and this is from psalms 1 where he says
[1:00:47] that man that's blessed will be like a
[1:00:49] tree planted by the living waters he
[1:00:52] says it in psalms 1. i don't know how
[1:00:53] long i'm taking here tonight
[1:00:59] best of the man that walketh not in the
[1:01:00] counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in
[1:01:02] the way of sinners nor sitteth in the
[1:01:04] seat of the scornful but his delight is
[1:01:06] in the law of the lord in his law doth
[1:01:07] he meditate day and night he shall be
[1:01:09] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:01:11] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[1:01:13] his season his leaf also shall not
[1:01:15] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:01:17] prosper so there's the man that's
[1:01:19] planted the tree that's planted right
[1:01:21] and then brother branham says here he
[1:01:23] shall be like a tree that's planted by
[1:01:25] the rivers of water as david saw it and
[1:01:28] he spoke he said blessed is that man and
[1:01:31] notice he said he could not die his
[1:01:33] leaves would not wither no no no matter
[1:01:35] what they do they'll never kill that
[1:01:37] tree why it's where he's planted that's
[1:01:39] what does it
[1:01:40] it's where he's planted he planted by
[1:01:43] the rivers of water notice david said
[1:01:45] his roots won't die you know you take a
[1:01:47] tree a big old tree
[1:01:49] i when i was a boy i used to go out and
[1:01:51] weed us boys we'd go out and had a big
[1:01:53] old tree we used to sit under
[1:01:55] big o big old beech tree and the winds
[1:01:58] would blow and i wonder looked like that
[1:02:00] thing so much in the top looked like it
[1:02:02] would blow the thing over
[1:02:04] but you know every time the wind blows
[1:02:06] on a tree
[1:02:07] it rocks the tree
[1:02:09] and it loosens up the roots
[1:02:11] so that they can just
[1:02:13] dig deeper and get a better hole
[1:02:17] i remember that quote this afternoon i
[1:02:19] want to bring it up to you that's how i
[1:02:21] want to be
[1:02:22] is the winds have a good effect on me
[1:02:24] because they loosen up the dirt and
[1:02:27] drive my roots deeper
[1:02:29] that i can stand my ground
[1:02:31] amidst the wind can you say amen
[1:02:34] and he says he says the the it goes
[1:02:36] deeper and gets a better hold and that's
[1:02:38] the way mockery laughing making fun of a
[1:02:40] christian what it does is persecution
[1:02:43] shakes the christian to make him pray
[1:02:47] to dig down to get a better hold
[1:02:51] so he can stand the storm
[1:02:54] i hope when i get on the other side that
[1:02:56] i can talk to jonah and i just got a i
[1:02:59] got a a pretty strong belief that he
[1:03:03] ended his life this way that he finally
[1:03:05] got the lesson from the lord and he let
[1:03:08] the winds drive his roots deeper
[1:03:12] that he becomes settled can you say
[1:03:14] that the winds
[1:03:17] don't make me sway
[1:03:19] they make me pray more
[1:03:23] i had a lot of people testify when this
[1:03:25] whole thing come up five years ago six
[1:03:26] years or whatever it was i believe the
[1:03:28] sign and all that just
[1:03:30] i had a lot of people testify
[1:03:33] that
[1:03:34] it made their roots go deeper
[1:03:37] i'll make it raise your hand
[1:03:39] because it challenged some people maybe
[1:03:41] they didn't know completely where they
[1:03:42] stood where they needed to stand
[1:03:45] and all of a sudden the winds came
[1:03:47] through their doctrine like that and it
[1:03:49] made them search the word it made them
[1:03:51] pray wait a minute here i need to know
[1:03:53] where i stand
[1:03:56] amen i need to know and it made their
[1:03:58] roots go deeper to where they're they're
[1:04:00] not having an identity crisis they know
[1:04:02] exactly who they are
[1:04:04] even more than they did before
[1:04:06] see these things are good that comes
[1:04:08] along and there'll be more coming like
[1:04:09] that the judas movements and all these
[1:04:11] things you're going to see judas you're
[1:04:13] going to see that it happened in jesus
[1:04:15] life but how do we react to it should
[1:04:17] make us pray more should make us love
[1:04:20] more should make us dig our our roots
[1:04:22] deeper can you say that make us stronger
[1:04:25] shouldn't it shouldn't make us miss
[1:04:27] church more it should make us come to
[1:04:28] church more it should make us miss our
[1:04:30] bible reading maybe reading our bible
[1:04:32] more
[1:04:34] dig deeper can you say about it and
[1:04:35] that's when satan really gets mad
[1:04:37] brother jason is that
[1:04:39] satan sends a win god allows a wind and
[1:04:41] we become stronger by it and satan says
[1:04:43] i hate that they become stronger through
[1:04:45] that wind
[1:04:47] whether it was north wind or southwest
[1:04:48] whatever it is they're stronger as a
[1:04:50] result of it that's where i want to be
[1:04:54] i want to serve him that way
[1:04:56] and i'm not fully there yet but i want
[1:04:59] to be there that whatever wind is
[1:05:01] blowing maybe i'd pick up on it and say
[1:05:03] i don't know where this came from
[1:05:07] but i'm seeing it coming
[1:05:10] it's starting to blow real hard
[1:05:13] but i recognize it
[1:05:16] let me hold my ground
[1:05:19] let me say
[1:05:20] stand for righteousness stand
[1:05:25] for holiness and believe that
[1:05:29] i need to learn the words to the song
[1:05:33] stand when all your friends are gone

[1:09:31] find a resting place
[1:09:34] lord may we stand

[1:09:44] distraction for our relationship with

[1:10:20] so lord let our tie posts tonight our
