[0:00] in the scripture this morning take this
[0:02] section of scripture and read it
[0:04] about our lord's resurrection and just
[0:07] before that
[0:08] and we trust the anointing will come
[0:11] this morning and
[0:13] bring us something that will be
[0:14] beneficial for everyone here and
[0:16] everyone listening and streaming
[0:18] we give glory to god for the things that
[0:20] he is doing
[0:22] and the things that he has done and
[0:24] that's why we come and worship because
[0:25] we have so much
[0:27] to be thankful for so many things that
[0:29] he has done for us
[0:31] and we appreciate his grace in our lives
[0:35] amen
[0:38] john chapter 19 and verse 20
[0:41] 28 after this jesus knowing that all
[0:45] things were now accomplished
[0:47] that the scripture might be fulfilled
[0:48] saith i thirst
[0:50] now there was a set vessel full of
[0:52] vinegar and they filled a sponge with
[0:54] vinegar
[0:55] and put it upon hyssop and put it to his
[0:57] mouth when jesus therefore had received
[0:59] the vinegar he said
[1:01] it is finished and he bowed his head
[1:06] and gave up the ghost the jews therefore
[1:09] because it was the preparation that the
[1:12] body should not remain upon the cross on
[1:14] the sabbath day for the sabbath day
[1:16] was a high day besought pilate that
[1:19] their legs might be broken
[1:21] and that they might be taken away then
[1:24] came the soldiers and break the legs of
[1:26] the first
[1:27] remember there were three crosses they
[1:29] break the legs the first
[1:31] and of the other which was crucified
[1:33] with him
[1:34] but when they came to jesus and saw that
[1:37] he was dead already
[1:38] they break not his legs but when
[1:41] one of the soldiers with the spear
[1:44] pierced his side and forthwith came
[1:46] there out blood and water if you know
[1:48] the word and the study of the word
[1:50] that's where the bride came out that's
[1:53] where your part was
[1:54] we were in christ and he that saw it
[1:56] bear record and his record is true
[1:59] and he knoweth that the that he saith
[2:01] true that he might believe
[2:03] for these things were done that the
[2:05] scripture
[2:06] should be fulfilled a bone of him
[2:10] shall not be broken and again another
[2:12] scripture saith
[2:14] they that look on him whom they pierced
[2:17] chapter 20 chapter 20 if you skip with
[2:21] me chapter 20
[2:22] over then when simon peter and the
[2:24] others begin to find
[2:26] the open tomb the empty tomb verse six
[2:29] will pick it up then
[2:30] come simon peter following him and went
[2:33] into the sepulchre and see if the linen
[2:34] clothes lie and the napkin
[2:37] that was about his head no
[2:41] not lying with the linen cloth but
[2:42] wrapped together in a place by itself
[2:44] then went in
[2:45] also that other disciple which came
[2:47] first to the sepulcher
[2:48] and he saw and believe for as yet
[2:52] they knew not the scripture that he
[2:55] must rise again from
[2:58] the dead amen
[3:02] heavenly father thank you lord for this
[3:05] time to worship you and to share our
[3:07] hearts and lord
[3:09] when you came from the tomb 2000 years
[3:12] ago
[3:13] lord jesus we've celebrated as
[3:15] christians from that day forward
[3:17] it says in the bible they gathered upon
[3:19] the first day of the week
[3:20] we know the jews gathered on friday and
[3:22] then saturday for the sabbath but lord
[3:25] when we come to the great gospel the
[3:27] truth lord when you rose again the third
[3:29] day on the first day of the week then
[3:31] christians begin to celebrate that not
[3:34] only on easter but on every sunday lord
[3:36] we give that time to worship you for
[3:39] lord we don't have any victory this
[3:40] morning
[3:41] unless you come up the third day and
[3:43] rose again and lord the old hymn
[3:45] says you ask me how i know he lives
[3:48] it's because he lives within my heart
[3:51] the resurrection is more than just
[3:52] a story 2000 years ago to us but lord
[3:56] it's a living thing we know that you're
[3:58] alive and well
[3:59] because you're living and moving in our
[4:01] lives each day
[4:02] and you're causing us to rise as well
[4:05] thank you for your resurrection power
[4:07] this morning
[4:07] and we pray that you'll speak through
[4:09] these few words that i have
[4:11] and you minister to every life whatever
[4:13] place that they're at in their life
[4:15] wherever whatever past lord you're not
[4:18] afraid of the past no matter what it is
[4:20] because lord when you look at us you
[4:22] have our destiny
[4:24] in mind you have our future in mind and
[4:26] so lord when you speak to us today
[4:29] may all of us listen as if you had our
[4:32] future in mind
[4:33] and that the past be washed away lord
[4:35] jesus we commit this service to you i
[4:37] commit myself as a minister
[4:39] that you would anoint our words and we
[4:41] commit the service completely to you in
[4:43] the day
[4:44] of fellowship with our families and
[4:45] different ones wherever we should go
[4:48] we pray you'll bless that as well and
[4:50] bless the bride and the
[4:52] churches the christian churches around
[4:53] the world and christians who worship
[4:56] lord
[4:56] from a pure heart wherever they worship
[4:58] at i pray
[4:59] you'll receive their worship today and i
[5:02] pray there'll be a great
[5:03] great revival in the hearts of your
[5:05] people
[5:06] lord we commit the service to you laying
[5:09] everything else aside
[5:10] accept this attention to you and your
[5:12] word in jesus name
[5:14] we ask it amen god bless you may be
[5:22] seated
[5:24] i'd like to speak this morning on uh
[5:28] the subject of it was finished but he
[5:31] rose again
[5:32] it was finished but he rose again
[5:36] and um we're not finished with the
[5:40] uh message that we brought last sunday
[5:42] in fact we have some testimonies to
[5:43] share from that service
[5:45] and we'll get to that maybe another time
[5:47] but the lord just directed us and
[5:49] was nice blessed enough that god blessed
[5:51] me with the
[5:52] easter message this morning and i want
[5:54] to share that with you
[5:55] i trust not to be too long i know you
[5:57] have your family's
[5:58] fellowships and different things and
[6:00] meals and the ham is on
[6:02] and so we want to be mindful for all
[6:04] those things cooking
[6:06] but this is probably the most important
[6:08] time we spend not be
[6:10] not because i'm speaking but because the
[6:12] word of god
[6:13] everything else will pass away but the
[6:15] word will last forever
[6:17] amen and so now it was finished but he
[6:20] rose again and i could work that
[6:22] just maybe a little bit different so
[6:24] that you could understand it a bit more
[6:26] uh when jesus proclaimed it
[6:29] is finished uh there was there was some
[6:33] powerful
[6:34] words that he said and what he meant by
[6:36] that
[6:37] is that not that he was finished and i
[6:39] want to preach that to you
[6:41] it was finished but he was not finished
[6:44] can you say man something was finished
[6:47] he did a work
[6:48] but it was finished but he certainly
[6:50] wasn't finished
[6:51] and we're going to find that true today
[6:53] but those are powerful words because
[6:55] the sin question and the fall in the
[6:57] garden and all the things that
[6:59] most of you know about that took place
[7:01] and why jesus had to go to calvary
[7:04] that that the sin question had to be
[7:06] settled something had to be done
[7:08] uh that was trouble when we fell in the
[7:10] garden it
[7:11] brought trouble for all of us and you
[7:14] can't have worse trouble than sin
[7:17] sin was ingrained in us can you say amen
[7:19] every man born from that time in
[7:21] had sin in them can you say amen and god
[7:25] had to deal with that his own way and so
[7:27] when he said
[7:27] it is finished it meant that sin was
[7:30] finished god took care of the penalty
[7:33] for sin
[7:34] god paid the price for sin that you
[7:37] didn't have to pay the price of death
[7:39] he paid the price for sin it meant that
[7:42] it was finished that redemption
[7:44] price was completely paid and paid in
[7:46] full and that's why he could say
[7:48] that question of sin that has been
[7:50] completely finished
[7:51] and your victory in jesus christ has
[7:54] been purchased
[7:55] that you no longer have to work to pay
[7:57] back for your sins
[7:58] but he took care of that can i get an
[8:01] amen this morning
[8:02] that's why he could say it is finished
[8:04] is that sin question
[8:06] has been settled it is finished and you
[8:08] don't have to work to be saved
[8:12] he purchased your salvation and he says
[8:15] your salvation
[8:16] is finished if you'll believe in me
[8:20] hallelujah redemption price is paid and
[8:23] there's
[8:23] nothing you could add to it and that's
[8:25] why he could call it finished
[8:27] so what was finished was the problem of
[8:29] the great fall from the word of god
[8:32] bringing man to his lowest point of
[8:34] death and trouble
[8:36] and and that day he began to die but
[8:38] when he said it
[8:39] is finished but notice it was finished
[8:41] that work was finished
[8:43] and i could say a lot more about that
[8:45] that powerful phrase it is finished
[8:47] because the prophet even talked so much
[8:49] about it but what a powerful statement
[8:51] he made here
[8:52] as they gave him vinegar to drink and he
[8:54] gave up the ghost
[8:55] and he uttered those words it is
[8:57] finished what a powerful word but
[8:59] it was finished it was finished but he
[9:02] was not finished
[9:06] can you say amen you know and when jesus
[9:10] uttered those words if you didn't have a
[9:12] revelation standing there
[9:14] when he uttered the words it is finished
[9:16] we human beings
[9:18] we have a certain way about us that if
[9:21] something's finished it's finished it's
[9:23] over so the roman soldiers that were
[9:25] there
[9:25] the people that were watching everybody
[9:27] was listening to what he said remember
[9:29] he said several things
[9:30] but this is the final thing that he said
[9:32] when he gave up the ghost
[9:33] and so any of us would hear the words
[9:35] it's finished then his ministry's done
[9:37] he's done the romans were glad to see it
[9:40] finished
[9:40] because they had that he had to deal
[9:42] with this the jews were glad to see it
[9:44] finished
[9:45] to see him done because to us human
[9:47] beings when someone dies
[9:48] it's finished right when someone dies
[9:50] it's finished you can't get any more
[9:52] permanent
[9:52] than dying
[9:56] and so when they heard those words
[9:59] they probably soon assumed that he was
[10:01] finished
[10:02] but i'm here to tell you he was not
[10:04] finished he was just beginning something
[10:06] with his people
[10:08] what was finished is sin what was
[10:10] finished is your sin was laid on the
[10:12] cross
[10:12] he paid the price that part that problem
[10:16] was finished
[10:16] but he was going to rise again and
[10:19] what i want to get to this morning is
[10:21] that god has the power
[10:23] to finish problems in your life but if
[10:25] you've got resurrection power
[10:27] you're not finished the trouble is
[10:29] finished and you're going to rise again
[10:31] out of it
[10:34] i trust the lord can help me to bring it
[10:35] this morning but you see now when he
[10:37] gave up they thought he gave up the
[10:39] ghost
[10:39] they could see he was dead he took his
[10:41] last breath and then he himself said it
[10:44] is finished so the problem is over
[10:45] everything's done
[10:46] and not only is the problems over with
[10:48] this man he's done himself
[10:50] we'll get him in the grave well this
[10:52] this will be over this has been a
[10:54] struggle for three and a half years
[10:55] it's been attention to the jews it's
[10:57] been attention to the romans
[10:59] pilate didn't know what to do with him
[11:00] he was caught in between the jews
[11:02] and jesus and and this was just a fiasco
[11:05] it was a mess
[11:06] it was a political mess and so they're
[11:08] glad to see
[11:09] he's finished but the thing was friends
[11:12] he wasn't finished
[11:15] reminds me of a statement that was made
[11:18] uh it ain't over till it's over
[11:21] in jesus christ in the kingdom of god
[11:24] friends
[11:24] it ain't over till it's till god says
[11:27] it's over
[11:29] i hate to say this but then they got
[11:31] that term and then some newscaster in
[11:33] texas used that and he says it's not
[11:35] over to the fat lady sings
[11:38] there was some game that got really
[11:39] close and the next morning he wrote in
[11:40] the thing he says
[11:42] it's not over until the fat lady sings
[11:46] and that became a phrase i wonder what
[11:49] it means where did it come from it came
[11:50] from
[11:51] it's not over till it's over don't think
[11:53] that the game is over
[11:54] and and so it ain't and it said in the
[11:57] said in case you're wondering it ain't
[11:58] over to the fat lady sings
[12:00] uh is a phrase that means a person
[12:04] should not assume the outcome of a
[12:08] situation
[12:10] i'm still preaching to you it ain't over
[12:12] to the fat lady sings
[12:14] is a phrase that means a person should
[12:16] not assume the outcome
[12:18] of a situation until it reaches its
[12:21] end because the circumstances can change
[12:27] that's our gospel that's our large and
[12:30] you're saying man
[12:32] and i won't go on using the term lest i
[12:34] should offend
[12:36] people i mean you have to watch what you
[12:37] say today i would say that that's going
[12:39] to be
[12:40] part of the woke cancel culture is to
[12:42] cancel that statement
[12:43] because you offend some fat ladies but
[12:46] like maybe i might change it to the fat
[12:48] preacher this morning but
[12:49] i'm getting a point across to you that
[12:52] phrase me the person should not assume
[12:54] the outcome of a situation until i can
[12:57] say to you until god says
[12:59] it's over you can say it's over but it's
[13:02] not over
[13:02] until god says it's over and man
[13:06] in his pride say well that's done that's
[13:08] finished that's over
[13:09] you can even leave the message and leave
[13:11] christ and walk away from him and you
[13:13] say it's over for my life
[13:15] but i'll tell you if you're a son and
[13:17] daughter of god it's not over
[13:19] until it's over
[13:20] [Applause]
[13:22] his grip on your life and his pulse of
[13:24] your life is not over
[13:25] especially if you're seed of god you can
[13:28] go to the ends of the earth
[13:30] but you're not done unless god says
[13:32] you're done
[13:34] oh praise the lord i'm going to get
[13:36] excited this morning
[13:38] can you say man so it is finished but
[13:41] he is not finished the problem is
[13:44] finished
[13:45] but he was just getting started we think
[13:48] of death as being finished it's done
[13:50] but not in god even death is not done in
[13:52] god we prove that with the
[13:54] resurrection if quickening power is
[13:56] laying there
[13:57] it starts to rise no matter how dead
[14:00] anything is no matter how deep it is
[14:02] no matter how far in the grave it is no
[14:04] matter how how much mud it's under it's
[14:07] like the lily
[14:08] no matter how much mud is on top of that
[14:10] if there's life in that living
[14:11] lily it's going to come up anyway that's
[14:14] god's resurrection power
[14:16] you can't say it's over because if so
[14:18] there's something in there to rise
[14:20] then god's gonna cause it to rise
[14:22] hallelujah
[14:23] and so this applies to us too we how
[14:26] many know the bible says we are risen in
[14:28] christ
[14:29] we rise when we have the life of christ
[14:31] in us when we have
[14:32] a quickening power within us we raise as
[14:35] jesus wrote
[14:36] the bible actually says we were dead we
[14:38] were dead
[14:39] i'll read it to you in ephesians 2 if
[14:41] they have the scripture back there
[14:42] ephesians 2 1 says and you hath he
[14:45] quickened
[14:46] made alive you had the quickened
[14:48] ephesians 2 1
[14:50] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[14:53] so spiritually you were dead
[14:56] and you can't get any more permanent
[14:58] than death you were dead you said no i
[15:00] was alive
[15:01] no you were dead you in christ hadn't
[15:03] come alive yet
[15:05] so and you had he quickened who were
[15:07] dead in trespasses and sin
[15:08] wherein in time past she walked
[15:10] according to the course of this world
[15:12] according to the prince and power of the
[15:14] air and the spirit that now worketh in
[15:16] the children of disobedience
[15:18] among whom also we had in our
[15:19] conversation with your manner of life
[15:21] in times past in the lust of our flesh
[15:24] fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[15:26] and of the mind and we're by nature the
[15:28] children of wrath even as
[15:29] others but god who is rich in mercy
[15:33] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[15:36] even when we were dead in sins hath
[15:39] quickened us together
[15:40] with christ can you say amen by grace
[15:42] are you saved
[15:43] and hath raised us up together
[15:47] and made us sit together in heavenly
[15:49] places in christ
[15:51] this is still happening in believers
[15:53] lives what happened in the tomb
[15:55] is still happening today and you can't
[15:58] get any more permanent
[16:00] than someone is dead to us humans you
[16:02] know we can have hope
[16:04] they can be sick they can have cancer
[16:06] they've even been on breathing machines
[16:08] to keep them alive
[16:09] i heard a guy the other day been six
[16:11] years and they kept him on it and he
[16:13] come back to life and he's living today
[16:15] so as long as there's breath there we as
[16:17] humans
[16:18] we say there's still hope we hold on to
[16:21] it and some people hope in christ for
[16:23] healing but some people just hope in
[16:24] medicine
[16:25] i hope the doctors some people get mad
[16:26] at the doctors what can you do what more
[16:28] can you be done
[16:29] i remember when we were in the hospital
[16:30] with my dad and we had to make decisions
[16:32] it was rough decisions we had to make
[16:34] last year
[16:35] and it was difficult but i know what my
[16:37] dad had told us about
[16:38] you know being too long on the breathing
[16:40] machines and stuff like that but we had
[16:41] god just gave us a real peace we've
[16:43] always had that peace but it's not the
[16:45] last time we'll see our dad
[16:46] but the nurses and doctors they want to
[16:48] do another search room we just said
[16:50] would he survive it and he said no he
[16:51] probably wouldn't and we just said to
[16:53] him listen
[16:53] we we we know that this is not the end
[16:56] for seeing our dad
[16:57] and we we feel we're going to make this
[16:59] decision and we're going to let him go
[17:01] because that's what he would have wanted
[17:03] and and and i hope i'm not saying too
[17:04] much for my family's sake here but
[17:06] but we did that but they come back later
[17:08] and says we have never seen
[17:09] such a rest and peace in a family
[17:12] usually they're mad at us they're
[17:13] getting angry and coarse people would
[17:14] they're emotional
[17:15] someone's dying their loved one and if
[17:17] there's no hope there
[17:18] death is a permanent thing
[17:22] but i'm telling you in this power of the
[17:24] resurrection
[17:25] a person can be dead and there's still
[17:30] hope
[17:32] that's the gospel that i preach that's
[17:34] the gospel that's the christ i serve can
[17:36] you say amen
[17:37] so we don't think like the world because
[17:39] we look at it in this quickening power
[17:41] that god has
[17:42] restored to us even in this end time god
[17:44] has restored his quickening power to us
[17:46] and so we you can't get much more
[17:48] permanent than someone is dead
[17:50] in our life without him you can have
[17:52] hope you can you know something's going
[17:53] to happen
[17:54] but we we tend to fear death because
[17:57] death is the biggie
[17:59] death is the permanent thing death means
[18:01] that's it it's permanent it's
[18:03] finished never get to see them again but
[18:05] not
[18:06] so in jesus christ
[18:10] somebody ought to shout praise the lord
[18:13] i've said enough already
[18:14] we ought to be shouting and thanking god
[18:16] can you say man
[18:17] we've heard this stuff so much all of
[18:19] our life we lose the reality of it
[18:21] but i'm here to proclaim to you again
[18:23] and echo to you again this morning
[18:24] that if you have life within you no
[18:26] matter how low that you go and no matter
[18:29] how much mud you get underneath
[18:31] no matter how much trouble you get can
[18:33] you say man
[18:34] you may look like everything is finished
[18:36] but it's not
[18:37] finished if you've got quickening power
[18:40] in you
[18:41] you're going to rise above it you've got
[18:43] a habit that you've had for 30 years and
[18:45] you can't
[18:46] but if you get the life of christ in you
[18:48] it's going to see a
[18:49] finish to that habit and new life in
[18:51] jesus christ
[18:55] he knows how to finish trouble
[18:59] but when the trouble's finished he's
[19:01] just begun in your life
[19:04] hallelujah
[19:09] so death comes to jesus body and
[19:12] but he's getting to ready to rise they
[19:15] didn't know that they said it's finished
[19:16] it's finished it's okay it's finished
[19:18] good it's done but you see they but when
[19:21] when jesus body was laying there
[19:23] and they said it's true it's finished
[19:25] jesus was just getting
[19:27] ready to rise
[19:30] hallelujah when you think something is
[19:33] finished and there's no hope for
[19:35] something i've watched this in my
[19:36] parents or i've watched this and
[19:38] this person and i've i've seen this for
[19:40] years it's finished it's never going to
[19:42] change there's no hope
[19:43] it's over it's over don't you dare ever
[19:45] say that
[19:46] don't you dare put somebody out there
[19:48] that's left us or left
[19:49] the truth or whatever don't you dare you
[19:51] don't have any right to say
[19:53] and put them in hell you don't have any
[19:55] right to do that because there's while
[19:57] there's breathing life
[19:58] wow there's grace and i'm still
[20:00] preaching grace here this morning
[20:02] i'm still preaching that the lamb
[20:05] there's still blood on the mercy seat
[20:06] can you say man
[20:08] i don't know when that will be over but
[20:09] listen it fires me a gospel
[20:11] i'm going to keep preaching like it's
[20:12] not older you know one of the reasons i
[20:15] know this is not over yet because i'm
[20:17] still here
[20:19] and if i'm still here in this body i
[20:21] know there's a seed to come back
[20:23] somewhere
[20:23] and come to this truth you don't have a
[20:26] right to write somebody off
[20:30] you don't have a right say it's done
[20:33] it's over he's crossed the line
[20:35] and some people i'll tell you it makes
[20:37] you wonder
[20:38] internally i look at it and think i
[20:40] think wow i said
[20:42] on judgment day unless that guy repents
[20:45] he's in a real bad spot on judgment day
[20:48] because he doesn't just have to
[20:49] respectfully leave christ he's standing
[20:51] as a voice
[20:52] to try to bring down the message of
[20:54] christ that's a that's a predicament but
[20:56] you know what i don't have a personal
[20:57] right
[20:58] to judge anybody because i've watched
[21:02] them borderline blaspheme
[21:08] but it wasn't over it wasn't over
[21:12] i got a child brother paul that's grew
[21:15] up in the church and they're gone and
[21:17] it's just but it's not over until it's
[21:20] over
[21:23] praise the lord brothers and sisters do
[21:24] you believe that this morning
[21:26] and they're laying there they're looking
[21:27] at the dead he said it's finished
[21:29] there's the dead body
[21:30] jesus body was dead there and they could
[21:32] confirm this is over this is done
[21:35] but he is just getting ready to rise and
[21:37] in our text i want you to notice
[21:39] something
[21:40] we have to pay attention to something
[21:41] here
[21:43] that is very important and that's why
[21:45] it's maybe a unique
[21:46] set of scriptures to read for easter
[21:48] sunday but this is part of the easter
[21:50] story
[21:51] and when we read in our text then that
[21:54] they gave permission
[21:55] got permission from the roman gender and
[21:57] all them and through the romans
[22:00] the romans are hired the roman soldiers
[22:04] are hired now or sent
[22:06] to finish these men off and the jews had
[22:08] a reason for doing it
[22:09] passover was coming everybody had their
[22:11] reasons and so if someone was still
[22:12] breathing
[22:14] you had to go finish them off and one of
[22:15] the ways they finished them off is to
[22:17] break their legs
[22:18] to break their bones that's how they
[22:19] finish that was that brought it and so
[22:21] so the romans
[22:22] are hired now and sent to go finish all
[22:25] three of these men off to fit
[22:27] to finish the job to make sure the job
[22:30] was
[22:30] finished we know he said it is finished
[22:33] but we're going to
[22:34] make sure that he's finished we're going
[22:36] to finish the job
[22:38] roman soldiers the the jews have asked
[22:41] and i've given you permission now
[22:42] you got to go make sure especially with
[22:45] jesus
[22:46] that you finished the job i wonder how
[22:48] many meetings in the demonic realm
[22:50] is having meetings about you and that
[22:53] comes up and says
[22:54] i got them so weak and so wondering
[22:56] where they're at and mentally
[22:58] messed up and all these other things but
[22:59] i want you to finish the job
[23:01] i want you to do something even greater
[23:03] i want you to break their bones i want
[23:05] to i want you to really really break
[23:07] them
[23:07] i wonder how many meetings are against
[23:09] you every week
[23:14] i want you to go finish them off they
[23:16] just barely believe in now but
[23:18] go the extra mile and break their bones
[23:20] and their legs and
[23:21] finish the job finish them off by
[23:25] breaking
[23:26] let me say to you in the name of the
[23:27] lord this morning you don't ever finish
[23:30] jesus off
[23:36] man can never finish jesus off or
[23:40] revealing of christ
[23:41] that's come under this message of the
[23:43] last days people ask what i think the
[23:45] message is
[23:46] the message is not a dress code the
[23:48] message it's part of all that
[23:50] but that's not what the message is the
[23:53] message of the hour for the last days
[23:55] is the greatest revealing of jesus
[23:57] christ that's ever hit
[23:59] planet earth that's why i love it with
[24:02] all my heart
[24:03] because it didn't reveal william branham
[24:05] to me it revealed jesus christ
[24:07] more to me that's what the message
[24:10] it's it's not psychology it's the
[24:13] resurrected jesus christ
[24:15] come back to life again and when that
[24:17] ministry went around the world and the
[24:19] dead were raised and
[24:20] there was seven truckloads of crutches
[24:22] and all these other things
[24:23] god just did that to show he's alive and
[24:26] expressing himself again
[24:28] not so that we could have a bunch of
[24:29] healing campaigns but that you would
[24:32] believe
[24:32] he's alive again
[24:39] and he came out of the tube and he's
[24:41] able to do anything
[24:43] and if a dead man can come out of the
[24:45] tomb what is the problem you got
[24:48] any issue how does that relate can you
[24:50] say man how does that balance
[24:52] what you're dealing with right now when
[24:54] there's a power to raise a dead body out
[24:56] of the tube
[24:58] i say there's nothing impossible to god
[25:02] you can't finish jesus off this message
[25:05] reveals the resurrected christ you can
[25:07] never finish it off
[25:08] you can't stop it it's not going to go
[25:12] away
[25:14] there's only one thing that's going away
[25:17] someday and that's
[25:18] me the bride we're going away
[25:23] but the truth stands
[25:27] men have bill gather has a song man has
[25:29] tried to squelch this church out he's
[25:31] tried to
[25:31] kill it through the dark ages maybe we
[25:34] can kill him all off
[25:35] grab every christian you can find let's
[25:37] just kill him kill him by the thousands
[25:38] millions
[25:39] we'll squelch this thing we'll get rid
[25:41] of the never been able to get rid of it
[25:43] here we are in the year
[25:44] 2021 and this gospel still lives this
[25:47] christ is still being preached around
[25:48] the world
[25:49] you're not going to get rid of this
[25:51] thing
[25:54] you can't finish off christ or stop it
[25:57] it's not going to go away unless you
[26:00] push it out of your life
[26:02] can you say man so now i want you to
[26:05] notice something here
[26:06] before i talk about them breaking the
[26:08] legs of these men
[26:10] i want you to notice where the scripture
[26:12] says here that the scripture might be
[26:13] fulfilled
[26:14] i want to make a note here about in the
[26:17] last few
[26:18] hours the last few hours of jesus life
[26:22] prophecies were being fulfilled i forget
[26:25] how many now but
[26:26] you know we had all those prophecies of
[26:28] when he was born virgin born and
[26:30] all those but then the last hours is
[26:32] when the prophecies accumulated
[26:34] bang bang bang bang wonder if that's
[26:35] happening again
[26:38] in the last few hours in the last bit of
[26:41] time before
[26:41] there's a rapture and it's tribulation
[26:43] sets in a lot of things are happening so
[26:45] that's why we need to be aware because
[26:46] these men
[26:47] we're not aware that they're walking up
[26:49] to a dead body says well we won't break
[26:50] his legs
[26:51] you know they're walking right in the
[26:52] prophecy it says not a single bone will
[26:55] be broken
[26:56] they look at that dead body say it's
[26:58] finished like you said it's over we're
[26:59] not going to break his bone because he's
[27:00] not breathing
[27:01] we took his pulse he's not breathing
[27:03] they think that they didn't break the
[27:04] bones because they thought he was dead
[27:07] but they didn't break the bones because
[27:09] jesus has a prophecy
[27:11] a word over his life and i don't care
[27:14] how many attempts they make to break his
[27:16] legs
[27:17] they would not be able to break one bone
[27:20] in that body
[27:21] [Applause]
[27:25] hallelujah doesn't that give us strength
[27:28] in our lives
[27:29] you see i want to get to across you
[27:30] today that there might be a lot of
[27:32] trouble in your life
[27:34] but satan is only allowed to go so far
[27:37] for a believer
[27:41] they're walking up saying he's dead he's
[27:43] not bringing us we're just going to
[27:44] leave those
[27:44] no and so now scriptures are being
[27:46] fulfilled
[27:48] prophecies are happening
[27:51] and then they beheld him and there was a
[27:53] prophecy about that they looked
[27:55] they pierced aside they did and there
[27:56] are acting of this word that's over
[27:58] jesus life
[28:00] these things are being fulfilled right
[28:01] up until even after
[28:03] he was dead prophecy is being fulfilled
[28:07] so don't underestimate how low you get
[28:10] in your life
[28:12] don't underestimate that god
[28:16] [Applause]
[28:17] is fulfilling his word in your life
[28:20] not too many amens to that but i'm here
[28:23] to tell you after jesus was dead
[28:26] he couldn't do nothing but after he was
[28:28] dead the word is still
[28:30] fulfilling things over his life
[28:33] it's interesting isn't it and
[28:37] brother paul can i share that about
[28:38] marcus from last sunday
[28:40] you say no if you want now i won't be
[28:42] offended so i struggled
[28:44] with last sunday's sermon and i
[28:47] struggled
[28:48] a lot and this week i get confirmations
[28:51] that it was
[28:52] it should have been said but i i had
[28:55] already struggled with it as a pastor
[28:56] i'm telling you it was a rough sermon to
[28:58] preach i did not want to preach it
[29:01] so brother paul comes in the office
[29:02] suddenly after the church
[29:04] you know i'm just i'm ready to go home
[29:05] and go to bed and just
[29:07] get away from everybody i hate to say
[29:10] that but sometimes you feel that way
[29:12] he comes in he says marcus said to us
[29:15] saturday night
[29:17] he said what do you think brother paul's
[29:18] going to preach on tomorrow and
[29:22] they say of course we don't know you
[29:23] know and he said i think he's going to
[29:26] talk about
[29:27] david being anointed by the prophet
[29:31] and saul and and then he mentioned
[29:34] david and goliath so out of all the
[29:37] scriptures in the bible
[29:40] i got up and read oh just those
[29:42] scriptures
[29:44] that wasn't a little kid thinking of
[29:45] david goliath out of the mouth of babes
[29:49] i say praise god what a confirmation
[29:53] but you see it's in those low times that
[29:55] we think god's not doing anything
[29:57] we don't know what he's doing
[30:00] we better trust the lord prophecy could
[30:04] be being fulfilled right there and i'm
[30:06] not talking about my life
[30:07] i'm talking about yours and i'm so dumb
[30:09] sometimes
[30:10] did not trust god to realize in those
[30:13] times of trials
[30:14] i need to hold steady trust the lord
[30:17] conduct myself with joy in the midst of
[30:19] my trials
[30:20] can you say man slap myself in the face
[30:23] that's a quote i've learned for years
[30:24] when am i going to learn to conduct
[30:26] myself
[30:27] with joy in the midst of my trials and
[30:29] one of the reasons that we should
[30:31] is because realize that god's got a word
[30:33] over our life
[30:34] and it doesn't change in the midst of
[30:36] our trials
[30:38] somebody say pray for it doesn't change
[30:42] and you could be walking right in his
[30:44] word and not realize it
[30:48] jesus is dead he's dead and there's
[30:51] still word hanging over his life
[30:57] oh praise the lord
[31:00] hallelujah and so you know
[31:04] uh they they went and broke the other
[31:08] guy's legs
[31:09] the two thieves and their bones were
[31:13] broke
[31:14] and they walk up to jesus to do the same
[31:16] thing
[31:17] but he was different he was different
[31:19] there was a prophecy on his life there
[31:21] was a word on his life
[31:22] and it held against them breaking his
[31:25] bones
[31:26] let me say the word is stronger in your
[31:28] life
[31:29] than what the enemy can do
[31:36] the covenant over your life that god
[31:38] made over your life
[31:39] is stronger the covenant is always
[31:41] stronger
[31:43] than what you're going through the word
[31:46] that hangs over your life
[31:48] is waiting to be fulfilled and it's
[31:51] stronger than what the enemy can do
[31:54] and so you look at all the things that
[31:56] they've done to
[31:57] make jesus ready and excuse me not make
[32:00] them ready but
[32:01] all they did to jesus i was speaking
[32:03] short in the youth meeting friday night
[32:05] with brother boaz and i mentioned it was
[32:06] good friday
[32:08] and they mistreated jesus but they just
[32:10] didn't mistreat jesus
[32:12] they tore his body you look at the
[32:14] things they did to that body
[32:16] tore his body to shreds started with 39
[32:19] stripes that
[32:20] tore his flesh from his back he crushed
[32:23] a
[32:24] crown of thorns into his skull they
[32:26] pierced his side with a sword
[32:28] i want you to think of what damage and
[32:30] what kind of cruelty happened
[32:32] to that body they put nails in his feet
[32:36] in his hands
[32:37] he was slapped he was blindfolded tell
[32:39] us who
[32:40] hit you he was cursed at he was
[32:43] mistreated brings new meaning to the
[32:45] word and he mistreated
[32:46] because sometimes we can feel mistreated
[32:48] this vessel on earth was mistreated
[32:51] and not only that if you look at his
[32:52] body it was tore
[32:55] his body was tore to shreds just tore to
[32:58] shreds
[32:59] in every way and yet think about it
[33:02] there's a word or a prophecy that held
[33:05] all the damage they were doing to his
[33:08] body
[33:09] that held them only to a certain
[33:12] point of damage to that body
[33:17] because there was a limit by the word of
[33:19] god of how far they could go with him
[33:21] now with everybody else they could break
[33:24] the bones
[33:24] with everybody else they could do but in
[33:27] jesus body
[33:28] there was a limit to how far they could
[33:31] go
[33:32] is anybody listening to me this morning
[33:34] that's not for the world
[33:36] but that's for the elected of god i'm
[33:38] here to tell you
[33:39] there was a limit to how far they could
[33:41] go in the damage
[33:43] to that body
[33:49] tore his flesh
[33:54] it's been said that he died of a broken
[33:56] heart so his spirit was torn
[33:58] it's been said that he died as a man
[34:00] there the spirit left him in the garden
[34:02] so he went from the garden to the cross
[34:04] as a man crying out to the father
[34:07] can you say man there was no
[34:09] supernatural thing there
[34:11] that was just going to take over he had
[34:13] to go as a lamb
[34:14] because you can't kill god
[34:18] you couldn't put god on the cross you
[34:20] can't kill his spirit so he had to go as
[34:23] a man
[34:24] just trusting and believing and when he
[34:25] was in the garden he was a struggle of
[34:28] his will
[34:29] am i going to choose as i preached last
[34:30] sunday the choices we make
[34:32] sometimes we chew god choose god's
[34:34] choice sometimes it's our own choice
[34:36] and god lets us make our own choice
[34:38] sometime and brings us back around says
[34:40] that wasn't my choice
[34:41] when are you going to take my choice in
[34:43] the garden jesus had to make the biggest
[34:45] choice
[34:46] and i told the young people friday night
[34:47] he could have chose to stay on earth
[34:50] to get married to have a regular life to
[34:52] have a normal life
[34:53] he by freemore agency had jesus
[34:56] had the choice to do that because god
[34:59] doesn't override our choice
[35:01] he had to choose in the garden and that
[35:04] great battle
[35:05] with great sweat blood drops of sweat
[35:08] and
[35:09] here he makes that choice not my will
[35:12] but thine be done so that battle had to
[35:15] be won first but he goes from the garden
[35:17] then
[35:18] as a man believing and so there was no
[35:20] thing the bible says when he was in
[35:23] bible says when he was in the garden
[35:26] that
[35:27] the disciples were saying can't you get
[35:29] help here you know can't you can't you
[35:30] do something about it they're taking us
[35:32] away and all this
[35:33] and he says think not that i could call
[35:36] 12
[35:36] legions of angels you see
[35:40] and they would deliver them and so now
[35:42] there's still that word there he would
[35:43] ask the father
[35:44] but he didn't ask the father to deliver
[35:47] him from that situation because
[35:49] that wouldn't be the father's will
[35:52] he could have exercised it could have
[35:54] called on something supernatural can you
[35:56] say that
[35:58] you see this is the deep christian life
[36:01] that god's calling believers to
[36:03] today it's not surface
[36:07] it's not a warm and fuzzy jesus
[36:10] it's not a judging jesus as well as far
[36:12] as
[36:13] god took your judgment at the cross can
[36:15] you say amen it's a convicting jesus
[36:18] but it's not a condemning jesus you got
[36:20] to make these distinctions today because
[36:22] people have created their own jesus
[36:25] the christian world as a whole has
[36:26] created their own jesus but you better
[36:28] read your bible and get all of jesus
[36:32] but he doesn't condem he convicts and
[36:34] that's a wonderful thing
[36:36] but it's not this warm fuzzy loving
[36:39] jesus that you see he
[36:40] he went through he went through the
[36:42] garden and there was a struggle his own
[36:44] will and he could have chose
[36:45] to say i want to have but he but he died
[36:48] to his own will
[36:49] and he made god's choice to it but he
[36:51] could have called that's my point
[36:52] he could have called 12 legions of
[36:54] angels but see now
[36:56] that that that was not what the will of
[36:58] god was
[36:59] and he had to make a choice to go as a
[37:02] lamb and it's been said that he went
[37:03] there
[37:05] without and so you know if he's not
[37:07] going to call on any help
[37:09] and he's going there as a man they had
[37:12] free reign
[37:14] to do what they wanted to to that body
[37:18] and thank god he let it happen because
[37:21] it was all
[37:22] somehow related to you
[37:28] what he took on that body was related to
[37:31] you and that's why he did it
[37:33] nobody likes pain jesus didn't like pain
[37:37] but everything related including the
[37:39] stripes on his back was purchased
[37:42] when we get a cold when we get covered
[37:47] the same atonement that i believe for
[37:49] when i get the flu
[37:50] is the same atonement we believe for
[37:52] covet i don't know why people think it's
[37:54] a different
[37:54] thing oh not getting too
[37:57] amens i say praise the lord brother
[38:00] josiah is here he had covert a couple
[38:02] weeks ago did his quarantine did
[38:03] everything he could
[38:04] but guess what i want to praise god
[38:06] brother brother brother copeland
[38:07] brother josiah and his wife
[38:10] have been healed of covet i've been
[38:12] healed of colon 80
[38:14] of this congregation has been healed of
[38:16] covenant
[38:17] [Applause]
[38:21] so look what they did to that body the
[38:24] stripes were for you
[38:25] for your healing
[38:29] even even that pressure just crushed
[38:34] in the place that our greatest battle
[38:35] ever fought
[38:39] just crushed in stores just crushing
[38:41] into his
[38:42] his skull and i wonder i wonder if that
[38:45] was
[38:46] for you in your mind battles
[38:52] pierced his side nails in his head there
[38:55] was free reign to do what they could
[38:58] to that body and yet we have a real
[39:02] kernel of something that should make us
[39:04] rejoice here this morning
[39:07] whatever they plan to do
[39:10] there was a limit
[39:16] whatever you've been through or whatever
[39:17] you think you're going to go through
[39:19] if you're a son and daughter of god
[39:20] there's a limit
[39:24] satan is limited i'm ready to run around
[39:29] this room friends
[39:30] glory be to god hallelujah
[39:34] that those men could think they'd come
[39:36] there with their
[39:37] stick and think that they could i'm just
[39:39] going to finish him off
[39:41] like i did the other two men a few
[39:43] minutes ago and there was a word there
[39:45] that held over that body
[39:46] not the other bodies but that body that
[39:49] says no
[39:50] i'm not going to do that and they
[39:51] thought they did it because their own
[39:52] choice
[39:53] but it was god's choice not a single
[39:56] bone will be broken can you say amen
[40:00] i'm going to skip a bunch of this not
[40:02] only was it a prophecy
[40:03] but it was in line with the law because
[40:05] the lamb had to be spotless
[40:07] and guess what they couldn't break any
[40:08] bones of a lamb when they brought it in
[40:10] the old testament
[40:11] they they had to be spotless but they
[40:13] couldn't break any bones you can't bring
[40:14] a sacrifice like that
[40:15] so now this whole thing is exercised by
[40:17] the word of god because he's our lamb
[40:19] that is our lamb going to calvary and
[40:21] dying for us
[40:22] it's our lamb so if it's our lamb not a
[40:24] single bone can be broken in our
[40:26] sacrifice
[40:27] it's all the word can you say man
[40:29] proving this was our land the other
[40:31] the other guys had their bones broken
[40:33] but they were not the other guys weren't
[40:35] the lamb
[40:37] you listen to this now
[40:40] god knows who's his elect are
[40:44] that's right don't ever compare yourself
[40:46] with other people
[40:52] the reason they couldn't break his bones
[40:53] and broke the other ones is he was our
[40:55] lamb they was
[40:56] they weren't our lamb he was our lamb
[40:57] and when that lamb emerged in
[40:59] revelations 5
[41:00] it says he was a bloody lamb as he had
[41:03] been slain
[41:05] he arrives takes the seven sealed book
[41:08] tears the seals off the book that's his
[41:10] action in the last days
[41:12] but he was a lamb as it had been slain
[41:15] tore up body tore up a lamb
[41:18] slain killed but guess what
[41:22] don't touch those
[41:25] bones hallelujah
[41:30] the friends with all the damage god said
[41:32] the bones
[41:35] are going to stay intact
[41:39] the structure will stay intact
[41:43] the substance that's there for that body
[41:47] i say it's gonna stay intact
[41:50] god will only allow what damage he will
[41:53] allow
[41:54] if there's a word over our lives can you
[41:56] say amen and like job when they came
[41:59] before and said who can we go get and
[42:01] god
[42:01] suggests job and says you can take
[42:03] everything from him
[42:04] but you can't touch his soul you can't
[42:07] touch his life
[42:08] you can't do it and so there was a part
[42:10] that was a limitation to the devil can
[42:12] you say man
[42:13] because he said that's my elected and
[42:14] you can go take his family take his
[42:16] goods everything you want but i've got
[42:18] you on limitations can you say amen
[42:21] his soul is going to still be intact
[42:23] i'll tell you friends i've been through
[42:25] things in my life you've been through
[42:26] things but i've been through things
[42:27] and i can tell you by the glory of god
[42:29] somehow i came through them
[42:31] but i may have lost a lot but my soul is
[42:34] still intact
[42:36] the holy ghost is still intact and like
[42:39] jesus bones we're still going to stay
[42:41] intact
[42:41] my soul is not going anywhere can you
[42:43] say amen
[42:46] hallelujah satan could take all those
[42:48] parts but he couldn't take
[42:49] job's soul the structure of who i
[42:53] am is still intact no matter what i go
[42:57] through
[42:59] i'm not believing this word because
[43:01] mommy and daddy
[43:03] forced it down my throat
[43:06] i i would have been gone a long time ago
[43:09] if i was believing it because of that
[43:12] it has to be something deeper in me now
[43:16] because after all i've been through and
[43:17] all the damage and
[43:19] all the things that's been said and done
[43:21] against me against the message whatever
[43:23] it is god's prophet
[43:24] my soul is still intact
[43:28] it still believes
[43:31] hallelujah satan you can take
[43:35] what you want but there's a certain
[43:38] limit to it
[43:39] the structure is going to stay intact
[43:42] brother paul's got to find a place to
[43:44] end because this is like the
[43:45] never-ending
[43:46] story this morning i'll do my best
[43:51] i'm excited may do a lot he has a lot
[43:55] he has done a lot to me people have done
[43:57] a lot to me done a lot to you
[43:59] but there's a part that can't be messed
[44:00] with
[44:02] i may go through the worst trial than
[44:04] i've ever been but the structure of who
[44:07] i am is still there
[44:08] it's intact it can't ever finish me off
[44:10] completely there's a word that says you
[44:12] can't ever finish him off
[44:14] you can't break the bones and finish him
[44:16] off can you say amen
[44:17] because there's a resurrection power in
[44:19] there i'm going to rise
[44:20] and if the victory belongs to jesus as
[44:23] the choir saying to us this morning
[44:24] if the victory how many believe the
[44:26] victory belongs to jesus
[44:28] if the victory belongs to jesus then the
[44:30] same victory belongs to you
[44:34] bible says we are crucified with christ
[44:36] we have risen with christ
[44:38] we're part of this thing can you say
[44:40] amen first corinthians 15
[44:42] 57 but thanks be to god first
[44:45] corinthians 15 57 if you haven't
[44:47] you can read it thanks be to god which
[44:49] giveth us the victory
[44:50] through our lord jesus christ
[44:54] we have the victory can you say man
[44:56] satan can't finish us off
[44:58] because we have the victory in jesus
[45:00] romans 6 and 4
[45:02] therefore we are buried with him by
[45:04] baptism into death
[45:06] that like as christ therefore we are
[45:08] buried with him in baptism unto death
[45:10] that like as christ was raised up from
[45:12] the dead
[45:12] by the glory of the father even so we
[45:15] also
[45:15] should walk in newness of life there's
[45:18] an effect of the resurrection
[45:20] there's effect of the crucifixion it's a
[45:22] spiritual effect on our lives
[45:24] if you're not walking in newness of life
[45:26] you don't have the power of the
[45:27] resurrection yet
[45:28] but i'm telling you when you're baptized
[45:30] into the death of christ
[45:31] when you're raised up with him you will
[45:33] walk in newness of life
[45:35] and guess what you'll rise like jesus
[45:37] rose out of the tomb
[45:40] there's only one direction the bride is
[45:41] going and that's upward
[45:43] out of your habits out of your delivered
[45:45] can you say man
[45:48] notice where this bones shall be broken
[45:51] anybody saying well where's that
[45:52] prophecy at i tell you i looked it up
[45:54] this week and i i
[45:56] was surprised turn with me to if you
[45:57] would psalms 34.
[45:59] i was surprised to find where this
[46:02] prophecy laid
[46:04] that not a single bone will be broken i
[46:06] was surprised i thought there was a
[46:07] distinct thing
[46:08] talking just about jesus but as i just
[46:10] said it's not just about jesus
[46:12] it's about his body it's about us and if
[46:15] he rises we're rising
[46:18] blessed be his name and so psalms 34
[46:21] verse 17
[46:22] 17-22 psalms 34
[46:25] verse 17 the righteous cry
[46:29] and the lord heareth and delivereth them
[46:33] out of all their troubles
[46:38] praise the lord the lord is nigh unto
[46:41] them
[46:42] that are of a broken heart and saveth
[46:45] such
[46:46] as be of a contrite spirit now stop
[46:48] right there leave that up
[46:49] so now we got the lord the people in
[46:52] trouble
[46:53] god delivering them now we've got the
[46:55] people with a broken
[46:56] heart god's saving them
[46:59] anybody catch a theme here it doesn't
[47:02] matter what you go through
[47:03] there's something there causing you to
[47:05] rise god's gonna deliver you
[47:07] god's gonna raise you god's going to
[47:09] save you next first
[47:11] many are the afflictions of the
[47:13] righteous but the lord
[47:15] delivereth them out of them all
[47:19] i'm hearing resurrection power
[47:23] and there's a there's a group that will
[47:25] go through afflictions
[47:26] and they have troubles we're just like
[47:28] other people that way but this is a
[47:30] different group because the lord
[47:32] will deliver us out of those troubles in
[47:34] other words
[47:36] it is finished but we're not finished
[47:42] our troubles don't finish us off
[47:46] with others troubles come and it
[47:48] finishes them off i'm
[47:49] finished i'm through i'm done but with
[47:52] resurrection power
[47:53] and then the next scripture says and he
[47:56] keepeth
[47:57] all his bones not
[48:00] one of them is broken
[48:03] that's the prophecy and he's not just
[48:06] talking about jesus
[48:08] he's talking about all of us
[48:11] not a single bone here's that protection
[48:14] now you're looking at a broken heart
[48:16] broken spirit
[48:18] you look at troubles these are all the
[48:19] words that's mentioned here
[48:21] just hold that up there i'm not done
[48:22] with bones yet
[48:25] you look at the troubles the broken
[48:27] heart mind battles
[48:29] all the things that other human beings
[48:31] go through believers go through it too
[48:33] so you got all these things going on
[48:38] can i take my coat off
[48:44] can i tie my shoe
[48:48] this is crazy it keeps bothering me
[48:54] can we edit that part out
[48:59] so look at our experience as human
[49:00] beings now how many has ever had a
[49:02] broken heart
[49:05] you may not raise your hand well there's
[49:07] just like three people anyway but
[49:09] okay um how many has had troubles
[49:15] there's a little bit more people
[49:18] um mia says how many knows what it is to
[49:22] have a
[49:22] a locked up heart a heart that's hard
[49:26] we still have people in our congregation
[49:28] their hearts are locked locked up
[49:30] sealed tight they don't many of them
[49:32] don't even realize it
[49:34] i've been a pastor for a long time i can
[49:36] tell when people's hearts are locked up
[49:37] they're not free
[49:38] coming to church not free but i love you
[49:40] anyway god loves you anyway
[49:42] and if you stick with me through the
[49:44] holy ghost
[49:45] the trust will come and you your heart
[49:48] will be freed up
[49:50] i love you i'm glad you're here some of
[49:53] you got locked up targeted you had them
[49:54] for years
[49:55] people done you wrong preacher's done
[49:57] you wrong the message
[49:59] certain message circles have just been
[50:02] crazy i understand i've seen a lot of it
[50:06] but if it causes you to lock your heart
[50:08] or you've got
[50:09] walls and limitations that's where the
[50:11] devil's got you
[50:13] but there's a victory for you
[50:16] you can never make those excuses on the
[50:18] day of judgment you can't ever say
[50:20] well this happened and this preacher did
[50:22] this it ain't gonna work
[50:24] what god wants is your heart free
[50:27] so you got locked hearts you got all
[50:29] these conditions you got troubles and
[50:31] all these other things
[50:32] but it's all the spirit realm mostly
[50:34] when you talk about he keepeth or
[50:36] protects the bones
[50:38] if we're talking about our spiritual
[50:39] walk it's the same thing
[50:41] satan has limitations how far he can go
[50:43] with your mind
[50:44] and your spirit and just like with jesus
[50:47] they thought they could finish him off
[50:49] you can't finish off a believer either
[50:52] and no matter how many heart struggles
[50:54] we go through and our spirit is damaged
[50:55] by other people
[50:56] and our mind battles and our troubles if
[50:59] he says
[51:00] he's watching the bones there's
[51:02] something going to stay intact
[51:03] and it's never going to finish a
[51:05] believer off
[51:08] you know the bones are the strength
[51:10] that's the substance of the strength to
[51:11] be able to stand up
[51:13] amen so god says you might have a lot of
[51:17] this but i'm going to raise you up and
[51:18] guess what
[51:20] he's only going to go so far in your
[51:22] spirit
[51:23] the bones will never be broken
[51:27] i got people sitting here saying amen to
[51:29] me and
[51:31] i'm not going to point them out but i'll
[51:32] tell you they're veterans of this
[51:34] the things that they've been through the
[51:36] things that they've seen for them to sit
[51:38] here this morning
[51:39] and just purely be just enjoying christ
[51:42] the word of god
[51:43] is a miracle they're even sitting here
[51:46] it's a miracle
[51:47] hearts free worship free i say praise
[51:50] god
[51:52] when we get to this thing that's what
[51:53] it's all about that's what it's about
[51:55] what's the next verse esther
[51:59] evil shall slay the wicked and they that
[52:01] hate the righteous soul
[52:03] shall be desolate that means to be alone
[52:07] it means out in the field the land is
[52:09] definite it's barren
[52:10] so he that go back to the other one he
[52:12] that he
[52:13] evil shall slay the wicked and they
[52:14] shall hate the righteous so how many
[52:16] many's ever been hated before
[52:18] okay so that's another group what's
[52:20] going to happen to them they hate the
[52:21] righteous they're
[52:22] going to be desolate they're going to be
[52:24] left alone god probably will forsake
[52:26] them but here's our promise the next
[52:28] verse
[52:28] it says the lord redeemeth the soul of
[52:31] his servants
[52:32] and none of them that trust in him shall
[52:35] be desolate i'm holding on to that
[52:37] promise this morning
[52:38] he's promised to hold my hand
[52:42] i'm holding on to this promise amen
[52:45] none of them you if you need to read
[52:47] that this week go back it's in psalms 34
[52:50] he says no matter how far they go and
[52:52] hated the righteous
[52:53] you will never ever be completely lonely
[52:57] you will never be desolate and even when
[53:00] you think you're lonely and don't have
[53:01] many friends
[53:02] he says i will be with you even in you
[53:04] to the end you'll never be lonely
[53:06] because you have him with you
[53:07] he says i'll never leave thee or forsake
[53:09] thing
[53:11] your lord will never leave you or
[53:12] forsake you you're never going to be
[53:14] desolate
[53:14] so i see in these scriptures so many
[53:17] wonderful things about the resurrection
[53:19] because troubles broken hearts hearts
[53:21] that are messed up
[53:22] those that are being crucified as the
[53:26] words being crucified
[53:27] all these scenarios but there's a group
[53:29] in the middle of this that's going to
[53:30] rise above
[53:31] it
[53:38] the bones will stay intact
[53:43] i'd like to put that in the face of the
[53:45] devil today
[53:47] do you you've done so much satan if
[53:49] you're listening
[53:51] you've done so much to us but not a
[53:54] single bone
[53:55] has been broken i'm still
[53:58] here
[54:00] [Applause]
[54:06] proverbs 24 16 one one more scripture i
[54:09] think proverbs 24 16. look at this one
[54:15] for a just man falleth
[54:19] seven times and riseth up
[54:22] again but the wicked
[54:26] shall fall into mischief so this is his
[54:29] troubles
[54:30] this is when you fall
[54:34] and my dad used to like the joe palucca
[54:37] bag
[54:38] it was one of those you know
[54:41] balloon things you blow up he had one as
[54:44] a kid and then i think last year they
[54:45] found some for
[54:46] emmaus and uh israel and that's when you
[54:50] take that thing i did it as a kid
[54:52] give that the hardest thing just go
[54:55] weebles wobble but they don't fall down
[55:00] joe paluca you know just punch that

[57:22] we want to live as believers
[57:25] the satan's kingdom is always slapping
[57:27] us around
[57:28] how about we get to the place that they
[57:30] actually get nervous when we get up in
[57:32] the morning
[57:33] devils get nervous
[57:36] they're not afraid of biden they're not
[57:38] afraid of trump
[57:39] they have no concern about that it's
[57:41] when a believer
[57:42] won't give up can you say amen it's what
[57:45] a believer stands and says i still
[57:46] believe in the word of god
