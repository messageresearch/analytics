TRANSCRIPT
========================================
time with the word with you we know we have a few visitors with us and we just welcome all of you may god bless you and we appreciate you stopping by we are just hungry for the word of god we're simple people around here we like to worship him we like to put in a good day's worship if we come to church we should have church amen not be a spectator but to really join in and if god's doing something and you're fired up about it and god's got a personal revival going on in your heart then you have something to worship god about amen god bless you helen it's good to see you as well good day it's been a while since we've seen you it's good to have you driving all the way over here from pennsylvania but it's good to have all the sprints in amen god bless you we're going to read and continue on in the book of jonah i don't know if any of you had heard this service from last week and um where you find just some interesting things here in the life of jonah that are a bit mysterious but we just want to continue on and speak about him just a little bit and i believe there's some good lessons in here for all of us as we remind you brother bradham said that jonah is an example of us all and that pretty much covers all of us and so but if you got to dig a little bit to find the things in jonah's life because it's a little bit strange and mysterious in some areas but we're going to go to the last chapter of jonah we read the um the other parts last week and talked about them he had went ahead and did his commission and preached to nineveh and when we come to ch the end of chapter three and uh maybe pick it up here in verse nine where nineveh is actually repenting remember jonah had said you only have 40 days and god's going to destroy this place verse 9 of chapter 3 says who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn from his fierce anger that we perish not and god saw their works that they turned from their evil way and god repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it not chapter four last chapter here of jonah's life but it displeased jonah exceedingly and he was very angry notice jonah he's never just angry he's very angry he's never just displeased he's extremely displeased he's a man of extreme emotions and he prayed unto the lord and said i pray thee o lord was not this my saying when i was yet in my country therefore i fled before unto tarshish for i knew that thou art a gracious god and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentancy of the evil therefore now o lord take i beseech thee my life from me it is better for me to die than to live then said the lord does thou well to be angry what a question from the lord does it ever do you well to be angry does anger accomplish anything that's what god's asking jonah are you are you better off with your anger and there's only one answer to that every time and that's why god asked it probably it's a yes or no and it's always a no anger never does you any good then said the lord do us thou well to be angry so jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there made him a booth and sat under it in the shadow till he might see what would become of the city and the lord god prepared a gourd and made it come up over jonah that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief so jonah was exceedingly glad of the gourd so now he's not just glad but he's he's exceedingly glad what a man of extreme emotions he's never just happy he's extremely happy he's never just sad he's extremely saddened when he's angry he's extremely angry and they didn't have any medicine for him back then for such a thing i don't know maybe essential oils i don't know but god prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day and it the worm smote the gourd that it withered so just within a day he's got a gourd growing up by god and then god sends a worm to kill the gordon now he doesn't have it and it came to pass when the sun did arise that god prepared a vehement east wind and the sun beat upon the head of the jonah that he fainted and wished in himself to die and said is it better it is better for me to die than to live god said to jonah doest thou well to be angry for the gourd and this time jonah he has a response and he said yeah yeah i do well to be angry i am justified in my angry anger even unto death i will just die in my anger don't forget this is brother bran this is somebody brother brahm said not to call a backslider or an unbeliever but a son of god and said the lord thou hast had pity on the gourd for the which thou hast not labored neither made us it to grow which came up in a night and perished in a night and should not i spare nineveh that great city wherein our more than six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left and also much cattle amen and that's how it ends that's how jonah the chapter ends let's pray heavenly father we just ask for the unction of the holy ghost today lord the choir has ministered to us an anointed song that there's a rest for the people of god there's a rest in the holy ghost that you provided in the finished work of calvary lord you have given us some place to enter lord and god all we have to do is come and enter into it help us today lord to enter into your word and enter into your peace help us lord as we sit at your feet to learn of you god you said to learn of you for you're meek and lowly lord you've never been nervous about anything lord you have never worried about anything because lord when you spoke your word you knew and had confidence when you spoke it it will be done just according to the way that you said it lord jesus may we rest in that word today may we rest in your promises today and lord any need that's laying here in the congregation or someone listening online i pray that you would anoint us that something lord will be said and come from your throne to bring the answer and the victory that your people are looking for every need can be met because we know that you're a mighty god we pray you'll minister and give strength in every area as we commit the service to you in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask it amen everybody said amen amen you may be seated god bless you i don't know if you had a chance to read the book of jonah this week it's not very long four chapters so i trust maybe you if you haven't done that you can do it and i might have to take another sunday on it next sunday we'll see how far we get today but i don't know if you read it at all but it's the final chapter of jonah that gets even more strange to me and as but as we were praying and studying with and looking at this week as we look at it even remember this come up during covet last year i started to read jonah so this has been a long time coming and kind of a bottled up sermon that i've been wanting to preach because and a lot of it was i didn't really understand and it's still opening to me just a little bit but as we look deeper into it we actually find not only some great lessons for us as a christian we find some great lessons and what can what can be within us as far as unresolved anger remember he becomes an example of us all jonah had unresolved anger that wasn't dealt with within them and that anger affected all of his responses to god all of his responses to god's word his response to the message his response to the word he was supposed to fulfill the will of god for his life he had unresolved anger within him and it affected how he responded to god i don't know how much it it it affected him in his response to other people but we we know enough about human beings that someone with unresolved anger it can affect other human beings as well it can affect our marriages it can affect our families it can affect our children and it's all because somebody is letting something fester wednesday night we talked about anger having a nature to it and resentment and bitterness having a nature that it tends to grow it does if it's left unnoticed or left unresolved then it grows like a cancer within our spirit and when it begins to grow like a cancer that's when it becomes very dangerous to other people but even our responses to god as we found in jonah's life he had unresolved anger here so we find great lessons for so many things we can learn but if we look deeper we can find the very mystery of christ for the last days uh in jonah's life we find the mystery of christ for the last days in jonah's life believe it or not and so just uh just to give a a quick summary so you know where i'm going today that jonah received a message that he was to speak and to live to nineveh just like we have received a message in the last days and with that message comes a responsibility it's not a spectator thing it's not something that oh great god sent a prophet and i have this message it's never that way it calls upon a certain commitment to it a responsibility that goes with it especially after the prophet leaves and gives the message then the responsibility falls back on the people to not only speak the message but to live the message we have a responsibility we have been blessed this morning all of you have been blessed and whether you're taking that responsibility or not if god has called you to it you can run you can run hard but if god has called you to this message of the last days then he will not give up in his love for you until you're standing and taking the responsibility for that message you see some people look at it like it's a bondage but you actually should feel privileged that you receive the message of the last days because it may not be given to everybody to take the responsibility and to speak it and live it but i'm telling you if god has given it to you then it's time to stand up and take responsibility for it and to me if if it's worth living for it's worth dying for it's worth giving our lives for and so we have a responsibility that goes with it a personal responsibility that goes with the message just as jonah had a personal responsibility i want to say this that it was a message like our message that had both mercy in it and judgment in it for the people of that day in other words the people of nineveh who were sinning and god's god's anger grew towards the people of nineveh and he sent his messenger descendant so his message had judgment in it can you say amen go tell them that they don't they only have 40 days but also his message had mercy in it because when they repented god gave them mercy i want to tell you that no matter what somebody said to you about the message of the last days no matter what somebody's preached to you this message is the message of judgment but it's all the more of message of mercy and grace can you say amen noah's message was a message of judgment the raid is coming but it was also a message of grace because noah found grace in the eyes of the lord and built an ark and somebody escaped that whole thing we have a message and it's judgment but preachers should not preach just all the judgment as a matter of fact the judgment is to this world the judgment is to this satan's eden the judgments are to those who reject it can you say amen judgment is not on the bride because when you receive jesus christ you pass judgment you're not going to judgment day you've passed from death unto life so what are these preachers preaching judgment against the bride there is no judgment against the bride she's been redeemed she's been forgiven she's been justified by the grace of god you can't preach judgment to the bride of jesus christ because she's found his grace so when you're preaching you have to divide this because we do have a message of judgment but we also have a message of grace we can't just preach the judgments of god a lot of the judgments that are laying within our message go to this world and it's coming to judgment it's not if it's when this world this united states the politics the government systems every system is of man now it's god has withdrawn his spirit from it and there's nothing left but the judgments of god on this nation i don't trust any of it can you say man i don't trust anything you know you know what i do today if i read the words experts say i stop reading it i just stop reading it if you're trusting they can't get anything right they don't know what they're doing my trust is an almighty god my trust is in this word jonah was given a message of both mercy and judgment just like we're given given but the final i want you and this is what i want you to notice the final emphasis and fulfillment of this passage of scripture was not addressing the masses was not addressing nineveh final part of jonah was not to address the masses of people but actually a personal work a a personal dealing with jonah that's amazing to me because a message when you have a dispensational prophet he's not only speaking to that church that's on recording he's speaking to the entire dispensation he's preaching the seventh angel was to the entire laodicean age god speaks his prophet it's to the entire nation can you say whether they listen or not but in the last part of this mystery of jonah's life god is focusing his attention personally on jonah and i think that's something to ponder i think that's something to think about that his intentions was not on the masses but his attention was personally to jonah i feel that my lord is giving me personal attention in my life especially in the last year the word is not for a national revival but it's to bring a personal revival in my life i feel that i'm getting how many could raise your hand i feel i'm getting some personal messages to me from god and that's what was happened to jonah is that it was no longer to the entire world or nineveh and these great these nations but it was a personal message to jonah to go directly to him now let me just say this if i was heading this up if i had called jonah if i had watched his life if i had as soon as jonah had paid the fare and got on a ship to tarshish instead of nina nineveh after i had told him what he should do if i was heading this organization up in this thing i would have fired jonah very quick um you know if you got certain administrations and businesses and and different ones in the church here now have been in the corporate world and and you've hired people and you've worked with executives and certain things and some of those are pretty strict things and so brother tim i think has worked in the corporate world and so you know sometimes when someone shows k actions in a certain way then you can't go on very long with that brother boaz has people under him as well and you can't you know eventually in person if he doesn't just get it together uh he's going to get fired she's going to get fired and if i'd have been in charge jonah would have been fired early on after his actions and then at the end of it to be angry when nineveh repented uh i would have been on ziprecruiter or monster.com or whatever you go to and i would have been looking for another recruit for the job and get rid of this guy why because he proved he was not all in sometimes jonah proved he wasn't all in and he eventually did what he was supposed to do but his actions showed he wasn't all in with the message yet and so i would have fired him but guess what god didn't fire him but this he showed actions that he was he was coming and the first time he had to be you know he had god had to go get him because he was headed another direction so this is the son of god he heads the opposite direction he's supposed to be going and god says i gotta go get him so he goes and gets him he finds them and god was in the storm and he made a big storm on the water and the ship was ready to sink and then god was in the boat can you say amen that's what brother braham said and then god was in a fish so jonah he thinks i'm some of the commentators read that jonah was really didn't want to bring this message because they were gentiles brother branham said that but another thing is that he didn't want to bring it because he had a little prejudice in him that this was for the jews only for the jews that's similar to how peter was and his prejudice towards the gentiles and had a little attitude in him brother braham said he had an attitude even when god uh gave mercy to the nights jonah had an attitude about it that needed to be corrected and so now he had a little added so this made him some of the reasons why he ran away i don't want to do that i don't and so then god he goes and gets him and gets this giant fish and he catches him and and so now then then one commentator says he brings them right to the shores of nineveh and he he spits this the fish spits them out and so now they say that if jonah would have went on his own and didn't arrive being vomited out of a fish they might not have listened to him but because all of the ninevites had sea gods and made their gods out of the sea see friends god knows what he's doing they may not have listened to jonah if he had just showed up in his regular clothes but he showed up being spit out of a fish big fish with not his best executive clothes on covered in vomit and covered in whoever whatever else was in a fish and he spit out and all that was directly of god in order to give a little more emphasis and this man's going to speak against nineveh and tell them to repent and they're going to listen just a little more god knows what he's doing and if we don't learn anything about jonah please learn this it's not about you it's not about you didn't bring the message and don't try to micromanage how it's going to come to pass if god gives us saith the lord don't try to get online and figure out how it's going to happen because when a prophet speaks thus they at the lord we don't know how god's going to bring it to pass we just submit to it and believe it can you say amen if we don't learn anything learn this is that god let god do what he's going to do let god bring this message the way that he wanted to bring it can you say that let god do what he wants to do and let god do it the way that he wants to do it can we apply that to your life let god you want to see results you want to see changes you want to see this but let god do it his way that's one of jonah's problems he didn't like the way that god was doing things this is an immaturity he needed to deal with i wouldn't have let jonah go on but god looks at him he runs from god he has ill feelings towards the you know you say why wouldn't why would you fire jonah look at him he runs from the lord he has ill feelings towards the gentiles he has ill feelings towards nineveh because nineveh was always a threat to israel he would have preferred nineveh go in judgment and die because there would be no more threat to israel that's his mind thinking he thinks he's better than the gentiles he's mad because god gave them mercy which will make his prophecy look bad to all the ninevites he's self-focused he's extremely he has extreme happy moments extremely happy he has extremely mad moments he has extremely happy moments when his needs are met when his personal injuries are met he gets extremely happy i just gotta elaborate on this a little bit he has a rush of happiness and joy and he treats everybody right when his personal needs are being met personal needs loses his focus of the message of the ninevites and the big purpose of god and it's just like this gourd comes up in the heat of the sun and it's like yeah this is really nice i am really happy what are you doing jonah i'm just excited out of my gourd because of the gourd just as happy it's like people were saying man i haven't seen you this way in two or three days but you are happy as a little lark man there you're just going on this that's the problem that i have with him he he when his needs are met he's extremely happy but when they're not he's extremely angry he forgets the supernatural way that god backed him up the fish and all that he was unfaithful he was never fully on board with god and also he was suicidal that's why i would have fired him he was upset that the outcome from the message was not turning out like he thought i'd say let let loose of this guy and and i would have finished the book of jonah different than what how this finishes would you have remember i said last sunday that disney has taught us to that there needs to be a happy ending to everything please i'm not knocking disney okay i'm just saying we get taught in our culture that everything has a happy ending with serving the lord it may look like sometimes there's not a happy ending but let god do it his way let god do it his way there was a couple statements uh yesterday that i heard that dr anthony evans said and it really really affected me i think it was good he was talking about death he's experienced a lot of deaths in his family in the last two or three years his wife and different ones and there's a real profound statement one thing he said was he says i i he says if if you leave god during the midst of tragedy or problem if you would leave god you still have the problem to deal with amen i thought that was good and he he also spoke and he he was saying something about the uh when when god is in something then we trust him he's saying i would rather throw my lot in with a god who i don't understand sometimes then throw my lot in with men i thought that was good i would rather keep serving a god that i don't understand sometimes than to put my trust in men or google or whatever i would rather i think that's real maturity to say you know what i don't care what's happened unfair in my life i would rather i don't understand what god's doing right now but i'd rather stick with god even when i don't understand him that's the maturity we need can you say man that's the way that we need to look at things but i wouldn't have i wouldn't chosen uh i i would have worded it different i i don't know how i would have worded it how i would have but i didn't write the book god wrote the book can you say amen and uh you know i i would have just had the the ending the finish of the book of jonah without jonah but you see it's kind of hard because the book is named after him so it's kind of hard to finish the book of jonah without jonah it's kind of hard to kick him out as his name is in the book hello it's kind of hard to get jonah out because his name is in the book of life and if his name is in the book of life then you can't kick him out because those names who are on the lamb's book of life you can't kick them out of the story no matter what they've done you can't kick them out somebody say praise the lord so aren't you glad i'm not in charge god is in charge can you say amen and so we must be talking about a son in jonah who needs tutoring that means a son who has the potential for adoption and all the themes the last few weeks have spoken in these terms from the lord about adoption and specifically about when are we going to grow to the place that we stop responding to the things of life by our emotions by our own thoughts by our own reactions by our own anger and our emotions go up and down it's time that we really say lord i want to be filled with the spirit and live in the spirit that my reactions to god and my reactions to life's trouble are according to the will of god and trusting in god and not led by my own emotions so jonah has the potential here it's a son so a son has the potential for adoption in fact he has the life of adoption in him the holy ghost we have the potential for adoption in us because we receive the spirit of sons the spirit of adoption when we receive the holy ghost we are not fully adopted yet but we receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry have a father you can't call them father unless you know you're a son but when you become a son by the holy ghost abba father what are you going to do with me i'll tell you what he's going to do with you he's going to take you because the inheritance is all going to be yours and he's going to tutor you and put you under training of the holy spirit until you become mature enough to handle the kingdom and that's what i see in the life of jonah because his name was on the book he was a son so he has the potential it doesn't even say that he came there but i know he's still there and god is still dealing with him because he's a son aren't you glad god keeps dealing with you aren't you glad when you act like a jonah god in his grace keeps dealing with you now i could open up for testimonies and be testimony after testimony of how rough you've done and the mistakes you've made and how low that you have gotten you your wife your family come out of all kinds of things all kinds of things but you're still here today still worshiping the lord it shouldn't be that way for some reason you're here you don't have to come here you know come and listen to this overweight preacher you have a choice you ask yourself why are you here why are you here it's got to be a deeper reason than just my my kids dragged me here i think there's something within you calling you you're hungry and i just want to tell you you're in the right place i'm not talking about my church but you're in the right word you're at the right place at the right time to receive healing and mending and forgiveness in this atmosphere god can do anything so many people are coming and they're so hurt and they're so damaged and the problem hasn't gone away yet but all i can tell you i've i've got the right word here i've got the right message i've got the right presence of the lord if you'll stay in it within that will be the answer to everything i have such confidence in that all your fears and all your past mistakes and all your hesitance and your damage can be washed away by his presence so you're in a safe place this morning people say that today i don't want any drama i don't want to come and just have a bunch of i just i just want to come and hear a refreshing word from the lord so i can grow in christ and there's hundreds of people that are desiring that i'm tired of the drama and the message i'm tired of the politics i'm tired of people shooting against one another i'm tired i just want to shut all that out can i come to a place and know that the presence of the lord is there and that the word is not going to hurt me but it's actually going to help me it may be a correction but the correction is going to be in the word of god and it'll be my lord correcting me because i am a son but it may always be a correction sometimes he's going to come and say i remember peter you know jonah's the kind of guy that acted very much like what i preached on the disciples when they acted the way they acted after the resurrection i would have fired all them too they're doubting they were with jesus all they're seeing the miracles of those and then he resurrects and they can't find him and they're doubting they're fearful doubting thomas they have no faith they're they're taken off peter's denying him these are his disciples i'm saying you know call get get some new recruits start over with some new disciples but he didn't and for a long time before even he ascended he was working in the third pole not with the world third pole is not a public show it's not to the world but he's working bringing his word and explaining it to his disciples for 40 days this is what he's doing with jonah instead of in nineveh he's taking care of one man that's acting really crazy up and down he says i'm choose i'm focusing my attention on this son and i'm going to teach him a lesson now you may run from that but i see it as the love of god i see myself as special if he focuses on me he's got the whole world to care for and all these other things but when he comes in real personal to me and speaks to my heart i feel very special i feel like if he loves me that much then he must must want to do something deeper in my life and i want to be available to him so jonah is an example of us all and that sons will be child trained so in so many areas but one result is that we learn to be led every day by our father not our emotions or our fears or our preconceived thoughts of our own or prejudice or our anger or our resentment or our past hurts that we would not be led in our life by those things you say preconceived thoughts people can have past thoughts of stuff and they can see a new situation because they've had the past they ca put that in a category or put you in a category right away based on their past thoughts people can come to another church and put me in the category of their old preacher maybe he's done wrong i don't know if he maybe he's done right but but uh i don't think it's fair by your past to categorize somebody and put them in a certain category oh he's this and you don't even hardly know him yet amen i think it's not fair to do that to body of christ i don't think you're fair that you assume something other of other people that they're going to be a certain way just because of your past experiences that's not fair your past is your best and you need to give everyone a fresh start as god has given you a fresh start amen so now we we are we are not being led by our anger resentment past hurts preconceived thoughts but he's leading sons and teaching sons to truly be led because he says sons of god are led by the spirit of god that's our goal that's what we want to see in our lives you see and i believe that an adopted son is i believe this is my personal thing that uh those have been with me for years this is what i preach i believe that an adopted son is not one who today is shouting amen to the word in a convention that doesn't mean he's adopted it's not one who's shouting amen to the word at a convention but it's it's he's acting in a behavior like a son at work on monday that's a little bit different view but that's just the way i feel about it adoption is based upon god fine-tuning our behavior to bring it in line to be led by the holy spirit it's not how much you jump it's not how much you shout it's not how much you see of the mysteries of god paul even said in first corinthians 13 he said though i understand all the mysteries and have not this core of love then i am nothing he said it in the bible how many believes he said how he knows he said that so now it's not that we emphasize the mysteries or we emphasize giving to charity and we emphasize all these good works do that it's all fine i love the mysteries but adoption is a different story when your behavior every day comes in line with a son who's under submission it's not how high you shout at service on sunday it's your behavior at work on monday can i get some more amens you know it's true so we're growing under an adoption message and this is why jonah is so important to us because you see his man needed to be dealt with this man needed personal attention from god to teach him some lessons can you say amen i believe that adopts and sons adopted sons are not just that they come to a message church but they're changing and dying to their own will every day god turns his focus to jonah he's going to teach him some things kind of like brother branham said about moses brother said about moses he says he took him out on the backside of the desert to teach him some human weakness because he got so lifted up even when he was in egypt and started to see his call then he thought with all of his technique and all the things he'd learned in egypt i can do this i got this god i got this and so then he didn't think he had any human weakness because he was taught in the ways of egypt he could he was the guy to lead people out brother says he had to take him on the back side of the desert for 40 years and teach him some human weakness teach him that he was human and in the message perfect strength i was just talking about this with brother rap sister lee's beth at dinner the other night in the process of teaching him he had to believe it or not he had to teach them that he was human and out of that teaching him humanness that's where brother brown gets the message perfect strength through perfect weakness because when we are weak within ourselves and realize we can't do it that's when god has opportunities to show his power in our lives but if we think we can do it if we think we can live this message we need to learn in my humanness i can't live it when we start admitting that and being humble about it and learning and took them on the back side of the desert to teach him some human weakness 40 years and he gave him a high tempered wife along that lesson learning thing he gave him a high tempered wife and moses had a high temper and he says when those tempers got to going in the wilderness he said it must have been quite a thing when both of those tempers got going at the same time i'm quoting brother branham now not me that's the way he said it must have been quite a thing going on but what was god doing he was teaching him human weakness until then he gets the title of the humblest man and the earth later on because god had whipped everything out of him that he had any confidence in himself alone till he is ready to go down to egypt and completely trust in god to bring two million of his people out of egypt but he had to learn something first you're a human being and you can't do it without god and there's like a million lessons that god has to teach sons human weakness to teach them humility there's a lot of lessons and jonah he he he takes them to teach as he taught moses it's not your message it's his message and that the message is bigger than you how many know that the message is bigger than you the kingdom of god is bigger than you his thoughts are higher than your thoughts can you say amen bigger than your little mind and once we learn that then we let god be god and let him do things the way that he wants to do them can you say amen there's nothing wrong with the message and in jonah's day there was nothing wrong with the message jonah just had a lot of baggage that did not work with the message very well you hold on now because i'm going to read some things that the prophet said to to just seal this up and confirm it but i want you to listen there was nothing wrong with the message can i say it again there's nothing wrong with the message the problem was with jonah and if jonah had brought a lot of baggage with the message it would not work to really get the message effective so we got a great message but we get in the way our thoughts get in the way can you say amen and so now god had to work on jonah to get all the baggage out can you say a man so that now when he put him with the message he can really be affected with something and so when we put it can hinder the message and the effects of the message and so you know what the message has no problems with as far as the message itself and you know what we just if you're listening today wherever you are we need to leave the message alone we have had too many years in the message where so many including preachers have had their own agenda added to this thing and we need to leave it alone and let the holy spirit finish this message the way that he wants to finish it can i get an amen we need to leave it alone preachers you need to leave it alone preach the message but don't have your personal agenda to it don't push to get some result you don't have to push to get a result you just preach the message and hungry hearts will do it and god will do the work i believe that with all my heart and i say leave it alone leave it the way it is and so there's there's there's a hunger for the people to see an end of the agendas and politics not only within themselves in their lives but the preachers as well just leave it alone and quit trying to micromanage it to bring the expected in that you want let's let god bring it to the end that he wants let's let god finish this message the way that he wants to let's get god bring us to a rapture the way he wants to can you say amen and quit using it for selfish means jonah only got mad because he wanted to it to end a certain way and it didn't in that way can't help but tie this to thousands of people who go through things that they don't understand what god is doing they go through things and they don't understand what god is doing and as dr anthony evans says i would rather throw in my lot with a god who i don't understand sometimes then throw it in with men any day i'd rather trust god when he doesn't make sense than to trust others or to trust my own thoughts or to trust my own emotions i wonder if jonah read isaiah 55 he had access daniel had access to the book of jeremiah and isaiah i wonder if jonah had access to isaiah 55 and i wonder if he ever read isaiah 55 and verse 8 that says god says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord if jonah read that in isaiah one day he certainly wasn't listening because that's the lesson he had to learn god says my thoughts are not your thoughts isaiah 55 and verse 8. my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts can you say amen today if you've struggled with this message then maybe you just need to know that god lets you know it might be hard to understand because his thoughts are higher than our thoughts his ways are higher than our ways it's going to be different we're going to see it different can you say amen for as the heavens are higher than the earth's sore my ways higher than your ways my thoughts and your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not feather but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not how many knows how the word comes forth with god's mouth how many knows that prophets are god's mouthpiece that's how the word of god comes out of his mouth it's the mouth of the prophet so shall my word that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where i sent it amen i wonder if jonah read that so what's god really doing in this last chapter i know we've been real rough on jonah today and maybe rough on us but what is what is god doing with jonah what is happening with us in this hour this time you know when jonah sits out in the sun we're just going to get to the mystery just a little bit of this when jonah just sits out in the sun it has a spiritual meaning do you know the prophet spoke many times and said that the next thing to happen in the end after this message has went to the world you know he used the term several times what's to happen next after the message goes to the world which it has that we are to lay in the presence of the sun so this jonah being out there trying to find a shade it has a spiritual type he's right where god wants him he said where he said we're in delay in the presence of the sun to ripe him i'm gonna i'm gonna read it to you to ripen because it was just it was beyond just malachi 4 5 coming that's not only what the message is can you say amen it's malachi 4 5 and 6. if that's not established in your life then you please get with us we can talk about it and show you the scriptures that line up that there was a fulfillment to the last verses of the old testament behold elijah truly shall first come and restore all things john the baptist didn't restore anything so it can't be john the baptist he said he'll come before the great and dreadful day of the lord this elijah this restorer and so now a prophet is meant to come at the end time and some people think that's the message that's not the whole message when jonah preached the message to nineveh that wasn't the whole message that wasn't the end of it and so when he refers to it malachi 4 has done he's done his work he's brought his message but then you go what is next malachi 4 but then revelation excuse me then we look in luke 17 30 jesus said now that's malachi 4 jesus said the son of man would reveal himself at the end time the son of man the s-o-n in other words the s-o-n would shine in the evening time the s-o-n would shine like he did 2000 years ago the the the the the son of man would be revealed it's not that he would physically come not yet but he would be revealed to the people his son would shine to the people so he got jonah sitting in the hot sun but then the last part of the message is that the sun is shining brightly for what purpose not so much to the rest of the world but that sons of god would lay in the presence of the sun and ripen and mature so here's some quotes and this is the way that god would do it in this stage we were in the message coming forth and it's not another worldwide revival when the prophet refers to this what's coming next it's not another worldwide revival if you want to be in that channel you would be a part of some some of the charismatic groups today and they look and see what revival was before worldwide revival national church revival and thank the lord they're saying that the church needs a revival i mean at least they got that discernment to see the church needs a revival she's lukewarm praise the lord you know i never had i never speak against people that are searching for more of god and looking for things as a matter of fact you know some some people have criticized some of the songs that come from denominations but don't forget a couple things that when his spirit is over the whole world every once while somebody that's not in the message can catch the inspiration of the holy spirit by the true anointing of the holy spirit the vessel may not be what we want to see but they caught the anointing to write an inspired song from god wow god can anoint somebody outside of the message excuse my sarcasm but that's what the prophet taught us men can be anointed and breathe the wrong vessel of the genuine anointing of god we don't have a monopoly on god in the message we don't have a monopoly on truth is this okay with everybody we can't have that attitude you limit god by doing that i see if a person comes up to me and say they received the receiving knowledge of jesus christ and accepted the blood of jesus christ and they're starting to see changes in their life who am i to question their experience with god i don't know if it's real or not but it's not up to me to judge whether that's genuine or not it's up to me to be a representative of truth and further truth and restore truth if they're hungry for more and they're asking me i'm going to tell them there's more truth but i do not have a right to monopolize god and say god can only work in this church god can only work at these conventions this isn't in my notes this is for free we don't have a right to do that god i read it to you last sunday god is concerned about all of mankind god is mercy and if someone repents god's a merciful god we don't have a monopoly on certain things we have been blessed with restored truth and the seven seals taken off the book of redemption are we ever blessed but we don't have a monopoly on that that we can withhold it for somebody and say that there there's something different because they don't have that that's pride that's pride so we don't have those restrictions to say that god is is just just in a certain thing and so there's not going to be when we look for what's next in the message it's not going to be a worldwide revival the charismatics are pushing that thank god that they have a hunger but they're just misdirected to look and one of the ways that we know um by from jesus own words it's only 20 to one so don't worry about the time okay no worries god's not worried about it i'm not worried about it so you shouldn't be worried about it so is there going to be a worldwide revival no there's not but one of the ways jesus taught us how this son of man works when he referred to his ministry of the son of man and then he says there'll be an hour coming where it manifests itself again he prophesies that he says this term he says accept a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it goes in and it dies and then it brings it brings forth much fruit it comes up again so he used nature to show us the nature of the ministry of the son of man jesus christ coming to the generation not only back then because that's what happened is that christ that that uh that grain if you want to call it that that true thing didn't stay by himself but he was put in the ground so just exactly what jesus said and the reason he was put in the ground is that he could bring forth more more of a crop and that's exactly what happened he was put in the ground he resurrected the holy spirit came back on the disciples they took note that they had been with jesus these are not just jesus followers they have jesus within them we see the same works so now we have a crop coming up and so now that's how jesus said to describe this son of man ministry so then now if it's going to repeat in the end time jesus and the people then we see then the church goes through a dark ages and has gone into the ground because jesus said it would so that corn or wheat goes into the ground in other words christ the manifestation of the grain christ now that goes into the ground in the early church in the dark ages and it seemed like everything was over with but it had to go in the ground then springing up as a stalk just the first stage stalk in luther's message luther starts to preach a certain message and that was just a little springing up of that corn of wheat coming out of the ground it's not in the grain yet it's not a full manifestation of the maturity of christ yet but it's just the stock coming up it's in a stage it was a great stage it was wonderful the next stage he grows into is wesley's these reformers coming on the sanctification movement and it comes into the tassel part of the and i'm not a farmer so i don't know all this i'm just going off of what i i read but it's just stages that jesus said look for those stages because you'll know where you're at and we're not in the stock we're not lutheran's day we're not in wesley's day and then the shock which hovers over the grain so it can have a place to hide was pentecost what a great shock that it was matter of fact it resembles the corn of wheat a little bit it actually has such a resemblance but it's not the real thing yet it's not totally the real mature thing yet what a great move of god the pentecost what a great move of god but it's not the final stage so you're right there where brother branham is sent to the pentecostals and they loved his message they loved the healings they loved all this but when he began to really lay in at the final thing the word of god to bring the people to the final stage the shock began to pull away from what was inside without brother brahm saying going away the word just made a separator kind of like when all the 70 left jesus one day they just left him the shock has to pull away why it's time for another stage you're going to have that happen in your life when god's trying to bring the grain and maturity as a son you're going to have people pull away from you family sometimes the shucks gonna pull away don't get nervous about it don't live by your emotions it's probably a good thing for you that the shuck pulls away because god's wanting to take you deeper and you can't do it if someone's just hovering over you and you've got this shucks got to pull away that's the way jesus described it and so now when brother branham comes to that pentecostal he recognizes where we're at you guys want to bring those quotes up that's the way he began to describe it i've got three or four quote quotes here and then we'll wrap this up it says we know that this weed has come through the same process every nature works the same now lord when we see the shuck now pulling away from the grain going worldly oh god grant that those grains will the shock has to pull away so the grain can get in the presence of the sun i hear the coming of the combine lord he's praying here it won't be long and then the great elevator will take up his bride into glory in the presence so there's the final stage the combine is coming the rapture is coming we're getting out of here but there's a stage after the shock pulls away that the grain is in the presence of the sun to ripen and to mature next one go each time he just brings a little bit more and the pentecostal for their stand in their day but we're living in another day we're living when there was has been a stalk tassel shuck almost like the weak wheat but the wheat is inside the shock the shuck has just supported the wheat kept the hot sun from burning it and now the denomination is pulling away from it so it can lay in the presence of the sun to get ripe there it is again the next stage so the grain so that so that you can lay in the presence of the sun to get ripe next one so we're in there won't be no more organizations rise up this is the end of it we've had always about three years when a message starts they organize it this is that was the pattern brother brahm talked about about three years after a move of god comes up they organize it pentecost do that i think it was in two years with pentecost they're already fussing about tongues being the initial evidence of the holy ghost fussing about whether god's a trinity or he's one and so within two or three years pentecost that great move of god on azusa street they're already fussing and they split up because when something's just a reformation and not the grain yet it doesn't have the maturity of christ yet to not divide when you get to the grain there's no denomination to that it's you manifesting christ it's not that you're becoming a part of a church it's not a movement oh i'm in the message glory it's no this isn't going to another movement even though they try to make it a movement what's left there's another one i think isn't there there's one more isn't there let me read it over here the shock has pulled away and we've had 15 years nearly 20 now years of the message sweeping across the nation the nation and this morning hooked up across the nation and no organization it can't organize there has nothing ever been like it and we'll be here after the thing that that's the matter with the message listen to this now the thing that's the matter with the message today is those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened see you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake out all the greenness out of you immaturity see making matured christians you see what i mean god is coming soon to receive his church and we must have that type of christian for him to receive and the wheat has got to get ripe next one and this last great miracle move of god in this last days it's went 20 years and it's a million miles from a denomination going further away all the time the shucks pulling away no cooperation no nothing with it all right i see always it pulls away from it there can't be no more it's the wheat now but we're plenty green brother bram just told you what you were good people we're good people but we're plenty green we need to mature can you say amen is there any more is that it would take more if you got it up there uh-huh that's right have to lay in the presence of the sun to be mellowed up boy jonah he really needed that didn't he he needed to be mellowed up but he's not just talking about jonah he's talking about you we need to lay in the presence of the sun to be mellowed up that's all of it plenty green we haven't got the sincerity the sacredness the thing we ought to have in our midst to know that the spirit of the living god moving in his word and showing us the things yet that's the stage he's talking about here we are in 2000 whatever 21 here we are and i still feel like lord you're working on me this the mystery of jonah is that he he was god centered his attention on jonah says i am not firing this guy i am dealing with him and he started to mess with something personally said i'm going to teach him a lesson so when jonah lays out there by the booth and gets him some shade by the booth from the sun he's laying there and god says i don't know how to i don't know i think i'll do it this way and so why he's there he does something nice for jonah and he jonas you know jonah's extremely happy just wow this is awesome this shade here and i'm just gonna sit and watch nineveh and see what happens and he wasn't all in he should have known what happened when they repent god says he's gonna let him let him live and but but he wasn't he was mad at that and then but he was happy when a gourd came up something personal blessing came up to shade him from the sun can you imagine somebody being mad about nineveh repenting and being happy that a little um ivy wasn't a gore like we have words today it was an ivy plant very big it grew very tall strong didn't need to be tilted up or anything because we were very strong and it grew up overnight and just come up probably didn't even acknowledge it was a supernatural thing that took place and he sees that come up and he's the happiest man alive this is awesome i am so happy today i'm so extremely excited out of my gourd and god sees this guy man he's happy about that gourd doesn't even know that i put it there overnight not giving me glory for it this guy needs help real bad he's as happy as a little lark so you know what i'm going to mess with him a little bit like he does with you god will order things in your life and allow things to make it go completely the opposite of what you wanted because he's god he does what he wants especially with sons so then god sent a little worm through the night and the worms just eating that thing away eating it eating it and by by morning that whole thing was all ate up by the worm it's kind of like back when god was in the boat god was in the storm god was in the fish and now god's in the gourd god's in the worm when that happened jonah switched quickly and he gets mad that the gourd is gone and he actually has pity on the gourd poor thing man that's terrible stupid worm gorgeous vibrant and giving me shade and so such a great thing stupid worm ate it all up still can't see god in it all god's just oh this is this looks like brother burling and then he sends an east vehement east wind and if you study your bible the east wind always represented god just allowing chaos to destroy the crops and destroy the an east wind is a bad wind and god allowed an east wind to vehemently besides the sun the gourd is gone and besides all this happening god says i'll be him in it he's got the sun burning his head he's got a vehement violent east wind hitting at him and he's just showing him jonah watch your emotions because you were just so happy and he's going to turn mad again so that jonah can discover you're not living by me you're living by your emotions and we'll leave it to next sunday but god keeps talking to him and we want to get into that part that talks about god trying to show him you're more concerned about something trivial in your life a little bit of shade a little bit of convenience a little bit of comfort you're more concerned about that than these thousands of souls that are in nineveh i know this is real hard today but he just goes joan that's where you're at man just think about that's where you're at you're more concerned about that gourd and your emotions are going up and down whether your conveniences of life are met or not and i'm just here to say i love you today but i'm going to tell you we have got to grow out of life's situations thrown at us that we're we're we're ready to question god we're re we're ready to jump out we're ready we these extremes have got to stop and we got as brother bernie said hold our position when the vehement wind blows the eastern wind we stand there and say what is god trying to do and teach me in my life and when we begin to learn that then we start to get some victory because it won't matter if we have the shade or we don't have the shade it won't matter that one day you have something so nice and the next day it's destroyed you might have a nice new vehicle and all of a sudden it's destroyed the next day it's stolen the next day we've got to learn that if that happens that's not the kingdom we are to be a people of the kingdom can you say amen are you a people of the kingdom are you awake this morning i have to speak up and wake you up we are people of the kingdom and when jesus taught the kingdom to his disciples one of the things he's distinguished saying the kingdom is not like this earth thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven so he's trying to show if we're a people of the kingdom the kingdom is bigger than your problems the kingdom is bigger than your trials the kingdom this message is bigger than your life situations and you may come through them and you will come through them and you'll grow through them but always remember the kingdom is what's important the kingdom is what we serve what can i do for god for god's kingdom how can i serve god's kingdom can you say amen how can i manifest the character of his kingdom i'm a son and daughter of the king let's start manifesting king's kids and what king's kids act like i'm a i'm a child of the kingdom i'm growing into an adult of the kingdom and i want to manifest my father and express him in in his ways to this world whether i am at work whether i'm at school whether i'm up or down and my life is in shambles whether i don't know how i'm going to pay the bills next week i'm still a son of a king and the african slave conducted himself that way when he was being beaten when he was being sold when he was in another country that they didn't know who he was he in his behavior acted in his behavior like a king's son how many know the story we're in a different world tries to teach us to act like them and react emotionally and you know i'm in a bunch of financial ruins so now i'm going to go get in a bunch of debt to fix the problem that may not be the right answer so a king son says let me go to my father and see how he wants me to handle the situation let me be led by the spirit of god because the bible says sons of god are led by the spirit of god amen oh jonah is an example of us all but that's a good thing because he was a son and god focused his attention on him because he loved him and he was going to stay with him until god had made him what he wanted him to be god's sticking with you god's going to stay with you god's going to keep working with you he's still working on me to make me what i want to be he wants me to be it took him just a week to make the moon and stars the sun and the earth and jupiter and mars how loving and patient he must be he's still working aren't you glad he's still working on you let's stand together he's still working on me to make me what i ought to be it took him just a week to make the moon and stars the sun and the earth and jupiter and mars how loving and patient [Music] there really ought to be a sign upon my heart don't judge me yet there's an unfinished part but i'll be perfect just according to his plan fashioned by the master's loving hand hallelujah he's still working on me to make me what i ought to be oh it took him just a week to make the moon and [Music] [Applause] [Music] in the mirror of his word in the mirror of his word reflections that i see makes me wonder why he never gave up on me but he loves me as i am and helps me when i pray remember he's the partner i'm the clay sing it now he's still working and thank you lord to make me what i ought to be it took him just a week to make the moon and stars the sun and the earth how loving and patient he must be he's still working amen before we pray once you turn to somebody shake your hand and say i have patience god's still working on me brother jonah no don't say brother jonah i'm a work in progress holy ghost is working in my life he's still working on me be nice be patient [Music] he that hath begun a good work in me will be faithful to complete it he'll do it his way his way amen so now gideon sang this song in my life that's the ultimate goal therefore be glorified today [Music] he glorified [Music] now we're just going to bow our heads and pray i always ask you to speak to the lord he's present with us this morning it's amazing somebody like jonah can become so hard i don't know his backstory i don't know where he come from where he got all this anger but his brother says it's an example of all of us but you don't want to continue in that anger you don't want to be continue hard it's not going to be good for everybody else it's certainly not going to be good for you it's not going to accomplish christ being glorified in your life there's an altar you can lay it at this morning give up let jesus take over trust him enough help me raise your hand and say i want to give up and let jesus take over my life i've been in the message but i don't want to be in the message i want the message to be in me i want the grain christ to be manifested in my life more than ever before the walls that you have up if you break them down and ask the lord to break them down you're going to find a freedom on the other side which i never enjoyed before such joy jesus said i pray that you'll give them joy not like the world but you give them life and life more abundantly that's what he promised heavenly father learning something lord that the message was right but jonah wasn't right lord if you focused on him if you could get him lined up and get his spirit cleaned out and get him to give up his anger his extreme emotions and just trust you and he could be the right kind of person to bring the message and to live the message such a mystery behind this life lord there's hope and there's mercy and there's grace and there's strength for us to grow in this sun to lay in the presence of the sun you can make all the greenness out of us lord because we're plenty green take us in this stage lord and bake all the greenness out and bring that mature grain of christ that you're wanting to see from our lives but truly christ is glorified what we say and do what we think take this group of people lord you've already loved them before the foundation of the world you love them your love has been proven to them lord may they learn to love you back by giving such a surrender to you break the strongholds of the enemy break the things that are hard stoney break them lord god i pray that you develop such a trust and love that they would reach out toward you commit this service to you lord and the fruits of it in the name of jesus christ in my floor
