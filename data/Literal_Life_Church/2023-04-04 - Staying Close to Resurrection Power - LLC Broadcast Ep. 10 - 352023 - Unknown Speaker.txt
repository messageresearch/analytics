hi everybody Pastor Paul LaFontaine and literal Life Church in Petersburg Michigan would like to invite you to take the next half hour and enjoy some time in the word of God if you're hungry for more of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literallife.church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you today oh I was guilty of the charges Grace [Music] thank you in my place [Music] he picked me up and he turned me around today [Music] Jesus [Music] Christ [Music] happened [Music] probably [Music] you remember foreign [Music] it's not time she talking [Music] show me boys [Music] at the time [Music] okay I'll sing it again if you will remember remember but Jesus [Music] before he dropped the charger although I was wrong pass them all away [Music] Jesus Christ all the charges have been dropped I said for the vital that's a good feeling I'm before and somebody just wrote off the whole death you remember that feeling multiply that by a million times and that's what the Lord has done for us in the same man Jesus Hallelujah [Music] [Music] Mark 16 verse 9. now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils I'm going to read it again now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to marry Magdalene it would seem like he would appear to some of the other popular ones some of the other disciples first but scripture wanted to identify and make it clear that the first one he appeared to was a woman didn't come from a good background delivered of Seven Devils and he wanted to emphasize that out of all the disciples and out of all the people first one who gets to see him after his resurrection is Mary Magdalene who was delivered of Seven Devils I tell you there's no seniority in this there's no big eyes or little use it doesn't matter how many years you've been in the message it doesn't matter if you come from a good background or a bad background [Music] can you say man that's what God chose here and he says you know what I'm going to take this woman and I'm going to let her see me first and then I'm going to tell her you go tell my disciples I'm alive I want to pick up something here after right after our Lord died that's a part of the journey that I don't want to miss there was a follower of Jesus named Joseph of armathea and he was a very wealthy man who went right away after Jesus died on the cross and his body was taken down from the cross and he went right away I don't know the time he went but I know he went and appealed to pilate and the Bible says that he one place that says he was begging pilate another place he says he was bold with pilate and so you got to imagine just the scare maybe that might be in him to go and do this because the followers of Jesus were looked down on some of the disciples were hiding they didn't know what they would do with him after Jesus died but this man had a boldness he was a wealthy man he had a boldness to go right before Pilate and say listen I'm begging for his body I want his body I want to be able to take it I want to would you do it and the Bible says he begs so I don't know how long it took him but he begged enough and was bold enough that he got permission from pilate to go get the body and so he went he took the wit and took the dead body of Jesus and he took the body and he bought some real expensive linen and he wrapped that body carefully and the minute I'll talk about how they uh had the spices and they would do that to the body to uh be able to for for different reasons and I'll just get to that in a minute but he took it and he carefully just uh wrapped up put spices and wrapped the body and find linen and gave Jesus a proper burial and he gave his own uh tomb to Jesus in other words he he had a tomb that he had purchased it was also in a very wealthy expensive area and Joseph felt to give his own tomb that he had been no doubt paying on or already paid for to give that to Jesus and so we have the natural side where he's wanting to give him a proper burial and take care of that body but you got to think that some of these people are kind of acting by a revelation within them too to make a preparation of a place because you know that deep within them there had to be something that believed when Jesus said in three days out rise again so there's two things going on they're doing it naturally to take care of the body but at the same time their actions and what they're doing is actually walking in the scripture he gave his own tomb he had purchased and of course Jesus would only be borrowing the tomb for three days but it's an amazing the actions of hearing Brother Joseph Jesus made no prior main arrangements for his burial we don't have any scripture that says that Jesus called Joseph or called different ones from the cross or before knew enough any meetings where he made a a arrangements for his burial because he knew he would only be here temporarily so he's not calling ahead and said I want you to do this and Joseph I'd like you to get me a tomb I'm going to need it for three days and so if you do this and do that there's no instructions for that so Joseph is acting on his own and he goes and does this I don't know Jesus made no prior arrangements and but but the thing is that we want to get to this all of this was happening by the word of God and I didn't see it till Friday night when brother Brandon was reading through the scriptures in Isaiah 53 in many scriptures as each one of those things took place and he was wounded for our transgression he took the stripes upon his back it's all in the word so every move that Jesus made especially at the end of his life in the last few hours it's scripture after scripture after scripture this was not happening just because men were doing it to him but scripture was being fulfilled over and over and over again even when Jesus spoke the words my God my God why is thou forsaking me it's all been spoken before God prophesied of it before so he's G we know that Jesus was walking in the word even in his death but I didn't see it till Friday night because Brandon read one of the scriptures in Isaiah 53 and we see all the Prophecies of Jesus fulfilling over and over again but there's this scripture in verse 9 I think it is and it says and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit found in his mouth and when he read that I thought my isn't that amazing so it's not just Jesus fulfilling the word but others are walking in the word as well and I was just wondering how long it took our brother Joseph to discover I don't know if he discovered it three days later I don't know if he discovered later in the upper room because he was there but later on he must have discovered that not only in Isaiah 53 while he was reading Not only was Jesus in there but Joseph was in there because he provided this very wealthy place for Jesus it talks about the rich and he says he'll be with the rich and his death I wonder if Joseph said no you know what that's me few days ago I did all that because I wanted to do it on an honor for Jesus body I didn't realize there's a scripture about me I'm walking in the word every day I didn't know it but I'm walking in the very scripture just like Jesus I understand my God my God why is Thou forsaken me I understand Jesus place in the word I see how he come and fulfilled all that but once you see yourself in there and you realize you're walking in the word I tell you you get a Revival in your heart this Mary Magdalene she she wants to stay close to Jesus even though he is dead so there's very little written about Mary Magdalene very little just one or two verses on that's her biography but she is named uh she's named in all the places all four gospels her name is there we've only got one other scripture for her about her life being delivered to Seven Devils that's it that's her biography but in all the gospels she's mentioned at the re at the crucifixion she's mentioned as Jesus is walking down the Via Dolorosa the way of suffering she she was at the crucifixion she was at the foot of the cross with Jesus Mary's uh Jesus mother Mary uh as far as how we look at it and then then she was there and then they had to go home after and she watched him die they watched him take the body now she was there through all of it and and then she went home because they had to stay home for the Sabbath they couldn't do any work but the prophet refers to going to her going home the scripture refers excuse me the scripture reversed she goes home Friday night and with Mary they begin to prepare spices because they're going to go be near that body after the Sabbath is older they're going to go give spices to that body she wants to be near she wants to be near that body I don't understand it carnally you don't understand it but she wants to stay near that body even though everything says he's dead he's finished he's done she still wants to stay near the body of Christ all right amen I say this real clearly to you I don't care what's going on in your life I don't care how low it's got and I don't care how hopeless it seems you know what you should do stay close to the body of Christ your answer is not to distance yourself and have an arm's length relationship and go out there no your answer during those dead times is to stay close to the body of Christ doesn't the Proclaim that as we get closer closer and so much the more as we see the day approaching why because we're in Resurrection time we're not 30 years ago we're closer to Resurrection time than we've ever been before and this woman an ill-fame woman that come to the Lord she just wanted to stay close to that body so you know she is named in all the places she in all the resurrection places and the closing hours of Jesus that's when she's named Mary Magdalene Mary Magdalene in other words she may not have a name she may not have been somebody but she popped up at the most important time and that was Resurrection time he's alive and well this morning it changes our life he changes our countenance doesn't matter what you're going through doesn't matter what you feel the deepest depression can be lifted by the power of Resurrection this morning so the small bile that is of Mary Magdalene is Luke 8 chapter 2. that's all we have you guys can pull it up Luke 8 chapter 2 and uh it says this is about Mary Magdalene just if you wanted to know what said about her says and it came to pass verse 1 afterward that he went through every city Village preaching and showing the Glad Titans of the kingdom and the twelve were with him and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities how many raise your hand and say I've been healed of infirmities and spirits because of Jesus certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities Mary called Magdalene of of out of whom went Seven Devils and Joanna the the wife of shusa Herod Stewart and Susanna and many others I like to go into each of these lives and see where they come from Herod Stewart my goodness Harold Stewart the wife of Herod Stewart Susanna and many others which ministered unto him Christ of their substance but you see now that's all that's written out of her life but she's all over during the time of the Resurrection she's there were you there When They Crucified My Lord and guess what Mary could say I was really there I was there at the cross I was there when he died I was there in between I ran I got up early Sunday morning I don't know how early you got up this morning she ran she got there as quick as she should and she could say I was there when he come out of the Tomb and I was the first one he appeared to then she had to go tell 12 disciples I need to stay to my notes here and preach this but I can't help but say it she's the one that had to go this woman the woman we don't listen to a woman you know in the culture even the Jewish culture there's a just a bit of that you can't deny it you know and it just it's man they get proud and they don't treat their women right and stuff so but here's a woman and Jesus says I'm going to appear to her first and I want her to be the first witness of my resurrection and she has to go tell the disciples who by the way are hiding they didn't run towards the tomb they didn't want to be around the body they had basically given up and Jesus said you know what you see me I want you to go into the house of those disciples and you be the one saying I've seen him he's alive [Applause] Lord are you sure I want to do you sure you want me to do this I'm a woman they're not going to believe and guess what they didn't and then Peter and John I think it was finally decided they started to run towards the tomb found out he wasn't there the woman's telling the truth she's the first Witness I'm saying Jesus chose Mary Magdalene to be the first one to get to see him and the first one to witness his resurrection so you think this morning you're unworthy to witness you're unworthy because of your life you can't say nothing get the preacher to do it call Brother Paul somebody's asking me a question call Brother Paul no don't call Brother Paul tell how the candle got lit yourself you'll be a witness to Jesus Christ and so then when Joseph went to get the body there on Saturday um the name Nicodemus pops up and he wants to go with Joseph Joseph you're going to get the body I want to go with you I'm going to buy some expensive spices this is all in your Bible now I'm going to buy some expensive spices because I want to Value the body of Our Lord can I go with you when you go get the body you got permission I'm going to go and I'll help you work on the body we'll put in the Tomb and so Nicodemus does anybody remember that name who came to Jesus a ruler a Pharisee in Israel and he came to Jesus by Night secretly and he asked questions about the new birth and he got his questions answered but there's no other scriptures from we don't see him again there's no biography there's no there's no there's not even he was delivered to Seven Devils like Mary Magdalene but his name pops up and he wants to buy the expensive spices to anoint the body of Jesus and to to get it to prepare his body he pops up again at the end didn't Jesus say the last shall be first and the first shall be last didn't he give the parable of each worker getting a penny and they worked and worked and worked all those years and then some workers in the city said we don't have a job and they and the the king says we'll go to my person in charge and they'll give you a job and some of them came the last hour and they went and got a job and when payday came they were all paid first by the way paid first the last minute dudes got paid first the same amount as all the other ones that had worked for years and all of them said what's up with that dude very fair what's up with this we worked all these years striving we've labored we've done this and this new kid on the Block comes along he's only been around an hour he come at the very last minute Nicodemus where you been I don't know but I'm here now [Music] I want to honor this body there's something in the media says it's truth I don't know all the details I don't know any of the scriptures I don't even know what I'm doing but I want to honor this body I want to stay close to this body [Applause] last minute Believers coming in listen God has his own leadership it's not about position if it had been about position Mary Magdalene was not qualified to be the first to see our lord Jesus was saying this is not about position it's not about the leadership it's not the big eyes are little use it's those that are staying close to me what if Jesus were to come down and ask me who my leadership was and then he said no no no no and he grabs all you guys and brings you up front Paul knew what I choose these guys this is your leadership just blow our minds always isn't that can't happen can't happen well one thing I learned about these guys and the girls too is that they're not struggling for positions they're just enjoying being here being at Sunday school I'm sure they might resist sometimes but for the most part they just want to be around I just want to be here I think that's honorable but what comes out of these guys is Purity there's not a struggle they learn that when they become an adult they come closer to the kingdom of God it's all about just stay around the kingdom of God just stay around where he's at it's not about position it's not about position it's about character it's about loving our Lord the Bible shows Mary went home Friday after she was dead and her and her other the other Mary prepared spices they did nothing on the Saturday the Sabbath they weren't supposed to even prepare spices but they did it on they did it before they prepared it and they got up early Sunday morning they prepared them on Friday got up early Sunday morning and there's you'd be surprised how many scriptures speak about this it's in the Bible got up early got the spices and in history now the main reason a dead body was anointed with spices was to control the smell of decomposition Jews did not practice embalming and the funeral spices were a way to help minimize unpleasant odors that's why Martha at the grave of Lazarus there she was saying something like that that if you opened up that it's going to smell and different things and because they didn't embalm and so she was worried about that but the the the spices the women brought to Jesus too were intended to eliminate such an order and to honor the body of Christ why are they doing all that well it's to honor the body of Christ and I'll tell you when you do the simplest little things to honor him he doesn't forget it so it's honor never find these actions at this time by the disciples the scripture shows the disciples crying mourning hiding but these here women wanted to be around the body of Christ to honor the body of Christ and this may not fit but I just want to just stay close I I just want to I'm taking this lesson out of this this morning because I know we're in the days of the time of the final Resurrection how many Believers would agree with me we're in the times that could happen any time that the Saints should appear and we're getting out of here we're closer than we've ever been and this may be a strange sermon to you but I just want to say I want to stay close to the body of Christ honoring it then out doing something else right now that's where I want to stay close to if you get my message today it's staying close to resurrection power staying close to the body of Christ this thing is almost over it's not time to fight can you say Iman it's not time to fight over Doctrine it's not turn time to take stabs at other churches it's not time to fight it's time to love one another with Divine love and stay close to the body of Christ stay close to the word of God it's time to honor our Lord and his body like we never have honor means you don't speak against it honor means you don't gossip against it honor means you have high respect for your brothers and sisters [Applause] Body of Christ because Resurrection is about ready to take place [Applause] the website literallife.church and if you would like to come and visit us in person consider this your personal invitation we're just 15 minutes north of Toledo at 11 100 Summerfield
