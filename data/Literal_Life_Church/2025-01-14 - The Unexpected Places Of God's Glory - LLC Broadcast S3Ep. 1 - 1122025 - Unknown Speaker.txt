today [Music] it's not what I prayed for it's not what I wanted it's not something I understand my circumstances may be so confusing I'm placing it all in your head your ways are higher than mine I want mountains to move you want me to CL so I'm going to trust your work your will and your T you your ways are higher than [Music] mine one day I'm sure I will look back and Marvel at how you knew

trust your work your will and your T your ways are higher than mine oh when I start to die help me believe somewhere so far above me your ways are higher [Music] than I want mountains to move you want me to C so I'm going to trust your words your will and your [Music] Tong your ways are so much High higher than [Music] mine your ways are higher than mine I'm in Hebrews chapter 2 and verse 6 but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visited him and so he's referring to Psalms chapter 8 and we'll go there just in a minute Paul in Hebrews is referring back to what David said in Psalms chapter 8 but it says what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou Vis visitest him thou mest him a little lower than the Angels thou crownest him with glory and honor and did set him over the The Works of thy hands thou Hast put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering and so this is quite amazing because he's just spoken of crown and glory and uh this is uh being mindful of his son coming and fulfilling something here and we've we've seen thou crownest him with glory and honor and then this word suffering comes in thou was made lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man for it became him for whom all are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings I'd like to point out that whatever suffering his son went through here it was for the benefit and the life of many sons after that to come to glory and if he hadn't come through that suffering we would not be able to come to that Glory so there was a suffering but God was in the God's glory was in the suffering and he turned the the evil towards good so let's go quickly let's go because Paul referred to Psalms 8 let's go back there and read that before we jump into uh the rest of this he refers back to something uh David says here in Psalms it's very has quite a a wonderful mystery to it and this term uh what is man is three or four other places in the Bible where he says what is man that thou art mind for him or what is man job says it a couple of time what is man uh because when you look at we're nothing and then God chooses us to place us in a position as sons and daughters that we would have never expected remember we fell in the garden when they fell we all fell with them and so Sons lost their position in place of Glory as Adam held we fell from that and we all fell with it and so now we when we look at the glory of angels and the glory of Heaven and the atmosphere and the Majesty of the firmament and everything he's created ated and then all of a sudden God chooses to choose man to bring the most of his glory through that's why the term comes what is man that you would be mindful of him that's the kind of humility that we need can you say Amen uh we're nothing without him so we would be saying that what is man who am I the song says who am I that I would be worthy to receive these benefits so he says here in Psalms 8 if you'd like to read with me uh how it's it's worded here Psalms chapter 8 and uh just at the beginning oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name in all the Earth who has set thy Glory above the heavens out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest steal the enemy and the Avenger when I consider thy heavens and the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou has ordained how many know you can see God's glory in all of that you can see God's manifestation and he's looking at it and saying when I see how great all that is the heavens and the work of thy fingers he says in verse four what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him so what the son of man refers to of course we know it as a prophet but what is man what is the son of man that you would visit a prophet what what is it that you would so use a prophet verse five for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with Glory and Honor thou mest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands that thou Hast put all things under his feet all sheep and oxen yay and the Beast of the field the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas oh Lord our Lord how excellent is thy name in all the Earth what is man that thou mind for him this is where Adam fell from is the glory of the Lord so filled this man that he had he had dominion and God put the whole earth under his charge and his Dominion he took care of things he was in charge of it and he was a minor God on Earth God poured his glory into them that he could have that kind of power he what is man that thou crownest him with that kind of Glory he had all of his angels He had all the all the ones worshiping him he had all the ones but yet he creates man on Earth and he puts him in charge of all of it and gives him his glory to be able to do it what is man that thou are mindful of him that's an amazing aming thing then man falls and Paul's bringing it up in Hebrews saying we can use the same scripture because now we have our Lord who was made a little lower than the Angels crowned with power and Glory but he goes into it here and he says but not without going through a great time of suffering the unexpected places that we see God's glory and I want to get into that a little bit now I want to go back to 2 Corinthians 3:18 and we all with open unveiled face I'm reading it in the Amplified but you can read it there continually seeing as in a mirror the glory of the Lord when we're looking in that are progressively being transformed into his image from one degree of Glory even more to even more Glory which comes from the Lord who is the spirit we ought to be able to uh sing take the name of Jesus with you you and shout and say praise the Lord we've heard enough in that scripture that we could look into the very face of the Lord and into his glory but it's not just looking at something we're not changed by as we look into the right thing and we don't have any veil in front of us we are transformed into his image from one degree of Glory to another greater degree degree of Glory praise the Lord so how are we changed by a progression from one one degree of Glory to another how are we changed from one degree of Glory to another I'm so glad that's worded that way because I don't find it in that in that just Bible education right how are we changed by going to Seminary how are we changed by psychology no this is not psychology this is not a mental exercise this is not trying to smear on Jesus in Act like Jesus this is not being educated into something can you say Amen this is the spirit of the Lord having access to you with no veils on your heart no veils on your eyes and that spirit moves you from one glory to another Glory there's no psychology in that there's no mental exercise in that there's not trying to better yourself in that if you're looking at the right thing with no veils on your heart and no veils on your eyes you are change from glory to glory you are advancing to another degree of Glory all the time you just have to watch because sometimes it won't be as visible to you but it's changing you from glory to glory to glory can you sayen and it's more and more Glory all the time it increases it multiplies this is a great multiplying of his glory and it's kind of like compound interest on steroids this is this glory is like compound interest do you know what compound interest is right you should because you're going to be very successful in life if you understand compound interest we have Dave Ramsey things here that we play and whenever we do it you should get in there because you learn the what they call the power of compound interest how many knows it just all right just a few of us hopefully you learned it when you were young and hopefully you applied it the power of compound because that's why they call it a power because it's an amazing multi multiplication or or not just duplication but it's an amazing powerful uh growing of something not not simple interest it's a it's on the other thing of simple interest but this is something bigger it actually is um I looked it up for you and you young people if you caught this when you were young uh this would be a good thing for this life anyway compound interest um in the Dave Ramsey there's some type of an example of a of a young person gave $100 a month starting at 21 years old and put it and never touched it by about 50 I think they said they you'd be a millionaire just by the compound interest now how does all that money $100 a month doesn't seem how does it get to a m million because compound interest meaning that the interest you earn each year is added to your principal so it's what you take your principal all the interest added and then that goes again to another year another month however you got it compounding so that the balance doesn't merely grow it grows as an increase at an increase ining rate it's one of the most useful concepts of Finance it is the basis of everything from a personal savings plan to the long-term growth of the stock market if you didn't get to Dave Ramsey I'm giving you a little bit tonight so latch on to it all right this is free this don't cost you anything all of our classes are free compound interest is interest calculated on both the initial principle and all the previously accumulated interest it's all of it and then it keeps accumulating generating interest on interest is known as the power of compound interest and it's nothing compared to the glory that keeps advancing from glory to glory to glory can you say Amen that means god takes the glory you already had within you he doesn't take any of it away he actually takes all of that and he works off of that to give you more Glory Hallelujah don't just subtract from it he actually adds to it and brings more and more and it compounds and so this is not a bettering of yourself this is not just a a better you this is the very glory of God on your life to come into the image of Jesus Christ amen that's not trying to make yourself better this is looking into the word and into his face and you're transformed by I'm so glad it's worded that way it's about his glory it's not about intellect it's not about trying to because most of you can't remember uh some of the scriptures sometimes anyway I'm glad this is not based upon intellect I'm glad this not remember I can't remember all the quotes of the Prophet I'm glad how many is glad it's not based upon how much me is brought you should put it in your memory you should Lodge it in there first the mind is the wound of the soul but it's not dependent his glory is not dependent how much knowledge you have up here it's his glory coming to change you from glory to glory it's it's changing it's doing it can you sayen and I'm so glad this is not based upon what I can remember in my memory because I don't remember a lot of things these days as I've said I'm glad this whole gospel is not based upon good looks because I wouldn't have made it either and you that are laughing probably wouldn't have made it either I'm glad it's not based upon how much money and how much compound interest we make in us it's not make made how much you could be poor and still be wealthy spiritually it's based upon the glory of God coming into your life your very life and to come into his life in the image of Jesus Christ and there's no cost with that there's no intellect with that it is what God is does as we're looking at him so now one thing that's been intriguing me in this subject is to just explore the examples of how his glory can come in unexpected things and I've read a couple quotes to you but how his glory we should never underestimate where his glory can show up we should never underestimate where his glory is beginning to work we should never uh take maybe years of the hardship of our life and think that there's no glory in that God can turn it around and all of a sudden you look at it completely different and His glory was growing and manifesting through those things Isaiah chapter 53 and this is one of the greatest uh places to really show the extreme of God God's glory and the crowning coming from something that is so unlike we would think it would be who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed there's that word revelation so here's Isaiah he's a prophet and he's saying who is going to believe what I'm saying because I'm giving the report of the Lord I'm giving the word of the Lord but who's going to believe it I can tell you most people ain't going to believe it so he's asking a question who is it revealed to who is it that's going to be a believe the prophet for their generation very very few who will believe my report as a prophet and who is the armor the Lord revealed because it's not just believe in a prophet it's got to be revealed to you but who is it revealed to it's a question who is this going to be revealed to who believes the prophet's report but then to whom of the armor of Lord is revealed who is the kind of person it's revealed to is the question who is it reveal revealed to so I want to take a look at something that's real hidden and he takes it right into the lamb Christ coming and the way that he come I'm going to read this out of the uh Amplified it's pretty close uh but just I want to read that you guys read along here for he the servant of God grew up before him like a tender Shute plant and like a root out of dry ground he has no stately form or Majestic Splendor it's worded there in your Bible there is no beauty that we should desire him think about it now he was oh no that that we would look at him nor handsome appearance that we would be attracted to him he was despised and rejected by Men A Man of Sorrows and pain and acquainted with grief and like one from from whom men hide their faces he was despised and we did not appreciate his Worth or esteem him why would PE people miss him like that they can't see the glory of God in that they can't see the glory of God they they because they're looking for the wrong thing rejection despise hiding their faces we're ashamed of him and this is the Messiah they were expecting to come he came with no Beauty he came with no Splendor verse four but in fact he was born he has borne our griefs so now you you know watch something switch because we want to preach on this in a minute he he just switches the theme to R in other words he's doing this but he's bearing he's bearing our griefs he's bearing our sins in fact he has borne our griefs and he has carried our sorrows and pains yet we ignorantly assumed that he was stricken struck down by God and degraded and humiliated by him by God but he was wounded for our transgressions he was crushed for our wickedness our sin our Injustice our wrongdoing the punishment required for our well-being fell on him and by his stripes his wounds we are healed all of us like sheep have gone astray we have turned each one to his own way but the Lord has caused the wickedness of us all our sin our Injustice our wrongdoing to fall on him instead of us he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he did not open his mouth to complain or defend himself like a lamb that is led to the slaughter and like a sheep that is just stop just stop just you've read these scriptures hundreds of times but stop just a minute an unexpected place for God's glory we're saying there's no glory of God in that and yet watch watch God is just at the temple when he's seen all going on there he just breathed in he was so pleased but now we have someone rejected and despised and shame and no Beauty and everybody's rejecting him and God's back saying he's pourn out his soul this is beauty to me Hallelujah see friends listen let's get a lesson here why don't everybody stop looking at the world's qualifications for somebody and what they wear or what they do or their gift because God doesn't look at beauty that way young girls God does not look at Beauty the way the world makes you look at Beauty God is featured in character and not the beauty of this world all all of us like sheep have gone astray we have turned each one to his own way but the Lord has caused the wickedness of us all our sin our Injustice our running to fall on him instead of us he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he did not open his mouth to complain or defend himself like a lamb that is led to the slaughter and like a sheep that is silent before her shears so he did not open his mouth after oppression and judgment he was taken away and as for his generation his contemporaries who among them concerned himself with the fact that he was cut off from the land of the living living by his death for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke of death was due his grave was assigned with the wicked but he was with a rich man in his death uh because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet the Lord was willing to crush him causing him to suffer and the way that's worded in your in in in the King James I like it better than King James on this one verse 10 it pleased the Lord to bruise him try to figure that out is everybody listening how many y'all still saying well I want to please the Lord in my life he's standing back and watching Calvary and watching all this and watching his life of being despised rejected laughed at and made fun of and you know we just have a little person give us a little look sometimes and we just go crazy a young girl has somebody young guy has somebody you know maybe in the youth group or somebody at work and let me tell you something listen let me just establish this this is not a perfect world people are not going to treat you right and that goes for church sometimes and it goes for Walmart that you're in it goes for Starbucks it goes for your job your parents didn't teach you right this is a world that's going to put you down they're not going to treat you right said well I deserve to be treated right listen grow up grow up it's not going to treat you're right you're going to be laugh make fun of then you start to serve the Lord even within the church sometimes you're going to have people look funny at you and let me just say this if you're not prepared as a Christian to endure rejection and being despised like Jesus was you're not ready yet to be a full Christian what kind of Life are you with wanting when you walk into all kinds of situations and you can't stand being despised or rejection you know there's people that take tests and they have high rejection scores if you take a test um you can see where you score on what's high in your life you have rejection issues you can't handle rejection you know a a single guy that has that it's terrible he'll never get married seems like because every little thing you've used as rejection these are things to overcome as well but if you live a life saying I'm not going to be around anybody I'm not going to do anything I'm because I can't handle rejection you've got to handle rejection and if you're a Christian you better get ready for some rejection you better get ready to be despised I'll just make it personal the Lord spoke to me the other day and a real unique thing took place I told my family about it I was in the truck and just praying and the squirrel comes up looking for food I grab some nuts cuz I had some in the truck I grabbed a couple nuts I looked it up said this is the best food for squirrels right here I threw a couple nuts out he looked for them in the grass he took that nut and looked right up at me and ate a couple bites and threw it down and walked away and refused it now listen friends I don't like to read anything into things but I was really praying about the rejection issues in my life I'm serious so I said buddy I'm feeding you what says is your best food and these are pretty good I spent a lot of money for these I grabbed a handful and I threw them out in the yard they went everywhere he comes back up again he finds one in the grass and he comes right up to my truck and holds it in his hand takes a couple bites like that runs away goes and looks for other food you want me to tell you what the Lord said some of them are leaving you not because of you don't take it personal they don't like the food you're feeding them so if you have a hard time with the rejection you're living in a pretty cruel world but even amongst the church you're going to have little clicks and little things take place what's the answer you become stronger you grow you grow Raw confident to walk in the room and say I know I know who I am oh everybody's kind of looking at you funny who is what is he doing you're so confident so tough skinned you just walk oh oh I know who I don't do that that might be Pride I don't know but you have to be confident you got high rejection you come into the kingdom of God and you're not prepared for rejection I don't want any of that you're not prepared to Bear what Christ bore cuz he bore rejection and despised from people and he did it for you thank you for watching our
