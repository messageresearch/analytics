[22:22] testing.
[22:30] Praise God.
[22:32] I just want to testify this morning. We
[22:34] had the results from our PET scan
[22:38] came back and uh for the most part it's
[22:42] completely clean scan. We just want to
[22:45] thank the Lord for his healing power and
[22:48] um they're going to do a little test on
[22:50] one area, but we're just believing that
[22:52] it's uh the doctor said it's probably
[22:54] just scar tissue from the healing that
[22:56] we've had. So, we're just really pleased
[22:59] and we're pressing on and asking the
[23:02] Lord to just do a finished work in our
[23:04] bodies.
[23:06] We were practicing yesterday for uh
[23:10] singing at the fairgrounds
[23:12] uh tomorrow night
[23:14] and we were doing this song and I just I
[23:18] just love this song and I love the
[23:20] words. So just listen to the words
[23:24] [Music]
[23:27] &gt;&gt; at my door

[23:41] we near
[23:47] entrance within
[23:51] he
[23:53] [Music]
[23:57] who is the voice
[24:01] I hear
[24:06] and Sweetly
[24:08] the toes
[24:11] are falling.
[24:14] [Music]
[24:16] Open
[24:18] the door
[24:20] for me.
[24:27] Thou will he

[25:20] delayed.
[25:22] [Music]
[25:26] Will he not pass
[25:30] me by?
[25:34] [Music]
[25:35] And sweetly
[25:38] the tones
[25:40] are falling.
[25:44] [Music]
[25:46] Open
[25:47] the door
[25:50] for me.
[25:56] If thou will heed
[26:00] my calling,
[26:02] [Music]
[26:07] I will abide
[26:10] with thee
[26:14] and I will I will abide
[26:22] [Music]
[26:23] with thee.
[26:28] [Music]
[26:33] [Applause]
[26:40] We're going to read from Joshua chapter
[26:42] 6, two or three places, but we want to
[26:44] start there this morning. And you know
[26:47] what? God is good. Can you say amen?
[26:51] &gt;&gt; God is good all the time. And I pray my
[26:54] heart's desire this morning is that he
[26:57] would visit us. Our Lord is the special
[26:59] one among us. I pray he would visit us,
[27:01] but I pray my gift would be a help to
[27:04] all of you this morning. Joshua chapter
[27:07] 6
[27:09] and verse 10. I'm just going to pull
[27:11] out. I won't read the whole chapter, of
[27:12] course, but Joshua chapter 6 and verse
[27:16] 10. And Joshua had commanded the people,
[27:19] saying, "Ye shall not shout, nor make
[27:23] any noise with your voice, neither shall
[27:26] any word proceed out of your mouth until
[27:30] the day I bid you shout. Then shall ye
[27:33] shout." Uh, if you know your Bible,
[27:36] we're in the setting of the of Jericho.
[27:39] And um, I'll just add in this chapter 6
[27:42] and verse one. Now Jericho was
[27:44] straightly shut up because of the
[27:46] children of Israel. None went out and
[27:47] none came in. So they had already
[27:49] surrounded the city. And the Lord said
[27:51] unto Joshua, "See, I have given into
[27:54] thine hand Jericho and the king thereof,
[27:56] and the mighty men of valor." God had
[27:58] already said, "I have already given you
[28:01] Jericho." Now, shouldn't that charge the
[28:03] saints of God to know he's already given
[28:06] it to us?
[28:08] &gt;&gt; So if he's already given it to them,
[28:10] then let's go do it. Let's go do it. But
[28:12] now God tests the people because he's
[28:14] going to do the battle plan his own way,
[28:18] not our way, not their way, but he's
[28:20] going to do the battle plan. And we have
[28:22] to be submissive and obedient to the
[28:24] battle plan. And the battle plan was
[28:27] stranged because said he said in verse
[28:29] 10, he said, "You shall not shout nor
[28:32] make any noise with your voice, neither
[28:34] shall any word proceed out of your mouth
[28:36] until the day I bid you shout. Then
[28:38] shall you shout." And for six days they
[28:41] had to shut their mouths until God said
[28:43] to shout.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Verse 16.
[28:48] And it came to pass at the seventh time
[28:50] when the priests blew the trumpets,
[28:52] Joshua said unto the people, shout for
[28:55] the Lord hath given you the city.
[28:59] Verse 20. So the people shouted when the
[29:02] priests blew with the trumpets. And it
[29:04] came to pass when the people heard the
[29:06] sound of the trumpet, and the people
[29:08] shouted with a great shout that the wall
[29:12] fell down flat, so that the people went
[29:14] up into the city, every man straight
[29:17] before him, and they took the city. I
[29:20] love to read about victories
[29:23] &gt;&gt; in the word of God. Believers are all
[29:25] about victories.
[29:26] &gt;&gt; I know the devil likes to make your life
[29:28] a life of defeat, but if you're a
[29:30] believer, it's a life of victories.
[29:33] Praise the Lord. Let's read in Psalms
[29:35] 149 if you would. And we'll just add
[29:38] this in uh just from a couple Sundays
[29:40] ago that we were speaking on. This will
[29:43] be uh just a part two of that one.
[29:45] Psalms 149. And we we won't read the
[29:49] whole chapter.
[29:52] Verse 6. Let the high praises of God be
[29:56] in their mouth and the two-edged sword
[30:00] in their hand. Heavenly Father, bless
[30:02] your word today as we minister. We give
[30:04] our gift to you and we give these
[30:06] precious lives who are listening in and
[30:08] also here. We give them back to you. You
[30:11] are their uh you are their savior. You
[30:14] are their Lord. You are their shepherd.
[30:17] Lord, you know them more than any any
[30:20] man knows them. In fact, Lord, you know
[30:23] them better than they know themselves.
[30:25] And you know what they need better than
[30:27] they even know themselves. So I pray
[30:30] dear Lord that this moment that your
[30:32] anointing would take over and that you
[30:34] would do something in our midst for the
[30:36] people's lives in Jesus name. Amen. God
[30:39] bless. You may be seated.
[30:42] Couple weeks ago I was preaching out of
[30:44] this Psalms 149 and it's a wonderful
[30:47] small chapter if you want to read it
[30:49] again. But when all the musicians and
[30:51] singers were here, we were ministering
[30:53] this scripture and talking about the
[30:55] high praises of God. And uh we were
[30:58] bringing to that particular service. We
[31:01] were bringing that worship in this has
[31:04] seemed to reach its highest form. And
[31:06] when worship has reached is how many
[31:09] know that worship is not just singing in
[31:11] church but it's our life and worship
[31:15] reaches its highest form. I believe in
[31:18] this Psalms 149 because it speaks of a
[31:21] people. In fact, I would say that it's
[31:24] prophetic because it speaks of a people
[31:27] with a sword in their hand and the high
[31:30] praises of God upon their lips. And this
[31:33] high praises is the only place it's
[31:36] mentioned in scripture, the high praises
[31:38] of God. And that grabbed my attention
[31:40] because it's if it's mentioned in one
[31:42] place, then we realize it must have some
[31:45] meaning to it. Praise is mentioned many
[31:47] places, but this was a people with the
[31:50] high praises of God upon their lips. And
[31:54] it is also a people that have the sword
[31:57] in their hand. And all of us believers
[31:59] should be familiar with that because we
[32:01] are the people that have received the
[32:03] sword back into our hand. It struck the
[32:06] prophet's hand and it also has struck
[32:08] the hand of the people that we have the
[32:10] word. The sword put blank put back in
[32:12] our hands. But it's not just that we
[32:15] have the word. It's not just that we
[32:16] have the restored word, but we have the
[32:19] high praises of God upon our lips and or
[32:23] or I should say we should have the high
[32:25] praises of God upon our lips. So when I
[32:29] looked up this high praises uh we
[32:32] realized that the first meaning of it it
[32:34] means to be very exuberant. It means to
[32:38] be very joyful. It means to be very
[32:41] excited. It means to be constantly
[32:44] bragging on God. praising God, not only
[32:46] in church, but you're always praising
[32:48] God. You're always bragging on the Lord.
[32:50] You're always telling about the good
[32:52] things that he's done, and you're you're
[32:53] not afraid to talk about it to somebody
[32:55] in the store or your boss or anybody
[32:58] else. If you get the opportunity, it's
[33:00] an exuberant excitement to praise and
[33:03] put on these lips, glory to Almighty
[33:05] God. That's the high praises of God. And
[33:08] it isn't just on Sunday. It isn't just
[33:10] every year at the camp meeting, but it
[33:12] should be every day of our lives. What
[33:15] comes out of our mouth is thanksgiving
[33:17] and praise for what the Lord has done.
[33:20] It is not lukewarm praise or passive
[33:23] praise. It's not laidback, well, I'm too
[33:26] tired to do it, but it actually the high
[33:28] praises of God. It actually embodies
[33:31] itself in a body so much that you see
[33:34] the expressions of clapping your hands
[33:37] and shouting and rejoicing and saying
[33:40] amen. But I'm a shy person. But this
[33:43] high praise kind of overrides that
[33:45] shyness and says I'm feeling this. I'm
[33:48] there's tears coming down my life. God
[33:51] God has redeemed me. God has saved me.
[33:53] Can you say amen? God has done something
[33:56] for me. Can you say amen? Praise the
[33:58] Lord. Uh I I I was looking at the slides
[34:01] coming across and there's one slide
[34:03] there from one of the preachers that
[34:04] says, "Soon as a man is cleansed from
[34:07] sin, he is clothed with praise." Soon as
[34:11] a man is cleansed from sin and he's
[34:13] really been cleansed, he becomes clothed
[34:16] with high praises.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; And I believe it's not lazy. I believe
[34:20] it's not something that's lukewarm or
[34:23] it's when you feel like it. I believe
[34:25] it's something that becomes high praises
[34:27] and it is unashamed. It is an unashamed
[34:31] expression in your song, in your hands,
[34:35] in your body. It may even make you dance
[34:37] every once in a while. And I'll tell
[34:39] you, if it made David dance before
[34:42] Calvary, and it made David's cup
[34:44] overflowing, overwhelmed before Calvary,
[34:48] now after Calvary, it our cup should be
[34:51] running over.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our cup should be not not
[34:55] just full but running over. I thought
[34:57] about that the other day. I thought, you
[34:59] know what, in our lives, do we live a
[35:02] life I've got a cup, a coffee cup that
[35:04] says, "My cup runth over." I use it
[35:06] every morning, but I was looking at the
[35:08] other day, how many believers can say
[35:10] like David before Calvary, he was
[35:13] already saved, my cup is running over.
[35:18] I'll tell you friends, God has done
[35:20] mighty things. And this unashamed
[35:22] expression should be in your song. It
[35:23] should be in your hands. It should be in
[35:25] your body. Sometimes even affects our
[35:27] feet. It lets it all out for the Lord
[35:30] and has no fear to bring a vocal
[35:34] celebration upon its lips.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; And that all happens because something
[35:40] is causing it. Not because I'm uh
[35:42] forcing it this morning or I'm working
[35:44] it up.
[35:46] That happens because the revelation of
[35:48] Christ has struck your heart. And when
[35:50] revelation strikes your heart,
[35:52] stimulation is on its way.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's not working it up.
[36:03] When you have a true revelation, you get
[36:05] stimulation of revelation.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But then I was drawn to
[36:10] the other meaning of high praise, and
[36:12] that's beyond just church. uh uh while
[36:15] music is often part of high praise and
[36:19] it is music is a part of it, worship is
[36:21] a part of it, our expression at church
[36:23] and at home in music. While music is
[36:26] often a part of high praise, it's not
[36:28] limited to it. In other words, it's not
[36:30] limited to being in church. High praises
[36:33] of God on your lips is not limited to
[36:34] being in church. If this is the only
[36:36] time you sing is in church, uh shame on
[36:39] you. Our high praises belong to him
[36:41] wherever we're at, whenever we feel to
[36:44] give praises to God. If this is the only
[36:47] time you read your Bible, then shame on
[36:49] you this morning because this is not a
[36:50] Sunday morning religion. This is every
[36:53] day that we bring the high praises to
[36:55] God.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; If this is the only place you ever sing
[36:58] a song, you say, "Brother Paul, I don't
[36:59] have a gift to sing." God never made
[37:01] qualifications. You know what the
[37:03] qualification is to bring praise? That's
[37:05] if you're breathing.
[37:10] Let everything that hath breath
[37:13] &gt;&gt; check your neighbor breathe on them.
[37:15] Wait, wait a minute. Don't do that.
[37:17] Check Check it. Check your pulse. If
[37:20] you're breathing, you have no excuse.
[37:22] That is the only qualification that
[37:24] makes you a worshshiper.
[37:27] Let everything that have breath praise
[37:29] the Lord.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm just a little different. You
[37:32] know, I'm just a little different. Yeah,
[37:34] you are different. Get the high praises
[37:36] of God on your lips. Amen.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But the writer says
[37:41] here, high praise can be expressed
[37:43] through various forms of worship and
[37:46] even in daily life through actions of
[37:49] obedience and love. So it's the high
[37:52] praises of God is not just something
[37:54] upon our lips as far as songs and
[37:57] worship, but it's our life. It's our
[37:59] daily life. It's our actions of
[38:01] obedience and love. Do you know we
[38:03] worship when we're obedient to the word
[38:05] of God? Do you know we worship it and
[38:08] express ourselves back to him by what we
[38:11] what we say every day and not just what
[38:13] we say at church? Do you know that our
[38:15] obedience and our love for God and for
[38:18] other people expresses worship?
[38:22] &gt;&gt; So it raises the level of our worship
[38:25] not just at church but every day. It
[38:28] raises the quality. Here we go now and I
[38:32] told you to put your seatelt on. It
[38:34] raises the quality when you say high
[38:36] praises. It raises the quality of what's
[38:40] coming out of your mouth every day.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you're
[38:50] a a morbid complainer,
[38:54] you heard a morbid obesity,
[38:57] &gt;&gt; morbid complainer, then you haven't
[38:59] found the high praises of God.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; That's right. True.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; And if you think this is just uh this
[39:06] high praises is just singing in church
[39:08] or shouting or speaking in tongues. No.
[39:10] High praises on our mouth means letting
[39:13] our mouth be used of God for the right
[39:16] things.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; And shutting them from saying the wrong
[39:21] things.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; I'm here to make it clear. The high
[39:24] praises of God is letting your mouth be
[39:28] used of the Lord to speak the right
[39:30] things, to speak edification, to speak
[39:33] things that build up instead of tear
[39:35] down, to speak. It raises the quality of
[39:39] what's coming out of your mouth every
[39:40] day. And it shuts its mouth from all the
[39:44] rest of it. Can you say amen? I don't
[39:46] believe it's only what's coming out of
[39:48] these mouths at church that count. I
[39:50] referred to a story Wednesday night. I
[39:51] don't know if you heard it, but a man in
[39:53] front of his children prayed and he
[39:55] prayed such a wonderful prayer of
[39:57] thanksgiving for his food. But then the
[39:59] rest of the meal, he complained about
[40:00] the bread. He complained about the milk.
[40:03] He complained about the meat. He
[40:05] complained about everything. He wasn't
[40:07] thankful. And his daughter said, "Dad,
[40:09] do you think God heard you when you
[40:11] thanksgiving in your prayer?" "Of course
[40:13] he heard me. I prayed." "Did she said,
[40:15] "Did God hear you when you were
[40:17] complaining about the food that you
[40:18] thanked God for?"
[40:20] Shut up, kid. Get out of the room.
[40:24] What a sobering thing. How weird can we
[40:27] get sometimes when we get so super
[40:30] spiritual and out of the same lips can
[40:33] bring wonderful prayers of thanksgiving,
[40:36] but out of the same lips complaining,
[40:40] &gt;&gt; negative.
[40:46] I was just wondering whether I'd call it
[40:47] what my dad used to say, diarrhea of the
[40:50] mouth.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; No, I better not say that. My dad was
[40:55] only qualified to say things like that
[40:57] and get by with it.
[41:04] The third poll is tied
[41:09] to saying the right thing.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[41:15] It is also tied to the sword being in
[41:17] our hand. How many know when that hand
[41:19] that sword struck brother Brandham's
[41:20] hand and he said this is a a king sword.
[41:24] It was so beautiful. It wasn't fake. It
[41:25] wasn't a vision. It was actually a real
[41:27] sword he was holding.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; A real sword.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; And he held that. He said, "I've always
[41:32] been afraid of those things. I'm glad I
[41:34] didn't live in the days of the nights. I
[41:36] didn't want to be part of that kind of
[41:37] battle. But yet now he realizes what it
[41:39] is." And the angel said, "This is not a
[41:41] king sword. This is the king's sword.
[41:43] And he knew he it had to be the very
[41:46] word because Christ is the word. And
[41:48] it's not in heaven anymore. It's not in
[41:50] another dimension anymore. It's actually
[41:52] put into the very hand of the prophet.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; And that wasn't to stay there. It's
[41:57] supposed to be put in the hand of faith
[41:59] in the hand of his people. Can you say
[42:01] amen? And that's part he says, "What is
[42:03] this?" This is the third pole, brother
[42:06] Brandham. It's not the end of your life.
[42:08] It's the third pole. Part of the third
[42:10] pole is the sword being put into the
[42:12] hands of the people.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; And so it's tied to the sword being in
[42:19] our hand, but I don't think sons can
[42:23] come to this secret when they give
[42:25] themselves liberty with their mouth. You
[42:27] can hold the sword all day long. As a
[42:29] matter of fact, some people with this
[42:32] message and this sword, it's become
[42:34] dangerous because they're not using it
[42:36] on the enemy. They're using it on one
[42:38] another. They're using quotes on one
[42:41] another. They're using quotes to slash
[42:44] everybody else. And they're not even
[42:46] living the life sometimes. But oh, can
[42:48] they quote brother Brandham and oh, can
[42:49] they quote the scripture and it's in the
[42:51] hands of the wrong people. But I believe
[42:54] it's not just what's in our hand, it's
[42:57] what's coming out of our mouths.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; And I just feel like that the third poll
[43:03] also is tied to what we say in our
[43:05] mouth. I was up late a couple nights
[43:08] after I preached that sermon on the high
[43:10] praises of God in her mouth. And uh I
[43:13] don't know, you don't know the preacher
[43:14] side, but the preacher side is that
[43:16] you're always thinking a few days after,
[43:18] I should have said that. You left that
[43:19] out. I should have said this. Oh, I
[43:21] missed that part. Oh, and I suppose the
[43:24] sermon could have been three or four
[43:25] hours long if I'd have done all that.
[43:26] But you just look for what God wants to
[43:28] bring. But I had that for a few days.
[43:30] And uh I wasn't complete. And that's
[43:33] maybe why I'm finishing it today because
[43:35] it wasn't complete without bringing this
[43:37] home to what comes out out of our mouth
[43:40] every day outside of church
[43:45] &gt;&gt; and outside of our prayers because we're
[43:46] always respectful with our prayers. We
[43:49] learn we learn that God was listening to
[43:54] things that were said both sides of it.
[43:57] We learned something that God was
[43:59] listening and things that we wouldn't
[44:00] think he was listening in on, but he was
[44:02] listening in that little room when had
[44:05] height, someone else was in that little
[44:07] room because when Hadtie Wright said
[44:09] just the right thing, God was listening.
[44:12] God was there. God heard what she said
[44:14] and the right thing come out of her
[44:16] mouth and God was listening and he
[44:18] stepped in and said, "I'll give you
[44:20] anything you want in the name of the
[44:21] Lord. You ask it," Brother Bam says. And
[44:23] God is here now to give you anything you
[44:26] want. And it's because something was
[44:28] said. And guess what? God was listening.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Why are you saying that, brother Paul?
[44:34] Because we forget God's listening.
[44:37] &gt;&gt; We forget God is acting upon the
[44:40] confession that's coming out of our
[44:42] mouth.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Whether good or bad, God is acting upon
[44:47] the confession that's coming out of our
[44:48] mouth. And God was listening when
[44:50] Hadright said that. God was listening.
[44:52] God was in the boat when that brother
[44:54] said he said maybe we should just go
[44:57] over there and just see how they're
[44:59] doing. There was a some neighbors across
[45:00] the way across the water and they
[45:02] brother ran they're all fishing and the
[45:04] brother just says maybe we should go. We
[45:06] haven't seen him in years and just say
[45:07] hello to them. That's all he said and it
[45:09] pleased the Lord and a little fishy got
[45:12] got its life back because why? God was
[45:14] in the boat. God was listening to what
[45:16] was being said.
[45:22] But someone else was listening when the
[45:25] prophet lied about not being in the
[45:28] house.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; When the lawyer called his wife and he
[45:33] said, "Tell him I'm not here."
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Guess what?
[45:38] &gt;&gt; God was listening.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; God was displeased with what was said.
[45:44] Oh, I didn't really lie. But no,
[45:46] eventually he said, "I lied.
[45:49] I stepped outside the door, but it was a
[45:52] it was kind of a white lie.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; I love these little stories because it
[45:58] shows us that prophets aren't just up
[46:01] here somewhere floating on a cloud.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; They were human beings. All the prophets
[46:06] of the Bible were human beings. And we
[46:08] can see their humanness even in the
[46:10] Bible.
[46:12] But it doesn't take away from because
[46:14] people have capitalized on that and
[46:16] tried to destroy and try to behead what
[46:19] the prophet brought. We were watching
[46:21] that chosen thing when John the Baptist
[46:24] uh John the Baptist uh had his was
[46:27] beheaded by the woman there that
[46:29] arranged the whole thing. Had her
[46:31] daughter dance and uh my wife said, "I
[46:34] don't want to watch this part. It's too
[46:36] it's too gory for me." And I said,
[46:38] 'Well, hun, our prophet of this age gets
[46:41] beheaded all the time on the internet.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Everybody awake today.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; I said, that's nothing new. Our
[46:50] prophet's getting beheaded every day.
[46:52] Brother Brham says, you destroy a man's
[46:54] influence. That's worse. You can kill a
[46:56] man's influence. That's worse than
[46:57] shooting him with a gun. And every day,
[46:59] every moment on the internet, on social
[47:01] media, everywhere, he get our prophet of
[47:03] this age gets beheaded. And some of you
[47:05] feed on all that stuff. I don't think
[47:07] you should I think you should pull away
[47:09] from it.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen?
[47:12] &gt;&gt; I don't think it should be given credit
[47:13] to even come into your mind
[47:16] &gt;&gt; because we don't take value out of
[47:18] someone who has an agenda like that. We
[47:21] know the position. We know God has sent
[47:23] us this prophet of his age. Why does the
[47:25] devil come back? And so, you know, here
[47:27] he beheads the prophet. You know why he
[47:28] did it? Because John was the one who
[47:30] stood up and spoke out against that.
[47:32] Just like the original Eliah Elijah, he
[47:35] didn't care about what Jezebel thought.
[47:37] He's the one that spoke up against it.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; And now the same spirit of Elijah on the
[47:42] Baptist was not afraid to call the women
[47:45] out of their generation that were acting
[47:47] wrong, living in adultery, living in
[47:49] sin. It's not lawful for you to have
[47:51] her. And from that moment, you can even
[47:52] see it in the movie. From that moment,
[47:54] she set her heart to get rid of him and
[47:56] to behead him. Why? Because she didn't
[47:58] want the man of God correcting her.
[48:02] That's true.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; But God was in that room and God heard
[48:07] that little statement. God hears what's
[48:10] going on. And I wonder how many
[48:12] believers have not caught this higher
[48:14] place that he's calling us to.
[48:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:19] &gt;&gt; That God is calling an army of the last
[48:22] days with a sword in their hand and the
[48:26] right high standard for what's coming
[48:29] out of their mouth.
[48:31] Amen.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Here's the quote that I get didn't get
[48:34] to. Matter of fact, two weeks ago when I
[48:35] preached this service and I come back to
[48:39] my I I headed back home, come back in
[48:41] the bedroom. My wife, she says, "Is
[48:44] there a" She quoted this quote to me.
[48:46] She said, "You should have read this
[48:48] quote." And I said, "It was on my notes.
[48:50] I didn't get to read it. I didn't have
[48:51] time." Oh, I forgot to read that. That
[48:53] quote. She said that that sealed the
[48:55] whole thing. She goes, "I got a wife
[48:57] that's in the word of God. Jesus, remind
[48:59] me. You should have used that quote.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Here it is. Here's the secret of this.
[49:05] The Pergamist Church age. Here is the
[49:08] secret of this. The word is in the bride
[49:11] as it was in Mary. The bride has the
[49:14] same mind of Christ, for she knows what
[49:17] he wants done with the word. It's not
[49:20] just that she has the word, but she
[49:22] knows what he wants done with the word.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; That takes character. Can you say amen?
[49:27] She performs the command of the word in
[49:29] his name. For she has thus sayaeth the
[49:32] Lord. It's not just that she speaks thus
[49:34] say the Lord. She has thus sayith the
[49:36] Lord. Then the word is quickened by the
[49:38] spirit and it comes to pass like a seed
[49:41] that is planted and watered. It comes to
[49:43] a full harvest serving its purpose.
[49:46] Those in the bride do only his will. No
[49:50] one can make them do otherwise. They
[49:51] have thus sayaith the Lord or they keep
[49:54] still. Amen.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Le Fontaine standard revised version of
[49:58] that. They have thus sayith the Lord or
[50:01] they shut up.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; They have. So, so not only have they
[50:07] learned to be led of the Lord to speak
[50:09] the word at the right time, but they're
[50:11] led of the Lord to shut up when it's not
[50:14] the right time. I shouldn't be getting
[50:16] more amens than this. It's kind of a
[50:17] solemn service, but it's not just
[50:19] growing and we're thus sayeth the Lord.
[50:21] We're going to speak the word. We're
[50:22] going to speak this. And I I believe
[50:24] this is the hour we live in. But it's
[50:26] not just that she has I say the Lord.
[50:28] She'll have it or she'll keep still.
[50:31] They know that it has to be God in them
[50:34] doing the works, fulfilling his own
[50:36] word. He did not complete all his work
[50:38] while he was on his Listen to this now.
[50:40] He did not complete all of his work
[50:41] while he was in his earthly ministry. So
[50:43] now he works in and through the bride.
[50:46] Did you hear what he said? Jesus didn't
[50:49] complete all of his works, but he's
[50:51] going to complete it in the bride of
[50:53] Christ.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; He did not complete all his work while
[50:59] he was his earthly ministry. So now he
[51:01] works in and through the bride. She
[51:03] knows that for it was not yet time for
[51:05] him to do certain things that he must
[51:07] now do. But he will now fulfill through
[51:11] the bride that works which he left for
[51:14] this specific time. The bride knows when
[51:17] to speak and knows when to shut up. She
[51:19] will have the right things or keep
[51:21] still. She will learn when to stand
[51:23] still and when to wait. She'll know when
[51:26] to speak and when to go forward. Can you
[51:28] say amen? You know, brother, the the the
[51:31] messenger of the age was preaching to
[51:33] sons in the end time. And he preached
[51:36] why cry, speak, and go forward. But he
[51:38] also preached Paul a prisoner. I want
[51:40] you to just catch these services now. He
[51:43] preached, "Speak to adopted sons. Why
[51:46] cry? Speak and go forward." But that's
[51:48] not the only thing he preached. He
[51:50] preached Paul a prisoner, which meant
[51:52] that sons of God are learning when to
[51:54] speak and not when to speak. And they're
[51:56] submissive to the will of God.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; He preached once more, Lord, Samson.
[52:02] Once more, Lord, work through me. But he
[52:05] also preached, "Is your life worthy of
[52:07] the gospel?" Yes.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; He preached possessing the enemy's
[52:10] gates. But he also preached humble
[52:13] thyself.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; He preached paradox where he said Joshua
[52:17] said, "Son, stand still." There was no
[52:20] Bible for it, but he needed it. And a
[52:22] son of God, adoption now, spoke and
[52:24] said, "I have needed this. Son, stand
[52:26] still." That's what he preached in
[52:28] paradox. But he also preached, "Lean not
[52:31] to thine own understanding."
[52:34] You see how God is teaching sons of God
[52:36] at the end time that it's got to be
[52:38] both. It's not just this power, but it's
[52:41] this silence behind the power that
[52:44] you're willing to be silent when it's
[52:45] time to be silent.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Because before he said, "Why cry? Speak
[52:51] and go forward." He said, "Stand still
[52:54] and see the glory of God."
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He preached spoken word as
[52:59] the original seed. But he also preached
[53:02] the seed of discrepancy.
[53:05] All that was about the seed. Word coming
[53:07] out of the mouth is that God actually
[53:09] speaks it through a prophet and it's the
[53:10] original seed coming from what's being
[53:12] said. But he also preached that words
[53:14] said are the seed or words of
[53:16] discrepancy.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; It comes through words. It's all backed
[53:22] up by the Bible. Everything the prophet
[53:23] preached here in those sermons is all
[53:25] backed up the Bible. I'll remind you of
[53:27] one verse among many that backs all this
[53:29] up and it simply says, "Death and life
[53:32] are both in the power of the tongue."
[53:35] Can I get an amen this morning? Death
[53:38] and life are in the power of the tongue.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; A person was honored once with an award.
[53:48] They knew 10 languages fluently and so
[53:51] they were being awarded. But the honor
[53:54] was not just that they knew 10 languages
[53:56] fluently, but the award was also that
[53:59] this person knew when to be silent in
[54:02] all 10.
[54:08] And while I was ministering on the sword
[54:10] and the hand, and the pie prays on the
[54:12] tongue, I mentioned some places where
[54:14] the worship was not striking it just
[54:17] right with God. I went from from Cain
[54:20] worship all the way through and
[54:22] mentioned some places where the people
[54:24] were worshiping. They were sincere.
[54:26] Sometimes they were very sincere. Uh
[54:29] sometimes uh that they weren't sincere,
[54:32] but there were elements missing in the
[54:33] worship. And when the elements were
[54:35] missing in in Cain, he was missing
[54:37] blood. He was missing a revelation. He
[54:38] was missing sacrifice. And we think that
[54:41] we're oh, it's worship. It's sincere.
[54:43] It's to God. So we God just accepts it.
[54:45] Not always because God would like to
[54:47] strike just the right type of
[54:49] worshippers, especially at the end time,
[54:51] who worship him in spirit and in truth.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus said to the woman at the well,
[54:57] there'll come a day, there's an hour
[54:59] coming when the true worshippers will
[55:01] worship him in spirit and in truth. It
[55:03] won't be missing the spirit and it won't
[55:05] be missing the word. At the end time,
[55:07] they'll have it both together. And I
[55:09] want to be one of those true
[55:10] worshippers. Can you say amen? If you
[55:12] want to know who I am, I'm not Paul Leaf
[55:14] Fontaine that has a gift to sing. I'm
[55:16] not Paula Fontaine has a gift to preach.
[55:18] You know who I am? I'm one of those true
[55:21] worshippers at the end time. And whether
[55:23] I could sing or preach, I want to be one
[55:24] of those true worshippers.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; I want you to see it in my life. I don't
[55:29] want you to see it at church. I want my
[55:31] grandchildren to see what I'm excited
[55:33] about in life. And it's not about
[55:35] things. It's about bringing worship in
[55:37] my life to this God. That's what I want
[55:39] them to see. I'm not all these other
[55:41] things. I'm a true worshshiper of God.
[55:43] How many want to be a true worshshiper
[55:45] of God?
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Half of you. Well, praise the Lord.
[55:48] Maybe we can keep preaching and you
[55:50] desire to be what Jesus said. I want to
[55:53] be one of those true worshippers that he
[55:55] prophesied about.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; To worship him in spirit and truth. So
[55:59] sometimes the worship didn't strike
[56:01] right to just bring pleasure to God
[56:04] because there were elements missing. But
[56:06] then I mentioned a a couple times where
[56:10] it struck just right. I brought up the
[56:12] temple and somehow all the elements were
[56:14] there and it struck just right to bring
[56:16] pleasure to God. And you know what
[56:18] happened? All the instruments were in
[56:20] order. All the worshippers were in
[56:22] order. All the dedication, the
[56:23] consecration, everything was in
[56:25] perfectly in order. And there was such a
[56:27] heart in the people just to step back
[56:29] and just worship their God. And it
[56:31] struck just the right thing to the glory
[56:34] filled the temple. And the preacher
[56:36] couldn't even preach. It struck just the
[56:38] right worship.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; But I didn't get to Jericho
[56:48] because in Jericho
[56:50] something struck just right.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Because this
[56:56] this city that God had given him was
[56:58] walled with walls that were so thick
[57:00] that they could have chariot races
[57:02] around it. That's a pretty thick wall.
[57:05] And it was impossible to overcome
[57:06] something like this. And the power in
[57:10] this army on the seventh day when they
[57:14] shouted on the seventh day when they
[57:17] shouted the walls shook and the walls
[57:21] crumbled and they walked right in and
[57:24] took the enemy.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; But the mystery
[57:29] of the power
[57:32] was not just in the shout. It's true.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; The mystery of power is not just in
[57:40] noise.
[57:44] I know that's pushed a lot in some of
[57:46] our ranks,
[57:48] &gt;&gt; but you're if you're pushing just noise
[57:51] and you're working it up and you're
[57:54] working up the shout,
[57:56] missing the other elements,
[58:00] &gt;&gt; then you're missing the mystery
[58:02] &gt;&gt; of what the third pole will do.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; I mean that very respectfully. But
[58:08] listen, don't miss the scriptural
[58:10] patterns because for six days there was
[58:14] six days of absolute silence
[58:18] something happened where God was pleased
[58:21] and the right thing came together. The
[58:24] right shout came together.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Catch this now. The re the ratio is six
[58:30] days of silence to one moment of
[58:32] shouting.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:35] Right.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to sit and enjoy that a
[58:37] minute
[58:39] &gt;&gt; because I feel like in some of our
[58:42] circles
[58:43] that racial is not there.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Silence isn't emphasized at all.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Silence makes people nervous that
[58:51] they've got to we got to say something.
[58:53] You ever have somebody that in a
[58:54] conversation in the you have the what is
[58:57] it the 30 second l?
[59:01] Is it 30 seconds or five minutes?
[59:05] It's okay. You can, you don't have to be
[59:06] silent. You can say it.
[59:10] There's a law in the conversation and
[59:11] somebody's just got to say something and
[59:13] then they usually say something stupid
[59:16] because they can't handle the silence.
[59:19] Somebody's telling about someone a few
[59:21] weeks ago. It's like they just got to
[59:22] say something, you know, well, we should
[59:24] do this, we should do that. Just, you
[59:26] know, it's okay if nobody has something
[59:29] to say.
[59:35] Tina, that's a quotable quote. Put that
[59:37] out. Put it on your refrigerator.
[59:40] It's okay if nobody has something to
[59:43] say.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; But you've been in that kind.
[59:46] They just blurt something out. And
[59:48] sometimes, you know, it doesn't even
[59:50] have time. They just think it and it
[59:53] quickly goes and spills right out their
[59:56] mouth. They didn't let their heart
[59:57] ponder it. They didn't use any
[59:59] discernment of the Holy Ghost. They
[1:00:01] thought it and it spilled right out and
[1:00:03] they said it. I can't believe you just
[1:00:05] said that.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Six days. The ratio is six days of
[1:00:11] silence to one moment of shouting.
[1:00:14] It sure seems like some groups got a
[1:00:17] real imbalance in the ratios,
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; The ratio is way the other way and
[1:00:26] actually eliminating the obedience in
[1:00:29] being silent. silent for six days.
[1:00:32] That's not even in the scenario.
[1:00:35] And to believe that the victory
[1:00:38] came only because of the shout
[1:00:42] to believe that the victory came only
[1:00:44] because of the shout is not sound
[1:00:46] doctrine.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; The obedience of seven days of God's
[1:00:52] people to follow God's orders, that's
[1:00:56] what gave power for the shout.
[1:00:59] [Applause]
[1:01:01] The silence for the first six days was a
[1:01:05] test of faith and obedience.
[1:01:08] Maybe this is why God did it because he
[1:01:10] had already given him the city. Most of
[1:01:12] us would be saying, "Glory be to God.
[1:01:15] Let's have a shout. Let the horns blast.
[1:01:17] Let the rams horns blast. Let's get the
[1:01:20] ark going. Let's go get it." Maybe he
[1:01:23] was testing their obedience. No, we're
[1:01:25] not going to get it for seven days. And
[1:01:27] for six days in your tents and
[1:01:29] everywhere, everybody does not utter one
[1:01:32] word.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; You know, listen, friends, I don't know
[1:01:37] how that was accomplished. I do not know
[1:01:39] how it happened. If they were human
[1:01:41] beings like you are and I am, I do not
[1:01:44] know except for this incredible respect
[1:01:48] for Joshua, who's the type of the Holy
[1:01:50] Ghost, and respect for God and respect
[1:01:53] for his strategy for victory.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; And enough people saying, "If that's
[1:02:01] what God said, that's the strategy for
[1:02:04] battle and victory. That's what we're
[1:02:06] doing." And for six days, I don't know
[1:02:07] how they did it. They were human beings.
[1:02:10] Human beings can't shut their mouth.
[1:02:12] They give themselves permission to say
[1:02:13] whatever they want to say whenever they
[1:02:15] want to say it. Human beings are like
[1:02:17] little two-year-olds who say whatever
[1:02:19] they want to say whenever they want to
[1:02:21] say it.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; But if we're going into adoption, we're
[1:02:26] saying, "Lord, get control of this
[1:02:27] tongue."
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; That only edification would come out of
[1:02:32] it.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; And not just in church, but on an
[1:02:35] everyday basis.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:44] It was a test ensuring that the people
[1:02:47] did not voice any doubts about the
[1:02:49] effectiveness of God's strategy. That's
[1:02:51] what one Christian writer said. That's
[1:02:53] not my own words, but I like it. He was
[1:02:55] God was ensuring that the people did not
[1:02:57] voice any doubts about the effectiveness
[1:03:00] of God's strategy. No unbelief, no
[1:03:02] doubts, no question. Why? Why do we have
[1:03:04] to do it that way? Well, that's the
[1:03:06] craziest things. God always gives us
[1:03:07] God's already given us the the city. Uh
[1:03:10] you know uh what's the test? The test is
[1:03:12] whether we can hold our tongue from
[1:03:14] complaining and giving our own opinion
[1:03:17] to God's orders.
[1:03:22] Why can't we take the city now? Joshua
[1:03:25] God said Jericho is is ours. Let's go.
[1:03:28] Why am I holding this trumpet and I
[1:03:30] can't use it?
[1:03:34] You better use your trumpet when God
[1:03:35] says to use it.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; And you better use it for God.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; And you better use it in harmony with
[1:03:41] the Holy Ghost anointing.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; You better use your gift in the will in
[1:03:47] the channel of the word of God or it'll
[1:03:49] get out of the word of God and you think
[1:03:51] it's worship and beneficial, but you
[1:03:53] better keep your gift in the channel of
[1:03:55] holiness in the channel of God and the
[1:03:57] way he wants to use your gift. Can't get
[1:03:59] enough amens this morning. I believe
[1:04:01] this is the truth. Come on, Joshua.
[1:04:03] Let's go take it. You know, Joshua, I
[1:04:05] think it's the devil on the preachers
[1:04:07] holding the people back from shouting.
[1:04:11] It's the devil speaking in your ear,
[1:04:13] saying not to get up and shout right
[1:04:15] now. Don't quench the spirit, Joshua.
[1:04:17] Now's the time to shout. No, it's not
[1:04:20] time right now. It's time to wait till
[1:04:22] God brings us in a certain place. And
[1:04:24] you never have to legislate the shout.
[1:04:27] God will say, "Now let out a shout and
[1:04:29] the walls of Jericho will come down."
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Don't quench the spirit, Joshua. Don't
[1:04:36] quench the spirit, you icicle preachers.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; And brothers like that are completely
[1:04:45] missing the mystery of the seventh seal.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; Completely missing it.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; There's one verse for the seventh seal.
[1:04:54] in Revelations 8:1.
[1:04:56] And there was silence in heaven
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; for the space of about a half hour.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; That's the seventh seal.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal, there's no symbolism
[1:05:10] for it. There's nothing said of it. And
[1:05:11] brother Bram says because he wouldn't
[1:05:12] give anything out to let Satan
[1:05:14] impersonate it. That means Satan can
[1:05:16] impersonate every gift. Satan can per
[1:05:18] imp impersonate. Satan can use gifted
[1:05:21] people. Satan could do all of this in
[1:05:23] the realms, but it's time for not just
[1:05:25] to be dwelling in the gifts. This is
[1:05:28] different. Satan will not impersonate
[1:05:30] it. And that's why heaven is silent.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; For a space of time.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; And when heaven's silent for a space of
[1:05:40] time, then the the the the thing people
[1:05:43] try to do is we got to make something up
[1:05:45] here on the seventh seal. We got to come
[1:05:48] up with something because it's been too
[1:05:50] long. Moses, you're taking too long to
[1:05:52] come out of the mountain. We're going to
[1:05:54] have to build a calf.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; We got to build an image up. We got to
[1:05:58] do something. And they got shouting and
[1:05:59] rejoicing because Moses took too long to
[1:06:02] bring the word from the mountain.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; And every time man gets in trouble,
[1:06:07] every time, you know, uh Miriam or
[1:06:10] excuse me, Hagar, Abraham, would you
[1:06:13] take my my servant Hagar? And maybe God
[1:06:15] meant for the promise to come through
[1:06:17] her. It's we're always trying. And so
[1:06:19] under the seventh seal, the ultimate
[1:06:21] thing of the coming of the Lord, he
[1:06:23] says, "Leave it alone. Don't touch it.
[1:06:25] Don't mess with it. And just trust God
[1:06:28] in the silence." And I guarantee you
[1:06:32] when this comes to its culmination
[1:06:34] through an obedient people, you will not
[1:06:38] have to work it up in any camp meeting.
[1:06:40] Can you say amen? It'll be his people
[1:06:43] that are obedient to the word.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; And there'll be a final shout. Can you
[1:06:47] say amen? And I believe there'll be a
[1:06:50] body change and we'll get out of here.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; That's the kind of power this seven seal
[1:06:54] is bringing to the people.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; But it was marked by silence.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Silence for six days.
[1:07:04] People get nervous when it's silent. Let
[1:07:06] me skip some of this and for my time
[1:07:08] this morning. Are you still with me?
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How many sermons in
[1:07:13] Pentecost took this text of the walls of
[1:07:16] Jericho coming down after the shout? How
[1:07:19] many sermons have I heard my whole life?
[1:07:21] And every time, every time the shout was
[1:07:24] emphasized.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Never the six days of silence.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; The shout of the people brought the
[1:07:34] walls of Jericho down. We're going to
[1:07:36] raise the roof off this place. We're
[1:07:38] going to shout the walls of Jericho
[1:07:40] down. But I wonder if there's really any
[1:07:42] power there or if any walls are really
[1:07:46] coming down
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; in people's lives.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; And I wonder how many gossip are in that
[1:07:54] group. How many complainers are amongst
[1:07:57] the heavy shoutters? How many proud
[1:07:59] people? How many boasters are in the
[1:08:00] same crowd of shoutters? I'm not against
[1:08:03] shouting. I I I
[1:08:05] pray that you could we could find a
[1:08:08] shout this morning.
[1:08:12] I'm not against it. I've been amongst
[1:08:14] them. I've danced. You've seen me dance,
[1:08:16] worship the Lord. To think that I'm
[1:08:19] against this. But if you're only
[1:08:21] emphasizing the shout and say, "That's
[1:08:22] the power." I wonder sometimes if
[1:08:24] there's not really walls of Jericho
[1:08:26] coming down in people's lives and it's
[1:08:28] got gossips and complainers and proud
[1:08:30] and boasters.
[1:08:32] They can't control their tongue from the
[1:08:34] corruption and things they talk about
[1:08:36] all week for six days. But oh, on Sunday
[1:08:39] they sure shouted.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; But what came out of your mouth the rest
[1:08:44] of the week?
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; God's calling for the high praises to be
[1:08:49] in our mouth.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Another level of praise. Another level
[1:08:54] of communication.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me?
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; John Wesley is widely cited for his
[1:09:00] sermon, The Cure of Evil Speaking, in
[1:09:03] which he defines the sin of evil
[1:09:06] speaking. it's a sin and offers a method
[1:09:07] for dealing with it. The most famous
[1:09:09] antidote, however, comes from a
[1:09:11] conversation where he's responded to a
[1:09:13] woman boasting about her talent for
[1:09:16] speaking her mind.
[1:09:19] Some of you heard this, the famous
[1:09:21] antidote. A woman approached Wesley and
[1:09:23] stated she prided herself on speaking
[1:09:26] her mind, calling it her talent. And
[1:09:28] Wesley's famous reply was, "Well, ma'am,
[1:09:30] the Lord wouldn't mind if you buried
[1:09:32] that talent.
[1:09:38] And out of his sermon, the cure of evil
[1:09:40] speaking, he says, "Evil speaking is
[1:09:42] speaking evil of an absent person,
[1:09:45] relating something evil which was really
[1:09:49] done or said by one that is not present
[1:09:52] when it is related.
[1:09:56] Mhm. I'm going somewhere with this
[1:10:01] really stated
[1:10:04] person absent relating something which
[1:10:06] was really done or said by the one that
[1:10:08] is not present when it is related. It's
[1:10:09] deadly poison. Speak evil of no man in
[1:10:12] their absence. A distinguishing mark of
[1:10:14] a Methodist should be that he censures
[1:10:18] no man behind his back.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Wow. He's really saying some things even
[1:10:24] for brother Brandham.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read brother Brandham in a
[1:10:28] minute, but they're saying the same
[1:10:29] truth that believers had a problem with
[1:10:32] their mouth giving themselves permission
[1:10:34] to say negative things.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Don't you think I'm not preaching to
[1:10:38] myself this morning, but I believe God's
[1:10:40] calling us to high praises on our lips.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Interesting thing about something Paul
[1:10:47] said, and it's only 12:30. I got time
[1:10:50] here. The interesting thing about what
[1:10:52] Paul said in 1 Corinthians, he rebuked
[1:10:54] the people because they were going to
[1:10:55] court with one another. They had matters
[1:10:57] to settle between one another in the
[1:10:59] church. In this Corinthian church,
[1:11:01] wasn't that large, but they had matters
[1:11:02] to sell. They were fussing with one
[1:11:04] another about something. Couldn't get it
[1:11:05] resolved. And Paul said, "You don't even
[1:11:07] have the maturity to resolve it between
[1:11:09] yourself." And you're he was rebuking
[1:11:11] because they were going to the the the
[1:11:13] courts of the land to settle their
[1:11:15] disputes internally.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; And you know what he's saying? He's
[1:11:19] saying you are so immature that you have
[1:11:22] to get some outside source
[1:11:25] to be the maturity to settle matters. He
[1:11:28] says you should be able to be mature
[1:11:29] enough now to settle matters amongst
[1:11:32] yourself.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; But they weren't.
[1:11:36] And I find it's real interesting that
[1:11:38] people
[1:11:39] they don't even go to the worldly courts
[1:11:41] when they have something against you.
[1:11:44] They have their own court.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; It's true. in their minds and in their
[1:11:49] mouth
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; and they draw their own conviction and
[1:11:52] conclusion
[1:11:54] and they have their own court. I don't
[1:11:56] expect too many amens on this and I
[1:11:58] don't have really have it necessarily in
[1:12:00] my notes. I just feel to say it when
[1:12:02] John Wesley said that the other person's
[1:12:04] not present, he don't get a chance to
[1:12:06] defend himself.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; But you've had your own court.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; You have drawn everybody in. You are the
[1:12:13] one that has the accusation and you're
[1:12:15] the judge.
[1:12:17] You're the jury.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; You're the witness.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; You're the condemmer.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; You're the lawyer. You're everything.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; And then not only that, you draw your
[1:12:31] own conclusion. You settle on it. You
[1:12:34] bring a conviction. You bring in an
[1:12:36] indictment. You bring in a conviction.
[1:12:38] And then you put the other person in
[1:12:39] jail because I'm not going to speak to
[1:12:41] them again. And I put them in jail in my
[1:12:44] life.
[1:12:46] That's good.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; And you did it all
[1:12:49] without me being there,
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; without the person being there. Well,
[1:12:54] that's a what they call
[1:12:57] uh it's it's related to a kangaroo
[1:12:59] court.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; And a kangaroo court is an unofficial
[1:13:04] court that happens. And there's no
[1:13:07] balanced
[1:13:09] presentation there.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the other person isn't even
[1:13:13] there. And it's a kangaroo court.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; It's an unofficial. There's no balance.
[1:13:19] There's no accountability. You just
[1:13:21] conclude on that person. You say it and
[1:13:25] that is it.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; How can I say this? May God
[1:13:33] give us grace in this service this
[1:13:35] morning to grow out of this form of
[1:13:39] thinking
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; and this court that you make against
[1:13:43] people.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Let's move to the next messenger. Martin
[1:13:47] Luther said this after John Wesley.
[1:13:50] Martin Luther said it is common
[1:13:52] pinocious plague. It is a common
[1:13:54] penocious plague that everyone would
[1:13:56] rather hear evil than good about their
[1:13:58] neighbors. Even though we ourselves are
[1:14:00] evil, we cannot tolerate it when anyone
[1:14:03] speaks evil of us. Instead, we want to
[1:14:06] hear the whole world say golden things
[1:14:09] of us. Yet, we cannot bear it when
[1:14:12] someone says the best things about
[1:14:14] others.
[1:14:16] Those who are not content just to know
[1:14:19] but rush ahead and judge are called
[1:14:22] backbiters.
[1:14:25] Learning a bit of gossip about someone
[1:14:27] else, they spread it into every corner,
[1:14:30] relishing and delighting in the chance
[1:14:32] to stir up someone else's dirt like pigs
[1:14:36] that roll in the manure and root around
[1:14:38] in it with their snouts.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Now, you think I'm a hard preacher?
[1:14:43] Maybe you should have lived in the days
[1:14:44] of Luther.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; And he'll tell you what your gossip is.
[1:14:48] He'll tell you the stuff that comes out
[1:14:50] of your mouth and tell you that it's
[1:14:52] evil speaking.
[1:14:54] Paul called it in the Bible corrupt
[1:14:56] communication.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Negative communication.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; It's not edifying. It's not building up.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; It's corrupt things coming out of your
[1:15:05] mouth.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm a believer of this message. My
[1:15:07] goodness. Um, what's coming out of your
[1:15:10] mouth every day?
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; How many preachers have you tore down?
[1:15:13] Our
[1:15:22] messenger said,
[1:15:24] I'm coming to a close in a minute. If
[1:15:26] the brother you think he's a little
[1:15:28] wrong or the sister say, Lord, don't let
[1:15:31] me never have the root of bitterness
[1:15:33] springs up because it'll affect him and
[1:15:36] it'll take the Christ right out of me.
[1:15:39] that poison acids, malice and jealousy
[1:15:42] and hatred that will just take the Holy
[1:15:44] Spirit right away from you. It will run
[1:15:46] him from the tabernacle here. It'll kill
[1:15:49] the spirit of God or drive it away from
[1:15:52] here. Hurt your pastor. It'll do
[1:15:54] everything. See, don't do that.
[1:15:58] You just wax that much closer together.
[1:16:01] Take the buckle. As a brother testified,
[1:16:02] a minister here the other night about
[1:16:04] having a buckle, seeing it in the
[1:16:05] vision, just that buckles on the whole
[1:16:07] armor of God. Just pull her on. Tighten
[1:16:09] up. Move right up close to one another.
[1:16:12] Love one another. Anyhow, talk nice
[1:16:15] about one another.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Boy, this is real deep this morning.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; This is deep into the seventh seal.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Talk nice about one another. This is
[1:16:29] actually
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Never mind. Talk nice about one another.
[1:16:32] Say nice things about one another. And
[1:16:36] then God will bless you.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; How many want to be blessed?
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Say nice things about people.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Ask forgiveness if you've been saying
[1:16:53] the wrong things.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Stop doing it.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to myself. Stop doing it.
[1:16:59] Stop talking negative. Stop
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; talking trash.
[1:17:04] Another
[1:17:08] place that I pulled up late late last
[1:17:10] night. It's a strange thing that this is
[1:17:11] so much thought of people. They would
[1:17:13] say, "Well, I'm weak. My faith is not
[1:17:15] very much. I'm not a very good
[1:17:18] Christian." That's just what the devil
[1:17:19] wants you to say. So now it's not about
[1:17:21] talking down talking down other people.
[1:17:24] This is talking you down.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; It's talking you down. Well, I'm not a
[1:17:29] very good Christian. That's just what
[1:17:31] the devil wants you to say. You're just
[1:17:33] talking his language, right? Then see,
[1:17:35] you mustn't never say that. Don't never
[1:17:39] let your testimony be negative. Let it
[1:17:42] be positive all the time.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; I am saved. I have a I have God in my
[1:17:49] heart. I believe him with all my heart.
[1:17:51] Do you believe in divine healing? With
[1:17:53] all of my heart. Let your testimony
[1:17:55] always and your thoughts and everything
[1:17:57] never permit a negative thought to come
[1:18:00] in your mind. And I'm adding to that.
[1:18:02] Say, and don't let it spill out your
[1:18:04] mouth.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Never let a negative thought come in
[1:18:07] your mind. If you could help it when it
[1:18:09] starts that, don't entertain it. Well,
[1:18:11] you say, "I can't help the thoughts from
[1:18:13] coming." Well, that'd be like the farmer
[1:18:15] that said he couldn't stop the birds
[1:18:17] from flying over his place, but he could
[1:18:19] sure stop them from roosting. So, that's
[1:18:21] a good thing. You see, you can't help
[1:18:22] the thoughts when they come. But don't
[1:18:25] entertain them. Just pass it on. No,
[1:18:28] sir. Jesus Christ is my savior. All
[1:18:32] things are mine by God and I'm going to
[1:18:35] keep them.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to testify of them. And God
[1:18:43] can only bless as you confess that he
[1:18:48] has done it for you.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; God can only bless you as you confess
[1:18:55] what he has done for you. He's the high
[1:18:57] priest of our confession. Wednesday
[1:19:00] night, we'll be back into our open
[1:19:02] confession as we were this last
[1:19:03] Wednesday night. It's just interesting
[1:19:05] how the Holy Spirit's just dovetailing
[1:19:07] these things together. And I can tell
[1:19:09] you friends, it's not me. The Lord is
[1:19:12] teaching sons and daughters. The Lord
[1:19:15] loves you enough to tell you the truth.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; You go ahead and go back to your old
[1:19:19] life today if you want to, but God's
[1:19:21] calling you to a high praise on your
[1:19:23] lips. Can I get an amen? God's calling
[1:19:24] you to something higher. God's calling
[1:19:26] you something greater.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Don't be stubborn. Don't dig in your
[1:19:29] heels.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Yield yourself to the Lord.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God can only bless you
[1:19:36] as you confess that he's done for you.
[1:19:38] You see, say nice things about one
[1:19:40] another. Say good things about one
[1:19:42] another. Can you say amen?
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Desire to speak a higher dialect. A
[1:19:48] dialect is a particular form of a
[1:19:50] language that is peculiar to a specific
[1:19:53] region or or a social group. That's what
[1:19:56] dialect means. It means the language is
[1:19:59] similar except this particular dialect
[1:20:01] it's peculiar to some. You start talking
[1:20:05] positive things. Some of you starting
[1:20:08] tomorrow,
[1:20:10] how about today?
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; You're going to be very peculiar to your
[1:20:16] family.
[1:20:19] brothers, you start using this to your
[1:20:21] wife. Why don't you start there
[1:20:25] and you walk in and you say appreciative
[1:20:27] things and lovely things and nice
[1:20:30] things. Brother Bram says say nice
[1:20:31] things about one another. That didn't
[1:20:33] just mean your brother and sister. It
[1:20:35] meant your wife brothers and your your
[1:20:37] husband's sisters.
[1:20:41] You start doing it though, you're going
[1:20:42] to become very peculiar to your wife.
[1:20:45] She might faint on the floor and you
[1:20:47] have to call 911.
[1:20:52] A dialect a means a particular formal
[1:20:54] language that's peculiar to a specific
[1:20:56] region or a social group. We need to
[1:20:59] speak and brother Bram says when you
[1:21:02] talk negative you're talking the devil's
[1:21:05] dialect.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; You're speaking his language.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; When you down yourself and down other
[1:21:11] people and you've done it for countless
[1:21:13] years. Oh, you've been in the message,
[1:21:14] but your mouth is not in the message.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; You came in the message 40 years ago,
[1:21:22] but your mouth has not been baptized by
[1:21:25] the Holy Ghost yet.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; And you talk about your sicknesses. You
[1:21:29] talk about your pains. You talk about
[1:21:30] the preachers that have hurt you. You
[1:21:32] talk about your uncle that's hurt you.
[1:21:34] You talk about all everybody who's wrong
[1:21:35] in your life. And you sit home and do
[1:21:37] it. And you you haven't let this message
[1:21:40] get a hold of your tongue yet. Very
[1:21:44] good.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Excuse me for being straight this
[1:21:47] morning. And I'll say it again. I'm
[1:21:48] preaching to myself just like I'm
[1:21:50] preaching to you. But we need to speak
[1:21:52] God's dialect. How many want to speak
[1:21:55] God's dialect?
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going to issue a challenge as I
[1:21:58] close this service because I don't like
[1:22:00] the fact that we, you know, just come
[1:22:02] and hear a sermon. And I know the Holy
[1:22:04] Spirit has to do his work, but starting
[1:22:06] tomorrow because it's the 1 of
[1:22:08] September. Starting tomorrow, I'm going
[1:22:10] to challenge this congregation. A whole
[1:22:13] month of not one negative thing coming
[1:22:16] out of our mouth.
[1:22:19] [Applause]
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; You can start today if you want. I'm
[1:22:28] starting tomorrow
[1:22:34] cuz I want to get out all that stuff
[1:22:36] that No, just kidding.
[1:22:40] No, the Holy Spirit's leading you. Start
[1:22:42] right now.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; A month of No, you say, "Well, a month
[1:22:47] and then can we say whatever we want
[1:22:49] to?" I'm challenging because I think
[1:22:51] this is going to change more than what
[1:22:53] you realize.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; I think this is going to create
[1:22:56] atmospheres that you've never dreamed
[1:22:58] you'd see in domestic life, in family
[1:23:00] life, in whatever it is. It's going to
[1:23:03] change it. Your negative hasn't changed
[1:23:05] things,
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; You're still the same. In some ways,
[1:23:08] you're still the same way you were. So,
[1:23:09] your negative confession hasn't changed.
[1:23:11] But you watch the power on your tongue
[1:23:12] of life
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; and you watch it change things.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Talk nice about every person, say nice
[1:23:21] things about them and and to them.
[1:23:25] And that includes everybody. It includes
[1:23:27] your homes.
[1:23:29] A whole month of not speaking one thing
[1:23:32] negative. And when you do speak
[1:23:34] something negative,
[1:23:36] give $50 donation to the church for the
[1:23:39] air conditioning.
[1:23:41] You know, I wouldn't do that.
[1:23:46] It sounds like a little kid. That sounds
[1:23:48] like a kid. You put a dollar in the in
[1:23:50] the bank when you said something wrong.
[1:23:55] A month includes everybody. Includes
[1:23:57] your homes. It includes in your car. It
[1:24:00] includes your co-workers. It includes
[1:24:02] your boss. It includes your wives. It
[1:24:05] includes your husbands. It includes your
[1:24:08] kids,
[1:24:10] your extended family.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; It includes your past.
[1:24:18] Don't say one negative thing about your
[1:24:20] past.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; Draw out of it what you learned from
[1:24:26] your past and speak positive what you
[1:24:28] learned.
[1:24:32] Bringing me back to you.
[1:24:36] Keeps bringing me back to you. What are
[1:24:38] you doing, Brother Paul? I'm singing a
[1:24:40] song from Brother Jack Duff's new album.
[1:24:43] My trials keep bringing me back to you.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Bringing me back to you. That's a That's
[1:24:52] a sign, Kenny, for you to come to the
[1:24:54] piano.
[1:24:56] Not even subtle.
[1:24:58] He keeps bringing me back to you. I'll
[1:25:02] not complain about my worry and pain cuz
[1:25:05] it keeps bringing me back to you.
[1:25:08] Bringing me back to you is what the
[1:25:11] Lord's trying to do.
[1:25:14] I don't know the rest of the words to
[1:25:16] this song, but I was playing it this
[1:25:19] morning in my room.
[1:25:21] [Music]
[1:25:28] It's for co-workers. It's for boss. I'm
[1:25:31] not even going to ask of a show of hands
[1:25:33] because I don't believe in making vows.
[1:25:36] I think we need to trust the Holy Ghost
[1:25:38] in our lives.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; But there's a certain there's a certain
[1:25:41] discipline we say, God, I really want to
[1:25:44] do this and I want to see the potential
[1:25:45] of what it could be.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; So, I don't want to raise a show of
[1:25:49] hands, but in your heart, I'm going to
[1:25:51] do this for a month and I'm going to see
[1:25:52] what the Lord will do. Not one negative,
[1:25:56] only edifying that comes out of your
[1:25:58] mouth. I know you kids, you parents got
[1:26:00] to discipline your kids.
[1:26:03] But don't add to it pronouncing doom on
[1:26:06] their whole life because they made a
[1:26:07] mistake.
[1:26:09] You never get things right. You never
[1:26:11] You'll never be anything. No, no, no,
[1:26:13] no. That's negative. Correct them. Tell
[1:26:15] them what they did wrong. That's not
[1:26:16] what I'm talking about. I'm talking
[1:26:18] about stuff that comes out that's not
[1:26:19] edifying.
[1:26:21] your boss, your wives, your kids, your
[1:26:22] extended family, your past. Because your
[1:26:25] past, you keep bringing it up and keep
[1:26:27] reliving it.
[1:26:29] Joseph said all the bad that his
[1:26:31] brothers did to him, he says God meant
[1:26:34] it for good.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; This is the only way for those who seek
[1:26:41] high praises upon their mouth, higher
[1:26:44] ground.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:49] I desire to speak a higher dialect.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Your past is meant to bring you back
[1:26:56] closer to him. Bringing me back to you.
[1:26:59] I don't know the words. You know them.
[1:27:02] Bringing me back to you.
[1:27:06] I'll not complain about my worries and
[1:27:09] pain cuz they keep bringing me back to
[1:27:12] you.
[1:27:14] Oh, bringing me back to you.
[1:27:18] is what the thing's supposed to do.
[1:27:23] Da da da da da da da. Because it keeps
[1:27:27] bringing me back to you.
[1:27:31] None of them know it e either. None of
[1:27:34] them know. Nobody knows it, you know. Uh
[1:27:36] and they recorded it in the studio and
[1:27:38] they still don't know any.
[1:27:40] But I know a good one. Lord, lift me up
[1:27:43] to higher ground. Can we stand together?
[1:27:47] Lord, lift me up
[1:27:52] and let me stand
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:27:57] by faith on heaven.
[1:28:02] Table land

[1:28:10] than I have found.

[1:28:17] our lips high ground.
[1:28:21] Lord, lift me up.

[1:28:39] a higher place
[1:28:43] that I have found.
[1:28:47] Lord my feet on higher
[1:28:51] ground walk.
[1:28:54] I'm pressing on
[1:28:57] [Music]
[1:28:58] the upward that high calling in Jesus
[1:29:01] Christ. New heights and gain
[1:29:06] gaining every day.
[1:29:10] Still praying as

[1:29:23] ground.
[1:29:24] High praises Lord. Lift me up
[1:29:28] [Music]
[1:29:30] and let me stand
[1:29:32] [Music]
[1:29:35] on heaven.
[1:29:38] [Music]
[1:29:41] Oh, a higher place
[1:29:46] than I have found.
[1:29:50] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:29:54] ground.
[1:29:56] Listen to this. My heart has no
[1:30:01] desire. This should be our desire this
[1:30:03] morning.
[1:30:05] Where doubts arise
[1:30:09] and fears dismay.
[1:30:13] Though others may dwell,
[1:30:16] where all this abounds, he's abound.
[1:30:21] My prayer, it's a different dialect. I'm
[1:30:24] looking for higher ground. Oh Lord, lift
[1:30:29] me up
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:32] and let me stand
[1:30:36] by faith on heaven.
[1:30:40] Table
[1:30:43] of a higher place
[1:30:47] than I have found.
[1:30:51] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:30:56] ground.
[1:30:57] [Music]
[1:30:58] I want to live
[1:31:02] above the world.
[1:31:06] Though Satan thought
[1:31:10] and me are heard,
[1:31:14] for faith has caught
[1:31:18] the joyful sound. Yes.
[1:31:21] The song of saints on higher
[1:31:26] ground. Sing it now with all your heart.
[1:31:28] Lord, lift me up.
[1:31:32] Raise me Lord in the power of your
[1:31:33] resurrection.
[1:31:36] Raise my lips in the power of your
[1:31:37] resurrection. Lord,
[1:31:39] [Music]
[1:31:43] oh a higher place
[1:31:48] than I have found.
[1:31:51] Lord plant my feet on my
[1:31:56] ground. Last verse I believe. I want to
[1:31:59] scare
[1:32:02] the most high.
[1:32:05] Oh Jesus.
[1:32:08] Yes. Of glory.
[1:32:13] Still I pray
[1:32:17] till heaven I found.
[1:32:20] Lord lead me on to higher
[1:32:25] ground.
[1:32:27] Lord lift me up
[1:32:31] and let me stand
[1:32:35] by faith on heaven
[1:32:39] table.
[1:32:42] a higher place
[1:32:45] [Music]
[1:32:46] than I have found.
[1:32:50] Lord, plant my feet on higher
[1:32:54] ground.
[1:32:57] Can we ask the Lord to help us? Heavenly
[1:32:59] Father, you've presented something to us
[1:33:02] this morning. Some of it, Lord, I've
[1:33:05] never pondered as deeply as this. And
[1:33:06] how important it is that the high
[1:33:09] praises of God
[1:33:11] be upon my lips, not just when I'm
[1:33:14] preaching, Lord, Lord, you anoint us,
[1:33:17] Father, and we're able to yield to the
[1:33:20] gift and you're able to say wonderful
[1:33:21] things. Sometimes, Lord, I admire the
[1:33:24] things that you bring through me, Lord,
[1:33:26] as not my own, but what you brought
[1:33:28] through me.
[1:33:29] But it's on an everyday basis, Lord,
[1:33:31] that we give oursel permission to speak
[1:33:33] anything out of these lips. And Lord, if
[1:33:35] our body belongs to you, then our lips
[1:33:37] belong to you as well.
[1:33:40] Forgive us, Lord. Cleanse us. Purge us
[1:33:44] of this urge and this thing that we give
[1:33:47] oursel permission to do. Lord, I've
[1:33:50] offered a challenge to me and the
[1:33:52] church, and I have to live it first.
[1:33:53] Lord, give me grace. Help me. And if we
[1:33:56] fail, Lord, we'll bring our repentance
[1:33:58] to you and get right back on track.
[1:34:01] [Music]
[1:34:03] Lord, help us and give us strength in
[1:34:04] this challenge, Lord, to direct our
[1:34:07] tongues and direct what we say, to be
[1:34:10] silent when we need to be silent and
[1:34:13] only speak when there's words of
[1:34:15] edification to be offered.
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:20] A word fitly spoken is like apples of
[1:34:23] gold and pictures of silver.
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:27] So may we have words that are fitly
[1:34:29] spoken, that are thought through.
[1:34:32] Granted, Father, we pray. We love you
[1:34:34] for your correction. We love you for
[1:34:37] your encouragement.
[1:34:38] Come near us, Lord, as we draw near to
[1:34:41] you. Thank you, Jesus. And we ask these
[1:34:45] things in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. I want
[1:34:49] you to turn to somebody and tell them
[1:34:51] something encouraging right now.
[1:34:58] [Music]
[1:35:02] We're starting right now. Starting not
[1:35:04] tomorrow. Starting right now. Tell them
[1:35:06] something encouraging. As embarrassing
[1:35:08] it as it is.
[1:35:09] [Music]
[1:35:16] Everybody saying, "God bless you."
[1:35:17] That's encouraging enough right now. I
[1:35:18] can't think of anything.
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:23] You know, one time we had a youth
[1:35:24] meeting years ago and I challenged the
[1:35:26] young people to look to the person next
[1:35:28] to them and write out things that they
[1:35:30] seen strengths in their lives and they
[1:35:33] did that. You talk about the Holy Spirit
[1:35:35] coming down in a special way. And just
[1:35:37] that other person hearing it from
[1:35:38] another believer, that's really what you
[1:35:40] feel about me. That's you see my
[1:35:41] strength sometimes better than I see in
[1:35:43] myself. It's an encouraging thing. It's
[1:35:45] a strengthening thing. Amen. So, if you
[1:35:48] go and say that to somebody today,
[1:35:50] that'd be wonderful. We'd appreciate it.
[1:35:52] God bless you as you're dismissed in
[1:35:54] Christian love. If anyone needs prayer
[1:35:56] for a need or sickness, we're
[1:35:58] remembering brothers and sisters in
[1:36:00] need. Sister Emily will continue to
[1:36:03] remember the prayer requests that come
[1:36:04] through uh this week, this Wednesday
[1:36:06] night, and also over the pulpit this
[1:36:08] morning. Remember all them if you would
[1:36:09] take them home with you uh and remember
[1:36:12] those. Uh people depend on your prayers.
[1:36:14] when we put that out on Telegram or read
[1:36:17] it, they they say it because they know
[1:36:19] this congregation will go to prayer for
[1:36:20] them. Bring it before the Lord. Amen.
[1:36:23] God bless you all in Christian love.
[1:36:25] Lord, lift me up. Come on, brother
[1:36:28] Michael. And let me stand
[1:36:33] by faith on heaven.
