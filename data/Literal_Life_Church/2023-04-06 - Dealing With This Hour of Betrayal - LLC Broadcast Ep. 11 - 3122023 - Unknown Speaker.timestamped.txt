[4:10] in Jesus
[4:13] name
[4:15] Matthew 24 chapter 24 and verse 3.
[4:21] and as he sat upon the Mount of Olives
[4:23] the disciples came unto him privately
[4:26] saying tell us when shall these things
[4:28] be what shall be the sign of thy coming
[4:31] and of the end of the world so there's
[4:33] three questions there
[4:35] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[4:37] take heed that no man deceive you for
[4:40] many shall come in my name saying I am
[4:43] Christ and shall deceive many so one of
[4:46] the signs of the end time is deception
[4:48] and deception that is so close it looks
[4:50] like the real thing it looks like an
[4:52] anointed one Christ is means the
[4:54] anointed one and so one of the signs of
[4:56] the end time is real real bad deception
[5:00] deception that so closely looks like the
[5:03] real thing here's some more signs of
[5:04] verse six ye shall hear of wars and
[5:07] rumors of wars see that ye be not
[5:10] troubled for all these things must come
[5:12] to pass but the end is not yet we've
[5:15] seen wars and rumors of wars since World
[5:17] War one all the way through for many
[5:19] years now the last hundred years or more
[5:21] we've seen a lot of wars and it's
[5:24] interesting Jesus says here be not see
[5:26] that you be not troubled we really
[5:29] shouldn't be troubled over that it's
[5:30] supposed to come especially when we know
[5:33] we're safe within the arms of Christ and
[5:36] living in the Rock can you say Amen we
[5:38] have a safe haven from the rumors of
[5:41] wars and the wars that actually may be
[5:43] closing in us on us even more he said
[5:46] don't be troubled about that verse 7
[5:48] said for nation shall rise against
[5:50] nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and
[5:52] there shall be famines and pestilences
[5:55] and earthquakes and in many places
[5:58] diverse places I want you to notice us
[6:01] these signs of the end time first
[6:02] mentioned here are external pressures
[6:05] there are things that happen you see in
[6:07] the news
[6:08] sometimes we're affected by a war
[6:10] sometimes we see those things but
[6:12] especially here in America and different
[6:14] places we haven't been directly affected
[6:16] we've had earthquakes and diver places
[6:18] we've had pestilences but still kind of
[6:21] not completely affected like a lot of
[6:24] people are but that's all external
[6:26] pressures that's external signs but
[6:29] watch as it turns over here if you would
[6:31] to verse eight Watch what it does now
[6:33] all these are the beginning of Sorrows
[6:36] then shall they deliver you up to be
[6:40] afflicted and shall kill you and ye
[6:42] shall be hated of all Nations for my
[6:46] name's sake I want you to notice now it
[6:48] turns from an external pressure to a
[6:51] very personal pressure that you're going
[6:52] to be hated
[6:54] it's going to be a pressure personally
[6:56] towards you now you're going to be
[6:58] persecuted for his namesake so now it's
[7:01] one thing to look out and read the news
[7:03] and see and hear oh the signs of the end
[7:05] time and it's external it's another
[7:07] thing when it turns internal
[7:09] becomes personal and it goes deeper it
[7:12] says they shall deliver you up to be
[7:14] afflicted and shall kill you you should
[7:15] be hated to All Nations for my namesake
[7:17] watch how much closer I get and then
[7:19] shall many be offended and shall betray
[7:24] one another and shall hate one another
[7:26] and many false prophets shall rise and
[7:30] deceive many so now it's moving closer
[7:33] in my subject again tonight of betrayal
[7:35] it'll be an hour it'll be a time of
[7:38] betrayal it says many shall betray one
[7:40] another many are going to be offended
[7:43] and many will hate none so it's a time
[7:46] of offense it's a time of betrayal it's
[7:49] a time of just outright hatred of one
[7:51] another
[7:52] and those are signs of the end time if
[7:56] we see that intensifying we're close to
[7:59] the end
[8:01] but tonight I don't want to talk about
[8:03] we see these things happening and
[8:04] intensifies War it's not so much they're
[8:06] happening we know they're happening and
[8:08] the hatred becomes no more intense it's
[8:11] not about that it's about how do we
[8:12] respond to it
[8:14] how do we respond to it and many false
[8:18] prophets shall rise and shall receive
[8:19] many look at this verse 12 and because
[8:22] iniquity iniquity is knowing to do good
[8:25] and not doing it iniquity sins shall
[8:28] abound it'll increase it'll get more
[8:30] because of that the love of many shall
[8:35] wax cold
[8:37] signs of the end time
[8:39] betrayal it's one thing to talk about
[8:42] wars
[8:44] signs are betrayal signs are people
[8:46] being offended
[8:48] signs are false prophets signs are
[8:51] deception signs are being hated and
[8:55] signs are the love of many will grow
[8:59] cold
[9:00] how many has ever got the cold shoulder
[9:03] how many ever got worse than the cold
[9:04] shoulder
[9:05] just people cold there's no heart in it
[9:08] anymore it's just coldness towards one
[9:10] another this is the atmosphere this is a
[9:13] sign that we're just about finished here
[9:16] just about finished here I want to read
[9:18] the last verse I'm going to read in
[9:19] verse 13 but he that shall endure until
[9:24] the end the same shall be saved
[9:28] so if it says that somebody
[9:31] is going to endure if we read verse 13
[9:34] again Saints we see that
[9:38] he that shall endure unto the end
[9:41] the same shall be saved so enduring to
[9:46] the end
[9:47] is really the key
[9:49] enduring to the end is really the key
[9:55] um how many wants to endure to the end
[9:57] so that's the key phrase from Jesus here
[10:00] is that he that endureth to the end
[10:02] shall be saved saved from what saved
[10:05] from these save from these atmospheres
[10:07] save from the hatred save from the
[10:11] offense
[10:12] saved from the spirit of betrayal
[10:15] saved from the deceptive prophets we
[10:18] ought to be saved from all that and he
[10:19] that endureth till the end shall be
[10:21] saved so enduring is the key the
[10:23] question is how do we endure to the end
[10:25] and what will we have working in us to
[10:29] cause us to make it to the end I'm
[10:32] asking that question tonight what is it
[10:34] that we will have with us because if God
[10:35] says there's going to be some that
[10:37] endures to the end then there's got to
[10:39] be something that he places within us
[10:42] that we would have the grace to endure
[10:45] all of these times
[10:46] if we want to endure to the end then is
[10:49] what is it well that we will have in us
[10:51] that would cause us to make it all the
[10:54] way to the end and to endure can you say
[10:57] Amen so that's the that's the key
[10:59] tonight is to look at what we have to
[11:01] have within us to be able to endure
[11:04] these things many are Fallen by the
[11:06] wayside many are dropping off track many
[11:09] are giving up can you say man many are
[11:12] under the pressures are they're just
[11:13] throwing in the towel and so there's
[11:16] many have fallen by the wayside we never
[11:18] write them off we pray that God will
[11:19] bring them back but there's many that's
[11:21] doing that and a lot of it is because of
[11:23] the pressures the scares the fears but I
[11:27] can tell you not just the pressures of
[11:29] wars and rumors of wars and men's Hearts
[11:31] failing for fear but these pressures are
[11:34] added in here too the pressure of being
[11:36] betrayed the pressure of people being
[11:38] offended the pressure of being hated and
[11:41] people hating one another the families
[11:44] hating one another the pressure of
[11:46] iniquity abounding and the love of many
[11:49] growing cold that also is a pressure and
[11:52] that's mostly a pressure to our spirit
[11:54] to our emotions
[11:56] not our soul can you say man our soul
[11:59] should be anchored in the Haven of Rest
[12:01] but our spirit can be affected by these
[12:05] different things and as I said last
[12:07] Wednesday night betrayal is one of the
[12:09] top things a human Spirit has a hard
[12:12] time getting over is somebody betraying
[12:15] you
[12:17] it's difficult for the human Spirit to
[12:19] be able to handle so in in last week we
[12:21] were in the closing hours of Jesus life
[12:23] and I called it Jesus our Jesus hour
[12:26] betrayal in the last week of his life
[12:29] this week I want to entitle this dealing
[12:32] with this hour of betrayal because just
[12:34] like Jesus had an intense hour of
[12:36] betrayal now the bride is having an
[12:39] intense hour of betrayal as well and so
[12:43] how did Jesus go through that how did he
[12:45] endure how did he come through so we we
[12:47] talked uh and I'll just mention it again
[12:49] about Christ because I was ministered to
[12:52] greatly last week to see the the the
[12:54] days and the hours and the steps and my
[12:58] biggest thing that ministered to me the
[13:00] biggest thing that ministered to me is I
[13:02] was looking at how did Jesus get through
[13:04] being forsaken by every Everybody how
[13:08] did he get through standing on his own
[13:09] what was the motivating thing we know
[13:12] God was in him can you say Amen we
[13:14] understand that but I'm going to point
[13:15] out something tonight that was an
[13:18] expression out of him that that kept
[13:20] coming up showing me that this is how we
[13:24] endure until the end this is how you
[13:26] endure betrayal the human Spirit can't
[13:29] endure this type of betrayal but God has
[13:32] his grace that we can endure betrayal
[13:34] and we can actually live above it and we
[13:37] can overcome it can you say amen and we
[13:39] could actually be Christians who love
[13:41] one another again even though love has
[13:45] failed us we think and we people have
[13:46] failed us and the confidence has failed
[13:49] but God can bring us such a strength
[13:52] with his Divine love that we can love
[13:54] like we've never ever been hurt before
[14:00] that's a well I'm preaching way up here
[14:02] above our heads tonight a night that we
[14:05] can love and give our hearts like we've
[14:07] never been hurt before like we've never
[14:09] been betrayed before
[14:11] and the next guy the next guy that comes
[14:14] along we're given all of our love of
[14:16] Christ to them and we're not putting
[14:18] them in a category that they're going to
[14:20] betray me too that's not actually not
[14:22] fair
[14:24] that's not fair to do that
[14:27] and so Jesus didn't do that for sure and
[14:30] so the next guy doesn't get the blunt of
[14:33] our hurt from our past betrayals and our
[14:35] heard from our past offenses they don't
[14:37] get the blood of it because we've
[14:39] decided to freely give the love of God
[14:41] and love as if you've never been hurt
[14:43] before and to give it even when we're we
[14:46] have the risk all the time of being hurt
[14:48] again
[14:49] I can't preach to your life that you're
[14:51] not going to get hurt by somebody
[14:52] tomorrow that somebody's not going to
[14:53] post something against you tomorrow that
[14:55] a friend is not going to turn I can't
[14:57] guarantee you that a friend is not going
[14:59] to turn against you tomorrow life is
[15:02] like that but I can preach to you a holy
[15:04] ghost and a love in the Holy Ghost that
[15:07] can live above it and live higher than
[15:08] it
[15:10] and that can love anyway
[15:12] and to live and be a better friend than
[15:15] what they're being to you
[15:17] praise the Lord so now I preached the
[15:21] intensity of the hour that Jesus went
[15:23] through it was truly above all human
[15:26] endurance what Jesus went through not
[15:28] only the cross and Calvary but the
[15:30] Betrayal uh if if we were going through
[15:33] that and none of us went through it like
[15:35] Christ it would actually cut to the very
[15:37] core of the human Spirit to feel the
[15:41] depth of friends forsaking him like they
[15:45] did it would cut to the core of our
[15:47] human Spirit to have to feel what Jesus
[15:51] felt and how much betrayal that it was
[15:54] and how much losing his friends his
[15:57] closest people to him walked away
[16:01] and I'll tell you it cuts to the core of
[16:04] Who We Are
[16:05] because God's made us a relational being
[16:10] God has made you a relational being
[16:12] that's why you can go off and say I'm
[16:15] sick and tired of people I'm going up to
[16:17] the Smoky Mountains which I wouldn't
[16:19] mind doing by the way going up to the
[16:21] Smokies I'm gonna get a cabin up there I
[16:23] never want to see people again but I'm
[16:25] going I'm getting ready to and and so
[16:27] you can go that but you know what you're
[16:29] doing you're denying the CR the creation
[16:32] God has made you because God has created
[16:35] even human beings he's created us
[16:38] relational people
[16:42] and the first time he said it he said
[16:44] that when he was going to bring Eve to
[16:45] Adam he says it's not good for man to be
[16:50] alone
[16:52] he made this a relational being it's not
[16:54] good for man it doesn't doesn't mean
[16:56] God's just going to give you a wife
[16:57] that's not no our relationships let me
[16:59] say this let me say this some guys think
[17:01] and some girls think that's the ultimate
[17:04] relationship and if I get that I don't
[17:05] need anybody else no God made you for
[17:07] all kinds of relationships and you can't
[17:10] have if you if you can't have a healthy
[17:13] relationship with others through your
[17:15] your single years if you have trouble
[17:18] with all your other relationship there's
[17:20] no guarantee your relationship with your
[17:22] wife or husband will be right
[17:23] can I say that tonight
[17:25] why because if you haven't practiced and
[17:28] you haven't learned to be the right type
[17:30] of friend in relation you're not going
[17:32] to apply that to your wife oh no I'll do
[17:33] it I love her I love him it's going to
[17:35] be fine I can ditch everybody else no no
[17:38] God is teaching you to have the right
[17:40] relationship with everybody
[17:43] and it's only through the Oneness of
[17:44] Christ it's only him that teaches us
[17:47] about relationship
[17:49] he come up with this idea he created us
[17:52] can you say amen and he's the first one
[17:54] who said it's not good for man to be
[17:56] alone he never created us to be on our
[17:59] own individuals with nobody else but he
[18:01] created us for a relationship with him
[18:04] and he created us for a relationship
[18:06] with others and guess what he created us
[18:08] through the Holy Ghost he created us for
[18:11] good relationships
[18:16] good friendships
[18:18] solid relationships how many would raise
[18:21] your hands say I'd like to have more of
[18:22] that
[18:23] only in the Holy Ghost
[18:26] who is the author of destroying
[18:29] relationships who is the author of
[18:32] betrayal and offense and breaking
[18:35] promises and breaking relations who's
[18:37] the author of divorce
[18:40] it's not God
[18:43] and so if he had the true thing then we
[18:45] know God can not only give us the Holy
[18:48] Ghost for Oneness with God and one
[18:50] another but he can teach us what true
[18:53] relationship is and really today we have
[18:55] to be taught because we come a lot of us
[18:57] from such broken homes and broken
[18:59] churches and broken relationships and
[19:02] some of us didn't even get the right
[19:04] image of what a husband and wife was
[19:08] some of us didn't even get a right image
[19:10] of what brothers and sisters are and
[19:12] right relationships between siblings
[19:14] some have seen a twisted View and even
[19:16] if you had a decent home if you fell on
[19:18] Hollywood too much you really got a
[19:20] Twist of view of relationships can you
[19:22] say mine because it taught the wrong
[19:25] type of relationship it taught
[19:27] disrespect to parents it talked
[19:30] disrespect between a husband and wife it
[19:33] teaches it and so now you got all that
[19:35] messed up in your mind you have to be
[19:37] by the Holy Ghost
[19:39] you say well man that's it I don't need
[19:41] anything else and now that I gotta know
[19:43] you have to be re-taught by the Holy
[19:45] Ghost doesn't the Bible says the holy
[19:47] ghost that teacheth things
[19:50] the Holy Ghost is a teacher well if we
[19:52] already know everything when we got the
[19:54] Holy Ghost then we don't need Holy Ghost
[19:55] teacher does anybody know that Pericles
[19:58] the holy ghost in the Greek is Pericles
[20:00] one who goes alongside to help as a
[20:03] tutor so if we're we needed a tutor
[20:07] then we must be the student
[20:09] who doesn't know everything already
[20:13] oh I'm starting to preach now put down
[20:15] my notes and go with this
[20:18] the Holy Ghost is the teacher that will
[20:20] lead you and guide you into all truth
[20:23] it's not a one-night event
[20:26] but once you have the teacher inside you
[20:29] then as a student you say okay I'm
[20:32] submissive now for you to train me and
[20:34] if it takes 30 years for me to graduate
[20:37] I'm staying in the tutors class and I'm
[20:40] going to be taught and I'm going to
[20:41] submit to this tutor can you say Amen
[20:44] but one of the things this Holy Ghost
[20:46] teacher has to teach people and re-teach
[20:48] them is about relationship what it means
[20:51] to be a husband and wife and be in
[20:52] Oneness
[20:53] what it means for a family to dwell
[20:56] together in unity
[20:58] what it means for brothers and sisters
[21:01] to be in a church and come to Oneness in
[21:04] a friendship not just friendship but
[21:07] brothers and sisters what it means to
[21:09] really come to close relationships we
[21:12] have to be retaught because most of us
[21:13] didn't come from stable types of
[21:16] backgrounds
[21:18] if you did praise the Lord but all of us
[21:21] could take some more teaching
[21:26] relationships 101.
[21:28] we're not going to get that from some
[21:30] University
[21:32] the Holy Ghost through the word
[21:35] is gonna if we'll be the student
[21:37] and if you be humble enough to say as a
[21:39] student you know what I need help
[21:42] because my wife and I aren't as close as
[21:45] we could be
[21:48] my friendships have all gone awry
[21:51] so it seems like I've come to the place
[21:53] I don't even have any friendships left
[21:56] well maybe you should look at yourself
[21:57] first
[22:00] it's Jesus you know it I've got to move
[22:03] on with him but and talk about just a
[22:06] little bit but I want to move on to our
[22:08] our betrayal don't forget being betrayed
[22:11] may be the worst pain in our spirit we'd
[22:13] ever experience betrayal means to
[22:16] someone to break trust with us to let us
[22:18] down to break one's promise to be
[22:21] disloyal to us to deceive now you've
[22:24] either had that happen to you but you
[22:25] probably had both you've done the same
[22:27] thing to other people disloyal deceives
[22:30] someone to break up a promise to
[22:32] somebody to let somebody down we're
[22:34] human beings and we fall under that we
[22:36] do that to other people that's why we
[22:37] should have Grace for other people
[22:38] because we've done it to other people
[22:40] ourselves
[22:42] and so across the board you say I my
[22:46] human Frailty has not been a good friend
[22:48] to somebody I have not been a good
[22:49] friend so you have Grace if they're not
[22:51] being a good friend to you or something
[22:52] like that has happened then you realize
[22:54] my I've had the same thing I I've done
[22:56] the same thing and so we all need God we
[22:59] need more of God we need more of his
[23:00] transforming power in our lives we need
[23:02] to be transformed by the renewing of our
[23:04] minds and be taught by the Holy Ghost so
[23:07] I can become a better friend a better
[23:09] brother in Christ a better brother to my
[23:12] sisters and my siblings a better son to
[23:14] my father a better son to my mother a
[23:17] better daughter to my family even a a a
[23:20] a an unsaved mom there can be levels of
[23:24] respect and Oneness and trust me God
[23:28] that can actually speak through that
[23:31] unsaved mom you don't work around God's
[23:33] principles can you say amen God gave
[23:36] those parents Authority in your life now
[23:37] if they ask you to do something to do
[23:39] that's off the word that's another story
[23:40] but God will respect you you as you
[23:43] respect your unsaved parents God will
[23:45] work through them God if they're unsafe
[23:48] God can God spoke through a donkey
[23:52] God can work through unsaved people
[23:55] listen let me tell you the bosses I used
[23:57] to have the bosses and I was an employee
[23:59] and I got so upset at them until I
[24:02] realized God can speak through an
[24:04] unconverted boss and teach me lessons
[24:08] God is teaching us
[24:11] by the Holy Ghost
[24:14] to bring us into better relationships
[24:18] and betrayal is one of the worst things
[24:20] that can head a human spirit that they
[24:22] never trust somebody again
[24:25] how worse can it get I'll quit preaching
[24:27] at you and I'll preach at me how worse
[24:29] can it get when someone's been betrayed
[24:31] by a gospel minister
[24:34] how much worse or someone who believed
[24:37] did I read the scripture in Psalms 55
[24:39] last week I think it was where David
[24:41] said I could have handled it if it had
[24:44] been my enemy who turned against me but
[24:46] it was a guy I walked to church with
[24:48] every witch
[24:49] cuts to the core of us
[24:51] but to preach about preachers who who
[24:55] abuse their Authority and abuse and
[24:58] maybe not live their life and then
[25:00] someone finds out years later they're
[25:02] not living the life and they're living
[25:03] an immoral life or some preacher who is
[25:06] abusing uh money women or popularity and
[25:09] and those are the three things ministers
[25:10] Fall by or to find out after 30
[25:13] something years a brother has preached
[25:15] the message now denies the entire
[25:16] message and walks away from it that's
[25:19] difficult that's you know what that is
[25:20] that's betrayal to your human Spirit
[25:23] that's a betrayal
[25:25] and the human Spirit does not get over
[25:27] that too quickly
[25:29] people are suffering from it
[25:33] preachers that didn't stay faithful
[25:36] and the hundreds of thousands of people
[25:38] around the world that are suffering
[25:39] young people suffering because of the
[25:43] Betrayal
[25:44] betrayal
[25:46] it affects the human spirit
[25:49] we might as well raise our hand and
[25:51] admit it
[25:53] it cuts to the Corsa and if we don't if
[25:56] we don't get forgiveness and get these
[25:58] things that God has given us forgiveness
[26:00] and divine love in our hearts and say
[26:02] Lord I want to overcome this I want to
[26:04] become the right person I can't change
[26:06] that person but I want to get past my
[26:09] past
[26:11] I have got to get past my path Lord wash
[26:15] my sins and your forgetfulness wash my
[26:17] mistakes what they've done is between
[26:20] them and God but I by the grace of God
[26:23] have felt a flood and a wash of
[26:25] forgiveness in my soul I can say
[26:27] honestly I have forgiven that person
[26:29] completely and now this is not going to
[26:31] dominate my mind or dominate my sleep
[26:34] this is the past over a year and this is
[26:38] my future
[26:41] and when we mix the past with the future
[26:46] we are defeated all the time
[26:49] all the potential for the future it
[26:51] could be so great
[26:54] but we're blending it with the past and
[26:56] it's tainting us it's hurting us it's
[26:57] it's binding us because we want to go
[27:01] forward but we got all this baggage and
[27:03] this plague in our minds and and even
[27:05] though we've been forgive enough stuff
[27:07] and all these other things but you see
[27:08] maybe we haven't forgiven someone else
[27:10] of the portrayal they did to our lives
[27:14] and we haven't let it go yet and so we
[27:17] can't have the power because how many
[27:20] know that there's power that's in our
[27:23] past
[27:25] is a powerful sway over you
[27:28] if it's not washed away
[27:32] but the good thing is is your future has
[27:34] a power in it
[27:36] God called our families to be free
[27:39] God called our families to the Token God
[27:42] calls our families to be honest with one
[27:44] another God called our families to be in
[27:46] Oneness God called our marriages to be
[27:48] in Oneness
[27:49] being honest with one another being real
[27:52] with one another lifting one another up
[27:54] and encourage one another when we fail
[27:57] when we fall
