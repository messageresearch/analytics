[2:49] 2
[2:50] verse 5.

[3:18] and uh tonight I would like to title
[3:22] this message
[3:23] uh uh the royal priesthood
[3:27] Hallelujah
[3:29] he also as Lively stones are built up a
[3:33] spiritual house
[3:35] and holy priesthood
[3:37] to offer up spiritual sacrifices
[3:40] acceptable to God by Jesus Christ
[3:44] spiritual priesthood Hallelujah
[3:48] now
[3:49] when you talk about priesthood
[3:52] in the Old Testament the priest
[3:56] they are those people that uh they live
[4:01] uh with a dedicated lives Hallelujah to
[4:05] God
[4:05] and not to live for their own
[4:09] Hallelujah
[4:11] serve for the brethren
[4:15] and uh when Joshua
[4:18] divided the land
[4:20] uh they didn't have a portion of the
[4:23] land
[4:24] Alleluia
[4:26] and yet Gada was taking care for them
[4:29] and God is their portion
[4:32] and they are
[4:34] they are those uh uh the other tribe of
[4:38] Israel that uh didn't care so much for
[4:42] they don't do so much and they don't
[4:44] care so much for the things for the
[4:46] material things but they are more on the
[4:49] spiritual side
[4:51] they they work in in the temple to serve
[4:54] for the Brethren Hallelujah
[4:57] and uh the Bible said that uh
[5:00] he has made us in uh Revelation chapter
[5:04] five verse 10 that he has made us Kings
[5:07] and Priests
[5:09] unto our God
[5:10] Hallelujah
[5:12] and uh King uh priest
[5:15] in the Old Testament
[5:17] and then uh their Works their their job
[5:21] halleluia is to serve people is to serve
[5:25] their brethren
[5:26] and then uh the Bible said that he has
[5:30] made us Kings and Priests unto our God
[5:35] now
[5:36] the natural Israel is a type
[5:41] unto the church which is the
[5:44] the spiritual Israel
[5:46] Hallelujah now this evening I would like
[5:49] to to take an example of Israel's
[5:52] Journey when they came out of Egypt and
[5:56] when they journeyed into the Promised
[5:58] Land
[5:58] Hallelujah and brother Abraham said that
[6:02] uh
[6:02] many people refer the promised land to
[6:05] Millennium to the millennium and he said
[6:08] it is not
[6:09] the promised land had Wars and killings
[6:13] the Millennium won't have any wars or
[6:15] killings it referred to the Holy Ghost
[6:18] Holy Spirit the battlegrounds
[6:21] Allelujah and uh
[6:24] once we become a part of that body the
[6:28] body of Jesus Christ and barbraham said
[6:31] that we are not on a picnic
[6:33] we are on a Battlefield
[6:36] that's why maybe some of you are
[6:39] wondering
[6:40] why you have more the trials that you
[6:44] that you are having now Allelujah is uh
[6:48] you know more you have more trials
[6:51] than uh the first time you accepted the
[6:55] message
[6:56] Hallelujah because uh
[6:59] in uh
[7:01] uh we are not in in a picnic and we are
[7:04] on a Battlefield
[7:06] now in Israel's Journey to the promised
[7:09] land there were three stages the same to
[7:12] the three stages of Grace when when God
[7:15] redeemed his church
[7:16] Hallelujah and uh Redemption Abraham
[7:20] said that Redemption means to bring back
[7:23] to its original position
[7:26] and uh Israel there are rightful
[7:29] position is not in Egypt
[7:33] the rightful position
[7:35] is in Canaan land Alleluia and they were
[7:39] just born when they were born at that
[7:42] time
[7:43] they were already
[7:45] under
[7:46] there are the bondage they were already
[7:49] under uh their their task Masters
[7:53] and uh they don't they didn't do
[7:56] anything but when they were born
[7:59] that was already their situation
[8:01] Hallelujah but uh you know their
[8:04] rightful position is in Canaan so God
[8:07] had to redeem them and bring them back
[8:09] to Canaan the same thing with the church
[8:12] Hallelujah we were born in sin uh when
[8:16] we were born
[8:18] we are already born under bondage of sin
[8:21] Allelujah under the spirit that worketh
[8:23] the Bible says that worketh in the
[8:26] children of these obedience Hallelujah
[8:29] but by his grace we have also this uh
[8:32] three stages of Grace by justification
[8:35] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[8:38] Ghost this is to bring us back into our
[8:40] rightful position
[8:42] justification when they left Egypt after
[8:46] they heard the message of of the prophet
[8:49] of God believing the word then they
[8:52] separated themselves from the Egyptians
[8:56] and then sanctification after they
[8:59] crossed the Red Sea and killed all the
[9:02] things
[9:03] behind them like all the Egyptians all
[9:06] Egypt all the world was killed behind
[9:10] them
[9:11] and uh through the uh the blood that
[9:14] kills all the human desire and he is
[9:17] sanctifying us hallelujah from the
[9:19] desires of evil then the last stage is
[9:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is when
[9:26] they crossed Jordan
[9:28] Hallelujah into the promised land which
[9:31] uh their inheritance laid and Jordan
[9:34] means death
[9:36] halleluia
[9:39] and uh
[9:40] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we are
[9:43] born after uh the third stage Hallelujah
[9:47] which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[9:48] and through the baptism of the Holy
[9:50] Ghost we are born into that body we
[9:53] become a part of the body of Jesus
[9:55] Christ First Corinthians chapter 12
[9:57] verse 13 for by one Spirit we are all
[10:01] baptized into one body not because you
[10:04] are a member of this uh Church the
[10:06] little literal church but you have this
[10:11] experience Hallelujah to be baptized
[10:14] with the Holy Spirit into that one body
[10:16] and then you become a part of that body
[10:19] and when you become a part of the body
[10:21] like just like God Israel after Crossing
[10:25] Jordan then the greatest battle that
[10:28] happened in the time of Israel was after
[10:31] the Cross Jordan not the wind they just
[10:34] left Egypt
[10:37] but when they started to possess the
[10:40] promised land those that had crossed
[10:43] Jordan death Alleluia they have this
[10:46] great battle
[10:48] all
[10:51] this land
[10:53] Hallelujah all the land in every place
[10:56] that the soul of your uh uh fourth have
[10:59] trade
[11:01] Hallelujah that land is yours
[11:04] the promise is yours Hallelujah all
[11:08] will be yours
[11:10] but God he did not just uh give them
[11:13] easy like that but when God promised
[11:17] Hallelujah the Promised Land
[11:21] he put some Giants
[11:23] and he put some old cities
[11:26] and well-trained soldiers Hallelujah and
[11:30] behav to fight every inch of their
[11:33] inheritance it's the same thing to us
[11:36] brothers and sisters but the only thing
[11:38] that but the only good thing that God
[11:41] has done is he said the battle is not
[11:45] yours the battle is of the lord we are
[11:48] fighting Hallelujah a battle that is
[11:50] already that had been already conquered
[11:54] Hallelujah we are fighting an enemy
[11:56] that's been
[11:57] defeated Allelujah and we only have we
[12:02] only need to have faith Hallelujah on
[12:05] the word of God and not to to live
[12:08] Hallelujah by our by our senses by our
[12:13] emotion Hallelujah but we have to live
[12:16] what the Lord what the word of God says
[12:18] hallelujah
[12:20] now
[12:22] in the natural battle it needs teamwork
[12:27] Hallelujah that's why
[12:31] like you have the the number one
[12:35] military force in the world is the
[12:37] United States and you can even in the in
[12:40] the Philippines the U.S forces they go
[12:43] there with our
[12:46] Philippine forces and they they do some
[12:49] war games
[12:51] Hallelujah military exercises
[12:56] a teamwork
[13:00] the ground forces
[13:03] how they use the artillery
[13:06] the Air Force the Navy and they must
[13:10] have
[13:10] in Perfect Harmony
[13:13] Hallelujah
[13:14] and uh in the Philippines we call it
[13:17] balikatan exercises
[13:19] balikatan means shoulder to shoulder
[13:23] Hallelujah
[13:25] and when you are in in a battle
[13:28] Hallelujah
[13:30] if you are in in ground force Allelujah
[13:34] you are with the ground force you have
[13:36] to fight
[13:37] Hallelujah with your body
[13:40] shoulder to shoulder
[13:42] and sometimes you know when I was uh
[13:45] when I was a boy there is uh there was a
[13:48] military come near to our house
[13:51] and this armies sometimes they are not
[13:54] in the field they go to to places and
[13:57] sometimes I remembered one time the the
[14:01] they were drinking at my at our house
[14:05] and sometimes these uh these soldiers
[14:08] they are having sometimes uh quarrel
[14:11] with the
[14:12] uh with his fellow Soldier
[14:16] they have sometimes misunderstanding but
[14:19] when they are in the field
[14:21] they have to forget
[14:23] all their misunderstanding
[14:26] Hallelujah and they have to help one
[14:28] another
[14:29] Hallelujah and brothers and sisters it's
[14:32] the same thing Hallelujah we are in this
[14:35] great battle
[14:36] maybe you have some misunderstanding
[14:39] your upset your with your sister you
[14:42] feel upset with the brother but brothers
[14:44] and sisters you should know your enemy
[14:47] Hallelujah we should have we should
[14:49] fight shoulder to shoulder
[14:53] Hallelujah and you have to cover
[14:56] your your body
[14:58] Hallelujah and fight your true enemy
[15:07] uh
[15:09] eternal life is living for others
[15:12] Hallelujah
[15:14] in the message that they on Calvary he
[15:17] says now the first thing I want to say
[15:20] is Jesus never lived for himself
[15:23] his life was spent for others that's
[15:26] perfect eternal life
[15:28] when you say you go to church and you do
[15:31] good things that's fine but when you
[15:35] live your life to yourself you have an
[15:38] eternal life
[15:39] because eternal life is living for
[15:42] others that's why in Romans chapter 15
[15:45] verse 1 it says we that are strong
[15:50] ought to Bear the infirmities of the
[15:51] weak
[15:52] and not to please ourselves
[15:55] Hallelujah now remember that
[15:59] uh you cannot bear the infirmities of
[16:02] the week
[16:04] when you yourself is weak
[16:06] Hallelujah we know yourself is still a
[16:09] baby
[16:10] and that's the reason one of the reasons
[16:12] that God gave us the fightful ministry
[16:15] is in order for us to not to remain
[16:19] children
[16:21] in Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11.
[16:24] he says
[16:26] 11 to 14 he says and he gave some
[16:28] Apostles and some prophets and some
[16:30] evangelists and some pastors and
[16:33] teachers
[16:34] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[16:37] work of the ministry for the defying of
[16:39] the body of Christ
[16:40] till we all come in the unity of the
[16:44] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[16:46] God unto a perfect man
[16:50] unto a perfect man if you will look this
[16:54] word perfect if you will click it and
[16:57] see the Greek Lexicon it means perfect
[17:00] means full grown
[17:02] matured adult
[17:05] Allelujah
[17:07] till we all come in the unity of the
[17:09] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[17:11] God so he gave he gave us
[17:16] despiteful Ministry
[17:19] of the knowledge of the son of God
[17:23] a perfect man in order for us to be full
[17:26] grown to be matured to be adult
[17:28] and to the measure of this teacher of
[17:31] the fullness of Christ verse 14 that we
[17:34] henceforth be no more children
[17:38] Hallelujah those two and fro and carried
[17:41] about with Ibraham abduction by this
[17:43] light of man and cunning craftiness
[17:46] whereby Delight in weight to deceive in
[17:50] order for us to not to remain
[17:53] children
[17:54] Hebrews chapter 5 verse 12
[17:57] for when
[17:59] for this for the time he ought to be
[18:01] teachers
[18:03] so
[18:04] Paul was a little bit
[18:07] disappointed
[18:09] after uh
[18:12] uh doing his part to help them in order
[18:16] for them to be matured he says he ought
[18:19] to be teachers what what is the use of
[18:22] teachers to help others
[18:24] to grow Hallelujah then he said he have
[18:28] made that one teach you again which be
[18:31] the first principles of the Oracles of
[18:33] God and are become such as that need of
[18:38] milk
[18:39] you're still baby
[18:41] need of milk and not of strong meat
[18:45] and here is uh
[18:47] some signs about a babe
[18:51] or a child First Corinthians chapter 3
[18:54] verse 1 verses 1 to 4 he says
[18:57] and I breathe in could not speak unto
[19:00] you as unto spiritual means
[19:05] as anti-spiritual but it says us unto
[19:09] colonel
[19:10] you are still a babe when you are carnal
[19:14] Hallelujah but when you are spiritual
[19:16] then
[19:18] you are full grown
[19:20] Hallelujah even as unto babes in Christ
[19:23] they are in Christ but they are still
[19:26] Hallelujah babes
[19:28] I have fed you with milk and not with
[19:31] meat for hitherto you were not able to
[19:34] Bear it neither yet now are ye able
[19:38] for ye are yet carnal
[19:40] Allelujah so carnality means
[19:44] being a yet a babe
[19:47] for year yet carnal for whereas there is
[19:50] among you
[19:52] in being
[19:54] we knew see these things
[19:57] in weighing and strife and divisions are
[20:01] ye not carnal and work as men
[20:04] for a while one says I am a Paul and
[20:08] another I am a bipolos are ye not carnal
[20:14] carnal in a babe
[20:18] Hebrews chapter 5 verse 13 for everyone
[20:21] that uses milk is unskillful
[20:24] Hallelujah
[20:26] in the word of righteousness for he is a
[20:28] babe
[20:30] Hallelujah
[20:32] it means when you are when a man is when
[20:35] uh when a Believer is still a babe he is
[20:37] unskillful
[20:39] imagine you go to war and you have a
[20:42] babe
[20:43] you have a big video
[20:45] he cannot help
[20:47] Hallelujah he is just a burden
[20:50] Hallelujah
[20:52] brothers and sisters we are in this
[20:53] great battle
[20:54] Hallelujah and we need to grow
[20:57] Hallelujah and he has made us Kings and
[21:00] Priests Alleluia means priest Hallelujah
[21:05] to offer up sacrifices
[21:08] Hallelujah for the brethren
[21:11] Hallelujah so being a babe is unskillful
[21:15] and now
[21:17] here are some signs of
[21:19] a man being a matured one
[21:23] John chapter 21 verse 18
[21:34] he says
[21:36] verily verily I say and today when thou
[21:39] was young
[21:41] the goodness thyself and focused whether
[21:44] the worst
[21:47] but when thou art behold
[21:49] Thou shalt stressport thy hands and
[21:53] another shall guard thee and carry thee
[21:57] wither the word is not
[22:00] when you are young
[22:02] you do whatever you want to do
[22:05] and you go to places
[22:09] that you want to go
[22:11] when you are still young you know your
[22:13] own will
[22:15] but when you became old you became
[22:18] matured
[22:19] you don't know
[22:21] anymore the things that you want to do
[22:24] you just transport your hands and
[22:27] somebody's will
[22:29] even though you don't like to wear
[22:31] yellow shirt
[22:33] Hallelujah you can do nothing because it
[22:37] is no more you Hallelujah
[22:39] it is somebody who wants uh to put the
[22:43] you need to put this
[22:46] the shirt and you just have to stretch
[22:49] out your hands Allelujah you don't go to
[22:52] places that you want to go
[22:54] it is no more your will be done
[22:58] when you become old you learn how to say
[23:01] lord it's not my will
[23:03] but your will be done in me
[23:06] it is no longer you that liveth
[23:09] Hallelujah just like Paul
[23:13] Hallelujah before his conversion
[23:15] halleluia he wants to persecute he wants
[23:20] to kill the Believers Hallelujah but
[23:22] after he was converted he was no longer
[23:26] living for his own
[23:28] it is now Christ that lives in him
[23:31] instead of persecuting the Believers he
[23:34] become now a support a help to the
[23:36] Believers Hallelujah that's why in
[23:39] Galatians chapter 2 verse 20 he says I
[23:41] am crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[23:45] live
[23:45] it's not I
[23:48] that liveth but Christ liveth in me and
[23:52] the life which I now live in the flesh I
[23:54] live by the faith
[23:55] of the Son of God it's not even his own
[23:58] faith he is living the faith of the Son
[24:01] of God who loved me and gave himself for
[24:04] me
[24:05] Hallelujah
[24:09] we are a man
[24:11] started Living
[24:14] halleluia under the leading of the Holy
[24:17] Ghost
[24:18] he is old and then that's the time that
[24:21] he can help Hallelujah the week
[24:34] Luke chapter 22
[24:36] it was better Hallelujah it was Peter 31
[24:41] and 32 he says and the Lord said Simon
[24:43] Simon behold Satan had desired to have
[24:46] you that he may save you a sweet
[24:49] but I have prayed for they that thy
[24:52] faith fell not and when they were
[24:55] converted strengthened thy brethren
[24:58] although Peter was determined to protect
[25:01] Allelujah his master
[25:06] when his master said
[25:09] the shepherd shall be smitten
[25:12] and the Sheep shall
[25:14] scatter
[25:17] Peter in his
[25:19] Human Nature
[25:21] he said Over My Dead Body
[25:24] Hallelujah
[25:28] and then when Malco was trying to arrest
[25:31] the Lord
[25:33] and he drew his sword and you know he
[25:37] went to cut the head of Malco
[25:39] but malko
[25:42] escape and it was only his
[25:45] ear was cut
[25:47] Hallelujah
[25:48] but uh Peter Peter put back put back
[25:52] your sword Hallelujah
[25:55] and then before his conversion
[25:59] halleluia
[26:01] just a lady
[26:04] isn't it that you are with with that
[26:07] Jesus
[26:09] I don't know what you are saying
[26:12] Hallelujah he denied three times
[26:14] Allelujah
[26:16] then uh
[26:18] it seems he is a tough guy
[26:21] but
[26:27] he was a covered one
[26:29] Hallelujah but brothers and sisters but
[26:32] when the word Peter you cannot help now
[26:35] but when they were converted
[26:38] when was Peter was when Peter was
[26:40] converted after when he was baptized
[26:43] with the Holy Ghost filled with the Holy
[26:45] Ghost Hallelujah that's the time he says
[26:48] when thou art converted that's the time
[26:51] yet that you can strengthen your
[26:52] brethren
[26:54] I believe birds and sisters that
[26:57] Peter he got a wife
[27:00] the Bible said he got a mother-in-law
[27:03] if you have a mother-in-law I believe
[27:05] you he got a wife
[27:07] and maybe he he got children
[27:10] Alleluia but after he was converted
[27:13] that's why one time he was complaining
[27:15] Mark chapter 13 verse 20 to 30 then
[27:18] Peter began to say unto him Lo we have
[27:20] left all
[27:22] and have followed the
[27:24] Hallelujah and Jesus answered and said
[27:26] verily I say unto thee unto you there is
[27:30] none that had left house so I believe he
[27:32] got the house Allelujah
[27:35] left house or Brethren or sisters or
[27:38] father or mother or wife or children or
[27:42] lands for my sake and the gods and in
[27:46] the gospels but he shall receive 100
[27:49] fold now in this time houses and
[27:52] Brethren and sisters and mothers and
[27:55] children and lands with persecutions and
[27:59] in the world to come eternal life
[28:02] Hallelujah
[28:04] I believe
[28:06] maybe his neighbor was watching Peter
[28:09] when Peter was
[28:12] leaving his house leaving his family I
[28:16] think
[28:17] Allelujah and maybe his neighbor was
[28:19] thinking oh
[28:20] this is a responsible person
[28:24] Hallelujah he is living you know he got
[28:27] a responsible for his family
[28:29] Alleluia
[28:31] but he is living he always leave his
[28:34] house his family
[28:37] but the thing that they don't know
[28:40] is there were
[28:43] thousands of Soul being held
[28:46] Hallelujah they were Believers that
[28:49] being helped because when he he became
[28:52] converted
[28:53] he is no longer living for his own but
[28:57] he was living for others
[28:59] Hallelujah doing his Hallelujah his uh
[29:04] his obligation to strengthen the
[29:07] brethren
[29:09] Hallelujah after he was converted after
[29:12] he lived under Alleluia the leading of
[29:16] the Holy Ghost
[29:17] and that's the time that he became
[29:19] matured
[29:20] Allelujah in the Lord
[29:23] Hallelujah
[29:26] you know
[29:28] Israel before deposits The Land Before
[29:31] the Cross Jordan
[29:33] Alleluia and Moses
[29:36] Jose he had died he chose 12 spice
[29:44] Hallelujah in every tribe he just won
[29:47] Maybe
[29:49] if somebody will ask a brother Paul
[29:53] you you send our president one
[29:56] representative from your church
[29:58] and maybe purple will uh look for uh one
[30:02] who is who is matured in the faith
[30:05] that it seems he is already matured in
[30:08] the faith
[30:10] Hallelujah maybe that was that was the
[30:12] thing that happened to Israel
[30:15] they chose somebody who is uh who is
[30:19] like spiritual
[30:21] and then
[30:23] they went to search the land
[30:26] Allelujah
[30:27] and
[30:30] when they returned
[30:33] Numbers Chapter 13 Verse 26 and they
[30:36] went and came to Moses and to Aaron and
[30:38] to all the congregation of the children
[30:40] of Israel and to the children apparent
[30:42] to kaddish and brought back word unto
[30:46] them and unto all the congregation and
[30:49] showed them the fruit of the Lamb
[30:52] Hallelujah and they told him and said we
[30:55] came unto the land wither thou sentest
[30:58] us and surely
[31:00] it flew with with milk and honey and
[31:03] this is the fruit of it
[31:05] Allelujah
[31:06] you know how they knew how they knew
[31:08] that the land is fluid with milk and
[31:11] honey flowing with milk and honey
[31:13] before they they got into that land the
[31:17] word of the Lord had already told them
[31:19] that that is the kind of land that they
[31:21] are going to possess
[31:23] and he said this is the fruit of it this
[31:27] is the evidence of the word of God that
[31:28] the word of God is true
[31:30] Allelujah
[31:33] but brothers and sisters
[31:36] after that report then they continue and
[31:39] said nevertheless the people
[31:42] be strong that dwell in the land and the
[31:46] cities are world and very great and
[31:48] moreover we saw the children of Anna
[31:51] there and their malachites dwell in the
[31:54] land of the South and the Hittites and
[31:56] the devil sites and the amorites dwell
[31:58] in the mountains and the Canaanites
[32:00] dwell in the sea and by the coast of
[32:03] Jordan
[32:04] Hallelujah
[32:06] I
[32:07] first
[32:09] they gave a report according to the word
[32:12] of God debates on the word of God yes
[32:15] the word of God is true and this is the
[32:18] evidence imagine brothers and sisters
[32:20] just one cluster of grapes when you buy
[32:23] a cluster of grapes this time maybe it's
[32:26] only one pound or one kilo but at the
[32:29] time
[32:30] just one cluster of Braves two of them
[32:33] carrying it
[32:34] Hallelujah and this is the fruit this is
[32:37] the evidence
[32:38] that the word of God is true
[32:41] so when they look to the world
[32:43] Hallelujah this is the evidence the word
[32:46] of God is true but then they started
[32:48] Hallelujah
[32:50] telling the report based on their
[32:52] emotions on their on the thing that they
[32:56] saw By Their Eyes by their carnality
[32:59] Hallelujah but the men that went and he
[33:03] said no and they brought up an evil
[33:07] report of the land that they had
[33:09] searched unto the children of Israel
[33:11] saying the land
[33:13] through which uh
[33:15] we have gone to search it is a land that
[33:18] eateth up inhabitants
[33:20] how do you know that they are eating
[33:22] inhabitants
[33:24] Hallelujah who told you
[33:26] you go there when you go there and then
[33:31] you can you return you are all still 12
[33:35] why did you say
[33:38] who is the one lacking
[33:40] who is the one missing is there somebody
[33:42] missing among the club
[33:45] Hallelujah
[33:47] because it's only
[33:49] they are just basing it through
[33:52] you know their fear in their hearts and
[33:55] in their the negative things in
[33:57] their mind
[33:58] and that's carnality
[34:00] Hallelujah
[34:02] he says
[34:04] it is inhabitant the rope and all the
[34:06] people that we saw in
[34:08] it her men of a great stature
[34:12] and there we saw the Giants the sons of
[34:15] Enoch which come of the Giants and we
[34:18] were in our own sights
[34:21] our own site
[34:23] as grasshoppers
[34:25] and so we were in their sight we were in
[34:29] their sight as grasshopper
[34:31] did this giant told you that you are
[34:34] just aggress repair to me
[34:36] Hallelujah
[34:40] it is only by their carnality halleluia
[34:44] and when they gave their karna their
[34:48] reports
[34:49] basing on their carnality
[34:52] instead to help the congregation
[34:54] Allelujah it made the congregation
[34:59] weaker
[35:00] and doubted the word of God
[35:03] Hallelujah Numbers Chapter 14 verse 1
[35:05] and all the congregation lifted up their
[35:08] voices and cried and the people wept
[35:10] that night and all the children of
[35:12] Israel murmured against Moses and
[35:15] against Aaron and the whole congregation
[35:17] said unto them what God that we had died
[35:20] in the land of Egypt or would God
[35:23] now we had died in this Wilderness and
[35:28] therefore had the Lord brought us unto
[35:31] this land to Fall by The Sword and our
[35:33] wives and our children should be afraid
[35:37] were it not better for us to return
[35:40] into Egypt
[35:42] Hallelujah imagine brothers and sisters
[35:46] because of their carnality of being a
[35:49] babe
[35:50] being weak Allelujah
[35:54] it did not help the weak
[35:57] Hallelujah
[35:59] it made them more weaker
[36:02] halleluia
[36:06] instead of
[36:08] just believing
[36:10] to what God had said it's instead of
[36:13] believing Hallelujah the leading of God
[36:17] imagine brothers and sisters after 40
[36:19] years
[36:20] Hallelujah there is no feeble among them
[36:24] they did not work and yet after 40 years
[36:29] they are still alive
[36:32] it is enough versus sisters to to trust
[36:35] on the word of God
[36:37] Hallelujah just to live by it
[36:40] Allelujah
[36:42] verse 5
[36:45] then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces
[36:47] before all the Assembly of the
[36:48] congregation of the children of Israel
[36:50] and just what the son of nun and Khalid
[36:53] in in calib the son of japoni which were
[36:56] of them that searched the land rent
[36:59] their clothes and they speak until the
[37:02] company of the children of Israel saying
[37:04] the land which we passed Pastor the
[37:08] church is it is a is an exceeding good
[37:11] land
[37:13] Hallelujah then here is
[37:16] here are Joshua and khalib they are not
[37:19] basing on what we should what we saw
[37:21] they are missing the report on what the
[37:24] Lord
[37:25] had said
[37:26] Hallelujah they rent their clothes and
[37:30] verse 8 it says if the Lord Delight in
[37:32] us then he will bring us into this land
[37:36] and give it us a land which floweth with
[37:39] milk and honey
[37:41] if the Lord Delight in US
[37:44] if the Lord pleased us
[37:47] hallelujah how to please God
[37:51] without faith it is impossible to please
[37:53] him
[37:54] Hallelujah without faith what is faith
[37:56] faith is the substance of thing hope for
[37:59] the evidence of being not sin
[38:02] not by our observation not by our
[38:05] emotion but Hallelujah
[38:08] just to believe
[38:10] what God
[38:12] what the word of God is
[38:14] Hallelujah so they always believed the
[38:18] word what the word says hallelujah and
[38:21] not uh what they see with their eyes
[38:24] and then verse 9 only Rebel not ye unto
[38:28] the Lord neither fear ye the people of
[38:31] the land for they are bread for us
[38:34] their defense is departed from them and
[38:39] that the Lord Is With Us fear them not
[38:41] imagine brothers and sisters
[38:46] they were in the same group
[38:49] they saw the same thing they tested the
[38:52] same fruit of the land
[38:54] Alleluia but the other two
[38:57] the based on the word of God the report
[38:59] on the word of God and the other
[39:01] halleluia and the others
[39:04] they based on what they see what they
[39:07] feel Hallelujah
[39:09] brothers and sisters
[39:11] those that are carnal those that debate
[39:14] the report on their
[39:16] Hallelujah on what they see
[39:19] Allelujah it did not help
[39:22] the Believers
[39:25] it weakened Hallelujah the Believers
[39:30] now
[39:34] verse 40 and they rose up early in the
[39:36] morning and
[39:37] verse
[39:41] verse 9 only a rebel not against the
[39:43] Lord neither very the people of the land
[39:45] for the Earth
[39:46] bread
[39:48] for us so the other said we are just
[39:51] grasshopper
[39:53] Hallelujah and their side
[39:56] the same Hallelujah saying that they saw
[39:59] in the Promised Land
[40:00] but those who are basing with their
[40:02] emotions
[40:04] we are grocery but just when calib who
[40:08] are who were basing the report
[40:11] on the word of God this is they are just
[40:13] bread to us
[40:14] Hallelujah
[40:16] and there depends is departed from them
[40:19] and the Lord Is With Us feared him not
[40:21] but all the congregation bid Stone them
[40:25] with stones and the glory of the Lord
[40:27] appeared in the Tabernacle of the
[40:30] congregation before all the children of
[40:32] Israel verse 14. and they rose up early
[40:35] in the morning and got up
[40:39] got them up into the top of the mountain
[40:41] saying no we be here and we'll be up
[40:44] unto the place which the Lord had
[40:47] promised for we have sinned and Moses
[40:50] said now wherefore now do we transgress
[40:53] the Commandment of the Lord but it shall
[40:55] not prosper
[40:57] Moses said if you transgress the
[41:00] Commandment of the Lord it will never
[41:02] prosper
[41:04] for the Lord is not among you that ye be
[41:07] smitten before your enemies for the
[41:10] amalekites and the Canaanites are there
[41:12] before you and ye shall fall by the
[41:15] sword
[41:15] because ye are turned away from the Lord
[41:18] because ye are ye turned away from the
[41:22] Lord therefore the Lord will not be with
[41:25] you
[41:26] but they presumed
[41:29] to go up unto the unto the hilltop
[41:32] nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of
[41:34] the Lord and Moses departed not out of
[41:37] the camp and the amalekite came down and
[41:40] the Canaanites
[41:42] which dwell in in that hill and smooth
[41:45] them and disconfited them even until
[41:49] hormone Allelujah because of their
[41:52] carnality
[41:54] carnality is being at being children
[41:58] weak and their carnality
[42:01] made the people doubt the word of God at
[42:04] its cost
[42:06] Allelujah
[42:08] death to thousands or maybe Millions
[42:13] died in that day he died Hallelujah
[42:16] but thank God we have
[42:19] just one calling we need just one Khalid
[42:22] today
[42:23] Hallelujah
[42:24] then Joshua chapter 5
[42:27] verse two to five
[42:30] at that time the Lord said unto Joshua
[42:32] make these sharp knives and circumcise
[42:35] again the children of Israel the second
[42:37] time we know that uh
[42:40] our circumcision is not of the flesh
[42:43] it's of the Heart by the baptism of the
[42:46] Holy Ghost Hallelujah make them uh and
[42:50] and
[42:51] and circumcise again the children of
[42:53] Israel the second time and Joshua made
[42:55] him sharp knives and circumcised the
[42:58] children of Israel at the hill of the
[42:59] foreskins and this is the the cause why
[43:02] Joshua did circumcise
[43:05] all the people that came out of Egypt
[43:07] that were males even all the men of War
[43:10] died in the wilderness by the way after
[43:13] they came out of Egypt and now all the
[43:17] people that came out
[43:20] were circumcised but all the people that
[43:23] were born in the wilderness by the way
[43:25] as they came forth out of Egypt then
[43:27] they had not circumcised
[43:30] now here is the thing
[43:33] all the men all the mail that came out
[43:36] of Egypt they were circumcised
[43:38] but those that were born in the
[43:41] wilderness they were not circumcised so
[43:45] they need Allelujah before they
[43:47] possessed the land they need
[43:48] circumcision
[43:50] so that's only a type brothers and
[43:51] sisters
[43:53] but maybe you are wondering
[43:56] thinking why did it not circumcise
[44:02] in the wilderness
[44:05] when they were in Egypt they were busy
[44:08] they were working hard Allelujah they
[44:12] were under the other taskmasters and
[44:15] they don't have the prophet they don't
[44:18] have somebody to remind them about the
[44:20] camera of God to their father Abraham
[44:22] and yet they have time to circumcise
[44:27] but when they were in the wilderness
[44:30] they were not busy God was providing all
[44:34] their needs
[44:35] Hallelujah and then
[44:37] why is it that they were not able to
[44:39] circumcise
[44:43] their male child and they have the
[44:45] prophet to remind them
[44:48] Allelujah
[44:50] about the cabinet of God
[44:52] but if you see brothers and sisters
[44:54] leaving Egypt is justification
[44:57] and in the wilderness is sanctification
[45:00] it is not the time it is not the stage
[45:04] of
[45:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[45:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost is when they
[45:09] crossed Jordan
[45:12] so that's why the message is is very
[45:15] perfect
[45:15] if they you know it will break the
[45:18] pattern if they circumcise one of them
[45:21] in in the wilderness but no one of them
[45:23] were circumcised and we are in the
[45:26] wilderness they were just circumcised
[45:28] after
[45:29] Hallelujah
[45:31] when before the the
[45:35] Hallelujah deposits the land
[45:38] halleluia and circumcision
[45:41] because they are going now to fight a
[45:44] battle
[45:46] and they are they are going to help
[45:48] their Brethren possess the land
[45:51] and they cannot persist the land without
[45:52] being baptized with the Holy Ghost
[45:55] Hallelujah so our baptism of the Holy
[45:57] Ghost is
[46:00] the type of circumcision not influence
[46:03] but in the heart halleluia and you know
[46:06] brothers and sisters
[46:09] make the sharp knives
[46:15] Hallelujah and circumcised the male
[46:17] child the the men
[46:21] you know brothers and sisters
[46:24] when
[46:26] it was your parents Hallelujah who
[46:28] decided to circumcise you it is not your
[46:31] you know it is not your own decision
[46:35] Hallelujah you become circumcised by the
[46:38] decision of your parents
[46:40] but this time
[46:42] it is no longer
[46:44] the decision of your parents
[46:46] it is your own decision whether you have
[46:49] you have to face that
[46:52] that or not
[46:53] Hallelujah that's why brothers and
[46:56] sisters to be a part of that body to be
[46:58] born again it is not because your
[47:00] parents are believers
[47:03] it must be your own decision
[47:06] Hallelujah
[47:09] you have to face that sword hallelujah
[47:14] hallelujah the Surplus place
[47:17] Hallelujah
[47:21] the things
[47:23] the fleshly thing
[47:24] Allelujah
[47:26] it would be your own decision
[47:28] you need to have the same experience as
[47:31] your parents have
[47:35] Hallelujah
[47:37] Joshua chapter 1 verses
[47:41] one to nine
[47:42] now after the death of Moses the servant
[47:45] of the Lord it came to pass that the
[47:46] Lord speak unto Joshua the son of non
[47:48] Moses Minister saying Moses my servant
[47:51] is dead
[47:52] now therefore arise go over this Jordan
[47:57] thou and all these people unto the land
[48:00] which I do give to them unto the
[48:03] children of Israel every place that the
[48:06] soul of your foot shall tread upon that
[48:09] have I given unto you as I said unto
[48:12] Moses for the from the Wilderness and
[48:16] this Lebanon even unto the the Great
[48:18] River the river you protest all the land
[48:21] of the Hittites and unto the great City
[48:23] toward the going down of the sun shall
[48:26] be your Coast there shall not any man be
[48:29] able to stand before thee not any man
[48:33] hallelujah it's
[48:35] enough Hallelujah
[48:37] to believe the word of God
[48:41] [Music]
[48:43] not any man be able to stand before thee
[48:46] all the days of their life as I was with
[48:49] Moses so I will be with thee I will not
[48:51] fail the inner forsake thee
[48:54] Hallelujah so you have to lead the
[48:57] people you have to help the people
[48:59] hallelujah be strong and about good
[49:02] courage so how how you can how he can
[49:05] help the people is when he is strong

[49:12] people shout thou divide and inheritance
[49:14] the land which I swear unto their
[49:16] fathers to give them
[49:19] Allelujah now the question is how to be
[49:22] strong
[49:23] verse 7 only be those strong and very
[49:26] courageous that thou mayest observe
[49:30] to though according to all the law
[49:34] Hallelujah
[49:35] just observe to know according to all
[49:39] the law which Moses my servant commanded
[49:41] thee turn not from it to the right hand
[49:44] or to the left hand it means maybe this
[49:47] word is not
[49:49] it seems uh it seems to you that this is
[49:51] not right
[49:52] but you have
[49:55] to obey everyone not to do your own will
[49:59] but to do hallelujah what the word says

[50:03] help
[50:04] you have you will be successful

[55:11] now
[55:17] it's uh this is in chapter Joshua
[55:19] chapter 3 verses 14. and it came to pass
[55:22] when the people removed from their tents
[55:25] to pass over Jordan and the priest
[55:27] breaking uh bearing the Ark of the
[55:29] Covenant before the people and asked the
[55:31] that bird the ark were come unto Jordan
[55:35] and the faith of the priests that bird
[55:38] the ark were dipped in the brim of the
[55:42] water for Jordan overflow with all the
[55:44] banks all the time of harvest that uh
[55:47] the the waters were came down
[55:50] from above he stood and rose up
[55:54] upon and hip very far from the city Adam
[55:59] that is beside zaritan and those that
[56:02] came down toward the Sea of the plain
[56:04] even the salt sea failed and were cut
[56:08] off and the people passed
[56:12] override against Jericho and the prince
[56:16] that bear the Ark of the Covenant of the
[56:18] Lord stood firm on dry ground in the
[56:21] midst of Jordan and all
[56:24] the Israelites passed over on dry ground
[56:27] until all the people will were passed
[56:31] clean over Jordan
[56:34] here comes the priests
[56:37] halleluia maybe it was Joshua who
[56:39] commanded them okay praise
[56:41] you go and stand in the midst of Jordan
[56:44] and then the Bible says that
[56:48] the current was strong
[56:51] maybe the priests were thinking how
[56:53] about if
[56:54] I will be drawn
[56:56] Allelujah
[56:58] in that River
[56:59] but brothers and sisters because it is
[57:02] the Commandment to stand there
[57:04] Allelujah they don't care if they will
[57:07] drone
[57:08] Allelujah what they were thinking is
[57:11] there are people that needs to possess
[57:14] the land
[57:16] but brother sisters the good thing is
[57:18] when this started
[57:20] walking into the water
[57:22] and the river was
[57:25] was cut off Hallelujah and Jordan became
[57:30] Allelujah a dry ground
[57:33] and the Bible said Allah all and all
[57:36] Israelites passed over on dry ground
[57:38] until all the people were passed clean
[57:41] over Jordan
[57:45] how many hours you think they were
[57:49] standing
[57:50] Allelujah bearing that Ark you know how
[57:53] heavy that Ark was
[57:55] it was made of wood and then overlaid
[57:59] with gold
[58:00] oh my
[58:02] and then
[58:04] the table of stone were there
[58:08] Alleluia
[58:10] and maybe
[58:12] it's only several kilos
[58:14] but brothers and sisters is standing
[58:16] there until all
[58:18] Israel were able Hallelujah were passed
[58:22] that Jordan
[58:25] and you have to stand there
[58:28] Hallelujah and not moving
[58:32] how many people how many Israelites
[58:35] were at that time
[58:38] I will give you brothers and sisters an
[58:41] idea
[58:42] but uh
[58:45] I am not making Doctrine
[58:49] in this uh
[58:52] particular
[58:54] scripture
[58:57] the prophet said they came out of Egypt
[58:59] 2 million is that right
[59:02] two million of them came out of Egypt
[59:06] Hallelujah
[59:08] you know and then they were in the
[59:12] wilderness 40 years
[59:17] 35 years ago it was only me and my wife
[59:24] and then
[59:26] today
[59:27] Hallelujah we are already 11.
[59:32] we got seven children me and my wife
[59:34] nine plus two granddaughters
[59:37] we are now 11.
[59:40] from though we became 11 in 35 years
[59:45] how many do you think Israel
[59:48] became in 40 years
[59:52] maybe some of you
[59:54] you don't want to have many children
[59:57] because you know
[1:00:00] clothing
[1:00:02] food
[1:00:03] they go to school
[1:00:06] Hallelujah but you know Israel
[1:00:09] they do not work
[1:00:11] they do not care about food God gave
[1:00:14] them food
[1:00:15] Hallelujah they do not care about their
[1:00:17] health there was no fever among them in
[1:00:21] 40 years
[1:00:22] so and then they want to to have many
[1:00:26] soldiers to fight so what's the reason
[1:00:29] to control
[1:00:31] and they were not doing anything
[1:00:35] Hallelujah
[1:00:38] I will not tell you what's in my mind
[1:00:40] but how many they were during the time
[1:00:44] but I believe there were so many
[1:00:47] Hallelujah although the the two million
[1:00:50] were killed in the wilderness because of
[1:00:53] their unbelief God destroyed them in the
[1:00:55] wilderness
[1:00:56] Alleluia but you know brothers and
[1:00:58] sisters while they were crossing and
[1:01:01] maybe some of them they were having fun

[1:01:08] pulling their animals
[1:01:11] their ship their goats and their cows
[1:01:15] and brothers and sisters they were happy
[1:01:18] because

[1:01:25] told them about how rich he was
[1:01:28] became a dry ground but now they
[1:01:31] themselves experience it
[1:01:33] they were happy
