[0:00] bless you all I won't be singing any
[0:02] songs I have learned to stay in my Lane
[0:05] and we'll do that
[0:07] perhaps we can just open with a word of
[0:09] Prayer
[0:10] Heavenly Father we thank you very much
[0:12] for your goodness and Grace do us Lord I
[0:14] just ask that you bless your word to us
[0:17] this evening father I pray that you had
[0:19] ministered in in Clarity father and that
[0:22] we would all be better founded upon your
[0:25] word Lord and we could see you more
[0:27] clearly in our lives even in areas of
[0:29] Our Lives as we hadn't seen your
[0:31] influence before Lord I pray you would
[0:32] move an us tonight in Jesus name amen
[0:36] amen you may be you may be seated
[0:41] well this last weekend
[0:43] I think about 10 of us uh brothers made
[0:45] it down to uh Tennessee for the men's
[0:49] meeting with the brother Berry and other
[0:51] brothers and it was a real uh
[0:54] real joy and a real blessing to be down
[0:56] there
[0:57] I was a a late registrant and I was I
[1:01] was glad I made it it was it was a
[1:03] blessing and we won't talk about that
[1:05] this evening but it's not to be missed
[1:08] and uh uh this evening by God's grace
[1:11] we're going to talk about um the church
[1:13] age of Smyrna this is the the first
[1:15] service will be taking on the on this
[1:18] particular Church agent uh brother
[1:20] Brandon mentioned he'd forgotten to send
[1:22] the notes out maybe that was a good
[1:23] thing because I thought man if everybody
[1:25] see as I was putting this together last
[1:27] night I have all these uh different
[1:29] historical quotes about this or that and
[1:31] I don't intend to go over everything
[1:32] literally with him if somebody's
[1:33] interested I'll put them in here and
[1:34] they want to read it can read it that
[1:36] you don't can skip over it but if you've
[1:37] read all they said men maybe I'll skip
[1:39] tonight's Services it's not a history
[1:41] lesson but uh that worked out quite fine
[1:44] but
[1:46] um I'm going to try to do um two things
[1:49] this evening if we can then I'll just
[1:50] try to keep an eye on the clock back
[1:52] there
[1:53] um I want to take time in looking at the
[1:56] conditions in the in Smyrna and that in
[2:00] that time period because Revelation
[2:01] chapter one says it's a book of Prophecy
[2:04] so the the seven churches described in
[2:07] chapters two and three aren't just
[2:08] literal Assemblies of people at the time
[2:11] of uh John and John was writing at the
[2:14] end of the first century they're also uh
[2:16] parallel conditions in different time
[2:19] periods throughout church history
[2:21] I think it's really interesting to look
[2:22] back we can look at the Ephesus and that
[2:25] was the Apostle Paul was the messenger
[2:27] there and we can see clearly what the
[2:29] Apostle Paul's message was because it's
[2:31] right in the scripture
[2:32] but as the spirit of antichrist
[2:34] gradually crept into the church it gets
[2:37] harder and harder to to trace the the
[2:40] the the the threat of Truth as it goes
[2:43] and irenius was just two steps away from
[2:48] Jesus's disciples he studied under
[2:50] polycarp who studied under John the
[2:52] Beloved so he he he has a very close
[2:56] link to what the original truth was and
[2:58] I find it very
[3:00] satisfying and and the real blessing to
[3:03] see the things that brother Branham
[3:05] taught in the 20th century
[3:08] irenius is saying the same things
[3:11] and there's some other of a battle
[3:13] between uh Church historians sometimes
[3:15] people like to make him Catholic in
[3:17] different ways and you'll see I'm trying
[3:18] to find a good graphic to put on there
[3:20] of irenius but they've all got these
[3:21] Halos over his head and I'm holding his
[3:23] hands a certain way because that's the
[3:25] way they do the crosses and the
[3:26] different masses but if you look what he
[3:28] says he wasn't Catholic the things that
[3:30] he ministers they mesh very well with
[3:33] what Paul preached and with whatever
[3:35] Brandon preached and I just wanted to
[3:37] start off with this scripture from the
[3:38] book of Jude versus verses three and
[3:41] four and Jude writes beloved when I gave
[3:44] all diligence to right unto you of the
[3:46] common salvation it was needful for me
[3:48] to write unto you and to exhort you that
[3:51] you should earnestly contend for the
[3:53] faith which was once delivered unto the
[3:55] Saints and I want to show the city that
[3:58] this is what irenius was doing ireneus
[4:00] was earnestly contending for the faith
[4:02] that was once delivered to the Saints
[4:03] because false Doctrine was creeping in
[4:05] there with great rapidness in that
[4:09] second century and brother Brandon doing
[4:11] the same thing in the 20th century we're
[4:14] doing the same now contending for that
[4:16] faith that was once delivered for the
[4:18] Saints for there are certain men crept
[4:20] in unawares who were before of old
[4:22] ordained to this condemnation ungodly
[4:24] men
[4:25] turning the grace of our God into
[4:27] lasciviousness and deny the only Lord
[4:29] God and our Lord Jesus Christ if you
[4:31] continue to read
[4:32] Jude I'm kind of thinking back to the
[4:35] session two weeks ago on the serpent
[4:37] seat talking about how this there were
[4:40] two seed lines in there and this is the
[4:42] false fines creeping in there Jude is
[4:45] giving a pretty good genealogy of how
[4:47] the false lines creeping in to the
[4:49] church and a lot of the names that he
[4:51] mentioned as being part of the false
[4:53] line brother Branham names them right
[4:55] away the gang saying of Korra Etc
[4:58] um he's following both of them are kind
[5:00] of following the trail of the sermon
[5:01] because the Judah said we need to
[5:03] contend for that faith that was
[5:04] delivered
[5:06] to the Saints
[5:08] so here we have a map of Asia Minor
[5:11] Smyrna that was the ancient name of the
[5:14] city I think it's now called it is now
[5:16] this location of the city of Izmir in in
[5:19] Turkey but Smyrna means bitter it's
[5:23] taken from the same word
[5:25] um that is for myrrh and myrrh is used
[5:27] in embalming uh the dead when they're
[5:29] making a mummy of someone
[5:31] and that's kind of what's starting to
[5:34] happen in this church Age Death is
[5:37] creeping in brother Branham says it was
[5:40] a it was a bitter age filled with death
[5:43] the two Vines within the framework of
[5:46] the church were drifting further apart
[5:48] with an increased bitterness toward the
[5:50] True Vine on the part of the false and
[5:53] he says it goes on to say death was not
[5:55] only the seed of the false Vine but even
[5:57] in the True Vine there was a creeping
[6:00] paralysis and impotence because they had
[6:03] already drifted away from the
[6:04] unadulterated truth of the first years
[6:06] after Pentecost
[6:08] and he makes this good statement No True
[6:10] Believers any stronger and spiritually
[6:12] healthy and Alive than his knowledge of
[6:15] and adherence to the pure word of God
[6:17] and that is such a battle there in that
[6:20] second Church age to continue holding on
[6:22] to the true word of God there are all
[6:23] kinds of false doctrines
[6:25] irenius he wrote a book called against
[6:28] heresies actually a series of of
[6:30] pamphlets especially against the Gnostic
[6:32] heresies and they were trying to exalt
[6:35] themselves we're special holders of
[6:36] mysteries we've got special secret
[6:38] knowledge that there's a greater than
[6:39] whatever the apostles taught and you
[6:41] have to in order to see what really
[6:42] truth is you've got to see it our way
[6:44] and have our Revelation and irenius's
[6:47] passion was bringing him right back to
[6:49] the scriptures right back to the
[6:51] scriptures and all his tracks of things
[6:53] he was writing is bringing right back to
[6:54] the scriptures and we and where we are
[6:58] now we think the scripture it's it's
[6:59] clearly acknowledged this is the Bible
[7:02] this is the second century this Canon of
[7:04] scripture the the books that are
[7:06] accepted as being inspired of God that's
[7:08] a pretty recent thing
[7:10] and armenius keeps pointing back he's
[7:13] quoting John the Beloved he's quoting
[7:16] Peter he's quoting Paul these are people
[7:18] who had just died within the last
[7:20] hundred years or so maybe not even that
[7:22] far away so he's giving these people who
[7:25] who were almost contemporaries he's
[7:27] giving them a great amount of Spiritual
[7:28] Authority and that's that's quite an
[7:30] accomplishment he's bringing them back
[7:32] toward the scripture toward what God has
[7:33] been doing
[7:34] and that's what we need to that's still
[7:36] what we need to do it's so easy to take
[7:38] our cues from Everest popular day what
[7:42] um the the things expressed in the in
[7:44] pop music and and and popular movies
[7:46] those are things we're watching they
[7:48] have an impact on how we think and what
[7:50] we think is acceptable and good but
[7:52] brother Brandon mind is no true
[7:54] believers any stronger and spiritually
[7:56] healthy and Alive than his knowledge of
[7:59] and adherence to the pure word of God
[8:00] the book of Hosea says my people are
[8:02] destroyed for lack of knowledge I think
[8:05] a lot of people today it can be said
[8:07] they could very well be destroyed
[8:09] because they have a lack of knowledge of
[8:11] God's saying it's right there but you've
[8:14] got to be willing to take it and and
[8:16] live by it
[8:18] the smyrnan age brother Branham says was
[8:20] the rain the Sun the nourishment that
[8:23] ensured the vile corruption that would
[8:25] confirmed the church in idolatry which
[8:28] went on especially in the in the
[8:30] pergamian
[8:31] age and a couple of the characters I
[8:33] just want to kind of go through
[8:35] um their I took a couple of excerpts
[8:37] from some different quotes but on the
[8:39] screen
[8:40] a couple years ago I read a couple books
[8:42] of church history I'll be quoting from
[8:43] from a couple of them
[8:45] but this book from it's called the the
[8:48] Christian tradition a history of the
[8:50] development of Doctrine this particular
[8:52] scholar says that when the apocalyptic
[8:55] Vision became less Vivid which means
[8:58] people are no longer really expecting
[9:00] the Lord to be coming they're not
[9:02] they're not an expectation of his return
[9:04] this vision of Christ soon returned
[9:07] that's fading away the church polity or
[9:10] their or their the church system is
[9:12] becoming more rigid
[9:13] what happened then he says the
[9:15] extraordinary operations of the spirit
[9:17] there were a characteristic in the early
[9:19] church diminished so basically it's
[9:21] nicolaitanism set in
[9:24] people weren't living with expecting
[9:26] Christ's return just getting into their
[9:29] Church system the spirit stopped
[9:31] operating that's what they said I just
[9:33] find this really neat um brother Brigham
[9:36] says it but it Bears it out in history
[9:38] he said go look up in histories you'll
[9:39] find it and and you do find it
[9:42] it says the decline in the
[9:44] eschatological hope the decline in the
[9:46] hope of Christ's return and the rise of
[9:49] the monarchal Episcopal the rise of
[9:51] denominationalism this is sort of
[9:53] closely interrelated phenomena brother
[9:56] Branham says the same thing if it's hard
[9:58] to accept it from Brother Brahm take
[9:59] from the church historian because that's
[10:01] what happened
[10:03] so the so the church they don't have
[10:07] um the Holy Spirit moving in their midst
[10:09] like they did they're dying so he says
[10:12] we have to validate our existence
[10:14] somehow
[10:15] do we do this and the supernatural
[10:18] brother Brandon points to the
[10:19] supernatural as a Vindication of God
[10:22] that that is a big part of it and that
[10:25] he wasn't the only one who did this
[10:26] there was a one of the first apologists
[10:29] one of the first preachers who was
[10:31] trying to defend the faith to
[10:33] non-christians
[10:34] in this case he was defending the
[10:36] Christianity against Judaism Justin
[10:37] Martyr says that Christianity is Right
[10:41] Judaism isn't because among us we still
[10:45] have prophetic gifts and they have died
[10:47] Out Among the Jews and prophetic gifts
[10:50] the movement of the Holy Spirit that's a
[10:51] that's an affirmation that Christ is
[10:53] with that God is with us
[10:55] so the church has to has to valet its
[10:58] existence somehow and they started doing
[11:00] that not by looking to the future of
[11:02] Christ's promised return
[11:05] um but they instead looked to the to the
[11:08] Past
[11:09] God was with us back then so where he's
[11:11] still going to be with us now and they
[11:13] would look through the past through a
[11:14] particular set of glasses they would
[11:16] look through the past illumined by the
[11:19] composition of the apostolic Canada
[11:21] looked by it to the by the Canon by the
[11:23] Creeds and they'll look at the past in
[11:25] that way and the app and the
[11:27] establishment of the apostolic episcopy
[11:29] which is the the system so they weren't
[11:31] looking at what God was doing
[11:34] now because God wasn't doing anything
[11:36] with him right now they weren't looking
[11:38] to what God was going to be doing in
[11:39] their future and Christ would be coming
[11:40] because they weren't living for that
[11:42] anymore they had to look what God did in
[11:45] the past
[11:46] and he says in this way the apostles
[11:48] became a sort of spiritual aristocracy
[11:52] and the promises of the New Testament on
[11:54] the coming of the Holy Spirit were
[11:55] referred primarily back to the
[11:58] Pentecostal event that's what we see
[12:00] right now happening that happened in the
[12:02] 20th century because Holy Spirit wasn't
[12:05] really moving in the churches because
[12:06] they they had a more rigid system they
[12:09] weren't an expectation of scripture
[12:11] being fulfilled they were missing it so
[12:13] the spirit stopped moving so we have to
[12:15] validate our existence another way if
[12:17] we're not seeing the holy spirit in our
[12:18] churches we'll just say he wasn't
[12:21] promised to be moving here he promised
[12:22] he promised to come in the past and he
[12:24] did and now we're just kind of got to
[12:25] hold things steady that's what happened
[12:27] then it happened now but Arrhenius was
[12:31] called it's like where the brand name is
[12:32] called and we are called to contend for
[12:34] that Faith which was once delivered to
[12:36] the Saints it's a battle that never
[12:37] stops where all God servants are always
[12:39] in the always in the trenches
[12:42] for that
[12:47] so brother Brandon this is from uh on
[12:49] page middle of page two brother Brandon
[12:51] saying these things um much more
[12:54] readable English he says but see what
[12:57] was happening back there that false Vibe
[12:59] was getting a hold and it was teaching
[13:01] that rulership by man was right it
[13:04] thought that the church had to be
[13:05] governed and thought of control over the
[13:07] people but instead of doing it God's way
[13:09] they simply took Authority and
[13:11] devastated all the spiritual power in
[13:13] their own hands and came out with a holy
[13:15] priesthood standing between God and the
[13:17] people they went right back to the old
[13:19] aaronic system and they they became
[13:22] Antichrist for they disposed of his own
[13:25] mediatorship and imposed their own
[13:28] brother Brandon actually says a lot more
[13:30] clearly we kind of put him off to the
[13:32] side so he that can be hard to
[13:34] understand but if you compare these two
[13:36] guys I'd rather brother Britain is a lot
[13:38] clearer
[13:39] um so you can see
[13:41] um this very same things that brother
[13:43] Brandon is saying in Trish historians
[13:45] say it and that it's verified by the
[13:48] Bible
[13:48] so in this as as this Sumerian church is
[13:52] death is setting in here and brother
[13:54] Branham talks about that that it was
[13:56] just he says it was the uh it was the
[13:59] the sun and the
[14:02] um
[14:03] the rain the sun and the nourishment
[14:05] that just that's fed that false Vine and
[14:08] and brought about that that corruption
[14:10] they needed the messenger to bring them
[14:12] uh to to sustain them in the truth and
[14:15] brother Brandon says I chose irenius
[14:17] because I believe that irenius was
[14:19] closer to scripture than polycarp was
[14:21] polycarpone kindly towards the Roman
[14:23] idea of setting up an organization but
[14:26] irenius was firmly against it and then
[14:28] the great issue is coming from the
[14:30] Nicene Council that God was three or one
[14:31] and irenius took the side that God was
[14:34] God now
[14:36] and just one
[14:38] and we're going to take a look at that
[14:40] it's interesting to see how irenius
[14:42] teaches about the gaunted but he's also
[14:45] Vindicated
[14:46] by his his churches were Vindicated by
[14:50] the moving of the supernatural brother
[14:52] Branson his church is in France were
[14:53] known to have the gifts of the Spirit
[14:54] among them for the Saints spoke in
[14:57] tongues they prophesied to raise the
[14:59] dead healed the sick
[15:01] he saw the danger of any kind of
[15:03] organized Brotherhood he stood solidly
[15:05] for a unified Spirit-filled gift
[15:07] manifesting local church and God honored
[15:11] him for the power of God man with the
[15:13] power of God manifested among the saints
[15:16] this is the test one that brother
[15:17] Branham tells about him and I thought
[15:19] it's really neat in this uh in this
[15:21] history does irenius described the many
[15:23] Brethren the church of his day you had
[15:25] these prophetic charismatic or gifts
[15:27] speaking in tongues by the spirit
[15:29] bringing about the secrets of men's
[15:31] hearts and the mysteries of God he had
[15:33] this historians say that brother
[15:34] Graham's not making it up this is this
[15:37] is how irenius was but you can see if
[15:39] you tried to find a picture of irenus
[15:41] he's going to look really Catholic in
[15:42] whatever picture you have but if you
[15:44] look what he taught he wasn't Catholic
[15:46] but how the church just tries to adopt
[15:49] and make him one of their Saints one of
[15:51] their great teachers but but he wasn't
[15:56] um let's see here
[15:58] um
[16:00] on on page um three you want to take a
[16:03] look at his teaching of of the godhead
[16:05] it's important that
[16:07] um he teaches the godhead from from a
[16:09] Biblical
[16:10] um perspective instead of a Greek
[16:12] philosophical perspective in the
[16:15] accounts of nicaea these Bishops gather
[16:17] together and they were thinking in very
[16:19] much
[16:20] terms of the concepts of Plato and
[16:23] Aristotle were completely foreign to the
[16:26] scripture but when irenius teaches it
[16:30] um they're in the middle of Page Three
[16:31] the picture that he uses of God is God
[16:35] moving down through history and on the
[16:39] one hand is is is the sun working in the
[16:42] other hand is the holy spirit these are
[16:44] the two hands how God works with man but
[16:47] it's all one person you don't have
[16:50] multiple people so if person's in the
[16:53] godhead but you have God who manifest
[16:55] himself one way and manifest himself the
[16:57] other way but it's one God
[17:00] irenius doesn't doesn't deviate from
[17:04] that and if you think back when we
[17:07] talked about the godhead back in the
[17:09] spring
[17:09] I was we talked about how some how the
[17:13] doctrine of the Trinity might trade it's
[17:14] almost like they're trying to dissect
[17:16] God where is the holy spirit right now
[17:18] and this is this this is the holy
[17:19] spirit's baileywick this is God the
[17:22] father's section this is God the son
[17:25] section they just got to stay right
[17:26] there but it's not that way it's like
[17:28] trying to find the nuclear the the
[17:30] electron in an atom I mean it it defies
[17:34] uh uh uh it it defies a precision
[17:38] well Irene is when he he wanted to
[17:41] emphasize
[17:42] um how his teaching of the godhead
[17:44] focused on how God reveals himself to
[17:47] man over time
[17:48] and that's really how the Jews knew God
[17:51] that's how the Jews talked about God how
[17:54] God made himself known and it was all
[17:56] about how God was armenius called it
[17:59] recapitulation putting putting the right
[18:02] head back on the back on the body
[18:04] putting the right headship on everything
[18:06] and restoring that that was the idea how
[18:08] it was all God the godhead was revealed
[18:11] now God brought salvation back to man
[18:14] and that that's a very Jewish way of of
[18:17] looking at a very biblical way of
[18:18] looking at it so brother Braham says he
[18:21] he teaches a Biblical concept of the god
[18:23] and he's and he's right on there
[18:25] and in the true in the revelation of
[18:27] Jesus Christ series brother Branham
[18:29] quotes from him
[18:30] and it's in the middle of Page Three but
[18:33] he he he he lists a bunch of titles of
[18:36] God but he says all these titles are
[18:38] summed up into one name under one God
[18:40] they're only titles of what he was
[18:42] there's just one God and his and his
[18:45] name is one
[18:46] so I didn't want to belabor um these
[18:49] historical or documental points but I
[18:52] think it's really neat because if we
[18:53] Trace our spiritual genealogy back it
[18:57] runs right through irenius and what
[18:59] brother Branham taught was taught by
[19:01] Paul or by arenius but after then it
[19:05] starts getting fuzzy sometimes because
[19:06] Antichrist has gone so far in that
[19:10] everybody almost was teaching the
[19:11] Trinity everybody was even people who
[19:13] God was using to restore certain things
[19:16] but you can go back Paul thought Paul
[19:18] taught in a certain way Irene is taught
[19:21] it the same way and that has been
[19:22] restored you see because Malachi 4 talks
[19:25] about how there's going to be a
[19:26] restoration of the faith of uh of of the
[19:30] fathers of the church fathers to the
[19:32] children living today that's promised a
[19:35] restoration of that faith and we can go
[19:37] back and see what was that faith that
[19:39] Paul had the other Church fathers had
[19:41] and that's what's been restored which to
[19:44] me gives me even greater value for what
[19:47] we have
[19:48] well irenius wasn't just a teacher he
[19:52] was also a pastor we're going to take a
[19:54] look in just a minute to this message to
[19:57] the church in Smyrna in Revelation
[19:59] chapter 2.
[20:01] his um his church was in Leon
[20:06] France at that time there was no France
[20:09] the Roman Empire it conquered part of a
[20:11] Gaul there and that um one of the the
[20:14] city lagun dunum with the yellow
[20:17] rectangle around it that is what was
[20:19] modern day Leon
[20:21] and the people of Lyon they uh they
[20:24] these These are pagans and they don't
[20:27] appreciate the Christians that are there
[20:29] because the Christians don't participate
[20:31] in the Pagan Feasts
[20:34] the first Christians were actually
[20:35] called atheists because the Christians
[20:38] only believed in one God they didn't
[20:40] believe in all the other gods so
[20:41] Christians were atheists because they
[20:43] don't believe in all the other gods
[20:45] um and there was one season where in
[20:48] this portion of Gaul there was a bad
[20:50] Harvest and
[20:53] these uh Pagan peoples around the area
[20:55] they started trying to find what could
[20:56] be the reason for the bad Harvest and
[20:58] maybe it's these folks these strange
[21:00] people different people they don't
[21:03] worship Our God they don't offer the
[21:04] sacrifices maybe they're the reason
[21:07] and once it came time for this
[21:09] particular Festival
[21:11] um
[21:12] this this was the the people had
[21:15] convinced the Pagan to convince
[21:16] themselves that the reasons for this
[21:18] drought it's because the gods are
[21:21] furious with these folks these
[21:23] Christians who aren't worshiping them
[21:24] and these long-existing prejudices
[21:27] escalate into a full-scale riot the
[21:31] Pagan residents assaulted Christians
[21:33] dragging them to the Public Square
[21:35] Christians were condemned they were
[21:38] executed in the public Arena the current
[21:41] Bishop of Leon his name was potenus he
[21:44] died in prison and irenius was a way
[21:48] traveling
[21:49] when this tragedy occurred and he hears
[21:52] about it and afterwards he goes he goes
[21:55] back and he becomes the pastor of Leon
[21:59] and here's what one writer talks about
[22:02] mentions is when he returned the
[22:05] questions facing him were urgent and
[22:07] complex
[22:08] while the faith of some of the survivors
[22:10] had been strengthened through the
[22:12] persecution many others were wearied by
[22:15] the struggle
[22:16] the taunts of their fellow citizens
[22:18] questioning where their God was
[22:21] we're still fresh
[22:23] and this he's got to deal with the very
[22:26] real questions of suffering
[22:31] we believe that Jesus Christ the same
[22:33] yesterday today and forever we believe
[22:34] that the God who protected his people
[22:36] back in the Old Testament is the same
[22:38] God today but for some reason
[22:42] my fellow Believers my friends got
[22:44] killed in that Riot and I'm left where
[22:46] was God
[22:47] that's a very suffering is a very real
[22:50] question and he's called to handle that
[22:53] and then we all know where we all we all
[22:56] go through the suffering of some kind or
[22:58] other and it's very it's very tempting
[23:00] to listen to The Voice the devil asking
[23:03] where was your God just now
[23:05] where was he what did you do wrong
[23:07] you've been abandoned all those
[23:09] questions are are competing for air time
[23:12] in our mind
[23:13] and that's the situation that Arenas
[23:15] came back to he was not only writing
[23:17] against the gnostics as as a teacher he
[23:20] wasn't living in some Ivory Tower doing
[23:22] that he was getting his feet dirty his
[23:24] hands are there on the ground trying to
[23:26] trying to comfort grieving grieving
[23:28] hearts
[23:30] but if we look at Revelation chapter
[23:31] chapter 2
[23:33] and we'll see
[23:35] um
[23:36] well it's interesting as as
[23:39] Christ begins to speak to this smyrnian
[23:42] church how he begins he says unto the
[23:44] angel of the church in Smyrna right
[23:46] these things Seth the first and the last
[23:50] which was dead and is alive
[23:53] and I've mentioned before how Christ
[23:55] introduces himself to each age
[23:58] he's he's
[24:00] emphasizing attributes of himself that
[24:03] that particular age is going to need
[24:06] and here you have the first and the last
[24:08] I'm I I started I ended the devil might
[24:11] think he has the last word but he
[24:14] doesn't
[24:15] I'm the first I'm the last later in the
[24:18] letter cnha identifies itself as the
[24:21] amen he has the last word the devil
[24:24] thinks is but but he doesn't so in our
[24:26] trials also in this middle part as we're
[24:28] going through the trials we think the
[24:29] devil's got the last word that we're not
[24:31] going to see the light of day ever again
[24:33] but Christ promises I am the last I will
[24:36] get you through and you'll make it
[24:38] through
[24:39] he who was dead and is alive if anybody
[24:42] has suffered
[24:43] it was Christ
[24:45] and Christ is coming not as one who was
[24:47] alive and is dead that's the usual the
[24:49] little way of things but he was dead and
[24:52] is alive he's come through the suffering
[24:54] he's shown that going through suffering
[24:56] you you you you you win character you
[24:59] and then you receive Glory suffering in
[25:01] glory suffering character and Glory are
[25:04] inseparably linked you cannot get
[25:07] character without suffering you cannot
[25:09] get Glory that lasts without suffering
[25:12] the devil does everything he can in this
[25:15] life to give you a sense of Glory
[25:18] and you can think about what does a what
[25:21] does a nice computer game where you're
[25:22] you're you're you're trying to battle uh
[25:25] I'm trying I like I like strategy games
[25:27] my son plays one every now and sometimes
[25:29] I'll do something with them too I want
[25:31] to conquer the goals with my ancient
[25:33] Roman I I finally win I've got yes I won
[25:35] the battle I feel this glorious sense
[25:37] all these endorphins are just rushing
[25:40] through me I've I've I've won the battle
[25:43] but that is a pretty cheap version of
[25:46] Victory and Glory that the screen goes
[25:49] hurray hurray you won 840 points in
[25:51] Europe this number on on the record it's
[25:54] it's a pretty cheap version of Glory to
[25:56] what God promises when you really get
[25:58] out and go through a real trial
[26:01] and you really push on through then you
[26:04] get character
[26:06] you can have the luxury to restart
[26:07] anything you just press on press on
[26:10] press on you win a great you you win
[26:12] true character and you get an
[26:13] everlasting Glory this glory on the
[26:16] computer screen is going to fade away
[26:17] they make sure it does you have to come
[26:19] back for the next endorphin rush and the
[26:21] next it's going to fade away but the
[26:23] glory that that you win by overcoming
[26:26] trial overcoming sin that's an
[26:28] everlasting Glory it's not going to fade
[26:30] away and it's not going to crash it's
[26:33] not going to lose your the archive of
[26:35] all your victories it's always there you
[26:37] have a name you have your place reserved
[26:39] in heaven Christ keeps a record of all
[26:41] those victories that will never be wiped
[26:43] out no computer crash can take the place
[26:45] of it he introduces himself though I'm
[26:49] the first and the last who was dead and
[26:51] is alive I came through it and I am here
[26:54] with you to make sure that you come
[26:57] through it too because Christ in chapter
[26:58] one he shows John this vision of this of
[27:02] this golden lamp stand John looks at it
[27:05] and he sees the one walking through it
[27:08] who's likely to the son of man Christ is
[27:11] with the church walking through the
[27:13] golden Lampkin not just in the past in
[27:15] Ephesus or in Smyrna but still today
[27:18] when there's so much darkness in the
[27:21] church there's it's all Darkness but
[27:23] Christ is still here to make sure that
[27:26] we can also win our Crown of Glory
[27:31] so the question of suffering the first
[27:33] thing he says I I I know
[27:38] I've been through it as well but I also
[27:40] I know what you're going through I know
[27:42] your works
[27:44] and your tribulation
[27:46] and your poverty
[27:48] and here brother Ben emphasizes these
[27:51] folks they're they're at the bottom
[27:53] levels of society most of the Christians
[27:55] in the early church were slaves
[27:59] most of them were slaves they had
[28:00] material poverty no material wealth at
[28:04] all
[28:05] they weren't living for that they had a
[28:07] completely different value system it was
[28:09] oriented toward Eternal rewards that's
[28:12] why he says I know you're poverty I know
[28:13] the difficulty it is to make ends meet
[28:15] and everything like that I know your
[28:17] poverty but you know what really you're
[28:20] rich
[28:21] really you're rich and it can get so
[28:24] easy to get caught up in the rat race of
[28:27] everyday life thing I've got to have the
[28:28] best this the best this the best this
[28:32] but you know what the greatest riches
[28:35] are going to be the Eternal riches it
[28:36] doesn't mean we have to sell our houses
[28:37] and live in tents in the backyard and
[28:39] and really rough it we don't have to do
[28:40] that but where is our Focus what are we
[28:43] working towards
[28:45] I know the blasphemy of them would say
[28:48] they are Jews and are not by the
[28:49] synagogue of Satan here they're they're
[28:51] they're they're saying they're Jews
[28:52] they're saying that we really know what
[28:54] the the truth is
[28:56] um but they're not they're they're not
[28:58] uh they don't have the truth or the
[28:59] synagogue of Satan the ones who really
[29:01] have the truth are the ones who are
[29:02] following me
[29:06] and then he says uh fear none of these
[29:08] those things that you will suffer the
[29:09] devil shall cast of you into prison
[29:12] that you may be tried
[29:14] and ye shall have tribulation ten days
[29:16] where the Brahman Associates this with
[29:18] the 10-year persecution by emperor
[29:20] Diocletian but I will give you a but be
[29:24] thou Faith one to death and I will give
[29:26] you a Crown of Life
[29:28] with suffering there will always be
[29:30] glory linked you can't have that Crown
[29:33] of Life without first going through
[29:34] suffering there is no shortcut the devil
[29:38] will give you all kinds of options to
[29:40] have an easier way there is no easier
[29:44] way not at all
[29:46] he did it happen here let him hear what
[29:48] the spirit says to the churches Heath to
[29:50] overcometh will not be heard of the
[29:52] second death
[29:53] there's one theme that runs through this
[29:56] message to the Church of Smyrna and that
[29:58] suffering it's tribulation it's all
[30:00] there
[30:01] and um brother Bram says it's not just
[30:03] Smyrna that's for every age but I just
[30:06] want to take a look at this at this
[30:08] question that the people of Leon were
[30:11] struggling with after all of their after
[30:13] many of their brothers and sisters had
[30:15] been hauled away their pastor potennis
[30:19] had had died in jail I think where is
[30:22] God
[30:23] and the and this is uh have to stop and
[30:26] give us ask this question this is this
[30:29] is a classic question people ask how can
[30:31] God be both loving and Powerful if he
[30:34] permits so much suffering because yes we
[30:37] believe in a God who does love us we
[30:40] believe in a God who is powerful and if
[30:42] he were so powerful
[30:43] couldn't he stop the suffering
[30:46] but he doesn't he says the sufferings
[30:49] for our Goods I'm doing it because I
[30:50] love you but how can you have both of
[30:52] these and that's very hard to reconcile
[30:55] they kind of um make the argument like
[30:57] this say a uh a loving person won't
[31:00] permit others to suffer
[31:03] that's that's kind of the first step in
[31:04] that thinking and then
[31:06] but God does permit suffering
[31:09] so if a loving person has a friend
[31:11] others to suffer and God does promote
[31:12] suffering the conclusion then is that
[31:15] God must not be a loving person that's
[31:17] that's the that's the mental trap that
[31:20] runs in
[31:21] but in this critique in this deductive
[31:25] reasoning the only way to stop a
[31:26] deductive argument is to look at the
[31:28] assumptions are the assumptions right
[31:29] here the Assumption as a loving person
[31:31] won't permit others to suffer is that is
[31:35] that true is it true that a loving
[31:37] person would never purposefully inflict
[31:40] pain on another person
[31:42] the other assumption is that good
[31:44] feelings are one of the surest
[31:45] indicators of someone's love
[31:48] they can accompany it but is that the
[31:50] surest indicator
[31:52] and we have to have to agree if there's
[31:55] a God which I believe there is but his
[31:58] ability to understand and comprehend the
[32:00] purpose of things are much higher than
[32:01] mine because God's thoughts are not my
[32:03] thoughts his ways are higher than my
[32:05] ways and I just thought an example like
[32:08] this
[32:10] little child with lots of cavities
[32:13] eating a root canal or something is this
[32:15] child having a pleasant experience in
[32:17] the dentist's chair
[32:19] is there a loving parent who is
[32:22] willfully allowing a dentist to inflict
[32:25] some pain on his child
[32:28] he is could you say then that this
[32:30] parent is unloving
[32:33] no you couldn't and I can I kind of
[32:35] thought of this when my wife took job to
[32:38] the dentist for the first time in
[32:39] Holland he said he lay on the chair
[32:42] pretty willingly and that that went just
[32:44] fine but as soon as he got off the chair
[32:46] and then watched Mama lie on the chair
[32:48] it must have been a terrible experience
[32:50] for my wife I think it was a once in a
[32:52] lifetime but as soon as the dinner
[32:54] started working on her teeth
[32:56] he just
[32:57] screaming in this office what is the
[33:01] dentist doing to my mom it was a it was
[33:03] she it was I mean I think he really
[33:06] worked very fast to get it done but the
[33:08] kid has no idea what's actually going on
[33:13] and that's kind of like us compared to
[33:15] God we've got peanut brains we can't
[33:18] comprehend what is the purpose of me
[33:21] being in this dentist chair what's the
[33:23] purpose of my mom being in this in this
[33:25] chair what's this guy who's prod this
[33:27] this hurts the pain that I'm
[33:28] experiencing now and the here and now I
[33:31] I know it that is much greater than
[33:34] anything that might come in the future
[33:36] that this could be good for
[33:38] we can't understand why God does things
[33:40] and and the moment that we go through
[33:42] them just like the kid I can convince
[33:44] this kid you've got to go to the dentist
[33:46] you've got to you've got to let them
[33:48] pull this tooth I know it hurts I know
[33:49] you're scared but you've got I love you
[33:51] honey I'll hold your hand while he's
[33:53] doing it I will do it but it's for your
[33:56] good no this is not for me for my God
[34:00] I wanna I wanna I want sweet mama
[34:03] kid'll say and that's what we that's how
[34:06] we react in our trials when we don't
[34:08] understand say God I've got to
[34:10] understand before I ever get in that
[34:11] dentist chair I've got to understand why
[34:13] before I ever accept my trial well we've
[34:16] got that kind of idea we're like this
[34:17] little bratty kid
[34:20] but we just have to trust God
[34:24] the only way we can we have to cheat he
[34:27] is a loving heavenly father I don't
[34:29] understand it now but I will stay in
[34:31] this dentist chair as long as it takes
[34:33] or because I believe that if it doesn't
[34:35] if you don't take this tooth out it's
[34:37] going to hurt a lot worse later
[34:40] so
[34:41] there I asked the question is there a
[34:44] scenario where loving parents might
[34:46] allow their children to experience pain
[34:48] there are some scenarios we have one of
[34:51] them there are there scenarios where a
[34:53] loving God
[34:55] might allow us to experience pain too
[35:02] there are
[35:04] will we understand all of them
[35:06] no now this kid might grow up and years
[35:09] later think yeah it really was for my
[35:12] good that mom did that I wish it could
[35:14] have been other way but it was for my
[35:16] good it might take a few years for that
[35:17] child to come to that mature assessment
[35:20] and it might take oftentimes it takes us
[35:22] many years before we can look back to
[35:24] yeah
[35:25] God really did mean it for my best and
[35:28] I'll accept it
[35:29] it does happen that way but will it
[35:32] happen that way in every single thing
[35:34] probably not
[35:37] we always we continue to trust the Lord
[35:39] and He Who has been good with good for
[35:42] me in the past will be good for me in
[35:43] the present I will trust him tomorrow
[35:45] that's all I can do and there are many
[35:48] aspects to pain and suffering I'm just
[35:50] looking at one of them right now but I
[35:52] hope we can see that
[35:54] suffering is can be for a purpose and we
[35:58] and as Christians we can trust that God
[36:00] has all things under control there's no
[36:02] other way to live our lives it's true we
[36:04] can look back and see that
[36:08] what is the basis for um the the basis
[36:13] for knowing um that God loves us it's
[36:16] not uh the loving feelings though we
[36:19] have those sometimes but brother Branham
[36:21] says the basis of God's love is election
[36:24] that God chose us
[36:28] um in the church age book The Lord God
[36:30] Almighty says I know
[36:34] we I I know you were crying there in the
[36:36] dentist chair I was holding you you
[36:38] might not have real you might not have
[36:40] always uh you might you might not
[36:42] remember it now you might remember only
[36:44] the tears and the screaming but I was
[36:46] there holding your hand too you didn't
[36:48] realize all you could feel was the pain
[36:49] of the moment that kids only screaming
[36:52] but mama was right there with you God's
[36:55] right there with us do we might always
[36:56] we might not always see it because we're
[36:58] so focused on the pain we're going
[37:00] through but God's with us and he will
[37:02] never leave us nor for sagas and
[37:05] oftentimes later on God will let us look
[37:07] back and then he'll open our eyes so
[37:09] that we can see that he was there with
[37:10] us and then that brings a healing and
[37:13] the rest and oh if we could just live
[37:16] our lives trusting him because when we
[37:19] don't when we don't see that he's there
[37:21] and we accept the devil's life that he's
[37:23] not there
[37:24] then we're experiencing a double pain
[37:26] we're experiencing the pain of the trial
[37:28] then the emotional pain that God's
[37:31] rejected me I'm abandoned
[37:34] so the trial is something that God puts
[37:36] in their lives but when we forget that
[37:38] he's there with us when he speaks to
[37:41] Smyrna this church and tribulation he
[37:42] says I'm here
[37:45] I'm the first and the last he that was
[37:48] dead and is alive I'm with you fear not
[37:50] he should I I'm right there but if the
[37:53] devil can get our eyes off of God and
[37:55] just on our trial we don't have just the
[37:57] pain of the trial we have this deep
[38:00] sharp pain in the heart God's not
[38:02] that's a lie though because he is with
[38:05] you but you're you're choosing them to
[38:08] accept the belief this as he's not and
[38:10] then when you do that when we do that
[38:12] our pain increases exponentially where
[38:15] does that pain come from we blame that
[38:17] pain on God but that pain comes from
[38:21] Satan
[38:22] because he's getting us to believe a lie
[38:25] but the Lord God says I know there he is
[38:28] walking in the midst of his people
[38:30] but does he hold back the persecution
[38:32] does he stem the tide of trivia does he
[38:35] stem the tribulation no he does not
[38:40] he simply says I know your tribulation I
[38:44] know everything I know every ounce of
[38:46] pain you're going through I've been
[38:48] there I've been through that what a
[38:51] stumbling block this is to many people
[38:52] even still today like Israel they wonder
[38:55] if God really loves them how can God be
[38:57] just and loving if he stands by watches
[39:00] his people suffer and um at this point
[39:04] he quotes from Malachi chapter 1
[39:07] where the burden of the word of the Lord
[39:08] Israel by Malachi I have loved you saith
[39:12] the Lord yet the people of Israel say
[39:14] how if you loved us you got to be
[39:16] kidding me you say you love this baloney
[39:18] how have you loved us God
[39:21] and God's responses wasn't Esau Jacob's
[39:24] brother said the Lord yet I love Jacob
[39:28] I didn't choose he so I hate to do so I
[39:31] laid his Mountain his Heritage waste for
[39:32] the dragons of the Wilderness where is
[39:34] Esau's people today where's Jerusalem
[39:36] you guys just rebuilt your temple walls
[39:39] groups are are all are all rebuilt as
[39:41] well that's a sign of my love I chose
[39:43] you I am faithful where is Esau today
[39:45] he's not there my love is elective you
[39:49] see they could not figure out God's love
[39:52] they thought that love meant no
[39:54] suffering like a lot of us we really
[39:56] want to believe that they thought that
[39:59] they thought that love meant a baby with
[40:01] parental care it's okay
[40:03] but God wants to bring us from a baby to
[40:06] letting this kid walk sometimes when the
[40:08] kid learns to walk fall flat on their
[40:10] face all kinds of uh scuffed up knees
[40:13] scuffed up arms broken bones why because
[40:17] they've got to learn to do things on
[40:18] their own so they can be building
[40:20] strength and endurance and that's a it's
[40:23] a mom and dad who love their kids enough
[40:26] let them get scuffed up still be able to
[40:28] live their lives later
[40:30] God said his love was elective love the
[40:32] proof of his love is election that no
[40:35] matter what happened his love was proven
[40:37] truly by the fact that they were chosen
[40:39] unto salvation
[40:42] he may commit you to death as he did
[40:43] Paul
[40:45] he may commit to just suffering as a job
[40:47] that's his prerogative
[40:49] he's Sovereign but it is all with a
[40:53] purpose
[40:55] all with a purpose
[40:57] if he did not have a purpose and he
[40:59] would be the author of frustration and
[41:01] not not of Peace his purpose is that
[41:03] after we have suffered a while we would
[41:06] be made perfect established strengthened
[41:09] settled that's his purpose and the
[41:11] purposes of God will not be defeated
[41:13] they will not
[41:15] and then I just want to go through a
[41:17] series of scriptures brother Brandon
[41:19] quotes these in the church age book but
[41:21] they just show how strongly linked
[41:23] suffering character and Glory are you
[41:27] they can't be separated
[41:29] and Jesus learned obedience by the
[41:32] things which he suffered
[41:35] and we we acquire we acquire character
[41:39] we gain character by the things that we
[41:41] suffer we learn to be obedient to God by
[41:43] the things that we suffer
[41:46] not like this First Peter 1 6 and 7.
[41:49] there's a key phrase if need be
[41:51] you greatly Rejoice now in all the
[41:53] blessings of God that was described in
[41:55] the previous verse
[41:56] though now for a season if need be
[42:00] you're in heaviness through manifold
[42:02] temptations that means if you're going
[42:05] through manifold Temptations only
[42:06] because God said it's needed
[42:09] he's not going to do unnecessary he's
[42:11] not he's not a god of unnecessary
[42:13] suffering he's not a massive because
[42:14] he's not going to be making a suffer
[42:16] just because he likes to see us suffer
[42:18] no he only will only go through trials
[42:20] Temptations and tribulations if need be
[42:23] he's not going to waste suffering it's
[42:26] only if there's a purpose
[42:28] and look at what's on the other end of
[42:32] that suffering that the trial of your
[42:34] faith being much more precious and of
[42:37] gold that perisheth they'll be Tried by
[42:39] a fire might be found in the praise and
[42:41] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[42:42] Jesus Christ
[42:43] it's there
[42:46] I just kind of think people are an
[42:48] entrepreneur is willing to go through a
[42:51] lot of pain and suffering it's not easy
[42:53] establishing your own business we've got
[42:55] some people who've established their own
[42:57] businesses here probably it's not easy
[42:58] it's people I want to try it most of
[43:01] these businesses fail within a couple
[43:02] years
[43:03] it's not easy they go if you listen to
[43:06] them talk to why would anybody want to
[43:08] have their own business it's a lot of
[43:10] hard work but why do they do it because
[43:12] of the hope of of being incredibly
[43:16] successful later and it's kind of like
[43:18] why do we go through this why are we
[43:20] willing to go through all these
[43:22] spiritual tribulations and suffering
[43:24] because there is a hope of a great
[43:26] reward that won't fade away
[43:28] that entrepreneurs is going to do is
[43:31] going to it's going to do a lot of
[43:33] really hard work that a lot of people
[43:34] choose not to do because they don't
[43:35] trust Social Security they won't have an
[43:37] a retirement that fateth not away
[43:40] and the Christian we're willing to go
[43:43] through suffering because we want a
[43:45] retirement that's out of this world that
[43:47] isn't ever going to be affected by any
[43:49] economic downturn that's why we that's
[43:51] why we do it but God only brings these
[43:54] on their life if need be
[43:57] right and I like how Peter engages with
[44:00] our reluctance to allow suffering into
[44:03] our thoughts his beloved think it not
[44:06] strange considering the fiery trial
[44:08] which is to try you I think fiery trial
[44:11] this is not this is not what I expected
[44:13] in my day this is a strange thing fire
[44:14] no no
[44:16] fire trials that's just that's the run
[44:18] of the mill that's what happens every
[44:19] day don't think it's strange if you've
[44:21] got fiery trials he's telling us that
[44:23] don't think it's strange as though some
[44:25] strange thing happened to you no fiery
[44:28] trials that's just all the day's work
[44:30] for a Son of God don't think it's a
[44:32] strange thing but instead rejoice in as
[44:36] much as you are partakers of Christ's
[44:38] sufferings but we're going through a
[44:39] hard time we are do we're going to the
[44:42] same experience as Christ we've got our
[44:43] shoulder to the wheel and he's got his
[44:45] shoulder to the wheel with us we're
[44:47] going to the very same things as Christ
[44:50] did that when his glory shall be
[44:53] revealed you may also be glad that
[44:55] exceeding Joy because you will be if you
[44:58] share in the suffering you'll share in
[45:00] the glory think about the old Fable The
[45:03] Little Red Hen
[45:05] how many animals in the barnyard are
[45:06] willing to share in the suffering no
[45:09] they weren't but they all wanted to
[45:11] share and the uh and the cornbread that
[45:14] was made the other day we all want to
[45:16] get we're all like those animals in the
[45:18] Barnard none of us want to be cooking
[45:20] and working throughout the day we don't
[45:21] go through the suffering but we all want
[45:22] the reward at the end
[45:24] but like what Peter says don't think
[45:25] it's strange no
[45:27] fiery trials Open Your Door you see
[45:29] those Devils right out there no all the
[45:31] days work go right at it that's what he
[45:33] says
[45:35] my brother encountered all joy when he
[45:38] followed the diverse Temptations a long
[45:39] time ago there was an Adventure in
[45:41] Odyssey
[45:42] that had this theme of counted all joy
[45:45] and I remember one of the characters
[45:46] Connie Kendall took it to heart whenever
[45:48] anybody had a hard time and said well
[45:50] count it all joy
[45:51] and my brother listen to that session of
[45:54] all this and he really took it to heart
[45:55] and he said it's something bad happened
[45:57] gathered all joy rap counted all joy mom
[46:00] and that got really old fast people say
[46:03] count it all joy the alarm goes off all
[46:06] capital Joy
[46:07] um yeah got to take this with a grain of
[46:09] salt
[46:10] Rejoice is them to do rejoice and weep
[46:12] with them that weep and all things we're
[46:13] going to count it all joy because when
[46:16] you follow the diverse Temptations do
[46:17] count it all joy knowing this
[46:20] at the trying of your faith worketh
[46:22] patience it's like we know it here
[46:25] we don't really always feel it is going
[46:27] to work patience patience is a good
[46:29] thing patients bring character character
[46:32] allows me to be a partaker of Christ
[46:33] Glory
[46:35] we're going to go on through here
[46:36] but let patients have her perfect work
[46:39] that you may be perfect an entire
[46:41] wanting nothing
[46:43] and here's where you kind of get in the
[46:45] thing
[46:46] let patients have her perfect work okay
[46:48] I can get my and get myself up for the
[46:50] trial I can convince myself yes I got to
[46:52] get in the dental chair I'll go ahead
[46:54] and do it
[46:55] but we got to stay we have to stay in
[46:57] the dental chair until God says we're
[47:00] done
[47:01] it's the hard part
[47:03] I can go to a I can go to a convention
[47:06] and get oh I can get I can get in the
[47:09] atmosphere I can get in this verse say
[47:10] yes this trial is God's will for my life
[47:13] and I'm going to let him have his way by
[47:15] Praise the Lord amen let him have his
[47:17] way so I get back I sit back down and
[47:20] I'm going to accept this trial it's not
[47:22] a strange thing I'm an accountant Joy
[47:24] I'll do I'll let the dentist have his
[47:26] way but then I said I want to jump right
[47:29] out of the chair because let patience
[47:31] have her perfect work
[47:33] don't jump out of don't jump off God's
[47:36] offering operating table until he says
[47:39] you're done
[47:40] otherwise you're just going to prolong
[47:42] the agony prolong the pain don't jump
[47:44] off God's table until he's done with you
[47:51] Romans 8 17-18 and if children then
[47:54] heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with
[47:57] Christ if so be that if so be that we
[48:00] suffer with them that we may be also
[48:02] glorified together
[48:03] this Band of Brothers that we we hear
[48:06] about from World War II they're Band of
[48:07] Brothers they went through all the
[48:09] suffering together you know what we when
[48:12] we're when we press through trials with
[48:13] the Lord we're a Band of Brothers also
[48:16] one of our brothers is Jesus Christ he's
[48:18] with us also
[48:19] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[48:22] present time are not worthy to be
[48:24] compared with the glory which shall be
[48:27] revealed in US you can't even put our
[48:30] trials and God's glory in the same
[48:31] sentence
[48:33] they're not even worthy to be put side
[48:35] by side
[48:36] will we talk about our trials they're on
[48:38] the other side I don't know we might
[48:39] think what is there even to talk about I
[48:42] don't care about that anymore I want to
[48:44] talk about what the glory of God's here
[48:46] and he's going to be such an amazing
[48:48] thing to look at Revelation 21 he wipes
[48:51] all tears from their eyes they never
[48:52] think back don't even remember it
[48:54] because
[48:55] it's not even worthy to be what are we
[48:57] talking about it's like after you've had
[48:59] an argument with somebody then you've
[49:01] and then you've apologized you made
[49:03] everything good I'm not talking about
[49:05] that anymore because it's not it's not
[49:06] worthy to compare with the Oneness and
[49:09] the joy and the unity that we feel now
[49:11] it's all passed away it's in in the sea
[49:13] of God's fear and get for us and that
[49:15] sea of God's forgive us is sometimes for
[49:17] us right now it's kind of an abstract
[49:19] concept we we want it to exist we want
[49:21] to have that but we still have the
[49:23] thoughts when we're on the other side
[49:25] it's gone we don't we don't want to go
[49:28] back to it even the best things of this
[49:31] life are nothing compared to the next
[49:34] life
[49:35] and you know what the challenge is to
[49:37] live our life that way it really is
[49:43] does he love us oh yes but how shall we
[49:47] know we shall know because he said so
[49:52] he said so
[49:54] that's all the proof We need he said so
[50:01] of course there's somebody else who's
[50:02] trying to get us to tune into His Radio
[50:05] dial he's always saying no he doesn't no
[50:07] he doesn't no he doesn't who are we
[50:10] going to listen to
[50:11] who are we going to listen to if we
[50:12] listen to to Satan our our pain is going
[50:15] to increase exponentially because he's
[50:18] the one who brings this feeling of
[50:19] Abandonment and rejection that is not
[50:21] true but brings the pain but just
[50:23] remember he said so he said so I'm going
[50:27] to hold fast to that
[50:30] he said so and manifested that he did
[50:33] love us for he brought us to himself and
[50:36] gave us of the spirit placing us as Sons
[50:38] I used to encourage you brothers and
[50:39] sisters never forget your own testimony
[50:43] don't stop telling your own testimony
[50:46] because as soon as what is the most
[50:48] commonly story told in the Bible it's a
[50:51] story about the children of Israel going
[50:52] out of Egypt
[50:53] again and again and again and again and
[50:58] again why
[51:00] so they would never forget it it's the
[51:02] that establishes them as being God's
[51:05] choice you guys were slaves in Egypt
[51:07] nothing desirable about you but I went
[51:10] and plucked you out and I chose you and
[51:12] let all those Egyptians just drown to
[51:14] the Sea
[51:15] that's evidence of God's love it says
[51:18] how shall I he manifests that he did
[51:20] love us go back and look if you're
[51:22] wondering does God love me what has God
[51:25] done for you in your life has he has he
[51:27] started to work in you have you ever
[51:28] heard God's voice if he has the
[51:31] scripture from Philippians says he who
[51:33] has begun a good work in you he's not
[51:35] going to leave it halfway finished he
[51:37] will finish it God does love you because
[51:40] he started the work God doesn't start to
[51:42] work with somebody he hasn't chosen if
[51:44] he started the work you're chosen and
[51:46] keep on going as though you are the
[51:48] devil wants you to you're the chosen the
[51:51] devil might believe it more than you do
[51:52] and he wants you to forget it so you go
[51:54] through life just all so defeated so
[51:56] defeated no you are chosen stand up like
[51:59] a strong sin of God and press forward
[52:00] because you are chosen God does love us
[52:04] and how can we prove our love to him
[52:07] by believing what he said
[52:10] not by being the perfect Christian
[52:13] not by doing all these good works just
[52:16] believe what I said
[52:19] and go forward conducting yourself with
[52:21] joy amidst the trials that he and his
[52:24] wisdom allow us to come to pass this is
[52:27] deserving of the refrigerator by
[52:29] believing what he said and by conducting
[52:31] myself with joy amidst the trials when
[52:34] we can conduct ourselves with joy in its
[52:36] trials that is so much easier said than
[52:38] done but when we can do that we're
[52:41] showing our trust in them we're showing
[52:43] our love in them and we're also showing
[52:45] that he's sustaining us because we can't
[52:46] do that on our own
[52:50] I just wanted to spend my last uh 10
[52:52] minutes or so
[52:54] um
[52:55] kind of looking at why God show revealed
[52:59] himself to Smyrna first
[53:01] as they go through their trials he shows
[53:03] himself as I'm the god who's with you in
[53:05] the trial I'm the first the last he was
[53:07] dead and is alive
[53:10] the pain we experience like I said the
[53:12] pain we experience in Trials is
[53:14] increased when we believe the devil's
[53:16] lies about our sufferings
[53:19] and then Congress that we experience
[53:22] comfort in Trials when we believe the
[53:25] truth or actually and we are able then
[53:27] to go conducting ourselves with joy as
[53:29] we believe the truth
[53:31] now we may think
[53:33] that events in our lives adversity
[53:37] directly determines what consequences we
[53:40] suffer we look back to because this
[53:42] happened to me that's why I am today
[53:46] this adverse situation that came up
[53:48] that's what the problem is that's what
[53:51] caused this thing in my life
[53:53] and when we think this way we're put all
[53:55] the blame right back there and we're
[53:57] just everything happened to me
[54:00] I'm just a
[54:01] passive victim everything just happened
[54:05] to me
[54:06] but this isn't true
[54:09] um there's one if you ask a
[54:10] kindergartner he'll say hey hold up you
[54:12] never get from a to c without something
[54:14] in between
[54:15] it never gets from point A to point C
[54:17] without a point B in between and the
[54:19] point B is our beliefs
[54:23] and um there's a psychologist named
[54:26] Albert Ellis he has this ABC theory of
[54:30] emotional pain
[54:31] it says adversity never leads directly
[54:34] to consequences though we think they do
[54:38] come between the A and the C are beliefs
[54:41] good true beliefs and belief is only
[54:43] good if it's true
[54:45] good true beliefs make you strong bad
[54:48] false beliefs are a poison that slowly
[54:50] kill you
[54:51] so if you have this adverse she's like
[54:53] man this adversity came because
[54:55] everybody was just against me I'm a
[54:58] victim that is a bad false belief that's
[55:00] going to poison you
[55:03] we think so the adversity comes and then
[55:05] we're presented what are we going to do
[55:06] with this because as we as you're in the
[55:09] moment and people who watch someone else
[55:11] go through trials they can see
[55:14] there are multi there are different ways
[55:16] this person can take what choices are
[55:18] they going to make
[55:20] when we make the wrong choice we look
[55:22] back as though this was the only choice
[55:23] I could take
[55:25] but if you're in the moment someone's
[55:27] looking after no they had options
[55:29] it's not just one con there are there
[55:31] are options here what determines the
[55:34] path that we take is the beliefs about
[55:38] the adversity that comes upon us
[55:43] um
[55:44] when we accept
[55:45] false beliefs to our questions about our
[55:48] trials and suffering our suffering
[55:50] multiplies exponential on an emotional
[55:52] level
[55:53] and doctors do acknowledge that
[55:55] emotional pain can be the worst kind of
[55:57] personal suffering
[55:58] that can be worse than the actual
[56:00] physical pain that you have and a lot of
[56:02] physical pain is actually rooted in
[56:04] internal emotional factors
[56:07] someone's bitter about things to happen
[56:09] to them they're gonna have a lot more
[56:10] physical problems in their life doctors
[56:13] say between 75 and 90 of all illnesses
[56:15] can be traced back to the body's
[56:17] response to not germs but distress
[56:21] so emotion have has a strong impact on
[56:24] our organism
[56:26] and I'd say the majority of emotional
[56:27] pain arises from mistaken or irrational
[56:31] beliefs that we hold about things that
[56:34] happen to us
[56:36] and God reveals himself to Smyrna saying
[56:39] I'm right here I'm at the head of it all
[56:41] I'm the first I'm the last I'm right
[56:43] here with you in between fear not accept
[56:46] my thoughts my truth about the
[56:49] tribulation you're going through except
[56:50] that because if you accept that and keep
[56:52] your eyes on me you're going to make it
[56:54] through
[56:56] he knows how the devil's going to work
[56:57] if the devil's going to come on say this
[57:02] this is going on and then as you if you
[57:04] accept that it can be a much harder road
[57:06] to go
[57:07] which belief are we going to take that
[57:10] we the different beliefs we can take
[57:12] that'll determine the consequences we
[57:14] have
[57:15] and I just wanted to um as I thought I
[57:18] read about this this past summer and I
[57:20] got to thinking about what brother
[57:21] Branham called his greatest Temptation
[57:23] and this is when his um he's at the
[57:26] bedside of his dying daughter Sharon
[57:29] Rose this is the hardest moment of my
[57:31] life
[57:33] at the bottom of page five I just kind
[57:35] of summarize I just put a bunch of the
[57:36] questions that he says
[57:38] the devil brought to his mind
[57:41] he says as I'm as I'm there at Sharon
[57:43] Rose's bedside
[57:45] trying to whisk away the flies that are
[57:47] trying to get get your eyes and
[57:49] everything the things that he has just
[57:51] had happened in his life I think his dad
[57:54] passed away his brother he's had a very
[57:57] very difficult time and he says then
[58:00] Satan moved up by the side of me there
[58:02] and said did you say he was a good God
[58:06] did you say he was a Healer
[58:09] then why did your father Die In Your
[58:12] Arms
[58:13] and why did your brothers and why and
[58:16] why did your brother die and your other
[58:17] brother's arms and you were standing in
[58:20] the Pulpit preaching a few weeks ago
[58:23] why didn't he answer you you prayed for
[58:26] these things why didn't he answer you
[58:28] you said he loved you and saved you and
[58:31] you just prayed just a minute ago and
[58:34] God pulls this sheet down and said shut
[58:36] up
[58:38] he won't hear you at all he turned his
[58:41] back on you he's a good god huh he loves
[58:44] you brother Brahms he's he's he's
[58:46] getting he's being by raged with all
[58:49] these thoughts what thought this is the
[58:51] adversity he's got this bad situation
[58:54] his wife's passed away I believe his
[58:56] daughter is now passing away what is he
[58:58] gonna what belief is he going to adopt
[59:00] about this is he going to say God's a
[59:02] bad God how could they ever serve him
[59:04] it's a waste of my time he's taken my
[59:06] wife my daughter my dad my brother and I
[59:09] have served him for nothing if he didn't
[59:11] Embrace that belief how would history
[59:13] have been different
[59:15] he had options
[59:18] but he doesn't
[59:24] everything the devil was telling me was
[59:27] the truth
[59:29] every the devil was taught all these
[59:30] things really happened
[59:32] it's the interpretation
[59:34] that's false
[59:37] everything that he would say it just
[59:39] fell right in line see here I was just
[59:41] about ready to say
[59:44] then if that's the way he's going to act
[59:46] then I won't serve him he was just about
[59:49] there
[59:50] and just as I said that there was
[59:53] something came from somewhere else way
[59:55] down on the inside said who are you to
[59:58] begin with the lord gave the Lord's
[1:00:01] taken away he said that's the inside man
[1:00:03] that doesn't reasonable I looked back
[1:00:05] and I thought how did I get on Earth I
[1:00:08] came from a bunch of drunkards how did I
[1:00:10] get here who gave me life how did I even
[1:00:11] get to this place my brothers were dead
[1:00:14] but I'm not
[1:00:16] there is goodness in my life why is God
[1:00:19] even given me life he has done so much
[1:00:21] for me the devil doesn't want you to
[1:00:22] think about your testimony but that's
[1:00:24] the very thing you need to think about
[1:00:26] when the Devil Comes tempting you how do
[1:00:29] they get on Earth I came for a bunch of
[1:00:30] drunkards how did I get here who give me
[1:00:33] life who give me that wife who gave me
[1:00:35] that baby where'd my wife come from my
[1:00:37] life come from I said no though he slay
[1:00:40] me I'll trust him get away from me Satan
[1:00:44] and so he has the adversity
[1:00:47] but the adversity does not determine our
[1:00:50] consequence
[1:00:51] it is the belief will it is not it is
[1:00:54] the truth that sets us free it's not
[1:00:57] it's not the not not our interpretations
[1:00:59] our explanations of how things happen
[1:01:01] that doesn't set us three those usually
[1:01:03] bind us and increase our pain but it's
[1:01:06] the truth that sets us free and brother
[1:01:07] Branham chose to believe the truth
[1:01:10] and he made it to the trial and he was
[1:01:13] an overcomer and we're all Overcomers
[1:01:15] partly because of that
[1:01:18] yeah what would have been the
[1:01:19] ramifications if brother Brandon had
[1:01:21] accepted the devil's lies about his
[1:01:23] sufferings
[1:01:25] did God have a purpose at that moment
[1:01:28] that his servant wasn't even capable of
[1:01:30] understanding
[1:01:32] we can look back and say yeah God had a
[1:01:34] purpose there
[1:01:36] at that moment brother Brandon had a
[1:01:38] really hard time with that just like the
[1:01:40] little kid in the dentist chair how can
[1:01:42] Mom letting this happen to me what's the
[1:01:44] purpose of this
[1:01:46] Satan's aim is to get us to accept his
[1:01:48] thoughts and when he does that we accept
[1:01:51] conclusions about people situations we
[1:01:55] accept his thoughts about God we accept
[1:01:57] his thoughts about ourselves and as we
[1:01:59] let those thoughts take root in our mind
[1:02:02] we gradually build complexes
[1:02:05] where do complexes come from they come
[1:02:07] from accepting the devil's thoughts
[1:02:09] about things and embracing them and that
[1:02:13] colors our world and we think this is
[1:02:14] the way world is we take the devil's
[1:02:16] glass and we look at and it's a it's a
[1:02:19] tented world it's a skewed World anybody
[1:02:21] who says anything different I don't want
[1:02:23] them in my world we separate ourselves
[1:02:25] from it but those complexes the uh we we
[1:02:29] might think they're right but they only
[1:02:31] separate us to become a prison only the
[1:02:33] truth sets us free
[1:02:35] and uh just in in closing here musicians
[1:02:38] you can you can come
[1:02:40] the the church at Smyrna teaches us an
[1:02:42] important lesson on suffering and so
[1:02:45] some of each one of these Church ages
[1:02:46] here in the coming uh coming uh coming
[1:02:49] chapters is going to need how do we go
[1:02:51] through suffering like this well
[1:02:53] rest assured that he knows Christ knows
[1:02:56] he understands and he can say fear not
[1:02:59] because he knows that he's with us
[1:03:03] that's why Christ introduces himself in
[1:03:05] such a personal way this church is going
[1:03:08] to suffer immensely
[1:03:09] but they trust him and as they trust and
[1:03:13] they'll experience extraordinary comfort
[1:03:15] and there's an extraordinary reward
[1:03:18] and just two sentences uh from the last
[1:03:22] quote on page six or a couple sentences
[1:03:25] often we think it would be almost
[1:03:27] impossible to be a martyr how many
[1:03:28] thought of that I hope we don't get
[1:03:30] persecuted too much I don't know if I
[1:03:32] could do it
[1:03:33] um that's a real thought
[1:03:35] but we think it would almost be
[1:03:37] impossible to be a martyr brother
[1:03:38] Brandon writes it but dare to recall
[1:03:40] that the faith we daily use to Triumph
[1:03:43] in Christ Jesus is the same faith that
[1:03:46] upholds the polycarps and all the
[1:03:48] martyrs the Supreme faith will give
[1:03:50] Supreme Grace for the Supreme hour
[1:03:53] rest and that however comes he'll give
[1:03:56] you the faith he'll give you the grace
[1:03:58] to make it through then fight today's
[1:04:00] battle now don't fight tomorrows
[1:04:03] and then that last uh last three lines
[1:04:05] all too little time it's been on
[1:04:08] laboring for the return of rewards of
[1:04:10] God we spend too much time being
[1:04:12] consumed by the things today the
[1:04:14] recompense of God the glory of God is
[1:04:16] too lightly esteemed
[1:04:18] if we believe in the reality of the
[1:04:21] resurrection of the body and the in
[1:04:23] Eternal Kingdom of substance if we
[1:04:25] believe in those things that we ought to
[1:04:27] lay up in heaven those good Treasures
[1:04:28] that are available to the faithful
[1:04:30] Saints the bank accounts in heaven are
[1:04:33] much more important than bank accounts
[1:04:34] here on here on Earth and that is one of
[1:04:37] the big lessons that God teaches at the
[1:04:39] church in Smyrna and hopefully um
[1:04:42] they'll teach us that today as well
[1:04:45] amen let's pray and then whatever you're
[1:04:47] getting afterwards that's
[1:04:49] heavenly father I thank you
[1:04:51] for your goodness and Grace Jewish Lord
[1:04:54] I pray that you would help us
[1:04:57] to conduct ourselves with joy
[1:05:00] in the trials that we have day by day oh
[1:05:02] it can be so hard I pray the Lord you
[1:05:05] would anoint our eyes with isaf that we
[1:05:08] can see and even see your hand and look
[1:05:10] back on the some of the most painful and
[1:05:12] difficult times in our life that we
[1:05:14] might be able to see that yes
[1:05:17] that that memory we talked about the
[1:05:20] dentist chair was so bad I I blocked out
[1:05:22] anything except the pain but yeah now
[1:05:24] that I see Lord you were there holding
[1:05:26] my hand too and we did make it through
[1:05:29] I pray that we would see and feel your
[1:05:31] love in those moments that we've
[1:05:33] completely been blinded to Lord
[1:05:36] I pray that you would help us to walk
[1:05:38] with you Faithfully day by day
[1:05:40] Lord I just pray that you would make us
[1:05:42] uh make us Overcomers of God help us
[1:05:45] Lord not to not to take the the cheap
[1:05:48] counterfeits that the devil offers of
[1:05:51] that that eternal glory oh he gives also
[1:05:55] many of those counterfeits that try to
[1:05:56] give us as a temporary rush or temporary
[1:05:58] satisfaction but Lord
[1:06:00] help us to engage the Battle For Real
[1:06:04] the fight that we may win that we may
[1:06:06] overcome and get the Victor's Crown on
[1:06:08] that day and Eternity help us Lord that
[1:06:11] we can see and anticipate that moment
[1:06:14] Lord when you come again and we're there
[1:06:16] with all of our brothers and sisters
[1:06:18] Lord
[1:06:20] we may fight we may Reign and sit with
[1:06:22] you and
[1:06:24] Lord I prayed you
[1:06:26] strength and encourage you to whether my
[1:06:28] brothers and sisters Lord blessed in my
[1:06:30] prayer in Jesus name
