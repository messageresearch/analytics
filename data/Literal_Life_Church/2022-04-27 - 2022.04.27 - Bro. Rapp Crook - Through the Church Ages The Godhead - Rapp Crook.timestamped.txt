[0:00] um the deity of jesus christ is front
[0:03] and center it is very very very clear
[0:06] jesus christ is god and also
[0:10] there is only one god now sometimes you
[0:13] might
[0:14] get jehovah's witnesses coming by your
[0:15] door from time to time and i was in
[0:17] holland somehow we got on their network
[0:20] and we had three or four different times
[0:22] and
[0:23] i welcomed them in we had nice
[0:24] conversations and it's difficult talking
[0:27] to them because they have a different
[0:28] bible
[0:29] so they'll try to make a point and
[0:31] they'll give you a verse and they look
[0:32] it up in their bible and it's different
[0:34] than the verse that you're that you're
[0:35] thinking of but it was really
[0:37] interesting revelation chapter one was
[0:39] one that they weren't able to really get
[0:40] around it shows jesus christ is god very
[0:43] very clearly
[0:44] anyhow john to the seven churches which
[0:47] are in asia grace be unto you and peace
[0:50] from him which is and which
[1:00] which was and is to come
[1:02] this is jesus christ
[1:04] jesus christ he was a prophet he was he
[1:07] came in flesh and he came to deuteronomy
[1:10] 18 15 says that the lord will raise up a
[1:12] prophet like unto me that was jesus and
[1:15] he which is right now jesus christ is
[1:18] now our high priest or intercessor in
[1:20] heaven and who is he he is also to come
[1:22] he's a coming king
[1:24] so we've got three offices right there
[1:26] and just had jesus christ reveals
[1:27] himself he revealed himself as a son of
[1:29] man as a prophet on earth he's her
[1:32] intercessor a high priest in heaven he's
[1:34] a coming king but how many jesus are
[1:36] there there's just one so a multiplicity
[1:40] of offices doesn't make a multiplicity
[1:42] of personalities
[1:44] so greetings from him which is which was
[1:46] is to come and from jesus christ who is
[1:50] the faithful witness the first begotten
[1:52] of
[2:06] then if we skip on over to verse eight
[2:08] let's get down to verse eight it's
[2:10] beautiful the titles
[2:12] the characteristics that are being
[2:14] highlighted about jesus i am alpha and
[2:18] omega the first and last letters of the
[2:20] greek alphabet the beginning and the
[2:22] ending set the lord which which one to
[2:24] talk about he which is was and is to
[2:26] come jesus and the almighty is also
[2:29] ascribed to him
[2:31] these are characteristics that in the
[2:33] old testament are very clearly
[2:36] speaking about jehovah isaiah 44 6 thus
[2:39] saith jehovah the king of israel his
[2:42] redeemer the lord of hosts i am the
[2:45] first
[2:46] i am the last beside me there is no god
[2:51] there's no god beside me first and last
[2:53] says the same thing pretty much in
[2:54] isaiah 48 12. and we look in revelation
[2:58] chapter 1 and there's no difficulty
[3:01] saying
[3:02] who this is i'm alpha and omega first
[3:04] last jesus christ there's just one god
[3:07] it is jesus christ god revealed in flesh
[3:11] not the second person third person it is
[3:13] god in flesh
[3:15] going back
[3:17] and john is hearing this voice and but
[3:19] he's not really seeing anyone then he
[3:21] turns around and he turns to see the
[3:24] voice they spake with him he turns he
[3:25] sees seven golden candle sticks and in
[3:28] the midst of the seven candlesticks he
[3:29] sees one like unto the son of man
[3:32] god reveals himself to john the number
[3:34] where is john right now he's in prison
[3:37] he's he's he's in exile rather on the
[3:38] isle of patmos this isn't the vacation
[3:41] destination he is that he's he's he's
[3:44] he's he's in a bad case he's a bad state
[3:47] and when we're in a bad state we need
[3:49] god to reveal himself to us in the way
[3:51] that we can perceive him in the way that
[3:52] we know god
[3:54] and
[3:55] jesus appeared to john in the way that
[3:57] john would recognize him he sees him one
[3:59] like unto the son of man
[4:01] and that's how god god comes to us in a
[4:04] way that we can perceive him and know
[4:06] him
[4:07] noticing john's in trouble
[4:09] jesus comes to him there
[4:11] and at the end of the chapter again
[4:14] when i saw him i fell out his feet as
[4:16] dead john writes and he laid his right
[4:18] hand upon me saying fear not i am the
[4:21] first i am the last he that liveth was
[4:24] dead i am alive forevermore those two
[4:27] scriptures unite
[4:29] the old and new testaments beautifully
[4:31] i'm the first and the last we heard
[4:33] about that in isaiah i'm he that liveth
[4:36] was dead alive forevermore i'm the one
[4:38] who was both of these things
[4:41] not two different people i am i am he
[4:44] and he says that really really
[4:46] beautifully
[4:47] now when i um
[4:49] when i look at this um growing up and uh
[4:52] um every wednesday night brother would
[4:54] be uh would be teaching and we heard
[4:57] lots and lots of teaching on the goddess
[4:59] which i'm thankful um but when you're
[5:02] going through the teaching at times like
[5:04] why
[5:04] why are we hearing another service on
[5:07] the goddard as you're cutting your teeth
[5:08] on the church pew why another certain
[5:11] what what's the big deal and that's kind
[5:13] of an answer
[5:15] what's the big deal question
[5:17] why are we doing another service on the
[5:20] godhead
[5:21] why is the doctrine of the godhead so
[5:23] important that brother branham preaches
[5:26] about it again and again and again and
[5:29] again just goes on and on about it why
[5:32] and i think
[5:33] this is a you could there be other
[5:35] answers that you could give these are
[5:36] three that i just want to offer
[5:39] i believe that the doctrine of the
[5:40] godhead as scripturally truly teaches it
[5:43] gives us really beautiful insight into
[5:45] god's heart
[5:48] if we don't really see who god is it's
[5:51] hard to see god's love for us what god's
[5:53] doing here
[5:55] it's um
[5:56] i understand growing up in the
[5:59] in the baptist church school i can
[6:00] remember a chapel service and
[6:02] the minister finishes his service and he
[6:05] takes questions he opens up for
[6:06] questions
[6:07] and one of the girls raises up her
[6:09] question asks a question i'd never
[6:10] really thought of asking
[6:12] but raised in the trinitarian background
[6:14] she asks who should i pray to
[6:18] should i pray to the father should i
[6:19] pray to the son who should i pray to
[6:22] isn't that just like the devil who wants
[6:24] to try to create all kinds of confusion
[6:26] and noise so we don't even know where to
[6:28] offer our prayers
[6:30] i was listening sometime back on
[6:32] saturday and they've got adventures in
[6:34] odyssey in the morning i'm still going
[6:36] to introduce an odyssey listener
[6:37] and you've got another another program
[6:39] another program and finally there's this
[6:41] moody broadcasting network
[6:44] a jewish christian who takes all kinds
[6:46] of questions to the bible and i listen
[6:48] to him from time to time
[6:49] but he got a call on question
[6:52] about the trinity and
[6:54] wondering about it and he answered the
[6:56] question with a with a metaphor i had
[6:58] never heard before he said comparing the
[7:00] trinity
[7:01] to
[7:02] trying to build a house who is it that
[7:03] builds the house you have you have an
[7:05] architect who draws up the plans
[7:07] and then you have but does the architect
[7:09] really build the house
[7:12] no the
[7:13] a contractor bids on and the contractor
[7:16] starts getting things going
[7:17] and then does but does the contractor
[7:19] really put much together in the house
[7:22] no
[7:23] so he says like the architect he says
[7:24] that's kind of like god the father
[7:27] and then the contractor that's kind of
[7:28] like god the son
[7:30] but the contractor doesn't really do the
[7:32] hammering of things like that
[7:33] that's left to god the holy spirit he
[7:35] compared the holy spirit to the power
[7:36] drill
[7:38] who's putting everything together you
[7:39] think listen that's that's not the
[7:41] picture of god that's there in the bible
[7:44] it's it's it creates it makes even
[7:46] things
[7:47] even more confusing
[7:49] so the devil
[7:50] tries to create confusion so we don't
[7:52] have clear insight into god's heart but
[7:54] i believe that the doctrine of the god
[7:55] that as it's as it truly is intended
[7:59] gives us the drama of god's plan
[8:02] it's not dry it's dramatic it's showing
[8:05] how god is descending from heaven coming
[8:08] all the way down to earth revealing
[8:10] himself making us making himself
[8:12] knowable to us it's a dramatic plan and
[8:15] has truly intended that's what it's
[8:17] bringing across and lastly the doctrine
[8:19] of the god that as it's truly taught in
[8:21] the bible
[8:22] shows clearly what the believer's
[8:24] position is
[8:26] but if if we don't really know who the
[8:28] son of god is it's hard to know who we
[8:31] are as sons and daughters of god
[8:33] so i think it is important and
[8:35] worthwhile spending some time on we just
[8:37] pray the lord will help us make it
[8:38] clearer and not
[8:40] any more confusing
[8:42] but on on page one of our notes i think
[8:43] it's interesting how brother branham
[8:45] says in the in the church age book this
[8:47] is on the paragraph 29 of the new
[8:49] edition
[8:50] how his
[8:52] the spirit of god in john expresses
[8:54] thusly in revelation 1 in order to set
[8:57] forth the supreme deity of jesus christ
[8:59] and to reveal the godhead as one god
[9:03] today there's a gross error that there
[9:05] are three gods instead of one
[9:07] but this revelation is given to john by
[9:09] jesus himself corrects that error
[9:12] the next part that's bold-faced this
[9:14] mighty revelation is what the early
[9:16] church had and it must be restored in
[9:18] this last day along with the correct
[9:20] baptismal formula of water baptism
[9:22] this is something that was supposed to
[9:23] be restored in the last days and if you
[9:25] look at revelation 10 7 it says the
[9:27] mystery of god should be finished
[9:30] and that's part of why we're able to see
[9:32] this
[9:33] this truth in
[9:35] about about the godhead
[9:37] now looking at what's the big deal how
[9:40] we see into god's heart
[9:43] if you look at the bottom of page one um
[9:46] in the message of revelation of jesus
[9:48] christ here the first part of the series
[9:51] brother brennan at the end of the
[9:52] message is starting to teach about um
[9:55] the story of joseph we talked about that
[9:56] some last month he's getting into the
[9:58] story of joseph he's talking about this
[10:00] detail on that detail and then the holy
[10:03] spirit completely interrupts his
[10:05] illustration
[10:07] and if you and at the bottom of page one
[10:09] he's telling about how joseph was
[10:11] what was in prison just like jesus was
[10:13] in prison one was saved on the thief on
[10:16] the cross the other one was lost etc
[10:19] that was taken off the cross and on top
[10:21] of page two
[10:22] and then look here in the beginning when
[10:24] adam
[10:26] said i just can't get away from that
[10:29] seems like somebody's not getting it
[10:31] somewhere look
[10:32] so he's completely stopping his
[10:34] illustration of joseph because he
[10:36] somebody's not getting it somewhere and
[10:38] there's something that can that should
[10:39] be gotten that god really wants us to
[10:42] get so he's completely interrupting the
[10:44] flow of this illustration to give this
[10:46] let me show you something again the holy
[10:48] spirit warns me to do this i'm leaving
[10:50] my subject for a minute
[10:52] when the first news came to glory that
[10:54] the son had been lost adam did god send
[10:58] an angel
[10:59] did he save the son did he send anyone
[11:02] else no he came himself to redeem his
[11:06] lost son he sweeps down to eden adam
[11:11] adam where are you where are you he
[11:13] wants to find adam he's not sending this
[11:16] to anybody else god himself comes down
[11:19] and here you see the heart of god
[11:22] whereas we don't have to have some
[11:24] discussion which person of the godhead
[11:26] is going down we don't have to have
[11:27] because it's not that's not part of it
[11:29] god comes himself with because that's
[11:32] his heart redemption he didn't trust it
[11:35] to anyone but himself god was made flesh
[11:38] and dwelt among us and redeemed man
[11:41] himself
[11:43] and we see the heart of god very clearly
[11:45] revealed there
[11:49] and as we look at the godhead we we have
[11:52] to
[11:53] it takes quite a bit of humility because
[11:55] we're talking about something completely
[11:57] out of our dimension and out of our out
[11:59] of our understanding and i just like to
[12:01] use the illustration of
[12:04] a bird watcher a bird lover and here you
[12:06] got this beautiful eagle
[12:08] who loves the bird the most you got bird
[12:10] lovers out there the bird watchers love
[12:12] the ornithologists love watching them
[12:14] with the binoculars but you have another
[12:16] group of people who love the birds and
[12:17] that's the
[12:18] the taxidermist
[12:21] but which one loves the bird the best
[12:26] the taxidermist will get that bird and
[12:27] he'll cut that bird open
[12:29] and he'll be able to tell you exactly
[12:31] where its heart is exactly where its
[12:33] liver is exactly everything works on the
[12:35] inside how the wings work all these
[12:37] things he'll be able to explain it to
[12:39] you in excruciating detail
[12:42] but in order to do that
[12:44] he has to kill the bird
[12:48] and i just wonder sometimes
[12:50] at 3 325
[12:52] a.d in the council of nicaea
[12:54] was there such a desire to explain god
[12:58] perfectly to the nth degree exactly how
[13:00] does god how does this work how does
[13:02] this work how does this work
[13:04] were they not just kind of trying to put
[13:06] god on the operating table
[13:08] cut them open explain this this this as
[13:11] they try to over explain god
[13:14] they almost
[13:15] kill his effect upon them
[13:18] so
[13:19] the best way of
[13:20] learning about god is like this bird
[13:22] watcher
[13:23] watching god
[13:25] we learn the most about god when we just
[13:27] look to him and let him reveal himself
[13:30] to us on his own
[13:33] so it is not intellectual um uh
[13:36] intellectual um
[13:38] chicken-heartedness to put a question on
[13:41] the shelf about god
[13:43] because sometimes that just takes the
[13:45] humility that we really need
[13:47] to see lord would you reveal this to me
[13:48] in your time because if i try to explain
[13:50] it i'll make a bigger mess of it anyhow
[13:54] another part of it i like is
[13:57] talking about explaining things here we
[13:58] have an early model
[14:01] of the atom you can see here's the
[14:03] here's the neutron in the middle with
[14:05] the nucleus and the proton there and you
[14:07] can see exactly in this model where each
[14:09] of those electrons is right there right
[14:12] there there's three of them you can see
[14:13] exactly where they are
[14:16] and this is a beautiful model you'll see
[14:17] it still in some textbooks
[14:19] but this is not how it really works
[14:22] if you put you look under an electron
[14:24] microscope you're going to see this
[14:27] because those electrons move so fast it
[14:30] defies
[14:31] photography divides anything all you
[14:33] will see is a cloud
[14:35] you can't define god and say god is here
[14:38] here here you can't do that you can't do
[14:40] that with the electron either you just
[14:42] have to sit back and say god works i'm
[14:44] going to watch him work i'm just going
[14:46] to let him show himself to me as he
[14:48] wishes and that's appropriate humility
[14:51] there for a believer
[14:54] now in the old testament
[14:56] there's a warning about making
[14:58] models
[15:00] except the old testament word isn't
[15:02] modeled the old testament word is image
[15:06] the old testament says thou shalt not
[15:08] make unto thee
[15:10] any graven image
[15:13] and here you have an
[15:14] image
[15:15] of the or a model
[15:17] of the godhead that was formed
[15:20] probably a couple out close to two
[15:22] thousand years ago um saying that god's
[15:25] like a triangle and there are three
[15:28] vertices on the triangle father son holy
[15:30] spirit
[15:31] but they're all one god but there are
[15:33] three vertices and each
[15:35] vertex is unique they're they're not the
[15:37] same they're they're separate
[15:39] and i would say that this is
[15:41] like an image of god
[15:43] that's been created
[15:45] and if we're not careful we can worship
[15:47] the image that we set up
[15:49] and and let that will replace the real
[15:52] god himself and this example kind and i
[15:55] just want to take a look um at the
[15:57] scriptures and see
[15:59] how what they have to say about each one
[16:01] of these vertices that has been
[16:02] separated here on the triangle
[16:05] but this image of god is not based on
[16:07] scripture it's based actually on greek
[16:08] philosophy and i would just say if we
[16:10] want to have a model
[16:12] about god it needs to begin with the
[16:14] assumption that god begins with hero
[16:16] israel the lord our god is one lord and
[16:19] that's how we should begin
[16:20] let's just take a look at
[16:23] the questions about
[16:25] the father is not the holy spirit well
[16:27] matthew 1 18 says
[16:30] mary was found with child of the holy
[16:32] ghost
[16:33] yet this model clearly trying to clearly
[16:36] say purports to say that these two are
[16:38] separate but matthew says no
[16:41] mary was found with child of the holy
[16:42] ghost
[16:44] and in the book of ephesians paul writes
[16:47] there is one god and father of all who
[16:49] is above all and through all and
[16:52] in you all hold up i thought the holy
[16:55] ghost came and lived inside me that was
[16:57] but here paul's saying
[16:59] the father
[17:00] is above all through all and in you all
[17:03] so i think this separation of two
[17:05] different virtues and these aren't the
[17:07] same i think that's a serious question
[17:09] there it doesn't hold up to scriptural
[17:11] uh
[17:12] inspection
[17:13] if you look at the top of the triangle
[17:15] or the
[17:16] the father is not the son according to
[17:19] this model isaiah 9 6 speaking of the
[17:22] messiah says his name shall be called
[17:23] wonderful counselor the mighty god the
[17:27] everlasting father
[17:30] well how can you make sense of this if
[17:32] you believe that you've got the son and
[17:34] the father whereas the son is going to
[17:35] be called the father but that's what the
[17:38] scripture says
[17:40] and then jesus says in john 14 he that
[17:43] hath seen me
[17:45] have seen the father and it's the father
[17:47] that dwells in me that does the works
[17:50] that's right
[17:52] separating like this doesn't doesn't
[17:54] work even more strongly in john 10 30
[17:56] jesus says i and my father
[17:59] are one
[18:00] so we don't i don't think this holds up
[18:02] to scriptural scrutiny
[18:05] john
[18:06] looking at this the son different from
[18:08] the holy spirit well
[18:10] john in john 14 18 jesus says that he's
[18:12] preparing to leave he's having last
[18:14] conversation with the disciples says i
[18:16] won't leave you comfortless
[18:19] i will come to you
[18:22] i will come to you
[18:24] not somebody different i will come to
[18:26] you just like when adam was in trouble
[18:28] and i lived there at eden god himself
[18:31] came to them
[18:32] same thing here
[18:34] and it gets even more exciting if you
[18:36] look at the book of acts
[18:38] after the holy spirit has fallen there
[18:40] on the day of pentecost and then
[18:43] saul of tarsus is going up to damascus
[18:45] to continue his persecution
[18:48] and it says here he's uh he's spitting
[18:50] off his high horse as the pillar of fire
[18:52] comes down and and blinds him and speaks
[18:54] to him and says saul saul
[18:56] why persecutest thou me
[18:59] i am
[19:01] jesus well did saul with saul stan we
[19:04] don't know if saul was standing at the
[19:05] cross or not we don't know i'm going to
[19:08] assume he wasn't he might have been we
[19:09] don't know but he wasn't persecuting
[19:11] jesus his body lit his physical nail
[19:14] with with the nail holes and the
[19:17] wound in the side he wasn't persecuting
[19:19] that body but he was persecuting the
[19:21] body that the spirit of jesus the spirit
[19:23] of christ was in and as he's going and
[19:25] beating believers and throwing them into
[19:27] prison
[19:28] jesus says you're persecuting me
[19:31] because they're filled with his with
[19:33] with with the holy spirit
[19:36] all these things kind of show that this
[19:38] this
[19:39] triangle geometric model doesn't really
[19:42] hold up doesn't fit in the church age
[19:44] book brother branham says real clearly
[19:46] it's a beautiful statement the jehovah
[19:48] of the old testament
[19:50] is the jesus of the new testament god
[19:52] revealed himself in the old testament in
[19:54] one way he reveals himself further in
[19:56] the new testament is jesus and all jesus
[19:58] means is jehovah savior it's another way
[20:02] of god
[20:03] revealing himself
[20:05] amen
[20:08] this um it was funny we talked about how
[20:10] the trinity gets put into christian
[20:12] school textbooks all over the place i
[20:14] was teaching geometry a couple years ago
[20:16] as we're going on to the chapter about
[20:17] triangles
[20:19] at the end of the section there's this
[20:21] beautiful triangle with that model i
[20:22] just showed you
[20:24] explaining and the doctrine and the
[20:26] study of triangles is another beautiful
[20:27] example of the doctrine of the trinity
[20:29] et cetera et cetera et cetera
[20:31] everybody's reading this i've got to do
[20:32] something about this right now we have
[20:34] to talk about it and earlier we had kind
[20:36] of had a conversation now if you have a
[20:38] polygon which is just a
[20:40] figure with sides that are connected
[20:43] a triangle is a polygon what happens if
[20:45] you add one side to a triangle you get a
[20:48] square
[20:49] if you add a side to a square you get a
[20:52] pentagon you have to side to a pentagon
[20:54] you get a hexagon then heptagon octagon
[20:59] decagon
[21:01] we'll stop there
[21:02] let's just see what happens as you do
[21:04] that
[21:05] square pentagon all the way up if you
[21:08] keep on adding sides
[21:10] what shape do you eventually get to
[21:13] a circle
[21:15] if you have a god with an infinite
[21:17] number of attributes
[21:19] you don't have a triangle anymore you
[21:21] have a circle i just ask if we have to
[21:23] have a geometric model which one's
[21:26] better a one god with an infinite number
[21:28] of attributes
[21:29] or
[21:30] the fathers not the sons not the holy
[21:32] ghost yet somehow is still one god
[21:35] which model is actually the best at
[21:37] expressing
[21:38] god's unity
[21:40] and his eternality
[21:42] i think the circle's a beautiful
[21:44] expression of it
[21:46] if we have to have a model
[21:49] so kind of looking at again what's the
[21:50] uh what's the big deal
[21:53] we talked about how it shows god's heart
[21:55] as he comes down
[21:56] from heaven to eden himself not not
[21:58] delegating it to anybody else
[22:01] but then looking at now the drama of
[22:02] god's plan
[22:04] first timothy 6 16 shows
[22:07] one of the major problems that the
[22:09] doctrine of the god had
[22:11] i say it very academic one of the major
[22:13] problems that god himself wants to solve
[22:16] that he is not knowable by simple human
[22:18] beings
[22:19] it says god dwells in the light which no
[22:21] man can approach unto whom no man hath
[22:24] seen nor can see
[22:27] if it's left up to us we cannot get
[22:29] close to god we can't even see god it's
[22:32] an insurmountable problem for us
[22:35] but god loves us so much
[22:38] he wants to be knowable by us
[22:40] so he bridges this dimensional gap
[22:44] so that we can
[22:46] know him
[22:47] and the only way that something that's
[22:49] invisible
[22:50] can be knowable by us
[22:52] is by putting on
[22:54] a jacket
[22:55] by putting on a suit of clothes all of a
[22:57] sudden the h.g wells wrote a book about
[23:00] the invisible man
[23:01] and the invisible man's walking around
[23:03] he's cold but he can't nobody can see
[23:04] him but he goes and puts the invisible
[23:06] man puts on a jacket then he's got this
[23:08] problem people see the jacket but
[23:10] nothing else but he's warmer well god
[23:11] puts on a jacket he puts on
[23:14] clothes he he hides himself that's the
[23:17] only way that an invisible being can be
[23:19] seen and that's what god
[23:21] does throughout the entire old testament
[23:24] isaiah 45 15 says verily you are a god
[23:27] that hides thyself
[23:30] o god of israel the savior we read this
[23:32] the first one we think why does god hide
[23:34] himself it's not the idea of god playing
[23:36] hide and seek with us
[23:38] but if god didn't hide himself
[23:41] he couldn't be found by us either that's
[23:43] the fun part of hide and seek right
[23:45] getting found and finding the person
[23:47] well god does that
[23:48] he hides himself
[23:50] under a skin
[23:52] otherwise we have no hope of ever seeing
[23:55] him
[23:56] and
[23:57] i love this quote from the message
[24:00] identified christ of all ages the
[24:02] express is just so clearly the heart of
[24:05] god the whole purpose of the matter
[24:07] brother branham says so you see the
[24:10] whole thing is god becoming
[24:13] tangible that is the whole story of
[24:17] scripture tangible just means touchable
[24:21] god in john first john 1 1 says that
[24:24] which is from the beginning which we
[24:25] have heard which we have seen mature
[24:27] with our eyes which we have handled of
[24:30] the word of life god wanted to become
[24:32] visible audible tangible to us so that
[24:36] we could know him and we're just like
[24:38] little kids little kids they want to
[24:40] know you they're not going to be they
[24:42] don't want a distant relationship
[24:44] they want to come
[24:45] and wrestle with you they want it
[24:47] it's show and tell feel but they want to
[24:49] know you
[24:50] that's how god came to us
[24:53] he wanted to know us and us to know him
[24:56] that much
[24:57] the whole thing is god becoming tangible
[24:59] on the great day that's to come i have
[25:01] the quote middle of page three
[25:03] when christ sets upon the throne of
[25:04] david reigns in the millennium it's god
[25:07] tangible in the earth
[25:09] and then
[25:10] he is now in you you are his attributes
[25:14] you were in god's thinking now and
[25:17] you're just materialized
[25:19] god wanted to be tangible in jesus
[25:21] christ and he still wants to be tangible
[25:25] and that's what god was when he
[25:27] materialized
[25:28] in christ god displayed
[25:31] manifest in flesh in christ he became
[25:34] material
[25:36] god that we could touch
[25:40] god knows that little kids learn best by
[25:42] hands-on
[25:43] and he knows that human beings learn
[25:45] best about him by being he's a hands-on
[25:48] god
[25:49] he wants us to be hands-on with him as
[25:51] well that's what that's what this that's
[25:53] what the doctrine is all about that is
[25:55] god's heart to become
[25:57] tangible because you know what when we
[26:00] when god isn't tangible to us and we
[26:02] don't see god in our trials but we can't
[26:04] perceive god anywhere around us
[26:07] we get nervous don't we i don't know
[26:10] where god is where is guy
[26:12] i'm freaking out i don't know where god
[26:14] is that things are falling apart i need
[26:16] god
[26:18] and that's how job felt in the middle of
[26:19] his trial
[26:21] behold i go forward but he's not there i
[26:24] look behind me i go backward but i can't
[26:26] perceive him on the left hand
[26:28] where he does work i cannot behold him
[26:31] he hides himself on the right hand i
[26:33] can't see him and job is trying in the
[26:35] midst of his trial to be strong so yes
[26:37] i've known my redeemer liveth but god i
[26:40] just need to see you
[26:42] and finally in the book of job at the
[26:44] very end
[26:46] god comes down
[26:49] he comes down he hides himself in the
[26:52] whirlwind
[26:54] why does he hide himself in the world
[26:55] because god has to come on the form
[26:57] because he's invisible
[26:59] if he didn't come on the form he
[27:01] wouldn't be visible
[27:03] he comes down in the whirlwind the lord
[27:05] answered job out of the whirlwind where
[27:09] was god
[27:10] he was in that whirlwind
[27:12] that whirlwind was hiding god like
[27:15] isaiah said thou art a god that hides
[27:18] thyself oh god of israel the savior god
[27:22] hid himself in that whirlwind so that he
[27:24] could comfort job
[27:27] where is god hiding himself
[27:29] today he might think where is god where
[27:31] is god well god's not hiding so that we
[27:33] can't find him he's hiding so that he we
[27:35] can be found of him it's completely
[27:38] reverse of how we usually think of it
[27:39] but that's how it works
[27:42] then we have
[27:44] in
[27:45] the book of exodus
[27:47] when the children of israel are leaving
[27:50] are leaving egypt
[27:51] and they're wanting to find out where
[27:53] god is also
[27:55] exodus 13 21 the lord went before them
[27:58] by day in a pillar of clouds where was
[28:02] he
[28:03] he was in the pillar of cloud he was in
[28:05] the fire if it hadn't been for the cloud
[28:07] on the fire
[28:08] they wouldn't have seen him
[28:11] they needed something to see so they
[28:12] could follow it but also to be a
[28:14] reassurance god's with me and then in
[28:17] exodus 14 is the as the
[28:20] as pharaoh's egyptians the chariots are
[28:22] rushing upon them they're between the
[28:24] egyptians and the red sea the rock and
[28:26] the hard place as it were
[28:28] and and then the god comes in the pillar
[28:30] of fire and is between them and the
[28:32] egyptians and the morning watch the lord
[28:35] looked under the host of the egyptians
[28:38] through the pillar of fire and of the
[28:40] cloud where was god he was hiding
[28:43] himself there
[28:46] not to be mysterious but to be
[28:48] visible
[28:49] to be visible amen
[28:51] amen
[28:53] and throughout the old testament there
[28:54] are so many examples like this in the
[28:57] old testament i'm just going to hit on a
[28:58] couple of them
[28:59] otherwise it just becomes really long
[29:01] and
[29:02] don't be needlessly long here
[29:04] but
[29:05] there are many times in the old
[29:06] testament where god appears to somebody
[29:08] and talks about the angel of the lord
[29:10] appears to them
[29:11] and who is the angel of the lord here i
[29:13] want to take a look in
[29:15] judges chapter 6.
[29:17] when god appears to someone as the angel
[29:20] of the lord
[29:21] he's taking on some kind of a human form
[29:24] because when he comes as the angel of
[29:26] the lord most of the time the person
[29:27] doesn't realize that they're talking to
[29:29] a supernatural being
[29:31] only later does god show that to them
[29:35] but um
[29:36] when this angel
[29:38] had gideon's there threshing wheat and
[29:42] it says there came an angel of the lord
[29:44] and sat under an oak which wasn't
[29:46] ophra what kind of angel is this a
[29:49] normal human being who that's always
[29:51] appearing who just sits under the tree
[29:53] and
[29:53] is resting and watching
[29:56] it starts out saying verse 11 there came
[29:58] an angel of the lord
[30:00] but as the story unfolds verse 11 says
[30:03] the lord looked upon gideon and said
[30:07] well inside this we don't see this but
[30:09] this angel
[30:11] is hiding
[30:12] the invisible god within him
[30:15] so god
[30:17] the invisible god is looking through the
[30:19] eyes of this
[30:21] human form is described as the angel of
[30:23] the lord and speaks to gideon verse 16
[30:26] the lord said unto gideon how the lord
[30:29] is revealing himself through this human
[30:31] form this messenger of the lord the
[30:32] angel of the lord says surely i will be
[30:34] with thee
[30:36] that's how god is revealing himself to
[30:38] getting he's taking on this form and it
[30:41] kind of shows you
[30:42] how does god what kind of form does god
[30:44] use throughout the old testament the
[30:46] most
[30:47] to unveil himself to humans
[30:49] he does come as a whirlwind in the book
[30:51] of job he comes as a pillar of fire in
[30:53] the cloud
[30:54] in the book of genesis or a book of
[30:56] exodus a couple different ways but the
[30:58] way that is most frequently used
[31:01] is in some kind of human form
[31:04] that
[31:05] for
[31:06] that show us something about the heart
[31:07] of god what's god's great desire is he
[31:10] wants to unveil himself reveal himself
[31:13] and the human form it gets closer and as
[31:15] we go through the old testament gets
[31:16] closer and closer he's unveiling more
[31:18] and more throughout to the angel of the
[31:19] lord the prophets till finally
[31:22] a sinless baby is born through a virgin
[31:25] birth and god can completely reveal
[31:28] himself there so all these
[31:30] human manifestations of god these
[31:32] theophanies these bodies for a spirit
[31:35] all these in the old testament are just
[31:37] foreshadowing leading up to god's the
[31:40] high point of his drama where he can be
[31:42] revealed in a human flesh-born
[31:46] child
[31:48] and finally that's only making way for
[31:50] the rest of god's drama where he can be
[31:52] unfolded and revealed in all of his
[31:54] children
[31:56] it's a it's not it's not dry it's not
[31:58] academic this is the heart of god so he
[32:01] can be in us through us
[32:03] living through us revealing himself
[32:05] through us
[32:06] i want to show one let's take a look at
[32:08] judges chapter 13.
[32:10] i think it's just interest i don't have
[32:11] this on the screens this is when um
[32:15] the angel of the lord comes to sampson's
[32:19] mother mrs manoah i'm just going to hit
[32:21] a couple verses judges 13 3 it says the
[32:23] angel of the lord appeared to the woman
[32:26] and we're going to be kind of asking the
[32:28] question who's appearing here who is
[32:29] coming to her
[32:30] verse 6
[32:32] the woman comes and tells her husband
[32:34] saying a man of god came unto me
[32:38] she doesn't realize it's an angel she
[32:39] says the man of god coming to her
[32:41] and then manoa wants to see
[32:44] who it is he wants to meet her yeah i
[32:46] have just as good a right here from this
[32:47] angel his message affects me like it
[32:49] affects you i want to see him too
[32:51] in verse 10
[32:54] the
[32:54] angel of the lord came again in verse 10
[32:56] the woman made haste and ran and showed
[32:58] her husband said unto behold the man has
[33:01] appeared to me who came to me the other
[33:02] day he says the man
[33:05] appeared who came the other day
[33:07] who is she there's confusion about who
[33:09] this person is
[33:11] and if we think about if there's
[33:12] sometimes confusion about who how god
[33:15] revealed himself to us through brother
[33:16] branham well that kind of goes with the
[33:19] territory sometimes when the angel of
[33:21] the lord comes and moves we see it right
[33:23] here
[33:24] so verse 10 the man hath appeared unto
[33:27] me and then verse 16
[33:29] the angel of the lord says to manoah
[33:32] don't don't stop me don't keep me from
[33:34] going i'm not going to eat your bread if
[33:35] you want to offer up or an offering just
[33:36] offer it to the lord
[33:38] for which is a great point of irony
[33:40] offer to the lord when this is the angel
[33:42] of the lord god revealing through human
[33:44] flesh and it says for noah didn't know
[33:47] he was an angel of the lord he didn't
[33:49] know but god was revealing himself in
[33:51] the form
[33:52] so that
[33:54] they could be known so that he could be
[33:56] known of them and then finally verse 21
[33:59] after the angel goes up in fire from the
[34:01] altar
[34:02] it says the angel of the lord did no
[34:04] more appear to manoa unto his wife and
[34:06] then
[34:07] then manoa knew he was an angel of the
[34:09] lord and he said to his wife we shall
[34:12] surely die because we have seen
[34:14] god
[34:15] so in this one short story we go from
[34:18] angel of the lord man of god
[34:20] a man
[34:22] to angel lord again to
[34:24] god
[34:26] but god is hiding himself so that he can
[34:31] reveal himself because if god doesn't
[34:33] hide himself an invisible being can't be
[34:36] seen
[34:37] so again
[34:38] throughout the old testament there is a
[34:40] multitude of ways that god reveals
[34:42] himself he comes to joshua as the
[34:45] captain of the host this was a a human
[34:48] form but joshua bows down and worships
[34:51] this form
[34:52] and he's not stopped and said he doesn't
[34:54] he's not stopped and told you can't do
[34:56] this um you shouldn't worship anybody
[34:59] but god this is the captain of the host
[35:00] is hiding god then that rock was christ
[35:04] when that rock is smitten provides
[35:06] water burst out that's
[35:08] god taking on a form that wasn't no
[35:11] simple rock it was god hiding itself
[35:13] there melchizedek a man who wrestled
[35:16] with jacob all these ways are ways that
[35:19] god revealed himself
[35:21] hid himself so that he could reveal
[35:24] himself
[35:27] this is the unveiling of god brother
[35:29] brennan has a sermon by that title but
[35:31] that captures the whole theme of
[35:33] scripture that captures the drama of
[35:35] god's plan
[35:37] it says like he was in moses when the
[35:39] word was in moses he was god in flesh
[35:42] and it was in jesus it was god in the
[35:44] flesh the only thing he did was change
[35:46] his mask mother's word not his nature
[35:49] just his mask he's the same yesterday
[35:51] forever he only changed his form he
[35:54] changed from noah to moses moses to
[35:56] david david on down till they come into
[35:58] the fullness of the godhead bodily in
[36:00] jesus christ but it's still the same god
[36:04] he just takes on another veil he puts on
[36:07] another veil he's still doing that today
[36:10] he's taking on the veil with each one of
[36:12] your names that's how god is veiling
[36:15] himself because he's still a god that
[36:17] cannot be approached unto you that
[36:19] cannot be seen by human eye but he wants
[36:21] to be seen he wants to be known
[36:24] and jesus of nazareth isn't walking the
[36:26] earth right now but his spirit is in
[36:29] human form again so that our colleagues
[36:31] or their fellow students or their
[36:33] teachers they can know god also
[36:36] that is the that is the drama of it
[36:40] continues this is quoting from ephesians
[36:43] chapter three oh god
[36:44] poured himself into christ
[36:47] not another person the one out of him
[36:49] called the holy spirit it was he himself
[36:51] he poured himself into the people christ
[36:54] in you how beautiful wonderful to think
[36:56] god
[36:57] pouring himself into the human being
[37:00] into the believer pour out it was a part
[37:03] of the drama to do that so the whole
[37:06] purpose of god to be veiled in human
[37:08] flesh
[37:12] amen
[37:14] so all the fullness of the godhead
[37:15] bodily brother branham says was in this
[37:17] person jesus christ he was god and god
[37:20] alone not a third person or a second
[37:22] person or a first person will we put
[37:25] them into persons like that we're
[37:27] limiting god
[37:29] it's not one two first second third
[37:30] person it is the person god veiled in
[37:34] human flesh
[37:36] and
[37:38] why does he do this so that
[37:40] he is the invisible god from a
[37:42] completely different dimension can come
[37:44] and be known by us
[37:46] now
[37:48] the recently in the last year um
[37:51] facebook
[37:52] changed names didn't they they became
[37:55] meta which is short for the the
[37:57] metaverse which is like this other
[38:00] this other world
[38:02] it's a virtual world right
[38:05] well in order to be seen in a virtual
[38:07] world
[38:09] you have to take on a
[38:10] virtual
[38:12] body
[38:13] in order to be in that virtual body
[38:15] ironically
[38:16] i think it's called a skin
[38:18] what skin do you use in the metaverse
[38:20] well you can even my uh my my son likes
[38:23] to play
[38:25] on the little minecraft world sometimes
[38:27] i know when you're on minecraft you can
[38:29] go into your settings and you can choose
[38:31] out what skin you want
[38:33] and there are different different skins
[38:35] that somebody could choose
[38:37] for their minecraft be on this different
[38:38] world and you go but
[38:41] you have that you have the you have the
[38:42] player behind the console
[38:44] is that player behind the console
[38:47] different
[38:48] than that little skinned a little guy
[38:50] that's walking around
[38:52] no it's just an extension of them it's
[38:54] an image of them so that anybody else is
[38:57] in that metaverse can see him if he
[39:00] didn't have the skin
[39:01] then you wouldn't be able to see
[39:04] who he was in the metaverse
[39:06] and likewise you can change
[39:09] skins
[39:10] as you're going through the game
[39:12] you can just take on a different skin
[39:14] does that mean that just because
[39:16] it's because
[39:18] uh somebody takes on a different solid
[39:20] one takes on a different skin all of a
[39:21] sudden we've got two or three solomons
[39:23] running around the world no
[39:25] just an
[39:26] extension he's revealing himself with
[39:29] some
[39:30] with with another skin trying out what
[39:31] it's like to be in somebody else's skin
[39:33] in the metaverse today but that's the
[39:35] only reason why so what's the purpose of
[39:37] the skin so that somebody else who's in
[39:39] this imaginary world can know you
[39:43] and the example kind of works
[39:45] because god is
[39:47] god's in a different dimension that's
[39:48] unknowable to us
[39:51] so in order for he comes into our world
[39:53] and has to take on
[39:55] a skin
[39:56] so that we can know him
[39:58] just like if like our world is so much
[40:00] better than any kind of minecraft world
[40:03] but we love the minecraft world so much
[40:05] that we want to reveal ourselves to this
[40:07] minecraft world to other players are in
[40:09] there because we think it's so special
[40:11] so we take on the skin
[40:13] and jump into the minecraft where the
[40:14] other players can get to know us
[40:17] and like what condescension who would
[40:19] want to have screen time when there's
[40:21] this great world out here
[40:23] but that's the same kind of
[40:25] condescension when god left his world
[40:28] heaven to come down to our world i mean
[40:31] a screen it's so limiting so
[40:34] two-dimensional
[40:35] but
[40:36] we want to throw ourselves into this
[40:38] screen with a skin so that we can be
[40:40] known here but that's what god did with
[40:43] this heaven he's coming down to put
[40:46] himself box himself in it would be like
[40:48] but he loves the people in the screen
[40:50] world so much he'll take on the skin
[40:54] but we can't say that the skin is
[40:56] something different than god no not at
[40:58] all we can't say that the skin is
[41:00] somebody different than the player no
[41:02] it's just an image of the player how the
[41:04] player is revealing himself but it's one
[41:07] player the whole time it's one god the
[41:10] whole time amen praise the lord
[41:13] here we have it without controversy
[41:15] great is the mystery of godliness god
[41:18] was manifest in the flesh
[41:20] god took on a skin
[41:23] so that we in this
[41:25] universe could see him
[41:27] god was manifest in the flesh great is
[41:30] the mystery of godliness there's no
[41:31] controversy about it but the truth is
[41:34] it's just god manifesting himself in
[41:36] flesh
[41:38] why
[41:39] so that he could be knowable by us
[41:43] and on page five i've got a number of
[41:45] scriptures to kind of go through this
[41:47] i'm just going to go through them
[41:48] quickly but
[41:49] in the beginning was the word the word
[41:51] was with god the word was god and the
[41:53] word
[41:54] was made flesh
[41:56] why
[41:57] it dwelt among us so that we could know
[42:00] him first john 1 1 so that our hands
[42:03] could handle him so we could see him
[42:04] with their eyes our ears could hear him
[42:06] so we could know him
[42:09] god was manifest in the flesh it says
[42:12] god was in christ in second corinthians
[42:14] 5 19.
[42:17] john 1 18 says no man have seen god at
[42:19] any time
[42:20] because we can't see god that's the
[42:23] problem that's the problem that we can't
[42:26] surmount but god does
[42:28] he comes in the skin
[42:30] so that we can see him and have a
[42:32] relationship with him jesus christ is
[42:35] the image of the invisible god
[42:38] and then the hebrew says he's the
[42:39] express image of god's person
[42:43] and i would say
[42:44] that's the drama god reeling himself in
[42:47] christ but it just continues as he still
[42:50] wants to reveal himself
[42:52] in skin
[42:54] and here it talks about
[42:56] we want to talk about how the true
[42:58] understanding
[43:00] of the story of scripture i think the
[43:02] doctrine of the god dead if we talk like
[43:04] it like that it's uh it's academic
[43:07] it's the best way to say it's the story
[43:08] of scripture
[43:10] how god revealed it's the story of
[43:11] scripture it's not the doctrine of the
[43:13] god that it's the story of scripture
[43:15] that's what it is
[43:17] job chapter 10 and verse 11
[43:20] all of this is god hiding himself and
[43:22] where now thou hast clothed me with skin
[43:25] and flesh you offensed me with bones and
[43:27] sinews
[43:29] who's the me here
[43:31] you look in the mirror nothing of what
[43:32] you see in the mirror is you
[43:35] we spent a lot of time on it but that's
[43:37] not you
[43:39] the real you
[43:40] is that soul inside of you
[43:43] and the best part is when god comes down
[43:46] the same god that revealed himself
[43:48] throughout the old testament different
[43:50] ways in different human forms takes a
[43:52] portion of that it has all the same
[43:55] properties and puts in our soul and then
[43:58] who's the real me
[44:00] well
[44:01] it's clothed in your skin and your flesh
[44:04] so that people can have come in contact
[44:06] with it
[44:08] amen
[44:10] praise the lord
[44:13] colossians 1 27 it's christ in you hope
[44:17] of glory christ wants to be unveiled in
[44:20] your skin
[44:21] now first corinthians 3 know you not
[44:23] that you are the temple of god
[44:26] god's dwelling in you so that
[44:29] people can what you do in the temple
[44:31] you you come into contact with god
[44:34] you worship god well you're the temple
[44:36] of god so the people can come into
[44:38] contact with god but you're not the
[44:40] focus god's the focus
[44:42] that's why if we lose track of who we
[44:45] are and we just kind of and we have an
[44:47] experience with god but then we kind of
[44:48] slide away and start
[44:50] identifying ourselves with god both
[44:53] we're identified more with our
[44:54] profession or with our hobbies but we're
[44:56] we're losing track of who we are
[45:00] we're
[45:00] we want god's inside of us we're the
[45:02] temple of god the point of us being here
[45:04] on earth is that people can come in
[45:06] contact with god not that we can have
[45:08] the best car the best house highest
[45:10] salary so that people can come in
[45:12] contact with god
[45:14] second corinthians 6 16 again paul says
[45:16] what agreement at the temple of god with
[45:18] idols you're the temple of god what are
[45:20] you doing hanging around with places
[45:22] where the temple of god shouldn't be
[45:24] you are the temple of the living god
[45:27] amen
[45:31] how was man created in the beginning he
[45:33] was created in
[45:34] god's image
[45:36] god created man in his own image
[45:39] unfortunately man fell but god is
[45:41] restoring man again to be the image of
[45:44] god who was jesus christ he was the
[45:46] express image of god
[45:48] and that is what god wants to restore us
[45:50] so that we could also be
[45:52] the image of god romans 8 29 says for
[45:55] whom he did for no he also did
[45:57] predestinate to be conformed to the
[46:00] image of his son
[46:02] that's what we were that's what adam was
[46:04] created to be he was created in god's
[46:06] image
[46:07] and we're still image bearers of god but
[46:09] because of sin the image has been
[46:11] twisted the image has been broken in
[46:12] some to some extent but we're
[46:14] predestinated to be conformed to the
[46:17] image of god god is putting the image of
[46:20] god back together again on earth so that
[46:23] again he can overcome this problem that
[46:26] no man has seen god at any time
[46:28] it's interesting that phrase no man has
[46:30] seen god at any time comes up twice
[46:33] in the bible once in the book of john
[46:36] and that's referring to jesus no man has
[46:39] seen god at any time the only begotten
[46:41] son
[46:42] he hath declared him and in the first
[46:44] john
[46:46] john brings us up again the problem no
[46:48] man seeing god at any time
[46:50] but
[46:51] if we love one another god dwelleth in
[46:54] us his love is perfected in us
[46:56] if we love one another
[46:59] god's image can again
[47:01] be seen
[47:03] by the world
[47:04] he's again trying to tackle that problem
[47:07] god wants to make himself tangible and
[47:09] as the body of christ
[47:11] loves god loves one another then it's
[47:14] the image of god again that people can
[47:16] see who god is and come into contact
[47:18] with him
[47:20] and then this
[47:23] understanding of the story of god god
[47:25] wanting to come into us helps make this
[47:28] one scripture that we read every time
[47:30] for the communion service makes sense
[47:32] it says he that eateth and drinketh of
[47:34] the communion supper unworthily eateth
[47:36] and drinketh damnation to himself not
[47:38] discerning the lord's body
[47:40] not deserving the lord's body that we
[47:42] that we
[47:43] are a part
[47:44] of god's body
[47:46] that we are the temple of the living god
[47:50] that's what this is talking about not
[47:52] deserving the lord's body that we're a
[47:53] part of it and yet we're living
[47:55] a lie
[47:57] we can't do that for the temple of
[47:59] living god we conduct ourselves as a
[48:01] temple of god we live or live as a
[48:03] temple of god because we understand
[48:06] where the lord's body is that god is
[48:08] embodying himself
[48:10] in us
[48:11] and brother branham talks about this
[48:14] briefly in the communion message
[48:16] in the middle there of page six kind of
[48:18] at the end
[48:25] he quotes at the end of that paragraph 7
[48:27] he says he quotes what the scripture he
[48:29] that eateth and drinketh on the earthly
[48:31] eats and drinks damnation to himself not
[48:33] deserting the lord's body the
[48:34] discernment of knowing that you are the
[48:37] lord's body that god is hiding himself
[48:40] and you
[48:41] and you can't and you and you can't see
[48:43] it you're not identifying yourself as
[48:45] that in wickedness and sin we've got to
[48:47] be above that we discern that the lord
[48:50] is righteous we discern he's our
[48:52] propitiation that all of our sins we've
[48:54] confessed and we believe in him of
[48:56] waiting upon this atom to cleanse us
[48:58] from all of our iniquity then we're
[49:00] deserting the lord's body we're
[49:02] deserting what the lord's body is for
[49:05] and then discerning again that in among
[49:07] us as the lord's bride body
[49:11] that there's anything wrong with us in
[49:12] here that would hinder the gospel from
[49:14] growing or the lord from presenting us
[49:17] before god's a chaste virgin let's
[49:18] discern that out right now and find out
[49:20] if it's wrong
[49:22] i think it's interesting he says two
[49:23] things there about the lord's body the
[49:25] first part of the quote talk what's the
[49:27] lord's body for
[49:29] he's not saying that we're once we've
[49:31] got the holy ghost that we're living
[49:33] sinless lives and if we ever make a
[49:35] mistake we're not deserting the body of
[49:37] the lord and we're written off the first
[49:39] part says we discern the lord's body
[49:42] what it's there for why it hung on the
[49:43] cross for us he's the blood the
[49:46] propitiation of our sins all of our sins
[49:48] that we've confessed he's cleansed us
[49:50] from our our iniquity we discern what
[49:53] it's for that keeps us clean
[49:57] but the second part again shows wow
[50:00] if we've been cleansed by the blood of
[50:02] the lamb if we've been cleansed by the
[50:04] washing of the water of the word then we
[50:06] can be the
[50:08] we're just a skin through which god can
[50:11] reveal himself i just pray that i can be
[50:13] as translucent a
[50:16] skin as possible the god's spirit can be
[50:18] seen clearly through me and that's that
[50:20] second part that we are the lord's bride
[50:24] body we've been washed in the blood so
[50:26] we can't be the god can reveal himself
[50:29] to the world through us
[50:32] amen
[50:33] so the true doctrine of the god it's
[50:35] again i don't even like the the term or
[50:37] phrase it's the story of god
[50:40] that's what it is it shows the position
[50:42] of the believer
[50:47] it shows the position of the believer as
[50:49] to how god is now
[50:51] making himself flesh now making himself
[50:55] knowable to mankind and if we looked at
[50:58] the last uh last our
[51:00] our last service we talked about
[51:02] revelation how the satan hates
[51:04] revelation he really hates this
[51:06] revelation because it disrupts all of
[51:08] these plans if you see who you really
[51:10] are in christ you'll be an invincible
[51:12] army the gates of hell can't prevail
[51:14] against you the devil hates this kind of
[51:17] revelation
[51:18] which is why
[51:20] which is why
[51:21] he creates this confusion about who god
[51:23] is who the son of god is who you are so
[51:26] that we really don't even know someone
[51:28] that might know who should i even pray
[51:29] to
[51:30] he makes the christian powerless
[51:32] by doing that
[51:35] but
[51:35] god has shown in this last day he is the
[51:37] mystery of god should be finished and by
[51:40] god's grace this revelation has been
[51:42] restored and we can live a victorious
[51:44] christian life
[51:46] and i'm just going to we'll we'll we'll
[51:48] close right here
[51:49] but brother brandon finishes this
[51:51] section of on the godhead in this first
[51:54] chapter of the church age book the
[51:56] transitions right into talking about
[51:58] water baptism
[52:00] well
[52:01] why on earth if we're supposed to eat
[52:03] and drink in jesus name because we're
[52:04] supposed to pray in jesus name cast out
[52:06] devils in jesus name do everything in
[52:08] jesus name why on earth all of a sudden
[52:10] would we be asked to well
[52:12] when you baptize make sure you baptize
[52:14] the name of the father son holy ghost it
[52:17] doesn't fit
[52:18] but he's trying to break off that
[52:20] connection between the bride and the
[52:21] groom because
[52:23] that's where we get our identity from
[52:25] taking the groom's name and that a wrong
[52:29] doctrine of baptism is trying to break
[52:31] that connection
[52:32] he's trying to take the prevent the
[52:34] bride from getting the groom's name and
[52:36] make that understanding so much harder
[52:37] to see trying to divorce from
[52:40] divorces from our from our source of
[52:42] power
[52:43] i'm just thankful that god
[52:45] has uh has given this uh revelation and
[52:49] like i said i i understand i grew up in
[52:52] a
[52:53] in a little little baptist church school
[52:55] somewhere and
[52:56] you get questions sometimes and if you
[52:58] have questions i
[52:59] i didn't touch on you still got
[53:01] questions sometimes i'm not going to
[53:02] look at you say what did you not believe
[53:04] what i said are you an unbeliever don't
[53:06] you believe i'm not going to say that
[53:09] because questions are absolutely normal
[53:11] i'm happy if you have a question i'm
[53:12] very happy to take him i might say i
[53:14] don't know because it's better i don't
[53:16] know than give the wrong answer
[53:18] but
[53:19] we'll just pray if you have questions
[53:20] that god will reveal himself closer and
[53:22] closer to each one
[53:23] amen let's pray
[53:25] heavenly father we thank you very much
[53:27] for your goodness and grace to us lord
[53:29] now
[53:29] lord you're a god
[53:32] in the in the simple things
[53:34] lord i thank you that you desired
[53:36] a relationship with us so much
[53:39] that you left
[53:41] your limitless world in eternity to
[53:43] become bound
[53:45] in this in the human body of jesus of
[53:47] nazareth lord that we could know you
[53:50] and lord i pray that you would draw us
[53:52] into a closer relationship with you
[53:54] father
[53:55] lord i pray that
[53:57] there are ones who haven't received of
[53:59] you
[53:59] or desire a filling of your holy spirit
[54:02] so that you might float through them
[54:03] even more like i pray you to answer that
[54:05] and lord
[54:06] pray if there are questions one way or
[54:07] the other lord if i said something wrong
[54:09] i prayed forgive me just pray will you
[54:11] make all things clear father i pray to
[54:13] answer each question and it's time oh
[54:15] lord
[54:16] we thank you in jesus name
[54:18] amen
[54:21] amen um can we sing the same god who
[54:25] spoke to the woman at the well the same
[54:27] god

[54:29] that
[54:30] but i know that we've got the he's the
[54:32] same god yes
