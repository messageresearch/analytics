of Christ we believe you can be fed and we pray that you'll be blessed visit our website for more information at literall life. church may God bless you my friend and may the music and message encourage you [Music] today [Music] sometimes I wonder is he faithful does he see me in my trouble does he understand sometimes I question if he's aable can he rescue can he save me again and again [Music] but when I looked back did he move Every Mountain did he part every SE yes he did so yes he came oh did he defeat the darkness did he deliver me yes he did so yes he came oh yes he did [Applause] so yes he can sometimes those voices try to tell me I'm forgotten and I'm falling too far from his hand but I know what kind of God he is and I'm trusting in his promises I'm believing and I'm singing yes he came oh did he move Every Mountain did he part every sea yes he did so yes he oh did he defeat the darkness did he deliver me yes he did so yes he came oh yes he did so yes he can cuz I've seen too much now I can't deny I know he's come through every single time from the beginning until the end he did he will he can did he move Every Mountain did he part every SE yes he did so yes he came did he defeat the darkness did he deliver me yes he did so yes he did did he move Every Mountain did he part every SE yes he did so yes he did he defeat the darkness did he deler me yes he did oh yes he can oh yes he did so yes he did yes he did yes he though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple every day he wanted to dwell in the dwelling place of the Lord and that was his one desire above money above riches above business above anything we need one main desire and that's to stay in the presence of the Lord for in the time of trouble now to me this is a prophetic t uh scripture for our time and we know that in the history of Israel God's people Israel the Jews we know they they come to times of extreme trouble time of trouble Daniel speaks of a time of trouble for the children of Israel and uh so we we realize that'll uh begin to climax towards we get to getting to end time events the trouble will be that the whole world will surround Israel and come against Israel and the whole and armies will surround so now when when David says he's feeling that there's armies encamped about me Israel will go through the same thing and prophecy that they'll be encamped the enemy will be encamped around we spiritually go through what Israel will go through literally and so then he says one thing I have a desire of the Lord and then he says in the time of trouble verse 5 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock that that has a lot of Revelation in it to tell us where this is at number one it's the secret of his Tabernacle it's not out there publicly openly it'll be a secret as to where God's dwelling place is but for the people of God he will show them where he is so that they can live in his presence this last part I want to give he shall set me up upon a rock how many know in the Bible that rock means Revelation so what do we what what is our secret place it's really the re reation that God has given us and you know you can't give yourself a revelation it comes directly he told Peter he says flesh and blood has not revealed this you didn't learn it in seminary my father has given you this Revelation Satan can't get it can't get his grubby mitts on it but when he gives you a revelation it becomes the hiding place and it becomes the stability can you say amen and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing you know what a Believer does when he's surrounded by demon power he raises his hands his head's lifted above all of it and he just starts to praise the Lord and then the devil gets more mad can you say Amen I'm so glad in my trials and troubles I can lift my hands and give a song to the Lord I want to title this today hide me in the safe place of Revelation hide me in the safe place of Revelation while the bride is called into a revelation for the Rapture and that's what we were saying last Sunday that it's actually a revelation the Rapture is a revelation just before our deliverance just before our ultimate deliverance we realize that the increased pressure the armies gathered around us the the pressure will not decrease but it will increase so much so that sometimes mentally we don't know if we can handle it the only cry that we can cry is what David said hide me in your secret place during this time and I believe that's the the the place that you're living in that develops this rapturing Faith builds this rapturing Faith but we know there's great pressure on the outside how many can say Amen there's great pressure on the outside the heat has been turned up on the bride can you say Amen it it it is is it's it's it's in such an an increased state that it's hard to Fathom how much more press pressure can come and and I just want to say this that if that pressure is too much for you and you want that pressure off of you then just stop standing up for the right things if you don't if you can't handle the pressure of this hour then just stop standing for things because a lot of your pressure is because you're standing up for something you're standing for the message of the hour um I'm going to elaborate on that a little bit later but but if you if you don't like the pressure stop stop living a holy life I want to say that it's the one standing on Revelation that are being surrounded and encamped by demons the ones that are experiencing criticism heavy criticism is probably the ones that are making a stand and if you want an easy life without a lot of demons against you then just be a borderline believer today because there's a lot less pressure on a borderline believer but when a Believer makes a stand for the truth and wants to live in Holiness and live in sanctification and stand I believe this message with all my heart get ready for more pressure it's the ones that are making a stand that get more criticism and if you can't take the heat stay out of the kitchen yeah you can release a lot of pressure can you say am man you can get out of a lot of this if you don't make a stand for anything and uh you can you know you can be out of a lot of matter of fact you can there's choices you can make to just release a lot of pressure in your life and just kind of take the normal uh status of this world or maybe a borderline believer it'd be a lot less pressure than this but once you begin to stand once you begin to articulate and speak this message and speak what you believe whatever environment it is if you do that get ready for more pressure and it's not people as much as it is demons don't like somebody to make a stand right amen amen so so you know and and and you got to take a stand for things you think that the trouble in this world is the economy or you think the trouble is the scare of War uh you think your trouble is you don't have enough money to meet your bills this week you think that's my trouble I don't have enough money that's not really your trouble when the Bible says it's a time of trouble it's not it's not that you can't meet your bills this week it's a much deeper trouble than that and I'm not beling that trouble in your life we all have trouble but the trouble the Bible is speaking of is not not just that some friend forsake you or or or you don't have enough money or you lost your job your trouble as standing for a Believer your trouble is a lot deeper than that David was talking about a much deeper trouble a armies encamped around him everything against him can you say amen and so the the the scare of war and money trouble your your trouble is not really that it's much deeper than that and my son so told me something a few weeks ago he said you know I'm learning that there are people that are that drama is so normal in their life they can't live without it I said son that is so true and Lord help me not to be that way drama and something going on in the church and this and that and the other they they live in a soap opera and how many know soap operas aren't real it's a soap opera and they present that as real life but it's not really real life it's a soap opera people like soap opera is going on the church wonder what the pastor why is he doing that why is she why is she doing that why she doing and so they they live in that because it's so normal to them if they come out of that they wouldn't know how to live they like drama they like a good scrap they like a good fight they like competition between families they they create it cuz you are a Creator amen the pressure to choose sides to pull you down but then I go back to that scripture that David said God Is Lifting Me Above All these things can you say amen and I can raise my hand he's going to set me upon the rock of Revelation above my enemies now when you say above it doesn't mean I'm better than my enemies but I'm above it in other words I can live above it I can live in that secret place I can live upon a rock and I got up on the chair last week he said I'm living up here and all down here they're saying come on down fight with us come on down into my fear I'm nervous about stuff can you be nervous with me no I'm not I'm just praising the Lord I will pray for you but I'm not coming down to that level I'm I that you know that's not where I want to live and when God is Raising you to a to higher levels get ready for more [Music] Devils that was borrowed from borrowed from TD Jakes when you want to go to the nextev level get ready for more Devils cuz you can't go to the next level spiritually unless there's a fight to keep you away it's just the way it works because you're making a stand you're making a better stand you're making a higher stand and you don't want to be brought down how many would rais their hand say I don't want to be brought down by people living in fear I don't want to be living with a Jonah can you say amen I want to be praised in the Lord all the time no matter what I'm going through can you say Amen you get up here said no I'm not coming down there why don't you come up here with me and praise the Lord a while why don't you come out of that fear I just want to go into this prophecy of Israel just a little bit the theme of Prophecy for Israel is to in Prophecy to become surrounded by the enemy literally the world against them and many Jews see and believe prophecy of Deliverance they believe it today that their Messiah will deliver them they believe the the the Deliverance part but they don't see what comes before their Deliverance they don't understand that and there will be great armies gather around that uh that uh piece of land there and it's not because of the piece of land necessarily but it's who's there and God's people and so we see then that the the armies I'm going to skip some of this because some of some of this is revisiting what I've already preached on before but I just wanted to bring in this element of Israel literally now and so if you turn with me to Daniel 12 we'll see something happen here when all the armies gather around just after all the armies uh in Prophecy all surround Israel in Daniel CH 12 and at that time and this is a time where the pressure will come shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such has never was since there was a nation even to that same time now Israel had a lot of trouble through the years they had 6,000 years of trouble they had times of trouble they had times when they went Rebellion against God and they went into Babylon into captivity they had a lot of troubling times but this scripture says at the end they've never had any trouble compared to this trouble and I just look at that spiritually and say that for the bride spiritually there's no trouble like we're having now in the spiritual realm there's no other pressure like we're having now now you say brother Paul I don't know what you're talking about my life is good I'm doing pretty good I got a good salary and everything's pretty comfortable um so I'd only say to that what are you doing right I'd say that first but then I would say check your life because anybody who's making a stand and that's the elect of God the guns are pointed on you it says says now the the the the and it talks in the Bible here let me just finish this in the time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even at the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that should be found written in the book notice now there's the elect written in the book of life so we got several reasons now why the armies are encamped around this particular people right they're in the Book of Life can't you remember that when you're being surrounded can't you remember that there's a reason that I'm being fought with demons probably because my name is in the book of life and I'm the elected can you say amen and I'm part of him now we'll go to book of the revelations Revelations 12:17 just another small element I want to bring in that you would understand why there's an increased demonic power and Satan maybe is in in the time where he's very nervous and he's you know he doesn't understand the word he doesn't understand Revelation and he can't have what the bride has he can't have it this is why he's jealous that's why he fights against it to stop it you know you've always had what the devil wanted yeah that's right amen with Adam and Eve he had the creative power and was the ruler of this Earth and that's what devil wanted from so from the very start you the Believers have always possessed by Revelation and had it in them what the devil wanted and you wonder why he's against you and he can never have it he can't ever have has never had it and can't ever have what you have that's enough to have a really shouting time on Monday put it on your refrigerator if you have to devil you will never have what I [Applause] have and and from the beginning I like to point this out it's like he comes on the scene because he's jealous of what Adam and Eve have and eventually he had to be kicked out you know what actually it happened before he was kicked out of heaven he he got this stir with all the the brothers the angels and a third part of the angels with influence with him to come against he wanted to raise his kingdom so he was jealous he couldn't have the position he wanted and so now he creates a certain finally they he was kicked out of heaven with his angels He was kicked out on Earth he's kicked out of the garden even the Sun and daughter were kicked out of the garden because they fell with him he was kicked out then there's tension between uh Isaac and uh ishmail there's tension between Cain and Abel and then then that ended and then there's tension between ishmail and Isaac and he had to be kicked out of the camp we got to get rid of cast out the Bond woman and her son and then I could go scripture after scripture where the tension Rises he gets kicked out the tension Rises he gets kicked out did why do you let this guy bother you when he's been kicked out of every believer's situation from the beginning if he's been kicked out all the way through then why don't you give him the boot every now and then he's used to it he's used to being kicked out amen all the way to the end when we get the Book of Revelation and Satan and his angels will be cast out the accuser of who the accuser of the Brethren stood there with tension with accusations keeping things tense all the time accusing accusing in your ear every day brother Joe in your ear every day brother Bob and but but one day one day it's the same history he's going to be kicked out and you'll never hear that voice again it's his history I don't know how he can't look in the Book of Revelations and see his end is he's going to be kicked out at the very end of it kick out of the atmospheres kicked out of heaven kicked off the Earth so the bride can come back and enjoy this without the devil here praise God hallelujah give him the boot every day because he's used to [Music] it when he's trying to come in and make you a god goip or give them the boot and stop your family and say we don't do that because that's the realm the devil Works in give them a boot that's not you you're teaching your children to be gossipers teaching your children to be accusers of the Brethren to be accusations against Elders that's a serious thing no no that's not the kingdom of God that's Satan's kingdom we're not in a picnic here what I'm preaching here and what you're you're trying to live is not a picnic it's what the devil hates he hates Revelation he hates people growing in the Lord he hates Unity amongst the people of God he hates it that's right in the time of trouble the time of trouble is the time of Deliverance and this is what he says in Psalms 27 in in the time of trouble he will hide me so in this time of trouble is the time for our deliverance and a Rapture if we're surrounded by the enemy ganged up on by the enemy guess what and it's if it's showing no relief it it it and it shows nothing in the prophecy for it to stop uh you know and the thing is is that until God steps in he lets the pressure continue he lets the pressure go the only hope we have is a hiding place until he delivers us in a Rapture but we have that hiding place the only thing it's doing is setting us up for the total deliverance and that's a Rapture my friends if you hear the Simplicity of what I'm expressing for my spiritual life and your spiritual life the only place we need the one desire we need to be in every day is to live in that secure safe place in the word Daniel 3 so if you're talking about being surrounded All Through the Bible you have it but here's some guys that Daniel chapter 3 verse 8 for at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accused the Jews they spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar oh King live forever forever thou oh King H has made a degree that every man that shall hear the sound of their cornet uh flute harp sack butt Sultry damer and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image um I like to preach a little sermon in here that did you notice bowing to the image was associated with all kinds of music music was used to open their emotions to bow to the image because music is used to open up your emotions we use it here in the service but what is it opening up your heart to receive right and who shall fth not down and woreth that he should be cast in the midst of the burning fiery furnace there are certain Jews whom the whom thou Hast set over the Affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach Meshach and abedo these men oh King have not regarded thee they serve not thy gods or worship the golden image which thou has set up then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage point this man was mad but now he's in a rage and what is he in a rage about what is his in his anger increased about believers who made a stand against him that's what it was about his anger increased his rage increased I'm going to do something more now because I'm angry why am I angry because they won't join in with the rest and bow to the same thing they're not going to Bow his rage was increased then Nebuchadnezzar and his rage and fury commanded to bring sh can you imagine we get mad at a lot of things but can you imagine what this guy is on rage and fury about he's against three believers who make a stand when you make a stand see some of you today I'm I'm I'm encouraging you I pray you feel the pull of the Lord for your family your wife girlfriend whatever it is I I pray that you feel the pull through the preaching that Christ is pulling you because you haven't made a stand yet you haven't made a real stand but you need to make a stand you're a daddy you need to make a stand for the rest of the family yeah so he's in a rage he's in a fury verse 14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true oh Shadrach Meshach Ando do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I set up now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sagbut Sury damer I don't know why all the names of the instruments are mentioned again and all kinds of music ye shall Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made well but if ye worship not ye shall be cast in the same hour into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands threats pressure anger coming against you wow so he
