[0:00] 18 and he says and said they then said i
[0:03] unto them
[0:04] ye see the distress that we are in in
[0:07] how jerusalem lay uh a
[0:10] waste
[0:12] in the gates thereon are burned with
[0:14] fire
[0:15] come let us build up the wall of
[0:18] jerusalem the way that we be no more our
[0:21] reproach
[0:23] then i told them
[0:25] of
[0:26] and then i told them of the hand of my
[0:28] god which was good upon me and as also
[0:32] the king's
[0:34] words that he had spoken unto me
[0:37] and they said let us rise
[0:39] let us rise up and build so they
[0:41] strengthen their hands for
[0:44] this good work amen
[0:46] so today by god's grace if we if we can
[0:49] title
[0:50] this i i did this bible study with the
[0:53] youth a few a couple of years or three
[0:55] years ago so
[0:57] it's a lengthy one but we're gonna take
[0:59] two hours tonight amen i know we
[1:01] understand is is uh wednesday and you
[1:03] may be tired but we're just gonna get
[1:05] where the lord wants us to get amen so
[1:08] the we we can title this redemption the
[1:12] king's words amen
[1:14] so uh you know the prophet of god tells
[1:16] us and he he says that when we read our
[1:19] bible we must seek christ through the
[1:21] scriptures if we don't we have to go
[1:23] back and read the scriptures and read
[1:26] and read the bible again until we see
[1:28] christ amen and one more thing now is
[1:31] not only we have to see christ but we
[1:34] now we have to see ourselves in the
[1:36] scriptures amen and and with that in
[1:39] mind we we can we can start this evening
[1:41] you know we read in the book of
[1:42] revelations that there is a holy city
[1:45] that is descending that city has walls
[1:47] that city also have 12 gates amen and
[1:50] and we have we have
[1:52] heard many times the prophet of god
[1:54] saying that jerusalem that we are seeing
[1:58] in in the in the book of revelations now
[2:01] it is talking about about us that's what
[2:03] we're saying like when as i said when we
[2:05] were reading john was seeing a finnish
[2:09] product
[2:10] and i can imagine john was rejoicing
[2:12] because he's like i'm not seeing a a
[2:15] church i'm not seeing a bride that is
[2:17] defeated or a bride that is incomplete
[2:20] i'm seeing someone that is shining
[2:22] someone that is perfect and now that
[2:25] that perfection he is he he was seeing
[2:28] you he was seeing me amen
[2:31] so
[2:32] you know
[2:33] we're talking about that that's the
[2:35] lamps well the the lamps wife and and
[2:38] and then that gate that um city it has
[2:43] gates amen
[2:44] so in in those gates they have to be in
[2:47] perfect conditions amen and that's what
[2:49] we're looking forward tonight
[2:51] if if we can think about a process and
[2:54] that we can ask ourselves in where where
[2:57] am i
[2:58] in that part of the process amen do i
[3:00] need salvation tonight
[3:03] he is my savior do i need healing he is
[3:06] my healer do i need to be adopted he is
[3:08] my father
[3:10] so now if we now enter into the book of
[3:13] nehemiah we can see that in the first
[3:16] chapters we see how there was a desire
[3:19] in nehemiah's heart to rebuild the city
[3:22] because you know when he comes before
[3:24] the king
[3:26] the king saw his face and his
[3:28] countenance he was like he was sad and
[3:30] he was like what's going on nehemiah
[3:32] you're supposed to be happy in the
[3:34] presence of the king
[3:36] but there was something in nehemiah's
[3:38] heart that he was not fulfilled that he
[3:41] was incomplete and he's like they asked
[3:43] him what's going on in and he was a well
[3:46] you know my people my city the walls the
[3:49] gates everything is destroyed and then
[3:52] he went in the presence of the king and
[3:54] the king told him as we read in the
[3:56] second chapter then he
[3:58] then he went back to them and told them
[4:00] what the king had told him
[4:03] because now when he's in in the presence
[4:05] of the people when he when he he was in
[4:08] the presence of the king then the king
[4:10] gives him letters then the king gives
[4:13] him kind of the the the
[4:16] the materials if you will so that he can
[4:18] go back and rebuild or he or he gives
[4:21] him money so he can come back he can go
[4:23] back and rebuild amen so when he goes
[4:26] back to his people and he's like we have
[4:28] i'm here in jerusalem and you are all
[4:30] distressed
[4:33] we are all distressed that we are in now
[4:35] how jerusalem is is wasted jerusalem is
[4:39] destroyed but guess what there is
[4:42] someone that has been sent with a
[4:45] commission with a desire to reveal the
[4:48] city
[4:49] so this day
[4:51] we can say it is the same thing there
[4:53] was a prophet that was sent the prophet
[4:55] is gone but still god is rebuilding the
[4:58] city
[4:59] god is restoring the people god is
[5:02] changing the hearts god is giving
[5:05] salvation to those that need salvation
[5:07] god is still giving you peace give he is
[5:10] still giving you joy
[5:13] amen
[5:14] and what i like from this scripture that
[5:16] you can see on the screen is like then i
[5:19] told them of the hand of my god which
[5:22] god
[5:23] which was good upon me i'm coming here
[5:25] with by by with the hand of my god
[5:28] and not only that but
[5:30] also i'm here with the king's words
[5:34] how when we received a commission these
[5:37] days the prophet of god when he was in
[5:39] up in that mountain he received the
[5:41] king's
[5:42] sword
[5:44] he's the same the same thing talking
[5:47] about restoration talking about a change
[5:49] that we need to have that needs to
[5:51] happen in our lives
[5:53] amen
[5:55] so there was a desire in your mind he's
[5:57] like i need to reveal the gates i need
[5:59] to do something with this with this with
[6:02] the walls with the gates they cannot be
[6:04] like that for the rest of our lives
[6:08] amen
[6:10] so before we go
[6:12] further you know the prophet of god says
[6:14] there was an old
[6:15] you know these old biol violinists
[6:19] he had no violin and he was going to
[6:22] sell that violin
[6:23] and
[6:24] they wanted to sell it for a certain
[6:26] thing you know the actioner said well
[6:28] who gave me so and so
[6:30] and i believe he was offered just a few
[6:32] coins maybe 50 cents or something
[6:36] and then he says going once going twice
[6:40] and then directly there are men raised
[6:42] up in the back and he said just a minute
[6:44] he woke up and he got it
[6:47] and the prophet of god you know we can
[6:49] say that he had that violin and then he
[6:51] started tuning it he started adjusting
[6:54] the the the strings there and and and
[6:57] everything and and then with with the
[7:00] the the ark how is it called like the
[7:03] ball yeah then he started fixing that
[7:06] and then he started playing this song
[7:08] and the prophet of god says he started
[7:09] maybe playing there is a fountain filled
[7:12] with blood drawn from emmanuel's veins
[7:14] when sinners plunge beneath the flood
[7:16] lose all their guilty slave stain
[7:19] then he laid it down
[7:21] and then he says there wasn't a dry eye
[7:24] in the place
[7:25] why because
[7:27] and then he asked like
[7:28] who offered five thousand ten thousand
[7:31] it was priceless
[7:33] why
[7:35] because the master
[7:37] of the violin had revealed its true
[7:41] quality
[7:42] amen how many times we have feel that we
[7:44] we are we're worth nothing but the
[7:47] master of the violin have come tonight
[7:50] and he has revealed our true worth a
[7:53] real worth and the prophet of god says
[7:55] that we are worth more than ten thousand
[7:58] million worlds
[8:00] and then he says oh brothers sister now
[8:03] let the master of this world
[8:07] who wrote it the great holy spirit
[8:10] rosing up his bone with love and pull it
[8:13] across your heart
[8:15] i will lie that in my heart lord may you
[8:18] come tonight and and whatever my need is
[8:21] lord may you can't come in and change
[8:23] the atmosphere changed my life changed
[8:26] my heart
[8:28] man now if if as i said in the book of
[8:31] nehemiah he's talking about uh he was
[8:34] trying to
[8:36] restore something so we see that they
[8:39] revealed the walls and now he he was
[8:42] like you know what we need to do
[8:43] something else because you know the
[8:46] there was a way that they have to go to
[8:47] the city amen so in order for them to
[8:50] enter into the city there were gates
[8:53] amen and as we read here in the book of
[8:55] revelations the city had 12 gates amen
[8:58] so that's what we want to look at
[8:59] tonight amen there were gates in the old
[9:03] jerusalem and in the in the future
[9:05] jerusalem or in the
[9:07] jerusalem that is to come there were 12
[9:09] gates in the old jerusalem there are 12
[9:11] gates
[9:12] amen so we want to see that tonight
[9:15] so as we said when nehemiah goes back to
[9:17] jerusalem
[9:19] he goes around the wall and he sees that
[9:22] it is destroyed
[9:23] and not just the wall is destroyed but
[9:25] also the gates of the city they are
[9:27] destroyed
[9:29] but in him there was a desire so i was
[9:31] saying there was a desire to reveal the
[9:34] wall and reveal the gates to restore
[9:37] that formic lord that that former glory
[9:40] to jerusalem
[9:42] amen and but then then as we read the
[9:45] hand of god was with him and now so the
[9:48] king's words were with nehemiah
[9:51] and one thing he had the king's support
[9:53] to restore
[9:55] he got he had the
[9:56] the king we can say it nowadays the
[9:59] king's endorsement endorsement to
[10:02] restore that city
[10:04] and
[10:05] one thing that i was thinking is like he
[10:08] comes straight from the king's presence
[10:11] with a task
[10:13] amen and he comes from the king's
[10:16] presence with a task he comes with a
[10:18] commission straight from the presence of
[10:20] the king hey i need to restore i need to
[10:23] reveal
[10:26] amen
[10:28] if that was in the natural
[10:30] now you have the king's word today to
[10:33] restore your life
[10:35] certainly you know there were so many
[10:37] obstacles to reveal the wall in the
[10:39] gates but that wasn't a problem for him
[10:42] or his people because he had the word of
[10:44] the king
[10:46] amen so we see our lives
[10:49] how our life our maybe our lives were
[10:52] hurt our life where our lives were
[10:54] destroyed by our by our decisions and
[10:57] people that have come and that have left
[11:00] amen but we can also see the obstacles
[11:03] also the enemy trying to destroy the
[11:06] lord's work in our lives but the
[11:08] believer we have promises given by
[11:12] god and then
[11:15] we have the hand of god and the king's
[11:17] letters that say i will restore and i
[11:20] was thinking about this scripture in
[11:22] order it doesn't say i'm gonna send
[11:24] someone to restore it says i will
[11:27] restore
[11:28] it is beautiful when you start looking
[11:30] at the scriptures when when he's in the
[11:32] in the in the personal pronoun i is
[11:35] because he is that work is so special
[11:37] for him that he has to do it
[11:40] i will restore i will descend
[11:43] amen it brings security to us that he
[11:46] will finish the work of restoration no
[11:49] matter what
[11:51] if you feel defeated tonight if you feel
[11:54] disappointed if you feel discouraged
[11:56] tonight just rest assured in that that
[11:59] he has said i will restore
[12:04] amen
[12:06] by his grace he put that in my anointing
[12:09] to rebuild
[12:10] to rebuild us to bring us back to our
[12:13] former glory you know the scripture says
[12:16] in the book of hagai it says the glory
[12:19] of this later house of this latter house
[12:22] shall be greater than of the former
[12:24] house of the former glory said the lord
[12:26] of hosts and in this place will i give
[12:29] peace i will give you peace i will
[12:32] restore you i will descend
[12:37] think about it you're so special to god
[12:39] that it is his word he's not sending
[12:42] somebody else to do the work he's saying
[12:44] i will restore i will design i will
[12:47] descend i will change your heart i will
[12:50] give you a new heart i will give you a
[12:51] new spirit i will give you a new life
[12:54] i will go and prepare a place for you
[12:58] if you are not
[13:00] if you don't don't get it tonight or you
[13:02] haven't gotten enough and gotten it in
[13:04] all these years i don't know
[13:07] but he's doing the work he says i
[13:09] so lord you are you are the i am as you
[13:12] said you as moses was like who is
[13:14] sending me you sold them there i am he's
[13:17] sending me
[13:19] is sending you moses
[13:21] amen
[13:22] what is that former glory
[13:24] it's our life before we we met the lord
[13:28] what is that louder glory or later glory
[13:30] is our life
[13:32] after he came and started his work in us
[13:37] that's why nehemiah was so sure about it
[13:39] he's like i have the king's word i have
[13:42] the king's letter and the hand of the
[13:44] lord is with me therefore i will go
[13:50] oh lord give us give us that courage
[13:52] that nehemiah had
[13:54] and now lord establish your kingdom in
[13:57] our hearts
[13:58] amen
[14:06] now we can start with the first one
[14:09] if you will here it says nehemiah
[14:11] chapter 3 verse 1.
[14:14] and i want you to look at the types in
[14:16] the shadows because they are talking
[14:18] about some something that is so
[14:20] beautiful you know that's why i said at
[14:21] the beginning if when you're reading the
[14:23] scripture you don't see christ and you
[14:25] have to you have to go back if you when
[14:27] you're reading the scriptures and you
[14:29] don't see yourself you have to go back
[14:30] and read the scriptures
[14:32] because this is not just a book full of
[14:34] information it is good you know like
[14:37] kind of a good of good practices and
[14:39] things but this is more than that
[14:41] this is life for us amen and then
[14:44] here in nehemiah chapter three verse one
[14:46] it says daniel eliashif
[14:48] and then i was looking you know some
[14:50] sometimes we go and and look up for for
[14:52] um the meanings and things so
[14:57] this was a high priest that rose up with
[15:00] his brethren the priest and they builded
[15:03] the ship gate they sanctified it and
[15:06] they set up the doors of it even unto
[15:09] the tower of mia they they sanctified
[15:11] onto the tower of hanonel
[15:13] but i want you to notice here this was a
[15:16] high priest and look what his name means
[15:18] his name means the god of conversion the
[15:22] god that can change or the god of
[15:24] translation
[15:27] so here
[15:30] this restoration in your life
[15:33] starts with a high priest
[15:36] isn't it amazing
[15:39] if i ask you tonight what is the office
[15:41] of a high priest he's an intercessor
[15:45] he's interceding for you and that's why
[15:48] he is our christ is our high priest that
[15:50] he is interceding for us every day
[15:53] amen jesus is our high priest and he is
[15:56] our intercessor
[15:58] that's why he's studying the work in us
[16:00] because we need that
[16:02] we need to be safe to enter into his
[16:05] kingdom amen you belong to god you are
[16:09] engraved on the palm of his hand and
[16:12] nothing can not nothing can take you
[16:14] from there
[16:16] how many of us needed salvation we we
[16:19] needed to be safe in order for us to
[16:21] come into the kingdom of god
[16:23] so he sent the high priest that that
[16:26] sacrifice of as we said it before that
[16:29] suck the high priest that had to go
[16:30] every year but now that's that that
[16:33] sacrifice or that uh high priest doesn't
[16:36] have to go every year now the veil was
[16:40] open the veil was rent and now how many
[16:43] times can i go into the holy of colius i
[16:46] can go now every day every hour every
[16:49] minute
[16:50] if i need salvation lord restore unto me
[16:54] the joy of my salvation
[16:56] restore to me what the what the enemy
[16:59] has taken away
[17:01] but here had we had to have the nehemiah
[17:04] annoying thing wanting to restore
[17:06] something
[17:11] you are engraved on the palm of his hand
[17:13] and nothing can take you from there
[17:16] he reached down his hands for us
[17:20] i mean what what does this gate speaks
[17:23] about
[17:24] it speaks about
[17:26] salvation
[17:28] it speaks about sacrifice
[17:31] it speaks about the gate this gate shows
[17:34] that we need salvation and the sacrifice
[17:37] he made for us at calvary amen that's
[17:40] what this gate means in other words you
[17:42] know when the lord starts his process in
[17:44] our life
[17:45] you you didn't
[17:46] go you know if we put it this way you
[17:48] didn't learn algebra before knowing your
[17:51] basic math
[17:53] so in order for for for you to to grow
[17:55] in christ you first need the foundation
[17:57] and the foundation i will say is
[17:58] salvation
[18:00] amen
[18:02] so now
[18:04] john
[18:05] 14
[18:06] i mean john 10 26 through 30 he says my
[18:10] sheep they hear my voice and i know them
[18:14] and they follow me
[18:16] you know
[18:17] when the prophet of god speaks of a
[18:18] sheep like he's talking that that that
[18:20] is the
[18:21] the the the most meek the mikas i would
[18:24] put it that way
[18:26] animal that you know if you leave that
[18:28] if you leave them they will die they
[18:30] need someone to guide them
[18:32] and then here john talking and says and
[18:35] i i give them unto them i give unto them
[18:37] eternal life and they shall never perish
[18:40] neither shall any men plug them can
[18:42] pluck them out of my hand because my
[18:44] father which gave them is greater than
[18:47] all and no man is able to pluck them out
[18:49] of my father's hand
[18:51] because and now he says i and my father
[18:55] are what we are now one
[19:01] so that's why he now if he wants us to
[19:03] come through the ship gate he has to
[19:05] liken us onto a ship
[19:08] that's why he's like i'm the i'm the
[19:10] good shepherd
[19:12] so if i'm a shepherd there has to be
[19:16] amen
[19:17] and now psalms 41 through and 2 it says
[19:20] i waited patiently for the lord and he
[19:23] inclined unto me and heard my cry
[19:27] and he brought me up also out of a
[19:29] horrible pit out of the miry clay and he
[19:32] set my feet up on a rock and established
[19:35] my coins
[19:37] when salvation comes to you he
[19:39] establishes your goings amen he
[19:42] establishes your steps now you you are
[19:44] gonna be led
[19:47] amen that's what you when you're when
[19:49] you're thinking about a process you have
[19:51] to come and you have to be safe first
[19:53] and then he's going to start a process
[19:57] and then you know as the scripture says
[19:58] that he that began a good the good work
[20:02] he will finish he will finish the good
[20:04] work in the day of the lord but he has
[20:06] started the work if he has started the
[20:08] work he's going to finish the work
[20:10] so how is he studying the work the work
[20:13] well how is he going to start it by us
[20:16] being safe
[20:19] but now he's setting my feet up on a
[20:21] rock and now i can walk in his
[20:24] commandments in his statutes amen so now
[20:28] this again this game shows the need that
[20:30] i need salvation
[20:33] i need to be saved because that's one of
[20:36] his attributes in order for him to to
[20:38] save someone there has to be some
[20:41] someone that is lost
[20:45] and the sacrifice also this gate also
[20:47] shows the sacrifice that he made for us
[20:49] at calvary
[20:51] amen
[20:52] now
[20:55] there is another gate here number two
[20:59] the fish gate
[21:06] it says but the fish gate
[21:08] did the sons of hasena
[21:11] they built
[21:12] hasanah build who also laid the beams
[21:15] thereof instead of the doors they're off
[21:18] the locks they're off and the bars
[21:20] they're off
[21:21] so what i want you to notice is that
[21:24] when they were repairing those gates
[21:27] they didn't leave anything incomplete
[21:30] they were making sure that all the posts
[21:33] in the beams and everything was
[21:36] perfectly
[21:37] in its place
[21:40] and when god comes to your life
[21:43] as we were hearing on sunday you know
[21:45] you may have to go through through some
[21:47] kind of bitter uh bitter bitter times
[21:49] but that's also because the lord is kind
[21:51] of fixing that those gates in our lives
[21:54] he's fixing something in our lives so
[21:56] then we he when he looks at it at the
[21:59] end he's like well this is perfect
[22:00] that's how i like it
[22:02] amen sometimes we don't like it but
[22:04] that's that's that's the way it is
[22:06] you know after there is a need of
[22:09] salvation from within your heart the
[22:11] lord puts a desire in in you what is
[22:15] this fish gate this this gate is the
[22:18] gate of the testimony after you're saved
[22:21] now there is a desire in your heart now
[22:23] you want to share the good news with
[22:25] everybody hey i was saved i received
[22:27] christ
[22:29] he puts that desire in you to be a
[22:31] testimony that he lives in that he has
[22:34] done something in your life that he has
[22:37] taken away all the burdens that you were
[22:39] carrying for years and now that you're
[22:42] free now you can testify that to other
[22:44] people
[22:46] because god will always have something
[22:48] to show in your life to others
[22:51] amen
[22:53] sometimes we don't like that but that's
[22:54] how it is amen if he he needs someone on
[22:57] this earth to display his attributes
[23:01] and if someone is willing lord when we
[23:03] say we're willing
[23:04] we will have to share our testimony
[23:07] amen
[23:08] i can just say help me lord
[23:11] that my testimony attract others that
[23:14] you're still god in the 21st century
[23:18] and we
[23:19] listen to this we can say that in heaven
[23:22] there was perfection
[23:24] and in the midst of perfection
[23:26] there was one that exalted himself and
[23:29] he was brought down to earth
[23:31] that was lucifer
[23:34] and then in the garden of eden there was
[23:37] also perfection
[23:38] and there was adam and eve they were
[23:41] perfect but there was the original scene
[23:43] that cast cuts them out of the garden of
[23:45] eden
[23:47] you know in the midst of perfection
[23:49] imperfection try tries to try to sneak
[23:52] in
[23:53] amen
[23:55] but what a testimony we can say tonight
[23:58] that in the midst of satan's eden
[24:01] the lord is bringing a bride to
[24:04] perfection
[24:06] the lord is showing the world that even
[24:08] though satan's eaten we're living in the
[24:10] midst of it there is a bride there is a
[24:13] people that they are they are going to
[24:15] perfection
[24:17] amen
[24:25] that is the greatest testimony that
[24:26] could ever exist you know sons and
[24:29] daughters of god
[24:30] living in this evil age
[24:33] and still reflecting the life of christ
[24:37] isn't that amazing
[24:40] that is we can say that is a paradox
[24:42] amen
[24:44] you know this this is an insane age
[24:46] people is kind of
[24:47] you know
[24:48] all sort of things and we're still with
[24:51] sound minds
[24:52] that we can still think for ourselves
[24:55] a man that we can still sleep in that we
[24:58] we are not we we may deal with
[25:00] depression with anxiety but we we know
[25:02] where to go we know where to bring those
[25:05] things and he will give us that rest
[25:08] amen that's what he promised that i will
[25:10] give you rest come come to me all you
[25:12] that are weary and heavy laden and i
[25:15] will give you rest
[25:16] you see again i will give you rest
[25:19] i will restore
[25:21] amen
[25:23] now
[25:24] you know the first gate was about
[25:26] salvation the second gate is like now
[25:28] i'm saved now i have to share my
[25:30] testimony how the lord saved me how the
[25:32] lord filled me how how would the things
[25:34] that he's done in my life
[25:36] but now
[25:38] he brings us to to to an ex
[25:40] another gate
[25:42] and that's the oil gate
[25:44] you know moreover the old gate repaired
[25:47] jehoiada
[25:49] in the son of paseo in in meshulam in
[25:51] the son of besoidea
[25:54] they laid the beams there off and set up
[25:55] the doors are off and the locks are off
[25:57] and the bars they're off
[25:59] what is this all gate it is talking
[26:02] about the old experience
[26:05] amen
[26:07] the prophet of god you know we can say
[26:09] that give me that old-time religion if
[26:12] it was good for the prophets
[26:14] it is also good enough for me
[26:16] and the prophet of god says i believe in
[26:19] an old-time backwoods sky blue sink
[26:23] killing religion
[26:25] yes sir that kills out sin and self in
[26:28] yourself and you're born again of the
[26:30] spirit of god and you're living now for
[26:33] him
[26:34] amen that's the kind of religion that we
[26:37] can say that will save savior not a
[26:39] religion of you know of just a kind of
[26:42] uh
[26:43] conforming but a religion that is gonna
[26:45] change our mindset that is gonna change
[26:47] our life for the good
[26:50] and you know one thing i i noticed in
[26:52] these quotes that we're gonna put here
[26:53] on the screen in this first one he's
[26:55] saying i believe
[26:57] that we that we need an all-time
[26:59] backwoods religion
[27:00] and then in this other one he said he
[27:03] says what we need
[27:04] is an old-fashioned godsend it's called
[27:07] the religion
[27:09] that will escalate worldliness out of
[27:11] the church
[27:13] we need to come back to what to the holy
[27:16] ghost and fire
[27:17] back to the things that burn out the
[27:19] draws brings the old-fashioned preaching
[27:22] back

[27:26] amen we need that kind of a preaching in
[27:29] other words if that gate in your life
[27:32] needs to be repaired lord tonight give
[27:35] me that old time experience that i had a
[27:37] year ago
[27:38] helped me to renew my experience every
[27:41] day lord i want that old-time religion
[27:44] that is burning the scene out of my life
[27:49] he's saying i believe
[27:51] what we need
[27:52] and now he's he says what the the church
[27:55] is hungering now the church is hungering
[27:58] today that once more they all fashion
[28:03] god send revival from the pulpit plum to
[28:06] the janitor and that old fashioned
[28:09] cleaning up an old-fashioned revival
[28:12] amen
[28:14] how many won that tonight
[28:16] with the power of god a gospel that
[28:18] cleans a man from the inside out
[28:22] how many want that
[28:24] he takes all the hollywood out of you
[28:28] there was there he was praying not a new
[28:30] denomination not a new creed but of
[28:32] indication of the word
[28:35] i believe
[28:37] we need the church is hungering today
[28:40] and if you're hungering for something
[28:42] tonight the lord can come and give you
[28:45] that he can provide that bread for you
[28:47] so that you won't go hungry anymore
[28:50] that gate needs to be repaired sometimes
[28:54] salvation
[28:56] testimony that all experience that you
[29:00] were just crying
[29:01] and i can say on sunday what while the
[29:03] preaching was going what was what's
[29:05] going i was just crying i was like
[29:07] that's a good experience but lord don't
[29:09] let it be just tears coming out of my
[29:11] eyes but a real change in my heart
[29:15] if i'm going the wrong the wrong way
[29:17] lord come and change that
[29:19] that's what i want
[29:22] or we want that old religion that brings
[29:24] the sinner to repentance
[29:26] that changes the drunkard to a son of
[29:28] god
[29:30] amen
[29:32] now
[29:34] this takes us back to another gate
[29:38] it takes us to the valley gate
[29:40] what is the valley
[29:43] the valley gate repair
[29:45] hanun and they have inhabitants of sanoa
[29:49] they built it and they set it up and the
[29:51] doors are off and everything and you
[29:53] know here hanun
[29:56] his name means
[29:57] gracious his name means merciful
[30:00] in other words when you go and look at
[30:02] all of these like all these people that
[30:03] were repairing they were typing christ
[30:05] as well
[30:08] amen
[30:09] this gates speaks to us about humility
[30:12] it is the gate of the small things
[30:16] amen
[30:17] isaiah 41 through 5 it says comfort he
[30:20] come for ye my people say your god
[30:24] speaking comfortably to jerusalem i mean
[30:26] crying to her that her warfare is
[30:28] accomplished that her iniquity her
[30:31] iniquity is pardoned for she had
[30:34] received of the lord's hand double of
[30:36] for all her sins
[30:42] but it doesn't doesn't stay there
[30:44] he's now speaks about the voice of him
[30:46] that cried in the wilderness prepare ye
[30:50] the way of the lord
[30:51] make a street
[30:53] in the desert a highway for our god
[30:56] every valley shall be exalted and every
[31:00] mountain in hill shall be made low and
[31:02] the crooked shall be made as straight in
[31:04] the rough places plain
[31:08] and the glory of the lord shall be
[31:09] revealed and all flesh shall see it
[31:12] shall see together for the mouth of the
[31:13] lord had spoken it what is true humility
[31:16] is to obey all the word that comes from
[31:19] the mother of god in its fullness
[31:22] that is is if if the word is coming and
[31:24] it's correct in my life lord i humble
[31:26] myself and i say help me change my heart
[31:30] amen the world we the word will always
[31:32] make us to recognize our mistakes
[31:36] and listen to this greatness
[31:38] to be great greatness will never hide
[31:41] the fact that you are a sinner
[31:45] amen if you want to be great you have to
[31:48] humble yourself
[31:51] humility it was it is what brought the
[31:54] lord to glory and arrogance is what
[31:56] brought lucifer from heaven
[31:59] i he and what what was lucifer's
[32:01] position he's like i will ascend and i
[32:04] will make myself greater or the same as
[32:07] god
[32:08] he wanted to be worshiped
[32:10] but it was not his place he wanted to be
[32:13] praised but he he wasn't called for that
[32:16] purpose
[32:17] his purpose was just to worship god
[32:22] amen
[32:23] and you know we we know in the
[32:24] scriptures that even there was one king
[32:27] that he was he he was his office he was
[32:30] good as a king but he wanted to do the
[32:33] office of a priest
[32:35] and and the priests were like no this is
[32:37] not your position and then he he got he
[32:40] he was he god sent him a
[32:43] leprosy and then he died a leper why
[32:46] because he was out of his position
[32:49] and you know how many how many people
[32:51] can be living stuck at this gate because
[32:54] they if they don't recognize their
[32:56] position in christ the only thing that
[32:58] will produce in them that will be
[33:00] arrogance
[33:01] because the lord wants to bring you
[33:03] beyond
[33:04] humility he wants to bring you to
[33:06] another level he wants to bring you
[33:08] beyond salvation beyond your testimony
[33:11] beyond beyond that all of fashion
[33:14] experience now he wants to bring
[33:16] humility but he wants to bring it to
[33:18] another level
[33:20] but people get stuck there in that gate
[33:23] and they say well i know better than the
[33:25] pastor
[33:26] i know better than the deacon or the
[33:28] prophet i can guide i can i can be my
[33:31] own guide
[33:32] but guess what he's a blind leading the
[33:35] blind
[33:37] but help us lord to be of a meek in a
[33:39] humble heart that's my desire tonight
[33:43] and peter says humble yourselves
[33:46] therefore under under the mighty hand of
[33:49] god that he may exalt you in when when
[33:52] it is time
[33:53] and then when you humble yourself it
[33:55] doesn't stay there because now he says
[33:57] casting all your care upon him because
[34:00] he cares for you
[34:03] so when i humble myself lord that means
[34:05] that you're going to care take care of
[34:06] my spouse or my life you're going to
[34:08] take care of my needs yes that is
[34:10] correct
[34:11] humble yourself say lord i just come
[34:14] tonight and i just humbled my life
[34:16] humble myself to you so that you can use
[34:19] me for your glory and i know that you're
[34:21] going to take care of me
[34:23] now philippians 2 6 through 9 it says
[34:28] verse 8 and being found in a fashion as
[34:30] a man he humbled himself
[34:33] if the god of glory he humbled himself
[34:36] how much more we that are humans
[34:40] but guess what if if you have received
[34:42] him if you have received salvation from
[34:45] him if the seed of god is living in you
[34:48] you're going to produce the same fruits
[34:51] amen
[34:53] it is like and he became obedient unto
[34:55] death even the death of the cross and
[34:58] wherefore god also had highly exalted
[35:01] him why because he humbled himself
[35:04] you know when when he came to earth they
[35:06] thought that he was going to be the king
[35:08] coming from heaven on on a big horse and
[35:11] and things like that but he came as he
[35:13] and he was born in in the humblest place
[35:16] on earth
[35:18] why just to show them that he can go to
[35:20] the lowest
[35:21] to bring them to the highest
[35:24] amen
[35:28] because he got it also had exalted a
[35:31] highly exalted him and gave him a name
[35:34] which is above
[35:35] every name
[35:37] what was that name our savior of our
[35:41] lord our king
[35:43] amen now
[35:45] think about it look at naaman
[35:48] that great syrian captain he had
[35:51] everything in life
[35:53] but what he was a leper
[35:56] you know and and for sure we know from
[35:59] the scriptures that he was a gentile
[36:01] amen and but one thing is that there was
[36:04] a woman among among his servants that
[36:06] she knew that there was a prophet
[36:08] in the land and that that he could tell
[36:11] him what to do to be to be cleansed
[36:15] and i can ask you tonight if someone
[36:18] would have the answer to your situation
[36:21] will you do what they say
[36:24] or would you question
[36:26] that instruction
[36:31] he was in a dilemma we can say because
[36:34] you know he was like
[36:36] there are other rivers
[36:38] seriously prophet
[36:40] there are other rivers there that i can
[36:42] go in in in
[36:44] immerse myself or kind of go deep myself
[36:47] in there and you're sending me to jordan
[36:51] you're sending me
[36:53] to separation
[36:55] you're sending me to to the one that is
[36:57] full of you know
[36:58] [Music]
[37:01] everything and and and it was like well
[37:04] the the young like he the maid told him
[37:06] well if the prophet is telling you what
[37:08] why why wouldn't you go
[37:11] amen
[37:14] and
[37:15] one thing that i like
[37:17] here
[37:18] is that you know his servants came near
[37:21] and spake unto him and say my father if
[37:23] the prophet that had beated to do some
[37:25] great thing would wouldn't would as thou
[37:28] not have done it how much rather than
[37:30] when he said to thee washed
[37:33] and be clean
[37:35] he needed humility
[37:37] he needed to be humble
[37:39] he needed to go he needed to repair that
[37:41] gate and say you know what
[37:43] that gate needs to be repaired and guess
[37:45] what i'm gonna go and i'm gonna dip
[37:47] myself into that jordan river and he's
[37:50] gonna do what he has to do because he
[37:51] said it the word of god just came
[37:54] he did himself seven times in jordan
[37:58] according to the saying of the man of
[37:59] god and his flesh
[38:02] look his flesh came again like unto the
[38:05] flesh of a little child and he was clean
[38:10] now look
[38:12] he received a message of transformation
[38:16] naaman when you go to the river
[38:19] your skin will be like the skin of a
[38:22] babe
[38:23] that was the way it happened
[38:26] how many name and attitude exists today
[38:29] many people not being humble enough and
[38:32] they are not seeing the lord's doing in
[38:34] this time
[38:35] it is time for us to go down to the
[38:37] jordan river and be transformed from our
[38:41] own glory to his glory
[38:44] amen this is the type of the message
[38:47] that we have received or the message
[38:49] that name and received was a message of
[38:52] restoration a message of transformation
[38:55] uh of to a new body
[38:58] because when he came out out of there
[39:00] what was he how was he looking like he
[39:02] was like a little baby
[39:04] you touched the the skin of a baby how
[39:06] does it feel it's very soft that was
[39:08] neyman's
[39:10] name nameless skin
[39:12] amen
[39:13] what was that it was from one glory to
[39:15] another glory
[39:17] he now humble yourself and he will exalt
[39:21] you and you know we have to be humble
[39:24] again i can respect repeat and repeat
[39:26] again but that's what we need today and
[39:28] then you know
[39:30] yea though i walk through the valley of
[39:32] the shadow of death i will fear no evil
[39:35] for thou art with me thy rod and thy
[39:37] staff they comfort me now these we're
[39:40] going through the valley to the through
[39:42] the times of humility and sometimes it
[39:44] it seems that we're going
[39:46] we're passing through death but guess
[39:49] what if there is a shadow is because
[39:51] there is light
[39:54] if
[39:55] it says if even if i go through the
[39:57] shadow it's because there is light
[40:00] amen and we're walking with god's hand
[40:04] by his handle or he's holding our hand
[40:06] amen
[40:08] so now he brings us to the long gate now
[40:17] what what is donggate and you know it
[40:19] says here that they repair everything
[40:21] that needed to be repaired in this
[40:23] malkai or if i can read it that way it
[40:26] means the lord is my king or the lord is
[40:29] my counselor
[40:33] and you know this is a door that was
[40:34] also provided by the lord and it was
[40:37] where they will take the dong from the
[40:39] city
[40:42] now look
[40:43] the don was not to stay there it had to
[40:46] be taken out of the city to the right
[40:48] place but there was a specific
[40:51] gate where they all the the the people
[40:54] that was living in the city they have to
[40:56] go through that specific gate to take
[40:58] out all the dong
[41:01] and then now look what what paul is
[41:04] saying here
[41:09] he says in verse seven he says but that
[41:12] what things were gained to me those i
[41:15] counted i counted laws for christ
[41:19] and not he didn't stay there yeah
[41:21] doubtless and i count all things but
[41:24] laws for the excellence excellency of
[41:26] the knowledge of christ jesus my lord
[41:28] from for whom i have suffered the loss
[41:31] of all things and to count them but
[41:34] tongue
[41:35] that i may win christ
[41:39] and be found in him not having my own
[41:42] righteousness which is of the law but
[41:45] that which is through the fate of christ
[41:48] the righteousness which is of god by
[41:50] faith so now we are seeing paul
[41:53] going through this gate now paul is
[41:56] saying everything that i had everything
[41:58] that i have learned now this is done for
[42:01] me
[42:04] what can you say for your life tonight
[42:06] everything that you have everything that
[42:08] you know
[42:09] oh you know it is great i know all
[42:12] things no
[42:13] count them as done
[42:15] for christ
[42:17] amen
[42:19] now
[42:23] what else can we say here second
[42:25] corinthians chapter 6 verse 17 and 18 it
[42:28] says wherefore come out of from among
[42:30] them and ye be separate said the lord
[42:33] and touch not the unclean thing and i
[42:35] will receive you and i will be a father
[42:38] unto you and ye shall be my sons and
[42:40] daughters said the lord almighty
[42:43] what can we say here through this gate
[42:46] any worldly thing is long before the
[42:49] lord
[42:51] the lord invites us to separate
[42:53] ourselves from the world and consecrate
[42:56] ourselves in the spirit and in body in
[42:59] our souls we have to live for him we
[43:02] have to love him we have to we have to
[43:04] love him more than your words but with
[43:07] our actions
[43:09] amen
[43:10] so we how many of us can say tonight
[43:13] sometimes we need to go and and and go
[43:15] by the dung gate but don't stay there
[43:18] just take the trash out and and then
[43:20] keep repairing everything else
[43:23] paul could say he's my pastor he he he
[43:26] could share a testimony of the life of
[43:28] christ having a fulfillment in his life
[43:31] it brought him humility and he
[43:33] considered everything as long as done to
[43:36] gain christ
[43:41] and we can say that the revival that is
[43:43] happening in our lives is taking all day
[43:45] down from our lives
[43:53] where do we go from here
[43:55] he's talking to me about salvation about
[43:57] humility
[43:59] about the old experience he's talking to
[44:02] me
[44:03] about dong
[44:04] are you going to leave us there no no
[44:06] we're not going to stay there
[44:09] you want you cannot be all your life in
[44:11] justification
[44:12] or you cannot build your life in
[44:14] sanctification you have to go you have
[44:16] to you have to keep moving in in the
[44:19] spirit of god
[44:21] now
[44:24] the fountain gate
[44:29] it was repaired by shaloon you know the
[44:31] the son of call
[44:33] jose
[44:34] the ruler of of part of mispa and what's
[44:38] the meaning of this shalom he it is the
[44:40] one that retributes and it is a man of
[44:43] prosperity
[44:45] amen
[44:46] and now look at this at
[44:48] this fountain
[44:51] fountain this fountain is a spring of
[44:53] living water
[44:55] what a precious fountain that is flowing
[44:57] for
[44:58] for all this is the gate of the holy
[45:00] spirit
[45:02] amen the gate of the holy spirit that
[45:04] needs to be repaired in our lives look
[45:06] at rebecca she had to face the water
[45:09] test
[45:10] the angel move her to so that she that
[45:13] she will go
[45:14] where the where
[45:16] the angel told her go to the well
[45:18] because it's time to go and get and draw
[45:19] the water and then the angel was at the
[45:21] same time moving with who with a loser
[45:24] to to go and meet rebecca
[45:27] he meant so eliezer's a message was that
[45:30] living water that she was longing for
[45:33] how many can say lord repair this gate
[45:36] in our lives more of you every day
[45:39] we can say i want to come to the washing
[45:43] of water by the world
[45:45] his holy spirit that cleanses that
[45:47] changes that fills you your life with
[45:50] his presence that takes away all the
[45:53] desires that are not right before his
[45:55] presence out of your life
[45:58] is that holy spirit that this is the
[46:00] gate where the holy spirit is sealing
[46:03] your life is is is he is marking you
[46:07] that you belong to someone
[46:10] that you belong to him
[46:13] how many can say lord the prophet of god
[46:15] says let the holy spirit
[46:17] search my conscience
[46:23] and then she talking about you know she
[46:26] found on she found out that there was a
[46:28] prophet daniel was among them that he
[46:31] was a dissolver of doubts
[46:33] the lord you led the holy spirit
[46:36] he is the prophet of the day
[46:38] let he come into your heart right now
[46:41] and if you examine with the word of god
[46:44] and the doubts about the message will be
[46:46] all dissolved
[46:49] why because god dissolves all doubts
[46:54] he's the holy spirit that through the
[46:56] revelation of the word can come in
[46:59] if you have questions it's good to have
[47:01] questions don't get me wrong because
[47:02] people are like no you're not supposed
[47:04] to have questions about anything yeah
[47:06] you it's good to have questions because
[47:08] when you have biblical questions there
[47:10] will always be biblical answers
[47:12] and as brother paul always says don't go
[47:14] to google or or the internet to find
[47:16] your answers go to your bible go to the
[47:19] message and find the answers that you're
[47:21] looking for because the answers are
[47:23] there are there if you have a question
[47:24] there will always be an answer
[47:27] so what is all this gate about is about
[47:29] receiving the holy spirit
[47:31] it's about you know we talk about being
[47:33] humble we talk about kind of removing
[47:36] all the trash out of our lives now what
[47:38] is next lord i want to receive your holy
[47:40] spirit and if that gate gate needs to be
[47:42] repaired tonight if i need a refilling
[47:45] of the holy spirit lord i can take it
[47:47] tonight
[47:51] and ephesians 4 30 it says in greek not
[47:54] the holy spirit
[47:56] whereby ye are sealed unto the day of
[47:59] redemption
[48:00] what is this his holy spirit
[48:03] will always bring revelation to our
[48:05] lives
[48:12] we can say this
[48:13] that the process of redemption god has
[48:16] started it before the foundation of the
[48:18] world
[48:19] he started with the ship gate where we
[48:21] spoke about the salvation and the
[48:23] sacrifice that he made for us
[48:26] then he brings us to the fish gate
[48:28] where the lord wants us to give
[48:30] testimony that he is alive
[48:33] then he bring us to the old gate
[48:35] that old religion
[48:37] that can come and change our lives
[48:40] then he brought us to the valley gate
[48:43] that demand from us humility
[48:46] and that if we kind of we humble
[48:48] ourselves he's going to exalt us
[48:51] then he brings us to the dung gate from
[48:54] where where all the worldliness must go
[48:56] by and not stay there
[48:59] he wants to take all of that from our
[49:01] lives and then now he he brought us to
[49:03] the fountain gate that that is the holy
[49:06] spirit coming and sealing our lives
[49:09] until the day of our redemption
[49:12] how many are grateful tonight and we can
[49:14] stop here how many are grateful tonight
[49:17] that lord these are not just scriptures
[49:20] that were written there it's like there
[49:22] are the treasures that we can come and
[49:24] we can we can we can read the scriptures
[49:27] and now through the revelation that we
[49:29] have received from the lord now we can
[49:31] understand that when we read the
[49:33] scriptures it has to be applied to my
[49:35] life
[49:36] because like when nehemiah had that
[49:39] desire it was representing someone that
[49:42] needed to come and that that someone
[49:45] needed those steps to take place in
[49:47] their lives
[49:48] that was me lord i needed salvation that
[49:50] was me lord i needed to have an all-time
[49:52] religion experience
[49:56] can we just buy our heads
[50:01] if the musicians can come
[50:08] let's just bow our heads and say lord
[50:10] thank you for your word
[50:12] father thank you for these scriptures
[50:14] thank you for for for these types these
[50:17] shadows lord that they were talking
[50:18] about about something and that's
[50:20] something that they were talking they
[50:22] were talking about oslore
[50:24] about how you can come and restore how
[50:26] you can come through that process lord
[50:29] through through um
[50:31] cleaning our lives lord through
[50:33] salvation or through restoration or as
[50:36] you you have promised for for this day
[50:39] lord you say that you will restore and
[50:41] that's what we're believing tonight
[50:44] father thank you for your children that
[50:46] were able to come tonight and hear your
[50:49] word lord
[50:50] thank you for this this book of nehemiah

[50:58] rebuilding that city well they they were
[51:00] rebuilding those walls those gates they
[51:03] needed that strength they were all
[51:05] distressed they were all
[51:07] under under a lot of pressure lord
[51:09] because they didn't know where to go
[51:11] father but through the anointing of
[51:13] nehemiah you sent them what they needed
[51:16] you send them the word of the king
[51:19] so they needed where to go they needed
[51:21] directions lord and you send them
[51:23] through your your servant nehemiah
[51:26] we have received the same lord the in
[51:28] this the message of these last days lord
[51:31] that now we we have the word that we we
[51:34] we are not
[51:35] we could be this in distress or we can
[51:38] we can be under a lot of pressure father
[51:40] but that's what you send your profit and
[51:42] we we have her messages like letting off
[51:44] the pressure lord
[51:46] why is the people that toss it about
[51:49] and then the other other sermons lord
[51:51] like he cares do you care lord you send
[51:54] all those messages lord to tell us
[51:57] father that they were coming from the
[51:58] king
[51:59] and that these things needed to be
[52:01] rebuilt these things need needed to be
[52:03] restored in our lives father
[52:07] we love you and give you thanks father
[52:09] thank you for your children thank you
[52:10] for this this evening that we can have
[52:12] this bible study lord and we can learn
