[0:14] lights a blaze. If that's the measure
[0:17] you must take to crush the idol.
[0:23] Sherk the pews and all the decorations
[0:26] too until the congregation's few then
[0:31] have revival.
[0:35] Tell your friends that this is where the
[0:38] party ends until you're broken for your
[0:41] sins. You can't be social.
[0:46] Then seek the Lord and wait for what he
[0:49] has in store. and know that great is
[0:52] your reward. So just be hopeful cuz you
[0:57] can
[0:59] sing all you want to. Yes, you can
[1:04] sing all you want to.
[1:09] You can sing all you want to and still
[1:13] get it wrong.
[1:16] Oh, worship is more than a song.
[1:23] [Music]
[1:31] Take a break from all the plans that you
[1:34] have made and sit at home alone and wait
[1:37] for God to whisper.
[1:42] beg him please to open up his mouth and
[1:45] speak and pray for real upon your knees
[1:49] until they blister.
[1:53] Shine the light on every corner of your
[1:56] life until the pride and lust and lies
[2:00] are in the open.
[2:04] Then read the word and put to test the
[2:06] things you've heard until your heart and
[2:09] soul are stirred in rocks and broken.
[2:13] Cuz you can
[2:16] sing all you want to. Yes, you can
[2:21] sing all you want to.
[2:26] You can sing all you want to and still
[2:30] get it wrong.
[2:33] Worship is more than a song.
[2:39] We must not worship something that's not
[2:44] even worth it.
[2:49] Leave the stage.
[2:51] Make some space for the one who deserves
[2:56] it.
[3:02] Anything I put before my God is an idol.
[3:13] And anything I want with all my heart is
[3:19] an idol.
[3:23] And anything I can't stop thinking of is
[3:29] an idol.
[3:34] And anything that I give all my love is
[3:40] an idol.
[3:44] Cuz I can sing all I want to. Yes, I can
[3:49] sing all I want to. And we can
[3:55] sing all we want to. And we can
[4:00] sing. All we want to.
[4:04] We can sing all we want and still get
[4:08] wrong.
[4:11] Worship is more than a song.
[4:17] [Music]
[4:21] Worship is more than a song.
[4:28] [Music]
[4:30] [Applause]
[4:35] Clear the stage and set the sound and
[4:38] lights ablaze. If that's the measure you
[4:41] must take to crush the idol.
[4:48] [Music]
