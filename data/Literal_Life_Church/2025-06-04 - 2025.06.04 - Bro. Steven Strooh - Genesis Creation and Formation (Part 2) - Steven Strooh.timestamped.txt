[15:35] Oh,
[15:36] I know the maker of the rain.

[17:52] sky
[17:54] among the peace my soul can be found.
[18:03] in unexpected
[18:05] storm
[18:07] made to ride me from behind.
[18:11] It may bring me low, but it will never
[18:15] bring me down.
[18:19] I'm a father.
[18:21] I know the master of the way.
[18:27] Hallelujah. Oh,
[18:30] I know the maker of the rain.
[18:37] Oh, he can calm the storms and make the
[18:42] sun shine again.
[18:47] I know the master of the way. Last time
[18:52] I know
[18:56] I know the master of the wind.
[19:03] Oh,
[19:04] I know the maker of the rain.
[19:12] And he can calm the storms and make the
[19:16] sun to shine again.
[19:21] I know the master of the wind.
[19:27] Stephen Stewart would come up and
[19:29] prepare up here and um we'll just sing
[19:32] shut in with God
[19:36] in a secret
[19:40] place.
[19:43] There
[19:45] in the spirit
[19:48] beholding
[19:50] his face. Hallelujah.
[19:56] New power
[19:58] to run in the race.
[20:04] I long
[20:06] to be shut in with God.
[20:12] Oh,
[20:14] shut in
[20:17] with God
[20:20] in a secret
[20:24] place.
[20:26] There
[20:28] in the spirit
[20:31] beholding
[20:33] his face,
[20:37] gaining
[20:39] new power
[20:41] to run in the race.
[20:47] I long
[20:49] to be
[20:52] [Music]
[21:11] back. There you go. Thank you. Genesis
[21:13] uh chapter 1 and we're
[21:17] um continuing with the Genesis study. Um
[21:21] so
[21:23] if you want to read ahead as I used to
[21:26] tell my students that they should do um
[21:30] you for the next service that brother
[21:32] Paul says there'll be another one uh
[21:34] sometime um we'll continue in Genesis
[21:37] chapter 2 and three which of course will
[21:40] be really exciting. Um but uh for today
[21:43] we're in Genesis chapter 1. Uh hold your
[21:48] place there. We have quite a bit of
[21:49] reading. So I think I'll have you take
[21:51] your seats once we've prayed. Let's
[21:52] pray. Our heavenly father, we thank you
[21:54] for this uh time of fellowship and of
[21:56] your of your word, Lord. And especially
[21:59] Lord, your anointing on your word. Do we
[22:01] need that word quickened to us, Lord?
[22:03] And it's not just a a dead letter as
[22:06] such, but Lord, it's a living word and
[22:09] it lives in us. And Lord, there's
[22:11] there's a part of uh us that calls out
[22:14] for more of your word, Lord. And it's
[22:16] your word that's in us that does that
[22:18] calling. And so, Lord, I just pray that
[22:20] each one that's listening would also
[22:22] feel that call, Lord. Feel that pull
[22:24] towards uh you and towards your word.
[22:27] And that your word would just find a
[22:29] resting place in our hearts, Lord. And
[22:32] we just pray you'd bless me tonight.
[22:33] Just give me the words and the and
[22:36] understanding that's needed, Lord, to
[22:37] share this um in a way that that meets
[22:40] people's needs for uh the knowledge of
[22:43] the word or for other needs that they
[22:46] may have. I ask it all in Jesus' name.
[22:48] Amen. You may be seated. So, you have
[22:51] your Bible. So, um I want you just to
[22:54] keep it handy because um there will be
[22:57] things that I I would hope you would
[22:59] want to underline and so forth. Um and
[23:02] so um we last time we uh we went um for
[23:09] towards um verse 19 uh which is the the
[23:13] fourth day and um um we were looking at
[23:18] this as a type
[23:21] uh uh brother Brandham calls Genesis 1 a
[23:24] type of of the believer. It's the same
[23:27] process that we go through. We start off
[23:30] in chaos and then God moves in our life
[23:35] and that chaos is dispelled slowly but
[23:38] surely step by step starting with light
[23:42] and then with sanctification separation
[23:45] and then with life and then finally the
[23:48] part that's often missed when people
[23:49] talk about this is the positioning which
[23:52] is the sun moon and stars right because
[23:55] um God never created the sun moon and
[23:58] stars on the fourth Okay. He organized
[24:01] them. He placed them. He put them into
[24:03] position. And brother Brandham says
[24:05] things like that in in a quite a few
[24:08] different places. So, as we get started,
[24:11] I also want to um remind you of
[24:14] something that we heard. I can't
[24:15] remember who was ministering now, but I
[24:18] loved was it brother Steve Bristol?
[24:21] Anyway, it was that he mentioned
[24:22] creation and formation. And it's the
[24:25] first time I'd heard somebody use that
[24:28] ex that phrase or that word formation
[24:31] because as we discussed last time um if
[24:34] somebody says the six weeks of six days
[24:37] of creation
[24:38] uh that's not in the scripture. It's not
[24:41] six days of creation. The creation was
[24:45] in verse one and then there's no
[24:49] creating done until the fifth day which
[24:53] is verse 20 which is where we're going
[24:54] to start uh tonight. So when you say six
[24:57] days of creation it's not correct and we
[25:00] read that scripture in um in Exodus to
[25:03] clarify that. So we've we've gone over
[25:06] that if you need to recap that. term the
[25:08] thank the Lord these things are
[25:10] available online and I know a lot of
[25:13] people like to go back and and review it
[25:16] and so I recommend that especially
[25:18] because um I would take the whole hour
[25:21] to try and revise what I did last time
[25:24] which I don't think that's I don't think
[25:26] that's optimal. So um let's just read
[25:30] this scripture together. Isaiah keep
[25:32] your place there in Genesis 45:18.
[25:35] This is where we ended last time. For
[25:37] thus saith the Lord that created the
[25:39] heavens, God himself that formed the
[25:43] earth and made it. He has established
[25:46] it. He created it not in vain. He formed
[25:49] it to be inhabited. Now notice
[25:53] highlighted the word formed. Uh because
[25:56] that's not the same as create. And this
[25:58] uh when whoever ministered on this and I
[26:01] can't remember, poor memory. He was
[26:03] talking about how Adam was formed from
[26:05] the dust of the ground. That Hebrew word
[26:07] is yatsa. All right. The Hebrew word for
[26:10] creator is bar. And so this is not the
[26:13] same thing. When God's forming Adam,
[26:16] he's like a sculpture. And actually, I
[26:18] read something interesting. Uh I think
[26:20] it might have been Scoffield or
[26:22] somebody. It was really interesting is
[26:24] that when God made Adam, how many of you
[26:26] pictured him u lying down on the ground
[26:30] as God's forming him? That's what I
[26:32] pictured. But of course, that's not how
[26:34] you make a a sculpture. All right. The
[26:37] sculpture is made standing up. Am I
[26:39] right? Brother does sculptures. So,
[26:41] right, you you make it standing up,
[26:43] right? It's not something that you lay
[26:45] down on the ground and you have to try
[26:47] and roll it over. That would be crazy.
[26:49] So it it's uh that God would have formed
[26:52] Adam standing up. And so there the
[26:56] picture was of Adam standing there
[26:58] rigidly like a robot,
[27:01] you know, just waiting to be turned on.
[27:05] And so when God breathed into him the
[27:07] breath of life and man became a living
[27:09] soul, he the the robot starts to make
[27:11] jerky movements. I don't know. And then
[27:13] and then Adam is suddenly alive. Well, I
[27:16] love the fact that he was standing up.
[27:18] has never never occurred to me before.
[27:21] So God made
[27:25] Adam from the dust formed him
[27:29] and that's not the same as create. So
[27:31] the only time we read of the word create
[27:34] in Genesis chapter 1 is when he creates
[27:37] everything, the universe and then he
[27:40] creates animal life and then he creates
[27:43] man. Those are the only three creative
[27:45] works that take place in Genesis chapter
[27:47] 1. And that's very important um because
[27:52] uh that means that these creative acts
[27:56] have to have some significance. And I'm
[27:59] hoping that we can get into that a bit
[28:03] tonight as I start my uh timer for all
[28:07] you nervous people out there.
[28:11] Anybody nervous about the time when I
[28:13] speak?
[28:15] If you don't know me. Um,
[28:18] so I'm trying to uh stay on track here
[28:21] tonight, but I have um quite a few
[28:23] things I'd like to share. And so let's
[28:26] see how how the Lord uh guides us. First
[28:28] of all, let's go back just to put put
[28:32] ourselves in the in the right frame of
[28:34] mind for for the subject. So verse one,
[28:37] brother Random says, "And atom busted."
[28:40] So if you are familiar with any of the
[28:43] um common theories about creation
[28:47] um the most egregious examples are AIG
[28:52] answers in Genesis and the crowd down in
[28:55] wherever it is down Kentucky Way. Um
[28:58] they don't uh they're very dismissive of
[29:01] the Big Bang.
[29:03] No such thing as the Big Bang. In actual
[29:05] fact, Brother Random says that's what
[29:07] happened. He said uh in when that event
[29:10] took place he said it was like an atom
[29:12] bursted and then between verses 1 and
[29:16] two here we have another insight
[29:17] especially from the message but of
[29:19] course many people had thought about
[29:21] this before but there's a very important
[29:23] reason why this is to important to us in
[29:26] the message and that is because uh this
[29:30] speaks of a previous a previous
[29:33] call it civilization word that brother
[29:35] Brandham used but it's something before
[29:38] what we have now. And it's very
[29:41] important for us because we know this is
[29:43] a type. And so in the type, we didn't
[29:46] start off as chaos.
[29:48] We didn't start off having to be born in
[29:51] sin, shaped in iniquity, come into the
[29:53] world speaking lies, dying, death,
[29:56] disease, famine.
[29:58] That wasn't the way it was designed.
[30:00] when the Bible says that God established
[30:03] this for habitation for us to live here
[30:07] in in in a perfect world. So that speaks
[30:11] of the condition that we had in the mind
[30:14] of God before the chaos set in. See how
[30:17] that comes in. And then from the chaos
[30:20] we have to now be uh reorganized.
[30:25] All right? our thinking, uh, our
[30:26] direction, everything has to change so
[30:29] that um, we can uh, start to uh, become
[30:33] what it was that God intended us to be,
[30:36] right? And we call that redemption, the
[30:38] plan of redemption, the great plan. So
[30:41] important in the message as we know, and
[30:43] it starts here in Genesis. Why is
[30:46] Genesis such an important book, by the
[30:48] way? You're all good students. I like
[30:50] that. All brighteyed and bushy tailed,
[30:53] especially for a Wednesday night. That's
[30:54] quite something.
[30:57] Why is Genesis so important?
[31:00] Well, comes from the word gene. And gene
[31:04] comes from the word seed or is similar
[31:06] to the word seed. And what's in a seed?
[31:10] First of all, life. But secondly, DNA.
[31:13] And we spoke about DNA some time back.
[31:16] But all the program for life for any
[31:21] living organism is already present in
[31:24] the DNA
[31:26] from the moment that DNA uh comes into
[31:30] existence. Now we have our natural DNA
[31:35] cursed that it is but we also have
[31:38] spiritual DNA. So what Genesis is doing
[31:41] is it's helping us to find our spiritual
[31:45] heritage, our spiritual genetic program
[31:49] if you like something that has been
[31:52] baked into us, built into us. We call it
[31:54] the the the seed,
[31:57] God placing his seed in us. But that
[31:59] seed, what a seed that back to DNA. So
[32:02] that part of us that responds to the
[32:06] word is what God placed in us in his
[32:10] mind from the foundation of the world.
[32:13] Very important that we understand that
[32:16] whatever it is that we have that's
[32:18] pulling us towards the word was actually
[32:22] God pulling himself towards himself. The
[32:27] deep calling to the deep. So, inside of
[32:30] God, if we can picture this, and I wish
[32:32] I had the graphic that Brother Lonnie
[32:34] made. I was trying to convert it from
[32:36] from a um uh Flash to Adobe. It's just a
[32:40] little tricky. So, I didn't get there.
[32:41] We'll get there eventually. But um to
[32:44] understand the logos and to understand
[32:46] our part in that, we have to understand
[32:49] that our DNA, spiritual DNA was in God
[32:54] to begin with. And all he's doing is
[32:57] expressing it. So every one of us when
[32:58] we say we have a portion of God's
[33:00] spirit, it's like he's pulling the
[33:03] Gideon DNA from himself and going,
[33:06] "Okay, I'm going to place this in a
[33:08] body.
[33:10] Oh, that sounds just like Adam." So the
[33:14] reason I'm saying all that is I'm trying
[33:15] to show you that when we look at
[33:17] Genesis, we have to look at it in the
[33:19] eyes of what we know about
[33:21] predestination. what we know from
[33:24] reading the rest of the Bible to see how
[33:27] it's coded here in the book of genes in
[33:32] the DNA book if you like the book that
[33:35] um has got the whole program of life and
[33:38] almost every doctrine that's important
[33:40] to us and obviously it's all important
[33:43] but you can find it in Genesis one way
[33:45] or another and if you think about how
[33:48] many uh things we we understand so well
[33:51] because of Genesis. All right. So the
[33:55] between verse one and verse two, between
[33:57] the beautiful creation in verse one and
[34:01] the the big beautiful creation in verse
[34:04] one and the gap in between,
[34:07] all right, verse one and verse two,
[34:09] brother Brandham says, now here's the
[34:11] key. up until the millions of years way
[34:14] back before this earth was ever
[34:17] inhabited by human beings and the water
[34:20] had covered the earth from some other
[34:22] civilization or something. He says the
[34:23] seeds were from some other civilization
[34:26] or something. Here's the key. It's
[34:28] before human beings. So if you say,
[34:29] well, how could there be death and
[34:31] fossils and dinosaurs before uh uh
[34:34] Genesis 1? Uh it's because um there were
[34:38] no human beings. So um sin and death uh
[34:42] as a result of sin is only um applicable
[34:46] to human beings because only human
[34:48] beings can sin. Only human beings have a
[34:50] soul. And Ezekiel says the soul that
[34:52] sins that soul shall die. So if you
[34:54] haven't got a soul, why are you dying?
[34:57] It's because the natural part of
[35:00] ecology. The plants die when the animals
[35:03] eat them and then the animals die when
[35:05] the other animals eat them and then
[35:06] eventually the top animal dies. goes
[35:09] back into the ground. All right? And the
[35:12] vegetation grows up again and the whole
[35:14] cycle continues. So you can see this has
[35:16] got nothing to do with sin. And so
[35:18] that's what brother Brandham's referring
[35:21] to when he says a previous civilization.
[35:24] He's not talking about human beings.
[35:25] He's not talking about something that
[35:26] looks like us. Um, and in fact, if you,
[35:29] you know, interested in the science of
[35:32] it, it's those oustralopaththecuses
[35:34] and and, uh, I don't know, um,
[35:37] Neanderthalss and all these weird and
[35:40] wonderful names that they come up with
[35:41] that just make them look clever because
[35:43] we can't pronounce them properly. Those
[35:47] uh, creatures were just animals. They
[35:50] were not human. They may have looked
[35:52] human. even homo erectus which was the
[35:56] the first one of the homminids to
[35:58] actually sort of stand erect uh based on
[36:01] their shape of their pelvic pelvis and
[36:04] the the way that it's built normal
[36:07] animals the pelvis is built like that
[36:09] and then homo erectus it's actually able
[36:11] to stand up but that was before homo
[36:13] sapiens which are supposed to be the
[36:15] intelligent ones that think they came
[36:18] from monkeys so
[36:21] this uh is an important principle
[36:24] because the gap explains things that you
[36:27] can't explain if you have 6 days of
[36:30] creation and 24-hour days on top of
[36:34] that. All right, so this is all the
[36:36] stuff we sort of covered last time. And
[36:38] then of course in verse three, we have
[36:40] this glorious situation where the spirit
[36:44] of God,
[36:48] so God's not leaving us to our own
[36:51] devices. He's not going, "Oh, you're in
[36:53] chaos. I'm going to go and find another
[36:55] planet that I can start, you know, with
[36:58] people that will appreciate me." He's
[37:01] like, "No, you don't appreciate me.
[37:02] You're in the gutter. You feel down and
[37:04] you feel, you know, as if you're
[37:06] worthless." Oh, that's my kind of
[37:08] people. And if you think about it,
[37:10] that's who Jesus associated with were
[37:13] those people that, you know, weren't,
[37:15] you know, so interested in their own
[37:18] abilities. In fact, he had a lot to say
[37:21] about about those people. So that's
[37:24] God's introduction is that he's going to
[37:29] hover over us. Chaotic as it may seem to
[37:32] us that life is at that time, but God's
[37:35] spirit is going to come and hover over
[37:38] us. And when he does, he says, "Let
[37:41] there be light." And so in Col
[37:44] Colossians 1 12-13,
[37:47] Paul's talking about the inheritance of
[37:49] the saints in light who has delivered us
[37:54] from the power of darkness. And now if
[37:57] you put those two words together, you
[37:59] can have a real fun time going through
[38:01] your Bible looking where light and
[38:03] darkness are put side by side. It's it's
[38:06] really tremendous because in a sense
[38:09] it's a symbol of the battle. The the
[38:12] battle is between good and bad, between
[38:16] light and darkness, between good and
[38:18] evil, if you like. And it starts right
[38:21] here in the third verse of uh of Genesis
[38:24] chapter 1. So you see how if we if we if
[38:28] we just look at this a little bit more a
[38:30] little bit more than just reading the
[38:32] Bible story, we start to see um why this
[38:35] is the seed book and why it's got so
[38:38] much in it uh that's often ignored. Now,
[38:41] the reason I'm spending some time here
[38:43] is we're going to get into Genesis
[38:45] chapter 2 and Genesis chapter 3, and
[38:48] things are going to get a little hairy
[38:50] when we consider the way most people
[38:52] think about those chapters and the way
[38:54] we think about it. Now, I'll give you
[38:56] the the the the quick version of chapter
[38:58] 2. It's a summary of vers of chapter
[39:01] one. It's got nothing to do with spirit
[39:05] man and natural man. It's got nothing to
[39:08] do with God made in the man made in the
[39:11] image of God and then man made in the
[39:13] image of animals.
[39:15] Nothing to do with that. That's crazy
[39:17] talk.
[39:18] It's just a summary of what happened in
[39:20] chapter one. And if you know anything
[39:23] about any of the popular views, um
[39:25] that's the way they that's the way they
[39:28] understand that. And it's completely
[39:30] wrong for any number of reasons, but
[39:32] especially because as we get through
[39:34] these first few verses, we start to see
[39:36] there's a tremendous amount of spiritual
[39:39] insight here.
[39:42] So then we come to the next stage if you
[39:45] like of this process in Genesis and
[39:48] that's verses 6-19.
[39:51] That's where their separation, the
[39:53] waters from the waters above, the
[39:54] firmament in between, and then the dry
[39:56] land appears. And so it's all about
[39:59] sanctification, separating. And so,
[40:01] Brother Brandham says, "The word is the
[40:04] water of separation. For God has taken
[40:05] his church and has washed it by the
[40:07] waters of separation to cleanse it for
[40:09] his own glory." And so, when we see all
[40:12] this water
[40:15] references, the waters above and the
[40:17] waters below, and the dryer land, and
[40:19] the seas, and it's all water, water,
[40:22] water, water. And why is that? Because
[40:24] that's what the word does. the washing
[40:27] of the water by the word. And you can
[40:29] see this is baked into this. I've used
[40:32] that word twice now. I'll stop using it.
[40:34] But it's baked into the text. I'm not
[40:37] making it up. It's all about water in
[40:40] that uh let's see, second day. Then the
[40:43] third day is when life comes into the
[40:46] seed. So, brother Brennham talks about
[40:48] the fact that once the environment once
[40:51] the atmosphere is made uh clear and once
[40:55] the dry land appears now the seeds from
[40:57] the previous civilization are able to be
[41:00] quickened to life and he makes that
[41:03] absolute analogy between how we were
[41:08] seeds from a previous civilization that
[41:11] given the right environment can be
[41:13] quickened to life. Praise God for that.
[41:18] And what quickens us?
[41:21] One thing that will quicken this word,
[41:24] that's the Holy Spirit. It brings life
[41:27] to the seed. Brother Random says, "And
[41:29] then in positioning, that's that fourth
[41:32] day. The Holy Spirit will move each one
[41:34] into the position that Christ the Lord
[41:37] has placed them in."
[41:40] So this is this is really critical to
[41:42] our understanding of what God is
[41:45] expecting from us. So he saves us.
[41:49] Praise God from that. Saved from what?
[41:51] Saved from hell. But that's not the
[41:53] reason he saved us. He saved us because
[41:57] he wants to place us in his kingdom.
[42:01] Place us as a crown, as a jewel in his
[42:05] crown. Place us as a star in heaven.
[42:09] place us in a position that others can
[42:11] be guided by our lives, which is what
[42:14] stars do. For centuries, millennia,
[42:18] stars were the only navigation
[42:19] instrument that anybody had. They wanted
[42:22] to know if they were going west, they
[42:24] went towards that star, east, towards
[42:26] that star. And so, you can see placing
[42:30] is not just for your good, but it's
[42:33] actually for those that are looking at
[42:35] you.
[42:37] What a critical position we're in. And
[42:41] um one time or other I might minister on
[42:43] Ezekiel chapter 3, a very scary chapter.
[42:48] And if you look up the phrase, his blood
[42:50] will be on your hands. And uh and if you
[42:54] I'll tell you what it is because we just
[42:56] in the just came to my mind. If you
[42:59] don't correct a righteous man
[43:02] who's doing something wrong, didn't get
[43:05] that quite quoted right. But if you
[43:07] don't correct the righteous man, let
[43:10] alone the sinner. He also talks about
[43:11] sinners, but he even says the righteous
[43:14] person, his blood will be on your hands.
[43:16] So what's the righteous person in our
[43:18] situation? Well, it's those that, you
[43:21] know, have some knowledge of the gospel,
[43:23] have some experience with with Christ,
[43:26] uh, but they haven't they haven't heard
[43:27] the whole story. And so, just like Paul
[43:30] Harvey, we want them to know the rest of
[43:32] the story. And and and that's what God's
[43:35] doing today. And of course, that's our
[43:37] response. Who else is going to do it?
[43:40] We're the only ones who can actually
[43:42] fulfill that role. And Ezekiel says, if
[43:44] you don't do it, that man's blood's on
[43:46] your hands.
[43:48] So, first thing he does now as we get to
[43:50] today's lesson, um, chapter 20, chapter
[43:53] 1, verse 20. And God said, this is where
[43:56] you can read in your Bibles, and you may
[43:58] want to maybe if there's something that
[44:02] catches your eye, you may want to
[44:03] highlight it. And God said, "Let the
[44:05] waters bring forth abundantly the moving
[44:07] creature that has life, i.e. fish, and
[44:11] fell that may fly above the earth and
[44:13] the open firmament of heaven."
[44:15] I'm going to stop here for a second
[44:16] because I can't spend too much time on
[44:18] all these things. We could spend an hour
[44:20] on it. Um, but the firmament was the one
[44:23] place in Genesis chapter 2, chapter one
[44:26] where on the second day where he doesn't
[44:29] say it was good. And this is going to be
[44:32] something that comes up later in our in
[44:34] next next time in our discussion of
[44:37] chapters 2 and three. But the firmament
[44:39] of heaven was a place where there were
[44:41] two types of spiritual influences.
[44:45] We know that that's the gods in in a
[44:48] spiritual dimension. And brother
[44:49] Brennham says, you know, we we we have
[44:51] that all around us. But that's also
[44:54] where the demonic activity is, the
[44:56] powers and principalities of the air.
[44:58] And so the firmament is a very critical
[45:01] place. And guess what? The birds have
[45:04] good attributes and they have bad
[45:08] attributes. And if I was in a class now,
[45:10] I'd ask you to tell me which birds in
[45:13] the Bible were considered bad that were
[45:16] just normal birds other not vultures and
[45:18] nasty ones, but it's actually in Matthew
[45:21] 13.
[45:23] And so I'll leave that. So anyway, birds
[45:26] can be good or bad. Now, I'm going to
[45:28] tell you a little bit about the good
[45:29] ones cuz that that's a little more
[45:32] edifying.
[45:33] So, the foul that may fly above the
[45:35] earth and the open firmament of heaven
[45:37] and God created great whales and every
[45:39] living creature that moves. So, now he's
[45:41] also talking about all the marine
[45:44] mammals. Whales,
[45:47] porpuses,
[45:48] dolphins, the only ones I can think of
[45:51] now. They they they um they provide milk
[45:54] to their young. They give birth to their
[45:56] young. I mean the marine mammals are
[45:58] extraordinary creatures. So God created
[46:01] great whales and every living creature
[46:03] that moves which the waters brought
[46:05] forth abundantly after their kind and
[46:08] every winged fell after his kind and God
[46:11] saw that it was good.
[46:15] So originally
[46:18] when God's creating the animal kingdom,
[46:23] it's all good.
[46:26] That's the summary. But if you look at
[46:29] the little bits I've got underlined in
[46:30] green
[46:32] or highlighted in green, it says after
[46:34] his kind.
[46:37] Now, that's going to be really
[46:38] significant when we get to chapter 3
[46:42] where suddenly this is one of the
[46:45] cardinal rules that's going to be
[46:47] broken.
[46:49] And so it's interesting that this is
[46:51] repeated over and over again as we'll
[46:54] see here in a minute. So continuing now
[46:56] in verse 22. And God blessed them saying
[46:58] be fruitful and multiply and fill the
[47:01] waters in in the seas and let foul
[47:03] multiply in the earth and evening and
[47:05] morning were the fifth day. Now it's
[47:06] interesting that he breaks it here.
[47:08] Usually the evening and morning comes at
[47:10] the end of the creation works on this
[47:12] particular case, the animal life. But
[47:14] now he splits it. He puts it in the
[47:16] middle. Anybody has an idea why that is?
[47:18] Let me know. Be glad to hear. And God
[47:21] said, "Let the earth bring forth the
[47:22] living creature after his kind, cattle
[47:24] and creeping thing and beast of the
[47:27] earth after his kind." And it was so.
[47:29] And God made the beast of the earth
[47:31] after his kind.
[47:34] That's interesting. And cattle after
[47:36] their kind, and everything that creeps
[47:38] upon the earth after his kind. And God
[47:42] saw that it was good.
[47:45] Where's the serpent?
[47:49] Would you say the serpent was good?
[47:53] Yes, obviously. Until Satan got hold of
[47:56] him, he was just a serpent. He was just,
[48:00] you know, the most subtle of all the
[48:01] beasts of the field. God's just saying
[48:04] the beasts are fine. Beasts of the earth
[48:07] as long as they bring forth after their
[48:08] kind. Right? That's the hint,
[48:12] right? So, this is good. making
[48:16] progress.
[48:18] Birds. What do we know about birds in
[48:20] scripture? Well, I got a couple of
[48:21] examples. First Kings 17:6, remember
[48:25] Elijah predicted a drought. God tells
[48:28] him, "Go and hide up in the cave or
[48:30] wherever it was." And uh ravens brought
[48:33] him bread and flesh and then he drank
[48:35] from the brook. But the problem was it
[48:37] ran out after a while and then he had to
[48:40] go to the widow's house. You remember
[48:42] that? So, but the first um provision
[48:44] that God provided for um Elijah was was
[48:48] uh birds. By the way, the next time when
[48:51] he was all depressed, angels came and
[48:53] took care of him, which is interesting.
[48:55] Matthew 12:40 is the time that we read
[48:58] about a whale. Not many times we read
[49:01] about whales in the scripture, but this
[49:03] is one of them. For as Jonas was three
[49:05] days and three nights in the whale's
[49:06] belly, so shall the son of man be three
[49:08] days and three nights in the heart of
[49:09] the earth. I'm not going to get
[49:10] distracted trying to dis trying to
[49:13] explain why this isn't 72 hours. You
[49:18] know, three days, 24 hours times three
[49:21] mathematicians in our midst here. 72
[49:23] hours. All right? And brother Rena makes
[49:26] a big deal about 72 hours that Jesus
[49:29] couldn't be in the in the in the tomb
[49:31] for 72 hours. All right? Because that's
[49:33] when corruption sets in. So this can't
[49:35] mean 72 hours. So what does it mean?
[49:38] basically just means any part of three
[49:42] days just like we say yesterday and I
[49:44] don't mean the 24-hour period prior to
[49:48] this one. It could mean that but 90% of
[49:52] the time it just means sometime
[49:55] yesterday. Don't know what else to say.
[49:57] Sometime in the past 24 hours. And so
[50:00] we'll talk about that maybe another
[50:02] time. If you have a question, let me
[50:03] know. Matthew 4:1 19. And he said unto
[50:06] them, follow me. Jesus talking to the
[50:09] fishermen and he says I'll make you
[50:10] fishes of men.
[50:13] Ah so now this Genesis
[50:16] story where he's talking about the fish
[50:19] and abundance of creatures coming out of
[50:21] the sea and to multiply and and fill the
[50:24] waters and why
[50:28] see why is the language like that? It's
[50:31] because that's our job. We're supposed
[50:34] to be multiplying the fishes
[50:37] where we live. We're the fishes, the
[50:42] fishermen of the people in our
[50:45] community, in our lives, in our
[50:47] families. That's our job. And that's
[50:51] what Jesus called the disciples for. And
[50:53] it wasn't unique to the disciples
[50:54] anymore than healing was unique to the
[50:56] disciples or deliverance or any of the
[50:58] other things that Jesus called them to.
[51:01] It's still our duty to be fishers of
[51:04] men. Unfortunately, many churches think
[51:06] it means keepers of the aquarium,
[51:09] but it's not. It's that we've got to
[51:13] make sure that we're throwing out the
[51:15] bait that we're throwing. Even the
[51:16] analogy of the first, second, and third
[51:18] pull is about fishing.
[51:21] So even in what I'm trying to say is you
[51:24] can take a a very simple understanding
[51:27] of this passage or you can look at it
[51:30] through the lens of the revealed word
[51:32] for today and we can see things uh in
[51:35] there that are like
[51:38] the love letter written between the
[51:40] lines if you like and I find it so
[51:43] inspiring and I hope you do too. So now
[51:46] this is an interesting story.
[51:49] The five loaves
[51:51] and the two fishes.
[51:54] Now I could ask any one of the children
[51:56] here, I'm pretty sure, and they know the
[51:58] story of the five loaves and the two
[52:01] fishes and how Jesus fed the multitude.
[52:03] And if they don't, I'll have to have a
[52:05] talk with brother Dan.
[52:08] But I'm sure they know it.
[52:11] But it can't just be
[52:14] a story with this much detail. That's
[52:16] just a story. And by the way, Jesus
[52:21] challenges his disciples. We'll read
[52:22] that in a minute. Did Did you understand
[52:25] about those miracles?
[52:28] And he says it wasn't about wasn't about
[52:31] the bread and the fish. Just he says,
[52:34] "I'm just letting you know it has
[52:35] nothing to do with bread and fish." And
[52:37] I'm like, "Hm, I wonder what it is
[52:39] about." So let's read this carefully.
[52:42] Matthew 14 19 and 20. And he commanded
[52:46] the multitude to sit down in the grass
[52:47] and took the five loaves and the two
[52:49] fish and looking up to heaven blessed
[52:50] and broke and gave the loaves to his
[52:53] disciples and the disciples to the
[52:55] multitude. So that's the first lesson
[52:57] the kids learn in school, Sunday school
[53:00] anyway, is that Jesus took the food, the
[53:04] word if you like, broke it out down for
[53:08] his disciples so they would understand
[53:11] it better and then they took it and fed
[53:14] the multitude.
[53:16] So that's kind of what our job is. All
[53:19] right. So we've been given this food,
[53:22] spiritual food in juice season. It's
[53:24] been beautifully broken down for us.
[53:27] What's our job? It's just to take it and
[53:30] hand it out. So, anybody who thinks that
[53:33] it's a big deal to to to share the word
[53:36] must just remember that
[53:39] it's the same job that you get at
[53:42] Starbucks.
[53:43] It's just a waiter.
[53:45] They're just bringing the food from
[53:49] somebody
[53:50] expert who prepared the food hopefully
[53:53] and they're bringing it out as carefully
[53:56] and as nicely as possible and presenting
[53:59] it in a decent way. They're not tripping
[54:01] and falling and dragging it off the
[54:02] floor and putting it back on the table.
[54:04] They're they're doing as good a job as
[54:06] they can to put the food in front of you
[54:08] in an appetizing way. How many of us
[54:11] treat sharing the gospel from a winsome
[54:15] perspective compared to the way I was
[54:18] brought up in the message, I hate to
[54:21] say, where it seemed like the only
[54:23] reason you would open your Bible would
[54:25] be to clobber somebody over the head
[54:27] with it. You serpent seed.
[54:31] I'm I'm not joking either. It's
[54:32] terrible. Oh, you don't see the prophet?
[54:35] Oh, you're a vulture.
[54:37] I mean really, you know, and I remember
[54:40] feeling uncomfortable, you know, being
[54:42] around that because it was it was so
[54:44] disrespectful. And I'm thinking that's
[54:46] not the way Jesus ministered the word to
[54:49] unbelievers.
[54:51] Now, if you claim to be a believer,
[54:54] you're in real trouble with Jesus,
[54:56] right? But for most of us, we're trying
[54:58] to be winsome. We're trying to win
[55:01] people to the to the gospel, not not
[55:04] drag them or beat them into it. Brother
[55:06] Brandham actually says that, you know,
[55:08] we shouldn't be dragging and beating
[55:09] people into the gospel. And now the next
[55:13] verse, 20. And they did all eat. How
[55:18] many were there? Well, in this case, let
[55:22] me see. There were 5,000
[55:25] men. Not the Bible says besides women
[55:27] and children. So, let's call it 20,000.
[55:31] That's quite a big congregation even by
[55:33] megaurch standards.
[55:35] and they all ate and were filled.
[55:40] So when I first approached this um
[55:44] topic,
[55:46] I was picturing Jesus,
[55:50] and I know I won't get very far if I
[55:51] keep doing this, but I was picturing him
[55:54] breaking the bread and the fish.
[55:58] It's quite an extraordinary thing to
[56:00] picture because didn't matter how many
[56:02] times he broke it, there were still
[56:03] more. And the disciples are like, I
[56:07] don't get this. And and Jesus said, did
[56:09] you understand what I did? And they go,
[56:12] actually, they probably went, but of
[56:14] course didn't understand anything. So he
[56:16] he's breaking it
[56:20] and breaking it and handing it out and
[56:23] handing it out. But because he's such a
[56:26] poor caterer,
[56:29] he decides to make more than is
[56:32] necessary. Now, if you're a caterer
[56:35] hostess like Sister Jen, you always make
[56:38] more than enough. But Jesus didn't have
[56:42] to rely on chance to know how much
[56:50] people would eat before they were full.
[56:53] He knew to the last mouthful.
[56:56] Have you ever ever tried not to have
[56:58] another cookie?
[57:00] And you you you don't resist the
[57:02] temptation and you can see the effects
[57:04] of it and and you take another cookie
[57:08] and eventually you go, "That's it. I
[57:11] couldn't eat another thing." 20,000
[57:14] people
[57:16] got to the point where they said,
[57:18] "That's it. I'm full."
[57:21] And there were still 12 baskets of
[57:25] overcated portions of the miracle left
[57:28] over.
[57:33] Actually doesn't make any sense. If
[57:35] Jesus is the creator of the universe and
[57:38] he can create all the things that we
[57:40] can't even begin to understand in in the
[57:42] in the whole universe, even in the cell,
[57:46] he would know when to stop breaking.
[57:49] And he did. He went, "Okay, that's the
[57:52] last one fed. There we go. All right,
[57:54] one basket, two baskets, three baskets."
[57:57] Gets to 12 baskets full,
[58:01] overflowing, right? Not not skimping.
[58:06] And he goes, "That's it. That's the last
[58:08] piece."
[58:11] No wonder the disciples were confused
[58:13] because are are we a little confused?
[58:15] He's like, "Don't understand why Jesus
[58:17] would do that." Then the next chapter,
[58:20] Matthew 15 verse 36-37, he took seven
[58:24] loaves and fishes and gave thanks and
[58:26] broke them and gave to his disciples and
[58:28] disciples to the multitude and they did
[58:30] all eat and were filled and they took up
[58:32] the broken meat and that was left seven
[58:35] baskets full.
[58:37] So as soon as I saw seven, my antenna
[58:40] went up.
[58:42] Okay, church ages. All right, so now
[58:45] let's back this up from the church ages.
[58:48] So what does this mean? This means that
[58:50] Jesus was going to give the food, the
[58:52] word to his disciples, the apostles.
[58:55] They were going to write it all down and
[58:57] they were going to spread it all over
[59:00] Asia Minor and Southern Europe and all
[59:03] those places.
[59:05] All right? And the word was going to be
[59:09] sufficient for that day and for the next
[59:13] seven church ages. That's good. And God
[59:16] knows exactly how much we need.
[59:20] And he's providing us spiritual food in
[59:23] due season for each age. We've got the
[59:27] Leodysian basket. And it's got just
[59:31] enough for us. It's exactly what we
[59:33] need. It's strength for the day. It's
[59:36] the word that will wash us and and keep
[59:39] us and get us ready for the rapture.
[59:44] And it was all pre-ordained.
[59:47] It was all there in the mind of God. And
[59:50] so when we read about birds
[59:54] and we read about
[59:56] fish, it's not just birds and it's not
[59:59] just fish. All right? There's more to
[1:00:02] the story. And so when Jesus uh in the
[1:00:06] next chapter, so 14 is the 5,000, 16 is
[1:00:09] the 4,000, and now we get to 16. Do you
[1:00:14] not yet understand? I can't imagine how
[1:00:17] Jesus did this. I mean, was he being
[1:00:19] snarky or was he being real
[1:00:23] um sympathetic? I don't know. It doesn't
[1:00:26] really sound like it to be honest. He
[1:00:28] says, "Do you not yet understand?
[1:00:31] Neither remember the five loaves of the
[1:00:33] 5000 and how many baskets you took up.
[1:00:38] Didn't Didn't that register to you?
[1:00:41] Don't you 12 12 tribes of Israel?
[1:00:46] So now we're getting to the picture
[1:00:47] because the seven baskets were for the
[1:00:49] Gentiles, but the 12 baskets were for
[1:00:52] the 144,000.
[1:00:57] And every one of them is in the mind of
[1:00:59] God as he's breaking those bits of food.
[1:01:04] He's thinking, "Here's the 12,000 from
[1:01:06] Judah, 12,000 from Reuben."
[1:01:09] And he's breaking that bread until it's
[1:01:12] just enough for the 144,000
[1:01:17] and for the Jews that lived at in that
[1:01:21] day because that's who the disciples
[1:01:23] were going to take the the food to. He
[1:01:25] says, ' And what about the seven loaves
[1:01:26] of the 4,000 and how many baskets you
[1:01:29] took up? How is it that you do not
[1:01:31] understand?
[1:01:33] And then he says that I I spoke it not
[1:01:36] to you concerning bread,
[1:01:39] guys. It's it's not that literal.
[1:01:42] There's deeper meaning. We're supposed
[1:01:44] to read between the lines. And he says
[1:01:46] that they should watch out for the
[1:01:48] leaven of the Pharisee and the
[1:01:50] Sadducees. What's levan? Leaven's what
[1:01:53] you put in bread that gives it uh that
[1:01:56] gives it that malice of wickedness. And
[1:01:59] so food, the spiritual food that we're
[1:02:02] supposed to eat, he's saying you've got
[1:02:04] to be careful what you eat and you got
[1:02:06] to be careful what you give to other
[1:02:08] people. But I've made provision for
[1:02:11] 144,000 and for seven church ages with
[1:02:14] no lev
[1:02:16] anyway.
[1:02:18] That's why
[1:02:20] fish, I think, are important in
[1:02:22] scripture. We read about them many
[1:02:24] times. Now, we're going to get to the
[1:02:26] creation. Let me see.
[1:02:29] All right. And I won't tell you how many
[1:02:31] minutes are left. So, verse 26 now, and
[1:02:35] back to your Genesis, if you're holding
[1:02:37] your place there. Let us make man in our
[1:02:38] image after our likeness. And let them
[1:02:40] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[1:02:42] and the fowl of the air, and the cattle,
[1:02:44] and over all the earth, and over every
[1:02:47] creeping thing that creeps upon the
[1:02:49] earth. So God created man in his own
[1:02:51] image, and the image of God created he
[1:02:53] him, male and female created he them.
[1:02:57] And God blessed them. And God said to
[1:02:59] them, "Be fruitful and multiply and
[1:03:00] replenish the earth and subdue it and
[1:03:02] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:03:04] and the fowl of the air and over every
[1:03:06] living thing that moves upon the earth."
[1:03:10] You see, when we get to chapter three,
[1:03:15] we see where the where the error
[1:03:18] happened, where that dominion, remember
[1:03:21] he's talking to Adam and Eve. Remember
[1:03:25] their name was Adam. Revel Genesis
[1:03:27] chapter 5 and God called their name
[1:03:30] Adam. This is still in the spiritual.
[1:03:32] This is Adam and Eve in the spiritual uh
[1:03:35] as brother Ren calls supernatural form
[1:03:38] and he's saying you have dominion.
[1:03:42] You don't have to submit to the ws of
[1:03:44] the enemy. You don't have to give into
[1:03:47] the beast theology because you have
[1:03:50] dominion. And as far as the fowls of the
[1:03:53] air are concerned, those are the fowls
[1:03:55] from Matthew 13. You can look that up
[1:03:57] and let me know what you find. Um, they
[1:04:00] roosted in the in the branches of the
[1:04:02] trees, picked up the seed that fell on
[1:04:05] hard ground. Bad, bad creatures, right?
[1:04:09] Eating the seed, taking it away from the
[1:04:11] believer. But you've got dominion over
[1:04:14] that. That's what he's telling us. So in
[1:04:16] the spiritual realm as we are going back
[1:04:19] to our Adam and Eve condition,
[1:04:23] we're supposed to be taking back that
[1:04:26] authority
[1:04:28] and saying you don't have the authority.
[1:04:31] You roaring lion that brother Paul
[1:04:33] talked about on Sunday. It we don't have
[1:04:36] to submit to that. Doesn't scare us.
[1:04:38] Death, where is your sting? Grave, where
[1:04:40] is your victory?
[1:04:42] So it's like a big bee and come
[1:04:47] stinger of death. Only trouble is his
[1:04:50] stinger was pulled at Calvary. That was
[1:04:52] what took the devil by surprise. If they
[1:04:56] had known they'd never have crucified
[1:04:57] the Lord of glory cuz he looked so done,
[1:05:01] just so vulnerable, so absolutely weak,
[1:05:06] and he's hanging there in shreds if
[1:05:09] you've seen the Passion movie.
[1:05:12] And the devil goes, "It's not him, guys.
[1:05:16] We've been fooled. It's not him. But
[1:05:18] now, now we've got him."
[1:05:21] And so, here comes the stinger of death.
[1:05:27] And that battle
[1:05:29] between life and death,
[1:05:32] between Satan
[1:05:34] and Jesus,
[1:05:36] the whole earth shook as something got
[1:05:40] hold of that stinger inside Jesus and
[1:05:42] wouldn't let it go until he had pulled
[1:05:45] the stinger. And what do we know about a
[1:05:47] bee without a stinger?
[1:05:51] He might buzz for a few seconds, but
[1:05:53] he's done. And that's the devil.
[1:05:57] Jesus pulled the stinger of death. He's
[1:06:00] done,
[1:06:01] but he can still buzz. Now, I want to
[1:06:03] tell you something. I've had bees and
[1:06:05] wasps and stuff come at me, and if
[1:06:07] you're like me, I'm like, whoa.
[1:06:10] I'm not looking. Hold on a second. Bee,
[1:06:13] have you got a stinger?
[1:06:16] I'm happy with the the wings buzzing and
[1:06:18] the flying around in erratic fashion to
[1:06:20] put me off. I'm I'm gone inside. And
[1:06:23] maybe he didn't have a stinger, but I'm
[1:06:24] not waiting to find out.
[1:06:27] So, here's the thing. We get scared
[1:06:32] because the devil's tactics haven't
[1:06:35] changed. He still acts like he has a
[1:06:37] stinger.
[1:06:38] And so, in in uh in um in the the
[1:06:43] picture of Sagittarius or or the or the
[1:06:46] the the Antichrist, the first rod of the
[1:06:48] Antichrist, he has a bow but no arrows.
[1:06:50] But I want to do this for you. The guys
[1:06:53] do archery and I love that because if
[1:06:55] you pull a big long bow and I pointed
[1:06:57] right at poor brother Brandon over
[1:06:59] there, all right, and he sees a 6', 10t,
[1:07:02] 8ft, whatever those long bows were and
[1:07:05] he's 150 yards away. He's not like,
[1:07:08] "Hold on a minute. I want to see if
[1:07:09] you've got an arrow."
[1:07:13] Like, no, I'm not waiting around to see
[1:07:15] if he's got an arrow or not. It's enough
[1:07:17] that he did this and I'm gone. But we do
[1:07:21] not have to do that because we know
[1:07:23] there's no arrow. We know there's no
[1:07:25] stinger. We know there's no death that
[1:07:29] we can't come back from.
[1:07:32] Isn't that amazing? So, praise God for
[1:07:34] that. Where were we? The fowl of the
[1:07:36] air. And every living thing that moves
[1:07:37] upon the earth, we have dominion over.
[1:07:40] And God said, "Behold, I've given you
[1:07:42] every herbbearing seed and which is upon
[1:07:44] the face of all the earth. And every
[1:07:45] tree
[1:07:47] in which is the fruit of a tree yielding
[1:07:49] seed to you it shall be for meat.
[1:07:52] Do you see an except
[1:07:56] do you see? But of the tree of the
[1:07:58] knowledge of good and evil. Not there.
[1:08:02] There were no bad trees.
[1:08:06] And we know that because he ends it by
[1:08:09] saying it was very good.
[1:08:12] So to every beast of the earth,
[1:08:15] including Mr. Serpent and Mrs. Serpent,
[1:08:18] and to every fowl of the air, and to
[1:08:20] everything that creeps upon the earth,
[1:08:22] wherein there is life, I have given
[1:08:24] every green herb for meat, and it was
[1:08:26] so. So there was provision for those
[1:08:29] animals. God wasn't holding back from
[1:08:31] them because he thought one of them was
[1:08:33] going to be bad. And God saw everything
[1:08:35] that he had made, and behold, it was
[1:08:37] very good. and the evening and the
[1:08:39] morning were the sixth day.
[1:08:45] So what does it mean when he says let us
[1:08:49] this is really what I want to talk about
[1:08:51] this evening. So we'll see how fast I
[1:08:53] can go.
[1:08:55] So
[1:08:57] by the benoms referring to the scripture
[1:09:00] u I think it might be questions and
[1:09:01] answer in Genesis. He talks about this
[1:09:03] quite a bit. Um anyway, and he says it's
[1:09:06] like John 4:24
[1:09:08] that God is a single spirit. He says not
[1:09:12] a trinity of spirits. And of course, if
[1:09:15] God's a spirit and he's going to make
[1:09:18] something in his image, what's he going
[1:09:19] to make? Spirit. And that's where we get
[1:09:22] the idea that that first creation was a
[1:09:24] spiritual creation. It was the spirit of
[1:09:28] mankind that was being created because
[1:09:31] it was made in God's image. Now, brother
[1:09:33] Brandon gives us further insight into
[1:09:34] that which I'll get to later. And here
[1:09:37] was God unfolding himself now down. So,
[1:09:41] we've been talking about dimensions in
[1:09:42] the adult Bible study which fortunately
[1:09:45] for most people we finished now. And u I
[1:09:48] think it was getting a bit tiresome
[1:09:50] anyway. But he said he unfolded himself
[1:09:53] down. So from his dimension, which we
[1:09:56] think of as the seventh dimension, he's
[1:09:59] unfolding himself down
[1:10:02] and he's making himself, we'll see what
[1:10:04] brother Brandham says about this in a
[1:10:06] minute. It's beautiful. He's
[1:10:11] I don't want to give it away. So he's
[1:10:13] he's he's he's unfolding himself down
[1:10:18] which which I love into let us make man
[1:10:22] which was his son an offspring from him
[1:10:27] a man in our own image our own image.
[1:10:31] So, what's so significant about this?
[1:10:33] What's so incredible is that if you're
[1:10:36] on the oneness side of the fence, you're
[1:10:38] going, "Well, it's one God and he made
[1:10:41] one man and that's the end of the
[1:10:44] story." But in actual fact, when he made
[1:10:46] one man, he made them.
[1:10:50] So then he says he was a supernatural
[1:10:54] being this first Adam and let him have
[1:10:58] dominion over the cattle of the field
[1:11:00] and so forth. So in the spiritual realm,
[1:11:05] Adam's given full control.
[1:11:07] It's all yours and you can do with it as
[1:11:10] you please. You have total dominion. You
[1:11:13] can eat anything you like. Nothing's
[1:11:15] restricted. Nothing's held back.
[1:11:19] in the Hebrews. Uh this is the part that
[1:11:21] I wanted to get to. And now in the
[1:11:23] Hebrews series, and now the logos that
[1:11:27] went out of God, this is where I wanted
[1:11:28] to show you the animation.
[1:11:31] All this begins to form into a body
[1:11:34] shape.
[1:11:36] Now, if you go to Ezekiel and you see
[1:11:39] the one sitting on the throne that had
[1:11:41] the likeness of a man and when Moses
[1:11:45] sees the back parts of a man, God's
[1:11:48] favorite way to show himself is in the
[1:11:51] form that of human. Why is that? It's
[1:11:55] because a whatever the percentage part
[1:11:58] of the eternal spirit of God is not just
[1:12:02] deity, it's also humanity. We had to
[1:12:06] have our part in that eternal spirit to
[1:12:10] be part of him at the end. And Jesus
[1:12:11] said, "I pray that you would you' be
[1:12:13] with one as the father and I are one."
[1:12:17] So you see how this is now tying
[1:12:19] together with Genesis when he's talking
[1:12:21] about making us in his image. He's not
[1:12:24] just talking about the attributes of
[1:12:27] God, which is where most churches will
[1:12:30] will agree with that of God, his love,
[1:12:33] his nature, and his ability. All right?
[1:12:36] That those are the attributes of God
[1:12:38] that are baked into there. I go that uh
[1:12:43] integrated into uh our human experience.
[1:12:46] So we are creative, we can think, we can
[1:12:49] reason. All the things that we associate
[1:12:52] with God.
[1:12:56] But he says now he begins to form it
[1:12:58] into a body shape.
[1:13:01] And this body shape was called in the
[1:13:03] scholars teaching logos. The logos that
[1:13:06] went out of God. In other words, and he
[1:13:09] says a better word for it is what we
[1:13:11] call a theophony. Theophony is a human
[1:13:13] body that's glorified.
[1:13:16] Not exactly with flesh and blood like it
[1:13:19] will be in its glorified stage like
[1:13:20] Jesus had. Notice the difference.
[1:13:24] I never noticed this before.
[1:13:27] I didn't notice that
[1:13:30] it wasn't in the same
[1:13:34] condition that theophony as what we
[1:13:36] associate with a glorified body. It was
[1:13:39] prior to that.
[1:13:42] And we say well eat and drink. Except
[1:13:44] brother Ram says, "But it's a form of a
[1:13:46] human body that doesn't eat nor does it
[1:13:49] drink, but it's a body, a body that's
[1:13:52] waiting for us as soon as we leave this
[1:13:53] one." And that's the kind of body that
[1:13:55] God was. For he said, "Let us make man
[1:13:58] in our image, in our own image, in our
[1:14:00] likeness." So now we know that God has a
[1:14:05] form that's down from his invisible
[1:14:08] spirit, right? That's that's the top
[1:14:13] dimension seven. But coming down from
[1:14:15] that, he's put that logos that came out
[1:14:20] from him, that expression of everything,
[1:14:23] his plan, everything that he wanted to
[1:14:25] do, everything that was in his mind, he
[1:14:26] expressed it in this word and that word
[1:14:30] took a form. So when Jesus came and he
[1:14:34] was the word made flesh, no problem cuz
[1:14:38] it it fit. That spirit that went into
[1:14:42] Jesus at his um conception was the same
[1:14:46] shape.
[1:14:52] I'm amazed by these things. Romans
[1:14:54] chapter 1 20. Now what is what are we
[1:14:57] doing here? When you see the word things
[1:15:00] in this passage, if you look in other
[1:15:01] translations, they say attributes. And I
[1:15:03] like that attributes. Sure, attributes
[1:15:06] are things. There's nothing wrong with
[1:15:08] the translation. Just it's a nicer word.
[1:15:10] For the invisible things or attributes
[1:15:12] of him from the creation of the world.
[1:15:15] So why do we studying Genesis? We're
[1:15:17] going to spend three services on
[1:15:18] Genesis, just the first three chapters,
[1:15:21] because it's everything.
[1:15:25] It's the seed book. For the invisible
[1:15:27] things of him from the creation of the
[1:15:29] world are clearly seen being understood
[1:15:31] by the things that are made even his
[1:15:34] eternal power in godheaded so that they
[1:15:36] are without excuse. So when we think of
[1:15:38] the godhead and the logos and the form
[1:15:40] of the word that Jesus took and Adam's
[1:15:43] form and how that's our theophony that
[1:15:45] we go back to and wow
[1:15:48] it's all there
[1:15:51] all beautifully explained in Genesis
[1:15:53] chapter 1 and obviously it takes brother
[1:15:56] Brennham to kind of highlight that for
[1:15:58] us
[1:16:00] and then you might have read where um
[1:16:05] brother Brennan explains that um when
[1:16:07] that logos came out from God, he said,
[1:16:10] "I I pictured us looking over the
[1:16:12] balcony, over the bot, what do you say,
[1:16:15] barricade over the balcony, watching the
[1:16:18] creation taking place, and the logos is
[1:16:22] playing like a little child at the
[1:16:24] father's feet."
[1:16:27] That takes a little bit of getting used
[1:16:28] to, but there's something very
[1:16:32] scriptural about that in Proverbs 8:30.
[1:16:35] Then I was by him. This is wisdom
[1:16:39] speaking by the way. So wisdom is just
[1:16:41] another form if you like of logos. This
[1:16:45] is logos is is truth and knowledge uh
[1:16:48] with the thought behind it. You know all
[1:16:50] of those concepts and logos wisdom is
[1:16:53] very similar. So when Solomon's writing
[1:16:55] about wisdom he's personifying wisdom
[1:16:58] except I think he personifies her as a
[1:17:00] woman which I find interesting. Then I
[1:17:03] was by him as one brought up with him.
[1:17:06] It's like a son playing at the feet of
[1:17:08] the father. And I was daily his delight,
[1:17:12] rejoicing always before him.
[1:17:16] So if that can be said about wisdom, it
[1:17:19] can certainly be said about Logos. It
[1:17:21] would be no stretch to do that. Now
[1:17:24] we're going to finish up. Gosh, I'm
[1:17:26] doing well. Praise God. According to
[1:17:29] that, it's 8:19.
[1:17:33] That sounds good. All right, Ez. So,
[1:17:35] that makes everybody relax, get home on
[1:17:37] time. Ezra 4 11 and 18. What can let us
[1:17:42] mean? Well, I'm going to give you a list
[1:17:44] at the end of the different ways in
[1:17:47] which the Bible could use this uh
[1:17:50] concept of us.
[1:17:52] But this is my favorite.
[1:17:54] So God
[1:17:57] who is a spirit
[1:17:59] is going to create man and he says let
[1:18:02] us
[1:18:04] one spirit create man
[1:18:07] in our image.
[1:18:10] So this is the copy of the letter that
[1:18:12] they sent unto him artiseries.
[1:18:16] The letter which you sent unto us has
[1:18:19] been pray plainly read before me. So if
[1:18:24] you look in the Scoffield or in um the
[1:18:27] sonino edition of Jewish commentary
[1:18:30] about uh chapter one in revelation,
[1:18:33] you'll read they use the term ma the the
[1:18:36] plural of majesty or the majestic
[1:18:39] plural. And if you have any interest in
[1:18:42] British royalty,
[1:18:45] Queen Victoria was famous for saying we
[1:18:47] are not amused.
[1:18:50] And of course it was just her, but she
[1:18:53] represented the kingdom.
[1:18:58] And Arty Xerxes represents the kingdom.
[1:19:01] So the letter that you wrote to that was
[1:19:03] written written to him and he says that
[1:19:06] was read before us, before me, he's
[1:19:10] mixing up the pronouns. He'd be very
[1:19:12] famous today.
[1:19:17] But he's showing that it's more than
[1:19:20] just the person. It's the office that he
[1:19:24] holds.
[1:19:25] And that's how God was treating the
[1:19:29] creation of humanity, creation of
[1:19:32] mankind. We think of it as he made man,
[1:19:35] one man. No, that doesn't make sense. He
[1:19:38] didn't make one man. He made a spirit of
[1:19:41] mankind.
[1:19:43] that he took that spirit of mankind, put
[1:19:46] it into the form of Adam, and it
[1:19:49] multiplied from there. All right,
[1:19:53] we're going to finish up now. So, these
[1:19:55] are all the verses that refer to us. Of
[1:20:00] course,
[1:20:02] when God was creating, all the morning
[1:20:04] stars sang together and all the sons of
[1:20:05] God shouted for joy. There's a whole big
[1:20:07] group of people. And then in Genesis
[1:20:09] chapter 11, I love this after the flood
[1:20:12] and with the uh tower of Babel, he said,
[1:20:15] "Let us go down there and confound their
[1:20:17] language." And the next verse says, "And
[1:20:19] the Lord
[1:20:21] went down."
[1:20:22] So us doesn't always mean us.
[1:20:26] So the plural people have something.
[1:20:29] Anyway, 2 Corinthians 18:18, "The Lord
[1:20:32] sits upon his throne and all the host of
[1:20:35] heaven to his left and to his right."
[1:20:37] The Bible says,
[1:20:40] was he talking to all of them? I'm not
[1:20:42] so sure. I don't know. There may be
[1:20:43] something in it. I don't remember if
[1:20:45] Brother Rena mentions this, but you
[1:20:46] know, the rest of the host in heaven
[1:20:48] were angels.
[1:20:50] So, you know, I think we're a bit
[1:20:52] different. Isaiah 6:8, the voice of the
[1:20:55] Lord saying, "Whom shall I send and who
[1:20:58] will go for us?"
[1:21:01] That's so interesting. Mixing them up,
[1:21:04] right? It's obviously one person
[1:21:06] talking, but he uses the plural. And
[1:21:08] then, of course, we we mentioned uh
[1:21:10] Proverbs 8:30. So, we're going to finish
[1:21:12] up tonight with 6 minutes to go. Nailed
[1:21:15] it. All right, here's the summary.
[1:21:19] Things to take note of that will help
[1:21:21] our understanding in the next two
[1:21:23] chapters.
[1:21:25] What did you notice? Everything's good.
[1:21:29] Very good. When you get to the end,
[1:21:32] the animal kingdom are all told to
[1:21:34] multiply
[1:21:36] with their own kind.
[1:21:40] Human beings that are made in the image
[1:21:42] of God are actually made in the image of
[1:21:45] his supernatural form.
[1:21:49] And then the supernatural Adam was given
[1:21:53] complete dominion over the earth. Not
[1:21:56] just the animals and all that, but the
[1:21:58] Bible says over the whole earth.
[1:22:01] And he was commanded to multiply and
[1:22:04] replenish.
[1:22:05] And he had no restrictions regarding
[1:22:08] apples or whatever fruit.
[1:22:13] Everything was very good.
[1:22:16] So what happened?
[1:22:20] If everything was very good,
[1:22:24] how did who was it? Brother Paul talking
[1:22:27] about the devil sneaking in. I know. So,
[1:22:29] somebody else, but you know, we've got
[1:22:31] this picture of the, you know,
[1:22:32] especially in children's books of
[1:22:34] slippery serpent. Slippery serpent uh
[1:22:39] slithering under the wall to get into
[1:22:43] Eden.
[1:22:47] But it wasn't like that.
[1:22:50] He just walked in through the open door.
[1:22:53] So once he had taken over the serp the
[1:22:57] serpent, Satan was able to deceive Eve
[1:23:02] and that opened the door to sin and to
[1:23:05] death. He didn't have to sneak around to
[1:23:09] do it. He came out boldly in front of
[1:23:12] Eve. Yay, hath God said?
[1:23:16] and she was
[1:23:18] completely taken in.
[1:23:23] And so could we be except by God's grace
[1:23:28] cuz that's exactly what's happening in
[1:23:30] the world in the church world.
[1:23:33] But at this stage everything's very good
[1:23:37] except
[1:23:40] until it wasn't.
[1:23:43] And the Lord God said, "It's not good
[1:23:47] that man should be alone."
[1:23:50] Musicians, you can start making your way
[1:23:52] forward.
[1:23:55] It's not good that man should be alone.
[1:23:59] But unfortunately, it's that
[1:24:03] that actually became an issue later on.
[1:24:07] And so if you'll stay tuned for our next
[1:24:10] enthralling episode, we'll continue with
[1:24:12] the study next time and I hope to go a
[1:24:15] little bit faster. But Genesis 1 is so
[1:24:18] rich. I really didn't feel I was going
[1:24:21] to do chapter 2 as well, but I just
[1:24:22] didn't feel to do it. This is so
[1:24:25] important to us that we understand how
[1:24:28] this relates to us personally. And I
[1:24:31] really appreciate your attention. Let's
[1:24:34] stand
[1:24:36] and we can bow. It's our heavenly
[1:24:38] father, we so in awe of your word. We're
[1:24:42] so in awe of you and your creation,
[1:24:44] Lord, and everything that you everything
[1:24:47] that you do, Lord. You do it well. And
[1:24:50] Lord, we don't always understand your
[1:24:52] ways and higher than our ways and beyond
[1:24:55] our understanding sometimes. And we
[1:24:57] certainly can identify with the
[1:24:59] disciples and they say, "We we just
[1:25:01] don't get it.
[1:25:03] But Lord, we know that at the end of the
[1:25:05] day, where could we go?
[1:25:08] And Lord, it's to your word that we turn
[1:25:11] and it's to your word that we we bow in
[1:25:15] humbleness and humility, Lord, as we
[1:25:18] realize that you have your ways of doing
[1:25:21] things, Lord. And it's it you don't
[1:25:24] asking for our advice on how to do
[1:25:26] anything as you showed in Genesis, Lord.
[1:25:29] You've got it all under control.
[1:25:31] You made it just the way you wanted it
[1:25:34] to be. And so, Father, as we take your
[1:25:38] word into our hearts, Lord, and we start
[1:25:39] to think about how it applies to us and
[1:25:43] how we can be washed by the waters of
[1:25:46] your word, how can we let the light of
[1:25:48] your spirit shine in our hearts, how we
[1:25:51] can shed the love of Jesus abroad,
[1:25:55] how we can be
[1:25:58] your witnesses, Lord. how we can Lord be
[1:26:02] instruments in your kingdom placed and
[1:26:05] positioned for a purpose. We ask Lord
[1:26:09] that you would help quicken that to us
[1:26:12] in our lives and Lord make us the people
[1:26:16] that you want us to be. We ask it all in
[1:26:19] Jesus name. Amen.
[1:26:24] [Music]
