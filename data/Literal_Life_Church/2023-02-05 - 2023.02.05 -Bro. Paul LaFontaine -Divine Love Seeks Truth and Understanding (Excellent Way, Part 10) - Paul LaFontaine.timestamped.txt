[0:00] chapter 3 if you don't mind joining me
[0:02] in that and
[0:04] my wife and I will be away and my
[0:07] granddaughter and son-in-law will be
[0:08] away a few days vacation brother Boaz
[0:11] will Minister next Sunday for us and
[0:13] some other help here as well so we look
[0:16] forward to hearing in we always try to
[0:18] listen into the services even when we're
[0:19] away so we'll be away a few days in
[0:22] Florida and I was going down to see
[0:24] sister Andy and she's up here now so
[0:27] but we're excited about being able to
[0:30] get away a few days after today leaving
[0:32] in the morning amen we're going to read
[0:34] from Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 16.
[0:39] Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 16.
[0:46] that he would Grant you according to the
[0:49] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[0:52] with might by his spirit
[0:55] where in the Inner Man
[0:57] strengthened by his spirit in the Inner
[1:00] Man we know we have an outer man we know
[1:03] we have this flesh but where we need to
[1:06] be strengthened is in the Inner Man
[1:08] and we actually need to be living every
[1:11] day from the inner man we need to be
[1:14] operating from the inner man how many
[1:16] would like to live that way
[1:18] so his theme is the inner man then he
[1:21] says that Christ May dwell in your
[1:23] hearts by faith that ye being rooted and
[1:27] grounded in love rooted how many wants
[1:30] to be rooted and grounded in love
[1:33] amen that's a good motive that's a good
[1:35] source where everything is is happening
[1:38] and your reactions to everything it's
[1:39] the Divine Capstone love of God that's
[1:42] what's rooted that's what that's at the
[1:44] roots of who you are in the inner man
[1:46] that you may be able to comprehend I
[1:49] want you to notice that word comprehend
[1:50] because that's that's understanding
[1:52] that's understanding of things that you
[1:54] may be able to understand with All
[1:56] Saints what is the breath and length and
[2:00] depth and height of what to know the
[2:03] love of Christ which passeth knowledge
[2:05] that ye might be filled with all the
[2:08] fullness of god notice verse 19 is what
[2:11] I've been preaching on a little bit and
[2:13] that the love of God Divine love that
[2:15] which is within us will pass knowledge
[2:18] in other words you can't let your
[2:20] thoughts interrupt what the love of God
[2:21] wants to do how many remember that from
[2:23] last Sunday I think I preached on when
[2:25] When Love is motivating you and it
[2:28] begins to move in your heart and it's
[2:29] divine love go with it
[2:31] what interrupts it our own thinking
[2:34] this proves that by scripture when he
[2:36] says to know the love of Christ which
[2:37] passeth knowledge the love of God can go
[2:40] Way Beyond what your mind can do
[2:43] it's more powerful than your mind can
[2:45] you say Amen it passes all knowledge
[2:48] we're so uh bent in this generation to
[2:51] use our minds and all these other things
[2:52] and and God gave us a mind but you see
[2:55] when it interrupts the love of God and
[2:56] the leading of the Holy Spirit that's
[2:58] when we're in trouble
[2:59] so this love passeth knowledge that ye
[3:03] might be filled with all the fullness of
[3:05] God how many you want to be filled with
[3:06] the fullness of God now unto him that is
[3:09] able to do exceedingly abundantly above
[3:13] all that we could ask or here we are
[3:16] again
[3:17] think
[3:18] this love can go beyond what you could
[3:21] even think about doing
[3:23] okay that's why we need to liver that
[3:25] you'll be able to unto him that is able
[3:27] to do exceedingly abundantly above all
[3:30] that we ask or think according to the
[3:34] power that worketh where it's working in
[3:37] US amen father bless your word and we
[3:40] pray you anointed Lord that I could say
[3:42] the things in the spirit of Christ and
[3:44] the motive of Christ that Lord something
[3:46] could be done of Eternal benefit today
[3:48] that you would put a Revive on our heart
[3:51] if someone needs salvation today I pray
[3:53] you'll lead him to Salvation if someone
[3:55] needs the holy spirit in their life
[3:57] today I pray that you would lead them to
[3:59] that Holy Ghost experience God you we we
[4:02] know that Jesus you said you must to
[4:05] Nicodemus you must be born again May
[4:08] every person know they must be born
[4:09] again to see and understand the kingdom
[4:12] of God bring an atmosphere for New Birth
[4:14] today and I pray you also teach the
[4:16] saints of God who've been traveling and
[4:18] sojourning in this faith for many years
[4:20] teach us as well how to live a more
[4:23] Victor serious life and will commit it
[4:25] to you father in Jesus name amen God
[4:27] bless you may be seated
[4:30] there are some key elements
[4:34] um that I want you to grab in your
[4:37] hearts now out of this text and also
[4:40] quickly a couple others and I'll just
[4:42] pull them out here as we read through
[4:43] them the theme out of the four or five
[4:46] verses that I read is that we live from
[4:48] the inner man the inner man be
[4:50] strengthened so you have the inner man
[4:51] you had your life rooted and grounded in
[4:54] love and may we may be able to
[4:56] comprehend which is understanding you
[4:58] have the theme of understanding and then
[5:01] we have the love of Christ that passes
[5:03] knowledge and can do above whatever we
[5:06] ask or think so there are some elements
[5:08] key elements in that scripture that I'm
[5:11] going to pull out in some other
[5:12] scriptures and I want to speak as a
[5:14] theme this morning this is my subject
[5:16] Divine love seeks out truth and
[5:19] understanding Divine love seeks truth
[5:22] and understanding I want to delve into
[5:25] that and speak about it because a lot of
[5:27] times our mind and we're thinking only
[5:29] with our minds without the love of
[5:31] Christ without the Holy Ghost our minds
[5:34] will come to a certain place there
[5:35] because they're limited that they will
[5:39] stop at certain points and it'll only
[5:41] goes so far but Divine love is always
[5:45] seeking for more truth and seeking for a
[5:48] greater understanding of every situation
[5:52] first of all it seeks a greater
[5:55] understanding of God
[5:56] if you're understanding in Revelation of
[5:59] God is limited then that's going to
[6:01] eventually bring trouble so we should
[6:03] always be saying Lord increase my
[6:05] Revelation and understanding of you I
[6:07] want to understand God how many rub
[6:09] shoulders with people that they're
[6:10] living the way they're living today
[6:12] because they don't understand God
[6:14] I mentioned Wednesday night somebody who
[6:16] I was just sharing a little bit with and
[6:18] mostly listening to in the Valvoline
[6:20] Instant Oil he was an atheist he grew up
[6:22] Baptist in the South he was an atheist
[6:24] and he just unloaded on me in the only
[6:26] 10 minutes I was there he unloaded his
[6:28] life bitter had a satanic sign on his
[6:31] thing is attacked on his hand as a
[6:32] tattoo he was just very just wanting to
[6:35] prove to his parents and the whole world
[6:37] very bitter about his conservative
[6:39] upbringing and some of it was in balance
[6:41] and I could hear that and he shared his
[6:43] heart shared his heart and it was going
[6:45] on and on but I wanted to listen to him
[6:47] because I wanted to make sure because I
[6:49] had a moment where I said now now Paul
[6:51] you've been preaching on this Divine
[6:53] love you've been been preaching on let
[6:55] it let it rule situations and I could
[6:58] have jumped in and given a bunch of
[7:00] scriptures because I know them and
[7:02] corrected this guy and jumped in and
[7:05] told him you need to do this and you
[7:06] need to do that I could have done it and
[7:08] I would have been right scripturally but
[7:10] yet I didn't have a full understanding
[7:12] of where he was coming yet from
[7:15] and so my Divine love I said okay this
[7:17] is that moment you better live What You
[7:19] Preach so I settled back and I just
[7:21] listened to this guy and I and I've said
[7:23] the words because when he got into that
[7:25] he was a sexually abused as a young boy
[7:28] and the church didn't deal with it
[7:30] number one they didn't deal with his
[7:31] uncles doing it they covered it up they
[7:33] wanted everybody to look holy to
[7:34] everybody and they wanted him to look
[7:36] holy and so that was the emphasis they
[7:38] didn't care about dealing with and so I
[7:39] said I just said the word you know what
[7:41] I understand where you're at that was
[7:43] pitiful I said it's too bad that the
[7:46] church the church sometimes taints your
[7:49] vision of God because God is something
[7:52] separate than what you've seen in the
[7:54] church
[7:55] and that's all I said it's basically all
[7:57] I said because the rest of the time he
[7:58] was unloading I don't know why he was
[8:00] unloading on me I didn't tell him this
[8:01] was a church vehicle so maybe you
[8:02] thought it's a church I'm going to give
[8:04] it to this pastor
[8:06] but you know what I listened to the
[8:07] young man I listened to him and I'm I
[8:09] said I'm gonna I'm gonna pray for you
[8:11] and I'm gonna and I'm gonna continue to
[8:13] pray for this man I have to go in there
[8:14] every month for my oil change or every
[8:16] three months I hope I can talk to him
[8:17] again and give a little bit more but
[8:19] here it is divine love seeks the truth
[8:22] and seeks to understand
[8:27] but our minds jump quickly to
[8:29] conclusions
[8:30] but the love of God says step back a bit
[8:32] here and hear this person's heart and
[8:34] where they're coming from
[8:36] so that's my theme but I want to quickly
[8:37] if you would I want to get over these
[8:38] scriptures because I won't get to them
[8:39] turn with me if you would to First
[8:41] Corinthians 10.
[8:43] and you'll see the same themes in here
[8:45] first Corinthians 10.
[8:47] just a little study at the beginning I
[8:49] want you to catch and then we'll get
[8:50] into preaching a little bit First
[8:52] Corinthians 10 verse 1 says I Paul
[8:55] myself beseech you by the meekness and
[8:57] gentleness of Christ who in presence and
[9:00] base among you
[9:02] uh you know what I did I've got uh I
[9:05] think it's second Corinthians 10. all
[9:07] right am I there is is it first
[9:10] Corinthians 10 or second I don't know
[9:12] somebody tell me
[9:18] no it's not it's first it's first
[9:22] Corinthians 10
[9:25] . don't you all those all you old people
[9:27] laugh when I have a senior moment
[9:31] First Corinthians 10 1 moreover Brethren
[9:33] I would not that ye should be ignorant
[9:35] how that all of our fathers were under
[9:37] the cloud and all passed through the sea
[9:39] and were all baptized unto Moses the
[9:42] prophet in the cloud and in the sea and
[9:45] did all eat the same spiritual drink and
[9:47] did all drink the same spiritual drink
[9:49] for they drink of that spiritual rock
[9:51] that followed them and that rock was
[9:53] Christ now can anybody hear some of our
[9:56] history in the last days in the first
[9:58] four verses they have a cloud they have
[10:00] a prophet can you say Amen they all eat
[10:03] they all seem the same Miracles under
[10:04] the prophet they had a journey to come
[10:07] out of Egypt the message called them out
[10:09] of Egypt they got all the they got the
[10:11] cloud in the sky they got the pillar of
[10:13] fire at night they drank from the
[10:15] spiritual rock that was Rock was Christ
[10:16] they all enjoyed and this is this is our
[10:19] history now this is a a shadow of what
[10:22] took place today as God takes us through
[10:25] the last days Ministry out of Egypt can
[10:28] you say Amen so this is a shadow of our
[10:31] our history of the reality of what we
[10:33] have we have a prophet that Prophet went
[10:35] to the mountain he brought the word from
[10:38] the mountain how many believe that so
[10:40] this is us this is us look at the
[10:42] history here now verse 5 but with many
[10:45] of them God was not well pleased for
[10:47] they were overthrown in the wilderness
[10:49] these things were examples to the intent
[10:51] that we should not lust after evil
[10:53] things as they lusted neither be
[10:55] idolaters as were some of them as it was
[10:58] written the people sat down to eat and
[11:00] drink and Rose up to play neither let us
[11:02] commit fornication as some of them
[11:04] committed and fell in one day three and
[11:06] twenty thousand neither let us tempt
[11:09] Christ as some of them also tempted and
[11:11] were destroyed as servants neither
[11:13] murmur ye as some of them also murmured
[11:16] and were destroyed of the destroy this
[11:18] is I didn't want this to be a part of
[11:20] our history but I can tell you the same
[11:22] people that Wonder Prophet had these
[11:25] characteristics as well
[11:27] idolaters yes
[11:30] not the world not out the systems The
[11:33] People Under The Prophet
[11:35] to people under the cloud idolaters
[11:38] murmurs complaining tempting the Lord
[11:41] you know how they tempt the Lord they
[11:42] said is the Lord even among us or not
[11:45] that's tempting the Lord
[11:47] now all these things happen unto them
[11:49] for examples and they were unto us for
[11:52] examples and they were written for our
[11:53] admonition our rebuke upon whom the ends
[11:56] of the world are come so we see the
[11:59] history we see it it types us we see all
[12:02] those has happened but notice verse 12
[12:04] wherefore let him that thinketh he stand
[12:09] take heed lest he fall
[12:13] so now we have the same theme taking
[12:16] place here is the problem was the
[12:19] problem was not the profit the problem
[12:21] wasn't the pillar of fire the prophet
[12:24] wasn't God doing Supernatural things the
[12:27] problem was in their thinking
[12:30] and so if you're going to take their
[12:31] example then it's going to go back to
[12:33] our thing let him a man thinketh he
[12:36] stand take heed lest he fall if you get
[12:39] lifted up in yourself and says you know
[12:41] I don't need this I don't need to
[12:42] respect this I'm better than this it was
[12:45] their thinking and trying to work out is
[12:47] God Among Us or not why does God give us
[12:50] all this to eat and then now we're
[12:51] thirsty I want to go back to Egypt it
[12:53] was childishness and what the
[12:55] childishness was is they were using
[12:57] their own thinking to process the
[12:59] message
[13:03] they still after 40 years were using too
[13:07] much of their own thinking to process
[13:09] God and you can't use your mind to try
[13:12] to process God you won't figure it out
[13:15] you're going to be confused
[13:19] you can't let your mind abort the
[13:22] knowledge and what God's trying to do
[13:23] the knowledge of God you can't let the
[13:26] Mind interrupt that and so after all
[13:28] these examples don't be idolatrous you
[13:30] don't think we have idolatry in our own
[13:32] ranks we have idolatry yeah
[13:35] okay that's another message in itself
[13:37] but we do you don't think we have
[13:39] murmuring and complaining you don't
[13:41] think we have people committing a
[13:42] fornication well I don't live in
[13:44] fornication I don't even fornication is
[13:46] a young person living with another with
[13:47] a girl with a mate without being married
[13:49] to you we don't believe in that the
[13:51] Bible forbids it's against fornication
[13:53] if they're living with a man or a woman
[13:55] out of wedlock they're living in sin
[13:58] they're living in fornication how many
[14:00] still believe that
[14:02] it's your Bible can you say man but
[14:05] these had a fornication and it isn't
[14:06] always just physical fornication but
[14:09] they committed it sometimes it's
[14:11] spiritual fornication sometimes it's
[14:13] idolatry sometimes it's a different type
[14:15] of idolatry we have all this but where
[14:17] is the problem if you're going to take
[14:19] an example the problem is let a man take
[14:22] heed in his thinking when he thinketh he
[14:25] stand take heed lest he fall and they
[14:28] all fell in the wilderness even though
[14:30] they were under a prophet
[14:34] because what they didn't have an
[14:37] understanding
[14:38] and this is the the scripture that was
[14:41] used in a sermon
[14:43] and I'm not going to encourage you to
[14:44] listen to it because there's a sermon
[14:46] that's preached
[14:48] God being misunderstood
[14:52] God being misunderstood and he takes a
[14:55] text from Hebrews that says because they
[14:58] didn't understand God in the wilderness
[15:01] that's why we have these attributes
[15:05] they thought they understood but they
[15:06] didn't they let their own think you get
[15:08] in the way quickly turn with me to
[15:09] Psalms 106 7.
[15:19] Psalms 106.
[15:27] and verse 7.
[15:31] our fathers David talking about our
[15:34] history the history of the Jews our
[15:36] fathers understood not thy wonders in
[15:39] Egypt they remembered not the multitude
[15:42] of thy mercies but provoked him at the
[15:44] sea even at the Red Sea you can read the
[15:46] rest of yourself but that's the
[15:47] scripture used as a text God being
[15:50] misunderstood because they misunderstood
[15:52] God and didn't understand the Wonders
[15:55] and didn't understand what God was doing
[15:57] this is how they got into all this
[15:59] trouble quick with me go with back with
[16:01] me to the New Testament to Colossians
[16:04] chapter 2 if you would and as I said I'm
[16:06] just laying these in as a foundation and
[16:08] then we can move on but I want you to
[16:10] catch the themes they didn't understand
[16:13] Colossians chapter 2 and verse 1 says
[16:16] for I would that that ye knew what great
[16:19] conflict I have for you and for them at
[16:22] laodicea how many knows we live uh in
[16:25] the the age of laodicea so this
[16:27] reference we ought to have our ears
[16:29] perked because it's not just to them but
[16:30] it's to that that church of laodicea but
[16:33] it's to the age of laodicea he said the
[16:35] the great conflict I have for you and
[16:37] for them that laodicea for as many as
[16:39] have not seen my face in the flesh that
[16:42] their hearts might be comforted being
[16:44] knit together in love and unto all
[16:48] Riches of the full Assurance of what
[16:51] understanding the full Assurance of
[16:54] understanding
[16:56] to the acknowledgment of the mystery of
[16:58] God and the father and our Christ and
[17:01] that is the is the uh is a more intimate
[17:04] understanding of the mystery of God all
[17:08] of us need a more intimate understanding
[17:11] of the mystery of God
[17:13] and that's when you have your hearts
[17:15] knitted in love in whom are all hid the
[17:18] treasures of wisdom uh and knowledge
[17:22] and they will just leave it there but
[17:24] here's the same thing understanding
[17:26] here's the same thing love
[17:28] knitted together in love
[17:30] understanding growing Divine love seeks
[17:33] truth and seeks understanding that's
[17:35] what we're growing in in this Divine
[17:37] love our hearts being knit together oh
[17:39] how we love have a greater knit together
[17:42] knit together by what by Divine love not
[17:46] separating from one another but our
[17:49] hearts knit together by love you'll
[17:51] never get everybody together in their
[17:52] minds there's too many opinions and and
[17:55] mine are probably just as bad as yours
[17:57] but if we can lay opinions aside and lay
[17:59] our thinking aside and our complexes and
[18:03] our reading into things and say let
[18:05] Divine love knit our hearts together let
[18:08] this Supernatural thing happen Among Us
[18:11] but it comes by understanding one
[18:14] another and God deeper and if you won't
[18:16] take the time to understand somebody
[18:18] you're going to remain trapped in what
[18:21] you think of them
[18:24] Divine love will seek truth and seek
[18:27] understanding
[18:31] so all of these
[18:34] all of these are a theme of
[18:35] understanding love and they go together
[18:37] so with that scriptural basis now
[18:39] I'm presenting to you that Divine love
[18:41] when it's moving in you
[18:43] will always seek out the truth and true
[18:47] understanding it will always keep
[18:49] seeking more truth and understanding
[18:52] whether it's of God or whether it's of
[18:55] the other person
[18:56] and as the truth comes out and as more
[18:59] understanding comes out because you know
[19:01] I mentioned it a few weeks ago I can't
[19:03] remember how I said it but there's so
[19:04] many factors to something that happens
[19:07] and uh so a lot of people don't wait for
[19:10] the true facts to come in they just
[19:13] their mind concludes bang that's it
[19:15] that's what happened and then they
[19:17] categorize that person put them in a
[19:18] certain place you know they must be
[19:19] serpent seed
[19:21] we don't have a right to do that
[19:24] he must be this way he must be that way
[19:26] and we conclude lacking information
[19:28] lacking understanding of it can you say
[19:30] amen and and so there's a lot of factors
[19:33] to something that takes place in your
[19:34] life and uh you know something something
[19:37] happens sometimes when people 30 40
[19:40] years later in a family usually it's in
[19:43] family situations and something happened
[19:45] way back then and there was a
[19:47] disturbance and there was a disagreement
[19:48] and and so everybody Drew their lines in
[19:52] the sand everybody dug their heels in
[19:54] and I've talked to family members and
[19:56] say I've even talked to that person in
[19:58] 30 years since that incident I haven't
[20:00] talked to them in 30 years and not every
[20:02] situation is this way but some
[20:04] situations are is that somehow something
[20:07] happens where the more truth comes out
[20:09] and more understanding and they talk
[20:11] they're at a birthday party and they
[20:13] just talk and the other person says well
[20:14] I did this because of this and I was it
[20:17] and all of a sudden the other person
[20:18] goes I didn't know that
[20:21] I didn't know that's why you did that
[20:25] and now more after 30 years there's an
[20:28] understanding
[20:29] of what really took place and the facts
[20:33] we don't even go we're going to go with
[20:35] it when he when we don't even have all
[20:37] the facts in but I want to say this even
[20:39] when you got facts even when somebody
[20:41] has sinned
[20:43] even when you know that's the facts they
[20:45] did it I'm reminding you of Jesus when
[20:48] the Pharisees brought that woman they
[20:50] had facts they caught her in the ACT I'm
[20:52] going to say to you that the love of
[20:54] Christ is even greater than that it's
[20:58] greater than the truth there's
[20:59] forgiveness in it and it's greater than
[21:01] the facts you may stand there in your
[21:02] mind I got facts that's it it's truth it
[21:05] happened they did me wrong they sinned
[21:07] it's over not with the love of Christ
[21:09] it's never over
[21:14] you got the facts you got situation and
[21:16] then here's another thing you've got if
[21:18] you have all the facts you got that
[21:20] person's heart
[21:22] you don't know what their heart is
[21:23] because you're not a prophet
[21:27] maybe some of you think you are
[21:30] we're not Prophets
[21:32] God shows people in the body of Christ
[21:34] things I had somebody in the office this
[21:35] morning telling me a dream some of their
[21:37] dreams have come to pass
[21:39] this is the gifts working in the body
[21:41] sometimes they're the first thing I had
[21:43] dreams last night and you don't want me
[21:45] talking about my dreams because my crazy
[21:47] spaceships and all that
[21:52] had a stupid dream about the spaceship
[21:54] was waiting for us outside
[21:56] and I was fearful that my phone wouldn't
[21:59] work on it and I was in the store trying
[22:01] to find
[22:02] a bad a charger to take it with me on
[22:06] the trip and snacks I didn't know if
[22:08] they'd have any snacks and I was in the
[22:10] store
[22:11] in the dream grabbing up all the snacks
[22:14] but while I was going to say my wife got
[22:15] on the ship and the ship took off
[22:17] without me I missed the Rapture because
[22:20] of snacks
[22:22] that's kind of stupid dreams I have
[22:23] sometimes sometimes I'm not a dreamer so
[22:26] I don't have spiritual dreams a lot but
[22:27] I'm always sensitive to the body of
[22:29] Christ there's a sister in the church
[22:31] that had a few dreams a few months ago
[22:33] and three or four of those things have
[22:34] come to pass I'm just watching for the
[22:36] last one you don't think the spirit's
[22:38] moving within our body
[22:39] oh yeah because that's what it was not
[22:41] just the pastor's Gifts of preaching
[22:43] but you know that that's the thing is
[22:45] that you you can have something happen
[22:47] and not know the person's heart
[22:49] sometimes can you say man not know where
[22:52] they're at not under not understand
[22:54] where they were coming from during that
[22:56] time and misread and misinterpret and
[22:59] misunderstand
[23:01] why they acted that way it's not to
[23:03] justify sin but we should be seeking to
[23:06] know the full facts and know the
[23:08] understanding of the person's heart
[23:11] this is divine love
[23:13] this is what divine love does
[23:15] because when you got a full
[23:16] understanding of it then you really know
[23:18] how to pray you really know how to act
[23:21] you really know how to respond correctly
[23:23] instead of your mind figuring all out
[23:26] and you're concluding is that okay with
[23:28] everybody
[23:29] amen so
[23:31] uh so our hearts are to be rooted in in
[23:36] this love and our inner manners to be
[23:38] strengthened and we must be operating
[23:40] from the inward man and there is a quote
[23:43] that I want to read later if I get to it
[23:45] is that he says it never gives he says
[23:49] when we think with our own carnal mind
[23:51] like Cain did because Cain he hadn't
[23:54] figured out his worship was right he was
[23:56] bringing fruits and he he was about
[23:58] himself More Than This lamb a revelation
[24:02] that was provided for him and so he's
[24:05] elaborating on this subject the the
[24:07] prophet he's elaborating on it and all
[24:09] of a sudden he brings out and he shows
[24:11] that not only did he settle in his mind
[24:13] this is the way it is but he concluded I
[24:15] don't need Abel anymore and so I'm going
[24:17] to get rid of Abel
[24:19] this is how this is where our minds can
[24:20] take us
[24:22] denominational systems do this all the
[24:24] time
[24:25] denominational Spirits with on our ranks
[24:27] do this all the time you think carnally
[24:30] and then it says I don't need that other
[24:32] group I'm better than this other group I
[24:34] they categorize they they're in a
[24:36] certain group certain group and you put
[24:37] them in a category and now you can't
[24:38] fellowship with them now you now you
[24:40] shut them
[24:42] that's not Divine love
[24:45] when is the church going to be led by
[24:47] Divine love and our and not our own
[24:49] thinking in our own mind when are we
[24:52] going to be led by the spirit and love
[24:53] for the love of God because there's the
[24:54] power in there it dissolves all
[24:56] denominational differences it's greater
[24:58] than our opinions
[25:01] so so we we we see then there's so much
[25:04] in me from yesterday's studying that I'm
[25:07] I'm rushing ahead in my mind trying to
[25:09] get it all out here out of my heart so
[25:11] so now we see
[25:13] he says that he says Cain he said then
[25:17] he wants to say I don't need Abel he
[25:19] actually kills Abel I don't need this
[25:21] man in my life and guess what he did
[25:24] need Abel in his life because Abel was
[25:26] the man pointing to the right sacrifice
[25:28] and if he had a revelation like Abel he
[25:32] would have known that it wasn't about
[25:34] him it wasn't about Abel it was about
[25:36] both of us have one sacrifice Jesus
[25:39] Christ and if we would all focus on that
[25:42] one need everybody has a need for that
[25:45] sacrifice Christ and if we get our eyes
[25:48] on one thing and focus all that we all
[25:51] need the Lamb of God
[25:53] don't try to think it any further don't
[25:56] put a category on somebody else say and
[25:58] Cain should have said
[26:00] I I don't like what's happening here but
[26:02] Abel is pointing me to the right
[26:04] sacrifice
[26:06] and Abel needs it but I need the same
[26:09] sacrifice it's my substitute it's not
[26:12] about me saving myself it's not about
[26:14] bringing my own fruits bringing my own
[26:16] good works that I've done to God no he
[26:18] doesn't want those good works we have
[26:21] one substitute for our sin all of us
[26:23] need it it's Calvary it's our lamb and
[26:25] if we would have that one Focus for
[26:27] everybody we would quit worrying about
[26:29] who's better than the next person
[26:31] or murdering he murdered Abel he
[26:33] murdered him because his denominational
[26:35] spirit and his mind figured out that if
[26:38] I can just remove Abel I'll be okay if I
[26:41] can just remove this preacher out of my
[26:42] life be careful
[26:45] be careful
[26:47] because he may have humanness he may you
[26:50] may not like some of the things he does
[26:52] but what's he pointing you to
[26:58] what's he pointing you to
[26:59] and hopefully if it's a menace to gospel
[27:02] he's pointing you to the lamb
[27:06] I have a substitute you have a
[27:08] substitute and there is no big eyes or
[27:11] little use and I'm better my mind's
[27:12] better we dress better we dress less or
[27:15] poor or rich or more talented it all
[27:19] just dissolves we all need one thing the
[27:21] most talented musicians needs the same
[27:23] lamb and without it he's lost
[27:26] the poorest person in the church needs
[27:28] the same lamb the rich person the
[27:30] richest person in the church which isn't
[27:32] me and we don't have a lot of picture it
[27:33] might be you but guess what your riches
[27:35] will do you nothing you need the same
[27:37] lamb that I do you need a substitute for
[27:39] your sin
[27:43] and he says in that he says Cain did
[27:45] that and he says that's the way we
[27:48] function in a denominational spirit and
[27:50] he says it never is what I want you to
[27:52] catch it never gives the inward man a
[27:55] chance to operate
[27:58] it blocks the inward man and we're
[28:00] supposed to be living from the inward
[28:01] man Christ every day every hour
[28:04] everything perfect Faith Masters every
[28:06] circumstance this interrupted every time
[28:10] never gives it when I read that years
[28:12] ago I love that quote I love how he says
[28:14] it I said I don't want to be Cain I want
[28:15] to have the mindset of Cain and but I
[28:19] want to operate from the inward man
[28:22] and I don't want my mind to interrupt
[28:24] that
[28:25] I got a soul here I got the love of God
[28:27] in my soul
[28:28] I want to be functioning and operating
[28:31] from the inward man
[28:33] my Divine love isn't it time
[28:38] haven't we been through so much history
[28:39] like Israel's here's history how many
[28:41] years in this message haven't we been
[28:44] through so much
[28:45] haven't we seen so much in groups rising
[28:48] up and we got more resolution than you
[28:50] and we got more gifts than you and
[28:53] aren't we tired of all this if the
[28:55] inward man was operating you never get
[28:57] that result out of it
[28:59] isn't it I'm asking this church isn't it
[29:03] time that we're operating from Divine
[29:05] love isn't it time that our
[29:07] denominational differences end
[29:10] isn't it time that we quit lifting up
[29:12] big preachers and making little ones
[29:14] more little and isn't it time to grow
[29:16] out of all this childishness
[29:23] isn't this the final end operating from
[29:26] the inward man every individual
[29:27] operating including preachers operating
[29:30] from the inward man
[29:32] I can tell you everything possible
[29:34] everything is possible when coming from
[29:36] that inward man all things are possible
[29:39] but most the time I wonder if we're not
[29:41] giving him a chance to operate we're all
[29:43] Christians this morning we all love God
[29:46] we're lovely people you're all lovely
[29:48] people I love you all of you I hope you
[29:50] love me I believe you do but I wonder
[29:52] how many decisions every day and actions
[29:55] are made in our life from another source
[29:57] than your inward mind
[30:00] that's what Thrills me about the grace
[30:01] of God today
[30:03] I'm thrilled about the grace of God
[30:06] because
[30:07] we have his favor
[30:09] to receive preaching like this
[30:15] we are favored of God to hear what God
[30:20] wants to give us through the ministry
[30:22] and through what we read in our Bibles
[30:24] and study the word we are favored
[30:26] because he's going to give us
[30:27] instruction and he's going to lead us if
[30:29] we'll yield
[30:31] into a life of let this mind be in you
[30:34] which is also in Christ Jesus and that
[30:36] we're LED from the inward man
[30:38] his grace is going to lead us there if
[30:40] we'll submit
[30:42] submissions got such a bad word to it a
[30:45] bad connotation today it's a Biblical
[30:47] word
[30:51] no matter how many decisions so it
[30:52] Thrills me of the Grace today we are we
[30:55] have his favor and listen to this
[30:56] despite this overwhelming influence of
[30:59] our flesh the overwhelming influence of
[31:02] our minds the overwhelming influence of
[31:04] our past our fears our abuse from other
[31:08] people are people that have targeted us
[31:11] our mistakes our sins our weaknesses our
[31:16] inbred family sins and strains in our
[31:18] family our pride and if you are
[31:21] eliminating you from any of these I'm
[31:23] reading you've got too much pride all of
[31:25] us have this
[31:29] say Amen or ouch or something
[31:33] inbred weaknesses from family inbred
[31:36] strains and family pride of family Pride
[31:38] a religious Pride our fleshly atmosphere
[31:41] we live in our laodicean age of laziness
[31:43] spiritually our dirty sex appeal-driven
[31:46] world it's a dirty sexual uh perverted
[31:49] world can you say man our material and
[31:52] money driven America that everything's
[31:54] about the Mighty Dollar you take all
[31:56] that and God's grace still comes down to
[31:58] us and said but I want you to live from
[32:01] the Imran
[32:04] I'm calling to you to something higher
[32:06] it's not your possessions it's not your
[32:08] businesses it's not how somebody has
[32:10] done you wrong that's all lesser things
[32:12] let's let loose of lesser things let's
[32:15] let it go and get to living from Divine
[32:17] love
[32:21] no wonder if it's difficult to give the
[32:22] internet a chance to operate no wonder
[32:24] in the age we live in and yet his grace
[32:26] still leads us and Longs for us to be
[32:28] operating from the inward man instead of
[32:30] anything else we will come to perfection
[32:32] in this age by the grace of God and that
[32:36] along he shall bring forth The Headstone
[32:39] with cryings Grace Grace unto it the
[32:42] Capstone will come down to his people
[32:44] crying with Grace Grace unto it somebody
[32:46] say praise the Lord
[32:49] because when I look at it it's too
[32:51] impossible but his grace is going to do
[32:53] it let us not justify ourselves and
[32:55] expect to stay fleshly driven in our
[32:57] lives I'm a Christian brother Paul I'm a
[33:00] Christian I I believe that you are but
[33:03] are you spirit-led and divine Love Led
[33:07] or is everything coming through the
[33:09] filter of your mind and actually blocks
[33:11] when the spirit's leaving leading you to
[33:13] do something deeper
[33:20] when I say Divine love seeks truth and
[33:22] understanding it's pretty simple
[33:24] to know what I'm talking about because
[33:26] the other way of life Divine love not
[33:28] seeking the truth understanding our
[33:30] minds do not seek the truth and do not
[33:32] seek greater understanding what happens
[33:34] then what happens when we don't speak
[33:37] deeper understanding of something oh my
[33:41] God do you got an extra three hours
[33:42] today
[33:44] to talk about what's happening in you
[33:47] and in me when we're not letting the
[33:50] Divine love get a greater understanding
[33:52] of God and one another what can happen
[33:55] oh my a lot of things can happen
[34:00] if we doubt
[34:03] that we have complete truth or
[34:04] understanding of something if we have
[34:06] that
[34:07] we draw premature conclusions if we
[34:11] don't have a full understanding we
[34:14] misjudge matters when we don't have a
[34:17] full understanding
[34:18] we misjudge one another when we don't
[34:22] have a full understanding we walk with a
[34:25] lack of understanding of anything when
[34:27] we do that we will hold it like there's
[34:30] truth in our like like there's like
[34:32] their truths in our minds that their
[34:34] final truth and I've been preaching uh
[34:36] to you was Wednesday night if you want
[34:38] to listen to it again just the power of
[34:41] our imagination getting in the way our
[34:44] imagination is so powerful that it
[34:46] creates these thoughts and brings these
[34:48] and it develops it and develops it and
[34:50] then we don't have an understanding of
[34:51] situation and we hold truths in our
[34:54] minds and we've made them truths and
[34:56] reality in our minds and come to find
[34:58] out it may not be full truth
[35:00] it may not be with the full
[35:02] understanding but look at Wednesday
[35:03] night stinking thinking and coming at us
[35:06] thinking thinking we all have a bit of
[35:07] it and and our imagination look at that
[35:10] example that the prophet gave that he
[35:12] says now you can think in your mind that
[35:14] brother hates me
[35:16] he said it's not true
[35:19] but you thought it and if you keep
[35:21] thinking about it your imagination goes
[35:23] to work
[35:25] goes to work and it builds and it builds
[35:28] and it's built that brother doesn't hate
[35:29] you at all in that situation there might
[35:31] be brothers that hate you
[35:35] but don't you ever let your mind
[35:37] conclude that unless you know that it's
[35:38] true
[35:39] and then what do I do with that he hates
[35:41] me he hates me he hates me well there's
[35:42] only one answer and still the Divine
[35:44] love of God I love you if you hate me if
[35:47] you spit in my face I love you as a
[35:50] brother I'll wipe my face off and I'm
[35:52] gonna love you anyway because love is
[35:55] the most powerful force in the world
[36:00] but our imagination gets a lot of people
[36:03] in our lives that we think hate us or
[36:05] our
[36:06] turning targeting us
[36:09] I'm not supposed to get political here
[36:10] but I'm just watching these the squad I
[36:13] guess the squad the four women they're
[36:16] and they're in Congress they get mad
[36:17] because one of them gets kicked out of a
[36:19] committee because she made anti-jew
[36:23] comments against the Jews she never
[36:24] apologized for him she can't really sit
[36:27] on a foreign committee when she's making
[36:29] statements like that so they took her
[36:31] off and all these women are just
[36:33] blasting and and you know we're being
[36:36] targeted because we're women of color
[36:38] and we're this and the LGBT and all they
[36:41] go into all this stuff in their mind and
[36:43] guess what everything everything gets
[36:46] ruled through their filter everything is
[36:48] concluded racism I'm being targeted
[36:51] everything gets
[36:54] I don't mean to use them for example but
[36:56] I'm saying that's how powerful the mind
[36:58] gets
[37:01] not truth not a not everything is a
[37:04] racist problem
[37:05] we do have a racist problem but not
[37:07] everything is that
[37:10] not everything is a targeting of you
[37:13] uh
[37:15] Mrs
[37:18] whatever her name is
[37:21] AOC
[37:23] not everything comes to just that same
[37:26] Concrete in her mind this is targeting
[37:29] women of color it's not true
[37:32] but it always gets comes through there
[37:35] amen
[37:37] how many conclusions have we made about
[37:40] God and others that did not have the
[37:42] full truth to them
[37:45] how many years ago did it happen
[37:48] and there are stories like I said that
[37:50] go on for years and then all of a sudden
[37:52] there's an understanding
[37:53] and there's been walls up for years been
[37:55] hatred for years and then somehow it
[37:57] gets talked about and ends up that the
[37:59] whole thing was a complete
[38:00] misunderstanding no one took the time to
[38:04] be adults
[38:06] and sit down and seek the full story
[38:15] conclude about things there's something
[38:18] about our thing that wants to bring a
[38:20] final judgment on stuff
[38:22] and really only God has the final say
[38:26] God has the final judgment on matters we
[38:29] should be able to judge matters Paul
[38:31] said that to the Corinthians you
[38:32] shouldn't be going to law with one
[38:33] another you should be judge matters
[38:35] amongst yourself in other words he's
[38:36] saying you should have the maturity to
[38:38] work it out the judge matters it's
[38:40] settled it's done we're going on with
[38:41] the Lord
[38:43] but no nobody wants to sit down and be
[38:45] adults about it and our mind wants to
[38:47] judge it wants to conclude and it wants
[38:50] to put people in a category I don't know
[38:52] why our minds think this way and do this
[38:55] but it doesn't Divine love does it but
[38:57] our minds do it and I don't know why if
[39:00] anybody knows why please come and tell
[39:02] me
[39:03] our mind wants to judge final judgment
[39:05] he wants to put everybody in a category
[39:07] it wants to conclude it wants to push
[39:09] people out
[39:11] it wants to say I can't I don't want to
[39:13] fellowship with that person anymore uh
[39:15] it's happy to conclude without full
[39:18] understanding I'm good with the walls
[39:20] that are up I'm good with years of
[39:21] holding a grudge
[39:28] I don't know why we're bent that way but
[39:30] we are our thinking without the love of
[39:32] God lists itself to a status of God
[39:35] itself
[39:37] our minds are the facts the law our
[39:40] minds bring the facts
[39:43] our minds are the lawyer our minds are
[39:46] the jury and our minds are the judge and
[39:49] our minds are the sentence
[39:52] we got a whole Court in our imagination
[39:54] in our mind and we did it all we didn't
[39:56] need any input at all
[39:58] am I telling the truth here a little bit
[40:00] of the truth here this morning you know
[40:02] I'm not preaching about some uh
[40:04] reprobate in mind I'm talking about your
[40:06] mind because you have the same mind as
[40:07] them it's just you're yielding it to the
[40:09] Lord
[40:10] but it can interrupt it can judge it can
[40:12] sentence it can bring a final judgment
[40:14] on something and our minds are too
[40:16] limited and and not infinite they're
[40:18] finite and they're they're not infinite
[40:20] like gauze and it's quite often because
[40:22] God knows all things he's the infinite
[40:24] God he knows every hair of your head of
[40:27] everybody's head you don't understand
[40:29] infinite like that he knows everything
[40:31] he knew it from the beginning your mind
[40:33] don't know that
[40:37] it's quite often
[40:39] that our minds becomes the whole justice
[40:41] system and it becomes like the justice
[40:43] system in our world that is not very
[40:45] balanced and doesn't get to the full
[40:47] truth sometimes
[40:49] our thinking becomes a filter besides
[40:51] events that never get a full
[40:53] understanding it filters all future
[40:55] events through that filter did you hear
[40:58] what I said our thinking becomes a
[41:00] filter besides events that never get a
[41:03] full understanding it filters all future
[41:05] events through that filter to where
[41:08] there's no trust
[41:10] but I'm preaching to you the love of God
[41:12] and the love of God is not that way and
[41:14] it seeks truth and it seats
[41:15] understanding of one another
[41:18] can you say man
[41:23] this is a presence that seeks out and is
[41:26] mature enough to fully understand before
[41:28] it makes a judgment call and then it's a
[41:31] power to wash all sin away and wash it
[41:34] away to forgive and not just forgive to
[41:38] be reconciled because how many know if
[41:40] you've studied it there's a difference
[41:41] in forgiveness and Reconciliation you
[41:44] can forgive somebody but not be
[41:45] reconciled you say well how can I
[41:47] reconcile somebody who doesn't reconcile
[41:49] that's not your fault that's their fault
[41:51] but Divine love is not only seeking
[41:53] forgiveness and repentance it's seeking
[41:56] reconciliation
[41:58] I must bring that if I can do everything
[42:00] to bring that together to understand to
[42:03] forgive and bring the fellowship that
[42:05] Satan doesn't get in between us I must
[42:07] bring it together as best I can
[42:10] in the face shut it down then I've done
[42:12] my part to express the love of God but
[42:14] we should not stop at forgiveness my
[42:18] relationship with the Lord did not stop
[42:20] when he forgave me I have been
[42:22] reconciled in Fellowship back to my god
[42:25] there are no walls between us there is
[42:28] no guilt if I sit and make a mistake I
[42:30] bring it quickly under the blood and I'm
[42:33] right back in Fellowship again I don't
[42:35] just have a forgiveness God's forgive me
[42:36] thank God and there's a lot of people
[42:38] that are in denominations they've been
[42:40] forgiven 30 years ago at the altar but
[42:42] they're living a life of sin you haven't
[42:44] been reconciled back to God
[42:46] you've been forgiven you've been
[42:48] forgiven but when you repent and this is
[42:52] the three basis for relationship true
[42:54] repentance
[42:55] true forgiveness
[42:57] and true reconciliation
[43:03] I knew it would be a little bit more
[43:04] teaching this morning
[43:07] forgive and not just forgive but to be
[43:09] reconciled
[43:10] and when you reconciled not one trace of
[43:14] ill feeling towards that person
[43:21] if some of you feel like that
[43:23] I'm preaching way up here Out Of Reach
[43:26] for you well guess what I feel the same
[43:28] way
[43:29] but it's not Out Of Reach if he said it
[43:31] in the Bible
[43:33] what everything is reachable by the
[43:35] grace of God
[43:36] but I feel that way too and I'm
[43:38] delivering my heart today
[43:40] because I'm headed on vacation tomorrow
[43:43] and I'm laying it all on the table
[43:46] I hope you pick up what I'm laying down
[43:49] praise the Lord
[43:51] so you know I wonder if that's how many
[43:54] Church splits take place
[43:57] I wonder how many Church splits took
[43:58] place for people leaving
[44:00] were based upon an unresolved
[44:02] misunderstanding
[44:04] and they find out years later
[44:07] and they're not adult enough to sit down
[44:08] and work it out clear it all out clear
[44:10] it and then we both move on pray about
[44:12] what the will of God is but there's no
[44:14] clearing up of it there's no the mind
[44:16] even stops you from doing the brotherly
[44:19] thing it exalted itself and the mind
[44:22] even says no I'm not going to go talk to
[44:24] that person no I'm not going to go try
[44:25] to resolve this I'm not going to do it
[44:27] your mind says that because we're afraid
[44:29] of Confrontation
[44:31] they're not they're not going to listen
[44:33] anyway
[44:35] it's all here this isn't down here
[44:38] it's all here it's not worth it I don't
[44:40] like confrontation I just I'm an easy
[44:42] going fella you know just let everything
[44:45] just happen and there's only thing one
[44:47] thing I can see in the scriptures
[44:48] sometimes that would make us be silent
[44:50] and that's when Jesus was falsely
[44:52] accused and he opened not his mouth
[44:56] but most other things and sometimes even
[44:58] that you're seeking understanding
[45:01] and you're seeking reconciliation this
[45:04] is what the love of God does but there's
[45:06] not enough adulthood sometimes to sit
[45:08] down work it out clear it out move on
[45:09] the Mind stops you from doing just the
[45:12] brotherly love thing which I can give
[45:13] you several scriptures someone has ought
[45:15] against you someone has overtaken in a
[45:17] fault ye with your spiritual goal
[45:19] restores such a one in the spirit of
[45:21] meekness considering yourself lest you
[45:23] fall also I don't see this happening a
[45:25] lot
[45:27] we're too scared to do it our mind
[45:30] interrupted our mind aborts it
[45:32] I imagine says hey let's leave it alone
[45:35] not always we shouldn't always leave it
[45:37] alone
[45:38] the scripture encourages us to try to
[45:40] resolve
[45:44] scripture says go to another one go to
[45:46] another one the mind is locked its
[45:48] exalts itself said I don't really need
[45:51] them anyway in my life
[45:53] or I tried I tried to do it I text them
[45:56] and said hello and they never
[45:58] reconciled with me
[46:01] you text them and said hello that was an
[46:04] effort to reconcile
[46:06] that's it they're done you know I tried
[46:08] you did
[46:13] no spending time to really resolve it
[46:17] this is something to advise to all of
[46:20] our Lives brothers and sisters all of
[46:21] our Lives there's so many examples now
[46:23] that I could give you in my life so that
[46:25] I'm not preaching at you I'm preaching
[46:27] it myself of misunderstandings and a
[46:30] lack of understanding for the heart and
[46:32] red things the wrong way because of not
[46:35] fully understanding
[46:37] and lack of this can damage the family
[46:43] parents must make adjustments all the
[46:46] time to the different ages of their
[46:47] children
[46:48] if you approach a teenager like a
[46:51] five-year-old and you keep doing that
[46:54] and you don't have an understanding of
[46:56] what age they're at now you're going to
[46:58] damage your family
[47:00] if you're getting the belt out every
[47:02] time
[47:04] can I say that publicly like that
[47:08] still in the word
[47:10] state law in Ohio
[47:12] still
[47:14] you can discipline your children
[47:16] I don't know about Michigan I haven't
[47:17] checked that one yet
[47:21] I'm sure Gabrielle will be checking it
[47:23] out
[47:26] see what rights I have as a daddy
[47:31] I'm just teasing on me
[47:33] when you have a lack of understanding
[47:35] and I'm only bringing one or two
[47:36] examples here because we could go on all
[47:38] day about this this is I just want to
[47:40] tell you this is in our lives okay if
[47:42] you don't let the love of God seek
[47:44] understanding
[47:46] then it's it's stopped short of a full
[47:48] victory
[47:51] uh I've watched mothers and fathers
[47:55] hover over
[47:57] you know 20 year old kids and 30 year
[48:00] old kids
[48:01] and it becomes unhealthy
[48:04] because they're still given input as if
[48:07] they were 10 or 12 years old and they're
[48:10] still because they're they're not
[48:11] understanding things have changed and so
[48:13] instead of speaking about you I speak
[48:15] about me I I've had that to make those
[48:17] adjustments and it's been very hard on
[48:19] me as the kids change and things seasons
[48:22] change can you say amen and so how you
[48:25] handle it is different you know and you
[48:28] have to adjust yourself and sometimes
[48:32] back off there can be times that you're
[48:35] you're weighing in pretty heavy to the
[48:37] will of God for their life
[48:40] and they need to be given everybody
[48:42] listening when they come to certain ages
[48:45] especially over 20 21 years old they
[48:48] need to be given Liberty to find the
[48:50] will of God from their for their life
[48:52] from God himself
[48:54] oh but I'm the parent and I weigh in and
[48:56] I and wait a minute you need to give
[48:58] them Liberty to find what the world is
[49:00] and then if they feel like it's the will
[49:01] of God give your counsel give your input
[49:03] but if they say this is the will this is
[49:05] what I feel to do you need to support
[49:07] them in what God's telling you and not
[49:10] abort what God's telling them to do is
[49:12] that okay with everybody
[49:14] because you're not understanding the
[49:16] different season you're in and and I
[49:19] have to understand and those changes
[49:20] take place you have to make a judgment
[49:22] there are some points you don't say
[49:24] anything at all because you will get
[49:26] told you will get told sometimes that
[49:28] Dad you have already taught me this for
[49:31] all these years I know what you're doing
[49:34] but you don't need to say it again
[49:37] you've said this a hundred times I know
[49:39] what to do I need to go and do you know
[49:42] and so so but but we think they've never
[49:44] heard it before
[49:46] and they have
[49:48] so as I step back and say you know she's
[49:51] right they're right I have said this a
[49:54] million times I've done my work to
[49:56] invest and give the word of God to my
[49:58] children now it's time for me to back
[50:00] off and pray for their lives
[50:03] if they come and ask for my counsel
[50:06] which is like wow
[50:11] whoa
[50:13] that hasn't happened in a long time
[50:16] let's have coffee I got a few questions
[50:18] for whoa I'm there what time I'll be
[50:21] there
[50:23] yeah they're asking for it
[50:25] what's the thing that says when I was 15
[50:28] years old old
[50:30] when I was five years old my parents
[50:32] knew everything when I was 15 they knew
[50:35] a little bit when I was 21 they didn't
[50:37] know anything when I was 30 I said I
[50:40] called Dad said what do you think about
[50:42] this then when I get to be 40 or 50
[50:44] years old my parents knew everything
[50:47] it's a season of life it's what they go
[50:50] through as teenagers in different
[50:51] seasons
[50:52] yeah I know I'm preaching some to some
[50:55] teenagers here they're seeing their side
[50:57] because they don't think their parents
[50:58] know anything right now
[51:01] but yeah that's one thing about me is
[51:05] that I get people emailing me from
[51:08] around the world and I don't say that
[51:10] boastfully and I can't even get to all
[51:12] the emails that are asking just just for
[51:15] an ounce of my advice
[51:16] about parenting about this and about
[51:19] that and this situation in a church and
[51:21] all this stuff from around the world
[51:24] and some of my kids never
[51:26] want to know what I have to say
[51:30] I don't mean to put them down because
[51:31] they're they're respectful and they do
[51:33] want to hear what I want to say but and
[51:35] I've said that to them I got people
[51:37] emailing me now asking all these things
[51:40] just want to know and you know sometimes
[51:42] I got people here even among us that
[51:44] they don't value it like that that's
[51:46] fine that's fine but you see now it's an
[51:49] understanding and I won't go back up
[51:51] there and look at it but you remember
[51:52] something that happened with um
[51:54] brother branham's daughter 18 years old
[51:57] she hit 18 and there was quite a
[52:00] quite some actions going on that hadn't
[52:02] happened quite before
[52:05] I get to that let me let me talk about
[52:08] something here
[52:10] he mentions this word understanding of
[52:12] things and I could take this a million
[52:14] different directions but I want to give
[52:15] these examples because I think they're
[52:17] where really where the rubber meets the
[52:19] road sometimes
[52:20] he mentions about understanding a
[52:23] husband understanding a wife a wife
[52:25] understanding sit down and try to
[52:28] understand them and children sit down
[52:31] and try to understand this 18 year old
[52:33] and let's think 18 year old thoughts you
[52:36] adjust yourself I'm going to think 18
[52:39] year old thoughts now and you know what
[52:40] that is that's that's really the love of
[52:42] God saying I'm not going to think about
[52:44] it the way I thought about it before no
[52:46] compromising now
[52:48] but but there's no understanding of
[52:50] where you're at right now and you have
[52:52] to understand that person where they're
[52:54] coming from
[52:55] do they have a sickness going on do they
[52:58] have something emotionally going on and
[53:01] you blast them and you don't know that's
[53:02] taken place
[53:03] you got to get an understanding
[53:06] yeah none of it justify and sin because
[53:08] that's the guilt we always get we're
[53:10] justifying the sin in their life and
[53:11] what they're doing that's not it I'm
[53:13] talking about an understanding so you
[53:15] can make you know how to pray and you
[53:17] have a good judgment call of things that
[53:18] are going on okay and and so now this is
[53:22] applied to children and parents
[53:24] um mothers hovering over holding their
[53:27] children back uh you know it's just
[53:30] unhealthy
[53:32] in leadership he speaks that you know
[53:34] and the cycles of our life you know we
[53:37] send our kids to school and the teacher
[53:39] gets to train him
[53:40] and the mother has the child first and
[53:43] mentors them and does everything she can
[53:44] and then she has to back off because now
[53:46] the teacher's giving them things and
[53:49] then he said then they get to certain
[53:50] age and they've got to take over the
[53:51] father's business said then the mother
[53:52] backs off and now the daddy takes over
[53:54] to give leadership those are all Cycles
[53:57] if you got where that's not normally
[53:59] naturally health healthy happening
[54:02] you're going to have a 30 year old in
[54:05] the home and mom's still being treating
[54:08] them like a 10 year old
[54:10] completely unhealthy
[54:12] you're not understanding what's going on
[54:15] in the next cycle
[54:20] I want to talk about menopause a little
[54:22] bit
[54:27] it is a quote here
[54:30] foreign
[54:31] Branham he has a question
[54:33] I don't know if you guys have this one I
[54:35] think you do back there
[54:36] you have the quotes
[54:38] first quote
[54:45] for the ram I love the Lord but for the
[54:47] past year I have been faced with a
[54:49] problem
[54:50] seems sometimes I've always been out of
[54:52] my I've I've almost been out of my mind
[54:55] what is it please pray for me eat this
[54:59] and my husband
[55:02] when I read that last I had just laughed
[55:04] and laughed and left because he don't
[55:07] have the mental things going on but he's
[55:10] there and something's going because
[55:11] she's asking prayer for me but my
[55:13] husband also
[55:15] it says so much
[55:17] well if if this person was going on a
[55:20] private interview with me like the
[55:22] people being in there this morning it
[55:23] would pull that out what it is whatever
[55:25] it is you see because he's a prophet
[55:27] next quote
[55:29] the Lord would reveal what it is but now
[55:31] that I don't know who you are and you're
[55:33] not sitting here it is just a sister in
[55:36] Christ now now if there's something that
[55:38] you have done that's wrong that's
[55:39] bothered you so he's just breaking it
[55:41] down now then check it with the Bible
[55:43] and see what you must do but if you
[55:45] haven't done anything and you're not
[55:46] condemned of anything it's perhaps your
[55:49] nerves you see
[55:51] so now I'm just I'm teaching us here now
[55:53] as a pastor that different situations
[55:57] can be different and you can quickly in
[55:59] your mind say well they've like the
[56:01] woman they've got an evil spirit on them
[56:02] you know they got a demon Spirit
[56:04] controlling them you may not know that
[56:07] and you you've labeled a nervousness a
[56:08] demon spirit and and so it could be many
[56:11] things that happen maybe some trouble
[56:12] back in your life it's a woman here
[56:14] might be in the menopause time he's not
[56:16] saying she is but it might be and listen
[56:18] now that's when everything is wrong with
[56:20] her and there's nothing wrong with her
[56:24] yet everything's wrong with her
[56:28] and that's why the husband needs prayer
[56:31] too that's why she said pray for my
[56:33] husband too because he doesn't
[56:34] understand this he doesn't understand
[56:37] what she's going through everything has
[56:39] changed there's something back in the
[56:41] library there Sister Margaret can get it
[56:43] for you but he actually sister Rebecca
[56:46] wrote about this because when she hit 18
[56:48] and her mom started to hit impulse
[56:50] menopause and she's hitting and they
[56:53] they begin to clash the two of them in
[56:54] the home because both of them are
[56:57] hitting a change of life at the same
[56:58] time and there was this this going on
[57:00] between them and they didn't understand
[57:01] what's going on what changed and he sat
[57:03] him down you can read it in article sat
[57:05] him down she remembers brother but I'm
[57:06] sending them down and explaining to us
[57:08] they understand this is what's going on
[57:09] and when he when they understood it they
[57:11] could be more tolerant to one another
[57:13] and understanding one another this isn't
[57:15] a devil this is a this is a conflict our
[57:17] bodies are changing
[57:20] so that's when everything's wrong with
[57:22] her there's and there's nothing wrong
[57:24] with her yet everything's wrong with her
[57:25] and she's not just putting on she really
[57:28] feels that it's just as real any person
[57:30] that's nervous is that way and don't
[57:33] never disagree
[57:36] I'm not you know I'm not making fun of
[57:38] this because this is real I mean we have
[57:41] several sisters going through this in
[57:43] the assembly okay and there needs to be
[57:46] a care there needs to be an
[57:47] understanding especially from the
[57:50] husbands
[57:52] you can try to approach it when you were
[57:54] first married all you want to
[57:57] and that ain't going to work
[57:59] well I want it like it was when we were
[58:01] first married I want to
[58:03] well grow up
[58:06] if you understand this part better
[58:09] then maybe you'll come into a different
[58:11] season of feeling like it was when
[58:13] you're first married
[58:15] but you got to discipline yourself to
[58:17] understand this season this is real
[58:19] brother Brahm says this and this is just
[58:21] not putting on she feels that it's just
[58:23] as real any person you can have all the
[58:25] answers you want to say you know get
[58:27] yourself together and this is ridiculous
[58:29] you know you're only damaging it more
[58:31] any person that's nervous that way and
[58:33] don't never disagree is there more quote
[58:36] to it and you husbands to your wives
[58:37] when they're in that time of life if you
[58:40] ever did any of you husbands or men
[58:42] think that you're going to be preached
[58:43] on this morning like this you never came
[58:46] thinking that
[58:47] but that's that's what it is that's my
[58:50] Ministry I guess and you husbands your
[58:51] wives when they're in that time of life
[58:53] if you she ever was your sweetheart you
[58:56] let her be right then because she needs
[58:58] you
[58:59] she really needs your help she needs
[59:02] somebody to help her and understand her
[59:04] there's the word understanding
[59:09] don't try to figure it out in your mind
[59:11] let the Divine love try to understand
[59:13] her is that okay with everybody
[59:15] it's using an example of a different
[59:17] season that you hit and there needs to
[59:19] be the love of Christ and the
[59:20] understanding of things there's some
[59:22] things that might be said that maybe
[59:25] aren't true okay
[59:28] maybe aren't true and there's no sense
[59:30] in human being that critical because you
[59:32] go through a midlife too
[59:34] it's emotional but it's mostly just
[59:37] looking for the next truck you want to
[59:40] buy or the boat
[59:41] that's how it comes out in you okay
[59:44] that's how you vent that midlife crisis
[59:47] okay but she vents it a different way so
[59:51] if she understands you buying that boat
[59:53] if you got her on board with that you're
[59:55] doing good
[59:58] but if she's understanding you that
[1:00:00] there's some changes in this guy he's
[1:00:01] acting different
[1:00:03] become a little disgruntled about stuff
[1:00:05] too much or whatever but just try to
[1:00:06] understand what's going on
[1:00:08] but if she's going to do that for you
[1:00:10] Brothers then here's your cue from the
[1:00:13] prophet sit down understand her if she
[1:00:16] ever was your sweetheart you let her be
[1:00:18] right then because she needs you she
[1:00:19] really needs your help she needs
[1:00:21] somebody to help her and understand her
[1:00:22] take to her talk to her
[1:00:24] take her up in your arms like she was
[1:00:27] your sweetheart and she should be is
[1:00:29] there any more Rebecca and understand
[1:00:31] her because she's going through a time
[1:00:33] that her entire makeup is changing and
[1:00:36] you must be good to her at that time
[1:00:40] I think that's why Mr Rockefeller made a
[1:00:42] fatal mistake he was loved by the nation
[1:00:44] would have probably been our next
[1:00:46] president
[1:00:47] but when his wife took menopause and
[1:00:48] went in menopause he left her and
[1:00:50] married his secretary and you see what
[1:00:52] happened that shows there's some real
[1:00:54] good thinking Americans yet why because
[1:00:55] they didn't based on what he did to his
[1:00:58] wife they didn't put him in as president
[1:00:59] so some still some good thinking
[1:01:02] Americans I'm wondering about the
[1:01:04] thinking Americans now who we have in
[1:01:06] but I'm not supposed to be political
[1:01:09] I don't think we have too many thinking
[1:01:10] Americans left
[1:01:12] but they were right don't put that man
[1:01:15] in
[1:01:16] he's got that in his life he puts his
[1:01:17] wife and goes had an affair with another
[1:01:19] woman because he can't understand what
[1:01:21] she's going through that's not love
[1:01:37] this is not in the slides sister Rebecca
[1:01:39] this is this is when he was talking
[1:01:41] about Rebecca his daughter so a few days
[1:01:43] after her mother got after her for
[1:01:45] something she sassed her now that's not
[1:01:47] Rebecca at all took off slammed the door
[1:01:49] she's 18 years old almost knocked the
[1:01:51] things off the wall went to school and I
[1:01:53] uh brother but I'm saying I ought to
[1:01:55] have seemingly just taken my belt off
[1:01:57] and followed her out in the yard and
[1:01:59] brought her back with warps around her
[1:02:04] I'm just I like to hear the quietness
[1:02:13] see but I thought wait a minute I've got
[1:02:16] to think 18 year old thoughts you see I
[1:02:18] said mother I know she started crying
[1:02:20] meaty my wife I said I know you've done
[1:02:23] all you can do I've done all I can do
[1:02:25] now if it's out of our hands we have to
[1:02:28] take the next step as some lady sweetly
[1:02:30] wrote the other day
[1:02:31] it was one of the questions here it said
[1:02:33] brother Branham you're not the Messiah
[1:02:35] are you I said no ma'am she said we
[1:02:37] believe you to be our Shepherd but
[1:02:39] you're always pointing us to the great
[1:02:40] Shepherd I said that's right that's
[1:02:42] right I said well look honey now you've
[1:02:45] done he's saying to his wife now honey
[1:02:46] you've got to listen to me it's hard for
[1:02:49] you to do this I'm your husband but
[1:02:51] people drive across the nation and
[1:02:52] around the world just for a few words of
[1:02:54] advice from me now I talked to her the
[1:02:56] other day and she just walked away from
[1:02:58] me his wife said I tried to talk to
[1:03:00] Becca the other day
[1:03:01] she just walked away from me
[1:03:06] um now Becky never did do that to me and
[1:03:08] when her mother said something about it
[1:03:10] she slammed the door and said you expect
[1:03:12] me to sit here and be in a Wallflower
[1:03:14] all my life because they were concerned
[1:03:16] about her going over to the friend's
[1:03:17] house playing the wrong kind of music on
[1:03:18] the piano boogie woogie music and
[1:03:21] brother Brown says I don't want you
[1:03:22] going over there anymore and she got
[1:03:24] real mad about it and then she just
[1:03:26] slams the door and says you just expect
[1:03:27] me to sit here and be a Wallflower all
[1:03:29] my life and blaming she slammed the door
[1:03:31] and went out that was the devil
[1:03:36] it's the devil it's the devil on you
[1:03:38] when you act that way
[1:03:39] parents
[1:03:41] it's the devil but there's no
[1:03:43] instruction here to go and say you
[1:03:45] demon-possessed woman
[1:03:50] he's adjusted himself to the time of
[1:03:52] life and divine love if it's ministered
[1:03:55] with understanding and trying to find
[1:03:57] truth will destroy demon power
[1:04:03] but it needs to have understanding with
[1:04:05] it don't compromise but it's there's the
[1:04:08] administration of it
[1:04:11] she slammed the door she said and so
[1:04:13] that was the devil I remember the first
[1:04:15] two years of her life she cried we go
[1:04:17] into a restaurant and eat I walk her in
[1:04:18] the street she was a baby and then she'd
[1:04:20] walk out just cried and cried all the
[1:04:22] time Rebecca and one day everybody in
[1:04:23] Canada cried all night I couldn't rest
[1:04:25] and everything staying there and
[1:04:26] something said to me it's the devil
[1:04:27] getting at your ministry I said hand me
[1:04:29] that baby and I said Satan in the name
[1:04:30] of Jesus Christ you take your hands off
[1:04:32] of her and she stopped right then and
[1:04:34] never cried no more she's the quietest
[1:04:35] kid I've got from that very hour it was
[1:04:38] gone you say so you have to have that in
[1:04:40] you though before you can do it and when
[1:04:42] she started that and back doing this and
[1:04:45] I took media about an hour he just took
[1:04:47] an hour with his wife just to talk about
[1:04:48] this
[1:04:50] I said midi take your hands off of it
[1:04:53] she goes me that's my kid I said it it's
[1:04:56] mine too all right I said if she was
[1:04:59] dying this morning you'd have to commit
[1:05:00] her to God for her
[1:05:02] Eternal destination
[1:05:04] why can't we commit her to God now for
[1:05:06] our Earthly Journey
[1:05:08] and she said well that's my kid I said
[1:05:10] it's mine too now see me not say nothing
[1:05:13] to her and media's going and I'm trying
[1:05:16] to interpret this here
[1:05:18] media is saying me not saying nothing to
[1:05:21] her and I said I never said that
[1:05:23] will quit scolding her and just advise
[1:05:26] her she needs a buddy and you're the one
[1:05:29] to be her buddy you and I we're her
[1:05:31] parents these kids today need a buddy if
[1:05:34] they had a mother and father would stay
[1:05:36] home and take care of them instead of
[1:05:37] out here in the bar room running around
[1:05:39] all night things like that we wouldn't
[1:05:40] have the juvenile delinquency somebody
[1:05:42] needs to love them somebody needs to be
[1:05:45] with him parenting takes a lot of love
[1:05:47] and time with them
[1:05:52] that's why the best case scenario is
[1:05:54] though the wife to be home with her
[1:05:57] husband not every time that can happen
[1:05:59] because of finances but if it can happen
[1:06:01] I love the young men that come up here
[1:06:03] and says I'm trying to get a trade or a
[1:06:05] degree because I want my my wife to be
[1:06:07] home with my children when I get married
[1:06:09] I say God bless you young men whoever's
[1:06:11] made that resolve because this is a very
[1:06:13] expensive world to live in in most
[1:06:14] situations the wife has to work
[1:06:16] but all the user are thinking that I
[1:06:18] just like the little extra money and the
[1:06:20] young kids at home you better pray about
[1:06:22] that
[1:06:27] you have to you have to do it sometimes
[1:06:28] but here he's saying
[1:06:31] if the mothers and fathers would stay
[1:06:32] home and take care of their children and
[1:06:34] give them love they got away from the
[1:06:35] Bible they went to church and they got
[1:06:37] Bunko games and everything else trying
[1:06:39] to polish up and make it Satan's grounds
[1:06:44] so so then he says
[1:06:46] we got uh
[1:06:49] let me just skip there I forgot to edit
[1:06:50] these so there we there we got down on
[1:06:54] our knees and committed her to God I
[1:06:56] said I know she's 18 years old she will
[1:06:59] be in a few days and a girl at age will
[1:07:01] think about boyfriends and we've kept
[1:07:03] her in I never wanted to see her married
[1:07:05] I wanted to put her in the office and do
[1:07:07] work I wanted to see her filled with the
[1:07:09] spirit and live like that just put her
[1:07:11] in the office
[1:07:12] keep the guys away from her
[1:07:14] every father thinks that
[1:07:17] well we we all wanted that she said well
[1:07:20] we can't do that she just won't listen
[1:07:22] to it I said wait a minute we've raised
[1:07:24] her all we can now put her in the hands
[1:07:27] of God commit her and hands of God and I
[1:07:29] said then when she does anything say
[1:07:32] Becky darling mother don't want you to
[1:07:34] do that but I'm your pal I'll stick by
[1:07:36] you see let her know that you love her
[1:07:39] she's going to get somebody to love her
[1:07:44] she's going to get somebody to
[1:07:45] understand her
[1:07:47] she's going to find some friend that
[1:07:49] they listen to me
[1:07:51] some stranger that they'll bear their
[1:07:53] heart to should never happen
[1:07:56] sometimes it's because they don't have
[1:07:58] an openness from a parent they hear them
[1:07:59] out
[1:08:00] there's no relationship there's no
[1:08:02] connection of a heart I said it years
[1:08:04] ago I made preach I may preach the word
[1:08:06] whatever I do but the greatest thing
[1:08:09] that I want in this life is a
[1:08:11] relationship with my God and know the
[1:08:14] hearts of my children
[1:08:15] my wife
[1:08:17] we may not agree but I know their hearts
[1:08:20] and they know my heart and we're
[1:08:22] connected
[1:08:24] that's my goal
[1:08:27] she's going to get somebody to love her
[1:08:29] and I'm going to I have a lot here but
[1:08:31] I'm going to close on this because I
[1:08:32] think
[1:08:33] this is a good place to
[1:08:36] wrap it up
[1:08:38] she's going to get somebody to love her
[1:08:39] and it might be the wrong woman that
[1:08:41] loves her I said you be the woman that
[1:08:43] does a loving
[1:08:46] I said honey that sounds kind of crude
[1:08:49] but people come everywhere in set in
[1:08:51] personal interviews and things I said
[1:08:52] I'm so common as a dad I become common
[1:08:55] to her we're common to one another
[1:08:56] because we're husband and wife but we we
[1:08:58] will but we never let that happen you
[1:09:01] must remember this is in the name of the
[1:09:03] Lord so she said all right we got down
[1:09:05] we committed to God said we take our
[1:09:07] hands off it and the rest of the story
[1:09:09] is when they handled her that way she
[1:09:11] didn't go over to the other girl's house
[1:09:13] anymore she made the choice Mom and Mom
[1:09:15] and Dad prayed for me and I was being
[1:09:17] real bad I was being she's telling
[1:09:19] another friend this I was being wild I
[1:09:21] was being real bad mom and dad said they
[1:09:23] love me if you want to go over there you
[1:09:24] go but we disagree with you going
[1:09:26] whatever you want to do and she stopped
[1:09:28] going
[1:09:30] understanding
[1:09:32] understanding love
[1:09:35] Divine love
[1:09:37] brings a seeking of Truth
[1:09:41] and is seeking of understanding
[1:09:49] amen
[1:09:57] I've preached on the Joshua commission
[1:09:59] I'm closing now I preached on the Joshua
[1:10:02] commission and that was the transition
[1:10:04] that happened in that whole 40 years in
[1:10:06] the wilderness under a prophet under the
[1:10:08] cloud we read in the scripture
[1:10:10] and then all that generation passed and
[1:10:13] they couldn't go into the promised land
[1:10:14] but to Joshua and Caleb
[1:10:16] were commissioned
[1:10:18] to take the people into their land this
[1:10:20] has spiritually happened in the message
[1:10:23] okay
[1:10:24] and that is that there's a job there's a
[1:10:26] Moses Commission
[1:10:28] but then Joshua chapter 1 says Moses my
[1:10:30] servant is dead
[1:10:32] and the next verse Joshua take up and
[1:10:34] take the people into the promised land
[1:10:35] we've seen that transition and what that
[1:10:38] was is that now they wouldn't be little
[1:10:40] babies in the wilderness and waiting for
[1:10:42] Moses to do something may it Moses to do
[1:10:45] another miracle we need another miracle
[1:10:46] they grew up into an adoption in their
[1:10:49] Ephesians to say you can't wait around
[1:10:52] for God to do a miracle you got to take
[1:10:54] up your sword and go take the enemies
[1:10:56] the land back from the enemy that is
[1:10:57] yours now every individual under this
[1:11:00] Joshua commission should take the word
[1:11:02] that's being preached to them and the
[1:11:03] word that you're right and stand up
[1:11:05] against him and say I'm taking all of my
[1:11:07] land
[1:11:08] that's what we're in right now and and
[1:11:10] for 35 years I read this the other day I
[1:11:13] don't know if you ever caught it 35
[1:11:15] years they fought together all the
[1:11:18] tribes together against the enemy for 35
[1:11:21] years under Joshua and then he starts
[1:11:23] getting old he said there's more land to
[1:11:25] possess they took then they went and
[1:11:26] took that he says describe the land they
[1:11:29] described it so everybody knew this is
[1:11:30] exactly what we need to go take to me
[1:11:32] that's the ministry today getting very
[1:11:35] practical very Down to Earth being very
[1:11:37] specific what land belongs to you as a
[1:11:39] Christian
[1:11:41] if you're under a preacher a minister
[1:11:42] like that not just Evangelistic all the
[1:11:46] time but somebody he was describing your
[1:11:48] land to you and then you leave this
[1:11:49] church and you go get it
[1:11:51] that's the type of ministry to be under
[1:11:54] he said thank God for that it's specific
[1:11:56] it's practical it's it's in your face
[1:11:58] sometimes see that's why I'm down here
[1:12:00] right in your face
[1:12:04] but it's the Joshua commission 35 years
[1:12:07] they fought with one another against the
[1:12:10] enemy and then there were two and a half
[1:12:12] tribes
[1:12:13] that had agreed with Joshua when they
[1:12:15] first come over can we make an agreement
[1:12:18] when we fight for you and get all your
[1:12:19] land we want to come back across Jordan
[1:12:21] we'd rather stay here and Joshua agreed
[1:12:23] to it when we're done fighting when
[1:12:25] we're almost done fighting you can go
[1:12:26] back well it come to the place they took
[1:12:27] the land and so now they two and a half
[1:12:29] tries it's time for us to go back well
[1:12:31] they headed back and this is after 35
[1:12:33] years of fighting with one another
[1:12:35] against the enemy they come to the
[1:12:37] Jordan where they had crossed and they
[1:12:39] said we're going to build an altar here
[1:12:40] okay so they start building up an altar
[1:12:43] and back however many miles away the
[1:12:46] rest of the children of tribes here
[1:12:47] they're building an altar that was a sin
[1:12:49] that was wrong to build an altar other
[1:12:51] than the one that would be among them
[1:12:53] they're building another thing and and
[1:12:56] so now when they hear they're building
[1:12:58] an altar they they start to take up
[1:13:01] their swords and they're going to go
[1:13:03] down to Jordan and kill their brothers
[1:13:04] for this altar they're building
[1:13:08] and they're headed down there and the
[1:13:10] brothers that are two and a half tribes
[1:13:12] saying send back word to them
[1:13:14] if if we're building another altar
[1:13:17] that's the altar then we need to be
[1:13:19] killed that's not our purpose that's not
[1:13:21] our motive listen to our motive we just
[1:13:24] wanted to build a memorial so that when
[1:13:26] your children are older and our children
[1:13:28] are over they can look at this as a
[1:13:30] memorial and go back to what God did
[1:13:31] we're not building another altar to
[1:13:33] replace the the right one we're just
[1:13:35] building a memorial and those Brothers
[1:13:37] completely misunderstood their motives
[1:13:42] so much so that they're ready to take
[1:13:44] their swords for the first time in 35
[1:13:47] years they're picking up Swords to go
[1:13:49] kill their brothers instead of the enemy
[1:13:53] all because of what they missed
[1:13:55] understood
[1:13:58] what happened in the motives
[1:14:00] now what needed to happen before they
[1:14:02] took up their weapons they needed to say
[1:14:05] what are you guys doing
[1:14:07] what's the purpose in it if they had
[1:14:09] enough respect to sit down like adults
[1:14:15] before they picked up a weapon against
[1:14:17] one another
[1:14:19] but this is the end of our Joshua
[1:14:21] commission that the last thing I just
[1:14:24] excuse me friends I don't want to
[1:14:25] prophesy I don't want to but you watch
[1:14:27] what's taken place sometimes in our own
[1:14:29] ranks
[1:14:30] and the fighting and the taking shots
[1:14:33] across the pulpit at another preacher
[1:14:36] over here
[1:14:40] and undermining each local church
[1:14:43] Bishops over so many churches at
[1:14:45] churches
[1:14:48] and you don't have a clue what that
[1:14:49] brother is being led to do over there
[1:14:51] but you mistreat misread what he's doing
[1:14:53] you lash out against the pulpit against
[1:14:55] what they're doing over there help us
[1:14:57] preachers not to do that
[1:15:01] can I get more amens I mean just this is
[1:15:03] this has got to stop this has to stop
[1:15:07] it's misunderstandings many times
[1:15:11] when is divine love going to really take
[1:15:13] over not preaching a sermon on it but we
[1:15:16] see the fruits of it taking place
[1:15:20] take shots here and shots there and it's
[1:15:22] just understanding undermines the local
[1:15:23] church because God may be doing a unique
[1:15:25] thing in a local church
[1:15:27] sometimes a unique thing takes place and
[1:15:29] they start to say oh you know this is
[1:15:32] not happening anywhere else you need to
[1:15:33] come to this church that's wrong too
[1:15:36] God can do a unique thing in that local
[1:15:38] assembly I have the authority from God
[1:15:41] to teach and preach what I preach to
[1:15:43] this assembly I don't have to be
[1:15:44] influenced by other ministers to preach
[1:15:46] what they're preaching
[1:15:48] right
[1:15:49] now if I'm off the word you have a
[1:15:51] responsibility to come and correct me if
[1:15:53] I'm off the word and if I'm living in
[1:15:55] sin you have a responsibility to bring
[1:15:57] it to the church and if I'm going to
[1:15:59] continue sin to take me out of this
[1:16:00] office I've disrespected it
[1:16:03] but the main thing is am I preaching the
[1:16:05] word and if I'm not then you have to
[1:16:07] make a decision whether to go we get
[1:16:08] another Pastor whatever can you say Amen
[1:16:10] but if I'm on the word of God the manner
[1:16:13] the approach and where we're leading the
[1:16:14] sheep for this assembly don't get on
[1:16:16] there online and compare yourself to
[1:16:18] other assemblies well I'm going to
[1:16:20] listen to this one today and I'm going
[1:16:21] to sit back and listen to this one and
[1:16:22] this it should all really be in
[1:16:25] continuity if you're listening to the
[1:16:26] right Ministries
[1:16:28] it should be the Holy Ghost saying
[1:16:31] basically the same thing
[1:16:34] but if I want to do a teaching and do
[1:16:36] something very different than another
[1:16:37] Minister would do I think we should stop
[1:16:39] categorizing and and criticizing what
[1:16:43] the local assembly is doing with a
[1:16:44] simple humble Pastor that's just leading
[1:16:46] his flock
[1:16:49] and they were ready to take up weapons
[1:16:51] because they misunderstood their
[1:16:53] brothers
[1:16:54] they shouldn't have done that but guess
[1:16:56] what
[1:16:57] the positive things is when they sent
[1:16:59] backward and said Brothers Listen we're
[1:17:02] not doing this this is our motive the
[1:17:04] brothers back there said now we
[1:17:07] understand
[1:17:08] praise the lord we go for that guess
[1:17:11] what happened
[1:17:12] you know what that is
[1:17:14] it was a victory in Divine love
[1:17:18] that's the last of Joshua
[1:17:22] the last of Joshua is a victory in
[1:17:25] Divine love amongst the brothers
[1:17:27] come on folks let's praise God if it's
[1:17:30] in the Bible it's going to happen today
[1:17:31] again
[1:17:35] there was a victory in Divine love there
[1:17:38] was a victory in Divine understanding
[1:17:40] they understood one another laid their
[1:17:43] weapons down
[1:17:44] blessed be the name of the Lord may we
[1:17:47] understand one another with may the Lord
[1:17:49] Divine love of God seek truth before we
[1:17:52] draw a conclusion seek truth seek
[1:17:54] understanding with the brothers with
[1:17:56] sisters with pastors with God everyone
[1:17:59] let that love seek understanding
[1:18:02] husbands seek understanding with your
[1:18:05] wives wives seek understanding with your
[1:18:07] husbands parents seek understanding and
[1:18:10] live by mature understanding
[1:18:13] for your children your teenagers and let
[1:18:16] there be like in This Book of John let
[1:18:18] there be a victory how many know it's
[1:18:20] been prophesied
[1:18:22] she will have a victory in Divine love
[1:18:25] she will have a victory of understanding
[1:18:27] she have a victory of mature love this
[1:18:31] is where the message is taking us
[1:18:33] not back to holding grudges for years
[1:18:36] not back to jumping from church to
[1:18:39] church and you didn't understand the
[1:18:42] full situation not back to Old Fighters
[1:18:45] and that's what brother Brown called the
[1:18:47] old men that were under Moses they were
[1:18:49] the old Fighters all they knew to do was
[1:18:51] to fight to fight to fight and we're not
[1:18:54] supposed to be fighting one another
[1:18:55] we're supposed to be fighting the enemy
[1:18:58] glory be to God God has given us the
[1:19:01] victory can you say Amen
[1:19:05] praise the Lord
[1:19:06] God will give us a victory in Divine
[1:19:10] love it's already happening in a lot of
[1:19:12] things I see maturity in people trying
[1:19:14] to seek understanding first before they
[1:19:17] make a judgment call
[1:19:18] trying to meet with somebody and being
[1:19:20] adults about it trying trying trying
[1:19:22] doing out of divine love functioning out
[1:19:25] of divine love that's my heart friends
[1:19:27] and let it take place in me first that's
[1:19:29] what my prayer is amen Oh we must fight
[1:19:32] be brave against all evil let's stand
