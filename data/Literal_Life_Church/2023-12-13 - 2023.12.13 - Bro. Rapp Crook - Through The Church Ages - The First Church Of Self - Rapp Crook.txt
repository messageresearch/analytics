here we're grateful for the safe trips up and everything and good to be in a nice warm building um perhaps while we're standing we can open up up in our Bibles to the Book of Revelation chapter 3 and we're in the last couple uh Services finishing up uh this little series we've done through the uh Church age book so we're excited to be now uh a little more in the present tense in re chapter 3 in the loudan age and we'll just start in in verse uh in verse 14 let's see here and then the angel of the Church of the Lans write these things Seth amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God and since we started we've kind of looked at the how God identifies himself to each church and how the characteristics that the Accents in this introduction that has a direct bearing or connection with the uh trials and the struggles and the challenges of the particular particular age and here God's identifying himself as the the amen he has the last word and many times uh the devil likes to have the last word and um we can if you're having a discussion or an argument the other person oh you just there's this tendency you want to get the last word in well here we have the Assurance after all the Gentile dispensation is over God will have the last word the devil's not going to uh pull one over on him God has the last word he's faithful he's true the beginning of the creation of God and um it it's continuing Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God but it was just the beginning he wanted to be born not just in virgin born flesh you wanted to be born in our flesh it was just the beginning of that verse 15 I Know Thy works that while Thou Art neither cold nor hot I would that you would be cold or hot so then because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I'm rich increased with goods and have need of nothing yet know not Thou Art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich with with true riches then and white rment that th mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice the chances of that voice being heard seems quite slim he's knocking knocking knocking but if any man just happens to hear the knock let alone my voice I'll come into him and S with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and him set sat down with my father and his throne he hath an ear let them hear what the spirit Seth unto the churches in this evening we're going to start talking about this laan church let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness and your grace to us Lord I Thank you again Lord that for the abil the opportunity and the freedom to gather here in a a warm building and a and a peaceful country Lord where War ravages other places and the um just let talking with uh dad on the way up uh um my brother in Israel there they go to church and there might be Rockets firing overhead but they are just going about their life in a new kind of normal I'm glad that we didn't have that here today we're thankful Lord for that I do pray Lord for for the situation in Israel Lord that you would watch over your people there Lord father I pray for the situation in Ukraine father we're um heading into a second winter now Lord I pray that youd take care of your children Lord Lord just watch over them we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you all you may be seated just want to kind of get a a bit of a heading into the little bit of review from last uh um service um we looked how at the turn of the centuy the 1800s um phased to the 1900s uh after the Civil War there was a there was a Second Great Awakening that went across United States um DL Moody and others just across the country and the and mighty works of God were being done but as those Revival fires kind of petered out as we headed near the toward the turn of the century people in the established churches realized hey we've experienced the Revival fires before and they've died down and we we want them back what do we need to do to get the Revival fires to come back and there there was a general sense around the turn of the century that yeah what do we need to do to to get that back and like we said in 1896 a man named Charles Sheldon wrote this book in his steps which we talked about shared a little bit last two weeks ago about the little summary of the book but was an an encouragement to to Christians to to reach out in their communities uh to show the love of Christ to the to to to the needy and all good things um but um what this end what this end up gradually morphing into was a social gospel movement where and all these things are good we're supposed to care for a fellow man if somebody comes and and to our to our to our door and they have need or we meet them and we witness to them and they see they don't even have food don't have this we just say God bless you I've given you I fed your soul you should be happy and grateful now James says you're being a hypocrite we're supposed to care for our fellow man but um if we're just doing all the things caring for their physical needs and never looking at their spiritual needs we're really deceiving ourselves and them that we're doing anything of Eternal value and because um God cares about body but he also cares about uh the soul and the Bible's good news is much more than a social gospel and it almost cheapens it to say that we're just supposed to be kind to our neighbor and help them so they can have a better life in this world that's not the call of the Gospel that's certainly a part of it to to to to uh to be to love our neighbor as ourselves but we want to bring them to to Christ that's the ultimate thing and what this kind of brought to the church was we we we we sense an absence of Christ's presence so we need to be doing more works we need to be working to to try to get that back and we uh and our works are inqu to save ourselves much less somebody else what we saw last time was just at 1896 this book comes out just 10 years later God comes with the this this open door to a continued Revival and that was the isusa Street Revival there in Los Angeles California and he just it was just an outpouring of the holy spirit that went all over the country went around the world and that changed lives much more than a social gospel did so this is where we were looking um last week that as as the Revival fires kind of petered out at the turn of the century um God provided an emergency exit from this uh this cage of denominationalism because really what happened these uh these Church systems that God had used the Wesley and church system these other ones God had used them but they're not really nearly alive today as they they had been we looked at just a quoting from of a magazine from November remember of just a month ago the title was emergency exit the Wesleyan churches are are are are closing and some of the discussion talked about where do we go where do we go started back in 1972 when the church was discussing homosexuality for the for the for the clergy and this was Wesley's church the church was the church was becoming a cage that now people need to want to try to get out of but God had supplied this open door to escape from this cage of denomination nationalism that was the Revival by the Holy Spirit let's see here I'm off order in the notes on page one we just um um then down down in the middle from the Philadelphia and church age Brother brandom Talks at the end of the at the turn of the century the church denomination that gone back to education back to works again again the social kind of thing they'd gone back but but after the great denomination system had been set up Jesus set up the open door and this was he this is a place for them to enter into before they would go into the loudy and age and it's so important to catch the spirit for what God wants to do now amen and not just be trying to catch an anointing of something that's good to do I've been reading this week in the message trying to do God service without it being his will King David he had the vision to bring the Ark of the Covenant into Jerusalem see this seems like a really good thing to do he was completely sincere he wasn't trying to displease God he wasn't trying to sin he wanted to do something that was right yet he hadn't caught in he he hadn't caught God's anointing or the vision for that time that he was living and he ended up making a mistake and um it says brother brandham talks about um even the revivals um denominational revivals in the last uh century it was for a good purpose to bring people in the presence of God great Crusades and millions of people spent their money and put in great Crusades and churches all went together great auditoriums great things great things took place but why did It ultimately fail it's because they never knew the hour they were living in it's so important to know the time that we're living in and what we should expect for the hour that we're living in because if we're thinking man I want God to crisscross the country and just just bring thousands to the altar every service and just do that that's not the time we're living in this is a time of of of of gleaning preparing for the coming of the Lord if we get our expectations mixed up we'll be disappointed for no reason it's important to know the time that we're living in and he he continues oh brother listen what time are we living in what's the age what's the hour that we're in it's not time for these things that they're talking about that's past judgment's at hand now he talks we need to catch the Revelation he talks about this this Vision brother brandom had of the bride and trying to keep her in Step but what I want to want to emphasize it's important to see what is God trying to do now and catch the vision for that because if we can catch that Vision Isaiah 4031 says he shall run and not be weary you shall walk and not faint they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength we renew our strength when we're when we're anointed by his anointing when we've caught what he's doing we just kind of get in the flow and it carries us on but if we're trying to do good things on our own we'll be working really really hard and we might achieve some things but it's so much easier if we can catch the Winds of the spirit and go as he's moving at that time so as we're looking at the lysan church tonight this is a this is a very familiar passage of scripture and they probably won't be telling us anything that we haven't heard before but I just want to as we read the description that we see in Revelation 3 here I just want to highlight various characteristics of this laan church and we recognize that this is the culture that we live in and we know we've been called up higher we don't have to live in this particular church that's consumed with its own business and really churchianity is church Inc I mean some of these churches they run like big businesses you've got church investment officers you've got huge employees you've got all these it's it's it's it's a huge corporation these mega churches are we we we don't we're we're not called to that however because we live in this culture culture will affect us in ways that we some often won't perceive I just pray that as we read through this this evening that we can kind of examine our own lives Lord I don't want to be picking up this trait that seems so common because it's the culture I live in we're called to live differently and the uh the first I want to look at we can just see it in Revelation 3:15 when uh when Christ speaks about this church the first thing he says is I Know Thy works this is a busy Church they're doing all kinds of works and you can kind of see this start of the of the social gospel movement and going throughout the 20th century the churches are doing all kinds of things all over the world it's a busy church and Revelation 3:15 says I Know Thy works that's how Christ knows them and when I read this I thought over to another scripture where where at at the Judgment um different servants are coming uh before the Lord and they're excited I've done this for you God I've done this for you I've done this for you God but we don't want God just to know us by our works we want him to know us because it says I Know Thy works the question is does he know us and how often is it sometimes even in the even in the marriage relationship we can get so busy going doing this good thing and doing this good thing and doing going this doing this good thing and then we have a dinner out together man what do we talk about now because we've been so busy you almost lose contact for the person you know each other's works but do we still know one another and we don't want that to be our relationship with God we're always busy doing this doing that doing that Lord I hope my works are good for you enough today because I'm doing my best aren't you appreciating it God and then sometimes we can speaking from experience you can be praying for something in your life particular blessing and you feel like you're working your tail off for the Lord and then you don't get what you were praying for it says God I've earned this I've put my time in and why is this why is this disappointment here why is this disappointment here and what he might just be saying is you've worked enough for me I don't need to know your works I want to know you would you just put this side put put these other things down and I'm going to I'll give it to you but I'm even better than that thing you want I want you to know me and that's what this church is missing out on they're so busy doing all these things and they're deceived thinking these are really good things to do because this I think that I I think this came up at the turn of the century they wanted to get the Revival back so they got doing all these good works because when you do good work it is more blessed to give than to receive Christians feel blessed when they give the unbeliever feels blessed when they give and you leave feeling like you've done a done done a good thing but it's even more blessed to receive the holy spirit of God and have your life change that's the most important thing and that's God's ultimate vision for us you just kind of Wonder as as you read this though this is a busy Church does this busy Church even know notice that Christ is no longer with them the sense of his absence is what motivated them to start doing all these works but they've gotten so busy do they even realize that Christ isn't there anymore he's outside the door and he's knocking do they even hear the knock do we even hear the knock sometimes we can get so busy doing this and that and like man just brother Paul said the other day yeah we try to have our Bible reading time in the morning if it's gotten too busy try to do it in the evening but Som we get too busy in the evening and that can get a habit after a while and he's still knocking but if we're so busy we can't even hear the knock do we hear the voice also and it's so easy it used to be if somebody asked you how you were doing the default answer it wouldn't be good it'd be fine I'm doing fine now that's not the default answer how are you doing oh been busy that's what we say and it's a completely acceptable answer but really that's not an acceptable answer I don't care what you've been doing I care about you how are you doing not all the things that you're doing but the culture affects us we don't want to be a busy church I quoted this uh uh aw toer last time but this talk about this this busy Church he says if the Holy Spirit was withdrawn from the church today 95% of what we do would go on and no one would know the difference because Church Inc is very well set up they've got layers of who's responsible for this who's responsible for that they've got an Outreach coordinator they've got the data who came and visited we can massage the data we can manipulate the data we can we can draw conclusions have to be more successful here or there and the things will go on even if the Holy Spirit weren't there 95% would go on he he says but if the Holy Spirit had been withdrawn from the New Testament Church 95% of what they did would stop and everybody would know the difference what was up in church tonight something wasn't quite right we've got to seek God because I don't want to have a I I I I don't want to go just go through the motions I don't want to be busy just having Church be part of my account be part of my schedule I want I got to meet God for church that's how the New Testament Church would have approached it if God weren't there we've got to we' we've got we've got to get serious about this they would notice it and toer says I wonder would it even be noticed today and we don't want that to describe Us by any means but Lord help us not to be busy he goes on I know your works but Thou Art neither cold nor hot I would you were cold or hot they've just been exercising they're just they've got a warm sweat that's they they they they've been working it's all he says we're warm but he says I don't want you to be lukewarm I want you to be either cold or hot you know what you can ask somebody something um um you can you can uh you can take somebody to show show them you're really interested in you maybe you've got this particular um video you watch that just really spoke to you in some way or this particular sermon you watch it was just really special to you whatever it might be or this work of art think is really cool really spoke to you and you show it to somebody and say what what do you think about it they look at it look at it interesting that's right what a non committal lukewarm answer interesting is what you say when you don't really care but you want to sound interested you want to give an unoffensive answer without committing yourself either way way that's what people yeah what do you think about the church this evening that was interesting thought interesting but does it move you no it's interesting it's really things are easy to it's easy to say interesting if you're just sitting in your chair sipping your coffee interesting interesting but if something really moves you you'll jump off wow that was fantastic that's right that is that's either you want that response or you say no that's ridiculous look at the technique he used the colors they clashed that shows you care give me either cold or hot but not interesting give me something I can respond with but so often nowadays it's indifferent right I mean Independence that's this huge class of Voters right they which way we got to have to P someone who who cares this L and I've always kind of thought Luke lukewarm you know growing up in the church you hear this talked about what does lukewarm mean well I just kind of L around looking for looking for synonyms in different ways like this and when you kind of build out the meaning it can affect us quite a bit half-hearted indecisive unresponsive double-minded apathetic wishy-washy indifferent irresolute there's no response and God lays out his word and he wants a response imagine if you get on your knee and propose and the girl says wow you're an interesting guy that's not what you want when you're laying your heart but God is doing that he's laying his heart and he was interesting and no give me something I can he said respond give me something I can work with but when I've thought about interesting sorry um lukewarm in the past is always always kind of been yeah compromising life or you're doing things you probably shouldn't be doing and just kind of not really yeah you're kind of um watering down the word in some way but i' never really thought about it the way brother Brandon speaks about it here in the here in the church age book and I'll just just share this quote and he's crying out to this last age you have the word you have more Bibles than ever you can look how how many bibles do we have on our shelves we've got our we've got our phone how many versions of the Bible you have we have the whole message there on our phone but he says you've got all of this but you're not doing anything about the word except dividing it and hacking it into pieces taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want you are not interested in living it but debating it but talking about it but discussing it sharing these ideas and this is kind of reminiscent of what Paul found on Mars Hill people gathered together to hear what the new thought was just take look at look at the news look at look what's new on my feed and say okay now I feel like I'm up to date but nothing's really moving me to take any action I'm just kind of interesting I'm just talking about it I'm debating it that ate Paul up because he is sharing this precious truth I want you to do something with it and he got frustrated I think on Mari s because a lot of people just got there to talk about it talk about it talk about it a few people were interested in living it and they left with Paul and he took them further lukewarm is just talking about it but not really caring enough to actually live it I'd never really seen it that way just continuing again the thought was you're not interested in living it but debating it I would sooner you were cold or hot now debates can get kind of hot but if we're not careful it's just hot because we want to be right instead of actually be right in our heart that's not the kind of hot that God wants I wish that you if you were cold and rejected I could stand that I might even able to respect your opinion I don't know but if you would get white hot to know its truth and live it I'd praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it I in return my must refuse to honor you I will spew you out for you nauseate me and I'd never seen luke warm in quite this way that you care enough about it because you want to live it and not just talk about it or or or debate it and um because you know what truth that's a certain thing truth demands a response anytime anytime you have an exclamation point at the end of a sentence it Demands a response it just man it's out there and Truth is is that um it's like your alarm clock in the morning it demands a response and some of us um when our when our mothers go to wake us up in the morning hopefully nearly everyone in the building is past that level but when mother comes to way except when she probably doesn't go oh sweetheart it's time to get up come on honey will you please get up now come on it's it's About Time come on come on please come on on come on no that's that's like a dot dot dot punctuation I heard about somebody a family member um um Brian bog my uh my uncle-in-law he said his dad would come in wak up in the morning if they weren't up in a few minutes he'd come in with a bowl of water and just start pouring on their head that is an exclamation point that Demands a response and that is what God does when he's saying repent the kingdom of heaven is at hand John the Baptist and saying would you please just come to the water it's not cold it's just a nice temperature would you please you'll feel so much better that's not how truth Works truth is an exclamation but repent get down there now you're going to die that is ex that is how truth works or behold the bridegroom comes go out to meet him and we hope when this is going off we respond more actively than we do with our alarm clock in the morning the bridegroom comes snooze snooze snooze no this is an exclamation point we want to go out to meet him now this is what I've lived for this is what I've been waiting for we're going to go out now that's an exclamation point however if you're just lukewarm you're just going to sit there and talk about it talk about it and that is so much different than actually living it and if we take a look at this next next uh verses 15 and 16 which we've quoted them about about the lukewarmness let's just see some of the proof of the lukewarmness we see it in verse 17 because thou sayest I am rich I am increased with Goods I have need of nothing and knowest not that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked these Lans this loudan church is monopolizing the conversation I'm going to get ahead of myself here but this is also the talking church this is the only church age that's talking this much they're saying everything that they've been doing and brother brandom says you're not interested in living it but debating it you're the talking church if you'd get white hot to know the truth and live it it'd be different but you're just talking about it talking about it that's a sign of lukewarmness and um just kind of go back to the idea that truth has this exclamation point behind it exclamation point But it Demands a response well if you have an exclamation point you really can't just say oh that's interesting it demands something more than that kind of response however the um the the the qu the culture today is more of one to kind of hold the exclamation points off and just kind of examine them with questions question question and questions can be completely legit and that's how we find out more from God by asking questions however questions can also just be a way of showing off one's own knowledge I can remember one time I when I was studying at Wittenberg um we had this um I think it was the dictator of Yugoslavia Tito his I think granddaughter had come and and she was was there speaking and that was I I was doing communist studies and I I I was there well there was one person there in the audience after she gives her address and he wanted to ask a question well after five minutes he still hadn't asked the question and my professor's like could you get to your question he was just there to ask his question show how much he knew and make himself great that's not the purpose of asking a question but that's the perhaps the loud to seean way of asking a question just showing off how much I know but that's not what real questions are about questions can also serve to downplay the significance of Truth so you have the exclamation point truth is that really so what might need another perspective on that or really we might need to wait about that what what about this what about that and it can kind of downplay how important this truth is gradually trying to hammer this exclamation point and transform it into a more convenient question mark because you know when somebody asks you a question an appropriate response would be interesting but that's not the appropriate response with to a truth claim with an exclamation point sometimes um debating just by asking questions is a Sure Fire way never to be wrong because you're never positing anything you're just questioning everything and that's kind of the culture of today and I would say this is kind of a the poster child for lukewarmness today and the pope asked a question and he just says yeah who am I to judge and that sounds wow really good he's non-judgmental that's he's got he's getting all the boxes checked for being a a politically correct pontiff but who am I to judge this is just a question and he's not really positing anything and and you've probably uh this this Pope will discuss everything everything's Up For Debate but he stands for very little except one thing he wants to save the world from climate change that is something he really wants to take care of but as far as what God really teaches what his word says what we should do yeah who am I to judge now conservatives within the Catholic Church are very wary of uh uh Pope Francis and he recently had a Cod a a meeting there in the Vatican it was a sinod on synodality which is basically a meeting for pastors to get together and talk about being pastors um and this this is a um this letter this article came from one of the men who was there um priest Raymond dusza from Canada and he says he was um lamenting that this this Pope is one who's always asking questions and giving all this uncertainty and that's he says no man is going to give his life for a question mark but he will give his life for an exclamation point it says question marks seem to litter the landscape and certainty appears to be a problem not the solution because certainty makes us uncomfortable but without truth we're only left with our own conclusions which aren't Truth worth dying for and thus aren't truths worth living for there's no purpose for living anymore if there's no certainty and I think this this article by this this priest Raymond dza says cathol do Catholics need questions no they need answers he's calling for for for certainty but I think he's he's on to something because the devil's strategies take every question then look at sorry every exclamation point look at it from every possible angle so gradually you can create a question mark behind the certainty of Truth and then gradually this becomes with more malicious intent and they'll just power that exclamation point into the ground get rid of the certainty and erect question marks in the landscape every single place so no one knows really what they stand for and if don't stand for anything a proper response is that's interesting but God wants he he has a plan for our lives he has something he wants us to to do he has a he has a purpose I think a large it's um it's symptomatic of this lack of certainty of all these question marks that there is a purpose lessness there is a there is a there is anxiety there is depression people wonder what Am I Living For and we talked last time a little bit about um about the the isms that came in during the 17 and 1800s and when you've got uh um Darwin removing any kind of special origin how could you have a how could there be a plan for your life if the beginning was completely random everything else would be random as well if you take away that beginning and you take away any kind of purpose in the future because there's no afterlife and what's so special about this anyway there isn't a there isn't a purpose that's been that's been eroded away by the devil but in truth the truth is an exclamation point there is a purpose of our life and God wants us to find it and do it and he doesn't want us to look look at truth and say Ah that's interesting want to get us up off the couch and off doing something about it but lukewarm is just willing to discuss but do very little Satan does everything he can to remove certainty beating exclamation point into the question marks he will do that in our own lives he'll do that as he he raises questions and criticisms of God's truth he will do that as we are going through trials um I think brother Paul just last Sunday was telling us about uh he was reminding us about what brother brandham said was his greatest trial when that his his wife had just passed away Sharon Rose was passing was was dying there in the basement of the hospital and he was down there and then the Devil comes up beside him and starts Whispering whispering and he says you've been preaching all over the world all over you've been having meetings you've been doing this and didn't your dad just die as you and you were you were hardly able to get there and your brother passed away as you were behind the pulpit and he all the devil was doing was asking questions is it didn't this happen didn't this happen and when something is posed as a question it seems less dangerous if some were to come out and say God doesn't care about you you wouldn't listen you wouldn't give it the time of day but when it's posed there's a question is this true that that happened that way did that really happened that way that really happened and what the devil's asking all these questions to get this sense oh oh then you say yeah that did happen that did happen that did happen therefore maybe God doesn't care care about that's what the devil's trying to draw us to this conclusion and when we interact with these questions we're almost participating in our own deception but there is certainty because and at the end of it brother brandom says everything the devil told me was true and that sense of true factual it really happened but the interpretation he put to it was completely false and that's facts and Truth are completely two different things Satan will play with the facts and create a different narrative create a different storyline that's completely wrong because we recognize the facts willing to give at the time of the day and as he's doing that he just gradually hammering every exclamation point of certainty away in her life and raising the question marks where is God and then we don't really stand for it's hard to stand for anything and then lukewarmness is more of a natural condition so we've got a a busy Church we've got the the lukewarm church and this is like I mentioned the first church we could talk about being the talking church because they're monopolizing the conversation and uh in verse um in verse 17 brother Brandon references here look at the first phrase of this verse because thou sayest see they were speaking God's right there and man if I could have a meeting with God I would just love to listen and hear what he says they're like man if I had a meeting with God I'd love to tell God all the stuff I've done for him that's what they were taking this time with it says the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece and like we said I'm rich increased with Goods have need of nothing it's like the guy on the date saying I'm sure you're quite interesting but I prefer to talk about me that's what the church is saying to God I'm sure you're quite interesting God but I've got all kinds of great things tell about me just give me an hour of your time God and you'll be blessed to hear all the things I've done for you this kind of reminded me of 2 Timothy 3 this know also in the last days perilous time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own selves it's a narcissistic age and everything this CH this talking church is saying um it's self-referential self-absorbed the church is speaking all of its own works you don't see the church saying anything what God's done for them you don't anything about the great alls sufficient atoning work that Christ paid on the cross you don't see any of that of Christ's work and the great thing in in in Hebrews Paul says that work on the cross once for all completely taken care of but this church is so busy they have to complete doing this this this this they're missing out on the greatest work it's not even in their conversation the church is speaking of its own Works rather than of Christ's works is all Aton work at Calvary it's really substituted its own programs it's talking about that more than Christ's power not only is this church too busy to notice Christ's absence but they're really monopolizing the conversation even if he were there inside the church he'd probably have a hard time getting a word in edgewise he there isn't room for him to speak and it's amazing this church as for all that's talking it's not a Praying church it's a talking church because all their they're up there in their soap box they're not s singing it's me it's me it's me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer they have no need they're just saying it's me it's me me oh Lord look all that I've done that's their song all about themselves they're not praying they all kinds of talking but they're not praying why because this age does everything it can to remove any sense of need everything is cool everything is fine you don't need anything we've got something to make you feel better here something to make you feel better here there really isn't any need and it is helplessness which none of us want that feeling of helplessness but it is helplessness that fuels our prayers if we don't feel helpless we'll solve the problems on our own we'll try to but if we feel helpless that's when we'll fall on our knees and really SE God and there was a Norwegian man named oh halby and he he wrote this book on prayer I've I've read it it's a good one I never grow weary of emphasizing our helplessness this is not loud toan loudan is emphasizing how great you are all that we've done but he says i' never grow weary of emphasizing our helplessness for it is the decisive Factor not only in our prayer life but in our whole relationship to God if we feel helpless we can be encouraged God is there to do something in our lives it might not be right away the right hand of his power for the fall preached about it might be this the mysterious working of God's left hand where he's working with us working with us but he's going to be working with us and if we feel helpless we know that God we can call out for him and he will show himself like he never has before we will leave the situation more established and certain those exclamation points will not Bend they will not break they will come out polished and stronger than ever as long as we are conscious of our helplessness we will expect nothing of ourselves and therefore bring all of our difficulties and hindrances To God In Prayer that is so important to be conscious of our helplessness if we're conscious of all the things that we can do will never come to God but if we're conscious of our helplessness then we can throw ourselves upon the Lord and see work like never before but you know what this church has no needs no prayer no praise really no awareness of Christ in their life our helplessness is what draws us to see God's hand in our life but if we if everything is great we've got the best car the best job everybody's healthy and their family we don't even look to God only when we man Lord I need you God I don't know what we're going to do would you help us God then he shows himself and we see and we value and him like never before so important so important we don't want we don't want to be this kind of church we we want to we don't want to be the talking Church we're to talk about all the things that we've done we're going to talk about what God has done and you know what praying is more than just talking praying is taking time to listen and that's hard that's hard you pray you pick up your Bible you read you wait you wait you're not thinking God I've prayed about this and it's 30 minutes further I've got to go now Lord I need my answer now we you like if we're used to Google we ask our question of Google in two milliseconds we've got our answer we can go but God he wants us to care about the answer answer as much as he cares about the answer and it's that time of waiting where we really come to care if you can get your answer in two milliseconds you're willing to rephrase the question to get a different answer in two milliseconds you really you just want to find an answer that works for you but God wants to have you to have an answer that's true and that waiting is part of the process to make sure that we are tuned in to him just like we need to be so that we'll have those the value for truth like he has the value for truth moving on to Revelation chapter 3 so because thou sayest in verse 17 I am rich and increased with Goods have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched that's a bad word wretched that you you don't hear that much anymore but what what a what a Wretched Man I am but that Paul writes that or John bunan writes that but wretched that is really bad you're in a really bad condition you think youve you're rich but no you're wretched you think you have need of nothing but you're miserable this is really like the guy who's high on his drugs and he thinks I've got everything but he can't we can see the drug addict how terrible he is that is the picture of this church completely high on drugs As Long As I Got the high I'm great and I think I've got everything I'm rich increased with Goods I don't need anything and you don't know you're wretched you think you're happy but you're miserable excuse me you're poor blind naked all of these things this is a church that's a desensitized Church and the and the the mystery here is how can you not know this he say you're rich increased with Goods have need of nothing and knowest not that you're wretched poor miserable blind naked how can you not know this but you know if you've become desensitized if you've lost your feeling you really don't it's happened so gradually the person who has lost their feeling is probably the one most unaware that they've lost the feeling and they think they can do everything just fine if I could just you could just humor me for just a moment with an example we think it could be a really easy task to peel a mandarin orange although not everybody knows the best way of peeling a mandarin orange cuz I find these around my house with a little dime sized pieces going from Dan to beers Sheba you see you can TR see exactly where this child has eaten the Mandarin orange all over the place the real connoisseur of mandin oranges will peel this thing so it's all the way around you have One Piece One Piece I think it's easy it's not that hard to do you can do it pretty easily but if you've gradually lost your sense of feeling and we can replicate this by putting oven mitts on I could peel this very easily but when I lose my sense of feeling it's quite difficult I can do my the best I can and this is the this is the the the the church who thinks we're so busy doing great things for God we we can we look at the big buildings have got the great programs I've got I can I can spend hours of your time telling you but because you gradually lose your sense of feeling you're the last one to know you've lost your sense of feeling say I can do it I can do it look but you really it takes a sitation like this to real I can't peel this thing I'm doing the very best I finally got one little piece out it takes a long time because I've lost my sense of feeling and that's what this church is like they've lost their sense of feeling thinking I can do everything I used to be able to do I'm going to do it I'm I'm going to prove it it'll take me an hour to get this thing peeled and it'll be terribly messy it's not going to work but if you would just one time have your feeling restored by the Holy Spirit where you be sensitive to his voice like you were the first time he spoke to you then it would be just so easy just to peel that thing back and keep it all at one piece it wouldn't be a messy thing but you know what when when it's just man's Works trying to please God it's a messy thing you can see exactly what the man's done you see all these little pieces of Mand and orange peel going from one side to to the other but when God does it it's just nice neat it's done it's beautiful that's what we that this church has lost their sense of feeling and we don't want that to happen to us by any means how happen Matthew 24:12 gives us a hint it says because iniquity shall abound the love of many waxes cold sin very very gradually very gradually deadens our senses so that we gradually lose the sense that I'm doing something that is actually going to be harmful to me and I tell my kids that I've used this as an example to my kids at school was a great Chaple service I sat in the very front took my shoe off took my sock off and got a sharp knife out because through all the years of basketball playing I've got a very nice siiz callus right on my on my right foot and I show I could go like this with that knife I won't feel a thing because I've lost sense there and some people are actually uh born unable to feel pain and that's called congenital insensi insensitivity to pain and that might sound wonderful but it's actually quite a dangerous situation to be in and you could say when a person loses es his ability to hear the voice of God like this loud to see in church he's on the outside of the church knocking and the Bible say If any man hear my voice if any man hears my voice if you've lost your ability to hear the voice of God that's kind of like silencing your home's fire alarms so that you will have a good rest at night and you might have good rest at night for many nights but that one night when you need your fire alarm to work and you can't hear it anymore because youve silenced them then you might have a time where you sleep so well you never wake up that's what it's like when we lose our ability to hear God's voice the ability to hear God's voice have a conscience a heart that's tendered to him is something that we should value more than anything else that is the most that's one of the most important things but people with this Con genital insensitivity to pain they can feel the difference between sharp and dull and hot and cold but they can't sense for example that they take this scalding hot coffee they can't sense that it's burning their tongue have this sense that yeah it's not cold it's not ice cubes but they can't sense that their tongue is actually being burned and injured this condition can actually lead to an accumulation of wounds over time bruises broken bones other health issues that may go undetected because you don't hear this alarm I'm in pain I'm in pain I'm in pain so you continue walking after having been on the beach and you've stepped on glass and you don't notice anything you just keep walking walking and Meanwhile your foot gets more and more injured more and more injured infection grows because you don't feel the pain we think we would love to have a world without pain we think man I'm jealous of that person's conscience because their bothers them for nothing and I get my conscience bothers about every little thing no a tender heart something very valuable and precious so um this is a this is this is a really bad condition to be in having this insensitivity to pain one of the diseases in the ancient world it wasn't well understood at the time but it was a leprosy and it was such a terrible disease because doctors now know it destroys the body's ability to sense pain and what gradually happens the muscle will weakens there'll be loss of feeling in the appendages and the person will not why do lepers sometimes have such grotesque hands such misformed hands because they've lost their sensitivity to pain here and they might be cooking around the house and have their hand there on the burner not feeling a single thing at all they've lost the ability to feel pain and that's what this accumulation of pains is what explains some of the grotesque injuries that lepers will have they might get caught they might have something get caught in their eye and we would have that sense we just kind of those tear ducts go to work it we I got some I got to get it out got to get it out they won't feel that and they'll just let that thing stay in their eye until it gets infected worse and worse and worse and that's why they'll end up going blind because they're unable to feel pain Pain's a special thing CS Le said God Whispers to us in our Pleasures he speaks in our consciences but he shouts in our pains he wants to get our attention so much he shouts in our pains and that's the very thing the devil doesn't want us to hear God's voice which is everything he can to turn down the volume on our pain so we can't hear it it's interesting that um leprosy is a type of sin in the Bible because leprosy works the very same way leprosy sin and leprosy work similarly leprosy a disease that attacks the nervous system so you your body isn't getting the messages from the brain back and forth I'm in pain that's exactly what sin does it desensitizes us so we think I'm enjoying it I'm having this pleasant experience watching this film going out with this guy listening to this music but it's actually can only enjoy it because it's gradually deadened our sense of pain and we don't we don't realize it's hurting us it's hurting us we're the devil gets us actually to enjoy the experience of being hurt by getting us to by cutting off those Messengers of pain on page four I've got a list of scriptures we can look in Malachi um this is an Old Testament example of spiritual leprosy at work on the same scal that you see on laa and you've got um in Malachi you've got I think seven different scriptures that work in parallel God makes a statement then Israel ask this question what do you mean God and it's a statement like the in Malachi 1 vers vers 2 and three God speaks to Israel I have loved you sayth the Lord yet you say wherein have you loved me what do you mean you love me God and if we translate it to our own situations it'd be like Mom or Dad tucking Us in at night saying I love you sweee and you look back what do you mean you love me Mom no you don't love me you didn't give me what I asked for Christmas you don't love me and when you look at it that way he like what is Israel saying they have no sense of what God's love is neither do we sometimes but when the but God loves when they're like so callous what do you mean you love me God I was just 70 years in Babylon how can you say you love me they've become callous they don't sense this anymore Malachi 1:7 and8 you offer polluted bread upon my Altar and you say what do you mean polluted they're supposed to give an an un unblemished lamb as a sacrifice and they're not doing that they want the unblemished lamb sell at the market to get the best price they're going to give the the lamb that's already lame to God thinking God doesn't eat my lamb anyway he's only going to be offered on the sacrifice it's a waste of a good sheep I'm going give this this this this lame one to God it's good enough for God God if it's good enough for me it better be good enough for you and this attitude you can see leprosy written all over because there's no sensitivity anymore it's all about me God I don't know where you're at but you should be more concerned about my life God they're not they've completely lost their tenderness toward God Malachi 2 you have wearied the Lord with your words kind like you have that situation with your conversation with your kids it goes on and on and on you say folks we're we'll talk about this for one more minute and then we're done what do you mean don't you have any patience Dad don't you care what I say they have no sense because say where in have we wearied him they have no sense of their own sin of their own conduct and Malachi 3:7 God says return unto me and I'll return unto you sayith the Lord but you said wherein shall we return why should we go back to Egypt why why why why why should we go back we wish we were in Egypt it was good there why would we return with you God you haven't done anything for me my life going so well I could show you all of my prayer list that nothing's happening on their God I need this I need this I need this why should I return to you it's completely leprous no sensitivity anymore to what God has done the b in the Bible leprosy is a type of sin and that is what this pryan church has like leprosy sin is a long incubation period and thanks to co we all know what an incubation period is you can have the germ you can have the V virus you can have whatever it is but it won't show up for a long long time and that incubation period is how long after contact you can still be considered to have it and show symptoms leprosy has a long incubation period you could get that bacteria and it might be years before you ever actually show symptoms of leprosy that's how it is with sin you can watch something and it just gets in your mind gets in your mind gets in your mind every now and then you'll think about it but it never comes out actually doing anything with it for you years perhaps because sin is a really long incubation period if you don't repent of that sin just want to kind of hug it let it stick around for a while it'll stick around for a nice long time it's very patient it'll wait for the perfect time to come and to come into fruition but um just kind of shows that the seemingly inconsequential decisions we make every day have a lasting impact over time our thoughts do become words gradually our words do become actions gradually those actions become habits gradually which will become our character which becomes our destiny sin is a long incubation period watch our thoughts watch our words we don't want to give the devil a handle into that but we think about this church this this desensitized Church think how could this church get into such a condition that although they're poor blind naked they're actually exalting themselves for their riches and prosperity it's a very ironic situation how does this happen and it happens because they're no longer hearing the voice of God they've lost the ability to hear God's voice they're unable to be protected by their sense of spiritual pain that ouch that we hear in our conscience is a great thing don't go past that and they hear the ouch but enough times they go past it and go on living in the pleasure of sin without realizing that those Pleasures are gradually killing them by dulling their sense of pain to them brother brand kind of tackles this question how could this happen um in a sermon called and knoweth it not and what he and he talks about how the soul he talks about Body Spirit and soul how we have an innermost man our soul where where we where where where where faith is and that's where we should that that should be our anchor our our our typo but if we're not anchored there hearing God speak and truth from our soul and we're just kind of living in our emotions then we can gradually lose the sense of actually hearing God's voice and we're not living from the inside of the inside anymore another message work his faith Express he says when it's directed from the inside from our innermost man it throws all the rest of it together that's the guidepost the control tower the inside of the inside the soul should control the spirit the spirit should control the body what leprosy does it breaks that connection so there's no clear communication anymore so you're no longer hearing that communication from the inside of the inside and just going on having a great time in the pleasures of sin he goes on to say so an outside whitewash doesn't really make any difference the religious people back there that Paul called Whited walls and so forth they were outwardly just every way a Believer they had prophecies among them everything else but the inside of the inside they weren living in faith is if the soul that disbelieves it shall die that's the reason I say people can jump up and down speak in tongues can shout like this loudan church would be doing they can lay hands on the sick heal the sick and so forth by faith all these great things they're by the spirit yet still be lost because it's not on the innermost man it's just on this realm of the spirit man on the realm of the emotions and there's no anchor there and they're living in that Realm of the emot emotions and that is completely isolating them they're no longer hearing the voice of God anymore they're just hearing what they want to hear in their emotions when you lose that sense of the voice of God your spiritual nervous system isn't working anymore and you'll be hurting yourself with actually realizing it in this message and knoweth it not he says people can live in this spirit and notice that's that Spirit man they there are are our our our emotional man our mind man they can live in this Spirit they can dance in the spirit they can be in a good atmosphere and get into it and really enjoy it they can shout in the spirit they can go to church in the spirit they can absolutely God's spirit can be moving but they just kind of get in the atmosphere and respond in the atmosphere without ever really opening their heart having a transformation on the inside and if you never goes deeper than your spirit may never actually pierces the heart you can still be lost and still enjoy a good atmosphere I can go to a basketball game and I can cheer with the best of them cheer with the best of them but if I never actually go out to the waight room and do the work and actually go and take the skills and practice and go out there and shoot with the best of them I can cheer as lot as I can get caught up in the atmosphere but I'm no better basketball player and we could actually get in the atmosphere of a service just oh we enjoy it enjoy it enjoy but if it's just the atmosphere being i' this is a great atmosphere to be in nobody's cussing me out nobody's punching me this is a good friendly place to be in but if it never goes deeper than that you can still be just as devil possessed can be because you haven't opened your heart to let that Spirit change you from the inside of the inside why you say these are good people what makes them do these things because their tie poost is on a church their anchor is a church teaching their anchor is just might what they be feeling says you remember last Sunday's sermon of the anointed ones in the last days they're anointed their second realm spirit is Anointed but that doesn't change your life I can go to the gym I can cheer with the Cleveland Cavaliers as hard as I want but that doesn't make me a better basketball player I just caught up in the atmosphere but if I actually go and I change my diet I change my routine I get exercise that will change how I am that will make me a better basketball player but not just being caught up in the atmosphere God is something much better than an atmosphere God is something much better than just doing good works of Social Gospel he wants to change us and we can think here we don't want to be just content with a nice atmosphere we don't want to be content doing good works and ah I've done a good thing today way to go that's not what we want we want to be changed from the inside of the inside where Christ identifies us he doesn't just know our works he knows us he's talked to us we've listened to him we've had Fellowship together that's so much better than just working working working for him if we want change Revelation 3:18 gives us how we can change he say I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that th mayest be truly rich in white rment that you may be clothed that the the shame of your nakedness don't appear anoint your eyes with eyes sad that you may see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen not very many people allowed to see today like rebuking and chasing I don't really like it either but that's you know a friend who is willing to tell you the truth and correct you that's a real friend and that's what God sent when he sends a prophet God didn't send a prophet is you know what it might be think it might be a good idea to get up that you know it's getting close to work them I've got a nice breakfast would you think about getting up that's not how God approaches this it's an exclamation point behold the bride who cometh go out to meet him as many as I love I rebuke and Chas him get up here you're lazy bum it's time to leave that's the kind of language that's got to get this guy out of bed and God didn't send a theologian or Professor he sent a rugged Prophet with exclamation points of truth that might be uncomfortable at times but that's what we need as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore but it doesn't end there be zealous therefore and repent and change amen let's pray this is the we've talked about the culture that we live in a lot this loudan culture where we have a busy church and it's completely acceptable just to be busy and being able to hear something and respond oh that's interesting that's almost respectable response lukewarmness has become respectable but God wants something better than that amen we don't want to just be talking about all that do focus on ourselves actually listening to what God has to say and it can be so so easy to become desensitized to God's spirit we we see so many things in the news see so many things on our news feeds it can be so desensitizing and Lord I just pray that you would help us father not to be a busy church not to be a lukewarm church but to be a church that listens and wants to change and live that live according to your word not just to talk about it but actually live that life Lord I pray that you would Lord create in us a greater care oh God that we care that your word is like our oxygen that we really want with all of our hearts Lord I pray that fellowship and communion with you that would be more of our prayer life and not just our prayer list amen Lord we pray sometimes father help me just have a good day may you all work all things good today our idea of good might be very much different from your idea of good Lord I pray that we would Lord value our our helplessness help us to be conscious of our helplessness oh God lord I can remember we've prayed for sister Sharon over the last uh six months and we hear this diagnosis oh how helpless we feel we can't do anything about this just pray and pray we're aware of that and it's so good when we aware of our need our inability to change anything that we call upon you we there is prayer there is need and there can be praise we are aware of you in our midst I thank you for that Lord I pray that you would help us restore oh Lord our sensitivity to you oh God Lord help us not to walk over our conscience every single day but to listen and value that tender heart Lord I pray that if some ways that uh that this rebuke of this laan church and this description it can fit us very easily just because it's the culture we live in Lord I pray Lord that we would buy of you that real gold Lord that we would get that reignment that isn't The Emperor's New Clothes but these are true garments of righteousness Lord I pray oh Father you would anoint our eyes with Isa that we could see in truth Lord that we would be zealous not just zealous in the emotional realm but actually repent Lord I pray oh Father you would you would change our lives father help us father to live Godly and honestly before you Lord there have been places that we've just father compromised and and not done what you've asked us to do Lord may we go back say father forgive me I should have done this or that I'm so sorry forgive me Lord when I responded this way or forgive me Lord help me to be more
