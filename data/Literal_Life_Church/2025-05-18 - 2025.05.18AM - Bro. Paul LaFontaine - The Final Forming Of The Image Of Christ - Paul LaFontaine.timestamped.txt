[8:55] from. When you stop and think about it,
[8:58] just look what the Lord has done. First
[9:01] verse. Oh, I remember way back when I
[9:06] was living in
[9:10] darkness, he shined his light around me
[9:13] so I could see my way
[9:17] out. And when the lamb rose to
[9:20] claim, I clearly saw my name. And when I
[9:26] stopped to think about it, I let out a
[9:30] great big shout.
[9:33] [Music]
[9:34] Rejoice. Look what the Lord has done.
[9:38] Look what he's done. He drove away the
[9:41] darkness at the rising of the
[9:44] sun. Oh,
[9:47] [Music]
[9:49] rejoice. Look where he's brought us
[9:51] from. Thank you, Lord. When you stop and
[9:55] think about it, just look what the Lord
[9:57] has done.
[10:00] And you know the enemy is always trying
[10:04] to keep us
[10:07] defeated. He always seems to point us to
[10:11] everything that's going wrong.
[10:15] What if we only keep our
[10:18] eyes on the message we
[10:22] supplied? The joy will begin to swell up
[10:26] and you'll be singing a glad new
[10:29] song.
[10:31] Rejoice, rejoice. Look what the Lord has
[10:35] done.
[10:35] Hallelujah. Oh, he drove away the
[10:39] darkness at the rising of the sun. Oh,
[10:43] you got to
[10:46] rejoice. Look where he's brought us
[10:49] from. Yes, Lord. When you stop and think
[10:53] about it, just look what the Lord has
[10:56] last time. Oh,

[12:05] creation. Amen. Praise the Lord. Today
[12:07] we did a little garden yesterday. I'm a
[12:11] little bit tired in body. We're both me

[25:14] All to thee my
[25:19] blessed
[25:21] Savior
[25:22] I
[25:25] surrender. Last time I surrender all. Oh
[25:31] I
[25:33] surrender all.
[25:38] Oh,
[25:39] I
[25:42] surrender
[25:45] all. Oh,
[25:47] all to thee, my
[25:52] blessed
[25:54] Savior,
[25:56] I
[25:58] surrender all.
[26:01] [Music]
[26:13] I want to dedicate this to my
[26:17] cousins. I know what it feels like to
[26:19] wake up in a
[26:21] fog. You wonder where is God through
[26:25] what I'm going
[26:26] through. God just parts the fog and said
[26:30] just trust me. That's hard. I know it's
[26:34] so
[26:35] hard. But we can't see his plan all the
[26:38] time, but we just trust what he's
[26:43] [Music]
[26:53] doing. All things work for our good.
[27:03] Sometimes we can see how they
[27:08] [Music]
[27:10] could. Struggles that
[27:13] break our hearts
[27:19] into sometimes blind us to the truth.
[27:26] [Music]
[27:28] But our father knows what's best for
[27:35] [Music]
[27:36] us. He his ways are not our
[27:43] own. But when our pathway grows
[27:48] dim and you cannot see
[27:51] [Music]
[27:53] him,
[27:55] remember you're never
[28:01] alone. Cuz God is too
[28:04] wise to be
[28:09] mistaken. And God is too good to be
[28:14] unkind.
[28:15] [Music]
[28:18] And when you don't
[28:21] understand, when you can see his
[28:25] plan, when you can trace his
[28:28] hand, trust his
[28:33] [Music]
[28:38] heart. He sees the master plan.
[28:47] He holds our
[28:49] future in his
[28:53] hands. So don't live as
[28:56] those who have no
[29:01] hope. For our hope is found in him.
[29:11] We see our
[29:13] present
[29:17] clearly, but he sees the first and the
[29:23] last.
[29:26] Like a
[29:28] tapestry, he's
[29:30] weaving you and
[29:33] me to
[29:34] someday be just like
[29:40] him. For God is too wise to be
[29:48] mistaken. And God is too good to be
[29:56] unkind. And when you don't
[30:00] understand, when you can't see his
[30:04] plan, when you can't trace his
[30:07] hand,
[30:08] trust his
[30:12] heart. He alone is
[30:15] faithful and true.
[30:21] He
[30:21] alone knows what's best for
[30:29] [Music]
[30:32] you. Cuz God is too
[30:35] wise to be
[30:40] mistaken. God is too good to be unkind.
[30:48] And when we don't
[30:50] [Music]
[30:51] understand, when we
[30:54] can't see his plan, when you can't trace
[30:58] his
[30:58] hand, trust his
[31:02] heart, we can trust his
[31:08] heart. when we
[31:11] can trace his
[31:19] hand. We can always trust his
[31:29] [Music]
[31:33] heart.
[31:38] Praise the
[31:43] Lord. His hand. We need to trust his
[31:45] heart. Praise the Lord. And when you
[31:47] know the heart of God, it changes the
[31:50] whole picture. Praise the Lord. Well,
[31:52] God bless you this morning. It's great
[31:53] to fellowship with you and be in the
[31:55] house of the Lord. I can't think of
[31:56] better times than when we spend in his
[31:58] presence. the potential and the
[32:00] expectation of what God could do in our
[32:02] lives, what he could deposit in us.
[32:05] That's pretty exciting. Praise the Lord.
[32:07] So, I just ask you to trust him and
[32:08] yield your heart today. We welcome the
[32:11] different visitors with us. The
[32:14] um Spanish people from Detroit, God
[32:16] bless you. We had a chance to be with
[32:17] you. God bless you all. And uh the

[32:44] the young people, but it's for everyone.
[32:46] Those that are young at heart as well.
[32:47] Amen. And I wasn't helping my son Gideon
[32:50] with the garden yesterday. His
[32:52] father-in-law, but his father wasn't
[32:54] helping. I did enough of that already.
[32:57] Uh and uh so but I am glad he's doing a
[33:00] garden and I'm glad his father-in-law is
[33:02] teaching them how to do it among other
[33:04] things. We appreciate that. All the
[33:06] other visitors that's with us this
[33:08] morning, uh sister Barb, God bless you.
[33:10] Good to have you with us. And we have
[33:12] bring your name before the Lord every
[33:14] now and then and your family's loss and
[33:16] uh heaven's gain but your loss. And so I
[33:19] God I pray God has a continual comfort
[33:21] to your heart during these times and God
[33:23] has been with you and continue to be
[33:25] with you. Praise the Lord. God is good
[33:27] all the time. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[33:29] Well, we'll just if you get your Bibles,
[33:31] we'll stand and read together this
[33:32] morning and spend some time in the word
[33:35] of God and trust this will be a blessing
[33:36] to you. I want to read a couple of
[33:39] places um that kind of unique that I
[33:42] found last night to go with our subject.
[33:44] and we're going to go to Philippians
[33:45] chapter 3 and we'll read that first and
[33:48] we'll go to 2 Corinthians 3. The main
[33:51] text this morning will come out of
[33:53] Psalms 27, but we'll get there just a
[33:55] little bit later. But first, let's just
[33:57] pick up these and I won't read them
[33:58] again, but I want to uh put these in
[34:01] your mind and in your heart. Philippians
[34:03] chapter 3 um verse 20 and
[34:08] 21. And I just ask you to pay attention
[34:10] to uh the word of God this morning and
[34:15] uh trust the Lord will take over in our
[34:17] service today. And we trust his heart,
[34:20] don't we? When we when we can't trace
[34:23] his hand, we trust his heart. Verse 20
[34:27] says, "For our conversation is in
[34:29] heaven." Some of these appear to be kind
[34:32] of deep things, but they're not really
[34:33] deep. Paul's trying to bring us
[34:35] something here. Conversation in the
[34:37] Bible usually means your manner of life.
[34:39] It's not just what you're saying. It's
[34:41] actually both. So our manner of life and
[34:45] our conversation, our manner of life and
[34:47] also our words, our conversation, our
[34:50] manner of life is in heaven. So it's in
[34:52] a different place. Even though we're
[34:53] here, our focus, our our our our bent,
[34:58] our our manner of life is has a focus.
[35:00] It's not an earthly focus. It's a
[35:02] heavenly focus. So our conversation is
[35:05] in heaven from whence also we look for
[35:08] the savior the Lord Jesus Christ who
[35:11] shall change our vile body. So now
[35:13] here's the body change. Who shall change
[35:15] our vile body that it may be fashioned
[35:18] or formed like unto his glorious body
[35:22] according to the working whereby he is
[35:24] able even to s subdue all things unto
[35:26] himself. So I want you to notice in two
[35:29] scriptures here before there's a body
[35:31] change before there's a rapture our
[35:33] focus and our place that we've come to
[35:36] has a heavenly focus already. So we come
[35:39] into this place before the body change
[35:42] and then the body change and while
[35:44] that's happening our bodies and our uh
[35:47] character is being formed like unto his
[35:50] glorious body. So, I want you to keep
[35:52] that thought in mind. And let's just add
[35:54] in 2 Corinthians chapter
[35:57] 3. 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and uh verse
[36:02] 15. It's good to also have my daughter
[36:04] in today. Gabriella uh married a guy,
[36:07] ran off to Washington, and uh didn't
[36:09] have any choice in the matter. Uh but
[36:12] it's always nice to have her visiting in
[36:13] town. 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse
[36:17] uh
[36:19] 15. But even unto this day, when Moses
[36:22] is read, the veil is upon their heart.
[36:25] Nevertheless, when it shall turn to the
[36:27] Lord, and it there he means Israel, when
[36:28] the nation of Israel, when they'll turn
[36:30] to the Lord, the veil shall be taken
[36:32] away. How important is it is to see the
[36:35] Lord, not just uh Bibles and words, and
[36:40] because the Jews were they had the words
[36:42] read to them, but because they had a
[36:44] veil, they couldn't see the word, right?
[36:46] But when they turn the the Lord of the
[36:49] Lord of it, and they met him personally,
[36:51] the veil gets taken away. And so, um,
[36:54] let's just finish it here. He says, uh,
[36:56] 2 Corinthians and let me finish verse
[37:01] 15.
[37:03] Um, I just want to not, okay,
[37:05] nevertheless, verse 16, when it shall
[37:07] turn to the Lord, the veil shall be
[37:09] taken away. Now, the Lord is that
[37:11] spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord
[37:12] is, there's liberty. But we all with
[37:16] open face beholding as in a glass the
[37:18] glory of the Lord are changed. So it
[37:21] brings all of us in now. We're changed
[37:24] into the same image from glory to glory
[37:28] even as by the spirit of the Lord. Amen.
[37:31] May God bless his word this morning.
[37:33] Heavenly Father, we are grateful to be
[37:36] in your house, Lord. We have enjoyed the
[37:38] songs. We have expressed our hearts to
[37:40] you, Lord, in the best way that we can.
[37:43] And Lord, now we look to you, Father, to
[37:45] come and uh present yourself to us,
[37:48] Lord. The the love for you is growing so
[37:51] much, Father. And I'm thankful for all
[37:53] that you have done, that you're doing,
[37:55] and Lord, the expectation of what you
[37:57] will do. Bless every soul that's present
[37:59] here, those listening online. I pray
[38:02] there would be a refreshment in the Holy
[38:03] Ghost. Come to each life. I pray you'll
[38:06] meet every person where they're at,
[38:08] Lord, and love them where they're at.
[38:10] Lord, may we hear from the song this
[38:12] morning and apply it to our lives that
[38:14] when we can't see and trace your hand
[38:16] that we would just trust your heart
[38:18] because Lord, we have that confidence
[38:20] today that every soul is in the palm of
[38:22] your hand and you know where we are and
[38:24] you know where we're going. So I pray,
[38:26] Father, that you'll give a vision to
[38:29] each person today of their future. Lord,
[38:31] we know our past and the devil uses our
[38:34] past to beat us up. But Lord, may we get
[38:36] a vision of the future you have for us
[38:39] and we place that in your hands by the
[38:41] anointing of the Holy Ghost in Jesus
[38:43] name. Amen. How best you may be
[38:46] seated. There's a quote from St. Martin.
[38:50] St. Martin was the church age messenger
[38:53] to the Ephesus murder Pergamus church
[38:56] age, the third one. And uh there's a
[38:58] quote I wanted to put up of him that is
[39:00] in relation to what we're speaking this
[39:02] morning. I thought it was uh really
[39:04] amazing that he has this insight back
[39:07] then early on. But he just says this.
[39:09] St. Martin says, "Allow me, brothers, to
[39:11] look toward heaven rather than at earth.
[39:15] Allow me, brothers, to look toward
[39:17] heaven rather than at earth, so that my
[39:20] spirit may set on the right course when
[39:23] the time comes for me to go on my
[39:26] journey to the Lord. I'm going to read
[39:28] it again. Allow me, brothers, to look
[39:30] toward heaven rather than on at the
[39:33] earth. So that it's he's he's expressing
[39:36] kind of like a prerequisite or a pre uh
[39:39] condition before the body change, before
[39:41] the coming of the Lord. The condition is
[39:43] is that may I set my eyes and everything
[39:46] towards heaven and get it off the earth
[39:48] and get it towards heaven first so that
[39:50] my spirit is set in the right direction.
[39:53] How many this morning I'm going to bring
[39:54] it in our terms. How many this morning
[39:56] would love to have that rapturing faith
[39:58] to be raptured? You know the promise
[40:01] right now in front of us is the rapture.
[40:02] This is the coming of the Lord. And so I
[40:04] would want to know anything that the
[40:06] scripture brings me to set me in a place
[40:09] and in a condition to be ready and set
[40:12] in the right direction for the rapture.
[40:13] That's everything to me. It's not about
[40:15] making money. Can you say amen? It's not
[40:17] about all the things of earth. That's
[40:19] fine. Uh I thank the Lord he's blessed
[40:21] us with a little funds to be able to pay
[40:22] our bills. But my focus is this promise.
[40:26] I want to get out of here. I want to see
[40:27] this rapture take place. We've been
[40:29] waiting for how long now? Two 2,000
[40:32] years that's been promised. And so I
[40:34] thought this was wonderful and I'll just
[40:35] bring it in our terms. In other words,
[40:37] what Martin is saying here is before the
[40:39] journey, he is coming into a certain
[40:42] place and that place that is setting him
[40:45] above earthly things, that place sets
[40:48] him in the faith for a body change.
[40:51] That's in my own words, words that we
[40:53] understand more because when he speaks
[40:55] of the coming of the Lord, then uh we
[40:58] know he's talking about a rapture and a
[41:00] body change. So now he has a place that
[41:03] he wants to set himself in. Goes along
[41:05] with the text of the scripture. Now last
[41:07] Sunday we preached on the final forming
[41:12] of the image of the beast. And uh I took
[41:15] some took the prophecies in Revelations
[41:17] 13 trying to post the church where we're
[41:20] at right now uh in in politics, in world
[41:23] governments, in the things that are
[41:25] happening recently in the news. And uh
[41:28] we should all be alert to realize that
[41:31] we're not where we were 20 years ago or
[41:33] 50 years ago, but things are moving
[41:35] along and there's an accumulation of
[41:37] prophecy that happens quicker as we get
[41:39] closer. And so I I titled it the forming
[41:43] of the prophecy because the image of the
[41:45] beast is supposed to be something that
[41:47] would form more and more over time. But
[41:49] in the it comes out of the United
[41:51] States, the image of unto the beast. And
[41:53] so we we I was trying to bring up the
[41:55] recent election of the pope and
[41:57] different things. We can never attach
[41:59] these things because we're not prophets
[42:00] to do that. But if we look in the
[42:02] scripture, there's there's many things
[42:04] that are conditions. And what I was
[42:07] trying to bring is that there's
[42:08] prophecies that need to be fulfilled.
[42:11] And conditions will help form the
[42:14] prophecy to bring it to pass. So the
[42:16] conditions of the world, the nations and
[42:19] the world and uh uh businessmen and what
[42:22] they're doing and trading and doing all
[42:24] this stuff and countries coming together
[42:26] in unity. This is all preparing
[42:29] conditions for one thing, for this word
[42:31] to be fulfilled because the conditions
[42:34] have to be right in order for the word
[42:36] to be fulfilled. And I was here to say
[42:39] last Sunday that that there's a quicker
[42:41] forming going on that as we see there
[42:44] has to be a tie from that beast system
[42:46] on the other side of the ocean. There
[42:48] has to be a tie to the United States.
[42:50] It's a pretty close tie when you've
[42:51] picked a pope from the United States.
[42:55] Okay? So I don't have any business
[42:56] interpreting that. But I I say safely
[42:59] there's things forming that are forming
[43:02] what? The prophecy to be fulfilled.
[43:04] Amen. the conditions. And I've re I've
[43:07] said many times that Joseph maybe didn't
[43:09] even realize why he was called all of a
[43:11] sudden to go back to his hometown of
[43:13] Bethlehem. Politics and laws changed
[43:17] overnight. And all of a sudden, Joseph
[43:19] was going, "I don't know why, honey, but
[43:21] we've got to go back and I've got to go
[43:22] back and pay my taxes and go back to the
[43:24] place I was born." So he packs up Jesus,
[43:26] packs up his family, doesn't even know
[43:28] all the reasons why, but I can tell you
[43:31] he's being positioned for Christ to be
[43:34] born. He's being positioned for the
[43:36] prophecy to take place. So do you think
[43:40] Trump and all the other ones with him
[43:41] and all the leaders of this world are
[43:44] really making their own decisions? Do
[43:46] you think they can be arrogant, say,
[43:48] "Look what I'm doing?" Because, uh, how
[43:50] should I say it? Some of them are pretty
[43:52] arrogant. Look what I'm doing. Billions
[43:56] and
[43:59] billions. I've practiced that quite a
[44:02] bit. Billions and and and taking the
[44:06] credit for it. These men are working
[44:08] according to the prophecy of God's word.
[44:12] And the events are forming into that
[44:16] image of the beast being formed from
[44:17] here in the United States. And all the
[44:19] world will wonder after the beast. Can
[44:21] you say amen? And then it has a front of
[44:24] Christianity. I don't want to get too
[44:25] much on that because that's not my
[44:26] subject today. But the conditions over
[44:28] time meet up with the fulfillment. And I
[44:31] feel there's several things that's
[44:32] happened. I I just mentioned this. We
[44:34] have not had a superman or what they
[44:37] call him a rockar type person rise to a
[44:41] prominent uh position that he's
[44:43] acknowledged around the world except for
[44:45] for a few. But this we have a business
[44:49] superman. And I'm not discrediting him
[44:51] at all as a man. And I'm just saying
[44:53] that we've never had a president rise
[44:55] that's trying to accomplish so many
[44:57] things so fast. Looks like he has a lot
[44:59] of success at it and he's becoming
[45:01] worldrenowned as being a businessman
[45:04] that's getting the job done and his name
[45:06] is upon the lips of every news
[45:08] everything. It's a prominent it's
[45:11] everybody looking. It's a everybody
[45:13] watching. It's a superman a super
[45:16] businessman that a lot of the people are
[45:18] following after. And guess what? If we
[45:22] get a Superman that's going to solve all
[45:24] of our so-called problems economically
[45:26] around the world, it only sets the
[45:29] people's hearts to get another Superman,
[45:34] somebody to rise
[45:36] in the religious realm. And not just the
[45:39] religious realm, but Christianity,
[45:42] so-called Christianity. Yeah. So you
[45:45] watch this Superman rise as he
[45:47] acknowledged around the world and he's
[45:49] he's affecting everything around the
[45:52] world. Just his presence walking in the
[45:54] room. That really says something because
[45:55] we're going to have another religious
[45:57] Superman rise and become become the
[46:00] incarnate antichrist. This is all
[46:01] scripture. Now this superman's making
[46:04] covenants and making trade deals and
[46:06] negotiating because he's a professional
[46:08] negotiator. And so now that's something
[46:11] significant for the other religious
[46:13] superman because even the book of Daniel
[46:15] says he'll form a contract with Israel
[46:18] that he'll break within days. So it's
[46:21] all about making contract, making
[46:23] negotiations and the Superman is going
[46:26] to make it. I'm only saying this to say
[46:29] the hour is short
[46:32] and things are forming into the prophecy
[46:35] being fulfilled. Can you say amen?
[46:37] But the forming of an image to the beast
[46:39] in the United States is not the only
[46:41] prophesi prophecy that's forming right
[46:44] now. Let's switch it over to our side.
[46:47] Let's switch it over to another prophecy
[46:49] that's important to us. Where if they're
[46:51] being formed in their hearts to accept
[46:53] the image of the beast and to swallow
[46:56] it, there's a people of God being formed
[46:59] to come into the prophecy of the
[47:02] rapture.
[47:04] And it's a great secret working go going
[47:06] on. But I'm telling you, if he's forming
[47:08] that to come to pass real soon, he's
[47:10] forming a bride. He's forming a people.
[47:13] Can you say amen? And they're being
[47:15] formed into what? This prophecy of the
[47:17] rapture.
[47:20] It's not even an event. I said it a few
[47:21] weeks ago. It's not an event. The
[47:23] rapture. I am the event. You are the
[47:26] event. It's not something we're looking.
[47:29] No, no. It's we're going to fulfill this
[47:30] prophecy. But you have to be formed by
[47:33] conditions to come into that place.
[47:37] And despite yourself, sometimes if we
[47:40] just yield to the Lord, God will form
[47:43] you into a rapturing faith
[47:46] and a rapturing condition. How many
[47:50] would raise your hand and say, "That's
[47:51] where I want to be right there. Whatever
[47:54] God's got to do to form me into meeting
[47:57] that prophecy, God, may you do it." Yes.
[48:02] Praise the Lord.
[48:03] So, we're being formed uh first of all
[48:07] into the image of Christ. How many
[48:09] believe that? So, this today is the fi
[48:11] final forming of the image of Christ.
[48:13] Last Sunday was the final forming of the
[48:15] image of the beast. But this is the
[48:17] final forming into the bride coming into
[48:19] the image of Christ. And that's
[48:21] unfolding almost daily. And it should
[48:24] tell us that God is doing a work within
[48:26] us. And God is fashioning us. God is
[48:29] forming us. Even the Bible says these
[48:31] vile bodies are being formed to uh like
[48:34] his own glorious body. And so uh if you
[48:37] go back to the garden of Eden, there was
[48:39] a beast, a serpent bearing the image of
[48:42] Satan. In the garden of Eden, there came
[48:45] a a beast which was called the serpent
[48:48] and he was bearing the image of Satan.
[48:50] That beast was bearing the image of
[48:52] Satan. Then there was a son of God,
[48:54] Adam, that that God's son was made in
[48:57] the image of God. Everybody understand
[48:59] that? So we have a a a vessel there of
[49:03] the beast or the serpent bearing the
[49:05] image of Satan. And we have a son of God
[49:08] that we know is bearing the image of
[49:10] God. He was made in the image of God.
[49:12] And so then speed 6,000 years now to the
[49:16] end. At the end, there's only two things
[49:18] being formed right now. And that's an
[49:20] image under the beast and the image
[49:22] under Christ or images of Christ in his
[49:25] sons and daughters. Conditions become
[49:28] honed in to help both of these images
[49:31] form
[49:35] and we're getting closer and closer and
[49:38] the bride is being formed by this word
[49:40] in manifested sons of God. It didn't
[49:43] happen overnight. It's taken many, many
[49:45] years, but I believe we are on the final
[49:48] forming of this bride coming into the
[49:51] image of Christ.
[49:53] There will be a rapture. Can you say
[49:55] amen? If you don't get anything else,
[49:58] there will be a rapture because the
[49:59] Bible said there will be a rapture. And
[50:01] that rapture isn't an event. That
[50:03] rapture is a people. And there will be a
[50:06] people despite our weaknesses, despite
[50:09] all that we've been through, despite our
[50:11] past. If we get into this rapture, it'll
[50:13] be by his grace, not our works. It'll be
[50:17] God provided rapturing faith to us and
[50:20] we latch on to it. And it won't be
[50:22] because of our works. It'll be in
[50:23] rapturing grace. One place, Brother
[50:25] Brand refers to it, rapturing grace. I'm
[50:27] glad it's called that because I don't
[50:29] work my way into a rapture. His grace
[50:32] provides a way and I'm gonna be a part
[50:35] of
[50:36] it. If it's in the morning or if it's
[50:39] next year, I'm going to be a part of
[50:41] that rapture. I'm being formed into
[50:43] that. Somebody ought to shout, "Praise
[50:45] the Lord. I'm going to be there."
[50:49] That promise is mine. It needs to be
[50:51] yours.
[50:54] We are in the final forming. Now, let me
[50:56] say something. In the early years of
[50:59] this message, and and I don't know, I
[51:01] might have to edit this out. We'll see.
[51:03] But it's just us here, right? and and
[51:06] everybody internationally watching the
[51:09] internet. In the early years of the
[51:13] message, it was all about getting the
[51:16] outside right.
[51:21] And it's not such a bad thing, but it
[51:24] turns out to be a bad thing because what
[51:26] it really was is that we really didn't
[51:28] see what God had given us. We didn't see
[51:30] it in all of its glory. There were still
[51:32] some veils over us. So, we're looking at
[51:35] the message he sent us in in the last
[51:37] days through Malachi 4:5. We're looking
[51:40] at it through baby eyes or immature
[51:42] eyes. And there's nothing worse than
[51:45] taking something so precious that comes
[51:47] from God and putting it in the hands of
[51:50] immature babies
[51:52] because we're not going to handle it
[51:54] right. We're not going to get it right.
[51:56] We're not going to see it right. And so,
[51:59] because of that, we're going to
[52:00] administer it wrong. I'm talking about
[52:01] preachers
[52:03] especially nothing worse than the word
[52:05] being in the hands of an immature
[52:06] preacher.
[52:08] So in the early days of this message and
[52:11] I can safely say this because I
[52:12] privileged been privileged to grow up in
[52:14] it seen a lot of stuff. I'm not going to
[52:16] talk about the stuff but it's it's it's
[52:19] it was all about getting the outside
[52:21] right. taking the message in the hands
[52:23] of immature men and pulling out and
[52:25] looking saying, "Okay, if we can get
[52:27] everybody looking right, if we can get
[52:29] all the women looking right, if we can
[52:31] get all the men looking right, if we can
[52:32] get everybody looking right on the
[52:34] outside, what this message says, uh,
[52:36] then then we're good. We're good." But
[52:38] we're not good if we get the whole
[52:40] outside looking right. It's not the way
[52:42] God works. God doesn't work from the
[52:45] outside in. God works from the inside
[52:47] out. Why didn't we catch that? because
[52:50] we're looking at it through immature
[52:52] eyes and we're saying, "Okay, here's the
[52:54] message. If we can get all the women and
[52:56] men looking good and all the teenagers
[52:57] and we get them all just right, then
[52:59] we're ready for a rapture." Absolutely
[53:01] not.
[53:02] Come on now. So, this is some of the
[53:04] immaturities in the early days of the
[53:06] message. And unfortunately, some of
[53:08] those things continue on today. I don't
[53:10] want to be a part of that. And you know
[53:11] why I've changed? Because I keep looking
[53:13] at this thing. I keep looking at this
[53:15] word. I keep going back and looking at
[53:18] this message. And every time I look, I
[53:20] catch something deeper.
[53:25] Praise the Lord.
[53:27] The message groups are full of it of
[53:33] handling even church situations in an
[53:36] immature
[53:37] way. Corinthian church was an immature
[53:40] church. They had all the gifts. They had
[53:43] all the moving of the spirit. But they
[53:46] handled things in an immature way. And
[53:48] Paul rebuked them for it. So, you're
[53:50] believers. He didn't unbelieverize them.
[53:52] He didn't uncristianize them. You're
[53:54] believers. You got the Holy Ghost, but
[53:56] you're acting immature. They were suing
[53:59] one another in court for their disputes
[54:01] with one another. He said, "What are you
[54:03] doing?"
[54:06] Aren't you mature enough to judge
[54:07] matters amongst yourself and fussing
[54:09] among yourself? You're going to the law
[54:11] with one another. and he's rebuking
[54:14] their immature judgment of matters
[54:17] internally
[54:18] didn't have the maturity to handle it
[54:20] like adults and I mean adult Christians
[54:24] right
[54:26] so we have a we've had a lot of that and
[54:29] we can't produce the right thing which
[54:31] is the image of Christ in people when we
[54:33] have the power of the word in immature
[54:36] people or immature preachers how many
[54:38] would just agree with me you can't get
[54:39] to the image of Christ in people if your
[54:42] handling this message with in immature
[54:44] preachers hands or immature people's
[54:45] hands, you're not going to get there.
[54:47] It's not going to happen. So then at
[54:48] through the years of the message as we
[54:50] grew and we formed, it's getting closer
[54:53] and closer now to the right thing.
[54:54] Wednesday night's message was an example
[54:56] of the level that we've moved to uh in
[54:59] this word. It's absolutely incredible.
[55:02] It's getting closer to the right thing
[55:03] now. Not working from the outside in,
[55:06] but working from the inside out. us
[55:09] being changed by his glory and from
[55:13] glory to glory to glory. It's not one
[55:17] night at an altar. It's you stay in
[55:19] front of this and you keep going back
[55:21] and looking at it and you're seeing this
[55:24] not as a law, but you see the Lord of
[55:27] this message. And if you're looking at
[55:29] the Lord, you are changed from glory to
[55:33] glory to glory. That's a process. That's
[55:36] not one night in an altar.
[55:39] And anybody who's still preaching it's
[55:41] all done at one night at an altar is not
[55:43] preaching the full council of this word.
[55:45] Just come to the altar. It's all over.
[55:47] God can change you in m one minute. But
[55:49] you are a baby and you begin to grow in
[55:51] the word of God. And you keep looking at
[55:54] this. It'll keep changing you from glory
[55:57] to glory to glory. And the biggest
[55:59] change will be down in the soul. Then it
[56:02] grows out of the soul to your spirit.
[56:04] Then it grows out of your spirit to your
[56:05] body. Then brother Bram says it grows
[56:08] out of your soul up into your mouth that
[56:10] you start talking right.
[56:13] The Holy Ghost gets in your mouth that
[56:16] you stop cursing and you stop gossiping.
[56:22] The Holy Ghost has not got in your mouth
[56:24] yet. If you're still gossiping, now
[56:29] then he says the Holy Ghost, you just
[56:32] burst out like a and it grows from your
[56:34] mouth up into your eyes and you look at
[56:37] the right things and you only want to
[56:39] look at the word and you're not giving
[56:41] yourself permission to dabble in things
[56:43] of the world because the Holy Ghost got
[56:45] in your eyes. Yes.
[56:49] He says, "Then you get to be a real
[56:51] mature thing and it grows right up in
[56:54] your mind. Let the mind of Christ be in
[56:57] you." That we start to think like Jesus.
[57:02] Somebody ought praise the Lord. If I
[57:05] don't stay up here, I won't finish my
[57:07] notes. So, it's forming into You know
[57:10] what? This message has brought us back
[57:13] to the scripture opening with the veils
[57:15] off. It's forming into something bigger
[57:17] than our little minds can fathom. Our
[57:20] little peeon
[57:22] minds can't fathom what God has brought
[57:26] us in this message. And it's going to do
[57:28] it despite all the bad that we have
[57:31] seen, despite all the immaturity we have
[57:34] seen. Uh, and I just feel like I was
[57:37] telling the ministers the other day the
[57:39] stages some of the ministers I was
[57:41] saying this the stages we went through
[57:43] with having this wonderful message is
[57:46] I've watched
[57:49] and how can I just bring this we as I
[57:52] said the early years we said okay if we
[57:54] can get the dress right then we're fine
[57:56] then we walk away and say okay we got
[57:58] all the dress right we got everybody
[58:00] conformed to the dress
[58:02] code then the Lord says
[58:05] but go back and look at that message
[58:06] again. Go back and look. So, we said,
[58:09] "Okay, we'll go back and look." Then we
[58:11] go back and look and then the 70s right
[58:13] there. Then we realize what my dad and I
[58:16] caught. Uh we were up in Canada. My dad
[58:18] was a pastor in Canada. And he only seen
[58:21] the message. Can I be honest with you?
[58:24] He only seen this message as God sent a
[58:26] prophet. And that was the message to
[58:28] him. But through a few meetings of
[58:30] brother Lonnie Jenkins come in and some
[58:32] other ministers mo mostly brother Lonnie
[58:33] Jenkins who's going on to his gone on to
[58:35] his reward now through his ministry the
[58:38] word opened up to us and we looked at
[58:40] the message again and realized this
[58:41] message isn't just that God sent a
[58:43] prophet there's a third pole in here
[58:46] there's an opening of the word to the
[58:48] bride so why did I get that because the
[58:51] Holy Spirit whisper said go back and
[58:53] look at that message again go back and
[58:56] look at it again now as you go through
[58:58] the years It's always been the Holy
[59:00] Spirit saying, "I know you feel like you
[59:02] got it now." And all the conventions,
[59:03] glory, the third pull. The third pull,
[59:05] the opening word. And then he's saying,
[59:07] "Go back and look again. Cuz there's
[59:10] more in there. You're missing some
[59:12] parts." And me for a minister, I'm
[59:16] telling you, I've learned. I don't have
[59:17] to hear him say that. I'm going back and
[59:19] looking again because what the devil is
[59:22] labeling this as being a cult and and
[59:24] and his his terrible uh interpretation
[59:28] of what this is and judging us by the
[59:31] dress code all no the dress code that's
[59:34] not even brother Brandham's message that
[59:35] came from the holiness movement
[59:38] that sisters should dress in different
[59:40] than men that didn't come from brother
[59:42] Brandham it came from the word and it
[59:44] came from the holiness restoration
[59:47] so every time I go back now. You look at
[59:50] the quote that some of the quotes
[59:52] brother Steve Brassan read here, some of
[59:54] the quotes that I've read recently, and
[59:56] it's like, I never knew that was in
[59:58] there. And one sentence can just open up
[1:00:02] a world of revelation.
[1:00:05] And the devil who puts a taint on this
[1:00:07] to get people to there's something wrong
[1:00:09] with it. It's not there's nothing I told
[1:00:11] this to one of my children yesterday.
[1:00:13] There's nothing wrong with what God sent
[1:00:15] us. But the devil would like us to take
[1:00:18] people and situations and preachers that
[1:00:20] have heard us and taint the the precious
[1:00:24] jewel of this message that God has given
[1:00:27] us. And what you need to do is get your
[1:00:29] eyes off of people and get your eyes on
[1:00:31] what this is. Go back and look at it
[1:00:33] again.
[1:00:38] I'm not being mean with you. I'm just
[1:00:40] saying go back and look at it again.
[1:00:42] People, you know, you don't like to be
[1:00:44] told what to do. And when somebody tells
[1:00:46] me what to do, I say, "You can't tell me
[1:00:47] what to do. You're not my
[1:00:51] granddaughter. Only she's allowed to do
[1:00:56] that."
[1:00:59] Uh, you ever see one of those uh
[1:01:03] pictures and uh and in the picture they
[1:01:07] list all the stuff that's in the picture
[1:01:08] and you got to find it. There's four
[1:01:10] dogs in there and there's three chickens
[1:01:12] and there's four cows and there's five
[1:01:14] lions and you're looking at saying,
[1:01:16] "Where in the world is that?" So, you
[1:01:18] have to keep looking at it and you go
[1:01:20] down the list. Okay, okay, I found two
[1:01:22] chickens. Okay, there's the third
[1:01:24] chicken and I I only got two dogs so
[1:01:27] far. And if you walk away and say, "I'm
[1:01:30] good." You're not going to get the
[1:01:32] reward.
[1:01:34] So, you you keep looking at this picture
[1:01:37] and guess what? They're all in there.
[1:01:39] Yeah, but you walked away and quit
[1:01:41] looking at it. The glories of the Lord,
[1:01:44] all of the glory of God is in the word
[1:01:47] of God. But people stop looking at it.
[1:01:52] There's cows in there and there's four
[1:01:55] five lions and four cows and you say, "I
[1:01:57] can't find I just I'm missing just that
[1:01:59] two lions and I'm missing it." Go back
[1:02:02] and look at it again. You said it was in
[1:02:04] there, but I can't find it. You can't
[1:02:06] give up.
[1:02:07] Are you listening to me today? You can't
[1:02:10] give up on this message. You can't uh
[1:02:14] this this is a son of man revealing the
[1:02:17] son of man. And you can't you got to go
[1:02:21] back and look at it again because you're
[1:02:23] not seeing it right yet. And there's
[1:02:25] nothing so great as when you you can go
[1:02:27] off the list and check the list. I found
[1:02:29] the cows. I found the lions. I've got
[1:02:32] We're all And the picture is I've got it
[1:02:35] figured out. Anybody ever go into Home
[1:02:38] Depot and you're looking for something
[1:02:40] maybe like I don't know a transformer or
[1:02:43] some type of battery or something and
[1:02:46] you're looking for it and you're looking
[1:02:47] for this part particular model and
[1:02:50] there's nothing there. It's it's all
[1:02:52] gone. And so you go up front and you
[1:02:54] say, "I want this particular model of uh
[1:02:58] this this product." And they say they
[1:03:01] look it up, you know,
[1:03:06] It says it says we have five in the
[1:03:10] store and so you're you're you're
[1:03:12] longing for them to help you out a
[1:03:14] little bit
[1:03:16] further. But they say it says there's
[1:03:18] five in the store. So I said so well
[1:03:20] where do you Well we'll go back there
[1:03:22] and look go back and look again in that
[1:03:24] area and see what you can find and and
[1:03:26] keep looking. So you go back and do
[1:03:28] that. You can't find it you come back.
[1:03:30] But you see now you're trusting. And
[1:03:31] they're saying there's and I always say
[1:03:33] to him, I said, "Is there five in this
[1:03:35] store or is it in the store in
[1:03:38] Parisburg?" No, it says there's five in
[1:03:41] this store. And if it says there's five,
[1:03:43] they are in this store. I don't know if
[1:03:45] you have any, but this this can be
[1:03:46] frustrating. And so, you
[1:03:49] know, okay, can you get somebody to help
[1:03:52] me? And so, finally, they do. And listen
[1:03:55] friends, we need help
[1:03:59] with that Bible and this message. You
[1:04:02] better not do it on your own. You better
[1:04:03] call on the Lord's help. It's him that
[1:04:06] opens your eyes. Holy SK Holy Spirit,
[1:04:09] the Holy Ghost is one who comes
[1:04:10] alongside to help. And he's the teacher.
[1:04:13] You need him alongside so he can take
[1:04:16] the veils off your eyes. You can see
[1:04:17] this message, right? And I just get that
[1:04:19] guy and finally they call somebody over
[1:04:21] and you know I'm in there another 20
[1:04:23] minutes waiting and they get the they
[1:04:24] come over and say so he's looking
[1:04:26] through it. He's doing the same thing I
[1:04:27] did. He's looking through it. I don't
[1:04:28] see it either but it says there's five
[1:04:30] here and then then all of a sudden he
[1:04:32] looks up and he says,
[1:04:35] "Oh, there it is. It's in that big box
[1:04:38] up there on
[1:04:39] top." And he says, "They're up there."
[1:04:45] Yes, but I can't get up there.
[1:04:51] But something drops in my
[1:04:53] heart. It's in the store.
[1:04:57] It's here.
[1:04:59] I wonder if some of you are thinking,
[1:05:01] "Boy, some of his examples are just
[1:05:02] juvenile. That's all there is to it."
[1:05:04] But this is the way I think about things
[1:05:06] because, you know, I get great
[1:05:08] revelations while I'm in Home Depot.
[1:05:12] But I can tell you that it takes them to
[1:05:14] get that tractor and bring it over and
[1:05:17] takes them to lift us higher. Whether
[1:05:18] that guy or me, you, we have to be
[1:05:21] lifted higher in order to get the stuff
[1:05:23] that we don't have yet. But guess what?
[1:05:26] It's in the store. It's in the word.
[1:05:29] It's in the message. You have to stay
[1:05:31] there because thanks be to God, it's not
[1:05:34] in another store. It's not coming out of
[1:05:36] some denominational system. It's not
[1:05:39] even coming out of Literal Life Church.
[1:05:41] It's in that word
[1:05:43] and you got to climb higher to go get
[1:05:46] it. You got to be willing to say, "Lord,
[1:05:49] I see it's in the room. It's here." And
[1:05:51] listen, let me talk about a little room
[1:05:53] because that was the last stage of the
[1:05:55] prophet's vision. It wasn't the big tent
[1:05:57] meeting with big crowds. It was in a
[1:05:59] little room to the side. And the little
[1:06:02] room is the final stage. Going through
[1:06:05] that little room, they come out healed
[1:06:07] on the other side. They come out of body
[1:06:10] change
[1:06:12] and where was it? It's in the little
[1:06:14] room and nobody went in there with them.
[1:06:17] There's a line up there. There's
[1:06:19] somebody taking their names. That's in
[1:06:21] the vision. And then they go
[1:06:22] individually. You don't go as a crowd in
[1:06:24] that little room. You don't go as a as
[1:06:26] literal life as a congregation. No, you
[1:06:29] come in that little room yourself.
[1:06:32] Can you say amen? You step into there
[1:06:35] yourself.
[1:06:37] Wow. that needs to be cleaned in
[1:06:40] there. It's not a crowd. It's not know
[1:06:43] the vision. It's the little room. But
[1:06:45] guess what? It's in the little room. If
[1:06:48] you were looking
[1:06:49] for How many's ever lost something and
[1:06:53] you remember that it was this room that
[1:06:55] you lost it in. So that helps matters.
[1:06:57] But you can't find it in the room. You
[1:07:00] know, it was your energy
[1:07:02] pills because I'm talking about the
[1:07:04] rapture.
[1:07:05] It was your and you can't but but the
[1:07:08] one thing you know they're in this room
[1:07:10] somewhere. That's right. So that helps
[1:07:12] you. It's in the room. It's in the room.
[1:07:14] So you keep and you can stay within that
[1:07:16] room and keep looking and keep looking
[1:07:19] until you find cuz you know they're not
[1:07:21] somewhere else out there. They're in
[1:07:23] that little room. You're injured pills
[1:07:25] and you've got to find them. Can you say
[1:07:26] amen? You can't look any other place in
[1:07:29] this world cuz you know that's the room
[1:07:32] that you will find them in. What do you
[1:07:34] do? Go back and look again. Can you say
[1:07:36] amen?
[1:07:38] You will find rapturing faith in this
[1:07:41] little room. Nowhere else. God says, "Go
[1:07:44] back and look
[1:07:46] again." So, the current
[1:07:50] conditions are met for the promise of
[1:07:52] the rapture. These conditions are being
[1:07:54] used. I'm going to move to that now in
[1:07:56] Psalms 27. The conditions are being used
[1:08:00] to form us into the promise and cause us
[1:08:03] to run into that room with him. Cause us
[1:08:05] to run in that secret place with him. I
[1:08:07] know some of you this morning possibly,
[1:08:10] well, I know for sure. I know some of my
[1:08:13] congregation you ran from him for
[1:08:19] years. Don't know what you ran from. I I
[1:08:21] don't think some of you ran from him. I
[1:08:23] think you ran from the presentation of
[1:08:26] him.
[1:08:28] Can I get an amen? You ran from
[1:08:30] something.
[1:08:32] And but you know what? If you're his
[1:08:35] child,
[1:08:37] he will love you and make it so that
[1:08:40] you'll run to him and not away from him.
[1:08:45] Can I get an amen? He'll love you that
[1:08:48] much. All of a sudden, he he creates the
[1:08:50] conditions in this world, the trials of
[1:08:53] your life. He creates the conditions
[1:08:55] that you're not running from him
[1:08:57] anymore. You're running towards him. The
[1:09:00] name of the Lord is a strong tower
[1:09:02] wherein the righteous run into it and
[1:09:05] they are safe.
[1:09:07] What makes you run to it? Because
[1:09:08] usually we run away like they did in the
[1:09:10] Garden of Eden. We run away. His love
[1:09:12] comes over our life and causes us to run
[1:09:15] into him. Run into his place of safety.
[1:09:18] So you live in a time of trouble. What's
[1:09:20] the answer? To hide you in a secret
[1:09:22] place. Turn with me to Psalms 27. And
[1:09:24] this is the text brother Brandham used
[1:09:26] for the rapture. So, we keep looking at
[1:09:28] the one of my favorite chapters in the
[1:09:30] Bible is Psalms 27 because it is related
[1:09:33] to the conditions and the place that
[1:09:36] we're in before the rapture. Psalms 27.
[1:09:39] Let's read it
[1:09:40] together and we're going to break it
[1:09:42] down a little bit today. You got time
[1:09:43] with me? We're going to break down the
[1:09:45] conditions that surrounding the rapture
[1:09:47] in Psalms 27. So, it's all a secret.
[1:09:49] It's about a secret place. How many know
[1:09:52] the rapture is a secret? It's a secret
[1:09:54] catching away. So all this becomes a
[1:09:56] secret. And there's actually a secret
[1:09:57] place of his pavilion that he hides us
[1:10:00] in that's related to the rapture. No one
[1:10:02] will even see what's going on in this
[1:10:04] forming that's going on in this secret
[1:10:07] place. One day we'll just be gone. But
[1:10:09] before we're gone, he has to hide us. He
[1:10:12] has to protect us. And what we learn in
[1:10:15] this place, if we'll get in it, we learn
[1:10:17] to overcome these conditions. And we
[1:10:20] learn to run and hide with him. The
[1:10:22] safest place to be is in that pavilion
[1:10:26] with him.
[1:10:28] And we learn to run to him. We learn to
[1:10:30] stay in that place with him because the
[1:10:32] conditions are too overwhelming for you.
[1:10:35] But this place is so powerful that we
[1:10:38] actually get two things. We overcome and
[1:10:40] live above the conditions
[1:10:43] and we're raptured out of the
[1:10:45] conditions.
[1:10:47] It's pretty powerful
[1:10:48] place. It's pointing us to a place
[1:10:50] Psalms 27. A position we get into the
[1:10:52] rapture hiding and living above
[1:10:54] conditions. Hold that thought. Let me
[1:10:56] just say it this way. Isolated or more
[1:10:59] specifically insulated. Because we're
[1:11:00] not totally isolated from the conditions
[1:11:04] around us, but we can be insulated from
[1:11:06] it. spiritually insulated.
[1:11:09] I like that. So, it says in Psalms 27,
[1:11:12] "The Lord is my light, my salvation.
[1:11:14] Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the
[1:11:16] strength of my life. Of whom shall I be
[1:11:18] afraid?" I'm going to read through it
[1:11:19] and then I'll come back and comment on
[1:11:21] the conditions. When the wicked, even my
[1:11:22] enemies and my foes came upon me to eat
[1:11:25] up my flesh. They stumbled and fell.
[1:11:27] Though, and host should encamp against
[1:11:28] me, my heart shall not fear. Though war
[1:11:31] should rise against me, in this will I
[1:11:32] be confident. One thing have I desired
[1:11:35] of the Lord that will I seek after that
[1:11:36] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[1:11:38] the days of my talking about a dwelling
[1:11:40] place. Dwelling place. Can you say amen?
[1:11:42] To behold the beauty of the Lord to
[1:11:43] inquire in his temple. For in the time
[1:11:45] of trouble I did a series on the time of
[1:11:47] trouble. In the time of trouble what's
[1:11:49] he going to do? Uh in the time of tr
[1:11:52] trouble try to become a governor of your
[1:11:54] state and change the
[1:11:56] laws. In the time of trouble go out and
[1:11:59] protest and put signs up against
[1:12:02] transgender.
[1:12:05] In the time of trouble, fight back.
[1:12:07] Fight, fight, fight. No. In the time of
[1:12:09] trouble, he shall hide me.
[1:12:12] That's God's answer. Come on now. He'll
[1:12:14] hide me.
[1:12:16] That's good. Time of trouble, he'll hide
[1:12:18] me in his pavilion. In the secret of his
[1:12:20] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[1:12:22] set me up upon a rock. And now shall
[1:12:24] mine head be lifted above mine enemies
[1:12:26] round about me. Therefore will I, notice
[1:12:28] this position. Now, your head lifted up
[1:12:30] above your enemies, not below.
[1:12:33] above. Therefore will I offer in this
[1:12:35] tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will
[1:12:37] sing. Yay. I will sing praises unto the
[1:12:39] Lord. Hear, oh Lord, when I cry with my
[1:12:41] voice. Have mercy also upon me and
[1:12:43] answer me. When thou sayest, seek me my
[1:12:45] face. My heart said unto thee, thy face,
[1:12:47] Lord, will I seek. Hide not thy face far
[1:12:50] far from me. Put not thy servant away in
[1:12:52] anger that thou hast been my help. Leave
[1:12:55] me not, neither forsake me, oh God of my
[1:12:57] salvation. When my father and my mother
[1:12:58] forsake me, then the Lord will take them
[1:13:00] up. Teach me, take me up, teach me, oh
[1:13:03] Lord, and lead me in the plain path
[1:13:05] because of mine enemies. Deliver me not
[1:13:07] over the unto the will of mine enemies,
[1:13:09] for false witnesses are risen up against
[1:13:11] me, and such as breathe out cruelty. I
[1:13:14] have faded unless I believe to see the
[1:13:16] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[1:13:18] living. Wait on the Lord. Be of good
[1:13:20] courage, and he shall strengthen thine
[1:13:23] heart. Wait, I say, wait on the Lord. I
[1:13:26] love it. So now if we break this down,
[1:13:29] what's the conditions before rapture
[1:13:31] that we're under? First of all, in verse
[1:13:33] one, fear and being
[1:13:36] afraid. More extreme than any other
[1:13:39] thing taking over people's lives. And
[1:13:41] Jesus said it about the end time. Men's
[1:13:44] hearts shall fail them for fear.
[1:13:48] I'm amazed how many Christians sometimes
[1:13:51] making decisions and the motivation is
[1:13:53] not faith. It's based out of fear.
[1:13:57] They're afraid.
[1:13:59] They're even doing things of the Lord
[1:14:01] sometimes, but they're doing it. Are you
[1:14:04] listening?
[1:14:05] If you obey the commandments of the Lord
[1:14:09] out of
[1:14:11] fear. They must not be done out of fear.
[1:14:14] They must be done out of faith.
[1:14:18] But the whole generation is full of
[1:14:20] fear, being afraid. I got to move on to
[1:14:23] the next one. Verse two. There are
[1:14:25] forces who are out to destroy the body.
[1:14:28] There are demon um demonic uh forces in
[1:14:31] the realm that bring physical attacks
[1:14:33] against our body. Sicknesses, diseases,
[1:14:36] they're increasing. And so in this
[1:14:39] generation, a great condition that
[1:14:41] challenges us and makes us discouraged
[1:14:44] is the attack from the enemy to eat up
[1:14:46] my flesh. In other words, that's an
[1:14:48] attack on your physical body. Okay?
[1:14:52] this condition of this time. Always
[1:14:55] remember, always remember
[1:14:58] uh that it's the enemy that's doing
[1:15:00] that.
[1:15:02] It's some force that's against you.
[1:15:05] The doctor doesn't even know that.
[1:15:08] So, we appreciate doctors, but you have
[1:15:10] to realize that when we're under these
[1:15:11] conditions, if he can get you down
[1:15:13] physically, he discourages you when
[1:15:15] you're physically down and you're
[1:15:17] physically sick. He did it with Jesus
[1:15:19] when he was hungry. He attacked them at
[1:15:21] his weakest point. If he can attack you
[1:15:23] physically with demons in the in the uh
[1:15:26] in the realm what brother Bram call it
[1:15:28] in the in the in the u physical realm
[1:15:31] demons in the physical realm making us
[1:15:33] sick making us and so now we have more
[1:15:35] sickness than we've ever had. We have
[1:15:37] more migraines than we ever had. We have
[1:15:39] more sickness more medicine but more
[1:15:41] sickness than we've ever had. So what is
[1:15:43] that? What is what is that? Science
[1:15:45] should have solved the problem already.
[1:15:47] And we appreciate science, but why do we
[1:15:49] have more sickness? More medicine, but
[1:15:51] more sickness. Why do we have that?
[1:15:53] Because of the conditions before
[1:15:55] rapture. This is the attack from the
[1:15:57] enemy.
[1:15:59] Can you say amen?
[1:16:01] So number three, verse three, what's
[1:16:03] another condition? Though a host should
[1:16:05] encamp against me, my heart shall not.
[1:16:06] So now it's about the heart. It's about
[1:16:08] your spirit. And though war should rise
[1:16:10] against me, and this will I be
[1:16:12] confident. So the feeling in your heart
[1:16:14] of feeling surrounded, feeling
[1:16:17] overwhelmed in your spirit, feeling
[1:16:20] overwhelmed in your mind, this is a
[1:16:22] condition that I think is even worse
[1:16:24] today. Mental illness is worse than
[1:16:27] physical illness today.
[1:16:30] And they say in mental and and uh and
[1:16:34] heart, it it it's it's something that it
[1:16:38] overwhelms the mind and it overwhelms
[1:16:40] the heart. spoke on it a few months ago.
[1:16:42] Jesus said, "Take heed to yourself that
[1:16:45] you're not overburdened by the cares of
[1:16:47] life." The the trait of this age is
[1:16:49] being over our minds are not meant to
[1:16:52] handle all this pressure. That's right.
[1:16:55] And the minds are going mental because
[1:16:57] it's just it's it's like it feels like
[1:17:01] David said this feels like because
[1:17:03] remember David is speaking he's speaking
[1:17:06] about terms of being a warrior but he's
[1:17:08] saying what you'll feel like in your
[1:17:10] generation in rapture time he's
[1:17:12] prophesying you'll feel like you're
[1:17:14] sitting somewhere and there's a host
[1:17:17] encamped around you and you're
[1:17:19] surrounded by the devil and your mind
[1:17:21] feels that way. They tell me that a
[1:17:23] panic t a panic attack is feeling
[1:17:27] overwhelmed and then it's all coming at
[1:17:29] you and it hits you all at once and you
[1:17:30] have a panic attack.
[1:17:34] There it is right there in the
[1:17:35] scripture. Feeling
[1:17:38] overwhelmed. Verse seven says, "I
[1:17:42] cried." Sometimes you're so bad that in
[1:17:46] this generation, you're crying out for
[1:17:48] God's mercy with a loud urge in your
[1:17:50] heart. You're just crying out. I won't
[1:17:53] ask for hands, but I know I've done it.
[1:17:55] Is that you're just crying out, God have
[1:17:57] mercy on the situation. God have mercy
[1:18:01] on this. God have mercy. There's a cry.
[1:18:04] We're crying sometimes in this journey
[1:18:05] because we're human beings.
[1:18:08] It's okay to cry. Can you say amen?
[1:18:10] Crying out for God's mercy. Verse nine,
[1:18:13] the feeling I want to elaborate on this
[1:18:16] one. Are you still with me a little bit?
[1:18:19] Verse nine, hide not thy face from me.
[1:18:22] Put not thy servant away in anger. Thou
[1:18:24] hast been a help. Leave me not, neither
[1:18:26] forsake me, oh God. Now David addresses
[1:18:29] God and he says it's the feeling that
[1:18:32] God is angry with
[1:18:33] you, that he's turned away his face and
[1:18:37] God has forsaken
[1:18:39] you. Now, let me ask this question. When
[1:18:42] I read that last
[1:18:44] night, is that true that God has
[1:18:48] forsaken
[1:18:50] you? That can't be true. That's right.
[1:18:54] Not to his elect, not to his sons and
[1:18:56] daughters. But the feeling, the feeling
[1:19:00] is that you feel he's turned his face
[1:19:03] away. He's angry with me, and he's
[1:19:06] forsaken me.
[1:19:09] It's not true, but it's so real to you
[1:19:12] that you feel like God has forsaken you.
[1:19:15] Yeah. God, I don't feel his presence. I
[1:19:18] don't think he's there. And often, and I
[1:19:20] try to be careful because people start
[1:19:21] blaming God for things and God's
[1:19:23] forsaken me and I've crossed the line.
[1:19:25] And I try to be careful because you have
[1:19:26] to have a care for their heart because
[1:19:28] they're feeling that. You can get them
[1:19:30] admit, you know, that's not true that
[1:19:32] God's forsaken you. He doesn't forsake.
[1:19:34] I will. He says, "I will never leave
[1:19:36] thee or forsake thee." Right? That's
[1:19:38] what his word says. But the feeling of
[1:19:41] it is God has turned his anger towards
[1:19:44] me. God has forsaken me. Guess what?
[1:19:48] Jesus said it at the cross.
[1:19:52] In other words, he come into such a dark
[1:19:54] time and such a low, the spirit left him
[1:19:57] in the garden and he's there going to
[1:19:59] the cross according to what the prophecy
[1:20:01] said he would do. And it's so dark and
[1:20:04] he feels so distant from God that he
[1:20:06] cries out, "My God, my God, why have
[1:20:09] thou forsaken me?" Jesus felt that.
[1:20:12] Aren't you glad he felt that feeling?
[1:20:16] Our Lord felt like what it felt like
[1:20:19] that the father had forsaken him. But it
[1:20:22] wasn't true. The father was right there
[1:20:26] ready to fulfill his word. But he Jesus
[1:20:28] had to go through that so he would
[1:20:30] understand us when we go through this
[1:20:33] last days condition of feeling like
[1:20:35] we're forsaken by God. I've got to move
[1:20:37] on here now. But now we move to the next
[1:20:39] place and that's verse 10. And this is
[1:20:42] probably the one of the hardest ones.
[1:20:44] When my mother and my father forsake
[1:20:47] me. What a generation of a breakdown of
[1:20:51] families.
[1:20:53] Brother Steve spoke on it a few weeks.
[1:20:54] the voice of the father to a son missing
[1:20:57] in this generation. All of his
[1:20:59] confidence is is is is uh formed by the
[1:21:03] approval of the father and you're not
[1:21:05] getting it because there's a breakdown
[1:21:06] of fathers. Then mothers that that woman
[1:21:09] she looks even to the voice of the
[1:21:11] father, the approval of the father and
[1:21:13] generationally we're not getting it.
[1:21:15] Even in some of our message homes
[1:21:17] there's a breakdown of parents. And why
[1:21:18] are they broke down? There's no sense in
[1:21:20] blaming your parents for bringing this
[1:21:22] message the wrong way. They're supposed
[1:21:23] to because their parents were broke down
[1:21:26] and their prayers were broke down. So,
[1:21:29] can I say something about this is that
[1:21:31] you can live your whole life being a
[1:21:33] victim that my parents didn't do me
[1:21:35] right. It's time to say, "Okay, we know
[1:21:38] that, but it's time to look to the
[1:21:40] victory of the future and not what your
[1:21:42] parents did."
[1:21:45] Well, they may raised me in a bad way.
[1:21:47] Even in this message, they raised me in
[1:21:48] a legalistic way. Okay, I understand
[1:21:51] many people I preach to many people here
[1:21:54] that were raised the same way. But you
[1:21:55] know what? They're getting past their
[1:21:57] past. They're saying, "I can't dwell on
[1:21:59] that for 20 years." And like brother
[1:22:01] Marcus preached Wednesday night, this
[1:22:03] message is the father speaking to us. If
[1:22:06] you didn't have a good father, you have
[1:22:08] the heavenly father.
[1:22:12] And his voice speaks to you even this
[1:22:14] morning. Brings comfort, brings
[1:22:16] confidence. Yes, it's a breakdown of
[1:22:19] fathers and mothers. And he's saying
[1:22:21] that it's because the condition of the
[1:22:22] last days when my father and mother and
[1:22:24] that's that's a pretty close
[1:22:26] relationship breakdown. You can have a
[1:22:29] whole world forsake you. But when it's a
[1:22:31] father and mother, that affects us.
[1:22:39] Verse
[1:22:40] 11, teach me, oh Lord, lead me into the
[1:22:42] plain path. Well, I got to believe that
[1:22:44] the opposite of a plain path is a fuzzy
[1:22:46] path,
[1:22:49] unclear, a complicated path. That's the
[1:22:51] hour we live in. We got forces that have
[1:22:55] are distorting this message and
[1:22:57] distorting this
[1:22:58] Bible, distorting this message to many
[1:23:01] people. It's the conditions for Satan to
[1:23:03] complicate things and take something
[1:23:05] simple and make it complicated. And
[1:23:08] that's why David cries, "Give me a plain
[1:23:10] path because everything's fuzzy right
[1:23:14] now." Verse eight, some more conditions
[1:23:17] when the verse eight. Nope, not verse
[1:23:20] eight. Verse
[1:23:22] 12. Deliver me over not over to the will
[1:23:26] of mine enemies. For false witnesses are
[1:23:28] risen up against me, and such as breathe
[1:23:30] out cruelty. I know none of you have
[1:23:32] ever experienced any of this, but I'll
[1:23:34] preach it anyway. false witnesses that
[1:23:36] speak lies and words of cruelty and
[1:23:39] hurtful words to
[1:23:41] you. God, help me not to yield over to
[1:23:44] their will because you yield over to
[1:23:46] people who are saying hurtful words
[1:23:47] toward you. You yield over to their will
[1:23:50] under the pressure and you become
[1:23:52] controlled by their words. Somebody
[1:23:54] ought to say amen. For years, you're
[1:23:57] controlled by the hurtful words of
[1:23:58] somebody else. But we live in a day
[1:24:00] people are rough, people are hurtful,
[1:24:03] people are cruel,
[1:24:08] pressure being controlled by them. In
[1:24:11] verse 13, the last one, I had fainted.
[1:24:13] It means fainting means you feel like
[1:24:16] giving up.
[1:24:19] Fainted means you feel like giving up.
[1:24:25] I don't know if you noticed or
[1:24:27] not. Well, first of all, I'm trying to
[1:24:29] find a place to end this and close it. I
[1:24:33] don't know if you noticed
[1:24:37] that, but I don't know if you noticed
[1:24:40] that in all of those conditions of the
[1:24:43] end time and pre-rapture time, how first
[1:24:46] of all, how many raise your hands and
[1:24:47] say, "I've experienced all
[1:24:49] these." Yeah, because this is a rapture
[1:24:51] chapter.
[1:24:54] This is what we deal with. But guess
[1:24:56] what? There are conditions that make us
[1:24:58] run into that secret place. They should
[1:25:01] It should make us run away. The
[1:25:03] conditions, not the bride.
[1:25:05] It shouldn't make us more bitter. It
[1:25:07] should make us better.
[1:25:10] I don't want to be bitter. I want to be
[1:25:11] better. For the bride, these conditions,
[1:25:15] Satan's saying, "I got her. I got her.
[1:25:17] I'm I'm having her persecuted. I've got
[1:25:19] fear demons on them. I've got I their
[1:25:23] mind is they feel overwhelmed in their
[1:25:24] minds. I've got this. I'm gonna
[1:25:26] discourage this bride. And Satan doesn't
[1:25:28] realize, buddy, it's gonna backfire on
[1:25:31] one group of people. It's going to put
[1:25:33] them in a rapture someday. Somebody say,
[1:25:36] "Praise the Lord." It's going to
[1:25:38] backfire on you, devil. Put all you want
[1:25:41] to on the pressure on them. It's going
[1:25:43] to backfire on this bride. She is going
[1:25:47] to come out of it. Did you notice every
[1:25:49] time there's a symptom or there's a
[1:25:51] condition, there's a positive side to
[1:25:54] every condition, there's a victory.
[1:25:56] Number one, when there's fear and being
[1:25:58] afraid, the Lord is my light and my
[1:26:00] salvation. The Lord is the strength and
[1:26:02] my light. Number two, when the enemies
[1:26:04] surround him, even my enemies and my
[1:26:07] foes came upon me, eating my flesh, they
[1:26:08] stumbled and fell. God will make the
[1:26:11] enemies, the feelings are
[1:26:13] overwhelming, it'll make them stumble
[1:26:15] and fall.
[1:26:17] Verse three, though a host should encamp
[1:26:20] against me, my heart shall not fear.
[1:26:22] He'll drive away my fear. Though war
[1:26:24] should arise against me, in this will I
[1:26:26] be confident. You know what God's going
[1:26:28] to give you through that feeling
[1:26:30] overwhelmed, disrounded? He's going to
[1:26:31] give you more confidence.
[1:26:34] Every condition has a positive response
[1:26:37] to it.
[1:26:40] You know why? Because this bride always
[1:26:44] gets the victory. Because Christ is in
[1:26:47] charge, he'll always get the victory.
[1:26:53] Skip down to the other ones. Let me get
[1:26:55] the positive side real quick. And now,
[1:26:58] uh, no, verse, uh, seven. Oh, here, oh
[1:27:00] Lord, when I cry my voice, have mercy on
[1:27:02] me, and answer me. When thou sayest,
[1:27:04] seek my face, I seek, hide not thy face
[1:27:06] from me. When you when when it seems
[1:27:08] like God is forsaking you, he says, be
[1:27:11] my
[1:27:12] help. Uh when when my father and mother
[1:27:16] forsake me, what's the answer? Then the
[1:27:18] Lord will take me up. He'll be my
[1:27:20] father.
[1:27:22] Teach me, oh Lord, and lead me in the
[1:27:24] plain path because of my enemies.
[1:27:26] Deliver me not over the will of my
[1:27:28] enemies. For false witnesses are rising
[1:27:30] up against me, and such as breathe out
[1:27:31] cruelty. So deliver me not over to what?
[1:27:34] What's the positive? Here's the
[1:27:36] positive. Don't let me yield to their
[1:27:39] will.
[1:27:41] I want God's will. I don't not I don't
[1:27:42] want their will. And then I love this
[1:27:45] one. I had given up. I had fainted. And
[1:27:48] unless
[1:27:51] unless I had believed to see the
[1:27:54] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[1:27:56] living, there's a victory in every
[1:27:59] condition. Wait on the Lord. Be of good
[1:28:02] courage and he shall strengthen thy
[1:28:05] heart. Wait, I say wait on the Lord. Can
[1:28:09] you say praise the Lord? So God turns
[1:28:12] the test to a testimony. That's right.
[1:28:17] God turns the loss into a liberty.
[1:28:21] God turns the lemons into lemonade.
[1:28:25] God turns the pressure into more
[1:28:28] potential.
[1:28:29] God turns the hurt into healing. God
[1:28:32] turns the panic into a promise. God
[1:28:36] turns the trouble into more trust. Yes,
[1:28:39] sir. Oh, I should be getting more amens
[1:28:41] than that. He can turn a man of
[1:28:43] addiction into a man of conviction.
[1:28:47] Amen.
[1:28:51] God turns depression into possession.
[1:28:55] God turns mistakes into miracles.
[1:28:59] God turns confusion into confidence.
[1:29:03] God turns tribulation into jubilation.
[1:29:08] God turns problems into a position.
[1:29:12] God turns the rough days into a rapture.
[1:29:19] Because his
[1:29:21] people in these conditions are going to
[1:29:24] get the victory over it. He's forming
[1:29:27] the conditions for rapture. And some
[1:29:30] will get bitter, but there's going to be
[1:29:32] some that's going to get better. They're
[1:29:34] living above it. That's where Christ
[1:29:36] were formed into. It's turning into a
[1:29:38] victory. The victory is living above it.
[1:29:40] Looking down at the little peeons. You
[1:29:42] know, I looked at that up. Uh he he the
[1:29:45] scripture says he lifted and let me just
[1:29:47] end on this scripture here. Psalms 27
[1:29:50] verse 6. And now shall mine head be
[1:29:52] lifted above my enemies. What kind of
[1:29:55] power is this? Is that you're in these
[1:29:57] conditions and he lifts your head above
[1:29:59] your enemies and he sets you up on a
[1:30:01] rock. What's it mean? it. You're looking
[1:30:03] higher and you're looking down at all
[1:30:07] Satan's demons. Now, peeons, I call that
[1:30:10] because it's a modern slang for peon is
[1:30:12] often used to describe someone who is
[1:30:14] seen as insignificant, lowly, or easily
[1:30:18] manipulated. Don't ever call somebody
[1:30:20] that. That's what the world does. But
[1:30:23] I'm calling the devil that this morning.
[1:30:25] I'm calling the demons that, physical
[1:30:27] and religious demons.
[1:30:31] and he lifts you up and you're just
[1:30:32] looking at out over the little peeons of
[1:30:36] demons
[1:30:38] and we describe them as insignificant,
[1:30:42] lowly
[1:30:45] and easily manipulated. The problem is
[1:30:47] is in this age, he wants to take sons of
[1:30:50] God and put them down here and he's up
[1:30:54] there looking down on us and
[1:30:57] manipulating us. But he said, "I will
[1:31:00] lift your head above the enemies." And
[1:31:02] you're looking down at those things that
[1:31:05] are threatening you, the little peeons,
[1:31:08] that you're intimidating them
[1:31:14] instead of them intimidating you.
[1:31:19] 1965, who is this MelkiseDC? And then
[1:31:22] when you become subject to that spirit,
[1:31:23] the quote, it throws your whole being
[1:31:26] subject to that spirit. When you become
[1:31:29] subject to the spirit, I don't know if
[1:31:32] you guys have that quote
[1:31:34] there. When you become subject to that
[1:31:36] spirit, it throws your whole being
[1:31:39] subject to that spirit. And that spirit
[1:31:42] is nothing in the world but his seed
[1:31:44] word made manifest or quickened.
[1:31:46] Hallelujah. Made alive. And when the
[1:31:48] Bible said don't do this, that body
[1:31:51] quickly turns to it, there's no
[1:31:53] question. And what is it? It's the
[1:31:55] earnest of the resurrection. This body
[1:31:58] will be raised up again because it's
[1:32:01] already started.
[1:32:04] It was once subject to sin and mire and
[1:32:07] corruption, but now it's got the
[1:32:09] earnest, which means the down payment.
[1:32:11] It's turned heavenly. Remember my text.
[1:32:15] Remember my text. Our conversation is in
[1:32:17] heaven. That's where it starts. Before
[1:32:18] the body change, the body, this body
[1:32:21] turns heavenly in its in its slant, in
[1:32:23] its focus. Now, that's the earnest that
[1:32:27] you're going in a rapture.
[1:32:35] And then in perfect faith, he says Jesus
[1:32:38] lived in a world that no one knew about.
[1:32:40] He was an odd person. He lived in a
[1:32:42] world of perfect faith and a perfect God
[1:32:44] in which he was. If he lived in a
[1:32:45] perfect faith of a Christian to what we
[1:32:47] are, we'd be a mystic to the world. The
[1:32:50] people wouldn't understand you. You'd
[1:32:51] walk in the spirit. What the spirit said
[1:32:53] you would do, what it forbid you would
[1:32:54] not do. Then the people begin to say,
[1:32:57] "You'd be a mystic person to them."
[1:32:59] That's the way it is to all believers.
[1:33:01] They're mystics. The people don't
[1:33:02] understand because they live in a world
[1:33:04] to themselves. Jesus lived in a world
[1:33:06] that nobody else could touch. The
[1:33:08] disciples couldn't understand him. when
[1:33:10] he spoke to them they would say and then
[1:33:12] they said you you talk in riddles we
[1:33:14] don't understand this how can this be
[1:33:16] see they wasn't in the world that we he
[1:33:19] lived in they couldn't understand him
[1:33:21] nobody could understand him so when a
[1:33:23] man lives by faith and walks by faith
[1:33:25] once again transferring from Jesus over
[1:33:27] to us when a man walks by faith
[1:33:30] substance faith he is isolated from the
[1:33:34] entire world and becomes a new creature
[1:33:36] in Christ now you're getting into bride
[1:33:40] material. You're getting into rapturing
[1:33:43] condition now.
[1:33:50] Oh God, I want to be there.
[1:33:53] This pre- room, this precondition, this
[1:33:57] rapturing condition.
[1:34:00] Lord, bring me in there. Yes.
[1:34:04] That means for each one of us, not just
[1:34:07] the
[1:34:08] pastor, the deacons, the trustees. That
[1:34:12] means for the leoty, all the leoty,
[1:34:14] raise your
[1:34:16] hands. Every individual, all the
[1:34:20] individuals raise your
[1:34:23] hands. Every individual walks in a world
[1:34:26] with God alone. You're baptized into
[1:34:29] this kingdom and there's nobody in there
[1:34:33] but you and God.
[1:34:37] You see, he gives the orders and you
[1:34:40] pack them out. Whatever he says, there's
[1:34:42] not a shadow of doubt nowhere. You walk
[1:34:44] right on. If the Lord says this, there's
[1:34:47] nobody in the world can talk you out of
[1:34:50] it. You go right on just the same. Now
[1:34:54] you now you're coming into perfect
[1:34:57] faith, perfect perfection that cannot
[1:34:59] fail. That faith never fails. Yes, he
[1:35:03] was a mystic to them with his perfect
[1:35:06] faith. And so it is now with those who
[1:35:09] have perfect faith are a mystic to
[1:35:13] others. I looked up that word mystic. It
[1:35:15] includes a person who seeks spiritual
[1:35:17] insight beyond ordinary understanding.
[1:35:21] It's a person who believes in the
[1:35:23] possibility of attaining insight into
[1:35:25] mysteries, transcending
[1:35:27] ordinary human knowledge.
[1:35:30] You know what that means? This bride can
[1:35:33] come into a place that we're living
[1:35:35] beyond just our human senses.
[1:35:40] Beyond the trouble that's around us.
[1:35:44] seeing higher, seeing above, seeing, oh,
[1:35:49] that person said something cruel about
[1:35:51] me and for you've been losing the last
[1:35:53] month. You've been losing sleep over it.
[1:35:56] May you get in that room and let it lift
[1:35:58] you above it and say, "I'm going to pray
[1:36:00] for that brother or sister, but then
[1:36:02] it's between them and God, because I
[1:36:05] want to live higher than being affected
[1:36:07] by that."
[1:36:12] There's more in this word.
[1:36:14] go back and look at it again.
[1:36:17] There's a commercial that comes on
[1:36:19] sometimes and onto my my phone and I've
[1:36:23] seen it in motel, too. And this lady,
[1:36:25] she's this old lady. She's got this
[1:36:27] house and she's sitting there. I don't
[1:36:28] even know what company it is. I wouldn't
[1:36:30] plug their company
[1:36:31] anyway. But she's she's got her glasses
[1:36:34] on and she's struggling. She's sweating.
[1:36:36] She's nervous. She lives alone. She's
[1:36:37] old. She's wondering how she's going to
[1:36:39] pay all these bills. and she just And so
[1:36:42] then down way under the ground is these
[1:36:45] guys. They look like gold miners and
[1:36:48] they're down there and they're digging.
[1:36:50] They got their hats on and they start to
[1:36:52] discover gold underneath her house. And
[1:36:54] what they're trying to sell is basically
[1:36:56] she has equity in her home that can help
[1:36:58] pay the bills. It's an equity company,
[1:37:00] which is a trap, by the
[1:37:02] way. But if it was true that she's got
[1:37:05] gold under there, it's so funny. She's
[1:37:07] up here stressing out and they're down
[1:37:09] there and said, "This woman doesn't
[1:37:11] realize she's sitting on gold here.
[1:37:15] She's stressing out about her problems
[1:37:17] and how she's going to pay these." And
[1:37:19] she's got millions of dollars down here
[1:37:21] in gold. It reminds me of the bride of
[1:37:23] Jesus Christ. It reminds me of sons and
[1:37:26] daughters of God. You don't know what
[1:37:28] you have in this word.
[1:37:31] And they actually reach up and and they
[1:37:34] look up and they they yell it out and
[1:37:36] they say, "You're sitting on a bunch of
[1:37:39] gold." And somehow it goes through the
[1:37:41] floors and through the basement. And she
[1:37:43] hears something. She, "What was that?"
[1:37:46] There's a little voice. She couldn't
[1:37:47] even make it out, but they keep yelling,
[1:37:49] "You're sitting on gold. You're s You're
[1:37:51] fine. You're fine. You're sitting on
[1:37:53] gold." And she's still wondering, "I
[1:37:56] hear something, but I don't know what it
[1:37:58] is."
[1:37:59] Well, I'll tell you what it is this
[1:38:01] morning. You're hearing his voice while
[1:38:03] I'm speaking today.
[1:38:06] You're a spiritual billionaire.
[1:38:10] I don't care what problems you got. I
[1:38:12] don't care what cancer you have. I don't
[1:38:14] care what people have troubled you. I
[1:38:15] don't care what preacher has hurt you.
[1:38:17] That's besides the point of what you are
[1:38:19] rich in faith and hope and love.
[1:38:25] You're
[1:38:26] spiritual billionaires.
[1:38:30] I can't say it like him.
[1:38:32] Can you say amen? You're spiritual
[1:38:35] billionaires.
[1:38:36] And you're you're the the voice is
[1:38:38] coming up through the floor. Not coming
[1:38:40] up the floor. Coming from other
[1:38:42] dimensions. You're hearing from your
[1:38:43] theophony. I don't care what condition
[1:38:46] you're in. I don't care what state
[1:38:48] you're in. I don't care what your past
[1:38:50] is. I don't care what the devil has told
[1:38:53] you you are. I don't believe what he's
[1:38:55] told you are. Amen. Hear the voice
[1:38:59] speaking to you.
[1:39:02] You're rich.
[1:39:04] And there's more to this word than what
[1:39:06] you've seen. Go back and look at it
[1:39:09] again. Can you say amen? Amen. I'm rich
[1:39:12] in faith and hope and
[1:39:15] love. I got more than Let's stand
[1:39:18] together. I'll be moving to my mansion
[1:39:21] just over in glory where I'm a
[1:39:26] rightfully. I'm rich in faith and hope
[1:39:29] and love. I got more than my faith. I'll
[1:39:34] be moving to my mansion just over in
[1:39:37] glory where I'm Let's go up in the key.
[1:39:41] I'm rich in faith and hope and love. I
[1:39:46] got more than my friend.
[1:39:49] I'll be moving to my mansion best over
[1:39:52] in glory where I'm a rightful land. My
[1:39:56] father owns a cattle on a thousand
[1:39:59] years. Verse
[1:40:02] one, I stand amazed to see his face
[1:40:07] knowing that I'm his son. When I'm rich
[1:40:11] in faith and hope and love, I got more
[1:40:16] than I can. I'll be moving to my mansion
[1:40:20] dress over in glory where I'm a rightful
[1:40:24] head. I'm a guardian angel watching me.
[1:40:29] He'll go
[1:40:31] everywhere. But when I need my father in
[1:40:34] heaven up above, I pray just a simple
[1:40:38] prayer. I'm rich in faith and hope and
[1:40:42] love. Amen. I've got more than my share.
[1:40:47] I'll be moving to a mansion just over in
[1:40:50] glory where I'm a
[1:40:53] rightfully. He's redeemed and forgiven
[1:40:56] me of all my
[1:40:58] sins. He took me in. He's building me a
[1:41:03] mansion beyond
[1:41:05] convention. Hallelujah. I'm a
[1:41:07] millionaire. I'm a
[1:41:10] rich hope and love. I got more than I
[1:41:14] said. I'll be moving to my mansion just
[1:41:18] over in glory where I'm right singing
[1:41:22] one more time. I'm rich in faith and
[1:41:25] hope and
[1:41:27] love more than my share. I'll be moving
[1:41:31] to my mansion just over in glory where
[1:41:35] I'm a
[1:41:37] rightful. Amen. Thank you,
[1:41:40] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:41:42] [Music]
[1:41:44] Praise the Lord. Turn to somebody and
[1:41:47] say, "God bless you, brother. I'm a
[1:41:50] billionaire spiritually."
[1:41:52] [Music]
[1:41:54] Don't try to say it like Trump. Just
[1:41:56] say, "I'm a billionaire."
[1:42:01] That's
[1:42:02] right. Just before we sing it again,
[1:42:04] could you bow our heads and just raise
[1:42:06] your hand? go say, "Brother Paul, I
[1:42:08] I want to move past my past and find the
[1:42:13] victory." That's I asked somebody
[1:42:14] yesterday. I said, they explained all
[1:42:17] the problems to me and I said, "Okay, I
[1:42:19] understand." And I even see why it
[1:42:21] happened and understand it, but the
[1:42:23] question is, "What do you see as the far
[1:42:26] as far as the victory?" God's interested
[1:42:28] in the what will be the victory? What
[1:42:30] will be the end? And Christians look for
[1:42:33] the victory. It's not he who starts the
[1:42:35] race, it's he who finishes it. Can you
[1:42:38] say amen? I've had a rough time in the
[1:42:40] message. I've had I have some rough
[1:42:41] things take place. I understand. But
[1:42:44] what's the victory out of it? What's the
[1:42:46] character out of it? What's the forming
[1:42:48] of your character? What's the victory?
[1:42:51] So, how many raise your hand say, I want
[1:42:52] the victory over my trials. Amen.
[1:42:55] Heavenly Father, we pray together for
[1:42:56] each hand that was raised. And Lord, we
[1:42:59] recognize your your presence is real,
[1:43:02] Lord. that's among us today. It's to
[1:43:04] build faith in the people, to anoint the
[1:43:06] faith of the people, not by some
[1:43:08] emotion, but Lord, just something that's
[1:43:10] real. Something something somebody can
[1:43:13] get a hold of, Lord. And God, create in
[1:43:16] us such a desire to run towards you and
[1:43:18] not away from you. That we run right
[1:43:20] into that strong tower. That we run into
[1:43:23] that secret place, Lord. May our
[1:43:25] conditions not make us bitter, but make
[1:43:27] it make us better, Lord. Better for your
[1:43:30] kingdom. better, more filled with the
[1:43:32] spirit. Lord, I pray, Father, that
[1:43:35] you'll touch every life, Lord, in a
[1:43:36] special way. If there's sickness,
[1:43:39] physical sickness this
[1:43:41] morning, Satan, take your hands off of
[1:43:43] God's
[1:43:44] property. Release them in Jesus' name.
[1:43:47] If there's mental depression, Satan,
[1:43:51] take your hands off of God's property.
[1:43:53] May you release them in Jesus' name. And
[1:43:56] Lord, we commit this service. And Lord,
[1:43:59] the the the the residual, your word
[1:44:01] can't return void. So if we don't see,
[1:44:04] Lord, instant results, your word can't
[1:44:08] return void. May victories come. May
[1:44:11] overcoming come. May you put us in that
[1:44:14] little room, Lord, where you're
[1:44:16] developing us for a rapture. Grantite,
[1:44:19] Father, as we see, you're forming us
[1:44:21] into the very image of Jesus Christ. Not
[1:44:25] into the image of William Brandham, not
[1:44:27] in the image of a preacher, not in the
[1:44:29] image of any human being, but in the
[1:44:32] image of Jesus Christ. Grant it in my
[1:44:34] life. Grant it in these precious
[1:44:36] people's lives. Lord, may your anointing
[1:44:38] go with them. We pray. We ask it in
[1:44:41] Jesus name.
