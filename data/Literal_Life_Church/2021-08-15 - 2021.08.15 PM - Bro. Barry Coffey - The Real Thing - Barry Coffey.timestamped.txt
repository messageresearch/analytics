[0:00] and
[0:03] we're gonna go in chapter two
[0:06] chapter two let's just jump right in uh
[0:08] tonight and
[0:10] so great to see all of you here uh
[0:12] tonight i don't think it's fair we have
[0:15] so many wonderful ministers here
[0:18] and
[0:20] i don't know why i have to come and
[0:22] preach three and they preach none
[0:25] but it's it's great to be here
[0:29] i wanted to say and i i didn't mention i
[0:31] don't know if brother rapp is here
[0:33] tonight rap crook but we had rap and
[0:34] sister lee's beth down our way and
[0:37] minister to our young people are still
[0:38] talking about it they just certainly had
[0:40] a wonderful time with brother rap and uh
[0:42] it was real blessing for sure
[0:44] and uh
[0:46] i just wanted to say that i appreciate
[0:48] the the place uh you know the the church
[0:51] and the
[0:52] uh
[0:53] the capacity you have and the space you
[0:56] have
[0:57] i think it's wonderful it's a wonderful
[1:00] blessing to be able to have a nice place
[1:02] you can spread out i
[1:04] was poking some fun at the square
[1:05] footage this morning but i just wanted
[1:07] to say
[1:09] for the record that it's just a uh just
[1:12] a wonderful place and
[1:14] we're happy for you and the local
[1:17] assembly and uh it's just a
[1:19] real honor to be here joshua chapter two
[1:23] and um
[1:25] we'll read beginning at verse 10. this
[1:27] is a familiar little passage here
[1:30] and this is about uh rahab
[1:33] as she
[1:36] responds to the instructions at the
[1:39] spies give her
[1:41] and they're telling her that
[1:45] there is an invading army coming
[1:48] she knows about the strength of their
[1:50] god
[1:52] and she simply says to them
[1:55] uh
[1:56] how will i not be destroyed with this
[1:59] whole city when it goes down they said
[2:01] no problem just hang this cord out the
[2:04] window it'll be a token when we see the
[2:06] token we will not
[2:09] destroy this place
[2:11] and so she says thank you
[2:15] she says
[2:16] now therefore i pray you
[2:19] swear unto me by the lord
[2:21] since i have showed you kindness that
[2:23] you will also
[2:24] show kindness unto my father's house
[2:27] and give me
[2:29] a true token
[2:32] give me the real thing
[2:34] because this is life or death
[2:37] right if it isn't if it isn't right i'm
[2:39] going to die
[2:40] so i'm going to make sure i got the
[2:41] right thing
[2:44] so she
[2:45] she's passionate when she says this i
[2:48] want to have
[2:49] the right thing how many of you would
[2:50] like to have the right thing
[2:54] lord jesus bless our time together it's
[2:57] in your hands
[2:58] i pray that you administer lord to each
[3:00] and every heart
[3:02] and lord you know what we have need of
[3:06] and the ability of the holy spirit
[3:08] includes
[3:10] the way that you can take the word and
[3:12] you can apply it to everyone here we can
[3:14] all get something even a little
[3:15] different from it
[3:16] but we all walk away satisfied only you
[3:19] can do that
[3:20] we pray now that you would just take
[3:22] complete control of every spirit
[3:24] including my own that your holy spirit
[3:26] may have preeminence among us we give
[3:28] you the evening in the name of jesus
[3:30] christ we pray amen you may be seated
[3:34] god bless you
[3:40] this is exactly what
[3:44] what
[3:45] rahab said
[3:46] to these spies she wanted to know
[3:52] exactly what the right requirement would
[3:54] be and roth the right thing would would
[3:56] be for her to have
[3:58] i think it is a really critical thing
[4:00] for us and i mean this is the way i feel
[4:02] about it i've labored a lot of years in
[4:04] in serving the lord and not begrudging
[4:07] any of it uh i've loved doing what i've
[4:10] had to do over these years and uh
[4:12] serving the lord ministering ministering
[4:14] to these people around the world and uh
[4:16] still wake up every day and look for new
[4:17] opportunities to do that i think it's
[4:19] wonderful i think it's a great thing but
[4:21] you know at the end of the road i want
[4:22] to make sure my ladder is leaning
[4:23] against the right wall
[4:26] i don't want to miss it
[4:29] i i i want to be i want to be believing
[4:31] the right thing i want to be doing the
[4:32] right thing i want to be in the right
[4:34] place
[4:35] i want to be on time i want to make sure
[4:38] i'm dressed right i want to make sure
[4:40] that everything is correct i want to
[4:41] have the real thing
[4:43] i just don't want to have something i
[4:44] want to have the real thing
[4:47] because we're going to leave all of this
[4:48] behind and we're uh you know we're going
[4:51] to a place and it's life or death right
[4:54] you either go and live forever or you
[4:56] stay and go through the tribulation with
[4:59] everybody else that's left here on the
[5:00] earth so it's come down to this kind of
[5:03] a choice that rahab also had to make and
[5:06] and you know the question she asked
[5:08] you're you're telling me that i need to
[5:10] just display this token uh yes and she
[5:13] said make sure then you give me a real
[5:15] token
[5:16] i want to have the real thing
[5:18] now we talk a lot in in meetings and uh
[5:21] i was just recently at a youth meeting
[5:24] and we had a minister there and he was
[5:26] just very uh gifted in his evangelistic
[5:29] way very you all know who it is if i
[5:31] told you his name uh and he was just you
[5:35] know very
[5:36] passionate about
[5:39] talking about the holy ghost and
[5:41] encouraging the young people to come and
[5:42] receive the holy spirit and i i just
[5:45] felt in my heart before i went to that
[5:47] meeting because the pastor asked me to
[5:49] come and
[5:50] minister as well and he he was
[5:52] interested in helping the young people
[5:54] to know what it means actually to have
[5:56] the holy ghost like what what does the
[5:57] holy ghost do in me after the meeting's
[5:59] over and i go home what happens then
[6:02] what's step number one step number two
[6:03] step number three and if we get the real
[6:06] thing in the meeting what does the real
[6:07] thing accomplish in me
[6:09] and he was he was talking that way to me
[6:12] and so i began to think about this whole
[6:14] idea the real thing and uh i i phrased
[6:18] this or you know i framed this this
[6:21] meeting in a couple of questions here is
[6:24] uh the holy ghost different than the
[6:26] token
[6:27] and what is the evidence of the real
[6:29] thing if i if i uh have the real thing
[6:32] how's it gonna show up how am i gonna
[6:35] know and then when is a person saved
[6:37] they asked brother branham that question
[6:38] when is the person saved and he gave a
[6:40] fantastic answer uh to the question and
[6:43] he went down through the steps of
[6:45] salvation and uh it's really good
[6:47] whenever
[6:48] we have a baptism in our church i always
[6:50] print out the answer to that question he
[6:52] gave and give it to somebody because it
[6:55] really explains well
[6:57] what it means to be saved and then what
[6:59] outward signs will a person show now
[7:01] there's lots more we could talk about in
[7:03] relation to this subject and we have
[7:05] lots of fine ministers here i'm sure
[7:07] could add their part but i i wanted to
[7:09] just share some things that i trust will
[7:12] be a blessing to you tonight now
[7:14] uh brother branham makes this statement
[7:17] in 1950 and he says on the day of
[7:18] pentecost peter said it's for you and
[7:20] your children and to them that's a far
[7:22] off even as many as the lord our god
[7:23] shall call every person that enters into
[7:26] the baptism of the holy spirit can have
[7:28] the same kind of holy spirit that they
[7:30] got on the day of pentecost
[7:32] oh hang on
[7:33] let me say it again you probably didn't
[7:35] hear me every person that enters into
[7:37] the baptism of the spirit can have the
[7:39] same kind of holy ghost that they got on
[7:42] the day of pentecost
[7:45] that's better
[7:47] this is not another spirit this is not
[7:50] another different kind of salvation this
[7:52] is not another version of it here this
[7:55] is not some modernized version this is
[7:57] the same holy ghost that fell on the day
[7:58] of pentecost that's the same holy ghost
[8:00] that exists here tonight
[8:02] the same holy ghost that they got you
[8:04] got the same holy ghost that they
[8:06] experienced that's the same holy ghost
[8:07] that we have tonight
[8:09] so this is this is a continuum this is
[8:11] the same thing that that's why you know
[8:13] paul brother branham said that uh you
[8:15] know hey if paul made it in i'm going to
[8:17] make it in because the same thing he
[8:19] preached that's what i preach over here
[8:21] it's the same holy ghost inspiring those
[8:23] two men of god
[8:24] and he said i believe that not something
[8:26] that looked like it but the real thing
[8:29] so i don't want to have something that
[8:30] looks like the real thing and acts like
[8:32] the real thing i want to have the real
[8:34] thing i don't want to have to feel like
[8:36] i got to be like this guy and i gotta i
[8:38] gotta uh you know react like this sister
[8:41] over here i wanna have the real thing
[8:43] where god deals with me and the holy
[8:45] ghost brings forth the same kind of an
[8:46] evidence and proof they had back there
[8:49] comes at the same holy ghost
[8:51] because it's not a different holy ghost
[8:53] it's the same thing and that's a really
[8:55] important thing for us to hang on to as
[8:56] we go through this tonight
[8:59] now he says in the great full gospel
[9:01] church let me give you a little theory
[9:02] here first of all and the great full
[9:04] holy
[9:06] why don't we read it right why don't we
[9:08] just go ahead and say we're going to
[9:10] read these quotes right tonight and the
[9:12] great full gospel church has become
[9:14] nearly a floor show
[9:17] this is 1957.
[9:19] this is 64 years ago i know that because
[9:23] i was born in 1957.
[9:29] wow
[9:29] who said wow
[9:31] deacons
[9:33] did you say well
[9:40] the younger generation has no respect at
[9:42] all
[9:46] that's true 1957. you know what happened
[9:48] in 1957 america sinned away it's day of
[9:50] grace in 1957 but i'll tell you
[9:53] something else i wasn't living in
[9:54] america in 1957.
[9:57] now the great full gospel church has
[9:59] become nearly a floor show in 1957 we're
[10:02] looking at the advent of television and
[10:05] television evangelism
[10:07] we're looking at uh you know oral
[10:10] roberts taking the message now instead
[10:12] of in a tent but taking it in a
[10:14] broadcast and reaching not hundreds and
[10:16] thousands but millions of people who had
[10:18] tvs
[10:19] this is now
[10:20] big business this is now big money this
[10:24] is changing the face and the tone of
[10:26] evangelism in america this is really big
[10:30] business
[10:31] and so brother branham's looking at that
[10:32] in 1957 and he says you have so much
[10:35] hollywood evangelism now it's all about
[10:38] production
[10:39] now it's all about performance
[10:42] we've lost a little of this thing called
[10:44] worship and now it's become
[10:46] choreographed to the place where it's
[10:48] got to be just right and sound just
[10:50] right and they come in on cue and go out
[10:52] on cue and we're lacking
[10:54] what
[10:55] it used to be guided by governed by
[10:58] inspiration and now it's governed by
[11:00] ratings
[11:04] and here's brother branham saying that
[11:06] you've got hollywood you've got a you
[11:08] got a a if you're like a baptism of
[11:10] hollywood over this evangelistic move
[11:13] that happens in such an important time
[11:15] hey listen they have a prophet on the
[11:18] scene at this time that hollywood is
[11:21] pulling this entire evangelistic
[11:23] movement in the country away from what
[11:26] it should be into something else and
[11:28] here's a prophet standing here
[11:31] it should not be going away from that it
[11:33] should be coming towards that right it
[11:35] should be coming closer to god and it's
[11:37] not and he's watching it god help us to
[11:39] tear that thing from the pulpit and get
[11:41] back to the word of god in the true
[11:42] baptism of the holy spirit he says we
[11:44] need that here's a prophet looking at
[11:46] the age and looking at the direction and
[11:48] the momentum there or if you like in
[11:50] your terms he's looking at the trend
[11:53] this is trending away from inspiration
[11:56] this is trending away from the
[11:57] simplicity of the holy spirit and this
[11:59] is trending towards ratings and uh who's
[12:02] got the best program who's got the
[12:04] biggest following
[12:06] and he's looking at that and condemning
[12:08] that that's 1957. and i i remember i
[12:11] remember those years i remember the
[12:12] years that followed after that and uh
[12:14] you know we were catholics when we grew
[12:16] up but my mother used to like to watch
[12:17] oral roberts and the program and the
[12:19] music and everything else
[12:21] and uh you know it was it was really
[12:23] quite an extraordinary thing when i read
[12:25] back in later years here brother brandon
[12:26] i'm talking about that and so you want
[12:29] to in other words brother ban i'm saying
[12:31] you want to let god do this you don't
[12:33] want to let hollywood take over here you
[12:34] want to let god do this
[12:36] there's some things you better leave in
[12:37] the hands of god and not not let
[12:39] somebody else fashion this but
[12:42] let god do it let god inspire it let god
[12:44] grow it
[12:46] let god grow it
[12:48] let god fashion this thing
[12:50] and then we find in exodus chapter 20
[12:52] here a similar scripture which may may
[12:55] seem a little bit unusual but
[12:56] god said if thou will make and alt me an
[12:59] altar of stone thou shall not built it
[13:01] of human stone
[13:02] for if thou lift up thy tool upon it
[13:04] thou hast polluted it when when i build
[13:07] an altar i want to take the stones
[13:09] myself and these are rough stones and i
[13:12] want to fashion them myself
[13:14] i don't want to take somebody else's
[13:15] work and refashion that i want to take
[13:18] this stone and i want to work on it
[13:20] myself and that's what god said don't
[13:22] take up stones that are already hewn
[13:24] they've already got a they've already
[13:25] got a shape to them they've already got
[13:26] a way about them don't take those up but
[13:28] just go get the rough stones and bring
[13:31] them and put them and make my altar out
[13:33] of that and you know what i i believe
[13:35] with all my heart that that in this age
[13:37] i believe that god is after the same
[13:39] thing he doesn't want you to take your
[13:41] ideas and your ideas and your ideas and
[13:43] bring them into the house of god he
[13:44] wants to take you in your roughness and
[13:47] in your uh
[13:48] in your innocence and he wants to take
[13:50] that and begin to fashion you himself he
[13:53] wants to mold you himself he wants to
[13:55] shape you in a certain way and he
[13:57] doesn't want you to come and say well
[13:59] i've already been shaped i've already
[14:00] done that i already know that already he
[14:02] doesn't want that at all he wants to
[14:03] take the rough material the raw material
[14:05] and begin to work with that and that's
[14:07] what he wants to do with the bride of
[14:08] christ he wants to fashion us his way
[14:11] he doesn't want to have hollywood work
[14:13] on you he doesn't want to have the world
[14:14] work on you he wants to work on you
[14:16] himself that's the work of the holy
[14:18] spirit to do that internally
[14:20] let me just graphically portray this
[14:22] real quickly
[14:23] this is this is the condition we were
[14:25] all in we're all born in sin shaped
[14:27] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[14:29] our sins separated us from god
[14:32] but we need we need to respond to that
[14:34] and people respond to it in different
[14:35] ways some people feel like if i do
[14:37] enough good deeds i'll make it or if i
[14:40] live a moral life i'll do it if i go to
[14:42] church i'll do it if i give enough money
[14:44] then i'll make it across but people in
[14:46] their dealings with this they find they
[14:48] fall short
[14:50] right because there are not enough good
[14:52] deeds to get you across the chasm
[14:54] they're not
[14:55] they're not enough strict standards for
[14:57] you to live by that you can get across
[14:59] the chasm none of us could make it
[15:01] across but you know there's still people
[15:03] trying to get across that chasm outside
[15:05] of christ
[15:06] but the good news is that jesus christ
[15:09] stepped into that into that gap into
[15:11] that breach and made a way for us he
[15:13] became the goal and we are to put our
[15:15] faith in him and our trust in him so
[15:17] that uh we can we can say it's not just
[15:21] me now but it's you and christ as
[15:23] persons together it's the holy spirit
[15:25] his life same one that fell on the day
[15:26] of pentecost working his own life
[15:28] through you that's really what this is
[15:30] isn't it it's you and christ as persons
[15:33] together the holy spirit his life his
[15:36] actual life in you working together to
[15:38] make you what you what you're
[15:40] predestinated to be and it's for
[15:42] everybody it's not another holy spirit
[15:44] it's the same holy spirit that
[15:46] transformed paul that's the same spirit
[15:48] that transformed brother branham that's
[15:50] the same spirit that's at work in you
[15:54] making you what he's predestinated you
[15:56] to be
[15:57] right
[15:58] everybody together
[16:00] that's salvation this is salvation 101
[16:03] and then god created us to enjoy a
[16:05] personal relationship with him and have
[16:07] a purpose in life
[16:08] that's what god wanted that's what we
[16:10] all want us to have a purpose in life
[16:12] when i have a reason to live
[16:15] we want to have
[16:17] we want to live in the perfect will of
[16:19] god
[16:20] but it'll never mean anything to you
[16:22] until you are a witness of the
[16:24] resurrection of jesus christ by the
[16:26] infilling of the power of the holy
[16:27] spirit
[16:28] it'll never mean it'll really be just
[16:30] someone else's word
[16:32] and if you're convinced of it let me
[16:34] tell you there come a time when somebody
[16:35] who's smarter than you will convince you
[16:37] of something else
[16:39] you need to have more than just an uh
[16:41] you know an an understanding here like
[16:43] they sang tonight you got to let it drop
[16:44] from your head to your heart it's got to
[16:46] be something that's real that you cannot
[16:48] you can't nobody can separate it from
[16:49] you
[16:50] been there done that you know try
[16:52] something else because this is real to
[16:54] me it's it's not something that i i just
[16:57] i learn by sitting in the pew and
[16:59] associating with message people uh just
[17:01] in the same way that if you go out and
[17:02] live in the forest doesn't mean you're a
[17:04] tree if you come to a message church
[17:06] doesn't mean you're a believer you
[17:08] you're born a believer right
[17:10] no no one has ever been able to join the
[17:12] coffee family the everyone is a part of
[17:15] it has been born into it and we've tried
[17:17] to find ways out but nobody can come
[17:20] into it unless you're born a coffee
[17:21] because that's the way families operate
[17:25] and it'll really never mean anything to
[17:27] you permanent or eternal until you're a
[17:29] witness of the resurrection yourself and
[17:32] you experience this new birth
[17:36] all right so that's that's you know all
[17:38] of that i said so far all of that's why
[17:40] i said it fast
[17:43] so let me throw something at you here
[17:47] i love this little story
[17:49] and
[17:51] the the scriptures that follow here then
[17:53] came the jews round about him and said
[17:55] unto him how long does that make us to
[17:56] doubt if thou be the christ tell us
[17:58] plainly and jesus answered and said i
[18:01] told you and you believe not the works
[18:03] that i do in my father's name they bear
[18:05] witness of me
[18:07] the reason we are where we are
[18:10] in terms of
[18:12] part of the body of christ is not
[18:13] because of what you've done but because
[18:15] of who he predestinated
[18:18] we're held by election
[18:20] we're not held by conduct
[18:22] you didn't make it into this by conduct
[18:25] you're held by election
[18:27] you're brought here by election
[18:29] come on you're brought here by what god
[18:31] decided before the foundation of the
[18:32] world
[18:34] you just woke up to the fact that you're
[18:36] not going to go to hell with the rest of
[18:37] the world you you realize you're son or
[18:39] daughter of god more than just a son and
[18:41] a daughter of your parents
[18:43] and and it's election that we thank god
[18:45] for it's election and and the grace of
[18:47] god that has found us and and not only
[18:49] that but this election in verse 28 it
[18:52] assures you that nobody is going to
[18:54] pluck you out of out of his hand there's
[18:56] not enough power there's not enough
[18:57] forces in the world to pluck you out of
[18:59] his hand
[19:01] and so if he predestinated you and he
[19:03] holds you there's nobody can unhold you
[19:07] do you believe that jesus says it again
[19:10] while i was with them in the world i
[19:11] keep them in my in in thy name those
[19:13] thou gave us me i have kept and none of
[19:15] them has lost
[19:17] save the son of perdition none of them
[19:18] is lost nobody can pluck them out of my
[19:20] hand
[19:21] absolutely not
[19:23] so therefore what rahab wanted was a
[19:25] token she wanted a thing that served as
[19:28] a a real representation of the real
[19:30] thing and they gave her the
[19:31] distinguishing banner uh that she did
[19:34] and you all know this this is the
[19:36] story of the
[19:38] of the
[19:41] red cloth that she hung from her window
[19:44] so brother man i'm asked the question
[19:45] what is the baptism with the holy ghost
[19:47] he said it is a spirit baptizing you
[19:49] into the body of christ it is a new
[19:51] birth
[19:54] it is the spirit of god coming in and
[19:56] filling you after you have repented and
[19:58] been baptized in water as an answer of a
[20:01] good conscience towards god
[20:03] what is the baptism of the holy ghost it
[20:05] is the spirit baptizing you into christ
[20:07] it is the new birth
[20:09] it's the spirit of god same spirit of
[20:11] god they had on the day of pentecost
[20:12] coming in and filling you and so now
[20:14] you're persons together with him i think
[20:17] it's a wonderful thing
[20:19] now
[20:22] i gotta if you don't mind i'm just gonna
[20:25] do this here
[20:28] so i can see
[20:31] on my side
[20:35] this is a really important scripture now
[20:38] i need you just to stay with me for
[20:39] another minute here in the theory part
[20:43] in acts chapter 13 it's a really really
[20:45] important event
[20:47] and this is where paul is at antioch
[20:50] and he's preaching there and as his
[20:52] custom was he would go into a town like
[20:53] antioch and there were no christian
[20:55] churches there were no believers
[20:56] churches in antioch back in paul's day
[21:00] so he would go to where people would go
[21:02] in the town when they visited and that
[21:04] is in the synagogue
[21:05] he goes in the synagogue and he begins
[21:07] he begins to talk he's got credentials
[21:10] so he's going he goes in and he begins
[21:12] to talk on the sabbath day and the whole
[21:14] city the bible says the whole city
[21:15] together they came together to hear the
[21:17] word of god paul's got a reputation he's
[21:20] got a
[21:21] story behind him and so people come to
[21:24] listen they want to hear about this
[21:25] controversial person and when the jews
[21:27] saw the multitudes they were filled with
[21:29] envy and they spake against the things
[21:30] that were spoken by paul contradicting
[21:33] and blaspheming they were they were
[21:35] trying to undermine they were trying to
[21:36] undo the things that paul was building
[21:38] here
[21:40] and paul and barnabas wax bold
[21:43] and they said uh to the gentiles and all
[21:46] the people that were there they said it
[21:48] is right that the gospel should have
[21:49] been first spoken to you
[21:51] and he says but now you judge yourselves
[21:53] unworthy of everlasting life as a result
[21:56] of that he said lo we turn to the
[21:58] gentiles
[22:00] we're actually going to take this gospel
[22:02] we're going to take the word of god and
[22:04] all it contains
[22:06] and we're going to take it from the
[22:08] jewish people
[22:10] and give it to the gentiles
[22:14] now you gotta imagine there was a lot of
[22:15] jewish people who were listening to paul
[22:17] and just i mean
[22:19] uh you want to run that by us again
[22:22] we are the children of the prophets
[22:24] i can take you to the temple and show
[22:26] you who my father was and my grandfather
[22:28] and my great-grandfather all the way
[22:29] back i can go all the way back to david
[22:33] i can let you know that we are the
[22:34] children who have the covenants and the
[22:36] promises
[22:37] we are the people who still carry around
[22:39] the ten commandments on stone
[22:42] and now you're telling us that you're
[22:43] gonna take this from us which god
[22:46] bestowed upon us and you're gonna give
[22:48] it to somebody else who in the world do
[22:50] you think you are
[22:54] you got to imagine how they must have
[22:55] reacted to paul for so as the lord
[22:57] commanded us he said i have set thee to
[22:59] be a light to the gentiles that thou
[23:00] should be for salvation unto the ends of
[23:02] the earth he falls back on what god has
[23:04] told him in the beginning there and when
[23:06] the gentiles heard this they were glad
[23:08] naturally
[23:10] if you were a gentile wouldn't you be
[23:11] glad
[23:14] you mean
[23:14] everything that the jews were promised
[23:16] by jehovah now it's now it's ours and
[23:20] and they're catching on to this and they
[23:22] were glad and they glorified the word of
[23:23] the lord and as many as were ordained to
[23:25] eternal life believed because people who
[23:27] are ordained to eternal life they do
[23:28] believe
[23:30] right they don't they don't build
[23:31] websites against the message they
[23:32] believe people are ordained to eternal
[23:34] life they believe they love to believe
[23:37] it's they know what's right they've got
[23:39] to figure it out you know because they
[23:40] never figured it out god revealed it to
[23:42] them and that's how they know what's
[23:42] right and so people who are ordained to
[23:45] eternal life they don't they don't
[23:46] wrestle with this they just they just
[23:48] they believed and here's paul standing
[23:49] there you know with all these jews
[23:52] and the jews are must have been going
[23:54] like this you know with this with this
[23:56] face
[23:58] really
[24:00] really
[24:02] you think you're going to come in
[24:05] to our temple here and take all of this
[24:07] from us
[24:09] and give it to the gentiles really and
[24:12] paul just looked at them and said
[24:14] really
[24:19] now what this what this means is
[24:21] something really important
[24:24] what this means is something really
[24:26] significant because it changed
[24:28] everything
[24:30] it changed everything because now the
[24:33] promises that god made to jews that were
[24:36] unfulfilled
[24:38] now all of a sudden came to the gentiles
[24:42] there were promises of the old testament
[24:44] that had remained unfulfilled until now
[24:48] and
[24:48] now all of a sudden they were not the
[24:50] possession or the inheritance of the
[24:52] jews they were now given to the gentiles
[24:54] here's one of them
[24:56] this never happened in the old testament
[24:58] this was to come with the coming of the
[25:00] holy spirit
[25:02] right
[25:04] this never happened in the old testament
[25:05] this is what ezekiel prophesied and it
[25:08] never happened in the old testament but
[25:10] because the holy spirit could come
[25:12] and now perform this i will sprinkle
[25:15] clean water upon you and you shall be
[25:17] clean from all your filthiness and a new
[25:19] heart will i give you a new spirit will
[25:21] i put within you
[25:23] and i will take away the stony heart out
[25:25] of your flesh and give you a heart of
[25:26] flesh and i'll put my spirit within you
[25:29] show me where that happened in the old
[25:30] testament it didn't because it required
[25:32] the coming of the holy spirit to
[25:34] actually come in behind the veil and now
[25:36] be persons together with you
[25:38] you know what when ezekiel said this
[25:40] this was for the jews this was a promise
[25:42] for the jews to receive the holy spirit
[25:44] but they never received it and now at
[25:46] the point where the holy spirit is now
[25:48] available to come to the jews paul takes
[25:51] the promise and gives it to another
[25:56] me tell you saints of god you receive
[25:58] this tonight because paul came and took
[26:00] that from the jews and gave it to the
[26:02] gentiles
[26:04] one day it'll go back to the jews again
[26:07] one day it will return to them when they
[26:08] are restored but paul took that and gave
[26:11] it to the gentiles and now you have a
[26:13] new heart within you and you have a new
[26:15] spirit within you and you have you have
[26:18] his life in you because what was
[26:20] supposed to be given to the gentiles
[26:22] they were due to the jews they rejected
[26:25] and now god gave it to you so that's why
[26:28] this experience can be yours tonight
[26:31] because
[26:32] in the sovereignty of god he gave it to
[26:34] the gentiles
[26:37] wow this changed everything
[26:42] and i'll put my spirit in here and i'll
[26:44] cause you to walk
[26:46] in my statutes
[26:49] i'll cause you to walk in my word i'll
[26:51] cause you to walk in obedience to the
[26:52] word of god
[26:53] all right
[26:55] that
[26:56] we seem to have agreement on that point
[26:59] let's add this part to it if then we are
[27:02] filled with the holy spirit we're
[27:03] supposed to represent god in eternal
[27:05] life
[27:07] therefore you should be a walking
[27:09] representative of another kingdom
[27:13] we don't need more representatives of
[27:15] this kingdom
[27:16] and if you were a good representative of
[27:18] this kingdom you would be sitting there
[27:19] with a
[27:20] with a shirt on and boxes on it that
[27:22] said i
[27:24] you they
[27:28] look my problem is i drink coffee and i
[27:30] go into starbucks
[27:32] and i'm in starbucks the other day
[27:34] and i'm looking at this person
[27:37] and i'll be gracious
[27:38] i'm not being critical but i just don't
[27:41] get it
[27:42] i don't get it i'm looking at this
[27:44] person who's standing there and he's got
[27:46] i think
[27:47] i think it's a he he's got an apron on
[27:49] and on and he's got three lines i
[27:52] you
[27:53] and then they
[27:55] the first two boxes
[27:56] are
[27:57] empty this the third one is checked
[28:01] he's a they
[28:03] he has long hair
[28:06] and he has nail polish
[28:09] and he speaks with a really high girl's
[28:12] voice
[28:15] the challenge for me
[28:17] is to try to order coffee without
[28:19] looking at him
[28:20] because i don't want to have to try to
[28:22] figure out whether i should say thank
[28:24] you ma'am or thank you sir
[28:28] if you're a representative of this
[28:29] culture you're going to dress
[28:31] differently than what you are you're
[28:33] going to act differently than what you
[28:34] are
[28:35] right we're going to wear metal in our
[28:37] body if we're a representative of this
[28:39] kingdom
[28:40] right
[28:43] have any of you been out in the 21st
[28:45] century
[28:48] our our work i mean the people who
[28:50] represent our culture they represent our
[28:52] world
[28:53] they're they dress and act and and
[28:55] conduct themselves very differently than
[28:56] what you do
[28:58] the way you're looking tonight
[29:01] but he says that if we have the holy
[29:03] spirit we are to represent god in
[29:05] eternal life so therefore our lives
[29:07] should reflect the kingdom that we we
[29:09] are going to
[29:10] not necessarily the kingdom we're living
[29:12] in but the kingdom we're going to
[29:14] our father which art in heaven hallowed
[29:15] be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[29:17] done on earth as it is in heaven so let
[29:20] my life match that kingdom not this
[29:22] kingdom but let my life match that
[29:24] what what priorities god has there let
[29:26] them be the priority in my life the way
[29:28] god thinks let that be the way i think
[29:31] i'm not responsible for getting myself
[29:33] to heaven god's responsible for that he
[29:34] took the control of that but my job is
[29:37] to reflect a little bit of the character
[29:38] of the king of that kingdom
[29:40] because his life is in me
[29:42] and to shed and spread a little bit of
[29:44] of heaven on this earth
[29:48] now look the the guy was who was in
[29:49] starbucks there i i didn't i didn't
[29:52] say all of that to say that i would just
[29:54] want to make fun of that person
[29:56] if i could if i had a chance i'd like to
[29:58] say hey listen it's okay it's okay for
[30:01] you to be what god made you to be
[30:03] if you're if you're a boy go ahead and
[30:05] be a boy become a man be a real man it's
[30:08] all right it's all right for you to do
[30:09] that
[30:10] you the the cosmos is telling you you
[30:12] don't know
[30:14] imagine telling telling a boy he's not a
[30:16] boy then then boy actually wondering
[30:18] whether i am a boy or not
[30:21] and and you know you talk about
[30:23] confusion you talk about a perversion of
[30:26] god's intent
[30:27] god wants you to know who you are god
[30:29] wants you to have your identity clear
[30:31] god wants you to know that you're sons
[30:32] and daughters of god god wants you to
[30:34] know that you're only here temporarily
[30:36] you're on your way to your eternal
[30:38] destination and i have another body over
[30:40] on the other side our identity is not
[30:42] unclear our identity should be very
[30:44] clear
[30:46] but satan makes identity an issue in our
[30:48] time
[30:52] so we are supposed we are called to
[30:54] represent god and eternal life in this
[30:56] world
[30:56] we should conduct ourselves therefore
[30:58] like
[30:59] men and women like the bible said for us
[31:01] to do christian gentlemen
[31:04] men and women
[31:05] and i will tell you something that just
[31:08] because you have the holy ghost doesn't
[31:09] mean that life is easy and everything
[31:11] flows together and everybody's happy
[31:13] with you and pat you on the back
[31:15] doesn't happen at all
[31:17] matter of fact very seldom are times
[31:19] like that you're misunderstood a lot of
[31:21] times
[31:22] you're misrepresented a lot of times
[31:26] the way of a christian is not always
[31:28] easy
[31:31] i said this morning that sometimes you
[31:33] know we come to church and somebody's
[31:34] sitting in your regular pew and you're
[31:35] like
[31:37] really
[31:38] really
[31:41] the hardships that i have to go through
[31:43] in this church
[31:44] surely there must be another church
[31:48] let me introduce you to ed and iron
[31:50] judson
[31:51] great man of god
[31:54] ednard judson
[31:57] was considered to be america's first
[31:59] missionary he's the first missionary to
[32:00] ever leave our shores
[32:02] and to go overseas he was born in the
[32:03] 1700s 1777 i believe it was he's born in
[32:07] walden massachusetts 1788 it's right
[32:10] here
[32:12] who knew
[32:15] walden massachusetts
[32:17] adniram judson was a very brilliant
[32:20] young man by the age of 12 he was
[32:22] teaching an adult sunday school on the
[32:24] book of revelation
[32:26] because he was so learned in the
[32:28] scripture he was so excited he was the
[32:30] son of a minister he was somebody who
[32:32] was very much on fire and really had an
[32:34] understanding of the bible he was
[32:36] considered by his peers and by his
[32:38] teachers a brilliant young man
[32:41] the problem is that ed and iron judson
[32:43] even though he was around
[32:45] the the church in his early days
[32:48] he became uh to the point where
[32:52] he thought he was so brilliant he was
[32:53] actually more brilliant than god
[32:56] and he thought he was actually smarter
[32:58] than god
[32:59] and so when he went off to college and
[33:01] he went to new york
[33:03] he uh
[33:05] he was admired by his professors and so
[33:07] forth as being someone he was so
[33:09] brilliant and so smart that he could
[33:11] pick any career that he wanted to
[33:14] and he became a teacher an educator you
[33:17] know an intellectual
[33:19] he was very renowned even at an early
[33:21] age before he was at age 20.
[33:23] there was a story though that when he
[33:25] was in college he had a roommate
[33:28] who he roomed with in the first couple
[33:30] of years and his name was jacob ames
[33:32] his roommate was a
[33:34] new christian
[33:35] and ednard judson had such a
[33:38] a prowess
[33:40] in in scripture and such a handle of the
[33:42] word of god that he began to debate his
[33:46] roommate and eventually talked him out
[33:48] of any belief at all
[33:50] in christianity and jacob ames forsook
[33:53] the gospel
[33:55] and uh
[33:56] sided with with judson who is so
[33:59] persuasive in his way
[34:02] jacob ames
[34:04] departed from the faith
[34:06] years later
[34:07] ednard judson was still unconverted and
[34:11] he
[34:12] was in college in new york and he was
[34:14] coming back to massachusetts and on his
[34:16] journey on his horse
[34:19] he became really tired at the end of the
[34:20] day and he wanted to stop in a wayside
[34:22] inn
[34:23] and uh he went to the innkeeper and he
[34:25] said i'd like to have a room and the guy
[34:27] says i don't have any rooms at all he
[34:28] said look i'm so exhausted i need to
[34:30] have a room if you don't mind
[34:33] let me just take any place at all he
[34:34] said i don't have any spots at all he
[34:36] said listen you must have somewhere a
[34:37] closet or anything he said look the only
[34:40] room that i have is a room next to a man
[34:42] who's dying
[34:44] and this man
[34:45] spends his days screaming cursing
[34:49] uh
[34:50] he's in in incredible pain
[34:52] they said the smell that comes from the
[34:54] room is almost unbearable he's full of
[34:57] infection he's dying nobody knows what
[34:59] to do with him and the only room i have
[35:01] in the house is one a bed that's right
[35:03] next to his in the next room you can
[35:05] have that if you want judson said i'll
[35:07] have it
[35:08] took the room
[35:09] he listened to the man screaming for the
[35:12] first part of the night and about three
[35:14] o'clock in the morning the screaming
[35:15] ceased
[35:16] and judson went off to sleep the next
[35:18] morning he went down to the innkeeper
[35:19] and he paid his bill and on his way out
[35:21] he said hey he said what happened to
[35:23] that man next door to me what uh did he
[35:25] get better i heard that he stopped
[35:27] screaming out and he said no he died
[35:30] judson said
[35:32] he said what was wrong with him they
[35:34] said we really don't know what was wrong
[35:35] with him the doctors couldn't figure it
[35:36] out we really don't even know who he was
[35:39] except that he was a graduate
[35:42] of this particular university and his
[35:44] name apparently was ames
[35:47] jacob ames
[35:50] that's what the innkeeper told ednard
[35:52] judson
[35:54] the young boy's name was was jacob ames
[35:57] that's all we know we don't and we know
[35:58] he was from a college somewhere
[36:00] in new york but we don't know anything
[36:02] about him and when he said that judson
[36:04] just kind of stopped
[36:06] and he realized that this man now had
[36:08] died without god
[36:09] because of what he had talked him out of
[36:14] he walked outside the inn took his horse
[36:17] and began to go down the street walking
[36:19] the horse
[36:21] and in those towns back then with the
[36:24] cobblestone streets the horses you know
[36:26] they make a clip clop clip clop clip
[36:28] clop every time the horse
[36:31] made a sound with these hoofs
[36:34] all judson heard was hell
[36:36] judgment hell and judgment hell and
[36:40] judgment
[36:42] he walked outside the limits of the city
[36:45] knelt down by the side of his horse and
[36:47] surrendered his heart to christ
[36:49] he realized he had made a horrible
[36:51] mistake and sent this man to hell
[36:52] probably and he was the one who had
[36:55] caused it and he realized i'm destined
[36:57] for the same thing unless i give my
[36:59] heart to christ he was under such heavy
[37:01] conviction that he knelt down and gave
[37:03] his heart to the lord jesus christ
[37:06] a few short years later he got on a ship
[37:08] and he went to india he had such a
[37:10] burden for the people in india and he
[37:12] went there
[37:13] and uh he was
[37:15] misunderstood by the indian government
[37:17] and the authorities and they didn't want
[37:19] to have anything to do with him but he
[37:20] attempted because they didn't have the
[37:22] bible translated into their language
[37:24] judson had learned the language of india
[37:26] and he was attempting to translate the
[37:28] bible into their language
[37:30] the indian people did not understand
[37:32] that they threw him in jail and tortured
[37:34] him
[37:35] and he married a wife who he had brought
[37:38] with him to come to india and she died
[37:41] because of the horrible diseases that
[37:42] were there in the water and she died
[37:44] judson was in prison until the indian
[37:47] authorities eventually decided they were
[37:49] going to send them out of the country
[37:50] and they put him on a ship and sent him
[37:52] over
[37:54] in another part of the world just down
[37:55] the way and they sent him down to burma
[38:00] which is now myanmar which you hear in
[38:02] the news
[38:03] they sent him to myanmar and he lived in
[38:05] myanmar until he died
[38:07] he was so lonely he married another girl
[38:10] and this girl eventually died
[38:12] he married a third girl
[38:14] and this girl finally bore him a child
[38:17] he had lived in myanmar 23 years and
[38:19] translated the bible into
[38:22] bengali for the for the people of india
[38:24] he did it when he was in burma and he he
[38:27] lived in a
[38:28] ramshackle kind of a place in burma all
[38:30] of those years
[38:32] and he had sickness and he had
[38:34] he was living with his third wife and
[38:36] she had borne him a child and when this
[38:39] child was born him and his wife were
[38:41] both in jail in burma because the
[38:44] burmese authorities felt like he was
[38:45] preaching against the state
[38:48] and so they were taking his wife and
[38:50] they were sending her back to
[38:52] america and the only time he got to
[38:54] touch his child was when he reached out
[38:55] to the bars of the jail and touched his
[38:57] baby touch his infant and that was the
[38:59] only time he touched his child and they
[39:01] put her him on a boat or sorry they put
[39:04] her and the baby on a boat and sent her
[39:05] back to america
[39:07] judson stayed and he died in the jail
[39:10] he had a horrible disease and he died in
[39:12] the jail but he had completed the
[39:14] translation of the indian uh of the the
[39:17] the bible for the indian people
[39:21] when he died
[39:23] they put him on a ship
[39:25] oh sorry when when he was dying they put
[39:28] him on a ship and they were going to
[39:29] send them back to america and he died on
[39:30] the way
[39:31] if you go to walden massachusetts today
[39:34] mauldin i'm sorry missing my words
[39:36] mauldin massachusetts today there's a
[39:38] plaque there outside of a house and it
[39:40] says this is the home of ed and iron
[39:42] judson he was born in august 1788 and
[39:45] died in 1850 and this is on his uh this
[39:47] is on his tombstone malden was his
[39:49] birthplace
[39:51] the ocean is the sepulcher
[39:53] he was conv he converted the burmese and
[39:56] they are his monument and his record is
[39:58] kept on high let me ask you a question
[40:00] do you think that ed and iron judson had
[40:02] the real thing
[40:05] do you think ed and iron judson had the
[40:07] real thing or was he just in the in the
[40:09] in the faith because it was a popular or
[40:11] an easy thing to be in
[40:14] i believe judson had the real thing
[40:17] i believe judson had the real goods
[40:20] i believe he's willing to pay a price
[40:21] for the faith that he had
[40:23] now if you remember this the quotation
[40:25] that i just gave you here what brother
[40:27] branham said was that we're supposed to
[40:29] represent god at eternal life
[40:31] that is a life of sacrifice
[40:33] if you're in this for the easy way
[40:35] you're in the wrong thing
[40:37] if you're in this because everybody will
[40:39] love you because you're in it you're in
[40:40] it for the wrong thing
[40:42] adenaram judson was in it because he had
[40:44] a burden from god to be able to do the
[40:47] mission work that he did and to travel
[40:49] like he did and to spend his life like
[40:50] he did let me tell you that's the
[40:52] christian life everybody's not going to
[40:54] do what ed and iron judson did but i
[40:56] would tell you that is a christian life
[40:58] he made the statement he said if you
[40:59] succeed without sacrifice it is because
[41:01] someone else has suffered before you and
[41:03] if you sacrifice without success it is
[41:06] because someone will succeed after
[41:09] he preached in india and never had a
[41:11] convert for seven years
[41:13] he never had anybody accept christ for
[41:16] seven years and he knew what it meant to
[41:18] sacrifice if you succeed without
[41:20] sacrifice it is because someone has
[41:22] suffered before you and if you sacrifice
[41:24] he said without success is because
[41:26] someone will succeed after
[41:29] the hardship doesn't matter it is the
[41:31] vision it is the desire it is the burden
[41:33] that a person has that's what matters
[41:35] and that's what judson had and you know
[41:37] what he did he represented he
[41:39] represented christ on this earth he
[41:40] represented eternal life on this earth
[41:45] in our lives we really don't even know
[41:47] how to pray we don't really know what to
[41:49] pray for
[41:51] the spirit help us with our infirmities
[41:53] for we not know not what we should pray
[41:55] for as we ought but the spirit makes
[41:57] itself intercessions for us with
[41:59] groanings which cannot be uttered and he
[42:01] that searcheth hearts know it what is
[42:03] the mind of the spirit
[42:06] there's there's a higher power that lays
[42:08] within us that knows what the will of
[42:10] god is and that's why he put his spirit
[42:13] within you so that you would be guided
[42:15] by his spirit and not yours and you
[42:17] would be guided by his spirit and not
[42:19] the spirit of the cosmos
[42:21] and you would be guided by his spirit
[42:23] and not the spirit of your peers
[42:25] or some educator or somebody else but
[42:27] the holy spirit wanted to be in you to
[42:29] guide you so that you would know what
[42:30] the will of god actually is and then be
[42:32] willing to carry it out
[42:42] i believe
[42:44] i believe that
[42:46] the dynamic experiences that we have you
[42:48] know meetings and coming to the altar
[42:50] and having experiences with god i think
[42:52] those are very important
[42:54] i think those are those are
[42:56] wonderful experiences that we have
[42:59] but i believe there's more to the
[43:01] christian life than just an emotional
[43:02] experience
[43:04] at its beginning it isn't just one
[43:06] experience with god it is many
[43:10] now let me explain it this way you
[43:12] remember the story this is the man who
[43:14] is the maniac of gadara luke chapter
[43:16] eight
[43:17] and jesus sails over the
[43:20] the the sea of galilee
[43:22] i mean this is a pretty this is a pretty
[43:24] exceptional chapter when you read the
[43:26] whole chapter it talks about how jesus
[43:29] had multiplied the food on on one side
[43:32] of the the lake and then he comes out
[43:34] and the storm comes and jesus calms the
[43:36] storm and the disciples are looking at
[43:39] at him and you know what manner of man
[43:41] is this i mean we thought we'd seen it
[43:43] all
[43:44] right and wow look at this look at look
[43:47] at what what jesus has done now cut he
[43:49] speaks in the storms and the winds even
[43:51] obey him
[43:53] he gets off the boat and he goes up over
[43:55] the hill and this man is there this man
[43:57] is there with shackles on him and chains
[43:59] that doesn't even hold him he breaks
[44:02] those chains he's a wild man nobody goes
[44:04] near him
[44:05] he lives up in the mountains there where
[44:07] the where the swine are no villages
[44:10] there no houses there this man is what
[44:12] brother branham describes as a bad man
[44:14] and he said he lived in his house he had
[44:16] a problem with anger he had a problem
[44:18] with his temper brother branham tells us
[44:21] i don't have the quotes here but he
[44:22] talks about this man
[44:24] and as a result things got worse and
[44:26] worse and worse and finally he's out
[44:28] there
[44:29] completely out of control nobody can
[44:31] contain him he's out in the wilderness
[44:33] living in the caves and so forth
[44:38] and they
[44:41] the disciples are watching jesus
[44:44] he walks up over the hill not to the
[44:47] town but he walks up over the hill to
[44:49] where this guy hangs out
[44:51] and he stands there when he stands there
[44:53] this man sees him from afar off and they
[44:55] begin to communicate back and forth
[44:57] jesus what have thou to do with me
[45:00] and jesus begins to talk to him and
[45:02] cast out the demon you remember the
[45:04] story and he says he says who are you
[45:06] and he says i'm a demon i'm many and and
[45:08] these these spirits cry out and go into
[45:11] the
[45:12] the hogs that are there and they run
[45:14] down over the hill and they all run into
[45:15] the water and they perish
[45:17] and this man you can imagine the
[45:19] disciples nobody fell asleep in that
[45:21] service
[45:22] right they're all they just they just
[45:24] saw jesus calm the water they saw
[45:26] multiply the fishes and the loaves and
[45:28] they're looking and they're thinking
[45:29] what i mean what what else is there i
[45:32] mean why
[45:33] there seems to be nothing that jesus
[45:35] can't do and then they come to this and
[45:37] they see all these swine running down
[45:38] over the hill and they're all dead in
[45:40] the water there and this man is standing
[45:42] there the man that nobody approaches
[45:44] ever
[45:46] when they that fed them the swine saw
[45:48] what was done they fled and they went
[45:50] and told it in the city and in the
[45:51] country and then they went out to see
[45:53] what was done so all the people come out
[45:55] to see yava really and so they all run
[45:57] out to come where jesus is
[46:00] and they come to jesus and they found
[46:02] the man out of whom the devils were
[46:04] departed sitting at the feet of jesus
[46:05] clothed in his right mind
[46:10] and they were afraid that's kind of one
[46:12] of those biblical understatements
[46:15] is this for real
[46:18] and they're wanting to
[46:22] take out their cell phone and they
[46:25] they're wanting to get a picture of this
[46:26] guy so they can show because the people
[46:27] back home are never going to believe
[46:29] this
[46:32] and here he is he's sitting at the feet
[46:33] of jesus he's listening to what jesus
[46:35] has to say
[46:36] and they also which saw it
[46:39] told him by what means he was possessed
[46:41] of the devils he was healed
[46:43] the whole multitude comes out
[46:46] i want to say this to you tonight
[46:49] we needed to have jesus do the dramatic
[46:51] work of casting the devil
[46:54] out of this man because he didn't have a
[46:56] chance unless jesus did that
[47:00] but a true
[47:01] encounter with jesus christ
[47:04] will drive you to the feet of jesus
[47:10] you're not going to have one
[47:12] without the other
[47:16] look
[47:17] i thank god for the experiences that we
[47:19] have in the meetings and the you know
[47:20] the glorious meetings in the after
[47:21] service i i i'd never say a thing
[47:24] against it because i believe it is of
[47:25] god
[47:26] amen i believe it's i believe it's a
[47:28] good thing for someone to have an
[47:29] encounter with god where they where they
[47:31] have a
[47:32] time of repentance and pouring their
[47:34] soul out before god realizing they're
[47:36] lost but let me tell you if that's all
[47:37] we have i'd say this to you we haven't
[47:39] gone far enough a real encounter with
[47:41] jesus will bring you to the feet of
[47:43] jesus
[47:44] it'll bring you to a place where you
[47:45] want to now attach yourself to to this
[47:48] one that can teach me a new way of life
[47:50] that can restore things that can bring
[47:52] me back to my right mind that can set me
[47:54] in a place where now i can i can live
[47:56] among the community i can be i can be
[47:58] myself i can be real
[48:01] i can be saved
[48:02] tell me lord how to be saved but you
[48:04] don't have one without the other that's
[48:06] what i'm saying is that a new birth
[48:07] it'll cause something and that that's
[48:09] something it'll cause you it'll bring
[48:10] you right to the word it'll bring you
[48:12] right to the right instruction there's
[48:14] something in you that is quickened by
[48:15] the word of god that'll bring you to the
[48:17] word of god for the hour and they'll
[48:19] match together and there's just some
[48:21] kind of peace about that that you don't
[48:22] get anywhere anywhere
[48:24] if you can have an experience like that
[48:26] with jesus and go right back out in the
[48:27] world then you never really went far
[48:29] enough
[48:31] a real encounter with god will bring you
[48:33] right to his feet
[48:35] it'll put you in the right place
[48:40] people want to know about what the
[48:41] evidence is i'll tell you what and and
[48:42] you see people they'll they'll make all
[48:44] kinds of excuses why they don't go to
[48:45] church or why they don't want to be
[48:46] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[48:48] christ i'll tell you they may be good
[48:49] people but they just haven't gone far
[48:51] enough
[48:54] and this man he wants in 38. now the man
[48:56] whom the devils were departed
[48:59] they he they besought him that he might
[49:02] be with him but jesus sent him away i
[49:04] want to go where he goes i want to be
[49:05] where he is wherever wherever he's
[49:07] holding a meeting i want to be there
[49:08] wherever he's holding church i want to
[49:09] be there whatever he's saying i'm going
[49:11] to be there to make notes
[49:13] i want to hang around him i want to be
[49:15] there he says no hey you stay here and
[49:16] be a witness to your community and your
[49:18] family and you tell the whole city the
[49:20] things that god has done to you
[49:22] amen
[49:23] so now he becomes a witness to the
[49:25] community around him because he has a
[49:27] personal testimony of what god has done
[49:31] christian life is not always an easy
[49:32] life
[49:34] christian life is not always a simple
[49:35] life i will tell you something because a
[49:37] lot of people may not understand
[49:39] uh how you as a christian how you think
[49:41] how your how you you process things but
[49:43] i will tell you something that if the
[49:45] holy spirit is in you he'll lead you to
[49:46] the word of the hour
[49:48] and there's some there's a fortitude
[49:49] there's a strength in you that the world
[49:51] doesn't know anything about
[49:54] hey for a lot of years the devil has
[49:56] tried to stop the church of the living
[49:57] god for a lot of years the church has
[49:59] tried to vanquish the spirit of the
[50:00] living god in the believers of the word
[50:03] for their day and it has not worked you
[50:05] know why because it's not us it's christ
[50:07] in us
[50:08] and we have essentially greater is he
[50:10] that's in us than he that's in the world
[50:13] don't expect that the christian life is
[50:15] a life of ease but expect that
[50:17] christians are overcomers
[50:20] can i tell you about another missionary
[50:22] if you don't mind just one more it's
[50:23] perhaps my favorite is david livingston
[50:26] who
[50:27] lived in
[50:28] england
[50:29] in the 1800s born in 1813 in scotland
[50:33] blantire scotland
[50:35] when he was nine years old he memorized
[50:37] the book of psalms 119.
[50:40] and he just had a passion for the things
[50:42] of god he learned
[50:43] back in that day when they had the early
[50:45] printed books he saw pictures of africa
[50:48] and he said to himself in his heart as a
[50:50] young boy he said i just see the smoke
[50:51] of a thousand fires burning in the heart
[50:54] of africa and it just imprinted itself
[50:57] upon his own heart
[50:59] and he desired to leave he made three
[51:00] trips to africa at that point and he was
[51:04] uh in his journal he said lord send me
[51:06] anywhere but go with me is the only
[51:09] thing that i would ask send me anywhere
[51:11] only go with me
[51:13] in 1862
[51:15] livingston contracted yellow fever and
[51:18] he required medication in order to live
[51:20] in africa and have and be sustained
[51:22] during the time that he had yellow fever
[51:25] he married a woman whose name was mary
[51:26] moffat mary moffat became so sick she
[51:29] had to go back to london he only saw her
[51:31] one time after she got sick
[51:34] david livingston walked into a branch in
[51:36] the jungle that was cracked off and it
[51:37] pierced him in his eye he was blind in
[51:40] one eye
[51:41] he walked all over the place in africa
[51:43] and he was one of his re the ways he
[51:45] made his living was to make maps of a
[51:48] previously unmapped part of the world
[51:51] he only could do it with one eye
[51:55] at one point in time he was going
[51:56] through the thick jungle and the line
[51:58] fell out of a tree on purpose
[52:01] and clomped onto his shoulder
[52:03] and bit into the tendons in his shoulder
[52:06] and he couldn't use his left arm for the
[52:07] rest of his life
[52:10] livingston was a person who did not give
[52:12] up and he lived among people who he
[52:14] could not understand for most of his
[52:16] life because they spoke a different
[52:17] language
[52:20] and
[52:21] he preached the gospel everywhere that
[52:23] he went everywhere that he could find an
[52:25] audience he would preach the gospel in
[52:27] his path across africa
[52:29] and finally because they had not heard
[52:31] from him in england for so many years
[52:32] they sent dr livingston out to find
[52:35] stanley or sorry to find livingston
[52:38] and they said to him go find livingston
[52:40] we don't know where he is we haven't
[52:42] heard from him we're afraid he's dead so
[52:43] go find his
[52:44] whereabouts dr stanley was a very
[52:48] renowned well-known atheist and when he
[52:50] got the living studies he said the
[52:51] famous words dr livingston i presume
[52:55] he followed livingston for a couple of
[52:56] months and he warned livingston at the
[52:58] very beginning he said i'm an avowed
[52:59] atheist he said don't try your religion
[53:01] on me i have no interest in it. it only
[53:03] took three months until stanley gave his
[53:05] heart to the lord and followed stanley
[53:07] around the rest of africa
[53:10] and by the way when he said to stanley
[53:11] i'm warning you don't try to convert me
[53:13] he says by the way he says somebody sent
[53:16] me some medicine for you for yellow
[53:18] fever
[53:20] livingston had prayed that god would
[53:21] send him the medicine because he had ran
[53:23] out of it while he was in africa for so
[53:24] long nobody knew where he was and so
[53:27] therefore he had prayed and asked god to
[53:29] send the medicine he said lord you said
[53:31] that i could go i would go anywhere but
[53:33] you would go with me and he said i need
[53:35] to have this medicine in order to live
[53:37] and stanley pulls out the medicine and
[53:38] gives it to dr livingston
[53:43] in these later years when livingston was
[53:45] so
[53:46] old and so sick
[53:48] he would say to his servant he had a man
[53:51] who followed him
[53:53] everywhere and his name was chuma
[53:56] and he said to chuma he said take me out
[53:58] of my bed he said and
[54:00] set me up on my knees so i can pray and
[54:02] he would spend several hours a day
[54:04] praying by the side of his bed
[54:06] and there were so many people who were
[54:07] converted in africa by livingston over
[54:09] his years that he became renowned over
[54:12] the last especially the last portion of
[54:13] his life
[54:14] and when he died when he died i thought
[54:17] this was extraordinary
[54:20] chuma picked up livingston
[54:22] and carried him 150 miles through the
[54:24] jungle to the edge of the continent and
[54:27] put him on a boat
[54:28] and sent him back to england where he
[54:30] was buried
[54:32] chuma loved him so much and the people
[54:33] loved him so much but before they put
[54:35] him on the boat they did a surgery
[54:37] and they did a surgery where they opened
[54:39] up his chest cavity and took his heart
[54:41] out
[54:42] and they brought his heart back to his
[54:44] village and they buried it under a tree
[54:46] because they said the heart of david
[54:48] livingston will always be in africa
[54:50] and they put him on a boat they sent him
[54:52] back to england and buried him there and
[54:54] you could visit his grave back in
[54:56] england let me ask you something here
[54:57] tonight do you believe that david
[54:59] livingston had the real thing
[55:03] david livingston was not somebody who
[55:04] was deterred because somebody took his
[55:06] pew in the church he was not deterred
[55:08] because they ran out of uh pumpkin spice
[55:11] at starbucks in the day that he visited
[55:14] it
[55:15] he was not a person who easily was you
[55:17] know turned away from the mission that
[55:19] god had given him
[55:21] remember now what brother branham said
[55:22] if you have the holy ghost he said
[55:23] you've got to represent god and eternal
[55:25] life in this world that you're living in
[55:27] you've been given the holy ghost to
[55:28] represent him you have not been given
[55:30] the holy ghost to die again jesus
[55:32] already did that you'd have been given
[55:33] the holy ghost to try to conquer worlds
[55:35] jesus already did that let me tell you
[55:37] you've been given the holy ghost to
[55:38] represent another kingdom in this earth
[55:40] and to display christ through your flesh
[55:42] through your brokenness in the good
[55:44] times and into bad that's the reason
[55:45] you've been given the holy ghost and i
[55:48] will tell you that within yourself you
[55:49] cannot do that you cannot come up with
[55:51] stories like this about your own life
[55:54] it takes christ in you the power that
[55:57] keeps you and the power that holds you
[56:00] and livingston said if you have men who
[56:01] will come only if they know there is a
[56:03] good road i don't want them
[56:05] i want men who will come if there is no
[56:07] road at all nothing earthly will give up
[56:10] my work in despair
[56:13] if you have men who will only come if
[56:15] they know there's a good road i don't
[56:16] want them
[56:17] i want men who will come if there's no
[56:19] road at all
[56:20] and nothing
[56:22] earthly will make me give up my work in
[56:25] despair
[56:27] i'll tell you what saints of god i
[56:28] believe he was a real man of god and i
[56:30] believe he had this there's only one
[56:32] visible evidence and not one fleshly but
[56:34] it's all in the supernatural realm
[56:35] brother branham said it's the hidden
[56:37] force that's in you it's a hidden force
[56:39] that drives you to the tree of life it's
[56:42] a hidden force that's in you that drives
[56:44] you to an altar when you need to repent
[56:46] it's a hidden force within you that will
[56:48] drive you right to the marriage supper
[56:49] it's a hidden force that's in you
[56:51] that'll say amen to the word of god even
[56:54] when it takes your height off
[56:57] the holy ghost is given for you to
[56:59] represent christ in this world
[57:02] it's not given to you
[57:04] to make your life easy
[57:11] so this family brother branham knows
[57:13] very good family they come to brother
[57:15] branham
[57:17] and uh
[57:18] they asked him if they were not in his
[57:20] church but they were friends matter of
[57:22] fact
[57:23] uh this couple who came to brother
[57:25] branham the wife was actually a former
[57:28] girlfriend of brother branham years ago
[57:30] so he knew this family that we're
[57:32] talking about here in this little
[57:34] illustration
[57:35] and brother branham was approached by
[57:37] this couple at the end of service and
[57:39] they said brother branham would you come
[57:40] and pray for our daughter she's in an
[57:42] insane institution and she's going to go
[57:44] to uh
[57:46] the the procedure called a lobotomy
[57:48] after this and this this was rather
[57:51] primitive back in that day but this was
[57:53] one of the things that they thought
[57:55] could heal patients who had mental
[57:57] illness
[57:58] and so they came and they said brother
[57:59] branham tomorrow they're going to take
[58:01] her would you come and pray for this
[58:02] girl
[58:03] and uh brother branham goes in he and he
[58:06] tells a story he said he said
[58:09] before i got there he said this doctor
[58:11] came in this psychiatrist came in and he
[58:13] sat down next to the girl and he began
[58:14] to talk to her he said you mean you mean
[58:17] young lady she was about 18 years old he
[58:19] said you mean young lady you've never
[58:20] been kissed by a boy and she said no
[58:22] because they were raised in church
[58:24] and she said that one time in all my
[58:25] life you mean you've never had a little
[58:27] drink and been in a party and she said
[58:29] never
[58:31] and he said to her girl you don't know
[58:32] what you're missing
[58:34] now him being a psychiatrist he swung
[58:37] that girl's mind
[58:38] until now she has become so evil and bad
[58:42] till she don't want to even hear the
[58:44] name of jesus spoken in her presence
[58:48] so don't tell me there's not hidden
[58:50] forces there are forces that are going
[58:51] to try to swing your mind away from the
[58:53] things of god
[58:54] now watch what he says it's because that
[58:56] she turned her thoughts of christ into
[58:58] what that psychiatrist was moving her
[59:00] mind and he said and that's what we're
[59:02] here for this morning is to move your
[59:05] mind and your thinking from the things
[59:06] of the world unto the things of god
[59:09] which are eternal
[59:11] and that's what the preaching of the
[59:12] gospel is for
[59:14] is to pervert the thinking to a higher
[59:15] and a better in other words to undermine
[59:17] the thinking of the world and to replace
[59:19] it with a higher and a better a place
[59:21] where christ is until you become
[59:23] converted and then your mind reaches for
[59:25] those things that are above you'd never
[59:26] appreciate that unless you have the holy
[59:28] spirit in you that is satisfied by the
[59:30] preaching of the gospel and if you don't
[59:32] have it there are forces that are out
[59:34] there that'll twist your mind to the
[59:36] things that are contrary to the kingdom
[59:37] of god
[59:41] so see then that you walk circumspectly
[59:43] and not as fools but as wise circum is
[59:45] the word for circle in the latin
[59:48] speckly is the word for look so when you
[59:50] walk you're supposed to look
[59:52] all around to make sure that you are
[59:54] understanding what the will of the lord
[59:56] is
[59:58] if you're walking to a bar you need to
[59:59] keep looking
[1:00:01] if you're
[1:00:01] walking to you know a place of evil then
[1:00:04] you need to keep looking here
[1:00:07] there's a way that seemeth right on the
[1:00:09] man we are good at justifying our
[1:00:11] actions
[1:00:12] but there comes a point in time where we
[1:00:14] need to make sure that we are following
[1:00:16] god's will
[1:00:17] because there's a way that seems right
[1:00:19] unto a man we had to be very careful
[1:00:21] that we follow that right way brother
[1:00:22] branham said jesus knew what the
[1:00:24] father's will was
[1:00:25] and what a blessed privilege it is that
[1:00:27] we can know the father's will do you
[1:00:28] believe that we can know the father's
[1:00:29] will
[1:00:31] i believe you're in the will of god
[1:00:32] tonight
[1:00:33] and if we will seek god god will make
[1:00:35] known his will if we seek god
[1:00:39] and you know what that doesn't say it
[1:00:41] doesn't say that if we look up on google
[1:00:43] we will find god's will i i got news for
[1:00:46] you god does not need google he doesn't
[1:00:49] even have google
[1:00:51] he was around before google
[1:00:55] and he doesn't google
[1:00:59] we are a people in our culture who love
[1:01:01] instant feedback instant information you
[1:01:04] know you talk to people about something
[1:01:05] they don't know they're immediately
[1:01:07] oh yeah i know what that's about
[1:01:11] and we like that instant kind of an
[1:01:12] answer god does not god does not google
[1:01:14] he doesn't send his will by google
[1:01:16] neither does he normally write it in the
[1:01:18] sky but the way to find out god's will
[1:01:20] is to seek god and and god will make
[1:01:22] known his will over time god will make
[1:01:24] known his will but your part is not to
[1:01:27] figure it out yourself your part is to
[1:01:28] seek him with all your heart and seek
[1:01:30] him with a thirst that is a real passion
[1:01:33] of thirst to know what god would have me
[1:01:35] to do do you want me to be a living city
[1:01:36] do you want me to be a judge center do
[1:01:37] you want me to be a minister here do you
[1:01:39] want me to be a good student here do you
[1:01:41] want me to marry this girl or do you
[1:01:42] want me to go away to college what is
[1:01:44] the will of god the will of god is not
[1:01:45] the same for everybody but i believe the
[1:01:47] holy spirit will drive you into the will
[1:01:49] of god and drive you closer to god all
[1:01:51] the time when you're in the will of god
[1:01:52] can somebody say amen
[1:01:55] i'd rather know that i was in the will
[1:01:56] of god if i never spoke to another
[1:01:58] person than to preach to 10 000 people
[1:01:59] every night out of the will of god
[1:02:02] i'd rather know the will of god
[1:02:09] i like the way tauser said it outside of
[1:02:11] the will of god there's nothing i want
[1:02:13] but inside of the will of god there's
[1:02:15] nothing i fear
[1:02:18] outside of the will of god there's
[1:02:19] nothing i want inside the will of god
[1:02:21] there's nothing i fear
[1:02:24] the will of god is the thing that abides
[1:02:26] forever
[1:02:27] and so therefore
[1:02:28] let me tell you it is it is a critical
[1:02:30] thing for us to seek the word of god
[1:02:34] now
[1:02:35] let me just let me just
[1:02:37] uh be pointed here just for a few
[1:02:39] moments here and these are some other
[1:02:41] you can have all of these all of these
[1:02:43] quotes and things
[1:02:46] after i'm gone how do we deal right now
[1:02:48] it's mine all right
[1:02:50] let me do it
[1:02:52] how do we deal with conflicting issues
[1:02:53] and how do we reconcile our feelings and
[1:02:55] thoughts and dreams with the mind of god
[1:02:57] and so uh you know there's there's
[1:02:59] things that you may feel to do what you
[1:03:02] need to know is that
[1:03:03] god's will
[1:03:05] and and there are things that we
[1:03:08] you know sometimes you get offered a job
[1:03:09] and then all of a sudden there's another
[1:03:11] job offer and you wonder which is the
[1:03:12] right one to do and you get accepted
[1:03:14] into college and then they get accepted
[1:03:15] in another college so which one am i
[1:03:17] supposed to go to because we all come to
[1:03:19] this place
[1:03:22] we all come to this place
[1:03:26] all of us know what this means right we
[1:03:28] come to a fork in the road
[1:03:30] we come to a place where
[1:03:33] the the the answer is not obvious
[1:03:36] and so they're they're really
[1:03:39] i mean one thing is for sure
[1:03:42] that god is not going to tell me what
[1:03:43] the will of god is for you
[1:03:45] god's going to tell you
[1:03:47] he's going to tell you when you seek him
[1:03:48] when you ask him that he'll tell you
[1:03:51] he might he might have me tell you about
[1:03:54] other people that have done similar
[1:03:55] things but that's not you he he wants to
[1:03:58] deal with you he wants to deal with your
[1:03:59] heart and he wants you to deal with it
[1:04:01] because he doesn't want me to talk you
[1:04:02] into the will of god because if it
[1:04:03] doesn't work out right or it becomes not
[1:04:05] so easy or you poke your eye out with a
[1:04:06] branch you're going to go back and say
[1:04:08] but brother barry you told me to go to
[1:04:09] africa
[1:04:14] god wants you to be convinced that the
[1:04:16] will of god god wants you to have that
[1:04:17] burning in your heart and say i know
[1:04:18] this is what god wants me to do
[1:04:21] and i tell you what if god wants you to
[1:04:23] do something you'll not be turned away
[1:04:24] at the first sign of hardship or the
[1:04:26] first sign of difficulty i believe that
[1:04:28] a person who has the will of god has it
[1:04:30] burning within their heart they'll
[1:04:31] continue to do it no matter how
[1:04:32] difficult it gets so the idea is for us
[1:04:35] to walk in the light as god is in the
[1:04:37] light
[1:04:39] and when you walk in the light then you
[1:04:40] have fellowship one with another and the
[1:04:42] blood of jesus christ cleanses us from
[1:04:43] all sin do you realize this is a really
[1:04:45] critical time for you to be and remain
[1:04:47] under the blood of jesus christ because
[1:04:49] we live in a very dirty world we live in
[1:04:51] a very filthy time and so therefore it's
[1:04:54] very important for us to remain in
[1:04:55] fellowship with god
[1:04:57] because when you do the will of god let
[1:04:59] me tell you this woman did what she did
[1:05:00] to jesus and poured the oil all over
[1:05:02] jesus feet
[1:05:04] and when jesus left he had the oil on
[1:05:05] him and he had the smell with him but
[1:05:07] because she was doing the will of god as
[1:05:09] a matter of fact jesus said don't stop
[1:05:10] her
[1:05:11] don't stop her let her continue to let
[1:05:13] her let her do it let her do it and
[1:05:15] wherever the gospel is preached
[1:05:18] wherever the gospel is preached this
[1:05:19] story will be told of this woman
[1:05:23] and you know what she did this not to
[1:05:25] become some well-known person through
[1:05:27] the ages she did it because god had laid
[1:05:29] it on her heart here was one who was
[1:05:31] brother banham said she was anointing
[1:05:32] him for his death
[1:05:34] right he was she was anointing him for
[1:05:36] what he was going going to go through
[1:05:38] and she's led strangely by this force
[1:05:40] that leads her to the feet of jesus and
[1:05:42] rubs him with the oil that she has there
[1:05:44] and i'll tell you what even after jesus
[1:05:46] left the room and she walks out of the
[1:05:48] room she's got the same smell as jesus
[1:05:50] does she's got the same thing over her
[1:05:52] that he does because she did the will of
[1:05:54] god and that's the way that god wants
[1:05:56] you to react as well we're going to do
[1:05:58] it because it's the will of god but
[1:05:59] there's something that spills over onto
[1:06:01] the believer
[1:06:02] we don't do it for reward we don't do it
[1:06:04] for renown we don't do it for gain but
[1:06:07] i'll tell you what what she put on jesus
[1:06:09] was all over her as well
[1:06:16] you're at your best
[1:06:18] when you obey god
[1:06:20] you're at your best when you live for
[1:06:22] god
[1:06:23] when god says something
[1:06:25] and you're at your best
[1:06:30] you give me the thumbs up that means
[1:06:32] lunch is ready out in the fellowship
[1:06:34] hall
[1:06:36] i have no idea when we started
[1:06:41] full obedience to the will of god
[1:06:44] entitles you to the token now i remember
[1:06:45] now the token is the real thing right
[1:06:47] what rahab had was the real thing
[1:06:50] when they put the blood on the doorpost
[1:06:51] they needed to know that was a real
[1:06:52] thing i like here let me summarize and
[1:06:55] say this i want to have the real thing i
[1:06:57] don't want to have i don't want to have
[1:06:58] an experience because brother mike had
[1:07:00] certain kind of experience and that's
[1:07:01] what i got to do and he spoke in tongues
[1:07:03] and i've never spoken to the lord let me
[1:07:04] speak in tongues because that's what
[1:07:05] brother mike had and buttermike seems
[1:07:06] like he's really got it hey i want to
[1:07:08] have i want to have god deal with me
[1:07:12] i mean we're all made differently right
[1:07:14] i'm not like you you're not like me i'm
[1:07:16] not like brother paul and i thank god
[1:07:17] every day but i will tell you this
[1:07:20] the best thing for you to do is to walk
[1:07:21] in full obedience to the whole word of
[1:07:23] god and that will entitle you to the
[1:07:25] token
[1:07:27] you will never walk in obedience to
[1:07:29] something you don't understand
[1:07:31] you ought to pray and ask god to give
[1:07:32] you the understanding of the word of god
[1:07:36] and if you don't know what you have
[1:07:37] you'll never write checks on your
[1:07:39] account
[1:07:43] full obedience will give you an
[1:07:44] understanding of the word of god and if
[1:07:45] you don't know what you have you'll
[1:07:46] never use it
[1:07:50] but an absolute brother brother braham
[1:07:52] says it this way that's what god wants
[1:07:54] it's not a borderline halfway thing but
[1:07:55] it's an absolute full surrender
[1:07:58] an absolute full surrender to the
[1:08:00] kingdom of god that's what he's
[1:08:08] after so this is where i'm supposed to
[1:08:10] tell you an inspiring story and wrap it
[1:08:12] up and have everybody go whoa yay
[1:08:14] brother
[1:08:15] great guy
[1:08:21] i love this story
[1:08:25] back in the world into world war ii
[1:08:28] the germans figured out that we're going
[1:08:30] to win this war by air superiority
[1:08:33] they invested heavily in
[1:08:35] air power
[1:08:37] building planes that were fast that
[1:08:39] could get in over london drop bombs and
[1:08:41] get out back to safety
[1:08:43] it was a big deal for hitler and his
[1:08:46] minions to develop air power
[1:08:51] winston churchill woke up to the fact
[1:08:52] that if we're going to counter these
[1:08:54] guys and we're going to win the strike
[1:08:55] back we also have to have air power they
[1:08:57] did not have superior air power back in
[1:09:00] that day so winston churchill invested
[1:09:02] and told his people he says get at it
[1:09:04] get get it done boys we need to have air
[1:09:06] power we need to have planes that will
[1:09:08] zip in over germany hit the ammunitions
[1:09:10] factories hit the manufacturing plants
[1:09:13] hit uh you know hit the the strongholds
[1:09:15] of the germans and get back out again we
[1:09:17] need to have that we need to have it
[1:09:18] fast so they developed this plane which
[1:09:21] is called a spitfire this was a british
[1:09:23] invention it was a really extraordinary
[1:09:25] plane
[1:09:26] back in the day when they were
[1:09:27] testifying the plane and this is how
[1:09:30] they do test flying of planes they build
[1:09:32] a plane with bare bones they don't put
[1:09:34] anything fancy in it just the
[1:09:36] operational gear
[1:09:37] and if you get into a test flight in a
[1:09:39] plane there's usually only one seat lots
[1:09:42] of wires gears levers handles and a
[1:09:46] pilot will get in there take it up bring
[1:09:47] it down take it up bring it down he
[1:09:48] wants to see how the plane handles
[1:09:51] so on this particular day there was a
[1:09:53] pilot who was taking this spitfire up
[1:09:55] into the atmosphere and he flew at a
[1:09:58] certain height
[1:09:59] and he was
[1:10:00] putting the plane through its maneuvers
[1:10:03] and he was zipping around and carrying
[1:10:04] the bombs on it and he wanted to know
[1:10:06] how it handled in rough air this height
[1:10:08] that height and moving it around
[1:10:11] in his flying he's looking around at the
[1:10:13] plane because he wants to see how
[1:10:14] everything reacts he's got to give a
[1:10:16] report how this plane's going to react
[1:10:19] and how it all functioned
[1:10:22] in his looking around he looks back and
[1:10:23] he sees in the back of the plane it's
[1:10:25] only a little plane but in the back of
[1:10:27] the plane what does he see
[1:10:29] but a rat
[1:10:32] yes i said rat brother john
[1:10:36] not that brother john's a rat i
[1:10:37] shouldn't have said that
[1:10:40] but he saw a rat
[1:10:42] and he looks at the rat and the rat is
[1:10:45] doing what rats do
[1:10:46] and that is chewing on the tubing
[1:10:49] he's got a hydraulic cable in his mouth
[1:10:51] and he's just sitting there going
[1:10:55] chewing on the hydraulic cable
[1:10:57] the hydraulic cable controlled
[1:11:00] the uh the back sway of the plane i
[1:11:02] forget what it's called but he
[1:11:03] controlled the the that's the the
[1:11:06] hydraulic fluid what
[1:11:08] the rudder he had so he could not he
[1:11:10] would not be able to go left or right
[1:11:13] and so
[1:11:14] he realized that if this rat breaks
[1:11:15] through and the hydraulic fluid leaks
[1:11:17] out he's in real trouble there's only
[1:11:19] one man in the plane so he can't get out
[1:11:21] of the seat and go back and kick the rat
[1:11:23] he can't do that because he's only one
[1:11:25] man and he's sitting in the
[1:11:27] in the in the seat there and he's
[1:11:29] looking at that rat chewing on the tube
[1:11:31] and he's got him he's got to make a
[1:11:32] decision really fast
[1:11:34] he doesn't have anyone to consult he
[1:11:36] doesn't have anyone to help him he's
[1:11:37] looking back at the rat and he and he
[1:11:39] sees this thing he's got he's got to act
[1:11:41] right now you know what he does
[1:11:43] he takes the plane and he does
[1:11:47] straight up he points that plane
[1:11:49] straight up he reaches over takes his
[1:11:51] oxygen mask and puts it on and he goes
[1:11:53] straight up
[1:11:55] into a height that that plane is
[1:11:57] dangerously in a position but he's going
[1:11:59] straight up until he levels out and the
[1:12:01] oxygen in that part of the atmosphere is
[1:12:03] very thin and he looks back and he sees
[1:12:05] the rat goal
[1:12:08] fall over
[1:12:11] the rat couldn't handle that height
[1:12:13] without oxygen
[1:12:15] he could because he had his oxygen mask
[1:12:18] and he went higher let me leave you with
[1:12:20] this thought and say this that when the
[1:12:22] enemy when the rat in your life is
[1:12:24] chewing on your cable don't go lower go
[1:12:26] higher
[1:12:27] go higher with god
[1:12:29] the holy spirit will lead you higher go
[1:12:31] higher with god
[1:12:33] when you get in trouble go high
[1:12:35] when you get into it you got a problem
[1:12:37] you can't figure out when you get a
[1:12:38] problem and you're locked in your seat
[1:12:39] and you can't do anything about go high
[1:12:41] don't go low go high
[1:12:43] and you go high and you watch what god
[1:12:45] will do
[1:12:47] once that rat keeled over dead he could
[1:12:49] come back down onto the ground again
[1:12:52] the best thing you can do in life the
[1:12:54] best way you can handle the problems
[1:12:55] that you'll face in life and we all face
[1:12:57] them
[1:12:59] is not come down and try to reason with
[1:13:01] this rot and not try to come down and
[1:13:02] talk him out of it not try to come down
[1:13:04] and sort it out or hope you make it
[1:13:07] that's not what god wants you to do i
[1:13:08] believe i believe the the the invisible
[1:13:11] force the hidden force that lays within
[1:13:13] us is always going to drive us higher to
[1:13:15] go to god and say lord help me here i'm
[1:13:17] coming to you i'm coming to you i'm
[1:13:19] coming closer to you and that's what god
[1:13:21] wants you to do let's stand to our feet
[1:13:24] the hidden force in you will drive you
[1:13:26] to the feet of jesus it'll drive you to
[1:13:28] a higher place it will not drive you to
[1:13:30] a lower place and that's what the holy
[1:13:33] spirit wants to do if we could have our
[1:13:34] musicians come on slip up here the holy
[1:13:36] spirit will drive you it'll remind you
[1:13:39] that there's sometimes the only thing
[1:13:40] you can do is be
[1:13:43] be closer to him
[1:13:46] you may think you messed up may you may
[1:13:48] think well this this rat has really
[1:13:50] destroyed things in my life let me tell
[1:13:52] you something uh the holy spirit will
[1:13:54] will will just continually move you to a
[1:13:57] place that's closer to him
[1:14:00] in these last days that we live in with
[1:14:01] all kinds of rats in our world
[1:14:03] you be prepared for the holy spirit to
[1:14:05] lift you higher that's what services
[1:14:06] should be like that's what special
[1:14:08] meeting should be like it should be
[1:14:09] helping you to go a little bit higher
[1:14:11] hey none of us are without rats in our
[1:14:12] life none of us are without problems in
[1:14:14] our life and and things that if they
[1:14:16] could they would bring you down if they
[1:14:17] could they would crash you on the ground
[1:14:19] and you'd have no hope you have no
[1:14:20] recourse but i will tell you something
[1:14:22] the holy spirit never leaves you and he
[1:14:23] wants to bring you higher all the time
[1:14:28] let's pray
[1:14:32] heavily father we think about men like
[1:14:34] judson and men like livingston who had a
[1:14:36] vision they had a
[1:14:38] passion for the things of god
[1:14:40] i pray dear god that you tonight would
[1:14:42] just instill and inspire every one of us
[1:14:46] who have sat at the feet of jesus
[1:14:48] for many years the lord you would
[1:14:50] inspire us
[1:14:51] to go higher with you
[1:14:54] every day every day that we live lord
[1:14:56] every experience we have may draw us
[1:14:58] closer to you
[1:15:00] we want to be found in the center of
[1:15:01] your will
[1:15:03] we want to be overcomers in our time
[1:15:06] but lord
[1:15:08] all of us
[1:15:10] all of us need that hidden force
[1:15:13] to work
[1:15:14] to work strong to work loud
[1:15:17] to work
[1:15:18] truly in our lives
[1:15:20] we want every one of us lord i think
[1:15:21] every one of us here today would say we
[1:15:23] want to have the real thing
[1:15:24] we don't want to have a fake thing we
[1:15:26] don't want to have a message thing we
[1:15:27] don't want to have a lookalike thing we
[1:15:29] want to have the real thing
[1:15:31] and there's nothing nothing that can
[1:15:33] replace the real thing except the real
[1:15:34] thing
[1:15:36] so lord give us i pray the real thing in
[1:15:38] our hearts the may lord may nobody leave
[1:15:41] here until they are convinced they have
[1:15:42] the real thing
[1:15:45] maybe may they have that assurance may
[1:15:47] they have that confidence
[1:15:51] someone like
[1:15:52] someone like judson lord who would
[1:15:55] have such tragedy in his life and such
[1:15:58] torture and
[1:15:59] sickness and all the other things that
[1:16:01] he had in his life
[1:16:04] but he pursued the calling the vision
[1:16:06] that he had
[1:16:07] you gave him lord
[1:16:10] give us that kind of desire give us lord
[1:16:12] as as ministers that kind of a desire to
[1:16:15] to present the gospel in such a way that
[1:16:17] people would be drawn to it the lord the
[1:16:19] people who receive it they might go out
[1:16:20] and represent the kingdom of god in this
[1:16:23] world
[1:16:24] lord this world needs representatives
[1:16:26] from another kingdom
[1:16:27] they need a representation lord from a
[1:16:30] pure kingdom a holy kingdom a righteous
[1:16:33] kingdom
[1:16:34] this world needs that kind of a witness
[1:16:37] we don't need more confusion we don't
[1:16:39] need more religion lord we need truth
[1:16:41] and righteousness
[1:16:46] we need to let the world know that the
[1:16:47] holy spirit can still convict a sinner's
[1:16:49] heart and turn them around
[1:16:51] make drug addicts into believers
[1:16:54] and make immoral people
[1:16:56] into pure saints of god
[1:17:00] and lift their hands without wrath and
[1:17:02] doubting and worship the true and living
[1:17:03] god
[1:17:05] i believe the holy spirit can still
[1:17:06] transform young men that have perverted
[1:17:09] ideals and they can
[1:17:12] sit at the feet of jesus
[1:17:14] become real men of god
[1:17:17] that will carry the gospel
[1:17:20] in their community and into foreign
[1:17:22] lands
[1:17:24] this never was meant for one or two
[1:17:26] people
[1:17:26] this was never meant just for brother
[1:17:28] branham
[1:17:29] well lord this is meant for those that
[1:17:31] received the infilling of the holy
[1:17:32] spirit the same holy spirit that fell on
[1:17:34] the day of pentecost
[1:17:37] lord this was meant for all of us all of
[1:17:39] us have a purpose and a function within
[1:17:41] the body of christ
[1:17:43] these young people that are here lord
[1:17:44] that have come aside tonight and i pray
[1:17:46] that you would inspire them to go higher
[1:17:48] i pray that you would inspire them to
[1:17:50] reach out to you lord not reach down to
[1:17:51] the world to see what they can get but
[1:17:53] to reach up to you lord that they might
[1:17:54] be stronger
[1:17:57] give to us the real thing lord i pray
[1:17:59] nothing less but the real thing that's
[1:18:01] what we desire
[1:18:03] anchor it firmly lord in our hearts and
[1:18:05] we'll give you thanks and praise in

[1:18:22] opposition you'll go through lots of
[1:18:23] things you'll have lots of rats i'll
[1:18:25] tell you what the real thing is what are
