[0:00] and verse four and this is when they got
[0:02] away from god
[0:04] but then it speaks of redemption
[0:06] verse four for the children of israel
[0:09] shall abide many days
[0:12] without a king
[0:14] and without a prince and without a
[0:16] sacrifice and without an image and
[0:20] without an ethod and without a terraphim
[0:23] now i won't have time today to break all
[0:25] those down but just catch the simple
[0:27] theme the children got so away from god
[0:31] they didn't have a king anymore they
[0:33] didn't have a sacrifice anymore and all
[0:36] many of these things are elements that
[0:39] god gave the people to connect with god
[0:45] these are some of these are essential
[0:46] elements
[0:47] to connect with god and when they
[0:50] rebelled and got away from him it
[0:51] removed all of these connections to god
[0:54] that they were without any of these
[0:56] connections without a king without
[0:58] leadership without a prince without a
[1:01] sacrifice and like it was sung about the
[1:03] blood of jesus christ if we remove the
[1:05] true blood of jesus christ we're without
[1:07] that we are in trouble
[1:11] sacrifice was removed their king was
[1:13] removed
[1:14] but here's redemption
[1:16] just in two verses we see it verse 5
[1:19] afterward
[1:20] shall the children of israel return
[1:24] and seek the lord their god
[1:26] and david their king
[1:28] and shall fear the lord and his goodness
[1:33] in
[1:34] the last days
[1:36] in the last days
[1:38] father bless your word today ask for
[1:40] your anointing
[1:41] i asked lord once again as i was asking
[1:44] yesterday for many hours
[1:46] that lord you will put the words in our
[1:48] mouth as we step aside
[1:50] to minister and say those things that
[1:53] have power behind them demonstration
[1:56] behind them that the people's lives
[1:58] could find that channel that we could
[2:00] grow and know you in a deeper way the
[2:03] beauty of your holiness the beauty of
[2:05] your your presence lord that we could be
[2:07] changed by it may we leave here change
[2:10] people today and we commit ourselves to
[2:12] you may the families just have a great
[2:15] wonderful time with in this worship of
[2:17] christmas time
[2:18] lord may reconciliation take place with
[2:21] family members
[2:22] may husbands and wives draw closer may
[2:25] children draw closer may families draw
[2:28] closer lord into your presence god i
[2:30] just pray that you the great god of
[2:32] redemption and reconciliation will
[2:34] continue to do your work lord in your
[2:37] kingdom we commit it to you bless these
[2:39] families we pray in jesus name amen god
[2:43] bless you once you shake somebody's hand
[2:44] before you take your seat god bless you
[2:46] each one
[2:54] now i'd like to speak on seeking the son
[2:56] of david in the last days now this is a
[2:58] prophecy
[3:00] this uh this verse 5 is a prophecy and
[3:03] it's a prophecy for the last days
[3:05] because he said they will turn to the
[3:06] lord and david their king shall fear the
[3:09] lord and his goodness in the latter days
[3:11] that's the last day so this is a
[3:13] prophecy and many times things apply to
[3:15] israel
[3:16] they apply to israel yes naturally but
[3:18] they apply to us spiritually so this
[3:21] returning and this seeking david the
[3:23] king
[3:24] applies to us gentiles as well and that
[3:27] we will be seeking after not having a
[3:30] king after not having
[3:31] the sacrifice after 2 000 years of
[3:34] church history as brother
[3:37] brother branham makes some comments
[3:39] about how that church systems and church
[3:42] denominations actually thwarted the
[3:44] effects of the blood of jesus christ
[3:46] because when you tamper with the word
[3:48] you tamper with the blood of jesus
[3:50] christ that's the path to the blood is
[3:52] through the word of god and so after
[3:55] 2000 years of church systems they
[3:57] eliminated the holy spirit they
[3:59] eliminated the true
[4:01] power of the blood of jesus christ but
[4:03] when he said i'll restore the word when
[4:05] he restores the word then he restores
[4:07] the power of the blood and we realize
[4:09] people can come back to their the true
[4:11] atonement and so
[4:14] i think he words it in one place he says
[4:16] the seventh angel or the end time
[4:19] message is to bring us out of
[4:21] pentecostal and world traditions back to
[4:25] the genuine atonement the word of god
[4:28] so being we're being restored back to
[4:30] the word but we're being restored back
[4:32] to the blood and the atonement and the
[4:34] true atonement of what it is it's not
[4:36] denomination it's the the blood of jesus
[4:38] christ through the word that cleanses a
[4:40] soul
[4:41] so the message has come to bring it so
[4:43] now this is a prophecy for our day
[4:45] because we're coming back and and so
[4:47] there's the seeking of the son of david
[4:50] in the last days and so i believe that
[4:52] this scripture is being fulfilled
[4:55] even more than what we realize in the
[4:57] last few years we see this
[4:59] because you look at hunger and you look
[5:01] at what's on the people's hearts and you
[5:03] look at the decisions they make and i'm
[5:05] talking within our own ranks even people
[5:07] making decisions because they're seeking
[5:10] more of
[5:12] of what god has for them
[5:14] and if you look at the past conditions
[5:16] of people and what they have been
[5:19] through it's just amazing what people
[5:21] have been through
[5:22] it's amazing the stories of people i
[5:24] would just say it safely this morning
[5:26] that there's many sitting here this
[5:28] morning it's a miracle that you're
[5:30] sitting here it's a it's an absolute
[5:32] miracle that you're still standing that
[5:34] you're still coming around the word of
[5:36] god that you still have a hunger you
[5:38] still have a desire when you hear some
[5:41] of the stories you really shouldn't be
[5:43] here but there must be something within
[5:45] you that's connecting and wants to grow
[5:48] even more can you say man i've got to
[5:51] know my king even more i'm seeking the
[5:53] son of david i'm seeking this king
[5:56] because this ends up in a millennium
[5:58] with the son of david can you say amen
[6:01] this ends up with us the bride being
[6:03] with the bridegroom it ends up with the
[6:05] king i can i can i can take a prophet
[6:08] and i've accepted his prophet but that's
[6:11] the son of man ministry can you say that
[6:13] a son of man ministry is is a prophet
[6:15] can you say man and i've embraced that
[6:17] with all my heart but that's not enough
[6:19] for me i don't want just the son of man
[6:21] ministry i want the the son of david i
[6:24] want my king
[6:27] you understand it's the same person now
[6:29] but he comes in different offices
[6:33] but you can't just be satisfied with son
[6:35] of man
[6:37] he's the son of god
[6:39] which the brother brahms says was the
[6:41] holy spirit because that's invisible son
[6:43] of david is more visible excuse me son
[6:45] of son of man is more visible and he was
[6:47] that way in jesus christ then he
[6:49] displayed that again in the last days to
[6:51] the gentiles it was more visible son of
[6:53] god is not visible it's the holy spirit
[6:55] coming in his people that's the unseen
[6:57] person living in his people for 2000
[6:59] years we had that son of watching a
[7:01] prophet son of man is not good enough
[7:04] you have to have the same god as son of
[7:06] god you have to have the holy ghost
[7:10] a lot of people in the message think
[7:12] it's good enough and they'll go to the
[7:13] rapture because they believe god sent a
[7:15] prophet that's not enough you have to
[7:17] have the holy ghost
[7:20] but then there's this whole son of david
[7:22] which he's just as much son of david as
[7:24] he is son of god and that's what we're
[7:26] headed towards and so as we get closer
[7:28] to that i'm seeking more than just son
[7:30] of man i'm seeking more than just son of
[7:32] god i'm looking for my king
[7:35] i'm looking for the king's character to
[7:37] be displayed
[7:39] in his people
[7:42] and i just preached my whole message
[7:43] right there so we can
[7:46] i couldn't i couldn't hold back just
[7:48] letting it out
[7:50] and i look at the conditions of some
[7:52] people and what they're going through
[7:54] and but yet
[7:55] i see a desire very common in many
[7:59] people
[8:00] that are coming and staying close to the
[8:02] word
[8:03] no matter what conditions they're in
[8:05] there's a desire common in many and it's
[8:08] it's seeking out this king it's seeking
[8:10] to be in the presence of the king
[8:13] the seeking within god's people
[8:15] you know the within god's people they're
[8:18] seeking the lord and seeking the king
[8:21] doesn't stop with just salvation
[8:25] we don't stop seeking the lord after we
[8:27] receive salvation some of you
[8:29] were saved when you were a child maybe
[8:31] or maybe when you're 16 or maybe last
[8:34] year
[8:34] but we don't stop seeking
[8:37] after we get received salvation
[8:40] seeking the lord does not stop when
[8:42] we're sanctified can you say amen
[8:45] seeking the lord it does it doesn't end
[8:47] even after years of being in church i
[8:51] don't think our seeking the lord should
[8:52] end because we've been in church for
[8:54] years
[8:56] seeking is not over
[8:59] seeking does not is not over because
[9:02] deliverance is not over
[9:07] if we still need deliverance
[9:09] then we still need to seek god
[9:12] because there more is more of god can
[9:14] you say amen and when there's more of
[9:16] god when there's a deep call into the
[9:18] deep there's a deep to respond
[9:21] otherwise we probably wouldn't even be
[9:23] here this morning there has to be a
[9:25] seeking i hope you're not here for just
[9:27] a religious duty but i hope there's
[9:29] something in your heart seeking more of
[9:31] the king seeking more of god can you say
[9:33] that because seeking him doesn't end
[9:36] with salvation it doesn't end with
[9:38] sanctification seeking him doesn't even
[9:40] end after you receive the holy ghost
[9:43] there's more and when the deep is
[9:45] calling to the deep that shows there's a
[9:47] deep to respond somewhere
[9:51] and i would say and give us the benefit
[9:53] of doubt we're here and we wouldn't be
[9:55] here unless we were seeking him more
[10:00] and we're going to keep seeking
[10:02] they talk about these seeker-friendly
[10:04] churches
[10:06] anybody ever heard that seeker-friendly
[10:07] churches and they adapt everything for
[10:10] the seeker but it's all what they're
[10:11] seeking
[10:12] if they're seeking more rock and roll
[10:14] then we provide rock and roll for them
[10:16] if they're seeking more of worldly
[10:18] living and still sit in church and so
[10:20] it's a seeker friendly well
[10:23] we're we're the true seeker friendly
[10:25] church
[10:26] and for a soul that's hungry for god we
[10:29] preach the word of god unrestricted can
[10:32] you say amen
[10:34] and if you're seeking for more of god
[10:36] and and less of denomination then you
[10:38] need to come out of that nomination come
[10:41] out of religion can you say man and find
[10:43] the church that's truly seeker friendly
[10:46] it can meet the needs in your life
[10:47] [Music]
[10:49] that you're growing by seeking does not
[10:51] end because deliverance is not over yet
[10:53] your deliverance did not end when he
[10:56] delivered you from alcohol
[10:59] your deliverance did not end when he
[11:01] delivered you from cigarettes or
[11:02] adultery your deliverance wasn't over
[11:06] did you know that
[11:07] your full deliverance did not end when
[11:10] you received the holy ghost there are
[11:12] some preachers that preach us preach it
[11:14] that way that your deliverance was over
[11:16] but i'm here to tell you your
[11:17] deliverance isn't over and so you're
[11:19] seeking a more hymn isn't over and first
[11:22] corinthians 1 9 says if you guys want to
[11:24] pull that up first corinthians 1 and
[11:26] verse 9
[11:27] but we had first corinthians 1 and verse
[11:29] 9. but we have the sentence of death in
[11:33] ourselves that we should not trust in
[11:35] ourselves but in god which raises the
[11:39] dead first corinthians 1 verse 10. do
[11:41] you have it up there first corinthians 1
[11:43] verse 10 who delivered us
[11:46] from so great death so he delivered us
[11:49] from so great at death
[11:50] and doth deliver
[11:52] in whom we trust that he will yet
[11:55] deliver us
[11:58] he delivered us
[12:01] he does deliver
[12:03] and he will deliver
[12:05] your deliverance didn't end at just an
[12:08] altar one night or a camp meeting or a
[12:10] youth camp
[12:13] maybe we'll get into this the first of
[12:14] the year
[12:16] and
[12:18] just be specific
[12:20] if you're sitting there saying well i
[12:22] don't know what i need to be delivered
[12:23] from maybe we should talk about it
[12:28] because there's there's still things
[12:30] that don't get talked about a lot and we
[12:32] really need to be delivered from them
[12:35] maybe gossip
[12:38] maybe possession minded
[12:41] the love of money
[12:45] religion pride can you say amen but i'm
[12:48] a believer i have the holy ghost well we
[12:50] still need deliverance from things
[12:53] and if you've got them all covered
[12:55] the very fact you're still in this body
[12:56] shows you need to be delivered from this
[12:59] body
[13:01] so we still need deliverance
[13:04] and if we still need deliverance then we
[13:07] still need to seek god and seek the king
[13:11] amen so one thing today i'd like to lay
[13:13] down i don't know how much time we'll
[13:15] have but we're just going to lay some
[13:16] things down but one thing i was i must
[13:18] lay down when you see when you have seen
[13:21] jesus again as son of man as we have
[13:24] enjoyed in the last days we've seen him
[13:27] in his administration now for those of
[13:29] you who don't know those who be
[13:30] listening from different
[13:32] avenues of religions or denominations i
[13:35] just want to qualify and just say that
[13:37] jesus come in three sons names he was
[13:39] referred to as son of man when he came
[13:42] to earth he was mostly referred to a son
[13:43] of man he is also referred to as the son
[13:45] of god and he's also referred to as the
[13:48] son of david it's all the same person
[13:50] same as father son and holy ghost is the
[13:53] same person it's not three persons it's
[13:55] one person in three offices
[13:58] so other three offices he comes is the
[14:00] administration the son of man it's it's
[14:02] the same god but in a different nature
[14:04] that he comes to the people and it's a
[14:06] prophet that comes to the people
[14:08] jesus was the god prophet all the
[14:10] prophets of the old testament all typed
[14:12] him even moses himself said the lord
[14:15] someday will rise up a prophet like and
[14:17] unto me so it's prophesying that jesus
[14:20] will come first as son of man which is a
[14:23] prophet can you say amen he'll be in a
[14:26] visible administration acting as a
[14:28] prophet the god prophet he also comes as
[14:31] son of god it's a different
[14:32] administration but it's the same god
[14:36] he also in the the the prophet
[14:39] refers to it is in the millennium he'll
[14:41] come as son of david king and so all
[14:44] this is the same jesus christ but see
[14:47] now when you have seen jesus again
[14:49] repeated as son of man in the scripture
[14:51] jesus says i'll have to repeat son of
[14:54] man again he says when the conditions
[14:57] are sodom and gomorrah as in the days of
[14:59] sodom as in the days of noah when those
[15:02] conditions hit us again then he will
[15:05] reveal himself again as son of man
[15:08] similar to what he did in jesus christ
[15:11] he and he has to repeat that son of man
[15:14] administration for two reasons two
[15:16] reasons the conditions have become sodom
[15:19] and when conditions become terrible bad
[15:21] what's god do he sent a prophet
[15:24] people bark at prophets but it's the
[15:26] very thing that they need
[15:29] this last generation needed one thing
[15:32] and that was the prophet
[15:35] sent from god
[15:38] if you deny that then you're denying the
[15:40] very answer that this whole world needed
[15:42] can you say mine
[15:44] when the conditions get like sodom it's
[15:46] time for a prophet when israel rebelled
[15:49] against god these god sent jeremiah to
[15:52] warn them
[15:53] when the conditions get bad so that's
[15:54] the first reason is when the conditions
[15:57] get to such a low spot god sends a
[15:59] prophet the second reason he sins son of
[16:01] man jesus said i'll be revealed at the
[16:04] end time as son of man jesus said that
[16:06] all right the second reason he has to do
[16:08] it is because he displayed it the first
[16:10] time to the jews
[16:12] but to be fair he needs to place display
[16:16] son of man
[16:17] to gentiles
[16:19] so he says i'll leave it to the end time
[16:21] but there will be a short display of a
[16:24] similar administration of son of man now
[16:26] this is all in your bible if you're
[16:27] listening in or here listening here
[16:29] today i'm not off of the scripture we
[16:31] can talk about it if you want it's right
[16:33] in the bible he was referred to as son
[16:35] of man when he was here so much though
[16:38] he referred to himself as son of man and
[16:40] when somebody would refer to him
[16:42] something different than the
[16:43] administration he was in
[16:45] then we find that he sometimes would
[16:48] correct them even that he was not in the
[16:50] office of this yeah
[16:52] someone said son of god or someone said
[16:55] son of david
[16:57] the jews were wanting him now catch this
[17:01] i'm ahead in my notes here but that's
[17:02] all right saves us all time
[17:07] is anybody learning something from this
[17:09] this is important
[17:10] so so because i said it's important but
[17:13] you see
[17:15] when when the when he came in that
[17:17] office of son of man the jews didn't
[17:20] like it because they were under the
[17:21] conditions of rome they were under
[17:23] conditions of pressure they were getting
[17:25] taxed more uh anybody does that sound
[17:28] familiar with anybody the conditions
[17:29] were bad they were in despondence of
[17:31] rome and so what they wanted god to come
[17:34] is son of david we need a king like
[17:37] david to take over rome to get rid of
[17:40] all of them we want a king we want a
[17:41] king and one place when he come across
[17:44] and he said i'm going to go across to
[17:45] the boat to the other side and the
[17:47] reason he jumped on a boat and got away
[17:48] from the crowds because they feared lest
[17:51] they would make him a king they were so
[17:53] excited about the miracles they said
[17:54] this is our king this is the son of
[17:56] david we're going to make him a king and
[17:58] he the reason he got an abode and took
[18:00] off is because it wasn't time for son of
[18:03] david
[18:05] so we learn the lessons i don't care how
[18:07] much we want out of a certain thing we
[18:10] have to respond to what god is
[18:13] manifesting in the time he's manifesting
[18:16] with
[18:16] it's not what you want it's what god has
[18:19] provided for you
[18:20] [Applause]
[18:24] this morning it's not what you want out
[18:26] of god it's what god says you need
[18:31] i say that respectful because he desires
[18:34] to fulfill our needs and desires but you
[18:36] see now it can't be about you it can't
[18:38] be selfish and they wanted to make him a
[18:40] king there was another woman that was a
[18:42] a gentile seraphinician woman i think
[18:45] and she refers jesus she wanted healing
[18:48] jesus thou son of david
[18:51] have mercy on me and she only learned
[18:53] that from the jews she wasn't a jew but
[18:55] she learned i said maybe this is the
[18:57] term we'll get his attention and i'll
[18:59] get my healing he never even responded
[19:01] to her
[19:03] so it must have been pretty important
[19:05] because jesus didn't even respond to her
[19:07] now eventually when she kept coming and
[19:09] they got it worked out she got her
[19:10] healing
[19:12] but these things are important so so so
[19:14] now when he says he'll repeat as son of
[19:18] man
[19:19] in the end time we have watched this
[19:22] ministry and i'm not only referring to
[19:25] just it does come as one man first
[19:28] but he also referred to the son of man
[19:31] as being not only a prophet but bringing
[19:33] that word of the prophet which we still
[19:36] have with us and and he referred to it
[19:40] a couple times i believe
[19:42] son of man husband and wife
[19:45] and he also
[19:46] said this you're not feeding on a man
[19:50] but you're feeding on the body word of
[19:54] the son of man
[19:55] [Music]
[19:56] so something interesting about the son
[19:59] of man ministry how jesus comes
[20:02] is that although it starts with the one
[20:05] man visible ministry the words he speak
[20:07] is that's what's important
[20:10] because it becomes food to feed on
[20:14] you're not feeding on a man now you're
[20:16] feeding on the body word of the son of
[20:18] man
[20:20] that's different
[20:22] that's why people can disagree well it's
[20:23] just a man and that's his opinion be
[20:25] careful what you label his opinion and
[20:26] all this stuff just be careful with that
[20:28] i know there's some opinions there of
[20:30] his but i'd be careful what i it's not
[20:32] my choice to choose what's his opinion
[20:34] and what's not his opinion i just
[20:36] respect all of it
[20:40] knowing that he was a human being
[20:42] knowing that but we have to look at this
[20:44] right this is the ministry of the son of
[20:47] man that jesus said would come in the
[20:49] end time and we what we do with this we
[20:52] eat it we eat the word we eat the word
[20:54] we eat it what do we do with it we don't
[20:56] idolize the man who came we don't
[20:58] idolize any flesh we eat the son of man
[21:01] we eat what he gave us
[21:03] [Applause]
[21:06] so much he says that he says you're
[21:08] feeding on the body word of the son of
[21:10] man and you'll take a rapture someday it
[21:12] has to do with our rapture as well but
[21:16] the first thing god does in conditions
[21:17] he sends that ministry of a prophet son
[21:19] of man to give the word to the people so
[21:21] they know how do we get back how do we
[21:23] get back to god how do we get back
[21:26] restored to god israel would ask how do
[21:28] we get back to him we've rebelled we're
[21:30] in terrible conditions we're without a
[21:32] king we're without a sacrifice what do
[21:35] we do and many times the answer i say
[21:38] every time god sent a prophet right now
[21:40] god sent a prophet
[21:42] and though they might have went uh
[21:44] another prophet it's exactly what they
[21:46] needed
[21:48] this generation this culture has
[21:50] rejected the very answer god sent
[21:54] in the 20th century
[21:58] most
[21:59] if not all of denominational systems
[22:02] have rejected god's answer
[22:04] and it's always been god's answer he
[22:07] starts it to get the people back he
[22:08] starts it
[22:10] with a prophet that's right that's how
[22:13] he starts it you're never getting past
[22:15] that biblical pattern i just elaborate
[22:17] on this because i just feel to this
[22:19] morning maybe somebody's listening
[22:21] you just need to take your bible and see
[22:22] that there's a bible pattern you never
[22:24] can get around you say well that stopped
[22:26] in the new testament well who died made
[22:28] you interpreter of the word
[22:32] he only did miracles in the book of acts
[22:35] who died and made you interpreter of the
[22:36] word
[22:37] who gave you permission to say that your
[22:38] denomination tell you that
[22:41] i say hebrews 13 8 says jesus christ the
[22:43] same yesterday today and forever
[22:45] if people spoke in tongues in the book
[22:47] of acts they can speak in tongues today
[22:49] if people were raised the dead in the
[22:50] book of acts god can still do it in this
[22:51] very service this morning
[22:54] he can raise the dead still can you say
[22:56] amen
[22:57] and you come around and say well just
[22:58] prove it well i don't do things just to
[23:00] prove it because it probably wouldn't
[23:01] help you anyway if you got that attitude
[23:03] but the god that raised the dead 2000
[23:06] years ago is able to raise the dead in
[23:08] this service this morning
[23:11] amen
[23:12] and i'm not preaching to the physically
[23:14] dead i'm preaching to spiritually dead
[23:17] people sometimes so the same god that
[23:20] can raise up lazarus can raise your soul
[23:22] out of death to new life this morning
[23:26] [Applause]
[23:30] as henry my brother-in-law has told me
[23:32] many times he says you preach my funeral
[23:34] every sunday
[23:37] because the old man dies
[23:39] and the new man christ comes to life
[23:42] i'm preaching funerals here
[23:44] and if you'll just die
[23:46] get in the casket and die to yourself
[23:48] and raise up the new man christ can come
[23:51] alive in your life
[23:54] i'm preaching the power of resurrection
[23:56] i'm preaching the power of the gospel
[23:58] and it has resurrection within it
[24:00] for your life
[24:01] to raise you out of denominational
[24:03] thoughts to raise you out of the
[24:05] religion within the message even to
[24:07] raise you out of a dull spiritual life
[24:09] to raise you out of life with no revival
[24:11] to raise you to have a spiritual revival
[24:13] in your life to raise up
[24:18] this is the living christ the
[24:19] resurrected christ
[24:22] as my friend wayne lawson says don't
[24:25] preach psychology preach the resurrected
[24:27] christ
[24:31] amen and that's what we've been
[24:33] preaching for 33 years here
[24:37] hallelujah
[24:39] so
[24:41] i don't have a clue where i'm at now in
[24:43] my notes
[24:44] but he has come
[24:46] as son of man
[24:49] oh it's been a great rejoicing time
[24:53] son of man son of god son of david
[24:58] prophet
[24:59] priest
[25:00] and king
[25:01] jesus is all of them
[25:04] eagle
[25:05] lamb and lion
[25:09] you'd say it anyway you want to say it
[25:10] here eagle lamb and lion if i can say it
[25:13] this way
[25:14] just let me get more specific now
[25:17] number one the washing of the water of
[25:20] the word by a prophet
[25:23] number two the intercessory blood of a
[25:25] lamb by a priest jesus christ
[25:29] and number three the character
[25:31] of a king
[25:32] coming forth
[25:36] this is our message
[25:38] and i'll get to it in a minute if i get
[25:40] to it when you look at the nativity
[25:42] scene
[25:42] all over right now
[25:44] after yesterday i'm looking at nativity
[25:46] scenes all together different
[25:48] because i'm looking at a baby
[25:51] which they didn't expect god to send
[25:54] but in that baby was the whole package
[25:59] son of man
[26:01] son of god
[26:03] son of david it was all there
[26:06] [Music]
[26:09] and when he sent this word as the last
[26:10] days and repeated son of man again it
[26:12] should alert us to the fact that god
[26:15] when he sends something he's not going
[26:16] to just said one thing but resident
[26:18] within that word is son of man
[26:22] son of god
[26:24] and son of david to get us ready for a
[26:26] millennium
[26:27] it's all jesus christ
[26:34] amen
[26:42] so
[26:44] the washing of the water and and get
[26:46] this now
[26:47] your old testament you read your old
[26:49] testament oh but i don't understand this
[26:51] here it is you know here he comes as
[26:53] prophet priest and king and did you know
[26:55] as you read through first samuel first
[26:57] chronicles second chronicles you read
[26:58] through all these words you know what
[26:59] the theme is
[27:02] a lamb
[27:04] priest
[27:07] prophets
[27:09] and a king
[27:12] he's speaking something he's saying
[27:13] something
[27:15] the theme is pointing to that baby jesus
[27:18] christ
[27:19] i'm going to do something here
[27:21] i always like to say it this way in the
[27:23] old testament
[27:24] god was trying to say something
[27:27] but when jesus came he was what god was
[27:29] trying to say
[27:31] the whole time
[27:33] he was everything god was trying to say
[27:35] this is what god looks like in a human
[27:37] being
[27:38] and if he looks that way and i say lord
[27:41] bring jesus in me he's going to look
[27:43] that way in your life
[27:45] the old testament it's prophets there's
[27:46] a lamb that's slain there's a lamb
[27:49] there's a priest bringing the lamb oh
[27:51] that's jesus christ
[27:53] and then there's a king
[27:55] and all of these things were speaking of
[27:58] what the one thing god would sin that we
[28:01] would need
[28:02] and that is the king but when they
[28:04] looked at that baby it was it was not
[28:06] only the king but everything would be in
[28:08] that baby everything would be there so
[28:11] when he sent a prophet
[28:13] and even when you're
[28:14] entering when you're entering the uh
[28:18] the tent the tabernacle of god
[28:21] you know they had a place on the outside
[28:24] and so you're approaching to get into
[28:25] the throne of god to get to into his
[28:27] presence so you come first to the the
[28:30] table and you wash there and the
[28:31] sacrifice is washed
[28:33] god sends a prophet for the washing of
[28:35] the water by the word but you're not
[28:36] done yet
[28:38] then you go into the tent
[28:40] and then you've got the different things
[28:41] you go there for for for sanctification
[28:44] the priest is inside that inner part and
[28:47] the priest prepares himself to enter for
[28:49] you that's the old testament
[28:51] in the old testament the priest enters
[28:53] that throne room
[28:55] for you with the sacrifice after calvary
[28:59] we have a right to enter the throne room
[29:01] ourselves that's why he says in
[29:02] revelations 3 he says i have overcome
[29:05] you overcome and to whom they'll
[29:07] overcome us i will grant to sit with me
[29:09] in my throne as i have overcome and said
[29:11] so this thing isn't about about jesus
[29:13] it's all about jesus but it's about you
[29:15] coming to kingship and priesthood
[29:19] with him
[29:20] see you
[29:21] it's approach to the lord approach the
[29:23] lord you have a priest there you have a
[29:25] lamb there you have a prophet there
[29:27] and then you come into the royal
[29:29] intervale
[29:32] royalty kingship the throne
[29:35] everything speaks of this
[29:37] baby that was born that was the whole
[29:39] package
[29:40] that had everything within it when you
[29:43] looked at it
[29:45] the washing of the word by a prophet
[29:47] intercessory blood by a lamb and a
[29:49] priest he actually was our lamb the
[29:51] character of king in other words our
[29:53] high priest jesus jesus christ he was
[29:55] not only the high priest but he became
[29:57] the lamb too
[30:04] and so we come under the correction of a
[30:06] true prophet the cleansing of a true
[30:09] sacrifice
[30:10] and the leadership of a true king
[30:14] under this message
[30:16] it's not done with a prophet
[30:20] under this message we come under what
[30:23] jesus christ did for the last days we
[30:26] come under the correction of a true
[30:27] prophet some people haven't even come
[30:29] underneath that yet
[30:30] and some attend this church they can't
[30:32] even line themselves up with the
[30:33] prophet's word yet
[30:36] but if it's the ministry of christ you
[30:37] come under the correction of a true
[30:38] prophet the cleansing and sanctification
[30:41] of a true sacrifice
[30:42] and then we come to true
[30:45] leadership
[30:46] of character
[30:48] in our
[30:49] amen
[30:50] how many want to be following true
[30:53] character and leadership
[30:55] a lot of people can preach this message
[30:58] and it'll be true preaching but they're
[31:00] lacking the character of the king
[31:04] that's a serious thing for your life
[31:07] that man should be growing in the
[31:08] character of the king and if he's going
[31:10] the opposite direction and still
[31:12] preaching this word you're missing an
[31:14] element that's in the message and that
[31:15] is it's not just preaching the prophet
[31:17] it's not just preaching that he was our
[31:19] high priest it's not just preaching the
[31:21] good mysteries
[31:23] and the true mysteries
[31:25] but we are growing into a kingdom people
[31:29] oh our goal for
[31:30] 2022 say god grew me into a kingdom
[31:34] people i know i'm royalty because the
[31:36] word says i'm royalty but lord let me
[31:38] start acting and conducting myself like
[31:41] royalty
[31:44] that's where we're going
[31:46] once you come and go with us
[31:49] that's where this message has taken us
[31:52] not intellectuals that can just dazzle
[31:54] one another with all the mysteries that
[31:56] we know but let me see the character of
[31:59] adoption coming in your life
[32:03] that's what this message is supposed to
[32:04] produce
[32:05] we're not done at a profit we're not
[32:08] done in just sanctified lives we're not
[32:10] done in dresses and long hair
[32:12] [Applause]
[32:13] don't you ever dump it out can you say a
[32:15] man a woman shouldn't cut her lay a pair
[32:17] of scissors through her hair that's
[32:18] according to the word of god don't ever
[32:20] dump that out don't ever dump out that
[32:22] it's wrong to wear a tight slits curtain
[32:24] above your knees and i don't cut any of
[32:26] that out we believe those things but we
[32:28] don't stop in a dress code we don't stop
[32:30] at just a prophet can you say amen we're
[32:32] looking for the character of the king
[32:34] [Applause]
[32:36] i'm looking for that character that come
[32:39] even in our prophet that grew to
[32:40] adoption in his life grew to maturity in
[32:43] his life
[32:45] grew to more divine love in his life
[32:48] the capstone he he was capped his life
[32:50] was capped with divine love
[32:53] so much so in 1965 he said god forgive
[32:56] me for calling those raquettas and
[32:58] rickeys he said they don't know what
[32:59] they're doing jesus said at the cross
[33:01] forgive them they don't even know what
[33:03] they're doing he says and shalom i
[33:05] recognize most of people don't even
[33:07] realize the state that they're in
[33:09] i shouldn't be the one criticizing them
[33:11] and putting out of the the kingdom but i
[33:14] should be the one that's praying for
[33:15] them that god can show them more truth
[33:20] that was adoption that was character not
[33:23] writing somebody off and say i'll never
[33:25] speak to that person again i know they
[33:26] go to my church and that's not what
[33:28] we're looking for
[33:30] we're looking for the capsule to divide
[33:32] love in our life
[33:34] [Applause]
[33:39] this message is not just god sending
[33:42] a prophet
[33:45] son of man
[33:47] it's son of god
[33:48] [Music]
[33:49] and son of david and i'm seeking the son
[33:52] of david
[33:54] i'm seeking my king
[33:57] you say well that's brother brother says
[33:59] that's the millennium i know that's when
[34:02] it all gets set up set up in this earth
[34:04] but we already have the king here
[34:10] do i need to do i need to verify
[34:13] he stood there
[34:15] and he held a sword
[34:17] you know
[34:18] what whose sword is that
[34:21] that's the king's sword
[34:24] that's the king's word
[34:26] i'm going to give my word to the people
[34:29] but the king is present with us
[34:34] that's why it just makes us want to just
[34:35] say lord
[34:37] ministers and all
[34:38] we bow to the presence of our king
[34:42] let him come and do what he wants to do
[34:51] praise the lord
[34:53] i'm having trouble finding the place
[34:54] here in my notes
[35:04] all right
[35:05] taking my coat off so
[35:07] somebody said keep going so that's what
[35:09] i'm doing
[35:17] once you pull up that quote and we'll
[35:19] read it as he said it
[35:23] it's probably 11 12 times he refers to
[35:25] these three names son of man son of god
[35:27] son of david making the distinction and
[35:29] when he revealed himself the son of man
[35:32] as the scripture said he would be no sir
[35:34] they rejected it he wasn't no prophet
[35:37] they couldn't believe it they hadn't had
[35:39] one for hundreds of years and they
[35:41] couldn't believe him to be a prophet
[35:44] when he told the little woman about how
[35:46] many husbands she had
[35:48] in her heart her in that condition
[35:50] she was ordained to life so he's making
[35:53] the point here that all the religious
[35:54] leaders said we don't want you to come
[35:56] this way we don't want a prophet we want
[35:59] son of david we don't want son of man
[36:02] but a little harlot girl
[36:05] who had five husbands and was living
[36:07] wrong
[36:08] she
[36:09] says i perceive
[36:11] you're that prophet you're a prophet
[36:13] so this is by predestination can you say
[36:15] man
[36:16] and she sees it she she doesn't have any
[36:18] back learning she hasn't been in in all
[36:21] that no she just her heart her soul
[36:23] connects with it you're they're the
[36:24] prophet and i receive it if you're
[36:26] coming a son of man i receive it i need
[36:28] it not only for my sin but i i need it
[36:31] to be a witness and she went and was a
[36:32] witness to everybody come see a man
[36:34] who's told me all the things in my life
[36:36] son of man became real and became alive
[36:39] to her can you say amen so now when he
[36:42] told that little woman
[36:45] uh
[36:45] the next one and when he told
[36:48] she said sir i perceive you're a prophet
[36:50] i know when messiah cometh we haven't
[36:52] had a prophet for hundreds of years but
[36:54] i know when he comes that's the sign
[36:55] he'll do because he how does she know
[36:57] that she hasn't been trained
[36:59] she's speaking from the soul
[37:02] i know
[37:04] that when he comes that's the sign he'll
[37:06] do because he'll be the word he knows
[37:08] what's in my heart he said i am he that
[37:11] speaks to you and her testimony caused
[37:13] the whole city to come to christ right
[37:15] they all believed not for the religious
[37:18] leaders but from a harlot who testified
[37:21] of the right ministry of son of man
[37:25] don't underestimate the power of your
[37:26] testimony next one
[37:29] now look as son of david he was with the
[37:32] jew but the son of god now look son of
[37:34] man prophet see the son of david king
[37:37] they recognized him not as a prophet
[37:39] they wanted to make him king they wanted
[37:42] to be delivered out from under the roman
[37:46] empire so they had needs and they wanted
[37:49] god to come and meet their needs in the
[37:51] channel that they wanted him to come in
[37:54] but he wasn't coming in that channel
[37:56] actually if they knew the condition of
[37:58] their soul which was in sin the serpent
[38:01] nature that they had if they knew the
[38:03] conditions their denominations were in
[38:05] if they knew the real state that they
[38:07] were in they would be saying the one
[38:09] thing that we need first is a real true
[38:13] prophet
[38:14] to rebuke us and get us back to the word
[38:18] but they weren't saying it because they
[38:20] didn't see their condition
[38:22] they had religion
[38:24] that they thought they were okay
[38:28] and prophets come to show us
[38:30] where we all are can you say amen
[38:34] not the modern day prophets that we have
[38:36] today
[38:38] modern day men who most of the time
[38:40] you're never going to hear a rebuke from
[38:42] them
[38:43] you're going to hear prosperity
[38:45] it's all good
[38:47] you're going to be mighty i was
[38:49] prophesied over
[38:53] one time i
[38:55] went to a hemphill concert years ago
[38:57] they don't sing anymore but i went and
[38:59] the son joel had lost his voice so i had
[39:02] been listening to their new project i
[39:03] liked i like southern gospel and so i
[39:05] was listening sister w to enjoy this so
[39:08] i went to toledo the concert and
[39:10] he was losing his voice i can tell so i
[39:12] went up my my buddy mark stanky saying
[39:15] go tell him you can sing with him you
[39:16] can do it
[39:17] i'm not going to go back there i'm not
[39:19] going to well he pushed me so i went
[39:20] back and i said my name's paula fontaine
[39:22] you don't know who i am but i know all
[39:24] the parts if you want me to help you out
[39:25] you can't do they say you know the parts
[39:27] yeah you know the parts
[39:30] you can do it
[39:31] he said fine you take it you know this
[39:33] song you know the idea yeah i know him
[39:35] is pretty easy
[39:40] and
[39:41] so they put me on
[39:44] with them the rest of the night here in
[39:45] toledo which i mean you know
[39:47] i don't know what i was 21 years old or
[39:49] 20. man to me i had hit the big time man
[39:53] i had hit the big time when i tell other
[39:56] people they usually say who's the hem
[39:58] pills
[40:00] so most other people i didn't hit the
[40:02] big time but to me i hit the big time
[40:04] and to my buddy mark stakey he's a
[40:05] southern gospel lover i hit the big guy
[40:07] sister debbie would probably think well
[40:09] you did hit the big time
[40:10] you sang with him pills so i did so good
[40:12] that night and they were loving it and
[40:14] his so they said we'll call you in the
[40:15] morning if his voice is bad we need you
[40:17] in columbus tomorrow night man i thought
[40:19] this was a career starting out for me i
[40:21] thought this is really good
[40:22] how much am i going to get paid for this
[40:24] no i didn't think that but anyway
[40:26] i got on the bus the next one because
[40:28] they asked me to go with them i drove
[40:29] down the bus well they had a profit on
[40:31] the bus from detroit and so now i have
[40:34] never been around
[40:37] that type of prophet i only knew
[40:39] the prophets of the bible the true
[40:41] prophet god sent in the last days so
[40:43] this is a total contrast so you know i'm
[40:46] already going okay here's a prophet on
[40:48] the bus and i walk on the bus and
[40:49] everything's kind of still and he's
[40:51] going around to every member of that
[40:53] that
[40:54] the bus every band member and he's
[40:57] prophesying over them and i was noticing
[41:00] every one of it was such a huge future
[41:02] for them they were going to go to the
[41:04] ends of the earth and they're going to
[41:06] be so popular they're going he's going
[41:08] on and on so that was a little strange
[41:10] to me that everything was prosperity
[41:12] there was no rebuke in these guys i said
[41:14] these guys must be angels because
[41:16] there's no rebuke there's no correction
[41:18] it's all they're going to be rich and
[41:20] famous someday
[41:21] so then he heads towards me
[41:25] and he's going to prophesy over me
[41:27] so i just bow my head you know and
[41:29] reverence and respect and man did i ever
[41:32] get a future
[41:36] your talent is going to go around the
[41:38] world and you're going to have all these
[41:40] people he went on and on and prospering
[41:43] and i just respect myself well praise
[41:45] the lord you know i respect those things
[41:46] i'm not going to put anybody down but it
[41:48] was my first taste of a prophet and so
[41:51] then after he walked off the bus and i
[41:52] spent the rest of the day with band
[41:54] members
[41:56] my conclusion was is that
[41:59] their lives needed some other things
[42:02] said from a prophet than what they heard
[42:05] i say that respectfully and i hope the
[42:07] hempfields don't ever listen to this
[42:09] video
[42:12] you know they were struggling they
[42:13] needed some deliverance in certain areas
[42:14] they need to say
[42:16] and so and i'm not saying anything i'm
[42:18] perfect myself i'm just saying
[42:19] that's what the word does
[42:24] that's the nature of the holy spirit
[42:26] you parents that try to protect your
[42:28] kids from correction and conviction you
[42:30] better think about that what other thing
[42:33] in their life did they have that's going
[42:34] to correct where they're wrong accept
[42:36] the word of god and accept the godly
[42:38] pastor who loves them where are they
[42:40] going to get it
[42:42] so that was a real lesson for me to know
[42:44] that you know the nature of the prophets
[42:46] to bring that correction first but
[42:48] that's not the end of the message and we
[42:50] find that they wanted a king son of
[42:54] david they would let's take a lesson
[42:56] this morning let's say lord it's not
[42:58] what i necessarily i want from you but
[43:01] you know my needs
[43:04] you know what i need at every service
[43:07] can you say amen
[43:10] and i say lord i submit myself if i come
[43:12] and get the hide ripped off of me by the
[43:15] word of god by conviction not
[43:16] condemnation but if i get it then lord
[43:18] if that's what you sent that's what i
[43:20] take
[43:21] but if i'm coming and i needed to be
[43:23] encouraged like wednesday night we were
[43:24] in here shouting shouting like crazy
[43:27] last sunday we had a special here we had
[43:29] church during the special and then we
[43:30] had church after that and sometimes it
[43:33] makes our hearts rejoice wednesday night
[43:34] we had a revival in here talking about
[43:37] our position and place and that we can
[43:39] live with no guilt god says we can live
[43:41] with no guilt
[43:43] sometimes god comes in different ways
[43:46] for what we need but we should never try
[43:48] to micromanage god and say i don't want
[43:51] this part i just want this part whatever
[43:53] way he comes
[43:54] let him come to me
[43:56] [Applause]
[44:02] they wanted son of david
[44:04] because they had rome and these
[44:05] different things
[44:06] every manifestation of the true christ
[44:08] is a direct
[44:09] perfect answer to our need and our
[44:11] condition for our times
[44:15] praise the lord
[44:18] hey so let's let's this is my christmas
[44:21] service so turn to matthew chapter two
[44:25] look at these fellas
[44:28] traveled all the way across the desert
[44:32] matthew chapter two
[44:34] now when jesus was born in bethlehem of
[44:36] judea in the days of herod the king
[44:39] behold there came a wise man from the
[44:40] east of jerusalem saying
[44:43] where is he that's born king of the jews
[44:45] for we have seen his star in the east
[44:46] and are come to worship him when herod
[44:48] the king had heard these things he was
[44:50] troubled in all jerusalem with him and
[44:52] when he had gathered all the chief
[44:54] priests and scribes of the people
[44:55] together he demanded of them where
[44:58] christ should be born and they said unto
[45:00] him in bethlehem of judea for thus it is
[45:02] written by the prophet and thou
[45:03] bethlehem in the land of judah are not
[45:05] the least among the princes of judah for
[45:07] out of thee shall come the governor thou
[45:09] shalt rule my people israel then herod
[45:12] when he had privately called the wise
[45:14] men inquired of them diligently what
[45:16] time the start appeared and he sent them
[45:18] to bethlehem and said go and search
[45:20] diligently for the young child and when
[45:22] you have found him bring me me word
[45:24] again that i may come and worship him
[45:26] also when they had heard the king they
[45:28] departed although the star which was
[45:30] saul in the east went before them till
[45:33] it came and stood over where the young
[45:36] child was
[45:38] praise the lord
[45:41] one of god's bibles was the heavens
[45:44] they didn't have a bible like yours
[45:47] but
[45:48] you know they didn't go to the internet
[45:50] to try to find where the king was coming
[45:54] but one thing for sure they were seeking
[45:56] the true king
[45:58] this morning just ask yourself am i
[46:01] seeking the true king and the crude
[46:02] leadership in my life
[46:06] and uh there's a there's a statement up
[46:08] there
[46:08] those that got the slides
[46:11] when we go
[46:12] when we're seeking
[46:14] last place you should go is to the
[46:16] internet
[46:18] and google it can you say man we can't
[46:20] trust anything can you say amen amen
[46:25] and even abraham lincoln said something
[46:28] about it
[46:30] do you have that up there
[46:39] nope
[46:40] nope
[46:51] i found that in tennessee i thought it'd
[46:52] be pretty cool to incorporate in one of
[46:54] my sermons
[47:02] you know new people that come to my
[47:03] church they might think this this guy is
[47:05] not your standard preacher at all
[47:09] all right put it down before i get in
[47:11] trouble
[47:13] i have a lot of fun
[47:15] i enjoy life
[47:18] and even though abraham lincoln didn't
[47:19] say that
[47:21] when we're seeking god we don't google
[47:23] it
[47:26] do what i was saying this morning get
[47:27] your bible
[47:29] get the message
[47:36] these guys didn't google it these guys
[47:37] didn't they went to the bible they went
[47:39] to the heavens and it began to show them
[47:42] and the star when they heard verse nine
[47:44] the king they departed below the star
[47:46] which they saw the east went before them
[47:48] until it came and stood over the young
[47:49] child when they saw the star they
[47:52] rejoiced with exceeding great joy why
[47:54] because they were seeking a king they
[47:56] were seeking the king and they were
[47:58] already rejoicing when they found the
[48:00] star because the right star led them to
[48:03] the right king
[48:05] wasn't just another baby this was going
[48:07] to be their king that they were seeking
[48:09] their entire lives maybe you sought them
[48:11] for your whole life but tell you i tell
[48:13] you you ought to rejoice this morning if
[48:15] you found the right star that's leading
[48:17] you to the king
[48:21] they rejoiced with exceeding great joy
[48:23] and when they were coming to the house
[48:24] they saw the young child with mary his
[48:26] mother and fell down and worshiped him
[48:28] and when they had opened their treasures
[48:30] they presented unto him gifts gold
[48:33] frankincense and myrrh and being warned
[48:35] of god in a dream that they should not
[48:37] return to herod they departed into their
[48:38] own country another way whenever we come
[48:40] before the king we want to bring
[48:42] something to him and the gifts that they
[48:44] brought to him reflected what they
[48:46] thought of him they had a revelation of
[48:49] everything that was in this baby or this
[48:51] two-year-old child i should say they had
[48:53] a revelation and their gifts that they
[48:55] brought their life that they brought
[48:58] reflected what they said that he was
[49:03] and he goes back to prophet priest and
[49:05] king
[49:06] deity is a king
[49:08] gold represents deity
[49:10] frankincense is service the priest
[49:16] is death
[49:17] the lamb would die for us
[49:20] even their gifts reflected who this baby
[49:23] was going to be
[49:26] it's not going to be that we're looking
[49:28] for a politician or we're looking for
[49:30] another type of king like israel saying
[49:32] we want a king like the world we want
[49:34] leadership like they have all that was
[49:36] finished after we've seen what saul did
[49:38] and all of his mess up and everything
[49:40] even though he was anointed he kept
[49:42] messing up and god says it's time for me
[49:45] to give the true leadership to my people
[49:47] in this message it's time for the true
[49:50] leadership to come and it's not about
[49:52] men it's about the king jesus christ
[49:56] it's time for my people to get that
[49:58] and that they'll be the son of david in
[50:01] that baby is the son of david and that
[50:04] baby is the son of man in that baby is
[50:07] the whole package the son of god
[50:09] everything can you imagine if you'd have
[50:11] lived in that day and been there
[50:12] worshiping with the wise men which i
[50:15] believe if you have a revelation you
[50:16] would have been there
[50:17] [Music]
[50:19] but can you imagine there they're
[50:20] already rejoicing at the star they're
[50:22] already bowing and worshiping at the
[50:24] little baby the baby hasn't done
[50:26] anything yet
[50:29] he hasn't done anything yet he hasn't
[50:31] healed anybody yet
[50:34] he hasn't had his ministry yet he hasn't
[50:36] been a prophet to rebuke yet he hasn't
[50:38] rebuked all the denominational systems
[50:39] yet he has not come in the office of son
[50:42] of god where he fills people with the
[50:43] holy spirit yet he has not come as a
[50:45] king yet
[50:47] none of that's been manifested and yet
[50:50] they can look by revelation
[50:52] and say
[50:53] it's all here
[50:57] i wonder if we can look at the message
[50:58] the same way
[51:00] not the man
[51:01] william brandon but what god has given
[51:03] us in the last days
[51:04] because remember said they sought david
[51:06] the king in the last days they sought
[51:08] the lord
[51:10] there's a baby in heaven the whole thing
[51:12] is there everything is there
[51:14] you know i preached a few weeks ago on
[51:16] the potentials
[51:18] sometimes god gives you revelations of
[51:20] the potential that lays within something
[51:22] hey look at our bibles here
[51:24] you get into this word
[51:26] you young people and everyone else
[51:28] you start getting into this don't
[51:30] underestimate the potential and the
[51:32] power of living a life in the scriptures
[51:37] amen
[51:39] and some of you don't know because
[51:40] you've never been there you never
[51:41] experienced it yet we've got a few real
[51:43] bible-based people in the church and i
[51:45] like them in the church
[51:47] but you become real bible-based and
[51:49] bathe yourself in this word you don't
[51:51] realize the power that's in there
[51:54] can you say amen
[51:55] and you see things in potential form
[51:58] even if you don't see something that you
[52:00] need the jesus to manifest in your life
[52:02] yet for deliverance if you're looking at
[52:04] the right thing all the potential is
[52:07] there
[52:08] for all deliverance
[52:10] if you're looking at the wrong thing you
[52:11] don't have the potential for it but when
[52:12] you're looking at that baby you have the
[52:14] potential of all healing you have the
[52:15] potential of all redemption you had the
[52:17] potential of the lamb going to calvary
[52:19] you had the potential of all your sins
[52:20] being taken away can you say man
[52:24] and he was going to do all that and he
[52:26] did do all that can you say as we heard
[52:28] about the blood this morning thank god
[52:30] for the blood he went to calvary and for
[52:32] the joy that was set before him that's
[52:33] what our brother read last sunday for
[52:35] the joy you were the joy that was set
[52:36] before him he endured the cross
[52:39] you know what jesus said i went and did
[52:41] that i fulfilled that office of lamb
[52:44] and because because
[52:47] not because you're worthy but because
[52:50] i love you so much
[52:54] i made you worthy
[52:57] you were worth it
[52:59] you're my child you were worth it to
[53:01] redeem you
[53:02] amen
[53:04] you have to have
[53:06] see the value of it
[53:07] and songs like that show us the value
[53:14] we
[53:15] had our anniversary last week and uh
[53:18] we were out of town a couple days and
[53:22] so i wanted to take on friday i wanted
[53:24] to take my wife to a nice place
[53:26] so we chose this ruth chris
[53:29] steakhouse
[53:31] and uh
[53:33] so
[53:34] i had been a couple times before many
[53:36] years but i didn't realize how much the
[53:37] prices had gone up
[53:41] until we open the menus
[53:46] so
[53:48] so we open it up when we start looking
[53:50] at things and
[53:52] praise the lord all right
[53:57] so you have to
[53:58] you start weighing
[54:00] the value of things
[54:02] the value of this woman
[54:08] i know and i just struggled just a
[54:11] little bit
[54:16] and we can joke around about this and i
[54:18] did i i reached over to her and i said
[54:21] really enjoy this
[54:22] because it'll be another 28 years so
[54:25] there's before we come back to this
[54:26] restaurant again i said that to you did
[54:28] i say we joke around
[54:30] she was kind of you know surprised at it
[54:33] too you know 60 70 80 just for the steak
[54:37] so
[54:39] we we ordered and we did and i have to
[54:41] say the value of the food i mean i
[54:43] haven't tasted food like it was
[54:44] tremendous it was worth every dime as
[54:46] far as that goes it was really good and
[54:49] and so then
[54:50] you know crunch time came
[54:52] and we were gonna and so and this place
[54:54] was real i mean we didn't know how which
[54:57] forks to use miriam we just you know i
[54:59] know in
[55:01] canada you know they they have the they
[55:03] call it the cutlery up there it's a
[55:05] fancy term for
[55:07] a fork and spoon
[55:10] now because i was in a restaurant up
[55:11] there and
[55:13] the waiter said i don't know if i told
[55:14] you this mary but the waiter said would
[55:16] you like some cutlery i said no but i'll
[55:18] take some silverware
[55:20] that's how dumb i am you know
[55:25] but
[55:26] anyway
[55:27] we got towards the end and the waiter
[55:28] went in the back room and he was gone
[55:30] for quite a while and i said hon
[55:33] this is our chance to kind of scoot out
[55:35] the door before he comes back with the
[55:37] bill
[55:39] i would not do that all the children
[55:41] listening i would not do that but
[55:43] i can't say that the thought didn't come
[55:45] to me
[55:49] but i'll say publicly
[55:52] and i won't tell you what the bill was
[55:54] but she's worth every dime
[55:57] worth every time
[55:59] amen
[56:03] i mean that with all my heart
[56:06] it's the least i can do for her who she
[56:08] is in character and that's what our
[56:10] hearts is towards the lord and that's
[56:12] what his heart is towards us i went to
[56:14] calvary because you were worth it to me
[56:19] i i win as the lamb because you were
[56:21] worth it to me
[56:26] praise the lord
[56:28] she was worth it she's she's been a
[56:30] great
[56:31] wife and a companion a great woman of
[56:33] character and
[56:34] she was worth every penny of it
[56:38] some other bills may not get paid the
[56:40] next couple months
[56:43] she was still worth it
[56:47] oh my god okay i'm looking for a place
[56:49] to end here
[56:52] how about matthew chapter one and verse
[56:56] when he speaks to joseph
[56:59] verse 18 now the birth of jesus christ
[57:01] was on this wise one as is mary mother
[57:03] mary was espoused to joseph before they
[57:05] came together she was found with child
[57:06] of the holy ghost then joseph her
[57:08] husband being a just man not willing to
[57:10] make her a public example was minded to
[57:12] put her away privately but while he
[57:14] thought on these things
[57:15] behold the angel of the lord appeared to
[57:18] him in a dream saying joseph thou son of
[57:21] david fear not to take unto thee mary
[57:23] thy wife can you see he was dealing with
[57:25] his fear he was dealing with his fear
[57:27] for that which is conceived in her is of
[57:30] the holy ghost and she shall bring forth
[57:34] a son
[57:35] and thou shalt call his name jesus
[57:38] for he shall save
[57:41] his people
[57:42] from their sins
[57:45] i want to simplify all of this that i've
[57:47] said this morning to you when he comes
[57:51] it's for one purpose
[57:54] he will
[57:55] save
[57:56] his people from all of their sins
[58:00] when you looked at that baby

[59:56] david is already among us the son of
[59:58] david is already in our midst
[1:00:02] he's already manifesting himself because
[1:00:03] i can see it in the character of the
[1:00:05] people
[1:00:06] and i'm going to keep seeking that
[1:00:08] character in the people
[1:00:10] a people without fear a people without
[1:00:13] pretense a people without gossip a
[1:00:15] people that's growing to maturity a
[1:00:17] kingdom people for the millennium
[1:00:19] they're being delivered from their
[1:00:21] corpse and their complexes and their
[1:00:23] fears they're being delivered from those
[1:00:25] things that's when you sing
[1:00:27] in the king of character on the scene
[1:00:29] [Applause]
[1:00:31] and i'm going to keep seeking it in my
[1:00:33] own life
[1:00:34] in your lives until we see more of it
[1:00:38] because the son of david is among us
[1:00:42] and when all those people do you know
[1:00:44] can i close on this can i have one
[1:00:46] minute
[1:00:48] do you know when david became king
[1:00:54] turn with me if you would
[1:00:56] ten to one i know what time it is
[1:01:00] i i got you a gift so you have to stay
[1:01:02] extra time
[1:01:07] look at here in first samuel
[1:01:12] i might have to find it because i didn't
[1:01:15] okay so
[1:01:17] so david
[1:01:19] the new king gets anointed in chapter 16
[1:01:22] and then
[1:01:23] as he goes in this transition of saul
[1:01:25] coming against the new king
[1:01:27] all this i want to preach on all this
[1:01:29] because it's amazing all this stuff
[1:01:30] happens sometimes within our ranks in
[1:01:32] the message
[1:01:33] but if you go to chapter 22 and verse 1
[1:01:36] and 2
[1:01:37] i want you to look at who was seeking
[1:01:39] the king
[1:01:41] and then i we will close you can stand
[1:01:43] just as a sign that we're closing
[1:01:47] david therefore first samuel 22 they
[1:01:49] were therefore departed dance and escape
[1:01:51] to the cave adam and when his brethren
[1:01:54] and his father's house heard it they
[1:01:56] went down thither to him
[1:01:58] and everyone
[1:02:00] that was in distress
[1:02:03] and everyone
[1:02:05] that was in debt
[1:02:07] and everyone that was discontented
[1:02:12] what a crew
[1:02:15] what a group of people gathering to
[1:02:17] david
[1:02:19] in debt
[1:02:20] in distress
[1:02:22] discontented
[1:02:24] gathered themselves unto him
[1:02:27] and he became a captain over them
[1:02:31] and there were with him about 400 men
[1:02:35] you often hear
[1:02:37] sermons by many preachers on the four or
[1:02:39] 500 gentile warriors that are fighting
[1:02:41] with david
[1:02:43] but you don't hear of this crowd that
[1:02:45] gathered with them
[1:02:46] discontinued disappointed in saul's
[1:02:49] leadership
[1:02:51] distressed
[1:02:52] in debt
[1:02:54] that's the type of people god gave david
[1:02:56] but they had a revelation
[1:02:58] this guy's coming to the throne
[1:03:01] and if he's in the cave i'm going to the
[1:03:03] cave
[1:03:05] wherever his presence is even though
[1:03:07] he's not fully on the throne yet he will
[1:03:10] be king someday
[1:03:12] and i'm going to bring my life
[1:03:14] no matter how much debt i have no matter
[1:03:16] how much distress i have i'm going to
[1:03:18] bring it to him because something's
[1:03:20] going to good be good from being in his
[1:03:23] presence
[1:03:24] let's give the lord a handclap of praise
[1:03:26] amen
