[0:00] if you stand one more time we're going
[0:01] to read in joshua chapter 11.
[0:09] if you would read with me the text that
[0:12] we read last sunday we wanted to finish
[0:14] a few thoughts from that text joshua
[0:17] chapter 11.
[0:24] i certainly feel his presence here this
[0:26] morning
[0:28] amen
[0:32] i want to read here just one verse and
[0:34] verse 15
[0:35] as the lord commanded moses his servant
[0:37] so did moses command
[0:38] joshua and so did joshua he left nothing
[0:42] undone of all the lord commanded moses
[0:46] if you turn with me in ephesians in the
[0:48] new testament which is where i want to
[0:49] preach out of today
[0:51] i want to bring it from the old
[0:53] testament to the new testament
[0:55] as we realize that brother branham said
[0:57] that
[0:58] our joshua chapter our joshua commission
[1:01] is in the book of ephesians that's our
[1:04] inheritance
[1:04] spiritually speaking ephesians chapter 1
[1:07] and verse 18
[1:10] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:11] enlightened that ye may know what is the
[1:14] hope of his calling
[1:15] and what is the riches of the glory of
[1:18] his inheritance
[1:19] in the saints so now the book of joshua
[1:23] is the physical inheritance of israel
[1:24] and now here is our
[1:26] spiritual inheritance did you know you
[1:28] have a spiritual inheritance
[1:31] and what is the exceeding greatness of
[1:33] his power to us word who believe
[1:35] according
[1:36] to the working of his mighty power which
[1:38] he wrought in christ when he
[1:40] raised him from the dead and set him at
[1:42] his own right hand in the heavenly
[1:44] places
[1:45] far above all principality and power and
[1:48] might
[1:49] and dominion and every name that is
[1:51] named not only in this world but also
[1:54] it that which is to come and
[1:57] hath put all things under his feet
[2:00] and gave him to be the head over
[2:03] all things to the church i want to read
[2:06] verse 22
[2:07] again and hath put all things and i'd
[2:10] like you to remember
[2:11] back in joshua right where joshua left
[2:14] nothing
[2:15] undone all things that goes right with
[2:18] this because
[2:19] christ allows us to put all things under
[2:22] everybody say all things joshua left
[2:26] nothing undone
[2:27] and in our inheritance christ allows us
[2:29] to put
[2:30] all things under our feet and put all
[2:33] things under his feet and gave him to be
[2:34] the head
[2:35] over all things to the church which is
[2:38] his body
[2:39] the fullness of him that filleth all in
[2:42] all and if he says his body is the
[2:44] fullness of him
[2:45] then we're part of that body there's
[2:47] christ living within us
[2:49] we are the fullness and so where is he
[2:51] putting the devil under his feet
[2:53] it's through the body of christ amen
[2:55] father bless your word
[2:56] we pray that you will anoint us we
[2:58] certainly are
[3:00] glad to know father that you're you're
[3:02] near us this morning we feel and sent
[3:04] you here
[3:05] i want to say thank you for the life of
[3:07] brother gary so many years he's serving
[3:09] this assembly
[3:10] and lord thank you lord that you chose
[3:12] father that he could go to his reward
[3:15] and in his days of suffering here
[3:17] in his mind battle as it was lord and i
[3:20] just pray father that you encourage his
[3:22] brother and sisters two brothers and his
[3:24] sister
[3:25] and all the family this morning as they
[3:27] grieve his loss
[3:28] and you pray you would encourage them
[3:30] lord and
[3:32] just in the coming days just be with
[3:33] them lord and all those who have
[3:36] lost their loved ones recently lord we
[3:37] pray that you will be a friend
[3:40] to the ones who need comfort we thank
[3:42] you lord in jesus name
[3:44] amen god bless you may be seated
[3:55] i sense in joshua a leader
[3:58] in a great commander in general of the
[4:02] army
[4:03] him being a type of the holy ghost that
[4:05] joshua
[4:06] is a good type in this way first that
[4:08] he's not afraid
[4:10] joshua was not afraid joshua was not
[4:15] afraid
[4:16] to go and root out the enemy in places
[4:20] maybe that he was hidden
[4:22] so i want to this morning take this a
[4:24] little bit deeper because
[4:26] if we just continue to talk about the
[4:28] old testament and what joshua did
[4:30] and him taking the land we can rejoice
[4:32] over that
[4:33] but we don't want to miss that it's all
[4:35] a shadow and type of your
[4:38] spiritual life right now and if we come
[4:40] to church and just rejoice over
[4:42] what happened in joshua it's not good
[4:43] enough we have to look at what it's
[4:46] saying to us and what it means
[4:47] especially when we know
[4:49] our land and our book and our
[4:50] inheritance has been given back to us
[4:52] when the seals were taken off in the
[4:54] last days
[4:54] this is a wonderful thing calvary
[4:56] purchased it but then the land came in
[4:58] the last days and gave it back to us
[5:00] again
[5:01] but joshua we can learn from was not
[5:03] afraid
[5:04] i want to take this deeper today and
[5:06] talk about things that are left undone
[5:09] talk about things that are left in our
[5:11] lives sometimes that
[5:13] uh we we ignore and and and yet
[5:17] if we ignore some things it may be an
[5:20] area that god wants us to overcome in
[5:22] its land that has been taken away from
[5:24] us
[5:24] and if we ignore it or we leave it
[5:26] undone we can't live
[5:28] to our full potential as a christian
[5:32] and so joshua's not afraid though and we
[5:35] can learn something is that
[5:36] we can't be afraid to go to the areas
[5:39] of our life that are uh not taken yet
[5:43] land that is not taken yet uh in in
[5:46] joshua in a few weeks we'll talk about
[5:48] it
[5:48] if we get to it but there's a scripture
[5:50] two or three chapters later
[5:52] after they had rested from the battle
[5:54] for a while then god says to joshua
[5:57] rised up again
[5:58] because he said there's still very much
[6:00] land to possess it's hard to believe
[6:02] that they battled that hard
[6:03] and then they rested and god says no
[6:05] there's still land to possess
[6:07] be up and going it's time to go so
[6:09] there's still land and in our lives
[6:11] if there's still land to possess we
[6:13] can't be afraid
[6:15] to go take those lands to take that part
[6:19] joshua wasn't afraid to root out the
[6:21] enemy joshua wasn't afraid to expose the
[6:24] enemy
[6:25] joshua was not afraid to go to the enemy
[6:28] if he be hidden somewhere he wasn't
[6:31] afraid and so
[6:32] may we all get that type of faith in our
[6:34] heart this morning
[6:36] to say i will not be afraid to root out
[6:38] the enemy if he's cheating me
[6:40] or taking something from me that's my
[6:43] spiritual inheritance
[6:44] i won't be afraid of them but the truth
[6:47] is about human beings sometimes
[6:48] we're afraid of certain areas we're
[6:51] afraid to talk about certain areas
[6:53] there are areas of our hearts sometimes
[6:55] that we've left alone for years
[6:58] and sometimes we just leave it alone but
[7:00] you see you
[7:01] you have to be willing to say i'm not
[7:03] afraid of anything
[7:04] because i will live in greater victory
[7:07] if i
[7:08] possess this part that the devil has
[7:11] used so many times i can't be afraid to
[7:14] possess that part
[7:15] too believers
[7:18] and bringing up what i did last sunday
[7:20] believers will not cast aside parts
[7:23] that they don't want or they don't want
[7:26] to
[7:26] follow real believers will rise up and
[7:29] they don't want to just cast aside
[7:31] and leave something undone as we said
[7:33] last sunday believers don't want to do
[7:35] it and believers say
[7:36] if it's important to god it's important
[7:38] to them
[7:40] if if god says that i can uh live
[7:43] victorious in this particular area
[7:46] whatever it is in my conversation in my
[7:48] thought life and
[7:49] if he says i can i'm going to keep
[7:51] claiming that until i get it can you say
[7:53] man
[7:53] i'm going to keep approaching that and
[7:56] especially if the enemy's trying to use
[7:59] something
[8:00] if it's important to god then it's
[8:02] important
[8:03] to the to believers to say it's in my
[8:07] inheritance
[8:08] everything in this bible particularly in
[8:10] the book of ephesians
[8:12] if you if we look at it like we look at
[8:14] it today our inheritance
[8:16] it is not just the soul that we possess
[8:21] but there are parts of our spirit and
[8:24] our body that are talked about in the
[8:26] bible
[8:26] and so we can't leave those parts out
[8:28] god wants us to have our vessel
[8:31] victorious before him can you say amen
[8:34] and
[8:34] uh and so believers don't want to leave
[8:37] anything out i want to thank
[8:38] as i was thinking about this these
[8:40] things i want to thank the women
[8:42] many of the women of our congregation
[8:46] i want to thank the older women for
[8:50] many of the older women for not leaving
[8:54] the modest parts of the word for not
[8:57] leaving them out
[8:59] or leaving them undone so i'm coming
[9:02] down real practical to say
[9:03] it's not just what we have on our soul
[9:05] but it's everything in the bible and the
[9:07] message that get to all of that
[9:09] they're trying but just taking care of
[9:11] them and just being a mother and loving
[9:13] them
[9:14] that is to be praised because you know
[9:16] what you're doing you're saying that
[9:18] part of the word will not be left
[9:20] undone i'm bringing that because that's
[9:22] part of my inheritance too
[9:24] that's part of my position can you say
[9:26] amen people want a position and mother's
[9:29] in the adoption series brother braham
[9:30] says we find our place in christ in the
[9:32] word
[9:33] but he says then what are you a farmer
[9:35] you're a mechanic whatever it is
[9:36] and he says you mothers with children
[9:38] that's a position in christ
[9:40] that you're fulfilling it's part of what
[9:42] god gave you
[9:43] and you're doing it well god bless you
[9:45] for doing it we are not it's not going
[9:48] unnoticed
[9:49] because you are saying to the world this
[9:51] is important because it's important to
[9:53] god
[9:54] and you're loving them and giving
[9:55] yourself to them every day until someday
[9:58] they're on their own and you can sit and
[10:00] have your coffee
[10:01] all morning long or go to cracker bell
[10:05] with your husband
[10:06] every friday night like we do
[10:09] there's a day coming sis we'll all
[10:12] change
[10:13] and the whole house will be quiet not a
[10:16] single thing
[10:17] move not even wait a minute
[10:20] getting into christmas poems now
[10:23] there's a day coming but guess what now
[10:26] your attention's not on a big career
[10:28] and leaving the home this that and the
[10:32] other
[10:32] god bless you for giving your attention
[10:35] to your family and children god bless
[10:38] you
[10:39] and we we thank you for it
[10:45] [Applause]
[10:48] god bless the young men that are leading
[10:51] their families and
[10:52] bringing them to church and teaching
[10:53] them the word of god and having that
[10:55] influence in life god bless you you're
[10:56] to be praised this morning god bless the
[10:58] young people that
[10:59] are not leaving things undone the young
[11:01] people we have some young people here
[11:02] that are
[11:03] rarities in this world they're just rare
[11:07] who who say that you know it's not the
[11:10] god's word says it's part of my
[11:11] inheritance
[11:12] not to fornicate or be with someone or
[11:15] touch one another physically before
[11:17] marriage or kiss one another
[11:18] until the wedding day that's part of my
[11:20] spiritual inheritance and there's some
[11:22] young people saying
[11:23] that's part of my inheritance and guess
[11:25] what i'm sticking with it i'm not
[11:26] leaving that part undone the rest of the
[11:28] world says it's not important
[11:29] i'm saying it's important we have young
[11:31] people sitting here that says it's
[11:32] important to god it's important to me
[11:34] we're going to do it
[11:37] praise the lord let's give them a hand
[11:39] too god bless you
[11:48] there's believers do not leave anything
[11:52] undone
[11:53] it's it's not just and to the mothers i
[11:56] mentioned and to the young people and
[11:57] the young
[11:58] married men and the young single men
[12:01] they're
[12:01] they're doing it and it's and it's not
[12:03] they're not just doing it because
[12:04] there's a quote
[12:05] necessarily they might know all the
[12:09] quotes and they might not know all the
[12:10] quotes
[12:11] but they're doing it you see they're
[12:14] leaving nothing undone
[12:16] they might not know all the things but
[12:17] but something in them is saying
[12:19] this is what i want to do and i want to
[12:21] fight for
[12:22] what god said is mine if i have a
[12:25] spiritual life as a young man
[12:27] i want to fight for that and it's a
[12:29] battle you don't think it's a battle for
[12:31] sisters to wear what they wear in the
[12:33] world they live in you don't think it's
[12:34] a battle with social media when
[12:36] other people calling themselves
[12:37] christians and sometimes message
[12:39] believers
[12:39] taking on the makeup and all these other
[12:41] things you don't think that's a battle
[12:43] an influence on a young one when that
[12:44] says well that's
[12:45] you got to do that to be pretty it's an
[12:47] absolute lie you don't have to do that
[12:48] to be pretty
[12:50] but it's a battle but guess what there's
[12:51] some saying listen but what does god's
[12:53] word say
[12:54] i want to be pleasing to the lord i want
[12:56] to be pleasing to my husband
[12:58] and so they're not looking for the cues
[12:59] there and many times they don't know all
[13:01] the quotes
[13:02] you don't have to know all the quotes
[13:03] and make this a religion you just got to
[13:05] say lord
[13:06] what is your will what is your will
[13:08] what's in your word i don't want to
[13:09] leave
[13:10] anything undone
[13:13] and i want to fight for what's mine can
[13:15] you say amen
[13:16] these are those under the joshua
[13:18] commission these are believers under the
[13:20] joshua commission
[13:21] and it is a fight but they are winning
[13:24] and
[13:24] some you know i know some have given up
[13:27] that fight and they still want to claim
[13:29] parts of the message the parts that they
[13:30] want
[13:31] but this group is to be thanked this
[13:33] morning and god gets glory in their
[13:35] lives
[13:35] because they want to leave nothing
[13:37] undone
[13:38] so want to tie together this morning all
[13:40] things under your feet and
[13:42] joshua leaving nothing undone it means
[13:44] completion it means joshua wanted to
[13:46] complete this
[13:47] he means he does not want to leave
[13:49] anything out there's a land there and
[13:51] there's an inheritance
[13:52] and i want all of it i want to possess
[13:55] that land
[13:56] i want to take that land for me and if
[13:58] nobody else does it i want to take that
[14:00] land
[14:01] and so we this breaks down to our
[14:03] inheritance in jesus christ
[14:05] it's easy to speak of joshua but we have
[14:07] to get down
[14:08] real plain about how we can leave
[14:11] certain things out and certain things
[14:13] undone and neglect certain things
[14:16] and we have to make this word applicable
[14:19] uh or we just don't
[14:21] we don't want to get to a place where we
[14:22] don't see this spiritual truth in this
[14:26] inheritance
[14:27] and the seals being revealed is not a
[14:30] part
[14:31] of our everyday battle in everyday life
[14:34] in our everyday victory can you say amen
[14:36] i want to remind you of a scripture i
[14:39] read last sunday in
[14:41] luke 11 42 but woe unto you pharisees
[14:44] for ye titheman and rue in all manner of
[14:47] herbs and passover judgment and the love
[14:49] of god
[14:50] these ought ye to have done and not to
[14:53] leave the other
[14:54] undone there's that word undone and so
[14:56] jesus said to the
[14:58] religious people you're doing something
[15:00] you're leaving lesser things undone and
[15:02] there are important things and you're
[15:04] leaving them alone you're
[15:05] you're ignoring them did you ever notice
[15:08] that the pharisees
[15:09] emphasized outward things
[15:12] like paying their tithes or what they
[15:14] wore how loud their prayers were
[15:16] and the love of god and judgment and
[15:19] things that are inward things they're
[15:20] leaving those things undone
[15:24] and religion will lean you towards
[15:28] outward things
[15:30] and leave inward things
[15:33] undone i'm taking my time because i want
[15:37] this to sink in real deep
[15:39] this i am preaching the joshua
[15:41] commission because you have a spiritual
[15:44] land
[15:44] and all of us have not conquered all of
[15:47] it yet
[15:48] we need to possess all of it and and so
[15:52] religion jesus is pointing out something
[15:54] about all pharisees and all ages
[15:56] is that they'll lean towards putting
[15:58] emphasis on things they think are
[15:59] important
[16:00] and leave little things undone but
[16:02] they're not little things they're
[16:03] important things they're inward things
[16:04] the love of god
[16:05] these things when people preach the
[16:07] message and leave the love of god out
[16:09] there's something desperately wrong with
[16:10] that
[16:12] that's a phariseeism can you say amen
[16:15] if there's no genuine victory in divine
[16:17] love then we're not preaching the
[16:19] message right
[16:20] it has to be rooted in divine love
[16:22] everything that you administer as a
[16:24] parent or as a pastor
[16:26] or whatever quote that you have that's
[16:29] going to get across to the people
[16:31] anything that you have that's the truth
[16:33] it must become
[16:34] from the root and the motive of divine
[16:37] love
[16:38] you need a victory in divine love before
[16:40] you apply the quotes
[16:43] i didn't mention it last sunday but the
[16:45] token is preached for years apply the
[16:47] token apply the token
[16:48] get this out of your house kick this out
[16:50] kick the tv out kick these other things
[16:52] and so so many years that's what was
[16:54] preached what to kick
[16:55] out and then he says apply it to your
[16:57] family and later
[16:58] they don't read the quote later that
[17:00] says when you go apply it
[17:02] apply it with such love that you believe
[17:06] it's going to get results
[17:08] i know a lot of homes and daddies that
[17:09] went in and applied it but there was no
[17:12] love when they applied it i know a lot
[17:15] of preachers that have preached this
[17:16] message
[17:17] and there was no love when they applied
[17:20] it
[17:20] there was no divine love there's no
[17:22] victory of divine love in that man's
[17:24] life
[17:25] to read the quotes to the people and if
[17:27] we do that it gets to be a religion can
[17:29] you say amen
[17:30] it turns into just making the people do
[17:33] something
[17:34] i believe the quotes with all of my
[17:36] heart
[17:37] but this thing according to first
[17:39] corinthians 13
[17:40] must be rooted in divine love
[17:43] paul said if i have faith to move remove
[17:46] mountains
[17:47] he says and though i understand all the
[17:49] mysteries
[17:50] it means absolutely nothing without
[17:53] divine love
[17:55] this has to be rooted in a victory in
[17:58] divine love first and you get that
[18:00] through the filling of the holy ghost
[18:03] it's not just this worldly
[18:05] love you know mamzy pansy thing it's the
[18:08] holy ghost love
[18:09] it's christ and you get him on the
[18:11] inside and that's the motive for
[18:12] everything well here's a quote
[18:14] here's what i need to do but you do it
[18:16] out of love you don't do it because
[18:17] you're going to go to hell
[18:19] say i better do that my daddy taught me
[18:21] to do that my mommy told you i better do
[18:23] that and
[18:23] thank god for people who respect it even
[18:25] when they don't understand it they do it
[18:26] out of respect for their parents
[18:28] god will bless you for that sometimes
[18:29] people do out of respect for the pastor
[18:31] god bless you for that i appreciate that
[18:33] that's a good thing god will bless you
[18:34] for that
[18:35] but the motive needs to be the holy
[18:37] ghost love on the inside
[18:39] and the pharisees religion whatever age
[18:42] it is
[18:42] including in our ranks sometimes we
[18:45] make the message a religion because we
[18:48] emphasize
[18:49] the outside parts i should be getting
[18:53] a bigger amen than that because you know
[18:56] it's true
[19:00] i'm not dumping out or leaving undone
[19:02] any of the outside parts
[19:04] but if it goes with the motive without
[19:06] divine love it comes under pharisee
[19:13] and so when i read the book that says
[19:14] joshua that says he left nothing undone
[19:17] of all the land to be conquered
[19:19] i want to get specific here and say to
[19:21] you that i see when i read that
[19:23] because i bring it into my own life i
[19:25] see that i'm a three-part being
[19:28] and i see that i see that i need a hook
[19:32] to put my
[19:35] we got all this money in this place and
[19:37] no money for a hook
[19:40] just lay it over here i guess
[19:46] you know you get all this and you
[19:47] complain you know you
[19:49] complain that you don't have a little
[19:50] hook how spoiled we can get
[19:55] i thank god for what god has provided
[19:57] for us
[19:58] supernaturally amen sometimes you have
[20:00] to stick to take a moment because it's
[20:02] all still surreal to me it's
[20:05] it's i feel very humbled
[20:08] by all this and i don't want to
[20:09] emphasize the building and talk about
[20:10] all that as much but
[20:11] every once in a while you got to say boy
[20:13] we we didn't deserve all this but god
[20:15] really blessed us didn't he
[20:17] amen so quit talking about and just
[20:19] preach brother paul
[20:23] amen so you know
[20:26] religion will lean you and so when i see
[20:29] joshua saying he left nothing undone i
[20:31] see myself and i say
[20:32] all of us are a three part being we're
[20:35] not just a soul
[20:37] the reason i say this is because some
[20:39] people
[20:41] think that once the soul is saved and
[20:43] the soul is filled with the holy ghost
[20:45] that's it
[20:47] but you're leaving other parts undone
[20:51] and joshua didn't leave anything undone
[20:53] as a matter of fact the greatest battle
[20:55] is when we have a spirit
[20:57] and a mind and emotions and these things
[21:00] that
[21:01] the the biggest battle is when when god
[21:03] really comes in by the holy ghost and
[21:05] fills you
[21:06] in the soul level the desire for the
[21:08] world is gone
[21:10] there's a change in your life i heard
[21:11] someone say even a couple sundays ago
[21:14] something happened to them right in the
[21:16] service while the word was being
[21:17] preached
[21:18] and there was just a release of
[21:21] of all all things praise god he's still
[21:26] he's still doing the work friends don't
[21:28] think we had to wait to the altar call
[21:29] he can fill you right now
[21:32] he can fill you right now if you
[21:33] surrender say i'm ready to give up
[21:34] everything
[21:35] for christ it's all about him now just
[21:37] have a yielding heart that way god is
[21:39] moving can you say amen but we're a
[21:41] three-part being so when someone gets
[21:42] filled with the holy ghost
[21:44] there's two other parts that satan is
[21:46] left with to really
[21:47] damage and to really work in and we
[21:50] can't say
[21:50] as christians those parts aren't
[21:52] important we have to say that's
[21:55] land that we want to possess if you're
[21:57] still in ephesians
[21:58] chapter 2 because this is our
[22:00] inheritance chapter now encourage you to
[22:02] read the whole book of ephesians
[22:04] because he says in chapter 2 and verse
[22:05] 21
[22:07] ephesians 2 and 21 in whom all the
[22:09] buildings fitly framed together growing
[22:12] unto a holy temple unto the lord now
[22:15] who's he talking about he's talking
[22:16] about the body of christ we're the
[22:18] temple
[22:18] but he's talking about your temple too
[22:20] other places in scripture
[22:21] he says that we're the temple of the
[22:24] holy ghost
[22:25] not just our soul but all of us we are a
[22:27] temple of the holy ghost
[22:29] all of your temple so does what you wear
[22:32] count yeah it counts
[22:35] right because this whole temple is the
[22:36] lord it's not just your soul
[22:38] see i got god in my soul but you know
[22:40] here he's smoking this cigarette now it
[22:42] doesn't work that way
[22:43] this is a building this is a holy temple
[22:45] unto the lord in whom we also are
[22:47] building together for a habitation of
[22:49] god
[22:49] through the spirit so in our inheritance
[22:51] now it's not just that we possess
[22:54] our soul or god possesses our soul but
[22:56] this whole temple
[22:57] becomes possessed by the lord and we
[22:59] take our land can you say amen
[23:01] if satan is trying to belittle us or
[23:04] take us in a certain area of our life
[23:06] we are a three-part being and it's not
[23:08] just the soul
[23:09] it's the whole temple of god in my short
[23:12] years on earth i see some things
[23:14] emphasized
[23:15] many times the glorious state of the
[23:18] soul and we've come to
[23:20] truth about that like no other people we
[23:23] preach it here we believe god has really
[23:25] revealed
[23:26] what the believer stands in as far as
[23:28] his standing with god
[23:30] being completely cleared in court and
[23:32] stands as a virtuous
[23:34] believer by the blood of jesus christ
[23:35] right now not coming someday you're not
[23:37] working your way into that
[23:39] you in your soul level you have been if
[23:41] you have the holy ghost
[23:43] you've passed judgment you won't stand
[23:45] at judge of the day you've passed from
[23:47] death unto life
[23:48] you are have been justified you have
[23:50] been sanctified
[23:51] you have been glorified and already sit
[23:54] in heavenly places with christ
[23:55] in the soul level boy that blows some
[23:58] people away
[23:59] that's the truth you're not trying to
[24:01] work your way towards that
[24:02] your soul is already in the presence of
[24:05] god
[24:08] amen that's the one and we preach that
[24:10] here but the problem is what i've seen
[24:12] is people
[24:13] so much preach the the the standing of
[24:15] their soul
[24:16] so many conventions preach so much about
[24:18] it but the other stuff is left undone
[24:23] and we then then eventually not
[24:25] everywhere but you get a pride which we
[24:27] can all get this
[24:28] that now that we're sealed in and we're
[24:30] predestinated before
[24:32] the foundation of the world and
[24:34] everything's cool everything's right
[24:36] case era i am as good as in the rapture
[24:40] i don't have to work my way to a rapture
[24:42] praise the lord what are you doing i'm
[24:44] just sitting here at the altar
[24:46] waiting for the rapture the problem with
[24:49] that
[24:50] you lose your fight
[24:53] you get a little loose and the devil
[24:56] says
[24:56] wow what a pride there i'm just gonna
[25:00] wreak havoc on this guy with temptation
[25:02] i'm just gonna bombard him i'm gonna get
[25:05] in his mind i'm gonna send him voices
[25:07] i'm gonna discourage
[25:09] i'm gonna do everything i can to cause
[25:11] him to make mistakes and everything
[25:13] because
[25:14] because this guy thinks it's all in the
[25:16] bag he's not going to
[25:17] fight me in any other area you don't
[25:20] think the devil's that smart
[25:22] i'll give him credit he's smart there is
[25:25] sometimes
[25:26] that he's real dumb
[25:29] like when he crucified the lord
[25:32] shouldn't have done that
[25:35] shouldn't have done it you never stop
[25:38] that now
[25:40] the devil is smart sometimes smarter
[25:42] than you is that
[25:43] you leave a larry in a hilaria an area
[25:46] uncovered
[25:47] or under you know this is not under the
[25:49] lord's headship he says okay
[25:51] i'll take it
[25:54] you let your mind wander nobody can see
[25:56] what you're thinking you let your mind
[25:57] wander mind water
[25:58] says okay there's all kinds of thoughts
[26:01] of all kinds of lustful things or
[26:03] whatever it is and
[26:05] depression and all kinds of fearful
[26:07] thoughts of what's
[26:08] possibly coming because you're leaving
[26:10] that un
[26:12] you say that's that's an un that's not
[26:15] no
[26:16] the bible says think on these things the
[26:19] bible is
[26:20] can you say man it's all the land that
[26:23] we possess
[26:24] and if the devil gets in we kick him out
[26:28] he and he will get in can you say he'll
[26:30] get in your thinking
[26:32] we don't talk about it often but i'll
[26:34] tell you
[26:35] a man is a man and the devil will really
[26:38] try to use images and things to get in
[26:40] the mind of a man
[26:41] we don't talk about it very much but you
[26:43] should talk about it with the lord
[26:45] you should get a good confident friend
[26:47] and you say we're going i'm going to i
[26:49] want to win this battle i don't want
[26:50] this private battle to go on
[26:53] and the devil's getting the best of me
[26:54] and you certainly don't want to say this
[26:56] that's up to me that's my oh my that's
[26:58] nobody that's nobody's business
[26:59] ah now the devil's got you in a piece of
[27:01] land that he's squatting on
[27:04] and you can't be free to worship the
[27:06] lord
[27:07] because you're bound by sexual demons
[27:11] so i'm starting to really relax now
[27:14] in the service and this may get very
[27:17] very personal
[27:20] because i'm not afraid of the devil and
[27:22] to talk about it
[27:25] there is some land in your life and you
[27:28] can't yield that land to the enemy
[27:31] you have to fight for it many times it's
[27:34] not your soul in most cases it's not the
[27:36] soul of people
[27:38] it's the emphasis in the message many
[27:41] times
[27:41] in other places has been the state of
[27:42] your soul that's where we have the
[27:44] movement of
[27:45] justification come out of luther's day
[27:47] and that swing from justification to
[27:49] sanctification because the way that
[27:51] in another restoration if it hadn't
[27:53] brought up the truth of sanctification
[27:55] then in justification people start doing
[27:57] any living any kind of life
[27:59] and say i'm going to heaven i'm
[28:00] justified luther preached it justified
[28:02] by faith justified by the lord
[28:04] and it's not nothing that i do so i
[28:05] don't have to do anything
[28:07] when it swings that way like it has
[28:09] sometimes in the message it's all about
[28:11] the predestination
[28:12] but there's nothing preached about the
[28:14] devil's binding people's lives
[28:16] in their hearts in their minds in their
[28:17] spirit there's nothing preached about it
[28:19] and we're in a battle now the soul is
[28:21] sealed in
[28:22] but we're in a battle to get to take all
[28:24] of our land brother boaz all the land
[28:28] everything not to leave anything undone
[28:30] is anybody understanding what i'm saying
[28:34] so we see that but we must take every
[28:37] part and not leave the mind or the heart
[28:39] or the spirit
[28:40] and so i have a quote here in power of
[28:41] transformation if you have the first
[28:43] quote there
[28:44] brother paul now that now that we have
[28:46] been
[28:47] we we tend to stop short of things okay
[28:50] but look what brother brahm says here
[28:52] now that we have been saved as we are
[28:54] and that we have been
[28:55] filled with the holy ghost as we have
[28:58] now
[28:59] now does anybody recognize a progression
[29:01] here
[29:02] now that we've been saved now we've been
[29:04] filled with the spirit
[29:06] that's it we're in we're done
[29:09] no now that we have saved now we've been
[29:11] filled holy as now
[29:12] now we want the mind that was in christ
[29:15] to be in us
[29:16] that we might be transformed changed
[29:19] transformed from the natural things of
[29:22] life
[29:23] and be brought in to do the perfect will
[29:25] of god
[29:26] by transformation of god's spirit by
[29:29] his word can you say amen praise the
[29:32] lord
[29:33] that explains it explains what i'm
[29:34] preaching better than i can preach and
[29:36] that is that
[29:36] now that we've been saved now that we've
[29:38] been filled with the holy ghost
[29:40] now we let the mind of christ that he
[29:42] changes us from the natural things of
[29:43] life
[29:44] i don't think he's talking about eating
[29:45] and natural things like that he's
[29:46] talking about a natural
[29:48] life mindset of things of the world or
[29:50] things that
[29:51] that are that we have in our thinking
[29:52] that needs to be purged out
[29:54] that we learn to think like god thinks
[29:57] so this is where we grow and this is
[29:59] where the land that we take is that lord
[30:01] if there's some natural things alive i
[30:02] want to be changed and transformed he
[30:04] goes on
[30:05] in the adoption message a little bit
[30:07] further he talks about back in 1960
[30:09] and the possession that the promise that
[30:12] was given to the church this is the next
[30:14] quote
[30:14] and the possession that the promise that
[30:16] was given to the church is not a natural
[30:18] land
[30:18] but a spiritual land for we are a royal
[30:21] priesthood a holy nation
[30:23] then in this royal priesthood holy
[30:25] nation particular people
[30:27] peculiar people called out elected
[30:30] chosen
[30:31] set aside then all the world is dead on
[30:33] the outside and we are led by the spirit
[30:36] sons and daughters of god are led by the
[30:38] spirit of god
[30:39] not by man but by the spirit all in love
[30:42] the whole thing is bundled up now this
[30:44] has been tried to be taught on many
[30:46] times and no doubt
[30:47] what great theologians have struck it a
[30:48] lot deeper than what i could
[30:50] but the thing i want to try to get to
[30:51] you is this that a man that is in christ
[30:54] with the holy ghost
[30:55] can bear with a man when he's wrong
[30:58] long-suffering gentle patient he's sweet
[31:02] humble faithful filled with the spirit
[31:05] never
[31:06] negative always positive he's a
[31:09] different person
[31:13] i'm so glad that brother brahm says
[31:14] those things you know what it does
[31:16] it convicts all of us that we still have
[31:18] land to possess
[31:20] he just talked about the inheritance the
[31:23] spiritual land for people
[31:25] and guess what he's not talking about
[31:26] the soul he's talking about what
[31:29] the holy ghost in the soul starts to do
[31:34] right if he didn't just said you're
[31:37] saved you're predestinated
[31:38] it's done you're in the soul but he
[31:40] didn't he starts to talk about
[31:42] that a man that has this is long
[31:44] suffering is gentle
[31:45] he can bear with a man when he's wrong
[31:47] can you bear with somebody when they're
[31:49] wrong
[31:53] that's a good question can you bear with
[31:57] somebody when they're dead wrong
[32:00] or do you got to continue proving that
[32:02] they are wrong until they get on their
[32:04] knees
[32:05] and in sackcloth and ashes repent before
[32:08] you
[32:09] i was wrong until i hear those words i
[32:12] was
[32:12] a lot of people can't say that i was i
[32:14] was
[32:16] they can't say it well until you say it
[32:18] i'm not forgiving you
[32:20] i'm not bearing with you you're just
[32:22] wrong and i'm waiting for that
[32:24] but the holy ghost can bear with
[32:27] a person that's wrong
[32:31] you know why you can bear with it
[32:32] because you're wrong sometimes
[32:35] can i get an amen
[32:38] if you're taking an inheritance then
[32:40] it's part of this it's he can bear with
[32:42] a man that's wrong he can
[32:44] long suffering gentle patient he's sweet
[32:47] humble
[32:47] faithful filled with the spirit never
[32:50] negative always positive i could
[32:52] stop and preach a whole sermon to all of
[32:54] us
[32:56] about never being negative but to be
[32:59] positive
[33:02] just give me a minute and i'll think
[33:03] about whether i want to do it or not
[33:05] right now
[33:08] there's some land that i need to possess
[33:12] because we way too negative
[33:16] we speak way too negative we find the
[33:19] thing that's wrong
[33:20] and complain and criticize the negative
[33:23] things and we're always negative
[33:25] and we miss speaking about the positive
[33:31] amen he's never negative always positive
[33:35] he's a
[33:36] he's a different person praise the lord
[33:39] so in pointing to
[33:40] our book of ephesians here it's a very
[33:43] special book if you have your bibles
[33:45] open
[33:45] this is a very special book because
[33:47] brother brahma says ephesians parallels
[33:49] joshua so as joshua takes the people and
[33:51] they take their land
[33:53] what is talked about in ephesians is our
[33:55] spiritual inheritance
[33:56] it starts out with our position that we
[33:58] are in heavenly places in christ
[34:00] with all things under our feet because
[34:03] of christ
[34:03] what a revelation that is but as we come
[34:06] along in the book of ephesians we
[34:08] realize it's not all about the soul it's
[34:10] not all about being in a position in
[34:11] christ
[34:12] it's not affecting our everyday life and
[34:14] our
[34:15] our character it's not all about the
[34:17] soul
[34:19] if brother brahman says if he a man can
[34:21] bear with a man who's wrong
[34:22] that's more than just a soul that's that
[34:24] that man is it's how that man is acting
[34:27] towards others
[34:28] that's part of your land how that man is
[34:31] thinking towards others
[34:32] that's part of taking your land
[34:36] our thought life every day is part of
[34:39] taking our land
[34:41] our treatment of other people is part of
[34:44] taking our land
[34:48] it's not just that we have doctrine in
[34:50] this message and we have all the seals
[34:52] and we have all this thing
[34:54] and that's what we talk about and it's
[34:56] liberated the soul and all
[34:58] it's it's not just that's not a part the
[35:00] word opening the seals making off
[35:02] brought us as an entrance into this
[35:04] spiritual life
[35:06] it's the entrance into it but that of
[35:09] itself that i know what the first seal
[35:11] is
[35:11] doesn't guarantee that i'm living a
[35:14] character
[35:14] that's expressing jesus christ
[35:19] if it is a true revelation it brings you
[35:21] to your spiritual inheritance
[35:22] and you see your name in the book of
[35:24] life it's not just brother branham's
[35:26] name
[35:26] it's not just all the reformers it's not
[35:29] just your mom and dad
[35:30] but you see your name and your part in
[35:33] the book of life
[35:34] this is me this is my identity here's my
[35:37] land
[35:37] somebody showed me my land and now i'm
[35:39] gonna go fight for it and get it
[35:41] nobody else fights for your land except
[35:44] you
[35:44] teenager nobody else fights for your
[35:46] land not even your parents
[35:47] you get a grit about you say god's given
[35:49] me something he's given me a great rich
[35:51] heritage here or an inheritance and i'm
[35:54] gonna fight for it as a teenager i'm
[35:56] gonna fight for what's mine
[35:59] amen so we have it but we sometimes say
[36:03] it's just the soul but it's
[36:04] it's all of these things you know when i
[36:06] was a teenager i looked in the bible
[36:08] first corinthians 7 different places i
[36:09] said
[36:10] what is the position of a believer
[36:12] teenager
[36:13] what's the position what's he do and so
[36:15] i've not only studied that but i
[36:17] i've read it in youth meetings for years
[36:19] because i'm trying to point to
[36:20] their position in the scripture this is
[36:22] you this is your land
[36:24] you're going to be married someday and
[36:25] that's not going to be your land anymore
[36:27] you're going to be in the land of
[36:28] marriage
[36:30] it's a whole different land and he's got
[36:32] all the scriptures that have to do with
[36:33] marriage
[36:33] you're not in that land your position
[36:35] your position in christ
[36:36] is to be a holy ghost filled single
[36:39] young person
[36:40] taking all of your land what's it mean
[36:41] well oh boy we start talking about it
[36:43] you come into your early
[36:44] teens and you struggle with this your
[36:46] hormones are racing and all these like
[36:48] what do i do with these hormones how do
[36:49] i do this how do i give it to the lord
[36:51] how do i balance between normal
[36:54] affections and infatuations towards the
[36:55] opposite sex that's
[36:57] god made you like that and dividing that
[36:59] between temptation and yielding to
[37:01] temptation
[37:01] and thinking wrong thoughts that's a
[37:03] battle for a young person
[37:05] but it's not nothing god didn't know
[37:07] about because he put stuff in there to
[37:09] help you
[37:10] now you can be like most people in this
[37:12] world say i don't want that
[37:14] i don't care what the inheritance there
[37:16] is i'm going to deal with this my own
[37:18] way
[37:19] you you're in a statistic in the rest of
[37:21] the world but there's a few young people
[37:23] to rise up and say
[37:24] what's my position in my land in the
[37:26] scripture
[37:27] what can i fight for amen
[37:31] so it's about other things it's about
[37:34] your position in christ but it's
[37:36] are you fighting for the things of yours
[37:38] now if you have your ephesians bible and
[37:39] i know how quick you guys could stay
[37:41] with me in the scripture
[37:42] now open it up if you would ephesians
[37:45] chapter 4 and verse 19.
[37:47] it says verse 18 says having
[37:51] the understanding darken being alienated
[37:53] from the life of god
[37:55] well verse 17 helps us out here i'm
[37:57] going to do a little teaching here
[37:59] and then we'll find a place to to close
[38:02] but everybody's still with me right
[38:05] listen close now because we're getting
[38:06] real practical
[38:07] this is our inheritance book now
[38:08] ephesians okay you can't dump this out
[38:10] can't leave this stuff undone and if
[38:13] you're not living it today you ought to
[38:14] just say lord
[38:15] it's part of my land i'm not there yet
[38:17] but i'm going to start fighting for this
[38:19] this is mine this i say or therefore and
[38:21] testify in the lord that he henceforth
[38:23] walk not as other gentiles walk in the
[38:25] vanity of their mind the emptiness of
[38:26] the mind
[38:27] so as christians we don't walk in this
[38:30] emptiness of mine that the rest of
[38:31] gentiles and people walk in
[38:33] we fill our minds with something
[38:37] and we don't fill our minds with all
[38:38] kinds of things of the world we don't
[38:40] fill our minds with all kinds of trash
[38:42] and
[38:43] you know that's why their minds are
[38:46] empty
[38:47] having understanding dark and being
[38:48] alienated from the life of god through
[38:50] their ignorance that is in them because
[38:51] of the blindness of their heart
[38:52] who being past feeling have given
[38:54] themselves over unto lasciviousness
[38:56] to work all uncleanness with greediest
[38:58] now what i see in that scripture is that
[39:01] they have gone past feeling okay
[39:04] the born-again soul will have
[39:07] feeling and sensitivity to what's wrong
[39:13] because their past feeling but our land
[39:16] is to not be
[39:17] past feeling and everybody's grown
[39:20] enough to learn i hope that
[39:22] i'll if you only feed on movies and
[39:25] music of the world and you're hardly
[39:27] ever in the word
[39:29] you're going to get a numbness
[39:33] towards this guy preaching towards
[39:36] things of the lord
[39:37] even your parents talking about it
[39:39] because why all that stuff
[39:41] desensitizes you that you're not
[39:43] sensitive to the holy spirit anymore
[39:46] some people are so hard they can't even
[39:48] be moved the presence of god is right
[39:51] there
[39:51] and they can't even be moved by it
[39:53] because they're full of all kinds of
[39:55] movies
[39:56] and everything else all the time
[39:59] i'm not against watching a good
[40:00] wholesome movie that's not there's
[40:02] nothing wrong with that but i'm talking
[40:04] about who's somebody who's
[40:05] that's their life and their ins they
[40:07] come they're not
[40:08] sensitive anymore they've lost feeling
[40:12] that's why you have a guy sitting there
[40:14] for hours he's left his job and
[40:16] everything
[40:17] he might still be with his mom in the
[40:18] video in the basement playing videos
[40:20] but some of them been married they lose
[40:22] their jobs don't give attention to their
[40:23] wife don't want to provide for their
[40:25] wife
[40:25] don't want to eat anything he's addicted
[40:27] to video games and he's past feeling he
[40:29] doesn't even have feeling anymore for
[40:30] his wife
[40:36] praise the lord their past
[40:39] feeling but a person that's born again
[40:41] has a birth in their soul
[40:42] will have feeling and they'll be
[40:45] sensitive
[40:47] to what's wrong if we lose
[40:50] the sensitivity to what's wrong and
[40:52] right we're in a dangerous spot
[40:55] we're like the other gentiles so part of
[40:57] our land
[41:00] part of our land is
[41:05] i'm just stopping for a minute i'm just
[41:07] thinking about this
[41:08] part of the land that we possess as a
[41:10] christian
[41:11] is to have true feeling
[41:15] and sensitivity to the holy spirit
[41:22] part of our land are you going to fight
[41:24] for it today
[41:25] and you may be a person here who's lost
[41:27] feeling for that maybe a preacher has
[41:28] hurt you or whatever's happened you've
[41:30] lost your sensitivity
[41:31] that you've got your walls all up and
[41:33] you're all blocked towards everything
[41:34] you might come to church but your walls
[41:36] are all up because you've lost your
[41:37] feeling for the holy spirit
[41:38] something's hurt your feeling the bible
[41:41] says there's people that their
[41:42] conscience are
[41:43] seared with an iron they don't even have
[41:45] a conscience anymore
[41:46] you see but our our land that god gives
[41:49] us is we have a sensitivity to the holy
[41:51] spirit
[41:52] and i think it's a sensitivity to other
[41:54] people
[41:56] now we're not compromisers but we have
[41:58] to have a love
[41:59] and a feeling we're not brother braham
[42:01] said back in the 50s he says
[42:03] people are losing the fearling feelings
[42:05] they don't even know who their neighbors
[42:06] are they don't even greet one another
[42:08] when they go down the street
[42:09] they lose normal feeling and doesn't it
[42:11] say their
[42:12] the spirit that will come in the last
[42:13] days is is uh heady high-minded lovers
[42:16] of pleasure more than lovers of god
[42:18] truce breakers false accusers
[42:20] incontinent despisers of those that are
[42:22] good
[42:22] and i keep mentioning them because i'm
[42:23] trying to get to the one that i want to
[42:25] preach on
[42:26] and that who being past feeling is that
[42:28] it no there's something about feeling
[42:29] there
[42:30] where they lose the sensitivity and
[42:32] feeling without here it is
[42:34] without natural affection
[42:38] there's no more natural affection the
[42:39] extreme of that is the homosexuals
[42:41] that's not a natural affection that's a
[42:44] perversion
[42:45] that's an abomination
[42:49] but that's the extreme of it but it
[42:51] starts by losing our feelings lose our
[42:53] feelings for others
[42:54] losing our heart that we can't sit down
[42:56] and have a heart-to-heart conversation
[42:58] about the lord or about where you're at
[43:00] or about what your troubles you're
[43:01] having or
[43:02] help me pray with me we lose that and we
[43:05] become cold towards people
[43:06] because we've lost trust in people we've
[43:09] lost trust in preachers
[43:10] we've lost trust in churches we've lost
[43:13] trust
[43:14] in god sometimes come on friends i
[43:18] i told you i'd be honest this is
[43:20] realities and if you live in this
[43:22] culture
[43:23] everything's designed to make you
[43:25] insensitive in your heart
[43:27] and cold bible says in the last days
[43:32] prophecy in luke
[43:33] the love of many will grow cold
[43:36] and the only fine place you find
[43:38] genuinely real love heart feeling love
[43:40] and the true divine holy ghost love
[43:42] is in the elect that's what he said it's
[43:44] all gone
[43:46] so we're praying and saying wait a
[43:47] minute satan's not going to take it from
[43:49] us
[43:51] i want a sensitivity to the moving of
[43:54] the holy spirit
[43:56] i want my children to see me and i want
[43:59] them to be
[44:00] they know when the presence of god is so
[44:02] strong and so near
[44:04] that they're not going to get up and
[44:05] start walking out and try to push it off
[44:07] they say this is right where i want to
[44:10] be right now
[44:13] and if it moves me to tears it changes
[44:15] my let it do what it wants to do
[44:17] let my child weep in the presence of god
[44:21] i want my children to come to me and
[44:23] feel open to share their heart and not
[44:24] feel
[44:25] distant from me but we become cold and
[44:28] and we push one another away
[44:32] part of our land is
[44:35] retaining our feelings the gentiles our
[44:37] past feeling but retaining our feelings
[44:38] and not just just our emotional human
[44:40] feelings but the feeling
[44:42] of god inside for other people
[44:46] a real compassion
[44:50] for people brother paul i wish you'd
[44:53] preach the message
[44:57] i am preaching the message i'm preaching
[45:00] our inheritance
[45:02] i didn't realize until i got into this i
[45:04] could take a sermon on each of these but
[45:05] if you come down
[45:06] verse 23 says and be renewed in the
[45:09] spirit of your mind i thought our
[45:11] inheritance was all about our soul
[45:14] if it's all about the soul that when why
[45:16] is paul saying that
[45:18] we we be renewed in the spirit of our
[45:19] mind
[45:22] pretty important verse 25 says put away
[45:27] all lying speak every man truth with his
[45:30] neighbor if it's all about the soul
[45:33] our inheritance that's our only land
[45:36] then why is he instructing us not to lie
[45:39] especially as christians we don't lie we
[45:41] don't
[45:43] on our taxes
[45:50] we just twist the twist things a little
[45:52] bit when we tell somebody else the story
[45:54] and
[45:54] add to it or take away from it
[45:58] part of our land that we inherit and
[46:01] take and fight for
[46:03] is i want to speak the truth in love
[46:10] all of you are in the workforce can
[46:12] anybody raise their hand testify
[46:14] we're in a world that people cannot tell
[46:15] the truth they lie all the time
[46:17] i can't tell if they're telling the
[46:18] truth or not we got politicians we've
[46:21] got presidents
[46:23] probably on both sides that have done
[46:25] some lying
[46:27] that's why there's no trust when people
[46:28] lie there's no trust right
[46:31] we have people that are lying to us
[46:35] that's why there's no trust
[46:36] so there's got to be a people rise up
[46:38] more and more and say
[46:39] we're going to be a people of truth
[46:41] we're going to speak the truth
[46:43] whether it's the word truth or whatever
[46:44] it is we're going to be people
[46:46] of the truth this is my land it's not
[46:49] just about the soul
[46:50] oh boy if it's all about the soul why
[46:52] does verse 26 say if you got it open
[46:54] be ye angry and sin not let the not the
[46:57] sun go down upon the wrath paul
[46:59] don't don't talk about our anger
[47:02] everybody gets anger everybody gets the
[47:06] their nose out of joint gets mad for
[47:07] years that uncle
[47:09] jed
[47:15] if it's all just about the soul or land
[47:17] then why is he talking about anger
[47:20] must be part of our land to possess
[47:25] because as satan gets on that land
[47:28] and keeps you angry there's other things
[47:31] that comes
[47:32] from you being angry things begin to
[47:35] break down
[47:37] so he's saying resolve through the holy
[47:39] spirit resolve our anger
[47:41] by the end of the day resolve it take it
[47:44] to the lord in prayer
[47:45] oh what peace we often forfeit take it
[47:48] to the lord in prayer
[47:49] bring it to his throne say god i'm very
[47:52] upset of what this person has done i
[47:54] i don't understand why he would say that
[47:56] or do that what she would say or do that
[47:58] but lord i'm leaving it at the altar
[48:00] tonight because this is bigger than me
[48:02] and i don't want it to fester in my
[48:04] spirit i don't want the devil to get a
[48:06] hold of it
[48:09] my emotions do not belong to the devil
[48:12] to
[48:12] exploit my emotions belong to you
[48:17] tonight lord
[48:18] and i lay my anger at your feet
[48:21] somebody say praise the lord it's part
[48:23] of our land
[48:31] if it's all about the soul then why does
[48:33] paul say in our inheritance chapter
[48:35] verse 20 eight let him that stole steel
[48:38] no more but rather let him labor working
[48:40] with his hands a thing which is good
[48:42] that he may have to give to him that
[48:43] needeth
[48:44] why'd you have to talk about that
[48:45] because part of a christian's land i
[48:47] believe
[48:47] is not stealing but laboring and being
[48:50] able to give
[48:53] why does he say if it's all about the
[48:55] verse 29 let no corrupt communication
[48:57] proceed out of your mouth corrupt is is
[49:00] old
[49:00] and it's stale and it's i'm thinking of
[49:04] other words right now but
[49:05] you have to study that word corrupt
[49:08] communication
[49:09] it's not positive it's corrupt
[49:11] communication proceed out of your mouth
[49:12] but that which is good to the use of
[49:14] edifying that it may minister grace to
[49:15] the ears
[49:16] this is part of our land that's what you
[49:18] have to fight for
[49:19] and some of you have to fight for that
[49:20] more than others
[49:22] for some of you it's a harder fight to
[49:25] not let
[49:26] corrupt communication proceed out of
[49:30] your mouth
[49:30] because it's happening it just it's
[49:32] become so natural to you it just spills
[49:34] out
[49:36] the negative spills out before the
[49:37] positive the corruptness and the old and
[49:40] you can be talking to somebody and you
[49:42] bring up some things from 20 years ago
[49:44] and it just
[49:45] spills out as if it just happened
[49:48] i'm guilty of it anybody
[49:51] else like that but to some people this
[49:54] fight
[49:55] will be harder than other people
[49:58] but whatever your land is as satan's
[50:00] taken you've got to fight for it
[50:03] i see this now i see this maybe this
[50:05] morning you see it but maybe another
[50:06] thing through the words
[50:07] i see it it's been exposed lord i'm
[50:10] going to start fighting for this help me
[50:12] i'm going to lay this at the altar i'm
[50:13] going to start fighting for this land
[50:15] that is better have better communication
[50:18] coming out of
[50:19] my mouth if it's all about the soul then
[50:22] why does paul bring up
[50:24] in verse 31 let all bitterness and wrath
[50:26] and anger and clamor
[50:27] and evil speaking be put away from me
[50:29] with all manners
[50:31] how many years are we going to have
[50:32] christians professing the message and
[50:33] the holy ghost
[50:34] and they're bitter people
[50:37] they hold on to their bareness how long
[50:40] are you going to go that way
[50:43] you're missing some land that's yours
[50:45] and that is to dissolve that bitterness
[50:47] by the cross and the forgiveness of
[50:49] jesus christ
[50:50] and say i'm going to take back this land
[50:52] and i'm not going to be a bitter person
[50:54] anymore somebody say praise the lord
[50:57] it's not all about the soul it's the
[50:59] bitterness gets in your spirit
[51:01] and clamor and evil speaking
[51:04] let it be put away gossip let it be put
[51:08] away from you that might be your issue
[51:10] that the devil's taking that land for
[51:11] years
[51:12] and you just become a professional
[51:14] gospel and give yourself
[51:15] permission to talk about anything and
[51:17] you ought to say no i don't want to
[51:19] speak
[51:19] evil of others i'm taking back this land
[51:23] and let god do with him whatever he does
[51:25] but what you're going to hear out of my
[51:26] mouth
[51:26] is a positive thing i'm going to give
[51:28] that person the benefit of the doubt
[51:30] and when someone hears me speak of them
[51:32] i'm going to say let's pray for them
[51:36] you're taking your land instead of what
[51:38] you learned from your parents or what
[51:39] you learned from your past church
[51:41] that gossip is normal and we just talk
[51:43] and say anything that we want to say
[51:45] i'm here to say instruct you as a pastor
[51:47] we don't give ourselves permission to
[51:48] say
[51:49] anything we want to say we bring this
[51:51] tongue unto the holy spirit say
[51:52] god help me to stay the right and when i
[51:54] say it out of place let me ask
[51:55] forgiveness for it make it right
[51:58] bitterness is important that we get over
[52:00] that and we grow out of it can you say
[52:02] amen
[52:02] what about 32 that says and be kind one
[52:05] to another
[52:06] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[52:09] as
[52:09] god for christ's sake has forgiven you
[52:12] why is kindness to others important i
[52:15] thought it was just the soul
[52:19] kindness forgiving some people have
[52:22] become so hard on their walls up they
[52:23] can't even be around anybody anymore
[52:26] especially the church people they got
[52:29] their walls up
[52:34] there's a t-shirt in the
[52:37] display in the store the other day it
[52:39] said
[52:41] i thought it was quite comical when the
[52:43] t-shirt said when this covet is over i
[52:45] still want some people to stay away from
[52:46] me
[52:52] so i sent it to my kids and
[52:56] there's certain family members that i'd
[52:58] like to get him that t-shirt
[53:01] i thought it was funny there's certain
[53:04] people i just would rather
[53:05] just continue this on stay away from me
[53:10] it's how we get sometimes especially
[53:12] ones that we don't like
[53:14] there's some people that don't like
[53:15] hardly anybody i'm good brother paul to
[53:18] get out of my car
[53:19] come in this church enjoy your preaching
[53:21] and get back in my car and go
[53:23] because i love the lord but i can't
[53:26] stand people
[53:30] i understand you can do that for a while
[53:32] but if you if you come in and hear the
[53:34] preaching
[53:36] you're probably going to hear you can't
[53:39] always be that way
[53:41] i'm going to preach the bible
[53:44] and it says things like our land is to
[53:47] be forgiving
[53:48] and to be kind and to be courteous
[53:52] well people in the world can do that
[53:53] yeah i know well they're doing better
[53:55] than you i guess
[53:58] but i think it's part of our land as a
[54:00] christian not just the seals
[54:02] but being kind and forgiving to people
[54:05] who have wronged us
[54:08] you got your walls up today no matter
[54:10] what people have done
[54:11] you got walls up towards god you got the
[54:13] walls up to the gospel or you got walls
[54:15] up to people
[54:17] you know we we have people that can be
[54:20] around
[54:21] everybody else in their life except
[54:25] church people except this church they
[54:28] block this church
[54:29] and they can be around everybody else i
[54:31] don't know why it is but
[54:33] a person like that's got to hit the
[54:34] altar and come to the cross of christ
[54:36] you'll never get that out of the cross
[54:38] you can't be selective like that well
[54:41] they hurt me
[54:42] well then we overcome the people and say
[54:44] lord
[54:45] i've got to find within your calvary
[54:48] my land is to find the forgiveness
[54:52] for people who have hurt me
[54:59] not really a shouting service this
[55:01] morning is it
[55:03] not hanging from the lights
[55:15] i could go on and on verse chapter 5 and
[55:18] verse
[55:20] 1 says be there for followers of god
[55:21] walk in love as christ also loved us
[55:23] hath forgiven himself for us an offering
[55:25] and sacrifice fit for sweet smelling
[55:27] savior
[55:28] but fornication and uncleanness and
[55:29] covenants let it be not be once
[55:32] named among you is become insane neither
[55:34] filleth filthiness
[55:35] nor follow foolish talking or jesting
[55:37] which are not convenient but rather give
[55:38] them
[55:39] i thought it was all about the soul
[55:42] no it's in it's about fornication
[55:47] right it's about filthy talk
[55:50] filthy jesting filthy things
[55:54] it's not just so it has to do with your
[55:55] body too right
[55:58] filthy talk filthy foolish dirty jokes
[56:03] playing those dirty jokes on your phone
[56:04] all the time letting it pass by
[56:08] and being around fornicators the bible
[56:10] says just everybody listen
[56:11] the bible says have no fellowship with
[56:14] phone or caters
[56:16] whether they be in the church or out of
[56:17] the church you should study the bible
[56:20] and you're fellowshipping with them some
[56:22] people they can't fellowship around the
[56:23] church people can fellowship
[56:24] around fornicators bible says don't have
[56:26] any company
[56:28] it's our land is about the company we
[56:29] keep
[56:31] the bible says it it's not just about
[56:34] your soul
[56:36] it's not just about your love for the
[56:37] lord that he gave you
[56:39] but so much more could be said about
[56:41] fornicating spirits and adulterous
[56:43] spirits and
[56:44] if you hang around that long enough it
[56:46] may influence you
[56:47] that's why the bible says don't keep a
[56:49] lot of company with that
[56:51] because those spirits tend to influence
[56:53] you
[56:54] i'm trying to help that person well
[56:56] praise the lord that's good okay
[56:58] just don't forget the scriptures that
[56:59] part of your land is to not
[57:01] accompany yourself with fornicators
[57:06] so you know hey it goes on with more
[57:08] here
[57:10] for this you know that no hormone or
[57:12] unclean person nor covetous man who is
[57:14] an idolater hath any inheritance
[57:16] in the kingdom of god it's about our
[57:17] inheritance so these things just don't
[57:20] work it's not just about the soul
[57:22] it's about the body it's about the
[57:24] spirit it's about
[57:25] where the devil can take the land and
[57:27] this is our inheritance chapter
[57:31] should i just mention before we bring
[57:33] this to a close should i mention
[57:35] chapter 5 and verse 21
[57:39] submitting yourselves one to another
[57:42] should i go on
[57:46] that part of our land is submitting
[57:48] ourselves to one another
[57:50] am i going to submit to nobody my boss i
[57:53] told them that years ago and they're
[57:54] anybody i'm going to submit to
[57:58] should i go into the next scripture that
[58:00] says wives submit yourselves unto your
[58:01] own husbands as unto the lord
[58:08] can i preach that this is our
[58:09] inheritance and if you're a sister
[58:11] in christ with the holy ghost you're
[58:13] looking at that saying
[58:15] this is my land
[58:18] this is my land
[58:22] and i'm going to fight for it it might
[58:25] be harder on some sisters than others
[58:27] but this is part of my land if god said
[58:29] it he didn't say it for something mean
[58:31] he said it for a good thing and then i
[58:34] wouldn't leave it undone for you sisters
[58:36] to take 30
[58:36] 23 and say the husband is the head of
[58:38] the wife even as christ is the head of
[58:39] the church he's the savior body
[58:40] therefore as the church is subject in
[58:42] the christ
[58:42] so let the wives be to every husband
[58:48] no
[58:51] let the wives be subject to every man no
[58:55] unto their own husbands i should have
[58:57] gotten amen sisters from that
[59:00] husbands love your wife jesus christ
[59:02] also loved the church and gave himself
[59:04] forth love your wives as christ this is
[59:06] it's in our inheritance chapter
[59:09] brothers it's part of your land are you
[59:11] going to fight for it
[59:13] can you say amen
[59:16] why submit yourself to husbands it's not
[59:18] all about the soul there's more land to
[59:20] possess
[59:21] and we think our spiritual life it's
[59:24] it's it's just
[59:25] certain things but it's not just certain
[59:27] things it's all that it speaks of in the
[59:29] word of god
[59:30] that is our land nobody else is fighting
[59:32] for it but believers will fight for and
[59:34] say
[59:35] this is something that's mined i don't
[59:37] have it yet
[59:38] but this is mine and i'm leaving nothing
[59:41] undone can you say amen
[59:44] it's become so evident to me especially
[59:46] lately in this last political
[59:48] thing of this year and all the other
[59:50] stuff that's happened there's something
[59:52] in humans
[59:53] that want to fight for something there's
[59:55] something about them they like to join a
[59:57] fight
[59:57] take sides to protest something
[1:00:00] and that spirit is prevalent and it just
[1:00:03] it becomes a work of the flesh that's
[1:00:05] called variance how many knows what
[1:00:07] variance is a work of the flesh
[1:00:09] and a work of the flesh is is to be
[1:00:11] different to be poor some to be
[1:00:13] disagreeable
[1:00:14] to take the opposite side just the f for
[1:00:16] the sake of an argument
[1:00:17] there are some people that do that
[1:00:19] because they have a work of the flesh
[1:00:20] variants that's working in them
[1:00:22] and in the world they work by that work
[1:00:24] of the flesh all the time they're taking
[1:00:25] it
[1:00:25] just to take the opposite side i don't
[1:00:27] think everybody's like that
[1:00:29] but i do think too many people even in
[1:00:31] the message
[1:00:32] are influenced by this thing we got to
[1:00:34] take a side
[1:00:35] we got to protest something we got to
[1:00:37] fight for something
[1:00:40] we got to join a cause and we gotta
[1:00:42] fight we had to take a side there's so
[1:00:44] much of it
[1:00:45] we get pulled into it in social media
[1:00:48] and i said wednesday night
[1:00:50] we are not called to take sides with
[1:00:52] either political side
[1:00:54] to fight for that we're not called for
[1:00:56] that but i will tell you this morning
[1:00:58] we have something to fight for
[1:01:02] why do you make that your fight let's
[1:01:03] make this our fight

[1:01:11] talk all the energy and the protests and
[1:01:13] all these things
[1:01:14] and used it and channeled it to say god
[1:01:17] what is my land and my inheritance and i
[1:01:19] want all of it
[1:01:20] and i'm gonna fight for it if you took
[1:01:22] all the energy and put it out i'll tell
[1:01:23] you

[1:01:29] let's protest what the devil's doing in
[1:01:31] our lives

[1:01:34] let's stand against how the devil is
[1:01:35] wreaking havoc in our minds
[1:01:38] can you say man if we're going to have a
[1:01:40] cause let's
[1:01:41] fight for the cause of jesus christ and
[1:01:43] his word

[1:01:47] choose sides
[1:01:48] with the lord's side
[1:01:51] let's fight for our inheritance let's
[1:01:53] fight it's been given to us now

[1:01:58] you read it in the word say god that's
[1:02:00] mine

[1:02:04] chapter

[1:02:14] you want to join a cause join that cause

[1:02:23] protesting
[1:02:24] any kind of demon or devil that's trying
[1:02:26] to come against me
[1:02:27] and take my land this
[1:02:31] out here in this world i'm gonna keep
[1:02:34] reminding you and wednesday night i
[1:02:35] apologize to do it while everybody's
[1:02:37] here today i'll do it again publicly
[1:02:39] is that last year i feel like i need to
[1:02:41] apologize because i was a little bit
[1:02:42] influenced by all the news that i was
[1:02:44] watching
[1:02:44] and i was influenced a certain way and
[1:02:46] if that spilled over in the pulpit
[1:02:48] i want to publicly apologize and say
[1:02:50] that's wrong for a minister to do
[1:02:52] we may talk about what's happening in
[1:02:54] the news we might match it with the
[1:02:56] prophecy
[1:02:56] and incidentally i'm pretty excited
[1:02:58] today because i've seen a sixth vision
[1:03:02] fulfilled that a prophet seen many years
[1:03:04] ago can you say man
[1:03:06] the very color the very the color of her
[1:03:08] dress was described in the prophecy
[1:03:11] and for some of you who are waiting
[1:03:12] around there's only one part of that
[1:03:14] all six have been fulfilled there's only
[1:03:17] one left can you say man
[1:03:19] you better get the holy ghost and get
[1:03:20] ready for the coming of the lord
[1:03:23] but i am excited to see the prophecies
[1:03:25] fulfilled
[1:03:26] that's what i need to preach and show
[1:03:27] that in politics but i apologize if i
[1:03:30] leaned a certain way
[1:03:31] because i did because of what i was
[1:03:33] listening to and feeding on
[1:03:35] join a fight join a cause and i want to
[1:03:37] remind you
[1:03:38] both parties are corrupt you can't trust
[1:03:40] any of these men
[1:03:43] you don't have to say amen but you can't
[1:03:45] trust any of that system
[1:03:47] you don't know whether you're getting
[1:03:49] the truth or not
[1:03:51] but i have a thing you can trust this
[1:03:53] morning and it's not even me
[1:03:55] it's the word of god can you say man you
[1:03:58] can trust
[1:03:58] that you want to put your faith in
[1:04:02] a candidate or or something going on out
[1:04:04] there
[1:04:05] why don't you push to trust in a man
[1:04:07] that in the 1940s or whatever
[1:04:09] had seven visions six of them is
[1:04:12] fulfilled can you say man
[1:04:13] the seventh one is we don't know how
[1:04:16] close it is
[1:04:17] but why don't you push and tr your trust
[1:04:19] in something like that
[1:04:22] i can have confidence that god has
[1:04:25] spoken
[1:04:26] god knows what's going on
[1:04:30] and if you're going to fight for
[1:04:31] something
[1:04:34] i wish somebody would fight for these
[1:04:36] things in ephesians
[1:04:37] fight for loving your wife better fight
[1:04:40] for tearing down your walls in your
[1:04:42] heart

[1:04:44] forgiveness fight to establish new
[1:04:47] friends i make a call to you
