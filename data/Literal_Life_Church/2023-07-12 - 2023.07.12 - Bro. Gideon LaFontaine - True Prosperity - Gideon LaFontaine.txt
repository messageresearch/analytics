their hearts their ears tonight God let us let you move in a mighty way tonight Lord Jesus Lord we come expecting tonight Lord Jesus come now Lord meet us here tonight God I have my brother Caleb Campbell on my mind tonight Lord with the loss of his baby God lord would you comfort them tonight Comfort his wife Lord Jesus Lord Comfort them Lord be their peace Lord Jesus in this time of trouble Lord Jesus we love you Lord and we thank you God that's the pastor Lord Jesus as he's off Lord give him traveling mercies Lord help him to have a rest Lord Jesus we love you Lord we give you this service tonight in Jesus name amen amen and the bride said hey man are you happy to be in church tonight and then I am to praise the Lord for Wednesday nights amen you may be seated for a second before we turn to the word first of all I I wanted to say can you see this is he I shaved tonight and usually says he asks when I shave is Olivia in town [Laughter] so I just wanted to let you know that Olivia's not in town and I shaved so here we go so just pointing that out but um so yeah it's just just a life update it's it's an exciting time so we're uh really excited for you know life and moving on so just having the Lord lead us in this direction we are we're excited so um so let's all stand again so we're gonna go to scripture tonight Genesis 39 talking about Joseph um title tonight is true prosperity true prosperity amen so we have the back story of Joseph it's the prophet was prophet says he's a perfect closest to the type of Christ we can see in the scripture amen reject his by his brothers the Jews you know you see his life it just ties so perfectly what I've seen in the scripture I encourage you to go read the story of Joseph because what it lines up with the type with Christ and even us in relation to that you can see yourself so much in these stories and even even the story of you know the Temptation with him and Potiphar's wife you know you can see yourself you know as a young person you know you can see yourself going through those things and you can say you know the Lord brought me through those things amen he brought me through those those Temptations every single time amen and I can testify of that today amen but it was the Lord's doing the Lord put something inside of me say I'm not gonna I'm not gonna forsake the Lord my God Amen praise the Lord amen I love him too much amen praise the Lord so let's just read first 39 5. and it came to pass so this is this is after he is rejected by his brothers this is um when he's coming to Egypt and um he finds himself in a place where he's um he's in a good position as far as uh Pharaoh's house right so and it came to pass from the time that he had made him over to Overseer in his house and over all that he had all that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house in the field okay now we're going so this happened the Temptation with Potiphar's wife right we go down a little bit and we see in verse 20 through 23 and Joseph's Master took him and put him into the prison we're all familiar with the story and place where the king's prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him Mercy amen and gave him favor in the sight of The Keeper of the prison and The Keeper of the prison committed to Joseph all that the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it The Keeper of the prison look not to any of the anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him and that which he did the Lord made it to prosper right so we see that type and pers we see the comparison of Christ everywhere Christ is it prospers do you believe that tonight everywhere our Jesus Christ is it prospers amen so we see that comparison and we even see the comparison of Brother Kyle mentions it all the time but you see the two Beggars on or you see the two thieves on the cross we see that type right here in scripture of the Baker and um the Baker and the other one the butler there we go the butler the Baker and the Butler and you see Joseph I love what Joseph said you see the confidence Joseph has in his Lord you go down and uh they're they're wondering what the interpretation for the dream is and then you go down the 40 verse 8 and it says a little down and they're questioning it the Baker and the Butler and it says do not interpretations belong to God he's testifying of his God the interpretation belongs to God Amen tell me them I pray you amen he's got that confidence he's he was he's born peculiar peculiar I can't say that word that's a hard word peculiar so he was born that way right he was born and he was a seer right Joseph was a seer why don't you guys sit down no that'll be that'll be good I get I get going and I forget you know you guys are you guys are standing so so anyways Joseph knowing his identity as the coveted son right he's known as his identity as the Covenant son Joseph was a Seer he was peculiar from his young age right that's why his brothers hated him you can't tell on what you can tell the unwavering stance Joseph has all through his life you can just as you look in the scripture you can see just the unwavering Faith the unwavering steadfadness fastness he's had in his life God prospered everything Joseph put in his hand to do that's how I want to be is that how you want to be everything that God puts in your hand Lord take it God and let it Prosper amen there's nothing we can do but when we place it in God's hands that's when it will prosper amen praise the Lord the perfect type of Christ in his church even in prison Joseph prospered amen what a Time could you could you imagine being have you ever seen those some sometimes you can look up those things where you see how bad prison is you could could you could you imagine prospering in prison today Brother Kyle I mean could you imagine prospering in prison amen the word Prospect the word Prosper today I believe has a damper on it do you believe that the word Prosper today has a real damper on it Satan has took that word Prosper and changed it has changed that word Prosper by movies what we watch by things we see there's so many things that your eyes may see and it could see like Prosper what is Prosper amen and what is success what is that so you see the type Satan Satan took he takes everything and he perverts it that's all he can do amen he can only pervert so you have the modern church and this Prosperity Gospel as anybody anybody heard of Prosperity Gospel it's such a deception to this age such a deception I mean I've seen I was I was watching it's called American gospel and it's it's about that it's a whole it's a whole documentary on the lies that the enemies tell to these people in this church and we can see it as a totally false Doctrine right as prosperity and and what we can see it three things that make a man fall as woman popularity and money right what do you think of when you think of prosperity to the human mind what do we usually think money right we usually think money we usually think cars vacations housing money wealth we even think of the recent you know Tom Brady retiring have you anyone heard of that Tom Brady Maybe not maybe I'm the only one Tom Brady retiring but he's been in and out because he doesn't know where he's supposed to be his whole family left him he has all you know all the money in the world but he doesn't have anything amen it's the it's really sad to see and that's where that's what children look up to all the time they look up to these these Idols amen they look up to these things that are deceiving them of what is true Prosperity what is it amen you can see it's like you look at you can you look at bodybuilders you look at you know certain Idols in this world from Hollywood and you can be so deceived by what true Prosperity is hey man can I get an amen tonight amen what is true prosperity now bear with me here in the junction of time brother Branham says in 56 God doesn't promise a flower bed of ease don't false falsely a Christian or don't don't don't change a Christian's mind if you're witnessing to someone he's trying to say don't make it seem that it's going to be a flowery bed of ease and don't false falsely the message but tell them that everything and tell them that everything's going to be all right there's nothing going to harm you there's nothing going to ain't no trials or nothing that's wrong do you believe that that's wrong as the pro said must I carried on the heaven onto Heaven on a flowery bed of ease While others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody Seas no sir God doesn't promise ease and prosperity but he promises Grace to endure in every time aren't you glad tonight it gives us that Grace to keep sustaining keep moving forward Amen halleluia to endure every time it's the grace that we look to amen the immaturity of Christians sometimes amen we say this verse it's Jeremiah 20 29 11. we say it so so beautifully amen we say it for I know the thoughts I have for you I know the plans I have for you and this is the NIV here declares the Lord plans to prosper you not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future and we can all say Amen to that right I don't know if anyone any of you have continued reading that scripture amen have you continued reading that scripture it's it's not that good amen I feel like people just stop right at that scripture and they're saying all right Lord it's all up to you right it's all up to you I don't I don't want to give anything up Lord when I when I'm doing that in that process of Lord I know you have plans for me I know you have things to prosper me right but but I don't really want to give up anything amen I don't want to give I I can only give you so much amen but Lord still Prosper me right it's kind of got a misconception and what what we've learned you know through so many Instagram rails so many things that we see is this Prosperity Gospel we see this with this this constant move of of what they're saying is you know God's grace is sufficient no matter what amen God's grace will it you know it and it can sound so good amen it can sound so good but at the end of the day there's no repentance there's no coming down to yourself and saying Lord I am broken Lord I need you God I need you more than anything and that's the question tonight do you really need God amen I really need God I'm broken without him amen I need him every single day of my life praise God amen so have you read the rest of scripture Talks Of Babylon and God's judgment on them we have heard so this is what in Jeremiah we've heard the calling but it talks of Babylon but praise the Lord we've heard a voice calling us out of Babylon amen Babylon means confusion religious confusion so don't be deceived by some of the things you may come across amen prosperity and what what God I believe we have every promise in the book Is Ours amen everything you see in the scripture is ours Divine Healing everything is there amen we take God in his word no matter what but it's when we take God as word but we don't want to give everything else up amen see God's a gentleman he will he'll heal you and he'll give you the things you need when you need them but what he's looking for is is a soul amen he's looking for a heart surrendered to him completely amen praise the Lord you can have your healing you can have your fleshly healing in this body but what about the soul inside of you amen praise the Lord I'm looking for I'm looking for a restored Soul amen praise the Lord the problem is people don't want to get in God's program amen they've got their program and they want God to kind of slip in there and say they want they want God to say Lord you have plans to prosper me right so the problem is they don't they're too scared of what they'll have to give up they say Lord they say but they don't have repentance right so I'm getting there that's that's the spirit of this generation that's what I'm getting to they're neither hot nor cold right God's God spits that out right God spits that out and uh that's what it says in Revelation it's just it's it's it's a nasty thing when you're hot or cold he doesn't want that right he wants he wants Believers on fire for God Amen praise the Lord amen I was in Honduras when I was a kid it was just a story I thought of but I remember Honduras we were um we were traveling to a few churches with Dad and what they did was they got bottled water for us so we wouldn't get sick right and um they left the bottle of waters in the car in you know 90 degree weather right so we get back into the car and there's this lukewarm water there's this and all you wanted to do when you're drunk I mean you you drank it because it was it was water but man everything in you wanted to just get that out and have some nice cool drink of water hey man how many like you know what I need one right I need some water right now but anyways you you know what I mean by that amen it's just you know you've tasted that right so here's voice 58. this is a a little bit longer one so just bear with me here look at Isaiah the prophet as a young man he had made the great favored King Uzziah and them days a righteous man a good man he loved Isaiah for he knew he was a prophet and so he just leaned upon the King's Arms everything he wanted why Uzziah give it to him and every time he wanted anything why the king would give it to him but there come a time that the King died see listen to this Prosperity always ruins people that's a hard thing to say but Prosperity takes a man away from God spoke one place in the Bible something on this line and he said when I bless you and gave you much when you were poor and you didn't have nothing I come to you and you heard me and you served me but when I blessed you and gave you plenty then you turned your head from me that's the way America has done turned their heads and I want you to read the scripture I don't know if many of you have seen the scripture I just came across it today when he mentioned it Deuteronomy 8 10-20 if you would read it with me tonight if you would pull it up here when thou has eaten and art full then Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee beware that so listen to this beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God and not keepeth his Commandments and his judgments and his statutes which I commanded thee in this day lest when thou has eaten an art full and has built goodly houses and dwelt therein and when the herds and thy flocks multiply and thy silver and gold is Multiplied and all that thou Hast is Multiplied then thy heart be lifted up and thou forget the Lord thy God which thou brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt from the house of bondage who Led Led thee through great terrible Wilderness wherein we're fiery serpents and scorpions and drought where there was no water but brought thee forth water out of the rock of Flint who fled the in the wilderness with Manna so you see you see what he's he's warning the people about right you see what he's you see what he's warning the people and and saying you have all this don't forget the Lord your God Amen beware that you forget not the Lord thy God amen which thy fathers knew not and he might humble thee and that he might prove thee to do the good at the latter end and they say in their heart my power and my might in my in my of my hand had gotten me this well see how selfish it is but Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth amen that he may establish his Covenant which he swear unto his thy Fathers as it is this day and it shall be if thou do it all forget the Lord thy God and walk after their other other gods and serve them and worship them I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish as the Nations which the Lord destroyth before your face shall shall your perish because you would not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord your God Amen praise the Lord but forget that's what I'm trying to get beware that thou forget don't get puffed up when these things come because that's that's this generation right in need of nothing right let's not let's not fall into that as Believers amen let's continue on Amen continue on knowing that he gave you everything you have amen praise the Lord so what we ask the question what is true prosperity and I love this amen what is true prosperity based on the word of God because that's where we look amen oh we want to know clear we want we want to know what's true we look to the word of God Amen what's true prosperity first I just want to give you some Hebrew definitions Thrive Prosper flourish Bloom to get ahead succeed make good get through went out manage flower flourish Bloom Blossom amen what wonderful words there amen and then we have Joshua 1 8 we can look simply at Joshua 1 8 giving us the Joshua commission this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate there they therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do all according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success amen Christ this is what I wanted to get I love this part Christ suffered but he was in he was he prospered for us amen it may look like Christ was not prospering on that cross when he had his arms up there amen but he saw you amen he saw you he saw you amen but while he was on the cross I was on his mind amen maybe it didn't look like he was prospering but he saw his sons and daughters prospering right there amen prospering overcoming in this evil age this lady just lukewarm age and then he saw him while he's on there amen praise the Lord aren't you glad tonight amen I was on his mind Christ had had you and his thoughts the whole time amen what are you worried about amen praise God Amen when we look that even before the foundation of the world the land was slain amen he had to die for someone there amen he saw you amen he saw you there amen and he he saw you he wanted you to Blossom amen is it saying there he wanted you to bloom amen praise the Lord he was prospering his seed right there amen with that blood apply praise the Lord he saw the prospering of his sons and daughters by that fruit they bear amen praise God hallelujah by his stripes now we have those promises by his stripes I am healed amen we prosper for they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony it is finished yes Lord it's complete it's done amen he prospered for us amen he took it all for us praise God and when that Bloody lamb took that book of redemption and there in Revelations Hallelujah he took the beating so his seed could Prosper amen he took the beating for us amen for each and every one of you Solomon Hannah he took it for you amen don't let the devil lie to you amen he took it for you by his stripes amen praise the Lord amen don't let the devil deceive you amen this this message this word it is for you amen I want to get that across with you with all of my heart tonight amen but it's through him we find our prosperity amen praise the Lord praise God I want to remind you of this in the expedition of the seven Church ages amen the revelation of Jesus Christ now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is amen it's the identity Joseph knew his identity amen amen everything prospered around him amen what she stands for and what she can do do the Greater Works amen she will be an invincible Harmony do you believe it if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and By and By God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit praise the Lord amen by his grace we will amen Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely for today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over over him in the desert as as different yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it amen but true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them praise the Lord Jesus said don't Rejoice Luke 10 17-20 what a beautiful scripture amen so I wanted to get to what is what is the true Prosperity amen and the 70 return again and with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said see they're getting excited and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you notwithstanding listen to this what Jesus says and this Rejoice not this is not what we're supposed to Rejoice about right that the spirits are subject unto you it's not the focus it's not the focus but rather Rejoice because your names are written in heaven what is it about the identity you have with him amen praise the Lord amen that's where we draw our strength that's where we draw our prosperity praise the Lord amen praise God that stuff gets me excited when I know the blood of Jesus Amen is sufficient for me amen I can rejoice and say Allelujah tonight amen he paid the price for me amen hallelujah praise God and then we got here we go the inner Veil you know I'm a at least you know right now I'm a short-winded preacher so forgive me for that but it's a Wednesday night so you guys understand so just listen to this here the Intervale 56. and now I find that people so struggle seem like I meet people and they say it's just such a struggle have you seen people that way and probably probably there's many sitting right here before me now that just heads their ups and downs and ins and outs this day they're all right you meet them and well they love the Lord today and tomorrow they're having such a struggle to hold on the devil so tempting them and they're having such ups and downs then you meet somebody that's on the hilltop all the time whether there's nothing bothers them at all amen now there's bound to be something lacking somewhere God's no respecter of persons or God doesn't respect persons he wants all his children to have the same amen he wouldn't righteous father wouldn't give one dish of ice cream I love how he says this it wouldn't have he wouldn't give one dish of ice cream without giving all ice cream amen I mean how would you feel if you know all your siblings got ice cream and you know you didn't get ice cream I would feel pretty bad amen amen so continuing on um certainly he wants you to live and I'm not take talking about gifts I'm talking about Grace amen now of course some are called apostles and Prophets and teachers and evangelists and churches Church offices and so forth that's God's place in the churches in these things so don't let that be the focus amen and but I'm talking about measure measures of Grace overcoming Grace to each one that he elects you to your office but then but in Grace God has given us all freely as we have need aren't you glad tonight everything that we have need of and the trouble listen to this michiganders I notice up in Michigan you people up here can brag a lot because you have a lot of fruit we get grapes from Michigan I don't know if I've ever bragged about this but I guess it's a thing laughs we get Grace we get cherries from Michigan the big beings and all kinds beautiful I think there's lots of places now I will brag about Lake Michigan Lake Michigan is incredible have you ever been to Lake Michigan just gorgeous please go I encourage you so um but back to the cherries all right big Banks big beings and all beautiful I think there's not a lot of places in the world grows them any better than Michigan and now you ought to understand what your fruit trees are did you ever know that that little cherry tree or little apple tree well you set it out when it's no bigger than about half inch tall that every bushel of apples that you ever that you'll ever collect off that tree is in it right there amen if it isn't where does it come from who hangs on who hangs on there it's already in it amen the only thing that little tree does you just set it out and water it and it has to drink and drink until it gets so much it just goes to pushing out praise the Lord drinks more than its lotted portion and it dwells out and it pushes out limbs it pushes out buds then it pushes out leaves then the blossom then the apples how about them apples then it pushes again and it pushes again it keeps drinking and drinking until it just pushes out and that's what the Christian does amen when you're planted in Jesus Christ Alleluia everything that you have need of in this earth journey is in you when you receive the Holy Spirit Hallelujah everything that you have amen it is a measure amen we don't have what what all we need until we hit that Millennium right until we we get our new bodies but it's the measure and to have has everything in it that you need amen praise the Lord amen receive it if you don't have it and then get it with all thy getting amen praise the Lord he does he doesn't want to keep these things from you amen he doesn't want to keep the Holy Spirit from you at all the Lord you know he he's a gracious God and he's rich in Mercy he wants he wants to give you that amen praise the Lord well what does it take it takes a full surrender amen it takes a full surrender of heart amen praise the Lord and that's what a Christian does they're planted in Jesus Christ everything they have need of in the earth's journey is in you and receive the Holy Spirit and the only thing you have to do is drink drink and push out and push out drink just drink till you can't drink no more if you have need of Divine Healing go to God's word and drink from it until you push out if you need more of God just keep drinking push out and Christ is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life amen do you believe that tonight he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life amen everything we have need of he supplies he's our provider every single time Alleluia praise the Lord even in this journey you know of uh engagement and things happening in life you know sometimes there's just a lot happening at once that you get a bit overwhelmed amen but the Lord's my provider every single time amen he's been there every single time throughout College throughout all of that amen I can testify amen he's been there amen he's he's kept me amen praise the Lord everything we have need of Amen what are we worried about amen praise God praise God this is a I mean even even at the house right now I was telling Brandon in the back I'm on flower Duty I don't know if you know what flower duty is but I have to water the flowers while mom and dad are away right so it's pretty you know at first I was kind of reluctant about it you know who wants to get up in the morning and go to all the flowers and you know go to it but um but you know like today and yesterday I've been seeing the change I've been seeing the change and like what's happening to the flowers and it's pretty exciting I go there I go out there like today I went out there probably three or four times to look at the flowers to see if they're coming up more you know I mean could you imagine how you know God looks at you could you imagine you know he's watering you and you just keep drinking and drinking amen he's just so excited amen about what what he's given you amen amen he wants to give you Revelation more than anything he wants to strengthen you more than anything draw from the inexhaustible Fountain amen praise the Lord amen so that's been pretty exciting for me amen so I I didn't know I was you know I like flowers but I didn't want it to like water them every day even the other morning I was I need to get off this flower thing but even the other morning before work the sprinklers they come on right so then I've got the hose trying to water these flowers I'm watering these flowers and there's nothing coming out of the hose because the sprinklers are taking it all out right but the thing is that doesn't happen with God right it doesn't happen with God he just keeps giving amen praise God hallelujah amen and if you're planted in him the only thing you have to do is drink of his goodness and push out whatever you have need of in this Earth's Journey it's all drinking resting peace Hallelujah and it's not what you struggle and strive and pull at you defeat the very purpose that you're representing when you do that so don't do that amen just drink from the inexhaustible Fountain amen keep drinking keep drinking amen praise the Lord you just keep growing and growing amen you might you might have other flowers you know around you that you may say you know I want to be that flower no God made you that flower for a purpose amen he made you that flower amen and he wants you to bloom he's got a plan for you he's got he's he wants to prop Prosper you amen praise the Lord amen so as Believers we look and see that true Prosperity is nothing that this world can offer but a hidden life with Christ amen how many can testify of that amen so close so closed off to the things of this world that no matter what comes I can say blessed be the name of the Lord as job said Lord you give and take away but Blessed Be Your Name I've got joy because I've got Jesus amen praise the Lord I was thinking of that song I also wanted to think of I just just before I end here I wanted to to mention uh sister Hattie Wright you guys remember the story of of uh sister Hattie Wright and what what the Lord granted to her amen and um whatever you may ask I mean what what what a honor I mean to have that asked to you amen and um you you see you see what she understood about you know she might have not thought about what Prosperity is but Prosperity is in the Eternal amen Prosperity is looking what what is eternal my vision is for Eternal lost souls right so she looks and says the salvation of my two sons amen she's looking for you know she understands what what Prosperity really is amen it's not the million dollars because she could have had it amen it's not it's not even She had she had a sister who couldn't even walk amen not even that but the salvation of her two sons amen amen that's the heart I want to have amen towards the Eternal amen that's true Prosperity is when we're living for Christ amen amen and giving him all we got wherever we are amen wherever we are in our workplaces wherever we wherever we're in school or anything lord lord I want you in me so that that we I can prosper Lord in you Lord Jesus that's what I want more than
