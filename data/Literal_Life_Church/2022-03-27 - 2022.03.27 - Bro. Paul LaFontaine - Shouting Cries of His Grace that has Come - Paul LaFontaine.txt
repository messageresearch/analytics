========================================

each one who has come and those families who are listening online god bless you god's richest blessings to all of you praise the lord zechariah chapter 4 and verse 1 we'll read 1 through 10. and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that waketh out of his sleep and said unto me what see us thou and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold and with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof so in the vision this is the symbolism we know as seven church ages the lamp stand that was also seen in the book of revelations is the vision that the prophets had speaking of the 2000 years of church ages with seven messengers and seven church ages times verse 3 says in two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side this is referred to as the old and the new testament but notice there are two olive trees olive trees is where we get the oil oil has to flow through the lamp stand and so it comes from there it comes from a source and so you see the symbolism showing us that the holy spirit is the one throughout the church ages the oil is the thing that was needed and actually only by the spirit has god been able to deal with his people that's how he deals with his people is through the holy spirit so i answered and speak to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and i said no my lord then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of host now we've heard that that scripture many times but i want you to notice now if it's already gave the church ages then now we come to the end of the church ages in time and we come to zerubbabel who rebuilt the temple and we come to this statement not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord and at the end it will be a time that god removes all the other possibilities of things being able to save us things being able to deliver us at the end time which i'll if i god will help me i'll describe what kind of time we're living in it's it's more complex and more trouble than any other people has ever lived in but in that trouble god makes it so that there's nothing by your human efforts there's nothing of your might there's nothing of your power man's power political power he makes it so there is nothing as far as our answer and our escape except for the spirit of god and he makes it us dependent on that which i don't mind being dependent can you say man you won't get out of this by your might by your power by any man's might he's set it up so all those things are dismantled to where we have to depend on his holy spirit who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall build bring forth the headstone whereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it with shoutings crying grace what is this headstone what is this thing coming what is this stone that actually represents revelation what is this revelation coming to us we can call it a lot of things but when they cried out they cried out this is grace coming to us this is grace coming to us with shoutings crying grace grace unto it moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying the hands of the rubble will have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and doesn't that relate to what brother jason and them were preaching and brother diggs as well talking about he who has begun a good work will be faithful to complete it if he began the work then we don't end it with our works if he began you with grace he'll end you with grace if he began the work he'll finish the work the hands of the rubble that had laid the foundation this south his hand shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts has sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things who hath despised he must be saying that because people despise small things that god can work through and glorify the big things that god can do but who dares to despise the day when god in his simplicity to can manifest his power to the people and deliver them father bless your word you know what's in my heart i pray you help me to deliver it to the people i really pray that lord and i ask for your help in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated this morning i want you to hold your finger there in zechariah and i'll just grab back in daniel another prophet who had a similar vision if not the same vision and i'll turn you to daniel chapter 2 as the vision speaks of this image that is throughout history of the world empires and the spirits behind those things the great image that daniel said so hold your finger in zechariah we'll go back there but daniel the prophet sees us very similar if not the same vision and it it it works its way through time from the babylonian empire all the way to the roman empire verse 31 of chapter 2 thou king saw us and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was of fine gold his breast of his arms of silver his belly his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet are part of the iron and part of the clay so throughout history now these world empires and these spirits and it's called an image so this is an image of something else this isn't the image of god this is an image of other powers and influences that is in the people's lives throughout history keeps coming down you know god's pyramid works from the bottom up but satan's kingdom is describes it from the top to the feet and so now it works its way it all comes down to the legs which is the the kingdom of rome and then it says look what it says here now similar vision verse 34 thou sawest till that till a stone now in in zachariah there was a headstone there was a stone thou saw us till that stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and of clay and break them into pieces so now these powerful powerful influences and spirits are overwhelming to the individual overwhelming to the people of god except for one thing that he sends his stone which means revelation so you'd be in trouble with this image except for the stone comes and crushes this image and it's the grace of god that sends the headstone and so there was iron in the clay so this stone broke into pieces verse 35 let me finish here then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broke into pieces together and became like the shaft of the summer of thrusting floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth that's prophecy speaking and it's taken us right up to the end time the same vision that zechariah sees and that is that this stone and i want to just elaborate on this this image because this is an overwhelming uh spirit and as this image comes down to the end time to the feet of iron and clay as it comes down you have to realize that all the spirits and all the influences and all the cruelty and all the the defiance against the true god everything that's in that all is culminated in the feet in the end time which is when you live you live in the end time so all of this power comes now on the feet and becomes a pressure on the people of god it becomes an image that is is more powerful than them they can't handle it themselves and it all culminates in the end time and comes to the final and if you read the book of daniel you'll see when it comes into the roman empire it switches because it says that part of the beast is a diverse and he switches to a religious front in other words it's all the power of rome the caesars but it switches to a religious satan says i can't get worship this way from the people so i'm going to switch into a form of christianity i'll take the power of the beast can you say man i'll take the power of rome but it's going to be at the front of christianity and it will become more diverse which means when it becomes more diverse it becomes more pressure it becomes more confusing to sincere hearts because because they're going what in the world is this what is this well daniel and the prophets describe what it is and so if you wouldn't mind then and boy you could spend a lot more time on this but if you would in daniel now chapter 12 at the last chapter this is what he sees at the end time daniel chapter 12 and at that time shall michael i'm just laying a foundation here i'll preach in a minute and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the people the children of thy people daniel and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to the same time and at that time so just stop right there this will be a time of trouble this is the hour that we live in it's the hour that the jews will live in in tribulation it will be a time of trouble such as no man since there never was to any nation at any time before this a time of trouble there should be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to the same time it's a good thing the scripture don't end there for it says and at that time thy people daniel shall be delivered i'm glad that scripture's there at that time your people will be delivered daniel i know that it's a i know that it's a big mountain i know that it's the time of trouble i know it's overwhelming for you and i know your people will live in a time that's more trouble more confusing more diverse more spirits dealing with it i know they'll live in that but i want to i want to tell you there'll be a word of grace come and your people will be delivered and look how they'll be delivered every one of them those that will be found written in the book and that's what we heard last weekend the gene seed of god can you say man you know why god will deliver his people because he predestinated you to overcome in this age there's something in you that's going to overcome the beast of this age there's something in you that's going to overcome all the spirits of this age why because you have power to do it i guarantee you you don't but if your name is written in the lamb's book of life he's going to pick those names up and say i'm going to deliver my people out of it you ought to be shouting right now you ought to be saying lord i thank you that my eyes have been opened i thank you that i heard preaching last weekend like i heard that this isn't this isn't i it's not me that's predestinated it's the gene seed of god that's predestinated i'm not looking at myself i'm looking at that i'm a son and daughter of god and if i'm written in that book i'm going to overcome this thing so i just wanted you to catch that as a foundation it's in the worst time of trouble that's ever been that they will be delivered because their name is book written in the book already the final overwhelming obstacle of an image or a mountain in zechariah 4 a mountain that is before them who art thou this great mountain and and he said you shall be brought as a plane in other words god's not intimidated by a mountain of people were caught in the valley and they're looking at this huge image they're looking at this huge mountain and there's no way that we can move that there's no way that we can do anything with that it's it's over it's an overwhelming obstacle of an image or a mountain that's unbeatable through the power and might of man or your own power but he says by the spirit he provides a stone a stone is a revelation can you say man it's a headstone and brother brown makes this point in in the in the message message of grace he makes this point he said i want you to notice it's not the cornerstone it's the headstone so most of christianity knows who the cornerstone is it's the revelation of christ but you see it's not just the revelation of christ the cornerstone now it's a revelation coming as him as the headstone we're living in the end time we don't we don't need another revelation of the cornerstone christ and that revelation we need something greater and that's a revelation of the headstone so whatever this revelation when it comes it'll strike that image and it'll help you to overcome amen most of you that are in the word and been in the word for years understand these things but i'm laying a foundation and i'm always sensitive to the fact that our young people and everyone needs to see in the bible see where we're at now and understand these are not just stories or symbolisms by a prophet we're living in these times that the headstone the revelation the the whatever you want to call it but a stone is a revelation how many know stone means a revelation thou art peter and upon this rock i'll build my church it wasn't peter but peter means little stone so stone means revelation upon this rock i'll build my church stone is a revelation and whatever this stone is this stone this revelation at the end time is powerful enough powerful enough to crush that image and deliver the people of god amen so this overwhelming it's not just a a cornerstone revelation but a headstone revelation not just a cornerstone revelation of christ but a headstone revelation to destroy the impossible final mountain that is in front of god's people now when we really see so now i'll get into my message this morning when we really see what it is that god has sent us in the end time we will call it what it is when we see it right we'll call it what it is i want you to notice now the stone comes the headstone comes god has just said in this hour not by might not by power but my my spirit saith the lord when this stone comes it comes to crush to make a plane that mountain to however you want to look at to crush the image but when this stone comes the response back brother braham says from the prince or zerubbabel or the people but the response back from the people is a shouting shouting what is this that's come to us what has come to us at the end time that would be so powerful revelation that it would crush the influence of this image that would crush the the power of it can you say man in my own life it wouldn't have influence in my life but god would influence my life what is coming that is so powerful and we can name it all they want but these people named it one thing with crying shouting god has sent us grace in the end time i'll name it grace can you say amen grace what's come to us grace the favor of god the unmerited favor of god we needed grace when he saved us can you say man when you're saved 20 years ago you were saved it was grace that saved you it wasn't your works it's not you burning a candle it's not speaking in tongues it was grace you had nothing to do with it god doesn't begin his grace at the beginning and at the end time now it's going to be our works it was grace in the beginning and he'll send grace at the end if we make a rapture it'll be because of his grace what is this mouth what is this headstone what is this revelation now i tell you we can call it and for years we've called it so many things it's the message it's the message of william branham it's the message of the last days and all those terms are fine except for the fact sometimes i don't like what satan has put as a bad name on the term the message because people that's supposed to be a pure term the message of the last days but it has a lot of connotations today come on now and it's lost its meaning to a lot of people because they look at the internet too much and they put a cloud over this term the message we use it message churches and the message and the message and this are they in the message out of the other message and so we've earned this term and so we've got all these terms the message of william branham the prophet and we preached that clearly in this church that we that's what we stand for because it's what god sent in the last days but i just wanted to say to you this morning i don't know exactly how to say it i just want to stay we can put whatever term we want to what god has sent in the last days we can allow you see that because we have our terms that we name it but the devil has his terms that he names it now too one of the main ones it's a cult it's full of legalistic people that's a lie of the enemy that's the wrong name to this thing can you imagine taking what god said is profit in the last days can you imagine the audacity for somebody to be online and even hint that this is of man or even hint that this is a cult it's kind of quiet the arrogance of the devil through some of these people to just name it what they want to name it i'll tell you on judgment day they're going to find out a different story and whatever term satan has given this thing and whatever term we give it i'm telling you when they seen it come this headstone they didn't label it the message they didn't label it brother branham's message they didn't refer to a prophet they didn't refer they said what's coming grace grace has come to me it's a message of grace how can we turn it into anything less than what god and say listen without it we're we wouldn't have an escape out of this world you say oh yeah we would i've got my bible you do how well are people doing this with their bibles and i'm not knocking that i'm saying the message came to restore us back and take the veils off the bible and with veils on it by denominational creeds it becomes a net effect to the people your bible is not effective if you've got veils over it so we needed something to come and give us eyesight we needed isab we needed something to come but at the end of the day the conclusion we make and there's arguments and we go back and forth are they in the message are they admitted and i'm just i'm i'm already in trouble so just keep saying it i don't like the term message being placed in such a thing that it's just another movement that's in the earth i don't see it as that oh you've got the seven day adventists and you got them and it's all really the same thing you're just another movement in it i i detest that you cannot there's no comparison with what god has sent to us so i'd like to get back to a biblical term what god sent is grace hallelujah it's grace brother several it's grace let's simplify this thing now there might be people here are listening you're so clouded now you don't see it as god's grace because either you don't know what grace is i mean i could take the simple way that when people are getting ready for judgment in noah's day in sodom and gomorrah's day when they were getting ready for judgment god sent a prophet and the prophet's word was the grace to get out of their judgment but now he's all changed it now no it's all different and that's not different and he gives a bad name of the prophet he gives a man bad name to the message he likes to link everything in what church are a you know well we're we're non-daenam and non-denom yeah but what do you really believe in that so you try to get into it and say but you just you don't want the labels because people categorize you into certain things it makes them feel better and i could say well we're part of the message of the last days and we've got a bunch of churches around the world and i could go into all that and all that's true but i don't like to be put in a category making this just another pebble on the beach is everybody okay with this because i know this isn't another pebble on the beach and people will say that have not got under themselves they're listening to somebody on the internet they're taking somebody else's conclusion if give me six months give me six months and don't feed on that feed on the message itself and if god doesn't open your eyes that this is a completely different thing you haven't even hardly read it yourself and after whatever you know 30 years of reading it myself i was convinced early on by the holy ghost man this is not about william branham this is not about william branham i have the greatest respect for what god used him for to bring this thing but it's not about william branham this is god's grace to the people of the last days this is god's grace [Applause] hallelujah excuse me for getting excited excuse me for getting excited i don't call it what it is satan's called it all kinds of things you're confused sometimes in your mind some people but listen i want to make it crystal clear it's god's grace to his people and you want to live a a double life and you want to be worldly and still be have your foot in the message and you want to get online and you want to describe the grace of god people are judgmental and so they don't know you're not qualified to talk about the grace of god when you're living like the world you're not qualified you don't know what the grace of god is because you can say all the things that's talked about in the message that just was judgmental that's not the grace of god you don't know what grace is we've got some lovely sisters here who feel the same way that i do they only seen it as god's grace you honestly think they would be sitting here wearing what they're wearing following filled with the holy spirit and following this because of me i guarantee you they wouldn't follow it because of me because of some worldly dress code you know what they see it as it's the grace of god i'm thankful for his grace i didn't i'd unmerited favor i didn't the favor of god came and told me how to be a woman not me you girls read in between the lines here so there the grace of god come and told me you sisters it's a revelation how to be a woman and was that needed for god to come and speak what a woman really is i'd say so because we have a supreme court justice candidate that can't answer the question about what a woman is that's right won't answer it can't answer it that's how messed up people's minds are i know she's doing it political because she can't say that but i really believe there's people there's young a generation that can't define i said honey can you imagine can you imagine can't even give the definition of a woman anymore i'd say the grace of god sent us a message to give a clear definition of of the glories of what a woman is and the glories of what a man is to rory restore us back and i got some sisters thanks be to god here sitting and listening it's not legalism it's not a pastor harping on them they said the grace of god has come to us in the last days and i'm totally comfortable with living it somebody say praise the lord [Applause] this isn't legalism this is the grace of god you have to forgive me this morning for taking my time i'm going to let it out praise the lord because i've been laboring and wrestling with the angel since friday night till two in the morning last night all day yesterday just laboring because i just say lord i want to bring this so that people can see it when we really see what god has sent us clearly with eyesight we call it what it is and they're calling it grace grace shoutings of grace they're pretty excited about it now that's a reference back to when they laid the cornerstone for the rebuilding of the temple and the bible says back there in ezra that when they laid that cornerstone there was some shouting and worship going on just when they laid the cornerstone of it they were shouting they just they just took they're just starting they're just starting and they lay that cornerstone in to begin the temple and the place was so loud they couldn't even hear the shouting the worship the glories read your bible there's no temple yet but just the beginning of it we're headed in that direction now we talk about the last days at the headstone when he's restored all of the word of god when he's opened up the seven seals when he's given his word to the people when he comes as a bloody lamb with the book in his hand and says your name is in here read it and there's not going to be worship going on you're going to sit there and go oh isn't that really good and some intellectual stimulation no there was shoutings grace has come to us [Applause] grace has come to us praise the lord somebody say praise the lord so the response from this little group in the last days the worship the shouts what is this it's the grace of the lord that has come now i want to come into uh something brother jason referred to like i told you i got about 100 sermons out of what those guys preached god puts this second eve in the end time and he places her in the most deceptive time and he gives satan full sway and actually allows him prophet said i'm going to give him 6 000 years and i'm going to let him bring his own eden on earth satan's eden now he wouldn't be doing this god allowed it god says all right you know i i've already began the process of redemption for my people even after the garden and i'll talk about a little later god's already after their fall and the condition they couldn't get themselves they're hiding in the bushes and right away god's running towards them saying where are you i want fellowship where are you at what is that the grace of god they're hiding and adam and eve probably would have still been hiding in the bushes except god came to them and said where are you come out of those bushes stop hiding in your guilt throw some skins to him says listen i want to find a place i haven't went to calvary yet but i'm going to find a place so we can get back to some fellowship here and it'll be through blood amen so that's what happened at the beginning but then we see we begin to look at the end time and see what's taking place now the process and we see that the second eve was put in the worst listen and oh just feeble words to explain what we're living in but i remember him saying look at brother jason saying listen he called it a double whammy i'm going to call it like a a 20 20 whammy because the conditions that god said i would allow my people to live in is extreme condition i don't even know a word to describe it and he allows satan to bring this eden and he says i'm going to have a people a second eat this is how he words it in satan eden he said he is allowed and he said this age is what it is today to prove to satan that this eve is not like the first eve she's not going to fall but it's not like back then when the whole garden was innocent and there was there was only the serpent there but everything was a need and that's that's not that difficult and she still fell now satan i'm gonna allow you to bring a world i don't like to use the word create because he's just a perverter but have your sway and have your way that by the year 2022 it will be so deceptive satan is given full sway the full impact of the culmination of the antichrist spirit will be in this hour christianity will be perverted that people don't even know what true christianity is anymore governments will be controlled by the devil politics will be controlled by the devil artificial intelligence ai will control minds how many know that's going on how many know that when you say something and you get an advertisement on your phone 10 minutes later trying to pick up on what you like trying to pick on so we have no privacy now they're they're going to advertise you see so now this is the invasion of the minds to control the minds and sway them any way they want to sway them you see so you got a.i you got controlling minds and it's actually dictating like men are robots dictating almost every action we take as humans hollywood does that because you had a young girl or a young guy don't know who they are yet they're not going to look to the bible they're not going to look to the holy ghost so they take their cues from hollywood who's going to dictate this is what it means to be a man this is what it means to be a woman this is what it means to be cool this is what you have to wear this tattoo this ear rings it's going to dictate to people it's going to control their minds that's the age we live in christianity perverted they don't even know what christianity is in it dictating almost extra every action hollywood's filth perverting everything that's right and holy i should be getting more amens to this because it's the truth hollywood's filth is is is perverting everything that's right and holy they've been doing it for a hundred years porn porn filling minds of men and women pornography filling minds available at every turn and brother jason said he gives to the double whammy we're living in the days of sodom and gomorrah and the days of noah both at the same time so now you read your bible all the characteristics of the days of noah before destruction and all the characteristic days of sodom and gomorrha gomorrah before destruction all of that will get poured into this age and people still wonder wow i can't believe all this is happening i can't believe this is we have a transgender person that's a top authority in the in the military we got this and we got that mater the woman the woman or man whatever she is of the year i guess they say they got to say man slash woman of the year sodom and gomorrah the days of noah and then i could go on on perverted christianity people don't know what the things 33 000 denominations within christianity never mind islam no never mind 33 000 pushing 40 000 excuse me denominations that all say they have the right way within christianity and we talk about all that and the influences of it and then you got the whole thing of hundred thousand thousand devils coming out of the river of euphrates in the book of revelation demons of persecution poured out upon the bride they were poured out upon israel during the nazism naturally turned up pulled out upon the people hitler the cruelty against the people of israel and those same devils in a spiritual realm now coming against the bride persecuting you so you may have somebody face to face that's laughing at you and persecute for what you stand for what you wear whatever you may have that but you don't see the two hundred thousand thousand demons in the other realm that's against you you only see this guy at work who's putting you down and laughing at you because you're reading your bible at lunch but you don't see two hundred thousand thousand religious devils from the demon of euphrates released on the bride in the last days you don't even see that and then depression spirits of depression and spirits of anxiety and spirits of fear i'm not belittling anybody what i'm trying to say today is that some of this the devil's trying to make us feel guilty of some of us the devil's trying to the devil's trying to uh put it on us and we feel guilt and we feel this and and thankfully we have an atonement brother kyle we have he says if you if you make a mistake if you sin go to him and repent he's faithful and just to forgive you that's all we got the grace of god that scripture says if i make a mistake i go to him but i'm not going to carry the guilt of the age that god called me to live in and start putting all this on me and all this stuff that is something that i did that i have to live with the rest of my life we're dealing and battling our young people are dealing with spirits that they never have before families are breaking up not simply because there's not sincere hearts sometimes but sometimes the devil has attacked that family in particular spirits depression anxiety mixed up christianity an image of the beast forming amen what a time government's controlled by the devil the days of sodom and gomorrah most of us parents would probably say if i had my choice i would have rather raised my kid in another time than sodom and gomorrah amen if you're a real parent say lord i wish it but guess what he's given us the token amen you say well i got an unsaved kid right now brother brown says you can pray and apply the token to that kid we got something friends his grace came to us in the last time just before judgment his grace you can call it the message in god but no but it's the holy ghost it's the it's it's the grace of god it said while you're there in satan's eden i will be with you even in you until the end of the age i will not leave thee i will not forsake your family i haven't ever forsaken your family it's just the times you live in but i'm never going to leave you i'm never going to forsake you i'm there until the end and when it's wrapped up my grace will rapture you out of the whole thing that's the word that's his promise i stand by it and i'm going to keep preaching it can you say amen grace grace marvelous grace has come to us we you know parents we're trying to figure out and navigate how to protect our kids from this and do this and we should do that and we're trying to work this out what do i do do i switch do i home school do i switch schools because some of the schools some of the christian schools perversion's coming in and it's like we're trying to made all these and that's fine do what you can but at the end of the day he's given us something in this hour he's given us the token he's given us a protection for our kids and i pray over my children you ought to pray every day whether they're sitting here or whether they're backslid you pray every day you bring a sock that sacrifice for them i apply the token for my children lord don't let him be caught in this tribulation don't let him be caught in this i'm gonna stand because i've got something here come boldly before the throne you know what's called the throne of what the throne of grace that means i already have favor it's not a throne of judgment to you that we're scared i don't know if i can go to god i don't know if i can pray today because i made them this mistake i want to pray for my children but i don't know if i can no it's the throne of grace [Applause] it's the throne of grace come boldly before his throne there was a man subject to like passions elijah as us had the same passions and yet god heard his prayer brother jason said jonah was down in that well and he says i'm in hell but i'm gonna lift my voice and cry to my god and his voice was heard in heaven [Applause] don't stop praying don't stop applying the token don't stop directing your children don't be silent and show them the word of god in an hour when they're getting all kinds of voices read the word to them teach them the message of the hour this isn't some man's teaching that you're teaching your kids to make legalists this is the grace of god that's been sent to them read it let it be in your homes god help me this morning the devil has made you call this legalism no it's the greatest thing that god has ever said to us and my dad he said if i found out that it was false at the end i'd still raise my children under this message because it's the best way to live in this world label it whatever you want to label it they called it grace all right let's so when i was having breakfast brother jason i don't want to plagiarize what he told me so i'll give the credit to him i got excited at breakfast on monday because he elaborated on this the whole deal he says in judgment day he's got the bride standing behind him because the bride will stand with him in judgment she's already been judged by the word we're being judged right now if you'll receive it through my preaching you'll take your judgment now you'll pass from death in your life right now or you can go to the judgment day i'd rather be here i'd rather god rebuke me take the height on my back judge my life convict me right now you go ahead and wait till judgment day you tamper and play with it oh this and you got one foot in the message in one fight you go ahead and do that i want to take my judgment right now i believe it right now but the bride will stand with him in judgment she won't be judged she'll stand with him and i wonder he says if god will look look at this little puny creature satan he says buddy i let you do everything i let you bring this world in six thousand years i gave you full sway to make it a satan's eden your playground a sodom and gomorrah a noah's day where the the where if you don't need your bible the sons of god saw the dollars of men that they were beautiful and they fell by the beauty of women and the women were dressing that way so the men fell so on that day first first you know let's just take a look at him for a minute i'm taking my time on this point he's in the judgment day and satan and god says listen i gave you everything and first of all we look at him over in the corner and it's like wow look at this guy isaiah 14 it says this is how it's worn in isaiah 14 lucifer and after it's all over we start looking and it says is this the man is this the dude that made earth to tremble and shook nations once we get to see this puny little creature the bible says they'll look at him and say is that the guy i fought all those years that's the puny little nothing that was whispering and accusing me all the time that's the guy that has supposed to have all this power and sway over me and tempting me and doing all this stuff and i listen to his voices and i got condemned and and you go on and on this is the dude the beauty little creature this is i that shook the nations and this is him and maybe the bride's looking and saying i gave him way too much time in my life i didn't grab ahold of the word quite enough for this devil because now that i see him i know god is more powerful than him come on can i get an amen now that i see this little squirt sitting in the corner is that the one that caused all my depression is that the one that brought me down is that one that brought condemnation constantly to me because of my mistakes is this the guy after all these i shouldn't have gave him that much time and so god goes on and says i gave you i gave you sodom gore i gave you i let all these things and then i put my last day's bride right in the middle of it and i just want to let you know satan as bad as you can make it she still didn't fall she made mistakes she got depressed she come under depressing spirits she went through things in her life she went through ups and downs she couldn't understand some things in the word it was all that's there might as well be truthful about it but in the end she can't fall because she's in the lamb's book of life what an insult to satan what a slap in the face but i did everything i could i know you did everything you could but she's up here and you're down here and i'm getting ready to cast you out [Applause] i wonder after he tells satan all that i wonder if he looks back at his bride standing with him and looks back to this him says do you realize do you realize what saying you what say you the bride of jesus christ and i wonder if they shout shout not it wasn't me no no they shout they cry grace grace no no no no i didn't do anything lord all the worthiness goes on you grace shoutings of grace grace grace if they're gonna if we're gonna shout that then we might as well shout it now we might as well say this listen this isn't works this isn't what i can do can you say amen if i make it into because he provided a way for you to make it in [Applause] grace grace say jesus says i let you with your own eden i let you go to sodom the climax of it the prophet spoke these words in 1963 we see this age that we're living in it's one of the grandest ages of all ages the laodicean churches is the grandest of all church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity so now let's notice now he says it's it's the grandest ages to live in did you know that you live in the grandest ages prophets would have loved to live in your age because it's the ending of time in the blending of eternity it's not necessarily a one day event okay now it's over bang no no it's the blending of eternity how is that happening by the preaching you heard last weekend because his people have to get an eternal view so he blends eternity and human souls that are time uh what do they call that a time we're creatures of time some of you have already looked at your watches and your phones and checking out your schedule for the week shame on you shame on you i don't mean to shame you but i say shame on you you got your schedule in mind you get this and you got a certain slot here at church and you know this shame on you what if god wants to stay all evening this evening what if god wants to save your children you're a creature of time and he's trying to preach you that there's something greater than time he interrupts our time eternal eternal i wonder if satan i wonder if god looks and says listen and and here's the grandest of all ages i don't know if you guys have that quote here's the grandest of all church ages because it's the ending of time the blending of eternity and then listen now because they don't have it up you'll listen closer it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than it's ever been and the powers of satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any age here back in the early ages a christian could for his profession of being a church or belonging to christ he could be headed for it he could be killed and put out of his misery and go to meet god quickly some of them say well that'd be an easier way to go wouldn't it get it done get it over with but now the enemy has come in the name of the church and it's so deceiving this is the great age of deception when christ said the two spirits would be so close it would be deceived the very left if possible and see remember christ spoke of an elected people for the last day see it would deceive the very elect if it were apostles so close so close to people so live people can live in a holy people can live a clean holy not a sinful and not be sinful adulterers and drinkers and liars and gamblers they can live above all that and still not with still not with it satan i let you have full access and they didn't fall they're standing here with me in judgment redeemed are you she sherry wrote a song are you she are you she the bride of this last days brandon or paul or somebody if you guys don't get me a charger the sermon is going to cut really quick here are you see the bride of the last days who stood the worst of times when so many slipped away here's your crown take your place beside the throne i am now your very own is this the special chosen one we see are you she the other ages want to shake your hand what age you from i'm from ephesus i i was beheaded in in smyrna i said i was i was tortured i took stripes on my back you're shaking hands with these people that you're your brothers and sisters and you're you're amazed at them and they shake their hand with a brother tony what age did you come from sir you and you're here yes i buy god's grace you survived oh my you're one of them yes sir how did you do it grace greece hallelujah hallelujah you made it [Applause] grace the worst of times the worst of spirits the worst of sodom and gomorrah the worst of pornography grace grace provided away of temptation thank the lord you should be grateful for brandon this becomes a final victory shout of the bride grace shoutings of grace as it causes us to move our final mountain the mountain should become like a plane because of the stone it'll be by his grace we'll take a rapture another thing you know i just want to i won't have much time going this till next sunday but when when you see it as grace grace grace is not just some term but when you see this as grace and it's the grace of an unmerited favor and you have the favor of god and you didn't deserve it you have the favor of god to escape in a rapture and you don't really deserve it but grace is something friends that is that we did nothing for it and so it wasn't by our power or our might and if we really really have a true revelation of this is all his grace then it gives us grace for other people to me it goes together that the humility that says i didn't do nothing to earn this i didn't do nothing to get to this spot where i'm at today i didn't do nothing to make it in a rapture i didn't do nothing to have my name on the book i didn't do anything and when you have that type of humility i'm not boasting of anything except the cross of jesus christ when you have that then another sign that you have it is their grace for others it spills over jesus said even forgiveness he says if you can't forgive someone else then i can't release my forgiveness to you but when forgiveness is released and you really see how much you've been forgiven it's easy to forgive someone else [Music] he even goes so much to say neither will i forgive you if you can't forgive somebody else you're tampering with the grace of god with an unforgiving spirit holding something 10 years ago that somebody said to you and somebody said 20 years ago and you're still holding on to what the brother or sister said it's called forgiveness we release it can you say amen i think that we need to go i'll get more into that in a second when we get into sodom oh my we gotta pick it up next sunday okay praise the lord hallelujah let's all stand raise your hands cry grace hallelujah hallelujah feel grateful you may be seated part two bob you didn't drive all that you didn't drive all that far did you just a little sir sermonette i won't be that long but i got i think i got to finish some of this here so i've been thinking a lot about repentance and grace and repentance we won't get into much of it that those go together those elements are there and with all the doctrine and everything god's blessed us with and all the revealing of the word the last even this weekend after all the glorious word then you gotta watch god come down sunday night and call for confession oh but we got all this hi we're just basking in the sun and it was glorious and then i'll tell you if you weren't here the sovereign god just came down and baptized this whole place and it was a call for repentance it was a call for confession why there's no moving of god without confession there's no change by the word without repentance these things are so powerful and listen now the entrance to the church the grace of god brought christ to calvary that was his grace we didn't deserve that so now out of his grace comes this power of the resurrection but still when they were on the upper room and they said peter what we do after they come out there what do we do repent so even with the grace of god of calvary you still couldn't enter in without repentance so he entered the church through the channel of repentance then when we exit in laodicea the last thing he says is be zealous therefore and repent so the entrance into the church with true repentance and our exit out of laodicea is true repentance you say oh but in revelations 4 after the last scene age he calls us up come up hither by a voice and the bride's being called up and i'm not making fun of that that's exactly what happened we're called higher but to higher revelations and higher seeing it higher he called john up higher voice called the bride up higher i agree but not without repentance what brother brahm says here in the later scene age but god is calling for another zeal at the end of leosia it is it's it is the zeal to cry you have that one god is calling for another zeal it is the zeal to cry i am wrong now who's going to say that he is wrong what is that all these denominations are based upon the claim to originality and that of god the claim that they're right now they all cannot be right in fact not one of them is right they are white as sepulchers full of dead men's bone they have no life they have no vindication god has never made himself known in any organization in other words you understand now he's not going to put his endorsement upon a denominational creed god may bless people god may heal people that's a different story it's god endorsing and god dealing through a denomination he's never done it and he never will do it they say they are right because they're the ones that are saying it but saying it does not make it so they need the vindication thus say the lord of god and they don't have it now let me say this here i don't believe that god is calling only the false church to a repentance which they won't repent i don't believe god is calling only the false church to a ribbon it's in this verse he is talking to his elect they have some repenting to do too no i've moved into revelations 4 where a voice says come up here that are unto all these revelations not without repentance you don't you can't come out of laodicea without true repentance what do i repent of people think of repenting all the time is my smoking my drinking my dressing in modestly i'm repenting no no you got to repent of your false doctrine that you believed before your denominational creeds whether it be baptist whether it be if it's a denominational creed not the truth of god's bible but if it's a creed and it's not bible you have to repent of that my your pentecostal background is not meant to come into this message you have to repent of that pentecostal background those pentecostal traditions you when you come to this word you repent of it and say that was wrong he's right i was wrong he's right and i'm going with the word i like what he says there they have some repenting to do too there's a change when there's repentance and gideon brought it up to me that the hebrew word or the greek word to repenting is to return so if you say sorry see i feel in your cheers because i want to get into a little series esau sought the place of repentance and he couldn't find it because god even has to give that to you he sought it with tears so i believe in tears i believe in being broken but because there's big crocodile tears doesn't mean there's repentance going on just because you're saying i'm sorry doesn't mean there's revenants it's deeper than just saying i'm sorry for what i've done it's returning lord return me back to the original take me back lord to what i from what i lost it means to return it means to change your ways that's true repentance so now when we cross over into the grace grace is provided for the entrance and grace is provided for the escape it's called 14 times brother branham calls it rapturing rapturing grace oh hallelujah rapturing what rapturing grace it won't be that it's a cold to live by and we live by that cold perfectly we make a rapture it's rapturing grace crying grace in the worst state in the worst state you can be in so now if you get your bibles you gave me a little extra time so if you get your bibles here noah chapter six so we've got the days of noah we've got the days of lot all right genesis chapter six the days of noah genesis 6. that's what we live in oh my verse six and chapter six and it came to pass when men began to multiply in the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all they chose and the lord said in other words they didn't really technically get married to him then just took him and lived with him as wives and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he is also flesh yet his day shall be 120 years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men they bear children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown so now you have a generation coming out of this perversion and this marrying wives and sex sexual things outside of marriage now you have a generation rising up that become actually our idols our icons that the world will look to these are the renowned men these are the proper the ones angelina jolie these are the ones out i love what she wears ah and we can we gaze after them and that's the generation of these people who come from perversion before them and god saw that the wickedness of men was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved you know what it's mounting up to here okay the judgment of god coming in a flood it's mounting up and it repented the lord that he and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fouls of the air for it repented me that i have made them it's a good thing it doesn't end there the next scripture but noah found grace but noah found grace destruction's going to come but noah found grace he says here's what you need to do this is this is it i'm i'm speaking through my prophet you and your family will be saved he was hoping everybody would get saved they didn't repent so he builds this ark and does all this thing and then he enters in the ark god shuts the door and for seven days there was no judgment and for seven days nobody could get in the door was shut but his family was in you don't think that's gonna repeat again you don't think we're close to that it's god that shuts the door he says the last one that gets saved he decides that not you but for seven days they're going i wonder oh my goodness what's going on here i don't know we just obeyed god we just have to trust him it's the grace of god that told us to do this and we're sitting in this ark with all these smelly animals but we're living in his grace his grace and a prophet his grace told us what to do and here we are sealed in this arc and then trickle trickle trick hears it and it just comes if you ever get to go to sights and sounds and watch the noah they make it like you're in the ark you start to hear and then it just pours and that feeling that they recreate of being inside there when the storms are hitting and the floods are rising and you're living in god's grace that what a feeling i'm protected my children are protected is anybody getting this this morning you could have qualms with noah all you want you could argue like the scientists and say that's not scientifically we've never seen riemann before you can do the research on google and say noah you are a false prophet you're not nothing i don't believe you you're just a farmer i wouldn't listen to you anyway you can mock the messenger oh you want to but when destruction was over him and his family were the only ones who survived the judgment and there was a guy here years ago and he was kept fighting with me about me quoting brother branham and pointing and why do you have to do that so i was just sitting there thinking i said this guy every service he's out there meeting me and hitting me at me i don't even know i came i said to him one time i said why don't you start your own church he gets all mad why are you saying that because i said you know everything already go start your own you know i'll give you some chairs or whatever you need a pulpit just you know you just if you don't like this stop sitting around and being miserable i really say it to all of you and i don't want anybody to go but don't sit here and and be in between two worlds we know what we believe here we know we stand you're gonna be a healthier person spiritually if you choose what you believe and be happy about it god help me this morning i said to him the other thing i said to him i said all right i have one question was there any grace outside of noah and his message and his children are standing around he's standing around and daddy couldn't answer the question he just he was kind of like that nomination for a judge supreme court when she was asked what the definition of a woman is and uh uh and this brother he was just god bless him he didn't know how to answer that because there's only one answer to that was there any grace outside of knowing his message there's only one answer to that so you can have all the qualms with you want to but history shows itself and noah you know what they you know what when they finish the 40 days and 40 nights and god sent a dove in the window and they were brought in olive and they'd survived the storm i just wonder if noah and his sons and his daughter-in-laws were shouting crying grace with it all you want to but at the end of the day it was his grace we better finish sodom and gomorrah next sunday but i'll tell you it's something because sodom gomorrah is on our day too and abraham i'll just mention it to you sodom and gomorrah was just before judgment i'm going down to destroy and god visits abraham and sarah and says i'm going to visit you according to summerlike time of life i'm going to give you a child like i promise reaffirms the promise to them sarah laughs in the tent behind him because she doubts and he said why did sarah laugh at me just now she said i did i didn't laugh i was lies to him you know this is serious but it was a different action than what we would expect it was the grace of god abraham i'm getting ready to go down to southern gamora i'm going to destroy it sarah just laughed at me but you know what my word is still true you're going to have a baby through that woman i'm going to visit her no sense in you criticizing sarah for doubting because every one of you have doubted every one of you have had mind battles but there's something greater than your doubts there's something greater than your mistakes there's a covenant there's something more powerful than your actions sometimes and it's the grace of god and i wonder after that incident and he's headed down there to sodom sarah runs out to hear abraham i'm so sorry embraces him honey i'm sorry i'm so sorry for doing that she said what do you think honey i just left my hands i wonder if she said grace grace i didn't deserve the favor of the king just then i doubted him but his grace let me stay in now the situation with lot is very squirrely because he wasn't really asking for god's grace he was down there as the mayor in sodom and gomorrah trying to help the homosexuals and trying to help them he had left abraham years ago and his wife wanted the fashions of sodom and gomorrah so she headed in that direction she swayed her husband because she wanted the fashions and so they're down there all these years this is abraham's nephew it's a family member he's not really he doesn't know destruction is coming he's trying to save the whole world here he's trying to help these homosexuals all right and so now he's been so integrated into that that even when the angels come and knock on the door and you know what happens they're trying to get to his own these two men angels to you know the story and and lot is so perverted in his mind now i know the bible says the sins of sodom vexed his righteous soul daily but if you read the bible i'll give him that but he's a twisted man because he's become twisted by sodom please don't take these men these are these are messengers of god take my daughters instead that's the results of living in sodom and gomorrah that even a man who's angry about it in his soul he's still messed up in his mind you read the story i was reading here about three months four months ago and i'm going this man's not asking for grace and is he valuing the fact that the only reason he got grace is because the grace of god that abraham and sarah felt spilled over and they said when when he knew that he was headed down there and abraham abraham knew this is what's going to happen and you're not going to stop it the grace of god spilled over he's crying grace but he says my nephew's down there and i'm asking you if there's any righteous would you spare it so notice the grace of god is not for us to monopolize and give to whoever we want lot's only hope was abraham praying for the grace of god for him so don't stop praying amen so he's he's he's saying lord if there's 50 if there's 40 if there's 30 and there wasn't even that in sodom and more there wasn't any except just slot and god spared a lot because abraham asked for it he extended grace but then you read the bible i know i got to finish i know you read the bible and it's like the bible says i pray that we would just look at our lives because i certainly don't want to be a lot i'm called to the mountain with abraham i'm abraham's seed but this guy he's got angels there and he says quick get ready he went and talked to his um his other family members his son-in-law's i think it was and he said to them we got to get out we got to get out god's going to destroy it and they had such disrespect for a lot their daddy that they just mocked him they said you're laughable get out of our home so there was no respect to daddy because daddy was a compromiser daddy never had a stronghold the woman ruled that house basically they moved to sodom because she wanted the fashions she was ruling the roost so he asked his son and i said let's go no no hey listen they mocked it as if it was just a joke so he runs back and the angels say we got to go now we got to go now get your stuff you know what the bible says that lot lingered i read that i'm going what in the world are you doing what do you have to tie up before you leave here what business i don't even know what that means that he lingered destruction is coming and he's lingering what are you doing like this is all going to be destroyed what you need to be doing now is grabbing your daughters and heading out that door but he lingered so much so the angels because of the grace that was ministered by abraham they didn't have to do this this guy's lingering he's not really interested he doesn't see the grace of god at all he's lingering they had to grab lot's hand they grabbed his hand and his his wife and daughters and they had to lead them out of the city themselves because he was so messed up in his mind he didn't see and that's why i see a lot of people don't see the grace of god they don't see it when it hits them it's throwing them a lifeline and they don't see it they're not going to come to the altar they're not going to repent because they don't see what grace is but when it hits you and when you see it you better respond because not everybody not everybody's going to respond not everybody's going to get it but lots being offered because of it and then i got to finish with this if there is such a thing as finishing this sermon he leads them out and so they're going to destroy all the cities and they say to him you run to that mountain lot you and your wife run go to that family you know what he says he says but i would rather go to this city over here can you destroy them all and save that city for me i'm going what kind of mind he was messed up from sodom he can't even think clearly anymore he's been so bound by hollywood and by sodom's perversion that he can't even see the grace of god in two angels that's saying get out of here now can i have that city and you know what they gave it to him they came to him they they they they gave it they said all right get to that city then get to that city so they're on their way and you know the story his wife turns back because her heart was in sodom there's no revelation of where no revelation of where she's at in time right then she didn't believe there's going to be destruction her heart was in the fashions of sodom she loved her life in sodom and gomorrah she turns oh honey don't no he said don't turn don't turn she turns becomes a pillar of salt and remember jesus says remember lot's wife we better have this thing in our hearts lord put this thing in my heart kill sodom and gomorrah kill this thing of wanting the fashions of the world kill it lord because we're reaching days where what's in our heart is going to show up i'll just end it by saying that you know where lot should have been running i can't understand that the story if you understood the grace of god lot would have been not asking where to go he should have known where to go you know where lot should have been running back to the mountain with abraham that's where i left i got to go back there he's not even asking for it but he said family we're going back to abraham because he's living under the grace of god and i'm not going to quant with his beliefs anymore i'm not going to criticize him i'm going to get up there and have him teach me the word of god i'm going to stay there because he's living in the grace of god he's not going to be destroyed by sodom he's going to have a body change his wife's going to have a body change and they're going to bring forth the promised son oh the bible's perfect isn't it the bible is perfect it's it's speaking of your time right now don't be allah don't be a lot's wife run to the mountain with abraham i'll tell you i'm happy and content i don't even have to go preach around the world i have hardly any desire to go anywhere more unless god just knocks me on the head i'm content just to be here to serve the lord with you people to preach the word until the rapture i'm content right here let's live it let's let's just live it let's quit playing games with it listen get the holy ghost and stay filled with it and i don't want anything complicated i don't want this message to just be a movement and you know what i'm crying for more of god's grace god i need your grace i need your grace to make it in what's that song come and sing it i need your grace to make it through please forgive me the song says please forgive me i need your grace to make it
