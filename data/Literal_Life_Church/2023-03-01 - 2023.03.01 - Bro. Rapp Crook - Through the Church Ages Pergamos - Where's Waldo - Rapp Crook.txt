TRANSCRIPT
========================================
The Book of Revelation chapter 2. we were sorry to miss last Wednesday but it sounded like from all the ice that fell up here that was a pretty good call to make so yep that's uh we just took a rain check and we're here tonight we'll just take her text from Revelation Chapter 2 and verse 12. and to the angel of the church in pergamus right these things Sati which hath the sharp sword with two edges and that's what we're going to take our our inspiration this evening let's just let's just pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your goodness and your grace to us this evening thank you for the ability and the freedom Lord to gather here father I thank you for the the good atmosphere Lord that's been created Lord thank you for the privilege Lord to worship you that you've called us and we've been able to respond to you father Lord I pray that you continue to pull on our hearts tonight Lord both here and at home it might be listening father may your spirit be present with each one we pray in Jesus name amen you may be seated I was uh been wrestling with it with some some thoughts over the last week and quite how to present something and the thought came last evening um where's Waldo I can remember waiting in the dentist offices for the appointment and you're just looking you're pouring over books for the entire time trying to find where Waldo where Waldo is until anybody never do Waldo no never do Waldo my goodness my goodness well Waldo is the guy uh the lower at the left there and you got a book full of all these drawings you gotta find where Waldo is and there are different guys masquerading look-alikes of waldoor a sister of Waldo a cousin of Waldo all these different variations and I just got to thinking um I'll show you where Waldo is in a minute so we don't have to worry about that um this got to thinking one of the insights where the brand name opens in the church age book about the about the church ages is that there are two seed lines to a false Vine and to True Vine going throughout the scripture and even in the church today and Jesus says in the last days the two would be so close together it deceived the very elect if it were possible this got to thinking my as we're going through we're looking through the Bible where's the real Waldo there are lots of different ones who are masquerading as this is the work of God for now this is the Christ but where's the real one and that's just where we had our inspiration because you can go on every single page you're looking for Waldo again and uh it's easy to look back on previous Pages once he's been found or once your your daughter or son who's looked at the book many times you can my daughters they they've looked at these kinds of books and they could I mean they can find these guys really really fast they have the book memorized but once it comes your turn and where's Waldo now that's kind of the question for us is kind of like where is Christ now where is Christ working now because that's that's the key question you don't want to find out you know where he was on the previous page that's all well and good but where is he now and right now on this page he's right there and took a while to find him but uh but but he's there and if we look in Revelation Chapter 2 we did last time but in verse 13 um Christ writes to the Church of pergamus I Know Thy works and where you dwell even where Satan's seat is yet you hold fast my name have not denied my faith even in the days where an Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwelleth and like kind of like we talked about a couple weeks ago Satan wasn't dwelling there in Perkins with these with these uh horns on his head in this in this forked tale he was masquerading as a church he'd been able to take over churches he had access to Christ's name he was able to issue edicts in Christ's name because through Constantine Satan had gained access had gained leadership of churches which permitted Satan he's like this this coup d'etat he was able to actually act in the name of God and even as Paul writes and I think second Thessalonians he's seated in the temple of God receiving worship as though he were God so in this age of perkamus it is a question Where is Waldo where is the real work of Christ because there is so much masquerade and going on and Satan has been able to to take over churches by a nicolaitanism where he's ruling the laity um and and and and they're not following the rule of the Holy Spirit at all and he's also been able to more subtly influence the churches through the doctrine of Balaam which we had looked at last time and as we've seen as we've talked through these uh through this series before as Christ introduces himself to each Church age he introduces himself as Christ but he highlights certain attributes and it's those attributes that are really going to be important for that age to overcome in that age and in this age when they're in in and and in progress when there's so much deception abounding where Balaam is saying hey we're all the same Anyway come worship with us it's all going to be great it'll be just fine it's really important to know where's Waldo where's the real work of Christ and Christ identifies himself at the very beginning these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges he identifies himself from the get-go from the very beginning is I am the word and if you've got questions about what's right or what's wrong don't go by your feelings don't go by perceived blessings of things because that's how the doctrine of Balaam works and practice God's word is just advice you get a second opinion of good things follow from it then that's probably just fine that's how Balaam operated but you can find all kinds of examples in the Bible I just read one in my Bible class this morning jeroboam II he's an evil King yet Jonah the son of a midi he makes prophecies that that Israel is going to expand their border and under jeroboam II land is restored but the verse before so jeroboam the second is an evil King but the next verse says he's not doing it because of the evil King God's doing it because he's merciful to his people so sometimes when there are blessings it's not because of the leader it reflects on God's mercy not because of the righteousness of any individual so we can't look at good things happening is always being a sign of what God's blessing is because God identifies himself these things Sethi which has the sharp sword which with two edges look to the word as our Compass as our Plum line balam's guiding principles tripped Israel up they'll trip us up as well just kind of by way of review Bill pure means Lord of The Gap and if we find folks we can be looking for the loopholes what can what what what's what's just allowable what what can I get away with and still be okay but he's the lord of the loophole too and eventually another loophole just becomes a noose and that can lead to our own spiritual death teaching of balaams is basically The end justifies the means as long as numbers of whatever metric is being followed as long as numbers are increasing no reason to look closely at methods but methods have a way of subverting the end eventually and that's still the case today so we don't look at any other method we don't look at uh brother Branham says the beauty of the church is the character of the people not the number of the people not the size of the building but the character of the people the how close we're walking with God that is the only metric that God cares about the teaching of Balaam says Hey the permissive will is fine it's it's the permissive will God's letting it happen it's going to make a way for his perfect will all things work together for good so God just to happily ever after kind of God that's a false Balaam there that's not the real Waldo that's the false Waldo we don't go that way because it's going to go it's going to lead to bad results for certain and I just like this on the bottom of page one this this idea of the permissive will being acceptable for us that that's that can get in our minds very easily and I just want to look what what Mordecai says to Esther if you hold your peace at this time Esther had a choice if you hold your peace at this time enlargement and deliverance will come from another way you hold your peace God's perfect will delivering the Jews will still be accomplished but your role in it can be changed so the permissive will makes a way for the perfect will in the sense that God's perfect will will still be accomplished but don't play around with the permissible thinking it's all going to work out well in the end anyway because that is tempting God but what um what I want to kind of look at um look further on today is we're kind of transition making a transition between the the Perkins age and the thy attire and age um and brother Branham talks about how the deeds and the doctrines of the Nicolaitans the doctrine of Balaam both of those are focused on In this passage we look at this evening but they lead up to the teaching of this false prophetess Jezebel that's who sits them thrown in the next Church age he says they are not three different Spirits or three different spiritual principles he says the these three are about the various manifestations of The Same Spirit as it goes from depth to depth it is just the Antichrist Spirit of organization in its three various stages and at the top of page two brother Branham continues here I didn't put the whole quote on here it says a ritual and ceremony was given an increasing part in worship and soon this whole system was a militant and diabolical power that did its best to control all through the persuasion of discourse or literal Force it received its energy from its own false prophecies and not the word of God it was now absolutely Antichrist though it came in Christ's name because Satan had been able to sit and throw and get himself in the church sit in the throne there and it just got me here it's what are we getting our energy from our spiritual energies have come from the word of God nothing else comes from him and this in this church they're on a completely different foundation and they're now receiving their he says their energy their virtue from its own false prophecies and the Sigh attire in age he talks about it says this is an age of a dominating female this is Mystery Babylon she's the great Jezebel the false prophetess and why is that we're going to see what actually is happening here the true female is submissive to God Christ is her head she has no word but his no thoughts but his no leadership but his but what about the false Church she's cast out the word she doesn't want she wants to be able to do her own thing have her Services the way she wants to hold them as long as we still get the same people happy and and blessed feeling that's the the age today look at more the Church of State teach moralistic therapeutic deism if a general idea of what's right and wrong therapeutic you give good feelings and you have deism this general idea of a god up there who's going to be your Cosmic Butler when you need him that's how it's taught today but this is this is the spirit of a domineering woman let me do what I want to do I'll call you when I need you that's all that it is I want my own way don't tell me what to do I'll ask your advice when I want it that's it and that's what's starting to sit and thrown there in the Church in the pergamian age and if we think about what what happens I have a couple scriptures on on page two here Ephesians 5 21-24 this talks about the submission in the in the marriage of wife to husband and that is just a picture of the submission that the church has to Christ for as the husband and wife submit yourselves to your own husband is unto the Lord for the husband is head of the wife is Christ of the head of the church the savior of the body as the church is subject to Christ let the wives be of their own husbands and everything he's talking not just about relationships but he's talking about the church the relationship of the church to Christ and then this pergamian age and Messiah tiring age the church really doesn't care what Christ says anymore the false church because they've they've pushed him out and that first Timothy 2 12 I suffer not a woman to teach nor did usurp authority over the man but to be in silence yet it's in this particular age where church councils are coming together and they're making their own pronouncements over to settle different questions and they start taking their own church councils as being authoritative and that is the spirit of a dominating woman because they don't care anymore what the word actually says we've come together we've solved the question that's what we're going to go with here but Paul says I suffer another woman to teach the church receives it doesn't come up with things it receives and this just continues to grow throughout the ages until finally if you look at the laodicean church age in Revelation 3 it says because thou sayest I'm rich I'm increased with Goods I have need of nothing and here this is the only church age that's actually distinguished by what they're saying about themselves this is the talking Church they're talking about themselves I've got this I've got this I'm so great I've got this program I've got that program they're talking about themselves and they really don't care what God says about them anymore they're just advertising what they have but and this is the the church then isn't even able to hear much less receive what Christ is trying to say to him he's standing at the door and knocking but they're so busy talking about what they are good are how good they are that they can't even hear him trying to get their attention but it starts back here in Perkins as they've as they've lost attention through the word they're basing their rightness before God on anything else except the word they just want to have it the way they want to have it at the um bottom of page two I have a a quotation from a church historian and he's speaking about four Church councils the Council of nicaea in 325 A.D the Council of Constantinople the Council of Ephesus and 431 and the Council of calcedon in 451. Justinian says that these four councils which took place and were confirmed our authoritative in the Church of God and he added in like manner all the four synods of the Holy universal church we receive as we do the four books of the Holy Gospels this statement he's saying these Church councils what they say is just as valid as Matthew Mark Luke and John this is what brother Branham is saying they've put aside the church sorry the church has criticide the word and the church is just kind of in an echo chamber whatever they want to hear they're going to go with they don't they don't want God to be telling them what to do they just want the holy Cosmic Butler to come at their call but as far as leading them no so Paul's telling I suffer not the the woman to teach you serp Authority the church is doing that very thing when they're appealing to their Church doctrines and their books instead of the word of God amen I remember when we looked at one of the under the sessions early on I think chapter one or two we talked about basic keys and one of the the basic key one of the basic truth brother Branham talks about is that there's a false fine and that there's a true violence he says now a Revival signifies a move of God in power and every time God moves Satan is there to move also it never fails and then this statement caught my attention I hope and trust your spiritual mind enough to get that and capitalize on it this is a truth that helps us to live today if we can say there's a True Vine there's a false Vine there's a there's the rain falls on the just and on the unjust both can enjoy Revival but that the blessings don't mean it's true that it's right who is speaking to them here it's I am he which at the sharp sword which two edges God's revealing himself as the word that is the basis for what we're taking is our leadership going forward so as we as we kind of look through the scriptures um keeping this idea where's Waldo well the real Waldo please stand up can we find him and I want you to go through any air travel you got to go through get get your ID checked and you can imagine back in this day in the in in the church ages even still now when folks are coming they they're in they're in the Ephesian age the apostles coming and trying to minister in a church was commended for trying them who said they were Apostles but were not so the church is listening to the word that's coming forth they're doing an ID check does this match not what I feel should be right or what my brother said is right but what the word actually says is right this is there a match we want to have is that is this the real one is what we need to be finding because Paul says in second Corinthians 11 there are false Apostles deceitful workers who transformed themselves into the angel into the Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light so it's important when we see things moving can we do an ID check is is this according to the word of God or is there some is this something that has to do with the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which can sound very good can be very impressive produce some amazing I mean like brother Paul quoted from uh watch many it's amazing what the American church can do without even praying we can do an ID check is this a work of God or not is this a doctrine of Balaam this is a teaching of bailing it's important that we do an ID check because there are false Waldo's there are there's the there's there are false Messengers parading themselves around as angels of light and trying to uh to come across as as true and brother Branham teaches the Bible teaches they can come with an a genuine anointing Balaam had a genuine anointing he's up there on the hilltops and he's giving beautiful prophecies I see a star coming out of Jacob I see a scepter coming out of Israel it might have been these prophecies that let the wise men know who would have come from the East they would have been familiar with balaam's prophecies these gave the wise men grounds to be looking to the toward the East to be looking towards Judah to be making that that trip this is a this is a beautiful prophecy it's right on the word it's exactly right his anointing is correct the prophecy is correct think about Caiaphas who is high priest presiding over Christ's crucifixion and he prophesies it is needful that one should die for the people anointing was correct his prophecy was correct Ministries can even seem to be really really powerful yet they're teaching and their life can still be wrong so we live in the book we can open up where's Waldo there's all these guys who are wearing the stripes different colors it can be really hard to find them but you have to ID check everything coming in is this what's according to the word or not what is true just want to spend a little bit of time on this Matthew Chapter 13 this is where Jesus tells about the parable of the of the wheat and the tares he says the tares the the um the farmer goes out and he's planting a seed and he sows good seed but then after he's finished somebody else comes along an enemy comes along and sows weeds both seeds are there both seeds are here in the world also Hebrews 6 7. brother brother Bram tells about how he went to Mishawaka Indiana for uh as he's going on This fishing trip vacation early on he was a young man and the Jesus only Pentecostals were having their Revival meetings there so he goes and uh goes to the meetings and he just says there are these men who are just standing up and giving prophecies and interpretations as a Baptist he's just completely blown away by this is amazing there's he talks to to one of them after they said my this guy's got a testimony he's the genuine deal he he's the the Lord reveals that to him and he talks to the other man and this guy is cheating on his wife he's just the worst hypocrite of all yet he's got this powerful manifestation of the spirit and brother branham's just confused how can this be and he's praying about it and the Lord speaks to him from this particular verse in Hebrews 6 7. now the Earth with drinks in the rain that comes off upon it it brings forth herbs meat for them by whom it's dressed receiving blessings from God but that which beareth thorns and Briars is rejected and he thinks about this scripture and then also in Matthew 5 he God makes a son to rise on the evil and on the good he sends rain to the just and the unjust and brother Benham just God God chose him as the as the sun rises up we've all got Gardens where we're planting and have weeds in the gardens coming up but the weeds and the plants are all happy when the sun comes up they're all happy when the rain comes down and that's like everybody who's here and we've got all three kinds of Believers in every church but when the Holy Spirit falls in the service everybody's happy everybody thinks it's fantastic but that doesn't mean that everybody's a genuine seed and and every move of God it'll it'll be that way so it requires some discernment I got a kick out of this Charles Schultz special he's quoting there it does rain on the just and the unjust and Snoopy is yeah and in my face too but these these things these Ministries they have powerful works that are impressive Matthew 7 says many will come to me in that day saying have we not prophesied in your name we've cast out devils and man those Devils just fled away we've done many mighty wonderful works but our works are never a basis to identify ourselves by we identify ourselves based on what God says about us because these folks did wonderful works but God says I never knew you so they could have all it seems like they've got great manifestation but if you look at the life they're teaching and life will lead you away from the word even though they're powerful Ministries are just amazing unusual those powerful Ministries are going to attract attention to self but we'll be so impressed with that and people love to have their knight in shining armor to lead them forward but is it the word that's leading us forward Matthew 24 there'll be false christs false prophets and they will show great signs and wonders so we can look great signs into wonders we can be really impressed by that but that is not a sign of someone's being of God necessarily we have to do the ID check is this person a the real Waldo this re the real Christ working through here what is the teaching how are they telling to live my my life in Hebrews 11 talks about honor them who are serving you and leading you following their conversation their manner of life look to see how their work their their preaching actually manifests in their own life their family's life is that the kind of teaching you want to follow or not because anointings can be genuine prophecies can be correct spiritual manifestations can be astounding but watch the teaching what's the fruit in the everyday life because you can have all the others and not have that last and then it's not worth a whole lot Jesus doesn't deny that they did the mighty works that only the Holy Ghost can accomplish by way of men some of those weeds anybody I've gone weeding it's amazing how fast those weeds can spread it's amazing how much those Wheats can get rooted it's I mean they can that's weeds can really grow but that just and it's the blessings of God upon the Earth that's enabled the weeds to grow but that doesn't make the weed all of a sudden a welcome member of your garden it's the seed the word that matters the most I got to thinking about a story that's told in the Old Testament Elijah is running from Jezebel he's running for his life he's he's had this Mount Carmel Showdown and he's just slain personally with him he's tired he's been hacking heads off all day long over 400 prophets of Baal he kills he's got to be worn out emotionally physically drained and then he races ahead of Ahab to the Palace because the rain's coming everything that he's been preaching for for me for several years is now coming to pass it all happens and he hears Jezebel's Proclamation I'm gonna get him and he's just he's just drained he's bowled over and he runs to the desert and hides and God sustains him and then God reveals himself to him three ways he says this Mighty Wind went right in front of him and says wow it was powerful but the voice of God was not in the Wind then this powerful earthquake has shut the place rocks just falling all over the place but the voice of God was not on the earthquake and then this fire passes through the man that could be the pillar of fire was that it but it says the voice of God was not in the fire but after the fire a still small voice that's where the voice of God was what do we get most impressed by we'd all love to see the wind sweeping through and I love seeing that in Services we love God coming through and just shaking those shaking the foundations and people being and we love that and if people get free from that we know God's moving we can see the fire coming and that's great but are we hearing God speak that's the most important otherwise we just leave emotionally pepped up and feeling good but that's not the image that sustains us for the long Marathon Journey but after these three things come there was a still small voice and brother Branham talks about this and he said he he says I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst and on page 187 the church age books speaking of the pergamian church Jesus knew there was going to be a terrible drift away from the word and the pergamian age which was as yet 200 years off from the patentless vision he knew that drift what caused them to go into the Dark Ages he knew the way man originally got away from God was by first leaving the word and if you leave that word you've left God you might continue to have amazing meetings they had amazing meetings in the program and they're in the false Church of herkimos but if you get away from God you the word you leave God that's why he's presenting himself to the church at pergamus and indeed to all churches of all ages I am the word if you want deity in your midst then welcome and receive the word don't let anyone or anything get between you and that word but I'm giving you the word as a revelation of myself I am the word remember that and then he says I wonder if we're sufficiently impressed with the word he gives us his best when he gives us that when I was a a freshman at College I can remember the campus Crusade for Christ hit up a little uh a little uh booth and the dining Commons and the tide level was who is Jesus and they have this magic markers inviting to come up and this right on there who you said who who you thought Jesus was people were writing up the Son of God a revolutionary a uh a good philosophy of all kinds of answers and I went up there a 19 year old guy 19 year old kid I went up there and I wrote up I felt really good about myself that Jesus is the word and that is the right answer but I and you know I didn't really know what I was writing I'd heard it in the church in Sunday school class Jesus is the word that's the right answer but what's it mean because the word is not just a teaching or a Doctrine and that's what we can it's easy to get that impression that's not take it any further than that we can think yeah when when God sent the message he sent his word and we just have correct Doctrine the correct teaching but it's so much more than that because he identity I am this and the closest I could come to try to to try to bring it across is thinking back to when when Elise and I were were recording we were emailing back and forth and this looks much more romantic than an email this old-fashioned love letters people would would write and they'd be sending these back and forth back and forth and we emailed for about nine months before we got married and my wife she actually has all those emails printed out they've been saved and go back through there and and go walk through memory lane and see them all that uh weed emailed for months before we'd actually yeah we hadn't talked more than probably 15 or 20 minutes together we'd spend a lot of time emailing you go for the first face to face you know how is this going to work and my mother-in-law was a little bit nervous because what if it doesn't work out I've got this guy here for two weeks and I've got to take care of him if it doesn't work out what's going to happen because all the emails all the love letters that's the word that that those are characteristics there's a lot there and the words in the Old Testaments is God expressing his his his love for the children of Israel that word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us it's like the guy who wrote all the love letters he's coming getting off the plane and I'm here now we can have a conversation now we can get to know each other better for real and eventually the word is made fleshy he comes back again for a marriage this is getting better and better and that's the that's the sense I want us to think about that Christ is Christ is the word because God's invisible it's hard to have a relationship with somebody that's invisible this is the only we can have relationship with God is if as he reveals himself to us so he's giving us hints of who he is throughout the Old Testament he's telling us little bits about himself and that's all well and it's wonderful but eventually that word that becomes flesh and then we have a relation this goes further and further first John 1 talks about that which we have seen from the beginning what your eyes have seen our hands have handled of the word of life this has gotten real it's not just words on the page it's jumped off the page it's in my life it's in my business it's changing my life I love this that's when we're talking about when we say Christ is the word he wants to he wants to manifest himself to you personally the word sounds so so ah yeah so yeah intangible it sounds so distance but it's that's the only way that Christ can start having a relationship with us because he's invisible he just starts he's got thoughts the only way to express that thought is a word and then that thought just and that word just keeps materializing and materializing but coming flesh more and more and more until he was born as a baby he dies from the cross for us more and more material till he comes in the Holy Spirit in your life the and the idea of the word is his that's how God comes into our lives in this way the only way that we can really be born again is by receiving that word that's where Christ his thoughts about us from the beginning they become material in us and we believe the word for our day and the word which in which we live just claiming some manifestation right pray for somebody and they're healed right I preached an amazing sermon people leave so blessed those are great but are we really taking God's word into our hearts where it's taking on a physical manifestation in our own lives that's what he who has the sharp sword with two edges is saying to the perkamian church age he's telling them don't be deceived by the doctrine of Balaam just going in on this great worship Fest where it's really really wonderful when you have great feelings and you leave with great feelings that really cheapens the relationship because marriage is so much more than good feelings same that's all that it is that ah that makes it so little because he wants to come in US changes transform us that's what it's all about that's what he who has the sharp sword with two edges says and there are lots of uh lots of more uh scriptures and some quotes on page four talking about but I think we we get the idea the evidence of it evidence of a Spirit-filled believer is not producing things it's receiving the word because we can try to produce everything we want but if we don't receive that word we're running on our own energy and we're eventually going to let out but if we receive the word it's going to produce itself it's going to and it won't be based on our own energy it'll be all on him evidence has to do with receiving the word and a lot of material there on chat on on page four to look at when I am when I teach English classes at school I like to use a a plot diagram what kind of illustrate where we are in the book what's going on because if you open a book and you just open up there in the middle and you start reading it's not going to make sense you have to know where you are in the book in order for it to make sense and this is a simple plot diagram a lot of our plot diagrams will look more like this you've got rising action things are going up and up and you might think at that first climax oh this is the climax this is this is the point of the book this is what I've been living for but no this is just predecessor to it there'll be another dip and we're going to up another this seems like the climax this is it this is the great Revival before we go home but uh no this is we're we're we're getting there in order to make sense of the plot it helps know where you are in the plot and then the all the other events make sense because if we don't know where we're at in the plot we kind of get like John the Baptist because John the Baptist had an expectation I'm preaching it's going to come right here and Jesus is going to do this and it's all be over we'll have victory and it didn't happen the way he expected he lost his orientation of where he was in the plot so he asked you this are you the one who should come or should we look for another so it's important that we know where we are and brother Brandon preaches a message modern events are made clear by prophecy and when they when they saw that title as a young person growing up at the Masters ah if I want to know what's going on in the world I'll just pick up that message and he'll tell me about what's going to happen with Iran in this nuclear bomb they might try to develop or he's going to tell me about global warming they're talking about this he hasn't talked about any of that stuff in that message so how are modern events made clear by prophecy in that message the way I kind of hey that is if you don't know where you're where you are in the plot the plot's not going to make sense but God sends a prophet to tell us where we're at in the plot what's coming up next and he's not going to give all the details but he's going to give us some general event what the plot diagram looks like and then we know what to expect going forward John the Baptist kind of lost sides of where he was in the story we can get that too expectations are dangerous things we have to have them but we can think one thing's going to happen that doesn't think oh man is this all even true we have to go back not to our expectations but to he who holds the sharp sword with two edges to what the word actually says about it and one reason I wanted to take this um take this topic here the seeds I want to talk about a little um a couple of pages that brother Brandon includes in this message on the pergamian church age in the in the church age book let's come sometimes referred to as the pick up your pen and write a section and brother Brandon Mattel so he was studying one evening and the end of the Lord the spirit Lord came down and says pick up your pen and write and he did that he picked up his pin and he just started writing him the Lord inspired him and he wrote and wrote and wrote in several several pages long I kind of to me this is a special couple Pages because it kind of lets us know where we are in the plot diagram what's going on what we can look to going forward and that's kind of important to know so we know what's coming and he talks about and I've got several several references several quotations here um as he opens this section he talks about the law of reproduction he's talking about how every seed Bears forth of its kind he says and this this word has to do with the word and the bride and he says here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction is that each species brings forth after its own kind just like it says in Genesis 1 11 and it says the same law applies to the church today whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed it says in these last days the true bride Church Christ seed will come to the headstones she will be the Super Church a super racist she nears him they and the bride will be so much like him that they'll be in his very image they'll be United with them they'll be one it says denominations can't produce this because it's the wrong seed and we can go back when you when you plant a garden you'll be planting all these all these different different different seeds and you can look at the look at the picture on the package and this is this is the fruit that should come forth yet at the same time within a few weeks you're going to have these and the dandelions weren't pictured on the package the enemies done that to our Gardens but the same thing happened in Christ's Garden the church Christ plants his seed his word even after he goes off and and his lead and and and they're sold in the seed the enemy comes forth on the very same Garden among the very same people and he sows the tares and which one is which they're going to grow up and it can be dangerous having your husband help you with the weeding it can be dangerous having your little kids help you with the weeding because I'll just kind of you want me to weed you want this cleared out I'll do it we'll just clear this stuff out and before too long I've cleared out a lot of good seed I took the weeds up I took some good stuff out too so in Matthew 13 Jesus says you have to let the two grow up together my wife's never accepted that is there a way to get out of weeding but that's what Jesus said just let the two grow up together because when that Harvest drain Falls you'll at the end you'll see very clear this is a tomato that's a weed it'll be very clear at that point you've got to let them both grow up but brother Branham talks about what we can expect as we're as we're heading toward Harvest Time and that helps us see where we are and what we can expect he talks about the both the former Reigns and the latter rain and the role they play in God's restoration work I just want to talk a little bit about about that and just kind of look at what brother Branham well his expectations are for this work that he's expecting God to do even as his ministry is in a transition because you're going to see what what what what what is he looking for that can kind of give us some guidance what can we be expecting God to be doing in the book of Hosea where does these references to former and latter rain come from uh Hosea 6 after two days will he revive us in the third day he'll raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth has prepared us the morning he'll come unto us as the rain as the latter and former Reign into the Earth and the former rain that is the early reign of the Autumn shower which is the planning cycle is different there but that that word yora is connected to to other words he instructs Jehovah hath taught me and we're going to see the former rain have to do with teaching and the Book of Joel be glad then ye children of Zion rejoice in the Lord your God he hath given you the former Reign moderately and this form of rain here it's it's a different word Mora but again the early Reign that comes in the sowing season after and then it's also connected to being a a teacher and then the message the spoken word is the Original Seed brother Branham comments directly about this he says someone asked me to repeat that Hebrew word again in Joel 2 28 we just read he's speaking that the former and latter rain the word former is the Hebrew word which means teaching in other words it'll be a teaching Reign and that'll be the former Ray and the latter rain is the Harvest rain and talk about these a little bit the the latter rain is talking about this is going to be this the leading us up to a Mount Carmel kind of a showdown the latter end is going to come as as a as a climax of Ministries and he's talking about John the Baptist he planted a former Reign John the Baptist is teaching preaching he's rejected by the churches but then when Jesus came on the Mount of transfiguration and God comes down and says this is my son hear ye him that's Vindication John the Baptist said this is the Lamb of God he'll take away the sins of the world Pharisees had their opinions Sadducees of their opinion people might have other opinions but when God comes down and says this is my beloved Son hear ye him that's The Showdown because no Pharisees are on that man of transfiguration no Sadducees were there only Christ and God saying this is my son hear ye him that's the show Young who's going to be there at that mount then kind of like this showdown on Mount Carmel you have Baal of His prophets and you have Elijah and God vindicates Elijah he's my Prophet that is the Elijah had so much he taught and labored much but that end came it was Vindication what was true what was not and brother Branham says the Forerunner of the last days is going to sow for the former reign Jesus will be the showdown between denominations and Creeds when he comes The Showdown is going to be the Rapture of his bride there'll be many who say yes I'm following him I'm the true church I'm going to go on that rapture but like we've seen in the Book of Revelation there's a True Vine and there's a false Vine that false Vine's not going to go how do we know who the real Waldo is well when Christ comes that'll be The Showdown that will be the that'll be that time of that ladder rain that's going to show who where what the genuine is there was a Mount Carmel amount Transfiguration is going to be a Mount Zion brother Brandon says and when I first read these um some time ago you kind of go at it first thinking man God sends this ministry to brother Branham and that is just completely awesome that's that that that's that that that that that's it it's interesting looking how brother how brother Graham talks about this they've been talking so much about ladder rain and this is he's saying this in 1962. this is not discarding you ladder rain Brethren but what you're talking about isn't ladder rain if the latter rain would have been here the power of God would have struck the thing she'd swept the world that latter rains fixing to come but what's the matter the church is manufacturing herself something just like Eve tried to do remember the church doesn't manufacture the church being the type of the woman receives and here in this case the church is so busy trying to produce something but they're not sitting still and just receiving and waiting and then when brother Branham talks about I'm just going to take a um sorry take a look at the middle of page seven actually bottom of page six at the end time seed sign he says there there's a revival going on what is it he says it's a sowing you don't hear very much of Billy Graham the more do you what about Oral Roberts the rest of them you know that great Revival fire is not burning what is it it's the end time a seed sign the word has been sown what is a denomination a denomination that makes them Confederate themselves together but the word of God has been sown also when the spirit of God begins to fall the word of God will live in the people and that's what the real thing is you've received the word of God and he and he activated he he quickens it and then yes there's a there's going to be a lot of false things out there that's been sown and that's going to be coming to maturity also because that latter rain falls on just and unjust it brings all seeds to maturity so the false thing that's been out there it's going to get even worse but the true that's there that is going to be coming to maturity also it'll reap a bride of Christ as certain as I'm standing here end time signs and at the top of page seven um it's good for as a reminder it's good for us to be very careful about our interpretations of what God's doing many people fought at the Pentecostal revivals were the latter rain but brother Branham said no you got it backwards that's the former ring completely backwards and sometimes our interpretations can be so well-meaning that they can be absolutely contrary to what God's doing remember when Paul is leaving Ephesus and he's got on his heart to go back to Jerusalem and wherever he goes people in the church are saying they're even prophesying Paul I think agabus puts his His Garment around Paul Schuler said the wear of this garment we bound and change in Jerusalem the the prophecy is true but everybody in the room interprets the prophecy Paul don't go God doesn't want you to go the prophecy was true but their interpretation was wrong because God was leading him to Jerusalem so we've got to watch out for our own interpretations of it remember brother Brandon preaches the the uh the Seven Seals and they tell us all the brothers just stay right here he's interpreting Junior Jackson's dream just stay right here around this this rock has never seen light before just stay there and keep looking at it just keep receiving it just keep receiving it just keep receiving it very few did that they went off with all kinds of other things they didn't do what he said to do we need to be careful about our own interpretations we just receive and I love this uh this takes all the uh all the pressure off um they're in the middle of page seven whether Brandon says in Investments like I've said before God needs Nobody to interpret his word he does his own interpretation by bringing to pass the things he said he would do so we can just keep our hands off and say God will bring it to pass when he wants to I know God's going to do something I'm going to keep right on receiving his word and if I could try to interpret it one way or the other I'll just show confusion with my own interpretations I'm going to keep my hands off it God's gonna do something he's going to get me out of here and I'm waiting for that and I'll just leave it at that because if I go further than that I'll be drawing people to my interpretation perhaps instead of what God actually says himself God interprets his own word he doesn't need our interpretation our interpretation is our own man-made thoughts that we put with it just like when agubus prophesies to Paul the man who wears His Garment is gonna die and you're going to be uh be bound in Jerusalem that's God's word the interpretation though they put the wrong spin on it don't go Paul that's wrong gotta be careful with our interpretation so what I'm gonna share further about the former latter rain I'm just going to say what he said I'm not going to put any interpretation to it God's got great things coming and we can be excited about it well I like seeing here I put the dates what what brother Branham when the the um the data that that he makes these statements because you can see he's wondering what's going on have I planted all the seeds that's supposed to be planted it's interesting how he understands his ministry his ministry says it's a planting Ministry he's sowing he's sowing seed have I done all the things I'm supposed to be planting is the time at hand is this great messenger fixing a step on the scene right now is the coming of the Lord near and says oh God and the next the second paragraph is actually I think a couple Pages further let your people realize that soon the Angels shall set foot upon land and see and raise his hands and say time shall be no more he's looking this is coming where are we exactly I'm not sure but it's coming then he says in July 5th 1962 he's talking remember Malachi 4 there's going to be he says there's a promise I'll restore there will come forth one with a message and he'll restore the hearts of the faith of the children back to the faith of the fathers he promised that the Malachi 4 that he would do it and when I read this quote the first time I said wow yeah he did promise that and you're it brother Branham and then he goes and he says but remember Malachi 4 the message comes the terrible day of the Lord will come that never happened after John if that was it then the scripture is lost it's hold we have had two thousand years since sin he says but we're still waiting for that something that's going to take the faith and restore the faith of the children back to the original Pentecostal tree and when I read this the first time I said yeah brother brim you've been doing that well it's 1962 and he says I've just been sewing we're waiting for that I thought what what's going on why why is he saying this and then in the message uh the countdown he says now we're in the seventh age the land is cnh and we're looking for that great messenger of the second appearing of Elijah on the countdown he says we're we're looking for that I thought my brother Brandon you've been here already since 1947 preaching what are we looking for because he's been sowing sowing sewing but we're still waiting for this to come and remember we're talking about well the real wall though will the real work of God show himself so we can so we can see what is true and what's false here this is what we're talking about then 1963 March 20th in the ma in the in the third seal what's this now the reason um says what um the revivals that we're supposed to have he says we have denominational revivals but we haven't had a real stirring no no no he says don't think we have revivals we haven't he says oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members which I bet somebody who watches the metrics are saying yeah we've cut a real Revival here but God's not looking for that metric he's looking for hearts that are restored that's the metric that God's after he says they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere he says the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet we're looking for it it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it where's the Revival it's not these church people flooding into a church necessarily Balaam would say that's it because this is the what's getting us results this is what's getting us huge numbers financially whatever number you look at balaam's happy with but brother bramlet said this isn't the Revival this isn't it and then at the uh at the end of the year 1963 December 29th it says so now I'm going to say something to you that I haven't said all along and that is the thing that we've looked forward to for so long at least many years four or five years maybe longer the third poll has now been Vindicated and I'm sure you all know what it is and maybe a lot of people said amen maybe they knew what he was talking about what he wasn't talking about I don't know but he's saying something has happened and we noticed in 1906 earlier in 1963 1962 he says we're waiting for something to happen it hasn't happened yet we're waiting for something all of a sudden end of the year in 1960s it's happened there's something that happened there that's the core of what the Revival is that will produce lasting results lasting truth and he says it's so sacred I mustn't say too much about it and he says this will be the one thing that to my opinion I don't say the Lord tells you this this will be a thing that will that will start the rapturing faith for the going away something happened and it was a revelation of that God is breaking forth the Seven Seals showing how he's been working Through the Ages who he is how he's working now is going to come and take us away this is another part of the word becoming flesh the word being the love letters we've we've we've known him for so long just by the love just by the letters but then when the word comes off the page and you go pick him up at the airport say wow I'm with them now we can talk we can talk and eventually that word becomes more personal when he asks me to marry him he slips an engagement rings on my finger that's what this is about because brother Branham is coming as a forerunner to prepare the way to restore the hearts so restore a bride to be ready so that wedding ring can be slipped upon her finger and he continues in the same message I want to say this according to what he said 30 years ago on the river down there in 1933 everything's happened just exactly I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world so we can easily get our attention too much on to just to the man brother Brown that he's got to be the one that does it but he's telling us I may not be the one that'll do it but the message I'm bringing that'll introduce Christ to the world just like John was sent before on the first coming the message will forerun the second coming it doesn't matter that the brother Branham the man isn't here because Jesus came to reveal himself to pergamus and still now I am he which holds the it's the sharp sword with two edges this is what produces the Revival this is how we can know what's true and what's false don't go by anything else but this and it's not that it's just word that we just oh yes I believe brother Brandon was a prophet I believe Malachi 4 5 and 6 no because if we have that in our lives it's like a woman's pregnant she's gonna be feeling all kinds of things there'll be kicks here kicks that she's feeling life inside of her we will have life we'll have Vindication but the one without the other is insufficient you have to have the word and life going with it and they belong together in 1964 in the message recognizing your day and its message he says everywhere now there's no Revival and I wonder if people he was with would have said the same thing I don't I'm curious about that everybody is complaining ministers crying hearing fast pray we want to have a Breaking of the day this great thing is going to happen pray pray pray for Revival we're not too late yet we have the same thing today people praying for Revival that's a great thing to pray for and God can come and do things sovereignly this is never we we we can never say this because God moves in another building that's not our building but it's not of God I was thinking about Jonah he is with he he he's a prophet of the god of Israel why doesn't God start a Revival in Bethlehem why doesn't God start a Revival in Jerusalem but for some reason that Jonah never hears an explanation for God starts a Revival in Nineveh what did Nineveh do to deserve that but what does Jonah get Jonah really gets uh spanked for his reaction to it because Jonah was an arrogant Jew he was like some of us message Believers some are saying that God can only move in my church no God will move anywhere God moved in Nineveh and the only appropriate reaction to a move of God is praise that's the only appropriate reaction and Jonah got spanked because he was mad that he couldn't see Nineveh burn he wanted to have a wiener roast there at none of his fires he wanted to celebrate that God says no I am having Mercy on these people the only way to respond to Mercy is praise you should be praising me John and that's how we should be doing it doesn't matter where God moves because we don't know what the end result of that will be so we want to praise God for whatever move he does at the same time also understanding how is God moving we have to look at the long term the word of God is the only thing that's going to be our our anchor I think about the story brother Brandon tells about the men who picked up the track where were you spend eternity and God's brother says God saved you then it was in The Message Church he hadn't been baptized he didn't even know a lot of things about the Bible yet but he responded to God and he God and he just keeps following following following following but it started in some place what's the use of putting the tract on top of the urinal this might have started just right there but God can move out every once to and when we see mercy and repentance we praise we're we're glad about that people want a Great Awakening because this world's rotten they want a Great Awakening they're praying for that just like we're praying for that but why is it why are they so crying out for it it's because they haven't recognized the awaiting of the Bride there's been a Revival and they've missed it and once you've turned that down things get dark fast it's like oh no it's getting dark Lord have mercy have mercy it's getting dark they've turned down the real Revival and by being a Christian notice he still calls them Christians that by being a Christian they feel the pull over the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they're looking for it way off in the future to come when it's already happened by you that's why it's so important to know where are we in the plot diagram where are you what is God doing so we know what to be looking for and expecting there in the future and the message the rising of the sun he says what is the opening of those seals it's revealing Christ Our bridegroom has come back and part of the Rapture is not just Christ's coming but the bride going and that's what he's come back to take us home with him and on Page in my middle of page nine I don't have this one on the screen but he says in the Feast of the trumpets there will come a messenger in the last days that will guide the people back to the first fruits back to the original Faith granted Lord that that great messenger Among Us now the great Christ the Holy Spirit made Vivid that sounds like the holy spirit's taking on flesh made Vivid for us made understanding opening up the word revealing to us may he guide them back to the original Pentecostal faith and works as Faith expressed and in The Invisible Union of the church the bride to Christ that messenger is here now which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever it's talking about a union with with him and just as we close the latter rain is that Harvest drain the Rapture how it's going to come the Dynamics of it I don't know I just believe it's going to come and we're going to be expecting and rejoicing when it comes but I just want to look at the scripture Jesus speaks of paribuses to the disciples behold the Fig Tree and all the trees I think this is a really neat illustration that when the rain falls on the just and the unjust all the trees will be brought to harvest maturity all of them and you can look around in our society today you don't have a lot of people who think differently who can work together and that's different I think than it was half a century ago or longer because ideas have come to maturity if you look at this acute triangle at the very beginning they're going different directions but the difference isn't that big between them so we can work together in more bipartisanship or we can we can do more together as time goes on these ideas are being brought to a maturity you've got you've got really woke you've got really conservative they're so far apart they can't work together and you've got that spiritually too you've got seeds that were sown denominational seeds and you just kind of see man it used to be I mean 50 years ago 100 years ago you find people who really cared on what the Bible said but you've got a lot of folks who take the name of Christ who may not ever open the Bible and for them it's just a cultural I'm an American and I'm some I like to have religious moral feelings why I identify as a Christian but if you're scratch it doesn't go much further than the skin and that the church that's based upon that seed is going to start allowing more and more things it started with letting women preach but then it goes off into letting homosexual men become ministers and letting lesbian women becoming it gets further and further all of a sudden how do we get here but that's what Jesus said would happen in the Harvest Time let those seeds grow and it'll be very clear which is which and that's the day that we're living in so in this day that we're living in what do we need to be impressed by we want to be impressed by the word because that's our anchor whenever we see that that could seem to be a move of God do an ID check does it really go back to the word or not because the wind can be wonderful it could be couldn't Quakes throughout the land fire could soon be falling but what's the teaching how is it actually affecting my life because God's Not About Numbers he's about the character that's being brought into the people and it's important for us to recognize he says I hope your spiritual mind is enough to capitalize on these things because we don't capitalize on it we're going to miss where we are in this story and we might not be ready for the next move that's going to come capitalize on it it's a personal relationship with God as he becomes flesh and he wants to become flesh become personal to you these love letters coming flesh and eventually that ring on the hand or his that's what it's all about where's Waldo where he's kind of talking about Where's God moving today that's the one to be able to identify and um listen musicians to come um getting brother Paula wants to close let's let's close with the word of Prayer heavenly father I thank you Lord for the word that you shared in these last days father through a prophet that helps us to see where we are in this story where we are and what you're doing and father as I just Lord read and I've read and have studied this just kind of think this is the quote we're coming close to a Harvest Time where where things are coming to a maturity and I and I just close with the idea what kind of seeds are we letting into our hearts because whatever we bring into our hearts we'll be blessed by that Harvest rain that will bring things to maturity but do I want every single thought that's coming into my heart to come into a maturity Lord I pray o God that you would help us to to grid up the loins of our mind Lord to to watch out what we're what we're impressed with Lord I pray that we would be impressed with or just a a simple man who who walked the shores of Galilee 2000 years ago nothing really had Isaiah 53 there's nothing in him that we could really be impressed with he's just a simple man and so many people on that day missed it just like today brother Branham comes he can't carry a tune to carry a bucket but he sings and Praises God and he's not educated he preaches a rough gospel but that's what you sent so we'd be restored to that original Faith oh God and Lord I know that it can be easy because of things we might have experienced in the past to build up complexes against the very thing that you've sinned to prepare us to leave this place and Lord I just pray that you would with your spirit go to each heart even now father and Lord you just cut those things down or any wall that we might have built up Lord I pray that you would take that down Brick by Brick Stone by Stone so Lord we can stand there and realize the one that I've tried to protect myself from is become flesh because he loves me and he wants to become flesh to me and know me personally Lord but we just yes step around our wall and Lord throw our arms around him have him throw our arms around us or just Embrace him Lord and I pray o God that this could lead to a or an embracing of Truth like never before Oh God a real Revival in our heart that anchors deep Lord that's not put on but that's completely genuine because it's your seat it's nothing that we produce nothing that we've got to be good enough do this or that or whatever we just receive your word we receive your word Lord I pray for a holy hunger Lord father we bless you Lord we love you oh God lord I pray for that Revival in our hearts father that we would hunger after you Lord father we would desire your word more than our necessary food Lord that we would see father you would also anoint our eyes with isap that we could really see Lord a week it's so easy to see I'm I'm rich increased with Goods nothing but no Lord we need you help us Lord to see how much we need you and open our arms wide our hearts wiser that we can be filled in Jesus Christ name we pray stand this thing to open our eyes
