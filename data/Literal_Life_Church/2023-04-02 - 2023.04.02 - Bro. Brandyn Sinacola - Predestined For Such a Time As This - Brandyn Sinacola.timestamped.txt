[0:00] just before we read Esther not to keep
[0:03] you standing too long but um I you know
[0:06] you get studying and things and forget
[0:08] that today was Palm Sunday and so
[0:11] um you know I just I was thinking uh
[0:13] there's there's a song that the Gaithers
[0:16] sing uh Palms of victory
[0:18] and um you know I I thought about
[0:21] singing it and then I thought about not
[0:23] singing it
[0:25] and I decided not to sing it um
[0:28] actually Ike if you could make me sound
[0:30] a little bit better just my normal
[0:32] speaking voice that would be fantastic
[0:35] so you know we're just thankful to the
[0:38] Lord and as we come up on Easter it's
[0:42] just it's it's good to reflect on him
[0:44] and I was grateful for the songs that
[0:47] Michael sing this morning because really
[0:49] when he was coming into the city of
[0:51] Jerusalem they were they were praising
[0:54] him hosanna in the highest and the king
[0:56] is coming he's the king the Lord Jesus
[1:00] and
[1:01] um you know it's just that's what we're
[1:03] here for this morning is to worship him
[1:04] every Sunday every day amen
[1:07] amen Esther chapter 4 and um
[1:12] sister Genie you can put up that first
[1:14] slide if you want to with the scripture
[1:18] or I'll just let you fly you you just
[1:20] follow me if you can and we'll do that
[1:21] she's good at it so Esther 4 chapter uh
[1:24] Esther chapter four verse 8.
[1:27] and I'm just going to skip a little bit
[1:28] here just a set of context
[1:31] also he gave him the copy of the writing
[1:34] of the decree that was given at shushon
[1:36] to destroy them
[1:38] to which uh to show it unto Esther and
[1:41] declare it unto her and to charge her
[1:44] that she should go and unto the unto the
[1:46] king to make supplication unto him and
[1:49] to make requests before him for her
[1:52] people and if you skip down to verse 11
[1:55] says all the king's servants this is
[1:58] Esther's reply to Mordecai
[2:01] all the king's servants and the people
[2:03] of the king's provinces do know
[2:06] that whosoever whether man or woman
[2:09] shall come unto the king into the inner
[2:11] Court who is not called
[2:14] there is one law of his to put him to
[2:16] death
[2:18] now she's focusing on on this part of
[2:22] that law but I want you to notice the
[2:24] next thing she says says accept such to
[2:27] whom the king shall hold out the golden
[2:29] scepter that he may live so
[2:33] Esther here
[2:35] is expressing that there's this threat
[2:38] of Grace in this law
[2:39] that no you can't just approach the king
[2:43] but if the king holds out a scepter then
[2:45] you'll live but she don't focus on that
[2:47] she focuses on the part that it's
[2:49] judgment
[2:52] but I have not been called to come unto
[2:55] the king these 30 days
[2:58] verse 14.
[3:01] and this is mordecai talking back to her
[3:04] for if thou all together Hold Us thy
[3:07] peace at this time
[3:08] then shout their enlargement and
[3:11] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[3:13] another place but thou in thy father's
[3:15] house shall be destroyed
[3:18] and who knoweth whether Thou Art come to
[3:20] the kingdom
[3:21] for such a time as this
[3:24] let's pray Heavenly Father we come
[3:26] before you
[3:27] and father we've sung the songs Lord
[3:30] we've we've laid our garments down and
[3:32] Lord we're just Fanning you with Palm
[3:34] leaves now we're laying on before you
[3:36] and we're we've sang hosanna in the
[3:39] highest and
[3:40] Lord you came to restore to us the joy
[3:44] of of your salvation
[3:46] the Salvation that you've given so
[3:48] freely to us and so father I pray God
[3:51] that you would accept our praise that
[3:53] you would Lord just let it be water over
[3:56] us now father and and as we just water
[4:00] you with our praise now we ask that you
[4:02] wash Us by the water of your word
[4:05] help us each one to get out of the way
[4:07] father
[4:08] lord they're they're
[4:10] maybe some Lord who
[4:13] Lord I'm not their favorite preacher
[4:16] maybe some Lord can't can't stand the
[4:19] sound of my voice I can't hardly stand
[4:20] it myself but
[4:22] father I just ask Lord that your word
[4:24] father would penetrate that you would
[4:26] help us to lay all those things down now
[4:29] and Lord just hear hear from you in
[4:31] Jesus name
[4:32] amen
[4:34] amen you can be seated
[4:39] just a couple
[4:40] um just want to take a minute and recap
[4:43] um I've been trying to finish up the
[4:45] Book of Esther the last couple times
[4:48] that I've preached and hopefully you're
[4:49] not growing tired of it
[4:51] um but I've just every time I open it
[4:55] um I and it's kind of silly you would
[4:58] think it would we would treat it
[4:59] different and I and I should but I every
[5:02] time I pick up the Book of Esther and I
[5:04] start to read something else jumps out
[5:06] at me
[5:07] and finally it kind of it's kind of
[5:10] funny but I kind of got scared of it and
[5:12] I was like oh my and I shut the book one
[5:13] day and I thought man this just keeps
[5:15] opening up and I it's like I don't know
[5:17] what to do what do I what if I ruin this
[5:21] um
[5:22] but I'm grateful I'm grateful to the
[5:24] Lord and even I mean even last night and
[5:26] study you read something and something
[5:27] else just jumps out and this morning
[5:30] reading it and seeing there that you
[5:32] know Esther she's she knows the law that
[5:35] you can't come before the king
[5:37] unless unless he holds out a scepter but
[5:39] she focuses on the part that she could
[5:42] die instead of the part that the queen
[5:45] she found favor once with the King
[5:48] and that he could hold out a scepter and
[5:50] that she would live
[5:52] but she doesn't focus on that and
[5:54] and you know we'll get into it more but
[5:56] many times we don't focus on the grace
[5:58] of God
[6:00] we focus on the Judgment of God
[6:03] and if you're the bride of Christ that
[6:05] judgment isn't for you
[6:07] amen
[6:08] so let's recap real quickly here brother
[6:11] John used to say I'll speak quick you
[6:13] listen fast
[6:15] was the richest and most notable King in
[6:18] the Persian Empire
[6:20] he in that types of Christ over in
[6:23] Daniel 10 13 we talked about the Prince
[6:25] of Persia it's the spiritual warfare
[6:28] waging against God's people their
[6:30] spirits on Nations brother Branham
[6:32] talked about the spirit on Nation he
[6:33] talked about the spirit on this nation
[6:35] and in the scripture we see it plainly
[6:37] that we can take what he said type it
[6:39] right back to the scripture that in
[6:40] Daniel's day there was a Prince of
[6:42] Persia that was warring against the
[6:44] Saints it was actually coming against
[6:46] the prayers that Daniel was praying for
[6:48] him and his people
[6:50] uh and then we we typed how the spirits
[6:54] on this age and and it's Waging War
[6:56] against us and but then we found over in
[6:58] Daniel that even though we could get we
[7:00] could get discouraged that their spirits
[7:02] and principalities in high places and
[7:05] and the way that the scripture words
[7:07] that we could get discouraged in that
[7:08] and we could focus on that but we found
[7:11] that Daniel the angel told Daniel he
[7:14] said but Michael your prince is on your
[7:18] side
[7:19] Michael your prince is standing for you
[7:21] and then we saw how the ages overlap
[7:23] between Daniel and Ezra and Esther and
[7:26] Nehemiah and and you know I just I just
[7:29] said go back and you know follow the
[7:31] church ages brother rappers is
[7:33] ministering on and then you can see
[7:34] where brother Branham over in the seals
[7:36] he talks about the seals overlapping
[7:38] each other and so you just have all of
[7:40] those types and shadows in the Book of
[7:42] Esther that um
[7:44] to me to me the Redemption story is a
[7:46] nester
[7:47] the whole Redemptive story it's it's a
[7:50] beautiful story and if we read it we
[7:51] could we could make plays about it and
[7:53] they do we could make movies about it
[7:55] and they do but there's there's a deeper
[7:57] meaning behind it and it's it's that
[7:59] that threat of Grace and and it's it's
[8:01] just the story of redemption to me
[8:04] are you with me this morning
[8:06] I know I said that some of you might it
[8:08] might not be your favorite teacher and
[8:09] you can't you know stand the sound of my
[8:11] voice but give me a few amens and it'll
[8:13] end quickly
[8:15] Queen vashti in the other way
[8:18] it's like I didn't get any strong amen
[8:19] so that must be doing all right
[8:23] I know Seth was thinking it though
[8:27] queen vashti and the other women of the
[8:29] palace were in defiance and rejection of
[8:31] the king's word and then with how
[8:34] um you know the rejection it's just a
[8:37] perfect type of uh the rejection of
[8:39] God's word by a church and now over in
[8:41] Revelations it talks about the mother of
[8:43] harlots and her daughters and we we
[8:45] found a deeper meaning because
[8:47] um you know many many especially sisters
[8:49] afterwards but it jumped out to me even
[8:51] even while I was preaching it it just
[8:54] jumped out to me more that we found a
[8:56] deeper meaning behind the king putting
[8:58] away of Ashley just for not accepting
[9:01] the invitation of his word and we found
[9:03] that it's because the king is Desiring a
[9:05] bride who's connected with his heart and
[9:08] who's reflecting his glory and when
[9:09] vashti did that she rejected the king
[9:12] and and she was not reflecting his glory
[9:16] it was rejecting his word and and we
[9:18] know if you reject the word of God
[9:20] there's only one place for you and it's
[9:23] in its in its death it's spiritual death
[9:26] we found that a decree to go find a uh
[9:28] the king a wife and and we type that
[9:31] with the scripture that says go search
[9:32] the the highways and the byways and
[9:34] compel them to come
[9:36] go go find the king of bride go find go
[9:40] find someone to come to this wedding
[9:43] and then we talked about uh Queen Esther
[9:45] and her display of the beauty of the
[9:47] character of Christ and and how she was
[9:49] a beautiful branch predestinated and
[9:52] elected to be Queen and she was chosen
[9:54] for her character and the desire for the
[9:56] king uh uh the king and for and for
[9:59] Christ our desire for Christ and and so
[10:02] that lies within our hearts
[10:04] amen and then we found an accuser last
[10:07] time we found an accuser was Haman the
[10:10] agagite and we traced that back because
[10:12] the scripture was so specific to make
[10:14] sure we knew Haman was an agagite and
[10:17] and we started following that back and
[10:19] we traced it back and we found him
[10:20] always fighting against God's people
[10:22] they come up out of Egypt and who met
[10:25] him amalek
[10:26] emelek was was the founder of the agites
[10:30] and
[10:31] and the amalekites and so we traced that
[10:33] back and then we typed it with Satan you
[10:35] find a lot of similarities with Satan
[10:37] and Haman and then we a little bit
[10:40] further in uh Schofield wrote that
[10:42] amalek is a type of the Flesh and the
[10:44] flesh is always warring against you
[10:46] and so Satan is not your greatest enemy
[10:49] your flesh is your greatest enemy
[10:52] your flesh is your greatest enemy and
[10:54] and uh
[10:57] brother Dan can you go get me a Sharpie
[11:00] you'll understand why
[11:02] later you got to stick around for it
[11:06] and so we typed that back and and we
[11:08] found that and so we found that Haman
[11:11] was trying to just to destroy God's
[11:13] people as Satan is trying to destroy
[11:16] God's people and and then we saw that
[11:18] but you know Paul wrote speaking of of
[11:21] amalek and and and Haman and typing the
[11:25] Flesh and things Paul wrote we found in
[11:27] Romans that when you sin
[11:30] and you're a Christian
[11:32] it's no longer you that sins Paul said
[11:35] you separate yourself from that it's no
[11:38] longer you who sin but it's it's the law
[11:40] of sin that works in your flesh so we
[11:44] found that you're not not now this isn't
[11:46] a license to sin you're dead wrong if
[11:48] you go take it as that but what I what I
[11:49] mean by is we found that when you sin it
[11:53] that does not get held to your charge
[11:56] that does not get held that gets hard
[11:58] that gets held to the flesh the charge
[11:59] of your flesh which is not you it's
[12:03] separate from the inner man amen and
[12:05] then we saw that in Deuteronomy 25 said
[12:08] the remembrance of emelek will be
[12:10] blotted out forever so you have a
[12:12] promise that one day that you'll lay
[12:14] down this flesh
[12:16] you'll lay down the Flesh and you'll
[12:18] take on your your theophany your
[12:20] Heavenly Body and then this flesh won't
[12:22] bother you anymore
[12:24] and we look forward to the day we pray
[12:25] Lord hasten the day
[12:28] and so one thing that I've been stumbled
[12:30] upon and and I think it might have been
[12:32] when we were in Florida the Lord showed
[12:34] me this and I and I was just thinking
[12:35] Lord I can type you as the king but that
[12:39] King was a drunkard
[12:40] and I don't know how to make that fit
[12:44] but then we found and and then I I just
[12:47] the Lord opened this up in a Nestor
[12:49] chapter 1 and verse 7 and it says and
[12:51] they gave them drink and vessels of gold
[12:53] the vessels being diverse one from
[12:55] another and Royal Wine in abundance
[12:58] according to the state of the king
[13:02] what's that mean that's true this this
[13:04] King was he's an alcoholic
[13:08] and the drinking was according to the
[13:10] law
[13:11] none did compel so they weren't forced
[13:13] to take the drink
[13:15] for so the king had appointed to all the
[13:17] officers of his house
[13:19] all the ministers
[13:21] the fivefold ministry that they should
[13:24] do according to Every Man's pleasure
[13:27] so as much as somebody wanted to drink
[13:30] the ministry the the the these uh the
[13:34] king's uh appointed officers they were
[13:38] instructed give them drink as much as
[13:40] they want give them drink well what is
[13:42] wine wine is the stimulation of
[13:45] Revelation
[13:46] but what's that mean is as much
[13:48] Revelation as you want the King has
[13:51] provided for you
[13:53] you can go get Revelation it's there
[13:55] it's it's it's free for you to take the
[13:58] King has said give them as much
[14:00] Revelation give them as much wine as
[14:02] they want let them have their fill
[14:06] the king gives us Revelation liberally
[14:09] so then in James 1 5 it says if any of
[14:13] you is deficient in wisdom let him ask
[14:15] of of the giving God who gives to
[14:19] everyone liberally and ungrudgingly
[14:21] without reproach and fault finding and
[14:24] it will be given him all you have to do
[14:26] is ask
[14:27] all you have to do is pray Lord give me
[14:30] more wine give me more Lord I'm thirsty
[14:33] I'm craving something there's a craving
[14:35] when an alcoholic goes goes you know
[14:38] he's he's struggling with that he's an
[14:39] alcoholic then he craves his body
[14:41] actually craves that alcohol it craves
[14:45] that substance and there's something
[14:46] within us that's craving Revelation
[14:49] that's craving the king amen so all you
[14:52] have to do is ask if you lack and the
[14:54] King will give it to you
[14:55] amen
[15:00] so
[15:02] this morning I want to take say are you
[15:04] with me this morning
[15:05] okay
[15:08] we want to take Satan's plan to cause
[15:10] spiritual death uh uh we want to take
[15:13] that plan and just take it a little bit
[15:14] further this morning and
[15:16] and so um I want to talk to you about
[15:19] this this heiman a little bit more and
[15:21] and how he was a Deceiver
[15:24] and Haman was a deceiver and he
[15:26] manipulates and he he tricks the king to
[15:29] destroy God's people
[15:31] and we know that nobody can pull a fast
[15:33] one over on God
[15:35] right so Satan's not going to trick God
[15:38] so you know again there's there's just
[15:40] certain things I can't make fit you know
[15:43] exactly thank you brother Dan
[15:46] there's certain things that I that I
[15:48] can't make fit you know exactly
[15:50] perfectly but but we know that we know
[15:53] this that we found that Satan had to
[15:56] come to God in order to get to job
[16:00] remember he said have you considered my
[16:01] servant job so here Satan has to come
[16:03] this is exactly what this is Satan has
[16:06] to come to the king
[16:08] in order to to to do anything to God's
[16:11] people and and we might say well that's
[16:14] not fair why would God allow Satan to do
[16:16] something like that to me but that's
[16:17] because God has God has faith in you
[16:21] God knows that Satan can give his very
[16:24] best to you and if you lean back on God
[16:27] and surrender to God Satan cannot have
[16:30] you he cannot pull one over on you you
[16:32] will be Victorious and it'll draw
[16:34] character and listen Satan will actually
[16:37] draw an attribute out of you that God
[16:39] knew was there and so when Satan goes
[16:42] and he says okay you can you can go do
[16:44] that to my servant Esther you can go do
[16:47] that to my servant Mike go ahead have
[16:49] you considered them go ahead and have
[16:51] throw your very best and then when Satan
[16:54] goes and then they come out of that
[16:55] trial and they're they're they're
[16:57] looking more like Jesus Christ than than
[16:59] God says uh April Fools
[17:08] so it it can be it can be hard to
[17:10] swallow though sometimes that why would
[17:12] God allow me to go through this
[17:15] why would God allow me to experience
[17:17] this and it's a hard thing to swallow
[17:19] but you got to understand also that that
[17:23] let me say it with this way and then and
[17:25] I don't mean this to offend you but that
[17:27] that understanding
[17:29] is something that's a stronger meat
[17:33] and and a stronger meat you got you
[17:36] gotta chew it better you can't just
[17:37] drink it down like milk you have to chew
[17:39] that better so it's it's not for for
[17:42] babies spiritually
[17:44] and if you're there that's fine keep
[17:46] drinking the milk
[17:48] you'll eventually graduate to to solid
[17:51] foods amen that's all right
[17:54] and then we there's a a quote I found
[17:57] and it says um and why does God let
[17:59] troubles come God harnesses trouble puts
[18:01] bits in its mouth and makes it obey him
[18:04] and those troubles bring us into closer
[18:06] fellowship with God so that's that's the
[18:09] reason you go through troubles that's
[18:11] the reason that you're experiencing
[18:12] sorrow is to bring you into closer
[18:14] fellowship with Jesus Christ
[18:17] now we don't want to hear that in in uh
[18:20] you know when when we still feel the
[18:22] pain from it but one day you'll look
[18:24] back and you'll see God's purpose
[18:27] you can talk to anybody anybody there's
[18:30] there's there's been things you've
[18:31] experienced no matter how how far you
[18:33] are in your Christian Journey there's
[18:35] things that you've experienced that you
[18:37] can look back and say I didn't
[18:39] understand it then but now I do
[18:42] now I understand it I feel I I feel
[18:44] closer to God in some in some cases you
[18:46] might even be able to say I thank God
[18:48] that I went through that
[18:50] because if I wouldn't have gone through
[18:51] that I wouldn't be where I'm at today
[18:55] when Esther was a LED away from her home
[18:58] by the Persians uh Persian soldiers I'm
[19:01] sure she didn't understand what was
[19:03] going on
[19:06] when Joseph was
[19:08] his brothers betrayed him and they threw
[19:10] him in the pit I'm sure he didn't
[19:12] understand in fact the scripture says he
[19:14] didn't understand what was going on
[19:16] he didn't understand why he went through
[19:18] the things he went through he didn't
[19:19] understand why he was in prison in the
[19:22] depths of prison
[19:23] and then he didn't maybe understand why
[19:26] all he's in prison but yet he's
[19:28] overseeing the prison
[19:29] Lord I don't I don't I don't understand
[19:31] you
[19:32] I don't understand how how can you make
[19:35] me go through this and yet you have this
[19:37] blessing but here I am still in this
[19:40] situation I don't understand Lord
[19:42] but then he he realizes that you know
[19:45] it's it's God's perfected plan and so we
[19:49] can't see forward we can only Look
[19:51] Backwards and so he gets at the right
[19:53] hand of pharaoh
[19:55] and and maybe he's thankful for the
[19:57] blessing but he he still doesn't
[19:59] understand
[20:01] Lord why why am I here
[20:04] why did you choose me Lord
[20:06] how many of you asked God that
[20:08] why did you choose me Lord
[20:10] but yet then all of a sudden his family
[20:12] comes they've experienced the famine and
[20:14] they come and and Joseph is there and
[20:17] he's able to bring Salvation to his
[20:19] family you're able to bring Salvation to
[20:22] your family if you're feeding on the
[20:24] grains of God then you're able to give
[20:26] that to your family you're able to let
[20:28] them drink from you to eat from you
[20:30] you're able to give that out freely
[20:33] freely give as you freely receive amen
[20:38] and I'll just say this ahead of time
[20:39] you've been chosen
[20:42] for such a time as this
[20:44] you've been chosen to feed on this word
[20:47] in this hour in this age so that you can
[20:50] give it out to others
[20:52] you've been chosen for such a time as
[20:55] this
[20:58] Haman had no real power of his own
[21:01] the king is the only one with the power
[21:04] to give Haven Haman access to his people
[21:07] and and I and I and I just throw this
[21:09] out there call me crazy I don't mean to
[21:11] go out on a limb I'm not trying to start
[21:13] Doctrine but to me as I was going
[21:15] through this one morning I I a thought
[21:17] was triggered and I went and I looked in
[21:19] the third seal and I thought oh my
[21:20] goodness I think the seals are an Esther
[21:23] call me crazy that's all right
[21:25] let me just believe that anyway would
[21:27] you
[21:30] Haman had no real power of his own Haman
[21:33] could look like the king
[21:36] and get the people to bow to him
[21:38] but he wasn't the king
[21:41] he wasn't the king listen to me now
[21:44] Satan can get you to act on Temptation
[21:47] Satan can get you to do things in your
[21:51] life that he's tempted you to do that
[21:52] he's placed before you but that's but
[21:55] but that's as far as it goes that's not
[21:58] your identity
[22:01] he's not the king of your heart
[22:05] Revelation says a voice cries hurt not
[22:08] the oil and the wine and we talked about
[22:09] the wine there and The King The King has
[22:11] complete control over who gets wine and
[22:13] how much they get
[22:15] and
[22:16] there's there's a revelation Esther has
[22:19] to catch of her purpose Revelation has
[22:21] to come through the Holy Spirit we know
[22:23] that Christ is the only one who gives it
[22:25] but once Esther catches that revelation
[22:29] that she was placed in the palace
[22:31] possibly
[22:33] for such a time as they were going
[22:35] through to to go before the king and
[22:37] bring Salvation to her people when
[22:39] Esther catches that I want you to catch
[22:41] this for your own life she holds more
[22:44] power than what even Haman thought she
[22:46] had
[22:48] Haman thought she he had more power than
[22:51] the queen he was he was at the right
[22:54] hand of God
[22:55] he was at the right hand of God and yet
[22:58] he was cast out and the queen always had
[23:01] even back when Lucifer was there with
[23:04] God you were in God's mind and you had
[23:07] more power than Satan would ever have
[23:09] even if he stayed at the right hand of
[23:12] God you would have been placed between
[23:14] between Satan and God you would have
[23:16] been set right there next to the king
[23:19] God would have said Satan scoot over My
[23:21] bride is sitting next to me
[23:23] but now he's cast out of heaven so he
[23:26] has no hold he has no say
[23:29] he can just go to and fro like a like a
[23:31] lion with no teeth seeking whom he may
[23:33] devour but he can't touch you unless he
[23:35] comes to God first but when you catch
[23:38] the revelation of who you are in Jesus
[23:40] Christ you hold more power listen to me
[23:43] this is what came to me and study Satan
[23:46] I think will be surprised at how much
[23:48] power you hold
[23:50] you'll do things to disrupt the Gates of
[23:54] Hell you'll do things to disrupt the
[23:57] enemy's Kingdom and he'll say I didn't
[24:00] realize they had that power
[24:02] what where is this coming from why is
[24:05] this people doing this to me what this
[24:09] God I had your plan figured out what is
[24:11] this
[24:12] what is this God can I have an audience
[24:15] with you because I don't understand what
[24:16] just happened
[24:18] what did they just do what did Jason
[24:21] just do to my kingdom
[24:23] how did how did Jason just pick up that
[24:26] gate and and carry it off I thought I
[24:29] had him
[24:31] Satan thought he had you
[24:34] but you picked up the gate and you
[24:36] started walking
[24:38] and Satan said what is going on right
[24:41] now
[24:42] how does he do in this
[24:44] he don't even have locks
[24:47] he's got a nice beard though
[24:52] and God just says Satan
[24:54] you haven't seen nothing yet
[24:57] you haven't seen nothing yet
[25:00] Esther had to choose to go before the
[25:03] King after not feeling his presence for
[25:05] 30 days
[25:07] think about that how many times
[25:11] have you gone in a dry spell
[25:14] how many times have you been in a season
[25:16] that feels like a spiritual desert
[25:19] and and you go and you go you you come
[25:22] before God
[25:24] and you come up maybe you come up to the
[25:26] Altar and you bow down at the altar and
[25:28] you're just thinking Lord I don't I
[25:29] don't know why I'm here right now
[25:31] I don't feel you I can see I can look
[25:34] around and look at look at the people
[25:36] look at the ones who are rejoicing But
[25:39] Here I Am Lord I don't I'm I'm kneeling
[25:42] before you I just want you to speak to
[25:44] me I I want to feel just a little bit of
[25:46] what they feel
[25:47] I don't feel nothing right now Lord I I
[25:50] lift my hands and yet there's just
[25:52] there's nothing Lord what where are you
[25:55] sometimes you cry out Lord where are you
[25:58] God knows where you are
[26:00] and he's there the whole time
[26:02] but maybe he wants to just step back a
[26:05] little bit just to see what what are you
[26:07] are you just here for the feeling of me
[26:11] or are you here for me
[26:13] are you just here for the blessing of me
[26:15] or do you want me I want you to walk God
[26:18] wants you to want him
[26:20] God says I want you to want me I I don't
[26:22] listen the gifts are great
[26:25] the the the shouting is great the
[26:27] presence is great but what if what if
[26:29] what if all that went away
[26:31] I just want you to want me
[26:34] and that's what we that's what we that's
[26:36] what Esther had to make a decision
[26:37] that's what we have to make a decision
[26:39] when you don't feel the presence of God
[26:41] keep presenting yourself before God
[26:44] I'm here Lord to present myself to you
[26:48] Lord restore to me the joy of thy
[26:50] salvation
[26:52] father reveal to me the secret of your
[26:55] heart
[26:56] that's what it is that's listen when you
[26:58] when you grow in the lord it's not about
[27:00] his presence as much as we we want his
[27:03] presence don't get me wrong but it's
[27:05] about his heart Lord reveal I want to
[27:07] feel your presence but that does me no
[27:09] good if I don't understand your heart
[27:12] revealed to me the secret of your heart
[27:15] and Esther is realizing she's presented
[27:18] with this this this situation this
[27:21] urgency
[27:22] an urgent matter Lord I need to come
[27:25] before your throne I need to know that
[27:28] I'm touching the Throne of God right now
[27:30] I need to know father that I have your
[27:33] ear I need to know that I have your
[27:35] heart
[27:36] and I need to know that you have mine
[27:39] father I'm coming one more time but it
[27:42] was 30 days 21 days Daniel Prayed
[27:46] and he thought God where are you Lord
[27:49] do you hear my prayer how many of you
[27:51] have prayed that I have that's all right
[27:53] I have
[27:55] Lord do you even hear my prayer right
[27:57] now I I it just it feels like it just
[28:00] it it's just there goes my prayer
[28:05] I want it to go this way but it's just
[28:07] it's just falling empty and Lord I just
[28:09] I don't but yet Esther had to had to
[28:12] hold on to the promise
[28:14] that there's a threat of Grace
[28:16] there's a threat of Grace left for me
[28:23] we don't feel his inspiration sometimes
[28:26] we don't feel we don't feel we don't
[28:28] feel
[28:30] but where did God say in the word go off
[28:33] of your feelings
[28:36] but the King was available the entire
[28:39] time
[28:40] your king knows your voice
[28:44] he hears your prayer and the moment you
[28:47] speak him
[28:48] and and you know when we're in the
[28:50] depths of Despair we don't think of
[28:51] these things
[28:53] but what did the angel say to Daniel
[28:55] when he got to him he said I heard your
[28:57] prayer the first time
[29:00] and I work I fought my way to you but I
[29:03] got held up
[29:04] but then your Prince Michael came
[29:08] and then I got through to you
[29:10] so when you listen oh my goodness when
[29:12] you feel like your prayer is is Fallen
[29:15] flat keep praying
[29:17] because all's that mean is that in the
[29:19] other dimension that you can't see that
[29:22] your Prince Michael is fighting to get
[29:24] to you and he might be experiencing
[29:26] resistance but guess what that
[29:28] resistance can only last so long because
[29:30] there's an appointed day and appointed
[29:33] time when your prayer is going to be
[29:34] answered when you'll see the
[29:35] manifestation of that prayer you're
[29:38] praying for a loved one that's lost
[29:39] you're praying for for your marriage
[29:41] you're praying for this situation you're
[29:43] praying for a job and you're you're
[29:45] praying and you're praying and you're
[29:46] praying but there's going to be one day
[29:48] when you see the manifestation of that
[29:50] prayer and that's just God fighting his
[29:53] way to you
[29:55] God fighting his way to you that's Jesus
[29:57] Christ himself fighting his way to you
[30:02] are you with me this morning
[30:09] the king sees you all the time
[30:12] you can't hide from God
[30:15] you choose to sin you can't hide from
[30:18] God
[30:19] you choose to give to Temptation you
[30:21] can't hide from God
[30:23] Adam and Eve could not hide from God
[30:25] we've heard it many times and I you you
[30:28] know this like the back of your hand but
[30:30] I'm going to remind you of it because
[30:31] you might be in the depths of
[30:33] discouragement this morning but but by
[30:35] the preaching of the word the cloud can
[30:37] be lifted away and you can see the what
[30:40] you already know
[30:42] but God come down in the garden and he's
[30:45] Adam Adam where are you Adam where are
[30:48] you God knew exactly where they were
[30:50] I don't you you think out of however big
[30:52] this Garden was God could have went down
[30:54] this path but he starts walking this way
[30:56] because Adam's over behind the bushes
[30:58] and he could have went off in this path
[31:00] at the deer trod but he kept walking
[31:02] this way Adam Adam where are you and he
[31:05] could have went this way and he could
[31:06] have went that way but he kept walking
[31:07] because he knew where Adam was the whole
[31:09] time
[31:12] amen
[31:16] Esther was chosen to be his Queen
[31:18] and 30 days did not change that
[31:22] no matter what you feel about yourself
[31:24] this morning no matter how long it's
[31:27] been since you've felt the presence of
[31:29] God that doesn't change the fact that
[31:32] you've been called to be his Queen
[31:35] you are who you are and that doesn't
[31:37] change
[31:39] not in the economy of God
[31:42] Haman had the law
[31:44] Haman had the law but Esther had the
[31:48] king's heart
[31:51] we transitioned from law by Moses to
[31:54] Grace through Jesus Christ
[31:57] that's why those people might not have
[31:58] even known what they were saying but
[32:00] Hosanna hosanna in the highest Hosanna
[32:03] the King has come the King has come
[32:06] they didn't maybe didn't even understand
[32:08] what they were going through but now we
[32:10] do today we we've we've we've known it
[32:13] we've felt it we feel that we we not all
[32:17] the time but we we know he saved us by
[32:20] Revelation by the stimulation of his
[32:22] wine we know that and so we can say I
[32:25] have his heart they have the law but I
[32:28] have his heart
[32:30] Esther became an invincible Army
[32:33] she became God's letter of Grace to his
[32:35] people
[32:37] Esther was the voice crying out the
[32:40] spirit and the bride say come but we
[32:42] know a spirit can't can't talk unless it
[32:45] has a voice to work through so the bride
[32:48] became the voice to come
[32:50] come she was the voice that was crying
[32:53] out she was the voice crying out
[32:56] salvation
[32:57] that's why you can impart salvation to
[33:00] others it's because not by your works
[33:02] but you can you can bring them to Christ
[33:04] because you've been that that is lying
[33:07] within you that power is lying within
[33:09] you
[33:12] Esther's Banquets last thing on that
[33:14] point on the wine Esther's Banquets were
[33:16] called the Banquets of wine
[33:18] when we come together we should be
[33:20] expecting revelation
[33:22] we should be expecting what we have need
[33:25] of
[33:26] we come together for revelation
[33:28] Esther needed to approach the king but
[33:31] there was a law in place that she could
[33:33] be killed if she went to him
[33:35] God's law was that he's too holy for
[33:38] anyone to approach
[33:39] so I want to take you back just for a
[33:41] moment and bring this up to speed here
[33:44] are you with me this morning
[33:48] God's law was that he's too holy for
[33:51] anyone to approach unless he bid come
[33:53] and he bid Moses come
[33:56] you can go read it in the Old Testament
[33:57] it was death if you touched that
[34:00] mountain
[34:01] God said don't let not even a hoof Touch
[34:04] This Mountain it or it'll have to die
[34:07] Moses said Lord I want to see you God
[34:10] said no man can see me and live
[34:13] so you have all these things that God
[34:15] was so holy and there was no way to to
[34:18] commune with his people there was no way
[34:20] they could approach him because it was
[34:21] death
[34:23] when when uh when when the Tabernacle
[34:27] was set up there was only one man who
[34:29] could enter into the holiest of holies
[34:31] where God was
[34:33] and even then he had to do it just right
[34:35] or it was death
[34:37] so you see this law of of the Persians
[34:40] was only inspired by the law of God
[34:43] right you can't approach God that that
[34:46] was what was there
[34:47] but I want you to show I want to show
[34:49] you a threat of Grace this morning I
[34:51] want to show you if we're typing us as
[34:54] Esther now that you have an audience
[34:57] before the king you have an open door we
[34:59] know that Jesus rent The Veil and when
[35:01] he rent The Veil that was that any man
[35:04] could come into the holiest of holies
[35:06] any man could experience that but watch
[35:08] this now Genesis 49 10 the scepter shall
[35:12] not depart from Judah
[35:14] remember the king had to hold out a
[35:16] scepter and if he held out a scepter
[35:18] they could touch it and then they could
[35:20] approach the king but this is God's law
[35:22] was there but watch how he transitions
[35:24] because he wants to he wants you as his
[35:27] Queen to come to him all the time
[35:29] any time
[35:31] the scepter shall not depart from Judah
[35:34] he's the lion of the tribe of Judah nor
[35:37] a lawgiver from between his feet until
[35:39] Shiloh which is Christ come and unto him
[35:42] shall the Gathering of the people be
[35:44] numbers 24 17 just picking it up there
[35:48] shall come a star out of Jacob and a
[35:51] scepter shall rise out of Israel
[35:53] Psalms 45 6 thy Throne o God is forever
[35:57] and ever the scepter of thy kingdom as a
[36:00] right scepter you have a scepter that's
[36:03] held out to you all the time
[36:06] Hebrews 1 8 but unto the son he saith
[36:09] thy Throne o God is forever and ever a
[36:12] scepter of righteousness is the scepter
[36:15] of thy kingdom oh friends you have a
[36:18] scepter held out to you you you you can
[36:20] approach the king anytime
[36:23] There Is No Death for you any longer you
[36:26] you you can't you won't die coming to
[36:29] The King The King he separated that he
[36:31] said no I don't want them to die but
[36:34] God's law can only be changed listen the
[36:37] the in the Persian Empire the king's law
[36:39] could only be changed by another law
[36:42] It could only be changed by another law
[36:44] so this law is lying there that nobody
[36:47] can see me I am God nobody can approach
[36:50] me but then he says you know what I'm
[36:52] going to write another law over here
[36:54] that my son Jesus Christ will come down
[36:57] he'll be the scepter that the people can
[37:00] touch
[37:01] they can touch and they can come before
[37:03] my throne with whatever their petition
[37:05] be
[37:06] my queen I'll give you half the kingdom
[37:09] all you have to do is approach me I want
[37:12] you to to approach me
[37:14] and so God set that other law in order
[37:17] so that we could have free access to him
[37:21] whatever Esther thought about herself
[37:23] she had to lay down
[37:26] she had to lay it down any fear of death
[37:31] she had to hold on to the threat of
[37:33] Grace that the king could hold out his
[37:35] scepter to her
[37:37] there's been a scepter risen up from the
[37:39] Throne of God that says whosoever will
[37:41] let him come
[37:43] so
[37:44] I'm going to boldly say to you this
[37:46] morning
[37:47] it doesn't matter what your past is it
[37:50] doesn't matter what your present is it
[37:53] doesn't matter what you've done what you
[37:55] did last night doesn't matter what
[37:57] you'll go home and do today
[38:00] you have a scepter held out to you you
[38:03] are the queen you have to lay hold of
[38:06] that threat of Grace and accept it and
[38:09] come to the father's throne
[38:11] come to your king this morning Esther 5
[38:15] verse 1.
[38:19] I know everyone's probably wondering why
[38:20] does he have Sharpies I'll get to that
[38:22] in just a moment
[38:24] Esther 5 verse 1. now it came to pass on
[38:28] the third day that Esther put on her
[38:30] royal apparel
[38:31] and stood in the inner core of the
[38:33] King's house over against the King's
[38:35] house and the King sat upon his Royal
[38:38] throne in the Royal house over against
[38:40] the Gate of the house
[38:42] so
[38:43] Esther's made the decision
[38:45] all right I'm gonna do it
[38:48] I don't know what's going to happen
[38:51] but I'm gonna go before my king
[38:54] and she puts on her garment
[38:57] Esther had to put her Garment of Praise
[39:00] on
[39:01] from the lowest point in her life
[39:05] she turned to the king with praise
[39:08] you fell low this morning you're going
[39:11] through a dark time
[39:13] put on your Garment of Praise
[39:16] Beauty for Ashes
[39:18] a Garment of Praise for your heaviness
[39:21] put on your Garment of Praise and come
[39:23] before the king
[39:25] you say but I I just my hands are so
[39:28] heavy I don't know if I can lift them
[39:29] lift up holy hands
[39:32] there's a scripture and it kept coming
[39:34] to my mind and it escapes me now but
[39:36] lift lift up your hands you holy people
[39:39] praise your God
[39:41] praise him praise him in the highest
[39:43] praise him in the lowest
[39:45] when you're in your lowest lift your
[39:47] hands and praise him I I'm I'm this is
[39:50] just beautiful to me but when you go
[39:52] look at the armor of God they were the
[39:54] the in and Paul was writing about it he
[39:57] writes about the shield of faith that
[39:59] Shield of Faith was the size of a the
[40:01] door of your house and it was a hard
[40:03] wood it was a solid wood and so I can
[40:06] imagine That's Heavy enough in itself
[40:07] but then they would take six skins of an
[40:09] animal skins and they would wrap that
[40:12] shield with animal skin six of them so
[40:14] you can imagine I don't know how in the
[40:16] world they held this thing up but who
[40:18] cares how you held it up it was saving
[40:19] your life
[40:20] but the thing about this The Shield was
[40:23] and the thing about leather is it's
[40:25] porous and so in the winter time I hate
[40:27] winter here
[40:28] my hands dry out and and they'll start
[40:31] cracking and bleeding
[40:33] and so I have to I have to apply lotion
[40:35] and I know that sounds sissified but
[40:37] it's better than shaking your hand and
[40:39] getting blood all over you
[40:41] so you're when when leather gets dry
[40:43] it's like your hands and it'll dry out
[40:45] and it can crack it becomes brittle it
[40:48] becomes no good for protection you know
[40:51] you get your shoes
[40:52] um this is
[40:54] your shoes you need you know if you have
[40:57] real leather you need to condition them
[40:58] because that keeps it porous that keeps
[41:00] it that keeps it soft and subtle so that
[41:02] it won't split on you
[41:04] as you're less than leather this morning
[41:07] so what they had to do was they had to
[41:09] apply oil on their Shield every day
[41:12] you have to apply the Holy Spirit to
[41:14] your Shield
[41:16] that's what gives you Faith as the Holy
[41:18] Ghost you have to apply that every day
[41:20] but then when they were going into
[41:21] battle if the enemy was going to be
[41:24] shooting fiery darts they had to they
[41:26] had to baptize the shield and water
[41:29] they had to pour they had to soak this
[41:31] Shield because when leather gets wet
[41:32] it'll actually soak it up it soaks up
[41:35] the leather and and it becomes you you
[41:37] could wring it out but it'll hold it and
[41:40] so they had to they had to fill they had
[41:42] to just water the shield with praise the
[41:45] water of your worship
[41:47] to make yours to make your Shield that
[41:50] when the enemies fiery darts hit your
[41:52] Shield it's
[41:54] so the enemy when you're when you're
[41:56] praising your God and the enemy's firing
[41:59] fiery darts at you it's hitting your
[42:01] Shields
[42:03] I can't get past it I can't get through
[42:06] their Shield they're praising the Lord
[42:08] how is this possible I've thrown
[42:10] everything I can at them and they're
[42:12] still praising the Lord and it's just
[42:14] it's quenching the fiery darts of the
[42:16] enemy so water water the Lord with your
[42:19] praise keep your Shield keep it keep the
[42:22] anointing of the Holy Spirit on it stay
[42:24] in the spirit and water it with your
[42:26] praise amen
[42:30] where am I
[42:35] Esther 5 chapter 2.
[42:39] and it was so when the king saw Esther
[42:42] the queen standing in the court

[42:47] this is the best love story
[42:50] that's right brother Mike hug her and
[42:52] close to you this is beautiful
[42:55] when the king saw Esther the queen
[42:57] standing in the court that she obtained
[42:59] favor in his sight
[43:01] and the King held out to Esther the
[43:03] golden scepter
[43:05] that was in his hands so Esther Drew
[43:07] near and touched the top of the scepter
[43:10] you see the king the scepter is there we
[43:13] just heard in the scripture that the
[43:14] scepter is there it's always there it's
[43:17] always reaching out but you have to come
[43:19] touch it
[43:20] you have to approach it
[43:24] then said the king unto her What wilt

[43:31] despite what Esther felt about herself
[43:33] despite all the fear she had I'm gonna
[43:36] tell you something beautiful in a moment
[43:38] despite all of that she obtained favor
[43:41] not did the king didn't just only say
[43:44] come come unto me he didn't only just
[43:46] hold the scepter out he didn't only just
[43:49] drive the scepter in the ground of Jesus
[43:51] Christ stick it on a cross so that it's
[43:53] always there
[43:55] the scepter is Always There Before the

[46:03] do you need the joy of your salvation
[46:05] restored
[46:07] my queen just asked me
[46:10] ask me my queen do you hear him talk I I
[46:12] prayed just take my annoying voice out
[46:14] of it this morning
[46:16] do you hear the do you hear the sound of
[46:18] the king's voice my queen asked me this
[46:21] morning
[46:22] whatever you have need of ask me
[46:24] this takes it to a little bit deeper
[46:27] level to me
[46:28] and I don't know I'll be honest I don't
[46:30] know if this is true
[46:32] but they say that in history
[46:35] that the queen was so nervous
[46:39] and she was so anxious
[46:42] that the King was sitting on his throne
[46:47] and
[46:49] I guess he'd be up here
[46:53] and he was sitting on his throne
[46:55] and maybe he was he was doing his
[46:57] business for the day
[46:59] and there was some situation in front of
[47:01] him and he was looking Stern on it
[47:04] and he said he noticed out of the corner
[47:07] of his eye someone standing there and so
[47:09] he had the look of Fury in his eyes
[47:11] and he looked over at her and when he
[47:13] saw Esther and she saw the anger in the
[47:15] king's eyes She fainted
[47:18] and when the king saw her faint in fear
[47:21] he leapt out of his chair and he ran to
[47:23] Esther
[47:24] and he picked her up in his arms and he
[47:27] started comforting her with sweet words
[47:31] he started comforting Esther with words
[47:33] of of
[47:35] my queen what is
[47:37] what is this
[47:39] what it why why have you fainted
[47:41] why why have you grown weary My Queen
[47:45] what is it that's that's got your heart
[47:47] troubled
[47:48] why are you growing weary and well doing
[47:52] what is it my queen
[47:54] what don't don't be afraid
[47:57] how many God every time he came to
[47:59] somebody it is I fear not
[48:04] do you hear his voice this morning
[48:06] it is I
[48:08] fear not
[48:10] ask what you would
[48:11] and I'll give you I'll give you half of
[48:13] the Kingdom
[48:16] it makes me think of the story and again
[48:18] I I don't know if this is
[48:21] if this is true but this is it made a
[48:24] lot of sense
[48:26] when the prodigal son left home
[48:28] and he came back I've always pictured it
[48:31] in this Farm
[48:32] like you know Farmland in Ohio I mean
[48:35] hopefully it had more Rolling Hills
[48:37] there but
[48:39] you know it's it's just a lot of acreage
[48:41] and there's one house up on you know the
[48:43] path you know you follow the path up to
[48:45] the house and and that was what the sun
[48:48] had to walk down was this path
[48:50] but I heard recently and again I don't
[48:53] know if it's true so I'm not starting
[48:54] Doctrine or anything but it's just it
[48:56] makes the story more beautiful for me
[49:00] in in
[49:02] we're you know in the in that time it
[49:05] was it was villages
[49:07] and so the village that the father lived
[49:10] in would have had other houses leading
[49:13] up to it
[49:15] and so to come into town
[49:17] the sun when he made that decision to
[49:19] come to the father
[49:21] he would have had to come to the road
[49:23] that entered into the village
[49:26] and he would have it wasn't just an open
[49:28] road with nobody there
[49:29] he would have had to walk past the
[49:32] village
[49:33] and when that when that father got word
[49:37] so word had to spread jump from house to
[49:39] house your son's coming your suds your
[49:41] son's coming
[49:43] that young man would have had to walk
[49:45] through the village past every wandering
[49:47] eye knowing what he had done
[49:50] but when he showed up at the start of
[49:53] the village and word hit the father it
[49:55] says when the father saw him afar off
[49:57] the father took off running through the
[50:00] village
[50:01] past every eye that wanted to see he
[50:03] didn't care he ran to his son and he put
[50:06] his arm around his son and then they
[50:08] walked through the village back home
[50:11] arm and arm
[50:14] that's what our father does to us
[50:17] don't don't worry this morning about
[50:20] who's watching
[50:21] your father is running to you this
[50:24] morning taking you in his arms
[50:27] and he's saying Come On Son
[50:29] come home
[50:31] come with me let me let me love you
[50:34] Let Me Love You
[50:37] amen
[50:46] whatever was going on at that moment
[50:48] Esther came into view the king stopped
[50:51] to run to her
[50:55] could you imagine what if it was word
[50:57] that the enemy had Advanced on the
[50:59] kingdom
[51:01] and they were starting to attack over in
[51:03] the far Village
[51:04] when the king saw Esther that business
[51:06] stopped and he ran to Esther
[51:12] maybe Haman was complaining about her
[51:15] and her people
[51:16] maybe Haman was there laying his
[51:18] accusations again before the king
[51:21] Haman could have accusing her people but
[51:24] the king hushed everyone
[51:26] because his bride had just walked into
[51:28] the room
[51:30] he gave his full attention to Esther
[51:34] oh my
[51:40] Haman had become a powerful adversary
[51:44] Esther felt she couldn't go to the king
[51:46] because Haman had put her in a place of
[51:49] death
[51:50] but Esther had to be reminded she was
[51:53] the queen nobody was between her and the
[51:55] key
[51:59] the the devil tries to get between us
[52:01] and our King sometimes through emotional
[52:03] discouragements
[52:05] and through disappointments in life
[52:08] through complexes
[52:10] through the busyness through sin that he
[52:14] himself presented
[52:17] and Satan tries to put that but the
[52:19] biggest block
[52:21] that he can do is put the lie that he's
[52:23] placed something between you and Christ
[52:25] because there is nothing that because it
[52:28] can become between you and Christ
[52:34] God is not out to embarrass you I've
[52:36] been thinking about this because I think
[52:38] many times we get afraid of God because
[52:40] we think what if I get embarrassed what
[52:42] if he God why would you ask me to do
[52:44] that it's embarrassing God's not out to
[52:46] embarrass you he's a gentleman
[52:50] he loves you
[52:52] you are his Queen all you have to do is
[52:54] move towards him and he'll run to you
[52:57] he'll run to you
[53:00] oh my
[53:03] I want to read to you a scripture that
[53:05] kind of became a theme early on in our
[53:07] Thursday night class
[53:09] overcoming sexual Temptation James 5 13.
[53:12] are you with me a little bit longer
[53:15] I don't think I got much more to go
[53:19] is any among you Afflicted let him pray
[53:23] is any Mary let him sing Psalms is any
[53:27] sick among you let him call for the
[53:29] Elders of the church and let them pray
[53:31] over him anointing him with oil in the
[53:33] name of the Lord and the prayer of faith
[53:36] shall save the sick and the Lord shall
[53:38] raise him up and if he committeth sins
[53:40] they shall be forgiven him
[53:44] hold on to that scripture if you have
[53:46] sin in your life hold to that scripture
[53:47] because if you've committed sin the
[53:49] scripture says you shall be forgiven
[53:53] and notice it's all in this this realm
[53:56] of prayer these scriptures of prayer
[53:58] it's it's encompassed in that to pray
[54:02] confess your faults one to another and
[54:05] pray one for another that ye may be
[54:07] healed the effectual fervent prayer of a
[54:09] righteous man availeth much Elias was a
[54:13] man subject to like passions as we are
[54:15] and he prayed earnestly that it might
[54:18] not rain
[54:19] and it rained not on the Earth by the
[54:22] space of three and a half years
[54:25] Elias was a man subject to the lust that
[54:29] you experience
[54:30] Elias was a man that was subject to the
[54:34] tiredness you experience Lord I'm just
[54:37] too tired to come to you today
[54:39] Elias was a man subject to everything
[54:42] you went through that you go through and
[54:45] yet he prayed and it wasn't just you
[54:48] know the rain is coming and so you know
[54:50] Lord I we just we got this please don't
[54:53] let it rain today
[54:55] he shut the heavens by his prayer for
[54:58] three and a half years
[54:59] but I love that the scripture doesn't
[55:01] just stop there
[55:03] it it goes on and it says
[55:06] and he prayed again
[55:09] he prayed again
[55:11] and the heaven gave rain and the Earth
[55:13] brought for forth her fruit it wasn't
[55:15] just I mean it was just enough to say
[55:18] wow he prayed and it shut the heavens
[55:21] it was three and a half years but then
[55:22] he prayed again and it brought the rain
[55:25] Brethren if any of you do air from the
[55:27] truth
[55:28] and one convert him let him know that he
[55:32] which converteth The Sinner from the air
[55:34] of his ways shall save a soul from death
[55:37] and shall hide a multitude of sin
[55:41] I'm trying to I want to get to you this
[55:43] morning I I I just want to be a voice
[55:46] crying out to you to con to convert you
[55:49] if you've aired get back
[55:52] it's just as easy as as stepping back
[55:55] out of the prayer line father forgive me
[55:57] okay you're back in come on let's go
[56:00] it's that easy it's that simple all you
[56:04] have to do is ask all you have to do is
[56:06] pray
[56:09] that word convert means to get him to
[56:12] repent and turn back to the love of
[56:13] Christ
[56:15] turn back to the love of Christ maybe
[56:17] you need the love of Christ in your
[56:18] heart but maybe you just need to come
[56:20] back to realize that he loves you come
[56:23] back to the love of Christ this morning
[56:24] every attempt to destroy and accuse
[56:27] God's people to the king that Haman
[56:29] tried backfired on him and the King's
[56:31] Queen and God's people were exalted
[56:34] so often we fear the devil We Fear
[56:37] sickness we feel we fear harm We Fear
[56:41] falling to his devices
[56:43] but you've been given power over the
[56:45] enemy you've been given access to the
[56:48] King's throne
[56:51] now
[56:55] uh Esther seven and and I'm I'm winding
[56:58] down can you stay with me just a few
[56:59] more minutes
[57:02] Esther seven perfect sister Genie
[57:05] and on the second day as they were
[57:08] drinking wine after the feast the King
[57:10] again said to Esther what is your wish
[57:12] so listen this isn't just a one-time
[57:15] thing God says my queen what's your wish
[57:18] here he is again
[57:19] what is your wish Queen Esther it shall
[57:22] be granted you and what is your request
[57:25] even to half of the kingdom it shall be
[57:27] fulfilled
[57:28] then Queen Esther answered if I have
[57:31] found favor in your sight O King and if
[57:34] it pleased the king let my life be
[57:37] granted me for my wish and my people for
[57:39] my request
[57:41] for we have been told sold I and my
[57:44] people to be destroyed to be killed and
[57:46] to be annihilated
[57:48] show that next that next screen sister
[57:50] Jeannie is that my picture
[57:53] so this is from The Sight and Sounds
[57:55] Queen Esther and and I just told you
[57:57] this is what started it for me down this
[57:59] this road but this is just a beautiful
[58:01] depiction there's the king they're at
[58:03] the Feast of wine there's Haman that she
[58:06] invited and here's Esther trying to make
[58:08] her petition known before the king
[58:11] I just I love this image because you can
[58:13] she's she's in distress she's she's
[58:15] she's got her enemy in front of the king
[58:19] with her
[58:21] she invited her enemy into the presence
[58:23] of the king now I know you've heard this
[58:26] before it's been preached many times a
[58:28] lot more eloquent than I can say it but
[58:30] when the enemy's bothering you bring him
[58:33] into your atmosphere don't go into his
[58:36] bring him into your atmosphere bring him
[58:38] before the king because watch this is
[58:40] what happens go to the next slide
[58:42] and the King arose in his Wrath
[58:45] from the wine drinking
[58:47] oh wait a minute I think I missed one
[58:49] sister genius you can stay right there
[58:58] I must have missed a part
[59:00] let's see if we had been sold merely as
[59:04] slaves men and women I would have been
[59:06] silent for our Affliction she's saying
[59:08] is not to be compared with the loss to
[59:11] the king if I die this is a great loss
[59:14] to the king
[59:15] then King Azar said to Queen Esther who
[59:19] is he
[59:21] I mean just the king just becomes
[59:23] unglued Esther says Ah listen it's it's
[59:26] this is no small request if I wouldn't
[59:28] have come to you if I was just going to
[59:30] be a slave I wouldn't have come to you
[59:32] but this is this is spiritual death for
[59:34] me I need you Lord
[59:36] I need you right now and the King just
[59:39] gets Furious
[59:45] sorry I think I forgot to put this up
[59:46] there
[59:47] just who is he
[59:50] who is he
[59:51] and where is he
[59:53] and Who Dares do this to my queen
[59:57] and Esther said a foe an enemy this
[1:00:00] wicked Haman
[1:00:01] then Haman was terrified before the king
[1:00:05] and queen see we fear the devil
[1:00:07] we fear we fear demons We Fear what what
[1:00:11] Satan can do to us we fear what we're
[1:00:13] going through but when you bring Satan
[1:00:17] into the presence of your king
[1:00:20] and you say my king this is no light
[1:00:23] request I'm making it's I this is
[1:00:26] spiritual death if I if you don't help
[1:00:28] me and he says where is he
[1:00:31] where is he
[1:00:33] who's defiling my queen who's bothering
[1:00:36] my queen
[1:00:37] and then Satan's over there and he's
[1:00:40] getting nervous oh no what's this what's
[1:00:42] now what's going to happen no no it's I
[1:00:45] didn't I didn't realize this is this is
[1:00:47] the queen I didn't realize she had this
[1:00:49] much power and now the king's mad I what
[1:00:53] do I do
[1:00:55] and the King arose in his wrath from the
[1:00:58] wine drinking he was so angry
[1:01:00] he left the banquet of wine
[1:01:03] and went into the palace Garden but
[1:01:05] Haman stayed to beg for his life from
[1:01:07] Queen Esther for he saw that harm was
[1:01:10] determined against him by the king
[1:01:13] the harm he was trying to bring on
[1:01:15] Esther got flipped around and now he's
[1:01:18] scared because he realizes I have an end
[1:01:22] This Is the End
[1:01:23] listen you've heard it many times but
[1:01:26] I'm reminding you this morning remind
[1:01:28] Satan of his end
[1:01:30] remind him of his end this is why he
[1:01:32] hates you this is why he despises you
[1:01:35] because your end is more glorious than
[1:01:37] his end
[1:01:41] but watch this now so he's he's fearful
[1:01:45] so the king leaves
[1:01:49] and then all this is going on and then
[1:01:52] Haman Esther's they call it a couch I
[1:01:55] guess it's like one of them fainting
[1:01:57] couches I don't know they call it a
[1:01:58] couch bed it's it's
[1:01:59] whichever one it is regardless of what
[1:02:02] it is
[1:02:03] Haman falls on the couch where Esther
[1:02:06] was and he's begging her don't let this
[1:02:09] happen to me and the King returned from
[1:02:12] the palace Garden to the place where
[1:02:13] they were drinking wine as Haman was
[1:02:15] falling under the couch with Esther
[1:02:19] and the King said will he even assault
[1:02:22] the queen in my presence
[1:02:24] are you kidding me right now
[1:02:27] it's not you're not just gonna go and
[1:02:30] and try to take my queen from me when
[1:02:33] I'm when you think I'm not looking
[1:02:35] but now you're gonna do it in my
[1:02:37] presence
[1:02:39] are you joking
[1:02:43] in my own house
[1:02:46] as the word left the mouth of the king
[1:02:48] they covered haman's face they're
[1:02:51] already jumping all over it hey we know
[1:02:53] what's going to happen let's get this
[1:02:54] guy
[1:02:56] so they hang Haman on The Gallows that
[1:02:58] he had prepared for Mordecai the very
[1:03:01] thing the very trap that Satan has set
[1:03:04] for you God says go hang him on it
[1:03:08] I'm gonna throw you in a pit that you're
[1:03:10] not gonna enjoy not gonna be no bubble
[1:03:13] bath
[1:03:14] then the Wrath of the King was pacified
[1:03:17] so you can imagine
[1:03:19] just just pull back the curtain of
[1:03:22] Heaven
[1:03:23] and God is getting furious as time goes
[1:03:27] on
[1:03:27] God's getting furious at Satan why are
[1:03:31] you defiling my people so much
[1:03:35] this has got to stop and he's just
[1:03:39] you know put on my armor just Mountain
[1:03:42] up his armor he's going to battle now
[1:03:45] and there's going to be a day he says
[1:03:47] enough
[1:03:50] and then your enemy
[1:03:52] the accuser of the brethren will be cast
[1:03:55] into the pit
[1:03:57] oh glorious day amen
[1:04:03] amen
[1:04:05] you can stand to your feet because I
[1:04:07] feel like we just need to
[1:04:10] Rejoice there
[1:04:16] I mean there's there's just so many
[1:04:18] beautiful things in this but I want to
[1:04:20] so
[1:04:22] the Jews celebrate
[1:04:24] in Purim
[1:04:26] this I think it's pronounced
[1:04:29] I can't remember how it's pronounced but
[1:04:31] anyway
[1:04:32] Purim I think it's pronounced Purim
[1:04:35] to celebrate the saving of the Jews in
[1:04:38] Esther's time
[1:04:40] I'm going to put a Sharpie up here
[1:04:42] you're welcome to it you don't have to
[1:04:44] go home and do it if you want to
[1:04:47] but
[1:04:48] during
[1:04:50] Purim
[1:04:52] they read the story of Esther
[1:04:54] now it's Jewish accustomed that you
[1:04:56] can't interrupt the the rabbi as he's
[1:05:00] reading
[1:05:01] so they wait until the word Haman is
[1:05:03] said in the story of Esther
[1:05:05] and when Haman is expressed they start
[1:05:08] booing Boo and they got these you know
[1:05:10] the noise makers it's almost like our
[1:05:12] fourth of July I mean that maybe they
[1:05:14] you know set off fireworks if they could
[1:05:16] in the synagogue and they'll and they'll
[1:05:18] start stamping their feet
[1:05:20] and the significance behind this is
[1:05:23] they an old old Jewish custom they would
[1:05:26] write haman's name on stones or on wood
[1:05:30] and when the story of of Esther was was
[1:05:32] read aloud
[1:05:34] when Haman was named you know his his
[1:05:36] name was said they would take these
[1:05:38] stones and they would start slamming
[1:05:39] them together
[1:05:40] or whatever they wrote his name on they
[1:05:42] would slam it together
[1:05:44] and what they would do is by the end of
[1:05:46] the story heyman's name would be erased
[1:05:50] from whatever they wrote him on
[1:05:52] so the significance of stamping their
[1:05:55] feet was because your heel is the least
[1:05:58] sensitive part of your body
[1:06:00] sometimes it hurts if you step on
[1:06:02] something with your heel but
[1:06:04] it's the least sensitive part
[1:06:07] the heel is also
[1:06:09] typed or or linked with
[1:06:13] amalek
[1:06:14] the flesh
[1:06:16] so when they start stamping their feet
[1:06:18] they're stomping out the flesh
[1:06:21] so if you have something in your life
[1:06:22] this morning that you want to take
[1:06:25] before your king
[1:06:26] and you want to stamp it out in your
[1:06:29] life you're welcome to come up here and
[1:06:31] take a sharpie write it on the bottom of
[1:06:33] your shoe
[1:06:34] because every time you walk you're going
[1:06:37] to be walking with that devil under your
[1:06:39] feet
[1:06:40] don't just make that like some you know
[1:06:42] fancy ritual I'm trying to make
[1:06:44] but let it be something from your heart
[1:06:47] that you want to write that you don't
[1:06:49] have to do it don't nobody if nobody
[1:06:50] comes up takes a Sharpie I'm not
[1:06:51] offended
[1:06:52] well go home and write it on there and
[1:06:55] then when you walk and eventually as you
[1:06:58] walk what you wrote on the bottom of
[1:07:00] your shoe is going to be erased and it
[1:07:03] goes back to that scripture that amalek
[1:07:05] will be blotted out from under heaven
[1:07:08] amen
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:17] sister Jeannie put up that last quote I
[1:07:19] got
[1:07:23] speaking of Moses
[1:07:26] and he stayed just exactly with God's
[1:07:28] word because he sought God first
