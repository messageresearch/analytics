[0:00] 20 years ago i guess it was her and her
[0:02] children and grandchildren from liberia
[0:04] we took them to church about every
[0:06] sunday in our car they didn't have a
[0:07] vehicle and
[0:09] she passed away this morning sister mary
[0:11] and this is a picture of
[0:13] her and me i felt led to go last down
[0:17] last year down to charlotte and i'm so
[0:19] glad that i did i got to see her
[0:21] and express my appreciation for her
[0:23] being a part of a congregation
[0:25] and she has stayed faithful to the lord
[0:27] through the years
[0:29] i don't even know what age i know she's
[0:31] in her 80s and
[0:32] and so we're thankful for the people who
[0:34] had an influence on us
[0:36] and we had an influence on them and they
[0:38] were grateful some of you most of you
[0:40] probably weren't here when she was here
[0:41] but she's a great
[0:42] godly sister of god and we're losing
[0:45] some but
[0:46] we're thankful that we have faithful
[0:49] people to the work of the lord faithful
[0:52] to the message
[0:53] and we honor their memory can you say
[0:55] amen
[0:56] if your brother gary has passed on and
[0:58] the family has not let me know yet about
[1:00] the memorial service but we've asked if
[1:02] we could have a memorial service here
[1:03] for brother gary
[1:04] so they're still getting things in order
[1:06] and they have to bring his brother in
[1:07] from virginia
[1:08] they will let us know so if you're
[1:10] wondering about that we'll let you know
[1:11] should be here hopefully this month
[1:13] sometime we'll have a
[1:14] memorial service for him we thank god
[1:16] for these heroes of faith
[1:18] that has stood faithful to the word amen
[1:21] joshua chapter 11
[1:22] if you have your bibles open we'll read
[1:24] a section of scripture
[1:26] here my family and i will be away this
[1:28] week on
[1:29] vacation so we just if you have a need
[1:31] or something you're welcome to contact
[1:33] the brothers that are here brother
[1:35] brandon and any of the ministering
[1:37] brothers or deacons if you have a need
[1:39] joshua 11 and verse 16
[1:42] so joshua took all that land the hills
[1:46] and all the south country and all the
[1:48] land of goshen
[1:50] and the valley and the plain and the
[1:52] mountain of israel and the valley the
[1:53] same
[1:54] i pray that through this series removing
[1:58] what's between you and the promises i
[2:00] pray that you're taking
[2:01] more of your land i pray this testimony
[2:04] that you're taking more of your land
[2:07] even from the mount haleck that goeth up
[2:09] to syrah
[2:10] even unto baalgad in the valley of
[2:12] lebanon under mount hermon and all the
[2:14] kings he took and smote them and slew
[2:16] them
[2:17] joshua made war a long time with all
[2:19] those kings
[2:20] there was not a city that made peace
[2:22] with the children of israel saved the
[2:23] hittites
[2:24] the inhabitants of gideon all others
[2:26] they took in battle
[2:27] and this is the verse i want to speak
[2:29] about today a little bit for it was
[2:31] of the lord to harden their hearts
[2:34] how many knows in the scripture god's
[2:36] able to harden the enemy's heart
[2:38] i remember how many remember pharaoh's
[2:40] heart being hardened
[2:42] and god always has a purpose for that
[2:43] he's not doing just to play games with
[2:45] people's heart
[2:46] he has a purpose for it in this case it
[2:49] was the lore
[2:50] to harden hearts that they should come
[2:52] against israel
[2:54] in battle that he might destroy them
[2:56] utterly and that
[2:58] they might have no favor but that he
[3:01] might destroy them
[3:02] as the lord commanded moses the prophet
[3:06] whatever the prophet commanded
[3:08] and prophesied now some
[3:11] 50 years later 60 years later we're
[3:14] seeing the prophet's word being
[3:16] fulfilled in israel
[3:17] so whatever the prophet commanded here
[3:20] we have it fulfilled
[3:21] in them conquering and taking the land
[3:24] that god has given them
[3:26] heavenly father we ask you to bless your
[3:28] word we ask you father to
[3:30] just minister to our hearts we see that
[3:33] the songs this morning and the
[3:35] special song has just really moved us
[3:38] into
[3:38] a place that we could soften our hearts
[3:41] that your word could be planted in us
[3:43] lord that's what music is for that's
[3:45] what
[3:45] music was intended for and lord we see
[3:48] lord if there's any heart hearts in us
[3:50] that you would remove it
[3:51] that lord we would have an open welcome
[3:53] place
[3:54] that you could speak father and that
[3:57] you'd use this
[3:58] simple vessel and this gift you've given
[4:00] me to be able to feed the flock
[4:02] and be able to minister to those who are
[4:04] in need today we thank you lord for the
[4:06] hungry hearts
[4:08] we thank you for those who have gathered
[4:10] lord my prayers that you
[4:11] fill every one of these seats here every
[4:14] one of them
[4:15] with hungry hearts in this generation it
[4:17] would seem
[4:18] father that people don't want the word
[4:20] anymore and that people are too
[4:22] distracted by many other things
[4:24] and they're not interested in it but
[4:26] lord i believe you're going to prove
[4:28] the enemy wrong that there are hungry
[4:30] hearts that are going to come and hear
[4:32] your word
[4:33] and father there's a famine for the
[4:35] hearing of the word
[4:36] and so we're glad to have these that
[4:38] have gathered today
[4:39] and we just humbly pray that you will
[4:41] feed us and feed your flock
[4:43] bless the che mary chafe family today as
[4:46] they've lost their mom
[4:48] their grandmother be with them comfort
[4:51] their hearts
[4:52] i pray you'll lift them up lord and also
[4:54] i remember my brother
[4:56] john garrett that you will strengthen
[4:58] him lord and give him peace
[5:00] and father we just our hearts are with
[5:02] him today be near him

[5:22] us and it's good to have you guys god
[5:24] bless you from the charlotte area north
[5:25] carolina area
[5:27] amen i'm going to go through a move
[5:29] quite quickly in the first part of this
[5:31] this morning
[5:32] and go through a few more of these
[5:34] things and points that is coming in
[5:37] between you and the promises
[5:39] and then we'll come back to our opening
[5:41] scripture and end on that as
[5:43] we read our text then we'll come back to
[5:45] that opening scripture
[5:47] and speak on that a little bit but i
[5:48] want to move quite quickly through some
[5:50] more of these things we don't have to
[5:51] talk
[5:52] about them a lot but they're things that
[5:54] get in between you
[5:55] and the promises of god that should be a
[5:58] priority that anything that gets between
[6:00] us and god's promises
[6:02] should be removed if it's an enemy
[6:05] that's between you and taken all of your
[6:07] inheritance it should be removed
[6:09] and we have to submit ourselves to the
[6:11] lord for those things to be removed from
[6:14] our lives can you say amen
[6:16] and some of these that i'll bring up
[6:18] right away this morning
[6:20] will have a theme or will be related to
[6:23] the influence of other people there are
[6:25] other people in our lives
[6:26] how many has other people in your lives
[6:29] family
[6:30] associates you know bosses employees
[6:34] there are other people in our lives and
[6:38] as much as sometimes we would prefer
[6:40] maybe
[6:41] not to have other people in our lives
[6:44] we're always going to have
[6:45] other people in our lives and these some
[6:48] of these things
[6:49] especially the last point will be
[6:51] related to
[6:52] the influence of other people in our
[6:54] lives
[6:56] everybody here sitting here this morning
[6:59] and listening to the streaming
[7:01] everybody everybody here is under the
[7:04] influence
[7:05] of someone there's no human being not
[7:09] under the influence of somebody
[7:13] and some of you are under the influence
[7:15] of people
[7:17] you don't even know very well
[7:21] some of you are under the influence of
[7:23] people
[7:24] that you don't even know very well and
[7:26] you don't even know at all there's
[7:28] people that get under the influence of
[7:30] maybe a movie star or someone who
[7:32] dresses like you would like to dress
[7:33] you don't even know that person you
[7:36] don't even know their life
[7:39] teenagers quite doing that and i hate to
[7:40] say it but older ones who don't grow up
[7:43] they're under the influence of somebody
[7:45] that they don't even know
[7:47] they don't know how they live they don't
[7:49] know as well i heard a distant thing
[7:50] they were a christian but you don't know
[7:52] their lives
[7:52] and yet you're under the influence of
[7:54] them yet you're wearing what they wear
[7:56] and you're
[7:57] duplicating what they do and you're
[7:59] you're posting
[8:00] exactly how they are because you're
[8:02] under their influence
[8:04] but it's not just those it's everyone
[8:07] everybody
[8:08] is under somebody's influence
[8:11] and uh so that's a powerful thing that's
[8:13] a thing to talk about because
[8:16] other people's influence can get in
[8:18] between you and the promises of god
[8:22] another person's influence can get in
[8:24] between you
[8:25] and you may have been influenced by an
[8:27] uncle or an aunt or a grandfather or
[8:29] something years and years ago
[8:30] they might be gone now but there are
[8:32] people that are still under their
[8:34] influence
[8:34] even though they're gone and passed away
[8:37] the influence
[8:38] is a powerful powerful thing so let's be
[8:40] honest this morning
[8:42] everybody is under somebody's influence
[8:45] so now i want the first thing i wanted
[8:48] to mention to you today and this is
[8:49] number seven and all the
[8:50] things that can be getting between you
[8:52] and the promises number seven is that
[8:54] the wrong crowd
[8:55] if you're around the wrong crowd it can
[8:58] get in between you and the promises of
[9:00] god
[9:01] you're hanging with the wrong people
[9:04] you're hanging around
[9:05] the wrong people uh and and the
[9:08] the people that you keep company with
[9:10] the most
[9:12] will make you what you are will form
[9:14] your opinions
[9:16] will form your uh your impressions of
[9:19] things
[9:19] the people that you hang around with the
[9:22] most
[9:23] whether good or bad they're going to be
[9:25] an influence on you
[9:28] the people that you keep company with
[9:30] the most will make you what you are the
[9:32] people that you hang with
[9:34] i'm using that term hang with because
[9:36] that's the modern term from the young
[9:37] people
[9:38] who are you hanging with dad where are
[9:41] you going i'm going to
[9:42] hang out with my friends so this is this
[9:45] is what they call it
[9:46] well who you hang out with is is an
[9:49] influence
[9:50] and who you hang out with the most can
[9:52] be an influence in your life
[9:54] and it's pretty obvious for a christian
[9:56] if you hang around
[9:58] worldly people too much they will end up
[10:01] being an influence on you
[10:02] instead of you being an influence on
[10:04] them just simply because that's who you
[10:07] hang with most of the time
[10:08] uh so that's pretty obvious it's not a
[10:11] good thing to hang
[10:12] a lot amount of time with worldly people
[10:14] it might rub off on you we want to be a
[10:16] testimony we want to be a witness
[10:18] jesus encouraged that we be a witness to
[10:21] those and he himself
[10:22] bible says he was around sinners and
[10:25] different things but a lot of times
[10:26] they were coming to him it wasn't that
[10:28] he was necessarily going out to them
[10:30] but they were drawn to jesus and so he
[10:32] would hang out and share
[10:34] things with them so but we understand if
[10:36] you go out and get in their territory
[10:38] and you're spending a huge amount of
[10:40] time with people like that
[10:42] instead of the right crowd it's going to
[10:44] be an influence on you
[10:46] and it's going to keep you from the
[10:48] promises of god
[10:50] that's pretty simple isn't it so
[10:53] obviously we're
[10:54] worldly people but your job and your
[10:56] school
[10:57] and certain situations you have to be
[11:00] around
[11:01] uh people sometimes and it's not by your
[11:04] choice you don't choose to be around
[11:06] certain atmospheres at your job certain
[11:08] people
[11:09] you hang around that and it's not by
[11:11] choice and you're going to hear a lot of
[11:13] stuff you're going to hear
[11:14] a lot of cussing you're going to hear
[11:16] dirty jokes and there are some times
[11:18] that we don't have a choice we have to
[11:20] hear all that
[11:21] we can't say no i'm not going to go to
[11:23] work today because they're cussing too
[11:24] much
[11:25] we can't say that so there are some
[11:27] things we have a
[11:28] choice in the crowd that we're on there
[11:30] are some things that we don't have a
[11:32] choice
[11:33] we don't have a choice sometimes we do
[11:34] have a choice so i would just say to you
[11:37] that the things that we don't have a
[11:38] choice we can't get around that
[11:40] we have to bear and say lord help me to
[11:42] keep my spirit clean
[11:43] help me lord not to get these dirty
[11:46] words in my mind
[11:47] and these dirty stories that i'm hearing
[11:49] help me lord and
[11:50] just sanctify me keep me clean by the
[11:52] word of god we don't because i don't
[11:54] have a choice in this
[11:55] but most of the time we have a choice
[11:59] in who we're hanging around and so if i
[12:02] have that choice still
[12:04] i want to make a good choice i want to
[12:07] hang around the right people can you say
[12:09] ma'am
[12:10] and and so i want to be around the right
[12:12] people i want to read around the right
[12:13] influences and uh i think someone asked
[12:16] brother branham a question one time
[12:18] who should we let our teenage teenagers
[12:20] hang around with
[12:21] and she said he said getting get them
[12:23] around good associates
[12:25] and good boys and good girls as long as
[12:28] you can
[12:28] get them around the right influences get
[12:31] them there
[12:32] around the right crowd because they're
[12:34] gonna have friends
[12:36] can you say amen they're going to want
[12:38] to go out with friends they're going to
[12:39] want to go do this and go do that
[12:41] and it would be unrealistic to think
[12:43] they get to those ages
[12:44] and they don't have to be around anybody
[12:47] but you
[12:49] you're being unrealistic as they grow
[12:51] older
[12:52] they're going to want to have friends
[12:53] but we are as responsible as parents
[12:56] especially the young years to direct
[12:58] them who they hang around
[12:59] and give them choices of a good
[13:01] christian camp to go to
[13:02] to look forward to give them choices of
[13:05] good ones to be around
[13:06] and the and the youth meetings that we
[13:08] have here and the different events
[13:10] to get them around and not everybody in
[13:12] those youth meetings are perfect by any
[13:14] means
[13:14] not every teenager coming to our youth
[13:17] meetings has got it all
[13:18] completely together but i guarantee you
[13:20] it's a better atmosphere
[13:22] than being out there in the world can i
[13:24] get an amen
[13:26] so you have a choice in that and the
[13:28] things that i have a choice in
[13:30] i want to be able to to direct that can
[13:33] you say amen
[13:34] and and so we have choices and
[13:37] uh by associating who we're hanging
[13:39] around
[13:40] uh we should make good choices of who
[13:43] that is brother brahm says in the
[13:44] message believing god
[13:46] and the only thing that kept me from
[13:48] being saved
[13:49] when i was 12 years old because a spirit
[13:52] hung over me a devil
[13:53] saying wait a little while longer that's
[13:56] the reason you wasn't saved you knew
[13:58] when you became the age of
[14:00] accountability a
[14:02] spirit you got in a crowd
[14:05] and that hovered over you and you kept
[14:08] it
[14:08] kept hanging over you now friends this
[14:11] is a principle this is not just a story
[14:14] about a 12 year old
[14:16] being on the wrong crowd and the wrong
[14:18] influence
[14:19] and with that crowd came a spirit that
[14:21] actually said
[14:22] don't give your heart to the lord now
[14:24] just wait a little longer
[14:26] this is not just a 12 year old i knew i
[14:29] know
[14:29] 40 year olds that need to get this
[14:31] principle
[14:33] they're hanging around the wrong people
[14:35] can you say man
[14:36] and with those people comes a spirit
[14:39] that causes you to hesitate
[14:41] and wait to take the promises of god and
[14:44] let me say it this way to grow
[14:46] as a full mature son and daughter of god
[14:48] spiritually
[14:49] it's holding you back from your growth
[14:51] it's a spirit that says just wait a
[14:53] little longer i'm good enough
[14:54] i'm a good person and i'm telling you
[14:56] when you get out of that and get in the
[14:58] word
[14:58] it's going to be encouraging you to grow
[15:00] further in the grace of god
[15:03] can i get a greater amen than that i
[15:05] believe that this applies to everybody
[15:07] that he said
[15:08] i got around the wrong boys at 12 years
[15:11] old i got
[15:12] around the wrong crowd and i said i'll
[15:14] be fine i'll be good i can i can do this
[15:16] but listen you stay long enough they're
[15:19] going to influence you
[15:20] instead of you influencing them and also
[15:23] there might be a spirit there
[15:24] that's with that crowd that makes you
[15:26] wait a little longer
[15:32] amen well
[15:35] i don't feel comfortable around people
[15:37] who talk about the bible
[15:40] and the lord all the time or at all
[15:44] i don't feel comfortable around those
[15:45] that wear modest dress
[15:47] and
[15:51] well doesn't that show what's in you
[15:56] so you got to take a look say i don't
[15:58] feel comfortable around people like that
[16:00] i run from people like that and yet
[16:02] you're choosing other ones
[16:04] doesn't that show where you're at who do
[16:06] you feel comfortable to be around
[16:10] you like the jezebels you like to hang
[16:12] around jezebels
[16:15] you like to hang around fornicators when
[16:17] the bible says don't hang around
[16:19] fornicators
[16:20] the bible says that you like to hang
[16:22] around successful people
[16:25] who are christians who speak against the
[16:27] message of the hour
[16:28] you like to hang around that shouldn't
[16:30] you pray about that that that is a
[16:32] choice that you're making that
[16:34] is going to influence your life that's
[16:36] not a good influence
[16:38] and it'll keep you from the promises of
[16:40] god so as i in this point i would say
[16:43] who should i get around then brother
[16:45] paul who should i get around
[16:47] and paul said a couple things one place
[16:49] he said paul said follow me
[16:51] as i follow christ
[16:55] paul said follow me as i follow christ
[16:59] let me take it a bit deeper because
[17:00] that's the prophet of god paul the
[17:02] apostle paul
[17:02] the prophet of god he said follow me as
[17:05] i follow christ we're not following the
[17:06] man
[17:07] we're following the christ in the man so
[17:09] i've got confidence and when i talked a
[17:11] few minutes ago about
[17:13] everybody is under the influence of
[17:15] somebody
[17:16] i'd rather my influence of my decisions
[17:18] the influence be under a true prophet of
[17:21] god than anybody
[17:22] i'm going to go ahead and say this that
[17:24] i value a god called man
[17:27] and his opinions above my own opinion
[17:29] sometimes
[17:31] i knew i wouldn't get as many amens on
[17:33] that but that's how i've ordered my life
[17:35] since the 16 year old boy
[17:37] i'm not ashamed to be under the
[17:39] influence of a god called prophet
[17:41] i'm not ashamed to be under the
[17:43] influence of what this bible is is
[17:44] prophets and apostles
[17:48] and i read this every day because why i
[17:50] would rather be under their influence
[17:53] than my own opinions i would rather this
[17:56] form my opinions of life
[17:59] than to form my own
[18:02] is that cultish no if it is then paul
[18:06] was wrong when he said follow me as i
[18:07] follow christ
[18:10] is that some type of brainwashing
[18:14] yeah in some ways it is
[18:18] because paul said be transformed by the
[18:20] renewing of your mind
[18:23] you don't want to live by just your own
[18:24] thoughts you want to live by you don't
[18:26] enter the influence of the world
[18:28] or under the influence of movie stars or
[18:30] the influence of politicians
[18:32] you want to be under the influence of
[18:34] godly men
[18:36] and the holy ghost and the spirit of god
[18:39] can you say amen you have a choice
[18:43] who you're under the influence of
[18:46] so the next scripture the last one i
[18:47] want to read as i end this point is
[18:49] hebrews 6 12.
[18:50] i don't know if you guys could pull that
[18:51] up quickly but hebrews 6
[18:53] 12 says hebrews 6 12 says and i don't
[18:57] have the whole scripture
[18:58] it says that ye be not slawful but
[19:01] followers of them who through faith and
[19:04] patience
[19:05] inherit the promises who do i need to
[19:09] hang
[19:10] around the most those that are
[19:14] taking hold of these promises and you
[19:16] can see it
[19:17] they're on fire with it and they're
[19:20] human beings they have struggles they've
[19:22] had trials
[19:23] but you know what they're barreling
[19:24] through and you can see them they're
[19:26] taking the promises
[19:27] i see more of the character of christ i
[19:29] see more of the victory of christ i see
[19:31] more of the love of christ
[19:32] i see them growing in the lord i see
[19:35] things in their life
[19:36] that i want to be so i'm going to hang
[19:38] with people like that
[19:40] followers are those you say brother paul
[19:42] you preach this series i'm hardly
[19:44] inheriting my promises
[19:45] i'm still held back well then maybe take
[19:47] a step and get around some people
[19:50] who are inheriting the promises and
[19:53] maybe that'll rub off on you
[19:57] get back up here and go to the next
[19:58] point because
[20:02] okay go with me to first corinthians 10
[20:05] and we'll go
[20:05] to a few more points here first
[20:07] corinthians 10.
[20:08] now this is the group in the wilderness
[20:12] that we read in hebrews last week and
[20:13] now we give some more points from how
[20:15] they were acting in first corinthians
[20:16] 10.
[20:17] moreover brethren i would not have you
[20:19] be ignorant
[20:20] how that all our fathers were under the
[20:22] cloud and all passed through the sea
[20:23] and were all baptized unto moses the
[20:25] prophet in the cloud and in the sea
[20:27] did all eat the same spiritual meat did
[20:29] all drink the same spiritual meat
[20:31] drink for they drank of that spiritual
[20:33] rock that followed him that rock was
[20:35] christ
[20:35] but with many of them god was not well
[20:37] pleased for they were overthrown in the
[20:38] wilderness
[20:39] now these things were our examples to
[20:41] the intent that we should not lust after
[20:44] evil things as they also lusted
[20:45] so now it's going to go into some points
[20:47] of what kept them out of the promised
[20:48] land what kept them from going in god
[20:50] wandering in the wilderness this is the
[20:52] same group that we read last sunday in
[20:55] hebrews
[20:56] the same group that it said they heard
[20:58] the gospel preached
[21:00] but it did no good to them because it
[21:02] wasn't mixed with faith
[21:04] remember my points last sunday they had
[21:06] hardened hearts
[21:07] they had unbelief they kept doubting
[21:09] moses they kept in that mode and it kept
[21:11] him out of the promised land
[21:13] right here's the same group and here's
[21:15] some more points about that group in the
[21:16] wilderness
[21:17] neither be ye first of all it says don't
[21:19] lust after evil things
[21:21] neither be idolaters as some of them as
[21:24] it is written
[21:25] the people sat down to eat and drink and
[21:28] rose up to play there's a similarity
[21:30] with the word idols that comes from the
[21:32] other word idol
[21:34] i-d-l-e and they just basically become
[21:37] idol first
[21:38] the main time it happens when moses was
[21:40] up getting the word
[21:41] and they just were you know laying
[21:42] around moses isn't coming down moses
[21:45] isn't coming down they got impatient
[21:47] they they got all the gold together they
[21:49] formed an idol
[21:50] they formed one but it wasn't just they
[21:53] rose
[21:53] it wasn't just that they gonna worship
[21:55] this calf they became idle
[21:58] they should have been praying for moses
[22:02] they said this should have been saying
[22:03] in the waiting time shouldn't we just
[22:05] pray and just pray for him that god
[22:07] speaks to him and
[22:08] we're ready to receive the word
[22:11] but the time they got idle idle time
[22:16] makes people idol worshipers
[22:22] you got teenagers young people the
[22:25] devil's in the details
[22:28] idle time is the devil's playground when
[22:31] you're on your phone and on the internet
[22:32] too many hours of idle time just doing
[22:34] that is very
[22:36] dangerous okay countless hours watching
[22:39] posts and looking through these votes
[22:41] can bring you down can make you
[22:42] depressed you know how the postings is
[22:44] everybody's life is more exciting than
[22:46] yours you know how it goes
[22:48] and you get more and more depressed
[22:50] because they're in tahiti somewhere
[22:53] this even though we know they might be
[22:55] just making their bedroom look like
[22:57] tahiti and they're not really there
[23:00] and the dish that they did and all this
[23:03] and basically it just screams my life is
[23:06] better than yours
[23:09] and we live by that we get under the
[23:10] influence of that and everybody's better
[23:12] everything's not everything but
[23:13] this is a very immature thing and people
[23:15] in their idle time don't fill it with
[23:17] the word of god
[23:18] or being around the right people you
[23:20] stand alone you're alone with somebody
[23:22] and character is character is what you
[23:24] are when you're by yourself
[23:27] this is really going to show up and so
[23:29] if you have idle time
[23:30] they rose up to play they they got into
[23:33] pleasures
[23:34] fornication come in all because of this
[23:37] idle time and then an idol came in after
[23:39] that
[23:40] so it says don't do that okay this is
[23:41] things that can come in between you and
[23:43] the promise of god
[23:44] neither let us commit fornication verse
[23:46] eight as some of them committed
[23:47] and fell in one one day three and twenty
[23:50] thousand
[23:52] neither let us tempt crisis some of them
[23:53] were also tempted and were destroyed of
[23:55] serpents last
[23:56] son we talked about how they tempted god
[23:58] neither murmur ye as some of them also
[24:00] murmured and were destroyed of the
[24:02] destroyer
[24:04] now all these things happen unto them
[24:05] for examples that and they
[24:07] happen unto them for examples and they
[24:09] are written for our admonition
[24:11] upon whom the ends of the world are come
[24:13] those things happen so that we can take
[24:15] the example
[24:16] is that you're going to be kept from the
[24:18] promised land if you allow yourself to
[24:20] become idol you allow yourself to become
[24:22] a murmur and complainer
[24:23] these are things number eight lusting
[24:26] after evil things number nine
[24:28] the pleasure that comes in idolatry and
[24:30] idols number 10
[24:31] murmuring and complaining these are
[24:34] things that keep people from the
[24:35] promised land
[24:37] it did it back then it'll do it now
[24:41] now did you notice that all these things
[24:44] are not
[24:45] individuals it's a crowd that did it
[24:49] it's them it's the other people
[24:52] it says they were idolaters they rose up
[24:56] the people sat up down to eat and drink
[24:59] and rose up to play
[25:00] so many more things i could say about
[25:01] that neither let us
[25:04] commit fornication as some of them did
[25:07] and them that tempted christ
[25:08] and neither murmur as some of them also
[25:11] murdered this
[25:11] was not one individual this was the
[25:14] crowd
[25:15] this was a crowd that became complainers
[25:19] if you hang around murmurs and
[25:22] complainers
[25:23] you probably will become that way you'll
[25:26] become negative
[25:29] if you hang hanging out today is not
[25:33] i'd say today we're not around as many
[25:35] people as we used to be
[25:36] having them over to our homes and
[25:37] different things like that that's a
[25:39] detriment but we're not around
[25:42] are hanging out is on social media
[25:46] and if you think that has less influence
[25:49] than somebody at your house
[25:51] you're crazy because it probably has
[25:54] more influence and you don't even know
[25:56] sometimes who they are but the whole
[25:58] social media is the crowd what's the
[25:59] crowd saying what's everybody saying
[26:01] what's the general consensus here
[26:02] what's the and you can get on with
[26:05] certain people and they're constantly
[26:06] murmuring complaining putting things
[26:08] down
[26:08] they're just negative and you'll become
[26:12] that way
[26:13] or if you hang out on the social media
[26:16] with people that are
[26:18] successful in the world's eyes they
[26:21] always got things they're always got
[26:22] this
[26:23] got this knew this knew this and they're
[26:24] always boasting on it on the internet
[26:26] if you hang out with that you become
[26:29] that way you become possession minded
[26:32] you under get under the influence of it
[26:36] if you hang out with people there that
[26:38] are depressed all the time
[26:40] and they have a spirit of depression
[26:43] who do you go to when you get depressed
[26:47] a lot of times people go to depressed
[26:50] people
[26:50] for counsel
[26:54] you're laughing because it's funny
[26:58] okay now i'm gonna get you when you have
[27:00] hit a hard time in your life
[27:04] should we be in church more or out of
[27:06] church more
[27:09] you don't have to stay amen to that one
[27:10] just think about it what would be a good
[27:12] thing
[27:13] if you're really going through it
[27:15] probably around the atmosphere of the
[27:17] word
[27:18] the saints of god the encouragement the
[27:20] songs
[27:21] but a lot of times people will go the
[27:23] opposite direction
[27:24] and the very thing they need is a thing
[27:27] they distance themselves from
[27:30] you understand it's influence and if you
[27:33] go to somebody for council
[27:35] first of all that's going to tell you
[27:36] what you want to hear and sympathize and
[27:38] play a pity party with you
[27:40] they're not doing you any good
[27:43] if you're going to people on social
[27:44] media that have the same problems as you
[27:47] and haven't been delivered for years
[27:48] you're not going to be delivered
[27:50] i'm asking you to think about it this
[27:52] morning that you have to make a choice
[27:54] of who influences you if you're
[27:57] interested in deliverance
[27:59] from things there's a promise that you
[28:02] don't have to live in that depression
[28:04] anymore
[28:04] there's a promise that you don't have to
[28:06] live in bitterness anymore
[28:07] there's a promise right in front of you
[28:09] but you're holding it back by hanging
[28:11] around the wrong crowd
[28:12] these people were murmurs complainers
[28:14] they were fornicators there all these
[28:16] things and couldn't go into the promised
[28:17] land and if you were there
[28:19] the best thing that you could do is to
[28:22] distance yourself
[28:23] and by the way joshua and caleb had to
[28:26] do that
[28:27] joshua and caleb got away from that
[28:29] crowd got away from the murmurs and
[28:32] complainers got away from the
[28:33] fornicators the idolaters
[28:35] and they may have walked alone but they
[28:38] got away from because why
[28:39] they wanted the promised land i want the
[28:43] promised land
[28:44] and it does mean no good to hang around
[28:46] murmurs and complainers
[28:51] number 11 prosperity would you turn with
[28:53] me to deuteronomy 6
[28:55] prosperity is something that keeps you
[28:57] from the promises
[29:02] is there anything wrong with prosperity
[29:03] no
[29:05] but how can prosperity keep you from the
[29:07] promises he says here in deuteronomy it
[29:09] says in
[29:10] several places before the chinese came
[29:12] into the promised land
[29:14] several warnings and some of them like a
[29:16] whole chapter full of it
[29:17] here's a small area that says
[29:18] deuteronomy 6 verse 10 if you guys would
[29:20] put it up
[29:21] deuteronomy 6 and verse 10 you wouldn't
[29:24] think that prosperity would keep you
[29:25] from the promises of god
[29:27] watch some god prosper somebody's life
[29:31] watching they get more things watching
[29:32] god blesses what they're doing
[29:35] watching it's god's blessing and they
[29:38] even give god glory for it thank god
[29:40] he's blessing this and he's blessing
[29:41] this and my business and all this stuff
[29:43] be careful it's a test
[29:48] when things begin to expand and you're
[29:51] doing this and doing this and that and
[29:53] it said
[29:53] be careful be ready it's right here in
[29:55] the scripture
[29:58] because it can keep you from the
[29:59] promises of god
[30:01] it becomes a trap and you think oh but
[30:04] god's blessing it but there's always a
[30:06] test that goes with it
[30:08] where's your heart and verse 10
[30:11] says and it shall be when the lord thy
[30:14] god shall have
[30:16] brought thee into the land which he
[30:18] swear unto thy fathers to abraham to
[30:20] isaac to jacob to
[30:21] give thee great and goodly cities which
[30:23] thou build us not and houses full of all
[30:25] good things which shall fill us not
[30:27] and wells dig with saudis now and
[30:29] vineyards and olive trees which thou
[30:31] plant us not when thou shalt have eaten
[30:33] and be full
[30:34] then beware lest thou forget the lord
[30:40] this warning is here in several places
[30:43] before the children of israel
[30:44] come into their promised land a land
[30:46] flowing with milk and honey
[30:48] places that were given them by god they
[30:50] had to drive the enemy out but they were
[30:52] giving them my god they never had to pay
[30:54] for it
[30:55] it was the blessing of god when they
[30:56] come into it he knew ahead of time
[30:58] our hearts and he says when you go into
[31:00] that price for prosperity
[31:02] then beware lest you forget the lord
[31:08] oh it's happened to thousands of people
[31:12] in the message christians ruined
[31:15] by prosperity
[31:19] because all of a sudden their priorities
[31:21] change what's important changes
[31:24] and they still think god's blessing
[31:25] because everything's being blessed
[31:27] but you're forgetting the lord you're
[31:29] forgetting your walk with the lord
[31:32] something has become in between you and
[31:35] you growing
[31:36] into the promises of god and prosperity
[31:38] did it
[31:40] i say we take his warning can you say
[31:42] amen
[31:44] so when we come to our text now moving
[31:46] on told you i'd move quickly
[31:48] promised my wife i'd preach short today
[31:56] she never believes me when i say that
[32:00] 27 years of marriage and she's learned
[32:03] and she says when i say that i actually
[32:06] end up preaching longer
[32:12] and sometimes i said i don't very have
[32:14] too much here today i do but
[32:16] sometimes i just don't have too much i
[32:18] just you know be a short surface she
[32:20] says when you don't have too much on
[32:21] your notes
[32:22] it ends up being a longer service art
[32:25] wives just a lovely thing
[32:29] just so precious what would you do
[32:32] without that voice in your life just to
[32:36] keep you humble children and wives
[32:39] should just keep you in your place
[32:42] keep you real
[32:47] praise the lord i have
[32:50] the best wife in the world i want to
[32:52] just say just now
[32:53] she's one of the seven wonders of the
[32:55] world i love her to death
[32:57] and now i've embarrassed her so but i'm
[33:00] taking you on vacation this week
[33:02] don't forget that
[33:07] when we read our scripture in in joshua
[33:10] there about the lord hard in the hearts
[33:12] if you want to turn back there
[33:14] just keep that and we'll just talk about
[33:17] that a little bit
[33:20] just back here in joshua
[33:25] chapter 11 verse 20 for it was of the
[33:28] lord
[33:29] to harden their hearts that they should
[33:31] come against
[33:32] israel in battle that they might destroy
[33:33] them utterly and that they might have no
[33:36] favor but that he might destroy them as
[33:38] the lord commanded moses
[33:39] so last week we were talking about our
[33:43] hearts becoming hardened
[33:45] the children of israel come to unbelief
[33:48] because they let their hearts be hard
[33:49] and i don't have time to talk about it
[33:51] today but if you could listen to last
[33:52] sunday you'd see
[33:54] how did they become hardened in their
[33:55] hearts the very people listen to the
[33:57] prophet the very people in the message
[33:59] become hard in their hearts i explained
[34:02] it last sunday is that they kind of put
[34:03] god in a spot
[34:04] lord if you do this miracle then i'll
[34:06] serve you is that a lack of commitment
[34:08] and god would even meet their miracles
[34:10] but over time
[34:11] if we don't get the things that we want
[34:13] just how we want them our hearts become
[34:15] hardened
[34:16] and we start to disbelieve the word of
[34:19] god
[34:20] so last week it was about our hearts
[34:22] becoming hardened
[34:24] and the holy spirit i want to thank him
[34:26] today
[34:27] for how the holy spirit so deeply moved
[34:30] last sunday
[34:32] something the presence of god come in
[34:34] such a special way at the end
[34:36] unexpected and those that raised their
[34:39] hand maybe some that didn't but those
[34:41] who
[34:42] reacted to that presence being there
[34:44] that way i am hearing testimony after
[34:46] testimony after testimony
[34:48] of god just coming down in that moment
[34:50] listen the most important thing in your
[34:52] life
[34:53] is the holy spirit comes in your life
[34:54] and you respond to it
[34:56] because i can preach a sermon here for
[34:58] 60 minutes you might not get nothing
[35:00] but when he comes and starts wooing your
[35:02] hearts last
[35:03] last sunday god began to woo a heart to
[35:06] be able to say
[35:07] i want a young boy to be baptized in the
[35:09] name of the lord jesus christ
[35:11] last sunday sunday somebody who's had
[35:13] migraine headaches
[35:14] they ask a sister to pray i think it was
[35:16] at communion or before it this wasn't
[35:18] even the morning service
[35:20] and we had such a lovely time at
[35:21] communion service we had 70
[35:23] i think 70 or 80 people at communion
[35:26] that's the largest show up for the
[35:27] lord's supper
[35:29] in the history of this church almost
[35:32] 80 people come for the lord's supper and
[35:34] that's the way it should be
[35:36] can you say man
[35:40] she asked the sister to pray she had
[35:42] those migraines for days
[35:43] instantly it was i believe this was if
[35:46] not the next day we had dinner with them
[35:47] she said i don't have any pain
[35:48] whatsoever
[35:52] sister laura received a healing for
[35:54] something on her
[35:56] neck that's a grow not a growth but
[35:57] something that was there
[35:59] and she said i just put my hand on it
[36:01] after that service and raise your hand
[36:02] and it was gone
[36:07] there's some we still have to wait for
[36:08] the healing and reports to come back
[36:10] because
[36:10] they raise their hand it might be
[36:12] instantaneous it might be later but i
[36:14] tell you hold on to the promise of god
[36:16] can you say man that's more than paul
[36:17] lafontaine that's the reality of this
[36:19] god that's among us
[36:21] you got depression you got things you
[36:23] need to be in the presence of the lord
[36:24] and respond and say lord i want what you
[36:26] have for me
[36:27] you don't have to work for it you just
[36:29] receive it in the name of the lord jesus
[36:30] christ
[36:31] god is real friends god is real this
[36:34] isn't about
[36:35] church in a beautiful building and a
[36:37] preacher it's about god coming down
[36:39] he loves you he cares about what you're
[36:43] going through
[36:44] and he wants you to see the victory that
[36:46] he's given you in jesus christ
[36:48] christ wants to see you come to victory
[36:51] through him
[36:52] so we cannot become hardened and we
[36:55] talked about that last week but now this
[36:57] scripture
[36:58] says other people who get hardened
[37:01] so it's not us becoming hard it's other
[37:03] people that are hard hearts
[37:05] and the mystery of it in our text is
[37:08] that god the lord
[37:09] hardened the enemy's heart and so let me
[37:13] just say this way when god
[37:15] wants to finish something off that's in
[37:17] between you and your promise
[37:19] he may increase the pressure by
[37:23] hardening
[37:24] their heart towards you
[37:30] amen when god is so interested in taking
[37:35] you
[37:35] from where you are to taking more of
[37:37] your promises
[37:39] the lord may harden the heart of the
[37:41] enemy or other people the enemy and
[37:44] other people
[37:44] and harden their heart against you and
[37:47] sometimes we don't understand that
[37:50] sometimes we don't understand when
[37:52] friends
[37:53] turn on us i know nobody's ever had that
[37:56] happen before here
[37:59] but we don't understand it people are
[38:01] supposed to be loyal to us people are
[38:02] supposed to be
[38:03] supportive of us we have that happen
[38:06] i want to say another thing that
[38:07] happened last sunday not just physical
[38:09] healing
[38:10] but some person shared a very close
[38:13] intimate thing
[38:14] about a room in their h in their heart
[38:18] that they hadn't given to god and it was
[38:21] very descriptive and i ca she kept
[38:24] ignoring it
[38:26] and the holy spirit come and just spoke
[38:28] said just bring jesus in that room
[38:32] she said i got victor i i i don't know
[38:36] how old she is but
[38:37] 30 40 years old i don't all these years
[38:40] i had that little room and she said i
[38:41] got victory
[38:42] in the service it was done a lot of you
[38:45] have little rooms in your heart
[38:47] you won't let anybody go there including
[38:48] the lord
[38:51] and then gideon gets up just after and
[38:53] sings the song
[38:54] jesus is in in the room is that the name
[38:57] of it
[38:58] i feel jesus in the room right after the
[39:01] lord spoke that to her
[39:02] then he says i feel jesus in the room
[39:06] god's doing things friends it's not just
[39:09] physical healing
[39:10] it's healing of the heart you hang
[39:13] around long enough around here you're
[39:14] going to hear a preacher that preaches
[39:15] about the heart
[39:15] because we hide things many times and
[39:18] the prophet and the discernment lines
[39:19] many times it wasn't physical healing
[39:21] they needed
[39:22] it was a emotional healing and they're
[39:24] hiding things and the devil's got them
[39:26] bound right in that
[39:27] place in their heart past history
[39:29] whatever it is it doesn't matter to me
[39:31] what it is
[39:31] you've got to get to the bottom and
[39:33] trust and say lord i welcome you in that
[39:35] room because you're the only one that
[39:37] can change it
[39:39] can i get an amen from someone
[39:42] so now here we have god hardening other
[39:45] people's hearts
[39:46] to move israel to destroy the enemy and
[39:49] when god wants you to
[39:50] finish something off that's in between
[39:52] you and the promise
[39:54] the purpose of god he may increase the
[39:56] pressure by hardening their heart toward
[39:58] you
[40:00] other people becoming more hard
[40:04] other people becoming more hard what an
[40:06] influence this can be on your life
[40:09] when other people get hardness of heart
[40:13] towards you what an influence that can
[40:16] be
[40:17] on you you didn't get hardened but
[40:20] they're hard hearts
[40:22] and that can be make an influence on
[40:24] your life can you say amen
[40:27] i encourage you don't hang around that
[40:29] don't hang around that type of people
[40:31] it'll rub off on you but god here
[40:35] the mystery of it is god hardens other
[40:37] people's hearts
[40:39] and we talked about pharaoh did god
[40:41] harden pharaoh's heart
[40:43] and i was just thinking about that last
[40:44] night god you know
[40:46] israel wanted to be delivered by the
[40:49] prophet and so
[40:51] pharaoh fought it pharaoh fought it and
[40:52] we had these different miracles that
[40:54] moses showed
[40:55] to prove god was and went back and forth
[40:58] it's because god was working on
[40:59] pharaoh's heart
[41:00] to make this thing more glory that goes
[41:02] to god that when israel left
[41:04] they knew it would be a supernatural
[41:06] thing it wasn't just
[41:08] it just it was in other words it wasn't
[41:10] an easy thing
[41:11] pharaoh wasn't just going to say all
[41:13] right well just go
[41:14] then just go he wasn't going to be that
[41:16] easy and it was god who was hard in his
[41:17] heart
[41:18] to not make it easy that's how much he
[41:21] loves you
[41:22] nothing's easy in this life
[41:26] remember the prophet saying last night i
[41:28] was listening here at the church
[41:30] and he says we he says we have more
[41:32] pressure than we've ever had
[41:34] and the devil is many times harder to
[41:37] fight against in this age than any other
[41:38] age
[41:39] and he he talks about the enemy coming
[41:42] in and pressuring more and more and more
[41:44] and and we see then god hardening
[41:47] pharaoh's heart
[41:48] to make it he says life isn't going to
[41:50] be life isn't going to be easy and he
[41:52] says
[41:52] you already have tension when you're out
[41:55] there in the world without the lord
[41:58] before the lord the world is full of
[42:00] tension pressures financial pressures
[42:02] all that
[42:03] and he says when you become a christian
[42:05] you just add that much more
[42:07] to the pressure we thought it would be
[42:10] less
[42:12] but he says now you enter a phase that
[42:14] you're walking on pins and needles
[42:16] because you want to please the lord so
[42:18] you're watching every step i want to be
[42:19] a good testimony
[42:21] i want to please the lord that can be a
[42:23] pressure
[42:24] but don't think of it out about a
[42:26] pressure too much it's a privilege to
[42:28] serve the lord
[42:29] but anybody who's telling you that it's
[42:31] easy life to live a sanctified life
[42:33] before the lord
[42:34] all those that live godly in christ
[42:36] jesus shall suffer persecution
[42:38] anybody who's telling you that this is
[42:39] an easy life
[42:41] i got some land to sell you you see what
[42:43] i'm saying
[42:45] anybody who who's trying to sell that is
[42:48] selling the wrong christianity
[42:50] because god hardened pharaoh's heart if
[42:53] he can harden
[42:54] pharaoh's heart who thought he was a god
[42:57] he can harden
[42:58] anybody's heart in your life right now
[43:03] to make it not so easy on you that
[43:05] you'll rise to the occasion
[43:07] not be influenced by that and say i'm
[43:10] gonna go take the enemy and i'm
[43:12] going to go take my promises anyway
[43:14] imagine this
[43:16] israel i thought this was going to be
[43:18] easy
[43:19] and he says now pharaoh comes to a place
[43:21] after a certain time says
[43:22] okay just go go i don't want you to just
[43:25] go
[43:25] i think ten commandments just you can go
[43:27] now
[43:29] and they get going and they get down the
[43:30] journey and
[43:32] god hardens pharaoh's heart again nope
[43:34] changed my mind
[43:37] anybody ever been around a person like
[43:38] that one day they love you
[43:42] one day they support you and
[43:45] for some reason the next day changed my
[43:48] mind
[43:49] i don't like you anymore i don't support
[43:51] what you're doing
[43:52] anybody had people like that in your
[43:54] life maybe it's to challenge you
[43:58] are you going to go on the whims of the
[43:59] emotions of somebody
[44:01] who's one day up and one day
[44:04] down and one day they're hardened so
[44:07] much against the messages against god
[44:09] and the next day that oh maybe it's all
[44:11] okay and they're up and down like a
[44:13] roller coaster
[44:14] you cannot let your emotions be affected
[44:18] by the hardened heart of someone else
[44:22] and pharaoh did that when they went out
[44:24] they came back you see they went out and
[44:27] pharaoh said no i changed my mind back
[44:29] and forth
[44:30] back and forth i like you i don't like
[44:33] you
[44:33] okay go and get your land the next day i
[44:35] changed my mind
[44:37] i like you i don't like you
[44:40] back and forth the other day i was at
[44:41] the ymca and
[44:43] this old older lady
[44:47] i kind of like to go to a certain
[44:48] section there because they're all older
[44:49] than me
[44:52] and she says talk talk talk it's eight
[44:54] in the morning she's just talking
[44:55] talking tons
[44:56] so friendly so nice just going on and on
[44:59] and on i just
[45:00] told my daughter later i said you know
[45:02] sometimes you like a little bit of
[45:03] quietness
[45:04] she had a lot to talk about and every
[45:06] day it's that way i see her talking
[45:07] talking but
[45:08] for some reason that first day she just
[45:10] said he asked me about pastoring and
[45:12] the covet and the decisions through cope
[45:14] and all that so
[45:15] friendly the next day i just was smiling
[45:18] i said
[45:18] hello good morning to you she didn't
[45:20] even say good morning
[45:22] she looked the other way and every day
[45:25] she will not
[45:26] say hello she won't even address that i
[45:28] walked up there and said
[45:32] now friends i just it's kind of a crazy
[45:34] example but listen
[45:36] we're human beings and you can't help
[45:39] but wonder
[45:41] what did i do wrong i got the same gym
[45:45] outfit i'm
[45:46] the same guy that was here yesterday you
[45:48] were so friendly and so open and so nice
[45:50] to me
[45:51] and now you won't even say hello
[45:55] it can play with your mind what did i do
[46:01] and a lot of times you didn't do
[46:02] anything
[46:04] it's just people it's like what in the
[46:07] world where are they at what's going on
[46:10] up and down and up and down am i talking
[46:12] to anybody you do people do that in your
[46:14] life family members
[46:17] one day they're up one day they're down
[46:20] listen you got enough of that in your
[46:21] life sometimes
[46:23] you don't need to live on the emotions
[46:26] of where people at
[46:28] and you don't where people are at and
[46:29] you don't need to
[46:31] draw your confidence and your
[46:36] credibility and your
[46:40] peace from the up and down emotions of
[46:43] others
[46:45] you need to stand sure-footed on the
[46:48] promise of god
[46:50] that's where god wants you to stand and
[46:54] let it be a motivator to you i'm going
[46:57] on with the lord anyway
[46:59] i'm going to take my promises anyway and
[47:02] pharaoh's hearts and let's bring up the
[47:04] last one is when they
[47:06] were so rejoicing and then they get down
[47:08] to the red sea
[47:09] and the red sea was okay you know that
[47:10] was fine but then they get to the red
[47:13] sea because
[47:13] they were so happy and they were so
[47:16] excited
[47:17] and they got so much faith and they get
[47:19] to the red sea
[47:21] and the thing is is that this big swing
[47:23] of emotions where
[47:25] god is with us we got a prophet here
[47:28] everything's going so good
[47:29] we're marching out pharaoh let us go how
[47:32] many has ever testified
[47:34] of something god is with me my look at
[47:37] the super action oh god
[47:38] look at moses look how poor if it's and
[47:40] we're out here now we're going to the
[47:42] promised land
[47:43] praise the lord how many has ever had
[47:45] you testify and all of a sudden
[47:46] everything swings around as if
[47:53] and i'm here to tell you it's a test
[47:56] because nobody promised you that that
[47:57] testimony was just going to continue on
[47:59] you're going to
[48:00] not have any more trouble nobody
[48:01] promised you that
[48:03] and they're there at the red sea and
[48:05] they're already wondering what's going
[48:06] now they start to wonder what's going to
[48:07] go on
[48:08] now we're stuck here and they look back
[48:10] and see a cloud of dust coming and it's
[48:12] pharaoh
[48:13] who's changed his mind because
[48:16] god hardened his heart
[48:20] their god that the pillar of fire and
[48:23] moses the prophet
[48:24] their same god is over there working on
[48:26] pharaoh's heart to harden his heart and
[48:27] say
[48:27] i'm going after him now and here they
[48:29] are coming you talk about the swing of
[48:31] emotions
[48:31] i thought god was with us i thought the
[48:33] prophet was true
[48:36] i thought i could trust this prophet
[48:39] anybody see the little laced comments
[48:41] i'm making here
[48:44] there are things the devil had concocted
[48:47] for people of this message
[48:49] to make them question the authority of a
[48:52] prophet
[48:54] and make them question whether this is
[48:56] true or not
[48:57] it's a test
[49:01] so the up and down lord what are we
[49:03] going to do now and that's when those
[49:06] god had to come to moses because even
[49:07] he's crying he's crying after the lord
[49:10] the children of israel crying
[49:13] what what lord we don't understand this
[49:15] we can't make heads or tales of this
[49:17] and they're crying and they're weeping
[49:20] and
[49:21] god comes down and says to moses
[49:25] why cry speak
[49:28] and go forward
[49:31] so god did that as a test so they would
[49:33] be driven to their crying
[49:35] but he wants them to grow out of their
[49:37] crying can you say man
[49:38] he would have rather them said at that
[49:40] moment you know what
[49:42] we've come this far god supernaturally
[49:44] brought us this far
[49:46] i don't care that pharaoh's coming with
[49:48] his army right now
[49:49] we're right on the verge of something
[49:51] really good happening we're not going to
[49:53] cry
[49:53] we're not going to complain we're going
[49:55] to look to god and
[49:57] say lord what do you want us to do
[49:58] because the same god that brought us out
[50:00] of egypt
[50:00] will get us out of this that's what he
[50:02] wants to hear out of your
[50:03] lips can you say a matter he wants to
[50:06] hear faith
[50:07] he wants you to grow up then you're a
[50:10] people for the promised land can you
[50:12] imagine these people already complaining
[50:13] they got to go take the enemy out of the
[50:15] promised land yet they're not ready at
[50:17] all
[50:18] god hardens people's hearts to test you
[50:23] and he said why are you crying unto me i
[50:25] gave you a commission
[50:26] i told you what to do i've given you the
[50:29] commission hasn't changed
[50:30] nothing's changed moses you can take
[50:32] those people over the promised land
[50:34] nothing has changed even though you're
[50:36] seeing pharaoh's
[50:37] oh god help me to say this right nothing
[50:40] has changed in the promises of god
[50:43] if somebody hardens their heart towards
[50:45] you
[50:46] if somebody persecutes you if somebody
[50:48] does you wrong
[50:50] nothing's changed as far as your
[50:52] promises
[50:54] nothing's changed as far as god's love
[50:56] for you
[50:58] situations people hardened people people
[51:01] that are treating you wrong and
[51:02] yesterday they treated you right
[51:04] but you've got to stand there and say
[51:06] but nothing has changed in
[51:08] god's love for me nothing has changed in
[51:10] my position in the holy ghost
[51:13] i am a son and daughter of god and none
[51:15] of that up and down emotions
[51:17] changes where i stand with him
[51:19] [Music]
[51:20] can i get it amen that's what you need
[51:23] to hear today
[51:24] this week when it hits and somebody
[51:26] turns on you nothing has changed in my
[51:28] position in christ
[51:31] and this red sea in this pharaoh's army
[51:33] is not a problem for the lord
[51:35] something good is fixing to happen like
[51:37] sherry sings
[51:38] when nothing but a miracle will do there
[51:41] are some spots that we hid
[51:43] that we had we have to have a miracle
[51:46] nothing else we'll do and that's when
[51:48] you need to be saying
[51:50] you know what this is really good
[51:51] because i'm at a spot right now for god
[51:53] to really do something big
[51:55] can you say amen i'm right at that
[51:58] moment
[51:59] when nothing but a miracle will do
[52:01] nothing less than a miracle of god
[52:04] you're standing there and you're saying
[52:05] that god i'm i'm expecting it
[52:08] opens up the red sea oh okay i see
[52:11] that's how he's gonna do it
[52:12] they start running down there they get
[52:14] on the other side can you say amen
[52:16] and they look back and all affairs army
[52:18] just washes
[52:19] with all their chariots whoo
[52:23] glory be to god praise god
[52:26] i shouldn't have cried i should have
[52:28] just spoke and went forward

[53:01] entire
[53:02] pharaoh and his army washed in the sea

[53:09] standing silent until miriam says give

[53:56] i will sing unto the lord for he has
[53:59] triumphed gloriously
[54:01] the horse and the rider get shone into
[54:04] the sea thrown into the sea
[54:05] and she starts to dance and moses
[54:08] started to dance and the children of
[54:10] israel began to dance
[54:13] and they just had a hallelujah breakdown
[54:18] so praise the lord for that praise god
[54:21] but what i'm trying to preach is let's
[54:23] let it be
[54:24] the joshua commission attitude
[54:27] ahead of time that doesn't cry
[54:31] about the hardness of heart and how are
[54:34] the people who treated you
[54:37] but it speaks and i'm going to go
[54:38] forward
[54:40] if you don't get nothing else today i'm
[54:41] asking the question
[54:43] you could come on my office today and
[54:45] tell me your story
[54:47] and everybody has a story and i'm not
[54:50] belittling that story at all there are
[54:52] hurts and the pains that i would have
[54:53] never dreamed
[54:55] satan could do to people even in this
[54:57] message
[55:00] and i would listen and i would pray with
[55:03] you but there comes a point
[55:05] comes a point that you have to stop
[55:08] crying
[55:10] and speak and go forward with the lord
[55:15] only you can make that choice i'm going
[55:17] forward i'm getting past
[55:18] this i'm getting past my past
[55:22] and the only thing i look at now is the
[55:24] future pull that quote up if you guys
[55:26] got it
[55:27] as i close
[55:31] god trains his men then anoints them
[55:35] gives them experience takes them through
[55:37] the rigid training
[55:39] down through the sands of burning
[55:41] punishment trying
[55:43] testing not only does he do that to his
[55:46] prophets but he does it to his children
[55:49] every son that cometh to god must be
[55:51] chastened and tried
[55:53] tested by his word
[55:56] so when the pinch come the strong time
[56:00] when it faces death are you able to
[56:02] stand there on the word of god
[56:04] say god said so that settles it
[56:08] and god had called such a man and that
[56:10] man was moses but moses
[56:12] a great deal like us every time it come
[56:14] to a place to something
[56:16] had to be done moses called out oh lord
[56:20] what must i do in this place
[56:23] now isn't that just like we do god had
[56:26] blessed him
[56:27] anointed him above his brethren give him
[56:30] a message
[56:31] and a ministry that had not been on the
[56:33] earth since that day until that day
[56:35] and yet every time something taken place
[56:37] moses run off to god by the lord
[56:39] what must i do what must i do in this
[56:42] case
[56:43] god kind of got tired of it
[56:48] wow and maybe
[56:52] maybe he gets tired he loves you
[56:57] to qualify that his love doesn't change
[57:00] if he got
[57:00] tired of a prophet coming and doing that
[57:03] does he get tired of you doing it
[57:06] because he tired of you and your circles
[57:08] it just keeps going round and round
[57:10] and corrupt communication comes out of
[57:12] your mouth and that's just old
[57:14] conversations and old hurts and pains
[57:17] and just in that circle i wonder if god
[57:19] gets tired of it
[57:21] god got tired of it i believe and said
[57:23] why are you crying to me
[57:24] speak to the people and go forward
[57:28] my if any time ever looked like ought to
[57:31] retreat was then
[57:32] but god has no retreat
[57:39] god has no retreat say that with me god
[57:42] has no retreat god is only leading you
[57:45] one
[57:46] direction and that's forward he will
[57:48] never justify you going back to the past
[57:50] that's why paul said
[57:51] forgetting those things which are behind
[57:53] i pressed toward the mark of the high
[57:55] calling great
[57:55] you'll never find the holy ghost leading
[57:57] you back into the past into a pity party
[57:59] it's always to speak and go forward
[58:02] there's no place to retreat in god
[58:04] we go forward the doctor says it's
[58:07] cancer
[58:09] go forward
[58:12] if he says it's tb go forward if the
[58:15] devil says you can't give this up
[58:18] go forward if your home says that you're
[58:20] going to be a fanatic
[58:22] go forward the turn the church turns you
[58:24] out
