[27:39] [Music]
[28:09] This is
[28:10] a song the three of us sang on our first
[28:14] time we record 10 songs at Gaither
[28:17] Studios and a long time ago. But I
[28:20] wanted to catch some of these and start
[28:21] singing them again and have mom sing
[28:23] with us. She always thinks her voice is
[28:25] not there, but she does fine. She does
[28:27] fine. But this is a very can be a very
[28:30] convicting song, but it's called My
[28:32] House is full, but my field is empty.
[28:34] And I pray that it'll encourage us to be
[28:37] mission-minded and think about the lost
[28:39] souls.
[28:54] [Music]
[28:56] There is
[28:58] peace and
[29:01] contentment in the Father's house
[29:07] today. Lots of food
[29:10] on the
[29:12] table and no
[29:14] one is turned away.
[29:19] Prayer is
[29:21] singing and
[29:24] laughter as the
[29:27] hours pass
[29:30] by. But a
[29:32] hush starts the
[29:35] singing as the
[29:38] father
[29:40] sadly cries.
[29:45] Oh, my
[29:48] house is
[29:51] full, but my
[29:54] field is
[29:57] empty. Who will go and work for me
[30:04] today?
[30:10] It
[30:11] seems my children
[30:14] all want to
[30:17] stay around my
[30:20] table. But no
[30:23] one wants to work
[30:26] in my feet.
[30:34] No
[30:35] one wants to work
[30:38] in my feet.
[30:45] Push
[30:47] away from the
[30:50] table. Look out through the window pane.
[30:56] Just
[30:58] beyond this house of
[31:01] plenty, there lies a field of golden
[31:07] grain. And it's ripe unto
[31:13] harvest. But the
[31:16] reapers, where are
[31:19] they in the house?
[31:22] Oh, can the
[31:25] children hear the father
[31:29] sadly
[31:33] say, "Oh, my
[31:36] house is

[40:37] are with your healing in Jesus Christ's
[40:39] name we pray and let the church say
[40:41] amen. Amen. God bless all you. Let's
[40:44] turn our scriptures to um 2
[40:52] Kings. 2 Kings
[40:55] uh chapter
[41:03] 5 and reading from verse uh verse one.
[41:13] verse 1
[41:16] to8
[41:19] Kings the 5th chapter from verse 1 to8
[41:23] now Nema captain of the host of the king
[41:27] of Syria was a great man with his master
[41:31] and honorable because by him the Lord
[41:34] had given deliverance unto Syria he was
[41:38] also a mighty man in
[41:40] Valor, but he was a
[41:43] leper. And the Syrians had gone out by
[41:47] companies, and had brought away captive
[41:50] out of the land of Israel a little maid.
[41:54] And she waited on Neon's
[41:56] wife. And she said unto her mistress,
[42:00] "Will God, my lord, were with the
[42:02] prophets that is in Samaria, for he will
[42:06] recover him of his
[42:08] leprosy?" And one went in and told his
[42:11] lord, saying, "Thus, and thus said the
[42:15] maid, that is of the land of Israel. And
[42:19] the king of Syria said, go to go and I
[42:23] will send a letter unto the king of
[42:25] Israel."
[42:27] And he departed and took with him 10
[42:30] talents of silver and 6,000 pieces of
[42:33] gold and 10 changes of raignment. And he
[42:37] brought the letter to the king of
[42:39] Israel, saying, Now when this letter is
[42:43] come unto thee, behold, I have therewith
[42:46] sent Neon my servant to thee, that thou
[42:49] mayest recover him of his leprosy. And
[42:53] it came to pass when the king of Israel
[42:55] had read the letter that he rent his
[42:58] clothes and said, "Am I God to kill and
[43:03] to make alive that this man doth send
[43:06] unto me to recover a man of his
[43:09] leprosy? Wherefore consider, I pray you,
[43:13] and see how he seeketh a quarrel against
[43:16] me." And it was so. When Elisha the man
[43:20] of God have heard that the king of
[43:22] Israel had rent his clothes, that he
[43:25] sent to the king, saying, "Wherefore
[43:27] hast thou rent thy clothes? Let him come
[43:30] now to me, and he shall know that there
[43:33] is a prophet in
[43:35] Israel." Let's open Revelation chapter
[43:38] 10. We read in verse
[43:40] 7, one of our most popular scriptures.
[43:46] Revelation
[43:47] 10 and verse
[43:50] 7. But in the days of the voice of the
[43:53] seventh angel, when he shall begin to
[43:55] sound, the mystery of God should be
[43:57] finished, as he had declared to his
[44:00] servants, the prophets. The Lord add his
[44:02] blessing to the reading of his word.
[44:04] Amen. Let's take our seat, beloved.
[44:14] And so by the grace of God, the few
[44:16] minutes ahead of us, we want to talk on
[44:19] a subject when the supernatural is
[44:25] introduced. When the supernatural is
[44:29] introduced, when the supernatural is
[44:33] introduced, it goes beyond the laws of
[44:36] nature. That's right. Because it is
[44:39] supernatural. It is not natural.
[44:42] It goes beyond the laws of nature. It go
[44:46] beyond the capability of man.
[44:50] It goes beyond even science
[44:53] and any other thing that man has
[44:57] produced.
[44:59] Amen. But please don't don't be
[45:04] confused. Supernatural is not magic.
[45:09] Okay. Amen. People use some
[45:13] medium and they call it magic and they
[45:17] do so many
[45:18] things to confound people or their
[45:22] audience right but those things are done
[45:27] by you know occultism right and some
[45:30] demonic powers
[45:32] to put certain things together so that
[45:35] they can have favor of the people and
[45:38] that not what I'm talking about 's
[45:40] magic. I'm talking about the
[45:41] supernatural of God. Amen. Yes, sir.
[45:46] So, when the supernatural is introduced,
[45:48] then the power of God is bound to
[45:50] manifest.
[45:53] Now, this young girl, how the Bible put
[45:57] it, was taken, let's say, a slave or a
[46:01] captive when the Assyrians went to war
[46:04] with
[46:06] Israel. And this girl was taken to Syria
[46:09] and of course she became Nan's uh uh uh
[46:16] maid and she was serving Neman's wife.
[46:21] But the girl looked at the condition of
[46:24] her master
[46:27] Nean and she realized that no even
[46:32] though the master was a general of the
[46:35] Syrian army, a
[46:39] captain, but the lady realized that he
[46:45] was a leper.
[46:47] And you know leprosy is something
[46:51] that was not accepted at all in Israel.
[46:55] If you were a leper, you cannot be in a
[46:57] congregation. That's right. That's
[46:58] right. If you were a leper, you cannot
[47:00] be in a camp. If you remember carefully
[47:03] when um
[47:04] Miriam tried to mock
[47:07] Moses and the Lord struck her with
[47:10] leprosy, she was taken out from the camp
[47:12] for seven days till she was made clean.
[47:16] And in Israel when the leper is
[47:18] cleansed, the priest has to go and
[47:21] assess the person to to satisfy that the
[47:26] leprosy is completely clean and there
[47:28] will be an ordinance upon that person
[47:31] before he or she will be accepted back
[47:33] into the
[47:34] congregation. So it was something that
[47:36] was highly hated.
[47:38] So when this little girl saw the
[47:41] condition of the master, then she
[47:43] suggested quickly to the mistress, he
[47:46] said, "Whoa, if my master were to be in
[47:51] Samaria, there is a man of God there
[47:54] that can cure him of his
[47:57] leprosy." Praise be the name of our God.
[48:01] Now that was what the girl knew or that
[48:06] was what the maid knew that God could do
[48:09] in the life of her master
[48:13] nonh so immediately she talked about the
[48:17] power of
[48:19] God and when the letter I'm sorry when
[48:22] the king of Syria have heard about this
[48:25] then he also wrote a letter as a
[48:28] king and sent it to the other king in
[48:33] Israel and it was so much that when the
[48:37] king of Israel read the letter the Bible
[48:40] say that he
[48:41] cried, he rented his clothes and he was
[48:45] questioning himself that look at the way
[48:48] and manner the Syrian king is looking
[48:50] for
[48:51] peril. He want to just say come and
[48:53] fight with me. Am I God to heal? Am I
[48:59] God to create? Why will this man send
[49:03] such a mission to
[49:05] me? But brother and sister, you remember
[49:08] carefully that the girl did not
[49:10] introduce the king of Israel.
[49:14] Not even the soldiers of Israel, but he
[49:18] introduced the man of God. That was the
[49:21] introduction.
[49:23] And so the king of Israel started
[49:25] crying.
[49:27] Then the prophet Elisha got a hint of
[49:33] it. Then he went, he sent a messenger
[49:36] also to the king of
[49:38] Israel. And he
[49:43] said, "And it came to
[49:46] pass when the when the king of Israel
[49:49] had read the letter that he rent his
[49:52] clothes and said, am I God to kill and
[49:55] to make alive that this man do sent unto
[49:59] me to recover a man of his leprosy?
[50:03] Wherefore consider, I pray you and see
[50:05] how he seeketh a peril against
[50:09] me. But the king of Israel was not ready
[50:11] to
[50:13] fight.
[50:14] Hallelujah. And it was so when Elisha,
[50:17] the man of God, have heard that the king
[50:19] of Israel had rent his clothes, that he
[50:21] sent to the king, saying, "Wherefore
[50:23] thou rent thy clothes?
[50:25] Let him come to
[50:27] me and he shall know that there is a
[50:31] prophet in Israel.
[50:34] Hallelujah. That was the power of God
[50:38] upon the prophet Elijah.
[50:41] And that was what the girl in far away
[50:44] Syria introduced.
[50:46] He she knew that there is a supernatural
[50:50] performance in the ministry in the life
[50:52] of Elijah the prophet. That's right. So
[50:55] that was what she introduced.
[50:58] Hallelujah. So when Israel I'm sorry
[51:00] when Elijah also heard about the
[51:02] situation that the king of Israel was
[51:04] wailing and crying, he said, "No, bring
[51:06] the man to
[51:08] me and you know that there is a God in
[51:10] Israel."
[51:12] Oh brother, sister, I wish you know what
[51:15] God have made you to be. Hallelujah. I
[51:19] wish you know what God have made you to
[51:20] be. The prophet said that if God is to
[51:23] open our eyes to see the things that is
[51:25] surrounding us, oh my that is why we are
[51:29] not a people to to to live in fear. We
[51:34] are not a people to live in confusion.
[51:37] We are not a people to live as if we are
[51:40] ordinary. There are lot of supernatural
[51:43] element around us wherever we find
[51:45] ourselves. Hallelujah. Yes.
[51:50] And then the king of
[51:52] Israel directed
[51:55] Neymar and his entourage to go and see
[51:59] the prophet Elisha.
[52:02] Now when they got to the gate, the the
[52:05] prophet didn't even come
[52:07] out, but he sent his servant to go and
[52:10] tell
[52:11] Nema, "Go and dip yourself seven times
[52:15] in the Jordan River
[52:18] and your leprosy will leave."
[52:22] But when Neymar heard about this, the
[52:25] Bible said that he became
[52:27] offended. He became annoyed. He said, "I
[52:31] thought that the man that they are
[52:32] calling the man of God is going to come
[52:34] and meet me and place his hand on
[52:37] affected place." Oh
[52:41] brother, hallelujah. And charge that
[52:44] demon to leave me. But you have not even
[52:47] come to see my face. And he's commanding
[52:50] me to go and dip myself seven times in
[52:52] the Jordan River. Oh no, no, no, no. I
[52:54] can't do that. I can't do that. I mean
[52:57] there are beautiful waters and rivers in
[53:00] in Syria. River Papa is there. River
[53:03] Abana is there. Sweet waters very clean.
[53:07] Why don't I dip myself seven times in
[53:10] those rivers and be made whole? Elisha
[53:13] don't care about how clean the rivers of
[53:15] Syria was. Elisha care about where the
[53:19] power of God is. Hallelujah. And every
[53:22] believer, every child of God, you should
[53:24] not care about where you are, but you
[53:26] should care about the power of God that
[53:28] is in you. Yes, sir. Praise be the name
[53:31] of our God. Amen. And the leprosy neon
[53:35] became offended.
[53:38] What? Look at this
[53:40] man traveling to meet the man of God.
[53:44] And you have your own
[53:47] desires. When you come to God, put your
[53:50] desires away. Put your will away. Put
[53:54] yourself away and accept what God can
[53:57] give to you.
[53:59] Because he knows what is good for you.
[54:02] Hallelujah. He knows what exactly that
[54:05] is better for you. Sometime you can use
[54:07] your eyes to behold certain things. You
[54:10] wish, you wish, you wish, but that is
[54:12] not for you. God knows what is better
[54:13] for you.
[54:15] Praise be the name of our God.
[54:18] And the Bible say that he never became
[54:21] became so annoyed and wanted to go back
[54:24] to Syria with his leprosy. Oh man. Then
[54:28] uh the the the what do we call it the
[54:30] servants they said
[54:33] well they said well okay I should use
[54:37] this one. Okay. All right. So can I lose
[54:41] this? Okay. Amen.
[54:45] He said, they said
[54:59] Hallelujah.
[55:02] Are we alive?
[55:04] If you're alive, let me hear you say,
[55:06] "Amen."
[55:10] Whenever I come here, I want to feel
[55:12] like an African. You know what I'm
[55:13] saying?
[55:15] In Africa, the the fire is so hot,
[55:19] right? So if I come from the hot
[55:23] atmosphere, don't put me in the cold
[55:26] atmosphere.
[55:27] I don't like the snow. I want to only
[55:29] watch the show in the newspaper and then
[55:32] on the screens. I don't want the snow. I
[55:35] don't want to step on in the show.
[55:39] Hallelujah.
[55:41] Brother what happened was that neighbor
[55:44] became offended.
[55:48] You see there are certain times
[55:52] we are easily offended by little things
[55:57] and sometimes it push us back from the
[56:00] blessing that God have prepared for us.
[56:03] Let us be very careful as sons and
[56:05] daughters of God.
[56:07] Nema became
[56:08] offended. And then the servant said,
[56:12] "Boss, when we
[56:14] came, you brought enough
[56:18] money, you brought gold, you brought
[56:22] silver, you brought changeable
[56:25] apparels, but the man have not asked you
[56:29] of any."
[56:34] Okay? He didn't say that. give me
[56:36] $10,000 and I'll pray for you.
[56:39] No, he didn't say give me a bail of new
[56:43] uh suit. He didn't ask you any of that.
[56:46] He only said go and dip yourself seven
[56:49] times in the Jordan River. Boss, why
[56:52] don't you why don't you do that and let
[56:54] us see the
[56:56] results. Then of course at that point
[57:00] Neymar became so humble and that is
[57:04] good brother that is good sister that is
[57:07] good. Many of times we should be very
[57:10] careful
[57:11] that certain situation certain positions
[57:15] should not make us raise ourselves more
[57:18] than we should.
[57:21] Hallelujah. Because the key to open the
[57:24] door of God chamber is humility.
[57:28] That is the only key.
[57:31] And when Nema became so humble, he
[57:34] listening to the
[57:35] servants, he turned back to the Jordan
[57:37] River. Well, it was very dirty, but that
[57:40] was where the power of God is.
[57:44] Amen.
[57:47] He jumped into the into the
[57:50] river
[57:53] ch that is the Ephesian
[57:56] churches. He came back. He jumped the
[58:00] second one. Ch that is second church age
[58:03] the spa. He came back and he did that to
[58:06] the seventh church age which is Leicia.
[58:10] And the Bible say that the leprosy of
[58:14] Nema vanished
[58:17] and his body became like that of a
[58:20] newborn baby.
[58:23] Oh brother, sister, when the
[58:25] supernatural is introduced, the only
[58:28] thing you have to do is to accept it.
[58:32] And when you accept it, there shall be a
[58:35] performance in your life.
[58:37] I don't care wherever you be. I don't
[58:40] care the condition. The power of God
[58:43] must be born to manifest himself.
[58:48] Hallelujah.
[58:50] Neymar look at his wow. Is that Nema?
[58:54] Yes, that is Neymar.
[58:58] Brother, when we're in the world, there
[59:02] were so many lepros on us.
[59:05] M there were so many leprosy that we
[59:08] didn't know that there was leprosy upon
[59:10] us
[59:12] and when we came to the message in the
[59:15] initial stages we look to the way and
[59:17] manner we live we live we look to the
[59:20] way that we you know comport ourself in
[59:22] the churches in the Pentecostal realm
[59:25] and in the orthodox realm and we say
[59:27] that what kind of a message is this
[59:32] h well many people left the church
[59:35] because they realize that no, this
[59:38] message is like the Jordan River. They
[59:41] couldn't jump into it.
[59:44] Hallelujah.
[59:46] But thank God, some of us, we said,
[59:49] "Well, whether it's a clean river or
[59:52] not, we will try." Amen. And we jump
[59:55] into it. We jump into the message of the
[59:58] hour, and all our leprosy was clean.
[1:00:03] Hallelujah.
[1:00:05] Praise the name of our God. The little
[1:00:08] girl in far away
[1:00:12] Syria knew what God could do by the
[1:00:16] prophet.
[1:00:18] And so he in introduced the master
[1:00:22] Neymar to see that man of God.
[1:00:26] And that was a performance.
[1:00:31] Nema was thinking that he will see
[1:00:33] Elisha, but he didn't see Elisha.
[1:00:39] The little girl was in far away
[1:00:41] Syria and Elisha was in far away Israel,
[1:00:46] but it connected.
[1:00:49] When the girl introduced him as a man of
[1:00:53] God, the spirit of God in Elijah
[1:00:56] connected with that introduction.
[1:00:59] Amen. That is why when Nema came to the
[1:01:03] gate, he got to know the prophet said
[1:01:06] when the deep callth onto the deep,
[1:01:09] there must be a deep to respond to that.
[1:01:12] Hallelujah. It is your acceptance of the
[1:01:15] introduction that will make there be a
[1:01:18] performance in your life. Can I hear
[1:01:20] amen here?
[1:01:24] Amen is what I drink. Okay. I drink.
[1:01:27] Amen. I eat. Amen. I sleep. Amen.
[1:01:30] Everything I do, Amen.
[1:01:34] So if I'm preaching and you don't say
[1:01:35] amen, you make me feel asleep.
[1:01:39] Can I hear amen again? Amen.
[1:01:43] Hallelujah. Now once upon a time there
[1:01:47] was a young damel called
[1:01:49] Mary and uh she had a visitation.
[1:01:54] The Bible said that God sent angel
[1:01:56] Gabriel to Mary on one occasion to give
[1:02:01] her a
[1:02:03] message. And let me go quickly to Luke
[1:02:06] chapter 1. You can go there with me if
[1:02:09] you if you
[1:02:11] want. And
[1:02:13] then the
[1:02:15] angel told Mary, "Hail
[1:02:19] Mary, you are highly favored among
[1:02:21] women.
[1:02:24] For this that and this that and this
[1:02:26] that has God said about you. You are
[1:02:29] going to conceive and you bring forth a
[1:02:33] son and you call his name Jesus because
[1:02:37] he's going to save his
[1:02:38] people from
[1:02:41] sin. And you know it took Mary a back
[1:02:45] because at that time Mary was a virgin
[1:02:48] without a man.
[1:02:50] So she became so
[1:02:53] confused. She wanted to find out. She
[1:02:55] wanted to know why.
[1:02:59] And so she started asking the angels
[1:03:02] certain
[1:03:03] questions. He said verse
[1:03:09] 26, it was and it was revealed unto him
[1:03:13] by the Holy Ghost that he
[1:03:15] should Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm
[1:03:18] reading the wrong place.
[1:03:20] Okay. Luke chapter 1 verse uh
[1:03:26] 26. And in the sixth month, the angel
[1:03:29] Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of
[1:03:31] Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin
[1:03:35] espoused to a man whose name was Joseph
[1:03:38] of the house of
[1:03:39] David. And a virgin's name was Mary. And
[1:03:43] the angel came in unto her, and said,
[1:03:46] Hail, thou that are highly favored, the
[1:03:49] Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou
[1:03:52] among women. And when she saw him, she
[1:03:56] was troubled at his saying, and cast in
[1:03:59] her mind, what manner of salutation this
[1:04:02] shall be. The woman was the the lady
[1:04:06] Mary was wondering.
[1:04:09] And the angel said unto her, "Fear not,
[1:04:11] Mary, for thou hast found favor with
[1:04:15] God, and behold, thou shall conceive in
[1:04:18] thy
[1:04:19] womb." Okay, in thy womb. And the
[1:04:23] doctors have made us to understand
[1:04:26] that pregnancy take place in the
[1:04:28] Philippian tube before it is later
[1:04:30] transferred into the
[1:04:32] womb. And the Philippian that is where
[1:04:35] the male and female meet.
[1:04:38] But this was in the womb.
[1:04:44] No man, no woman.
[1:04:47] It was a supernatural pregnancy.
[1:04:52] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:04:56] Amen. And uh and when she saw
[1:05:00] him, oh, where am
[1:05:04] I? Okay. And thou, he said, "And he
[1:05:07] shall be great." He said, "And behold,
[1:05:09] thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and be
[1:05:12] and bring forth a son, and shall call
[1:05:14] his name Jesus. He shall be great, and
[1:05:17] shall be called the son of the highest.
[1:05:19] And the Lord God shall give unto him the
[1:05:22] throne of his father David. And he shall
[1:05:24] reign over the house of Jacob forever,
[1:05:27] and of his kingdom there shall be no
[1:05:29] end." Now listen to here. He said, "Then
[1:05:33] said Mary unto the angel, how shall this
[1:05:37] be, seeing I know not a
[1:05:40] man?" It was a genuine question. You
[1:05:44] said, "I'm going to get pregnant, but I
[1:05:45] don't have a
[1:05:47] man." Amen. And the angel answered and
[1:05:51] said unto her, "The Holy Ghost shall
[1:05:54] come upon thee, and the power of the
[1:05:57] highest shall overshadow thee. Therefore
[1:06:00] also that holy thing which shall be born
[1:06:03] of thee shall be called the son of God.
[1:06:08] Oh my. The angel introduced the
[1:06:10] supernatural of God upon the life of
[1:06:13] Mary because Mary wanted to find out how
[1:06:16] will this be? I am a virgin. I don't
[1:06:19] know any man. How can I be pregnant? And
[1:06:23] this was the introduction of the angel
[1:06:26] upon Mary.
[1:06:29] Ah, amen. And he said, "Behold, thy
[1:06:33] cousin
[1:06:34] Elizabeth, she hath also conceived a son
[1:06:37] in her old age, and this is the sixth
[1:06:40] month with her who was called barren.
[1:06:43] For with God nothing shall be
[1:06:45] impossible."
[1:06:48] For with God nothing shall be
[1:06:51] impossible.
[1:06:52] Elizabeth was also called a baron.
[1:06:57] But there was a supernatural
[1:07:00] that overshadow her and she got pregnant
[1:07:03] by the husband's career and Mary didn't
[1:07:06] know anything about it. So it was out of
[1:07:10] this communication between her and the
[1:07:11] angel. Then the angel revealed to Mary
[1:07:14] that your cousin Elizabeth is also
[1:07:18] pregnant. Hallelujah.
[1:07:20] So
[1:07:21] immediately Mary said,
[1:07:25] "Behold, the handmade of the Lord, be it
[1:07:28] unto me according to thy word."
[1:07:33] And the angel departed from her.
[1:07:37] That is how you will accept the power of
[1:07:40] God in your life. No doubt. Mary did not
[1:07:43] doubt it, but she said, "Let it be unto
[1:07:47] me according to the introduction that
[1:07:51] you have given to me that an
[1:07:53] angel as an angel, you are coming from
[1:07:57] God with this mission. Let it be
[1:08:00] manifested in my life."
[1:08:04] So
[1:08:05] immediately then the angel departed. And
[1:08:08] when the angel departed, brother, the
[1:08:11] Bible said that then Mary went straight
[1:08:13] to
[1:08:14] Judea because the angel said, "Your
[1:08:17] cousin Elizabeth whom everybody knew to
[1:08:20] be to be uh a barren or barren is also
[1:08:24] pregnant." So Mary wanted to go and find
[1:08:27] out for herself.
[1:08:29] And when she got to the town, went to
[1:08:33] the house of
[1:08:35] Elizabeth, she saw Elizabeth and he
[1:08:38] said, "Hey, Elizabeth,
[1:08:42] shalom." Before Elizabeth will respond,
[1:08:44] "Shalom," he said, "heey
[1:08:47] Mary, the moment my ear,"
[1:08:51] grabs the salutation
[1:08:54] from you, the child in me leap for joy.
[1:09:00] Oh, so it is true that you are pregnant.
[1:09:05] What a wonders of God. Hallelujah.
[1:09:10] Mary immediately as she communicated
[1:09:13] with the angel also got pregnant.
[1:09:18] Hallelujah.
[1:09:20] And then going to see
[1:09:22] Elizabeth was the
[1:09:24] seed the body of Jesus in Mary.
[1:09:28] Hallelujah.
[1:09:30] Supernaturally.
[1:09:32] And
[1:09:34] Elizabeth feeling the child kicking in
[1:09:39] her womb.
[1:09:41] Praise Mary for that.
[1:09:45] Hallelujah. He said, "Blessed art thou
[1:09:47] among women."
[1:09:51] John the Baptist was in the womb of
[1:09:55] Elizabeth sixth month.
[1:09:59] And Jesus was in the womb of
[1:10:03] Mary. I don't know how many
[1:10:05] hours. I don't know how many seconds. I
[1:10:08] don't know how many
[1:10:10] minutes. But was filled with the Holy
[1:10:14] Spirit right in the womb of her mother.
[1:10:18] Jesus baptizing John the Baptist right
[1:10:21] in the womb of her mother. That is the
[1:10:23] supernatural work of God.
[1:10:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It was an
[1:10:28] introduction. Yes. The power of God.
[1:10:32] Yes. The supremacy of God. Yes.
[1:10:35] Hallelujah. That God will always make
[1:10:38] himself to be known among his people.
[1:10:46] No
[1:10:47] wonder
[1:10:49] as
[1:10:50] Jesus introduced John the
[1:10:54] Baptist, John the Baptist introduced
[1:10:57] Jesus. Remember
[1:11:02] when she he baptized
[1:11:04] him, the Bible said the heavens
[1:11:08] open and he
[1:11:10] said, "This is my beloved
[1:11:14] son in whom I'm well pleased."
[1:11:17] But then God have already given the sign
[1:11:20] of Jesus to John the Baptist.
[1:11:23] He said the one that you baptize and the
[1:11:26] Holy Ghost will descend upon him like a
[1:11:28] dove. He is the one.
[1:11:32] And so John the Baptist introduced Jesus
[1:11:34] Christ. And we all know the power of
[1:11:37] Jesus Christ. What he came to do on this
[1:11:39] earth and all that to save you and I. My
[1:11:43] brother, my sister, it was all out of
[1:11:46] the power of God. The supernatural work
[1:11:49] of God. Brother, you and I, our
[1:11:51] salvation is made up of supernatural.
[1:11:56] Our salvation is not ordinary.
[1:12:00] That is why we need not to take it for
[1:12:02] granted.
[1:12:04] You are a special person before God.
[1:12:08] God designed you the way he want it.
[1:12:12] That is why you cannot change your
[1:12:14] condition.
[1:12:16] What he seems fit and dim that is what
[1:12:19] he gave to you.
[1:12:22] And we have to be appreciative.
[1:12:26] Hallelujah. The power of God is all over
[1:12:30] guiding the sons and daughters of God in
[1:12:33] this world that will not fall prey to
[1:12:37] the enemy.
[1:12:39] When the prophet William Maron Brown was
[1:12:42] on the scene, we saw so many wonderful
[1:12:45] things that God used him to do.
[1:12:48] Supernatural manifesting here and there.
[1:12:51] Bringing the dead back to life. Things
[1:12:53] that are, you know, impossible before
[1:12:55] man. They were all made possible
[1:12:58] because because the power of God has
[1:13:01] been introduced in the ministry of that
[1:13:04] man. Oh, today people don't want to
[1:13:06] mention his name. People don't want to
[1:13:07] hear about him. My Lord, let me tell you
[1:13:11] something. If I don't feel shy to
[1:13:14] mention Abraham's name, if I don't feel
[1:13:17] shy to mention uh John the Baptist name,
[1:13:20] if I don't feel shy to mention Paul's
[1:13:22] name, if I don't feel shy to mention
[1:13:24] Peter's name, why should I feel shy to
[1:13:26] mention William Mary Abraham's name?
[1:13:30] Hallelujah. Whether you believe it or
[1:13:32] not, he is the prophet of the age. Amen.
[1:13:36] Amen. Hallelujah. He said, "But in the
[1:13:38] days of the voice of the seventh angel,
[1:13:40] when it shall begin to sound, the
[1:13:42] mystery of God must be finished."
[1:13:45] Hallelujah. And when the sound of that
[1:13:49] seventh angel was sounded, brother,
[1:13:51] sister, it has produced you and have
[1:13:54] produced me. That's right. That's right.
[1:13:59] Praise God. Oh, hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:14:01] Jesus.
[1:14:02] I want to dip myself once again into the
[1:14:05] Jordan River.
[1:14:07] I want to be make clean and clean and
[1:14:10] clean always.
[1:14:13] The supernatural is always around us,
[1:14:15] brother, sister. And listen, let me tell
[1:14:18] this before I continue. Wherever you are
[1:14:21] as a child of God, you have to create
[1:14:23] the supernatural around you.
[1:14:26] I want to hear a big amen here.
[1:14:29] Did you hear that? I said wherever you
[1:14:32] are, you have to create the supernatural
[1:14:35] around you.
[1:14:37] In fact, be conscious that the
[1:14:39] supernatural is around you. It doesn't
[1:14:42] matter whether you are in Michigan or
[1:14:44] whether you are in Ohio or whether you
[1:14:46] are in South Africa or whether you are
[1:14:48] in India, wherever you are, because this
[1:14:52] little girl was even a slave. Yes. in a
[1:14:55] different country.
[1:14:57] But that did not suppress her his her
[1:15:00] faith. That did not take her faith away
[1:15:04] from her.
[1:15:05] She said if this man were to be in
[1:15:11] Israel, the Lord will cure him from his
[1:15:14] leprosy. That was the power of God.
[1:15:16] Brother, sister, you have to create the
[1:15:18] atmosphere of the supernatural around
[1:15:20] you wherever you are.
[1:15:22] Amen.
[1:15:24] I don't care the condition. I don't care
[1:15:26] who who who are you know frustrating
[1:15:28] you. I don't care who are disagreeing
[1:15:31] with you. Create it anyhow.
[1:15:34] Amen. Create it anyhow.
[1:15:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:15:41] when
[1:15:43] Moses killed an Egyptian soldier and was
[1:15:47] run away from uh
[1:15:50] Egypt to perhaps maybe to find refuge
[1:15:53] somewhere. He was going to a refugee
[1:15:57] camp. He didn't know that the
[1:16:00] supernatural God was waiting for him on
[1:16:02] the mountain.
[1:16:04] He didn't have any
[1:16:06] idea until one day on the
[1:16:11] mountain he heard his name mentioned
[1:16:14] Moses.
[1:16:16] Moses he turned
[1:16:19] around because he
[1:16:22] saw a
[1:16:23] bush
[1:16:25] burning without any smoke
[1:16:29] and the leaves were not being consumed.
[1:16:33] What an attraction, isn't it? The
[1:16:36] supernatural.
[1:16:38] It was.
[1:16:40] So the Bible said that Moses turned
[1:16:41] around to look at it
[1:16:43] carefully. What kind of a sin is this?
[1:16:46] Then his name was mentioned from that
[1:16:48] fire.
[1:16:50] He said, I am the God of your fathers,
[1:16:53] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[1:16:57] Then immediately Moses bowed down.
[1:17:00] He said, "Remove thy
[1:17:01] sanders." Well, where you are standing
[1:17:04] is a supernatural ground.
[1:17:08] You've run away from
[1:17:09] Egypt, but you are going back to
[1:17:13] Egypt. If you run away from
[1:17:16] responsibility, God will send you back
[1:17:18] to the responsibility.
[1:17:21] True. Amen.
[1:17:23] Moses tried it. God sent him back.
[1:17:26] That's right. Jonah tried it. God sent
[1:17:30] him back. Paul tried it. God sent him
[1:17:33] back. That's right. In fact, if you were
[1:17:35] a child of God, any mission that God put
[1:17:39] on your hand, you cannot run away from
[1:17:41] it.
[1:17:43] That's right, sir. Some of us, we didn't
[1:17:45] know that one day we'll stand behind the
[1:17:46] puppet and preach to the people of God.
[1:17:50] Run away 10,000 times, God will bring
[1:17:53] you 10,000 times. Amen. He said Moses
[1:17:57] you are going back to Egypt. Say for
[1:18:00] what? I just run away from that place.
[1:18:04] He said no problem. You have to go
[1:18:07] back. You are going to bring my people.
[1:18:10] He said no God I can't do that. He said
[1:18:12] no you can do it.
[1:18:15] He said what is in your hand? He said
[1:18:16] it's a rod. He said cut on the ground
[1:18:19] and it turned into a
[1:18:21] serpent. He said take it back. Now look
[1:18:25] at the supernatural of God. He said,
[1:18:27] "Take it by the
[1:18:29] tail." Can you touch a snake by the
[1:18:33] tail? You'll be dead, my brother.
[1:18:37] It will turn around and stink you
[1:18:38] immediately. But God said, "Take it by
[1:18:42] the tail."
[1:18:44] That is a
[1:18:45] supernatural. That God of supernatural,
[1:18:49] that was that God that Moses was
[1:18:50] worshiping. And he pick the serpent and
[1:18:54] he turned back to the rod.
[1:18:56] He said, "Put your hand in your bosom."
[1:18:58] He put it back. Bring it out. It was
[1:19:01] full of leprosy. He said, "No, no, no,
[1:19:03] no, no. God, no, no, no, no." He said,
[1:19:04] "Put it back." He put it back. Bring it
[1:19:08] out. And it was clean. He said, "These
[1:19:10] are the two supernatural signs I'm
[1:19:12] giving to you. Go to Is Egypt. If they
[1:19:16] don't believe the first sign, they will
[1:19:18] believe the second one." That's right.
[1:19:20] Oh my.
[1:19:21] Moses didn't know anything to do to
[1:19:24] excuse himself out of that. So he has to
[1:19:28] give up and he went to
[1:19:31] Egypt. When he went to Egypt with his
[1:19:34] brother Aaron before
[1:19:37] Pharaoh say
[1:19:38] Pharaoh, thus sayeth the Lord, let my
[1:19:42] people go.
[1:19:44] Pharaoh said, "Who is that God that I
[1:19:49] should obey?" Oh, you want to know that
[1:19:52] God? Then Moses said, "Aaron, cast my
[1:19:55] rod again on the
[1:19:57] ground." And he cast the rod. And he
[1:20:00] turned to serpent again. And all the
[1:20:03] magicians and the Egyptians were
[1:20:05] laughing because they knew that Jennis
[1:20:09] and Gres could do something to them
[1:20:12] better.
[1:20:13] So they called Jennis and Jamres, come
[1:20:15] on, come on, come on, come on, come over
[1:20:17] here, magicians. They were magicians.
[1:20:20] But Moses was not a magician. That's the
[1:20:23] two different things.
[1:20:25] They cast their rod and their rod also
[1:20:28] turned into snake and they were laughing
[1:20:31] at Moses. But what they didn't know was
[1:20:34] that that of Moses was going to swallow
[1:20:37] both. Amen. That's right. And Moses ro
[1:20:40] swallowed that of Jennis and Jambage and
[1:20:43] he took it back.
[1:20:45] Until
[1:20:46] today, their rod is still in the rod of
[1:20:49] Moses.
[1:20:51] Hallelujah. They are imprisoned.
[1:20:53] Hallelujah. So, brother, to cut the
[1:20:56] things short, you know that story
[1:20:57] already.
[1:20:59] Then when Pharaoh was proving stubborn,
[1:21:01] we saw all those supernatural plagues
[1:21:04] that came upon Egypt until their
[1:21:07] firstborn was that, you know, were dead.
[1:21:10] And then he said, "Okay, get out from my
[1:21:12] country. Go, go, go, go, go out from my
[1:21:13] country with your
[1:21:15] troubles." And Israel packed their bag
[1:21:18] and baggage and left
[1:21:22] Egypt. And when they
[1:21:25] went some days or some I mean hours and
[1:21:29] whatever it was, Pharaoh came back to
[1:21:33] him. He said, "What what have we done by
[1:21:36] allowing our slaves to leave
[1:21:38] us? Who are going to do our work for
[1:21:41] us? My
[1:21:44] soldiers organize the
[1:21:47] chariots. We are chasing them and we are
[1:21:49] bringing them back."
[1:21:54] Huh. But then
[1:21:57] Israel were also getting close to the
[1:22:01] Red
[1:22:02] Sea. And when they got to the Red Sea,
[1:22:06] they started asking Moses questions.
[1:22:09] Moses, you've brought us
[1:22:12] here. And there is no submarine to carry
[1:22:14] us
[1:22:15] across. There is no ship to carry us
[1:22:18] across.
[1:22:20] There is no pontoon to carry us across.
[1:22:23] Moses, we don't know how to swim. How
[1:22:26] are we going to cross? And the Bible say
[1:22:28] that they started crying
[1:22:31] and
[1:22:32] especially when they turn around and
[1:22:36] they see the dust that rose in the
[1:22:39] atmosphere as a result of the chariots
[1:22:42] and the soldiers of Pharaoh chasing
[1:22:44] them. Right? They cried and cried and
[1:22:47] cried the more and said, "Moses, are
[1:22:51] there no graves in Egypt that you have
[1:22:53] brought us here to die? This is what we
[1:22:56] told you. Allow us to continue to be
[1:23:00] slaves for the Egyptians."
[1:23:05] Brother, sister, don't never have that
[1:23:07] mind.
[1:23:09] That mind is a mind of unbelief.
[1:23:13] Amen. No matter your
[1:23:15] trials, no matter your
[1:23:17] temptations, no matter your difficulties
[1:23:20] that you are facing as a result of
[1:23:22] believing this message, they are all for
[1:23:24] a purpose. Sometimes the situation that
[1:23:28] you found yourself in, you will not
[1:23:30] enjoy it. Sometime is very painful.
[1:23:32] Okay? But do not discourage yourself.
[1:23:35] You have to know that God has it for a
[1:23:38] purpose. If only you are a child of God.
[1:23:42] They were crying because they realized
[1:23:44] that if the Egyptians come they they
[1:23:47] were
[1:23:48] finished. And so they cried and cried
[1:23:51] and Moses also started to cry. And God
[1:23:53] said, "Moses, why are you crying?"
[1:23:58] Oh, sometimes good to cry because at
[1:24:00] least you have to release some tears
[1:24:01] from your eye.
[1:24:05] But he was crying because he saw a
[1:24:09] challenge that was beyond him. But
[1:24:12] brother, if you see any challenge be
[1:24:14] beyond you, raise your eyes and see look
[1:24:18] to the almighty God.
[1:24:21] Hallelujah.
[1:24:23] Moses didn't have this as an example.
[1:24:26] But today we have Moses as our example.
[1:24:29] The mistake of Moses, we will not do it.
[1:24:31] Right. That's right. He cried instead of
[1:24:34] raising his eyes unto the Lord. And God
[1:24:37] said, Moses, tell the Israelites to go
[1:24:40] forward.
[1:24:42] Oh God, we are already at the Red Sea,
[1:24:46] at the banks of the Red Sea. If we go
[1:24:48] forward, how are we going to
[1:24:50] go? We don't know how to swim. And there
[1:24:54] is no ship for us to carry us across.
[1:24:57] Should we go forward? God said, go
[1:24:59] forward.
[1:25:01] Hallelujah. He said, "Go forward." That
[1:25:04] was the instruction.
[1:25:06] Just accept it. Like how Mary accepted
[1:25:09] it. He said, "Let it be unto me
[1:25:11] according to your word."
[1:25:15] Hallelujah. Just accept it, brother. God
[1:25:17] said, "Go forward." They didn't know
[1:25:19] what God was going to do, but God knew
[1:25:22] what he was going to do.
[1:25:24] Amen. Then you see God allow the
[1:25:27] Egyptian to get
[1:25:29] closer because we wanted to show his
[1:25:32] powers in the life of the Israelites and
[1:25:35] also in the life of the Egyptians
[1:25:37] depending upon which camp you are. I
[1:25:40] rather choose to be at the camp of God.
[1:25:42] Hallelujah. And I know you choose that
[1:25:44] one also. Yes. So when they were just
[1:25:48] close to catch them
[1:25:50] up, then they saw the pillar of
[1:25:54] fire hovering out over them, hovering
[1:25:58] over them and stood between them and the
[1:26:02] enemy.
[1:26:04] Ah, perhaps that was the first time an
[1:26:06] Israeli was watching the pillar of fire
[1:26:10] in display.
[1:26:12] Have you seen the pillar of fire in
[1:26:14] display?
[1:26:16] I want you to tell me yes.
[1:26:19] Hallelujah. Because the prophet said
[1:26:22] wherever the message of this hour will
[1:26:24] be preached, the pillar of fire will be
[1:26:27] around. So this morning without any
[1:26:29] doubt in me, I know the pillar of fire
[1:26:32] is hanging over you here right now.
[1:26:35] Hallelujah. Amen. So he stood between
[1:26:38] the Israelites and
[1:26:40] Egyptians to block them from attacking
[1:26:43] Israel. When their chariots want to go
[1:26:46] this way, the pillar of fire will move
[1:26:48] to block them. When they go to the other
[1:26:51] side, the pillar of fire will move to
[1:26:52] block them. And it was so till Egyptian
[1:26:56] became so confused.
[1:26:58] God said,
[1:26:59] "Moses, it is time to cross
[1:27:02] over. stretch your
[1:27:04] rod upon the
[1:27:07] sea. And Moses did that
[1:27:10] exactly. Well, I don't care how many
[1:27:12] hours it took. I don't care how many
[1:27:15] days it took, but what I know that God
[1:27:19] parted the river or the sea for Israel
[1:27:22] to cross over. And look at it. Look at
[1:27:25] the supernatural way God did
[1:27:28] it. The Red Sea has been there since
[1:27:31] creation.
[1:27:33] And you cannot determine the volume of
[1:27:36] mud beneath.
[1:27:39] Okay. Even when it rain go and see I
[1:27:43] mean over there behind the the building
[1:27:46] the place will be muddy. Is that not it?
[1:27:48] So so so so look at it from creation the
[1:27:51] rescue were there the volume of mud but
[1:27:55] God made that place to turn into a dry
[1:27:59] ground.
[1:28:02] Hallelujah.
[1:28:05] Beloved, I'm giving you an assurance
[1:28:08] this morning.
[1:28:11] The prophet said, "Anywhere you go and
[1:28:15] you go with the Lord Jesus Christ, there
[1:28:18] is no danger."
[1:28:20] Can I hear amen?
[1:28:22] Any place you go with Jesus Christ with
[1:28:25] you, there is no danger. Praise the
[1:28:28] Lord. So the Lord dried the
[1:28:31] ground beneath the Red Sea dried like
[1:28:36] this surface.
[1:28:38] And the Bible said that Israel walk on a
[1:28:41] dry ground.
[1:28:47] H
[1:28:49] majestically they walk on a dry ground.
[1:28:53] No
[1:28:54] mud. But what happened to the Egyptians?
[1:28:58] They realize you see brother Abraham
[1:29:01] said wherever the Holy Ghost is not
[1:29:05] their people behave like animals.
[1:29:08] True. And that was exactly what
[1:29:10] Egyptians exhibited.
[1:29:13] You have changed this Israel and God
[1:29:16] have destroyed you on several occasion
[1:29:19] by turning your rivers into blood by
[1:29:22] bringing locust to disturb your crops. I
[1:29:24] mean and even the death of your
[1:29:26] firstborns. Why are you still chasing
[1:29:28] these people?
[1:29:31] You are not wise.
[1:29:34] You are not
[1:29:36] wise. And opposite of wisdom is what?
[1:29:40] Well, I will not say it. You have to say
[1:29:42] it.
[1:29:43] Praise be the name of our God. They
[1:29:46] wanted to follow Israel
[1:29:48] to cross the Red Sea on that dry ground.
[1:29:52] No, no, brother, sister. The dry ground
[1:29:55] was not made for the Egyptians, but the
[1:29:58] dry ground was made for the Israelites.
[1:30:02] Hallelujah. Any trail that the Lord has
[1:30:05] made for you is not meant for the enemy.
[1:30:09] Amen. So when the Egyptians try to
[1:30:11] follow Israel in that trail, the Bible
[1:30:14] says that they rode their chariots
[1:30:17] heavily.
[1:30:19] They rode it heavily. They didn't write
[1:30:21] it like how Israel rode it in, you know,
[1:30:24] freely. They rode it
[1:30:27] heavily. You know why? Because after the
[1:30:31] Israelites pass on or they cross over,
[1:30:36] then the dry ground that they walk on,
[1:30:40] it turned back into mud.
[1:30:43] That is why the Egyptians rode their
[1:30:46] chariot heavily. Right.
[1:30:48] God made a way for Israel and not for
[1:30:52] Egypt.
[1:30:54] So if the enemy were trying to pass
[1:30:57] through that same channel to destroy
[1:30:59] them, their legs and their chariots will
[1:31:02] stuck in those mud. Hallelujah.
[1:31:05] In fact, any enemy, any enemy, I say any
[1:31:10] enemy that will try to chase you, they
[1:31:14] are less will talk in the mud.
[1:31:17] Because God have made a channel for you,
[1:31:20] his son and his daughter.
[1:31:27] Is that clear?
[1:31:29] So
[1:31:31] Israel
[1:31:33] my and the Bible even says that when the
[1:31:36] Egyptians were passing through here to
[1:31:38] wanted to cross over uh by the pillar of
[1:31:41] fire, it said then the Lord looked to
[1:31:43] the Egyptians through the pillar of
[1:31:45] fire. The Lord look at them. He aimed at
[1:31:48] them like a
[1:31:50] banicos on your
[1:31:52] rifle. You are aiming at a target to
[1:31:56] shoot. And that was what God did against
[1:31:59] the Egyptians. He said, "Oh, these
[1:32:01] people, I will swallow all of them up in
[1:32:04] the river in the sea. You wait and see."
[1:32:06] And that was God what was doing. And
[1:32:09] when Israel crossed over, the last
[1:32:12] person crossed over to the banks of the
[1:32:15] Red Sea, the Egyptians were almost in
[1:32:18] the middle. And then God said,
[1:32:21] "You say your last prayer
[1:32:27] and he released the sea and it swallowed
[1:32:30] all the enemies." That's right brother
[1:32:34] and my sister. God has made us
[1:32:38] supernatural beings.
[1:32:41] That's true. That is why we have the
[1:32:43] power to create. Amen.
[1:32:46] You think that is a common thing for you
[1:32:50] to lay hands upon the sick and pray for
[1:32:52] them for them to recover is
[1:32:54] supernatural.
[1:32:58] Hallelujah. God have given us that power
[1:33:00] because that is what he has poured upon
[1:33:02] us. We are anointed by the supernatural.
[1:33:07] Brother Abraham works so many tireless
[1:33:10] so many things in his
[1:33:12] ministry. And we are the continuation of
[1:33:15] that ministry.
[1:33:17] So as he was
[1:33:20] yesterday, so shall he be today and so
[1:33:23] shall be she be forever. that the Lord
[1:33:25] Jesus Christ he changeth not. Can I hear
[1:33:30] amen from you brothers?
[1:33:32] Can I hear amen from you sisters?
[1:33:35] I hope nobody is sleeping
[1:33:39] because you cannot sleep under the
[1:33:40] anointing of the supernatural.
[1:33:44] That is where God has put us. And when
[1:33:47] they cross over because victory has
[1:33:48] come, the Bible said that the Moses sang
[1:33:51] a song and all the congregation sank and
[1:33:55] Miriam took her tumbling going about
[1:33:57] with the women and her sisters and they
[1:33:59] were singing and I mean they were
[1:34:00] shaking themselves to the glory of
[1:34:02] God because the supernatural has been
[1:34:05] made manifest in their lives.
[1:34:10] Amen.
[1:34:16] He said, "The little girl never said a
[1:34:18] word about the
[1:34:19] king. She spoke about the prophet."
[1:34:22] Amen. Oh, I hope you see
[1:34:26] it. My She spoke of the prophet. Maybe
[1:34:31] she never seen a case of leprosy healed,
[1:34:33] but she knew where someone live under
[1:34:36] that atmosphere of the supernatural.
[1:34:40] If you go over there, something will
[1:34:44] take
[1:34:47] place. If you go over there, something
[1:34:51] will take place.
[1:34:53] I thank God for this message.
[1:34:57] I say this to the glory of God.
[1:35:02] It was when we came to believe this
[1:35:06] message be before we felt within
[1:35:10] us that we are Christians.
[1:35:16] It was when we came to believe the
[1:35:18] message of this hour when we dip
[1:35:21] ourselves into this
[1:35:23] message then we knew that not knowing we
[1:35:28] were sons and daughters of God before
[1:35:30] the foundation of the world.
[1:35:36] Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:35:40] And Jesus
[1:35:41] said Jesus
[1:35:44] vindicated him at the greatest. And he's
[1:35:46] talking about John the
[1:35:48] Baptist. He said greater than Elijah,
[1:35:51] greater than any of the rest of them.
[1:35:54] John was because he introduced the
[1:35:57] Messiah. The rest of them prophesied of
[1:36:00] him coming.
[1:36:01] But he said, "Behold the lamb of God
[1:36:05] that takes away the sins of the world."
[1:36:08] He had the privilege of introducing to
[1:36:12] the world the
[1:36:13] [Music]
[1:36:16] Messiah. And John knew him because there
[1:36:19] was a sign following
[1:36:21] him, the supernatural.
[1:36:24] And anywhere in God's word where Jesus
[1:36:27] appears or the Holy Spirit appears,
[1:36:31] supernatural is there.
[1:36:36] Hallelujah. That is why we can't get our
[1:36:38] church into dead
[1:36:40] theological ideas. That's right. Because
[1:36:44] when the supernatural is
[1:36:46] introduced, it go beyond the human
[1:36:49] thought.
[1:36:51] In fact, it go beyond the riches of this
[1:36:53] world.
[1:36:55] It go beyond any degree you think you
[1:36:58] can get.
[1:37:01] I respect the
[1:37:04] degrees. I respect the PhDs.
[1:37:08] I respect uh h uh what do we call it?
[1:37:12] The
[1:37:13] www. I respect the
[1:37:15] BMWs. I respect the I mean every kind of
[1:37:19] alphabetical
[1:37:21] degrees I respect it but the
[1:37:25] supernatural always go beyond that. Can
[1:37:28] I hear amen? The supernatural goes
[1:37:31] beyond those elements.
[1:37:35] And that is where I want to be in the
[1:37:38] supernatural of God.
[1:37:41] Amen.
[1:37:44] Listen to what the prophet said.
[1:37:47] He said there was another one down there
[1:37:49] named
[1:37:50] Daniel. Abraham's seed. What happened to
[1:37:54] him? He stayed true to God. He knew that
[1:37:58] he was the seed of Abraham. He knew he
[1:38:01] was doing right. They threw him into the
[1:38:04] lion's den. And a supernatural
[1:38:08] light, a supernatural light, a
[1:38:11] supernatural angel came down by a man
[1:38:14] that believed in
[1:38:16] supernatural and supernatural delivered
[1:38:20] him. And he stay all night in the lion's
[1:38:23] den and was supernaturally brought out
[1:38:26] the next morning because he believed and
[1:38:30] trusted in the supernatural God.
[1:38:34] and he possessed the gate of the lion's
[1:38:37] den. Hallelujah. So if you believe the
[1:38:40] supernatural of God, you will also be
[1:38:43] surrounded by the supernatural power.
[1:38:46] Hallelujah.
[1:38:50] Amen.
[1:38:53] I have a brother at home
[1:38:55] and he is a police
[1:38:58] officer and he was transferred to a
[1:39:01] village
[1:39:02] somewhere and that
[1:39:05] place they are not one you know tribe
[1:39:09] rise against tribe and sometimes they
[1:39:11] are almost every time problems problem
[1:39:13] down there.
[1:39:14] And this brother was such
[1:39:16] that he went to that
[1:39:19] post with his Jesus in him.
[1:39:24] You can you cannot give him bribe. No,
[1:39:29] he will not take it because sometimes
[1:39:32] the folks want to bribe you so that they
[1:39:35] will be at liberty to do anything they
[1:39:37] want to do. Not this brother. Amen.
[1:39:41] He rejected and refused it as many times
[1:39:44] at it came to him.
[1:39:46] Not knowing he has created enemies to
[1:39:49] himself. So one day there was a
[1:39:52] confusion between these two groups and
[1:39:57] fortunately and unfortunately he was the
[1:39:59] one that his commander you know ask him
[1:40:02] to go and settle that matter. So when he
[1:40:05] got to the place and the people saw him,
[1:40:08] they said, "Oh, is that
[1:40:11] you?
[1:40:14] Good. Today we are going to kill
[1:40:18] you for
[1:40:21] what?" Then the brother
[1:40:24] realized that they meant what they
[1:40:28] said. They were approaching him with
[1:40:31] their canvases and their, you know,
[1:40:33] sticks and all that. They were in their
[1:40:36] hands. And he said, "Pastor, then I
[1:40:39] prayed
[1:40:40] silently and asked God,
[1:40:44] Lord, is this your
[1:40:47] will? Is this the way you want me to
[1:40:51] leave the earth? Then glory be to thy
[1:40:54] name."
[1:40:56] And he said, "Amen." Silently. Yes. He
[1:40:59] said the moment he said amen,
[1:41:03] then all of a sudden the people stopped
[1:41:05] approaching
[1:41:06] him and then they started going one by
[1:41:09] one. They started going one by one and
[1:41:12] they left him alone there.
[1:41:15] Hallelujah. And so when
[1:41:19] Yes sir. When he told me, I said, "Whoa,
[1:41:22] this remind me of Jesus with the
[1:41:26] Pharisees." When they brought that woman
[1:41:28] out of court in adultery, when they were
[1:41:31] trying to tempt Jesus, he said,
[1:41:33] "According to the law, she must be
[1:41:36] killed." And Jesus said, "You who among
[1:41:40] this people without sin cast the first
[1:41:43] stone."
[1:41:45] And none of them was able to do that.
[1:41:48] But the Bible say that they started
[1:41:50] going one by one. One by one, why by
[1:41:54] one? Brother, sister, whatever Jesus
[1:41:56] Christ is, I say there is no danger.
[1:42:01] So I said, brother, we'll pray for
[1:42:04] you that the Lord will cause
[1:42:09] your seniors or whatever your your I
[1:42:11] mean your headquarters to transfer you
[1:42:13] from that place. And indeed the Lord
[1:42:16] heard it and he was transferred.
[1:42:20] But
[1:42:21] unfortunately where he was transferred
[1:42:23] to was another war zone.
[1:42:28] Oh brother, sister don't be disturbed.
[1:42:33] The Bible says that when you fall into
[1:42:36] diverse temptations
[1:42:38] Hallelujah. That is scripture. He didn't
[1:42:41] say only one trial bro.
[1:42:44] He said diverse and diverse means many
[1:42:50] many with different colors.
[1:42:53] You can be in a temptation today, God
[1:42:55] will bring you out. Tomorrow you go into
[1:42:57] another one, God will bring you out.
[1:42:58] Tomorrow you go into another one, God
[1:43:00] will bring you out and you can continue.
[1:43:02] Yes. The only thing you have
[1:43:06] to make sure of that you are always with
[1:43:10] Jesus Christ. And he who saw you from
[1:43:14] the one the first one will see you from
[1:43:16] the second one. He will see you from the
[1:43:18] third one. So victory is won.
[1:43:24] When he was taken to the other side
[1:43:26] horrible brother horrible condition. It
[1:43:28] was the same thing. You see the people
[1:43:30] always want to be friends with the
[1:43:32] police so that excuse me to use this
[1:43:35] word their
[1:43:37] foolishness will not be exposed that is
[1:43:40] why everybody want to be a friend of the
[1:43:42] police but I know America here is not
[1:43:43] like that is that yeah you can't be a
[1:43:46] friend to the police but over down there
[1:43:49] everybody want to be a friend to the
[1:43:50] police and that is this what this
[1:43:52] brother
[1:43:53] hated and that side
[1:43:56] also the address of the down. When they
[1:44:00] realize that they could not bribe this
[1:44:02] guy, then they started sending women.
[1:44:07] Yes, sir. Women to try to for him. You
[1:44:12] understand? And the women different
[1:44:14] shapes. The tall, the short, the big,
[1:44:18] the slim. I mean I mean you you can
[1:44:22] imagine different size. I mean this one
[1:44:25] will go he branch another one he he you
[1:44:27] he kicked all of them up
[1:44:32] until one day he was in the
[1:44:36] office and a young man came to him said
[1:44:41] I am looking for officer so and so and
[1:44:45] he called this brother sister Rachel
[1:44:48] when the brother when he didn't know the
[1:44:50] man he was a complete stranger
[1:44:53] say who say I know you don't know me but
[1:44:57] please I am here to ask you a
[1:45:01] question which idol do you
[1:45:05] worship then the brother said what
[1:45:09] idol I don't worship any idol he said no
[1:45:12] be honest with
[1:45:13] me I want to know I want you to make me
[1:45:16] your friend that is why I want to find
[1:45:19] out which idol do you worship ship. The
[1:45:22] brother said, "No, I don't worship
[1:45:24] Enaldo, but if you want to know what I
[1:45:27] worship, I worship Jesus Christ."
[1:45:30] By the spoken word of God.
[1:45:34] Hallelujah. Then the man looked at thy
[1:45:37] brother and he said, "Sir, you know why
[1:45:40] I'm here?" He said, "No." He said, "I am
[1:45:44] a witch
[1:45:46] doctor and some of the elders of this
[1:45:48] town brought you to me that I should
[1:45:51] kill
[1:45:53] you." But I've tried and tried and tried
[1:45:59] and tried all the the the you know
[1:46:03] instruments that I know I've tried it on
[1:46:06] you but I am not able.
[1:46:12] That is why I came to ask you what kind
[1:46:17] of idol do you worship? Perhaps it is
[1:46:22] more than what I have. He said I have
[1:46:25] many of them but I inherited it from my
[1:46:27] father and I am confessing to you that I
[1:46:30] have used that idol to kill a lot of
[1:46:32] people.
[1:46:34] So I thought that I would do the same
[1:46:35] thing on you but I've tried and tried
[1:46:38] and tried and tried Hallelujah.
[1:46:42] I couldn't do it.
[1:46:44] Hallelujah. And the brother said, "Yes,
[1:46:46] because I serve a living God. I serve a
[1:46:50] living God. I have the supernatural God
[1:46:52] always around me. He not only around me,
[1:46:56] but he is in me."
[1:47:01] Hallelujah. My brother, my
[1:47:04] sister, we are not ordinary people. Are
[1:47:07] the world see users? If you are
[1:47:09] believing this message, continue to
[1:47:11] believe this message. But this message
[1:47:14] will make you who you supposed to be.
[1:47:18] Hallelujah.
[1:47:22] Praise God. We are closing. Okay, let me
[1:47:24] see the time. I don't want to take too
[1:47:26] much of your time.
[1:47:29] It is
[1:47:30] said that during the world war I'm not
[1:47:34] clear whether the first or the second
[1:47:35] but I think the second there was a
[1:47:40] soldier
[1:47:42] among one of the I mean groups who was a
[1:47:47] Christian and uh you know when you are a
[1:47:51] Christian you are not a
[1:47:53] hypocrite when you a Christian you must
[1:47:55] be a Christian not only in the
[1:47:58] But in your workplace, in your school
[1:48:01] compasses, in your in your holiday
[1:48:04] making, you must remain a Christian.
[1:48:07] Amen.
[1:48:09] So this soldier was a Christian even at
[1:48:12] the battlefield.
[1:48:14] And he demonstrated to the colleagues
[1:48:17] that he was a
[1:48:20] Christian. He did not drink their beer.
[1:48:24] He did not smoke their cigarettes.
[1:48:26] and uh he did not go for the women that
[1:48:29] they went
[1:48:31] for. He lived a
[1:48:33] Christian and it didn't go well with the
[1:48:36] colleagues and even the
[1:48:38] commander you know so one
[1:48:40] day not knowing the commander and the
[1:48:44] colleagues have you know thought of
[1:48:46] making fun of this young soldier. So he
[1:48:50] called on Parra and then he handed a car
[1:48:55] a car key to this young man
[1:48:59] that the jeep that is parked there take
[1:49:03] it and park it at the other
[1:49:05] side. And the soldier said sir I don't
[1:49:08] know how to
[1:49:09] drive. Then the commander said, "Well,
[1:49:13] let your so-called
[1:49:15] God teach you how to drive whether you
[1:49:18] like it or not. Take the jeep, pack it
[1:49:21] at the other
[1:49:22] side." Then the soldier took the key and
[1:49:25] saluted the commander. You know, you
[1:49:26] know how the soldiers
[1:49:32] do. and he opened the
[1:49:34] door and he jumped into the
[1:49:37] car and he sparked the engine.
[1:49:43] somebody who don't know how to
[1:49:45] drive. But that particular moment, he
[1:49:48] was able to take the
[1:49:49] gear and
[1:49:51] drove and park exactly as the commander
[1:49:56] requested. And then he off the engine
[1:50:00] and he was
[1:50:03] coming stood in front of the
[1:50:07] commander and handed over the key to
[1:50:09] him. But what he saw was that the
[1:50:13] commander was
[1:50:15] crying, was sharing
[1:50:17] tears and he turned around to look. All
[1:50:20] the colleagues were also sharing tears.
[1:50:23] What is going
[1:50:25] on? What is going
[1:50:27] on? Then the commander removed his heart
[1:50:31] and put it on his bosom. It's a
[1:50:35] m the jeep that you just drove and you
[1:50:39] park over there. There is no engine in
[1:50:42] the jeep.
[1:50:44] Can I hear amen? Can I hear amen from
[1:50:47] you? Hallelujah. He said there is no
[1:50:50] engine in the
[1:50:53] jeep. And the commander went to the jeep
[1:50:57] with mud and they opened the bonnet.
[1:51:01] Indeed, there was no engine in the jeep.
[1:51:06] He said, "How did you do that?" He said,
[1:51:09] "The supernatural God that I serve, he
[1:51:13] made it possible."
[1:51:15] Oh, brother, sister, I tell you this
[1:51:17] morning, no matter your condition,
[1:51:19] wherever you are and whatever you do,
[1:51:22] the supernatural God will make every
[1:51:25] engine that is removed in your life to
[1:51:27] spark.
[1:51:29] Hallelujah. At your
[1:51:32] workplace, in your business, in your
[1:51:35] school, on the street, wherever the
[1:51:40] enemy will take off engine from your
[1:51:44] situation, I say you will spark it
[1:51:47] anyhow
[1:51:50] because you have the supernatural.
[1:51:55] I heard believers praying
[1:51:58] for women that have no
[1:52:01] womb but they get pregnant and bring
[1:52:04] forth.
[1:52:07] We are serving the supernatural God.
[1:52:10] Brother, sister, he has not changed.
[1:52:12] He's the same yesterday, today and
[1:52:13] forever.
[1:52:15] Let us jump into the supernatural.
[1:52:19] And see these things manifesting in our
[1:52:21] lives. Any place that you are, create
[1:52:24] the atmosphere. I say create the
[1:52:26] atmosphere. If you don't create it,
[1:52:28] brother, it will not work. You have to
[1:52:30] create it. The young lady created it in
[1:52:33] far away Syria.
[1:52:37] Mary created it before the angel. He
[1:52:40] said, "Let it be according to your
[1:52:42] word."
[1:52:46] Shadrach, Meach, and
[1:52:47] Abednego. They created the atmosphere.
[1:52:50] They said they will not bow down to the
[1:52:52] graven image because they were not
[1:52:54] afraid of Nebuchadnezzar
[1:52:57] threat.
[1:52:59] He said king we will never bow down to
[1:53:02] your graven image
[1:53:04] because we know that our God that we
[1:53:06] serve will deliver us from your hands.
[1:53:09] But let us tell you even if he refused
[1:53:12] to
[1:53:13] come we will not bow down to the graven
[1:53:16] image. Even if he refused to come, they
[1:53:20] created the atmosphere
[1:53:23] to invite God into the condition.
[1:53:26] Hallelujah.
[1:53:28] So Nebuchadnezzar
[1:53:30] say if you hear the sound of the conet,
[1:53:35] the brass and whatever they call it at
[1:53:37] that time and you fail to bow down, you
[1:53:40] are bent already in the furry finance.
[1:53:43] So just go ahead hit the furnace seven
[1:53:46] times.
[1:53:48] And they heated the furnace seven time.
[1:53:49] That was the mistake they did because
[1:53:51] the number seven always bring God.
[1:53:54] Hallelujah.
[1:53:57] God is the number seven. So when they
[1:54:00] created they they heated it seven times.
[1:54:04] God jump into the fire.
[1:54:06] And remember he's a consuming fire too.
[1:54:08] Amen.
[1:54:12] Shadrach, Mezak, and Abednego, they
[1:54:15] said, "King, we are not bowing down. You
[1:54:18] can go ahead and throw us into the ferry
[1:54:21] furnace." And they refused.
[1:54:24] They were
[1:54:25] bound and the soldiers threw them into
[1:54:27] the fire and the flame of fire that
[1:54:31] passed on the soldiers killed all of
[1:54:33] them. But the three Hebrew children,
[1:54:36] Anand Andrea, Aaria, and Michel, they
[1:54:41] were in the fire having a revival. They
[1:54:43] were singing good songs in the fire and
[1:54:46] they were dancing up and down. Oh,
[1:54:48] hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:54:53] The people were surprised.
[1:54:57] Then they went and called King
[1:55:00] Nebuchadnezzar. He's a
[1:55:03] king. Something has happened today and
[1:55:06] we believe that is a supernatural thing.
[1:55:09] We have never seen it before. We've been
[1:55:12] burning people in the furry furnace. But
[1:55:15] today the three Hebrew children that we
[1:55:17] cast into the
[1:55:19] fire. Go and see. They are singing and
[1:55:23] dancing. They are going up and
[1:55:26] down. Their hair is not bent.
[1:55:29] Hallelujah. Their dress is not banned.
[1:55:32] King, come and see for yourself.
[1:55:36] And the Bible say that King
[1:55:37] Nebuchadnezzar went close to the furry
[1:55:41] furnace and he bowed down to look in the
[1:55:43] furry furnace. Yes. Because the almighty
[1:55:46] God is in there. You have no option but
[1:55:49] to bow down. That's right.
[1:55:53] Then he turn around. He said, "Brother
[1:55:55] Paul, how many people did we throw into
[1:55:58] the fairy furnace?" They said, "Three,
[1:56:00] sir." He said, "Yeah, but I see the
[1:56:03] fourth man." And he's like the son of
[1:56:06] God. Oh,
[1:56:08] hallelujah. Thank you. The book doesn't
[1:56:10] have no option. He say, "Shadrach,
[1:56:12] Mezak, and Abednego, the servants of the
[1:56:15] most high God, come out."
[1:56:18] Hallelujah.
[1:56:21] Brother, sister, we have come out from
[1:56:24] the world. We have come out from sin. We
[1:56:27] have come out from unbelief. And we are
[1:56:30] praising our God in the supernatural.
[1:56:35] Can I hear amen from you again? Oh
[1:56:38] brother, let's move forward. Hallelujah.
[1:56:40] In this direction. May we never be
[1:56:43] confused. May we never have any doubt
[1:56:45] within us. So long as the message of
[1:56:49] this hour and Jesus Christ power is
[1:56:51] concerned, let us create it around us
[1:56:54] wherever we are and there shall be a
[1:56:57] performance. God bless all of us.
[1:56:59] [Applause]
[1:57:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:21] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[1:57:22] the word of God. Has your faith been
[1:57:25] anointed this morning? I believe God
[1:57:27] gives us the faith, but faith, but it
[1:57:29] needs to be anointed by the word. And
[1:57:31] I'm encouraged uh by the word of God
[1:57:34] this morning from our brother Daniel.
[1:57:36] And we know the Lord has spoken through
[1:57:37] them. There are many situations that are
[1:57:39] dire right now. They're in great need.
[1:57:42] And we need something beyond human. We
[1:57:44] need something beyond
[1:57:46] science. The doctors, we have
[1:57:48] situations. The doctors are saying this.
[1:57:50] So, we need something beyond the
[1:57:52] doctors.
[1:57:53] Can you say amen? We need your prayers
[1:57:56] as a congregation. We need your faith.
[1:57:58] We need to apply the word. And we need
[1:58:00] something more than human. We need a
[1:58:01] supernatural God.
[1:58:03] And I just love uh I won't don't want to
[1:58:07] repreach this. I wouldn't dare, but I'm
[1:58:08] just saying how the Lord has been
[1:58:10] speaking to us about making this
[1:58:12] connection and the connection to
[1:58:15] omnipotence meeting each other. That
[1:58:17] connection has to happen. But it's not
[1:58:19] some natural connection. It's a
[1:58:20] supernatural God connecting with us. And
[1:58:24] sometimes we put these things way out of
[1:58:26] our reach. But you see, God wants to be
[1:58:28] supernatural, not only in healing and
[1:58:30] physical healing, but in every need in
[1:58:32] our life. We wouldn't think that if
[1:58:34] something someone is just incredibly
[1:58:36] bitter or has a lot of walls up in their
[1:58:38] life and they've been abused, we
[1:58:40] wouldn't think of but that needs the
[1:58:42] supernatural God as well. Can you say
[1:58:44] amen?
[1:58:46] And and and talking about God opening up
[1:58:49] a channel like he did the Red Sea. God
[1:58:52] opened up a channel for them to walk
[1:58:53] through. It wasn't for the Egyptians. it
[1:58:56] was for God's elect. So when he opens up
[1:58:59] a channel for you individually, it may
[1:59:02] not be for someone else, but he if
[1:59:04] you're praying, say, "God, I need you to
[1:59:06] open up a channel to me." I I believe
[1:59:09] it's a wonderful thing. And uh I just
[1:59:11] wanted to say his first comments were is
[1:59:13] that sometimes we're offended by little
[1:59:16] things. Sometimes we're offended at how
[1:59:18] God introduces the supernatural. Because
[1:59:21] this is how he titled it. He said that
[1:59:23] when the supernatural is introduced,
[1:59:25] sometimes we don't see how God's going
[1:59:27] to come in as the supernatural, but it's
[1:59:29] introduced to us. And when he introduces
[1:59:32] something, it's different. He's asking
[1:59:34] us to do something that's out of the box
[1:59:36] sometimes.
[1:59:38] So, so non who had leprosy, he had all
[1:59:41] in his mind, okay, if that's the God and
[1:59:43] Elisha's with him, then I'm going to go
[1:59:45] to him or I'm going to send him gifts.
[1:59:47] And he's got all his ways to do it. And
[1:59:50] God comes around completely different
[1:59:52] and tells him to do go dip in the Jordan
[1:59:54] seven times. You can't tap into this
[1:59:57] supernatural God if you got it already
[1:59:59] figured out how he's going to do it. Can
[2:00:01] I get an amen? We have got to mature and
[2:00:04] humble oursel to say, "God, whatever
[2:00:07] you're asking me to do, whatever way and
[2:00:10] channel you're introducing to me, I'm
[2:00:12] willing to humble myself to go through
[2:00:15] that channel." Come on. And we need a
[2:00:18] supernatural God in all of the things in
[2:00:20] our lives. No matter what it is, we need
[2:00:23] him. And when he asks us to dip, dipping
[2:00:25] in the Jordan, even people receiving
[2:00:27] this message is really dipping in the
[2:00:29] Jordan seven times. Because if somebody
[2:00:32] sees that I want to come closer to God
[2:00:35] and I want more of God that doesn't know
[2:00:37] about this message, then they can't come
[2:00:39] through something that's not God's
[2:00:40] provided way. I believe the power of
[2:00:43] Christ in this last day's message will
[2:00:45] wash your leprosy away.
[2:00:50] But see, look at it now. You come,
[2:00:51] you're going to believe he's a prophet.
[2:00:53] The the little servant girl was she
[2:00:55] heard it all the thing. And she pointed
[2:00:57] to to the source of that day, which was
[2:00:59] God's prophet that would deal with his
[2:01:02] leprosy.
[2:01:04] He wanted to be delivered from his sin.
[2:01:06] You know, sin has a lot of different uh
[2:01:09] facets to it. We think sin somebody's in
[2:01:12] the bar drinking or somebody commit
[2:01:13] adultery. Sin has a lot of levels to it.
[2:01:16] Bitterness,
[2:01:18] hatred,
[2:01:20] things laying in the heart. It's all sin
[2:01:22] and the attributes of sin. But we have
[2:01:24] our way that we want to deal with. But
[2:01:26] you see, when he sent this word, when he
[2:01:28] sent the provided way for this day, we
[2:01:30] we're not pointing to a man, William
[2:01:32] Brandon. We're pointing what God sent
[2:01:33] through him. And when we do that, that's
[2:01:36] the servant girl said, "If you can get
[2:01:38] to him, I believe your leprosy will be
[2:01:40] taken care of." Then all of a sudden,
[2:01:42] now he thinks he's going to go, my dad
[2:01:45] used to say it, brother Daniel. He say
[2:01:47] he's gotten his mind. He's going to go
[2:01:49] see the prophet. He's going to knock on
[2:01:51] the front door of that prophet. He's
[2:01:53] going to open up his hands and say, "Hit
[2:01:55] me in the head. Oh, prophet, give me my
[2:01:58] deliverance from my leprosy." And so he
[2:02:00] knocks on the door and a servant comes
[2:02:01] to the door and he says he where's the
[2:02:05] prophet? Oh he he he can't come right
[2:02:07] now. He said he sent me as a servant to
[2:02:09] tell you to go dip seven times in the
[2:02:11] Jordan River.
[2:02:15] That's not the way it was supposed to
[2:02:16] happen.
[2:02:19] Go dip seven times. And then his mind as
[2:02:21] he's on his way back goes through
[2:02:23] there's a lot of other cleaner rivers
[2:02:24] than this.
[2:02:26] There's a lot of other ministries out
[2:02:29] there than to come through this. It
[2:02:31] looks so dirty. It looks It's a But you
[2:02:34] see now, we can't tap into the reality
[2:02:37] of God till we're willing
[2:02:40] to get into the channel that he asks us
[2:02:42] to get into. I'm not supposed to be
[2:02:44] repreaching this.
[2:02:50] It's getting into the channel of
[2:02:51] supernatural. It's not what we expect.
[2:02:54] Sometimes some don't know that they have
[2:02:56] leprosy.
[2:02:59] That's right. And you they don't even
[2:03:00] know. They don't have they have troubles
[2:03:03] in their heart and troubles that need to
[2:03:05] be resolved. Well, I've been in the
[2:03:06] message for 30 years. No, no. Listen,
[2:03:09] you know, I want to say something as a
[2:03:11] pastor. Last week, we had a lot of
[2:03:13] teaching and Wednesday night we had a
[2:03:15] lot of teaching and I received just a
[2:03:18] little bit of response back. And
[2:03:19] sometimes, as brother Steve said last
[2:03:21] Sunday, sometimes that type of channel
[2:03:24] he gets into is a little bit
[2:03:28] uncomfortable and
[2:03:30] painful. And I noticed some stayed on
[2:03:33] the board for the whole thing and some
[2:03:34] had to go. But uh that was a long day
[2:03:38] and teaching can be kind of strenuous.
[2:03:40] But you see, it's not that we can
[2:03:41] connect all the dots to it. It's just
[2:03:44] you know you know what I want as a
[2:03:45] pastor whether it's a pastor evangelist
[2:03:48] anybody coming here myself it's for God
[2:03:50] to open up a channel to somebody and in
[2:03:54] one moment a minister a teacher can say
[2:03:56] something like that and we we write it
[2:03:58] off say maybe we leave early this I had
[2:04:00] a brother tell me a couple couple people
[2:04:02] come and say and it's hard to sit
[2:04:03] through that because it's painful it's
[2:04:05] touching things of the heart
[2:04:08] but you see if you trust the Lord
[2:04:11] one
[2:04:12] moment something can open up to you and
[2:04:14] say, "That's what the devil's been using
[2:04:17] my whole life." And once he's exposed
[2:04:20] and you step into that, say, "Now it's
[2:04:23] over." Because the enemy doesn't have a
[2:04:24] hold on you. Hey, listen. The Lord's
[2:04:26] here, supernatural God is here to break
[2:04:29] every stronghold of the enemy in your
[2:04:31] life. Can I get a witness? The reason
[2:04:33] that the Lord is here in this service
[2:04:36] and in every service and in your life
[2:04:38] every day, the reason he's there is to
[2:04:40] step in with his creative power and his
[2:04:43] supernatural power to change things that
[2:04:45] you can't change.
[2:04:48] So don't underestimate what the Lord's
[2:04:50] saying through teaching
[2:04:53] because just one moment and it opens up
[2:04:55] saying something. Say that's what I need
[2:04:57] to yield to the Lord. That's when I need
[2:05:00] to dip into the Jordan seven times. This
[2:05:04] muddy
[2:05:06] water. My dad used to say he dipped down
[2:05:09] one time and he's a king, you know, so
[2:05:10] he's just, "Oh, Lord, this mud all over.
[2:05:13] Why in the world do I got to have the
[2:05:16] Jordan? Couldn't it be some other?" Two
[2:05:19] times no change. Three times. Six times,
[2:05:23] no change. I'm finished this. No, no,
[2:05:25] no. Just just just if the one servant
[2:05:28] said, "If the king would have asked you
[2:05:31] to do something great, would you have
[2:05:34] done it?" Well, of course I would have
[2:05:37] but how much the more you just do this
[2:05:39] and see what happens. Is anybody
[2:05:42] listening this morning?
[2:05:44] I do dips the seventh time and and as
[2:05:48] you said the seven times when God shows
[2:05:50] up, he comes out of that and the leprosy
[2:05:52] was completely gone.
[2:05:54] completely gone. Don't
[2:05:57] underestimate this supernatural God
[2:05:59] among us. We've had 2,000 years of
[2:06:02] mechanical,
[2:06:04] intellectual stimulation of things. This
[2:06:07] bride is, we're not trying to make
[2:06:09] something happen. Can you say, we've had
[2:06:12] a lot of that, too. Work it up by the
[2:06:14] music or work it up by a prayer line.
[2:06:16] We're not trying to work anything up.
[2:06:17] But this bride has a hunger for more of
[2:06:20] God and to see God step in and show
[2:06:24] himself mighty for every need of our
[2:06:28] lives. Praise be to God. I rejoice in
[2:06:32] the word this morning. Amen. Let's stand
[2:06:40] together. Praise the
[2:06:43] Lord. What a mighty God we serve.
[2:06:48] What a mighty God we
[2:06:52] serve. Oh angels bow before him. Heaven
[2:06:57] and earth adore him. What a mighty God

[2:07:50] brother Daniel coming all the way from
[2:07:51] Ghana. May God bless his church. May God
[2:07:54] be with him. Praise the
[2:07:57] Lord. We're going to have a closing
[2:07:59] prayer, but if you have a need this
[2:08:01] morning, you want to have our brother

[2:08:27] little
[2:08:29] creators and all we have to do is create
[2:08:32] the right atmosphere.
[2:08:34] Maybe today we catch that, Lord, that if
[2:08:36] we got a home that's full of tension and
[2:08:40] arguments and bitterness
[2:08:44] and maybe today we could go home and
[2:08:46] change the atmosphere in our home, in
[2:08:48] our minds and hearts. Put on some good
[2:08:50] Holy Ghost music. Be nice to one
[2:08:53] another. Be polite to one another.
[2:08:56] Forgive one another. And Lord, in that
[2:08:58] atmosphere we could create, then you can
[2:09:00] come and do even above and beyond what
[2:09:03] we whatever we could ask or think. Help
[2:09:05] us, Lord, to recognize this key of being
[2:09:07] creators of an atmosphere. May we change
[2:09:10] it, Lord, because we're looking for you
[2:09:12] to change our situations. We put our
[2:09:15] trust in you. We pray there will be many
[2:09:17] trickle down effects, Lord, from this
[2:09:19] meeting today. We look to you, the
[2:09:21] author, the finisher of our faith.
[2:09:23] Commit it to you now in Jesus' name we
