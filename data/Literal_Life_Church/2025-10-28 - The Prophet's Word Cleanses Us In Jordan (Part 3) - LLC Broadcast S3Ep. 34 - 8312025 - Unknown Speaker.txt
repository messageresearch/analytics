So here is non acting according to the word of a prophet and doing what he didn't want to do according to the word of a prophet. But look what he did when he followed this way and this word of the man of God. His flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean. Sometimes the word of a prophet lingers for a while. But if you obey him and follow what he said to do, you're always going to see a prophet's word fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And so let's go over in 2 Corinthians 15 if you would. And let's add something Paul said in here that would be related to finishing this subject here of non. Now, if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some of you that there's no resurrection of the dead? In other words, there's some preachers who were saying there's going to be no resurrection for the saints. We believe there's a resurrection of Christ, but there's going to be no resurrection of the saints in Christ. Well, how can you preach the resurrection of Christ and not believe there's a resurrection for the saints? That's the very reason Christ was resurrected so his people would be affected by resurrection power. But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen. And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching in vain and your faith is also in vain. If he hasn't risen, then everything we're doing today is in vain, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; It has to have an end result of a resurrection. And that power of the resurrection. Verse 15. Yay. And we are found fault false witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he was raised up Christ whom he raised not up. If so be that he that the dead rise not. For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised? And if the Christ and if Christ be not raised, your faith is in vain, yet are and ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. Your very best day, even as a Christian, without the hope of a resurrection or rapture in the other side, you're of all men most miserable cuz we're believing something that doesn't have a climax and an end result in a new body in a millennium. Can you say amen? What good is all of it if we don't need if we don't believe there's something coming? If verse 20, but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man uh by one man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order, Christ the first fruits, afterwards they that are Christ at his coming. I want you to notice now he was the first fruits but the truth of resurrection will go on until the end and in this hour there will be another resurrection of Christ saints. &gt;&gt; Then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. I don't know if you noticed it, but Christ is still putting enemies under his feet. Say, "Well, he did all that." No, no, he's still doing it because it's the work's not done yet. Where is he putting the enemy under his feet? Under your feet. &gt;&gt; He's finishing the work in the bride. &gt;&gt; And when that's all done, there's going to be a great homecoming and resurrection. &gt;&gt; So, do you understand today that Paul's saying we still Christ still has a work to do in our lives? And what is it? We're putting all things under our feet. Christ is finishing that work in us. &gt;&gt; For he must reign till he had put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that he shall be destroyed is death. Well, I can say that's true because there's a rapture. There's going to be a people that are raptured that escape death. I want to be a part of that group. I don't know if I'll be I don't know if I'll kick the bucket someday, but I'll be in the resurrection. But I'd like to be a part of that group that escapes death &gt;&gt; right from this body to the new body. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things put under him, it is manifest that he is accepted which did put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? always back to this subject is that why are we baptizing everybody in the symbolism of a death and a resurrection? I tell the young ones that are being baptized, I try to make it simple for the young ones to realize one of the parts of baptism is is a type of a death, burial, and a resurrection. When I put you, when brother Paul puts you under the water, it's typing your life is dying in Christ, but I don't leave you under the water. I bring you back up. There's a resurrection and there's a new man coming in your life. There's a new resurrection. There's a new life. So Paul's saying, why? I know it looks like I'm preaching already, but I am. Paul's saying, why do we baptize people in this symbolism if we don't believe in a resurrection? &gt;&gt; He's correcting these preachers. And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? And then he says, why are we having such hardships? Why are we going through such trouble? And then he says this profound statement that right in the middle of this resurrection thing. He brings a point that our we are we are dying but it's not a one-time event. And he says this that we quote a lot of us all the time. I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Jesus Christ. In other words, I'm going to say this publicly to all of you believers. I die daily. Wow. &gt;&gt; It's just in the middle of all this dying and resurrection and all this resurrection power and the only way he can come to a resurrection is not to be one night at an altar dying to himself. I die not every year at camp. &gt;&gt; Not once a year for Christmas service. &gt;&gt; This is a death that's not even in church. This is a death to yourself. And what is it? Daily we die. daily we give up of our own will and say Lord thy will be done. I think a wonderful revelation that's come out of this story of non is don't question the places God takes us to die to ourself and in this case it was Jordan. Non questioned the place that God told him to go to. One of the dirtiest rivers if not the dirtiest river. He actually suggested why couldn't it be some other cleaner rivers and more distinct than the ones in dis Damascus. But I think we learn that that we don't question the places God takes us to that cause us to die to ourselves. &gt;&gt; That we don't question that, that we grow out of questioning that Jordan represents death. Don't try to figure what God asked us to do or to give him better options of the way to do it. And so this is what we learn is that we we we should learn not to question what God has asked us to do because if it ends up in our healing if and and God has different ways that he heals. God has different ways he brings deliverance. It's the same power of God but he asks us to do different things sometimes in order to get there. We learn from non that he had to overcome his pride, overcome his questions about this crazy uh thing the prophet's servant asked him to do. He had to overcome all that and be trustworthy in the prophet's word and go do it and follow through with obedience if the prophet asked to do it. And that's when we find when he was completely obedient, then we find the prophet's word coming to pass in his life. So don't try to figure out what God asked us to do or don't try to bring him better options. Don't underestimate how God is dealing with the sin of this generation &gt;&gt; through the voice of a prophet. You can come kicking and screaming and start you know taking picking and choosing but listen listen let's just respect the way God is dealing with sin. Let's respect how God wants to wash our lives. &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? And in this case, non who wasn't even a believer had to respect going down and dipping seven times, and you can come kicking and screaming, which he did. But when he got obedient and did exactly what the word said to do, guess what? He got his healing. &gt;&gt; Don't underestimate how God deals with sin. &gt;&gt; And the way he chooses to do it. And you see, friends, God never needs to put a show on to anyone. In other words, God's ways are not our ways. We sang that. We preached that last Sunday. How many believe God's ways are not our ways? We got to trust his ways. And then God never does something to put on a show to anyone. He never says, "Do this because I kind of want to flash my power and just flash everything to the world." God does not do things to put on a show to anyone. So if it's odd what he asks us to do, it must be then for whose benefit? He doesn't like to show off to the world. So if he asks us to do something strange, it must be for our benefit. Yes, &gt;&gt; cuz he don't need to show off. &gt;&gt; But if he wants to bring healing to you and he asks you to dip seven times in the muddy Jordan, it must be he's something he's trying to teach you. So God's way, he's not trying to show off. It's for our benefit. So it must be a test sometimes. He must it must be for our growth and increase trust and faith in him. Even Jesus did some strange things. And I don't want to spend a lot of time on this, but even Jesus asked for strange things. Did strange things. He's he grabbed some mud out of the ground. He spit on the mud for the blind man. That's an interesting mixture of his spit and the mud bringing the healing of a blind man. It's pretty gross, actually. I wonder what the people thought when he was doing that. I wonder what the blind man thought as he hears a spit. If he's like you, he's in his mind. He's blind, but he's hearing spit. He's hearing mud being crushed together with the spit. And I can't help but the blind man's saying, "What in the world's going on? What's Jesus doing?" He has the power just to speak the word. &gt;&gt; Why isn't he just saying it to me? Because don't underestimate what God is doing. There's a reason he's doing it. &gt;&gt; And we'll never figure that spit. Another place he he spit uh there's another place that he actually he doesn't spit in the mud but he he actually he spit on the tongue of a blind man. &gt;&gt; He touched the ear of the deaf person. He touched the mouth of the dumb. He healed on the s Sabbath day which was wrong to all the Pharisees. He healed on the wrong day. He he he worked outside of the box. He didn't deal with every sickness the same way. Can you say amen? And God's always been that way. Moses held up a brass serpent and said, "If all the people will look towards it," I don't know why God did it that way, but guess what? If they look towards it, they were healed and kept from the serpent's bite. &gt;&gt; They walked in Peter's shadow and got healed. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; It wasn't laying on the hands that time. It wasn't speaking the word that time. They just got in Peter's shadow and they were healed. &gt;&gt; That wasn't Jesus. That was Peter with Jesus in him. There's different ways, the same power, but it's out of the box sometimes. And that's only for us to see if we're willing to take the step into Jordan of what it is. Are we willing to trust the Lord what he's asking us to do? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God just needs humility to his word. And the way he said to do this, this is odd. You say, "Lord, this is odd." But his word said to do it, and I'm going to trust the Lord, but it's death to ourselves. Jordan means death. It's death to oursel. That's the work he's doing. It's a complete death to ourselves. So now in our text, Paul is correcting this men's teaching that's saying there's no resurrection for us. I already preached on a little bit. I don't have to say much about it, but Christ proved that he uh when he died, he rose again. Christ proved that there would be a resurrection. He did it himself. And here's the principle Paul's bringing. There's always a resurrection after death in Christ. There's always a resurrection after death. That's what he's preaching to these men. There's always a resurrection after death in Christ. And there's always a death before resurrection in Christ. &gt;&gt; You holding on to that? Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. There's in in the Lord there is always a resurrection after death. But also in the Lord, there's always a death before resurrection. That's the principle of Christianity. And guess why we can believe it for ourselves? Because Christ proved it. &gt;&gt; He died and he rose again. &gt;&gt; That kind of death in in the Lord, that kind of death according to the word always brings a resurrection. And there's no resurrection without that kind of death first. And what I mean is not by a physical death. We don't have to go to Calvary. Thank God he paid for our sins. But then Jesus says every day a person ought to take up their cross and follow Jesus, showing there is a cross for each of us to bear. And we ought to take up that cross. Just like Jesus took up his cross for us, we ought to take up our cross. Oh no. Maybe a Baptist said, "No, he's taking the cross for us. It's not a life of the cross. It's an easy life now. No. Jesus said, "You have a cross to bear. You have a burden to bear." &gt;&gt; And a lot of people aren't willing to pick up that cross. &gt;&gt; But there's a cross for each of us. And he says to pick that up. Why? Because the principle is there's a there's in Christ, there's always a resurrection after death if there's a true death in Christ. But there's always a death. You can't come to resurrection power without a dying out to yourself &gt;&gt; and dying daily. You can't come to more of the Lord unless you're willing to die to something. I'd say this, if you want to come to more of the riches of God, there's something you have to die to. &gt;&gt; And when you die to that thing, you open the door to come to more of his resurrection power, more of his grace, more of his riches. You say, "Well, it's a free gift." Yeah, it's given to you. But there's something that we have to lay down and give up in in an unselfish Lord, I'll follow you. Whatever you tell me to do, whatever it is, I'm willing to do it. &gt;&gt; Christ was a death at all levels. We often think of the cross, the final death, and it was the worst death a man could die. And it was we we we celebrate it. We had at communion, the Lord's supper, we he said to remember my death. But before he had a physical death, his death was on many levels, not just physical. If that's true with the Lord, it's true with us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Jesus died to his own will. Jesus died turning down temptation of Satan in the wilderness when he was tempted by three different things. He had to die to being tempted. He was tempted in all things like we are. So he had to die to what he was tempted by. I won't fall to that temptation. He had to die to himself and trust God. We have to do the same thing. He died turning down temptation. And the temptation is using his power as a or his gift for just a show or popularity. Satan tempted him and says do this, do this. And and he was tempting Jesus to use his power for a show or for popularity. Jesus had to die to influences that would make him more popular. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus had to die to the temptation to use his gift for show or popularity. I I pray that all the gifted people will listen to me because Jesus had the greatest gift that any man has ever had. But he had to die to the temptation to use that gift for a show or for popularity. &gt;&gt; Jesus had to die to the temptation to use his gift to work up the crowd. &gt;&gt; He didn't do that. &gt;&gt; Men can use their gift to work up the crowd into a frenzy. Men can use their gift and fall into popularity. Men can use their gift, but Jesus had to die to that. He was off to the kingdoms of this world and all of its money. He was off to the kingdoms of this world by Satan and all of its money. He turned it down. He had to die to that. He died in poverty. He had no money. He died to defending himself. He became poor. Oh, praise the Lord. I'm remembering scriptures now. He became poor. He became poor so we could become rich. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; He had to die to the temptation to become richer. And I'm I'm not saying if God don't bless you, but I'm saying you can't buy into the riches of this world, if it's in your heart and you're tied to that too much, you got to die out to that desire for the the the the root of it. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It's not money, it's the love of money. &gt;&gt; Jesus had to die to that. It's not just Calvary he died at. He died to himself in all these things. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He was offered money. He died. He What's Can I go on? He died to defending himself when he had the right to defend himself. &gt;&gt; Oh boy. I won't listen. I ain't going to ask for a show of hands. &gt;&gt; But he had to die to every desire to defend himself even when he was completely right. That's right. &gt;&gt; The closer he got to Calvary, he opened not his mouth. And if any man in history had a right to defend himself and was falsely charged, it was Jesus Christ. And he gave up the right to speak and say anything about it. He said, "Whatever you say, thou sayest." He He died. He died in Pilate's hall already. What did he die to? The right to defend himself. Jesus died these levels of death. He died to himself before he came to the death of the cross. He died to defending himself. He died to committing to too much men. The Bible says he did not commit himself to them because he knew what was in the heart of man. He had to die to committing because in our emotions, we commit ourselves to men. We don't need to commit just to men. We need to commit to God first. And Jesus was completely committed to God first. And he actually, the Bible says, he did not commit himself to some men because he knew what was in the heart of men. If he'd have put all of his commitment, all his eggs in one basket, even with his disciples who left him at the end, if he just give all his commitment to them, he would have been disappointed. Can you say amen? He had to die. He had to die to committing to men too much. &gt;&gt; He did not lean on his disciples for him to carry on to Calvary. They all left. They all betrayed him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He had to die to depending on a group. Oh, friends, I I know you're quiet. I know this is this is I don't like to move quickly on these things because I realize that my Lord Jesus didn't just go to the cross and physically die. He had a death at different levels going on. And we are called to the same thing. He died to living on man's approval. How many believe Jesus died to living off of man's approval? He told the the the Pharisees, "You live for the praises of men. You live to be complimented by men." He says, "You don't live on the praises of men. You live on the praises of God. Am I acceptable to God?" But some people live on social media how many likes they get. And you can live on the praises and how many likes you get. Jesus had to die to wanting the praise of men. Some of you didn't get any praise from your father. You didn't give any act acknowledging of your gifts. And so you've got a big void in your life and you keep trying to fulfill it. But you see now you need to look to the heavenly father for your complete approval because men will disappoint you. Fathers will disappoint you. Families will disappoint you. But I can tell you you can find your approval in Jesus Christ. He died the ultimate death. And guess what? That wasn't Calvary. When I say the ultimate death, the prophet said the spirit left him in the garden. He's it was a death to his own will in the garden. Before he died on the cross physically, he died in the garden of Gethsemane. And we fell from a garden. How many knows we fell from the garden of Eden? &gt;&gt; So it was a garden and we were in that. We were enjoying the presence of God and everything was perfect. We fell from the Garden of Eden. But Eden, but guess what? How did we get back into a promise to get back to Eden? How many believe we're going to get back to Eden again? How many believe we're going to be restored back to what Adam and Eve lost? We're in the process right now. But how did Jesus pave the way to get from falling from the garden even to get to the garden even? I can tell you it was the garden of Gethsemane. &gt;&gt; You know why a lot of Christians don't come to the glory of the Lord in their life? Because they're not willing to go to the garden of Gethsemane. And what happened in Gethsemane is said, "Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me." &gt;&gt; That's the human side. But the God side comes out and says, "Nevertheless, say it with me, not my will, but thine be done." That's Gethsemane. And you can't get back to Eden without this full death to self. The only way to a resurrection is death. When someone is dying in the Lord, just really dying out to them. Say, "I give up. I let Jesus take over. I'm giving this up. I'm today I'm leaving and I'm leaving this at the altar. You know what it is to God? It's beautiful. &gt;&gt; Only in Christ's kingdom is death a beautiful thing. &gt;&gt; Thank you for watching our service today.
