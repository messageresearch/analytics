[0:01] genesis chapter 3.
[0:12] lilly lewis is related to the sister
[0:14] sisler family so we've just been
[0:17] supporting her and
[0:18] her time of losing a family member there
[0:21] so we pray god will be with her and
[0:23] strengthen her and her family during
[0:25] this time of loss
[0:27] genesis chapter 3 and i'm sure this
[0:29] scripture has been
[0:30] read hundreds and hundreds of times
[0:34] over the years thousands no doubt and
[0:36] especially in the last days as
[0:38] the truth of what happened in the garden
[0:40] comes out
[0:42] and god shows us what took place there i
[0:45] don't hear a lot of ministers um as far
[0:48] as on the outer realms read this the
[0:50] outer
[0:51] churches outside of
[0:53] kind of our sister churches read these
[0:55] things a lot but it's such a poor
[0:57] important
[0:58] set of scriptures to show
[1:01] satan
[1:02] in his subtle way
[1:03] and what began the fall of mankind
[1:08] genesis chapter 3 the serpent was more
[1:10] subtle than any beast of the field which
[1:13] the lord god hath made and he said unto
[1:15] the woman yea hath god said ye shall not
[1:18] eat of every tree of the garden and the
[1:21] woman said unto the serpent we may eat
[1:23] of the fruit of the trees of the garden
[1:25] but of the fruit of the tree which is in
[1:26] the midst of the garden god hath said ye
[1:29] shall not eat of it neither shall ye
[1:32] touch it lest ye die and the serpent
[1:34] said unto the woman ye shall not surely
[1:36] die
[1:37] for god doth know that in that day ether
[1:39] of then your eyes shall be opened and ye
[1:42] shall be as gods knowing good and evil
[1:45] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:47] good for food and that was pleasant to
[1:49] the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[1:52] make one wise she took of the fruit
[1:54] thereof and did eat and gave also unto
[1:56] her husband with her and he did eat and
[1:59] the eyes of both of them were opened and
[2:01] they knew that they were naked and they
[2:03] sold fig leaves together and made
[2:05] themselves aprons
[2:07] and they heard the voice of the lord god
[2:09] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[2:11] day and adam and his wife hid themselves
[2:15] from the presence of the lord god among
[2:17] the trees
[2:19] of the garden so as as they have fallen
[2:22] from the word and believing the word eve
[2:24] as i want you to notice now what begins
[2:27] to unravel
[2:28] because
[2:29] eve has fallen from the word she's taken
[2:32] satan's interpretation of the word how
[2:35] many know that everything this whole
[2:37] world come under a curse everything
[2:39] unraveled when she left the word
[2:43] and so this is the transition and so
[2:45] they're hiding
[2:46] and now the voice comes in the garden
[2:49] and they never had to hide before never
[2:51] felt guilt before
[2:53] never had any of this happen but
[2:55] everything has lost now their their
[2:57] glory their their holy veil their
[2:59] fellowship their oneness everything
[3:01] unravels and they're hiding from god
[3:04] hiding from the presence of the lord
[3:06] verse 9 said and the lord god called
[3:08] unto adam and said unto him where art
[3:10] thou and he said i heard thy voice in
[3:12] the garden and i was afraid he had never
[3:14] been afraid before never been afraid of
[3:16] god i was afraid because i was naked and
[3:19] i hid myself and he said who told thee
[3:22] that thou was naked hast thou eaten of
[3:24] the tree where have i commanded that
[3:26] thou shouldest not eat and
[3:28] the man said now the normal answer would
[3:31] have been
[3:32] yes i vader that tree look at his answer
[3:35] and the man said the woman whom thou
[3:37] gave us to be with me she gave me of the
[3:41] tree and i did eat and the prophet makes
[3:44] this comment here this would have never
[3:46] happened before but he makes it come he
[3:47] says now he says they begin passing the
[3:50] buck they had never done that before and
[3:52] what should have been an honest answer
[3:54] and owning up to what he had done he
[3:57] passes the buck to his wife
[4:00] fallen
[4:01] condition
[4:03] when you're blaming everybody else
[4:06] i like what burley burley said last
[4:08] sunday he said when things happen and
[4:11] people do things
[4:12] he said the first thing that i do is
[4:14] look back at myself
[4:17] because if you can ask god to change
[4:18] yourself you can handle what a lot of
[4:21] people do to you
[4:23] but the blaming game
[4:25] never works
[4:26] if you keep blaming people you become a
[4:28] victim in life
[4:30] man said the woman thou gave us to me
[4:32] she gave me of the tree and i did eat
[4:34] and the lord god said unto the woman
[4:36] what is this thou hast done and her
[4:38] response was not normal either the woman
[4:40] said the serpent beguiled me and i did
[4:44] eat amen heavenly father bless your word
[4:46] strengthen me lord strengthen the
[4:48] congregation through the word that you
[4:50] have given and lord we have been blessed
[4:52] by the your presence among us here today
[4:55] and we commit the service and these
[4:56] precious souls into your hands in jesus
[4:59] name amen
[5:01] god bless you as your seated this
[5:02] morning
[5:07] i feel to go further in the message that
[5:09] the prophet preached oneness and you're
[5:11] welcome to listen or to read as we're
[5:14] going through this about relationships
[5:15] you're welcome to read it i encourage
[5:17] you to do it some have said they're
[5:18] doing that
[5:19] and so it's called oneness of god and i
[5:22] think it's 1962. so i'd encourage you to
[5:24] listen to it but i feel to go further
[5:27] with the subject
[5:28] and i would like to title this this
[5:30] morning relationships after the fall a
[5:33] few weeks ago we talked about
[5:35] relationships before the fall and now
[5:38] i'd like to begin to talk about
[5:39] relationships after the fall because
[5:42] relationships changed after the fall
[5:45] everything changed after the fall
[5:47] and in some ways we have lived out our
[5:50] lives dealing with relationships
[5:53] after the fall and after everything
[5:55] happened we've dealt with a lot of that
[5:57] in our lives until christ comes in our
[5:59] lives and redemption power begins to
[6:02] affect us and we realize when we get the
[6:05] holy spirit in our lives the holy ghost
[6:07] in our lives it begins to change
[6:09] everything and redeem us back to what we
[6:12] lost before the fall in the garden but
[6:14] all of us have lived with what it means
[6:17] to live with families and to live in
[6:19] situations and live in schools and go to
[6:22] schools and we've all lived with broken
[6:25] relationships we have all lived in
[6:28] families that have been broken it amazes
[6:30] me what family situations some of you
[6:32] have come from and as i hear it i just
[6:35] say
[6:36] that person is a miracle that they're
[6:38] even standing that's a miracle that the
[6:40] grace of god has them even have any
[6:42] desire for god it's a miracle that they
[6:45] know that their true fathers on the face
[6:47] of the earth because of what their
[6:48] fathers did to them and i stand amazed
[6:51] and that's the redemption power of god
[6:53] to show you it doesn't matter how broken
[6:56] the relationships are god through his
[6:59] holy spirit is out to restore
[7:01] relationships that have been broken the
[7:03] blood of calvary is the redemption to
[7:06] bring us back to what has been lost in
[7:08] the garden and i know you believe that
[7:10] this morning
[7:11] but i want to continue to talk about
[7:13] what happened after the fall that we
[7:15] understand what begins to unravel and
[7:17] then we understand how god begins to
[7:20] restore these things back and we don't
[7:22] know how far we'll get today but just
[7:23] listen close and i believe we'll have
[7:25] some things that will encourage you and
[7:26] be a blessing to you and as i said
[7:28] you're welcome to listen to the oneness
[7:30] message it's very rich as as the prophet
[7:33] just takes these segments of oneness the
[7:36] first thing he talks about is that what
[7:38] true oneness was in god before the fall
[7:41] that's the first thing he takes and the
[7:43] fellowship they had the sweetness they
[7:45] had and walking in the cool of the day
[7:47] fellowshipping in true oneness with god
[7:50] and then he
[7:51] then he goes into a transition and i'll
[7:53] read some of the quotes today how man
[7:55] adam and eve fell from that oneness what
[7:57] made them fall and then he goes into a
[8:00] section that talks about satan who's the
[8:03] one who broke the oneness then he begins
[8:06] a process satan of he's the one who
[8:08] broke the oneness that then he begins to
[8:10] present to mankind a false or an
[8:13] alternative oneness back to god so the
[8:16] same devil who broke the true oneness is
[8:18] now working on the people to give them
[8:20] an alternative approach to god an
[8:22] alternative oneness to try to bring the
[8:24] people together the tower of babel uh uh
[8:28] balaam under israel a false union a
[8:30] false oneness so now we can speed ahead
[8:33] to denominational systems who in their
[8:36] efforts to get mankind back to god do
[8:38] not bring them to the the power of the
[8:40] redemptive calvary but they actually
[8:43] bring him through a system of psychology
[8:45] or a system of man to try to correct man
[8:48] and correct his problems and bring him
[8:50] into oneness with god that is
[8:53] denominational systems are headed up by
[8:56] satan himself and it's an alternative to
[8:59] the true blood of jesus christ and
[9:01] salvation bringing a person by the holy
[9:04] ghost back into true oneness again like
[9:06] they had in the garden of eden
[9:09] and so now then then after he talks
[9:11] about satan good then he shows god and
[9:14] redemption through the prophets doing
[9:17] two things when god moves upon the
[9:19] people of god who are who are not in
[9:22] oneness with god he sends a prophet and
[9:24] he does two things the first thing he
[9:26] has to do is separate the people from
[9:28] the false oneness that they're in
[9:31] first thing he has to do is speak boldly
[9:33] through the prophets and say you're
[9:34] going to have to leave first thing he
[9:35] said to abraham he says leave your
[9:37] kindred leave the people that around you
[9:39] and he separated them and but why was he
[9:42] separating him from unbelief because he
[9:44] wanted to bring him to true oneness
[9:46] you cannot come to true oneness with god
[9:49] as an individual until you're willing to
[9:51] separate from the things that are a
[9:53] false union
[9:55] if you're not willing to separate from
[9:57] friends in the world if you're not
[9:58] willing to take that stuff and trust me
[10:00] the holy spirit while he's wooing you
[10:02] back will speak to you about separating
[10:05] from all the things that are keeping you
[10:06] from god there must be a separation from
[10:09] wrong things for you to be properly in
[10:12] union for with god
[10:15] it can never happen unless you're
[10:16] willing to separate from the things of
[10:18] the world separate from the wrong
[10:20] associates can you say amen separate
[10:22] from a wrong view of the bible unless
[10:25] you're ready to separate from
[10:26] denominations that's why it says in the
[10:28] revelations the call of the end was come
[10:30] out of her my people come out of those
[10:32] systems come out of religion because
[10:35] religion isn't working anymore you've
[10:37] got to come out of religion so you can
[10:39] find a true union with god
[10:42] and that's why prophets are so bold
[10:46] you'll not find a bible prophet
[10:47] including this one and all of them that
[10:49] don't come and just blasting out to
[10:52] bring the people out of their mess can
[10:54] you say amen he's going to blast out the
[10:57] jezebels he's going to blast and us
[10:59] preachers we're not necessarily called
[11:01] to be prophets we're pastors and
[11:03] evangelists and different things and
[11:04] don't try to be a pastor and be a
[11:06] prophet a prophet is a special calling
[11:09] if if a pastor is a prophet to his
[11:11] people every service he'll damage his
[11:13] people
[11:15] but a prophet is a prophet expect him in
[11:18] this day to be the spirit of elijah
[11:20] that's going to rebuke the jezebels
[11:23] don't ask him to be something else can
[11:24] you say man because god is breathing and
[11:27] speaking through that prophet
[11:30] it's bold can you say man
[11:32] jerking you out of
[11:34] separating you
[11:36] from the thing that's hindering your
[11:38] life
[11:40] don't be mad at the prophet he's doing
[11:42] what he's supposed to do
[11:44] you know when all this stuff come up
[11:46] about
[11:48] devaluing whether this prophet was the
[11:50] elijah or not
[11:52] and he was so bold and he said this and
[11:54] he said this against the jezebels and
[11:56] spoke against
[11:57] the women of this generation and how
[11:59] they were getting all track and
[12:01] immodesty and what they wore and
[12:03] becoming jezebels with their makeup and
[12:05] everything when he when he did that
[12:07] people were mocking it and saying
[12:09] and just like they did to elijah himself
[12:11] but they've been mocking it and i just
[12:13] preached the message let's let elijah be
[12:15] elijah
[12:18] and say but but wait a minute if he's
[12:21] elijah and today god said i'll send that
[12:23] spirit five times
[12:25] and it's gonna have the same nature to
[12:27] it
[12:28] it's not gonna be elijah elisha
[12:30] john the baptist had that spirit on him
[12:32] can you say amen sends a prophet to the
[12:34] gentiles and then he sends it one more
[12:36] time to the jews i hope you know that
[12:38] god so trusted the spirit of elijah to
[12:40] bring his word he sends it five times
[12:43] john the baptist had it on him and john
[12:45] the baptist if you'd been around my
[12:46] preachings light compared to john the
[12:48] baptist
[12:50] why because he had the spirit of elijah
[12:52] on him he wasn't going to back down he
[12:54] was going to rebuke that generation and
[12:56] he was going to speak the truth whether
[12:58] he had no one he owed to he wasn't paid
[13:01] by anybody and so he's going to speak it
[13:03] and so when elijah came why are we so
[13:05] surprised that his ministry is going to
[13:07] be jerking the people out of
[13:09] denominations out of worldliness can you
[13:11] say amen out of egypt like moses did
[13:14] bringing them out of egypt so they can
[13:16] come into the promised land let's let
[13:18] elijah be elijah
[13:21] and the way i approach the message is
[13:23] that i respect everything if i don't
[13:25] understand something i respect it
[13:27] because it's elijah
[13:30] if i don't understand it i just i say
[13:32] lord i'm going to respect what he said
[13:34] because i know
[13:35] it's important what he said
[13:38] you know we're living in a different
[13:39] generation now people are just
[13:40] nitpicking and and picking out what they
[13:42] want of it i've never done that
[13:44] and i'm aware that there's a human part
[13:46] and there's a profit product i'm aware
[13:47] of that
[13:49] but i'm care i'm careful i'm just
[13:51] speaking my own personal i'm careful to
[13:53] start nitpicking what's this and what's
[13:55] of god and what's not of god because of
[13:58] the man's office and god gave him that
[14:00] office and if elijah
[14:02] spirit was sent to us to jerk us out of
[14:06] false unions
[14:08] then let elijah be elijah
[14:12] i don't want to be elijah i'm not trying
[14:13] to be
[14:14] elijah but let elijah be elijah
[14:18] listen to it
[14:20] when i got the holy ghost at 16 i said
[14:22] if god was gracious enough if this is
[14:24] true if this is true that god
[14:27] just like john the baptist sent a man
[14:30] with the spirit of elijah on him then i
[14:32] ought to take to some time sometime and
[14:34] find out what he said
[14:37] i know some of you haven't done that but
[14:38] i'll tell you you ought to find out what
[14:40] he said
[14:41] god said
[14:42] elijah we all still believe that right
[14:45] this is a church that believes that
[14:48] those days are passed now as far as him
[14:50] but but god sent him and some of the
[14:53] some of the benefits of oneness with god
[14:55] that we enjoy today is because god sent
[14:57] elijah to call us out of false unions
[15:01] you come to church you enjoy you enjoy
[15:03] this present and some people piggyback
[15:05] off of a good presence i have a good
[15:06] feeling there i feel good when i leave
[15:08] you got to get beyond a good feeling and
[15:10] you've got to be birthed by the holy
[15:12] ghost
[15:13] you've got to have a relationship with
[15:15] jesus christ
[15:16] you can't come and say i get a good
[15:18] feeling and then it's gone by monday you
[15:19] can't do that you've got to get
[15:20] something deeper than that you've got to
[15:22] get something real can you say man
[15:25] people come and they don't even know
[15:26] this is a message church this is a
[15:27] message church we preach what elijah
[15:30] preached because god said elijah and
[15:32] some of the atmosphere and the benefits
[15:35] and the church order that you're
[15:36] enjoying today was because elijah spoke
[15:39] things to set the church in order some
[15:41] of these sisters that dress modest this
[15:43] didn't come from just some
[15:45] religion it came from elijah bringing us
[15:48] back to what modesty was it doesn't
[15:51] originate with me it doesn't originate
[15:53] with william branham god loved his
[15:55] sisters enough and his daughters enough
[15:57] to say this is what a woman is this is
[16:00] how a woman dresses this is what a man
[16:02] is and thank god we got it because now a
[16:06] man and a woman doesn't even know what
[16:07] they are anymore it's all messed up but
[16:10] god sent us elijah to tell us what a man
[16:12] was according to the scripture
[16:15] if you'll stay in that word young person
[16:17] if you get your mind off of the world
[16:19] and off of your phone and get in the
[16:21] word you'll know what a man is you'll
[16:23] know what a woman is and you'll marry a
[16:25] true woman because you know by god's
[16:28] order what a woman is and the right one
[16:30] to marry
[16:32] you marry the wrong person because you
[16:34] weren't in the word you made choices
[16:36] based upon worldly standards
[16:44] god through redemption
[16:46] used the prophets to separate the people
[16:48] from false unions i don't know why i
[16:50] elaborate on that but it must be a
[16:52] reason
[16:54] let elijah be elijah
[16:57] mockham all if you want to mock him and
[16:59] you don't believe it's elijah
[17:01] and that the scripture was fulfilled
[17:02] through this prophet
[17:04] i respectfully shake hands and courtesy
[17:06] shake hands with you god bless you go on
[17:08] with god
[17:09] please respect it go away respectfully
[17:14] because
[17:15] if you're going to stand and say first
[17:17] of all i would say to people and i've
[17:18] had him talk to me
[17:20] he wasn't elijah once you remove that
[17:23] absolute of scripture who elijah was for
[17:25] this generation
[17:26] then that's everything so now my first
[17:29] question is well
[17:31] who is he then
[17:32] who fulfilled it because we need them
[17:35] and they don't have an answer for that
[17:37] well it's just the spirit that comes on
[17:39] all the people i said well it wasn't a
[17:41] spirit that came on all the people in
[17:43] john the baptist day it was a man that
[17:46] had the spirit of elijah on him let's
[17:48] stick with the bible
[17:51] oh it's the spirit that's going to send
[17:53] revival i've talked to him at homeschool
[17:55] conventions and they preach on malachi 4
[17:58] 5. and it's to bring this and bring that
[18:00] and so elijah i asked a man after he'd
[18:02] preached on he says elijah has come to
[18:04] bring the fathers back to children i
[18:06] asked him big speaker in the homeschool
[18:08] movement i said hey i said you know
[18:10] isn't it interesting i said do you
[18:11] believe the spirit of elijah was on john
[18:12] the baptist do you believe it came on
[18:14] elisha he said yes i said why is it that
[18:16] you guys teach that it's going to just
[18:18] be on all the people today but every
[18:21] place in the bible it was on one man
[18:25] he said
[18:26] i never thought of that god bless you
[18:28] see you later that was it
[18:32] you can't break the scriptural pattern
[18:34] you can fuss with the man all you want
[18:36] to but you're fussing with the god's
[18:37] scriptural pattern now does it stay one
[18:40] man
[18:42] no
[18:44] after god's done his one-man ministry
[18:46] then
[18:48] it comes on a bride
[18:50] comes on a five-fold ministry
[18:52] so now i can safely say we're past the
[18:55] day of one man ministries
[18:59] everybody wanted to take over after
[19:00] brother brahm left you know the eighth
[19:02] angel
[19:03] the next prophet i'm the elisha coming
[19:06] to my church this is the only church to
[19:08] come no no no the scriptural pattern is
[19:10] once he sent the one man then god
[19:13] distributes his spirit by the holy ghost
[19:14] over all of his people
[19:17] and a many member bride that's why he
[19:20] could say the final voice
[19:22] to the final age it was not william
[19:25] branham
[19:27] the final voice to the final age is the
[19:30] bride
[19:32] somebody say praise the lord
[19:35] but let's not take away the value of one
[19:37] man i just just spent
[19:40] 20 minutes on the first paragraph of my
[19:41] notes
[19:43] so now
[19:45] even though
[19:46] true oneness was brought after calvary
[19:49] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[19:52] how many believe that's when true
[19:53] oneness came back
[19:55] whatever was lost in the garden was
[19:57] restored
[19:59] on the day of pentecost and that promise
[20:01] is unto you and your children as many of
[20:03] god should call throughout generations
[20:05] this is how we would come back to a
[20:07] union like in the garden of eden is that
[20:10] he would fill his people with his spirit
[20:12] and he would come and live in the heart
[20:14] that's where we come back to eden again
[20:16] that's the that's how redemption takes
[20:18] place he went to calvary poured out his
[20:20] spirit on the people and now we come
[20:22] back into what we lost in the garden
[20:24] everything that was lost we now receive
[20:26] the power of redemption to begin to rise
[20:28] above the fall and come out of the fall
[20:31] but the thing is after calvary and after
[20:33] the baptism of the holy ghost after 2
[20:35] 000 years
[20:37] then we needed malachi 4 and this is
[20:39] great that i'm talking about malachi 4
[20:40] and elijah because it says in the bible
[20:43] just in case the young people don't know
[20:45] it says the last scriptures of the old
[20:49] testament
[20:50] if you have your bible
[20:55] you say well i've heard this time many
[20:57] many times before but somebody here some
[21:00] of our children may not have heard it
[21:03] malachi the prophet prophesies and says
[21:06] in malachi 4
[21:07] he says
[21:09] verse 5 the last two scriptures of the
[21:12] old testament behold i will send you
[21:13] elijah the prophet before the coming of
[21:16] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[21:17] that was not john the baptist it was at
[21:20] the just before
[21:22] judgment day and he shall turn the heart
[21:25] of the fathers to the children and the
[21:27] heart of the children to their fathers
[21:29] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[21:32] curse
[21:33] so now this is the prophecy of elijah
[21:36] coming but i want you to notice now what
[21:37] he does all right
[21:39] this prophet
[21:41] first part of it is to turn the hearts
[21:43] of the
[21:45] fathers the mosaic fathers that were in
[21:48] israel during jesus time to the children
[21:51] of pentecost who would receive the holy
[21:53] ghost so that's one part of it but then
[21:55] he says that he'll turn the hearts now
[21:57] as the second part he'll turn the hearts
[21:59] of the children back to the father so
[22:02] now after 2000 years
[22:04] they would they would have to be
[22:06] restored back to the pentecostal fathers
[22:08] and the original thing of what happened
[22:10] the original oneness that happened on
[22:12] the day of pentecost in that time so we
[22:14] would here's the subject i want to make
[22:16] it as simple as possible that scripture
[22:18] shows us if we needed someone to tie our
[22:22] hearts back to the pentecostal fathers
[22:25] in in the day of pentecost that means we
[22:27] have become disconnected
[22:30] from the fathers
[22:33] if we weren't disconnected with that
[22:35] holy ghost oneness and that original
[22:37] pentecost if we weren't disconnected
[22:38] he'd never have to send a prophet
[22:40] because we'd be fine after two thousand
[22:42] years we've got the same holy ghost
[22:44] we're filled with it everything's good
[22:45] but everything isn't good because even
[22:47] after calvary and even after the holy
[22:50] ghost fell on the benegas to bring us
[22:52] back into eden again after 2 000 years
[22:54] of creeds and dogmas and worldliness and
[22:57] laodicea and all this stuff we are not
[23:00] in union with god anymore we lost it
[23:04] and the children are disconnected from
[23:07] the faith of the pentecostal fathers so
[23:09] he said i'll send elijah and i'm going
[23:12] to reconnect you back to true oneness
[23:14] again i'm going to take the children the
[23:17] christians the children of the
[23:18] generation and i'm going to speak
[23:20] something to reconnect them to the
[23:22] pentecostal fathers and they're going to
[23:24] get the same holy ghost
[23:26] the same faith
[23:31] oh it ought to make us rejoice friends
[23:33] there's no hope with without what god
[23:36] sends us we're disconnected from the
[23:38] pentecostal fathers we're disconnected
[23:40] from a true baptism of the holy spirit
[23:43] we're disconnected and by the way i'll
[23:45] let you know without that you don't have
[23:47] any overcoming power to live in laodicea
[23:50] but god said i'll restore you back to
[23:53] the faith of the pentecostal fathers
[24:00] so
[24:02] did you ever notice the wording
[24:05] the hearts
[24:07] of the children to the fathers
[24:11] when you talk about children and fathers
[24:13] that's a
[24:14] that's a relationship thing that's a
[24:17] that's a word picture
[24:18] you know he could have used anything
[24:20] there
[24:21] he could have said he shall turn the
[24:23] theologians back to the correct doctrine
[24:27] elijah shall come and turn all the
[24:29] theologians back to true doctrine he
[24:30] didn't word it that way
[24:32] elijah shall come in the end time and
[24:35] restore christians of this generation
[24:37] back to the true christians of the
[24:39] original he could have worded that way
[24:41] but look where the way he worded it he
[24:42] shall
[24:43] turn this is about relationship
[24:47] this is about oneness this is about
[24:49] family
[24:52] when you talk about children fathers
[24:54] mothers
[24:56] dads
[24:57] sons daughters it's about relationship
[25:03] he said i'll restore
[25:05] the faith of the children back to the
[25:07] faith of the fathers in other words i'll
[25:10] bring them back to the word
[25:12] back to the true baptism of the holy
[25:14] ghost back to bible faith
[25:16] back to holy living
[25:18] back to relationship and back to living
[25:20] holy by relationship i'll get to that in
[25:22] a minute
[25:23] elijah will call us back to holy living
[25:27] but by relationship
[25:31] not rules
[25:33] but back to relationship
[25:35] we got enough religion
[25:38] we got enough
[25:39] dress code
[25:41] preached as a religion
[25:43] this elijah didn't come to bring us a
[25:45] dress code
[25:46] he comes to bring us back to
[25:48] relationship
[25:50] and the dress code will fall in line
[25:52] because you've got a relationship with
[25:54] the father
[25:58] the children will be turned back he
[25:59] could have said turn back theologians to
[26:01] correct doctrine and all these other
[26:02] things but it's worded children and
[26:03] fathers and that puts an image in our
[26:05] minds that this is about relationship a
[26:07] disconnection from the children of today
[26:10] to our fathers in the pentecost
[26:12] spiritually it's a spiritual connection
[26:14] first in other words the children were
[26:17] disconnected from the fathers everybody
[26:18] listening father's day is coming up next
[26:20] sunday
[26:22] in our generation the children
[26:24] spiritually were disconnected from the
[26:25] pentecostal fathers
[26:27] and elijah is going to come and restore
[26:29] us back to the father
[26:31] and the pentecostal fathers so a
[26:33] disconnection from the children of today
[26:35] to our fathers in pentecost spiritually
[26:38] and it says did you catch it he shall
[26:40] turn their hearts back to the fathers
[26:45] not their heads
[26:49] not their
[26:50] intellect
[26:52] he shall turn their hearts
[26:55] i can't see anything else but
[26:57] relationship in this it's relationship
[27:00] it's fathers it's children it's sons
[27:02] it's daughters and it's hearts
[27:07] it's not about the mind
[27:09] it's not about the father just just
[27:11] providing for you but it's about the
[27:13] father coming into relationship with you
[27:20] so with father's day coming up i might
[27:22] say this
[27:24] the worst problem we have today
[27:26] is there's broken fellowship between
[27:28] mankind and the heavenly father
[27:31] there's no connection to the original
[27:33] faith of oneness of god
[27:36] connection with god and the sons of men
[27:38] but the word brings us back to that
[27:40] relationship
[27:41] now because of that disconnect because
[27:44] of that disconnect spiritually people
[27:46] are not getting the true relationship of
[27:49] the holy ghost they're getting a
[27:50] religion
[27:52] and because of that
[27:54] because of that now you have another
[27:56] problem that to me is the second most
[27:59] problem in our world
[28:01] natural
[28:02] disconnections
[28:04] from fathers and children
[28:12] you can read the articles
[28:14] brother rap sent me one uh something
[28:16] last week and he also sent me something
[28:18] here
[28:19] uh of a film documentary that's just
[28:21] been recently done i haven't seen it yet
[28:23] but i do want to see and it comes from
[28:26] it comes from the kendrick brothers and
[28:28] i thank god for the kindred brothers
[28:30] some baptist men from
[28:32] brothers from flor from georgia who have
[28:34] put so many films together with strong
[28:37] biblical themes they don't care about
[28:39] what people think they just say it and i
[28:42] i love the films because guess what
[28:44] there's like a very small percentage of
[28:47] movies to watch today
[28:50] there's a very small percentage that
[28:53] christians can watch and it not affect
[28:56] the holy ghost that's in them
[28:59] very few but when one comes out like the
[29:01] ten commandments with brother branham
[29:03] praise the lord for it and these are so
[29:05] good i don't know how somebody could
[29:06] watch somebody like something like
[29:08] fireproof i'd like a lot of message
[29:10] couples to watch that film fire proof
[29:12] and if you're not moved by that to seek
[29:13] a better marriage you're just too cold i
[29:16] don't know what it is or you think you
[29:17] got too much pride to watch that but i'm
[29:19] telling you it moves you what that man
[29:21] did in repentance to restore the
[29:23] marriage back to god it moves you
[29:25] it is done so well
[29:28] a lot of message marriages need to watch
[29:30] it if they won't listen to the word
[29:32] maybe they can get something out of that
[29:36] praise the lord but the kindred brothers
[29:37] did this and i'm anxious to watch it but
[29:39] brother rap said it's it's titled uh
[29:42] show show me the father
[29:45] and it's this whole subject that his
[29:48] people are beginning to pin down what's
[29:50] the problems come from most problems
[29:52] come from in our generation disconnect
[29:56] fathers that don't know how to be
[29:58] fathers
[30:00] fathers who provide
[30:02] for their kids but they don't need
[30:04] there's no relationship
[30:07] with her children
[30:09] and that breakdown in relationship with
[30:12] fathers
[30:12] is actually the cause of so
[30:15] many problems i've said it before if you
[30:17] talk talk to most men on death row in
[30:21] the prisons you'll narrow it down most
[30:23] of them confess i hated my father i had
[30:26] no relationship with my father
[30:28] murders rapists
[30:31] and you tie it back
[30:33] now you never justify that as being the
[30:35] problem if someone's murdered somebody
[30:36] but but you got to look at the core of
[30:38] where it come from it's a breakdown in
[30:40] fathers and children
[30:41] and don't think that we don't have a
[30:43] little bit of that around our ranks
[30:46] where the f the children are actually
[30:48] scared to death
[30:49] to open up certain subjects to their
[30:51] father because there is no relationship
[30:52] with her father he's provided for him
[30:54] he's gave him food he's did this maybe
[30:56] even left them a business but there is
[30:58] no he doesn't know their hearts
[31:01] can i get any help here this morning he
[31:04] has no concern about their hearts he
[31:06] doesn't know where they're at
[31:08] and i'll just say this before i get to
[31:09] some of the quotes i i meant to say this
[31:11] a couple sundays ago when this when
[31:13] these shootings begin to take place it's
[31:15] interesting first of all they never
[31:16] bring up you never hardly ever hear it
[31:19] of all the video games that they have
[31:21] that have fed on since 18 years of it in
[31:23] their bedrooms doing it they never talk
[31:25] about that as being a factor but one
[31:27] thing that they never talk about is the
[31:29] parents and and the prophet said it's
[31:31] parent delinquency it's not just parent
[31:32] delinquency but it's parents that are
[31:35] that are disengaged from their kids the
[31:38] video game has raised these boys
[31:43] because like burley said last week you
[31:45] know parents get tired sometimes of
[31:46] raising children so if you get too tired
[31:48] of the pressure you just basically you
[31:50] know what go do something i can't take
[31:52] you anymore and that's basically what
[31:54] this generation has done they haven't
[31:56] taken the responsibility of relationship
[31:58] with their kids and so they've let video
[32:00] games and videos raise their children if
[32:03] you let a video game that's shooting
[32:05] people raise your kid for 18 years and
[32:07] he's been in his room he has to be in
[32:08] the house because he can't provide for
[32:10] himself but you have made no effort to
[32:12] get close to them to take them fishing
[32:14] to find their hearts and they put him in
[32:16] there i can't deal with you he's
[32:17] rebellious i don't want to be there's no
[32:19] so but 18 years old he goes and buys a
[32:22] gun and begins blasting children and he
[32:24] doesn't even know
[32:25] is it the problem with the gun oh that's
[32:27] what the democrats say is the problem
[32:29] with mental health that's what the
[32:30] republicans say or is it a problem that
[32:32] this kid in such loneliness does not
[32:36] know
[32:38] any relationship
[32:40] with the father and mother because these
[32:42] parents are saying they're coming back
[32:44] and say we cannot believe that our son
[32:46] did this
[32:47] this is not our son oh yes it is
[32:51] and friends i'm not fully blaming the
[32:52] prayers but i'm going back to brother
[32:53] what brother brahm said we got parents
[32:55] in this generation that's disengaged
[32:58] clocked out timed out
[33:00] of parenting and besides that besides
[33:03] that if they don't have the word to hold
[33:05] them and to instruct their sons and
[33:07] they're just functioning then they buy
[33:10] into everything's okay well yeah go do
[33:11] that go out and be with a girl at 14
[33:13] years old go out with 17 years old go
[33:15] out with somebody and so and and we're
[33:17] taught that if you tell them they can't
[33:18] do that you're not allowed to tell them
[33:20] that you're too strict of a parent even
[33:22] in the message of saying you're too
[33:23] strict of a parent you're a legalist i
[33:25] am not a legalist if i tell my daughters
[33:27] you're not going out with that boy
[33:30] i don't know why i don't have more amens
[33:32] here i am not a legalist i'm in charge
[33:34] of my home
[33:36] and i have a right to tell them right
[33:38] and wrong
[33:39] [Applause]
[33:43] matter of fact when they get 30 years
[33:45] old my kids are still going to hear me
[33:47] telling them right or wrong whether they
[33:48] want to hear it or not because that's my
[33:50] position i love them as a father i'm
[33:52] going to speak up i'm going to say
[33:54] something
[33:55] and i'm going to remind them of what the
[33:56] message taught us if they leave the
[33:58] message i'm going to remind them of it
[34:00] listen god sent a prophet this is what
[34:02] we believe and it's a it's a timeless
[34:04] truth can you say it it's not william
[34:06] branham this is not my beliefs it's not
[34:08] william branham's beliefs this is a
[34:09] timeless truth and if we'll live by it
[34:12] god says i'll bless your home i'll bless
[34:13] your marriage i'll bless your family
[34:15] i'll have a relationship with you
[34:17] somebody say amen this morning
[34:20] satan has devalued all this stuff and
[34:23] made it a religion but the message is
[34:25] not religion it's relationship with god
[34:29] god was saying i want a relationship
[34:31] with you and when you get that you will
[34:33] have a relationship with your children
[34:35] you won't be afraid of your children you
[34:36] won't be afraid to speak up you'll love
[34:38] them gently gently love them you won't
[34:41] be a dictator to them i don't believe in
[34:43] that
[34:44] but love is corrective
[34:48] if you love them you'll correct them
[34:50] love is corrective
[34:52] now not all correction is love
[34:56] but because not all correction is love
[34:59] it doesn't dump out the fact that love
[35:01] is corrective
[35:04] what a watered-down generation that
[35:06] parents i don't want to say anything
[35:09] let me just bring up while i'm on the
[35:11] side let me bring up another thing
[35:13] there's a lot of parents that raise
[35:14] their children with a resentment
[35:18] towards the message themselves and the
[35:20] word
[35:21] and so they based their home on i will
[35:24] never tell my kid that thing
[35:28] now wait a minute wait a minute
[35:30] if it's the truth of god's word
[35:33] it's not your truth it's not you're not
[35:35] cramming it down the road you as a
[35:37] parent are supposed to bring the truth
[35:38] of god's word
[35:39] and if you say i go to a message church
[35:41] you're supposed to be training your kids
[35:43] and what the message said
[35:45] or else don't confuse them don't come
[35:47] here don't come to a message church find
[35:49] another place that's closer to your
[35:50] beliefs to raise your children but don't
[35:52] send him to a place where the preacher
[35:53] is going to be up here like he's doing
[35:54] it today and just preaching out against
[35:57] things and then at home you don't
[35:59] believe it we have different beliefs at
[36:00] home don't confuse your kid like that
[36:02] don't do that
[36:04] we believe that elijah came in this day
[36:06] we believe that he gave us structure for
[36:08] the church we believe he spoke the word
[36:10] he said well if god done that before yes
[36:12] when calvary came and the resurrection
[36:14] took place god sent paul a prophet to
[36:16] set the church in order and in
[36:18] corinthians you'll have things about sex
[36:20] sexual temptation marriage divorce you
[36:23] have it all why because god had to speak
[36:25] specific things of how to live to his
[36:27] prophet he's done the same thing today
[36:30] after the resurrection of the word of
[36:32] god out of history can you say man he
[36:35] sent a prophet to bring order to the
[36:36] church and we're enjoying
[36:39] many things of an atmosphere of purity
[36:42] because we preach those things
[36:46] even even when we come in here and we're
[36:48] quiet in the sanctuary most churches
[36:50] don't do that they use it for dinner and
[36:52] they use it for this and you and
[36:53] sometimes they have to but they say we
[36:55] set aside because and he said why are
[36:57] you so quiet visitors come why is
[36:58] everybody so quiet well it comes back to
[37:01] what a prophet said he said in order
[37:05] some of you would walk in and see if
[37:06] it's totally different go to a
[37:07] denomination sometime and see and
[37:10] and sally's yelling across the church
[37:12] five minutes before the service you know
[37:15] how you doing philip
[37:17] i shouldn't say sally's saying hi to
[37:19] philip but
[37:21] he's married and then you're gonna have
[37:24] phillips wife say what are you talking
[37:26] to my husband for him
[37:28] shut up salary sally
[37:32] you know i got to get myself out of this
[37:34] but you know what we're enjoying
[37:36] boundaries
[37:38] and structure
[37:39] and order
[37:41] from a prophet and some of you because
[37:43] you don't study the message you don't
[37:44] even know why we're enjoying that
[37:46] we're enjoying teachers and youth
[37:49] leaders here that are teaching the
[37:51] principles of the bible and the message
[37:54] to
[37:55] our young people at meetings
[37:57] and by the way that's what we're
[37:58] teaching
[37:59] don't kiss before marriage
[38:01] don't be physical before marriage
[38:04] don't go out alone a lot until the time
[38:06] proper time to do that keep it honorable
[38:08] keep it responsible if they come to our
[38:10] youth meetings this is what they're
[38:11] going to hear they're going to hear
[38:12] quotes of william brown they're going to
[38:13] hear bible can you say amen this is what
[38:16] we do we've been doing it for 33 years i
[38:17] don't mean to boast but we are not
[38:19] changing things here we're not loosening
[38:21] up the standards we're not changing the
[38:22] dress standards some people wear things
[38:24] around here and sometimes it's coming up
[38:27] sort of i just have to say we don't
[38:28] believe that around here we don't
[38:29] believe in wearing that that's not the
[38:31] principle because over time people begin
[38:33] to think that's what we do we believe
[38:36] and teach what the word of god says
[38:38] because it has set protections in place
[38:43] for our young people
[38:45] and guess what
[38:47] a lot of these young people i love them
[38:49] because a lot of them
[38:51] i love them all but you know what if the
[38:53] truth we're told they appreciate the
[38:55] protections
[38:57] appreciate the boundaries
[39:02] they appreciate when some scallywag
[39:04] walks in and starts to get around our
[39:05] youth
[39:07] and he doesn't know our boundaries and
[39:09] he starts doing this and doing that he's
[39:10] going to get corrected real fast
[39:12] you keep your hands off those girls or
[39:14] you're not allowed to come back
[39:17] our girls appreciate that
[39:19] that's not legalism that's called
[39:21] protections of the word of god
[39:27] so
[39:30] elijah
[39:32] we believe these things we believe we
[39:34] teach these things
[39:36] and
[39:37] the disconnect with fathers
[39:40] is a prevalent thing in our generation
[39:46] but more deeply is the
[39:49] separation
[39:51] from god the heavenly father
[39:54] to the sons of men
[39:57] and he said i'll send you elijah
[39:59] and he'll restore the hearts of the
[40:01] children
[40:04] back to a true experience of oneness
[40:06] with the heavenly father
[40:08] and that's why i can safely say if you
[40:10] didn't have a good father on this earth
[40:12] you'll have one in the heavenly father
[40:15] you come into that relationship and god
[40:17] will fulfill what you lost in your
[40:20] earthly father
[40:21] can you say amen
[40:23] god's not just making things up as he
[40:25] goes along he knew you would have a bad
[40:27] family knife he knew you come from a
[40:29] broken home so he provided for you
[40:32] the body of christ brothers and sisters
[40:34] can you say amen a father relationship
[40:36] he provides what was lost in this
[40:38] redemption
[40:41] if a daddy didn't tell you young girl
[40:42] what to do and wasn't vocal enough
[40:44] didn't have the relationship to do it if
[40:46] he didn't if he didn't god will provide
[40:48] men in your life and images in your life
[40:50] of true fathers that'll love you and
[40:52] tell you
[40:54] you should be thankful for it
[40:56] you'll provide it in the body of christ
[40:59] so these parents
[41:02] johnny is
[41:04] spending countless years when he comes
[41:06] home from school he barely gets through
[41:08] school barely gets through his grades
[41:10] gets parents get calls all the time
[41:13] of all the things going on in school
[41:16] and they just they just barely deal with
[41:18] it but there's no there's no absolute of
[41:21] the word but there's no relationship if
[41:23] there was some relationship with that
[41:24] child
[41:25] then
[41:27] he might be helped a little bit he might
[41:29] turn out a decent citizen in society and
[41:31] not
[41:32] mow down people with a gun
[41:36] but i would say if we uncovered it most
[41:38] of these situations
[41:40] the parents is a big part of it
[41:43] being disconnected
[41:45] i'm saying this because
[41:50] we as parents should be
[41:52] careful that we don't do the same thing
[41:54] and we have lonely young people
[41:56] that are coming home from school in
[41:58] college
[41:59] and basically finding their home and
[42:01] their relationship online
[42:05] instead of with mommy and daddy
[42:09] because they have to they're lonely
[42:11] satan's abused their loneliness
[42:14] and now instead of mom and daddy
[42:15] connecting with them and getting them
[42:17] around the right young people in the
[42:19] right fellowship instead of that they
[42:20] find other friends why why is my kid
[42:22] choosing this friend because young
[42:24] people need friends
[42:27] and eventually they're going to choose
[42:28] their friends that's fine but i'm just
[42:30] saying the parents should weigh in and
[42:31] say there's right right ones to choose
[42:33] and there's wrong ones to choose and and
[42:35] weigh in and parents should weigh in
[42:38] thank god for all the parents who did
[42:39] that here but sometimes
[42:42] children were raised on video games and
[42:44] they're going to a message church and
[42:46] it's because parents they don't know
[42:47] where their kids are at they don't know
[42:49] why the decisions are making is because
[42:51] in loneliness
[42:53] they spent most of their years in their
[42:55] bedroom
[42:56] alone
[42:58] and there's no connection
[43:04] i don't have a perfect home
[43:06] i'd never say that
[43:09] but i i
[43:10] i tried with my wife to make
[43:13] the word
[43:15] and the message
[43:17] the absolute for our home
[43:29] i've got to skip some of this now but
[43:31] i'm just
[43:32] trying to find a place to jump in
[43:46] how many know that eve
[43:49] left the word
[43:51] and because she left the word
[43:53] that's when the fellowship was broke
[43:55] with god
[43:57] okay i'll read these quotes next time
[43:59] so
[44:01] leaving the word
[44:04] is the thing that unraveled everything
[44:06] okay
[44:07] but
[44:08] i thought of it last night in the garden
[44:10] of eden it wasn't just
[44:14] the word it wasn't just that god
[44:17] spoke and said don't even don't eat of
[44:19] that tree they didn't have a bible they
[44:21] just
[44:22] god spoke to them that you can eat of
[44:24] all the trees but
[44:25] stay away from that one don't eat of
[44:27] that or that day you eat that die and
[44:29] that's the only word they had from god
[44:31] but guess what it wasn't just the word
[44:33] that god spoke to him to live by and if
[44:36] you stay by this you'll have life you
[44:38] live
[44:39] but it wasn't just the word his presence
[44:43] who was the tree of life a person
[44:47] so even though he spoke the word his
[44:49] presence was there as a person coming
[44:52] down every day in the cool of the
[44:54] evening and fellowshipping with them
[44:57] eden was not this thing of rules without
[45:01] relationship
[45:04] they had relationship
[45:05] and because they stayed with the word it
[45:07] kept that relationship intact
[45:10] when they left the word then the
[45:12] relationship was broken with god
[45:15] you see
[45:16] and so
[45:17] you know you have uh
[45:19] uh rules for a home i'm gonna get into
[45:21] that you have rules for a home we try to
[45:23] base it upon we tried to base upon the
[45:25] message and different things so you got
[45:27] these rules but the rules as it says
[45:29] rules without relationship breeds
[45:31] rebellion
[45:32] relationship without rules
[45:35] breeds rowdiness
[45:39] i've seen it
[45:40] parents want all relationship i want to
[45:43] be a buddy to my teenager my friend to
[45:45] him but i can't tell him what's right
[45:46] and wrong i just want to be a buddy to
[45:48] him we'll see how that goes
[45:52] rules without relationship breeds
[45:53] rebellion
[45:55] but relationship without rules brings
[45:57] rowdiness
[45:59] so eden was not a place of rules without
[46:02] relationship they were fellowshipping
[46:04] with a with the lord every day
[46:08] it was wonderful wasn't it
[46:09] there was a there was a person there it
[46:11] was the tree of life and they fellowship
[46:13] with the lord they were with them it
[46:14] wasn't this this thing and in my home
[46:17] how would it be if i had rules to my
[46:19] home the the nice thing about the rules
[46:22] of my home is that it's not just the
[46:24] rules i've set for my home and you're
[46:25] going to abide by these if you're going
[46:26] to live here but i'm a person they can
[46:29] come and talk to me
[46:30] about the rules
[46:33] you know i i love it these guys you know
[46:35] my youngest is 19 now and they still
[46:38] can't get the curfew right i have 11
[46:40] o'clock curfew
[46:43] i got a 25 year old still at home
[46:46] i've got a 22 year old a 19 year old and
[46:50] the simplest things you know now there's
[46:52] more important rules than the curfew but
[46:54] that's important to me you know
[46:56] so but you see i'm a person so i have
[46:58] the rule being by 11 o'clock you know
[47:00] and i always get these texts you know
[47:04] at 11 02.
[47:10] and
[47:11] you know so but i thought about last
[47:13] night thankfully
[47:15] they have a dad that they can text
[47:20] because if i had set the rule and i
[47:21] wasn't a person i was involved this is
[47:23] the rules for the family and now i'm out
[47:25] of it there's no relationship with you
[47:27] if that's the rules and there's a
[47:28] punishment to the rule there's no appeal
[47:30] there's nothing that can be talked about
[47:34] so now you're done
[47:35] and i tell them this
[47:37] that you're you know you're grounded for
[47:39] life it's a big joke
[47:40] this is the third time you've done this
[47:42] and you're grounded for life well we
[47:43] both know that that's not true we're not
[47:45] going to ground them for life parents
[47:47] really shouldn't say that because you
[47:48] know it's not going to happen
[47:50] but i threaten anyway don't do this
[47:52] again or you're grounded for the rest of
[47:54] your life well what if i leave and get
[47:56] married no you're still grounded there's
[47:57] going to be limitations with your wife
[47:59] or your husband
[48:02] you just get that extreme statement
[48:03] because you're trying to get these kids
[48:06] abide by the rules
[48:07] but in my home there's all the rules and
[48:09] a lot of those have been based upon the
[48:12] word of god some are the word of god
[48:15] some
[48:16] some of the message of the hour all
[48:17] that's valued what the prophet said
[48:20] like when he said he might as well say
[48:22] it to parents this must this is my
[48:24] father's day message today i guess
[48:26] because i don't get one next time
[48:27] brother marcus is here so it's my
[48:28] father's day message but you know
[48:31] brother bram says what should we allow
[48:33] our teenagers to participate in as young
[48:35] teens he said get them around christian
[48:39] fellowship as much as you can
[48:42] i find parents that won't do that
[48:45] i find parents thankfully who do
[48:47] as long as you can as long as they do
[48:49] get them around because it's the
[48:50] influence it's the image it's the it's
[48:52] the whole thing he said get them around
[48:54] and he said if she starts to date a guy
[48:56] that's not a desirable guy discourage
[48:58] her from dating a guy that's not the
[49:00] right type of fella and encourage her to
[49:03] date the right kind of guy
[49:04] sometimes that's all you can do but you
[49:06] should really you know what he's saying
[49:08] you weigh in on it
[49:10] that boy's going to hurt you that's not
[49:11] the right thing stay away from that you
[49:12] should listen to that young people
[49:14] because the red flag that you don't see
[49:17] might be coming through your parent
[49:20] you know they are the holy ghost for you
[49:22] until you get the holy ghost
[49:24] parents don't want to be the holy ghost
[49:26] to their kids
[49:27] no you have a right to do that love them
[49:30] enough to tell them
[49:32] so you know it's it's and we had a thing
[49:34] that they didn't spend the night with
[49:36] uh just anybody they went to a baptist
[49:39] school there but they didn't spend the
[49:40] night with just anybody rarely let them
[49:42] spend the night when they were young
[49:43] with other kids
[49:45] i had to know the kid i had to know the
[49:47] parents i had to know what they believed
[49:48] what they stood for and that was a rule
[49:50] you're just not going to do it
[49:51] because i realize
[49:53] i've got generations in my in my own
[49:55] family going back where they just let
[49:57] them go with just anybody and spend the
[49:58] night with just anybody
[50:00] and then now you have molestation cases
[50:02] and you have these things because you
[50:03] trusted you just wanted to get rid of
[50:06] them for the evening
[50:07] and you put your kids and people you
[50:09] don't know
[50:11] some people rather have their kids go
[50:12] out there and spend time with them but
[50:14] they don't encourage them to come to
[50:15] youth meetings and come to this
[50:18] some bad people there at the church
[50:19] shame on you for doing that
[50:21] our our worst here would be better than
[50:24] some connection to the world and some
[50:26] friend in the world
[50:30] you know i you know i i you don't spend
[50:32] the night and they knew that you know
[50:33] that's it and you're gonna hang around
[50:35] the kids from the church you're gonna
[50:36] attend their youth things you're not
[50:37] gonna attend those things and i just had
[50:39] it it seemed strict and so then when it
[50:41] would come up dad i'm getting i really
[50:43] like this fella you know i like this
[50:44] girl as far as you know we're friends
[50:46] and i didn't i wasn't against them for
[50:47] their friendships but spending the night
[50:49] and going with them to the mall was a
[50:51] different
[50:53] a story different story
[50:56] i don't know those parents i don't know
[50:57] what they believe so but they see i'm a
[50:59] person so that's the rule so they would
[51:01] come sometimes and say dad you know i
[51:03] want you to meet this father and i want
[51:05] your knees and we get together with him
[51:07] and this is how they live and so so they
[51:08] would appeal to me to get to know the
[51:11] father and so once i felt comfortable
[51:13] with what they believed it's a good uh
[51:16] baptist foundational standards of the
[51:17] body they have holiness in their home
[51:18] different things then i felt comfortable
[51:20] i might let him spend the night but it
[51:21] was very rare very rare
[51:26] i don't know if i'm from another planet
[51:28] or what
[51:30] it's just the way we did it i love my
[51:32] children too much just to send them
[51:33] anywhere
[51:36] there's situations sometimes when you
[51:38] give a little room and then
[51:40] satan
[51:41] takes advantage it's a shame
[51:44] but god is great god redeems
[51:51] was telling me about a situation one of
[51:52] my sons and he said i want to go with
[51:53] this guy and so she gave the room to do
[51:56] it because he got to a certain age she
[51:57] said go but she said this is what the
[51:59] boy's going to do he's going to watch
[52:00] these type of music movies he's going to
[52:01] listen to this type of music he's going
[52:03] to do this he's going to do that if you
[52:04] spend the night there that's what you
[52:05] can do all night
[52:06] because it's a discernment in my wife i
[52:08] mean we weren't born yesterday
[52:10] you tell a character a boy but what's on
[52:12] his facebook what he listens to what he
[52:13] does you can tell
[52:16] come on i'm not going to check my
[52:18] discernment out the door
[52:21] so she let him go
[52:23] i don't think you told me about this son
[52:24] you let him go
[52:27] she said this is going to happen this is
[52:29] going to happen this is going to happen
[52:32] came back the next day
[52:34] said mom
[52:35] he did everything you said
[52:37] you were right never wanted to go over
[52:39] there again
[52:40] so you got that little room there that
[52:41] he has to learn a lesson
[52:44] which can be good but you better be
[52:46] protective
[52:48] you're allowed the scripture gives you
[52:50] it's a mandate from the scripture for
[52:51] you to be protective
[52:55] that's what's called scriptural
[52:57] divine love can you say man for your
[52:58] kids
[53:01] but the thing about the rules of my home
[53:03] is that i'm i'm the father and if the
[53:06] father wasn't there without rules
[53:08] with the rules and there was no father
[53:09] there that would be a different thing
[53:11] they can come and talk to me they can
[53:13] come and fellowship with me they can
[53:15] come and talk it out can you say amen
[53:17] and and adam and eve the word that they
[53:19] were given to obey yes they obeyed it
[53:22] but it was a relationship it was beyond
[53:24] just the word it was the word brought
[53:26] relationship and so as i have rules to
[53:29] my whole soul household i'm a person as
[53:31] well and so i'm i'm a person who sets
[53:34] the rule but the person who sets the
[53:36] rules is present he's available
[53:40] can you see what i'm preaching if i
[53:42] preach the word to you
[53:44] i'm not first preaching the word there's
[53:46] a person here
[53:48] jesus christ
[53:50] and the person who wrote the rules is
[53:52] present and wants a relationship with
[53:54] you
[53:56] and isn't it interesting i'm going to
[53:58] have to wrap this up i didn't get
[53:59] anywhere in my notes but i'm going to
[54:00] wrap it up isn't it interesting after
[54:02] the fall
[54:04] and i didn't get to any of the subject
[54:05] about what happens after the fall i want
[54:07] to get on the blaming game and all that
[54:08] but isn't it interesting when all begins
[54:11] to unravel and they broke the word they
[54:14] broke the word and when they broke the
[54:16] word they hindered the relationship
[54:18] isn't it interesting that the person the
[54:21] lord
[54:22] is still trying to find them
[54:27] so they broke the word they lost the
[54:29] word they lost the glory of god it's a
[54:31] mess can you say amen but i can tell you
[54:33] when they're hiding in the bushes
[54:35] he the lord come after them to try to
[54:38] find them
[54:40] this message this word is not just about
[54:43] the word and the commandments and doing
[54:45] them this is about a person can you say
[54:47] amen and i don't care how far you try to
[54:49] leave the word if the person loves you
[54:51] he's going to come and find you
[54:54] adam where are you
[54:56] who told you you was naked what's going
[54:59] on here
[55:01] i've said it many times but i think it
[55:02] was brother ron spencer who said it when
[55:05] when when when lucifer drew a third part
[55:08] of the stars god never went after him to
[55:10] try to bring him back but when one sun
[55:13] when one sun falls
[55:15] he comes down and he's looking for that
[55:17] sun
[55:18] trying to find relationship again
[55:22] this is not about just books and tapes
[55:25] and bibles
[55:26] there's a person of christ that i'm
[55:28] preaching to you and he's here in this
[55:30] service
[55:32] young people he's here in this service
[55:34] we teach the rules we teach the
[55:36] boundaries of courtship we teach this
[55:38] don't wear this that's unmodest but
[55:39] listen this goes beyond us just telling
[55:41] you that this is a person
[55:43] he wants relationship with you
[55:47] he loves you he's here
[55:49] this morning
[55:52] but i want a relationship but i don't
[55:54] want the rules
[55:57] oh there's lots of christians today
[56:00] that dump out all the things that
[56:02] brother branham said
[56:04] but i still want a relationship with
[56:06] jesus christ
[56:08] and
[56:10] in the garden
[56:11] the word
[56:12] was tied right with the person
[56:15] and you can never say well i'd like to
[56:17] have the person
[56:18] but i don't want the word
[56:21] never happened because he is the word he
[56:24] gave you his word it's never going to
[56:25] happen i just want my relationship with
[56:27] jesus christ in my my bible and that's
[56:29] all i need i don't need all this add-ons
[56:32] of william branham
[56:34] be careful what you say
[56:37] i really i mean that respectfully i just
[56:38] want a relationship you can't have a
[56:40] relationship and backslid against the
[56:42] word you can't leave the word
[56:44] and have a relationship with jesus
[56:46] christ
[56:47] but guess what we can have both
[56:51] you can have both
[56:53] and i would like to get into a scripture
[56:54] a couple of scriptures that
[56:57] mentioned dominion because not only did
[56:59] adam and eve have
[57:02] relationship
[57:04] they had the word
[57:05] and all that was holding everything
[57:07] together
[57:09] but they had dominion when they had all
[57:10] that they had dominion
[57:12] which means power
[57:14] when you go to the new testament
[57:17] paul mentions the word and power
[57:19] together all the time it's the word and
[57:20] power it's the word and power
[57:22] when the pharisees see jesus he says
[57:24] they said he teaches but it's not just
[57:26] the word there's power in his word
[57:29] there's power in his word
[57:31] it's not just the word there's power in
[57:33] it
[57:34] so when calvary redeemed us back
[57:36] and now we have redemption back through
[57:39] the word of god we come back to the word
[57:40] we have relationship again but we don't
[57:43] just have relationship we have
[57:46] dominion we have power over the enemy we
[57:50] have power over sin
[57:52] sin doesn't control us we control sin
[57:57] our our habits or our i should say our
[58:00] desires don't control us we by the power
[58:03] of the holy spirit control our desires
[58:06] this comes with power with it and when
[58:08] you know the person he says i'll give
[58:09] you power over unclean spirits i'll give
[58:12] you power over diseases can you say amen
[58:14] i'll give you power over lust i'll give
[58:17] you power over pornography i'll give you
[58:20] power with this holy ghost i'll give you
[58:22] dominion over things instead of things
[58:25] controlling you you're controlling
[58:27] things that's what adam and eve were
[58:28] instead of your finances controlling you
[58:31] you control your finances
[58:33] instead of your temper controlling you
[58:36] you control your temper by the holy
[58:37] ghost
[58:40] praise be his name i love him this
[58:42] morning don't you
[58:44] praise me those scriptures are they were
[58:45] astonished at his doctrine luke 4 32 for
[58:48] his word was with power so when jesus
[58:50] came his word wasn't just commandments
[58:53] anymore it had power with it first
[58:55] corinthians 4 20 for the kingdom of god
[58:57] is not in word but in power i'm not
[58:59] ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ
[59:01] for it's the power of god unto salvation
[59:03] when i came to you i didn't come with
[59:05] enticing words of man's wisdom but i can
[59:08] to you in the power and the
[59:10] demonstration the life of the holy ghost
[59:13] this isn't just commandments this isn't
[59:15] just books and tapes but there's a
[59:17] person that brings power in your life to
[59:20] be able to live above sin
[59:22] first thessalonians 1 5 our gospel came
[59:24] unto you not in word only but also in
[59:26] power and in the holy ghost and much
[59:28] assurance as we know what matter of men
[59:30] we are among you for your sake we stand
[59:34] with all of his word you have the person
[59:36] relationship with the person and it
[59:38] brings dominion dominion
[59:41] over
[59:42] the enemy
[59:44] let's stand together if you would
[59:46] if i get into this the other parts here
[59:48] we'll be here
[59:50] much longer
[59:54] so the relationships after the fall
[59:58] it wasn't what it was before
[1:00:02] but god in his grace said
[1:00:06] i'm going to come and find my own and
[1:00:08] even though calvary wasn't there yet to
[1:00:10] restore the whole redemptive process
[1:00:13] he as the person was finding them
[1:00:17] in the garden of eden finding them
[1:00:19] hiding
[1:00:21] here's everything that came from the
[1:00:22] fall
[1:00:23] guilt
[1:00:24] shame
[1:00:26] blaming one another
[1:00:30] sin
[1:00:31] hiding shame
[1:00:33] knew they were naked so they're hiding
[1:00:35] in is i don't know if it was a matter of
[1:00:37] minutes or hours but
[1:00:39] everything changed because of the fault
[1:00:41] every and their relationship changed
[1:00:43] they're blaming brother francis they're
[1:00:44] passing the buck i want to get into next
[1:00:46] time i preach passing the book and this
[1:00:49] generation that blames everybody else
[1:00:52] that's what the fall brings
[1:00:54] that's what the fall brings if you're
[1:00:56] still blaming everybody else
[1:00:59] that's what the fall brings you're going
[1:01:00] to have to say lord
[1:01:02] give me the holy spirit
[1:01:04] change me because i know when i come out
[1:01:06] of
[1:01:07] come out of this worldly atmosphere and
[1:01:09] come to your kingdom i know i will no
[1:01:11] longer blame anybody else and if i did
[1:01:14] something i'll own up to it bring it to
[1:01:16] the cross
[1:01:17] and i can actually live in victory
[1:01:20] over how anybody treats me bad if they
[1:01:24] treat me bad i can be victorious over it
[1:01:28] if they handle something wrong with me i
[1:01:30] can live victorious over it
[1:01:32] if a preacher done me wrong i can live
[1:01:33] victorious over it if my father did me
[1:01:36] wrong in life i can overcome it i can
[1:01:38] live above it
[1:01:39] think of jesus now when he comes back
[1:01:41] into this earth
[1:01:43] i love the song
[1:01:44] welcome to our world because now he
[1:01:46] comes into our world that's a broken
[1:01:49] world have been living six
[1:01:51] five thousand years after the fall
[1:01:53] broken relationships
[1:01:54] it's a mess and jesus comes into our
[1:01:56] world that way and we're all an absolute
[1:01:59] mess broken homes broken families
[1:02:02] prostitutes everything and he comes into
[1:02:04] that but he's bringing a relationship
[1:02:06] with the father he has a relationship
[1:02:08] with the father
[1:02:11] he doesn't just have the word he has a
[1:02:13] relationship with he's one with the
[1:02:14] father how many believe that
[1:02:16] and that's what he needs because when he
[1:02:18] comes into a broken world he has the
[1:02:20] power to be able to be able to handle it
[1:02:23] to change situations not being in not be
[1:02:25] influenced but he would actually become
[1:02:27] an influence
[1:02:28] with with that in him he would become an
[1:02:31] influence and there we would come
[1:02:32] dealing with situations with a woman
[1:02:34] that's caught in adultery and the same
[1:02:36] thing that happened
[1:02:38] in the garden when god rushed after them
[1:02:40] and he's the person here the woman's
[1:02:42] taking adultery and the only thing in
[1:02:43] this broken world that they had was
[1:02:45] religion of pharisees and sadducees the
[1:02:47] only thing they had to give making
[1:02:48] proselytes if we can just get to the
[1:02:50] church and
[1:02:51] wash you up a little bit and get rid of
[1:02:53] your
[1:02:54] things that you're wearing wrong
[1:02:56] and get you out of your life of
[1:02:57] prostitution run you through through
[1:02:59] psychological
[1:03:00] seminars
[1:03:04] run you through the steps here
[1:03:06] the only thing they had with this broken
[1:03:08] world was
[1:03:09] religion
[1:03:12] and
[1:03:13] religion isn't working anymore it didn't
[1:03:15] work then it's not working now it's the
[1:03:17] only thing they had but jesus was
[1:03:19] different he had a relationship with the
[1:03:21] father
[1:03:23] somebody sent me a quote this morning i
[1:03:24] think kenny and tina sent it out he said
[1:03:27] when you love god
[1:03:29] you love others correctly too
[1:03:32] when you have a relationship with god
[1:03:33] and you're loving him right he's you
[1:03:34] know he's loving you and there's
[1:03:35] relationship you can love others right
[1:03:37] so jesus came with all that he wasn't
[1:03:39] afraid of this broken world he had the
[1:03:41] answer for him
[1:03:43] when he comes into situations like the
[1:03:44] woman and they had every right to say
[1:03:46] she needs to be stoned we've caught her
[1:03:48] we've got the stones in our hand and
[1:03:50] they want to know what jesus says and
[1:03:51] there's nothing to stop the law from
[1:03:53] being acted out there they needed to
[1:03:55] stone her except for one thing except
[1:03:58] for one thing he's present
[1:04:02] and when he's present
[1:04:05] jesus can look through the eyes of the
[1:04:07] father
[1:04:08] and he can see there's a bigger picture
[1:04:11] here you just see her sin and the law
[1:04:14] says to deal with her sin but if you
[1:04:16] deal with that law without the person
[1:04:20] without who they really are you're going
[1:04:22] to deal with that law the wrong way how
[1:04:26] many message things do we have where
[1:04:28] it's all
[1:04:29] the law
[1:04:31] but that's missing
[1:04:33] the person and missing relationship
[1:04:36] has everybody understood what i said
[1:04:37] today
[1:04:39] they had every right to stone that woman
[1:04:41] except for the fact he was there and he
[1:04:42] was looking through the eyes of the
[1:04:43] father and he looked at the big picture
[1:04:45] he says the way i'll deal with this is
[1:04:46] i'll write down possibly their sins
[1:04:48] that's probably what he was doing and
[1:04:49] each one dropped their stones and began
[1:04:51] to run off he said where's your
[1:04:52] accusers they're gone
[1:04:54] then i'm not going to accuse you go and
[1:04:56] sin no more
[1:04:57] he didn't say continue in your lifestyle
[1:05:01] i'm changing you change your goal and
[1:05:04] sin no more
[1:05:05] i don't condemn you either and the only
[1:05:07] way he could do that is he could see
[1:05:11] that she
[1:05:12] was in
[1:05:13] the loins of the father
[1:05:16] she
[1:05:17] was a daughter of god
[1:05:21] lord jesus
[1:05:30] could you help somebody see this today
[1:05:32] lord
[1:05:36] [Music]
[1:05:40] could you help open someone's eyes lord
[1:05:49] the only way that i could say these
[1:05:50] things is because i know you're present
[1:05:52] lord
[1:05:54] your person is here
[1:05:56] your presence is here
[1:05:59] could you open their eyes lord that they
[1:06:00] could see
[1:06:04] you love us lord beyond any father on
[1:06:06] earth or mother on earth could ever love
[1:06:08] us
[1:06:11] you brought back to us
[1:06:13] holy ghost
[1:06:14] relationship again
[1:06:16] that we could be restored back to you
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:21] may that brother or sister or that woman
[1:06:23] that man or that young person
[1:06:25] may their eyes be opened today lord and
[1:06:27] may they find that place
[1:06:31] to say i want to talk with you i want to
[1:06:34] fellowship with you i want to receive
[1:06:36] you
[1:06:37] i want to be in you and you living in me
[1:06:40] i wanted father
[1:06:42] no man can put that desire there
[1:06:47] but you put it
[1:06:49] you put the desire
[1:06:55] i have felt this week lord and i'll just
[1:06:58] speak this to you in front of the people
[1:07:00] i have felt
[1:07:02] there are times when the pressure is so
[1:07:04] great
[1:07:06] and so many different
[1:07:10] fronts that satan is fighting
[1:07:14] i feel so overwhelmed there are times
[1:07:16] the only thing that i can go back to
[1:07:19] is the desire for you
[1:07:22] laying in my heart
[1:07:23] [Music]
[1:07:24] i can't figure out everything i can't
[1:07:26] figure out all situations
[1:07:29] i feel i have a lack of wisdom in some
[1:07:31] situations how to handle it
[1:07:34] but when i feel overwhelmed i know you
[1:07:37] put a desire within me
[1:07:40] to love you and to keep seeking after
[1:07:42] you
[1:07:43] and because you put it there
[1:07:45] no man can take it out
[1:07:48] i feel sometimes defeated i feel
[1:07:51] inadequate i feel
[1:07:53] i've disappointed you
[1:07:55] [Music]
[1:07:58] and i'm sorry for that lord but
[1:08:01] there's no man that can change the
[1:08:02] desire you put there when i was 16 years
[1:08:04] old something happened to me
[1:08:07] and i can never lose this desire
[1:08:09] [Music]
[1:08:11] and i know that most if not all the
[1:08:13] people that i'm preaching to here and
[1:08:15] online it's the same thing
[1:08:18] their lives get they get clouded with
[1:08:20] stuff but there's no question
[1:08:22] they keep coming to the fountain and
[1:08:24] drinking
[1:08:25] they keep desiring something who put
[1:08:27] that desire there lord
[1:08:31] who put that desire
[1:08:35] had to be more than themselves lord
[1:08:40] you take the worst case of somebody with
[1:08:42] their walls up
[1:08:47] your love is more
[1:08:49] stronger
[1:08:51] than any walls that can be up
[1:08:54] love them to yourself i pray
[1:08:57] may they find this relationship lord
[1:09:00] that i'm preaching about
[1:09:03] may our families find deeper
[1:09:05] relationship when our parents and
[1:09:07] children may fathers be connected to

[1:10:13] commandments and your word or the
[1:10:15] message may we never look at it as
[1:10:16] something that was to hurt us
[1:10:20] but may we look at it as something that
[1:10:22] comes with your relationship lord and we
[1:10:24] stay with the word
