your truth is [Music] can't be shaken on this glorious Foundation While others fall here I stand there on Christmas [Music] While others [Music] [Applause] [Music] it'll still be true tomorrow [Music] [Music] here I am While others [Music] here I here I am Hallelujah [Music] eat with me in the scripture God bless you all good to know where we're standing this morning Hallelujah second Corinthians chapter 11 we want to read together this verse of scripture second Corinthians chapter 11 and verse we'll just read verse two through four with an emphasis here in verse 3. for I am jealous over you with The Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ and that's the prophet for the age Paul's speaking that that's his purpose that's his agendas to present the people of God as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his satility so your minds should be corrupted notice now he pulls all the way from the fall in the beginning and says not just what happened not just that we know what happened but he he looks at how Satan come through his subtility and how he dealt with eve and he's saying that the same Enemy enemy will try to work the same way in you can you say Amen so this is our enemy and in the same way that he beguiled Eve through his septility so your minds should be corrupted from what from the Simplicity in Christ that your mind should be corrupted now when we think of corruption we think of your mind's being corrupted by the dirtiness of This World by the filthiness by the immorality we think of a corrupt mind and that is that is corrupt those things uh shouldn't we shouldn't look at those things as a Christian because we corrupt our minds how many knows that the the world and the fornication and adultery and just pornography all these things but we think in terms of of of that type of corruption but see this is this is a bit different is that Satan would in his satility corrupt our minds from the Simplicity that is in Jesus Christ so how many know that God is not the author of confusion so who's the author of confusion Satan's the author of it and so he says there he says I I fear that your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ for if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached or if we receive another Spirit which ye have not received or another gospel so these are things that come after the message has been preached these are the come things that come after the true message has gone forth now we see other another Jesus preach we see another Spirit brought we see another gospel presented and that's the thing that's can corrupt the people's mind and he says you might well bear with him and then I'll just repeat in verse 3 that your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ let's pray Heavenly Father anoint and bless your word as we present it to the people this morning and father may you remove every hindrance from our lives that we could freely receive and freely worship under the word now that you've given us for this age we committed to you in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated I want to begin preaching and also maybe doing some teaching the next few weeks when we have a service we have brother Daryl Ward coming in next week and we have a brother Wednesday night from Poland coming in that was first time to meet him so remember that service Wednesday brother uh I just his name slips me right now but a brother from Poland I know you enjoy his ministry we want to have brother Marcelo Minister for us but the the places that we have to minister we want to go into a subject of the subject matter of the Holy Ghost we want to teach and to preach on the Holy Ghost a little bit of both that's called preaching I want to go into it and speak on it just a little bit and and uh a few weeks ago we had read Matthew 25 which is the parable or a prophecy for our times it speaks about five wise virgins and five foolish virgins and we realized that they were called version virgins and they were Christians they were all Christians they weren't the uh people of the world but in this parable of the end time at the Midnight Hour at the very last hours we find a parable that we have many Christians and the only difference at the last moment is that five of them had oil and the other five didn't have oil that was the only distinction is that five had the Holy Spirit five didn't have the Holy Spirit and that's one of the last Parables before the coming of the Lord is that we have the only distinction between Christians and one who have the oil and ones who don't have the oil so that's a very significant thing and I trust it was a challenge to all of us not to preach condemnation to us but to breach conviction because I think in order to live in this hour and in order to be a Christian and in order to fight against the devil who belittles us and puts us down and fights against us I think we ought to everyone know that we have this oil amen so I think it's essential can you say Amen it's essential for Christians to know that they have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and and so that is the only difference in the closing seconds of time and so but I'm always amazed sometimes when I preach a little bit on the Holy Ghost I'm amazed at the response sometimes and sometimes it's good response it's all good response but I'm amazed when I preach a little bit about the Holy Ghost I'm amazed sometimes the response to that the enemy jumps into the situation and begins to jump in and mess with minds and begins to speak to people and begins to raise other questions you know you preach these things to settle questions but the devil doesn't want questions settled he wants to raise more questions and he wants to raise them in your mind that you begin to fear you begin to doubt you begin to doubt your experience with the Lord and I want to say this morning listen if the Lord has dealt with you in any way it doesn't matter what level if it is the Lord then we should rejoice and praise God for how he's dealt with you in your life and I got to say to you that I've Got Confidence that whatever God has done and you can say I know God did this in my life if you know he's in your life if you'll stay in that channel God will give you everything that you need to finish this journey I say that because the devil was present and he listens to and I'm tired of him messing with people's minds we may struggle we may try to get our hand on things we might have different things but we should stop it at the door stop it at the door when the devil tries to mess and corrupt our minds that's one place he should not be allowed to be in oh I should get an a better amen than that but I find that I find that when that subject is presented it's it's it's such a thing that the devil begins to wrestle with people's minds and raise questions and and so I just want to as a pastor break it down just a little bit if that's all right with you so now as a foundation there are some things that we know about our enemy we have learned through the years serving the lord we there's things that we know about our enemy and we know that Satan puts in extra hours extra time when something good is getting ready to happen to a Believer something good is coming to them if he picks up on it or senses that you're a lot of times he says you're beginning to yield more you're beginning to come to the altar you're getting broken uh you're beginning to respond and Satan is watching you do that and that means he's learned that if there's Brokenness and there's yielding and there's obedience and there's this Rush towards God he gets nervous because he knows something good is coming from God to you and I find the devil's nature is that when he knows something good is coming he tries to jump out ahead of it this is one thing we know about our enemy is he tries to jump out ahead matter of fact with all the messages that have come if you study your Bible you realize when Elijah was going to come on with when John the Baptist was going to come it has been told that there were other men that jumped out there saying that they were have the spirit of Elijah on them in our day we had a lot of Elijah's come in the Pentecostal movements and I'm Elijah well I've got the spirit of Elijah and so all of this to me is a work of the enemy because there's only one true man that God puts the spirit of Elijah on but notice how it comes before the true one comes because Satan is wanting to get out there and interrupt things and confuse people's mind before something good happens and then I'll apply that to your life is God's wanting to pour out his blessings pour out his love pour out his holy ghost it's been said before God wants you to have his Spirit more than you even desire it it's not God up there just holding back and saying I'll just wait a little bit until they live perfect that's not our God if there's any limitations it's you and it's the devil can you say Amen God's wanting to give it to you more than you even desire I can tell that I'm already into this and I'm going to have a good time today I'm taking my coat off already somebody say praise the Lord and I also can tell the devil doesn't like what I'm going to say today but I believe we're going to say it anyway so now that we know things about the devil and he he comes out before something good is about to happen in your life I've watched young people as they get on the brink of really break breaking the sound barrier and breaking through and coming to the altar getting broken just on the brink of getting the true baptism of the Holy Ghost something real and the devil will fight that young person the devil will get them involved in all kinds of other things the devil will keep them from church and keep them from the word the devil will give them some kind of worldly girlfriend or some eyes that he catches at work or some girl she sees a guy and he gives her all that attention and the devil goes ahead to stop something good come into that life he wants to connect with you God wants to connect with you but know your enemy he's stepping out in front of it and he wants to distract you can you say Amen and then in the Bible just before the promise came the devil has learned when people really supernaturally connect he jumps out in front of the promise he gets people nervous before the true promise comes the real the real thing and he jumps out ahead and he tries to tries to get a counterfeit to the real thing coming so that's the way the devil works too we know in the promise of Abraham okay Sarah's saying nothing's happening nothing's happening get Hager my servant maybe God meant that and they try to mechanically or they try to work something up and the devil works in those things keeping a person from the true promise coming to them how many knows the Holy Ghost is a promise it's your promise but the devil through history in the Bible has jumped out in front of the promise to try to confuse and to try to turn it into something else and just before the promise he has learned when people I'm just exposing him because we know him now after all these years just before Satan has learned when people really truly connect supernaturally connect with God's promise for that hour when they connect with it those people become powerful they become invincible they become stronger than ever before and Satan knows that and so he's going to keep them from the true promise of the hour he would love to stop it before it happens he would love to stop the promise before it happens but he's never been able to do it no that's the track record now of God you see the thing is is that once God speaks the promise through a prophet once it's spoken that's it it's as good as done and there isn't a demon there isn't a devil with all there is the devil in his minions the devil there isn't any devil or any spirit that once is spoken by the mouth of a prophet you can never stop that promise coming to pass even if it hasn't even come in the people yet or manifested yet you can't stop it see that's before it even gets to you that's just when it's released because God says when I speak a word it will not return void unto me it will accomplish what I set it out to do and the way that he accomplishes it the way he spreads it out there the red the way God puts out his word is through the mouth of a prophet it's one of the biggest things that most denominational systems Miss as a key in this Bible is that God brings his word through Prophets can you say Amen but Satan he's learned that you know he wants to stop the promise before it happens he's never been able to do that but once a prophet speaks it it's really over then it's over it's it's over you can't stop it the game's over when a prophet speaks to it it's over but then Satan has learned when the people connect with the promise when the people connect with the promise then it's really over did it really can't you can't come against it then you really can't stop it because God doesn't just want to bring a prophet and speaking through a prophet he's got that promise and he speaks it it has a lodging place it has a final end it has a place that he's sending it to and I can tell you he's sending it to your soul so you'll manifest it it's not supposed to manifest in the Bible it's not supposed to manifest in books and tapes it's supposed to manifest in his people and the devil's learned you know he's he's mad this morning because I've exposed them once the promise is spoken and once it lodges in the hearts of the people and starts to manifest there isn't a thing that he can do to stop it and the if the wheels are set in motion that's why I say about your own experience with the Lord because in this series I'm going to separate between what God does as a group and and a generation to the individual because it's the same Holy Spirit but he works with you individually and whenever we compare our experience with someone else's we get in trouble but as an individual God works with you and he has your experience and you have to realize when he begins to deal with you Satan becomes angry and no wonder he wants to mess with your mind and make you doubt everything that God has given you because he's got to stop this process but to me when the wheels are set in Motion in my life when I was 16 years old when I was eight years old and got baptized I did it because the Lord led me to do that the Lord was in my life then a few experiences later and then at 16 he filled me with this Holy Spirit I look at this as a journey and I see God dealing with me and once the process has been set in motion if God started it God will finish it and you start resting in that because remember what brother rap preached that's what the Holy Ghost is is rest he rested the seventh day because the works were finished before the foundation of the world catch that revelation catch that Revelation I'm resting in the Holy Ghost because the works were finished at Calvary everything that was done was done there the victory was one there for my life the victory has already been won all I need to do is yield myself and once things are set in Motion in your life and you say God has Set Me In Motion I'm going to stay right here I'm going to keep following in everything that I need he's going to give me okay thank you brother thank you all praise the Lord so those who are taught and understand the Holy Ghost will know that I just described to you the basic purpose and evidence of the Holy Ghost I've already let it out if you were listening I've just basically described and taught that that is the basic purpose and evidence of the Holy Ghost it's when he the person of Truth the person of the word comes in you to make the promise and word for this hour live for this hour that is the evidence of the Holy Ghost can I say it again it's it's the the basic purpose and evidence of the Holy Ghost is when he the person of Truth the person of the word comes into you to make his word for this hour live through you and to lead you and to guide you into all truth that's how we know he's present that's how we know this message is true because why it was in leading us leading the prophet to speak us into more truth into truth that was covered up veiled truth that was unveiled can you say Amen praise the Lord Hallelujah so so now the person of the word so so after let's look at this after it filled those in the upper room because that's the example we go to right away that's the best example after the Holy Ghost filled those in the upper room the question was raise for those who were looking carnally and looking at here they come out of the upper room something happened up there they weren't up there so but they see the effects of the Holy Ghost they see the effects and the effects was my they were baptized in something that made them just begin to glorify God and lose all their pride and lose all the and come down there staggering drunk drunk like drunk men coming out of the upper room and but what they were doing is not speaking unknown tongues they were glorifying God and they weren't ashamed to do it praise be to God God has done something God has done something but I want to say to you they weren't just saying oh and because the question was what is this Peter what is going on here what is this they were asked and that's the question what is this going on what is taking place and I want to say that Peter did not point to any emotion he said they are not drunk as you suppose people are drunk he didn't say well we were just up there we were all together and man we started to sing and all of a sudden just we just got built up in ocean he didn't say that Peter said what is this Peter pointed to the word he said this this is that which is spoken by the prophet Joel everything that you're seeing here and especially as far as the person of Christ coming by the Holy Ghost in their souls first time ever in history it came on David's spirit and by the way the Holy Ghost came so much in the neighborhood it couldn't come on his soul yet because there was no Calvary his soul had the serpent nature you can't put the Holy Spirit on the serpent nature so but David with the Holy Ghost on his spirit worshiped and danced and and glorified God and it was only on his spirit glory be to God with it just the Holy Spirit on his Spirit he says I was glad when they said unto me let's go to the house of the Lord if you're hungry for the Holy Ghost and it's doing something to you you might be saying the same thing I was glad when it was church time I wasn't looking for a reason to miss it my schedule's too tight the Holy Spirit leads a person to say I'm glad it's church now I'm ready to go to church oh somebody ought to give me an amen somewhere without them because so now I've got to get on this is that now it can come in the soul and but Peter did not say we're having a big Revival here and there's there's something strange going on I don't understand what's going on but it just feels good people Peter never said that Peter could take the word that came from the prophet Joel and say What's Happening Here In The Souls of men is right here in the scripture it's a promise in Joel and that promise now after hundreds of years is happening and has happened in this Upper Room what was happening was not just an emotion it was the word being fulfilled for that hour and that's why brother Brent says you've got to take your experience back to the word is that okay with everybody it's to the word this is that it was it was just I don't know we're just all drunk and we don't know what's going on but I'm enjoying it would you it's like people come here and say what did he say today I don't know what he said but it sure felt good come on people and you know I'm correcting things because we can't live on the surface we can't live on Bubble dances we can't just live on a Feeling can you say Amen Monday morning the feeling may be gone but the word in our life is not gone the promise is not God what God has done in your life is not gone so that's why we can shout and rejoice on Monday morning the same as we do on Sunday at church that's why our Revival is not to the next cat meeting a Revival is every day in the Holy Ghost and we don't need any music we don't need anybody around we don't need Kitty we don't need the drummer we don't even need the preacher the revival can stir up within us on Monday morning and say devil I'm ready to meet you Hallelujah yes sir brother Marcelo if you invite me I'll come to preach this in Mexico praise be to God Hallelujah what is this let's book the trip let's go tomorrow I'm ready they said what is this Peter he referred he didn't refer to anything except the word he went to the Lord this is that not emphasizing the emotion of it he said this is that was the motion part of it yes but remember I said we don't know how everybody worshiped in their emotion we don't know how we weren't there so some people felt the presence of the Lord they knew something changed tongues of fire set upon each of them they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and so but we we do not know that every person worshiped exactly the same way so don't assume and put it God in a box we don't know all we know is they were changed they were filled with the Holy Ghost is this helping anybody here this morning so this is the word being fulfilled in Us in this hour there was a reason Peter said what is this this is the word being fulfilled in us there's this is the promise happening in me there was a reason for the outward motion there was a reason that they were drunk in the spirit and glorifying God the word the promise was happening something on the inside was happening and it was showing up on the outside he the person came in them to fulfill the promise of that hour it's from the inside out not the outside in what is the Holy Ghost when it really trumps really comes to you it's work it's the inside out not the outside in you don't get caught up in something on the outside and don't get nothing real on the inside it's in the inside out not the outside in so the devil tries to stop the promise if he can't stop it which he can't he looks to mess with it afterwards he tries to get it before he can't do it and then he tries to do other things maybe while it's going on but he really observes and watch watches what it is that's happening outwardly and tries to copy it but he can't copy the real life of the Holy Ghost Inside a Believer he can't get it himself because if he if he if he got it himself he'd have to be justified Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost then he wouldn't be the devil he'd be your brother and you'd have to shake his hand but when you go down that path of justification sickness and baptize with the true Holy Ghost he's he's your enemy can you say amen and so now Satan watches I've said it this way if he he's watching everybody in in Judea and everybody in Jerusalem is watching these come out of the out of the upper room but Satan is watching too and he can't duplicate or copy what's happening to them on the inside but he has through countless years tried to copy the acts and the manifestations of the Holy Ghost now why why would he do that why would he try to copy that because he can't have the life he can't do that so he can't find the source of what's really happening in the soul level he can't get there he has no hands to touch that he can't do it but he can copy he's a copycat he's a copycat he's a duplicate he's trying to recreate situations recreate atmospheres do that and but why does he do it he does it because he wants to misdirect people from the power of the Holy Ghost so now you can say what I don't say what the scripture proclaims and what the prophet proclaims now Satan is able to in that atmosphere every gift of the nine spiritual gifts can be imitated I don't understand all that I just know that it's true he can't touch the life of it he can't change a life but he can make a life copy what's going on and he can allow people to get under because the rain falls on the just and the unjust now why would he do that and why wouldn't he go just say let's go to the bar man forget all this rejoicing in this holy ghost stuff let's just go serve the world uh he's smarter than that so if he can through 2000 years of church history if he can get people to come back into Works doing Works doing things then he can Sidetrack a real genuine New Birth and a change in the soul and if they do the works if they imitate the emotion or if they can do all the stuff that's around it then he deceives that person because they didn't really get the real thing and that's all he needs because when they get the real thing they become an invincible Army he don't know how to deal with them and I've said before if he was really smart which he's not he's dumb if he's really smart he would have never planted Jesus in the ground what a dummy because Jesus already says you plant this in the ground it's going to bring forth so he hit for three three and a half years he had one to deal with with the power of the Holy Ghost all over him he plants it in the ground it resurrects and a few days later he's got 120. talk about Harvest and then thousands of souls came to the kingdom God got filled with the Holy Ghost and the thing is going what did I do I was better just to deal with one now I got 120. now I got a thousand with the same Spirit on them because he's dumb he didn't realize that if you allow that to be planted into that that's what grows and it grows and it grows this Holy Ghost grows and grows and grows it is the power to grow it is the power to bring the full promise it's the power to take you to a Rapture it has power that Satan Can't Stop amen so this is what we know of Satan as well he likes to complicate and confuse what God has done or is doing what God sends is always simple it just needs simple faith now I'm quoting the message now how many know that the message comes God sends it in simplicity that it confounds the wise don't you ever make this message complicated that's the devil when God sends something it's simple and matter of fact it's so dirt simple that most of the world miss it and say that can't be God but we know that the message is simple and we know that it takes just simple Faith as a mustard seed to believe it that's what he needs that simplifies it God said what he sends is simple can everybody just get that point this morning to say what God sends is simple say it with me what God's sins is simple no everybody say it with me what God's sins is simple and the way to receive it is through simple faith simple faith not complicated faith simple faith the devil Works overtime and puts in extra hours to take what comes from God and to complicate it where our text says in the minds the corruption in our thinking to take something simple that's come from God and to confuse it questions can confuse people instead of help people so you always say who's asking the question what's the source of the question there's nothing wrong with a question but what's the spirit behind the question I think the Pharisees motive for asking questions was different than a sincere believer and a lot of times Jesus didn't even answer the questions he would answer it with another question because you know Jesus knew it wouldn't do any good with the Pharisees to to spend three hours having coffee with them four hours spent a week with them with that because that spirit's already banned Pharisees are already bent on their questions are for a reason I already don't believe this I already am against this I already you know and so because he knows that then he could but you see when another question comes of a Believer it's the source of the question you know when I had that uh 15 10 15 years ago when I had a lot of questions come about things uh and they said I'm I'm they even said I'm sincerely asking these things but then the questions they sent to me in an email I went online and I did a little thing and I realized that the very same questions came from a source they weren't being sincere because the questions were veratum from another source so the simplicity so let's just let's just lay some more foundations I'm only on the foundations the Simplicity of Christ in Paul's day was the message of Paul when he says corrupt your minds from the Simplicity in in Christ it was the message of Paul that was the Simplicity of Christ and the message that pointed people to Christ how many leave a true message will Point people only to Christ so the the Simplicity of Christ was Paul's message it was not just Jesus went to Calvary and that's all it was Paul's message of the Christ in you you see now you have Christ and his work finished work at Calvary then you have his resurrection bringing us the power so it can be poured out upon us and so you have that that that which he did but now Paul comes into what he calls the mystery of Christ that term had never been heard before the Jews certainly didn't understand it and a lot of people that Paul was talking to didn't understand it what are you saying Paul the mystery of Christ there was a mystery hidden in Christ it wasn't just that he went to Calvary it wasn't just about that it just it wasn't just that he took away our sins and it wasn't just that he resurrected something came from that act that would affect our lives in the power of the Holy Ghost so Paul began preaching the mystery of Christ and that was part of the whole message of Christ because because it was bringing this mystery that would ultimately be not just talking about Jesus in the four gospels but the mystery is Christ in you the hope of glory so it wasn't just that Paul he he he directed people to Calvary in the work of Calvary he directed people to the resurrection he talked about but it wasn't just he talked about the ACT he was preaching the power that comes in our lives from that act in our lives if he was only talking about Calvary in the resurrection then why I would say this why did we need all of Paul's teaching why did we need a prophet after Calvary if if we did not need anything after Calvary and we only just we can believe in what Calvary did for us and that's it but we don't need any Paul's teaching that's the amazing thing about it Paul is acknowledged by most of the Christian denominant nations as being one there's only a few that don't believe his stuff but they give him the authority they give him the authority to speak about Christ and 14 books of the New Testament belong to Paul and is considered the Canon of scriptures it's the authority of God that was spoken through Paul how does that work when you're trying to present a prophet in the same level as Moses and him coming for our days so no no it can't happen in our day and we give Paul The Authority that what he came was the word of God how do you do that and then deny a prophet for this hour you can't it doesn't it doesn't work together that way is anybody listening so how did Paul he begin to preach of course he preached Church order and he preached marriage and divorce the same as Jesus preached he preached uh Church order he preached putting the gifts in order he you know he's preaching the gifts saying God pours these gifts upon the body of Christ he preaches all that but the along the lines he's he's pointing people to the power of the Resurrection if by if I be risen with Christ can you imagine people some people saying wait a minute wait a minute now I I'd like to hear about when Jesus came out of the Tomb I like to sing about it uh I like to sing the Hallelujah Chorus at church and all we're just so excited about talking about the resurrection and we do here on Easter but but I want to let you know it's not just Easter I talk about the resurrection I'm preaching the power of the Resurrection every service and when he says the term when he says if I be risen with Christ they're going please tell me what you mean because something more happened when you come out of the Tomb that I can rise with Christ as well in the power of the Resurrection through the Holy Ghost so a prophet why why do we need a prophet we don't need it we just need to look at the story of Calvary he not only talked about the account of Calvary and the empty tomb but he was preaching the power in our lives that comes from that where did Paul get his Thor authority to say First Corinthians 14 37 if you guys want to bring it up I want to ask you for First Corinthians 14 37 where did get Paul get the authority to say this in First Corinthians 14 37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord I could be very carnal right now and say who gave that man to the authority to say the word that came for him and the things that he wrote are the Commandments of the Lord I can see a Jew saying hey you ain't nothing we've got our Commandments from Moses I've got my Ten Commandments and that's all I need and you're not one of them to bring Commandments and he's taking his message why did Paul say that not to build up his own Ministry not that he was not a flesh man himself but the word the thus said the Lord that came through him like it did Moses when it came and it was thus said the Lord it was the word of God where'd he get the authority to say that where do you get the 30 in first Thessalonians 2 and verse 13. first first Thessalonians 2 and 13 where do you get the authority to say that uh for this cause also first Thessalonians 2 13. for this cause also think we god without ceasing because when ye receive he's talking to the Thessalonians when you receive the word of God which we you heard of us ye received it not as the word of men but as it does in truth the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe I don't know but uh he preached Paul's message was the Simplicity of Christ it's others who's anointed by Satan came and presented another Jesus and another gospel and another Spirit what for Satan likes to confuse the minds of the people from what God has sent so now in relation to my subject on the Holy Ghost in relation to the Holy Ghost I don't know of a subject Satan has tried to mess with so much as the subject of the Holy Ghost and we're not just talking about recently we're talking about since it started since this filling and this baptism and this change in this born-again experience happen Satan has tried to confuse people's minds as to the interpretation of it what it is he wants to confuse people isn't it amazing that the most important thing that God can ever do to an individual is one of the most confused things by Satan in the church it should say to us that's pretty important if if you look at something that's been so confusing and trying to confuse the young people trying to confuse everybody for ages uh if you say wow Satan's really doing his work to confuse my mind on this and belittle me and make me feel uneasy and make me feel like I don't have anything from God uh I just trust the Lord can lead me into some things to help us because it's Satan's work to confuse things it's Satan's work to say something simple and make it complicated I don't know of any subject isn't it amazing that the most important thing that God has ever done in an individual is one of the most confused things by Satan we ought to always be aware of this Satan is around and know that we know the say the Devils listen we know that we know the devil's lying to us when his lips are moving is that okay we know that when is the devil lying when his lips are moving and he's speaking to our minds okay if if God is not the author of confusion then who is the author of that it's Satan is the author of confusion somebody has to be the author he's the father of lies he's the author of confusion it's your experience with Christ that he will discredit the most and try to discredit the most and try to play with your mind the most to try to figure it all out and the more we try to figure it out the more confusing it becomes to make you doubt it can you say Amen the Jews could dwell on how they rejected Christ and we heard this Wednesday night in the teaching from Brother rap the Jews could dwell on how they rejected Christ Christ forever and they actually killed their Messiah but then mercy came to them oh listen to the service Wednesday night our merciful god we can't limit God's word mercy friends you can't live in God's mercy to anybody you don't have a right to do that and so God's mercy came to the Jews who actually killed their Messiah and somehow at the end he gives them another opportunity and what he says was they've been mourning for days and they've been distraught but now everything changes as God steps in and gives them mercy and gives them another Revival they didn't deserve that at all but there came a time that it's time to stop mourning over what you've done and his brother rap said it when he spreads his Mercy to us it's time to rejoice and brother rap said oh that feeling that's going to come to those Jewels someday as they know they kill their Messiah but an overwhelming more powerful feeling comes of mercy and and and and and and spreads through the glory be to God you talk about a Revival and that's what should happen when his Mercy is shed abroad in our hearts because you don't deserve it either well they killed the Messiah well how many times in your life have you stepped upon the cross of Christ and rebelled can you say Amen but that's not now his mercies come in your life so now those Jews it's time to stop Mourning it's time to stop mourning it's time to start being stop being unsettled about well maybe I don't get the grace of it's time to stop doing that and it's time to start enjoying the mercy of God who has come to your life if some of you don't get anything else today I'm telling you as your pastor it's time for you to get rid of the past and stop letting the devil corrupt your mind about the Holy Ghost or whatever it is and it's time for you to lift your hands and say I know God's mercy has come to my life and that Mercy will take me the whole way and that's it there's no more discussion there's no more of confusion can you say Amen Hallelujah and that's when you get that coffee cup in the morning I got it I said it on my desk I was going to bring it out here Brandon bring it out here later because I'm I might order one for all of you I found this coffee cup it's a great big one you get this coffee cup and I gave one to my daughter when she was going through her hard times here last year I gave I bought one for her and it just simply says not today Satan and if I get you one for Christmas this year you need to use that coffee cup every day because this isn't just on Sundays not today I'm at church saying no no it's on Monday it's on Tuesday not today I don't have time for it I don't have time for you to corrupt my mind my life has been exposed to the mercy of God and that Mercy will take me the rest of the way there's no more discussion why do we give the devil a place at our breakfast table why do we give them a place in our minds don't even give them a place to talk to you so we know oh we know some things about anything I've got to move on from this but uh so now we need to rejoice in the mercies of God we don't know how we deserved it but we're not going to try to figure out how we deserved his grace yes did you bring coffee in it I need a coffee let's give a hand to this buddy you don't know what this guy does for me and for the kingdom of God love you that's how we need to get up every morning if you want to use this just just set it right on the table and Satan comes your mind says pointed it not today Satan how many will do it all right whoever raised their hand gets a cup this Christmas I'm getting you one oh it's too bad only 10 of you that's it let's look those up somebody marry him my secretary let's look those up and get them I'm going to get one for everybody here in the church I may be overextending myself here but man if it makes you put that in front of the devil I'm buying it for you whatever is needed but you don't need just a cup you need an aggression against the enemy say stop messing with my mind this is not your playground to give me your thoughts you don't have a right to interpret my experience on the Holy Ghost and the mercies of God Only God can tell me what I've got I don't have to figure it out I don't need the devil helping me try to figure it out it's not something you can figure out so let's stop Satan doing that let's stop making confusion you know uh this is really a bit carnal but I was I always think of a little clip of a movie that I watched years ago and this in this movie there's this man that's he's supposedly insane and so he's hounding his doctor he's trying to get over his doctor and he just you know he's just always telling and so he's a little messed up proves at the end he's not that messed up the doctor ends up being more messed up than him so I'm not recommending movies here but I can never get away from what he the doctor goes on vacation and he's trying to to track down where the doctor is on vacation and get a hold of him he's trying to find him so he calls the operator she's got his number and his address is out hello hello Betty hello um I'd like to have his number if I could I'm having a real hard time I need to talk to my doctor and she said now you know you can't have that number you know I I know Betty I know but you know there's been some confusion about things and I laugh I know this is so dumb but I laugh at that all the time because there's no confusion at all he's creating the confusion it seems there's been some confusion I'm going no there's no confusion the doctor doesn't want you he doesn't give his number out case closed but there's Betty there's been some confusion no no I'm not doing it click oh that's it it's over but I got to thinking last night sorry for laughing at that movie but I said that's the devil and that guy was creating confusion for his own benefit that's the devil why does he create confusion in your minds because he's going to get the worship and the benefit at the end he's going to defeat you and he Satan's going to get the Victory and you're going to be defeated he's doing it for his own agenda but you need to be like that secretary that operator and that doctor says no the rules are still the same you can't get my number when I'm on vacation you can't have it there is no confusion I don't talk to you and you don't talk to me when I'm resting in the Holy Ghost when I'm on a vacation through the Millennium in the Holy Ghost can you say Amen praise the Lord I love when the Lord brings things that's not in my notes isn't that the whole isn't that the Holy Ghost is it an arrest isn't it the ultimate vacation from the works that you try to work your way into heaven the Holy Ghost is that come unto me all you that are weary and heavy laden from all your Works trying to gain entrance into heaven and I will give you the comforter I will give you rest rest in my finished work at Calvary the work has been done follow me obey it be obedient to me and rest in me but I made a mistake quickly bring it under the blood of Jesus Christ and get back to your rest Satan there there is no confusion you're trying to create confusion and there is no confusion you don't have my number when I'm on vacation and you're not going to get it praise the Lord he makes confusion when there's none to get what he wants to bother you to bother the doctor that's the devil the service this service here today will just be some foundations of course but I trust that you're listening I haven't even got into the Holy Ghost yet much but I these are foundations and the foundation today is that be aware that this thing that you're seeking or that you have will be one of the worst things that Satan tries to confuse in your mind you must be aware of that this is the subject this is the thing and even in our ranks I believe sometimes Satan is working to try to confuse it but right along it's the true Holy Spirit change in lives but it makes it confusing for some young people and someone I get different things I could get people changed and then I get people confused about certain things that's because the enemy Works Among Us sometimes Satan in the beginning playing with Eve's mind from the Simplicity of the believing the promise Satan at the end right now is playing with the people's minds and their thinking taking us from the Simplicity of Christ I fear that he is doing the same thing now friends in the last days but you're you've got to find your rest and that's in the Holy Ghost the rest is in the finished work of the Lord oh I'm going to show that it's I'm going to show through this series it's a finished work and it's it's happened in you no matter what the devil says the message is the Simplicity of Christ then the message today I believe is the Simplicity of Christ the message was never meant to be complicated and Satan has more access to complicate this message because this is the day he bursts forth with the revelation of the Seven Seals that what's in the book of Redemption all these seals Mysteries all the Mysteries I'm going to read the mysteries in the mid in a minute that God has revealed through the seventh angel when you have a day that's bursting forth with all the Mysteries then Satan has the opportunity to take those things and complicate a simple message I love my wife's testimony that she was scared to read the seal book for years and just say oh my goodness that's way out of my level she was a Christian but I'm staying away from that the ministry she was under when she grew up made it such a she had a pastor that uh you know he just got up and read quotes that's basically did the whole service and he had an altar there and he had all this quote books because he didn't have you know an iPad so he brought all the quote books and they were stacked high and he would take one he'd read a quote close it take one read another quote and that was basically his preaching that's what she grew up under well then that Minister ended up following in adultery unfortunately and so all the confidence is lost and everything and so it's the only the Holy Ghost and the grace of God that brought all of her family back into Brothers Donny's Church they got the true Holy Ghost and his love the word ever since amen but in her experience you scared to listen to the seal book and then she said I need to I'm hungry to hear what God Said So she gets into it and her testimony is that after I read the seal book it wasn't mysterious at all she said the main thing I heard in that is not just all the Mysteries revealed but I heard my name I heard my position in Christ I seen my predestinated position by reading the seal book some of you haven't read it and you go to this assembly you should you're missing out on what God sent us isn't the you know the message has become can we agree that Satan has done his work to complicate the message of this day he's done his work you know to me a child should be to be able to understand when things are presented over the pulpit two or three families here and they've moved in and it's not about me but they said one of one of the family a couple families said we started to stream you and our children started to connect with your ministry our teenager said dad I understand what he's saying and that was one of the reasons to pray about it and see you're okay because that's an important thing we can't preach this way over the head of all the young people and the children I think we should present Christ and this message that a child could understand and if I'm preaching something deep here this morning and some of them don't understand that's why brother Paul has this cup up here because they might understand this not today Satan can you say man so they catch the subject and so we should have a message that even the child could understand the devil takes us from the Simplicity that's in the word let me just say this isn't our world become complicated enough say we live in a convenient World a convenient world it's more convenient with all of our technology not for me they made us a more convenient world and they've and I remember brother Branham referring to Suzanne Wesley who had I think 17 children raised them all in the admonition of the Lord got up at five and had an hour or so of prayer I don't mean to make any of you mothers feel bad but you know and then she raises all these children and most of them went on to become preachers and different things just a great influence on their lives and and so he said though that he said she had all that time for prayer and I remember Luther saying he said I've got so much to do today he got up an hour five or four or five in the morning to pray he said I've got so much to do today I'm going to have to get up an hour earlier to pray two hours because I've got so much to do but Susanna Wesley he said he said we've got she washed all those clothes for 17 kids by hand on a thimble board or whatever they had we've got dishwashers we've got clothing washers and he lists all the modern inventions to make it convenient and less time to pray than ever something really weird about that it says to me that the world is becoming more complicated and not more simple the world's becoming more difficult it's not getting and so the world's becoming that way if the world is becoming more complicated then do we have to let Satan complicate our walk with Christ too is anybody listening we live in a complicated world we live in pressure we live in financial pressure how are we going to make ends meet all these other things but if it's a complicated world it's hard to make a living it's hard to put things together and you're sometimes you're worried about it what's the next step what am I going to do you need to leave those cares to the Lord but listen one thing don't let the devil complicate your walk with the Lord just leave it tell Satan to leave that alone I tend to run from things that are complicated in this world so much has become complicated we all tend to run from things that are complicated and but we're drawn to stuff that we can get a hold of and it's simple for us I think that's in human nature I think young people gravitate Sinners gravitate I was telling the brother Jared and brother Brandon in the office about a quote that I read this week and he says if we have all these things going on in church and The Sinner comes in and they don't understand Paul said that you know he said if you speak in tongues in the service and don't interpret he said those unbelievers are going to think are they mad because he can understand what's being said God speaks with understanding that's in the Bible now so it's all something and and he he quoted he says it will drive the unbeliever or this it'll drive The Sinner away when he comes and he can't understand it'll drive the center away we're not here to drive the center away we're supposed to present something simple to them that they can latch on to something that they're drawn to Simplicity if it's all complicated they just throw their hands up and say I don't understand a clue what's going on I think a lot of our environments in our ranks are that way I'm not preaching against anybody personally but I think we've made it complicated that it's hard for the center to find something to latch onto can I get more amens we need to this is a simple message they're a Hungry Heart preach the Holy Ghost preach the clarity of the word that they can get a hold of something I'd run away from stuff the company my wife got another car and I can't figure out where the the gears are because now they're putting gears in every other place in this one I said hon where's the gear I want to I want to drive this I can't find drive because they have dials now and they have it everywhere and over here and over there and so come to find out her new drive and re rewind reverse is in the stick that's supposed to be for the windshield wipers it's there that's her gears now to me that's supposed to be windshield wipers and somebody should have never changed that they complicate it's like home where's the gift she said it's up here you bring this to drive you this way for rehearse this way oh my goodness so I get that thing in the drive and one day we're driving to Columbus or somewhere we're going and I forget that that's not the windshield wiper and it starts to rain and I flip that thing down in reverse while we're going 60 miles an hour and I hear a sound out of it and I hear a sound out of my wife too Paul Paul thankfully they must have some protection on there and I didn't destroy your car everything's complicated I can't figure out all this stuff the world is so complicated it's not simple anymore as the world advances it becomes more complex it becomes more frustrating I don't need my walk with a lore frustrate I don't need that to be frustrating I don't need the devil to be confusing me and making me doubt my walk with the Lord I want to keep it simple can you say man everything's confusing and and you know if when there's a lot of choices for something it can make it confusing we're living America we got tons of choices we've got tons of eating outputs if you go out there's tons of places that's actually bad it's actually it's laodicean it makes people soft it makes people proud can you say amen I can go into another country and go into the little grocery store and I need shampoo and there's one brand of shampoo and if you want shampoo it's real simple you buy it and you take it back it's real simple we go in Kroger and we've got a mile long aisle of just shampoos how stupid is that how confusing is that and they've got one for every one of your hairs Curly Straight a little bit straight on the ends curly you read all the labels and you're going oh my kind of like when you're in a Bible bookstore and you got the different Bibles oh my goodness the Army Bible the youth Bible the okay so the the shampoos there's all different kinds and chamfers every kind of hair I'm telling you choices like that makes people spoiled and it actually is confusion I had a guy come into an office uh office supply place and he got frustrated because he's looking for a pencil and he says can somebody show me a comment I just want a common pencil where do you find a pencil these days that's the way it is where do you find just a simple shampoo because it's a it's for everything of hair and even people with no hair brother Brian says we are living in a day of confusion I don't know if you guys have that first quote we are living in a day of confusion we're living in a day that man and women hardly know what to do everything is it seems to be in a turmoil everything it seems to be there's so many different ways to look that's Satan to do that so he's just not talking about shampoo there he's talking about even the gospel with the internet and all this there's so many different ways to look at things and you know what it brings confusion like it did the Tower of Babel how can I stop this from happening confuse their language Babylon is compute confusion and we're called out of Babylon but he says we're living in a day of confusion so many things and you get frustrated about it I could go on and on about airports that are supposed to be more convenient and better customer care and I feel like I when I go to the airport I'm doing everything now I'm putting the tag on my bag I'm getting the tickets I'm and I was I'm looking at that person up behind that desk and saying you used to do all this for me what do you do now and I did one trip I carried my bags up there I got them all ready to go and I said this was bad but I said do you want me to take them to the plane and put them up on the plane as well these bad it's a bit of sarcasm you know in in serves is this the time he shows that the last day's messenger and message is sent to clear up confusion not to create more now I'm going to read some of these these uh I'm going to read his quote first and then I'm going to read some of the Mysteries that are revealed and then I'm going to try to close it with this because I'm not getting anywhere near finishing here today now the sounding Force this messenger the seventh angel here is sounding forth his message so that laodicean church notice his type of message now it wasn't to the first Angel wasn't given that second Angel third fourth fifth sixth but it is the seventh angel that had this type of message what was it notice this type of message finishing all the mysteries of God that are written in the book so that we understand there were seven stars in his right hand Jesus in Revelations 1. he explains later in two or three that the Seven Stars are the seven Messengers he sends to the seven churches so we know they're Messengers then we understand that those were not just local churches they were throughout history and gave the characteristics of all the churches as brother raps taken us through on Wednesday nights every other Wednesday night and so then when you get the seventh one there's something specific about what he does we're in the seventh age the last age so there's to be a messenger to the seventh Age and what he does is finishing he says in the days of the voice Revelations 10 7 in the days of the voice of the Sabbath Angel when he shall begins his album The Mystery of God should be finished he doesn't say that about the fifth sixth third fourth those angels have their work throughout the ages but this seventh one he's supposed to finish all the mysteries of God that are written in the book and then brother Branham lists all the Ministries and he also takes some of these out of his Scofield bible because Schofield mentions these Mysteries that are supposed to be settled next next thing do you have that slide do you have a slide that has the mysteries on it there so here's some of these are Schofield the Kingdom of Heaven is a mystery finished by the seventh angel the Kingdom of Heaven Israel's blindness during this age we didn't understand why they were blinded now we understand it the translation of the living Saints at the end time of this age that's the Rapture the New Testament Church as one body composed of both Jews and Gentiles the church is the bride of Christ The Living Christ same yesterday today and forever Christ says the Incarnate fullness of the godhead embodied in whom is all Divine wisdom God in this is restored to man The Mystery of iniquity is settled and that Revelation is finished by the southern Angel The Seven Stars of Revelation he's actually the one that begs who their names are he's the only one qualified because the seventh angel is not just an angel but he's a prophet and it takes a prophet to settle well who's the seven measures there was hundreds of thousands of Godly men Through the Ages that God used by the Holy Ghost but he picked out seven that he's the one that placed with the seminar that are the Angels in his right hand because he had to pick the ones that were closest to the original word and didn't compromise on that word and they they believed that so he settles the Seven Stars of Revelation the mystery Babylon The Prostitute the mother of harlots he breaks that mystery because we didn't know that who that was until the end time these are Mysteries that these are all the Mysteries and not all of them but Mysteries to be finished by the seventh angel now then he goes on to say brother Brahm the next thing that's some of the Mysteries that this Angel is supposed to wind up all the mystery all the mysteries of God and the other and may I say with this with reverence and not referring to myself but referring to the angel of God the serpent seed that's been a hidden Mystery All Through The Years what happened in the Garden of Eden was to be settled by the seventh angel it's in the Bible but it was covered over with man's ideas the Jews knew who what happened in the garden right Paul knew what happened to Garden but it gets lost to church history the serpency that's been hidden Mystery the grace straightened out in the end time by the seventh amen Grace straightened out not disgrace but real true Grace because he had the one side of armenianism and then Calvinism one but so far to predestination that everybody's saved and they could smoke and drink and live any kind of life but they're predestinated that's the bad extreme form through the Church of that then you got the other extreme of just basically uh Holiness trying to get through through works of Holiness and how you dress is how you get into heaven it's the two extremes so Grace had to be straightened out not a disgrace but real true Grace seven Angel did that no such thing as Eternal burning hell you'll burn from a million years that's that's not true but anything that was eternal had never had a beginning end and hell was created all these Mysteries everybody's ears perked up now The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did that was said perfectly that balanced it out with one sentence now I want to ask stop on that mystery and that's what the seventh angel is supposed to come and settle the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation why does he have to bring that up because Church systems particularly the Pentecostal denominations messed up the baptism of the Holy Ghost number one to say if you speak in tongues that's the evidence that you got it but second of all if you have one of the nine spiritual gifts working in your life if you have this happening if you speak in tongues if you do this and they start attaching all the manifestations to the evidence of the Holy Ghost without the life and it becomes if you write down the feelings if you felt that sensation you must have the Holy Ghost because of that Pentecostal Traditions attached to the word of God the seven angel had to come and balance it out and get the middle of the road receiving the bachelor's Holy Ghost without sensation she's the mystery of it but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost in you performing the same because Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also but we're not sign Seekers we don't follow the signs the signs follow us and Pentecost follows the signs builds up the signs but we don't follow the signs but the signs do follow us we should we should say Lord let me be available let the signs follow my life but I'm going to read a quote to you a young person asked a young one in the Lord asks but do I expect that individually from my life all the time brother I said no that's to the church you're going to see that happen but as an individual we shouldn't apply that happening every day to our lives I'll read it in another sermon but I just thought I'd now look at this next statement what time is it okay next statement and now I'm going to try to close you understand where I'm going with this this mystery had to be settled too and I think people need to go back and read this and read with because this has to be balance the mystery of water baptism where the extreme trinitarianism has brought it into the titles of father now look at that look at that word extreme so now the mystery of water baptism has to be settled just like all why does all these Mysteries have to be settled and balanced by the seventh angel messenger because of that word right there extreme and even the baptism of the Holy Ghost as tender and as special a thing simple thing that is to the person that's hungry Satan takes it and he takes it to this extreme and he takes it to this extreme let me talk about denominations our precious Baptist systems not the brothers but our Precious Precious system baptism teaches when you believe then you've received the Holy Ghost so now you have to make a confession I believe Christ died for my sins not knowing the life that's changing that so now because they believe you have the Holy Ghost that's an extreme because there's no power of a life there then the Pentecostals take away to sensation and emotion and tongues that's the Other Extreme and we still have the enemy sometimes working to take the baptism of the Holy Ghost to two extremes I remember my dad being in Dayton Ohio I believe and he was at a church and I was just a teenager and this other teenager come up and talked to Dad and he was crying and he was struggling he says I just don't know if I have the Holy Ghost he said I'm just struggling and this guy stepped up to her says you believe brother Brown was a prophet don't you you believe this message he just went on to give him the drill you know and he goes well well yeah yeah I I believe I believe he's probably just so tender you know and that man said in front of my dad he said you've got the Holy Ghost if you believe he's a prophet you've got the Holy Ghost stop crying and my dad bowed his head and walked away because he realized we were talking 35 40 years ago in our ranks that that's how it gets presented to a heart too hungry for God and he just hung this because he wasn't in that church he couldn't help the boy further but he could have taken that tender heart and taken him on to know the Lord to know the Lord of this message you must meet the Lord of this message first is that okay with everybody it's the Christ of this message it's the power that comes in a life that we want to get the people to we're not getting them to a church can you say brother Brian said that's the problem he said I fear we're getting too many people to the church and not to Christ we must get them to Christ not some books and tapes and all that I know the word and the rev the the revelation of the message reveals more of Jesus Christ but it has to be the person revealed to you personally can't be an intellectual stimulation somehow and that's why he had to take the baptism of the Holy Ghost the seventh angel had to sell it because of the extremes of emotion and the extremes of intellectualism to bring it back and say here's what it is it's not it don't depend on an emotion and don't pinpend on just a few intellectually believe but seek the person of him coming in your life recreating and doing the works in your life as Jesus did Hallelujah I love him this morning God bless you let's stand I know I have to stop or I'll never stop I gotta stop praise the Lord and I hope that somehow by the grace of God that we can learn something from the Bible about what this great Holy Ghost is that you can find your experience in the word of God that you can have something you know that you know that you know and no devil can ever tell you otherwise that you could get up every morning and have coffee not with the devil in your mind but with the word of God in your mind what the word says about you what Christ says about you instead of what the devil's trying to tell you you could say not today not any day I'm not listening to those voices now how many can raise your hand before we sing and pray together how many has felt the holy spirit in the in this service today take it a little bit deeper and say how many would raise your hand and you know I I I can't articulate everything that I want to in my life but I know that God has brought his Mercy to my life in some place in my life I'm making raise your hand to that you see devil see the CW see that take your take your hands off of God's Property Satan take your hands off of God's Property God has done something and I remember the little sister came into my church her and her husband baptized if I said their name you know them they attend another church now but she went to a camp meeting and by the end of the camp meeting she was confused believe it or not I was enjoying the word everything was good but as a young Christian she was confused she says I just don't know after that preaching I don't know if I have any anything I don't know if I have the Holy Ghost and because she came to me I was her pastor I just said I said sister let's look at what God's done in the last I think it was three months in her life your husband was a Baptist you grew up Lutheran I said out of the clear blue God brings the message to you I said three months I said look at your life look at your husband's life transformed by the word Changed by the word and I went through all that God had done just in three months and she began to stop crying and she began to have a subtle look on her face my sister said I'm your pastor I've watched this firsthand do you think that's the Holy Ghost working in your life she said it has to be my husband's changed God has done something in his life I said don't you think that that same Holy Ghost that's made all these changes would not leave you hanging somehow you're missing something the same Holy Ghost that's brought you this far will give you everything if you're lacking something and if you are lacking something the same holy ghost that did that it's going to give you the rest she just settled down said praise God and she she and her husband are going on with the Lord still serving them today still loving this message and loving Christ I say praise the Lord don't let the devil mess with your mind praise the Lord what do we sing Kenny praise the Lord Brother Kenny what do we say I will not come down to the devil's I need to write a song that says not today Satan I will not come down to the devils [Music] no I will not come down to Satan's ground [Music] I'm gonna move right up to Higher Ground I will not come down to the Devils level sing it one more time oh yeah oh I will not calm down to the Devils devil no no no no Hallelujah no I will not come down to Satan's ground oh yes [Music] when the Devil comes around I'm gonna move right up to Higher Ground I will not come down [Music] did you notice today the song that Brother David sang go right with the service I will praise the Lord no matter what tomorrow brings I will praise the Lord to have to tell the devil to leave us alone can you say Amen because we're going to praise the Lord anyhow I asked my daughter to sing that song with me because it has a one line in there in the lyric that says they try is speaking to the Lord he says they try to complicate what you say they try to complicate what you say but Lord your truth is what I follow it'll still be here tomorrow and what I believe is not the works of any man I on the on his glorious Foundation I'll Stand Here I Stand can we just all pray together before we go you hold you speak to the Lord you have your experience and you have your story everybody has a different story but it all ends the same way and that is his Mercy touched your life [Music] his holy spirit touched your life to make a connection with you and you all have a different story but you can raise your hand and say Lord my story is unique but I'm not looking at my past I'm thanking you for your grace and mercy that's brought me to today and whatever has brought me to today Lord I know will bring me through tomorrow and if I'm lacking something I just need to trust you I just need to hold on to you I need to Crave You More Lord and just run after you and anything that I have need of you're not hold back from me as you referred Lord when you were here you referred to will a father if a son would ask something from the father wouldn't the father do everything in his power within his means to get that gift for his son and you said how much more when a child asks for the Holy Ghost will you willingly give it Lord you're not holding these things back from us Lord you're wanting to pour it upon us so Lord we place our experience not in the devil's hands we place it in your hands Lord you started it you'll finish it Lord if there's anything to purge from my life if I'm dabbling in worldly things if I'm doing something to hinder that work of the Holy Ghost forgive me Lord may I walk may you sanctify me Father take those things out of my heart my mind and if I need my desires changed then Lord so be it let it be so let my desires change to the things of God I give this service to you Lord and these people to you that in the coming days there would be such a a solemn stability and anchor rest in their souls the world is confused the world is messed up we don't want our walk with you to be confusing so may we lay hold on the
