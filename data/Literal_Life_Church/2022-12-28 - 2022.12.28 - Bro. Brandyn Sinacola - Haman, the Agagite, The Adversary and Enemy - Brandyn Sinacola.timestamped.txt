[2:57] speaking we're looking forward to that
[2:59] and with that the adult Sunday school
[3:03] class will be canceled normally we have
[3:05] adult and children Sunday school at 10
[3:07] 30. the adult Sunday schools canceled on
[3:10] this Sunday so we'll pick that up the
[3:12] following
[3:14] um tonight if there's any kids here and
[3:16] there are we have some construction
[3:18] going on in the back youth Hall uh
[3:21] normally the kids will go back there and
[3:23] play um there's some playsets and things
[3:25] but because of the construction
[3:26] materials if the kids can stay in the
[3:29] fellowship hall that would be helpful
[3:32] um just to for their own safety and
[3:35] we'll try to get that out of there by
[3:36] Sunday so they can go back in there but
[3:38] we do have some construction going on so
[3:41] if you could work with us on that we'd
[3:43] appreciate it
[3:44] um today we've been trying to get this
[3:46] out to you and then with Sunday being
[3:48] canceled that made it a little difficult
[3:49] but today's the last day to give to
[3:52] count for your 2022 giving receipt if
[3:56] you want that to go on 2022 we need you
[3:58] to give that tonight actually because
[4:01] the deposit goes in the morning the
[4:03] bank's closed on Friday and it goes by
[4:06] that Thursday deposit so
[4:09] if you wish to do that
[4:12] right so Esther chapter 3 and verse 1
[4:17] and sister Jeannie I tried not to make
[4:19] you work tonight
[4:21] so I apologize for getting that in so
[4:23] late
[4:24] after these things did King ahazarus
[4:26] promote Haman the son of hamedatha the
[4:30] agagite and advanced him and set his
[4:32] seat above all the princes that were
[4:34] with him and all the king's servants
[4:36] that were in the king's gate bowed and
[4:38] reverenced Haman for the king had so
[4:41] commanded concerning him
[4:43] but Mordecai bowed not nor did give him
[4:46] reverence if you want to turn over to
[4:49] Hebrews 1
[4:52] Hebrews chapter 1.
[4:54] verse 1.
[5:03] Hebrews 1 verse 1.
[5:10] God who at sundry times and in diverse
[5:12] manners spake in time past unto the
[5:14] fathers by the prophets
[5:16] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[5:19] by a son whom he hath pointed heir of
[5:22] All Things by whom also he made the
[5:24] worlds
[5:25] who being the brightness of his glory
[5:28] and the express image of his person and
[5:30] upholding All Things by the word of his
[5:33] power when he had by himself purged our
[5:35] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[5:39] Majesty on high
[5:40] that right there proves that Jesus
[5:42] Christ is God himself
[5:45] being made so much better than the
[5:47] angels as he hath by inheritance
[5:49] obtained a more excellent Name than they
[5:52] For unto which of the Angels said he at
[5:55] any time Thou Art my son this day have I
[5:58] begotten thee and again has he said unto
[6:01] any of the angels I will be to him a
[6:04] father and he shall be to me a son
[6:06] and again as he said to any of the
[6:08] Angels when he bringeth in the first
[6:10] begotten into the world he saith and let
[6:13] all the angels of God worship Him Jesus
[6:16] Christ
[6:17] and of the angels He said
[6:19] saith who maketh his angels spirits and
[6:23] his ministers a flame of fire
[6:25] but under the sun he saith thy Throne o
[6:28] God is forever and ever a scepter of
[6:31] righteousness is the scepter of thy
[6:33] kingdom
[6:35] and I just noticed that today and
[6:37] studying and it just uh just inspires me
[6:40] just now even
[6:42] we'll bring that out later sometime
[6:43] verse 9 thou has loved righteousness and
[6:46] hated iniquity therefore God even thy
[6:49] God hath anointed thee with the oil of
[6:51] gladness above thy fellows
[6:54] and now Lord in the beginning has laid
[6:56] the foundation of the earth and the
[6:58] heavens are the works of thine hands
[7:01] they Shall Perish but thou remainest and
[7:03] they all shall wax old as doth a garment
[7:06] and as a Vester shalt thou fold them up
[7:09] and they shall be changed but Thou Art
[7:11] the same and thy ears shall not fail
[7:15] but to which of the Angels said he at
[7:17] any time sit on my right hand until I
[7:21] make thine enemies thy footstool
[7:23] are they not all ministering Spirits
[7:26] sent forth to minister for them who
[7:29] shall be The Heirs of salvation
[7:32] you can have your seats and I pray that
[7:34] God would bless his word now as we
[7:37] go forward
[7:39] Hebrews 1 and verse 4 said being made so
[7:42] much more better than the angels as he
[7:45] hath by inheritance obtained a more
[7:46] excellent Name than they sister Genie I
[7:49] can text you this later but my title of
[7:52] the night is Haman the agagite
[7:54] the adversary and enemy Haman the
[7:58] agagite the adversary and enemy
[8:02] what I'd like to do tonight is there's a
[8:06] lot of types I've been bringing out
[8:07] different types and shadows of Nestor
[8:09] and and how it relates to our spiritual
[8:11] walk and I I didn't anticipate to have
[8:14] another uh insert into this but it was
[8:17] just the way things came and studying
[8:19] today
[8:20] so we'll maybe wrap up next time but
[8:24] I just this this uh there's something in
[8:27] here that so inspired me that I want to
[8:29] get to a little bit later
[8:30] but in this and and the reason why I'm
[8:33] bringing about uh Hebrews pulling in
[8:36] Hebrews is because it's talking about
[8:38] the angels and how how Christ was made
[8:41] uh a little bit later in Hebrews chapter
[8:44] 2 it says he was made lower than the
[8:46] angels and yet we find in chapter one
[8:49] the scripture says he's more than the
[8:52] Angels Jesus Christ was given a greater
[8:55] Authority than the angels He was above
[8:57] the angels and the Angels were set below
[9:00] him and and we find and and a lot of
[9:03] types between Satan and himself and and
[9:06] Haman in the Book of Esther
[9:08] and we know as we've gone on with the
[9:10] story of Esther how how that you're
[9:13] familiar with Esther how Haman is the
[9:16] arch nemesis of God's people and Queen
[9:18] Esther how he he uh brings about this
[9:22] plan to destroy God's people and that
[9:25] includes the queen
[9:26] Queen Esther and so we know how the
[9:29] story goes here but we just want to
[9:30] bring out a couple things how
[9:33] um
[9:34] in in our opening scripture it said it
[9:37] said uh an Esther
[9:39] chapter 3
[9:45] how it said um after these things
[9:49] after Queen after Esther became Queen
[9:52] brother Paul asked in the office one day
[9:54] we were just talking about Esther
[9:56] um I forget who's in there with us and
[9:58] he just he just asked the question and I
[10:01] didn't think much about it and until I
[10:03] was studying this and he said I wonder
[10:05] what I wonder when Haman became promoted
[10:08] was it before after or after Esther
[10:10] became queen and I just thought well I
[10:13] wonder where he's going with that you
[10:14] know that's that's a peculiar question a
[10:16] way to think on it and but what I found
[10:19] was is that Esther's granted Queen
[10:22] and then Haman is promoted
[10:25] so after these things after our names
[10:27] were written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[10:30] was was Lucifer promoted
[10:33] after our names were written after
[10:35] Christ died in in his his name was
[10:38] written on the Book of Life over our
[10:40] names and the blood was was going to be
[10:42] shed after that plan was in place then
[10:45] God started creating then God created
[10:48] angels then he created the heavens so
[10:51] our Our Fate of God's people was already
[10:55] sealed up in his book before we even had
[10:57] an enemy amen
[11:00] our names were written before the
[11:02] foundation of the world before Lucifer
[11:04] an angel was promoted
[11:08] and we see that that Haman is promoted
[11:10] and it goes to Great length to say he
[11:13] was promoted above all the princes he
[11:15] was promoted above above all his
[11:17] counterparts and we know that Lucifer
[11:19] Satan was promoted above all the Angels
[11:22] around him he was he was the right hand
[11:24] of God at that time and and and and yet
[11:28] he lusted for more and Haman is the
[11:30] right hand of the king the king we'll
[11:33] get to it here in a little bit gives
[11:35] Haman his seal and he says you're next
[11:37] to me your word is now my word and it
[11:40] cannot be broken and and yet we'll find
[11:43] that wasn't good enough for Haman
[11:45] so we see a lot of these these
[11:48] characteristics and the story The Book
[11:50] of Esther references many times how
[11:52] Haman wants to destroy the people of God
[11:54] it doesn't just say he wants to bind him
[11:56] doesn't want to say he say that he wants
[11:58] to put him in slavery it actually says
[12:01] over and over again when it talks about
[12:02] haman's desire is to destroy to utterly
[12:06] destroy to wipe out to destroy God's
[12:09] people and Satan of course would do that
[12:11] to your life tonight he would try to
[12:13] inflict a cancer on you or he would try
[12:16] to do something there's there's many
[12:18] needs that were brought before us
[12:19] tonight that we want to keep in prayer
[12:21] and and some of them we don't know where
[12:23] they stand with God and if God if if
[12:25] they were to pass on then we would just
[12:27] have to trust that we've we've committed
[12:29] them into God's hands I I had a there
[12:32] was I was at a funeral one time and I
[12:34] was just grieved in my spirit and it was
[12:36] a family member's funeral and I was just
[12:38] thinking but I didn't know where they
[12:39] stood
[12:40] and and it was it was you know a priest
[12:43] of that they had and
[12:44] you know not knowing truth like we know
[12:46] truth and and he made a comment and he
[12:49] said you know many times people on their
[12:51] dying death bed
[12:53] make their heart right with God and
[12:55] we'll never know it because they can't
[12:56] speak
[12:58] and and that that helped settle my
[13:00] spirit in that moment that helped bring
[13:02] me some peace and I just thought well I
[13:04] just I just trust that they did that and
[13:06] so we just have to trust that but Satan
[13:08] would try to get to you before you could
[13:10] have that chance
[13:12] but you remember the thief on the cross
[13:14] as it's been brought out many times he
[13:16] didn't have much of an opportunity until
[13:17] the end but he just said all he said he
[13:20] didn't say forgive me forgive my sins
[13:22] I've I can I be let down and baptize me
[13:26] all he said was remember me when you're
[13:28] in your kingdom and Jesus granted him
[13:30] eternal life
[13:32] so Haman Haman would want to destroy
[13:36] God's people Satan would want to destroy
[13:38] us before we could have that opportunity
[13:40] to give our hearts to God but he doesn't
[13:42] want to just destroy us he would take
[13:45] your life if he could sure that would be
[13:47] good but what he wants to do the most is
[13:50] to destroy your spiritual walk to
[13:52] destroy your relationship with Jesus
[13:54] Christ and he's put everything in our
[13:56] path today to be able to do that he's
[13:59] put he's put he's made the the internet
[14:02] and and and social media is is probably
[14:06] one of the greatest plagues that we have
[14:07] of today
[14:09] we have you know and you think that you
[14:12] know we know that it would be something
[14:14] physical but the Branham said there will
[14:15] be plagues that make cancer look like a
[14:17] toothache but there's plagues today that
[14:21] make cancer look like a toothache but in
[14:24] a spiritual sense they make they make
[14:26] the things that they had to deal with
[14:28] back then look like a toothache compared
[14:30] to what we have available and what Satan
[14:32] has has uh conjured up today to destroy
[14:37] us spiritually to get us sidetracked to
[14:40] get us so distracted that we become into
[14:42] a spiritual death that we we lose our
[14:45] spiritual strength that we lose the
[14:47] faith that we need to to defeat him in
[14:50] this hour the the that we that we lose
[14:52] rapturing Faith Satan is after that he's
[14:55] he wants to destroy us
[14:58] but we see uh now let's just draw some
[15:02] of these things out Esther six
[15:05] and you know what I'll just reference
[15:06] these for time's sake tonight but Esther
[15:08] 6. and and six through nine no let's
[15:11] let's read it let's read it Esther 6 6.
[15:16] all right sister Genie's with me she's
[15:17] doing good
[15:19] so Haman came in so this is this is
[15:22] Haman is is distraught he's I I think
[15:25] he's he's put out a decree that the
[15:28] people should bow before Haman whenever
[15:30] he's around well there's one man that
[15:31] won't bow and his name's Mordecai and
[15:34] it's driving Haman up a wall and so
[15:36] Haman um I forget what happens just
[15:39] before this but they're just they Haman
[15:42] is just beyond mad he's just ticked at
[15:44] this point he he cannot stand Mordecai
[15:47] he can't stand God's people he he wants
[15:50] to be lifted up and and treated like the
[15:52] king Mordecai's not doing it and he's
[15:55] stomping his foot and saying this isn't
[15:57] fair it sounds like a little kid you
[16:00] know and that's just what the devil is
[16:01] he's just a little kid
[16:03] so Haman came in and so he's he's out
[16:06] walking the king can't sleep
[16:09] the king says Hey somebody read read
[16:11] read my words back to me and they come
[16:14] across this instance where Mordecai
[16:16] foiled the plan that was gonna that
[16:18] those two men that were in the king's
[16:20] court were going to destroy the king and
[16:22] so the king says well what what was done
[16:24] to him to reward him well there's
[16:27] nothing written here and so he says well
[16:29] what can we do
[16:31] and then they said well then he says
[16:32] well who's around and they said oh
[16:33] haman's around
[16:35] and this picks it up so Haman came in he
[16:37] says go let him come in so Haman came in
[16:39] and the King said unto him what shall be
[16:42] done unto a man whom the king delighteth
[16:44] to honor now Haman thought in his heart
[16:47] to whom would the king Delight to be to
[16:49] do honor
[16:51] more than to myself
[16:54] who in the world would the king want to
[16:56] honor
[16:57] it has to be me
[16:59] it has to be me
[17:01] what pride and selfishness and Haman
[17:03] answered the king now this is him saying
[17:06] it's got to be me so I'm going to make
[17:07] it good I am going to get what I wanted
[17:10] I I'm watch this
[17:13] let the Royal apparel be brought which
[17:15] the king useth to wear
[17:17] and the horse that the king rideth upon
[17:20] and the Crown Royal which is set upon
[17:23] his head and let this apparel and horse
[17:26] be delivered to the hand of one of the
[17:28] king's most notable princes that they
[17:31] may array the man with all whom the king
[17:33] delighteth to honor and bring him on
[17:35] Horseback through the street
[17:38] of the city and Proclaim before him thus
[17:42] shall it be done to the man whom the
[17:44] king delighteth to honor
[17:47] and he's he's saying make him like the
[17:50] king dress him like the king put him on
[17:53] the horse like the king we know that
[17:55] Satan is is found riding a white horse
[17:58] in Revelations what's he doing he wants
[18:01] to be like the king the king is on a
[18:03] white horse let let me have a white
[18:05] horse and we know that he changes horses
[18:08] as he goes but
[18:10] so he has all of this in his heart and
[18:13] and he's he's saying King promote me
[18:17] so now we want to go over to
[18:23] Isaiah 14.
[18:25] Isaiah 14 and verse 12.
[18:29] now that was what haman's desire was now
[18:31] let's look at what Satan's desire is
[18:34] he says says Isaiah 14 12 how art thou
[18:38] fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the
[18:41] morning he was made the Morning Star he
[18:43] was made the Angel of the Morning how
[18:46] art thou cut down to the ground which
[18:48] did US weaken the Nations
[18:51] for thou has said in thine heart I will
[18:54] Ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[18:56] throne above the stars of God
[18:58] I will say and you know you are the
[19:01] stars of God
[19:02] and we know that over in Revelations
[19:04] there's stars in the in the hand and
[19:06] that's the messengers and here's Satan
[19:07] that's so bold I'm going to make my
[19:10] Throne I'm I'm gonna I will exalt it God
[19:13] so God gives him this position and then
[19:16] he says I'm going to exalt it I'm going
[19:19] to make it more than what the king made
[19:21] it how he ever thought he had the
[19:23] authority to do that I don't know I will
[19:25] say also upon the Mount of the
[19:27] congregation in the sides of the North
[19:33] I will Ascend above the heights of the
[19:35] clouds I will be like the most high
[19:39] let's stop right there
[19:42] Satan's great plan he he lays it out the
[19:46] Bible exposes it now we know what
[19:48] Satan's after now we know what Satan's
[19:51] trying to do now we know that Satan is
[19:54] trying to to rule over us and his only
[19:58] purpose is to destroy us
[20:00] his only purpose is to have dominion
[20:03] over you and and he can only have what
[20:06] God allows so so he'll bring everything
[20:09] about so that us and our free moral
[20:12] agency we make choices we we get
[20:15] presented with choices every day do we
[20:17] choose do we choose the Lord's Side or
[20:20] do we choose the enemy side and I and I
[20:22] regret to say oftentimes I do we all do
[20:25] we make the wrong choice and Satan
[20:28] presents that and he says hi I got him
[20:31] ha you know and and we've heard it
[20:33] before he's the one he'll tempt you and
[20:35] then he'll call the police on you he'll
[20:37] say hey buddy here here's this go look
[20:39] at this and then he'll say ha I got you
[20:41] and then he'll go before God and I'll
[20:43] say hey did you see what he did
[20:45] he didn't say hey did you see what I did
[20:47] he says Hey do you see what he did
[20:49] do you see how he fell to that do you
[20:51] see the decision that he just made
[20:57] so
[20:59] we see the desire to be like the most
[21:01] high
[21:02] now
[21:04] Esther and I'll just reference these
[21:06] back in Esther 3
[21:08] we find that just just typing Satan and
[21:12] and Haman now we find that
[21:15] haman's haman's princes the ones that
[21:18] are under him and just just for typing's
[21:21] sake I'm going to say haman's demons
[21:23] tell them hey we can't affect God's
[21:25] people
[21:26] there's there's there's a man that is
[21:28] not bowing to you and when we talk to
[21:30] him we ask them why won't you bow
[21:32] and he said no I'm not going to do it
[21:34] and they said well please just just bow
[21:36] to him it'll make it easier for all of
[21:37] us and he said but he won't bow we we
[21:40] tried we tried to persuade him we tried
[21:43] to we tried to to let him have it we
[21:45] tried to tell him you have to bow and he
[21:48] still won't do it
[21:49] in the end of verse 5 says Haman was
[21:52] full of Wrath
[21:53] and when you won't bow to Satan's
[21:56] devices he gets angry
[21:58] and he says okay it tells us demons if
[22:01] you can't do it then I'm gonna have to
[22:03] do it and so then he comes down and he
[22:05] Wars against us
[22:08] verse 6 says so when when when haman's
[22:11] Devils couldn't get God's people to fall
[22:14] Haman went himself and where does he go
[22:16] he goes straight to the king
[22:18] the only source he could go to before he
[22:21] could touch the people the king's people
[22:23] the king's subjects before he could do
[22:26] anything more he had to go to the king
[22:27] for permission
[22:29] Haman accuses God's people before the
[22:32] king and it's interesting because you
[22:34] can read in Ezra and different books
[22:36] around Esther and these men are saying
[22:38] you know what king these Jews they're
[22:41] nasty they're nasty people they have
[22:43] their own laws they don't regard the
[22:46] king's laws they're Peaceable they're
[22:48] not causing any trouble
[22:50] but they're not doing they're not going
[22:52] the direction of remember last time we
[22:55] talked about the spirit on that Nation
[22:57] they're not going in that direction
[22:58] they're they're they're they're
[23:00] withstanding the evil Age and and the
[23:04] the demons can't handle that
[23:06] I don't know what to do with them I
[23:08] don't I don't know what to do with
[23:09] Wesley I don't know what to do with
[23:11] Henry and Sharon I don't know what to do
[23:13] with the different ones he names you by
[23:15] name the demons do and Satan says well
[23:17] I'm going to have to go myself
[23:18] if you can't do it I'll go
[23:21] but I'm so glad tonight
[23:24] that when when when the Angels couldn't
[23:27] do it when nobody else would fit the
[23:30] bill Jesus Christ God himself said you
[23:33] know what this isn't a job for you it's
[23:35] a job for me I'm going myself
[23:38] I'm gonna go myself
[23:42] Haman he comes and he asked permission
[23:45] later again he comes and he asks for
[23:47] permission
[23:48] uh to do something to God's chosen now
[23:54] let me just see here because I had this
[23:56] written down wrong
[24:01] so I just want to catch this chapter 3
[24:03] verse 10.
[24:05] and the King took his ring from his hand
[24:07] and gave it unto Haman the son of
[24:09] hemedatha the agagite the Jews enemy
[24:13] and the King said unto Haman the silver
[24:15] is given to thee the people also do with
[24:19] them as it seemeth good to thee
[24:21] so this is Haman he's he's come to the
[24:24] king he's expressed I need your
[24:25] permission there's a people out there
[24:27] they're just nasty they're nasty people
[24:29] and the King says okay here's your
[24:32] permission now go over to Job chapter 1
[24:35] with me
[24:37] Job chapter 1.
[24:40] we'll we can let sister Genie put it up
[24:47] verse 6.
[24:53] now there was a day when the sons of God
[24:55] came to present themselves before the
[24:57] Lord and Satan came also among them
[24:59] and the Lord said unto Satan once cometh
[25:01] thou then Satan answered the Lord and
[25:03] said from going to and fro in the earth
[25:05] and from walking up and down in it
[25:08] and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou
[25:10] considered my servant job
[25:13] that there is none like him in the earth
[25:15] a perfect and an upright man one that
[25:18] feareth God and His Jewish evil
[25:20] then Satan answered the Lord and said
[25:22] the job fear God for not
[25:25] Hast not Thou made and hedge about him
[25:27] and about his house and about all that
[25:30] he hath on every side thou has blessed
[25:32] the work of his hands and his substance
[25:34] is increased in the land now in each
[25:37] throughout the history of the Bible
[25:40] each of the kings that were set over the
[25:43] Israelites when they had went into
[25:45] bondage
[25:46] I think except for well even with the
[25:48] Babylonians at some point the the
[25:51] children of God found favor with that
[25:54] King but there was always somebody that
[25:57] was that was trying to try to put blame
[25:59] and fall on them always somebody coming
[26:01] before the king and accusing him but
[26:04] they were always they always were given
[26:06] favor with those kings
[26:08] verse 11. but put forth uh but put forth
[26:12] thine hand now and touch all that he
[26:14] hath and he will curse thee to thy face
[26:16] and the Lord said unto Satan behold all
[26:20] that he hath is in thy power only upon
[26:23] himself put not forth on hand so Satan
[26:26] went forth from the presence of the Lord
[26:28] pull up job 2 chapter 2 verse 1.
[26:35] again there was a day when the sons of
[26:37] God came to present themselves before
[26:39] the Lord and Satan came also among them
[26:42] to present himself before the Lord
[26:45] and the Lord said unto Satan from whence
[26:48] cometh thou and Satan answered the Lord
[26:50] and said from going to and fro in the
[26:52] earth and from walking up and down in it
[26:54] nasty fella
[26:56] and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou
[26:58] considered my servant job that there is
[27:00] none like him in the earth a perfect and
[27:03] an upright man one that feareth God and
[27:05] His Jewish evil and still he holdeth
[27:08] fast his Integrity now watch this now
[27:10] God's going to brag on him say you tried
[27:13] you you consider them I'm just asking
[27:16] kind of it's almost like a mockery you
[27:18] know hey satan
[27:19] we've had this conversation before but
[27:22] have you considered my servant job have
[27:24] you heard about job
[27:25] he says and still oh yeah yeah that's
[27:28] right you did you did consider him still
[27:31] he holds fast his Integrity although
[27:34] thou movest me against him to destroy
[27:37] him without cause
[27:39] and Satan answered the Lord and said
[27:41] skin for skin yea all that a man hath
[27:44] will he give us for his life but put
[27:46] forth on hand now and touch his bone in
[27:49] his flesh and he will curse thee to thy
[27:51] face
[27:52] and the Lord said unto Satan behold he
[27:54] is in thine hand but save his life
[27:57] so when so went Satan forth from the
[27:59] presence of the Lord and smote job with
[28:01] sore boils from the soul of his foot
[28:03] unto his crown
[28:06] this is this is that that coming before
[28:09] the presence and we've heard these
[28:10] things before but I bring it to your
[28:12] remembrance again and and type it in
[28:14] with Haman he had to go before the king
[28:17] Satan has to go before the king before
[28:20] you can have a trial
[28:21] Satan has to go before the king before
[28:24] you can get sick Satan has to go before
[28:27] the king before somebody in your life
[28:29] could pass away
[28:30] Satan has to go before the king before
[28:33] he can do anything to you
[28:35] so we draw these similarities between
[28:37] Haman Queen Esther and the Jews
[28:40] adversary and Satan the bride Through
[28:42] the Ages adversary
[28:44] it's always been he's always been the
[28:46] adversary you do you don't have a new
[28:49] adversary this is the same adversary
[28:52] that the people of God have been
[28:53] fighting throughout all the ages Even in
[28:56] our story of Esther this was Satan
[28:58] behind this he was driving these Spirits
[29:01] behind remember we brought out in Daniel
[29:04] the Prince of Persia it was it was the
[29:07] spirit that was on that nation that was
[29:09] warring against the Saints and and but
[29:12] there's a spiritual battle as we brought
[29:14] out the last time there's a spiritual
[29:16] battle and and in that spiritual battle
[29:19] there's there's angels that either
[29:21] they're battling and they're warring
[29:23] against but they the Angels of Darkness
[29:25] will not overcome the angels of light
[29:27] because you remember there was a there
[29:30] uh
[29:32] I believe it was Michael gets called in
[29:35] who is who is Christ he gets called in
[29:37] and he starts he starts warring with the
[29:40] Prince of Persia so that this Angel this
[29:42] messenger could get to Daniel and he
[29:44] tells Daniel I heard your prayer from
[29:46] day one
[29:47] I heard your prayer from day one so that
[29:49] from day one when you when your request
[29:51] even becomes on your mind because your
[29:55] your thoughts speak louder in heaven
[29:57] than even your words but then when you
[30:00] speak it in prayer from that time on God
[30:03] is on the case
[30:05] God is on the case the angels are
[30:07] working for you they're working to get
[30:09] to you they're working to bring you your
[30:11] deliverance they're working to bring you
[30:13] your healing
[30:14] but it's this adversary that that we're
[30:17] up against now I want to follow because
[30:20] it the scripture is is
[30:23] is
[30:24] um so specific to say Haman the agagite
[30:28] and so I just I got curious one day and
[30:31] I said okay so what's the big deal about
[30:33] an agagite and and you know we've said
[30:35] it before and I learned it and and uh it
[30:38] was the The Sight and Sound story of
[30:40] Esther's kind of started me down this
[30:41] path
[30:42] um really good great job but in that
[30:44] they give some history and they said
[30:46] they at the the Aggregate and and they
[30:49] start giving the history of how Haman is
[30:51] in agagite which comes from um amalek
[30:55] and they and that's the king that Saul
[30:58] was supposed to destroy
[31:00] and he didn't and he he spared his life
[31:03] and so amalek's lineage continues on and
[31:08] here it is rising up again against
[31:10] Israel
[31:11] and now I just want to bring this back
[31:13] so so the agaric lineage we find in
[31:16] Genesis comes from Esau Esau has a son
[31:20] and his name is emelek then over in
[31:23] Exodus 17 verse 8 to 14.
[31:27] um
[31:28] we're doing good on time so let's let's
[31:30] go there
[31:32] Exodus 17.
[31:40] in verse 8. so Israel's come out of
[31:42] Egypt they've come out of bondage
[31:44] they've come out of the world
[31:47] and then their battles don't stop there
[31:51] then came amalek and fought with Israel
[31:54] and refitim and Moses said unto Joshua
[31:57] choose us out men and go out fight with
[32:01] amalek tomorrow I will stand at the top
[32:03] of the hill with a rod of God in my hand
[32:06] so Joshua did as Moses had said to him
[32:09] and fought with emelek and Moses Aaron
[32:12] and her went up to the top of the hill
[32:16] and it came to pass when Moses held up
[32:19] his hands that Israel prevailed and when
[32:21] he let down his hands emalek prevailed
[32:23] but Moses's hands were heavy and they
[32:27] went and they took a stone and put it
[32:29] under him and he sat there on and Aaron
[32:31] and Hurst stayed up his hands the one on
[32:33] the one side and the other on the other
[32:35] side and his hands were steady until the
[32:37] going down of the Sun and Joshua
[32:40] discomforted emelek and his people with
[32:42] the edge of the sword Moses's hands are
[32:45] outstretched and as long as they're
[32:47] outstretched Jesus's hands were
[32:50] outstretched and nailed to the cross so
[32:51] they stayed that way
[32:53] so we have our victory
[32:55] as long as they were outstretched and
[32:57] Joshua discomforted emelek and his
[32:59] people with the edge of The Sword and
[33:01] the Lord said unto Moses write this for
[33:03] a memorial in a book and rehearse it in
[33:06] the ears of Joshua I want to stop right
[33:07] there because I want to come back to
[33:08] this
[33:10] so you see how amalek I mean they're
[33:12] just they're right out of the way out of
[33:13] Egypt they come across the Red Sea
[33:16] they're they're on their way to the
[33:17] promised land and here comes this nasty
[33:19] fella and he's gonna he's gonna he's
[33:22] gonna try to tear him up he's gonna try
[33:24] to destroy him now Schofield makes a
[33:27] note on amalek and I just thought this
[33:29] was good so bear with me while I read
[33:30] this
[33:32] amalek was born after the Flesh and
[33:34] progenerator of the amalekites Israel's
[33:37] persistent enemy is a type of the Flesh
[33:40] and the believer
[33:42] so watch this now watch this type
[33:44] scriptures specific to say Haman the
[33:48] agagite when you go all this back again
[33:51] amalek is a type of the Flesh and the
[33:54] believer he that was born after the
[33:57] flesh persecuted him that was born after
[33:59] the spirit even so it is now
[34:01] but the conflict with amalek in chapter
[34:04] 17 sets forth the resources of the man
[34:07] under law rather than those of the
[34:10] believer under grace if you go read
[34:12] Romans 7 you'll find you'll find this
[34:15] starting to be discussed and Paul does a
[34:18] beautiful job at explaining this
[34:21] sets forth the resources of the man
[34:23] under the law rather than those uh of
[34:25] the believer under grace Paul says over
[34:28] there in Romans 7 he says he says I
[34:32] didn't know sin except for it was by the
[34:35] law
[34:36] so the law came and then and then it was
[34:39] like sin came with it and he said it's
[34:42] not that the law is bad he said I
[34:44] wouldn't have known that I was sinning
[34:45] except for it was by the law but then
[34:48] man can become so Bound by the law that
[34:51] that he he operates under law
[34:55] and and does away with Grace
[35:00] the man under law could fight and pray
[35:03] he could fight in Joshua he could he
[35:05] could pray
[35:07] under grace the Holy Spirit gains the
[35:10] victory over the Flesh in the believer's
[35:12] half amen
[35:14] now Romans 8 uh sister Genie if you
[35:17] could pull that up Romans 8 verse 2. I
[35:19] told you I had a lot of scriptures
[35:21] tonight but I hope I'm not losing you
[35:23] Romans 8 and verse 2 and we're just
[35:25] going to go to four so don't let me go
[35:26] past it for the law of the spirit of
[35:28] life in Christ Jesus hath made me free
[35:31] from the law of sin and death
[35:34] for what the law could not do in that it
[35:37] was weak through the flesh it didn't
[35:40] give you any overcoming power it just
[35:42] told you you were wrong
[35:44] God sending his own son in the likeness
[35:47] of sinful flesh and for sin condemns him
[35:50] in the flesh amen that the righteousness
[35:53] of the law might be fulfilled in us
[35:55] there's a righteousness in the law but
[35:57] it couldn't be done it couldn't be
[35:59] fulfilled in us without Christ who
[36:02] walked not after the flesh but after the
[36:04] spirit now Sister Genie Galatians 5
[36:08] 16-17 and then in Romans
[36:12] uh back in in chapter seven you find
[36:15] Paul is that's where Paul's saying I I
[36:18] constantly I want to do good but every
[36:21] time I try to do good Evil's with me and
[36:24] and that which I don't want to do that I
[36:26] find myself doing but I think it's so
[36:29] beautiful this week as I went there and
[36:32] and I found that Paul actually says
[36:34] never it's it's it's no longer I because
[36:38] of this sin and because of the law
[36:40] because of this law of sin and death
[36:42] that's working in my flesh he says it's
[36:45] no longer me when my desire is to do
[36:48] good and evil is present with me it's
[36:50] not I in the eyes of God that's doing
[36:53] the sin it's sin itself that's doing the
[36:55] sin so he says in God's eyes I'm no
[36:58] longer to blame when I sin it's not me
[37:01] doing it it's the sinful flesh that's
[37:03] doing it so so maybe I'm not saying that
[37:07] just right because I got more excited
[37:08] than what you're giving me right now
[37:10] he's saying in God's eyes when you do
[37:13] wrong it's not you doing the wrong
[37:16] it's not you anymore it's it's sin
[37:18] that's doing it it's sin gets the blame
[37:20] it's Satan that gets the blame because
[37:23] Satan introduced sin into into in the
[37:26] garden amen and so it's no longer you
[37:29] when you sin when you do wrong we beat
[37:31] ourselves up Satan calls the cause the
[37:34] police on us he goes before God and he's
[37:36] he's giving he's giving his his input to
[37:39] God his accusation against us he says
[37:41] hey you know look what he just did but
[37:43] God says no no he just repented that's
[37:46] not him that's sin doing that and sin
[37:49] will always be with us in this flesh sin
[37:52] it's just it's the of her nature
[37:54] and there's and and even though there's
[37:56] a wheat gets put in that it's still
[37:59] Cockapoo on the outside and it's sticky
[38:01] and I hate it
[38:04] Galatians 5 16 and verse 17. this I say
[38:08] then
[38:10] walk in the spirit and ye shall not
[38:12] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[38:15] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[38:17] fulfill the lust of the flesh for the
[38:18] flesh lusteth against the spirit and the
[38:22] spirit against the flesh
[38:23] and these are contrary the one to the
[38:26] other so you cannot do the things that
[38:28] you would
[38:30] so your desire is there your hunger is
[38:34] there your thirst is there God I don't I
[38:36] don't want to do this thing anymore I
[38:38] don't want to be bad I don't want to do
[38:40] evil
[38:41] and yet there's something in you that's
[38:43] always that's always drawing you to it
[38:46] and it's the flesh it's not you it's the
[38:48] flesh
[38:49] it's Satan always there to tempt you to
[38:51] always bring this thing to always work
[38:53] on the flesh because the flesh is not
[38:55] converted it's the sinful nature of the
[38:58] flesh is not converted it's not
[39:00] controlled by the spirit except you give
[39:03] submission to the spirit and your your
[39:05] flesh comes under subjection and that's
[39:08] through the power of the Holy Ghost so
[39:10] you can have dominion over your flesh
[39:12] but it's what do you submit to and if
[39:15] you're walking after the flesh it the
[39:18] flesh lusts against the spirit
[39:20] so we have to be in the word we have to
[39:23] you you have to come to church
[39:26] listen this isn't you don't have to come
[39:28] to church for attendance so so you can
[39:31] mark down in a book you don't have to
[39:33] come to church to pay your tithes we
[39:35] don't need your ties we you should pay
[39:37] them but we don't need them what we need
[39:40] for you to do is to come to church so
[39:42] you can be spiritually refreshed so you
[39:44] can continually walk after the spirit
[39:46] and have dominion over the flesh because
[39:49] the spirit and the flesh are constantly
[39:52] in war against each other
[39:57] foreign
[40:00] field ends he says but this Victory is
[40:03] only as the believer walks in the spirit
[40:07] acting in independency or or and I'm
[40:10] sorry I don't know that I can pronounce
[40:12] that right now Independence or
[40:14] Disobedience amalek the flesh gains an
[40:17] in an easy Victory so when we act in
[40:21] Independence or in Disobedience against
[40:23] the spirit
[40:24] amalek the flesh gains an easy victory
[40:28] now watch this I'm just going to make
[40:30] reference to this and this this is just
[40:31] some things that have opened up and I
[40:33] don't know how to fit them in or when
[40:34] but
[40:37] numbers and I'm not claiming to have any
[40:39] great Revelation okay it just opened up
[40:41] to me it's things we know we're blessed
[40:43] people but it's it's what's opened up to
[40:45] me numbers 14.
[40:48] um
[40:49] 42 to 45 is is 14 is kadish barnia
[40:55] and the the children of the Lord reject
[40:59] the word of God
[41:00] and they and they and they they look at
[41:02] their own self they look at their
[41:04] they're comparing their flesh they're
[41:06] looking at the Flesh and they say we
[41:08] can't do it they're they're this the
[41:10] spiritual enemy is greater than we are
[41:12] we can't win
[41:14] and but God said that's your land go
[41:17] take it before you take it I'll tell you
[41:20] what go get some fruit from the land
[41:22] it'll encourage your faith but when they
[41:24] come back they say oh we can't do it
[41:26] they're looking at their flesh oh I
[41:28] can't do it I can't live a Christian
[41:30] walk I can't I can't make it Satan's
[41:33] always beating up on me I'm always
[41:35] defeated I always walk into feet I'm
[41:37] always falling to sin I'm always falling
[41:39] to the same thing in my life and I just
[41:41] want to make new mistakes and and it's
[41:44] just just something new sometime would
[41:46] be great because this thing just seems I
[41:48] keep falling my flesh is too weak I
[41:51] can't make it Lord why did you choose me
[41:53] in the first place
[41:56] kadish barnia they wake up the next
[41:59] morning after after they've rejected the
[42:02] word of God after after God's judgment
[42:04] has come forward and they say hey Moses
[42:08] we're going to go defeat the amalekites
[42:11] they're just they're just up on the
[42:13] mountain
[42:13] we're gonna go fight them we're going to
[42:15] avenge our sin you'll see we'll we'll
[42:18] show them we'll we'll gain our Victory
[42:20] back we'll earn our way into the
[42:22] Promised Land
[42:24] that's all coming fresh by the way I
[42:26] didn't expect to say any of that
[42:30] Moses tells them
[42:33] if you go up you're going to be a
[42:35] defeated people
[42:36] God is telling you not to go
[42:39] you would think that they would learn
[42:40] okay we just rejected the word of God we
[42:44] just had judgment passed upon us
[42:47] let's let's follow the word of the Lord
[42:49] Moses says don't go God's not with you
[42:52] you will fall if you go up and they say
[42:56] we got to earn our way Moses we're going
[42:58] up they go up they fall
[43:02] because they reject God's word again
[43:05] they go up and they lose
[43:08] and this this brings up the point when
[43:10] we lay down the word to fulfill our
[43:13] fleshly desires
[43:15] because
[43:16] now this is a quote now
[43:18] you you have to lay down the word before
[43:21] you can sin
[43:23] you have to lay down God's word before
[43:26] you can sin and James said what's
[43:28] drawing you to that is is the lust of
[43:31] the flesh
[43:35] and will lose every time
[43:37] when you lay down the word you'll lose
[43:39] every time
[43:41] when you lay down the word you
[43:43] automatically choose to go Satan's way
[43:45] and you'll you'll come away feeling
[43:48] defeated
[43:49] you'll come away with your spiritual
[43:51] Faith hindered
[43:55] but I just want to read a couple more
[43:57] scriptures sister Jeannie are you still
[43:58] with me okay she's doing great let's
[44:01] give her a hand
[44:03] [Applause]
[44:05] Deuteronomy 33 28 sister Genie
[44:09] this is the word of the Lord that's over
[44:11] you
[44:12] if I wrote These down right
[44:14] Israel then shall dwell in safety alone
[44:17] the Fountain of Jacob shall be upon a
[44:20] land of corn and wine also his Heaven
[44:23] shall drop down do so this is if I'm
[44:26] remembering right in these scriptures
[44:28] sorry sister Genie I'm going to have to
[44:30] turn there because I think there's some
[44:32] good stuff here
[44:34] I believe that this is when Moses is
[44:37] going off the scene and he starts
[44:39] blessing Israel
[44:47] chapter 33 and verse 1 and this is the
[44:50] blessing where with Moses the man of God
[44:52] bless the children of Israel before his
[44:54] death and he said the Lord came from
[44:57] Sinai and Rose up from Seer unto them he
[45:00] shined forth from Mount Paran and he
[45:02] came with ten thousands of his Saints
[45:04] from his right hand when a fiery law for
[45:08] them yea he loved the people all his
[45:11] Saints are in thy hand and they sat down
[45:15] at thy feet everyone shall receive thy
[45:18] words that's the word of the Lord over
[45:21] you that's the end that's that's your
[45:24] end that's the end of this journey for
[45:26] you 33-28
[45:29] and this is this is you know we've
[45:31] they've come through fighting amalek
[45:34] they've they've come through these
[45:35] things Israel then shall dwell in the
[45:37] safety alone the Fountain of Jacob shall
[45:40] be upon a land of corn and wine also his
[45:43] Heaven shall drop down do Isaiah 40
[45:46] verse 26 and 31.
[45:49] Isaiah 40 verse 26 and 31.
[46:00] Lord
[46:01] let me make sure I got that right I
[46:04] don't think I do oh I'm not in the right
[46:05] spot in my Bible that's why
[46:08] sorry sister Jeannie I just got to see
[46:10] it to make sure I won't catch everything
[46:12] I want
[46:13] that's verse 25.
[46:16] to whom then will ye liken me or shall I
[46:19] be equal saith the Holy One 26 lift up
[46:23] your eyes on hit on high and behold who
[46:26] hath created these things that bringeth
[46:28] out their host by number he calleth them
[46:31] all by name by the greatness of his
[46:33] might for that he is strong in power not
[46:36] one faileth
[46:38] why sayeth thou o Jacob and speak as
[46:41] though Israel my way is hid from the
[46:43] Lord and my judgment is passed from my
[46:45] God
[46:46] hast thou not known hast thou not heard
[46:50] that the Everlasting God the Lord the
[46:52] creator of the ends of the Earth faneth
[46:54] not neither is weary there is no
[46:57] searching of his understanding he giveth
[47:00] power to the faint
[47:02] and to them that have no might he
[47:05] increases strength
[47:06] even the youth shall faint and be weary
[47:09] and the young men shall utterly fall but
[47:12] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[47:15] their strength they shall Mount up with
[47:17] wings as eagles they shall run and not
[47:19] be weary they shall walk and not faint
[47:24] the going back to Hebrews if you
[47:27] continue on in Hebrews remember I said
[47:29] he was given charge over the Angels he
[47:32] was he was he was although he came and
[47:35] he was below the angels yet he was above
[47:38] them in power because it was God in
[47:40] flesh Jesus Christ and and Paul goes on
[47:43] to write that you are heirs to that you
[47:46] are heirs and and there's different
[47:48] scriptures in Ephesians and I think over
[47:50] in Galatians it says everything was
[47:52] placed underneath his feet so even
[47:54] though he was lower than the Angels even
[47:57] though Technically when he came in flesh
[47:59] he was lower than Lucifer because he
[48:01] because Lucifer was an angel yet it was
[48:04] God and flesh and when he died and his
[48:07] hands were were stuck to that cross out
[48:09] stressed they were they were nailed so
[48:12] they stayed up it gave you and I the
[48:14] victory over the Angels it says that all
[48:16] things are put under his feet and then
[48:19] in in another spot if it don't say it
[48:21] outright I think it does but if it
[48:23] doesn't you can get gather from it if
[48:25] you're heirs to that that everything is
[48:27] under the feet of Jesus Christ and your
[48:29] heirs to it then everything is under
[48:31] your feet including the angels
[48:35] amen so this is the word of the Lord
[48:37] over you
[48:39] this is the word of the Lord now if I
[48:42] can catch these and and we're doing good
[48:45] on time are you still with me
[48:47] amen sister Genie um numbers 24 verse 4.
[48:55] and I I hope I got in here what I wanted
[48:59] verse 4 we're going to verse 9. he has
[49:01] said which heard the words of God which
[49:04] saw the vision of the almighty falling
[49:06] into a trance so this is this is um
[49:08] Balaam but having his eyes open how
[49:12] goodly are thy tents oh Jacob and thy
[49:15] Tabernacles o Israel I want you to
[49:17] remember amalek represents the flesh
[49:20] as the valleys are they spread forth as
[49:23] Gardens by the Riverside as the Trees of
[49:25] Lane lean aloes which the Lord hath
[49:28] planted and as cedar trees beside the
[49:30] waters
[49:31] he shall pour the water out of his
[49:34] bucket and his seed shall be in many
[49:35] Waters and his King shall be higher than
[49:38] egg egg is the king of uh the amalekites
[49:42] and his kingdom shall be exalted God
[49:45] brought for him forth out of Egypt he
[49:48] hath as it were the strength of a
[49:50] unicorn he shall eat up the Nations his
[49:52] enemies he shall break their bones and
[49:54] Pierce them through with his arrows
[49:56] verse 9 he he couched he laid down as a
[50:00] lion and is a great lion who shall stir
[50:02] him up blessed is he that blesseth thee
[50:05] and curseth he that curseth thee let's
[50:07] go to Exodus back to Exodus 17 verse 15
[50:11] and 16.
[50:15] oh she's fast
[50:18] and Moses built an altar and called the
[50:21] name of it uh
[50:23] Jehovah sorry Jehovah Nissi
[50:27] for he said because the Lord hath sworn
[50:30] that the Lord will have war with amalek
[50:33] from generation to generation
[50:36] and I think that's it
[50:38] so the Lord's going to have war with
[50:40] amalek let's catch one more Deuteronomy
[50:43] 15 17-19
[50:49] Deuteronomy 15
[50:51] then Thou shalt taken all and thrust it
[50:54] uh let's see I think I got that wrong
[50:56] Deuteronomy 25 17-19 sorry
[51:03] remember what amalek did unto thee by
[51:05] the way when you were come forth out of
[51:07] Egypt
[51:08] how he met thee by the way and smote
[51:10] behind most of the even all that were
[51:13] feeble behind thee when now has was
[51:16] faint and weary and he feared not God
[51:20] therefore it shall be when the Lord thy
[51:22] God hath given thee rest from all thine
[51:25] enemies round about this is what I
[51:26] wanted
[51:27] Malex the Flesh and it and he said that
[51:30] it'll constantly be warring with you but
[51:33] here it is therefore it shall be when
[51:35] the Lord thy God hath given thee rest
[51:36] from all thine enemies round about in
[51:39] the land which the Lord thy God giveth
[51:41] thee for an inheritance to possess it
[51:44] that's what Jesus Christ purchased that
[51:46] thou shalt blot out the remembrance of
[51:48] amalek from under Heaven Thou shalt not
[51:52] forget it
[51:53] amalek your flesh one day the
[51:56] remembrance of it is going to be blotted
[51:58] out
[51:59] we war against amalek we war against the
[52:02] flesh every day we we hate it we strive
[52:05] we we want to do right we can't seem to
[52:07] do right and yet one day the remembrance
[52:10] of your flesh is going to be blotted out
[52:13] from under heaven
[52:14] amen amen
[52:18] you can stand to your feet and I'm just
[52:20] I'm just gonna bring this down to a
[52:22] close
[52:30] Esther 6 verse 13 and 14.
[52:34] Haman is is distraught and he's Furious
[52:37] Haman told zaresh's wife and all his
[52:40] friends everything that had befallen him
[52:42] then said his wise men and dressed his
[52:44] wife unto him if Mordecai be of the seed
[52:47] of the Jews if if this people sitting
[52:50] here tonight and who listen to this
[52:52] later if they be the seed of of of Jesus
[52:55] Christ
[52:56] before whom thou Hast begun to fall Thou
[53:00] shalt not Prevail against him
[53:02] but shalt surely fall before him
[53:05] and while they were yet talking with him
[53:07] King the King's chamberlains and hasted
[53:09] to bring Haman under the banquet that
[53:11] Esther had prepared so even here
[53:14] Haman type of Satan he's done all this
[53:18] he's getting furious with this people
[53:20] he's getting furious with the people of
[53:22] God we we get furious with the flesh we
[53:25] get furious fighting the enemy and yet
[53:28] his own people haman's own people said
[53:31] you you're trying to make them fall but
[53:33] you're actually going to be the one that
[53:35] falls that's that's the end of Satan
[53:39] every attempt to destroy and accuse
[53:41] God's people to the king that Haman
[53:43] tried backfired on him and the King's
[53:45] Queen and God's people were exalted
[53:52] when it came down to the end the enemy's
[53:54] life was held in the Queen's hand
[53:56] and everything the enemy tried to do to
[53:58] God's people was actually done to him
[54:00] instead you remember he built the
[54:02] Gallows and he said make them as high as
[54:04] you can and then he was the one that was
[54:06] hung on them we know that over in
[54:08] Revelations and in other places in the
[54:10] Bible we find the end we find our
[54:12] adversary we've read about our adversary
[54:14] but yet over in Revelations he's cast
[54:16] into the pit and and he won't bother us
[54:19] anymore
[54:20] oh the day amen over the day let me read
[54:23] you a couple quotes real quick musicians
[54:25] can come
[54:29] if the church has been judged and they
[54:32] have judged themselves and have accepted
[54:34] the blood how can God judge a man that's
[54:37] perfectly totally sinless
[54:40] you say there's no such a person every
[54:43] born-again believer True Believer is
[54:46] perfectly absolutely sinless before God
[54:49] he is not trusting in his own works in
[54:52] the blood of Jesus that his confession
[54:54] has dropped into the Bible says so see
[54:57] he that is born of God does not commit
[55:00] sin for he cannot sin remember when
[55:03] you're when you're under the blood when
[55:04] you when you're filled with the Holy
[55:05] Ghost it's no longer you it's sin that
[55:07] does it it's sin that gets the blame
[55:09] that's why it says in in the next right
[55:12] right in uh the next verse start of of
[55:15] Romans chapter 8 it says now that there
[55:18] is therefore
[55:19] therefore brother Paul has always told
[55:22] us go see what the therefore is there
[55:23] for it's everything in chapter 7 that
[55:26] we've been discussing is is the Flesh
[55:28] and warring and different things he says
[55:29] there is therefore now no condemnation
[55:31] to those that are in Christ Jesus
[55:35] how can you make a man a sinner when the
[55:37] bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is
[55:39] between him and God that would scatter
[55:42] sin till there wouldn't be anything left
[55:44] of it see how can that pure blood of
[55:47] Christ ever let a sin pass there he
[55:50] cannot he cannot that's the word of the
[55:53] Lord over you you are the pure virtuous
[55:56] sinless Bride of the son of the Living
[55:58] God every man and woman that's born of
[56:01] the spirit of God and washed in the
[56:02] blood of Jesus Christ and believes every
[56:05] word of God stands as though you have
[56:07] sent you you never sinned at the first
[56:09] place you are perfect the blood of Jesus
[56:12] Christ how can you if a man if I was
[56:15] supposed to die in the morning a man
[56:17] took my place I cannot die for that sin
[56:19] somebody took my place and Jesus the
[56:22] word took my place he became me that a
[56:25] sinner that I might become him the word
[56:27] amen let me hold true to it not the
[56:30] church the word amen oh that spiritual
[56:33] union of Christ and his church now when
[56:36] the flesh is becoming word and the word
[56:38] is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated
[56:40] just what the Bible said would happen in
[56:43] this day it's happening day by day
[56:47] amen
[56:48] brother Michael you can play something
[56:50] soft let me just make sure
[56:52] I I might want to stop there but I do
[56:54] have one more possibly
[56:57] [Music]
[57:01] yes yes yes
[57:04] sorry I'm excited
[57:06] seven golden candlesticks in Exodus 25
[57:09] 31 it says and thou shalt make a
[57:12] Candlestick of pure gold of beaten work
[57:14] shall the Candlestick be made his shaft
[57:17] and his branches his bowls his knobs and
[57:20] his flowers shall be of the same the
[57:22] True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is
[57:26] likened to pure gold her righteousness
[57:30] is his righteousness
[57:32] her attributes
[57:36] are his own glorious attributes foreign
[57:40] Ty is found in him
[57:42] [Music]
[57:47] I don't deserve this
[57:52] what he is she is to reflect
[57:56] what he has she is to manifest
[57:59] there is no fault in her
[58:02] she is all glorious within and without
[58:05] from beginning to ending she is the work
[58:08] of her Lord
[58:09] and all his works are perfect
[58:12] in fact in her is summed up and
[58:15] manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[58:17] purpose of God
[58:19] how can one fathom it how can one
[58:22] understand it though we cannot do that
[58:25] we can accept it by faith
[58:28] for God hath spoken it
[58:31] and when I was listening to a message
[58:34] and maybe we'll bring out more some time
[58:36] but
[58:37] those last words just ring
[58:40] though we cannot do that we can accept
[58:42] it by faith for God has spoken it
[58:45] [Music]
[58:47] we've been given another chance at
[58:49] kadish barnia
[58:52] we've been given another chance the word
[58:54] of the Lord has been spoken over you
[58:57] the word of the lord it's not it's not a
[58:59] physical land now it's a spiritual land
[59:02] this is the word of the Lord
[59:05] that's been spoken over us in this
[59:07] generation it's been breathed over us
[59:11] let's not fail to believe it
[59:13] let's not fail to take him at his word
[59:15] and I believe he has Grace
[59:17] I believe more and more as time goes by
[59:20] that this is all Grace
[59:23] I believe it more and more
[59:26] and it's things like this that just make
[59:28] me want to stop and praise him for a
[59:30] little while
[59:31] cry for a little while because I I'm I'm
[59:34] not there I don't deserve it
[59:37] I I make choices every day the wrong
[59:40] choices and I wish I could take them
[59:42] back and I can't
[59:45] but it's his grace and this is this is
[59:48] it doesn't make sense
[59:51] it don't seem fair
[59:53] but he knew it wasn't fair
[59:55] [Music]
[59:57] and this is the word of the Lord over
[59:59] you
