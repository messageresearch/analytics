#NOW3 #christianmusic 
In 2021, we gathered for another Night of Worship (NOW Vol 3.) This live recording is the third in a series done at Literal Life Church. All we can say is “what an incredible evening!” As they say, there's nothing like being there, but we trust the special anointing on each song will come through as you listen.

Worship with us! He’s Worthy!
