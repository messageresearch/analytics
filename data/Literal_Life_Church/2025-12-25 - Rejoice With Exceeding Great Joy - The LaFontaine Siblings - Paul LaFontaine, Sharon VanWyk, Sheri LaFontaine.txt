Back to Bethlehem – Christmas at Literal Life Church

“Rejoice With Exceeding Great Joy” reflects the moment Scripture records when the wise men finally saw the star—confirmation that their long journey of faith had not been in vain.

This song speaks of hearts drawn by revelation. The wise men did not follow tradition or convenience, but light. And when that light appeared, it brought great and exceeding joy—not because of the star itself, but because it led them to the King.

Performed live 2023 during our Christmas Worship service at Literal Life Church, this song reminds us that true joy is born when Christ is revealed. Every sincere seeker who follows the light of God’s Word will be led to Him.

Lyrics
(Written by Lanny Wolfe)

O’er mountains and valleys
It led them each night
A star of most radiant light
The wise men rejoiced
As they journeyed afar
To behold such a beautiful star

When they saw the star
They rejoiced with great joy
They rejoiced with
Exceeding great joy

Others saw the star
But they followed it not
To them it would come
And then pass

The wise men kept trusting
With all of their hearts
That the star would find
The Baby at last

When they saw the star
They rejoiced with great joy
They rejoiced with
Exceeding great joy

Great joy
They rejoiced with
Exceeding great joy

[music] Yes, others saw the star, but they [music and singing] followed it not. To them it would come and would pass. [music and singing] But wise men kept trusting with all [singing] of their heart that the star would find the baby at [music and singing] last. And when they saw the star, they rejoice with great joy. When they saw the star, they [music and singing] rejoice. When they saw the star, they [music] rejoice with great joy. They rejoice [singing] with exceeding great joy. [music] [singing] Oh, so long [music] I had traveled [singing] in darkness of night with [music] no one to show me [singing] the way. But one day the Lord let his [music] light shine on me. And now I'm walking in his [singing] love every day.
