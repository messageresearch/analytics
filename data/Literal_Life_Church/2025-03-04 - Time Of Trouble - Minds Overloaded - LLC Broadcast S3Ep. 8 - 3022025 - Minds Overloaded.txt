heed to yourselves as he's mentioned the earthquakes and and diverse places and all the signs of the end time now he says to give attention to yourselves lest at any time your heart be overcharged with surfing and drunkenness and cares of this life so that that day come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell in the face of the whole earth watch ye therefore and pray always watch ye therefore and pray always so this is this is an attention given to your heart that it does not become overwhelmed and overburdened overcharged in these times if he told us in these times to give a attention to your heart that it don't become overloaded I think we should take the Lord's word and I think we should pray always and I I think we should watch always what are we watching over our hearts and our minds he said to do that and and that we may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man so don't let your heart and mind become overloaded overcharged with surfeiting and surfing means to desire no more of something as a result of consumed it or having it in excess in other words when we have things in excess then our hearts become overwhelmed that we don't even desire that thing much anymore we're on to the next thing because we've become overburdened and over we've had things in excess us Americans we have things in excess our minds are overwhelmed with the excess of everything that's right so Jesus God knew what age we live in he said that's what's going to happen in this time so he said to desire no more of something as a result of having consumed it or done it to an excess then he mentions drunkenness with its excessive consumption of something that's not just alcohol that's being excessive in the consumption of something until you become in a drunken condition and a numb condition and then he says which is a little bit more explainable the worries the anx xiety of Life becoming overwhelmed by the worries and cares and anxi anxiety of life I'd like to add something to this this morning in 2 Timothy 1:7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear we know that if that's hitting our minds and hitting our hearts and challenging us we know it didn't come from God right he has not given us the spirit of fear but what kind of spirit has he given us one of power and of love and of a sound mind that's his promise so in this time of trouble in this age he said my spirit will provide Power love and a sound mind he says there in 2 Timothy 1:7 if you want to put it up again in the King James in the Amplified that God God says it here and the Amplified this is just amplifies it a little bit for God did not give us a spirit of timid or kis or fear kise or fear he's not given us a spirit of fear he has given us a spirit of power and of love and of sound judgment and personal discipline abilities that result in a calm well balanced mind and self-control now that might be seem like it's adding to it but I like to be able to read that to show when he says he's given us the spirit of power love and a sound mind then it explains a little better that he provides sound judgment why does he have to provide that because in this age we don't have sound judgment and personal disciplin and then and the abilities that result in a calm in a peace well balanced mind and self-control these are going to become things that we need more and more A sound mind and a clear thinking mind and a mind that can make decisions based upon the word of God is going to become more and more important to us as the days roll on your mind needs to be protected from outside influences your heart and emotions and mind you need to have a guard over them as we said last Sunday and it's it's you might have seen okay this is important but this is really important that we have a sound sober thinking mind in this hour that we have this Spirit of love that we have this Spirit of power because we will be become weakened by the AIDS that we live in so in just reminding us some things he said last Sunday the human mind has become overloaded today by the things that Jesus said and he talks about overcharged with surfeiting with things that are uh uh given to us in this age to make us overburdened overloaded in our minds and if if you believe his prophecy about earthquakes Jesus spoke in Luke 21 in Matthew he gave prophecies earthquakes and diverse places all these fires taking place as we mentioned all of these we've been studying this and look at it for years every Christian knows that Jesus prophesied of everything that's happening right now but I wanted to say if you believe what Jesus said about earthquakes and famine and pestilences then we have to believe what he said about this time of trouble of worsening the effect on our hearts and Minds being manipulated and depressed and overwhelmed if you're going to say oh believe Jesus said earthquakes will come but you better believe even more so the the the challenge and the attack on our minds because it's just as much a part of the prophecy that's right the attack on Believers minds and Minds being manipulated I want to use that word because we're in the day of many things that it's not just influences you got around the wrong influence and it made you think that it impressed your mind today it's an intentional manipulation of the Mind especially children and young people and you have to stand flat-footed and know that as a believer that there's an agenda there's an effort of Satan to manipulate how I think to manipulate and try to kill my faith when I have faith in God he wants to kill that he wants to make us doubt that and so our minds we must stand and say I will not let my mind be manipulated I will not let my thinking be formed by the wisdom of this world that's how Str that's how bold we got to be about it I will not let my mind become depressed I will not let Satan depress my spirit and my emotions over something that's stupid can you say amen I will guard over it I will not allow my mind to be overwhelmed and uh we're not really meant to handle our minds the way God built them is not really meant to handle this time without God and without his power these Minds were not created to handle the type to age that we're in that's true and that's why he said I will send my spirit and provide for you power that you don't have that's right maybe in a simpler era we could have handled it better but your minds cannot handle it on its own in this era and God said I need to provide you with something he said if we make our request known to him he said the peace of God will flow to us and protect our hearts and Minds so we're not even meant to handle this time Satan knows that and he knows that the times and the and the overburden of our minds and hearts will make us edgy will make us angry will make us fearful we make us feel empty even the entertainments of this world will make us leaving leaving us feeling empty he knows it makes you seek Satan knows that it'll make you seek in these times of pressure a pacifier like a baby does a pacifier or a relief into some entertainment into some Escape other things that we need to do to relax and uh we must be careful of these things in the times we live in because they have a way of not just we think it's relaxing our mind but some things are not relaxing they're manipulating and they're controlling and it doesn't really relax us it makes us feel empty at the end that's right see yeah he knows all this and so we we we cry for Simplicity and peace in our minds and in our spirits and all he does is try to make life more complicated he puts things in our mind that are complicated that are filthy things lustful things and for us to feed on that and and I want to bring answers to it I don't want to just preach the diagnose the problems of this age I want to bring answers that it's not just talking about the problem that we have when I preach it most of you can nod and sayen yeah we definitely live during these times I think I'm all about answers too what answers does God give us to counter and overcome this Spirit of this age I want to bring answers not just the problem but you must not see this as a little problem you must see it as your mind and you must not think that your mind is exempt from being affected by these things right unless you protect it well I'm a Believer so I'm exempt from it only if you trust in the Holy Ghost you're your mind by itself is not exempt from the manipulation of the age and God wants to give answers to protect it to invite his peace that's what he wants so one thing I missed last Sunday is to talk uh specifically about a little bit of the science and we'll get that out of the way first because it can tend to get boring but it's not boring in the sense if you're looking at it what the world's saying now so I'm bringing it right up to last year the end of the year Oxford University press has chosen brain rot brain rot as its word of the Year 2024 a new word and it's the word of the year can you imagine this now we think we've Advanced we think that we've really went a long ways we think we're getting better and better and these guys at the University look it all over and they say we got a new word and it's the word of 2024 brain rot boy we've really ADV Advanced if our brains are rotting I got a word for the devil for last year brain renewal amen hallelujah can you say amen for the bride it's time for a brain renewal it's time to be renewed by the spirit in our minds by the power of transformation oh I wish I could tell some of it at at the Oxford University there's a power in the word there's a power that God's provided I'd like them to read in the scripture to say that you can don't have to be conformed to this world and let your brain rot that you can be transformed by the renewing of your mind by the word of God and by the power of God so if it wasn't last year I'm making it this year our word for the year for this church is not brain rot but brain and thinking Renewal by the word of God hallelujah amen but they say that the year word is brain rot the word is defined as a supposed deterioration of a person's mental or intellectual State especially viewed as a result of overc consumption of material now that's just what Jesus said an overc consumption don't be overcharged by the over consumption the OV excess that it overl the worries of Life override and so there's saying we'll come up with brain rot because the the slow deterioration of the brain and the thinking of a person's mental or intellectual State especially viewed as a result of the overc consumption of material now particularly online content so there's all different materials we've had for the last 60 70 80 years that have been Satan's agenda to get the wrong things in our mind but the online changed everything now it took it it Advanced it so particularly on online they say considered online content considered to be uh trivial and unchallenging also something characterized as likely to lead to such deterioration some experts believe that constant endless scrolling of social media boy I'm going to make some enemies now some experts believe that constant endless scrolling of social media and other online content is doing exactly that rotting our brains Behavior change expert Dr Kyra bobinet author of Unstoppable brain told Fox News digital that there's a growing awareness of brain rot and its consequences it's in the uh the the zeit kites that people have difficulty with their attention span zeit kites is this era this uh this time span what era we're in right now and that era of time means it's difficult with people to keep their attention span that's why I got to keep my sermon to about an hour today they feel brain so it's difficulty with the the attention span they feel brain foggy they have less concentration they can't do deep work said California based bobinet and there then there's also this epidemic of loneliness that has been kind of a sitting on the heels of all this because we can't really focus on anything including relationship building a certain part of the brain called the uh Hab habenula everybody knows how to say that but me Haba is a part of the brain is responsible for getting stuck in Endless scrolling according to bobinette the habula is a central part of the brain that's involved in various important functions including motivation and decisionmaking but when activated this area can also kill our motivation to try she noted it's the heart of when you know you should be doing something and you do this other thing instead like Doom scrolling I didn't know the word Zoom scrolling it means too much time reading negative news or social media content but somehow it dismantles this part and actually puts up a guard to you thinking and wanting to do other things you're supposed to be doing and shuts it down until you he she said scrolling on social media is also a way to disassociate and give the brain a rest after a long day bobinette said this is an avoidance behavior which the have bua controls this is part the part that can make decision this is the part of your brain that can make a decision to say no but it gets numbed so in other words the thing that's coming in that you're supposed to say no to it dismantles that dismantles the clear thinking that you should have that's bad because a lot of stuff can get in that you're numb to that shouldn't be getting in and I'm going to talk about some of those things today amen this is the part that can make the decision say no but it gets numbed it gets drunk so to speak not a clear thinking to make a clear decision just I'm almost done with this excessive social media use may have the same effects as the same effects as substance abuse say experts anytime you're avoiding something you know this is the area of the brain is on this area of the brain is on she said this is how social media addictions can form bobinet warned as this part of the brain can make it very painful to stop scrolling this can result in a dangerous loss of motivation and that they have warned the scientists have warned we all need motivation to live our lives and to feel proud of ourselves and to feel confident and to get what we want we need that and she told she told Fox News but then later she says as an answer and I'm always critical of all their answers they can diagnose the case but I got a better source to go for answers for this can you say amen amen but she says has a little bit of truth to it she says humans are very resilient she added once we know the truth about our bodies then we can do something about it Satan has studied the human being and their brain and how they think and what they do and why and be Satan the great psychologists has studied human beings they know how they tick 6,000 years is a long career right that's right come on now 6,000 years is a pretty long career to figure out how to tempt human beings and how to destroy them and how to bring brain rot and how to do it all he's got a pretty good track record and so now he's worked at this and then let me say this more personal to you he has studied you since you've been born I said to the young people the other night is that a boxer watches videos a football team watches videos of the opponent they're watching how they Works work watching their plays okay and so Satan studies you C you're War because not only that you have human being uh uh uh similarities but you yourself have certain BS and certain weaknesses and certain ways about you that is only about you and I only want to say if Satan studies that how to get you and how to tempt you from the day you were born then why can't you do a little bit more study on [Applause] yourself it's not good if Satan knows you better than you know yourself it's not good if Satan knows how the mind works better than us human beings oh I don't need to study that I got the Holy Ghost and that's all I need no no I think there's scriptures in the Bible that talked about guarding our heart guarding our mind putting things that are right in our minds I don't think it's just about getting the power of the Holy Ghost I think it's we grow in grace of God to learn who we are to learn who our enemy is how he gets in and stand and put a stop we ought to know how to possess our own vessel in sanctification and Truth Paul said that 2,000 years ago so well I'm a Believer I believe this message with all my heart but you ought to know how to possess your own vessel that's right in sanctification and in truth and if you're not going to learn that then the devil's going to be knocking you down all the time oh yeah right thank you that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor can you say amen amen and and then Paul uh said in another place that we are not ignorant of Satan's devices that's right so what's he saying saying there is that we study our enemy and we study ourselves how he gets in that we grow and mature in being a Powerhouse for the Lord saying he can't get in very easy because I studied how he gets in and I've studied myself I know how the brain works I know how my heart works I know what I can handle and what I can't handle and I know that better than my enemy I also know how to deal with the Enemy through the power of the name of Jes Jesus Christ I've got a power over the enemy that I can kick Devils out said come and hide with me and tell the devil you can have a lot of things but you can't have my mind you can't have my spirit my mind is not a garbage can and you I can't change the world I can't change what they put on my phone I can't change Hollywood I can't change what they're producing and I can't change the spirit that's in this world I can't change that if I could I would but there are things devil that I do have a control over and I can allow my mind to be changed and renewed by the word of God my mind my heart my soul can be transformed thank you for watching our service today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall life. church and if you would like to visit us in
