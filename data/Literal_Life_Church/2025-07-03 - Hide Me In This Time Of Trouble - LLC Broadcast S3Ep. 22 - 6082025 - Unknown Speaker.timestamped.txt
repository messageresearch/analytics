[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine
[0:02] and Literal Life Church in Petersburg,
[0:04] Michigan would like to invite you to
[0:06] take the next half hour and enjoy some
[0:08] time in the word of God. If you're
[0:11] hungry for more God, we believe you can
[0:13] be fed. And we pray that you'll be
[0:16] blessed. Visit our website for more
[0:18] information at literalife.urch.
[0:21] May God bless you, my friend. May the
[0:23] music and message encourage you today.
[0:28] [Music]
[0:30] coming clean.
[0:35] All the secrets he had kept from her
[0:39] so long
[0:42] are finally known.
[0:46] Her big mistake.
[0:50] It's that one regret that haunts her to
[0:54] this day.
[0:57] It just won't fade.
[1:02] So many different stories we thought
[1:07] could not be redeemed.
[1:09] But it's against our darkest failures.
[1:14] We start to see the beauty of the blood,
[1:20] the goodness of his grace, the mercy
[1:25] undeserved
[1:28] that could never be explained.
[1:32] Heaven's best takes all our scars
[1:36] for the worst in all of us.
[1:40] That's the glory of
[1:43] the cross, the wonder of his love.
[1:48] That's the beauty of the blood.
[1:53] [Music]
[1:58] What a thought.
[2:02] Just a single drop forever wipes away
[2:10] our every stain.
[2:13] And with its power,
[2:18] every chain that has us found lies at
[2:22] our feet
[2:25] and we stand free.
[2:28] That's the beauty of
[2:31] the blood, the goodness of his grace,
[2:36] the mercy undeserved
[2:40] that could never be explained.
[2:44] Heaven's rest takes all our scars for
[2:48] the worst in all of us.
[2:52] That's the glory of the cross. The
[2:57] wonder of his love.
[3:00] That's the beauty of the blood.
[3:04] [Music]
[3:11] When you get news
[3:16] from the doctor that you hoped you'd
[3:20] never hear.
[3:23] and fear
[3:25] sets in.
[3:27] But then the word
[3:32] like a standard it cries out, "Do not
[3:36] fear
[3:39] for you are healed."
[3:42] That's the beauty of the blood.
[3:46] The goodness of this grace,
[3:50] the mercy undeserved
[3:53] that could never be explained.
[3:57] Heaven's best has paid the price for our
[4:02] healing by his stripes.
[4:05] That's the glory of the cross.
[4:10] The wonder of his love. That's the glory
[4:15] of the cross.
[4:18] The wonder of his love.
[4:23] [Music]
[4:25] That's the beauty of the blood.
[4:29] [Music]
[4:34] The beauty of the blood.
[4:38] [Music]
[4:42] I'm reading from Psalms 27 this morning
[4:45] from the word of God together. If you
[4:47] have your Bibles, the Lord is my light
[4:49] and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The
[4:52] Lord is the strength of my life. Is he
[4:54] the strength of your life?
[4:57] If he's the strength of your life, whom
[4:59] shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even
[5:01] mine enemies and my foes, came upon me
[5:03] to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and
[5:06] fell. Though a host should encamp
[5:08] against me, my heart shall not fear.
[5:10] Though war should rise against me, in
[5:13] this will I be confident. One thing I
[5:16] have desired of the Lord that I will
[5:17] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[5:20] of the Lord all the days of my life. He
[5:23] said, "This is the one thing I desire in
[5:25] my life, and that is I'd seek after
[5:27] this, and that's to dwell in the
[5:29] presence of the Lord every day of my
[5:31] life." Can you say amen? And so, and to
[5:34] behold the beauty of the Lord, to
[5:36] inquire in his temple. For in the time
[5:39] of trouble, he shall hide me in his
[5:41] pavilion. In the secret of his
[5:43] tabernacle shall he hide me. He shall
[5:46] set me up upon a rock. And now shall
[5:49] mine head be lifted up above mine
[5:52] enemies. Round about me. Therefore will
[5:56] I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of
[5:59] joy. I will sing. Yay, I will sing
[6:02] praises unto the Lord. I want to speak a
[6:05] little bit out of Psalms 27, and I want
[6:07] to title this, hide me in this time of
[6:10] trouble. Hide me in this time of
[6:12] trouble. David is the only one that used
[6:14] this term four or five times in his
[6:16] writings uh besides Job. And uh he just
[6:20] says those words, hide me. And uh he
[6:23] asked God, God, hide me. Hide me. And
[6:26] I'm only one of the reasons I'm
[6:28] preaching this is because that's why
[6:29] that's the way I have felt lately and
[6:32] that is Lord just hide me. Just hide me.
[6:35] There's a certain protection. Can you
[6:36] say amen? And so he asked the Lord but I
[6:39] I was looking at it uh the last couple
[6:41] days and it seems a bit mysterious if
[6:45] you don't understand why David is saying
[6:47] hide me. It seems a bit mysterious
[6:50] because we know that David is a warrior.
[6:53] David was a fighter. David from his very
[6:55] young years as a teen was had faith in
[6:59] God and he wasn't afraid of anything. He
[7:02] proved himself to be unafraid of the
[7:05] enemy since he was a little boy. So if
[7:07] we were to use the context of him
[7:09] saying, "Lord, hide me. My enemies are
[7:11] encamped about me. Hide me." It doesn't
[7:13] seem like it's the right thing for David
[7:15] to say because he doesn't look like
[7:17] somebody that would hide from the enemy.
[7:19] He actually ran towards Goliath. Amen.
[7:23] He didn't have a problem of being afraid
[7:25] of the enemy. And he it just seems
[7:27] mysterious that he would say, "Lord,
[7:29] hide me from the enemy. They're encamped
[7:32] about me." And and and there's and
[7:34] there's there's I feel it moving in and
[7:37] approaching him to me. Kind of like we
[7:39] feel in the time we live in. And so he
[7:41] but you see, we we we don't have the
[7:43] impression from David's life that he was
[7:46] one that would be one that would run
[7:48] from the enemy or to hide. and and yet
[7:51] he's asking the Lord, "Hide me, Lord.
[7:53] Hide me." Yet, it is not running away or
[7:57] it's not being scared. In other words,
[7:58] he's not saying, "Hide me." Because he's
[8:00] afraid because he said at the beginning,
[8:02] "To whom shall I fear? I don't fear
[8:04] anything." He says, "The Lord is my
[8:06] strength. Of whom shall I be afraid?"
[8:08] He's not saying hide me because he's
[8:10] afraid.
[8:14] He's not saying it because he's wanting
[8:16] to run from the enemy. That's not David.
[8:18] And yet it is not a running away or a
[8:20] scared. He he says he is not afraid. Uh
[8:24] to whom shall I fear? I'm not afraid. He
[8:28] said in this will I be confident.
[8:30] There's full confidence here. There's no
[8:32] fear here. But yet we must realize that
[8:35] fear is around him. Fear is surrounding
[8:38] him. Can you say amen? Uh uh uh the the
[8:41] there's there's the enemy surrounding
[8:43] him. My foes that were coming to eat my
[8:45] flesh. He's being completely surrounded
[8:48] by the enemy. And so he's saying, "Hide
[8:51] me." Not because he's afraid, but
[8:53] because if he don't live in that secret
[8:55] place, then he's vulnerable to become
[8:58] influenced by this fear. That's right.
[9:03] Praise the Lord. So, uh, he says, "I'm
[9:07] confident." But he says this, "Hide me."
[9:09] That he says, "Let me live in a place
[9:12] that's protected and a place that's
[9:14] higher." another place that opens up to
[9:17] me that would be higher than the enemy.
[9:20] Now, in Psalm 64:2, the way he says it
[9:23] in hide me, he says it this way. He
[9:25] says, "Hide me from the secret counsel
[9:27] of the wicked."
[9:29] from the insurrection of the workers of
[9:32] iniquity.
[9:34] So, now we get a little bit more window
[9:36] into what he's saying, hide me from, and
[9:38] that is the the secret counsel of the
[9:41] wicked, from the insurrection of workers
[9:43] of iniquity. the secret counsel of the
[9:46] wicked. In other words, hide me. Don't
[9:48] let me be affected by what's being said
[9:51] about me in private.
[9:56] Things are being said about from my
[9:58] enemy and that's the secret counsel and
[10:00] things are but so now this is something
[10:02] he said hide me from that. And I'm just
[10:04] just pondering this morning with you.
[10:06] Why would he say hide me from that? I'm
[10:08] going to bring this out if I can. Why is
[10:10] David saying, "Hide me from the secret
[10:12] council of the wicked." I wonder if this
[10:15] hide me is not so much is is is not so
[10:18] much protection from a regular war or
[10:21] arrows that are coming at him. Uh he
[10:23] wouldn't be afraid of that. But maybe
[10:25] what he will hear that is being said
[10:27] about him and what he would hear being
[10:29] said about him might affect him a little
[10:31] bit and that would influence him and may
[10:34] influence him out of this place of
[10:36] protection. Job is the only other man
[10:38] who said, "Hide me." And he says it this
[10:40] way, which is to me a mystery behind it.
[10:42] Job 14:13 says, "Oh, that thou wouldest
[10:46] hide me in the grave."
[10:53] Oh, that thou wouldest hide me in the
[10:55] grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret
[10:58] until thy wrath be passed, that thou
[11:01] wouldest appoint me a set time and
[11:05] remember me. Now, I want to elaborate on
[11:07] this because uh all that Job went
[11:09] through, this is what he says. In all
[11:11] that he's gone through on earth, he
[11:13] said, "Hide me in the grave." In other
[11:16] words, there's a lot of pressure he went
[11:18] through, a lot of losses he had in this
[11:20] life, but he had a revelation of
[11:23] resurrection. How many know that Job had
[11:25] a revelation of resurrection?
[11:28] How many know that Job was not afraid of
[11:30] the grave? He's not afraid of the grave.
[11:33] He's not afraid of dying because he
[11:35] knows the grave is not the end for him.
[11:37] He's got a revelation that if I go
[11:40] there, it's not the end. It's actually
[11:42] just the beginning. And I will end this
[11:44] life someday. I will end the pressure
[11:46] here someday. And if I'm put in that
[11:48] grave to hide there, that's a good place
[11:50] for a Christian to hide because God's
[11:52] going to come and pull me out of that
[11:53] grave someday. Job thought it was a it
[11:56] was a it's it's a hideout. It's a place.
[11:59] Job never seen it as the end, but a
[12:01] hideout, a waiting room, a green room.
[12:04] Anybody know what? Everyone know what's
[12:05] a green room is? It's the green room.
[12:07] Green room before the big stage event.
[12:11] The green room is where all the artists
[12:13] go and they wait it out before they are
[12:17] invited to the big stage event and to
[12:19] perform.
[12:21] Praise the Lord. So until you're caught
[12:23] out on stage, you're, you know, and
[12:26] that's Job is in the green room waiting
[12:30] to be called for the big resurrection
[12:32] event. Praise the Lord, everybody.
[12:35] He wanted to be hiding until Jesus cried
[12:38] out. And there he was. All the Old
[12:40] Testament saints who died in the Lord,
[12:43] there they are hiding out in the grave.
[12:45] They're hiding in the grave. And
[12:46] everybody thought, "They're dead and
[12:47] they're gone." No, they're just in the
[12:49] green room waiting to be called on
[12:51] stage.
[12:53] And sure enough, when Jesus cried out
[12:55] with a loud voice, there was a power
[12:58] behind his voice of resurrection. And
[13:00] the Bible says they come out of the
[13:02] green room and they showed themselves in
[13:04] the city streets of Jerusalem.
[13:08] Their life wasn't over. The grave was
[13:10] the grave wasn't the end. They were just
[13:13] hiding out there in the time of trouble.
[13:17] There is a great intensity of the enemy
[13:19] be being encamped around the people of
[13:22] God in the time of trouble. There'll be
[13:25] a lot of trouble. We we we ask the Lord
[13:28] to hide us because we don't want to be
[13:30] caught in the trouble. It it's it's
[13:33] pride to say that I won't be caught in
[13:37] all this trouble. You have the
[13:38] vulnerability to be caught in the
[13:41] trouble around you.
[13:43] You have the the humanness, the human
[13:46] side, the fleshly side of you. If you
[13:48] feed on things enough, you will be
[13:51] caught in the web just like everybody
[13:54] else is caught in the web of
[13:56] pornography, of adultery, of family
[13:59] division. You'll be caught in that world
[14:01] because you're vulnerable to it. You'll
[14:03] be caught in it yourself. But God gives
[14:06] us an escape. God gives us a place out.
[14:11] And so in the time of trouble is when
[14:13] he's saying, "Would you please, Lord,
[14:15] hide me?" There's no need for us to hide
[14:19] unless
[14:21] there's danger all around. Can you say
[14:25] amen? Amen.
[14:27] Why is David saying, "Hide me, Lord.
[14:30] Hide me." Because there's danger all
[14:32] around it.
[14:34] If you don't realize there's danger all
[14:36] around you and that it could affect you,
[14:38] then you're not asking, "Lord, hide me.
[14:40] Hide me. Hide me in that rock. Put me on
[14:43] that rock." He's saying, "Lift me above
[14:46] my enemies. In the time of trouble,
[14:48] please hide me." He wouldn't be asking
[14:50] that unless there's danger all around
[14:51] the time of trouble. If you don't see
[14:53] there's danger around, then you don't
[14:55] see the value of that secret place. We
[14:57] need to be hidden away with Christ. The
[15:00] Bible says also that we live in perilous
[15:02] times, testing times. Can you say amen?
[15:06] Besides all the spirits and hell being
[15:08] unlooed around, unleashed around us, be
[15:11] besides the lustful spirits, the
[15:13] perverted spirits, all these things
[15:16] surrounding us. It's a time of trouble.
[15:18] But then the Bible says in the last days
[15:20] there'll be perilous times. That means
[15:22] testing time. We're vulnerable outside
[15:24] of his daily protection. There is a
[15:27] hedge from the spirit of this world.
[15:29] There's a protection from the spirit of
[15:31] this world is safety in Jesus Christ the
[15:34] word. Can you say amen?
[15:37] Do I need to be more specific? Demon
[15:40] power. Do I need to be more specific? If
[15:43] you don't think that you walk out of
[15:45] here and you're living in a dangerous
[15:46] time, then let me be more specific.
[15:50] Demon, demonic power from hell can be in
[15:54] music.
[15:59] Demonic power can be in movies. It can
[16:02] be in Tik Tok.
[16:05] It can be in books. It can be in social
[16:08] media. It can be on YouTube.
[16:13] If you're growing up as a Christian,
[16:14] right, that you you realize that that
[16:16] we're living in a spiritual battle of
[16:18] things that we can't see. And so
[16:21] something that you feed on too much, you
[16:23] could take a spirit so quickly and not
[16:25] even see that you took it.
[16:28] That's the danger that we live in. And
[16:30] and I can't I can't come with you every
[16:33] day and watch over you. And some of you
[16:35] kids growing up, your parents can't
[16:36] watch over you every waking minute. They
[16:39] they can't see all the time what's on
[16:40] your phone. And so danger, danger,
[16:43] danger. When you get older, danger,
[16:45] danger. Not because your parents is
[16:47] warning you or your preacher is getting
[16:49] red in the face warning you. It's danger
[16:50] not because I said it. It's danger
[16:52] because the demonic power that's against
[16:54] your life. It's a dangerous time. So,
[16:57] you're not going to take a loose
[16:58] attitude towards a dangerous time. I
[17:01] wish I'd have never given my kids a
[17:03] phone at whatever it was, 14, 15 years
[17:05] old. I wish I'd have set the age at like
[17:08] 30.
[17:10] Yeah, good luck with that. It could have
[17:13] been a great instrument for the kingdom
[17:14] of God. And in some ways today, it's it
[17:17] is being used that way. could have been
[17:19] a great the devil got a hold of it
[17:21] becomes the worst place for trash and
[17:23] demonic power to come across.
[17:27] You ever heard about a movie years ago
[17:29] and in in the 80s called Poltergeist?
[17:32] It's about demons.
[17:35] This all the way back in the 80s and the
[17:37] inspiration comes to some director and
[17:39] he pegs demons come into somebody's
[17:41] household. This is the story of the
[17:42] movie.
[17:44] demons come into the household and it
[17:45] comes because a little girl is sitting
[17:47] and the TV after midnight goes into this
[17:50] fuzzy static whatever and she's watching
[17:53] this during the night late when the kids
[17:56] have gone to bed and that all of a
[17:58] sudden through that brings demons into
[18:01] that home and they suffer in that home
[18:03] with demonic power for months and months
[18:06] and months and they don't know what's
[18:08] going on but they started it came
[18:10] through the TV. Yeah, that's right.
[18:12] There's a movie saying this out there
[18:15] completely blatant about it. So here it
[18:17] is. And so now they go through months
[18:18] and find they can't get them out. They
[18:20] can't do they're haunting them every
[18:21] night. This is and I'm I'm not
[18:24] encouraging you at all to watch it for
[18:25] sure because it'll bring demonic power
[18:27] in your home. But you see now it's it's
[18:30] real. It's real. But it started with
[18:32] that. And so now it gets to the end of
[18:33] it and you know they had to almost
[18:35] destroy that entire house. They had to
[18:37] move. They could not get them out. Had
[18:39] no power of God to do it. So they
[18:40] couldn't they had to move. I think they
[18:42] even, if I remember right, they
[18:43] destroyed the entire house and
[18:45] everything, went to a motel with their
[18:48] family. And the last, I didn't expect to
[18:51] say this today, but this is this is
[18:52] good. The last scene of the movie is dad
[18:56] takes the TV in the motel
[19:00] and rolls it out to the sidewalk and
[19:03] shuts the door of the motel. And that's
[19:05] the last scene
[19:07] cuz daddy realized that's how it all got
[19:10] started.
[19:14] Now, it's hard to preach these things
[19:15] today because it's not popular cuz I
[19:17] know there's a lot of integrated stuff.
[19:19] My family and I every once in a while we
[19:21] if we have a a a nice evening, which is
[19:23] very rare, we have time to do it, but
[19:26] we'll watch a decent thing. This new
[19:27] chosen series, all these, we like
[19:29] something decent. I let the kids watch
[19:31] Vegetels when they're young. It's not
[19:33] that we didn't have a video and a
[19:34] monitor and a a a TV in our home because
[19:36] of that, but it was very restricted what
[19:38] came through that screen. And a lot of
[19:40] was because I read things like that
[19:41] years ago. This is real. Don't be
[19:43] vulnerable.
[19:44] This is a dangerous time to live in.
[19:49] And that's why David said this is
[19:52] dangerous. The enemy is not out there.
[19:54] He's encamped right up to my door. And
[19:57] so what am I saying? Hide me.
[20:00] Hide me, Lord. Amen. Amen. Let me become
[20:04] so hidden in Christ that the devil
[20:06] doesn't know where to find me.
[20:09] Is this okay with everybody today? Hide
[20:12] me, Lord. Hide me because of the danger
[20:15] that's around me. So, he's honest and
[20:17] saying, "If you don't hide me, I'll be
[20:19] affected by what's around me." I'll be
[20:22] affected by what people say about me.
[20:26] Amen. Praise the Lord. Demonic power can
[20:29] be in those things. The last days men
[20:31] shall here we go. In the last days,
[20:33] testing time because men shall be lovers
[20:35] of their own selves, covetous, boasters,
[20:38] proud, disobedient to parents,
[20:40] unthankful, unholy, without natural
[20:42] affection, truth breakers, false
[20:45] accusers. This is all the last days
[20:47] stuff. truth breakers, promise breakers,
[20:50] false accusers, despisers of those that
[20:52] are good, incontinent, unholy, and with
[20:57] all that, hello, having a form of
[20:59] godliness.
[21:02] Christians,
[21:05] Christians that don't have the Holy
[21:07] Ghost and all these manifestations of
[21:10] the last days are all there.
[21:13] That's a dangerous time. That's the last
[21:16] days as well. in the last days, they'll
[21:18] mock the promise of God. They'll mock it
[21:20] on the internet. They'll mock it.
[21:21] They'll mock this message. It's it's a
[21:23] mocking time. It's things being said
[21:25] against it to to to try to produce fa
[21:29] lack of faith in your life. So, h having
[21:31] said all that, uh you know, plus it's a
[21:34] form of godness. And I don't want to
[21:36] forget always what he says at the end of
[21:37] all that. From such, turn away.
[21:41] Well, that sentence has more power in it
[21:42] than all the rest. from such all that
[21:45] turn away. No, I think I'll hang around
[21:48] that guy at work because I want to
[21:50] witness to him and I want to hang around
[21:52] him a bit, try to save him.
[21:56] I'll go with him to the bar because I I
[21:58] just need to hang around him and do some
[22:00] missionary work.
[22:04] Bible said from such turn away.
[22:07] And if they're hungry for if you're
[22:10] living the life of Christ filled with
[22:12] the spirit. If they're hungry, they're
[22:14] going to thirst for that. They're going
[22:16] to start asking you questions.
[22:20] I I'm going to I'm going to witness to
[22:22] them. I'm going to do and time after
[22:24] time, I'm going to go help this person
[22:26] because they're they're having they're
[22:28] going through this time. And they go
[22:29] help them and that spirit turns them
[22:31] around
[22:34] because they're not strong. They don't
[22:36] have the solid Christ in their life yet.
[22:37] So, they think they can handle it, but
[22:39] they're vulnerable. They're in a
[22:40] dangerous spot.
[22:43] Dangerous ground. Run into a safe place.
[22:46] That's what David said. I want to run.
[22:49] The name of the Lord is a strong tower.
[22:53] Wherein the righteous run into it
[22:56] and are safe. So, this is what I'm
[22:58] preaching to you today. The devil, it's
[23:01] not good enough for him just to accuse
[23:03] and just to come against you and just
[23:05] No, he actually wants to pull you
[23:10] from your atmosphere in your secret
[23:12] place into the same atmosphere as him.
[23:16] The devil complicates this message so
[23:18] much. He complicates everything.
[23:21] This message is not meant to be
[23:23] complicated. And don't forget he said in
[23:25] the scripture he says God is not the
[23:28] author of confusion.
[23:31] So it's easy to say if there's confusion
[23:33] and doubt and fear and complicated Satan
[23:37] is trying to anoint you with the spirit.
[23:39] No, it's the simplicity God in
[23:42] simplicity.
[23:44] And if someone's trying to shake you out
[23:46] of that simple life, then you just just
[23:48] stand and say, "Lord, hide me.
[23:52] Hide me. Let them say what they want to
[23:54] say. Hide me in your pavilion. How many
[23:57] you want to be hidden today? Hide me,
[23:59] Lord, so I'm not affected by this. And
[24:02] if you get in in the boat and Jonah gets
[24:04] in your boat, if you got a Jonah in your
[24:06] boat, you know what they did with them?
[24:09] Get off of my boat. I mean, I know it's
[24:12] a simple little lesson, but and you
[24:13] probably learned it in Sunday school,
[24:15] but like if you have a Jonah that's
[24:17] running from the presence of the Lord
[24:18] and rebellious and running from the
[24:20] things that's being preached and doing
[24:21] the opposite, then get off of my boat.
[24:25] Amen. God's going to deal with you, but
[24:28] don't stay in my boat because if you
[24:30] stay on my boat, my boat might start
[24:32] sinking and I don't want my boat to
[24:34] sink.
[24:37] Get off of my boat, Jonah.
[24:41] So in Psalms 27
[24:44] I would say this that it's not so much
[24:46] hiding even though he uses that word but
[24:49] when the other words are there when it
[24:50] says he li he shall lift my head above
[24:53] he shall set me up upon a rock and he
[24:56] shall lift my head above my enemies it's
[24:58] not so much about hiding in this but
[25:00] it's but it's lifting us above it all
[25:03] that we can live above it all set me on
[25:06] a rock above my enemies praising the
[25:09] Lord because it says here he sets me up
[25:12] my head above the enemies. How many
[25:14] would say I want to live above my
[25:15] enemies.
[25:17] It's another atmosphere. It's something
[25:19] else. I want to live above it. And
[25:20] therefore will I offer in this
[25:22] tabernacle sac sacrifices of joy and I
[25:25] will sing. Yay. I will sing praises unto
[25:28] the Lord. So David is so confident here.
[25:31] He says, "When you lift me up above my
[25:33] enemies, you put me in a place, set me
[25:35] on a rock and you lift me up above my
[25:38] enemies that I can at least be above
[25:40] them and and then what I'm doing up
[25:42] there is I'm praising. I will offer the
[25:45] sacrifices of joy. I'm not going to be
[25:48] shy to praise the Lord." You know, isn't
[25:51] it wouldn't it be annoying as you know,
[25:53] David sat on the rock and he's just
[25:54] praising the Lord and all his enemies
[25:57] are down there and he's not even looking
[25:59] at them.
[26:01] Glory be to God. Praise be to God. And
[26:05] you start singing like, I will not come
[26:09] down to the devil's level. He set me up
[26:13] on a rock. Can you say amen? I'll pray
[26:16] for you, my brother, but guess what? I'm
[26:18] not coming down to where you're at. I
[26:21] don't want your fear. I don't want your
[26:22] doubts. I don't want your nervousness. I
[26:25] want to live in this secret place above
[26:27] my enemies.
[26:29] And you can imagine if this spirit is
[26:31] true that it's always trying to drag you
[26:33] down. They're not happy that you're up
[26:35] there, but they're saying, "Hey, get
[26:37] down here. I got something to talk about
[26:38] with you. Get down. What do you get down
[26:40] here? Why can't they come up with you?"
[26:44] They might not be called to it, but if
[26:45] they are, they don't want to come up
[26:46] there. You need to hear my case. You
[26:48] need to hear my disgruntliness. You need
[26:50] to hear this. Get down here. Get
[26:55] step off of that chair and get out of
[26:57] that place. and we're saying, "No, I
[26:59] want to live there. One thing have I
[27:02] desired."
[27:05] Can you imagine a believer saying, "Out
[27:08] of all the things that we could ask for,
[27:11] there's really today only one thing I
[27:13] want above money, possessions,
[27:16] retirements.
[27:19] I know I can say this in my heart. above
[27:21] a better job, above more money, above
[27:24] retirements, above all the things. One
[27:26] thing is what I really want and I'm
[27:28] going to seek after it. I want to dwell
[27:30] in the house of the Lord every day of my
[27:31] life. I want to stay there. I'm going to
[27:34] stay up on that chair. Can you say amen?
[27:36] I will not get down here. Get down here.
[27:39] No.
[27:41] No.
[27:45] I will not come down to the devil's
[27:49] level. I will not come down to Satan's
[27:55] ground.
[27:57] Satan's ground. Oh, when the devil comes
[28:03] around, I'm going to move right up to
[28:08] higher ground. For watching our service
