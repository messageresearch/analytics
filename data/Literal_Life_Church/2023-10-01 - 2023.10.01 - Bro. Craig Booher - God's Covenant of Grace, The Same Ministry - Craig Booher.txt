have I seen when we go to a place like that the presence of the Lord come in and show himself so so real to those people just a small group and there was a few message Believers there but just a small group but I'll tell you the pastor really identified that he hadn't felt that presence that way for many many years so we thank the Lord CU God can bring his anointing through a song Through the word and a song Whatever It Is and uh I was just amazed and and then they just really enjoyed Sharon's testimony as well and uh at the end the pastor asked to pray for her and we all come up and the whole church gathered around her and I thought it was real special and uh that their faith Rose to that place we sang the song Same God he's the same God is living in me I tell you what a what a revelation

we thank God he's on the throne we appreciate the Lord amen Hallelujah just happy to have my family with me again too so we're just just happy let's turn in our bibles if we can I'm I'm not hearing anything in my ear monitors uh if you could help me out there Genesis chapter 15 and I'm going to it's a little lengthy so I just ask for your patience I want to I think I read 18 verses I want to start with verse one and I just didn't feel that it was that I could really cut anything out of it I wanted to just read the whole portion so uh Genesis chapter 15 and we will we will start with verse one everybody there after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abram said Lord God what will thou give me saying I go childless and the steward of my house is this elaser of Damascus and Abram said behold to me thou Hast given me no seed and lo one born in my house is my Heir and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thy ear thy air but he that shall come forth out of thine own bows shall be thine air and he brought him forth abroad and said look now towards the heavens and tell the Stars if thou shall be able to number them and he said unto them so shall thy seed be and Abram said behold to me thou I'm sorry I'm sorry verse six sorry and he believed in the Lord and He count honored him for righteousness and he said I am the Lord that brought thee out of her Chi to give thee this land to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and he said take me a heer of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years and a turtle dove and a young pigeon and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against the other but the birds divided he not and when the fowls came down upon the carcasses Abram drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo a of great Darkness fell upon him and he said un to Abram knowest of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterward shall they come out with a great substance and thou shall go to thy fathers in peace and thou shall be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again and the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full and it came to pass when the sun went down it was dark and behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces and in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed have I given thee this land from the river of Egypt unto the river the the river the Great River the river Euphrates we'll stop there and I would like to preach this morning on God's Covenant of Grace and I and I would just like to subtitle it the same Ministry if we could just go to the Lord in prayer together Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your presence this morning Lord it warms our hearts it brings peace to our hearts in this confusion that we fight Lord we come in to the house of the Lord in our heart Hearts feel at rest Lord I ask dear God that the Holy Spirit Will begin to Quicken our ears to the hearing of Thy word our hearts Lord to the receiving of Thy word and we lord we ask God if anyone has seen this morning that it'll be you and I pray that you'll be glorified in your people for the glory of God we ask it amen you can have your seats thank you so much yes please just a moment just we'll get situated here just a second you can work on it matter of fact let's not do it I'll just just use the monitors praise the Lord Brother Ed bisc used to say there'll be no wires in heaven praise the Lord now I'm feeling comfortable I wonder preach this morning on the grace of God the subject of the grace of God the Bible said by grace are we saved how many believe that by grace are we saved through faith and not of yourselves it is the gift of God and brother Brenham said the subject of Grace it goes back is old as the world he said that that Grace really when it come to God was always the message it has always been God's way brother bam said I can't see nothing else but the grace of God he said that that's my whole makeup he said I always did believe in grace he said even my life when I was a boy I could see nothing but Grace he said now he said they say that you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours he said that is an awful expression he said I don't care whether you scratch mine or not if yours needs scratch and I'll scratch it anyhow he said that's Grace regardless if you never done nothing for me he said he said he said if you need it he said I'll do it he said Grace does it because you need it he said I needed saving and there was nothing that could save me there was nothing that I could do for myself I needed saving and he he said and I believed God how many can say Amen man has always tried to save himself man has always tried to reach for God but the only thing that can save us is the grace of almighty God how many believe that free unmar Grace Hallelujah when Adam and Eve had fallen in the beginning God had put him on a conditional if you eat from the Tree of knowledge uh you you'll die if you eat from the Tree of Life you will live and brother benam said but man will always break his end man cannot keep his end Hallelujah that's why that's why it takes the grace of God but brother bham said as soon as they fa he said they come under the death penalty they begin to move out of the presence of God and the Lord said the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent and when he said it that was unconditional everything that God does will it'll be in the unconditional Covenant Grace will bring us healing Grace will bring us salvation but Grace will make a way when there is no way how many believe that it's Grace that does it for you it's Grace that brings you to God it's God's Grace that you're sitting here this morning it's Grace that'll do the work in your life there's none of us that have ability there's none of us that have be able to find our way out Hallelujah brother brandom said when God began with Abraham he said the first thing that he did was he called Abraham as 75 years old he said it was the grace of God that called him he said he was a root worshipper there was nothing special about Abraham and God just called a normal man like he called you and I just normal run-of-the-mill people and he said the first thing that he done was put him in in an unconditional Covenant he said because every time man touches the condition he fails on his end he said but God was determined to save man and I want to bring it personal God is determined to save us the morning God is determined to save our young people and to heal those that are sick God is determined to send the Holy Ghost Revival it is nothing about us it's all about the grace of God hallelujah and he told him he said I have made you a father of Nations I am making something out of you Abraham out of you will come forth My Chosen Nation Hallelujah he told him he he said look at the stars he said can you number them Abraham said no he said look at the dust can you number he said no he said so will your seed be but he was going to do to the seed what he did to Abraham from the dust I'm going to lift you into the Stars God takes men that are nothing women that are useless and the grace of God visits them turns the course of their life and makes them useful Hallelujah brother brandham said that the unconditional Covenant in Abraham's life was the act of God that's right it was all about God the story the focus is all about God God hallelujah hallelujah amen it's absolute Grace yes you believe that and brother Brom said Abraham had his ups and downs Abraham had his blunders but the grace of God held Abraham and the devil is going to oppose it brother bam said the reason God gives a Grace Covenant is the adversary is too great for us that's what he said but the grace of God is a enough his grace is sufficient how many believe that God is steering the ship God is controlling your trials God is here this morning he knows every life he knows every burden he knows every every prayer request so Abraham backslides blunder and the Bible records it for us just makes a a blunder God don't leave this country Abraham storms right out of the country then uh then the king said look at that woman that is the woman that I've wanted all my life he said is that your wife he said that's my sister he said perfect I'll take her she looks over at Abraham said I am going to kill you I said sh he said you get a RIT boys we'll have a wedding tomorrow and brother Venom said he had his got a shower and got a shower cap on and amick stuck his feet up on the end of the bed wiggling his toes and said think about it the woman of my dreams tomorrow I'm going to have that man's sister God came to him in a dream why didn't God come to Abraham and said you know what you really messed up God didn't God brother bham said that amick was like a Holiness preacher and he said he came to amick and said you're as good as a dead man and he said what did I do he said you got a man's wife he goes he told me it was his sister he goes well it is his wife and that is my Prophet see God in his grace had claimed Abraham as a piece of his property Hallelujah and God has claimed his church as his [Applause] property now he took a fight up with God and God said if you don't turn her loose I'll wipe out your entire nation and furthermore my lion Prophet is going to pray for your sinful [Applause] Soul Brother Bram said Amazing Grace Hallelujah he said why how did God do it he said because she was a part of Abraham and out of her would come the lineage of the Messiah and God was protecting the bloodstream it was the grace of God that did [Applause] it Hallelujah God hallelujah and then it come time to deliver after holding in faith it was time for God to deliver and the angel says Sarah will have a son a year from now and she laughed and brother brandham said that God had a right to strike her dead but he could not because God had bound himself by his own unconditional promise in to Abraham and she was a part of Abraham and he could not slay her because through her would come the promise and brother benam said God would have struck every one of us in this room dead but he cannot because we are a part of him we are a part of his word amen so the grace of God overrode it how many appreciate the Lord Abraham made mistakes Sarah made mistakes you will make mistakes we have all made mistakes but the grace of God will deliver because we're a part of his word hallelujah not because Abraham was good but because God is is good hallelujah look at the book of Exodus we find that the Bible said that the people were groaning under the under the whip of the Taskmaster they were discouraged and the Bible said their ear their their groans came into the ears of God and the Bible said God remembered God remembered his Covenant he remembered the promise that he gave Abraham we just read it in our opening scripture now Moses was born the proper child they knew he was to deliver but he tuck tailed and run brother bham said he found a beautiful Ethiopian girl and he was going to be an heir of a good flock he said he was retired I mean things were going good outside of maybe a a high hot-tempered wife but other than that things were going good good now you would think that God would say you know you you're no good for nothing Moses you failed me you run you're not worthy to do what I want you to do but the Bible said God remembered his promise God remembers his Covenant God remembers his people God remembered Moses so in order to bring forth the Deliverance he first had to fix Moses and his grace brother his grace will do the fixing how many believe that so Moses going down a familiar Trail comes into the presence of the pillar of fire and the Lord said I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I remember my promise L amen sometimes you got to remind him yeah how many believe that yes sir God remembers every promise that he has madeen Hallelujah God when he ordains something it must come to pass and God has ordained a church in this day God has ordained a bride in this day God has ordained a body change in this day and that word must come to pass and it will not be any big eyes or little yous it'll be the grace of [Applause] God it is the grace of God that has brought you this far it is the grace of God that has taken you to the Valley of the shadow of death and taken you through your trials and your tribulations and your disappointment when you thought you could not go another day it is the grace of [Applause] God am hallelujah we're standing here not in our own none of us will have bragging rights at that day we'll all throw our crowns and say glory to the Lamb of [Applause] God hallelujah so our opening scripture Abraham now is is asking the Lord you promised me a seed yeah and I've got elizer he's a good boy boy I'll just adopt him and that'll be your promise I help you and the Lord said no this will not be your ear but one that will come out of you will be my air I want to manifest it through you and I don't want substitutes I don't want shortcuts I want to manifest my promise through and in you praise God he said but where is the seed Lord the Bible said in chapter 15:8 our opening scripture that same day yeah pull up if you will Verse 18 in that same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thee have I given thee this land in the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river Euphrates brother renom and he speaks about it a lot he gives an interesting description here because now God is making a covenant with Abraham and brother Benham said back in this day and I can I'm not going to take the time but I can show you by scripture that they that this is true they would they would divide a sacri sacrifice in half they would take its hide and they would write a covenant and then they would split it right down the middle and and and those two pieces of the contract would go to the one and to the other and the agreement was made and then they would write their Covenant on it now brother bham said that they would tear the animal or the sacrifice apart Hallelujah and brother bam said now this this is what God was doing to Abraham he said Abraham kills the sacrifices as God had told him you know kill the sacrifices and the doves split them and so forth not the doves but he said split them in half representing the old and the New Testament and the dove was not to be divided and then the agreement was under the shed blood meaning the Covenant was under the death of an innocent sacrificial victim and then then the two parties once again would keep each part of the hide or the leather the Covenant and then in this scene the Bible said a deep sleep fell upon Abraham he he was keeping all the birds in the evening time he was keeping the birds off the sacrifices brother ROM said that's like Spirits we're casting them away from the word of God and as the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abraham and God this is unconditional he is saying Abraham not if but I am going to do this for you I want you to catch this so God is very specific and then the Bible tells us as he went to sleep brother Bron said what is he showing he's saying brother you have nothing to do with this Abraham has nothing to do with this we are resting on the unconditional Covenant and then he said darkness and Blackness fell Darkness he said and a smoking furnace he said what was that the darkness is death that every one of us are going to face he said the smoking furnace represented hell and then a sacred light passed between those two sacrifices brother Brenham said the light was the pillar of fire the same one that let Israel the same one that met Paul the same one that is here now he said the pillar of fire was signing the contract and this covenant could never be duplicated the only way we would know that it was the true Covenant is both pieces have to dovetail and come back together perfectly again this would be the agreement this would be the Covenant Hallelujah God is speaking to Abraham and his seed now a good way to describe it is brother Brenham used the the Chinese Laundry ticket and he said back then the China men they came to the US they might have had a language barrier and they would have the cards they would write something and rip it in a certain way and give you the other side now the only way you can redeem your dirty clothes which are made clean is to come and give that that other side of the Covenant now the only way you it could not be duplicated it was ripped in a certain way written in a certain way and then when you came back you were sure to redeem what was yours right all right Hallelujah brother Brandon I want you to catch this brother Bram said he was speaking to Abraham's seed and when Jesus came on the seat his ministry was the matching piece he said every prophecy his life dovetailed every Prophet whether it be David or Moses or or or All Through the Bible his life his ministry it match the Bible and brother Brenham said at Calvary God was writing the Everlasting Covenant we he took Jesus up between Heaven and Earth and he ripped him apart at Calvary and his body was raised up on the right hand of God and God ripped out his soul and poured out his Spirit upon the [Applause] church and now the church in order to go in the resurrection must have the same spirit that was in Christ the Covenant is the baptism of the Holy Ghost your pastor has been preaching on it the same life and the same power and we are all called by the grace of godall Hallelujah there can be no impersonator of it Jesus died in the evening time the Covenant was written and the Bible said I will write my Covenant upon their hearts how many believe that and brother random said this he said now we are the bride of Christ and he said the Bride of Jesus will have to have the same spirit that the other part of the contract had it's got to have the same life it's got to have the same works you know what that means you must possess the other side of the contract you must possess it in your soul and you say I hold a part of that contract how many believe that how many are holding that I want to I want to just take a side J just a moment in the end time ministry and I and I'm not calling names to be mean I'll just use Billy Graham and Billy Graham I have a great respect for there was no scandal in his life he he lived clean I I respect Billy Graham and there's others that have no Scandal good men they achieved a lot won many souls and done good for the kingdom but what modern Ministry can dovea with the Bible what modern Ministry have you found in this age that could actually dovetail with Jesus ministry The Works that I do you shall do [Music] also and I could go through and I don't want to call names to be mean and so forth but there's 30 there's 45,000 denominations I pray tell which one shows the other side of the Covenant now I want you to take and examine brother bram's Ministry his healings his miracles his discernment his prophecy y his accuracy his power his scriptural teachings his character the supernal the controlling of nature I want you to look at it and do you see the ministry of Jesus [Applause] Christ what Ministry and history matches the Bible Hallelujah everything the angel told Brother Brenham duct tailed perfectly with the scriptures I want you to think about it now brother bandham teaches by nature and nature runs fluid with the word he teaches it by history he teaches it by mathematics he teaches it by the Zodiac he teaches it in d tales by the seals and by the church ages and by the Supernatural in every detail it's Dov tailing showing God in threes and fives and and all of those things I'm trying to express that this message has matched has matched the Covenant [Applause] Abraham dovetail is a word that is used in I don't know if there's any Woodworkers or Furniture workers in here but they use that term Dov tapil and making cabinets and so forth It's a joint that holds real strong right and it's a Craftsman or a carpenter's term Jesus would have used those terms and that dovetail means to join together how many want to be joined together God is looking for a church that it Dove tails with him that is joined together with him it is the Ministry of Jesus Christ we see God in the zodiac god in history God in the Bible we see God in the pyramids brother Ram said every one of those stones dovetailed so perfectly he said that they were earthquake proof the pyramid and The Headstone must come together and in order for it to come together it has to D tail to the top so the coming of the Lord has a place to set Hallelujah line upon line right it's what the pastor was preaching Wednesday line upon line precept upon precept amen how many appreciate word upon word life upon life Lord let my life tie with that scripture and now a church with only Doctrine and no life power and spirit is not the other side of the [Music] contract all scripture sets together brother Brandon would take every type and Shadow of the Bible and weave it with every major Doctrine in every truth how how is that possible a man with a seventh grade education and you could tell by his preaching he had a seventh grade education and I don't mean that negative God is showing it's the grace of God that's bringing this to you it is it is not connected to a man though it's manifested in man God give us discernment to hear what the spirit is saying brother bom said the messages of those seven angels is Dov tailing with the word even the prophecies are duv tailing he said the Vision Plus the word plus history plus the church ages they're all Blended together it's thus sayith the Lord he said the opening of those seals there is no contradictions the 70 weeks tied perfectly with the ages the church ages tied and Blended perfectly with the seals marriage and divorce Blended perfectly with serpent seed and God is revealing himself in the Bible God is reveal it's God in his word God in his Universe God in his son God in his people hallelujah so brother renom said we have proved it by the word and by history and by signs and by Supernatural amen now I want to express where I really think the rubber meets the road when Jesus was baptized the spirit of God like a descended upon the lamb brother bam said the dove could not fall upon a wolf the L the lamb the dove had to fall upon a nature like itsself nature of Heaven and Earth must blend amen so not only in Doctrine not only in history not only in the Supernatural but in characterall the two Natures must become one the alpha and the Omega can I go a little further on August 25th 1960 brother brandom is going squirrel huntting bear with me I'm going somewhere just you do you're a great great you're really paying attention we appreciate the Lord Brother brandom is going squirrel hunting and he goes into a familiar Place furthermore it's where he had the experience with the squirrels right and he said I see three rainbows coming up out of the Hill he said they were running some 30 foot in the air he he said whatever it was it was alive he was pulsating with life and he said he tried to get close but the spirit warned him and said that's far enough and he said the three rainbows was going into a bull like Affair and he screamed Lord what would you have your servant know and the response of the spirit was Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the old he was only changing his mask brother ROM said of course he was confirming the message that I have preached God was confirming the message he said and we are saved by grace not of works it is Grace that saves you he said I thought of the grace of God that would take a poor Wretch like myself and give him an opportunity to preach the gospel to bring healing to people that homes that are broke up will be straightened up again he said he gave me the grace it's amazing grace and God formed himself in the form of a rainbow which means Covenant meaning God will be behind it like he was AB abah you Lord I think it's amazing just to take a side J when we talk about Matthew 28 the baptism of the Father Son and Holy Ghost to me this is incredible brother BR said oh no that is not three persons it's three dispensations the fatherhood God above us the son God With Us now the Holy Ghost God in us he said those three are not persons their dispensations that God came from Heaven to man into the church Hallelujah and when God said I will restore sayith the Lord this is an unconditional Grace Covenant it came from a sovereign God and brother brandham said Sovereign Grace comes from a sovereign one and Sovereign means supreme or highest in power Superior to all others I want you to think about independent of and unlimited by any other yeah that's right so brother BR makes a statement Sovereign Grace must come from a sovereign one amen yes and I want you to think about this a minute as the scripture gives us a definition how many believe in the grace of God now here was David a man after God's Own Heart here is a man that was used of God but somehow he got ens snared and he falls with beath Sheba brother brandham said both of them had a part in it but he you know the story he took bash Sheba got her pregnant realized he was in trouble took the life of your IAH a very faithful Warrior and a faithful man and then all of a sudden Nathan appears after David thinks that he escaped the whole situation and he tells him a parable of a lamb and how a man loved that lamb like his own daughter and this Rich ungodly neighbor killed that man's lamb and fed it to his guest and David that he hit the nerve and David by his own judgment said that man will die and Ean said you are the [Applause] man and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit Spotlight went on David and David saw his sin openly yeah and David said I have sinned and he said and God has put away your iniquity according to the scriptures he should have died that's the word of God how did he get a pardon when the immutable word of God said death it came came from a sovereign God that can do what he wants to it came was Sovereign Grace that came on the scene for David we need the grace of God we need Sovereign Grace in our lives hallelujah hallelujah and brother random said this story of a man that was sentenced to die and the the king came up and said drink the water he said he said here's a drink the water and he said and because afterwards you're going to die and the man was shaking like this and he couldn't drink it he said come on you're not going to die until you drink it the man looked he caught it he threw the water out and that don't make sense unless you look at it to the eyes of a sovereign one who will stand by his word and the King being sovereign spoke a word he was willing to stand by and because he stood by it it freed the man and I want you to think of this and brother brandham gave that as an example when God makes a covenant he stands behind that Covenant everybody with me God cannot go back on his word God will not renig on his word God spoke it God will perform it you can depend upon it you can live by it you can stand by it God stands with it thank you Father hallelujah hallelujah brother Brenham said Jesus Christ is the Covenant he tore him apart at Calvary received his body up and sent back the Holy Spirit and when the Resurrection comes the same spirit that was in Jesus is the only thing that'll raise your body up to meet that one there that makes husband and wife the bride is the Covenant people [Music] unconditionally God called you out of the world God gave you the Holy Ghost the Seed of Abraham tonight he said with the Blessed promise you believe God regardless of what takes place cuz there is a bride and there is a groom that was in brother Joe's song and the same spirit that was on Christ must be on you in order to be in the Covenant this is why the pastor preaches on the Holy Ghost Christ in you is the hope of glory the love that was in him is in you Hallelujah you are the the Covenant people and it is no ifs ands or buts it's an unconditional Covenant look what it did for Abraham look what it done for Israel all Israel shall be saved it was an inccond unconditional Covenant I want you to see your position this morning I want you to look at yourself as not someone barely making it but I want you to look to him that made you the promise I hope all hell begins to shake God open our hearts open our eyes that we might see who we are by your grace not by our Doctrine not by our church size but by your grace you have made us it is an unconditional promise we are the Covenant people not by works we must claim our god-given rights the Holy Ghost will continue the ministry of Jesus Christ until it brings him back from Heaven All hallelujah hallelujah that's good now the Holy Spirit must bring forth the same results brother R it must the the tree must bring forth the same fruit and Jesus is the same in every way but the Corporal body he is the same in power he is the same in blessing he is the same in Attitude he is a savior he was the savior then he's a savior now he was a Healer then he's a Healer now God still saves God still heals his motive is the same his action is the same his objection is the same his determination is the same his compassion is the same his forgiveness is the same thank you Father Hallelujah same character same person praise God same freedom from sin same forgiveness same peace same power same Assurance same Faith same Liberty same gospel Hallelujah this same Jesus that you saw go will come back in like manner how many believe that I go just a little further am amen it's amazing in Noah's day the Bible tells us that God made a covenant the days of Noah but the Covenant wasn't so much with Noah as the Covenant was to himself you find it in the scriptures in Genesis 9 verse 13 he says I do set my bow in the clouds and it shall be for a token between me and the Earth brother brandom said now it wasn't between he and Noah it was between him and the Earth and he said now that Covenant brought Noah life he said but God is actually making a covenant with himself that's right Hallelujah and he said now if we look closely he puts a rainbow in the for a sign for a token of the Covenant and he said but I want you to go back and brother Brandon brings us out to Genesis 8:20 if you'll pull that up in Genesis 8:20 this is why God put a bow in the cloud it says and Noah built an altar unto the Lord and He took every clean beast and every clean foul and offered a burnt offering on the altar next verse and the Lord smelled a sweet Savor and the Lord said in his heart I will not again curse the ground anymore for man's sake for the imagination of the heart is evil from his youth neither will I again Smite anymore any living every any everything living as I have done pull up that next verse and while the Earth uh let's just stop there brother bam said now this is why why the rainbow was put in the cloud is chapter 8 Noah offers a sacrifice and God smelled it God received it and because he accepted the sacrifice God gave a covenant rainbow a promise because he accepted the sacrifice brother Benham said in the Book of Revelation John saw rainbow all the way around the throne he said it was because Christ Our sacrifice and our covenant has been accepted and God everywhere he looks he sees the promise hallelujah hallelujah he said on Earth he said it's only a half of bow he said but in eternity the half has never been told he said it went around the throne what does that mean it means god is a covenant keeping God yeah yes he is when you need healing you need to approach him and say Lord You Are The Covenant keeping [Music] God hallelujah all right Hallelujah we know in the Old Testament the pillar of fire was the angel of the Lord how many know that it was Christ brother brandham calls him the angel of the Covenant and that angel took them into to the manifestation of the promise in Revelations chap 10 the mighty Angel comes down with a rainbow upon his head brother brandham said it could only be Christ and brother brandham said notice he then brother B said Revelations 10 this is Christ he said the pillar of fire he said the angel the mighty Angel is the Angel of the Covenant right that's right true Hallelujah and there was a rainbow upon his head which represents the Covenant keeping God thank you Jesus delivering us the Seed of Abraham a message how many remember 1962 just before the breaking of the seals brother Brenham speaks of five stars lining up in the heavens right and stay with me I'm I'm going to get back to my topic but I I feel a need to pour this in brother Brenham says this in 1962 he said five stars have lined up and he said I believe it has spiritual significance I think there's three four possibly five but I think four maybe four quotes on it and brother brandom said now in the first coming of the Lord he said three stars lined up which declared the infant Messiah upon the Earth and brother Brandon and I read it to you just I don't want to pull it out I don't want to say it wrong in any way brother random said the five stars that just fell in line with the world it's the number of Grace every time those stars come something happens upon the Earth and he said five stars I'm skipping down he said what's happened an infant Church a bride INF the power of God has begun to fall upon her and she is taking form a bride for a bridegroom the Church of the Living God is coming together under the word and the heaven is announcing her approach what is happening the church is coming forth God is going to have a church without spot wrinkle or blemish he said I believe the latterday signs and the things that are happening are peeling together to show Christ is ready to come for his bride his word is coming again making himself a manifested bride making for himself meaning that it will not stay Doctrine but God wants to live the Manifest ested word in school children in mothers in the kitchen in the church in the Sunday School room on Sunday on Wednesday in prayer meeting in Bible study God wants to manifest himself and he said it started right at the opening of those seals now brother brandom said now he said I've been to the pyramids in Egypt those stones are laid so perf perfectly together you can't take a razor blade hardly and go between them he said they fit perfectly and he said that's how they built the Sphinx and so forth he said now The Headstone is supposed to fit it's honed and if they ever could find The Headstone it'll fit just perfectly snug and bind the whole thing together that's the Bride of Jesus Christ when The Headstone come comes there will be a church to receive it a Ministry exactly like his brother R said when Jesus returns he will find a church washed without spot and wrinkle it will be the same Ministry I want you to think about this brother brandom in my opening statement Grace I won't hold you long every love the Lord Grace is as old as the world brother brandham said God gave Israel law but that was the people that was not God it was Grace that made the promise it was Grace that sent them a prophet it was Grace that sent the angel of the Covenant it was the grace of God that provided a lamb it was the power and the grace of God that led the children of Israel out of of Egypt everything was the grace of God how many believe that I want to read this quote before I change my direction here in communion 1962 brother bam speaks of it again he said I predict that this has a spiritual application speaking of the five stars he said I believe there's coming in the issue of God the great revelation of the word that is opened in this time remember they claim when those three stars came into orbit Jesus was born this is five this is the number of Grace and then he goes through Jes us and F AI the number of great he said now God if he ever sends his power to the church it'll be the grace of God he said Not The Obedience of the people and I want to say this because the devil will try to so corrupt Grace that you don't even want to preach it because you don't want the people to think that we just say there's no standards the word don't matter nothing matters go on Sarah sah God loves you yeah but if your faith is placed anywhere else but the grace of God you're in trouble it was the grace of God in Adam's life that's right it was the grace of God in Abra 's life it was the grace of God that bore with Israel for 40 years it was the grace of God to Saul the grace of God to Rahab the grace of God to Ruth the grace of God through the church ages and God constantly reaching constantly reaching it is the grace of God in your life brother the grace of God in your life sister it is the gift of God Amen brother Venom said if you have got the Holy Ghost and you're God's child you are Abraham's seed you have got the unconditional Covenant Written In Your Heart by the allmighty himself and he cannot take it back God's children unconditionally say unconditionally you don't deserve your healing tonight there's not one that deserves to hear the gospel there's not one here that deserves the grace of God we're all together it's God's grace that done it anyhow you don't deserve your healing everyone ought to die every one of us on this Earth we don't deserve to live he said but God promised it and God cannot lie healing belongs to us salvation belongs to us the Holy Ghost belongs to us Heaven belongs to us and now we are the sons of God it's not what you are or what you will ever be but it's what he is it's not that you are good it's God that is good hallelujah our faith must Rest In The Sovereign Grace of God how many say yeah Lord it is your grace that I am here it is your grace in a finished work at C when he died for every man in this place when he poured his blood for our healing it was for you brother it was for you brother it was for this whole congregation it was for the preacher it is The Sovereign Grace of God to us and all you got to do is accept it by faith I believe it I accept it I'll receive that Lord how many receive it and the message of Grace 1961 if you get a chance to go back and listen to it you'll hear these things brother ROM said now according to prophecy there will come forth a headstone and I want you to notice when The Headstone comes the prince is going to cry out the message Grace Grace for it's the grace that we are saved the message of Grace has been Trampled Under the feet of men till it has become disgrace some run outs on eternal security some run into every but the true message of Grace Hallelujah there's where Satan tries to knock it from the church but it's the grace of God that we are saved by brother brandom said the deity of Jesus Jes Christ has come to confirm this Truth by his word he confirms it by signs and wonders he said then this Grace must be true too Hallelujah the coming of the Angel of the Covenant was to vindicate that salvation is for you and when the devil gets in your mind and tells you it is not for you you need to step up and say the grace of God says yes when he said you don't have Faith to be healed you can say but the grace of God says I can let the weak say they are strong Hallelujah I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me we can have a Revival we can have our loved ones we can have the power of God moving Among Us God can bring them back Grace is one of the Mysteries that was revealed under the opening of the seals now not disgrace but a true grace of God that'll give you Foundation under your feet it'll give you a place to stand when you do fall God is your defense God is your shelter get back up brother get back up Sister the grace of God is enough for you it's God's grace that holds us what do I do brother take his word into your heart and you hold on and don't you let the devil take it away from you Hallelujah brother renom said I believe in the grace of God I believe there's going to be a church in the last days without spot without wrinkle without blemish I believe that's eternally secure before God and there will be a church if you believe that say amen he said I don't know who will be in it I don't know I trust I will be I trust you will be I only live by faith but I believe there is a church on the way for those that are born [Music] again the devil loves legalism especially among our ranks you see that men and women they begin to live by those Works brother random said that's the legalistic part of your walk he said that's why Ruth working was the legalistic part of her work she's working for her salvation and that's a part of the Bible every man working out his own salvation with fear and trembling but what happens if we stay there we are not recipients and possessors of the promise that was given and so we cannot stop in legalism my dress is just right my hair is just right and then we justify ourselves by measuring ourselves by ourselves and you'll find the devil will always try to kick a man down to lift him up that's what the that's what the the Arrogant priest did in the temple he said Lord I thank you I'm not like this Publican but the Bible said that that man was just as sinful as the Publican but the Publican was more righteous because he was beating on his chest Lord I Need Your Grace I don't want to be that arrogant man that's got all the hair right and the and the dress right and the doctrine right I want the grace of almighty God I need the grace you need the grace of God and that ain't just some cheap passport so I can watch TV and live like a devil the grace of God gives me the power to be an overcomer gives me the power to receive my healing gives me the power to be a Victor it is the grace of God that'll raise you from the dead it is the grace of God that reveals to you you this word and it is the grace of God that'll take you home how many love his grace let's stand to our feet let's thank the Lord Lord thank you for your grace thank you Lord it comes from you the only place Grace can come I pray Lord Jesus Holy Spirit move Among Us now if there are people that are Holding On by works Lord open their eyes and set them free right now break every Power of legalism break every Power and stronghold of the enemy that binds the people May the grace of God the Holy Spirit visit us this morning and Lord not Lord not in in just a shallow way but Lord down into the depths of our souls May the spirit of God visit us may Revelation begin to break it's like the great Fountains of the deep from the

Faith Lord Lord if we look at ourselves we'll never win help us to turn our eyes to your grace [Applause] now you said the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it I ask in jesus' name you visit us

God has certainly been gracious to speak this word to us this morning for our church here the last few months I don't know if anybody's noticed the themes of Grace and letting go of other things and embracing his grace and the power of His grace it's just been the Lord keeps saying it to us over and over again and I I do believe the bride is entering into deeper dimensions and understandings of just how Limitless this grace and love is I re believe he's entering into that and all all the subjects of been along those lines even when I speak a series on the Holy Ghost the main theme through it has been he does the work he calls the heart you can't repent without him moving upon you first but I tell you if he's moving upon you you should repent you should come to the Lord because there's millions of people may not feel that but if you're feeling it this morning you ought to act upon it and this is how powerful it is that other part saying I believe it I believe it I Lord I'm asking for it cuz he did say in the Bible he'll give the Holy Ghost to them that ask so even though he's moving on your heart he wants you to ask you want to be healed he wants you to ask and Lord this is your promise it's for me whatever it is this morning and I'm so glad I wanted to say this I I have so many notes here it's tremendous what was said but it makes me love the Lord Jesus so much more in his Covenant with us and let me say this I'm so so glad that God doesn't have Alzheimer's or [Music] dementia cuz every time there's something like Abraham that he's making a mistake he's getting ready to looks like he's going to mess up everything and every time Israel was the place that God even was saying sometimes I'll just wipe out the whole thing then somehow in the memories of God he comes back and he said I remembered my promise I got to come back to my promise I made I'm so glad he don't forget that promise he made over our lives and in our mistakes he goes back to it but but but this is what I promise God's people I'm coming back to it and the only memories that God cannot remember is one that we repent and is washed in the blood of the Lamb amen it's not in the back of his men it's not to pull up anywhere the Bible says that's been completely taken out and washed in the sea of forgetfulness he can't remember your sin anymore but oh I'm glad he remembers his promise to me can you say praise the Lord prise what a what a wonderful wonderful message praise the Lord so brother Malachi if you'd come forward uh they want to us to pray brother Craig brother Brandon if you come and lay hands on this for and you just give us a updated report of brother Bob's of your sister's your nephew here M um I don't have my my phone with me uh just my sister uh took him to the

yeah it's good to have you with us visiting and then we know why you're in town it's not because of us sister sister tabi is pastor Pastor due date now so how me be praying for her this week amen bring a healthy baby we're looking for it here she is all the way up here away from her hospital I can tell you I've preached some babies right some others right into labor may it happen pulls up them right out hallelujah amen God is good you know for Saints uh if God has this much grace and we are recipients of recipients then what the Lord's teaching me is that that has to flow through us to others can you say amen and if God gives us Limitless and unconditional Covenant if that's flowing through us then that should be flowing through us to other people as well we don't justify sin but I'll tell you one thing we I I I believe that when we when we put limitations because it's it's really it's denominations that have put limitations through 2,000 years on the grace of God when you come to the word for the last days the final word is for God to show salvation is a gift of God and it's the grace of God it's a message of Grace how in the world the de did the devil take this glorious message and turn it into works and turn it into legalism how did that happen it's the devil work to do that but the final message is it's a Capstone of Grace that comes down on this bride and flows through us and whenever whenever we limit that uh I believe if we're an extension of Grace if I'm not an extension of his grace then I become a on- man denomination [Music] myself it's them that has put that systems that's put a limitation on the grace and made it works again we should never do that in this message we should know that if his grace has saved us and forgave us and brought us to this place and it's Grace that saved us are you listening and it's Grace that'll take us to the end God doesn't start it with Grace and now all of a sudden we got to get it all together our works he started it with Grace he's going to end it with Grace and I think we should make have that flowing through us to others as well remember that we sang that song he looked beyond my fault he called it up today and I've been thinking this week if God looked at me that way and he could his grace could look beyond my faults and my mistakes cuz I still make him even to today if he's got the power to look beyond my fault and see my need why can't we look Beyond people's faults and see their need because for a child of God behind every bad thing we see in the front on the surface there's something laying there that's a need and needs God so we should look beyond their faults and pray for their need Hallelujah did I say we're going to sing it again see I forgot that I'm glad God doesn't forget me amen and forget his Covenant I remember my Covenant with my people one more time before we're dis you can be dismissed As we sing it this morning who report will you believe oh we shall believe the
