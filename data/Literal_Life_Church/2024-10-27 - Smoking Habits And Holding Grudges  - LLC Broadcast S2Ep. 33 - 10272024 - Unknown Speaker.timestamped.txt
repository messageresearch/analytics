[5:16] alone my joy was
[5:23] found Lord You Are My
[5:26] Joy my joy
[5:31] Lord You Are My
[5:33] [Music]
[5:38] Joy Lord you
[5:44] arey Leviticus 19 and verse 17 and 18 if
[5:49] you read with me Thou shalt not hate thy
[5:53] brother in thine heart can you say Amen
[5:57] am Thou shalt not hate thy brother in
[5:59] thine heart where in thine heart Thou
[6:01] shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor
[6:04] and suffer and not suffer sin upon Him
[6:09] Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any
[6:11] grudge against the children of thy
[6:13] people but Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[6:16] as thyself I am the Lord there's another
[6:19] scripture in Proverbs 19 I will add to
[6:22] this Proverbs 19 and verse
[6:24] 11 the discretion of a man deferreth his
[6:28] anger and it is his glory to pass over a
[6:34] transgression I want you to notice here
[6:37] now we we have uh we have our
[6:39] interpretation of what the glory of the
[6:41] Lord is and I believe we're experiencing
[6:44] the glory of the Lord in this place this
[6:46] morning I believe the glory of the Lord
[6:48] can do many things to let us know his
[6:51] presence is here but let us not limit
[6:53] the glory of the Lord because this man
[6:55] when he when he defers his anger and
[6:59] when he passes over a transgression then
[7:03] there's a glory in that as well don't
[7:06] limit the glory of God so when this man
[7:09] forgives this when when this man
[7:11] releases and he passes over a
[7:14] transgression and he lets that anger
[7:16] flow away from his heart and his heart
[7:19] is clear there is a glory of God in that
[7:23] there's a glory of God in that so this
[7:25] morning I I'd like to speak a little bit
[7:27] on and this is a strange title smoking
[7:30] habits and holding grudges but in the
[7:32] proverb that we read it speaks of a
[7:34] glory of a on a man that is the power of
[7:36] forgiveness he he overlooks a matter he
[7:39] releases a matter he defers his anger
[7:42] towards someone when he does that
[7:44] there's a glory of the Lord that's in
[7:46] that there's a power we know there's
[7:48] glory in saying to this mountain but
[7:50] there's a glory in the Lord when you
[7:52] forgive from your
[7:54] heart we may not see the results of that
[7:58] but nevertheless the glory is in a man
[8:01] who defers his anger and overlooks the
[8:03] transgression
[8:05] Hallelujah ah praise the Lord I want
[8:07] that kind of glory and so when we come
[8:09] into that truly it is it is of god this
[8:13] glory is of God and it sets us up into a
[8:16] freedom in us that empties us out
[8:20] empties us out and makes more room for
[8:24] more of his
[8:27] glory can I say it again yes what is why
[8:30] is he teaching on forgiveness because it
[8:33] empties us out of things that are
[8:35] shadows in our
[8:37] hearts so it empties us out so that more
[8:41] of his glory can work in our vessel I
[8:45] want to remind you all that the power of
[8:47] Calvary was released to us when he died
[8:51] the full power of redemption was
[8:54] released to us when he died can you say
[8:56] amen he said when he died the whole
[8:59] Earth Earth shook it was such an
[9:01] incident and Redemption was finished for
[9:03] Sons and Daughters of God and it pulled
[9:06] Sons and Daughters of God not only Jesus
[9:08] but other sons that had died in him it
[9:11] pulled them into the power of
[9:12] Resurrection when Jesus died it
[9:15] triggered a resurrection and the Saints
[9:17] come out of the Grave when he cried from
[9:20] the cross and says it is finished it was
[9:23] completely finished and now not only him
[9:26] but Sons could enter into Resurrection
[9:31] power and so that was the power of
[9:33] Resurrection but moments before the
[9:36] resurrection power came before these are
[9:40] the words that came from Jesus as he
[9:42] looked at those that were shaming him
[9:45] gossiping at him falsely accusing him
[9:48] beating him scoring him gossiping
[9:51] against him embarrassing him he looked
[9:54] at those people and he said father
[9:56] forgive them
[10:04] for they don't know what they're
[10:06] doing they're doing this but they don't
[10:08] know what they're doing and so he
[10:10] released a
[10:12] forgiveness the power of forgiveness was
[10:14] released to them and none of those
[10:16] people even deserved it can I get an
[10:17] amen this morning they didn't deserve
[10:20] getting any forgiveness but I'm here to
[10:22] say the power of forgiveness was
[10:24] released before the P other powers and
[10:27] the power of Resurrection came
[10:30] there was something that was released in
[10:32] him to say I forgive you forgive them
[10:35] Father they don't know what they're
[10:36] doing forgiveness and the power of
[10:38] forgiveness was released before the
[10:40] power of Resurrection was
[10:43] released maybe that's why Jesus put it
[10:45] in Mark chap 11 maybe we shouldn't look
[10:48] down so much and try to hide things but
[10:51] to say Lord I really need to release all
[10:55] of my ought in my heart
[10:59] against those who've done me
[11:02] wrong if we're really serious about more
[11:05] faith if we're really serious about
[11:07] walking in the precepts where the bride
[11:09] should be walking if we're going to
[11:11] preach it and we're going to say Amen to
[11:13] that then we have to say Amen to say God
[11:16] change my heart soften my heart that I
[11:19] can release this forgiveness in me and
[11:22] release this ought in me and forgive
[11:24] those who have done me wrong you may be
[11:26] there this morning and I say praise God
[11:29] you're further along than a lot of the
[11:31] rest of us God bless you brother Paul I
[11:33] don't have any odd against it I'm a free
[11:35] person people have done me wrong I've
[11:37] released it like the maturity of Joseph
[11:38] to say what they did in evil God has
[11:41] turned it to my good that's the only way
[11:43] I'm going to look at it that's my
[11:45] predestinated trials every evil that's
[11:48] been done to me every gossip it's turned
[11:50] to my good God bless
[11:53] you but for those of the rest of us who
[11:57] have things come along that that you
[11:59] hold
[12:01] there I pray that you could leave this
[12:04] morning with it released but when we
[12:06] leave I pray that we would leave because
[12:08] Jesus released the power and the height
[12:10] of forgiveness was released and all the
[12:12] other power was released after
[12:14] Resurrection all power in fact he said
[12:16] the words in Matthew
[12:17] 2818 all power is given unto me in
[12:20] heaven and earth full Authority was
[12:23] given when full forgiveness was given I
[12:27] don't know if you've ever heard this
[12:28] before you have but I want to emphasize
[12:30] it over and over again that with Jesus
[12:33] the full and complete Authority was
[12:36] released until he said all power is
[12:38] given to me in heaven and earth the full
[12:42] power was released and Authority when
[12:44] all forgiveness was released
[12:49] amen Peter's Last Words excuse me step's
[12:52] last words as he was
[12:54] stoned while he was being stoned lay not
[12:57] this sin to their charge
[13:00] and he left with the heavens opened up
[13:02] to
[13:03] him the glory of the Lord opened up to
[13:05] him are you listening this morning while
[13:08] they were stoning him Stephen said Lord
[13:11] don't lay this sin to their
[13:15] charge so why my title that says smoking
[13:18] habits and holding grudges this is it
[13:20] from a quote smoking habits and holding
[13:23] grudges I want to talk about grudges
[13:24] holding grudges there's much to say
[13:27] about it and then this this particular
[13:29] prayer line it stuck out to me he said
[13:32] uh brother B says in 1957 while you're
[13:35] praying shed in with God there was those
[13:37] who raised their hands they they that
[13:40] wanted a walk with God wanted to open
[13:42] their hearts to him the altar is open
[13:44] now my friend I'd invite each one of you
[13:47] to come here at the altar and kneel down
[13:50] and say Lord Jesus be merciful I want
[13:53] you to come into my heart move all my
[13:55] fears move all my selfishness move
[13:57] everything out and come in come into my
[14:00] heart and be Lord oh I believe you're my
[14:03] savior but you haven't been my Lord how
[14:06] many know there's a
[14:08] difference there's a difference in just
[14:10] being Savior and being Lord that means
[14:13] he takes up housekeeping and takes
[14:15] control of this vessel that means if
[14:18] there's something that's odd something
[14:19] that's wrong it has to be released for
[14:22] him to fully set up housekeeping I don't
[14:24] just want him to be my savior I want him
[14:26] to be my
[14:27] Lord now look at this is just a small
[14:30] statement and now this is the
[14:31] discernment he looks at this brother and
[14:34] and if you read the messages you see the
[14:36] discernment uh when that came came on
[14:38] him and he knew those things it was
[14:41] accurate he could see their life he
[14:42] could see the doctor talking he could
[14:44] tell their name he could do their house
[14:45] number their street number and and
[14:47] brother brandom did not know that but
[14:49] God knows it tells us God knows all
[14:51] things about us he knows your house
[14:53] number he knows the trial your family's
[14:55] going through he's completely aware
[14:57] probably more than you are of your
[14:58] problem
[14:59] problems and he proved this by that son
[15:03] of man gift working through a vessel
[15:05] like brother brandham God bless you
[15:07] brother this man's name is Davis he
[15:11] comes from
[15:13] Virginia he's here to give up a habit of
[15:17] smoking and a little Grudge that he's
[15:20] held in his heart against a loved one
[15:23] since he was a
[15:27] child and when I read that I thought oh
[15:29] my there's my
[15:31] sermon that's what he's at the altar for
[15:35] this morning this is things we come to
[15:38] the Altar
[15:40] for now first of all I don't really have
[15:43] to preach against
[15:45] smoking at least I hope I don't have to
[15:48] if you've got that filthy Habit in your
[15:50] life and it's been proved over and over
[15:53] again for many many years of the damages
[15:56] to your body and this is what you find
[15:59] with smoking addicts is that they're
[16:01] doing that I think when we come to
[16:03] smoking there's no benefit to it and yet
[16:05] people are so uh pretend they're so
[16:09] addicted that they'll actually know that
[16:11] it causes damage my grandpa and grandma
[16:14] Le Fontaine died of lung cancer and Up
[16:16] Until the End she's smoking those just
[16:18] smoking smoking smoking and she kns
[16:20] knows what it's going to do other family
[16:21] members died how can a person know that
[16:24] and do it that's how much an addiction
[16:26] can take
[16:27] you and that that's how much a person
[16:30] can hold tightly on to
[16:34] something even if it's doing them
[16:41] damage so my question to you is if that
[16:43] can happen with a smoking habit which
[16:45] everybody knows then this other thing
[16:48] that this man come to the Altar for and
[16:51] I don't even know if he knew about the
[16:53] other thing this is Brother Brown
[16:54] Discerning this is what you're at the
[16:56] altar for I think the other part was
[16:59] hidden since he was a child that he was
[17:02] holding a grudge he might not have even
[17:04] known but I want to make the point
[17:06] whether it's being released of a habit
[17:08] of smoking or whether it's being
[17:10] released of a grudge it's the same thing
[17:13] it's still something that holds on to a
[17:16] person and this brother it was his whole
[17:21] life what was it some no a grudge
[17:25] against a family member we don't know
[17:28] what it was
[17:29] but it was a a grudge and he's at the
[17:32] altar to pray this is his need this is
[17:35] his name this is where he's from and
[17:37] he's got two things and to us it looks
[17:39] like two very separate things that's why
[17:43] I've said before recently in the past is
[17:46] that we have healing lines and and and
[17:50] prayer lines for deliverance of demons
[17:53] and deliverance of
[17:56] diseases if this is true where's the
[17:59] prayer lines to pray for
[18:07] grudges praise the
[18:09] Lord because here to me I don't see it
[18:13] too much as being two things that were
[18:16] holding this man holding him down
[18:18] holding his heart against a loved one
[18:21] and they're both things that binding him
[18:23] and both things he needed to be
[18:24] delivered from can you say amen he is at
[18:27] the altar for a smoking hat Abit and a
[18:29] grudge and I guess he needed freedom
[18:32] from both it was all the way since he
[18:35] was a child that he held a grudge how
[18:39] long can a person hold a
[18:42] grudge how long can a person hold a
[18:47] grudge he wants us to forgive and
[18:49] release grudges why they are bad and I
[18:54] want to safely say this morning they're
[18:56] just as bad as smoking smoking is bad
[18:58] bad right we all agree all the young
[19:01] people everybody smoking is bad both are
[19:04] dangerous smoking has years of research
[19:06] showing cancer and other things coming
[19:08] from it and yet someone when they hold
[19:10] on to a habit when they hold on to that
[19:12] they think it's not doing that much
[19:14] damage but over time it's doing damage
[19:17] people know the re the research and
[19:19] still hold on to it but is the same with
[19:23] a grudge against someone it has terrible
[19:26] damage as well that's why they hold on
[19:29] Lord deliver me from this nicotine
[19:32] Spirit sometimes they will say but
[19:34] nothing in their unforgiving spirit that
[19:36] they've had in a grudge for
[19:42] years in the science science says
[19:46] forgiveness reduces stress and improves
[19:48] Health holding on to grudges causes and
[19:51] I you know you can look at this yourself
[19:53] I don't want to read a lot of science or
[19:55] the psychology about about it but
[19:57] holding on to grudges this is clearly
[19:59] science now this is not uh any from any
[20:01] Christian Source holding on to grudges
[20:03] causes chronic stress which harms your
[20:06] health and well-being forgiving others
[20:09] lowers stress hormones like cortisol
[20:11] decreases blood pressure and leads to a
[20:14] stronger immune system it also lowers
[20:16] the risk of depression and anxiety
[20:19] studies show forgiveness even slows
[20:21] aging and increases
[20:23] longevity boy do I ever need to
[20:27] forgive cuz I want to live a little
[20:30] longer so you know this is science and
[20:32] you know what if you think that these
[20:34] inward heart things don't affect you
[20:36] physically go through the prayer lines
[20:38] and find out as he would say you can be
[20:40] healed of this but the real core problem
[20:42] was this thing and it wasn't a physical
[20:44] problem it became a physical why does
[20:46] the Bible say say laughter doeth good
[20:48] like a
[20:51] medicine if you're happy and you're free
[20:54] and you're laughing there is a medicine
[20:56] even for your own physical body and then
[20:58] it says when you forgive science says it
[21:02] leads to changes in your brain that
[21:04] improve your ability to regulate
[21:07] emotions and
[21:08] reactions activity in the AM magdala
[21:11] which I hope I'm saying that right
[21:12] magdala which processes fear and anger
[21:15] decreases areas linked to empathy
[21:19] positive feelings and emotional control
[21:23] become more active what when we forgive
[21:29] this rewiring makes you less reactive
[21:33] and more compassionate over time this
[21:36] rewiring how many want to be rewired
[21:39] this
[21:40] morning not by psychology but by the
[21:43] Holy Ghost
[21:45] happiness the kingdom of God is Not meat
[21:48] and drink the kingdom of God is not just
[21:50] a dress code but it's righteousness and
[21:53] peace and joy in the Holy Ghost that's
[21:57] what the Bible says
[21:59] this life is a life and it should be of
[22:01] joy in the Holy Ghost on Monday on
[22:04] Tuesday why aren't you enjoying the joy
[22:07] of the Holy
[22:11] Ghost but beyond that what we're
[22:14] preaching on this morning it's a
[22:15] hindrance to Mountain Moving Faith how
[22:17] many want Mountain Moving Faith this
[22:20] this lack of forgiveness is a hindrance
[22:23] to Mountain Moving faith it is a hidden
[22:25] stronghold that Limits The Authority and
[22:28] the confidence of the
[22:30] believer forgiveness the power of
[22:34] it Martin Luther says if you guys could
[22:37] pull that up again Martin Luther says
[22:39] and and just for those who are watching
[22:41] there were seven angels in Revelations
[22:44] these were seven Messengers to the seven
[22:46] Church ages all seven had a portion of
[22:49] Truth all seven believed closer to the
[22:52] original word Paul preached than all the
[22:54] rest of them there's seven angels in
[22:55] God's right hand sometimes we quote from
[22:58] them we we quote a lot from the last one
[22:59] the seventh because he's the most recent
[23:01] one to us but all those these Messengers
[23:04] you'll find Harmony between them Luther
[23:06] says for just as we sin greatly against
[23:08] God every day if you don't think that's
[23:11] right then you can go to the message and
[23:14] find that we we sin every
[23:19] day now that's not to give you a license
[23:21] this
[23:22] week if it gives you a license say oh
[23:25] man we sin every day now I'm going to go
[23:27] do stuff you got the wrong thing in your
[23:28] heart but humility says I said every day
[23:32] brother Brown said he made mistakes
[23:34] that's why we need the blood that's why
[23:36] we need to forgiveness of sin so for
[23:38] justice we greatly sin against God every
[23:40] day and yet he forgives it all through
[23:43] Grace so we also must always forgive our
[23:47] neighbor who does US harm violence and
[23:51] Injustice Bears malice against us Etc we
[23:55] it's linked together the Forgiveness of
[23:58] God and the Forgiveness of others is
[24:01] linked
[24:04] together now the commentaries they they
[24:07] really especially when they're really on
[24:09] the justification side because when you
[24:12] go they want to run to Romans and
[24:14] different places to talk about what
[24:16] justification is there's nothing hinging
[24:18] in our actions on the on the
[24:20] justification of God we're justified by
[24:23] faith nothing attached to it so the
[24:25] scripture Jesus said if you don't
[24:27] forgive neither does your father in
[24:29] Heaven forgive you it looks like it
[24:31] jeopardizes that justification but it
[24:33] doesn't in the eyes of God a Son of God
[24:36] when they're dipped in the in the blood
[24:38] of Jesus Christ as far as in the eyes of
[24:40] God they're Justified just as if they
[24:43] ever never did that's the standing with
[24:45] God but on an everyday basis if we hold
[24:48] a grudge and don't forgive then God has
[24:51] to forgive us also on an everyday basis
[24:54] and it can limit that
[24:58] in other words you can't say I'm holding
[25:00] on to this Grudge I can't I can't let it
[25:03] go I can't let it go well then God just
[25:05] looks at that and says you're limited
[25:09] yes it's not that God doesn't justify
[25:12] You by his blood as the Son of God but
[25:14] it's that on an everyday basis yes if
[25:18] you're going to live a life of an
[25:19] unforgiving Spirit towards people then
[25:22] it's going to limit the authority you
[25:24] have as a
[25:26] Believer your prayer prayers will be
[25:29] hindered how many knows your prayers can
[25:31] be hindered and that's what I'm
[25:32] preaching about I don't want my prayers
[25:34] hindered anymore I want the prayer of
[25:36] faith I want when I pray for somebody
[25:39] there's
[25:42] results how how long it takes is up to
[25:45] God but I want to I want my prayer to
[25:47] pierce Heaven Can you say amen and get
[25:49] results that's it should be the desire
[25:51] number one desire of every believer but
[25:53] you see now Paul talks about if we don't
[25:56] treat our wives like a CO Heir in the
[25:59] Kingdom in a vessel she's the weaker
[26:01] vessel but is a daughter of God she's
[26:03] co-s with you now I realize when I'm
[26:05] saying that I'm cross some some culture
[26:07] sometimes they still look at the woman
[26:09] down here and the man up here that's not
[26:11] what the Bible says in a vessel she's
[26:13] the weaker vessel but as coars with you
[26:15] in a marriage you are together in that
[26:18] co-s together equal because Adam and Eve
[26:22] were equal in the garden
[26:24] amen that's right amen and we're coming
[26:27] back to that that's why a man should
[26:29] treat his white and Paul said you better
[26:30] treat her white as a daughter of God or
[26:32] your prayers will be
[26:34] hindered so if there's other things that
[26:36] can hinder a prayer then we look at a
[26:39] lack of forgiveness that can hinder not
[26:41] only Luther said it but also I believe
[26:44] we have one from John Wesley another
[26:45] messenger in God's right hand God
[26:48] forgives us as we forgive others so that
[26:50] if any malice or bitterness if any taint
[26:53] of unkindness or anger remains if we do
[26:56] not clearly fully and from the heart
[26:58] heart forgive all men their trespasses
[27:00] we far cut short the Forgiveness of our
[27:03] own God cannot clearly and fully forgive
[27:06] us he may show us some degree of Mercy
[27:09] but we will not suffer him to blot out
[27:12] all our sins and forgive all of our
[27:15] iniquities that's a pretty straight
[27:17] preacher under the sanctification uh
[27:20] restoration movement or reforming
[27:22] movement sanctification clean your life
[27:24] make your out holy he's pretty straight
[27:26] about it he will not suffer to BL our
[27:28] sins and forgive all our iniquities
[27:30] that's pretty straight you got armenis
[27:32] and Calvinism both coming on the cross
[27:34] but they're saying the same thing and
[27:36] that is you cannot ignore an unforgiving
[27:40] spirit and come into the Forgiveness of
[27:43] God and fully and come into Faith an
[27:46] unforgiving Christian is an oxymoron
[27:48] failure to forgive is a result of either
[27:52] failure to accept or appreciate the
[27:55] Forgiveness that we have received
[27:58] there's something that you haven't come
[27:59] to the full forgiveness and the
[28:02] realization of how much God has forgiven
