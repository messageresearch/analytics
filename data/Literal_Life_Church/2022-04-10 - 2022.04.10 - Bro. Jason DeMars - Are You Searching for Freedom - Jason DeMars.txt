========================================

so thankful to see the gifts in people's lives and people operating them and just appreciate the singers and musicians and the people in the booth back there appreciate you two you make everybody sound good everybody look good the people on video are as good as they can look i guess you kind of got what you're working with but praise the lord so i just wanted to give just a real brief missions update and uh a little testimony so this is the church that i've been working with in uh cairo egypt and we've been working with them for a few years they're doing a lot of outreach this is at one of the meetings we had and invited a lot of pentecostal people there to come to the services and saw real good results the lord moved mightily we're working on translating we're finished translating the supernatural series and they're handing those out to to people throughout the country and working on getting him into christian libraries there also and uh go to the next screen you see there i'm on the the one side i'm in front of the great pyramid with brother megaly he's the pastor that i'm working with there and uh just remember them in prayer the lord is really really working and establishing the message and in his heart and in the heart of the church there and he and his son are working on translating sermons of brother branham now that we finished the supernatural series the church ages book is done in arabic and so little by little we're kind of getting that seed library done for for the outreach that we're doing and helping people getting established in the word the other one is a testimony this this man there his wife for the last three years every time we had a prayer line she would come forward and her prayer was always from i want you to pray for my husband and it's been it's been difficult for her she's been sometimes prevented from coming to meetings and he's not wanted to be a committed christian and so she's always saying please pray for my husband i need him to get saved i need him to get saved well it was a supernatural that he even came to this meeting i think because of covet he was ready for trying anything and so he came to the meetings and she came forward for prayer again and i said oh it's a sister again i'm sure she's gonna ask for her husband i didn't know he was there and she said my husband wants to receive christ i said whoa what what where is he then bring him here so he came forward and we prayed with him and he received christ and uh just both she's so joyful so happy children were so happy so we thank the lord for that amen amen and so keep them in prayer we're working with them trying to find a way to get them a building they're currently renting in a islamic neighborhood and it's not very safe we'd like to get them into a little bit better area a better better ability to do outreach you see in egypt if a muslim converts to christianity it's immediate death sentence not from the government at all it's from the family typically what happens is they'll the person converts they kill them next they go to the person that the evangelist that brought them and they'll kill them in the past the government has turned a blind eye to that i'm not sure that they would do that anymore things are changing and proving for christians there but pray for them it's a tough situation and if you go to the next screen brother paul was mentioning my testimony i'm going to talk more about it later but it is a miracle that i'm here today go to the next screen uh this is a brother in our church who's a physician his assistant in the hospital where i was at and uh i'll just say the lord used him to save my life and so god did some supernatural things it wasn't just just that it was supernatural that he worked at the place that i was at but there's much more to tell about that if you want to continue to go to the next one that's my family they all send their greetings we wish they could come but it's kind of a last minute thing and so next time we come lord willing we'll all come together so praise the lord go to the next screen let's let's all stand up we're going to go to the word my subject for this morning is are you searching for freedom amen god puts it into our heart to search for freedom to look for freedom it's it's in that it's in the heart of every person that breathes to search and define and try to find freedom scripture i want to start with is genesis 3 1-5 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die and i'm going to do this from the esb for god knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and evil amen may the lord have the blessing of the reading of his word you can be seated so the first attack of the enemy against the human race the human race was designed to be in the image and likeness of god in other words we are to be the expression of the invisible god so whether you're looking at adam and eve you weren't just looking at humanity you were looking at god and so the reason why i brought this that last verse in the ef esv is um it says in the king james version you'll be like gods but it's the same word as it's used in other places it's the word elohim for elohim knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like elohim knowing good and evil okay so this is satan's trap it's satan's trap what is a satan's trap he's offering them something that they actually already have he's he's saying you know what i've got something that's better for you if if they would have been thinking right if eve would have been thinking right said wait a minute i know that i'm already made in the image and likeness of god what do you mean i'm going to be like god knowing good and evil i can't get more like god but satan's offer is god is withholding something from you i will give it to you that's what the devil does today it's the same tactic what is he offering he's offering self-autonomy self-determination you can choose what you want to do you can be free that's what satan wants us to think you can be free god's withholding things from you he's withholding fun and good times and happiness and and all these things that you could feel so fulfilled with god's holy holding you back god's making your life miserable and so i what i'm gonna what the devil wants to do is say here here's something you can follow after the desires of your flesh you can fulfill the wildest dreams that are in your heart and it starts with a that's that's the flawed way of thinking that the devil is doing he's actually offering you what you already have with god okay he's offering the eve something she already has but he's saying you know god's holding something back from you and i'll give it to you you can make your own self-determination of your will you can be free from this terrible burden that god is laying on you that's what the devil is telling eve god god is he's unjust and and he's he's just mean-spirited he wants to control you and manipulate you that's what the devil is telling people today but the fact is the offer of self-autonomy doesn't exist the truth is there is no such thing as self-autonomy it's a myth it's a lie we have of course we have free will i understand that we have free will we can choose to be governed by god or we can choose to be governed by the devil there's not an in between the devil says there is an in-between i will offer you no there's not god doesn't deceive you god doesn't tell you you can just choose to he he doesn't say freedom is just doing whatever you want to do because he's telling you the truth there's no such thing as that you're either you're either a servant of the lord or you're a servant of the devil that that point is important because if you think there's a middle ground you'll try to choose that middle ground i can be free i'm more enlightened than everyone else i'll be able to overcome both god and the devil it's it's an insanity of this age you're not going to overcome god you're not going to overcome the devil god's god god declares it clearly you're either in bondage to sin or you're in bondage to righteousness and holiness and you know the world has come to this place where you you see in in common cultures i'd rather be a free person and go to hell if people think that way it's in it's in rap music it's in it's in rock and roll lyrics i'd rather be free and go to hell than be under the bondage of god and go to heaven incredible but that's the way the world thinks the problem is is they they miss the in between part they miss the in-between part they miss the in-between part and that's that they're you don't want that it isn't a happy life choosing the devil's way you it's a it's a short-term way of thinking i will i will take the way my flesh wants to go right now i'll go after my own heart my own desires which will lead to short-term pleasure long-term misery both in this life and the life to come choosing god's way god says you're going to suffer for a little while with joy with joy right now while you're suffering there'll be joy that's scriptural and then in the life to come there'll be peace but there's the thing is there's purpose if we have this idea young people that heaven you're going and it's just an eternal church service that's not what that's not what it is because you're you get sleepy and the preacher speaks too long and you feel like it's it's boring it's not boring once you get the spirit of god that's what your your week by week saying i can't wait i can't wait but there's purpose there's a life that god promises that's so incredible i mean you're going to go to a body that can pass through a wall you're going to be able to go just travel by thought from one place to another you're going to have you're going to have your you can speak the word and have control of nature so these these things when the the life that we're going to it's not a boring life it's the most exciting life in the millennium we're ruling over the nations do you want to do you want to be a king do you want you want to be a high level governor well jesus christ is offering you that opportunity but for now you have to sacrifice something that's the desires of the flesh you have to say i'm laying that aside i'm i'm looking to god and i know that this is going to bring short-term suffering because the bible says the glory that the the the suffering that we're going through now is not even worthy to be compared to the glory that'll be that will be revealed in us so it's it's a momentary light affliction the apostle paul says the suffering that we go through as christians it's momentary and it's light but the but the glory that we're that's being prepared for us is weighty and it's eternal the other choice that the devil offers is pleasure for a little while here momentary i lived in i lived in sin i didn't grow up in the message i lived in a sinful lifestyle i know i know what a party is and a little marijuana is it's a moment of enjoyment and it's a week of misery and then it's a moment of enjoyment and a week of misery why do we want to live that way when we can have joy no matter what our circumstances when we can have peace no matter what our circumstances every time i was done with this moment of pleasure thought what am i choosing why am i choosing this because i had a i grew up in a christian home i knew i was choosing the wrong things i knew i was choosing the wrong things and i wanted a change but i couldn't change myself and that's that's what we come up against young people is that you're surrounded in this church by the christian life but that doesn't mean you have the christian life yet and the best influence you can have as a young person around you is the christian life but but to try to live the christian life without the power of the holy ghost dwelling inside of you is an impossibility and so what's happening is satan is offering you two things all right satan is offering you one thing god is offering you another thing and what satan is offering you seems nice seems okay don't don't submit yourself to the way your parents want you to live don't submit yourself the way your church is behaving i'll show you you can be more enlightened than everybody else you can have a better understanding your life can be better than what those people are living well okay what what's what's the end of that what's the next step that's only that's your only focus your only focus is on one little thing of pleasure that mom and dad are not letting you do or the church the preacher saying don't do that and you're focused on this one little thing but you're not thinking long term you're thinking just this only thing so then you get then you say okay i'm going to get that thing and then you go i got that thing it doesn't actually feel very good but what do i do now what do i do now pride will come next pride will come next and say well i can't go backwards i can't go back and it'll push you further out of the way from god and that's a huge danger today because pro pride is the root of all sin pride made the devil the devil pride brought the fall in the beginning this was uh something better was offered to eve and she took it it wasn't better she found out it was it was horrifyingly bad so we live in a world that says that it's self-governing the united states governs its own country russia china all these countries they believe they're governing themselves okay so let's just say maybe that's true satan offers that has offered that to the world and the world is governing itself not knowing that there's spirits and things behind all of that controlling that but in their eyes they're governing themselves so young people people struggling what's the fruits of a world that's governing itself does anybody think it's a good fruit does the most liberal-minded person in the world think oh the world is just going great i just love it it's perfect it's peaceful it's fantastic no everybody wants change the right wing wants change the left lane everybody wants change why because governing self-government is the government of the devil it's satan's control and so the same thing that that's that's the that's the macro that's the big picture from 10 000 feet looking at the world and saying hey how good is it oh let's let's look at how ukrainians feel about this process let's look at other nations that are impoverished let's look at our own country and how we feel as christians about our own country then go to someone who's a who's the most liberal thinker and what do they think about america is anybody satisfied so then take that down to the microcosm which is your life the devil is offering you the opportunity you can govern yourself you know it's a lie it's a bouquet of flowers with a knife inside of it it's it's a total lie so as we get more technology and more governing bodies and more politics involved and more self-government are we getting happier are we getting more peaceful so the world is a mess because of self-government and it's getting less and less happy i think you'd almost wouldn't find a person that would disagree with that world worldwide no matter if they believe in god or don't believe in god they see the corruption that the world is going through okay so why would you as a young person or why would why would any of us want to choose the way of self-government which again okay you can look at it just as self-government but i'm telling you it's not self-government it's the headship of satan it's the dominion of the devil it's the control absolute control of the devil that's what satan offered in the beginning genesis 3 3 he said would you like to govern yourself would you like to have freedom would you like to do it your way and get something better than what god is offering and what was the result chaos death sin destruction so don't let's not go after satan's way and i think i think this is especially what the devil will offer to young people especially young people going through adolescence don't be governed by your parents don't be governed by the standards of the church you're attending decide for yourself it's a true statement decide for yourself you should make your own choice whether you're going to follow god or not but don't do it with your with deceiving eyes do it with your eyes open to the big picture the devil is offering you the opportunity to be free but it's not freedom it's death and destruction god is offering you the opportunity to be free but it isn't free to do whatever you like to do it's an opportunity to be free from the bondage of sin and death because that's the condition every person is born under you're born in sin and shaped in iniquity you're you're coming into this world with the sin nature on you so you're in bondage to sin you that's what you choose thank god young people here are growing in a home that's governing that that's keeping that in check you should thank god for that just you you think well it's so tough it's so hard my fam just imagine growing up in a home where mom and dad don't even pay attention to you just think about growing up in a home where mom and dad are more concerned with the drugs that they're going to take next finding those or the alcohol they're going to consume and you're just left to fend for yourself say mom and dad are so involved and there's just ah they're like suffocating me thank you jesus mom and dad that love you that much that they want to see you go the right way just okay find yourself in different shoes think about that for a second an inner city kid whose parents don't have anything to do with them they have to feed themselves get themselves to school all of that just have a little perspective so do you want to decide for yourself uh let's go to the next scripture isaiah 14 12. how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did sweak in the nations for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation and the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high so that's what satan deceived himself with no one else from the outside deceived satan satan deceived his own self he said i'll be i'll be like the most high again he the same deception he used on himself is the same deception he used on eve and it's the same deception he'll use on you today what is that deception i'll be like the most high he already was he couldn't get more like that there's not a possibility to get more brother branham says he's he was co-equal with god no he wasn't a creator no he wasn't omniscient omnipotent omnipresent but on on a place of authority god had him right next to him he was he was the throne guardian he was a leader in worship he was god he was god's right hand man and he says no that's not good enough i want to be i want i want to be above god and so he offered himself something better and something bigger that's what he offered to eve what was the results that's what he'll offer to you you're not better you're not better than lucifer who was created next to god as coequal you're not better you're not going to trump what happens when you choose to govern yourself you might you you might you you might think that there's a there's a third way there's no third way it's the headship of christ or the headship of the devil numbers 15 39. and it shall be unto you a fringe that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the lord and do them and that you seek not after your own heart and your own eyes after which you used to go a whoring look at that god's viewpoint on going after your own heart and going after your own eyes he says that's adultery see how see how honest god is with you from the beginning the devil the devil offers you something that he can never possibly fulfill because he wants to control you god says i'm going to lead you i'm going to be your shepherd but you if you go after your own heart and you go after your own eyes you'll be considered in a level of adultery against the lord proverbs 28 26 he that trusts in his own heart is a fool but whoso walks wisely he shall be delivered that's that's a straight statement what does our society tell us today what a social media means continually preaching to young people follow your heart trust your own heart god says you're a fool god says you're an adulteress jeremiah 17 9 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it that's why we don't follow our heart that's why that's why it's foolish to trust in your own heart we don't lean to our own understanding we don't we don't follow what our heart says by why why don't we follow where our heart is because there's a sin nature you need to have the holy ghost the only way you can ever listen to your heart is if the holy ghost is in there and then it's not listening to your heart it's listening to him as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god in fact it's not just unique to our age it's the deception of every age follow your heart make your own rules do it your way prank sinatra i did it my way do what you think will work best that's how satan starts out that's what he works in the minds of young people my parents are so old they could not possibly understand me they could not possibly understand what i went through i tell my kids all the time and i tell them my testimony all the time i do understand so that when they get to that place they feel like mom and dad dad doesn't understand they'll have that preach to them indelibly on their minds dad has told me 45 000 times that he understands me but that's how that's the little thing that he'll speak to young people's minds my parents don't understand my pastor doesn't understand the preacher doesn't understand it's different now it's the same in every age kids go after your own heart follow your own ways okay what's the results it's not doesn't take a degree in rocket science or philosophy to find out it's so it's so simple and so easy to find out what happens and it's misery it's sadness it's a constant search for meaning and purpose well i'm telling you you already have it it's already right in front of you it's preached you every wednesday and every sunday just grab a hold of it and say lord i need it not just in my ears i need it in my heart i need the power of the holy ghost to fulfill this because you can't you can't live the word without the holy ghost you have to have the power and fire of god in your soul and so if you're worried about something be worried about that to be sure you have the holy ghost to be sure he's living inside of you and changing your life continually so satan starts with that little thought i'm going to show you some new avenues that's his next step i'm going to show you some new avenues and they'll take you in many different ways oh you see that girl at your school that's an unbeliever she's real nice she's real sweet why don't you get in a relationship with that girl or you hear those kids they're getting together for a party why don't you go do that i'll tell you what happened to me i was involved with sports my whole life leading up to high school my senior year and senior year in baseball i got too proud of myself and the coach was benching me and i quit and so the people that i normally hang out hung out with were playing baseball so i had to find different people to hang out with and one kid was continuously saying i'm going to get you to smoke weed i'm going to get you to smoke weed i'm going to smoke weed i said no no 75 times i said no until the 76th time and i said yes because he was bothering me so bad if i would have been smart enough to recognize what the devil was doing at the time i would have said this guy is not my friend after the first time he asked me and said ah i got to find different people to be around i can't be around that which is what my parents were telling me and i didn't listen to so the direct approach that the devil will say is hey here's here's some alcohol and drugs that leads to sexual defilement or he's more subtle and he like i said before he offers a boyfriend or a girlfriend that likes those kind of things they're mostly nice right they're mostly good kids that's the devil's subtle approach oh it couldn't be a boyfriend or a girlfriend they they really like me they really care about me they do or or a worldly friend that you get equally yoked together with someone that's but they're your buddy and they really understand you and they get you and it's so subtle and the next thing you know you're going down a road that you never even intended to go down so the devil will you know that the devil makes a plan god has a plan for your life the devil makes a plan to destroy you to take you out he's done it to me he did it to me i'll talk about that more when i testify tonight about how the lord delivered me but 99.9 of times when a believer gets in a relationship with an unbeliever it's the unbeliever that's influencing the believer away from the word the believer is just meekly meekly following that along not saying anything not taking a stand and the next thing you know they're they're off on the wrong direction on the wrong path second corinthians 6 14 be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion has light with darkness and what concord has christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement has the temple of god with idols for you are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty so what does it mean to not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers well it doesn't mean that we have to join a monastery and go out in the world and never be around an unbeliever or never have a friend who is an unbeliever it's not what it means but to be unequally yoked there's a scripture just grab that deuteronomy 22 10 says thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together so it's it's it's a cooperation together where you're equal you're it's a business partnership it's a marriage it's a date it's a dating relationship it's a it's a friendship where both are equally influencing each other an unbeliever and a believer just to give a further testimony when i first got saved the lord changed my life he changed my desires but he didn't change my friends automatically that was up to me to do something about that and so i wanted to win my friends to christ but the problem was i didn't i just started talking to them i didn't tell them the whole picture the whole story and what my vision was for our friendship moving forward and because of that i ended up going to a party i ended up getting in a fight things that baby christians do because they're they they're not armed with the knowledge or the maturity to know if i do this then step five is a step that i don't want to take so as a as a young man 21 years old i went to a charismatic mega church my sister was going to i hadn't been introduced to the message yet so at the charismatic church the minister took this scripture and just gave a real basic description of how do you apply this as a new believer and so he said and it it astounds me because it was just totally discernment i was talking about that to my brother-in-law before the service what i was struggling with and here this preacher speaks exactly what to do that was that was the lord for me and he's he says bring your friend take your friends and and get together with them and speak to them and say i'm a christian now the lord has changed my life my desire is to live for him and to glorify him with my life in the past we would go to parties together we would smoke marijuana together we would drink together now i don't want to do that anymore you know i don't want to go to the club i don't want to i went down the list specific things that me and this person would do together now i want to be your friend still but but i don't want you to try to get me to do those things anymore i would like you to help me uh continue with the vision that i have for my life which is to be a christian and to get more like christ so if you would like to continue being friends on that level then that's great well i did that every friend of course said oh of course yes i will and they all vanished except for one friend and he would help me and encourage me to not do the things that we used to do together so then you find that's what you do that's the steps that you take to find out who's a real friend then you can go from there now you're not there now you're not unequally yoked now you now you are an influence on them and you're telling them you be a good influence on me if you're not gonna be a good influence on me then we can't be friends and that's okay we'll shake hands and and hug and part ways that's okay but then you now you're doing it god's way you know if you if you say i i'm i'm going to date this person so i can win them to christ you don't disobey god's word in order to bring a good outcome i think the apostle paul says in romans 3 8 he says and not rather as we slan as we be slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say let us do evil that good may come whose damnation is just oh i'm gonna i'm gonna disobey god's word so that somebody will obey god's word how does that work why do you think that would work yet people do it's common message believers denominational people all that it's common way of thinking it doesn't work 99.9 of the time i have seen people that got saved but the person that was in that situation but the person that was a message believer and the person that was not a message believer person message believer the whole relationship was started because they were witnessing witnessing witnessing witnessing and all of a sudden they're like are we dating i i don't know and then they accept the message get baptized and a little bit later they're married but the whole relationship was founded on i'm trying to i'm winning this person to christ it wasn't oh i'll get in a relationship and we'll try to win them to christ no it's not going to work like that so i'm i'm not saying it's not possible but don't put yourself in a position where you're seeking to disobey god's word to bring something good to pass again bondage versus freedom satan's offer of freedom is bon is a continuation of the bondage that you're already in from your birth god's offer of freedom again it's a freedom that's what what is what is it freedom i think that's a that's a thing that a young person say what do you mean freedom i'm told to not do this i'm told not to do that i'm told not to do this yes that would be your perspective without the holy ghost it's a bunch of rules it's a bunch of set things that i have to follow well it's that's because you're you're starting from a wrong way of thinking you're already under the law of sin and death you're born that way until you get the holy ghost that's the condition you are even in a godly home you're doing the right things making the right choices under the right influences without the spirit of god you're under the law of sin and death and so when the devil is working on your flesh he's going to bring he's going to bring this direction to your life in order to further that process in other words keep you under the law of sin and death keep you in bondage his offering of freedom to you as simply a ploy to keep you under his control and so god is saying i'm going to set you free i'm going to make you i'm going to deliver you romans 6 18 being then made free from sin you became the servants of righteousness paul says i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness into iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness for when you are the servants of sin you were free from righteousness what fruit had ye then in those things whereof you are now ashamed for the end of those things is death but now being made free from sin and become servants to god you have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life so you see what god is offering and what satan is offering satan is offering continuation in sin and death you say well i haven't i haven't got seen the fruits of that because you're under the right influence right now but you get out of that influence you'll be in you'll be under that commandment which is the law of sin and death get set free now don't wait until you have a whole lot of baggage and garbage in your life get set free today don't leave the church today under bondage leave it free and paul says what kind of fruit did you have what what what did your life produce when you were under bondage to the devil what was the results that you had in your life but now you've been changed what's the results you see now in your life and so young people look at that all of us look at that example what what are the fruits that you're seeing between the fruits of an unbelieving life and the fruits of a believing life and don't say i'm an exception to the rule there's not any romans 8 2 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death it is it is not growing up in a message home it's not growing up uh under the right influences that makes you free from the law of sin and death it's the spirit of the lord it's the spirit of god coming in your life by the baptism of fire cleaning you out changing you that sets you free from that law of sin and death no amount of teaching no amount of influence from the outside is going to do it it has to be the spirit of god in you then you're free second corinthians 3 13 and not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished so we're talking still talking about freedom we're talking about liberty but their minds were blinded for until this day remain at the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away when it the heart shall turn to the lord now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty we hear that verse and we get so excited and people shout and dance but what is that what is liberty what is the freedom where the spirit of the lord is verse 18 but we all with open face with unveiled face beholding as in a glass in a mirror this is amazing we with unveiled face looking in a mirror at the glory of the lord now now the glory of the lord is not just in moses the glory of lords and you and you're looking in a mirror and seeing the glory of the lord and you're changed into that same image from glory to glory so what is liberty what is freedom it's being delivered from blindness it's being it's being set free so that when you look at moses you say i can't look at moses i can't even look at him no now now it's different now that pillar of fire that's is broken apart now it's in you it's dwelling in you and your the veil is off and you can see the lord face to face and now you're changed to be exactly like him that's freedom that's liberty freedom is not choosing whatever we want to choose doing whatever we want to do that's bondage we want true freedom true freedom what is true freedom it's to live the way god created man to live to be his expression his manifestation his image and likeness to the world and when you live like that in total submission submission and freedom can exist together at the same time if you're a philosopher if you have a philosophy degree which i do sorry if you hear that you say it can't be it it is it is because when you're in in serving the lord when you're a slave of jesus christ you never feel better you never feel more free you never feel more powerful than when you're in that condition brother branham says in the sermon abraham's covenant confirmed in in the garden of eden the devil chose a part of a man and god chose a part god chose his heart the devil chose his intellect i've got just a couple more screens i'm not going to be able to finish but i'll just get through a few more of these quotes and we'll we'll close so in 1959 looking at the unseen brother branham says when god made man he made him thus for he made this little certain compartment in the man for his own throne his control tower god wants to lead man but mad but man wants to lead himself therefore there is a war constantly the man wants to go after what he sees with his eyes that's where he's deceived that's where satan deceived eve what she could see the fruit was pleasant to the eye but it was death to the soul so is it tonight god wants to lead man so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart so that man would be led by the spirit of god getting off on his own leading is what separated him from his fellowship young people you're going through if you're going through adolescence this is god's process to take you from being a little kid being governed by your parents to being a grown person that's led by the lord notice what i just said i didn't say that you would be free and to choose whatever you want to do i hope if i hope you choose to follow god but when you choose to follow god you're laying down choice because you know that your choice leads to bondage that's why brother bam says there's a war going on there's a war between what god's way and man's way which when we understand it what's man's way satan's leadership when jesus rebukes peter what does he say what does he tell the devil get behind me satan for you savor not the things of god but the things that be of men so satan's leadership was to savor the things of men not the things of god and god's purpose for peter was that he would savor jesus christ and not the religious way of thinking for that day and so he's getting off on his own leading his own idea and that separates the fellowship between god and man christian life 101 everybody young people listen up this is number one of christian life is you did not get to choose your own way married people if you're fussing at each other over what to do you're looking at the wrong thing it isn't about that it's about discerning the will of god we don't get to make our own choices when you're fight i've seen it in counseling so many times they're fussing and fighting i said wait a minute do you think you get to choose to do whatever you want to do no we don't think that oh okay good because you don't you have to pray and seek to find the will of god if you do that together husband and wife the only disagreement is are we waiting on the lord long enough is this the timing right are we hearing from him together as a young person that's what you that's that's the secret sauce learn that you're growing up you want to make your own choices okay god put that inside of you to do that but not to make your own choices in that sense he put that in you so that you would graduate to following the leadership of the holy spirit for your life so don't don't get it to the thing i mean if you if you look at insurance policies when you turn 25 the price goes down right why is that it's because sorry 22 year olds 23 year olds because you're i don't know this all the science behind it but the wires in your brain aren't fully formed yet until you're 25. sorry gideon the wires aren't fully formed until you're 25 so they they're like you can't make great decisions so you pay more for insurance and i would say the same goes as for the christian life if you're not if if you're in this process of graduating from being led by mom and dad to being led by the spirit of god in your own life understand understand it's not about what you want it's about learning to hear the lord's voice for yourself and that's the beautiful thing the lord's trying to do and parents teach them that's your job at this point in time is that scriptural is that according to scripture did you pray about that we have to remind each other my wife has to remind me about that brother branham's wife had to remind him about that did you pray about that no i didn't so let's slow down and pray about it and so i think i'm going to ask the musicians to come and just have one two more screens left that i want to show and then we'll finish it up so the devil's offering if you want to go to the next slide thank you the devil is offering to be free be happy follow your heart now he's coming to you from the outside in he's focusing on first your senses and then he's focusing on your mind because he knows if he can control from the outside it's going to produce unbelief in your soul so if he can manipulate you to look from the outside from your flesh from your mind then he has grabbed control of your life and so when you're growing up at any stage of our lives understand that this is what the devil's going to continually do look at your flesh look at the things of your mind follow that look at that he's constantly attacking every christian to look at life from that perspective because he doesn't want us to have he doesn't want us to believe god if we believe god then he's powerless so he comes at continually bombarding our flesh didn't you see how that person didn't get healed right away and didn't you see how that person suffered and didn't you see what happened to you sees working on your imagination didn't you didn't you look oh your friend that you love so much and this happened stop looking at that and look at the word with eyes of faith because god wants to govern you from the inside out with faith and the power of the holy spirit on the inside so that when these thoughts of looking at things from the outside in the devil's going after your flesh by faith you can put the enemy to flight and you can say it's not about me not about what i want to do it's about discerning the will of the lord it's about finding his purpose that's what it's about jesus came to that victory in his life he was made perfect through suffering right he was made complete through suffering the same thing happens to us we get trials we get hard things in life and we have to decide am i going to follow what i want to do or am i going to say not my will but thine be done amen let's stand the lord is offering us freedom but real freedom is being led by the spirit of god with a burning desire and passion to be walking in his perfect will amen let's pray heavenly father we just come to you lord and we ask that your holy spirit would just just brood over your people lord that you would come now and even speak speak in their heart maybe there's something in their life that satan's been working on them and he's got a plan to bring destruction and hurt and sorrow in their lives we asked lord that you would defeat the enemy in their lives that that they would that faith would rise up in their heart and they would say lord i'm yours i belong to you i'm not going to go my own way i'm coming to you lord anyone might be here that hasn't yet received the holy ghost whatever age they might be i pray lord you'd pour your spirit into their heart lord that you would change them from the inside out that your power would be manifested in their lives lord we cannot do it it's it's not it doesn't come by a great emotion lord though emotion accompanies it lord but it comes by the true reality of christ [Music] working by the word in our hearts fall upon your people now lord that their their lives would be changed they wouldn't be the same lord we need you to move in our lives i need you lord i need grace every moment every hour every day we ask these things in jesus name amen let's worship the lord with that song
