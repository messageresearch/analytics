TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to romans 3 we'll just read the first scripture of our reading then we'll be seated but romans 3 23 uh today and it's good to be back and um at least there's people that i know amen praise the lord that's always good when you go to unfamiliar churches then you're kind of feeling your way a little bit uh just see how it's gonna go but uh it's good and i we've had a lot of visiting ministers lately so i haven't preached very much this month so just a little nervous and i don't usually get that way so but i know that god has spoken and given me this thought and so be prepared to receive him amen praise the lord so let's let's read romans 3 23 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god i'll read the rest after we pray for all have sinned that comes short of the glory of god who are we then we're nothing amen lord jesus we just love you and we praise you we thank you god for the word of god we thank you that if it was not for you we would not be here if we were not predestinated by your foreknowledge we would not be here god you allowed us to make the choice lord and god i'm just grateful for that lord god how how some of us were raised in in homes lord that that exalted you others were not but i say thank you lord for getting your seeds watered and into your life lord praise your mighty name thank you lord that there's nothing impossible to you lord and i say thank you so much lord in the name of jesus christ we pray amen praise the lord you may be seated i was it's not original to me but i uh i heard a testimony one time that somebody was had a burden for souls and so he started praying for all those that crossed a certain bridge by his house and then he just went on from there so i just took it i said lord and i prayed all the time i said lord anybody who walks on our parking lot at church who turns around in the parking lot who trespasses or breaks bottles i claim their souls they're going to be saved sanctified and filled with the spirit and so we had a sister move in from alaska and she has two girls and the one comes to church all the time and the other is uh is transgender and she has a yellow mohawk and she has metal all over her face and it just she came down with them and she sat in the parking lot and i was like praise the lord amen she's coming hallelujah and so my wife after charity she went out afterwards and uh and seen her out there went over there hi god bless you how are you and she had the nicest spirit but she doesn't realize that she's she's already under the authority of my prayer amen and so that's encouraging isn't it hallelujah and so i god has blessed me because of the work i did i just retired a couple years ago from the fire department so you know we're not in la or uh or a columbus but we do run a lot of calls and see a lot of things and you see a lot of metal in people's faces and tattoos and you know their whole head's tattooed and they got things everywhere and it's like man that's gotta hurt amen but but it's like you know i just treat them like they they just have skin because and that's what's missing people people they need to be treated like human beings and uh and not like oddities or or or objects of disdain but but i was working on a a guy who got in a fight he was drunk of course and got his arm broken by bat and i'm just treating him like a human and he uh he's going you're such a nice white man and he's just said it over and over you're such a nice white i said i got it i said i thank you but i got it okay because you can't deal with drunk people amen so anyway but but i tell you what it's uh it's uh and i'm gonna talk about several things the lord willing tonight but but i have a strange title today it's all about the mail not the letters but the m-a-l-e it's all about the mail praise god the brother should have said yes amen don't be afraid amen so it's all about the mail and you're going to see where we're going with this today uh because without the mail there's no birth amen i know that satan's eating it has manipulated all that but to have a real birth with a real nurturing relationship it has to be about him amen and so i'm going to read romans 3 23-26 in the amplified since all have sinned and are falling short of the honor and the glory which god bestows and receives all are justified and made up right and in right standing with god freely and gratuitously by his grace his unmerited favor and mercy through the redemption which is provided in christ jesus so there's only mercy and redemption in the mail and we're going to see that and what i like is what was the headstone crying when it came down i believe a prophet i believe a prophet i believe the seven seals are old but i no grace grace grace that's what was being shouted as the headstone was coming down and where was that headstone coming down to to the shoulders of his people the government amen that's you down to the shoulders of his people and so you have a mating amen of god himself and humans amen and so today you are a super race amen nothing is too hard for god through you and so these are the things god is the god of the impossible amen and so there's nothing too difficult for him we just can't say when it's going to happen we can't put a timeline but it's already done everything's already finished hallelujah and so in verse 25 who whom god put forward before the eyes of all amen they all seen him they all knew what he was like they all seen paul and the apostles and the converts as they he put him forward before all of our eyes as a mercy seat and a propitiation by his blood the cleansing and life-giving sacrifice of atonement at one moment and reconciliation i love that to be received through faith this was to show god's righteousness because in his divine forbearance his long suffering he had passed over and ignored former sins without punishment oh tonight you're going to hear some of my testimony and and i did i think actually the first time i've seen brother paul and sharon and and mom wherever she's at or if she's not here but uh was in 84 at cloverdale at their camp and you were singing so 1984. uh but then uh you know from there we went up to i think their first winter retreat and i do remember that we had hot dogs a lot that's easy amen but it was like i mean in my mind it was hot dogs for every meal but it was probably amen so but this was to show god's righteousness because in his divine forbearance he had passed over and ignored sins without punishment oh the sins the unbelief that we went through it's always it's always there that picture is always there you have to live with that and so don't think oh they got to go out into the world and i didn't it's like don't ever think that because you relive the devil makes sure you relive those all the time and you're always the bible says casting down imagination casting down imagination and so in verse 26 it was to demonstrate and to prove at the at the present time and i like this in the now season so jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever in the now season that he himself is righteous and that he justifies and accepts as righteous him who has true faith in jesus oh i did i love that passage in the amplified amen we're in the now season and and we are in the time where we are beginning to manifest the male amen because when a woman is is married and she and and she begins to to to be pregnant that you most women know when they're pregnant right i've been on calls at work where they said they didn't know and you're wondering how that happens but i i mean you've got to believe them but but you show right and and if you're showing then then you know usually the men wait till you're far enough along that you don't offend somebody by accident say oh you're pregnant no but but we begin to show when when when the seed has been planted and it begins to grow we we show amen and and so that's how people know we are christians we don't even have to say anything but people know we're different they're just something they go there just something about you they're just something about your spirit you're just it's more than just being nice praise the lord and so i'm putting this all on him this morning because that's where it should be and so this we see all the way back in the old testament it was an innocent lamb for the guilty follower of god in in the garden actually when they came out of the garden it was an innocent lamb to cover and that was by revelation hallelujah and so that revelation had to carry through to the time of jesus he was an innocent lamb to cover and to take away and to bring atonement for all the sins of the people and in our day it's right there again it's that bloody fresh word of god amen that is that is that is revealed to you by the holy spirit by the life of the lamb amen how can we get we can't get away from that it has to be the male amen hallelujah so i kind of like that the principle is the innocent for the guilty why did god send a prophet not so we could attain big old brains right i know some people think that's what the message is and you almost have to have a man on each side of the minister to hold his brain up but we're not here for that we're see the most revelated who think they're revelated should be the greatest servant of all amen and so you know all those things are scarecrows and so as our brother said i mean there's going to be things that happen in church well this sister this brother it's like you know what what is that to me follow thou be amen praise the lord it's like you know we're in the time to grow up amen we need to get a spine some of the things from my work you know you got to grow up amen and so but god will do that and so the principle is the innocent for the guilty and that was all of us and if there's anybody here who has not made that commitment you need that you need him because he is he will be your husband and you are the wife amen and as the wife you can relax under his leadership and and because to me he's the god of the impossible he can do anything he wants he can save anybody he wants he can he can heal anybody he wants it's all in our faith in him because he's already he's already did it and so it was the blood of the male lamb that could only cover sin that's the only thing and it's still the only thing that will cover sin and that's what made the comer justified just as if they never done it amen and that's why we take communion because we have to look into the mirror of god's word and we we go over our life by the word and then we empty out of everything and repent so we're justified oh hallelujah people get oh we're having commune again a potluck again sometimes as a pastor you just it is i don't know you know how you get sometimes it's like you just want to say something but you know what we were we were there before so you can't you know people are only growing into into the likeness of god and they have to come the way the same way we did amen and so that blood of the male is the covering and and the passover lamb that they would use they would keep it up for uh 14 days and it was perfect it had to be perfect and and like pilate says i find no fault in jesus he had to testify that he was prophesying that but i like this is that this 14th day of keeping this slam up it covered two sabbaths brother brown said one for the jews and one for the gentiles he's the same yesterday today and forever amen and so the power of the word is still here it is for the bride the revival is the word of god because the holy spirit's there you can't have a word revival without the holy ghost in you because as the word revival comes your whole day begins it starts with a praise in your heart when you get up when i wake up one eye opens and and there's there's always something amen it's i'm bound for the promised land or i'm doing something i'm singing and i get up and of course you gotta have coffee and then i go do my prayer time my bible reading in prayer time but see it is that passover lamb was not only for the jews but also of the gentiles and so we today must completely in a chaotic uh a world that we live we have to completely rely on jesus christ the lamb slain for us amen you have to this is not an option you have to receive that lamb that bloody lamb because theology won't get you there amen it has to be jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and so it's all about the life of that male that takes our sin away because doctrine doesn't do anything amen your church it's good to go to church but your church really doesn't do anything this is about you amen coming under uh the the leadership of the holy ghost you become desperate for god you repent you get baptized and then you know that he will give you the holy spirit amen i hope you realize there's in the word there's no option you have to receive the holy ghost there's there's no option you have to receive the mail amen and so if you're seeking for him he is there and he will fill you with the spirit amen hallelujah praise the lord jesus and you know what things just start falling away the the things you used to do it's like well i didn't have to quit any of that it just it just it's like man i don't have that attitude i don't have this issue anymore and and i tell you what god is the god of reality and in our day the the evil is so prevalent and it's because the media is so prevalent we have so many ways to to receive unbelief right and so but the thing of it is like our brother said he's still greater the standard is high it's up there you got to use it amen because when the enemy comes in like a flood you have to raise the standard and and especially with young people and the older ones it's like oh brother there's so many thoughts going through my head all day long how can that how can i be a christian i said you've repented right and and you love god with all your heart and you love his word and you want to serve him don't you well yeah well get used to it get used to it when we're out on the job i mean that's all they talk the guys all they do is talk about women's body and sex all day all day long they're good people obviously because they like to help and and they do some great things but can you imagine being around that all 24 hour shifts that's all they talk about and so guess what guess what goes through my head born again believer all those words all those thoughts but see i've been with the mail amen my husband he looks out for me and he never fails me and so what what do i do i'm saying it's not me in the name of jesus that's not me i'm walking around saying it out loud simon it's not me amen casting down imagining that's an imagination that's about but they said that people say oh but it's so detailed how could it not be me i say the devil has kept notes on you from the time you broke the womb he knows you better than you know yourself when you come into a situation you watch it all of a sudden all those things that he knows that you can be tempted by he will bring those out but see you've been with the mail and just because the thoughts are there you kicking them out does not mean you're an unbeliever amen it means you're a christian because now you care about those things and you're now you're just i mean when i come home from work and the other brothers you come home from work and you're exhausted physically because you're you're casting down and casting down amen hallelujah but you are saved sanctified filled with the holy ghost amen and so see it's the male who takes it away not the doctrine and not the female the church the female does not take away your sin just coming to church means that you can set in church for two hours that's all it means just because you have long dresses and long hair just means that you can you can copy somebody amen you men uh just because you do things or don't do things that doesn't mean anything any legalist can do that praise the lord amen that's why i tell the people don't be a hypocrite come like you are i mean i want them to respect the house of god right but if you usually have purple hair come in purple hair because if we don't preach a living gospel then then what good are we anyway well we're not here to uh to have a group of people enjoy one another we're here to let the male impregnate if i can use that word the holy ghost amen praise the lord we that was always my joke is like i don't care if they have a mohawk and and purple hair well one day i come in and my song leader is really excited he goes guess what he goes there's a there's a young guy and his wife here he has purple hair and a mohawk so just think about what you're saying amen before you say it because you're a creator amen and so but they they stayed they enjoyed it they came to the potluck it's like praise god amen so i it you know uh i like that when complete unbelievers come in praise the lord and so since christ the male is the word then what is he he's both spirit and written word and so both of them have to go together the the husband and the wife go together hallelujah the bride and the bridegroom the spirit and the word you cannot you you cannot separate those though denominational spirits try right they try to be really good uh conservative fundamentalist or they try to be really good charismatic say amen hallelujah but see you can't do that because the husband is everything not just parts and and we could go off on marriage right now amen hallelujah but we won't we'll try to stay away from that but we know that he is both the written and the spirit form and that is the reason that god restored christ in this day because you and i had to have a vision of a complete husband and a real relationship not only for our soul salvation but for marriage amen and so the it's all about the male and in the marriage amen we put a lot of burden on the women but it's not really about them it's about the mail because the male has the responsibility for everything not the female amen and so uh it's god family and yourself so your fishing hunting skiing jet skiing is down here god's number one and so you now have the responsibility to to guard the family what comes into the home uh in in media and all those things it's all about you and now you have to be the spiritual leader you can't rely on your wife to be the spiritual leader because that's not gonna work you it's all about you being the guardian and the spiritual leader of that home and and what will happen is your wife will begin to revere you because it's all about you because you treat her as a sister and as somebody who is a partner in the grace of god with you and your kids won't hate you amen i told somebody the other day i said i'm pretty fortunate because my kids uh they still like me and the guy was a he's a firefighter he's not a christian he goes oh rich he goes who wouldn't like you well there's a list there's a list and and you don't get away from the people that hated your parents right because then they just they just throw it on you and so that adds to it more amen but i wouldn't have it any other way psalm 107 20 it says he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions so the word is more than just the written word the word is a living word and so we serve a living god and the living god is here right now though you can't see him with your eyes amen but he's here to offer deliverance and victory in your life as long as you want it amen and and he is as real as you want him to be and he said that sounds so worldly but it's true amen your home will be as godly as you want it to be amen your marriage will be as godly as you want it to be your church will be as godly as as you want it to be and so that's why he did he sent his word he couldn't send anything else because christ was the word amen and he brought his spirit and his word together and he delivered you from your destructive old nature amen you were going the wrong way but god got a hold of you one day god rich in mercy and from then on he began to grow you into his likeness and so the jews in jesus day what happened they lost faith in the blood of the lamb and they put more faith in their church and traditions than the blood amen we're in a day where it's the bride is getting rid of her traditions and she's putting more faith in the blood amen she's putting more faith in jesus christ the reality of her experience amen glory to god oh there's so much i could say but we don't have time but you just start putting the word first by the holy ghost and you can see every little thing to the point where people are going to go you're relating everything back to god oh god did this god did this well no it's true amen he did do this i i was oh i was mowing my lawn and it's a big lawn and i said lord if you could see fit could i have one of those lawn sweepers that hook up to the back of my riding lawnmower i said in jesus name that night i went in and looked up on craigslist there's a long sweeper and they they are told they've been so hard to get and there's one in monmouth where our churches so i wouldn't picked it up but see you might be sitting there saying so but to me that's the god of the impossible at work because he he heard my lips and and it was it was a want but he gives your wants sometimes to help you along through your experience amen hallelujah and that stuff happens all the time because we are in the age of the spoken word aren't we amen well brother that's for no you don't don't tell me what god doesn't do i i'm a little bit tired of that why don't you start telling me what he does our church doesn't do that i don't care what your church does or doesn't amen what does god do amen let me come over there and and take my sledgehammer and start breaking the crust off of you hallelujah amen and so the jews had lost their faith in the lamb and put more faith in traditions and so is message the message churches around this world especially the u.s they have lost faith in the mail oh how can you say that then let me see the word move in your life oh brother you're you're talking about signs and wonders and miracles no i'm not i'm just talking about you being an overcomer let's start there let's start with your attitude brother brown says when when you lose faith you start you start complaining about others you start you start complaining about other churches you start you start saying oh they're not this uh you know they're they're they're minor league we are so revelated they are minor league how could how why would we even want to go there that's a real quote that's a message quote and it's just like god's going okay let me just pull my spirit back from you hallelujah but see they've lost faith in the mail both in the written and the spirit forms your pastor travels he can tell you that fear has overtaken messaged churches when the male is right here to deliver but brother that that's that's a hard thing yes it is that's a hard thing but you just believe what he says he does it hallelujah and so and we rely on theology and doctrine rather than the male amen you know what i've said it before but i believe it if i go to hell preaching this gospel then that's what it will have to be because we believe this word and and we want to see jesus christ blossom in our life and that comes you have to have that word amen and so revival for the bride is not focused around doctrine brother brown says it's never been around doctrine it is about jesus christ and his word that's where revival is and that's why this is the the bride's revival of the word jesus christ amen and see here's the wonderful thing the blood of jesus was created it wasn't mary's egg it wasn't anybody else's seed it was god created both those things in her womb and what did she say she said be it unto me according to your word she wasn't a spiritual giant amen hattie wright wasn't a spiritual giant but they could say be it unto me yes lord i don't know how it's gonna happen but i believe that you're the god of the impossible praise god amen just like that we went on this young guy he was like 30 and and and we call it a code but cpr and all drugs and innovation and all that and he'd been a sisterly which is flatline and people don't usually come back from that and so again we're we're walking in to help the other engine crew and i i walked by and i seen it was flatline and i looked up my other friend and i said yeah let's just do one more round of drugs and then call it but but god had been dealing with me on just doing what the word says so as i'm walking by i touch his shoulder and from here to here brother that's coincidence boy isn't that odd brother paul that everything is coincidence can you see i know some of you were thinking that but that's again we have to get out of that thinking because we are word people we have the holy ghost and the word does exactly what it says and and see out of my mouth i said if i ever see him again i'm going to testify to him the very next morning at work we're back out there this is like a month or so later we're back out there and i thought that kind of sounds like matthew this this kid and and we walk in there and i see him i go you and he goes like that it's like ooh sorry he's having chest pain and now i just made it worse but i said you're a miracle and so i was able to say can i pray for you he's like yeah you know because he he doesn't know anything about god but i tell you what when god wants to do something he's going to do it amen and so though the word is the male and he never comes out of a church he never comes out of religion brother uh oh i didn't have coffee so i'm forgetting his name but brother lawson he was out one time when we're on the beach and we're witnessing to this guy on the beach and and i said you know what i hate religion and he looks at us he goes you can't say that you're preachers and it's like well yeah because religion and christianity are two different things amen and so god doesn't come out of a church amen and so god is in every church even denominational churches because guess what whether you want to believe it or not the word is the word is the word no matter where amen they may not have what you have but they have the they have parts of the word and if you didn't have anywhere else to go and and there was uh some place around there then you could say amen to different parts of the word sitting there hallelujah amen you know what we got to quit telling our husband what to do right amen let him just let him lead praise god and so that blood was created so that so that it could do the work that he said it would do and so he never come out of the jews religion he was completely separate brother branham the messenger of this hour never came out of denominations he was completely outside the church amen because here's the thing brother iran says that the church can sit on and hover over those church members just just relax oh isn't it warm doesn't it all nice and fuzzy and oh don't you have a good time when you're here but if they're not with the if the mate hasn't been with them then then they're going to rot so what good is it and i'm about church but let's let's let's bring our sacrifice of praise let's come with the expectation that god is going to reveal himself every service amen because in jehovah jiren 64 he says that jesus christ oh i love this brings the fertility of the spirit hallelujah amen he he does it he's the one that brings it he's the one that causes you to be impregnated with his spirit he's the one that causes you to believe the word all the best you can do is intellectually try to figure out the message we have to be born again amen and and he will be born again in many different ways don't let somebody tell you that you have to do a certain thing because usually in a multiple choice test if if the question says you must you have to amen or always it's wrong you don't have to fear that just just bring their ministry bring their words in front of the earl and summon and if it doesn't light up then you don't fear them hallelujah so it's the fertility of a spirit that he gives you it's he makes you believe you never wanted to go to church you never wanted to believe it is he that makes you believe you are here because your husband brought you oh hallelujah praise the lord we were preaching somewhere one time and a woman came to church and afterwards she she said that she had a dream and god told her to come to church at this church and god spoke to her later on she got baptized she'd come up out of the water god took cigarettes from her he's the god of the impossible amen hallelujah and so the fertility of the spirit he gives you he makes you believe don't worry just repent and be baptized and let him lead you oh hallelujah amen and besides that your pastor is ordained to see you through god will anoint him i guarantee if you start praying and asking god's questions then he will then your pastor will be anointed to speak him back to you and so ephesians 3 20 now unto him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that works in us that word power means virtue according to the virtue that works inside of you by the word amen and so we we don't even ask enough amen we don't expect enough amen oh but if you start to expect start to ask oh but brother i don't want to bug him and you know what i just want to be humble i want to yeah keep keep giving me your excuses right i think my job kind of may be a little bit hard on some things but it's for our own good amen because i'm hard on myself amen and so but no just start saying lord this is a need amen or this healing i need this amen i'm in the line of duty if you're a wife you're in the line of duty if you're a husband you're in the line of duty if you're a minister you're in the line of duty amen and so moses was in the line of duty and the sea parted for him amen hallelujah you're in the line of duty start asking for those things amen praise the lord amen hallelujah i don't care if it's a parting of the sea or anything we were on top of the rocky mountains when i was a little kid one time and it was a snowstorm a blizzard were in a white car and my my dad was going lord jesus we're going to be hit by a semi if you don't do something and all of a sudden thus saith the lord in five minutes this storm will clear and you will be able to go and drive on and as a little boy i still remember sitting in there and the the sky is going back amen are were we anything special absolutely not but god loves his bride amen he loves to do abundantly above all what you ask and think amen hallelujah amen see this is why we must project him oh don't get caught up in the things that you're too good for that you're too good to get sucked into all the things of the world amen see the people need to come in contact with the male christ in you amen not just the church none of the guys that work who are unbelievers they hate church and they make fun of christians all the time except me and i'm not saying that arrogantly except me they would always get on me you gotta talk more you gotta say this i said i don't have to do anything i said how about i just live a life and god saved one or two of those guys praise god i don't have to do anything that that that denominational spirit tries to tell me to do because the world is already sick of it amen and so the thing of it is there's nothing worse to see a defeated and worldly message person just to find all of their entertainments all of their words all of this all of that well brother branham said well brother amen hallelujah see there's an old saying if i can remember it right what is it you can't kid a kid or you can't you can't fool somebody who's already been there right and so what it does to me i don't look down on them at all i just think god there's another one i need to put on the prayer list and and so i don't i don't look down on people who are sinners because that's just what they are brother brown says you cannot bring a sinner under your rules and so if they come to church and they're in a uh if the guys come in and in shorts and a tank top and flip-flops then they come in right see we don't like that do we bless god when i came i had sleep down to here my my skirt was so long and drugged 20 feet behind me and the guy says yes i had a flat top and high and tied and and i had this suit it was just right i'm not about coming as you are and you know i'm about dressing up because you want to do your best but these sinners don't know any better and i can give you testimonies not all day long about from people at the tabernacle and so the deacons allowed this one hippie they picked up he was in cut off levi's and one of those just thin tank tops and bare feet hello brother god bless you here's your seat probably i've seen it uh one day that when i used to live in ohio i walked in and i couldn't get home to change it was when i lived with brother doug and his brothers and and i was in my baseball uniform from coaching baseball and and i came in and i sat in the back row and these people kind of turned just like they're kind of like i wanted to say i'm sorry i couldn't get home i wanted to be here amen and so but and so i feel sorry for them but see that's the reason why people don't desire what you have because because you're allowing the world to suck it out of you that doesn't mean you're lost amen it just means that we have to allow the husband to be in more control amen and so matthew 5 13 it says ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his savior wherewith shall it be salted it thenceforth it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and be trodden under foot of men all right so i'm i'm at work and i'm at one of the bigger stations so there's a lot of guys there someone calls up and they said oh there's this naked woman on this channel she's so whatever and so they're like you know getting to change the channel well i was like great so i just turned and i'm in the kit i'm at the kitchen but it's one bit of open room so i turn over here and uh blackwell one of the guys one of the funniest people you'd ever want to work with he uh he's seen me and he goes in his face he goes rich he goes you you make me feel like a sinner and he was kind of serious and i said well right amen after dinner all the dishes were washed everything's cleaned up they'd always sit down a movie and one of my friends i'd always get up and go to my room to study and he started telling him he goes man rich is tired all the time he never stays and watches and finally he came and talked to me and he gave his heart to the lord because of that we had these guys are good guys nice guys but we had one guy named stan and he was so filthy and so every time he jumped out he goes hey guys he's like and so when i seen him come i had to just turn and go away from him and they don't like that sometimes but you know what i love my husband more than those guys hallelujah and so one time i i did something to another group and they're like very charismatic christians and and one of the guys mark he's just like you you legalist you think this and that he was so upset and it was like you know what i don't care what you think i did something i'm going to apologize and so no one rules me see i don't care what anybody thinks of me in here i think when you're just starting out you tend to ask opinions of other ministers but as you get older you we don't do that anymore you go straight to god and let him give you the answer and so i i'm not approved by any minister in the message i don't have a stamp of my passport to michigan approved no god approves you god approves your pastor god approves you as an individual amen and so brother mama says you are the salt of the earth and the salt can only save if it comes in contact with the spoiling earth so you don't have to be part of that spoilage you don't have to act like that you don't have to you say but brother richard sorry i know it's hard that's why we need each other that's why we need mentors that's why we need to be in prayer read the word it is hard but you don't have to sacrifice yourself because god has something for you to do amen hallelujah and so christ that preservative must come in contact with the spoiling earth amen it's rotting away but you have the key to life amen you have that word of god you have the mail amen and they need you that's why this is not about brother branham this is about the elisha ministry of the bride amen you have to come in contact so you can give out of yourself praise the lord hallelujah amen see we've lost our brotherly love we you know i i've worked around homeless people all my career and and there's they're not nice people and so don't give me any lecture on homeless people because if you do you probably don't know what it's like so don't tell me anything they're murderers they're thiefs they're vandals they assault one another they rape one another but they're a son and a daughter of somebody we're on a call one time and one of the police officers i said you know what there uh and he said he goes they're somebody's son they're somebody's daughter and i said exactly i said that's why that's why i don't hate them that's why i don't reject them hey man but they will not pull the wool over my eyes but i will help them any way they can that's what you have to be like you have to have eyes the sea and ears to hear you have to have the vision of your husband so that you can come through these things and so it causes you to love your pentecostal brothers your baptist brothers your methodist brothers it causes you to do those things amen and you love them praise the lord jesus hallelujah and so the people of this world they're looking for reality and at my work amen all those worldly men mocked all the christians except me why is that because i'm not well it's probably because you're not really saying anything you're probably getting right no no the one who still uh calls me and wants to get together i'd walk in and he goes hey you guys shut up he goes cobs here i was like oh cool this is nice amen and you know stuff like that so they they they're even protecting you and so that's why it's like and one time he somebody said something to me goes he goes well he goes i'm living my christian life through cobb i said well that's nice but no you you need to have your own amen you're a big burly firefighter you gotta grow up amen hallelujah and so am i taking too long okay that's why i love dealing with unregenerate people that's why i love dealing with people who who'd know nothing about god amen it's it for me that's very fulfilling uh one of our the guys that go to the brothers go to the church he has been testifying to a brother and this brother was in the middle east and so he has ptsd and and so he he texted me and we got acquainted and i'm supposed to go talk to start talking to him at lunch when i get back but he goes you know what he goes he goes i thought i was the antichrist he goes i don't know if i'm savable and i'm like oh you talk about serving up a home run pitch amen oh i it makes you want to feel like dumping out everything you know what god has said amen and so i'm excited to be with this guy to tell him about jesus christ and what he's done for him already and then bring him further in the word amen and so i just love that and so the male is in control if you haven't got the idea yet the male is in control see in the old testament the blood was good but he never took the desire but when jesus christ came and he sent the holy ghost back he shed his blood sent the holy ghost back then he banished those desires forever and here's where most of the people get quiet god took the spirit of lust out of me when he saved me the desire oh brother so you you're never tempted ever are you wrong but the desire is not there jesus was tempted in every way if you were a homosexual today and want deliverance you would want to know he was tempted right i'm just saying what the bible said in every way see we want to put it in this box no in every way and so you are still tempted but temptation cast down is not sin that's where maturity comes that's where that battle of the mind and you start doing that and it could be you know dozens of other things right but you start casting that down and the devil's just pounding saying see there you go you're not a believer and if he's doing that you're saying oh thank you you're telling me i'm a believer praise the lord amen and so don't let those things get you down and despondent and want to give up just you that means that you are going the right direction hallelujah amen and i say this and i don't want to be crude but in our line of work you see more naked flesh than most people do in their whole life praise god the desire was gone and so it's it's it doesn't rip you apart oh i love god so much amen that's why i seen brother chris cathy and heard his testimony of saying yes hallelujah praise the lord and so when you're serving him this is an active relationship you're not seeing how close you can get to the world you're seeing how far you can get away from the world amen and so see how do you think good people keep a christian testimony at school or at work how do they do that well they're just man they get all charged up and and they're all they have their mindset i said lord i'm going to work again god i'm in a battle and lord but greater are you that is in me than he that's in this world and god i need you i need you to be victorious and i accept that today in the name of jesus christ amen that's what that's what happens hallelujah we were all sitting around a table one day one of our captains was making fun of people who spoke in tongues you know how you get you're just like i'm gonna have to say something so i pulled him aside i said greg i said there's a lot of faults but i said there's a reel and explained to him and i think he felt like maybe i was going to write him up but i just wanted to explain to him but i couldn't let that go see that there what happens is you can't let those things go you can't let people make fun of other christians amen you can't let people make fun of the word and and it's just you know for me i just i don't set anything on my bible does that really mean anything i don't know but i want to respect god amen oh he's so good to us today and so they need to see the people who have been with the mail amen and so another quote here from confirmation of the commission uh he's talking about the scripture if you abide in me my word abide in you you can ask what you will and it shall be done for you amen not maybe it will hallelujah and he says that that is staying with christ in the word don't go left don't go right amen stay right with it and then actually it's not your word anymore you begin to speak what he says and that's why you begin to create an atmosphere no matter where you are and every demon is subject to your atmosphere praise the lord jesus hallelujah every part of his word through your mouth has authority because brother random said in this day authority is the sign of the end is the sign of all of his brides amen hallelujah oh we have we do a spanish outreach and one to the couples they just started coming when this event happened and she was six months pregnant and the doctor said oh the baby i'm afraid it's probably dead and so she came to church and so the body prayed for that little baby and god raised that baby back to life then then they took another scan and one of his lungs were smaller than the other they said oh you're going to have to stay in this hospital and have therapy she goes i'm not doing any such thing they probably thought she was crazy so the body prayed and when they did another scan both lungs were the same size these signs shall follow them that believe that means message people the denominations don't have a corner on that that's part of your package did you know that brother ram says both the latter and the former lane are poured out for you which is the teaching rain and that supernatural rain just i want it to be just common to us not in the fact that you're complacent but it's just oh yeah i prayed and look what god did right praise the lord and so in mark 16 it says in 15 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel into every creature and to preach means to make the word manifest in its life amen praise the lord amen it doesn't say go teach it go do this go do that it says go and preach the gospel the word of god in its life amen praise the lord jesus amen and so that's what god wants us to do today is that that's why your minister has to have the holy ghost so that the word can come forth in the power of the word amen hallelujah amen and that comes by the mail see the religious people they they don't deny message people who who are just church members they don't deny jesus christ they don't deny the word intellectually but they deny god giving you authority to move it that's what they don't like they want to reserve it for a special man and that is that you talk about antichrist praise the lord and so he he he wants to show you that he is everything the word says he is amen and all that he says will come to pass and so god revealed to us today the word of god which is jesus christ and and i like this scripture luke 1 45 and we're getting down towards the end luke 1 45 and blessed is she this is elizabeth speaking to mary and blessed is she that believed for there there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord that's that's a performance means it's going to happen amen hallelujah and so there's going to be a performance whatever you've heard in this bible amen as you come here to church or or who are listening to those tapes whatever he told you there will be a performance not maybe it will be a performance you will be victorious you will be healed you will be a testimony you will suffer persecution and you will overcome it hallelujah amen praise the lord jesus see philippians 1 6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it unto the day of jesus christ not maybe will oh hallelujah praise the lord jesus amen and so he began the good work then he'll lead you and guide you into all the truth don't worry don't get under pressure when when god saved me i had to make a choice do i follow what the message people are telling me or do i follow what god's telling me and i said i'm going to follow what god's telling me because message people can be wrong but not god hallelujah he brings you to maturity and so if you're married to the male then he is your husband and you're to let him do the leading i was preaching one time and we had a bunch of unbelievers and i i kept saying he's the husband and i'm the wife and they asked their parents they go is he gay i just started laughing amen see the church can't lead you message theology cannot lead you brother branham and his series when he was there in jeffersonville with uh who is this melchizedek and marriage in divorce he says he says am i going to lead you to jeffersonville he goes absolutely not we're as full of mistakes as anyone else i can't lead you to anywhere except jesus christ and so the church cannot lead you but the male will lead you you just have to surrender to this word amen hallelujah in our marriages if we don't come into relationships with the holy ghost then your marriage in the message will not last i've seen it two years maybe because you come in with the wrong set of expectations because when the holy ghost puts you together then like for me and my wife and and if she was here she would say it's just not me it's better now than it was the first few years and the young people are going yeah whatever and i look at them going you are so ignorant see because you don't know what you don't know but with the holy ghost because the holy ghost takes you through trials struggles and you're getting knit closer and closer and closer and closer and so every part of the marriage relationship gets better and so we just we just had our 25th and it's like it's awesome praise the lord jesus hallelujah and so a real wife desires her husband to lead i was setting with or my wife was set with deacon's wives from a certain church in another state so you don't you can't guess and they were all talk and they go i can't obey my husband and this is a revelated church with all the answers i was like excuse me you can't obey your husband hmm that's a scarecrow i didn't say this message i knew brother branham was wrong no it's like they need revelation the message is always right praise the lord and so a real wife desires the husband to lead and if she has the spirit inside then god will allow him amen he you through your prayers if he's not the leader then you can pray him into that position because he answers your prayer whatsoever you need right and don't doubt it'll come to pass you you can pray him into things that's getting kind of weird brother rich okay right hallelujah because the wife and the kids need a leader they don't need a wet dish rag right amen see we had to come to that point no media in the bedrooms it all stays out in the hallway before they go to bed we've had too many incidents so well you don't love your kids i guess not right i guess not but it makes me feel better hallelujah and so the man you have to lead by that anointed word because if you don't your wife's going to try to fill that position and as a man sometimes laid a scene man it's like oh this is nice man she cooks she cleans she does devotions and she takes the kids to church when i'm because because you know i gotta have some man time i gotta i gotta go fishing on sunday and and she's struggling and you're out there being a wimp see it takes a real man to lead his house hallelujah and i know i'm not i'm preaching the choir because brother paul preaches the same thing so because she wants leadership a sheep wants leadership we want leadership i want him to lead i want him to be in control and so it's i i like this see all of us just not me you work around a lot of filthy people whether at work or at school and guess what i made mistakes i grieved over them but i never did it again that's the evidence of the holy spirit in your life because you couldn't do that if you were trying to do it in a sanctified state only amen see it was the male it was god who kept me and he was god who kept me repenting because he he he he did it that night because see i went back from living here and and i was a good kid and i went to church and and i was polite and respectful but when i got back and that we'll talk about that tonight more bit i just i got in with my old friends again and then i ended up in the casinos and drinking and i was addicted and and if you've ever been addicted has anybody ever had addictions you know what it's like you have to do it there's not an option you you have to do it and so but i left one night when i was like seminar retailed that little part tonight but when i left that casino sick and tired of myself desperate i just said god i i can't i can't do it i can't do this either make me the best sinner you've ever made or make me the best christian and i was snotting and bawling because you're desperate no wonder god didn't let me get married i would have ruined some girl's life especially you know but in that car it wasn't a supernatural presence all i did i felt something it was almost like a switch in my back literally it's just like that was weird and then i went back home the next day i'm at work and i'm not desiring to look at every woman that comes along i thought whoa something's wrong and then we have to write charts and i wasn't i just didn't you know if you don't check something oh it's just the pupils i'll just make that up i couldn't do that anymore you know what i'm saying things were changing and i got so excited that here come a girl and i was like it's not there you know the desire here oh you if you've never been delivered like that you don't know what we're talking about but it's the most awesome awesome feeling in the world to be set free amen from those things hallelujah amen and so we have to make our calling and our election sure because his bride is moved by a purely spiritual moving of god amen this is not politics this is not churchiani this is a sovereign move of god that he is doing hallelujah because we are led by the mail and in jeremiah 1 12 it says then said the lord unto me thou hast seen well for i will hasten my word to perform it if i didn't have a home where i knew that jesus christ was alive then i don't know if i would have made it amen but the devil couldn't tell me he wasn't real amen so that's why in our homes our kids must see jesus christ alive amen so when mommy or daddy they they get in a a little tiff that they just come back and they say i'm sorry i shouldn't have said that kids daddy's sorry amen ali we're on the my mom and dad a few times on the way to church would get into it and dad would get up there and say congregation i can't preach today i'm not worthy he says i had a fight with rachel and i asked for forgiveness would you forgive me you hear that yes brother god we forgive you you know but see he he promises to hasten that word to perform it he's just waiting for his bride to ask amen hallelujah i mean sometimes i'm just waiting for charity to ask for something because she never does i said don't you want a bigger wedding ring no no this is good don't you want this close or that no i'm good you know our goodwill gets targets uh overflow so we're good but see he's there waiting to hasten the word amen hallelujah and so what happens is good people and so to me no one is lost right i don't think that way you're all a potential target and so good people can come under the influence of parts of the mail that's what's deceiving right you can you can be anointed i mean a lot of us some we've been in anointings where you just hit the floor or you can feel the presence of god so strong that's good but that doesn't mean you're a believer amen so they can come under different parts of the influence of the male but we're not here to do that we are the bride of jesus christ who comes under the total influence of that anointed word amen so you can you walk out to the work and you pull open that coat and you have a big super woman or superman on your chest because brother brahma says you are part of the super race whether you're red yellow black or white and you say satan what can you do to me amen my husband says that you are defeated and i walk on your neck i love it in the old testament where joshua had all the leaders come out and they said here lay those kings out there i want you to feel what it's like to put your foot on the neck of the devil amen and that's what god wants us to start doing to get the feeling of what it's like to see devil defeated amen hallelujah praise the lord amen we're called to be one with him oh just a just a big old bear hug with jesus christ right oh brother rich you're making him sound so personal uh yeah yeah you can be respectful but personal see this whole thing is so you can ask what you will according to the word because you're going to need it asking what you will god protecting we've seen it in our church several times god giving dreams or our circumstances where the children are just about getting into something they shouldn't and god allows the parents to intervene amen that's the day we're living hallelujah praise the lord he is protecting us again right after i retired i just about died literally from a pulmonary emboli and a lot of people don't live from that you're just gone but god healed me i like that because i'm in the line of duty brother paul's in the line of duty what can and every day i say lord thank you that all my blood sugars all my blood pressure are normal lord thank you that i can eat anything lord thank you that that this is healed and that's healed and this is healed and do i do i literally see it healed absolutely not but by faith i know it's healed because he's healed all of us plenty of times but i'm speaking what the word says greater is he that is in me than he that is the bluff in this flesh amen you you you just lay that at his feet this morning and you can go on and you may still hobble you may still have that pain in the shoulder i hurt my shoulders at work and every time i'd throw an air pack on for a fire or training it they killed me but we had to visit any minister one time and he's i don't even know what he was preaching about but all of a sudden it was like god just manifested my shoulders it's like yes praise the lord you're in the line of duty today hallelujah john 15 7 it says in the amplified and if you live in me abide vitally united in me oh i'm sorry for being so long and my words remain in you and continue to live in your hearts ask whatever you will and it shall be done for you hallelujah that's the bride that's for you this morning praise the lord then he comes out from being the god of history the god of brother branham the god of your pastor it becomes the god of you fill in the blank amen praise the lord jesus he becomes the living word to you and that's exactly where we're at today it's god in you the hope of glory hallelujah amen praise the lord see this has to be the control tower for your thoughts and so when you bring your thoughts under subjection to the soul then anything is possible anything is possible for you today your finances i don't have a i don't have a financial advisor of stock i do have retirement but you know what i tell you know what i do i pay ties and give offerings wow simple as that and he blesses me beyond my comprehension oh you mean money you got all this money your name's rich you're rich no but every time we have a need it's there every time the girls need clothes then god provides them because being a guy you don't realize that there's not many stores left they're all going under it seems like the ones where you could buy clothes at and but god provides clothes for them that are modest praise the lord and so he becomes the god of the impossible and as we close here just think of this today god sent a prophet to reveal jesus christ the word and you may call me shallow but guess what brother or sister i believe every mystery i believe everything brother branham said so so what are you gonna do with that oh i just got i'm calling you shallow hmm maybe you should repent i just got done thinking oh you're kind of pentecostal well why don't you get down and repent of just saying that about me or about somebody else amen i'm a brother and if i'm so shallow how come how come people at work want to be around me how come they know that i'm a real christian how come god answers my prayer and i'm not even telling you everything else that goes on in our life how about you this morning how about you this morning and i'm not saying that to be eric but i'm trying to prove a point you i am just like you and you can have the same benefits you can be as confident in him i'm not confident in myself amen but you can be as confident in that word of god because brother brahm said our sins would ruin us if it wasn't for christ amen you have no boasting i have no boasting amen but our boast is in jesus christ the living word for our day amen i've seen them raise the dead i've seen them grow legs and i've seen them change the heart of a sinner that guy at work he was just about divorced his kids were all messed up he was messed up and god saved him did he come to our revelation no but god saved him enough to where his friend brought his guys into the the medic shack one night when we were at the hospital and he was mad he goes what did you do to sean i said nothing i just kept doing that i didn't do anything to him he goes let's get out of here he's an atheist oh he hated me but he was the one of the best captains we have and i would go into a fire anywhere with that guy see separating like he said at the first separate the church problems from a brother and sister it's not them praise the lord see our sins would ruin us if it wasn't that we are a part of christ he can't strike the church he can't kill you because you're part of christ you're part of the word you're part of the mail this morning oh if we can see that this morning if you have never accepted him as your lord and savior today you can do that right now and if you haven't noticed it's kind of chaotic outside but you don't have to be a part of that chaos you don't have to be a part of that and if if you're sick you don't have to be sick oh you better watch it brother i'm just saying what he said you don't have to be a slave to to habits anymore you don't have to be a slave to your own ideas hallelujah do you realize that when the anointed ministers up here uh many times god allows us to feel your thoughts brother paul knows that and you think you're being sneaky and so i'm trying to say is that we're in this together we're in this as believers as the bride of jesus christ and so when i came to the revelation as we close that i don't have anything to offer god that's when he says now i can work with you hey man just like just like the ministry i didn't want to minister i still don't want to minister but as a pastor you have a you have this feeling of love for the sheep and you don't want to see them go the wrong direction but what happens people they will criticize us because they don't understand us because we love you even some of my relatives they they'll criticize oh you think you're so good you think it's like no that's the farthest thing from the truth amen and so if you've never accepted christ as your savior today is the day for that come here the musicians he is here to answer your request and if you have gotten a little cold i know you say brother rich we've heard this over and over yeah but you're going to hear it today because this could be the last day we hear it but if you've you've allowed the world to suck it out of you when you're a good person you love god but he has a victory in your life for you this morning and it comes by his spirit and this word and so i've testified you can live this life no matter where you're at but we have to be with the male and the male is the only one that atonement is the only thing that will cover your your life today amen we'll have our pastor come you can accept all of this right where you're at but if your faith is where you want to get prayed for fine or you can accept it there but it's whatever our brother allows wants to do but i want us to search can we have just as i am that song but i just wanted us to give him a little bit of time so if if if god is tugging on your heart see not emotion but if god is tucking on your heart [Music] then he's the one doing it amen [Music] just come as you are just say lord i'm i'm i'm worldly i i compromise all the time but lord jesus there's something in me i do i want to serve you with all my heart but i'm going to need help right and he says i know he goes i'm here to help amen let's bow our heads and pray [Music] lord jesus [Music] this was longer than i thought it was didn't come out the way i thought it would lord but lord jesus please take it [Music] and touch the heart of the people lord these are your sheep lord and all the ministry that is here we just want to see them sold out to you lord we don't have anything to bring you lord [Music] but we have a desire and if that desire is in our soul this morning that's a supernatural occurrence you you didn't produce that and so lord god thank you for putting that into the heart of each person lord this morning thank you for the the holy spirit leading and guiding lord and god please anoint don't let people pass this opportunity to to talk to you lord to to make things right lord to to give you all of their life god to surrender everything lord their their time their money their their attitudes lord their marriage [Music] god please and lord if there's any sick among us you promise to heal us lord and i say thank you lord god in the name of jesus christ amen brother
