TRANSCRIPT
========================================
turn their Bibles to Revelation chapter 2 it's been nearly two months since we had our last uh session over the church ages um so I don't remember what was preached or eaten a couple months ago so I'll just do a quick quick review last December we talked about uh about the pergamian church age and in the in the beginning first part we talked about how the uh how the first Jewish converts came into Rome and established the First Church of Rome we'd call that and um and it was flourishing for a time but then the Roman Emperor kicked all the Jews out of Rome for a period of think about 13 years and in that period in that 13-year period um and apostasy who was able to enter the church idolatry entered the church and um after the Exile after the Jews were able to come back after the Christians were able to come back they were appalled to see what the condition that that First Church of Rome was was in and um they started a second Church of Rome which actually held trued what the um what what the gospel taught but through Satan was able to take over this First Church of Rome name and that was kind of like compared to taking over the Instagram account you can send all these messages out this is the name of the First Church of Rome and it sounds really credible when actually it was uh it was falsehood um that was kind of the that was the goal of the devil um then and still is to be able to take over uh and and to to be to to Reign from the throne that uh that was for God alone and that was what he uh succeeded in doing there in that programian church age I'm almost there there we go that looks good so Revelation Chapter 2 and we'll just read this message to the perconium church starting in verse 12. and to the angel of the church in pergamus right these things Seth he which hath the sword with two edges the sharp sword with two edges I Know Thy works and where they'll dwellest even where Satan's seat is this is a very difficult Place uh to be living and trying to be a believer and you hold fast my name and you have not denied my faith even in those days where an Antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where Satan dwells but I have a few things against you because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam and that's what we're going to talk about this evening what is this doctrine of Balaam sometimes referred to in the Bible as the Council of Balaam or the teaching of Bill talk about that but Balaam taught balak to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so we'll look at those those three things are important the stumbling block element eating things sacrificed into idolism that goes finally and ends in fornication so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans which thing I hate repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirits after the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden Manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knows saving he that receiveth it may the Lord add his uh blessing with the word this evening you may be seated foreign so we just want to take a look at how the doctrine of Balaam worked in this programian age but we'll also spend some time seeing what was the goal of the devil using Balaam back in the time of the moabites this is the allusion to that Bible story back in the Book of Numbers how it worked in the pergamian age under emperor Constantine and of course the doctrine of Balaam is still being used today and how how we can thanks to the discernment that God gives it gives us in his words see how the devil is still using some of these same strategies today um but the Brandon talks about in the uh pergamian age so this is the age when State and church were wedded together but there was the Babylonian religion that officially joined that First Church of Rome and then Satan now had access to the name of Christ he now this he's Satan is now running a church so he can issue proclamations out in Christ's name he was enthroned as God and worship this is what he had dreamed of um and I back up back before he was kicked out of heaven Isaiah 14 talks about how I want to be enthroned in place of God second Thessalonians talks about that also he wants to be seated as God in the temple of God and the Pagan Roman Emperor the Pagan Roman Empire had been dead and it was raised back in the papal room as an in prophesied also and we see that pergamus was indeed the throne and Dwelling Place of Satan brother Branham says though it was not originally the place where Satan dwelt Babylon has always been literally and figuratively his headquarters and it was in that city of Babylon the satanic worship had its origin and if you read in the church age book um in the in this chapter about the pergamian age brother Branham goes on for some pages about the pagan origins of Roman Catholicism and I just want to take a few minutes on that um After the flood the Earth was um the Earth was a purged of of sin it was a after the After the flood the Earth was just a there was it was a beautiful place it was it was it wasn't quite edinic but um it was it was there was no no sin just imagine just think about Sister Laura she had this uh um she had this terrible work environment and then she's in a completely different place how Noah and his wife hamsham and japheth they had been they've been living in the place that was completely just everything was terrible about it then they walk off the flood and this is like that's like almost like a new Heaven A New Earth everything is just sure clean is a breath of fresh air you didn't have to worry about what you were hearing what you were listening to with what you were seeing it was just beautiful and I can imagine Satan watching this because he had accomplished quite a lot in the days of Noah he was being he was being worshiped he was he was having his way on Earth as it were the sons of God and the daughters of men were mixing nobody could really see a difference nothing was such a big deal anymore and now Satan's looking that man has come again in close fellowship with God as soon as Noah and his family get off the ark Satan would have been making how would they be they've been quarantined in this Arc for 150 days at least and they come off and Satan would be holding his fist up against God why did you keep me in there so long you could have done this faster but no in this family come off and it's an altar it's worship it's communion and and and God receives their offering immediately he has this rainbow Covenant and the clowns and for say it's like oh no this is a flashback to Eden and Satan's looking at this and he's not going to let it go for very long he wants Satan's goal it's always been to to be enthroned as God and receive men's worship and he's saying hey this is getting messed up again how can I switch this back how can I reverse back to what I had before so if you read in um if um if you're in the church age book but brother Branham talks about a man named Nimrod and he's quoting from Genesis chapter 10. this is the genealogy Kush began Nimrod in this genealogy not a lot is told about the individuals who are named until you get to Nimrod you actually get a couple sentences about him Nimrod began to be a mighty one in the Earth and after the flood the animals come off the ark and one of the things that changes after the flood is that God put the fear of man in the hearts of the animals that no longer was it in the condition where they or that Lions would come and snuggle up against you and rub against you and be purring um there was a there was a roar there the men were allowed to hunt and kill the animals and the Animals had there there was a yeah there was a there was a different relationship and in the hislops to Babylons and other places it talks about how the animals they began to multiply very quickly they're on the earth and soon they had these beasts of prey who could who could hinder men as they were trying to build their cities and someone who was able to hunt well and defend the people would become a natural leader and such a man was Nimrod he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord that's why it said even this Nimrod the mighty Hunter before the Lord now this phrase before the Lord um it's not quite what we might think it means at first glance nimrod's name means Rebellion he's the first mighty one he's the first Tyrant actually he's the first Mighty Hunter and he's able to gather Villages and cities under his control and he rules them with a with an iron hand and he sets himself up he sets himself up before the Lord he's putting himself up before the Lord not not he's before the Lord serving God but he wants people to be looking at him instead of the Lord and as far as on their list of priorities it's Nimrod not God and he's leading to people then in rebellion and Satan is using Nimrod here to get himself back enthroned upon the temple of God because he doesn't like this this close communion that man has with God After the flood he builds a city in the tower there he is again he's going to be using Nimrod to interrupt this uh this close communion between God and man the Nimrod appears and pretty much every um mythology of every ethnic group he'll come up under different names but the statues will be similar they'll be different character it'll be a similar characteristics and traits that the Nimrod character will have well Nimrod leads this leads this effort there at the Tower of Babel and uh at this time at this point all the Earth is of one language of one speech After the flood God had sent man out to go and repopulate the Earth and um nimrod's folks uh they're not so sure they want to do that they want to make a city they want to make a tower whose top May reach unto heaven why are they doing this it's not for the glory of God they want to make a name for themselves let us make us a name and we want to be better prepared so that we can be in the place if God ever decides to to uh to cast Thunderbolts down at us again if he ever tries to get at us again we want to have protection so that we can be out of God's reach that's what he's trying to do so he um all of this is masked in the religious language but his purpose is Defiance against the Lord just a couple quotes from this book The Two Babylons um all tradition from the earliest times Bears testimony to the apostasy of nimrod and to his success in Leading Men away from the patriarchal faith that Faith had been passed down from Noah to Shem and and further nimrod's purpose was to deliver the people's minds from the awe and awe of God and fear of judgments of Heaven that must have rested on them while the memory of the flood was yet recent after after the flood has gone off and and Noah and his family are establishing their first families there was a I think a really a strong fear of God because everybody had seen what God was able to do and and you could you could hear the stories and the testimonies and nimrod's purpose was to create a distance between that he didn't he wanted to break men off from that patriarchal faith now um Hislop continues God must have seemed very near to the Earth After the flood is over and to maintain this Union Between Heaven and Earth which is what the rainbow symbolizes to maintain this closeness between Heaven and Earth and to keep this relationship between Heaven and Earth as close as possible that must have been the grand aim of all Who Loved God and the best interest of the human race but this close relationship between Heaven and Earth implied restraining sin and the pleasures of sin after which the natural mind continually goes after however Nimrod called this bondage avoiding sin so that we can have a close relationship with God Nimrod says that's bondage he didn't want that and that's what the devil's always going to try to twist things around nimrod's calling it bondage and he introduces apostasy of false teaching and he's encouraging a free life among his followers among those who rallied around him to separate them from holy influences that had in his view controlled them he helped them to put God and the strict spirituality of God's law at a distance and then everybody would feel they could breathe freely and walk at Liberty those are the same kinds of words and Concepts that the devil uses today because God's law was just bondage if you want to have real Freedom do what you want go out in the world have a free life breathe freely that's true Liberty it's the same thing all over again it's the strategy that Satan will be able to sit and thrown upon the temple he really wants to have which is upon your heart according to the system which Nimrod was the Grand instrument introducing men were led to believe that a real spiritual change of heart was not necessary and that even as far as any change was needful they could be regenerated by mere external means their own works it's evident that he led mankind to seek their Chief good in sensual enjoyment and showed them how they might enjoy the pleasures of sin without any fear of the wrath of a holy God that's the purpose of the Tower of Babylon we're afraid that if God would ever want to destroy the Earth with the flood because of us doing our own ways we're going to have insurance against that we're going to build a tower that is Judgment proof so that we can do whatever we want that's the purpose that was the purpose of uh of this of of nimrod there at that time and after the confusion of languages at Babel nimrod's false teaching spread over the entire world and you can see the evidence of that pretty much every culture all over the world will have some kind of flood Story the details will be different but the the basis of the story will be the same another thing you can see are some of the artwork and images of a certain element of this Nimrod story after Nimrod died his wife whose name was samiramis she had a son whom she named tamus and she claimed then that um this um this son was a miracle was it was a miraculous conception and this son was simply Nimrod reincarnated and then this father became their son who should be worshiped and the mother should be worshiped as well this is the devil's version of Genesis 3 15 how the woman is going to have a seed come and this the seed will will defeat The Serpent and he's giving the Satan's giving a substitute a fulfillment for this prophecy and says you should worship the son because that's who the fathers you should worship the mother as well it's confusion and you can see the evidence of this story you see to the upper left that's the Babylonian goddess simiramis you can see the similarity with an Indian goddess and Krishna there and another Indian goddess with an infant iswara an Egyptian goddess and then you have the Roman Catholic Mary see this artwork is all over the world because this is the nimrod's false teaching that's um that's that's gone all over the place he's trying to um to to fulfill Genesis 3 15 himself so that um there was the people the people will not be expecting any Messiah again that he is the Messiah himself and he wants to receive their worship that's his goal he wants to be enthroned and receive worship and brother Branham says that the story of nimrod he's a he's a wicked man he went out and forced all the little countries to come into one place and build this Tower he says this is where you see denominational religion being typed in in the Bible this is a some this one story that's uniting all kinds of different cultures all kinds of different religions but it's uniting them all and that is where um Satan is receiving his worship now that's kind of the background this is this is this is kind of Satan's modus operandi his his way of working he wants to work to break up any Fellowship between God and man he doesn't he he hates that God man could ever have a covenant binding them together and you can imagine um he's he's tracking things he knows who the god of who the people of God are in general terms that they're the children of of Abraham and he sees they're finally down in Egypt and he's he's having a Heyday in Egypt um killing all these uh Hebrew boys and making the the Jews work as hard as they can however when um when he sees the children of Israel exiting Egypt through a miraculous Exodus I'm sure Satan starts thinking of this this could be a problem because I don't want them to come into a covenant again he's he's seeing them led by a uh led by a pillar of fire he said how can I how can I soak in the fusion here and he successfully sows confusion there in the wilderness and they have to traip surround the Wilderness another 40 years but um there as Israel's finally getting closer and closer to the promised land he's seeing here's the people they've made it through this Wilderness I've made it as hard as I could on them but they're here they're being led by this Pillar of Fire the Throne of God the mercy seat is in the middle of their Camp the Shekinah Glory is among them and he couldn't tolerate any signs of a renewed Covenant A Renewed relationship between God and man is what he's been trying to break up sense the Garden of Eden so again he sees this happening and he's going to go right to work how can I disrupt this now the children of Israel they'd gone through the Exodus they'd gone through the Wilderness for for 40 years and the numbers uh numbers numbers 24 they have some outstanding they've made it through they're on their they're on their way right up to the up to the River Jordan um and numbers 24 they they they they defeat sihon King of the ammonites they defeat OG the king of beishan they have some pretty remarkable victories in in number of 24. and in their minds they don't see Numbers 22 23 and 24 or 25 coming that's the story of Balaam the children of Israel don't see that they've they've defeated the dog of the king of beishan they're ready to go under the promised land they don't see that balak the king of Moab is looking at this as I've got to stop this I've got to do something they don't see that he's sending Messengers to Balaam so we can curse them and that's a similar thing that they're almost there they've defeated these Kings and they abide in in there in shittim and they are so close they're right across the river from Jericho they're so close I just think for us we've gone so far and we're on the cusp of the Rapture we're almost there and they were just as oblivious to balak and balaam's conspiracy as we might be what is the devil conspiring to in Heavenly places these the story of Balaam they don't see coming they don't see it developing they've got one Victory another Victory they said onto Jericho we're almost there they encamp and shoot everything we're ready to go we're getting ready to go they don't realize that Balaam has been trying to curse them perhaps for a few weeks they don't realize that because the story of Balaam is like a parenthetical we tell the story about Israel doing Victory here Victory there and then we step back and on the other side of town Bale acting the moabites looks all this and he's not happy about it and he's already conspiring with Balaam gets people to go to bring Balaam to him they're so close and how important it is to God had given the children of Israel this prophetic gift to help them see where they were to help them to see what their task was how they should be living in that present day and at one point here they stopped listening to Moses and start listening to teaching of Balaam and it's the worst mistake they ever made yet they were so close I didn't realize how close they were they thought the next Bible story was going over the Jordan River but it wasn't you know so we're getting ready to see Balaam here and just by way of review this doctrine of Balaam has three parts balance Doctrine consists first of stumbling blocks and then eating things sacrificed to idols and then committing fornications it starts so just with simple stumbling blocks I want to pay attention how that works and we'll notice how Balaam approaches his decision making when he's invited by balak to come and curse the people because we see these stumbling blocks balaam's own thought processes as he makes decisions how he speaks to God these these things are stumbling him up as well and he doesn't this is just how he operates and he's going to be teaching other people to work this way as well we know the story that uh balak sends Messengers to Balaam and they come to Balaam and say to himach the son of zippoor let nothing I pray You Hinder thee from coming unto me for I will promote you under a very great honor I'll do whatever you say just come I pray you curse these people let nothing hinder you whatever you want nice house nice car whatever you want I will provide it and Balaam is really good at talking The Talk because he says all the right things here Balaam answers and says to the Servants of balak you know if balak could give me his entire house full of silver of gold I still couldn't go beyond the word of the Lord my God I couldn't do less or more he's so good that he's saying all the right things here for some reason he says but why don't you wait just this night that I will get the confirmation from the Lord I will know what the Lord will say unto me more God had already told him don't go he told them he couldn't go that he couldn't go over God's command yet he still says maybe I missed it I don't know he hears all these things that are being offered to him and says my why would this be wrong why would it be wrong to have all these these blessings blessings are a good thing shouldn't I mean God leads through open doors right and this seems like an open door and what could I what good could I do with this but he's he's got wrong principles for decision making and these are stumbling him the teaching of Balaam is first of all in practice God's word is just advice he will say I can only do what God says to do I can't go beyond I can't go more or less than what God says to he says all the right things so if you just listen to what Balaam says amen this guy's got it right he holds directly to the truth if you just listen but if you watch how we apply says how he lives his own life God's word is just advice I can go and ask God a second time I can go ask him a third time I can get a second third fourth fifth opinion of what God says because in the multitude of counters or safety right God's word is not absolute for him and that's a stumbling block when we say yeah this is what it says in the app is that really right because yeah if I were to do this thing that I might not feel completely right about yeah maybe I'm just being a little a little legalistic on something here because I were to do this I could really be blessed it'd be a really nice thing because Balaam also is teaching that blessings are the truest indicators of what's right that's what balaam's thinking and this is going to trip him up it trips the Israelites up and they can trip us up because this is this this and these are these are principles that are still very much in play today people can talk the talk really really well but the Bible is the word of God and everything but when it actually comes down to it they'll do what they want but they'll still have their praise and worship on those of this or that on still talk about being Christians be on their Instagram Channel talk about this or that and they talk about Christians but it's word isn't an absolute to them and that is a modern manifestation of the doctrine of Balaam and blessings might the greatest blessing nowadays is feeling good about yourself because would God want me to feel bad about myself so if I can do this and feel good about it that must be the will of God because God gives me a conscience and if I feel all right about it that must be just fine but you know what our consciences can be defiled Titus talks about that and nowadays with the culture we live in it's very easy for our conscience to be defiled so we can't listen just to what our Conscience Says we have to go back as our is this what God's word says and that is the absolute but um it is it's nice to channel the culture every now and then we know who this lady is Right Oprah Winfrey she says if something feels right I do it if it feels wrong I don't you've got to be willing to take your chances doing stuff that may look crazy to other people or not doing something that looks right to others but feels wrong to you because you just just do it if it feels right if you get good results good vibes from it that must be right just do it if it feels good do it that is that's the way people live today both inside and outside of church unfortunate because this doctrine of Balaam is still there because Baylor thought God wouldn't want to keep me from honor or riches Woody so he asks God again God can I go back can I go Lord can I go and God says yes you may but you must say exactly what I say but you may go and here's where we get this concept of the permissive will and a lot of people love the permissive will because they say God said I could do it so it's going to be the right thing and we'll just see how this idea of the permissive will plays out because it can be very deceptive but we don't want to play around with God's permissive will brother Branham says just speaking to the second stumbling block of the doctrine of Balaam you can't judge God by Prosperity the world prospers but that doesn't mean the world right the richest man in the world is he being prospered yeah he's doing a lot of he's prospering does that mean that he's right no Balaam prospered by the brother you judge God by his word he keeps his word identifies the truth as long as you live never forget this God doesn't change his mind yet he will bless he'll let you go with his permissive will but you won't change his mind he won't change his plan he won't change his word for you no sir you've got to change you can't have God's word match your experience you've got to have your experience match God's word and that's the big thing to do because we think oh the permissible is all work together for good in the end right that's not how it works because if I could say it's my it's God's will for those row of chairs to be moved five feet forward and I ask these guys in the front row to do that and they say sure we'll do that but that's a lot of work and no they don't end up doing it they don't do it they're going off and I let them go on I don't strike them with Thunderbolts because they're not doing it I let them go off do their own thing but my perfect will hasn't changed I asked somebody else to go do it and they do it so they're Disobedience going into the permissive will does not hinder God's perfect will from taking place that's what that means when we say that the permissive will will work out into God's perfect will it won't keep God's perfect will from happening but it doesn't mean that your role in that perfect will might be the same it can sound very very um very confusing and tempting but we don't want to mess with God's permissive will so we know the story that Balaam and Bala went to several mountains Israel is completely oblivious to this they don't realize what's happening they're probably making plans to go into the for the next campaign but balak and Balaam they're trying to throw curses over Israel from different locations none of it works and then after time and time again balak just has had enough his anger is kindled against Balaam he smites his hands together and says I wanted to promote you to honor but God has kept you back from honor that's what the devil still trying to say to us today when he invites us to compromise invite us to go back and have a relationship with the worldly friend or whatever he says God is keeping it back from good things God is keeping you back from a good life God is keeping you back from this that's the same thing he's saying today God was protecting balamir he was protecting him and God's protecting us till today but I can just imagine though Balaam goes home he's uh this is this is kind of their last words here and the balaam's going home he says man it just didn't really sit right that last conversation with balak and he was still thinking about all those house full of gold and silversmen did I not did I get that wrong God because I don't feel this doesn't sit well I had to go back and see if we can get this better and you guys go back and here you've got he goes back and he and balak talk and Balaam hatches this plan he can't curse Israel but he can get Israel to start doing things that will bring a curse upon themselves and that is the fruit of the doctrine of Balaam and the second Corinthians chapter 10 Paul references this very stories as these things in the Old Testament took place as examples for us so that we won't desire evil like they did and all these things happen to them for an example they were written down for our instruction on whom the end of the ages has come just like to the children of Israel that at the very end of their Journey at the edge of the Jordan River ready to go in and we are the End of the Age it has come we're on the border of Eternity ready to go in and these things written for our examples so that we will not um lust after evil things so that we will take heed let him who thinks he stands take lest he fall and numbers 25 here Israel Abode and chittim this is the verse that happens right after Balaam leaves balak and then somehow Balaam comes back and that's where it says the people somehow begin to commit whoredom with the daughters Moab how'd it happen he says they called The People Under The sacrifices of their gods and the people that eat and bowed down to their gods and Israel joined himself unto Baal peor which is a place right there where they have that feast and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel and they were so close so very close and later on um in the Book of Numbers it looked looks back to this and we see why did they fall because Balaam caused the children of Israel to sin it was his counsel that caused them to go to these feasts and finally commit whoredom with the children of Moab but I wondered I looked up what Baal pure actually means this is interesting and Baal means Lord and pior means Gap Lord of The Gap and I got to thinking about it that this sounds a little bit like Lord of the loophole hmm and a loophole is just a way you always there there are rules you're always looking for loopholes people do what you want without breaking any of the rules and I just thought a loophole where all the way people can always a lot of Christians might look like like this these are these money lenders looking for loopholes to make profits but sometimes Christians today could be looking like these sharks they want to live their life looking for loopholes excuses to do what they want to do and it's looked at this this loophole it looks very inviting because yeah I can I can do what I want right here anyway but eventually this loophole it's going to resem if you if you keep going through the loopholes like this it's going to resemble a noose in the end and that's what happens to the children of Israel they want to do what they wanted to do they they were convinced that they could because after all Balaam taught them that God's word is really good God's word gives good advice but you know what Moses doesn't have the option on on on on on Truth get a second opinion get the third opinion and you know what blessings are great and what's the big deal Moab and Israel we're we're cousins we just want to invite you over to have like a house touring party this is like a family reunion can't we bury the hatchet lot and Abraham a quarreled long ago when that was too bad but you know what over the years we've been able to develop ways to handle such quarrels and we can get over this we can settle this we can have we can have Fellowship welcome welcome to the neighborhood kind of thing and the teaching of Balaam this next part is going to be bringing people to sing sacrifice to idols it's the stumbling blocks that Balaam lays first that God's word is just advice and blessings are the truest indicator of God's leadership these stumbling blocks are what allowed the children of Israel to make these steps to even go to this feast in the first place and the teaching of Balaam says The end justifies the means we want to have a bigger group we want to be able to appeal better to the community we want to be able to be more inclusive who wants to be exclusive we want to we want to draw the circle bigger and include lots and lots more people these things sound really good it's a good end so to accomplish this end we can start incorporating different methods that Moses never used different methods are great because the end makes it right but you know what different methods have a way of aborting the end in the long run and changing the end in the long run and these forms of different religious worship actually functions as a smoke screen this great banquet that Moab set up is a housewing party welcomed the new neighbors to the block bury the hatchet between Abraham and lot and everything this was just a smoke screen because Satan was really just trying to interrupt and break apart the Covenant relationship between Israel and between God he didn't want them to be led by this Pillar of Fire anymore you don't have this close Fellowship anymore that was the ultimate goal foreign age as well he just wanted to get himself enthroned there upon this Temple he wanted to be to be worshiped as God and didn't matter how it happened Constantine said hey let's just go ahead and uh we can we can rename some of these feast days there used to be pagans feast days just give him Christian names you can come to we we can change a little little different things we'll just call it Christian and we'll make it Christian and you'll have freedom in the Empire who wouldn't want that and this is just a way and he would start changing the methods to have this religious worship changing the methods of religious worship to achieve this this good and everybody wanted but out of bounds methods have a way of leading you to Out of Bounds ends and that's what Balaam ended up doing because the true purpose of the devil is still to exalt himself as God there in the temple of God acting like he is God and there are a couple of uh brother Brandon has some really nice concise summaries of the doctrine of bail and like this first one the doctrine of Balaam go ahead do it your way Moses I'm you would I you have to we don't know what conversations took place in the camp of Israel what Moses tried to say to the people to dissuade them I'm sure there were many conversations but eventually Moses couldn't keep them back and God said go ahead do it your way but it's not going to be good do it your way and Bale and his Doctrine was just right for this group of people it met their taste exactly it appealed to them and this takes you right back to what Nimrod was trying to do right after the flood this way that God's trying to teach to preserve a close relationship between Heaven and Earth that's bondage we want to break that bondage and I will lead I'll teach you to leave a sensual life you have freedom you'll have Liberty that's true freedom just completely reversing it in the doctrine of balance doing the exact same thing when Satan is witnessing a New Covenant relationship as the people are coming right to their Promised Land the doctrine of Balaam what was it it was this idea to have this great Festival up there the Feast of belpure it was a feast to worship and Moab knew enough about abrahamic tradition how to how to offer sacrifices they could have the right form on their sacrifices they could do all those things that was just a smoke screen to get Israel to come and eat Meats sacrifice to idols it's the same thing Constantine did and he's uh the statements we're all just the same there's no difference between us we're all just Christians it was what what can be said today there's no difference it's all it's all good um God's a God of all Races we're the same after all that's what counts and he messes all that counts amongst the churches today is is members if we can have bigger numbers bigger members membership uh more more success that justifies anything we do to achieve that goal but different methods are going to lead to a different goal in the long run now this eating thing sacrifice to idols brother Brian says I don't say that this really means they were literally eating meat sacrificed to idols that there was a there was a an image of Baal there in the camp and they come and they they saute all the meat there before Bale and they and then they give it to the children of Israel it doesn't have to mean it doesn't have to mean that Paul didn't make such a big deal about the he says eating Meats those Idols are are are nothing Paul says the New Testament just a matter of conscience but when he says I see this in the same light I see the words of the Lord except to eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you it wasn't literally calling his disciples to be cannibals man shall not live by bread alone by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God you can see that eating is actually partaking in a spiritual sense so necessarily that they're down eating these steaks that have been offered to bail but they're per they're having Fellowship where there was no basis for Fellowship to be had they're going off and having Fellowship on the devil's territory they're going off and having Revival meetings in the local bar and they're getting on the devil's territory there and that's just not a good thing and gradually one thing led to another it says that is there any Moses is there any Commandment that says we can't do this and Moses probably was able to name some things I'm sure he was but yeah but that's for a little different setting a little different setting and they were able to carve themselves at a loophole so they could go down and have this Feast with their new neighbors but remember Baal the devil is the lord of the loophole so they found their way people who want to do wrong will always find a reason to do wrong they might even find a quote or a Bible verse to justify it and they'll say God's letting me do it I even got a raise because after I started working Wednesday nights and Sundays God this is this is fine don't sweat it I will stream anyway it'll be fine God's not the Lord the loophole God's the lord of the clear leadership the devil's the lord of the loophole so we can justify our way but that doesn't mean it's right and very gradually um it started with just stumbling blocks thinking ah God's word is just advice I can really do what I want I'm being blessed I'm getting good things from these decisions I'm making it must be God's will then it must be fine and then they start fellowshipping with with folks and being an atmosphere they really have no business to be in and then it goes from one thing to another before too long they're actually committing fornication which they never would have thought that they would be doing but sin as a way of taking you farther than you wanted to go keeping you longer than you wanted to stay costing more than you want to pay and the doctor of balance kind of leads you leads you leads you belong until you you're trapped the doctrine of Balaam leads to this fornication brother Branham continues in the church age book he says after uh that he says you can see the eating is actually partaking in a spiritual sense he said so when these people were bowing to the images lighting candles using pagan holidays that were renamed for Christians Saints confessing their sins to men all of which belong to the devil's religion he says they were partakers with the devil and not of the Lord Satan had substituted something else given a good purpose to it and then just whitewashed it something that sounded good but they were still on idolatry whether they admitted it or not they could talk all they wanted the altars and the Innocents are only to remind them of the prayers of the Lord and whatever they think it means and they can pray before the image they say it's just for the sake of emphasis when they confess their sins of the priests it's really just the God they're doing in their hearts and all these things they can say what they want but they're still partaking in the Babylonian satanic religion joining themselves to Idols committing spiritual fornication so Constantine here is substituting that's us when we hear what Constantine did renaming the holidays um all these different things that sounds that that sounds strange to us we would come up with that idea but that was not too strange in the culture they were in all costing is doing is the prevalent ideas of the culture and making them acceptable to the to to the church and going forward with it he's just substituting the religion of the culture for the gospel giving it Christian names giving a Christian a whitewash over all the mythology and inviting all the Bishops to unite with it all he was was combining the religion of the culture with Christianity and he still wants to do that today I've shared this uh this statement from William Booth before but he's looking at the 20th century he says the chief danger that confronts the coming Century will be religion without the Holy Ghost Christianity without Christ forgiveness without repentance salvation without regeneration politics without God heaven without hell they've taken the gospel out but they still call it religion still call it Christianity but there's no Holy Ghost there's no Christ there's no repentance but he wants to have good feelings he wants to have morality all these things but they're substituting something else for the gospel and he's seeing he's not saying it this way he's seeing the doctrine of Balaam coming in and he's seeing the the culture is going to take over Christianity and he's speaking really really clearly about this and I've shared before this most what most churches what many many churches talk about what many people want from from church nowadays is just um moralistic teaching therapeutic teaching that involves God somewhere really just just be nice to each other if we can just be nice then we're Christians right that's the essence of Christianity just love your neighbor just be nice and he says basically these these uh forget the article but um the tenets of this be nice religion is hey God made the world and watches over it God's up there he wants us to be good nice and fair he wants you to be happy and feel good about yourself if you don't feel good about yourself you're probably making a decision wrong somewhere but you know what when you come to your opinion you don't feel good about yourself when you hear about your sin you don't feel good about yourself when you hear about hell and judgment you don't feel good about yourself but that's the point we want to be able to sing Just As I Am Without One Plea we come to the altar just as we just as I am that God accepts us just as we are so we can leave just as we were but that's not the gospel he loves us too much for that he doesn't want us to say as we are he wants to transform us so that we can become what he wants us to be but we want to stay just as we are nice people will live happily ever after and God's cool with giving you your space but if you really need him he'll be there for you basically in this uh religion God is just a combination of a butler and therapist he does what you want him to do and makes you feel good about it in the process he's on call takes care of any problems that arise professionally helps people feel better about themselves not any real change doesn't get too personally involved in the process this is the religion of the culture creeping into the church just like the idolatry of that fourth Century crept into the church because God sees that there's a renewed God wants to sorry this the devil sees that God is trying to restore his Covenant with his people he's trying to restore fellowship with his people and they're almost into the promise saying I want to break that up now he's doing the very same thing he did in the days of Noah and the days of nimrod doing he did the same thing he did in the days of Moses in the days of Balaam same thing in the days of constant he's doing the same thing now so he could interrupt break apart that Fellowship and I just want to share a quotation from a a book called radical this was published in 2004 I Believe by a uh um I think he's a Baptist Minister David Platt and his thesis is that you are not worshiping the Jesus of the Bible that's what he's arguing in the book he says we've started to redefine Christianity we're giving in to the dangerous temptation to take the Jesus of the Bible and twist him into a version of Jesus that we're more comfortable with a nice middle class American Jesus a Jesus who doesn't mind materialism and who would never call us to give away everything we have a Jesus who would not expect us to forsake our closest relationships that he receives all our affection a Jesus who is fine with nominal devotion who just says I'm a Christian but does not infringe on our Comforts because after all he loves us just the way we are Jesus wants us to be balanced he wants us to avoid dangerous extremes and who for that matter wants us to avoid danger altogether we were wanting a Jesus who brings us comfort and prosperity as we live out our Christian spin on the American dream but do you and I realize what we're doing at this point we are molding Jesus into our image that's idolatry he's beginning to look a lot like us because after all that's who we're most comfortable with and the danger now is that when We Gather in our church buildings to sing and lift up our hands in worship we may not actually be worshiping the Jesus of the Bible instead we may be worshiping ourselves when I read this I think back to Second Thessalonians 2 where Satan is as God sitting in the temple of God thing making people worship him as though he is God right back to that and brother Branham says this very same thing decades earlier as the God of this world today the worshiped person of this world today is Satan and people are ignorant of worshiping Satan but it's Satan impersonating himself as the church they worship Satan thinking they're worshiping God through the church but that's the way Satan's done it and when I heard this quote growing up I thought man that's hard I don't see how that could be how it is and even people in denominational circles are awake to this this isn't right this isn't right we're trapped in the wrong system this is not the right way because we're not we don't want to worship an American Dream we want god of the Bible's different but brother Brandon pegged it decades ago because we we people are recreating Jesus in their own image and I was texting Sherry earlier this last week or so and she's got the song making up her own God as we go and his love means approval Mercy now condoned Murphy doesn't just forgive us it condones affirms what we're doing his loving kindness means never saying no God wouldn't say no because no hurts my feelings and God wants me to be happy we're making up her own God as we go his will means you're happy Christians always glow so if you're not glowing you need to adjust what you're doing doing what feels right must be good for the soul for making up her own God as we go let's be real sometimes we go by what we feel thinking God must think the way we do no his thoughts are so far above our thoughts we can't comprehend them we just say yes Lord lay aside the word let the conscience be your guide so you can feel right about it this making up your own version of Christ we blend in to win them that's the doctrine of Balaam worships just to show we're sharing in Jesus the Bible would know we're just making up our own God as we go peace is the answer God just wants you to have peace truth rocks the boat go tell the pastor to stop preaching because it's interrupting your peace just go with the flow we're making up our own God as we go and his ways are higher higher than we'll ever know so let's wake up don't make up our own God as we go she pegged in that song that song is describing the doctrine of Balaam I just want to close with one further point the doctrine of Balaam we can say that's really the permissive will of God charading as though it were the perfect will of God and on um sometimes we hear that we hear the quote um brother Brandon says and does God ever change his mind about the word if the people won't walk in this perfect will he does have a permissive will he'll let you walk in notice he permits it all right but he'll make it work out for his glory in his perfect will and I can imagine somebody's read that quote he says I can just breathe a sigh of relief because if I've made the if if I if I've missed God's perfect will he'll bring me right about right back into his perfect will everything will be all right and I think we can have a wrong idea what that means because really what the permissive will does it shows what's in our hearts it's going to show that you know we really don't want to do what God wants we really are looking for an excuse to do what we want to do the permissive will is really just exposing our own heart but we can take that statement the permissive will makes way for the perfect will so I can go ahead and take that risk because God will lead me back anyway because yeah all things work together for good right and God's a happily ever after kind of God right but I just want to emphasize this permissive will is dangerous we shouldn't approach you think oh God will make it work everything all right for me it's not that way he lets us go in the permissive will he did to the children of Israel here's the my people would not hearken to my voice Israel would none of me so I finally gave up under their own hearts lusts and they walked in their own councils and the Hosea he says Ephraim is joined unto Idols let him alone anybody any parent ever have their kids begged for something long enough long enough long I finally you're just sick of it go for it have fun go play and you said yeah go for it and you know they're gonna you know and you're doing it you're so upset and they're gonna it's not going to work out well for you just sick of it go for it you do that but that that that's not the perfect will by any means you just give them up to go do what you want brother Brandon says um he has a permission he has a permissive will now there is where the trouble Lays so we don't want to take this idea of the permissive Wellness oh it'll be fine in the end no we go to the permissive real route we're stepping into trouble we try to work on God's permissive will and he will permit it he says and he will make it work out to glorify his perfect will in some way let's keep on talking about this says he will give you the desire of your heart he promised that you know that he promised to give you the desire of your heart but you know what let your desire be the word of God let your desire be his will never your own will because if we keep asking God for something and he keeps saying no I don't want my own will because that'll be a rough way to go uh further in that same message as God ever changed his mind about his word he says he he Grant yes he grants you permission to to permit your will he gives a permissive will knowing what's in your heart knowing that you say well brother Brandon I do so on so and it doesn't bother me God blesses me every day I sing in the spirit I dance in the spirit hey he'll permit it if you keep wanting to go that way go ahead he'll permit it go ahead but you'll make it a stumbling block like Balaam did so this these statements together it seems like yeah his perfect will makes the way permissible makes way for the perfect will all things work together for good so God's is going to make it happily ever after ending for me that God is going to be like a Disney kind of God we can do whatever we want and we'll end up in the palace at the end anyway that's not how it is it sounds really good sounds really deceptive but that's not how that works in Esther chapter 4 and verse 14. um this is when Mordecai shares with her the plans of Haman it says would you need to go and talk to the king and that says I can't do that he hasn't invited me and Mordecai says if you hold your peace at this time enlargement Deliverance will arise from the to the Jews from another place you hold your peace God will let you hold your peace you have a choice you hold your peace that's fine you do that God will still take care of us your choice isn't going to interrupt God's perfect will of preserving the Jews that's not going to happen but you've chosen your role in it who knoweth whether you're come to the kingdom for such a time as this so our steps into God's permissive will won't prevent his perfect will from being accomplished but our time in the permissive will could affect our role and the unfolding of God's perfect will and that's important the impermissive will is nothing to be trifled with don't embrace the permissive Wills oh yeah it's still a form of God's will no he's letting you do what you want to do but the devil is the lord of the loophole and you'll pay for it and by God's grace he might bring you back but don't play around with that and then the at the end of the church age book in the last chapter um brother Branham talks about this real real clear he says today we have that very same thing women preachers organizations false Doctrine people worshiping God manifesting the spirit going right on like Balaam did claim it God spoke to them even when the commission receives his opposite to the revealed word I won't deny God spoke to them but it was just like when he spoke to Balaam that second time he knew that Balaam wanted his own heart's desire above the word and he gave it to him all the while in the end God was having his own way even so today God tells folks to go ahead in their own Hearts desires for they've already rejected the word but the will of God will be done regardless and that's the clearest expression I have found about the permissive will of God that will still make a way for God's perfect will to be glorified but that doesn't mean that we'll be right there if we choose the person above it we'll have an unvarnished place in there the permissible of God is nothing to be toyed with good so I just want to close we can be thankful for prophetic insights that we can see what the strategy of the Yemen if what the strategy of the enemy is he knows we're right on the cusp of the promise and right on the cusp of Eternity and just like for the children of Israel those three chapters where Balaam was trying to curse them that was parenthetical they didn't even see it they were making preparations getting ready to go across the river but they had prophetic Insight they had somebody there who was telling them don't do this don't do this that was that was Moses and we also have a discernment that's able to show us what's wrong with these kinds of statements the church world today is all they want is members brother Branham says the Balaam Doctrine going around today were just the same we're all Christians trying to bring Unity by politics and organization only the word of God brings Unity but when we know the time we're living in the end time evangelist message is not numbers the end time evangelist message is Malachi for it's a restoring that goes forth It's to jerk people out of the Creeds and bring them back to the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers the beauty of the church has not been the structure that's not the numbers the beauty of the church is in the character of the people and that's why God brings a word to restore people to the character that he wants them to have and we have a prophetic gift like this we can see the the scriptures that are playing out for our day what our rule is and we can see oh this is a strategy here to try to break our fellowship with God to break God's covenant relationship with us I want nothing to do with that as nice as it might sound it's not it because Balaam could make his words sound really nice but gra all the things he was trying to do were just a smoke screen to break people's fellowship with God so I just say just like Israel was right on the cusp of it in the promised land so are we and that just holds fast to the word that God's given us don't make up our own God as we go holds fast as God reveals himself in his word we don't want to change God to fit us God wants to change us go to God as we are so he can transform us into whom he wants us to be amen that's what we have for this evening trust you is a blessing Let's uh let's pray and I'll just uh write the musicians to come and brother Gideon Heavenly Father we thank you for this this example of Balaam and the children of Israel and just uh interesting how often this story is uh is reminded is that reminders are given of it throughout the New Testament multiple times just warnings with what happened at bill pior Lord I pray that you would help us to seek your perfect will o God Lord that we would have you be Lord of our hearts and we wouldn't be seeking out some loophole some excuse to do our own Will O God Lord I pray that you would help us to have clear discernment of what the what the culture is trying to uh to preach at us and that we would say no I don't want that I want to see exactly what God's word has Lord father I pray give us a greater hunger for that and Lord if someone here at night hasn't cracked open the their Bible or a message book or spent time with you or they pray that even this evening or in the morning they'd begin that that you just gradually break off the the skills from their eyes we could see clearly the day that we're living and we might know how we should live oh God Lord I ask your blessing upon each family in Jesus name
