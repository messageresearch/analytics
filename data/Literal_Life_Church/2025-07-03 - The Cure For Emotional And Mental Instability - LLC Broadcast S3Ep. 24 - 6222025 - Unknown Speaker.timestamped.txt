[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine

[0:21] May God bless you, my friend. May the
[0:23] music and message encourage you today.
[0:26] [Music]
[0:38] Sometimes I wonder, is he faithful?
[0:43] Does he see me in my trouble? Does he
[0:48] understand?
[0:49] [Music]
[0:50] Sometimes I question if he's able.
[0:55] Can he rescue? Can he save me again and
[1:00] again?
[1:02] But when I look back,
[1:06] did he move every mountain? Did he part
[1:10] every sea? Yes, he did.
[1:14] So yes, he came. Oh, did he defeat the
[1:19] darkness? Did he deliver me? Yes, he
[1:24] did.
[1:26] So yes, he can. Oh yes, he did.
[1:32] So yes, he can.
[1:35] Sometimes those voices try to tell me
[1:40] I'm forgotten and I'm falling too far
[1:44] from his hand. But I know what kind of
[1:48] God he is. And I'm trusting in his
[1:51] promises. I'm believing and I'm singing.
[1:56] Yes, he can. Oh, did he move every
[2:01] mountain? Did he part every sea? Yes, he
[2:06] did.
[2:07] So, yes, he can. Oh, did he defeat the
[2:13] darkness? Did he deliver me? Yes, he
[2:17] did.
[2:19] So, yes, he did. Oh yes he did.
[2:25] Oh yes he can. Cuz I've seen too much
[2:30] now I can't deny.
[2:33] I know he's come through every single
[2:38] time.
[2:40] From the beginning until the end. He
[2:45] did. He will. He can.
[2:52] Did he move every mountain? Did he part
[2:56] every sea? Yes, he did.
[3:00] So yes, he can.
[3:03] Did he defeat the darkness? Did he
[3:07] deliver me? Yes, he did.
[3:11] So yes, he can.
[3:15] Did he rule every mountain? Did he part
[3:19] every sea? Yes, he did.
[3:23] So yes, he did.
[3:27] Did he defeat the darkness? Did he
[3:30] deliver me? Yes, he did.
[3:35] Oh yes, he can. Oh yes, he did.
[3:40] Oh yes, he can.
[3:44] Yes, he did.
[3:47] Yes, he can.
[3:51] Thank you, Lord.
[3:53] Luke chapter 21 and uh verse 25.
[3:59] Luke 21 and verse 25. And there shall be
[4:03] signs in the sun and in the moon and in
[4:06] the stars and upon the earth distress of
[4:10] nations with perplexity the sea and the
[4:14] waves roaring men's hearts failing them
[4:17] for fear and for looking after those
[4:19] things which are coming on the earth.
[4:22] One place in one of the gospels says
[4:24] looking at the fearful sights. It's
[4:26] termed fearful sights and looking after
[4:28] those things which are coming on the
[4:30] earth. For the powers of heaven shall be
[4:33] shaken. So we have words like distress.
[4:36] We have perplexity. We have fear in
[4:39] men's hearts. Their hearts failing them
[4:41] for fear. We have fearful sights that
[4:43] are watching. How can they see fearful
[4:45] sights constantly in front of them
[4:46] through television and through their
[4:48] phones? There's fearful sights that
[4:50] brings more fear and perplexity and
[4:52] stress. Verse 27. And then shall they
[4:55] see the Son of Man coming in in a cloud
[4:57] with power and great glory. And when
[4:59] these things begin to come to pass, then
[5:01] look up and lift up your heads, for your
[5:04] redemption drawth nigh. And he spake to
[5:07] them a parable. Behold the fig tree and
[5:09] all the trees. When they now shoot
[5:11] forth, ye see and know of yourselves
[5:14] that summer is now nigh at hand. So the
[5:17] fig tree is typed as Israel and all the
[5:19] other trees. In other words, everything
[5:21] begins to come into this bloom and this
[5:24] summertime and begins to come into its
[5:26] full manifestation. All things bad or
[5:29] good come to full manifestation at the
[5:32] end time. And when we see them come to
[5:35] full manifestation, when we see the fig
[5:37] tree Israel become a nation and come
[5:39] under nation and now looking for their
[5:41] revival. When we see all of the nations
[5:44] and all the spirits come to a head and
[5:46] manifest, all the trees coming into that
[5:49] manifestation, then we know we're close
[5:51] to the end.
[5:53] Jesus said this, "So likewise, ye, when
[5:55] you see these things come to pass, know
[5:58] ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at
[6:00] hand. Verily, I say unto you, this
[6:02] generation shall not pass till all be
[6:04] fulfilled." Look at this now. Heaven and
[6:07] earth shall pass away, but my words
[6:10] shall not pass away.
[6:14] This is the generation that will observe
[6:17] and watch heaven and earth passing away.
[6:22] But when we watch that pass away, then
[6:24] we always know that there's one thing
[6:26] that will endure and not become corrupt.
[6:29] How many know that every system is
[6:31] becoming corrupt?
[6:33] But there's one thing that can't
[6:34] corrupt, and that's the word of God. The
[6:37] only thing we have left that won't
[6:38] corrupt is the word of God. But will be
[6:41] the generation that watches as heaven,
[6:43] earth, and things begin to pass away and
[6:46] things begin to fall apart. I want you
[6:48] to notice as I preach out of verse 34
[6:50] this morning, and take heed, there's
[6:52] this warning to watch yourself. Be
[6:54] watchful. Take heed to yourselves. It's
[6:57] a personal thing. In this hour, take
[7:00] heed to yourselves, lest at any time
[7:02] your hearts become overcharged with
[7:06] surfing and drunkenness and cares and
[7:09] worries of this life, and so that day
[7:11] come upon you unawares.
[7:15] For as a snare shall it come on all them
[7:18] that dwell on the face of the whole
[7:21] earth. I want to speak this morning on
[7:24] the cure for emotional and mental
[7:27] instability.
[7:30] God never left us without a cure.
[7:34] But you can see Jesus said in verse 34
[7:37] that we could be affected and our
[7:40] emotional life would be depleted because
[7:43] of the fear in in this generation. all
[7:46] will be affected by it
[7:48] and we can become emotionally and
[7:51] mentally depleted
[7:54] but God
[7:57] but God
[7:59] provides for his people in that hour he
[8:01] gives the cure. So I'm looking here this
[8:04] morning at Jesus depiction of our day
[8:07] and uh prophesying and giving us exactly
[8:10] the characteristics of our time. And we
[8:13] can see a last warning here that our
[8:15] hearts not become weighed down. When he
[8:18] says overcharged, it means our hearts
[8:21] become weighed down. Our hearts become
[8:23] drained. Our spirits become emotionally
[8:26] drained. And uh we should be on guard
[8:29] for that as Christians. He's not just
[8:31] talking to everybody, but particularly
[8:33] Christians. He's speaking directly to us
[8:35] because he says there, if you if you
[8:37] catch it, take heed to yourselves. It's
[8:40] a personal thing that that your hearts
[8:42] that your hearts he's speaking to the
[8:44] elect that your hearts, your spirit,
[8:48] your emotions don't become depleted and
[8:51] drained. Be on guard for that. In the in
[8:54] one of the amplified versions, it says,
[8:56] "Take heed to yourselves and be on
[8:58] guard." Because some of these words, you
[9:00] know, uh I always have to look up when
[9:02] it says surfing. Your heart's
[9:04] overcharged with surfing. I'm I'm
[9:06] thinking of surfing.
[9:09] Drunkenness. I understand. But, you
[9:11] know, okay. So, don't get into surfing
[9:14] and being drunk. It It's deeper than
[9:16] that. You know, I don't think your heart
[9:18] could become overcharged and burdened
[9:20] with when you're out surfing.
[9:23] So that's why you have to get up your
[9:24] Bible and look up these words sometimes.
[9:26] So the amplified says, "But take heed to
[9:28] yourselves and be on guard, lest your
[9:31] hearts be overburdened and depressed,
[9:33] weighed down with g with the giddiness
[9:37] and headache and nausea of
[9:40] self-indulgence,
[9:43] drunkenness,
[9:45] and worldly worries and cares pertaining
[9:48] to the business of this life.
[9:52] We live there, friends. This is dead on
[9:55] of what we go through to deplete us
[9:57] emotionally.
[9:59] So, I'm going to read it again. That we
[10:01] become depressed and weighed down with
[10:03] the giddiness and the headache and the
[10:05] nausea of self-indulgence, drunkenness,
[10:08] cuz that's what the world world teaches
[10:10] us to be. In other words, they have
[10:12] things to answer to this scare. They
[10:15] have things to answer to this fear. When
[10:17] we're emotionally feeling shaky and
[10:19] instable, then they have answers, but
[10:21] they're temporary answers. They're
[10:23] temporary fixes for it. And so, so, so
[10:26] now the headache, the giddiness, the
[10:29] nausea of self-indulgence, that's what
[10:31] the the world wants you to do.
[10:32] Drunkenness and worldly worries and
[10:35] cares pertaining to the business of the
[10:37] of this life, lest that day come upon
[10:40] you suddenly like a trap or a noose. And
[10:43] the last verse in 35 says, "For as a
[10:45] snare shall it come." So now a snare is
[10:48] a trap for an animal. It gets you
[10:50] snared. It gets your heart snared. It
[10:52] gets you under a bind. Can you say amen?
[10:55] And the world's going to do that. But
[10:56] believers got to say, "Wait a minute
[10:58] now. I'm not supposed to be bound by
[11:00] anything. This is just about time for
[11:02] redemption. I'm supposed to look up and
[11:03] lift my head up. Can you say amen? I'm
[11:06] not like the statistics to get burdened
[11:09] down by this. I have a source that I can
[11:11] go to. I have a fountain that I can
[11:14] drink from.
[11:18] My main focus this morning is to tell us
[11:21] that we when we get emotionally depleted
[11:24] and instable emotionally and mentally
[11:27] that we are not to buy into the idea
[11:30] that there's somehow no fountain in God
[11:33] that can get fill us up.
[11:38] We are not to give up that he doesn't
[11:40] have some fountain open for us to drink
[11:43] from to fill our emotional need.
[11:46] We cannot buy into that lie. God has
[11:49] given his word to this generation and
[11:52] that word is sufficient to take care of
[11:54] our need during this time. As a matter
[11:57] of fact, his word, you don't think it,
[11:59] well, it's for my soul. The word's for
[12:00] my soul. No, God provides for emotional
[12:03] depletion. God provides to fill you. God
[12:06] provides for a sound mind. God provides
[12:08] any instability that you're feeling. Can
[12:10] you say amen? God provides for it. What
[12:13] I find is most of our generation and
[12:15] many in the message are turning to other
[12:17] things for their emotional stability.
[12:21] Oh, brother Paul, are you going to go
[12:22] there? I'm going to go there.
[12:25] I'm finding that a lot of us are turning
[12:28] to other things to fill our void our
[12:32] void emotionally.
[12:39] We are an addictive society.
[12:43] David Courtright wrote in a book a
[12:45] couple 2019 he wrote a book called we
[12:47] are the age of addiction. The age of
[12:49] addiction. You can look it up. And uh
[12:52] David Courtright writes that we are the
[12:54] complete age of addiction. And the
[12:55] summary for the book he said at the
[12:57] beginning he says we live in an age of
[12:58] addiction from compulsive gaming and
[13:03] shopping to binge eating. So now when we
[13:06] think of addiction we think of
[13:07] marijuana. We think of someone in an
[13:09] inanol someone a dope addict. And so
[13:12] that's the addiction we think of. But
[13:13] this fell he's mentioned we're an
[13:15] addictive society. We have a lot of
[13:17] things that are addictions. Can you say
[13:18] amen? And he says his addiction from
[13:21] compulsive gaming and shopping to binge
[13:23] eating and opio opioid I never can say
[13:26] that word opioid abuse sugar can be as
[13:30] habit forming as cocaine researchers
[13:33] tell us and social media apps are
[13:36] hooking our kids.
[13:39] But what can we do to resist temptations
[13:43] that insiduously and deliberately rewire
[13:46] our brains? What's he saying? All these
[13:49] things over time rewire our brains. They
[13:52] mess with our sound thinking.
[13:57] What can we do that that we can resist
[14:01] the temptation that insidiously and
[14:03] deliberately rewire our brains? He said
[14:05] nothing. Nothing. David Cartwright says,
[14:08] "Unless we understand the history and
[14:10] character of the global enterprises and
[14:12] the the corporations, unless we
[14:14] understand the history and character of
[14:16] them that create and cater to our bad
[14:21] habits."
[14:23] So you can read the book because then he
[14:25] explores of course he doesn't have the
[14:27] answer. He says they're not really
[14:28] answered but he said maybe we could look
[14:30] at all the corporates that are
[14:31] contributing the corporations
[14:32] enterprises contributing knowing that we
[14:35] have this weakness knowing that America
[14:36] is this way knowing that we lean towards
[14:39] addiction because of our emotional
[14:40] depletion knowing that they gauge
[14:43] everything in entertainment and in uh
[14:46] selling whatever it is they gauge it so
[14:48] that they can become they can become uh
[14:51] the creator and cater to our bad habits.
[14:55] In other words, some in some ways we can
[14:57] help you,
[14:59] but when they go to help you, it's not
[15:02] really helping you. It's leading you
[15:04] more and more to addiction. Cuz guess
[15:06] why they want you to be addicted to
[15:07] their product? Because they make money.
[15:10] Amen. It's all about the mighty dollar.
[15:13] Come on now. They're going to make money
[15:15] off of you. They're going to make money
[15:16] off of medicines. They're going to make
[15:18] money. And trust me, today I am not
[15:20] criticizing. I'm not criticizing
[15:22] something that helps a person, but I'm
[15:24] here as a gospel minister that has to
[15:26] point you to what Jesus said and that we
[15:28] believers guard ourselves be from
[15:30] becoming to addict too addictive to
[15:33] something that is is to be the all
[15:35] answer for our emotional depletion.
[15:38] Amen.
[15:43] Man eating from the tree of knowledge is
[15:46] trying to help us in his way as he
[15:50] ignores the tree of life. Man eating
[15:52] from that tree is ignoring the tree of
[15:54] life that we can eat from. Where does
[15:56] all this start though? The craving
[15:58] number one, the craving in the soul for
[16:01] peace. Let's start with the soul.
[16:04] Man without the peace of the Holy Spirit
[16:07] in his life, the Holy Ghost in his life
[16:09] will be craving that his entire life and
[16:11] Satan has alternatives to bring that
[16:14] peace to his soul. In other words, being
[16:15] settled with God,
[16:18] being settled being settled that God,
[16:21] I've accepted his his uh his uh journey
[16:24] to Calvary. I accepted what he's done. I
[16:27] receive what the Lord has done for me
[16:29] because I'm a sinner. I need to be
[16:31] saved. Every person in this room was
[16:33] born a sinner.
[16:36] Every person in this room was born a
[16:38] sinner, unacceptable to God. But the
[16:40] problem is is we try to do good works
[16:42] and we try to do things that would give
[16:45] us a little bit of temporary peace to
[16:46] make us feel good in our soul. But God
[16:48] says, "I don't want you to do that. I
[16:50] want you to receive me and you receive
[16:52] peace. Come to me all ye that are weary
[16:56] and heavy laden." Why are they weary?
[16:58] Why are they heavy laden? trying to get
[17:00] peace on their own. But God says, "Come
[17:03] to me for your peace. Come to me for
[17:06] your settlement and I will give rest for
[17:09] your souls."
[17:11] So a man or woman can come to complete
[17:14] rest in their soul level that they are
[17:17] it's been settled. God has accepted me
[17:20] because I have accepted his Calvary
[17:23] experience. I've accepted what he's done
[17:25] for me. And now I'm accepted not because
[17:27] I earned it, not because I deserve it,
[17:29] but he has accepted me already. He died
[17:31] for my sins.
[17:36] And it meets the craving. But if you
[17:38] don't find that, if she doesn't find
[17:40] that, they will search their whole life
[17:42] because they got a craving in their
[17:44] soul. You have a craving in your soul.
[17:48] And the other bad part is people fill it
[17:50] with religion. They fill it with
[17:52] something that they do. If I can just do
[17:55] this and make mommy and daddy happy or
[17:57] make brother Paul happy and if I could
[17:59] just wear this and if I could just be
[18:00] this and be a good girl and do all this
[18:02] stuff. So you move into that mode of
[18:04] putting something on the outside. But a
[18:06] lot of people they still haven't met the
[18:08] craving on the inside.
[18:11] There's a craving that no dress, no
[18:14] outward religion, there's a craving that
[18:16] none of that will ever satisfy. It's his
[18:20] spirit that pours out in your life as
[18:23] you accept it and all of a sudden peace
[18:25] comes that I am at peace with God. I am
[18:28] in relationship with God. Let the world
[18:30] fall apart. I am at peace with him.
[18:33] Amen.
[18:35] God, help every person that's listening
[18:38] under the sound of my voice this morning
[18:40] here and on the broadcast and on the
[18:43] internet wherever you are. I pray you'll
[18:46] seek God to meet that craving in your
[18:48] soul.
[18:50] Please, please don't pass God by.
[18:54] Addiction uh originates in three main
[18:56] things and that is a past family
[18:59] dysfunction. a past family dysfunction.
[19:03] And then the second thing is a real bad
[19:05] trauma happened in life. That's the
[19:08] second thing. A past family dysfunction,
[19:10] a real bad family, a bill, a real bad
[19:13] trauma that happened to you, whether it
[19:14] happened to you when you were 5 years
[19:16] old or they happened to you last week.
[19:19] It's a trauma to your spirit. It's a
[19:21] trauma to your emotions.
[19:23] And third thing is the pressure of the
[19:25] demonic realm existing that we live in
[19:28] now is there's a pressure from the
[19:29] demonic realm particularly the sexual
[19:32] temptation and the saturation of filthy
[19:34] sexual things in front of us.
[19:38] So it's saturated with that and that
[19:40] brings a pressure on the human spirit a
[19:42] temptation on the human spirit. You're
[19:45] trying to hold to God but around us is
[19:47] this demonic force. this demonic
[19:49] pressure, especially on our young
[19:51] people, but it's on every it's on
[19:52] everywhere. So, three things can cause
[19:54] people to to to run towards some
[19:57] addiction to help them relieve and calm
[19:59] themselves. But you got to go back to
[20:00] the source that some past family
[20:03] dysfunction took place. You grew up with
[20:05] something that affected you and and we
[20:07] might as well be honest. You know, I
[20:09] like to say that uh you know uh the
[20:11] people come to our church and people
[20:13] come and they come from dysfunctional
[20:15] families. Um, probably most of us come
[20:18] from some dysfunction from our family.
[20:22] Oh, I had a pretty good dad and mom. I
[20:24] had a pretty good life. Most of us come
[20:26] and then I always like to say we all
[20:28] were born from a dysfunctional family,
[20:30] Adam and Eve. It's these things that
[20:33] lead to looking for remedies.
[20:36] a family a family trauma the a family
[20:40] dysfunction a bad trauma that happened
[20:42] to your life and uh the de demonic realm
[20:44] we're fighting against if these things
[20:46] in these things then it leads to looking
[20:48] for remedies everybody I want you to
[20:50] just think of not just think of medicine
[20:52] this morning when I think of remedies
[20:53] okay uh I don't want you to think of
[20:55] just medicine
[20:59] there are hundreds of other remedies
[21:02] to fill
[21:05] The emotional
[21:07] instable person,
[21:14] entertainment,
[21:17] books,
[21:20] music,
[21:22] movies,
[21:24] fashions,
[21:26] social media.
[21:30] You know, when you get to these parts
[21:31] just like it's like I say these things
[21:33] just just falls on the floor.
[21:40] Gaming,
[21:42] sports,
[21:44] roleplaying,
[21:46] meditation,
[21:48] concerts,
[21:50] things that emotionally charge us. A
[21:53] concert will emotionally charge us. Even
[21:56] Christian concerts.
[22:01] Now you trust me now. Even highly
[22:03] charged emotional gospel meetings,
[22:07] even camp meetings
[22:10] that are emotionally charged, and I'm
[22:12] not talking about the ones that are
[22:14] preaching the word of God in the right
[22:15] thing, but emotionally charged will
[22:17] appeal to someone who's who's drained
[22:20] emotionally. But listen, listen, be
[22:22] careful because someone could be be
[22:25] become into an emotionally charged
[22:27] atmosphere and be affected emotionally
[22:29] by it and get very excited. But it still
[22:32] can be just a temporary emotional fix
[22:35] because when you go back, you have the
[22:37] same addiction. When you go back, you
[22:39] have nothing to overcome with. It's a
[22:42] deception just to present an emotional
[22:44] atmosphere. So people feel so great at
[22:47] camp, but then they don't feel so great
[22:49] when they get home. So something becomes
[22:51] addictive when physically and mentally
[22:53] we become dependent on a particular
[22:55] substance and unable to stop taking it
[22:58] without incurring adverse effects.
[23:00] That's the meaning out of the dictionary
[23:02] of what addiction addict being addictive
[23:04] is physically and mentally dependent on
[23:07] a particular substance and unable to
[23:08] stop taking it without incurring adverse
[23:11] effects. In other words,
[23:12] enthusiastically. Here's another meaning
[23:14] to addictive. enthusiastically devoted
[23:16] to a particular thing or an activity.
[23:20] That's not drugs.
[23:22] That's enthusiastically devoted to a
[23:23] particular thing or an activity.
[23:26] That can become an addiction. And what's
[23:29] the addiction for? Trying to fill an
[23:31] emotional need.
[23:33] People go to all kinds of sources to
[23:35] fill their emotional need. And I'm here
[23:37] to tell you this morning, some of them
[23:40] are good, some of them are okay. But we
[23:42] can't only go to those things. We have
[23:46] to go to God even for our emotional and
[23:49] mental stability.
[23:52] So the devil deceives us in that message
[23:54] book or that Bible. Oh, this this
[23:57] there's nothing in here as I read.
[23:58] There's nothing in here for me feeling
[24:01] emotionally unstable right now. It's got
[24:02] to be something. No, it's not in here.
[24:04] That's a lie. That's a lie. in the
[24:07] presence of the Lord, in his word, as we
[24:09] as we stay with it. Young people, stay
[24:11] with it. Read it. Say, "God, reveal it
[24:13] to me." Because there is a filling of
[24:15] our emotional need. Even it fills our
[24:17] souls. It fills our minds. It fills our
[24:20] bodies. Even physical healing is in the
[24:23] word of God. Amen. We can't buy into the
[24:26] deception that modern problems and the
[24:28] reason I'm feeling emotionally depleted
[24:30] because of an incident, a trauma that
[24:32] happened, the reason I the the the
[24:34] answer for it has got to be some
[24:36] somewhere else. Some people even seek
[24:39] emotional filling from their own
[24:41] families. And I even do that. You know,
[24:44] we we love our families and so we we
[24:47] gravitate towards them, but it's still
[24:49] limited.
[24:53] It's still limited.
[24:56] It's still not the fulfilling that we
[25:00] need to fill with. Can I get an amen?
[25:03] Amen. Your wife, your husband, a
[25:05] boyfriend, a girlfriend, young people
[25:08] will will fill the void of their craving
[25:10] for fellowship. And they think that the
[25:12] answer all is if I can just be closer to
[25:15] this person and and and they can fill.
[25:18] And then they start doing it. They start
[25:20] filling that void, that craving that's
[25:22] within them and they this is the answer.
[25:23] And so now we need to do this, we need
[25:25] to move on. And so you have to be
[25:26] careful though because you have to fill
[25:29] your void emotionally first with our
[25:31] Lord Jesus first. Amen. Because if it's
[25:35] only in that boyfriend or girlfriend or
[25:38] that husband or wife, it will disappoint
[25:40] you someday and you'll still feel a lack
[25:43] on the inside. It has to be with our
[25:45] loving savior that we find that
[25:47] emotional stability. And if you only
[25:50] like the God in the mountain and you're
[25:52] going to just travel to camp meetings
[25:53] and you only like to live on the
[25:55] emotional highs, you haven't really got
[25:57] to know God in the valley yet. And if
[26:00] you're going to grow in the Lord, you
[26:01] have to know God in the valley because
[26:03] the same God that was in the emotional
[26:06] high, can you say amen, is the same God
[26:08] that's with you
[26:11] in your lows and you cling to him. You
[26:14] don't cling to some entertainment. You
[26:15] don't cling to some relieving of your
[26:17] nerves. If you have to do that medicine,
[26:19] I'm not condemning that. I'm just saying
[26:21] don't cling to that and not to God.
[26:23] Cling to God. We're weak in ourselves.
[26:25] And when we're weak, then God can
[26:27] express his strength through our
[26:29] weakness.
[26:32] It's humility to say, I can't do this on
[26:34] my own, and I'm not going to turn to
[26:36] something else to meet my emotional
[26:38] void. Turning to my God. God, I'm You
[26:42] don't think other prophets and other
[26:43] people in the Bible Christ said, "I've
[26:44] been mistreated. I' It's been It's
[26:46] unfair. I'm The hounds of hell are after
[26:49] me. I've got a Jezebel after me. I don't
[26:52] know what it is, but God, I turn to you.
[26:54] I will not turn to anything else. I am
[26:57] emotionally instable right now, and I'm
[26:59] willing to admit it, but God, I'm
[27:01] staying right here until you answer, and
[27:03] you come and you fill this need. You
[27:06] fill my emotional instability. You make
[27:09] me stable.
[27:10] You stabilize it. Can I get an amen this
[27:12] morning? Heavens and earth will pass
[27:15] away in front of you. But my word is
[27:19] stable.
[27:21] My still small voice is there.
[27:25] But you got to pull away. Come away.
[27:27] Song of Solomon. Come away, little
[27:29] bride. Come away. How many raise your
[27:31] hand say? I I feel that, but I don't
[27:33] obey it every time. I feel that voice of
[27:36] my beloved saying to me as a bride, come
[27:38] away. Come away to me. Get quiet. Listen
[27:42] to my voice. Come away. Come away,
[27:45] little bride. Every young person, every
[27:48] older person, everybody's called to the
[27:49] same still small voice. You may have
[27:51] heard it this morning because you sat
[27:53] long enough, an hour and a half, you sat
[27:56] and listen. Hopefully, it's not just my
[27:58] voice, but you hear something calling
[27:59] you.
[28:01] How many believes it'll bring stability
[28:03] to your emotions?
[28:05] I can be going through the worst thing.
[28:08] It just stabilizes. Thank you for
