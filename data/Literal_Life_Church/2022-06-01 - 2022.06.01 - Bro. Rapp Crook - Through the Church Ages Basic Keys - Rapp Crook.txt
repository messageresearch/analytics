========================================

the most energetic of ministries and it can be difficult for a wednesday night to to endure but you're all hanging with us really well and i appreciate that let's start with revelation 2 read through the first um uh the first seven verses this is the the message to the first uh first church verse one unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and that's found them liars and brother branham talks about this in the uh church age book he he talks about how this is a a church who's working in there and they're very diligent and to be different people coming along with different uh different teachings and they and they and they try them and compare them back to the word that paul preached what isn't true what is true and they and they're very serious what they accept verse three and s born this test patience and for my namesake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because now has left thy first love he talks about this being a church that's working and working working but working without love eventually and leads to backsliding he talks about that also at some point verse five remember therefore from whence thou were fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except or unless thou repent but this thou hast that thou hatest the deed of the nicolaitans which i also hate he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches to him that overcometh who i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god let's pray heavenly father we just thank you for your goodness and your grace to us lord i thank you for the for the word that you've given father through the through the message lord showing us what these things mean father eunice we're living in the shadows of your coming lord i pray father as brother branham prayed at the very first service of the revelation of jesus christ series may this not be a lecture but something that just draws us closer and closer to you lord that's our prayer tonight lord let us also pray again for the for the sea family lord you give them this be the god of all comfort to them i pray in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated so this evening i'm going to talk about some of the things where the brandon talks about the very beginning of the ephesian church agent that's just basic keys that unlocked his understanding that allowed him to how did he establish what the duration of each age was how did he establish who the church age messengers were how did how did those things come about and he and he's going to share a couple of keys that unlock that forum but first i want to talk about how how we can understand the seven churches themselves because there's there's different ways that uh the theologians look at these particular chapters revelation two and three um one way that many will look at it is that these were these were seven local churches in asia minor at the time which they were there and that these were letters met just for that time period with no bearing at all to anything in the future or to us today and i would and brother branham talks against that stamp i just want to draw a couple things that kind of back up scripturally why can we say you know this these these church these churches are not just local local congregations then but they're talking about seven different periods of church history up to the present that have certain conditions or characteristics that mirrored conditions in local assemblies at that time and first off we go back to revelation chapter one and i'm going to look at revelation chapter one um it's kind of giving the setting to chapters two and three that this patents vision does that well first off revelation 1 3 says that blessed is he that readeth and they hear the words of this prophecy so revelation is a prophetic book sure it had application of the time period that john was in but it's it's mainly being written as a prophetic book for the first for the time to come and i thought it was interesting just kind of looking um today um back at the patentless vision we looked at two weeks ago and here's where where john he's in the spirit on the lord's day and remember he he turns around and then he sees behind him um this this this vision of these seven golden lampstands and these these lamp stands have had an important symbolism that each lampstand symbolized one of the churches and then christ is walking through the lampstands and he's holding seven stars in his hand and each of those seven stars are one of the angels to the seven churches and we saw how the lamp stand had such an important meaning because it was connected to oil and oil we looked at i think zechariah chapter four how the lampstand had its it was um it was it was uh zechariah four have a a lamp stand that is between two olive trees and it's drawing its oil from these from these olive trees so it's right from the source it'll be able to shine forever nothing can hinder this flow of oil and i just kind of thought if these seven churches are just seven local congregations in the first century the the eternality of the oil kind of loses its meaning because oil is supposed to go on forever and ever for all for all time it's not just this the seven congregations in the in the first century and you also see um in revelation chapter two verse four john's giving greetings are one verse four it says john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you in peace from whom he says from him which is which was and which is to come and then even from and from the seven spirit which are before his throne from jesus christ and this with he which is which was which is to come all pertain to different aspects or offices of christ he which is what is christ's role right now he's an intercessor he's uh he's he's he's our he's our high priest well what was he well he was the son of man god and flesh um deuteronomy 18 15 talks about him moses says there will come a prophet like unto me flesh man that god is going to be fully indwelling that is who it was and jesus is our high priest or intercessor and who's coming he's the king that's coming he'll be a judge that's coming and the patentless vision especially describes jesus's return as judge we looked at all those characteristics how he's he's got this white wig on he's got eyes flaming his fire he's got feet that are like like brass hot is hot burned in the furnace he's got a sword coming out of his mouth the sword of the word all these things are not really characteristics you would associate with an intercessor as someone coming to to make things right to to be the to be the judge prepare to to reign over things again and i would this is this is my take on it you can take what it's worth i kind of see revelation 2 and 3 kind of starting the story of how does christ's role change from intercessor to judge because you can see all kinds of because revelation chapter 1 it talks about christ's coming he behold he cometh with clouds i think that's in verse and verse 7. so john's right here in the first century and he's seeing jesus coming with clouds and then everything in between is also going to be described there in the church ages these are conditions that are going to be prevailing in different churches and each of these characteristics that were in these churches foreshadowed the conditions of the church into the future kind of explaining how christ takes such a drastic change in role being a high priest to being a to being a judge and in romans 11 25 paul uses the phrase um how god will be dealing with dealing with the gentiles until the fullness of the gentiles become in and after that he turns to the jews well brother branham talks about at the bottom of page one how the seven ages in revelations two and three taken the whole span of time that is the fullness of the gentiles the whole time of the church ages that god is dealing with with the gentiles so i think it's a i think we definitely have scriptural basis for the brand underlines also that this is not just seven churches that are local congregations in asia minor but these are this is speaking prophetically about characteristics of the church in in ages to come and as you look i just kind of wanted to go through this as you might study that some yourselves are going through the church age book as we look at what we just read in chapter 2 we can kind of break down the pattern that each message each church age is going to follow first off christ is going to be identifying himself with specific attributes and with every church age this is how he starts and he introduces himself in revelation 2 1 to the ephesian church i'm the one with the seven stars in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and and if you look at um like the the smyrna church age on page you've got a little table that's just kind of summarizing this he identifies himself i'm the first and the last the one who was dead and yet is alive and with the pergamian church age i'm i'm the one i am he with the sharp sword with with uh with two edges you can go on and look at each one of them but if you look at it i kind of think that you can see a core a connection between how he introduces himself the the attributes that he's highlighting and the trials that that age is going through because if you look at i think you see it well with smyrna smyrna is a persecuted church he tells him don't fear what you're going to suffer it'll be a tribulation of the last 10 days but be faithful unto death and you'll receive a crown of life well to this suffering persecuted church who does he identify himself as he identifies himself as the first and the last who was dead and yet is alive i am proof i made it through they couldn't kill me i was resurrected you have my life in you you'll be resurrected as well in the pergamian churches the age of false doctrine where the papacy is just starting to to rule and how does he identify himself as he identifies as i am he with the sharp sword with two edges that is the word of god so whenever we go through a particular trial we should look for what attributes of god do i need to be keying in on right here because that's how god is introducing himself to each of these church ages you need to know me in this way because you're going to be tested in this particular aspect as well it's interesting in the you know god starts the process off in ephesus and then in sardis um he does he starts doing a work of restoration in in there in the reformation well in in ephesus he identifies himself as the one with seven stars in the midst of the golden candlesticks and then sardis he identifies himself very similarly i'm the one who has the seven spirits of god and the seven stars he's he's starting this work of restoration of reformation there and then after he introduces himself um highlighting his own attributes that parallel their their needs he then is to be giving them kind of a report card kind of going through and like a teacher does giving comments at the end of the year i just had to do that and you always try to give a rose with every thorn and that's kind of what he does and with each with each church age he's he's showing uh he's throwing in the ephesian church he gives he's able to praise the ephesian church quite a bit they're they're working um they're laboring they've gotten their patient endurance they're not they're not going to put up with false doctrine they're going to put it away from them you've tried them to say they're apostles and they're false apostles and you've called them liars that which they are all these things he doesn't like the nicolaitans we'll talk about that later perhaps and he's complimenting them with every single as much as he can but he also says yes all these things are great but i've got one thing against you and that is you've left your first love and with each church as much as possible he highlights the things they're doing good and then brings a correction and i like the comment brother brandon makes on on this section the top of page two here he says how beautifully the savior praises and commends his children he takes full account of their fine spiritual attitudes and behavior he knows there's weakness among them but as yet he does not cry out against it isn't that just like the lord he knows how to encourage us in the right manners and discourage us in the wrong matters we could all learn a good lesson right here on running the church and our families how often is it how easy it is you just focus on what what what are kids doing wrong you're doing this wrong you're doing this wrong you're doing this wrong you know all this wrong i'm i'm fed up with it without taking the time to catch them doing good and they just just monopolize this make a moment of what they've done well and that's one that we can learn from um don't ever be discouraged saint of god for god is not ungracious to get your labors of love even the smallest thing even giving a cup of cold water to someone has reward and blessing from the lord so he starts off identifying who he is attributes are real important to their time of trial he goes through what they're doing well with him to work on and then he finally ends with a promise of reward to the overcomers it's really um inspiring to read the reward that's promised to each to each age and brother branham talks it's not just just that age but all of us are going to if we overcome we're heir of these things also so like the ephesian age they have the reward of being able to eat of the tree of life the smyrnan age won't be heard of the of the of the second death you can go on all the way down until finally the overcomers allowed to see an age we'll be able to sit with christ and his throne what a reward so it's nice to be able to see the kind of see that as you read what's being said in these verses and be able to place it in that way i want to take a look at the top of page three kind of starting off with the question how did brother branham come up with the dates for the ages the messengers and things like that and i kind of emphasize one thing he doesn't say he doesn't say i came up with all this myself he doesn't say that sometimes we can get that impression when it's taught that he came up with everything himself but he doesn't say that himself and it's one of the criticisms that people have of uh people who've left the message will have a criticism though brother the church's book's full of plagiarism he just copied it from this person that person um that's not the case i'm going to show a show a couple things about that he makes frequent references if you look in the in the revelation of jesus christ seriously drawing from commentaries from histories and someone who's plagiarizing doesn't do that now he's god did not send us a college professor he did not send us a theologian god sent us a a prophet who didn't know about how he should be citing sources things like that but he's telling us where he got things from and that and that we we should be happy with what god brought and what god sent us but the major part of brother brandon's ministry was tying together truths that had been lost throughout the ages so we don't need to disrespect or diminish his ministry when we say he didn't come up with everything himself because that wasn't all everything he was called to do and the message um is this a sign of the answers he says this is from middle quote on page three it says there's lots of truth out there um lots of truth lost out there why were others compromised on truth but this seventh angel doesn't compromise on anything he gathers up all the loose ends gathers them all up and that his sounding all the mystery of god should be finished and right above there he he talks about how somebody has come forth with a chart and draw everything out and somebody else comes forth with another thing and draws everything out all contrary to this one and somebody says well this is it or that's it coming back to this net that creates confusion and that's what he contacts with an uncertain sound and he says what we needed then is somebody to take the loose ends if this person has this right this person is this right this person is this right and saying this is what's truth and he says that's what this angel from revelation 10 7 is supposed to do take the mysteries them loose ends that people run out on so when we look at am i good very good all right very good so when we look at the things that um some of the things he says here we'll see he's he is drawing from lots of different uh um sources so first he says these are all quotes from the revelation of jesus christ series he says this is taken from the most outstanding historians that i know of the history of it all and then he talks about in the um and now with all the commentaries and so forth i could not have brought all the books to the platform i just wrote them down on the paper here and things like that and then he says i've been studying the histories to find out how long that church began how it pulled off and what taken place and then once again he says and every time when you see me referring to pages i have written here it's stuff i've taken from commentaries and so forth so he's not making a claim to originality i've got everything myself he's not saying that he's saying this but he does he does emphasize i went into prayer and before i ever picked up these other books i was i was praying seeking god and searched out from the scripture and then the holy spirit guided him what was correct here what was correct hear what was correct here and that's what we need a prophet to come along and say this is right there but that's not right these two go together to give us a correct picture but he's not saying i got everything myself and here we have this is um this is the way a lot of students would like to be able to cite their sources you know how to do this in your english papers but as you're ministering and that works just fine so the first um the first key as he's going through this is he talks about it being the keystone of the bible and the keystone is that that center stone of the arch it's a it's a wedge-shaped stone at the apex of a masonry arch and it bears all the ways you can get you can get the the one the one column going up the second column going up and you can see without that arch connecting the two without that keystone these these these pieces are just going to fall in but that keystone is exactly fit to bear the pressure from both sides fit exactly so it'll bear all the pressure distribute the weight going right down to the foundation of it because that is what this truth is is this this important key that god gave me um that's what it's like a keystone here and the basic key that god gave him to be able to figure out what are the correct dates who is the correct messenger the first three says that both god and his ways are unchanging that is the keystone of the bible and um it says here it is an unchanging god with unchanging ways what he did at the first you'll have to keep on doing until it's done the last time there will never be a change and the and the first quote on page four it says in order for you to fully understand the message of the church ages i'd like to explain the various principles that allowed me to arrive at the names of the messengers the length of the ages and other fractures involved therein since this study was to be the most serious one i had ever taken up to this time i sought god for many days for the inspiration of the holy spirit so this wasn't just study drawing from sources he seeks the inspiration of god then only did i read this scriptures in the church ages and delve into the many church histories written by the most unbiased historians i could find god didn't fail to answer my prayer while i read the word and the histories i was enabled by the holy spirit to see unfold of the pattern that runs the present through the centuries right into this present this last days that is the keystone of the bible the revelation that god never changes and his ways are unchangeable as he is and the part of that is how god started working at the church at pentecost that's the pattern that'll that that that that should go on into the future the church at pentecost sets the pattern so you can go back to the beginning see the first and perfect act of god and then judge by that standard that's how it's done so we could look and see uh which which men have gone in a particular age or how do they compare to what paul was teaching paul was the standard of the church age messengers not everybody they didn't have to copy him exactly but they would be approximating him in each church age that the proxy best approximates that uh that original age that is the original church the true church will always try to be like the original at pentecost the true church they will try to approximate that early first one and you have to work from the original that's that that's important the devil doesn't want us to do that by any means and it's interesting if you look at different commentaries on the book of acts i taught from the book of acts a couple years ago in my bible class in high school and there are a couple different errors that come up frequently when you look through the book when when you look through commentaries on the book of acts and the first one has to do with with the trinitarian baptism they're not going to do it the exact same way that it was done in the book of acts and but the clear the clear pattern is you should do an exam that you shouldn't leave the original pattern how god worked at the first church that's how it should be done all the way through all the way through and what you have then once you start changing the building structure of the arch you have what's called a a bald arch and you see this arch that keystone isn't exfitted exactly so the weight isn't being distributed just right all the way down to the columns and eventually that arch is going to collapse and fall because this little bit the design changes this past year in school of my geometry class we had the students make a um a popsicle stick um suspension bridge it was really kind of fun um but you were here we had the goal was try to get your bridge had to hold at least 40 pounds and we were able to uh stack them up we were i had all my weights on the winning bridge it was over 100 pounds it was really really cool one of the bridges was almost like 80 pounds and one little popsicle stick snapped loose from the glue and we stopped right there because once one little stick breaks forth that changes the weight relationships for the entire bridge if we'd kept on going the whole thing would have snapped pretty fast so as you start changing just a little bit and you're teaching away from the original church that changes the distribution of everything in the system and it's going to lead to a collapse it might not happen right away but it's going to happen before too long and it's just interesting um it's very clear what peter preaches on the day of pentecost repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost every time there's baptism in the book of acts it's very clearly done in the name of the lord in the name of the lord jesus in the name of the lord jesus christ it's it's it's it's immersion you've got the the ethiopian eunuch he's he's traveling along on this long journey and i'm sure he would have had a bottle of water in his uh in his carriage somewhere and phillip saying wow yes okay i believe can i be baptized and he doesn't pick up the bottle of water could you sprinkle me he says no there is water can i go down into the water and be baptized it's not just a little sprinkling they're actually being immersed they're being their old life is being buried so they can be resurrected out into a new life symbolically but changes get made through the system because the devil doesn't want our arts to stand strong he wants to he wants to change the construction one way or the other so that keystone can be modified in one way or another so the trinitarian baptism that a lot of folks will look to matthew 28 19 and 20. the parallel scripture to that is um is luke 24. and matthew 28 19 and 20 that's where jesus says go ye therefore and teach all nations baptize them in the name of the father son of the holy ghost luke 24 says it's luke's telling the same story and luke says repentance and remission of sin should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem well beginning at jerusalem how was that in jerusalem then because jerusalem will be the correct interpretation of this jerusalem we just said is peter says repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ that's the way they do it matthew who wrote matthew 28 19 and 20 doesn't racing hey hold up hold up peter that's not what he said and if you watch the chosen matthew would certainly do that but he doesn't because peter had it right and if you i don't have these notes with me but um church historians have looked back and they made it looks like that matthew 28 19 text might be have might have been corrupted in some way because there was a church of the first church restorer in eusebius i believe he was in the second century and i've got i've got the copy of his his book on it he was from he was writing like the year 280 or something he quotes from matthew 28 19 and 20. he quotes from it and he says be baptism in his name he doesn't say of the father can hold egos and he would have been using a scroll that was dated pretty early but anyway that's either here nor there the revelation of it is there's one name or no other name given under among under heaven whereby we must be saved another thing that denominations will often take a look at the looking at the early church and says all the supernatural things down the book of acts they were great in the book of acts it was to help this early church get started to be vindicated but gradually they just kind of got faded out and that's why we don't have and that and that was the intention that's a convenient uh interpretation of the if if the supernatural is gradually leaving your assembly or leaving your movement you come up with something to explain it and um and that's actually what i was reading another church history and he says i'll have to get the notes next time on that he says these things were gradually fading and they created the theory to explain why the supernatural what wasn't there but jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever the promise of the holy ghost was to them even that we're afar off even as many as as as the lord our god shall call that's that's what the promise is so the book of acts is not a transition the book of acts is showing what god is doing something new and this is the standard all the way all the way through jesus christ the same yesterday and forever and then the trinitarian might say so the redemption in the old testament was god the father providing way for the people to come to him by sacrifice and foreshadowing how god the son would die on the cross that would make the way finally for god the holy spirit to get in on the redemption story that's not the case at all though it's not that there isn't a trinity it's one god the whole time revealing himself and i love brother branham's comment as he talks about he reads from let me see here he reads from acts chapter one this is at the top of page five he reads from acts chapter one i pulled up here it says the former treatise have i made to be the book of luke o theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and teach all that jesus began both to do and teach and brother branham comments on there on the token it has to be because woman and her husband become one they become one so does the bride in christ become one the ministry of the bride and the minister of christ is the same and remember the former treatise oh theophilus have i written unto you that jesus began to do and continues to do that's how he that's his comment on that luke shows what jesus began to do act is what jesus is still continuing to do but it's jesus christ working through the whole time because the ministry of the bride and the groom are the same luke shows what the ministry of the groom was and the book of acts shows what the ministry of the bride is and they're the same because it's one spirit working through it all the whole time i just really like he says he returned again not a third person but the same person returned again in the form of the holy ghost to continue the work because in john chapter 14 jesus said don't worry i will come to you well how did jesus come to them he came to them in the form of the holy ghost that's why we said last time how paul is the whole the um the pillar of fire comes down on the road to damascus and paul look saul looks up at that pillar of fire and who does he see there he sees jesus and he says you've been you've you you've been persecuting me well paul hadn't touched jesus you saw hadn't touched jesus but the spirit of jesus was in all the believers and jesus identifies hey they are me you've been persecuting me when you persecute them because we are we are one amen so the the devil does everything that he can to affect the arch of our teaching the arch of our testimony of the arch of our lives so that he can bring decay onto certain crucial stones there are different ways that an arch like this can develop a bald arch one of them just be ground shifting and think about what is ground shifting when you talk about what are foundation principles what are foundational truths as you start changing the foundational truths that your whole system of faith is built upon that affects everything and eventually it will fall apart it can be because of weathering and talk about the trials of life how they can they have they have an impact upon your testimony and you can say oh you just you've experienced so many things you've been disappointed so many times by by so many people how can god still care for me how can god still love me and you can and if you're if you're not careful you can get you can get caught in the cycle of the blues and let go of certain important things and that just cause that can wear down at your arch and that can cause your a faith to collapse but um that that that is the devil's goal he cannot change he cannot challenge the lord himself but he just he tries to get our our confidence shaken and who and who god is so the the the first main important key that brother brahm talks about that helped him unlock um what god's doing throughout the scripture what god's doing throughout history what god's doing in the present day is that god never changes he never changes in who he is and how he works and that the and that the um the book of acts church that was the that was the pattern well the second basic key is that this is one that if you if you take the time to read through the church edge book it comes up again and again and again that there's that there's a true and false vine running throughout the scripture and he says out of this first key that we've received of the lord there comes another and slightly less wonderful truth there is a true church and a false church a true vine and a false line but of course that false church will always try to usurp the position of the true church how it was how it was in the book of acts that's how it's set forth in the seven ages that's how it is declared in the various epistles that's how it has been that's how it is now that's how it will be it can't change it's not going to change and this is important for us even today to realize for ourselves so we can understand why are things working the way they are in the world that we're in why do we have a hard time as believers being being recognized by other churches because that false spine doesn't want the true vine to get any light a day so we just we don't take it personally that's just the way things are because they didn't accept the established systems didn't accept jesus it's not going to accept his servants either that's just the ground rules of the game just like the the book of genesis is important understanding all of scripture because the things that began as a very small seed form in genesis continue throughout the rest of the bible and then just just get this get more significant and more significant as a as the seeds begins small and grows up big the ephesian church ages that way too things that will begin in very small innocent looking but just a little bit off they'll get more and more off as the as the time as as the ages go on as the basic error errors that crept into the first church were revealed in the book of acts and revelation and the epistles will become more and more visibly manifested and you'd subsequent age until we come to a complete blackout of truth in the loud to see an age maybe we can just look at an example of this in the book of acts chapter 8. i think it's kind of interesting to read the book of acts as um as the story of the first church age getting started never really thought about it that way but you you can definitely see it as that and we'll just see an example of these true and false vines growing up together and then see some examples of the characteristics of that uh false vine what brother branham talks about is nicolaitanism how that's a greek word made up of two words nico comes from the word of the same as the shu nike nikes do with victory overcoming and so if you have a nike shoe on it's the same first part of the word of nicolaitanism because you're overcoming something and what you're overcoming the laity and lady are the are the regular church members and the church might look at them as regular church members but god looks at them as my sheep and who is that overcoming and trying to subdue my sheep that's a big deal to god and we'll see some some really interesting characteristics how this plays out in acts chapter 8. and here we have a revival in samaria and we'll start at verse 5. then philip went down to the city of sumerian preached christ unto them and the people with one accord gave heat unto these things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did this is exactly what happened on the day of pentecost this is a continuation of that and then what happened unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them many were taken with palsies and were lame and they were healed and there was great joy in that city an example of this revival revival is going to bring a deliverance from all kinds of oppression brother branham talks about this particular revival and in samaria philip is going to a place where a man named simon the sorcerer had been holding church and brother brahm talked about simon the sorcerer he had a church and it was a formal church perhaps a state church and he had them all bound down and they didn't have no joy they didn't have no power but when philip came down he preached to them christ resurrected great joy came and healing came and as he's preaching as philip's preaching uh they get baptized and you have a confirmation of a particular apostolic pattern here and then apostolic pattern is that once you believe then you're baptized verse 12 when they believed philip preaching the things censoring the kingdom of god in the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women so this is a great verse that shows why don't we baptize babies because babies can't believe you you baptize a believer in acts verse 16 as yet the holy ghost wasn't fallen upon any of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus how were they baptized in the name of the lord jesus it wasn't the name of the father son holy ghost was the name of the lord jesus it's the only name given to be baptized or healed or whatever by and then after that after peter came down laid his hands upon them he had the keys to the kingdom he says look at what happened in jerusalem then preached in all judea then in samaria under the outermost parts of the earth god used peter in jerusalem to unlock the keys of the kingdom the kingdom is the holy ghost baptism does it throughout judea and finally samaria peter comes says the same thing and they're baptized with the holy spirit this is just the apostolic pattern here so that apostolic pattern is confirmed and finally they're delivered from this dictatorship of simon the sorcerer i just want to take a look at some characteristics of simon the sorcerer's teachings and let's take a look at verse at verse 9. why didn't they have great joy in the city before samaria came because verse 9 says there was a certain man called simon which before time in the city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one and here's an important aspect i would say of an antichrist system it's going to hold the people in fear he's the great one he keeps control and this is the this is a characteristic of of nicolaitanism this is of this is not according to the true pattern that that that's laid out here this is this is the the false vine trying to grow up right as a true vine is right there beside it he's holding the people in fear verse 10 they all gave he to him from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of god they're just awed by him and if we if we're awed by the man of god more than god we've got our eyes on the wrong one we don't need to be we have we have a good respect for the lord's anointed but don't put the man of god above above god was as as as philip comes here and does this and and he's just he's just people are streaming out of simon the sorcerer's church because they've got something that's that's much better they're having joy and everything so after they believe and they're baptized in verse 12 verse 13 then simon himself then simon himself believed also he's willing to become part of this system of the this new faith why so he can get his people back that's the real reason that he's interested in being part of it um he can he and then he was even baptized and he continued with philip and wondered beholding the signs and the miracles that were done why is he doing this he just wants to keep close to his sheep so he continue fleecing them at some point in the future and then once peter comes he lays the hands his hands on the new believers and they receive the holy spirit and simon's like wow i could have that what kind of program could i build he wants the baptism of the holy ghost because he sees it as a business investment how does he intend to get the holy spirit verse 18 says when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands the holy ghost was given he offered them money i would love to buy this because with this little seed money i will be able to cash in on this big time and if you're he's going out of completely the wrong way but this is how false systems get started looking at the great man looking at how great he is he's the center of everything you have to have him pray for you have to send your money to him all these things it's the wrong thing it's a voice it's going right off the path and completely off the pattern but the book of acts as as the holy spirit plants the true seed right next to just a few chapters later the antichrist is already there because the true and the false wine are growing right together and thankfully there is the apostle peter right there to kind of be there to set things in order and that's what you see in the seals in revelation chapter 6 the the antichrist spirit goes out and the first spirit that goes against it the beast is a lion this apostolic anointing roaring against it that's what we see right here happening in revelation chapter 8. so simon he's wanting to he he sees this as a business investment he wants to uh to pay him for the holy spirit but peter says in verse 20 thy money perish with thee because you have thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money you have no partner lot in this matter for your right is your heart is not right in the sight of god repent therefore and pray god if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven thee simon doesn't do that simon might be one of the first people in the book of acts to pray to a man because he doesn't pray to god like peter says but verse 24 says then answered simon said pray you to the lord for me that none of these things will come to have spoken on me simon the sorcerer he see he the only religion that he knows is that some some man has become me and god that's how he's been teaching everybody now he sees another great man coming he sees peter as the next great man i've got to get him to pray for me to god i can get something he doesn't see you have a direct connection with god and that is the pattern that's laid down the book of acts or you receive the holy spirit yourself you have one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus there's there's a direct connection but as soon as the antichrist spirit gets in there it's there's something else there's always going to be something there's some level of interference that's going to fleece you of joy please you have peace flees you have your money all kinds of things because the devil wants his control there the first one to pray to a man and said of god so simon the sorcerer here at the very beginning of acts he's a picture of how antichrist systems work because there's a true vine and a false vine they're both planted about the same time and they're just growing up right around each other and you can see this from the book of genesis all the way through you can see this from the ephesian church age all the way through the other church ages because like brother branham said the basic errors that crept into the first church all that we saw with simon the sorcerer we we took the characteristic assignment of sorcerer's ministry we can erase simon the source of antichrist systems that's how it is that's how the false vine works just those basic areas of crept in there are just going to get magnified as the ages continue on the back of page six oh i think it's in first john four he says brethren says believe beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they're of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world and that's exactly what jesus christ commends the ephesian church age for he says you have tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them liars that's a very difficult process to have to go through but they they they did it because the truth was important enough it wasn't like hey what's true for you is true for you what's true for me is truth might just kind of part ways and be cool with each other they it was so important that they were they were going to have it out and establish what was really true top of page six you see characteristics of nicolaitanism the false line was getting a hold it was teaching that the rulership by man was right it taught that the church had to be governed it taught that control over the people but instead of doing it god's way they simply took authority invested all the spiritual power in their own hands and they came out with a holy priesthood standing between god and the people that's obliterating the whole new testament that's taking you taking a people back to the old testament was an aaronic priesthood that was what god wanted to grow out of and to where there's a where there's everybody that there's every believer is a priest before god they went back to the old aaronic system they became antichrist they disposed of his mediatorship and imposed their own god hated that the ephesians hated that and any true believer will hate it too and if you and if you've been through it yourself and you get any inkling i sense that spirit i work somewhere you run for the hills as fast as you can because you've been there done that got the t-shirt you don't want anything to do with it we'd have to be stone-blind not to see that same thing at work all through the ages and right now it's the worst of all what it was was organization that seemed so logical and now you've got businesses you've got churches have the ceo of online outreach a ceo of this because they're trying to grow their church using organizational man-made methods and you can have it so logical but that's not how god works at all they separated that that separated the people god's people are supposed to be won by one spirit are they all baptized into one body everyone is removed on by the holy ghost everyone is to participate in the worship of god but men wanted the primitives so they took over control i just really appreciate i don't have this quote um i have it's in my bible case you're left at home i think it's in the beginning of the message this a sign of the answer and brother brahms is making some introductory comments which i think are much more interesting than they sometimes led on to be he's just making some comments here about he's going to be in trying to be talking about six or seven different dreams and visions that the people have come to him with is i'm going to try to uh nope i've people have come to with dreams and visions you know i've some of them i haven't been able to interpret to you before he says at the beginning of his message i've not been able to interpret everything that you've brought to me if the lord gives the interpretation i give it to you but he doesn't always give it to me it says god doesn't work as a kind of an answer man where there's gonna be one great man that gives every single answer to you i've not tried to teach you that way i just thought that was so humble because we make brother brandon sometimes he has the answers to it all but he didn't make himself that and i just want to end with um with two statements that brother branham makes at the end of the ephesian church age and when when i read them the first time they just really struck me i think man he's saying this is really important so i really want to focus on this and he says don't ever forget these truths as we study the church jj's and later the seal whether those truths the first key that unlocks a lot of truth as you read through the bible is that god's unchanging his ways are unchanging that's key number one the second key was there is a true vine and a false line don't ever forget these truths don't ever forget these truths because that helps you understand what's going on through little bible stories as you go but it also helps you understand what's going on in your own life what's why are things why why why this particular area of my life not been blessed because maybe i'm not doing it according to god's original pattern maybe i'm off somewhere those are those are really important truths and don't and above all don't forget that's in this last age when the tares are getting bound if they're burning they will shove out the wheat that's regarded by the lord it says don't forget that especially in this last stage because you're gonna be going you'll be feeling the effects of this don't take it personal it's just what they did to him which christ they'll be doing to us too that's how it goes guys let's just keep on don't forget these truths and then he talks also about revivals as a revival signifies a move of god in power and every time god moves satan is there to move also we saw that in acts and during the book of acts in jerusalem god was moving then in samaria god was moving and then simon the source was right there moving along because whenever there's a revival satan's right there to move also and then it never fails i thought this next part was i hope and trust your spiritual mind enough to get that and capitalize on it if you're told to capitalize on something that means there's profit to be made there there's there's great truth to be garnered from this there's something here i don't have it all but man this is important because he said you get you keep this in your mind capitalize on it and one thing i just as i was thinking about this today the revival signifies a move of god in power and satan's will be right there and they can everybody's going to be moving and showing trying to get your eyes off what god's doing and what satan is doing right next to god because how do vines work it's not like the false binds over there and the true vines over here that's not how it works false and true vine are going to be coiled together so just because there's something false happening right next to what's true doesn't mean you have to leave what's true and that's what the devil tries to convince you to do but that's false that's why he says don't forget these truths capitalize on it because whatever's god's yes there might even you go to a special meeting somewhere something might be going off of one there but that doesn't mean there's not some real happening there and you go there and get something real because that's true so don't look at the devil that strikes oh everything's wrong no but whenever there's a move of god in power satan's gonna be right there too but don't let satan's presence keep you from getting what god is giving there at that very same time amen and that um that's the first part of our study for uh the book of ephesus um lord willing um i'd like to take a look at next time um if you if you were to next time we'll be going over uh the ephesian church age further so if you haven't read that chapter yet it'd be great to take the time to do it uh not too many pages if you do five or six pages a day you'll have it done just fine um one of the things that that the that the message that brother branham is criticized for is saying that paul was a prophet messenger he said people said no way nowhere does paul say that he was the prophet and the brother brandon mattis he can say he's a prophet we're going to go into that because we can find when paul's writing i think he really did understand his ministry to be pretty remarkable and even prophetic so take a look at that for next time and we're looking forward to taking uh going into that further let's go ahead and pray let's stand and brother gideon if you'll take over from there heavenly father i thank you for the for the keys that you give us lord now you see how how you started working in the very first church age way back there in the book of acts lord or there in samaria they're in jerusalem finally they're in ephesus lord and father part of the part of the word you gave to ephesus that commendation how faithful they were and how how zealous they were and lord i know we've got many heroes the same can be said about them but lord i pray that you would help us father also lord to remember that love we had for you at the beginning lord and and to cleave to that closely o god lord i pray if there are folks who are retired and worn out one way or the other lord that you would just impart unto them a renewing of your holy spirit father or just another revival lord and father i pray lord that you would help us to or just embrace these these truths that you're an unchanging god with unchanging ways lords that we can rely upon you in every situation help us to do that o god and lord i just also pray you give us discernment to see that false fight in the true vine and not let the false ever distract us from enjoying the riches of your holy spirit oh god lord i pray you bless each one in jesus name amen
