be th [Applause] name you are you are are you are you are the king of kings the one and only Lord we worship your name Jes you're my help in the time of tribulation your name no one name Jesus praise God Exodus 19 and verse three if you would here and Moses went up unto God the prophet of God went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel so now God is telling the prophet to go tell the people something and this is what he told the people you have seen God's saying you've seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant I just want you to stop and recognize now what God is saying he just gave his whole history with the the uh children of Israel he said what have I done he says I you've seen what I did to the Egyptians I took care of your enemy phase one and then and then I I bore You On Eagle's Wings now in this Wilderness journey I bore You On Eagle's Wings phase two and then he says I brought you unto myself which is a revelation of the mystery of why God did all that and that is to bring you to himself to bring you to himself aren't you glad that that's the purpose God's bringing you to himself he'll use miracles to do it he'll destroy your enemy in the Red Sea to do it he'll do whatever needs to be done but the purpose is to bring you to himself because he wants relationship with you now therefore if you will obey my voice if you follow my voice indeed and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priest plural a kingdom of priests a holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel and I believe that it's there's more in here that I'd like to preach on a little bit and that it it shows and unveils to me the final purpose of God through many of the mighty acts that God did you got to realize with the children of Israel he did some mighty acts some mighty things that he hadn't hadn't done for 4 or 500 years and then God visits his people God sends a prophet and then God begins to display himself in such a powerful and a mighty way uh I don't think until this day God displayed him himself to that many people two million is what come out of Egypt and I don't think God displayed himself until today to in that way of Mighty acts like he did to the children of Israel it was awesome it was amazing the things that God did you couldn't deny that God had not come down and visited his people and he opened the Red Sea and he brought water out of the rock for them and he brought bread and he just did so many marvelous things and then he destroyed as he said the the Egyptians for them the enemy and so there was so many mighty things done but I believe these scriptures just a few scriptures we read right in the middle of all that there's a there's a revealing of God's purpose you see because when God does something Mighty or many things Mighty like that it's to grab our attention but whatever he's doing he has a a final purpose to it God is a god of purpose God doesn't do anything just to fill time God doesn't do anything just to just to show off God doesn't do anything just that you can continue to watch his mighty acts he always has a final purpose to it and and so this is what I believe these scriptures revealed that you're seeing the F there's always a final purpose and you're seeing the the purp purpose and and and let me just say it this way seeing God's purpose is very very very important and a matter of fact it's probably the most important out of your experience with God is seeing his purpose of why he's doing it as a matter of fact you could watch God your whole life and not catch his purpose and what a shame that would be because God has an achievement he has something he's trying to do even in the hour we live in he has an achievement something that he wants to accomplish something he wants to get done can you say Amen I've always aligned myself since 16 years old with God's achievement for this hour I said Lord whatever it is you're trying to achieve it's not about my career it's not about my achievement it's not about my vision my goals although you have goals I think it's good but you must align your achievements and your goals and your career and your college choice or whatever it is uh young person you should align your dreams and your goals and your achievements with with what God's achievement is for this hour young couple that you you've been married you got a young family you should pray and say God what can we do for the kingdom of God how can we align our careers and our jobs and our paycheck every week with God's purpose for this hour because there's nothing everything else is empty you know why would you want to put all your money into something and then you then it just doesn't mean anything someday the only meaning only one life to soon be passed only What's Done For Christ will last my mom here used to sing that song Only One Life till soon it will pass only What's Done For Christ is going to last only one chance to do his will so give to Jesus all your days it's the only life that pays when we recall we only have but one life how many raise your hand say we only have we only get one we only get in the on this Earth anyway now we know we have eternity but on this Earth we only have one chance boy I want to do it right don't you we only have one CH chance we better do it right and we better not wait to opportunities to come we better say Lord you're giving me this paycheck and maybe it's a big paycheck or maybe it's little doesn't matter doesn't matter are you saying Lord what can I do for the kingdom of God what can my family do for the kingdom of God if you don't have that then you're not catching God's purpose and so God has a purpose for everything he has a vision and seeing that vision is so important if we don't see it what happens when we don't see God's purpose if we don't see God's in purpose in what he's doing then we might get hung up on all the details in between we might get hung up on people get hung up on the details people get hung up on God people get hung up on God's law people get hung up on God's principles people get hung up on what God tells them to do oh why is God asking me to do that I don't understand and so they might get hung up on the details and why is it they lack seeing God's purpose in all of it because there's a purpose there's an in purpose there's a there's a reason why God says everything he says there's a there's a final end to it can you say amen and what would it be if you didn't understand the end can you say amen and you're trying to figure out why he's saying this now but you don't understand his purpose God has a purpose in it and so you're always praying saying God give me a vision show me a vision show me what your purpose is for this hour and show you show me what my purpose is because if we don't catch that then we might get snagged we might get hung up on the details and or people might get hung up on depending too much on watching Miracles the Bible speaks of sign Seekers the the the the uh the uh there was a certain group of people in the New Testament they were follow the signs they were saying Jews are somewhat that way they they seek signs we would become just sign Seekers of God if we're not catching his purpose the sign is not as final purpose and so we can't just be sign Seekers but we must be purpose Seekers saying Lord what's your purpose what happens when we don't get his purpose and we don't get the vision it's because we because we maybe don't want to see it or we're not crying for it God show me your purpose and why you sent this message show me your purpose and why you said this in this hour what's the final result of everything God I want to know what your purpose is if we don't we get hung up on the details and we become a sign seeker and by that we stop short uh like I was saying on Sunday about the farmer the husbandman who here he is he he has faith in the seed that's been planted in the ground that it says he has long be patient un the coming of the Lord he has long patience for it until he receed the former and latter rain why does he have patience because he's got a faith and a confidence in the seed that's been planted it's the right seed it's the good seed and The Good Seed has been planted not by him but by the son of man and when you have a confidence in what's been planted then God for a farmer he knows if that's good conditions and it's a good seed and there's going to be the right sunshine and the the right rain which by the way is all up to God you realize the farmer is completely dependent on God for his crop he may take his tracker track and tear up the you know and break up the follow ground and then they may have uh things today tractors to plant the seed and all that but you see it's got to be good seed but once it's planted in the ground that he stands back and he's he has to have faith in the seed and then he's completely dependent on the sun and the rain can you say amen and God provides that so when we know that God's in our life then we step back and say God I know this will be right if you're in it can you say amen and and and so the far he has faith in the seed but I want to I don't want to preach that sermon again but he has faith in the seed and who planted it and the vision a farmer can see if the if the conditions are right he has a vision of what's going to come out of that ground he sees a full crop coming up there's a purpose in planting the seed and because he sees that purpose it's easy for him to be patient and wait for God to do it amen he has patience he waits on the full purpose to be fulfilled so millions of people even Christians have struggles over history because they did not see the purpose of God millions of people even Christians throughout history 2,000 years of church history even in the Old Testament there's been people that struggled there's been people that had that has fears they they they haggle over things they they they they struggle within themselves sometimes you can't see it outside but they struggle within themselves and many times is because they don't see the purpose of God they don't see and they get hung up on trying to understand him in their own mind we can't understand God in our own mind his thoughts are higher than our thoughts his life is higher than our life can you say Amen his purpose is greater than our purpose and people get up hung up trying to understand them in their own mind why is God asking me to do this why does God ask us to wear this why this is strange and it's because it's strange to them because they don't see the purpose the longrange result of God in his mind and what he's trying to accomplish correction of God correction from God is mostly resisted do you realize that God's correction is mostly resisted in people but it's because they don't understand the purpose in the correction I think Paul mentions it where he says our fathers in the flesh corrected us and spanked us and you know disciplined us for their own profit for their own benefit but he says our father chastens us as Sons not for his own benefit but it's for our benefit so God's chasing God's correction has a purpose it has an intent behind it aren't you glad can you say Amen but most people resist the correction of God because why they don't see the purpose of God behind it they just see they're being corrected they only see the moment you did wrong I'm correcting you for it but God has a much bigger purpose in correction when he comes and corrects you God has a vision God has a correction for your life and that correction is to bring something good you can't see your purpose without seeing God's purpose you can't understand why you're here on Earth unless you understand what God's purpose is it's linked together can you say Amen why would somebody want to say I'm going to figure out what my purpose is in life but I don't believe there's a God doesn't work that way matter of fact you're in trouble if you ignore God uh in a lot of ways you're going to be in trouble you can't go without God you can't go without his his Revelation and his his personal relationship with you you can't approach marriage or finances or life or death without God so when you're trying to find your purpose then you can't see your purpose without seeing God's actually God's ultimate purpose and achievement can never be separate from you personally now that's a strong statement but I can confidently make it is that God God's ultimate purpose and achievement that he wants to achieve can never be separate from you personally the elect of God because his achievement is related to you right his fin achievement is related to you you say God I don't I'm not a part of this you just go ahead and fulfill your final word no no no his final achievement is to express himself through his people so your purpose is interlined with his purpose this mystery is comes back to as Paul said Christ The Mystery of God revealed as Paul said Christ in you the hope of glory you can't separate God's purpose from it being related personally to you and I don't mean a group because you can't say well God's purpose is a Revival around the world God's purpose finally is God being revealed personally to you if no one else if the theologians don't understand it God doesn't care if the theologians don't understand it he doesn't care if systems don't understand it the final Revelation the final the new birth is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you so you can't say I'm going to find my purpose in life without finding God's purpose because you are God's purpose you are God's final achievement he went to Calvary for you so Trouble Comes when we don't find our purpose if you don't have it tonight say God this is my priority tonight God show me my purpose why I'm on Earth show me why I'm here Lord show me I'm a son and daughter of God and what not just what I'm supposed to do show me who I'm supposed to be then he'll show you what to do in the kingdom of God but but look at that if you could only find that place of your purpose how much trouble you'd save God in your yourself too if you just find your place what kind of trouble have you caused because you weren't in your position you weren't in your place what kind of trouble have you brought to God no I haven't brought any trouble I doubt it you probably brought quite a bit of trouble to God and you probably got try to quite a bit of trouble to your life and maybe your finances or whatever else because you don't know your you don't know your purpose yet I know uh a young man or a young woman sometimes can cause a lot of trouble because they don't know who they are yet they have an identity crisis so now they're trying to be a basketball star and then the next week they're trying to be this and they're trying to be that and parents can't figure it out because they have an identity crisis they haven't found out who they are in Christ yet the purpose of God is essential the purpose the mystery of God what is the mystery of my life what is the mystery of God I must personally find that or else I'll struggle even with the scriptures sometimes the purpose of God is revealed you see I can go down to Ephesians chapter 1 you know what I don't think I'll leave it out Ephesians chapter 1 just to confirm how important that God's purposes how many believe that God has a purpose let's not let that become common to to us God has his acts he has his miracles he has so many things that he has done and will do can you say Amen our faith applied to the word will heal cancer our faith applied to the word will open up the blind eyes I said that on Sunday but it's not just what God can do it's what's his purpose because performing Miracles is not his final purpose so it's important that we find the purpose of God and here in Ephesians 1 it speaks about it just so you know uh picking it up here in verse three blessed be the god of our father Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Heavenly places is the believer's position standing in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him when that night at the altar no he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of our will of his will to the praise of the Glorious Grace wherein he hath made us accepted and the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through the blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein Heath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather now we're in our day we're in the dispensation of the fullness of times that he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to what according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of our will of the government's will he's working everything Accord oh I like this type of counseling this type of counseling he's working his purpose according to and work of all things after the counsel of his own will what does his will say and he's going to work that and bring his purpose to pass and we're a part of that purpose by predestination how many you can raise your hands Thank God I'm a part of his purpose that we should be to the praise of his glory so I want to let you know this is priority when he's speaking to the Ephesians the purpose of God is priority for believers it's not just the miracles of god it's not just the signs of God it's it's not just heaven in the future but it's what God is showing you in a mystery for your lives right now can you say Amen so the purpose of God God in Exodus 19 is revealed to the Jews listen now I want you to catch these points the purpose of God in the scriptures that I read is revealed to the Jews before all the Commandments after all the Miracles had been done through the Wilderness and before the laws came right in the middle God gives a few uh a few things he says to the Jews through the prophet that is his purpose revealed and it's a simple hidden purpose of all the Miracles purpose of the law coming is to bring you to myself I'm going to bring these things up because it's revealed right here it's to bring you to myself that's Oneness God says I want to bring you to myself think about all the Commandments and I'm going to talk about how many they are here in just a minute if you don't know think about all the Miracles he did before this before Exodus 19 think about all the Commandments coming down the road in the next few TW the next 20 chapters is Commandments so you got all these Miracles and you got all these Commandments and right in between just four verses God says to the people but but here here's what it is I did these things and I will do these things that I could bring you to myself that I could be one with you and we know he couldn't fully fulfill that until Jesus went to Calvary you realize that but when he went to Calvary and took care of our sin we could truly become one with Christ and so the the mystery is that it's Christ in you the hope of glory it's Oneness it's you and Christ becoming one and you may see the Miracles you may see the you may believe and love all the law of God and the word of God and study the word of God but what's it all for what's the purpose that I could bring you unto myself and Oneness that you could follow my Bo voice and Obey it all along the way and if you do that I will fulfill my purpose in you and he mentions this last thing that ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priest I know I won't get to all of this tonight but this opens up a whole another Revelation I want you to be a kingdom of priests you say well well what's that mean it means a lot because remember God God didn't say here my purpose is I want you all to keep watching me do Miracles my purpose here is that I'm getting ready to bring you about 20 chapters of laws and I need you to just obey all my laws that's not the full purpose my purpose here is to build a kingdom of priests and that means a couple of things that means that I will bring you into relationship with me a priest has access to God complete access to the inner Chambers and secret of God the priests are the ones the only ones that the high priest only one had clearance into the inner chamber they had it and he he's saying I want everybody to have clearance I want a whole Kingdom of ones that have clearance they don't have to go through anybody they have clearance they they can go in the inner Veil themselves they can see my secrets I'll tell them my secrets I'll whisper my secrets to them and then they will come in and go out because that's what the priest did and the second part of her priesthood is what's so wonderful they have access to God they can come in the in Veil but the main part of a priest is he's a mediator between God and humans a priest is a mediator between God and humans and they will go between and they'll go catch the mystery of God and then they'll come back and they'll be able to bring God to the people can you say Amen they'll they'll be able to pray for people and it won't just be the preachers praying for people it won't be the big evangelist everyone will be a priest unto God and have access to God and when they lay hands on the sick they'll recover somebody say praise the Lord you don't have to wait for the Pastor to pray for you you don't have to wait for the Evangelist for the next convention you don't have to wait you are a priest unto God you have access to God you can lay hands on the sick thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our
