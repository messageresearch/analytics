TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen amen I think musicians if we want to turn a night in our Bibles of Genesis 5 verse 24 amen there's power in the name of Jesus Genesis 5 verse 24. and it says and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him so this is a good scripture Enoch walk with God and he was not for God took him that's pretty cool he was walking along and poof he was gone it'd be nice to get poofed and be gone but the problem is we're still here and that was Enoch's experience and we're still walking around and we're still on this Earth we have our own experiences we've all come to the Lord in different ways but it can get really easy and it's a common tactic of the devil for us to look at other people's experiences and look down on our own or just forget our own experiences because we come up with a measuring system that God never came up with you can have receipts sorry just getting right into it but we've come up with this measuring system that God never came up with we came up with as humans and we have a hard time not comparing ourselves to other people so we'd like to have a testimony we think we would like to compare ourselves to other people we have a really hard time with other people's testimonies we like to say things like man if I had a testimony like that or if I got a faith like that guy or pray like she does but the problem is that you don't understand is there's no difference between your testimony and their testimony you come up with a measuring system God never came up with that measuring system and I promise you that faith can move mountains comes at a very high price in prayer warriors are called prayer warriors because they've been through a lot of battles it didn't come very easily so if we go to Second Corinthians 12 verse 12 for second Corinthians 12. second Corinthians 10 verse 12 sorry it says for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that command themselves but they measure themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise and in the Amplified it says we don't have the audacity to put ourselves in the same class or compare ourselves with some who Supply testimonials to commend themselves when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves they lack wisdom and behave like fools so short versions don't compare yourselves but as humans we really struggle with it it's a lot easier said than done when people have what seems to be a very powerful story and in its own right it is it seems really great and we want to think man if only I had that if only I had that but glory to God for the fiery furnace testimony and I've said it before and I'll say it again because the bear is repeating when we can walk through the fire furnace of life and not even smell like smoke because God has protected us that's a testimony but we forget that we forget our own testimony and we like to look at other people's experiences we don't stick to what God has given us we just keep looking around we get distracted and the devil likes to do that you just keep keep steady with the Lord you're born and raised in church just a good church girl they say you're naive you say this say you're just really innocent like it's a bad thing it's not a bad thing God gave you a very powerful testimony God kept you through the fire furnace of life and you don't even smell like smoke some of us reek like smoke we didn't do any of that things we we came through this and you can tell we came through it unlike the ones that came through with God's protection over them the whole time and that's a real testimony so now we know Enoch's experience and we know we shouldn't compare but we got to try to get the Enoch's level right so is there a level what's Enoch's level what's his Christian level is it 50 is it 100 how do you get to where he got what level is he and what level are you so we like to think that there's levels so we like to compare ourselves to other people's levels and we say oh we don't do that we don't compare ourselves well then we start with again like I said we wish this we wish we could have this I wish I was happy like that if only I could come up to where that person is I'd be okay levels we keep comparing levels and we come up with levels so what level was Enoch if you compare the enox level to the man on the cross next to Jesus what level was he were they on the same level what do they do differently so if you compare Enoch to the woman at the well if you compare Enoch to the adulterous woman what level was adulterous woman why does she get what she got and Enoch got what he got we think there's levels every time we just continue to think that there's levels to this and every time somebody comes to the lord it's a different experience my experience is different than yours Brandon's experience is different than mine everyone's experience was different God did the same thing every time but everybody's experience was different we all seen it differently he did the exact same thing we all repented we came to the Lord but we all came through it in a different way because there's not levels to this there's a position God's put us in positions in his army of God if there's anything he's called us to it's not a level it's a position in the army of God and we have to stay in this position and find this position and God uses Us in different positions in all sorts of different things and we all have a position no matter what the devil tells us so Roman soldiers made famous it was it was famous before they did it but Roman soldiers were the first real professional soldiers arguably they were paid for what they did they're very highly trained and they had a lot of different tactics that they used with shields so one thing that they did was called the the tortoise um The Tortoise formation so if we had that picture and put that up it'll make more sense how the Roman soldiers would carry their Shields so the only way this would work is everyone had a shield and you protected the front the guy behind you protected over your head and the guy next to you would protect next to you and they could push into the wall and not get hurt with arrows not get hurt with these things and the Romans perfected this but it only worked if everyone was in their position and everyone locked their Shield so as they're doing this go to the next one as they're doing this all the shields are laying on the other guy's head or laying on the shield in front of them and they could squat down like this and it was almost impenetrable they would actually use it to get across Rivers because they couldn't it wouldn't move it was that strong but it took everyone to be in their exact position and know that the guy next to them was doing what he was supposed to do to make it work and if they could do it it was almost impenetrable they could lock down like that and just stay there and they could throw everything at them and nothing would happen but if somebody moved and so many changed positions you'd open up a hole in that and it would start to come apart everything is interlocked together if you're not resting it on the guy in front of his head and the guy behind you is not resting on your head it doesn't work and that's the only way that it can work is everyone in their position to make this work so we have to find our position and if we don't have our position we have a hole in our in our Shields they still use the tortoise formation today they still use it in riots so in a riot they can do all this and push their way into a crowd and push their way into a dangerous situation and come around somebody and that's how they can pull them back out of that situation and protect them as they're doing it in the British Riot police are pretty famous for doing this they're well known for perfecting this and using it still to this day to keep people out of dangerous situations or to rescue them so we know we should have a position we know that there's not levels but why are we not in our position how do we get out of our position so the short of it is we get distracted we start looking around we get all locked together in these shields and then we start to get distracted we can't stay focused on God stay in our experiences and work in our position we start looking the guy next to us and wondering why I see in that spot and I'm in this spot I want to be in that spot that guy's cooler than me he's in the front I want to be that guy we start looking around we start getting distracted and we don't we start to compare ourselves we start to get distracted and all these things and we start saying well that dude ain't holding the shield up straight he's not doing that right if I was holding that Shield I would hold that Shield way better than that guy's holding that Shield if I was in that position we would have no problems over there we keep getting distracted we keep looking around so we start thinking more and more you know who's running this anyways who's telling these guys to hold these shields in these positions I would hold them in a totally different angle if I was in charge of the shield formation it would be way better but I've got to find a way to get in charge of this formation because we can't stay in our position we can't just stay locked in next to our brother and stay there and protect what we're supposed to be protecting we want to go to a different position we cannot stay in our experiences we can keep comparing so then we start measuring why do I have to put in more work than that guy I'm holding this thing up and there's a horse walking over my head why do I have to be that guy why can't I be the other guy that's on the side we start measuring I'm doing way more work than that guy's doing we like to measure things we like to put in equal shares and again we've come up with a measuring God never came up with us so we start picking and choosing who should be in what position and who should be in that position and who's who but the past is a position the floor sweeper is a position the church Locker upper guy is a position but we don't like those positions we want to be in a different position because that position is better the song leader is a way cooler position than sweeping the floors but if you were in that position you wouldn't like that one either because you're not content with the position God puts you in at that time God can use you right where you are there's a reason he puts you there there's a reason you went through everything you did because you're supposed to be right there and stop moving around stop looking around stay in your position and hold that Shield we've got to stay in our place and we've got to stay with our Shield so we can we can't keep looking around we can't keep trying to figure out why'd God put those people there why is that guy in charge I don't understand there's way better people yeah you're probably right there probably is more worldly qualified people to do that job but God had it that way for a reason because whatever reason God came up with that's why but God can use that man because he can listen that's why he's in that position and would somebody who is a better leader technically wouldn't want to listen to God wouldn't want to do the things well right now that doesn't make any sense yeah because you don't really get a story God knows the end of the story he's doing all these things for a reason so if we get distracted from this we can get ourselves in a lot of trouble so we go to Matthew 23 and start at verse 1. Matthew 23 verse 1. and it says then speak Jesus to the multitude and we'll just keep going through the verses and to his disciples verse 2 saying the scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses's seat all therefore whatsoever they bid You observe that observe and do but do not ye after their words for they say and do not for they bind heavy burdens and Grievous to Bear to bore and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their of their fingers but all their Works they do for to be seen of men they make Broad their factories and enlarge the borders of their garments keep going and love and love the uppermost room and feast of the chief seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets can be called men Rabbi rabbi but be not ye called Rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye are brethren and to call no man your father upon the Earth for one is your father which is in heaven neither be ye called Masters for one is your master even Christ but the greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever so exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted but woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men for you neither go in yourselves either suffer ye them that are entered to go in what one do you scribes and Pharisees you Hypocrites for you devour wisdoms widows houses and for your pretense make long prayer for therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation we'll want to use scribes in versus Hypocrites for ye can pass see in land to make one apostolite and when he made you make him twofold more the child of Hell than yourselves woe unto you blind guides which say whatsoever shall swear by the temple and if we skip to verse 23 it says won't use scribes and Pharisees of Hypocrites for you pay tithe the mint and ananias and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of law judgment and mercy and faith these are ye have done and not leave the other undone ye blind guides which strain in a gnat and swallow a camel woe under you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the cup of the platter but within are full of extortion and excess Thou blind Pharisee clean first that which is within the cup and platter and then the outside may be clean also we'll want to use scribes of Pharisees Hypocrites for ye are like unto Whited sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful outward but within full of Dead Man's Bones Jesus holds no punches when he goes through this and of all uncleanness even so also outward appearance righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity Lo want to use scribes and Pharisees because ye build tombs of the prophets in which garnish some occurs of righteousness and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have partaken with the blood of the prophets wherefore ye be Witnesses unto yourselves that ye are children of them which killed the prophets fill ye up the measure of your fathers so if we don't stop looking around we can turn into Pharisees pretty quickly because we like to start thinking we're supposed to be standing there with our shield in our position but we'd like to start thinking well what is that guy doing why does that guy look like that we start looking around we start thinking I would do better if I was back then I wouldn't kill the prophets but Jesus said you're the children over them which killed the prophets we start to think that if we did it we wouldn't have so much problems but then we start jumping over law judgment Mercy we start choking on a gnat we start straining at a gnat to swallow a camel because we keep getting distracted from what we're supposed to be doing we become Pharisees very quickly because what does a Christian walk look like this is a problem we start to think like the Pharisees this is the way that it should look if our garments are perfect if everything's perfect the outside of the cup looks amazing but woe unto you Hypocrites it's a problem we start to think well we have a 10-step program to a better Christian but what does a better Christian look like what does a Christian look like what does adulterous Woman's Christian walk look like compared to Enochs why were they different they're not the same in any way whatsoever but we come up with this guideline we come up with in our heads of thinking this is the way that it should be this is how it should be it shouldn't look like that those people shouldn't be doing that and you might not be completely wrong in that but that's their walk it's not your walk and the problem comes when you start to bring yourself into their walk and start saying hey Lord just hold on a second I'll show you about how to do this give me a minute with this guy and you want to clean everything up make sure you do this make sure you do that you don't know where they are and you start to skip over the important steps of what actually matters to get that person where they want to be we get so focused on Doctrine that we forget the actual beginning steps of what we should have done with these people we start to become Pharisees we start to become Dead Man's Bones there's a reason Jesus only did this to the Pharisees he did not say this to adulterous woman he did not say this to the woman at the well he did not say this to the man at the cross he said it to the really religious people who looked really good and had everything in order he held no punches when he ripped them apart when he did this he held nothing back so we start to think that we know what's best for these people well you shouldn't do that don't be doing this God will get people into their position no matter what he has to do to do it and we can stand right in the way of it of what he's trying to do because we think we got this Lord just take a seat for a minute we'll show you how this is done because we think we know what a Christian life looks like but you look through the Bible what one isn't messy a Christian Life is usually messy Moses's life was pretty messy Moses messed up arguably to the very end Moses didn't get a lot of things right and then when Moses shows up of anybody that wasn't shouldn't have been the guy to do it he couldn't talk right so if I showed up and said I have a message which I couldn't say right and I said Gideon's going to say these words would you even listen to me that's the problem is we get so focused on this is how it's supposed to come this is what it's supposed to look like this is how the Lord moves no Lord does what the Lord wants to do that's why the Lord used a man who had a speech problem to bring the people out of Egypt that's why he did it because he does what he wants to do so we get stuck on these things though as humans we get stuck on the doctrine we get stuck on things that's supposed to look just right well that guy is not qualified nobody's qualified we came up with the qualifications we think this guy's got to have everything together it's got to work just like this the qualifications have to be so perfect I'm not qualified to do this job if you've known me from the beginning you would know that I'm not qualified to do this job I should not be able to do what I'm doing I've stolen from a store until they fired me for it I've done all these things I've done the drugs I've done all these things I should not be the guy for this job I'm not qualified to do it I didn't know how to read until I was in the 10th grade I should not be the guy for this job I'm completely unqualified but we're never qualified that's the problem is we wanted to look a certain way we come up with this whole thing this is how it's supposed to look and then the second that person does something you say whoa whoa wait a minute why'd you do that that's not how it's supposed to go because you're looking to the man you weren't looking at Jesus you weren't looking at the right things that you're supposed to be looking at you were looking at the man and the man will fall the man will mess up Moses came to the very end Moses had walked through the Wilderness with these people Manna had fallen from the heavens all these amazing things that happened and they wind the entire time they threw a fit the entire time if he left them alone for 10 seconds they went off and did something stupid and he had to stay with them all the time he had to do all these things because everything was going like it should they were just walking through the desert and food fell on them it couldn't get more perfect how do you get rid of all the trash these people made how do you do all of these things but it got done miraculously but still they get stuck on well Lord's not here he's not here anymore you know we just we ain't got nothing now we ain't got no water we can't do anything now we ain't got no water everyone's gonna die everyone's gonna die and then the water came again and then the next day well we ain't got no water again where everybody's gonna die we're all done for so Moses walk with these people and had to deal with all these things and at the end did one thing he got mad and by our measuring he had a right to be mad he had to listen to these people whine about God do these amazing things his whole life and it never got better they whined the whole time then at the end all he said was ye Rebels and smacked a stick on a rock because he got mad and Lord said you're done you're all done you can't go in the Promised Land and he showed him the promised land and he didn't get to go in it it was a messy deal David was a messy deal it didn't look like anything it should have Moses murdered a guy so did David if we had those people now times they'd be in prison for the things that they had done but God called them God wanted that guy because that guy would listen because he knew he could get him in the right position to get him to do what needed to be done and he had a purpose for it but we get tossed to and fro we get thrown all over the place on this stuff and we get so stuck on men because it's so much easier to look to a man to do these things for us instead of us looking to God do them for ourselves and we want to make sure well you know if I just get this right get my dress right get all my stuff right then we'll be all good to go and that stuff's not wrong Doctrine is not wrong at all it should be there but the problem is we skip right over the ABCs instantly Jesus simplified everything that he did every time he was asked a question it was a simple answer he didn't get elaborate into any of the things that he said they wanted huge they had questions and they want a Pharisee type answer and he said just love God with everything he got and love your brother the same that's all he said that's a total letdown for those guys they had devoted their whole life to this and then finally this guy shows up and says that he knows all the answers and you broke it down into a sentence are you kidding me we've been carrying these Scrolls around they would carry them on them they would carry them in the boxes that they had on them that's what I was talking about with the phylacteries and different things like that and then you came up and it's just a sentence that's all I need to know that's it it was the greatest commandment so what do we need to do to get into heaven just be converted and be a child what are you talking about I devoted my whole life to this and then you tell me to be a kid about it you tell me to have just be a kid what are you talking about how can we be a child they don't know anything that's the point that is the point we have to break down everything that we think we know or else we become Dead Man's Bones we become perfect on the outside and nothing's happening on the inside so so Jesus sent us out to spread the gospel it was that simple that's what he sent us out to do so what does the gospel mean and I got this a friend of mine was talking to me about this and he said that um his name's white herb his nickname I have for him but the gospel means the good news so we were set up to spread the good news of Jesus but we don't always like to spread the good news of Jesus because it's way too simple we can't walk up to somebody and say if you just love God with everything you have that's all you got to do well I've done that well then the world gets mixed into this and makes it really simple is it's not just in saying the words that's the problem we say the words but then we don't do anything about it yeah I just love Jesus with everything I have well we have to do something we have to move we have to be able to get into God's position and do what he told us to do but we don't like to do that it's easier just to say the words I love God with everything I have but we'd like to skip right over that and Skip into the doctrine because we like to take control of this stuff and we think we know what's going on and we have no idea what's going on but we like to get them in and say Hey you know just do this this and this and this this and you're all good and everything and you got to read these books and you got to hear these tapes and you got to make sure you have this set up your dress set up have your long hair got to make sure you cut your hair don't listen to rock and roll we're getting all these things and we wonder why down the road they're gone because they never got anchored in loving God with everything they had it's that simple but we complicate it as much as humanly possible because it can't be that simple because we keep going right back to the Pharisees um it can't be that simple and there's got to be more to it and there's not more to it there's not more to it at all but the mega churches take on this stuff and they say this you know we just love the Lord we just love the Lord we love the Lord and nothing's happened there's a real love of the Lord if we get the love of the Lord and we love him with everything we have that the Bible is talking about the doctrine will come into place we don't have to do the doctrine side of things we have to spread the good news of Jesus the gospel and he will take it from there we have to learn who Jesus was so who is Jesus Jesus is Love but it's easy to say Jesus is Love and that's overused and we think yeah we get it guy we've got tons of those tracks at Jesus's love cool but who is Jesus who is Jesus to you what experience do you have with Jesus that's the point of it what did Jesus do for you when did he become real to you everything rides on that that is the true love of God is when he becomes real to you Jesus is a man that hung on Cross for you guys it didn't work for the maniac guitar the daughters woman was a different scenario the woman at the well why would he come up with this woman who had all these different husbands why would he do that and then started everything with her and she ran down and told everybody what happened why would he do that why wouldn't he come to the mega church guy Pastor Steve he didn't do that he came to the woman at the well who me that's the love of Jesus he showed up where you needed him to be and he always will but we get distracted because we can't stay where we're supposed to stay we want to wander off so does this work now can we pull up John 14 21 if not I've got it John 14 21. this is the point of all this you're good I can yell um John 14 21 so it says he that hath my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he it is that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him so in the Amplified that says that he will make himself real to you so the point is Jesus does the work we don't do the work but we think we do Jesus said if you love me I will manifest myself to you the doctrine will come all that stuff will show up but the problem is if you don't get Anchored In Jesus it's everything it is everything and if you don't think it's not everything go to John 15 5. John 15 5 he says and I am the vine ye are the branches ye that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing you can do nothing without Jesus but we think we can show up and box it up and tweak it a little bit make it just a touch better and there you go guy give that a shot see if that fits it won't fit it won't work because you don't know what you're doing you don't know why that person has to go through what they have to go through and we get stuck on that stuff why is this happening because it has to I don't know why but it has to why did that person have nothing happen and this person had everything happen to them I don't know why but it had to because that experience had to happen that way we have to do that and God will not override our Free Will so we can mess this up really bad he was trying to get us to go this way but again we boxed them up this is how it's supposed to go I'm going this way and he's going to let you go that way and mess everything up and then he's going to bring you back around he's going to do whatever it has to take to do that and it can look messy it can look like drugs it can look like addiction it can look like depression it can look like leaving the church but God will bring those people back around they're not gone we think well you know they went out from us because they weren't Among Us but no they're just going out and doing what they have to do I don't coming back but I don't know they're not coming back that's the problem is we write them off well they're not doing this right and they're not this right and they don't have the right doctor here and here and here do they love Jesus that's the point this scripture you can't argue with the scripture if you love God he will manifest himself he promised it it will happen and if we don't you if we don't have Jesus we can't do anything he said it we can't go against that so if we just love him with everything we have if we have depression Jesus can fix that if we're out of our position Jesus can fix that if we're addicted Jesus can fix that this is a problem if suicide Jesus can fix that if we have no friends Jesus could fix that we just have to come and get some Jesus but the problem is we're stuck on something we're stuck on a man we love to be stuck on humans all the time and we're right there we can't get over it well this guy did me wrong people will always do you wrong they will do you wrong all the time humans can't help it we will do something wrong and they will do us wrong that is how it goes it shouldn't go that way but it does and then we get stuck right there but the problem is we can't walk down the middle of the road either so when these things start to happen and we start coming up with things and things are happening around everywhere doctrinal things are happening we can't stay right in the middle of the road and say I don't really know about that yet but I'm just going to keep walking with the Lord we can't do that we start to throw everything out well that doesn't match up this timeline doesn't match up that didn't really happen this was a little bit off and then we just start throwing everything out instead of staying right in the middle of the road and letting God reveal it to us in our own experiences we have no idea what we're doing we don't want to stay in our experience because that one's way better but it's not yours God has your experience he knows how to work with you he knows what you need and it doesn't look like what the other guy needs it looks like what you need and that's the problem so the point is it's time to fight we're in the fight of Our Lives and we're not even in our positions we don't even know what we're doing we're just running around like chickens with our heads cut off and it's time to fight because have we seen what's going on in the world we're literally teaching our children to mutilate their bodies we're literally helping them do it and we're paying for it to happen permanently altering them at 12 years old 14 years old and 12 year olds make really bad decisions they just do they don't know what they're doing 20 year olds make really bad decisions some 30 year olds make really bad decisions but we're encouraging them to do it and that's what's happening in this world and we're in the fight of our lives and we don't even realize it when we're in the world where the lgbtq thing has more influence than we do because we're not doing anything about it we're out of position we're not staying where God has us we're not staying right there in God's word doing what we're supposed to be doing we're out of position we've got to find that position we keep thinking it looks like this it looks like that and we want it to be a certain way I would want it to be different I'm a bit of a pit bull when I get on something I will just get stuck to it and I will rip it to pieces and I don't always want to be that guy I'd like to be Solomon Solomon just loves and he would just love a sheep back into the herd and it would be great and he would just come on guy it's going to be okay and Solomon can do that that's Solomon's position and it doesn't mean that positions won't swap that's a problem is you keep boxing God up Solomon always has to do that doesn't mean God's not going to call him to do something different I would show up with that sheep and break its leg and carry it back and stop running off now now you know don't do that anymore but it doesn't mean that God's not going to hold me not going to make me do it in a different way we box got up every time God does what he wants to do but we have to be in our position and ready for whatever he has for us whatever that looks like if we have to go correct something then we need to go correct that if we're going to go love that person more then we need to go love that person more and we have to learn how to do that we can't keep boxing up well listen this is my personality just how I am no it's because you're stubborn and you're not listening because you're out of position you want this certain position I don't want to do that that's not that just doesn't really it's not how I do things it's not how I do things it doesn't matter it's how God does things but we get stuck on what we want to do not what God wants to do we want to make sure that we're in the position that we think is best so we're in the fight of Our Lives if I had a title for this it'd be it's time to fight I don't know if I said that in the beginning but now we know so we're we're in the fight of our lives and you say why you're being a little bit extreme do you know what's happening in the world do you know what the second leading cause of death is for 10 or 35 year olds have you thought about it if you think about it for a second what did you think it was would you think it's cancer would you think it's sickness what would you think it is it's suicide ten-year-olds are more likely to commit suicide than die almost any other way 10 year old children do this because we have perverted everything in this world so badly we have brought things away from God to our own understanding so badly that little kids come up with a way that it's better not to be here anymore they came up with that because someone showed them that they've seen that how did they know to do that but it's the world that we live in it's falling apart the lgbtq the transgender thing is skyrocketing all of a sudden because it's falling apart they're trying to find their identity they're trying to find their position but we just made a bunch of Pharisees out of everything and went full Pharisee on it and started telling them well this is what you got to do no they have they're trying to find their position and no one's there to do it because the parents aren't even in the position we let them have their phones and we let them have all these things and we start to wonder why is this happening because they've seen it it's 24 7 garbage compared to your 10 minutes time with them because you're out of position because well you know the second leading cause of suicide if I say anything kind of off what happens no we have to stay where God puts us to be that's what we have to do we have to stay where God showed us to be and as parents we get out of position that's why everything else is out of position we let that guard down and you let that guard down for a second the devil's right there he's right there and that's the problem is we've let that shield down we're in the fight of our lives and we don't even know where we're at we're just coasting along I'm just trying to stay afloat I'm just trying to keep going that's all I'm trying to do that's where I'm at that's not always a bad thing but when the person next to you is on a position then we're in trouble we have to stay all together with our Shields my shield has to be on Gideon's head the next guy has to be on my head if I can't hold it and there's somebody in the middle that needs help they're in really big trouble because I'm not in my position because I've gotten out of where God put me to be because I wanted to be somewhere else because I wanted to do it this way I didn't want to listen it doesn't make sense to do it that way God has a plan God knows what he's supposed to do so if we go to Joshua 1 13 through 15. Joshua 1 13-15 this is where we're at and we might not realize it we don't know our positions and we get out of position we're in really big trouble so it says remember the word which Moses the servant of God commanded you saying the Lord your God hath given you rest and hath given you this land your wives your little ones and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan but ye shall pass before your brethren armed all the Mighty Men of Valor and help them until the Lord had given your brother and rest as he had given you and you also have possessed the land which the Lord God your the Lord your God has given thee when ye shall return onto the land of your possession and enjoy it which Moses the Lord's servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrise so we need a rest people need a rest but we're out of position we can't hold on because we're looking around getting distracted and our brother in need of rest but we got to have the rest first but we've gotten out of that position we haven't gotten anchored into God and we're getting off on all sorts of crazy stuff because it's so much easier to get on that stuff it's so much easier to say well I'm the most revelated I know all of these things I figured out the secrets of life no you haven't you haven't figured out anything that's the problem is we like to exalt ourselves we like to become Pharisees and we've got all this stuff narrowed down so all you got to do is this this and this and this and this no we don't know what that looks like we don't know what people's walks look like and it's time for arrest our Brethren need the rest just like the Lord has given us but if we don't know that we need the rest then we're in really big trouble we can't get in our position we can't get where we're supposed to be holding our shield and when the Devil Comes we don't know to just keep walking forward with god with that Shield we've got to keep walking forward with God we've got to keep holding that Shield up and keep protecting our burn and protecting ourselves and protecting our kids we're not doing anything to change this and when the Devil comes and starts smacking on that shield and you hear it just boom boom keep holding the shield God's coming Jesus is coming Keep Holding On The Shield but we don't like to do that we get distracted don't get distracted as the world keeps coming with lgbtq as the world keeps coming with a transgender hold on to the shield as you keep saying you're not going to make it hold on to the shield as he keeps saying you ain't got enough hold on to the shield as he keeps saying you're never going to be good enough you're never going to be able to hold it long enough keep holding on the shield stand there The Shield will hold Jesus is coming he's coming keep holding on that Shield because everyone else around you Deeds you to be in that position whatever that position looks like and we like to think it looks at these major these huge positions we like the way those things look but it doesn't look that way it looks like prayer it looks like you praying all the time for your family it looks like you're doing whatever you can to show them more love I'm not talking about justifying sin I'm talking about loving them they need your help they need to see what it looks like but when you don't do it and then we look around why is this happening because you're doing it because they don't know what it's supposed to look like we have no idea because we've gotten out of our position we've got to hold on to that Shield everyone else in the family is depending on it if we move a half an inch that devil will get through that Shield we can't move we have to hold fast we have to stay where we're supposed to be with the Lord we have to stay in that position no matter what it looks like if it looks like the guy that sweeps the floor stay in that position hold that Shield you're the same guy that's the guy's holding a shield over you it's the same thing we're in the same fight and we're in the fight of our lives and we don't even realize it a lot of times we don't even know what's going on we want to stay just completely secluded to it but they keep pushing these agendas and keep pushing these agendas and some of these things that started in the 50s some of these things have started way way before all of this stuff it's been going on for a very long time and now it's just starting to manifest itself because we haven't paid attention we haven't stayed in our position we haven't done what we're supposed to be doing we've gotten off on doing all of these different things and we haven't gotten into the love of God and made sure that our children are anchored in the love of God do you know that you know that Jesus is real to you how do you know that what is your experience what experience have you had my experience looks totally different than everyone else's like I said every time we've come to the lord it's totally different if you have to build Dan his testimony it's different than my testimony the Lord brings everybody in a different way but the point is we all have the anchor in Christ we have to have that anchor in Christ nothing else matters if we're not sure that we're anchored in God and that's the problem is we've gotten distracted everything is a distraction have you looked into what phones do to you phones will permanently alter your brain when we get stuck in that farm and these kids have seen all the things that they shouldn't see you're crazy if you think to Heaven these they can get onto all these things with our phone and then we're doing nothing to counteract that whatsoever we put the shield completely down and we're not doing anything and we're wondering why is everything going crazy because we haven't done anything because we're out of position we've got to stay in the position God wants us in and we can't move until he tells us to move we have to move forward if we move it forward as a unit and keep going with the Lord not getting stuck on things not getting distracted by things keep walking forward with the Lord no matter what that looks like keep pushing forward with the Lord keep holding that shield no matter what comes keep pushing forward but we like to just stay right where we're at and we've got to figure things out keep walking stop throwing everything out because something didn't line up quite right and keep walking in the middle of the road with the Lord so in closing if the musicians want to come we keep we need to pray more we need to get in our position more it's time to fight it's the fight of our lives and we might not even realize how bad it is it's bad we need to make sure that we're Anchored In God ourselves before we can start going out and showing everyone else what their problem is when you don't even actually know what your problem is we're supposed to spread the Gospel of Jesus we're not supposed to spread everything we think that it should be we're supposed to spread the love of God if we don't have the love of Jesus then he will not manifest himself he does the work we don't do the work but we get off thinking that we're going to do it we're just going to help out a little bit it doesn't work that way that's not how it goes we can show them the love of God we can live it we can show them in the Bible we can tell them our testimonies but when it comes to getting that real experience you're not going to do it you can never do it and we have to be okay with that that's the hardest part about this is we'd like to just well if we can just do more if I can just kind of you know get him to church and get them to church I'll pay for your gas I'll do all these things it's not wrong but when they don't do that God's going to do the work and he's going to how he sees fit to do it and if it means that they're not going to show up to church for a couple months then they're not going to show up to church for a couple months they've got to do it you cannot do it you can sit them in that Pew and give them their times money to pay and make sure everything is dressed up perfectly and it still won't work you can do all of those things and if God doesn't manifest it doesn't work it doesn't go that way we had to let God do it let off the controls and stand in our position with our brother and sister and stay we keep wanting to move around we move forward but we can't move off to the side or anything like that when that unit is all together like that the problem is it's slow and it's not very maneuverable but it will keep moving forward and it will keep protecting all the people inside of it and they'll keep moving they're going to get there the Lord is going to get there and the Lord is going to come around you with those Shields he's going to get there we have to stay in our positions and keep fighting the fight and not get distracted we love to be distracted stay in your positions love more pray for them pray for them with everything you have the best thing to do is pray we like to say the only thing we can do is pray no the best thing to do is pray that's what you have to do we can pray that's what it looks like we want to look like we draw the sword and we're just going to go start cutting things apart we can't do that if you show up to a fight with a devil and you don't know what you're doing you'll lose because you realize you didn't realize that it's not you fighting it's God fighting God is holding your harm up God is holding your Shield up he's the one doing the work you just have to keep listening to him and stay in your position so let's pray Lord we just thank you Lord Lord we thank you for this time together Lord we just pray that you help us to stay Lord where we're supposed to be Lord Lord help us sustain that position Lord whatever that looks like Lord I pray Lord that you just help us to understand what you have us Lord where you have us Lord Lord and that we can't look around Lord we just stay focused on you Lord give us that tunnel vision Lord stay where we're supposed to stay with you Lord Jesus Lord I pray that we try to stop fixing things Lord and we just understand that Jesus fixes it Lord no matter what it is you're the one that handles it not us Lord we thank you for these things Lord make yourself more real to us every day Lord Jesus in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen
