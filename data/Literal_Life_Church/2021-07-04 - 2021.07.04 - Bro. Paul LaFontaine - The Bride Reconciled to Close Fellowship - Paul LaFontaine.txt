========================================

last sunday in hosea we're so glad this morning to know the master of the wind so no so glad to know he can calm the storm and i just might mention that incident where he allowed a son of god spoke to him to speak to the storm in colorado i might mention that here at the end of the service today but i'll mention one thing that the lord spoke to him after he spoke to the storm and a storm brewing that was going to come up in the colorado mountains and he did speak to the storm and within just a few minutes all the clouds went away with sunshine but it was after that that god spoke to him as he was walking back down the mountain and said why don't you just walk with me a while he said i'd love to walk with you it's what my service is about this morning god loves to walk with us i want to speak about the bride reconciled to close fellowship the bride reconciled the close fellowship you want to be close to him today so hosea chapter 2 and verse 14 says therefore behold i will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak comfortably unto her it's god speaking about israel after she had been adulterous and after she had got away from him he said i will alert her i will call her to come away and bring her into the wilderness and i think god brings us into the wilderness sometimes that represents trials but i think in a wilderness with god it's so he can get us away from all the other voices that we're listening to and all the other busyness so he can speak comfortably to us and i will give her her vineyards from vince and the valley of acor for a door of hope and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of egypt and it shall be at that day saith the lord that thou shalt call me ishi husband and shalt call me no more bellai which means master you will no longer call me master but you will call me husband for i will take away the names of balaam out of her mouth and they shall no more be remembered by their name and in that day will i make a covenant for them with the beast of the field with the fowls of the air and with the creeping things of the ground and i will break the bowl and the sword and the battle of the earth out of the earth and will make them to lie down safely and i will betroth thee unto me forever yea i will betroth thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving kindness and in mercies i will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt know the lord amen song of solomon chapter 2. the song of solomon chapter 2 and one verse there verse 10 my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away heavenly father we just pray that you will bless us as we worship you lord and we can always sense when you're present it just makes us just want to reach out and tell you how much we love you lord we can always sense when there's another presence in the room lord besides all of us lord even the youngest child i feel sometimes consents there's something different that's in our midst lord jesus you come to minister to us this morning and to find us lord and draw us closer to yourself and lord we pray that you will find us and that you will draw us and that you will speak those things that you had in your mind in your heart to the people and when you bring those things father i pray that we would have the heart to be able to receive them with all of our hearts and lord know that it's a word from you that you love us so much that you've sent your word to heal us to restore us to strengthen us to encourage us to give us joy lord i pray whatever it would be this morning that we would have receptive hearts and be reconciled to you and we just pray that you'll just put that within me that i need this morning not my own words but put something within me lord that you can speak through me and call the people we pray in jesus name we ask him amen amen god bless you shake hands before you take your seat with someone god bless you each one and all of our visitors if i miss one of you welcome this morning it's so wonderful to have you the depth of god's reconciling power when he wants to reconcile one of his sons and daughters or his bride the depth of it goes beyond what i'm able to speak of myself or able to articulate and they've just been asking the lord to help me and i'll say personally through this little series of talking about the bride last weekend we we feel a real personal drawing towards the lord deeper than we've ever felt before for us to consider these things personally in our lives and in our hearts for all too often we tend to take for granted our relationship with the lord all too often in the times we live in everything else seems to take priority over our relationship with the lord i think some of us will be honest enough to say that's just the times we live in and things kind of crowd our lives and get in our way and even this reference in the scripture that he'll bring her back to when she sang as a young woman as a young bride i think god desires that original fellowship that you originally have from him but we have so many things to get in our way so many things to make us tired sometimes we're too tired even to give ourselves in a relationship and that's familiar because in our relationships with one another sometimes we're too tired sometimes we need to have a discussion and we're wore out for the whole day and we know there needs to be reconciliation and something said and we're just wore out from life that the energy to put into relationships is not left and that's the times we live in so if we're wore out of energy to put into relationships then we know that sometimes it can affect our relationship with the lord we also have a very in our culture a very uh material driven culture we have a very uh industrious type culture we have a push behind us all the time to to do things and to do this and do house projects and to do this and to push for war and then we got to save the money for it and then we got to make some extra money for it and we got to do this and we got to do that we got house projects and things and i'm not preaching at you i'm preaching at me because we can become overwhelmed and overcharged and over over or just overly worked can you say man and and and what i i think some things can suffer from that and we're not aware of it but i'll tell you when my relationship with the lord suffers all over those things i start to feel a bit guilty and i feel like that he's the one putting in trying to call me there's a song lauren o'haras used to to sing and it's god speaking he said i miss my time with you i missed my time with you our moments together i need to be with you each day and it hurts me when you say you're too busy trying to serve me busy trying to even serve me but how can you serve me when your spirit is empty and god says there's a longing in my heart wanting more than just a part of you it's true i miss my time with you and if there's any failure in the relationship to stay close it's it's on my side it's not on his side and so i don't think god makes us feel guilty about that i don't think god does god is not a pusher god is not one to push someone into relationship god does not want god is not a god of guilt can you say man god is not a god of guilt god is the god who wants to remove guilt the guilt of your sin can you say amen the guilt of your trouble the guilt of what you've been through god is a god if he went to calvary he was showing in love to remove all guilt and condemnation of sin can you say man but so many our lives are guilt-driven today and even when it comes to a heart that wants to serve god we feel guilt because we're not doing our part of the relationship but it's not god bringing that on us he just woos us and as the scripture even says here he's wooing her and alluring her because he wants to come into the wilderness and speak comfortable words and hear you speak back to him it's real become very personal to me because i'm a busy man and especially in the last few years uh busier some people used to say oh you're so busy you don't have any time for me i used to resent that but i have to admit now i'm a busy man now i still have time for something that's of god and something to help you that's who i'm here for that's what i'm here for but listen now my my concern personally is we're not so driven by other things that our relationship with god and the loving relationship and the communion and the fellowship is is is missed so you know when we talked last sunday about the depth of reconciliation we taught you that it goes beyond forgiveness to reconcile with a relationship is going beyond forgiveness i'm sorry and there's i forgive you but god in his reconciliation is not just bringing somebody to forgiveness even for salvation and all that but god is reconciling sons and daughters of god back to the fellowship they had that was in the garden of eden calvary has not just purchased forgiveness for our sins but calvary has washed away our sins and put us back into a relationship with jesus christ and that's what redemption is all about can you say amen and the the we find this theme then in is expressed in the service invisible union of the bride of christ we listened to it yesterday i'd encourage you to listen to it as brother branham speaks of invisible union of the bride of christ just the title makes you want to ponder and just look at it and realize what is god trying to say to us this invisible union of the bride of christ because you see it's about a union it's a union of a relationship and that's why last sunday i read you all the scriptures that god began to refer to his relationship as a as not bali is not not a master you used to refer to me as i'm your servant you're my master but he says i'm trying to move you to a relationship now of bride and he starts to refer to i'm the groom you're the bride and what he's saying in that this is the type of relationship i want and you know in this life that relationship is more exclusive and closer than any other relationship in life and when god begins to refer to his to his people that way you're not just my servants but your bride we ought to pay attention and what we've become in the message is that i'm in the bride because i go to a message church i'm in the bride because i have message tapes i'm in the bride because i go to this and no no it's not a movement it's not a movement it's a relationship by a new birth it's a union between you and christ it's an invisible marriage that takes place that's what this message is all about we've made it a movement we've made pride because we're part of this we're part of that i'm in the bride because i have message books i'm in the bride because i go to brother paul's church but i always correct that and say no no no no this is a by a new birth this is a relationship with jesus christ i read you to the quote a couple weeks ago brother bam says i don't bring a message one moment one moment to be able to build a denomination or to build an organization or point the people to me but he said if i can accomplish this one thing and that's to establish a relationship between god and the people it's the purpose of the message and if you're invested in the message 30 years and you're in no relationship with him then then you need to examine your entire life and examine why you believe this thing because this is not about books and tapes or a movement or what you grew up in this is about a person this message is about a person see while other people are preaching the person yeah they do the portions of revelation they know they preach about the person but under the message the person of christ has been fully unveiled to us planet earth has never received more of a revelation of jesus christ than under this message we know him by god's grace we know him for all that he is and that's for the bride to know and uh so it's you know a union of a marriage is deeper than a servant or a like a a physical brother or physical sister or uh or a servant and a master relationship but it's bride and bridegroom and we took you through all the references to show you as he begins to speak in isaiah and through the prophets and then john the baptist and then he refers to bride and bridegroom and then we come to the end of the bible where he says the marriage of the land has come and the bride hath made herself ready it's god that's starting to refer to there's a special group of people there's an elect lady there's one that's not servants that but they're my wife they're my wife and to me it should speak to us now okay praise the lord i'm his wife but it calls me to an intimate relationship with him if he speaks of a bride and he says i will have a bride then we must understand and feel honored by that because the level of that term being his chosen bride his chosen bride and how many believe that how many of you are his chosen bride you know when a man chooses he's got all the all the women and these guys if he's a holy ghost-filled man he's looking for a holy ghost-filled woman that's all he's looking for the holy ghost filled uh brother brahm says in that marriage and divorce if if she's pretty or choosing of a bride if she's pretty that's great but she's got to have the character of the holy ghost and there's things we're looking for so but then that narrows down narrows down you're not going to marry all those women you can't marry all those women and there might be a lot of lovely ones filled with the holy ghost but yet there's going to be one day a chosen one i chose her she chose me and by the way she has a choice too by the way it's not just you choosing her she has a choice as well god doesn't override our choice we choose him as well but he chose us before the foundation of the world and we feel the honor of him he chose me as his bride and we respond back but you see now it's not just about the term it's about you have been chosen his is chosen bride and it's an honor to hold that title but with it goes this exclusive unashamed relationship with one another this intimacy this love that is shared and when you share that love with him you don't share that love with anyone else the intimacy that you have with christ some of those things cannot be shared with anyone else and the worship that you have for him cannot be shared with anyone else and this is what happens in the book of hosea as israel starts to share her heart with just idols and with everyone and you'll find in the book of hosea especially in that book he refers to this adulterous relationship and i know that's a very extreme thing to talk about in the service it was extreme for them to talk about it was very open open but god was not holding back he was saying that i feel as you begin to give your hearts to isles i'm going to say that it's like being an adulterous relationship where my wife is sharing her her worship and her life and her heart with other husbands and with other men and it's a very jolting thing and i want to i want to elaborate a little bit on it this morning and i'm prepared for it to get quiet a little bit and then maybe at the end you'll you'll see what i'm trying to present to you by the grace of god if he speaks of a bride and he says we have one and we have that term the chosen bride it's special it's beyond a casual acquaintance uh it's beyond uh just the relationship of an uncle that bails you out financially every now and then it's beyond the relationship of a grandpa because even brother brown says god has no grandchildren in the kingdom of god because there's a difference in a parent and a grandchildren a parent will correct a child a grandpa or grandma becomes dodie sometimes and when the child needs to be corrected sometimes grandparents will back off sometimes they try to back their parents off don't thank them they didn't really mean it i'm speaking from experience but then sometimes you want them to spank them you better spank that kid but we don't want to do it but people have made the christian walk where daddy's a dodi it's a dodie grandpa they're serving and i can get money from him anytime and i can get if i get hurt i can cry to him anytime and i can go this and i go this but to see there's no there's no marriage relationship there it's just a dodie grandpa and grandchildren brother evan says god doesn't have any grandchildren he has sons and daughters birthed by the kingdom of god birth by the new birth and and so now we see then it's not a grandpa it's not a housemaid and i read to you some women in the bible last sunday i referred to it was interesting to see in some of these women like sarah and esther and um uh referred to uh abigail as well and many of these women they came to god for a need or they came to their husband rebecca came and she was gonna just do a nice act of watering the camels of of isaac but she didn't realize these women didn't realize abigail didn't realize they would actually be given and chosen as the bride as the wife they just came to they just came to give a service to him i have a need in my life and sometimes we didn't realize that you had a need maybe you were coming to god for some i'm in a desperate situation in my marriage or my family or whatever it is and you're coming to him for certain things but then you realize our needs can be met but then then when we become his bride and he chooses his bride it's not about just our needs being met but now i'm his wife so how how can i serve my husband christ's needs amen and that becomes different because nobody else wants to serve him that way but the bride does because brother branham says as a wife serves her husband she serves the lord why is that ever not popular anymore that's not politically correct well i can read about 50 000 other quotes that are becoming more more and more not politically correct to read but i still believe the word is the word and i still believe when you honor relationships the way god said they should be not out of demand but out of respect your homes your marriages and your families will have power and be blessed you don't tamper with this word and accept new modern ideas in modern ways and not pay for it families are paying dearly in this world because they've got away from the principles of god's word and the blessed position of a woman and that that connection she makes with a man and her husband she can build him up and she can set him on on fire to do what he needs to do like no other person in this world it's the same spiritually he didn't want just a servant to just run and go do what they're told to do christ wanted a bride this is an exclusive love it's an exclusive fellowship it's not shared with anyone this love is a different kind of love and that's why then there there there when there has been a true union for like my mom and my dad for 56 years with someone when there's been a union like that a true union for 56 years with someone when god takes one of those life is not what it was anymore when they have to lose their loved one you've been with somebody that long my mom talks about it with me you've been with somebody that long in a true union and god takes one of them i was reading a story yesterday of a couple in that uh that condo that collapsed in florida and they had just went across the street to have a a lunch with their son or whatever it was a dinner with his son because he was he could see their thing across in their condo and he wanted to live there and watch over them had the last dinner with them and they always said their whole life we don't want one to go before the other because they loved each other so much and sure enough they went down in that thing and they went together and the son he said that's the only joy i have is they got to go together but you take a one who's been together 65 years like my mom and some of these other marriages and god takes one of them there's that that void in the heart none of us will understand that and why is it because there was this union that shared with with no one else in this world that's the kind of marriages we need that's the kind of union we need it was the garden it was the fall in the garden that made adam and eve begin to become selfish and blame everybody else for their problems they had unity and oneness and then all of a sudden when satan got in and began to mess up the family and mess up the marriage when they fell by sin all of a sudden god comes to adam and says what what has happened and he turns to her instead of instead of saying we fell together he said the wife that you gave me she's the problem well if he was still in oneness he'd never done that to his wife i've been in counseling sessions where the the husband he didn't do nothing wrong he's standing there blaming the wife the whole time just blaming him blair said she's my problem if she would get straightened out our marriage would be fine and i'm the guy that's got to say no your marriage would not be fine mainly because your attitude but you take someone that has been married that long in the in in a union and you realize 56 years because the other person was so attached to you in spirit more than anyone else in life not even a new husband or wife can replace that sometimes they want to just go on to be with the lord so they can be with their mate and to be with the lord life is never the same that's the type of close union but friends i want it to be that close with christ i want my relationship with him to be that close can you say amen that i can never be apart from him it hurts me to be out of fellowship with him it hurts me to be apart from him this isn't can you say man this isn't just a part-time affair can you say amen life is a life can i want to live so that i can never be apart from him this isn't a part-time affair it isn't some flirtatious relationship marriage is not just a flirtatious relationship or a passing thing or you see a person for one night or for one hour or whatever it is that's not what marriage is it's a lifelong fellowship intimacy and relationship can you say amen i didn't finish the story but when sin came in then we have adam instead of standing with his wife blaming his wife and when god went to eve eve says the serpent she beguiled me and all of a sudden everybody is blaming everybody else everybody's blaming everybody else instead of trying to find a unity in the marriage this stuff some of this stuff is not my note so somebody must need it there is a a oneness that is special to a marriage and it is a marriage relationship with god as well with christ and and so now we live in a world of relationships where partners go to another partner just to get their needs met every now and then but that's not a union that's the world we live in matter of fact you know some people maybe want me to speak of world events and stuff going on i'll tell you friends outside of these doors that's how i felt last night i don't even want to look at the news anymore when you walk outside these doors you're living in the craziest world that's ever been on the face of the earth people brother bram say they go insane they are there we are the news and mothers want to go in the military and they want to be honored as sergeants and move up in the in the ranks of military mothers wanting to do that and everybody promoted i think it's a wonderful thing i can be a better mother that way and i said god how deceived can a person be in their minds god never intended for a mom to go away in the name of her country to be away from her children that long but how you're not going to tell them now they're going off in their minds they've gone crazy no one thinks properly about this stuff anymore and that's not there's more crazy stuff than that some stuff i can't even mention over the pulpit you live in a crazy world i'll tell you i'm glad to be in the word and i'm glad to have a place like this set aside that i can come out of this crazy world but relationship in the world they can just go with any partner just to get their needs met every now and then but that's not a union i wonder how many people want to be called the bride and all they do is talk every now and then with the bridegroom you don't you see you just everyone we have sometimes sunday morning christians sunday morning is that that's the only time i got to give my son anymore i want it it's good to be in church i want to be in church but this just isn't a sunday morning affair under this message this is a relationship every day that you are connected in union with christ every day and when others in your family are distant from christ and they're not that's a real challenge because you've got to realize i'm not following them i'm staying in my relationship with the lord and don't be just sunday morning christians sunday morning people that are just that that just that's when i go that's when i spend my time i feel better about myself when i leave i'm here to tell you this is a marriage relationship to be married to christ the word can you say man and it is a close relationship not just sundays when we're in church you don't micromanage a relationship like marriage you're part of one another how many can marriages can say you don't micromanage one another just me and brother kyle i guess now it's a why why don't you micromanage one another because it's a different relationship you can micromanage a servant you can micromanage your kids sometimes sometimes but in marriage it's a different relationship and you don't micromanage this i i need you this certain time and i need you but here i don't need you and so i need my me time and you just you know and no i've told some marriages in counseling you shouldn't have got married because you don't understand what the marriage relationship is you can't go off and i'm just going to do my own thing and i don't need you no no it doesn't work that way this is a different relationship but we do that with the lord sometimes we micromanage our relationship with the lord i come to him when i need him but what about when he needs you he doesn't need us well he created us to be his bride he loves us he wants time with us i didn't know the service was going to go this way but i feel his presence here and i'm going to stay in this channel the marriage relationship people have put it in an affair they put it in it they bring their selfishness into it and i'm telling you you have to be burnt of all your selfishness and you can't micromanage and say this this that and the other you can't do that it's not that type of relationship now not only is the bride and groom spoke of in the nature of relationship in the bible but adultery is spoken of in the bible both naturally and spiritually and it's spoken very plainly adultery also fornication also having an affair and also flirting with someone who you're not married to all of this is in the bible and so and many times god crosses it over to spiritually and he talks about i hate to mention that in public but the bible talks about and that means that it's speaking spiritually also of the natural woman who gives herself to all kinds of men but also it speaks of a spiritual we have the great horror we have the church we have ones and what it is basically spiritually given your heart and given yourself to any seed of any man but god wants an exclusive relationship where a wife only receives the seed of her husband so if the bible if the bible speaks of these things all these things an a fair relationship an adultery relationship flirting someone i want to let you know all of these pornography all of these were never meant to be and they're a damage to a true marriage and a true union you can't have a true union you might be living with a woman but if you got pornography in your life you'll never have the right union with that woman god gave you those things are of the world and they damage the union and sometimes you can live with them for years but if you dabble in flirting with other women whether you know them or not it's going to bring damage to the union you can't have open fellowship with one another your intimacy cannot be right when there's another woman involved so god speaks pretty plain and proverbs in so many places it's such a damage so it's the same spiritually and so because it's throughout the bible i have pretty good grounds to speak about spiritual adultery it's all through the bible it's all through the message and you just have to trust me on that is that some places the way brother branham words things it's so plain sometimes can i read that it's just so plain because god had to be playing that not only in the natural relationship you don't play with these things it is a it is a special relationship you don't play with it you give it you're all can you say man but then when we come to our lord we don't play with our relationship with the lord he loves us we're to love him back we're to stay as close to him as we can stay in the hour we live in he wants fellowship with us and this quote here we're going to read in the second coming of the lord early on in the message he says could you imagine if you guys have that quote could you imagine coming in at nighttime tired weary worn if you're a farmer mechanic preacher whatever you are come in when you go to your little home you're longing to you can get there you open the door and a sweet little wife stands there she greets you she's all prettied and cleaned up she walks over and kisses you on the cheek she says dad you're tired she sets you down in a chair she sets herself down in your lap and she puts her arms around you and she pats you it just seems like then that you're not tired something picks you up it's something that god gave you for that purpose it's a part of you now she's a true wife but if those lips has kissed another man that day or some other time what if you're conscious of that what if them arms has hugged another man she is absolutely abomination on your lap that burn kiss burns like a judas kiss those arms you'd rather they wouldn't be around you oh may she be all she all prettied up her hair may be curly her eyes may be brown her cheeks may be rosy her little skirts may be ironed she may be so pretty but if that real genuine godly respect and love and confidence isn't there she'd be better off to stay off your lap you don't want you don't want nothing to do with her she's an indebted to you i don't care how pretty she makes herself she's still wrong until she has proven to be a real genuine sweetheart loving nobody but you no other kiss from her lips but yours no other arms must hold her but yours and you know it what a feeling what a consolation that is husband and wife which is a type of christ and his church and when you go to your church you may have the best pews in the city you may have the highest steeple there is in the city you may have the best pipe organ you may dress the best you you may sing like a mockingbird but all of that if you're kissing and flirting with the world that kiss on the cheeks of christ is the judastarian kiss he doesn't want nothing to do with you he looks upon your wedding engagement ring and he finds the tablet move he finds love has gone it's a form he finds loyalty is gone you've committed fornications with the world you go to dances and boogie woogie parties and watch old dirty television programs you are committing adultery with christ on him as calling him your husband that's pretty straight but when we look at dirty television on our phones and i say phones because televisions are almost out and we want to claim that we're the bride of jesus christ we're committing spiritual adultery now you excuse me for being straight but i'm preaching to everybody here this morning this is a relationship that's honored and sacred you make a mistake you quickly brings i have made a mistake and you got a husband i believe that will forgive you but what he wants is faithfulness what he wants is an exclusive relationship he doesn't want you flirting with the world all week long and then come you raise your hands in church on sunday that's not what this is it's not what the message is it's not what the bride is it's not what christianity even is that's not what it's about it's just an affair with jesus christ it is a committed faithful relationship with him that's why you talk to people say if you're not ready to make that commitment in my you better wait until god has moved your heart i'm ready to make a lifelong commitment this is a marriage i talk to young children being baptized and i say there's two or three steps for reasons why we get baptized and that is we die to ourselves and so we're put under the water as if we what do we do with dead people we bury dead people right the little kid says yes and we bury people so you're buried in christ but i don't leave you underneath the water you come back up again the new man in christ it's a type to the church can you say man but i said one of the parts of baptism is that you take on his name and that's an honor i will baptize you today in the name of the lord jesus christ you take on his name as his bride and that means everything that you do you should watch what you do you should taste stay close to the word because now you represent jesus christ you're a christian follower wife of jesus christ you don't go out and say i was baptized today and go right back to the things of the world no no i've changed my name i'm no longer my name but i'm taking on mrs jesus christ that's a special thing when brother brown preached these things choosing of a bride and marriage and divorce and and the restoration of the bride tree and invisible union of the bride these are not just sermons but they are announcements to this generation that this is the time i'm going to have my bride hallelujah now the human spirit can only take so much unfaithfulness when a person's married or even a even a boyfriend or girlfriend you know we this thing is so loose anymore when when the prophet talks about kissing and you come home and your wife has kissed another man there's something about the our human spirit that it hurts us terribly if we're married or even a boyfriend girlfriend if we know that they have been with another person or kissed another person or whatever that that doesn't go so well even if it's a boyfriend or girlfriend hey you're committed to me i'm your boyfriend and your girlfriend what are you doing over there what are you talking to her for there's all these jealousies that rise up and some of them are normal some of them are normal because the bible says god's jealous over us with can you say amen god's jealous over you and paul said as the prophet i'm jealous over you as a bride with a godly jealousy did you know there was such a thing god is jealous over your soul and your relationship and you being his bride he's jealous over you with a godly jealousy and so some of this is normal but you'll watch it it's that our human spirit can't handle someone being unfaithful when we've been committed as a marriage or a friend even a friend we we we are crushed when someone violates our relationship the human spirit a wife especially cannot hardly handle it when there's been unfaithfulness from a man in a marriage a man i just heard i just had a testimony last sunday of a man and uh he was talking to me a little bit about it and my it's just he found out uh early on there was things going on and he says i wept i wept for hours i went for days i hadn't heard that too mentioned a man but but it doesn't only crush a woman it crushes a man found out my wife was unfaithful and it just couldn't believe it couldn't believe it just crushed him just wept for days because the human spirit now friends think of that think if your husband failed you or your wife failed you or said i want a divorce or think of you young people think when you're going with someone it looks like everything's going well and they just they go with someone else overnight think of how you feel the human spirit doesn't handle it well i want you to think of how i feel and think how god feels because you can multiply it by 100 million times and see how his love has been crushed that he's been hurt i miss my time with you they're giving their hearts to everything else here and and they committed their heart to me it shows up in the human spirit you know i realize i'm talking here to many in the streaming and some here that been through relationships that broken down families i am excited to have many people here that have come from broken families experienced divorce experience these different things and guess what everything that has fallen and void in your life my god and i'm watching this my god can fill the void he can restore relationships and we believe in that but if the other party is not ready or they're not going to do it god can restore you in such a relationship with jesus christ that you can go on with the lord it wasn't for the grace of god some of your marriages here wouldn't still be together can you say man but you know boyfriend girlfriend it's even that affects you know i don't know if some of you older ones has been going to my church for many years remember i used to like tell the story of the little girl who wrote gave a picture to her boyfriend because she he asked for a picture of her so they're going together now we're going together yeah we're boyfriend and girlfriend and so she writes she gets this big picture and she writes a big thing with note with it says honey i love you i'd go to the end of the earth with you i love you so much and she went on and on with poems and everything this is a this is an eternal thing i love you and my feelings right she just went on and on and on and then the guy turned the picture over and it said p.s if we ever break up i'd like to have my picture back and i'd like to talk about that because that's the world we live in they stand at the altar and that's why i try to say hey listen let's mean what you say you take that vow before god you better mean it but today they can take it and be separated the next week because the world has taught us they have watered down the marriage relationship and my message to you is that satan would like to water down what bride and bridegroom really mean it's not that you came to all the conventions in the message this is an intimacy and relationship with him that if your world falls apart if everything falls apart if preachers leave the message god didn't leave you your husband didn't leave you can you say amen if your family falls apart you can go on with the relationship with jesus christ this relationship should not end [Applause] because he's faithful to you other people may not be faithful but he will always be faithful to you he just wants us to be faithful to him you can't have an affair with the world and this is the way brother brown lords it now just say the way you say it you can't have an affair with the world or a denominational fair affair and be married to christ at the same time and this is a term he begins using in invisible union coming from the scripture if you guys would bring up romans 7 verse 3. romans 7 3 is his text in invisible union where he says so then while her husband romans 7 and verse 3 so then while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man so now he's speaking naturally and he's saying now if her husband's dead she's free to marry because why if she has two husbands if she has two two men and even in this case where she's going to the two men she is an adulteress god never intended for it to be that way but that's the natural part of it that the woman can't be remarried unless her husband is dead romans 7 4 goes to the spiritual verse 4 please wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who's raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit from god spiritually speaking that old things of the world and that denominational husband has to be dead so you can come to a new birth with christ alone and if that denominational husband is not dead or if you're having an affair with the denominate with the system of denomination and trying to still embrace christ and that's why i have millions of people on the face of the earth their union they're tied to the belief of their denomination and then over here say i believe in christ but really you're married to the systems and the beliefs of that denomination you can't paul says you can't carry on a relationship like that one has to be dead and then he says you can't have a denominational affair now that's not being married that's just an affair an affair is when you're married and you're having an affair with someone else and your husband don't know about it everybody okay with me being plain this is a unique service this morning but he says in the scripture the union with christ is an exclusive union and we don't share a love with uh or another union with someone else we can speak of these things an affair he said you can't carry on a denominational affair or a flirting with denominational systems and embrace jesus christ he wants an exclusive relationship now last week there was a reason i went back to hosea i discovered that this prophet to israel or ephraim they're referred to in hosea and unfortunately today i will not be able to read all the scriptures i wanted to read through there but you will find in the book of hosea as you read it it's referred to as ephraim who is israel and he spoke quite a bit on this subject of adulterousness in fact god in fact god had hosea mary a woman who would become an adulteress now the theologians argue over this they many of them like to say god had the prophet mary uh a prostitute there's discussions over that and i like to lean towards it because we don't know the first but god knew that she wouldn't be faithful is what it was and so he in hosea 1 says i want you to marry this woman who will not be faithful to you and that's what she did he married her and jose is probably saying god are you sure what are you doing this for i want you to marry this woman she will be gone but become an adulteress and but i'm doing it because i need to do i need to display a sign to all of israel that this is how i feel that you have become adulterous to me and i want you to be exclusive to me i want to be your husband i want you to be my wife so he has hosea marry this woman sure enough she turns out she starts to be in affairs with other men and it's all lived out in his life so that he can experience what the feeling is naturally express it to the people what it feels like when a wife is unfaithful share it with israel and say this israel is how i feel when you commit adultery on me and you give your heart to other idols and worship other ones besides me this is how i feel and so hosea chapter 1 and you can read all this i don't have time to as i said to go through all the scriptures today but you watch israel israel she's taken with adult uh adultery idols and that's why he calls her an adulteress in verse chapter five or verse three he says she's hiding you know i just want to let you know there's nothing you can hide from your lord in chapter 6 verse 10 god's grieved about it grieve by it remember this is what hosea his wife told him he felt it israel seen it and he they even watched it in the prophet as hosea suffered through the reality of a woman being unfaithful to her husband israel watched it in hosea's life and finally caught it that this is what she was doing to the lord in chapter 7 verse 8 says that israel was mixed with the other people not separating from the worldly people mingling like a cake only finished on one side he said cake not finished on one side is useless you kind of throw it away in other words it's halfway it's only cooked on one side i'm going to go through these quickly but he says you're like a cake that's only cooked on one side in other words you're halfway with me you're not fully with me in chapter eight verse nine he said hi you have hired lovers this woman referring to israel ephraim you've hired other lovers amen and you paid for that bad movie on your phone i love you you paid for that bad movie on your phone you hired it you paid for that script subscription that only has dirty movies chapter 12 verse 8 speaks about her money and she's caught up in her possessions but god says your money has led you away as well i think of our lives you know what i'm thinking of hosea mentions all these characteristics of ephraim and i thought of my own life and i think of our lives the numerous things that take us away from our intimacy with jesus christ the entertainments the busyness the world we're attracted to other things just distractions from our relationship one preacher referred to it as satan's weapons of mass distraction we live in the age of distractions distractions from what from our relationship with jesus christ on a daily basis we're the culture of distractions and entertainments and our phones and news clip the the what do they call those things when you get a feed real quick what's that you get it on your phone a post or a somebody help me come on paul bower help me somebody alerts notifications for some reason we got to be notified on everything if there's a my phone it's like if there's a storm over in lansing michigan i don't know how to turn it off i don't really want to know if there's a storm in lansing michigan but i get a notification about it hurricanes everywhere weather everywhere i don't know how to somebody please help me turn it off and i get notifications on a lot of stuff and i'm going why do i need to know this this is the culture of mass distractions usually it's when you go read your bible or you turn on a tape with this prophet stopping right here how much do you spend time reading your bible and taking an hour with the lord not just reading about but talking to him and waiting until he talks back to you i'm asking you 21st century americans christians i don't take away your christianity i believe you're sincere people and i believe many of you have the holy ghost i'm asking in this culture how much time are you spending listening to the seventh angel messenger of this day in the last week how much have you listened to the seventh-day adventure how many sermons have you listened to it's not possible for us to listen all all the time but i'm i'm i'm examining your life and unfortunately i'm examining my own but unfortunately while i'm examining my own you get you get to come along with me because i love you how much have you just said say lord i'm giving the next hour to to you this is yours i'm all yours right now whatever you want to say if you don't want to say nothing this is just time with you turning off the phone turning off the notifications usually when i go read the bibles when the notifications come i get more text from people when i go to be with the lord something about that the media feeding on the fourth dimension social media keeping up with everybody in the next thing that they do and i'm here to say to you and i know you say well you don't have facebook and all that so you you know you're critical anyway i watch all of you and i watch my family members sometimes and i'm going you don't need to know every second what's going on in people's lives young people you you don't need to know all that if your walk with this christ is suffering and you feel empty and you feel away from him and you feel i'm not as close to the lord as i need to be that is not as important as your relationship with the lord what your friend did in louisiana or arizona what they're doing next what they their new outfit they got is not as important if it takes you away from this relationship because this is a relationship this is not a dress code this is not a social gathering stood here for 33 years and this is about my relationship with christ and your relationship with christ that's why we preach and that's why we preach the message of the last days i didn't expect to ask that but ask yourself how much this week how much time was spent just with the lord because he loves us he wants to allure us into the wilderness you know what he has to say come away little bride rise up come away little bride i think that word come away and i'm alluring you out to the wilderness i think that means more for today in our materialistic social media our minds are taken our time is taken i think those fit where he's standing saying come away leave the phone leave the phone put it in a safe and lock it up for two hours no come away and so when you when he says come away you get up start walking towards them with your phone oh yeah you do like with my kids i i need to have serious talk with you i need to talk and then bring in their phones leave the phone in the bedroom because it's i'm checking your scriptures dad no no you're not checking the scriptures i'm here no no gay says come away my love come away brother donnie wrote that song and you're bringing your phone he says no no can you leave your phone can you tell everybody just to leave you alone for a while and just give you some time just i need to speak to the lord a while he said come on come away to the windows i think in the culture we live in the lord is saying it more than ever but he's not going to come out and grab you and push you and say come away jaden now get up here i want time with you alone come on now let's fellowship that's all on the last sunday i got you this sunday your turn you're next gideon god doesn't work that way it's just that still small voice saying come away please come away with just fellowship my lord i want you i just got this i got that you don't know what if i don't do this i got this and i i got to i got to check my the latest post whatever you want to do but i'm just calling you away from it all it's not as important as you think trust me people i'm preaching to myself more more than you i want a closer relationship with my lord if can we agree on that this morning you may not some like some of the things i say but can we agree on that do we have the same heart how bad do we want it how close do we want to be with him i want a closer relationship with my lord that i can walk and talk with him and he can and speak with me because when this all is done our possessions will be gone we'll lose him we'll go through seasons we'll go through seasons where where we'll we'll have some a lot of funds but i guarantee you you're going to go through scenes where you won't have it again come on say amen you don't trust in those riches uncertain riches my son-in-law was asking if becca would buy some fireworks tonight and and he gave the amount she says yeah i can get it he said well let's just wait till next year we'll give him my wife said i may not have the money next year i said that's true we go through seasons of life we go through seasons of trouble with our marriage we go through seasons of trouble with our family that's the way a life is can you say amen and so now god calls us to a relationship that whatever season we're going through our fellowship with him can remain intact our joy can remain intact because he's faithful he's not up and down like a roller coaster like we are sometimes he's there he's faithful and he loves us can you say amen he allures her away and says come away my love come away oh praise the lord turn to hosea and i'm going to find a place to end here hosea 14 no no no no go back so in our text in chapter two it's god speaking i'm gonna lure her but then in chapter three is when hosea himself goes to buy back his wife who's went into idolatry or excuse me harlow tree chapter three and verse one can you give me a few more minutes i mean the the fireworks aren't until 10 o'clock tonight so i got a lot of time here and really the fireworks are going on right in here right now praise the lord can't get any better than this and i'm not talking about me but just to sit in the presence of the lord and hear from him you can't get any better than this this beats any fireworks i know some of your kids are falling asleep i understand that and some of you are falling asleep i understand that sometimes but hosea chapter 3 is when when he goes and buys her then said the lord to me go yet love a woman beloved of her friend yet an adulteress according to the love of the lord toward the children of israel who look to other gods and love flagons of wine pints and different things of wine and that's where she got so i bought her for me for 15 pieces of silver so he goes and gets his wife and he buys her back he pays the price who's this speaking of the lord jesus christ when you got away from god was alienated from him he went and paid the price at calvary judas sowed him for 30 pieces of silver hosea buys her for 15 pieces of silver that's double god paid double can you say man for you so i bought her for me for 15 pieces of silver and for a home or a barley and a half omaha barley and i said unto her say listen now she's in a dollar tree she feels condemned she said but he says i'm going and he goes and finds this woman that he married and he says what's the price i'm going to buy her back because my love for her i want to woo her i want to bring her back to myself i want her back in fellowship again so what price do i need to pay to get back in fellowship with her again that's the lord jesus in your life and aren't your glad friends even when you backslide a while his love is still saying i already paid the price for your relationship i paid the ultimate price to bring you back into fellowship again and then he says to her and i said unto her thou shalt abide for me many days thou shalt not play the harlot and thou shalt not be for another man so will i also be for thee you know what he's saying i love you so much i paid the price but he says you don't have to play the harlot anymore i don't want you to play the harlot i want you to abide with me now forever and i thou shall not be for another man and i will i also be just for the exclusive exclusive relationship there it is thou shalt be for thou shalt not be for another man so will i also be for thee that's what hosea said to his wife as he buys her back i love it and then he goes on to say well i was looking for that i love her freely where's that chapter okay yes let's skip to verse chapter 14 now thank you for your patience chapter 14 last chapter because see now let's look at this look at this just before you read it so we've had a whole chapter talking about israel's adultery we have a prophet marrying this woman she falls he restores her back i'm loving you back i want an exclusive relationship with you if you don't hear anything else today my dear friends whoever you are family friends whatever if you don't hear anything else the lord jesus christ who's revealed in the last days through this message came because he was lonely at the beginning and he wanted a relationship with you a marriage relationship and when you get away from it he's faithful but when you get away he wants to draw you back he wants to draw you back don't get hung up on all the stuff that satan gets you hung up on this is about a relationship and when you're in relationship with him he'll give you the answers to all your questions you'll talk to him about it and i don't understand why we have to do this i don't understand why we have to wear this i don't understand it but just get in relationship with him stay close to the word he'll show you he loves you o israel returning unto the lord return unto the lord god for those fallen thy night by thy iniquity take with you words and turn to the lord and say unto him take away all iniquity and receive us graciously so will we re render the cast of our lips a sure shall not save us we will not ride upon horses neither will we say anymore to the work of our hands ye are our gods for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy you're going to find here's what this is he's called her come away and now she is responding israel back to him god says in verse 4 i will heal their backsliding i will love them freely for my anger is turned away from him i will be as the dew unto israel he shall grow as a lily and cast forth his roots as lebanon his branches shall spread and his beauty shall be as the olive tree and his smell as lebanon they that dwell under his shadow shall return they shall revive as the corn and grow as the vine the scent thereof shall be the wine of lebanon ephraim shall say what oh i love this friends here's the response what have i to do anymore with idols stop right there finally god who's her back and it comes from her mouth what do i have to do with any more with idols that's what the lord wants to hear you say oh if we could leave this as i left this sanctuary last night and gave my own rededication to god at this altar last night all that we could leave this building and say these words to our lord that he wants to hear i'm through with other idols i'm through today i see lord you love me so much and i see the relationship you're coming i am through what have i to do anymore with idols and god which spurned response that i have heard him and observed him i am like a fur tree from thee is thy fruit found the bride tree speaking of a tree the bride tree but he wants to hear you say you know what ephraim israel you know what he's saying if he was today he'd be saying lord i'm through with these other affairs i'm through with dabbling in things that i think nobody's seeing and you're seeing it because you're my husband i'm finished right now and if he was today he'd say he'd probably say i'm coming back to the heart of worship and it's all about you it's all about you jesus i'm sorry lord for the things i've made it cause it's all about you it's all about you jesus i'm coming back to the heart of worship and it's all about it's all about you jesus i'm sorry lord for the things i've made when it's all about you it's all about youtube sometimes we have to say sorry for the things that we have made out of the message sometimes we have to say sorry for the things that we have made out of the bible and the word and we've made other things out of it sometimes we have to say sorry lord i forgot this is not about a movement this is not about social gathering this is not about just the dress code it's about you the worship is about you and i'm sorry lord for the things that i've made it into other things i'm sorry for that and i'm coming back to the heart of worship and he spoke to a storm listen friends jesus said if you say to this mountain and when that power came back to sons in the last days he says why don't you speak to the storm that's coming and he spoke and says let this all go away in the name of jesus christ and it all went away and within minutes the sun was shining should have been a storm that lasted for days all went away and as he's walking back down he hears the lord speak to him and say why don't you just walk with me a while i asked you friends what was more important speak into the storm what was more important to god i'm going gonna challenge you right now what was more important to god the third poll that he spoke to the storm oh praise god he spoke to the storm what a wonderful thing that's what we all look for but what was more important to god it wasn't speaking to the storm he can do that we heard master of the wind we serve the master of the wind we know the master god comes around doesn't leave it with just speaking to the storm and it goes away he says will you just walk with me in this woods for a while he said i would love to walk with you just talk with me a while will you walk with me i'm coming back to the heart and it's all about would you stand with me it's all about jesus i'm sorry lord for the things i needed all about well it's all about you jesus quote here is before we pray together this last quote and god makes it making a promise the other day down at brother cox's brother rem says an old mother dove had two little babies and they set right up on the top of the building so the cats couldn't get them and the old mother dove would feed them then she'd come down and get them and make them get up in the tree and they would sit there with their necks around one another and coo and make love all day long two little baby gentle baby doves and i thought of how god the dove is such a loving bird and the dove of god wanting to make love with his human beings god wants to be loved god wants to love you god so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but to have everlasting life blessed be the lord then god wanting to make love he had to make something lovable he had to make something gentle like himself he had to make something that could be loved he had to make something of his own nature you couldn't love nothing that wasn't of your own nature loving has to unite with love and a husband and wife have to love one another if they ever make the great a family has to love one another if they're going to ever make the great something to be loved you search everywhere finding a girl to be your wife that you love she searches finding a husband that she can love god searches trying to find a soul that he can love it goes on to say later in another service god is a lover the church in his conditions god is a lover god is love god so loved the world when they were unlovable that he gave his son to make them lovable and god here it is god wants to come down and make love to you he's seeking thirsting hungering trying to get some of your starchy hearts to make love to you as a love affair not a law but a love it's all in love god so love can you say amen praise the lord king of that brother we'll bring it up let's sing this one more time and then we're going to pray together speak to the lord i'm coming back to the heart of worship and it's all about you it's all about you jesus i'm sorry lord
