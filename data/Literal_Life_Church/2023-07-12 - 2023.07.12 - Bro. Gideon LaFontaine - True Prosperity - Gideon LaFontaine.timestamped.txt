[1:22] before we turn to the word
[1:25] first of all I I wanted to say can you
[1:28] see this
[1:30] is he I shaved tonight
[1:33] and usually says he asks when I shave is
[1:36] Olivia in town
[1:38] [Laughter]
[1:40] so I just wanted to let you know that
[1:42] Olivia's not in town
[1:44] and I shaved so here we go
[1:48] so just pointing that out but um so yeah
[1:52] it's just just a life update it's
[1:55] it's an exciting time so we're uh really
[1:58] excited for you know life and moving on
[2:01] so just having the Lord lead us in this
[2:04] direction we are we're excited so
[2:07] um so let's all stand again
[2:12] so we're gonna go to scripture tonight
[2:15] Genesis 39
[2:17] talking about Joseph
[2:21] um
[2:22] title tonight is true prosperity
[2:25] true prosperity
[2:27] amen
[2:29] so we have the back story of Joseph
[2:32] it's the prophet was prophet says he's a
[2:35] perfect closest to the type of Christ we
[2:37] can see in the scripture
[2:39] amen reject his by his brothers the Jews
[2:42] you know you see his life it just ties
[2:44] so perfectly what I've seen in the
[2:47] scripture I encourage you to go read the
[2:49] story of Joseph because what it lines up
[2:51] with the type with Christ and even us in
[2:55] relation to that you can see yourself so
[2:57] much in these stories and even even the
[3:00] story of you know the Temptation with
[3:01] him and Potiphar's wife you know you can
[3:03] see yourself you know as a young person
[3:05] you know you can see yourself going
[3:07] through those things and you can say you
[3:09] know the Lord brought me through those
[3:11] things amen he brought me through those
[3:13] those Temptations every single time amen
[3:16] and I can testify of that today amen but
[3:18] it was the Lord's doing the Lord put
[3:20] something inside of me say I'm not gonna
[3:22] I'm not gonna forsake the Lord my God
[3:24] Amen praise the Lord amen I love him too
[3:27] much amen praise the Lord so let's just
[3:30] read first 39 5.
[3:33] and it came to pass
[3:35] so this is this is after he is rejected
[3:38] by his brothers this is
[3:40] um when he's coming to Egypt
[3:42] and um he finds himself in a place where
[3:46] he's um he's in a good position as far
[3:49] as
[3:50] uh Pharaoh's house right
[3:52] so and it came to pass from the time
[3:55] that he had made him over to Overseer in
[3:58] his house and over all that he had all
[4:02] that the Lord blessed the Egyptians
[4:04] house for Joseph's sake and the blessing
[4:07] of the Lord was upon all that he had in
[4:10] the house in the field okay now we're
[4:12] going
[4:13] so this happened the Temptation with
[4:15] Potiphar's wife right we go down a
[4:18] little bit and we see in verse 20
[4:20] through 23 and Joseph's Master took him
[4:24] and put him into the prison we're all
[4:27] familiar with the story and place where
[4:29] the king's prisoners were bound
[4:32] and he was there in the prison but the
[4:35] Lord was with Joseph and showed him
[4:37] Mercy amen and gave him favor in the
[4:41] sight
[4:42] of The Keeper of the prison and The
[4:45] Keeper of the prison committed to Joseph
[4:47] all that the prisoners that were in the
[4:50] prison and whatsoever they did there
[4:53] he was the doer of it The Keeper of the
[4:56] prison look not to any of the anything
[4:59] that was under his hand because the Lord
[5:02] was with him and that which he did the
[5:05] Lord made it to prosper right so we see
[5:08] that type and pers we see the comparison
[5:11] of Christ everywhere Christ is it
[5:14] prospers do you believe that tonight
[5:15] everywhere our Jesus Christ is it
[5:18] prospers amen so we see that comparison
[5:20] and we even see the comparison of
[5:23] Brother Kyle mentions it all the time
[5:24] but you see the two Beggars on or you
[5:26] see the two thieves on the cross we see
[5:28] that type right here in scripture of the
[5:31] Baker and
[5:33] um the Baker and the other one
[5:35] the butler there we go the butler the
[5:38] Baker and the Butler and you see Joseph
[5:40] I love what Joseph said you see the
[5:42] confidence Joseph has in his Lord you go
[5:45] down and uh they're they're wondering
[5:48] what the interpretation for the dream is
[5:50] and then you go down the 40 verse 8 and
[5:53] it says
[5:54] a little down and they're questioning it
[5:56] the Baker and the Butler and it says do
[5:58] not interpretations belong to God
[6:01] he's testifying of his God the
[6:03] interpretation belongs to God Amen
[6:05] tell me them I pray you amen he's got
[6:08] that confidence he's he was he's born
[6:10] peculiar peculiar I can't say that word
[6:13] that's a hard word peculiar so he was
[6:16] born that way right he was born and he
[6:19] was a seer right Joseph was a seer
[6:22] why don't you guys sit down no that'll
[6:24] be that'll be good
[6:26] I get I get going and I forget you know
[6:28] you guys are
[6:29] you guys are standing so
[6:31] so anyways Joseph
[6:34] knowing his identity as the coveted son
[6:38] right
[6:39] he's known as his identity as the
[6:41] Covenant son Joseph was a Seer he was
[6:44] peculiar from his young age right that's
[6:46] why his brothers hated him
[6:49] you can't tell on what you can tell the
[6:51] unwavering stance Joseph has all through
[6:53] his life you can just as you look in the
[6:56] scripture you can see just the
[6:57] unwavering Faith the unwavering
[6:59] steadfadness fastness he's had in his
[7:02] life God prospered everything Joseph put
[7:05] in his hand to do that's how I want to
[7:07] be is that how you want to be everything
[7:10] that God puts in your hand Lord take it
[7:12] God and let it Prosper amen there's
[7:15] nothing we can do but when we place it
[7:17] in God's hands that's when it will
[7:19] prosper amen praise the Lord the perfect
[7:22] type of Christ in his church
[7:25] even in prison Joseph prospered amen
[7:28] what a Time could you could you imagine
[7:31] being have you ever seen those some
[7:33] sometimes you can look up those things
[7:34] where you see how bad prison is you
[7:36] could could you could you imagine
[7:38] prospering in prison today
[7:40] Brother Kyle I mean could you imagine
[7:42] prospering in prison amen the word
[7:45] Prospect the word Prosper today I
[7:49] believe
[7:50] has a damper on it do you believe that
[7:55] the word Prosper today has a real damper
[7:57] on it
[7:59] Satan has took that word Prosper and
[8:02] changed it
[8:04] has changed that word Prosper by movies
[8:08] what we watch by things we see
[8:11] there's so many things that your eyes
[8:13] may see and it could see like Prosper
[8:15] what is Prosper amen
[8:17] and what is success what is that
[8:20] so you see the type
[8:22] Satan Satan took he takes everything and
[8:26] he perverts it that's all he can do amen
[8:28] he can only pervert
[8:29] so you have the modern church and this
[8:32] Prosperity Gospel as anybody anybody
[8:34] heard of Prosperity Gospel it's such a
[8:38] deception to this age such a deception I
[8:40] mean I've seen I was I was watching it's
[8:43] called American gospel and it's it's
[8:44] about that it's a whole it's a whole
[8:46] documentary on the lies that the enemies
[8:48] tell to these people in this church and
[8:52] we can see it
[8:53] as a totally false Doctrine right as
[8:57] prosperity and and what we can see it
[8:59] three things that make a man fall as
[9:01] woman popularity and money right what do
[9:04] you think of when you think of
[9:06] prosperity to the human mind what do we
[9:08] usually think
[9:09] money right we usually think money
[9:12] we usually think cars vacations housing
[9:15] money wealth
[9:17] we even think of the recent you know Tom
[9:20] Brady retiring have you anyone heard of
[9:22] that Tom Brady Maybe not maybe I'm the
[9:24] only one
[9:25] Tom Brady retiring but he's been in and
[9:28] out because he doesn't know where he's
[9:30] supposed to be his whole family left him
[9:32] he has all you know all the money in the
[9:35] world but he doesn't have anything amen
[9:37] it's the it's really sad to see and
[9:39] that's where that's what children look
[9:41] up to all the time they look up to these
[9:43] these Idols amen they look up to these
[9:46] things that are deceiving them of what
[9:48] is true Prosperity what is it amen you
[9:52] can see it's like you look at you can
[9:54] you look at bodybuilders you look at you
[9:57] know certain Idols in this world from
[9:59] Hollywood and you can be so deceived by
[10:01] what true Prosperity is hey man can I
[10:04] get an amen tonight amen what is true
[10:07] prosperity
[10:08] now bear with me here
[10:10] in the junction of time brother Branham
[10:12] says in 56 God doesn't promise a flower
[10:16] bed of ease
[10:18] don't false falsely a Christian or don't
[10:21] don't don't change a Christian's mind if
[10:25] you're witnessing to someone he's trying
[10:26] to say don't make it seem that it's
[10:28] going to be a flowery bed of ease and
[10:30] don't false falsely the message but tell
[10:33] them that everything and tell them that
[10:36] everything's going to be all right
[10:37] there's nothing going to harm you
[10:39] there's nothing going to ain't no trials
[10:42] or nothing that's wrong do you believe
[10:43] that that's wrong as the pro said must I
[10:47] carried on the heaven onto Heaven on a
[10:49] flowery bed of ease While others fought
[10:51] to win the prize and sailed through
[10:54] bloody Seas no sir
[10:56] God doesn't promise ease and prosperity
[11:00] but he promises Grace
[11:02] to endure in every time aren't you glad
[11:05] tonight it gives us that Grace to keep
[11:08] sustaining keep moving forward Amen
[11:10] halleluia to endure every time it's the
[11:14] grace that we look to
[11:16] amen the immaturity of Christians
[11:18] sometimes amen we say this verse it's
[11:21] Jeremiah 20 29 11. we say it so so
[11:24] beautifully amen we say it for I know
[11:27] the thoughts I have for you
[11:29] I know the plans I have for you and this
[11:31] is the NIV here declares the Lord plans
[11:34] to prosper you not to harm you plans to
[11:37] give you hope and a future and we can
[11:39] all say Amen to that right
[11:40] I don't know if anyone any of you have
[11:43] continued reading that scripture amen
[11:45] have you continued reading that
[11:47] scripture it's it's not that good amen I
[11:51] feel like people just stop right at that
[11:53] scripture and they're saying all right
[11:54] Lord
[11:55] it's all up to you right it's all up to
[11:58] you I don't I don't want to give
[12:00] anything up Lord when I when I'm doing
[12:02] that in that process of Lord I know you
[12:05] have plans for me I know you have things
[12:07] to prosper me right but but I don't
[12:10] really want to give up anything amen I
[12:12] don't want to give I I can only give you
[12:15] so much amen but Lord still Prosper me
[12:17] right it's kind of got a misconception
[12:20] and what what we've learned you know
[12:22] through so many Instagram rails so many
[12:24] things that we see is this Prosperity
[12:26] Gospel we see this with this this
[12:29] constant move of of what they're saying
[12:32] is you know God's grace is sufficient no
[12:35] matter what amen God's grace will it you
[12:38] know it and it can sound so good amen it
[12:41] can sound so good but at the end of the
[12:43] day there's no repentance there's no
[12:46] coming down to yourself and saying Lord
[12:48] I am broken Lord I need you God I need
[12:51] you more than anything and that's the
[12:53] question tonight do you really need God
[12:55] amen I really need God I'm broken
[12:58] without him amen I need him every single
[13:01] day of my life praise God
[13:03] amen so have you read the rest of
[13:05] scripture Talks Of Babylon and God's
[13:07] judgment on them we have heard so this
[13:09] is what in Jeremiah we've heard the
[13:11] calling but it talks of Babylon but
[13:14] praise the Lord we've heard a voice
[13:16] calling us out of Babylon amen Babylon
[13:19] means confusion religious confusion so
[13:21] don't be deceived by some of the things
[13:23] you may come across amen prosperity and
[13:26] what what God I believe we have every
[13:29] promise in the book Is Ours amen
[13:31] everything you see in the scripture is
[13:33] ours Divine Healing everything is there
[13:36] amen we take God in his word no matter
[13:38] what
[13:39] but it's when we take God as word but we
[13:41] don't want to give everything else up
[13:44] amen see God's a gentleman he will he'll
[13:47] heal you and he'll give you the things
[13:49] you need when you need them but what
[13:51] he's looking for is is a soul amen he's
[13:53] looking for a heart surrendered to him
[13:55] completely amen praise the Lord you can
[13:59] have your healing you can have your
[14:01] fleshly healing in this body but what
[14:04] about the soul inside of you amen
[14:06] praise the Lord I'm looking for I'm
[14:09] looking for a restored Soul amen praise
[14:11] the Lord the problem is people don't
[14:13] want to get in God's program amen
[14:16] they've got their program and they want
[14:18] God to kind of slip in there and say
[14:20] they want they want God to say Lord you
[14:22] have plans to prosper me right
[14:24] so the problem is they don't they're too
[14:27] scared of what they'll have to give up
[14:29] they say Lord
[14:31] they say but they don't have repentance
[14:32] right so I'm getting there that's that's
[14:34] the spirit of this generation that's
[14:36] what I'm getting to they're neither hot
[14:38] nor cold right God's God spits that out
[14:41] right God spits that out
[14:44] and uh that's what it says in Revelation
[14:46] it's just it's it's it's a nasty thing
[14:49] when you're hot or cold he doesn't want
[14:50] that right
[14:52] he wants he wants Believers on fire for
[14:55] God Amen praise the Lord amen I was in
[14:58] Honduras when I was a kid it was just a
[15:01] story I thought of but I remember
[15:02] Honduras we were um we were traveling to
[15:05] a few churches with Dad and what they
[15:08] did was they got bottled water for us so
[15:10] we wouldn't get sick right and um they
[15:13] left the bottle of waters in the car
[15:16] in you know 90 degree weather right so
[15:19] we get back into the car and there's
[15:21] this lukewarm water there's this and all
[15:25] you wanted to do when you're drunk I
[15:27] mean you
[15:28] you drank it because it was it was water
[15:31] but man everything in you wanted to just
[15:33] get that out and have some nice cool
[15:35] drink of water hey man how many like you
[15:37] know what I need one right I need some
[15:40] water right now
[15:42] but anyways you you know what I mean by
[15:45] that amen it's just you know you've
[15:47] tasted that right
[15:49] so
[15:51] here's voice 58.
[15:54] this is a a little bit longer one so
[15:57] just bear with me here
[16:00] look at Isaiah the prophet
[16:03] as a young man he had made
[16:07] the great favored King Uzziah and them
[16:10] days a righteous man a good man he loved
[16:14] Isaiah for he knew he was a prophet and
[16:18] so he just leaned upon the King's Arms
[16:20] everything he wanted why Uzziah give it
[16:23] to him and every time he wanted anything
[16:26] why the king would give it to him but
[16:29] there come a time that the King died
[16:32] see listen to this Prosperity always
[16:35] ruins people
[16:37] that's a hard thing to say
[16:39] but Prosperity takes a man away from God
[16:43] spoke one place in the Bible something
[16:45] on this line and he said when I bless
[16:48] you and gave you much when you were poor
[16:51] and you didn't have nothing I come to
[16:54] you and you heard me and you served me
[16:56] but when I blessed you and gave you
[16:58] plenty then you turned your head from me
[17:01] that's the way America has done turned
[17:04] their heads and I want you to read the
[17:06] scripture I don't know if many of you
[17:08] have seen the scripture I just came
[17:10] across it today when he mentioned it
[17:12] Deuteronomy 8 10-20 if you would read it
[17:16] with me tonight if you would pull it up
[17:18] here
[17:22] when thou has eaten and art full
[17:25] then Thou shalt bless the Lord thy God
[17:27] for the good land which he hath given
[17:30] thee beware that so listen to this
[17:33] beware that thou forget not the Lord thy
[17:38] God and not keepeth his Commandments and
[17:41] his judgments and his statutes which I
[17:44] commanded thee in this day
[17:48] lest when thou has eaten an art full and
[17:51] has built goodly houses and dwelt
[17:54] therein
[17:55] and when the herds and thy flocks
[17:56] multiply and thy silver and gold is
[18:00] Multiplied and all that thou Hast is
[18:03] Multiplied then thy heart be lifted up
[18:06] and thou forget the Lord thy God
[18:08] which thou brought thee forth out of the
[18:11] land of Egypt from the house of bondage
[18:13] who Led Led thee through great
[18:17] terrible Wilderness wherein we're fiery
[18:20] serpents and scorpions and drought
[18:22] where there was no water but brought
[18:25] thee forth water out of the rock of
[18:27] Flint who fled the in the wilderness
[18:30] with Manna so you see you see what he's
[18:32] he's warning the people about right you
[18:34] see what he's you see what he's warning
[18:36] the people and and saying you have all
[18:39] this don't forget the Lord your God Amen
[18:41] beware that you forget not the Lord thy
[18:43] God
[18:44] amen
[18:46] which thy fathers knew not and he might
[18:48] humble thee and that he might prove thee
[18:52] to do the good at the latter end
[18:55] and they say in their heart my power and
[18:57] my might
[18:59] in my in my of my hand had gotten me
[19:02] this well see how selfish it is but Thou
[19:05] shalt remember the Lord thy God for it
[19:08] is he that giveth thee power to get
[19:10] wealth amen that he may establish his
[19:14] Covenant which he swear unto his thy
[19:17] Fathers as it is this day and it shall
[19:20] be if thou do it all forget the Lord thy
[19:24] God and walk after their other other
[19:26] gods and serve them and worship them I
[19:29] testify against you this day that ye
[19:31] shall surely perish as the Nations which
[19:34] the Lord destroyth before your face
[19:35] shall shall your perish
[19:37] because you would not be obedient unto
[19:41] the voice of the Lord your God Amen
[19:43] praise the Lord but forget that's what
[19:46] I'm trying to get beware that thou
[19:47] forget don't get puffed up when these
[19:49] things come because that's that's this
[19:51] generation right
[19:52] in need of nothing right let's not let's
[19:55] not fall into that as Believers amen
[19:58] let's continue on Amen
[20:00] continue on knowing that he gave you
[20:03] everything you have amen
[20:05] praise the Lord
[20:07] so what we ask the question what is true
[20:09] prosperity and I love this amen what is
[20:12] true prosperity
[20:13] based on the word of God because that's
[20:15] where we look amen oh we want to know

[23:41] remember this Christ in the true church

[23:50] that Antichrist Spirit would come into
[23:52] the church and defile it make it
[23:55] lukewarm formal and Powerless
[23:57] it exposes Satan revealing his Works
[24:01] attempted destruction of God's people
[24:03] and the discrediting of God's word right
[24:07] down to the time he's cast into the Lake
[24:09] of Fire

[24:58] to gain power over
[25:00] over him in the desert as
[25:04] as different
[25:05] yes Satan hates Revelation but we love
[25:07] it amen but true Revelation in our lives
[25:10] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[25:13] us
[25:14] but we will prevail over them praise the
[25:17] Lord Jesus said don't Rejoice Luke 10

[25:30] so I wanted to get to what is what is
[25:32] the true Prosperity amen
[25:35] and the 70 return again and with Joy
[25:38] saying Lord even the devils are subject
[25:40] unto us through thy name and he said see
[25:43] they're getting excited and he said unto
[25:45] them I beheld Satan as lightning fall

[25:51] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[25:53] over all the power of the enemy and
[25:56] nothing shall by any means hurt you
[25:59] notwithstanding listen to this what
[26:01] Jesus says and this Rejoice not
[26:05] this is not what we're supposed to
[26:06] Rejoice about right that the spirits are
[26:09] subject unto you
[26:10] it's not the focus it's not the focus
[26:13] but rather Rejoice because your names
[26:15] are written in heaven what is it about
[26:17] the identity you have with him amen
[26:19] praise the Lord amen that's where we
[26:22] draw our strength that's where we draw
[26:24] our prosperity praise the Lord

[26:34] rejoice and say Allelujah tonight amen
[26:38] he paid the price for me amen hallelujah
[26:43] praise God
[26:46] and then we got here we go the inner
[26:49] Veil
[26:53] you know I'm a
[26:55] at least you know right now I'm a
[26:57] short-winded preacher so forgive me for
[26:59] that but it's a Wednesday night so you
[27:02] guys understand
[27:04] so
[27:06] just listen to this here the Intervale
[27:08] 56.
[27:10] and now I find that people so struggle
[27:12] seem like I meet people and they say
[27:14] it's just such a struggle
[27:17] have you seen people that way and
[27:19] probably probably there's many sitting
[27:22] right here before me now
[27:25] that just heads their ups and downs and
[27:27] ins and outs this day
[27:29] they're all right
[27:31] you meet them and well they love the
[27:34] Lord today and tomorrow they're having
[27:35] such a struggle to hold on the devil so
[27:38] tempting them and they're having such
[27:40] ups and downs then you meet somebody
[27:42] that's on the hilltop all the time
[27:43] whether there's nothing bothers them at
[27:46] all amen
[27:47] now there's bound to be something
[27:49] lacking somewhere God's no respecter of
[27:52] persons or God doesn't respect persons
[27:54] he wants all his children to have the
[27:57] same amen
[27:59] he wouldn't righteous father wouldn't
[28:01] give one dish of ice cream I love how he
[28:03] says this
[28:04] it wouldn't have he wouldn't give one
[28:06] dish of ice cream without giving all ice
[28:08] cream amen
[28:10] I mean how would you feel if you know
[28:11] all your siblings got ice cream and you
[28:13] know you didn't get ice cream I would
[28:16] feel pretty bad
[28:17] amen
[28:19] amen so
[28:21] continuing on
[28:24] um
[28:25] certainly he wants you to live and I'm
[28:27] not take talking about gifts I'm talking
[28:29] about Grace amen now of course some are
[28:33] called apostles
[28:34] and Prophets and teachers and
[28:36] evangelists and churches Church offices
[28:38] and so forth that's God's place in the
[28:41] churches in these things so don't let
[28:43] that be the focus amen and but I'm
[28:46] talking about measure measures of Grace
[28:49] overcoming Grace to each one that he
[28:52] elects you to your office but then
[28:56] but in Grace God has given us all freely
[29:00] as we have need aren't you glad tonight

[30:28] to drink
[30:29] and drink until it gets so much it just
[30:33] goes to pushing out
[30:35] praise the Lord drinks more than its
[30:37] lotted portion and it dwells out and it
[30:40] pushes out limbs it pushes out buds then
[30:44] it pushes out leaves then the blossom
[30:46] then the apples
[30:48] how about them apples
[30:53] then it pushes again and it pushes again
[30:55] it keeps drinking and drinking until it
[30:57] just pushes out and that's what the
[31:00] Christian does amen

[33:08] this is a I mean even even at the house
[33:11] right now I was telling Brandon in the
[33:12] back I'm on flower Duty I don't know if
[33:14] you know what flower duty is but I have
[33:16] to water the flowers
[33:17] while mom and dad are away right
[33:21] so it's pretty you know at first I was
[33:24] kind of
[33:25] reluctant about it
[33:27] you know who wants to get up in the
[33:29] morning and go to all the flowers and
[33:31] you know go to it but
[33:33] um but you know like today and yesterday
[33:36] I've been seeing the change
[33:39] I've been seeing the change and like
[33:41] what's happening to the flowers and it's
[33:44] pretty exciting I go there I go out
[33:46] there like today I went out there
[33:48] probably three or four times to look at
[33:49] the flowers to see if they're coming up
[33:52] more you know
[33:54] I mean could you imagine how you know
[33:56] God looks at you could you imagine you
[33:59] know he's watering you and you just keep
[34:01] drinking and drinking amen he's just so
[34:04] excited amen about what what he's given
[34:06] you amen amen he wants to give you
[34:09] Revelation more than anything he wants
[34:10] to strengthen you more than anything
[34:12] draw from the inexhaustible Fountain
[34:14] amen praise the Lord amen so that's been
[34:17] pretty exciting for me amen so I I
[34:19] didn't know I was you know I like
[34:21] flowers but I didn't want it to like
[34:23] water them every day even the other
[34:24] morning I was I need to get off this
[34:26] flower thing but even the other morning
[34:29] before work the sprinklers they come on
[34:32] right so then I've got the hose trying
[34:34] to water these flowers
[34:37] I'm watering these flowers and there's
[34:40] nothing coming out of the hose because
[34:42] the sprinklers are taking it all out
[34:43] right
[34:45] but the thing is that doesn't happen
[34:46] with God right it doesn't happen with
[34:48] God he just keeps giving amen praise God
[34:51] hallelujah
[34:54] amen and if you're planted in him the
[34:57] only thing you have to do is drink of
[34:58] his goodness and push out whatever you
[35:01] have need of in this Earth's Journey
[35:02] it's all drinking resting peace
[35:05] Hallelujah and it's not what you
[35:07] struggle and strive and pull at you
[35:10] defeat the very purpose that you're
[35:12] representing when you do that so don't
[35:14] do that amen just drink from the
[35:16] inexhaustible Fountain amen keep
[35:18] drinking keep drinking amen praise the
[35:21] Lord you just keep growing and growing
[35:23] amen you might you might have other
[35:25] flowers you know around you that you may
[35:27] say you know I want to be that flower no
[35:29] God made you that flower for a purpose
[35:31] amen he made you that flower amen and he
[35:34] wants you to bloom he's got a plan for
[35:36] you he's got he's he wants to prop
[35:38] Prosper you amen praise the Lord amen so
[35:43] as Believers we look and see
[35:45] that true Prosperity is nothing that
[35:47] this world can offer but a hidden life
[35:50] with Christ amen how many can testify of
[35:52] that amen so close so closed off to the
[35:56] things of this world that no matter what
[35:58] comes I can say blessed be the name of
[36:02] the Lord as job said Lord you give and
[36:04] take away but Blessed Be Your Name

[36:34] um you you see you see what she
[36:37] understood about you know she might have
[36:39] not thought about what Prosperity is but
[36:42] Prosperity is in the Eternal amen
[36:45] Prosperity is looking what what is
[36:47] eternal my vision is for
[36:50] Eternal lost souls right so she looks
[36:52] and says the salvation of my two sons
[36:54] amen she's looking for you know she
[36:57] understands what what Prosperity really
[37:00] is amen it's not the million dollars
