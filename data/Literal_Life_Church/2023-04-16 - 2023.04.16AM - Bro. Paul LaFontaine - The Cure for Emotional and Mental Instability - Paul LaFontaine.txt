========================================

God and read it together in Luke chapter 21 and we're going to have several specials tonight from different churches and I think they weren't able to get to one this morning so we'll get those this evening and we have several BCF and different churches that prepared specials for the Tri-State youth meeting that starts at five o'clock knock six five o'clock this afternoon and we're looking forward to some testimonies and also some specials and then my son Gideon will be speaking to the young people tonight you're welcome to come all of you whatever age you are Luke chapter 21 and verse 25. Luke 21 and verse 25 and there shall be signs in the Sun and in the moon and in the Stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth one place and one of the gospels says looking at the fearful sights it's termed fearful sights and looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken so we have words like distress we have perplexity we have fear in men's Hearts their hearts failing them for fear we have fearful sights that are watching how can they see fearful sights constantly in front of them through television and through their phones there's fearful sights that brings more fear and perplexity and stress verse 27 and then shall they see the son of man coming in in a cloud with power and great glory and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh and he spake to them a parable behold the Fig Tree and all the trees when they now shoot forth you see and know of yourselves that summer is now nigh at hand so the Fig Tree is typed as Israel and all the other trees in other words everything begins to come into this Bloom and the summertime and begins to come into its full manifestation all things bad or good come to full manifestation at the end time and when we see them come to full manifestation when we see the Fig Tree Israel become a nation and come in their own nation and now looking for their Revival when we see all of the Nations and all the spirits come to a head and manifest all the trees coming into that manifestation then we know we're close to the end Jesus said this so likewise ye when ye see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand verily I send you this generation shall not pass till all be fulfilled look at this now Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away this is the generation that will observe and watch Heaven and Earth passing away but when we watch that pass away then we always know that there's one thing that will endure and not become corrupt how many know that every system is becoming corrupt but there's one thing that can't corrupt and that's the word of God the only thing we have left that won't corrupt is the word of God but we'll be the generation that watches his Heaven Earth and things begin to pass away and things begin to fall apart I want you to notice as I preach out of verse 34 this morning and take heed there's this warning to watch yourself Be watchful take heed to yourselves it's a personal thing in this hour take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts become overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares and worries of this life and so that day come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth I want to speak this morning on the cure for emotional and mental instability God never left us without a cure but you can see Jesus said in verse 34 that we could be affected and our emotional life would be depleted because of the fear in this generation all will be affected by it and we can become emotionally and mentally depleted but God but God provides for his people in that hour he gives the Cure Lord bless your word may you anoint me like you've never anointed me before the hour is late the time is late God it's time for us to lay down every frivolous thing every gossip every everything Lord that causes us to mistrust your word it is the only thing that we can preach that will bring hope to the people God help us strengthen us and may we lay down every shadow and everything that hinders us from the word of God today as we commit to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen everybody said amen amen God bless you may be seated so I'm looking here this morning at Jesus depiction of our day and uh prophesying and giving us exactly the characteristics of our time and we can see a last warning here that our hearts did not become weighed down when he says overcharge that means our hearts become weighed down our hearts become drained our Spirits become emotionally drained and we should be on guard for that as Christians he's not just talking to everybody but particularly Christians he's speaking directly to us because he says there if you if you catch it take heed to yourselves it's a personal thing that that your hearts that your hearts he's speaking to the elect that your hearts your spirit your emotions don't become depleted and drained be on guard for that in the in one of the Amplified versions it says take heed to yourselves and be on guard because some of these words you know I always have to look up when it says surfing your heart's overcharged with surfing I'm I'm thinking of surfing drunkenness I understand but you know okay so don't get into surfing and being drunk it's deeper than that you know I don't think your heart could become overcharged and burdened with when you're out surfing so that's why you have to get up your Bible and look up these words sometimes so the Amplified says but take heed to yourselves and be on guard lest your hearts be overburdened and depressed weighed down with get with the giddiness and headache and nausea of self-indulgence drunkenness and worldly worries and cares pertaining to the business of this life we live there friends this is dead on of what we go through to deplete us emotionally so I'm going to read it again that we become depressed and weighed down with the giddiness and the headache and the nausea of self-indulgence drunkenness because that's what the world world teaches us to be in other words they have things to answer to this scare they have things to answer to this fear when we're emotionally feeling shaky and unstable then they have answers but they're temporary answers they're temporary fixes for it and so so now the headache the giddiness the nausea of self-indulgence that's what the the world wants you to do drunkenness and worldly worries and cares pertaining to the business of the of this life lest that day come upon you suddenly like a trap or a noose in the last verse 35 says for as a snare shall it come so now a snare is a trap for an animal it gets you snare to get your heart snared it gets you under a bind can you say amen and the world's going to do that but Believers got to say wait a minute now I'm not supposed to be bound by anything this is just about time for Redemption I'm supposed to look up and live my head up can you say mine I'm not like the statistics to get burdened down by this I have a source that I can go to I have a fountain that I can drink from my main focus this morning is to tell us that we when we get emotionally depleted and in stable emotionally and mentally that we are not to buy into the idea that there's somehow no fountain in God that can get fill us up we are not to give up that he doesn't have some Fountain open for us to drink from to fill our emotional need we cannot buy into that lie God has given his word to this generation and that word is sufficient to take care of our need during this time as a matter of fact his word you don't think it well it's for my soul the words for my soul no God provides for emotional depletion God provides to fill you God provides for a sound mind God provides any instability that you're feeling can you say amen God provides for it what I find is most of our generation and many in the message are turning to other things for their emotional stability oh brother Paul are you gonna go there I'm gonna go there I'm finding that a lot of us are turning to other things to fill or avoid or void emotionally we are an addictive Society David Cartwright wrote in a book a couple of 2019 you wrote a book called We're the age of addiction the age of addiction you can look it up and uh David Courtright writes that we are the complete age addiction and the summary for the book he said at the beginning he says we live in an age of addiction from compulsive gaming and shopping to binge eating so now when we think of addiction we think of marijuana we think of someone in an insane it's all someone uh dope addict you find in the message referred to dope addiction with the prophet because that was prevalent all the way back to the 50s and so that's the addiction we think of but this fella he's mentioned we're addictive Society we have a lot of things that are addictions can you say amen and he says his addiction from compulsive gaming and shopping to binge eating and opio opioid I never can say that word opioid abuse sugar can be as habit-forming as cocaine researchers tell us and social media apps are hooking our kids but what can we do to resist temptations that insidiously and deliberately rewire our brains what's he saying all these things over time rewire our brains they mess with our sound thinking what can we do that that we can resist the temptation that insidiously and deliberately rewire our brains he said nothing nothing David Cartwright says unless we understand the history and character of the global Enterprises and the the corporations unless we understand the history and character of them that create and cater to our bad habits so you can read the book because then he explores of course he doesn't have the answer he says they're not really the answer but he said maybe we could look at all the corporates that are contributing the corporations the Enterprises contributing knowing that we have this weakness knowing that America is this way knowing that we lean towards addiction because of our emotional depletion knowing that they gauge everything in entertainment and in selling whatever it is they gauge it so that they can become they can become the Creator and cater to our bad habits in other words some in some ways we can help you but when they go to help you it's not really helping you it's leading you more and more to addiction because guess why they want you to be addicted to their product because they make money it's all about the Mighty Dollar come on now they're going to make money off of you they're going to make money off of medicines they're going to make money and trust me today I am not criticizing I'm not criticizing something that helps a person but I'm here as a gospel Minister that has to point you to what Jesus said and that we Believers guard ourselves be from becoming to addict too addictive to something that is is to be the all answer for our emotional depletion man eating from the Tree of knowledge is trying to help us in his way as he ignores the Tree of Life man eating from that tree is ignoring the tree of life that we can eat from so now addictions how many no addictions start somewhere and man provides remedies of all kinds I'm using the term from the message as uh the messenger says that they have remedies all kinds of Remedies but not a cure so now man provides all kinds of remedies of all kinds where does all this start though the craving number one the craving in the soul for peace let's start with the soul Man without the Peace of the holy spirit in his life the Holy Ghost in his life will be craving that his entire life and Satan has alternatives to bring that peace to his soul in other words being settled with God being settled being settled that God I've accepted his his uh his uh journey to Calvary I accepted what he's done I receive What the Lord Has Done For Me because I'm a sinner I need to be saved every person in this room was born a sinner every person in this room was born a sinner unacceptable to God but the problem is is we try to do good works and we try to do things that would give us a little bit of temporary peace to make us feel good in our soul but God says I don't want you to do that I want you to receive me and you receive peace come to me all ye that are weary and heavy laden why are they weary why are they having Laden trying to get peace on their own but God says come to me for your peace come to me for your settlement and I will give rest for your souls so a man or woman can come to complete rest in their soul level that they are it's been settled God has accepted me because I have accepted his Calvary experience I've accepted what he's done for me and now I'm accepted not because I earned it not because I deserve it but he has accepted me already he died for my sins and it meets the craving but if you don't find that if she doesn't find that they will search their whole life because they got a craving in their soul you have a craving in your soul and the other bad part is people fill it with religion in the message they fill it with something that they do if I can just do this and make Mommy and Daddy happy or make brother Paul happy and if I can just wear this and if I could just be this and be a good girl and do all this stuff so you move into that mode of putting something on the outside but a lot of people they still haven't met the craving on the inside there's a craving that no dress no outward religion there's a craving that none of that will ever satisfy it's his spirit that pours out in your life as you accepted and all of a sudden peace comes that I am at peace with God I am in relationship with God let the world fall apart I am at peace with him God help every person that's listening under the sound of my voice this morning here and on the broadcast and on the internet wherever you are I pray you'll seek God to meet that craving in your soul please Please Don't Pass God by please Hallelujah so that's the soul but emotional and a mental and mental stability comes even after someone sometimes has the rest in their soul emotional mental instability can come to Christians some people don't want to admit that but all you need to do is look in the Bible and look at some of the prophets and some of them they called insane because it looked like they were going insane you don't need to look further than your message you want to look in the message you could see that the servant of God for this generation went through times being emotionally drained and depleted and so there's when that happens then there's there's a need to it for it to be filled with something to calm the nurse something to calm the emotional depletion today usually the instability to humans comes from three main things an addiction addiction originates in three main things and that is a past family dysfunction a past family dysfunction and then the second thing is a real bad trauma happened in life that's the second thing a past family dysfunction a real bad family a bill a real bad trauma that happened to you whether it happened to you when you're five years old or they happened to you last week it's a trauma to your spirit it's a trauma to your emotions and third thing is the pressure of the Demonic realm existing that we live in now is there's a pressure from the Demonic realm particularly the sexual Temptation and the saturation of filthy sexual things in front of us so it's saturated with that and that brings the pressure on the human Spirit a Temptation on the human Spirit you're trying to hold to God but around us is this demonic Force this demonic pressure especially on our young people but it's on every it's on everywhere so three things can cause people to to run towards some addiction to help them relieve and calm themselves but you got to go back to the source that some past family dysfunction took place you grew up with something that affected you and we might as well be honest ever you know I like to say that uh you know the people come to our church and people come and they come from dysfunctional families um probably most of us come from some dysfunction from our family oh I had a pretty good dad and mom had a pretty good life most of us come and then I always like to say we all were born from a dysfunctional family Adam and Eve it's interesting what brother Jared said in the office this morning he says I was talking about you know if they're gonna out if they're going to get outlaw guns let them go ahead and do it I'll sign on outlawing guns when they sign off first on outlawing pornography outlawing video games outlawing the internet outlawing Hollywood television shows that have sex and cussing and all this stuff Outlaw all that first and then I might sign off on a gun but brother Jared said it's an interesting they're going to find some way to murder because they're not changing the hearts you can eliminate all the guns and somebody's going to kill you anyway Kane didn't have a gun Kane the seed of the serpent did not have a gun and he's found a way to murder his brother oh what a world we live in that politics thinks in their arrogance they can change it by getting rid of this it's not the gun it's a man's heart that's craving for the real thing of God and when they don't get it they become addicted to whatever their addiction is they become more addicted to it it feeds the mind and they don't know how to handle it and so they act it's these things that lead to looking for remedies a family a family trauma the a family dysfunction a bad trauma that happened to your life and the Demonic realm we're fighting against if these things in these things then it leads to looking for remedies everybody I want you to just think of not just think of medicine this morning when I think of Remedies okay I don't want you to think of just medicine there are hundreds of other remedies to fill the emotional instable person entertainment books music movies fashions social media you know when you get to these parts just like it's like I say these things just falls on the floor gaming Sports role playing meditation concerts things that emotionally charge us a concert will emotionally charge us even Christian concerts now you trust me now even highly charged emotional gospel meetings even cat meetings that are emotionally charged and I'm not talking about the ones that are preaching the word of God in the right thing but emotionally charged will appeal to someone who's is drained emotionally but listen listen be careful because someone could be be come into an emotionally charged atmosphere and be affected emotionally by it and get very excited but it still can be just a temporary emotional fix because when you go back you have the same addiction when you go back you have nothing to overcome with it's a deception just to present an emotional atmosphere so people feel so great at camp but then they don't feel so great when they get home I Can't Get Enough amens I'll have to read it in the message later to show you Pentecost did that it's a charge emotionally many times and God was doing good things through that praise the Lord and He will do that but always be on guard that you don't fill your emotional instability with just another emotionally charged concert or service blessed be the name of the Lord so something becomes addictive when physically and mentally we become dependent on a particular substance and unable to stop taking it without incurring adverse effects that's the meaning out of the dictionary of what addiction addict being addictive is physically and mentally dependent on a particular substance and unable to stop taking it without incurring adverse effects in other words enthusiastically here's another meaning to addictive enthusiastically devoted to a particular thing or an activity that's not drugs that's enthusiastically devoted to a particular thing or an activity that can become an addiction and what's the addiction for trying to fill an emotional need people go to all kinds of sources to fill their emotional need and I'm here to tell you this morning some of them are good some of them are okay but we can't only go to those things we have to go to God even for our emotional and mental stability so the devil deceives this in that message book or that Bible oh this this there's nothing in here as I read there's nothing in here for me feeling emotionally unstable right now it's got to be something it's not in here that's a lie that's a lie in the presence of the Lord in his word as we as we stay with it young people stay with it read it say God reveal it to me because there is a filling of our emotional need even it fills our souls it fills our minds it fills our bodies even physical healing is in the word of God you can't buy into the deception that modern problems and the reason I'm feeling emotionally depleted because of an incident a trauma that happened the reason I had the the answer for it has got to be some somewhere else some people even seek emotional filling from their own families and I even do that you know we we love our families and so we we gravitate towards them but it's still Limited it's still Limited it's still not the fulfilling that we need to fill with can I get an amen your wife your husband a boyfriend a girlfriend young people will will fill the void of their craving for fellowship and they think that the answer all is if I can just be closer to this person and and they can feel and then they start doing it they start filling that void that craving that's within them and they this is the answer so now we need to do this we need to move on and so you have to be careful though because you have to fill your Void emotionally first with our lord Jesus first because if it's only in that boyfriend or girlfriend or that husband or wife it will disappoint you someday and you'll still feel a lack on the inside it has to be with our loving savior that we find that emotional stability amen praise the Lord so now uh we keep going back and it's filling an emotional thing that we have need of but it's temporary many times it's not solving the problem but we keep going back and we keep going back we're still not settled and stable and our emotions are thinking and so there's no sense being critical of dope addicts this morning and marijuana and all the stores my goodness I drove up to Monroe the other night and every other store is a a place they must be selling it because they wouldn't be up with making money like that with three or four stores every block three or four places now there's become legal in our state there's no sense being critical of the dope addicts though there's no sense and yeah they're an addict they're addicted to that thing look at your own life what are you feeling your emotional need with more likely there's something calms you calms your nerve sometimes laughing calms our nerves and you know uh it's not like that's an evil thing except for it can't be the ultimate thing because as as the prophet said about Hollywood The Comedians will get us to laugh and we'll forget all of our problems because emotionally that's what it does but when we go back home we have the same problems we haven't solved the issues and we've been we've been refilled a little bit by laughter and we laugh and we enjoy it you can even come to church like this and temporarily feel good but there has to be something deeper in our lives something more lasting something more consistent I believe I'm going to bring that answer to you here this morning there's no sense in being critical the dope addicts there's no sense in being critical of an alcoholic when we turn to something instead of the Lord to fill our emotional needs and the the messenger says it this way he says we find out that many people try to find comfort and so he's in talking about our our comforter in the message here he cares to you care he gets into people filling because they need a comforter we find out that many people try to find Comfort by drinking you know we have a saying which is pretty well known among us today I think it is 1963 that there are many ministers drink sometimes before they go to the pulpit a good heavy drink of intoxication and it's been known to seeing ministers on the platform that are even staggering under the influence of liquor and that ought not to be stopped right there well I got it right here right and that ought not to be it should not be he's not going to justify that at all but I want you to next watch the next comment if I can figure out how to do this right in the middle is because many times we might condemn the ban when maybe we ought not to do that we're talking about Pharisees we're talking about Pharisees in the message that can look at one thing and say oh that's terrible addiction hear that he's an alcoholic maybe we should not do that we ought to find back what's the trouble oh that's psychology no the prophet said it maybe we should have a care and understanding where the trouble started because the alcohol is not the problem the alcohol is only what Satan has given to fill a void in his life that's all he knows and it relieves the tension it's not right it's wrong we would never justify it but yet we shouldn't stand there just created being critical where does it come from we ought to find back what's the trouble many of them was converted from alcohol many preachers were converted from alcohol and we find out if they are in that condition it's a disgrace it's a reproach to the body of Christ of course if we if you heard I was doing that you would probably most of you maybe even leave my church and and I would agree you probably should you've got to have confidence in me as a minister I'm bringing you the preaching of the word to for the saving of your souls that's a pretty important position the trust has to be there if it's not let me say this to you if the trust is not there you don't have to look at me as a man but if the trust is there to handle the word for your lives you've got to go find a church or a preacher you've got full trust in I challenge you to do it for your children's sake for your sake because it's all about trust today if you trust me with your souls but if I did this my yeah it would be a disgrace it would be a reproach probably be the end of my Ministry you see but yet you could you could have all that reaction to it and yet but what was the problem and these guys they were converted it says they were converted from alcohol and now they turn back and me being a preacher knowing the emotional stress that you go through as a pastor or preacher I can see why if they had nothing to hold him I can see why they would turn back to the very thing that must be the thing I need because I can't seem to relieve my nerves what a tragedy but he just turned back to the only thing he knew now he's preaching doing it we find out they are in that condition it's a degration and a reproach but no more a reproach than it would be to lie steal or lust after women or any other thing that's a command you see saying the same thing as me and that is that we should not be critical so critical of something like that we hear of something and now we're going to blast them and make them serpent seed right away unless we're researching and saying but Lord I'm going to pray for that man or that woman because it's no more a discretion or approach than a man that's lusting after women and it becomes more evident when a preacher does it when a preacher Falls by the three things preachers have big three Temptations to women to popularity and to money that's the big places that preachers fall and with two of those things we visibly see it it's a public thing that happens it goes out it's a public thing but for your lives usually it's not public not as much as a preacher so there's no sense in being critical of this man because we have to realize it's no different than lying or stealing lusting after women or any other thing that's in the Commandment he goes on see and maybe a man's Born High passion and he sees these modern stripteases on the street he's constantly in trouble you see he the man is born like that now what he ought to do the minister that drinks or the woman that smokes or dresses immorally trying to draw her a comfort from being so well put together that she wants to cause man to look at her she's feeling an emotional need or a soul need by dressing all fancy and sexy she's feeling a need to get that man to whistle at her get him to look towards her she's just like a alcoholic she's just like the gamer that sits for 30 years of his life in front of Gaming I need to get a bigger amen you're feeling an emotional thing that you're lacking that's supposed to be filled with almighty God the woman that smokes or dresses he's he's putting all this stuff together you notice that right she wants to cause that man to look at her there's no other reason she is partially insane you see no sensible woman will not just strip herself before a man that was her that was in her right mind see there's no reason for it at all and she but she's trying these young girls today that go out on the street well you excuse the expression remember this taped only just that's not just these people it goes around the world and a woman that will take her clothes off from her for she knows it's hotter walk out there in the sun naked and then walk out with the same some clothes on and which is the coolest the Indians down there in the papagos and navajos and the pop goes especially at the reservation those women come out with big yarn blankets around them and sit out there in the sun to keep cool why they perspire and the wind that blows sets up an air condition you see and these women have no other reason but Jess you realize the other sex the male sex looking upon such give such an influence to them until they'll squeak their tires and whistle at you the wolf whistle and what do they do for that that what do they do that for the woman does it in order to get the man to do that why do you get out right and remember he's talking about the comforter everybody needs a comforter we're looking for our comfort from somewhere women dressing Immortal she's looking for comfort a woman taking on makeup she's empty inside I'm saying it I'm saying it friends I'm quoting it you have to look at some need in your life that you're trying to fulfill by putting it making your face look different than the way God made it why do you get out there in the heat of the day at four o'clock in the afternoon to mow the grass with people are coming from their work and things it shows it's a spirit of insanity and I know many of them might have an IQ a million times higher than mine but I test your IQ with God's word and see where it comes out see that's modern IQ but the very evidence and fruits of the life proves so they try to find comfort with that many of them say well I don't do that but you I don't go out and do that in the beaches or whatever but you so dress themselves in such an appeal till they tried to be more modern than the woman that's going to sit by them in church the next morning competition who can dress the coolest in the church you know what you're doing you're you're trying to fulfill an emotional depletion sit by the church next word wear a better hat or a better clothes because you can't because you can afford to do it you see sin reaches way down and they try to find a comfort by doing so that's it for now so I wanted to read that because I've always enjoyed here saying you know what this man that's coming drunk to the pulpit there's something lacking and he's filling it with the wrong thing but no sense in being critical of him take a good look at our lives I'm a human being I get emotionally depleted trauma happens in my in my life in my wife it happens more in her than me because she has to live with me trauma happens in my wife trauma you you don't get over a trauma heading and that could be anything you could lose your job you could be a young person you could be bullied or belittled by somebody at school embarrassed at 10 years old you're embarrassed by a whole crowd of young people and they called you names you hardly get over that because our spirit doesn't do well with it it's a trauma to our spirit it can be as little as that or can be as big as a bankruptcy it could be big as losing your home you think job went through a little bit of trauma you think Joe's Spirit was affected yeah he was a little angry he was upset and just laying there and sackcloth and Ashes and just and he just you know angry and you know it's just he was a mess emotionally come on Friends the human Spirit cannot handle that stuff well and lost everything none of us has been where job has been yet and yet Satan's trying to take take him but there was a part Satan could never take and he knew that there's a part Satan could ever take never take from him and God knew it because at the big meeting with God God suggested job you can do anything you want to him thanks thank you Lord but it was the confidence in what was in job he's not going to deny me can you say Amen you can take him through anything he's going to come out of it somehow he's gonna rise again and you know why he knew he could rise again he says because I know my redeemer liveth and though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God I am a redeemer he'll rise again someday and because Heroes again I'm gonna rise out of any kind of trauma in my life somebody say praise the Lord I don't care what trauma hits my spirit I don't care what depression comes in my life Satan can't take this God that's within me [Applause] think he'd come to a trauma emotional down emotional low he came to it friends and so all these other areas that we turn to I know this is just a real in your face message but it's more Meek pondering these things it's more me pondering these things because I turn to things that are filling the emotional see when we dealt with some very deep things in the overcoming sexual Temptation class and I won't tell you all the things but it's very important for a man it's a godly man this day examine a bunch of things and look a lot of things you got to look at how God's made you as a man because Satan knows how God's made you he knows how you tick if you don't know how your brain works you're going to lose the battle come on you got to look at your enemy instead of your enemy his tactics first thing you got to have is go to prayer receive the holy spirit in your life that's the first thing these are all these things but one of the things you delve into is that lust is lust a failure is a failure a moral failure whatever it would be it's sin and sin it will be cruel to everything in your life will be taken away from you sin is never nice sin is never has a good result it's always going to end up bad sin is cruel but if you step back and say but where did this start why did I turn to this you're going to find that you were not meeting an emotional need in God so you chose something else he has to become the filler of our needs of all of our needs all of our life there's a scripture in Proverbs says let a man drink from his own fountain that God's provided for him it talks about his family talks about his wife it actually gets into the the the family relations sexual experience God gives you a fountain even for that to drink from and it's only meant to be fulfilled by the wife in a marriage young boys young girls it's only meant to be filled in one place and it's blessed by God that's in a marriage with one person for life it's not to be played with one person and until you find that Holy Ghost filled person then you leave that alone you say accuse it God let me put this and let me stay pure before you until you give me that one person this is only one place you don't play around there's only one place sexual fulfillment is pleasing to God and that's in a in a holy marriage so God even provides a fountain to drink from even for that he loves us but don't you ever think that God's not involved in providing for those things God provides for every one of your needs a fountain to drink from fountains that he's the great Fountain then he gives you a family then he gives you children then he gives you things that satisfy you then he gives you things that sent from him that will satisfy your emotional need instead of getting it somewhere else I want to go for a minute and I'm not going to get to all this today so I'll be mindful of the time but I want to go to Elijah and I know Elijah is a different a different bird because we realize his stress came from standing for the compromise of the church standing against Ahab standing against the prophets of Israel who were prophesying wrong influenced by Jezebel and standing against Jezebel breathing down his neck a woman was going after the man of God and so the reason I want to talk about because he hit such a low time after his high time he hit and the prophet says he had three stages to his journey and that was Mark Carmel when he called fire down and slew the prophets Supernatural he stood alone everybody against him he's still alone called fire down such a Mountaintop experience Mount Carmel then the second phase of his life was a Jupiter tree where he come out of that Mountaintop and he was there alone and Jezebel's breathing said I'm gonna if I'm gonna mark my words I'm gonna kill you for what you've done I'm coming after you so he goes into this depression and he's he comes to a juniper tree in his life five that he's just alone and he says God I don't even want to live just shoot me just in my life I don't want to go on anymore I'm finished and brother Brown elaborates on his depression and his his just just being completely so low that he just began to sleep it off he fell asleep and slept for for days I'll tell you sometimes that might be better for some of y'all than turn into all the other things you turn to sometimes people get angry and they're on edge because they just haven't got any rest lately slap it off and this is the juniper tree so he goes through a valley and then he comes to a cave experience without which will be our answer today the cave experience but going through the juniper tree it was pretty low he wanted to kill himself he was suicidal he wanted to see his life ended he was so low after this great Mountain there's one thing Christian's got to learn I wish that sir Inez was here I would have her sing the song I love her to sing it sister knows if you're listening I wish you'd have been here to sing this song the old song but the God on the mountain is still God in the valley and if you only like the god in the mountain and you're going to just travel to camp meetings and you only like to live on the emotional highs you haven't really got to know God in the valley yet and if you're going to grow in the Lord you have to know God in the valley because the same God that was in the emotional high can you say man is the same God that's with you in your lows and you cling to him you don't cling to some entertainment you don't cling to some relieving of your nurse if you have to do that medicine I'm not condemning that I'm just saying don't cling to that and not to God cling to God I don't understand anything right now I just want to see my life in please take me Lord take me home Henry has that song he wrote take me home take me home I have to play it to myself one time I have to play it because that's how you feel Lord just take me home end all of this I'm ready to go he's writing that because that's how you feel and there's no it's you know we talk so much about strength and brother Brown preached perfect strength to perfect weakness and he says this is a strange subject for the Pentecostals who are always talking about how strong they are boasting we're strong we're strong and I think that's good but yes in human human we're weak and God gets Glory when we're admitting that we're weak and that we cannot depend on anything else but God can you say Amen we're weak in ourselves and when we're weak then God can express his strength through our weakness it's humility to say I can't do this on my own and I'm not going to turn to something else to meet my emotional void turn into my God I'm you don't think other prophets and other people in the Bible Christ said I've been mistreated I've it's been it's unfair I'm in the hounds of hell are after me I've got a jezebel after me I don't know what it is but God I turn to you I will not turn to anything else I am emotionally unstable right now and I'm willing to admit it but God I'm staying right here until you answer and you come and you fill this need you feel my emotional instability you make me stable you stabilize it can I get an amen this morning praise the Lord and so Elijah here he comes into this state uh and I'll just let the prophet explain it and there's quite a bit here I might cut it off in the middle and we'll pick it up next week or whenever we can pick it up I hope you're getting something out of this this morning I the Lord I was still here till I prayed here in the sanctuary and I was still here crying out to God God what do you want me to say tomorrow morning I'm open Lord what it is just laying on the couch meditating in that office and God directly come and brought this Elijah and spoke to me said you say that in the morning to the people Elijah had a hard day he had been on Mount Carmel he had seen the glory of the Lord come down he had prayed fire out of heavens and then prayed rain down upon the Earth and under all this strain his nerves were about Broken Oh How I can feel for him and here we find him first preaching to a backsled nation of people and to a jezebel that wanted her way and the people had to come to a place that they had forsaken God for suck all his promises and all of his Commandments have no longer kept his statues and cared nothing for him it sounds like the world that we live in and Elijah in the midst of it all he could not compromise he had to stand true to his convictions and how that reflects in this day and they had a queen there by the name of Jezebel and she had let all the children of Israel stray with her modern fantastic way of living and I tell you Elijah and his nerves on the edge anyhow I always felt sorry for him his nerves was about ready to break anyhow and that great pound from Jezebel finished the stroke then he run and went into the Wilderness and laid under the juniper tree you know if you study your Bible you can see the kind of woman that Jezebel was she had her husband under her thumb and her control she had all the prophets in the church under control she had everybody leading them and the husband was bowing to her wouldn't wouldn't speak up she had everybody but she didn't have this man she didn't have this man of God and she thought that she could control him like she controls her husband she was calling the shots Jezebel's spirit but she come into a wrong way when she put her guns on the man of God that experience of the juniper tree there's many of us find ourselves under the junior tree I get myself under there many times to a place that you don't know what to do you're frustrated frankly I'm right under it now and wanting oh God what would you have me to do you know people under the juniper tree is like Elijah they like to sleep I preach to more tired people than anybody in the world people is so tired they're so mentally strained until they're filling the insane institutions and hospitals everywhere they're went in such a nervous condition until they don't know what they do believe and what they want they're just laying there they don't know what to do oh it's such a sad sight what year are we talking here 1959. such a sad sight I preached to more tired people that was 1959 and so now he was preaching to tired people I preached the more sleeping people than I ever have in my life they've just gone to sleep now people are tired that we're out physically mentally and I just tell you sometimes it's just you're tired but sometimes you're bringing it on yourself there's no Sabbath in your life there's no rest in your life there's no selling down and meditating on God there's no spending an hour in his word everything else is more important had people pray for me pray I'm stressed out I don't know but a lot of it they bring on themselves I don't mean to preach on you that's why I'm preaching on myself we are physically mentally spiritually emotionally wore out in this generation we're going to have to have a better answer than the stuff that we turn to such a sad thing listen here my brother you can drink it off you can Shout It Off neither can you play cards till it's dull and you can take a thousand CSS and try to sleep it off and you can't do it all the little remedies only thing it does is help the symptoms we've got to have a cure for the disease we've got to have all the psychiatrists in the world cannot cure it it only helps the symptoms praise the Lord listen I'm not I'm going to balance it out I'm going to tell you brother Bram says God can heal by medicine God can heal by love it's the mystery how God can heal a person sometimes there's not one specific way that God would heal a person but when he heals you you give the glory to God he can heal by love he can live by you caring for a person they're hurting and you say I care for you I want to pray for you I want to encourage you just a little bit of love can heal that person but we give the glory to God so I'm not knocking how God can work through different ways I'm preaching against that becoming our all and not God care is in the blood of Jesus Christ not take a rest at the seashore not to get an Anthem you could go to all the greatest vacations in the world and I've been there and done that I've been to a lot of places in my early years and I tell young pastors this and young ministers if you go on vacation give yourself permission to have a vacation now I know that seems funny but people can take all of their stress and all their business and their phones and all of their things all they can take it all with them on vacation and the wife says oh I'm thankful we've got a vacation and you're all in another world on vacation because you haven't given yourself permission to have a vacation so I tell these pastors if you go do it what you need to do it give yourself permission to do it and be all there so the kids aren't recognizing dad never really left home he's he's out here looking it out of our window at the beach and he never really left home I you know why I'm preaching because I'm preaching myself I did it for years I felt guilty for taking a vacation I felt guilty for resting things are gonna these are gonna fall apart things are going to fall apart at home and I was worried about home and this and this and I had a pastor tell me I said how can you co-travel that much when you got your congregation home and you got things to work on help with people how can you go that long on vacation he goes he said well those problems will be there when I get back and I'm preaching on anybody here I'm just saying all of us have stress in our lives and we can take our stress with us on vacation because we don't know how to really rest and we don't know the place to find rest because we've been told can't be in my Bible can't be in the word can't be at church that's becoming a I'll tell you friends when church becomes an inconvenience when church becomes something we're afraid to come to I don't know what's happening there but I just think Satan's involved you need to be refreshed you need to forget the people you need to forget and say I'm coming to meet my God face to face I need this more than anything else in the world I'm hungry spiritually I'm hungry emotionally and this is the place I believe I'm gonna find it the cares in the blood Jesus Christ not take a rest not go to an Anthem acquire to sing anthems that's what we're trying to do today see now he's not knocking going to some Anthem or concert but he's just saying that's not the Cure that'll emotionally be a man those guys were great that's great it's not the Cure oh we'll make ourselves like the Joneses so that's another thing we feel our emotional need we got to make our house like the Joneses house next door we gotta dress like the Joneses we've got to be like the Josephs all you're doing is fulfilling an emotional depletion in your life you're doing it for the wrong reason and we're trying to do something different trying to educate it out there's only one way to do it that's face the fact that's right and if you're upset and frustrated don't join Church don't join a church come to Christ that's what you come to obviously somebody got to find the person of Jesus Christ your answer is not in literal life here can you say Amen your answer is not in some preacher some big preacher in the message you know if I just get to that oh what did we go somebody said about one Minister what are we gonna what are we gonna do when he's gone how will the bride what are we going to do in this Minister I won't mention his name I wouldn't do that but oh I don't know what we're going to do you know what we're going to do the Holy Ghost is going to raise up other ministers like that brother when he's dead God is going to preach to his people God is going to bring his people to a Rapture and it may not be all the big preachers in the message a bunch of them have died already and went to their reward can you say Amen I'm not dependent I'm not dependent on some Minister some one particular mister I'm dependent on the Holy Ghost providing a five-fold Ministry to bring me into a rapture see well I'm not dependent on I don't need preachers I don't really need when push comes to stop I don't really need to come here you don't really when the Bible says for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry you're not going to make it in a Rapture with just your Bible you're not going to rank it in the Rapture by just your tapes of brother banham at home and push and play you're not going to make it because God called a faithful Ministry to take that message and preach it to you every week [Applause] oh God doesn't use mechanical devices he has live Ministry he's provided and The Messengers that are in this day take that message that's preached to the seventh angel and keep preaching it to the people and by the way I preached that here I preach the message I'm quoting it right here you know the big office says you we you want to be in our mailing list do you push play do you play do you play enough for brother man you play brother man I said I said well we rarely play the tape itself but I know for 35 years I've quoted the seventh mentioned messenger almost every service why am I getting dumped out because I don't push play this is just another little beef I have sorry see you can take me off your mailing list I know what I've been preaching for 35 years and it's not denominational Creeds and dogmas I don't get my sermons off some some pre-prepared sermon I feed on that Bible and the message of the seventh angel and I preach it to the people by the grace of God oh well we'll make ourselves like the Joneses that's it and if you're upset and frustrated don't join Church come to Christ many of us hit those places especially after a Mount Carmel experience it was asking me the other day by someone how that about how what would we what can we be done what can be done for us at this time there's only one thing that we can do and so someone is frustrated about something and they're saying brother and what are we going to do what do we there's some situations matter of fact it should be all of them here it is commit yourself when you are in a juniper there's only one thing that you can do Hold Steady and commit yourself to God I don't understand a clue what's happening right now I don't understand people I don't understand what just happened to me I don't understand the attack on my family I don't know what's going on Lord I'm being honest I don't know what's going on but I'm committed to you right now I'm committed I'm stable with you right now I'm not moving anywhere I'm not going anywhere the only thing we can do is commit ourselves to God during the juniper trees I'm committed I don't know what's going to happen but I know something's going to happen but right now I'm just committed to God I'm not going to binge on a television series I'm not gonna play video games for the next 48 hours to relieve my nerves don't make me the enemy I'm just the messenger come on now I'm not going to go back to that romance novel because I'm going through this trauma right now I'm not going back to that romance novel series that's been on maybe it's been on the shelf for years but I'm bringing it back out because I remember I got I got it just caught my nerves so I'm going to read about Sally and Ted and they they were really you know and you know they're hurting lives and they come together and it's just they were everything and they lived happily ever after and it just I don't know what it does but just it just caused my nerves just to read that story trial you're going through is a little bit more serious than that you'll need a soap opera to answer to needs that are in your family it's not real soap Opera's not real need something real is anybody listening to me this morning I'm gonna commit myself to God right here what about fishing and all that well I can't preach against fishing is Tom here I couldn't do that because we catch one every now and then every few years we catch a fish I keep wondering what's wrong and I'm thinking it's him there are things that do relax us and that's why brother Branson he's going to say it here he said I'll go hunting and because I'm under stress and he said but Ben people will I'll hear the criticism look at that preacher going and taking all that time off and hunting you see there I'm not preaching against things sometimes that would relax us but we cannot we cannot make that the the fill all for being depleted emotionally you can't we can't do it because then you go with me and brother Tom and you're thinking that if I get enough fish it'll emotionally settle me and then you get disappointed that's not all that bad with brother Tom we've we do pretty good it's those it's those Japanese guys in the next boat 20 feet away that's real and a man 20 feet away it's another beef I'm bringing out right now God's favoring them for some reason okay it's quarter to one I gotta end here I got to get to the answer here he comes into the cave commit yourself to God now I know a man that can overwork himself and a man can under work himself a man God know this man needed feeding he needed something to eat and under that place there where he was laying God had to do something for him God has to do something for every man that comes under the juniper tree notice God has to do something and he'll go to pieces or he'll go to Pieces he has to do it if his servant is laying under the tree Yonder don't know what to do he's carried out his commission Elijah said oh Lord let me die I've had those feelings after I come out of the meeting and looked like I have tried and preached and begged and persuaded and seen the angel of God sweep through a meeting and do signs and wonders and sit in the car on the outside and hear them cry and say that wasn't nothing but psychology there's nothing to it nothing to that that's all nonsense so it doesn't end Great Mighty meeting of God and there's still pressure from the enemy criticism you're not going to get out of life without criticism young people you're going to be bullied you're going to be criticized you're going to be made fun of and things are going to be unfair but you have a God that can see you through all of it you cling to God oh when I crawl under the jewelry I think Lord did you why did you let me do it what can I what can be done but we all hit those experiences but the mercy of Jehovah to his servant God knows your trials just know this he knows all about it so he comes down and he knows his servant needs some rest so he just puts him to sleep for a little while while he's laying there waiting for to recuperate praying to die Lord my father's died before me and now take my life I've done enough I've fought the good fight I've finished the course but there was a work to be done yet God wasn't through with his prophet he still had work no matter how much we cry out and think that that this that or the other nothing can take us until God is finished with us I'm so glad to know that you want to see at the end of that but see the very reason you're still here is God still has a purpose for your life God still has something for you to do can you say man Hallelujah sometimes you feel like as I did one time put a pistol against my head to commit suicide but I couldn't do it I took my glove off to lay it on a high voltage line where I was working but I couldn't do it something still had the same God that was with Elijah the same God that same God today he's seen me under the juniper tree God sees us under the juniper trees my wife and my baby lay under in the grave and my dad and my brother-in-law and all I was just about gone myself I've laid under the jewelry it's hard and I've got to a place I was so beside myself I tried to take a gun and shoot my brains out it wouldn't do good do it you see there's work yet to be done something has to be done God wasn't finished he'll always take care of you poor tired weary servant he saw him he know where he was he knows where you're at tonight you may be under a juniper tree everything gone but remember he knows where you're at we don't need a whole lot of re-fixing up like the old colored woman I kept this in because I loved it down in the South she had an accident a car hit her and it hurt her pretty bad and the lawyer said do you want to sue for damages lost in Mercy no honey said I haven't I have enough damage I want some repair Hallelujah I got enough damage I need some repair I need some healing in my life this morning see suing somebody's to get back at them for the damage we don't do that no we cry out to our God say God I need some healing and repair find out that he was 40 days and 40 nights God located him standing pulling him back in the cave and God wanted to attract this tension so now he moves to the cave God moved him he fed him some he when he woke up he seen some cakes cooking there that God had put for him some cake cooking and a a thing of water fresh water beside him and he said get up and eat and he just where'd all that come from came from God God has the food you need God provides just what you need for nourishment during your juniper tree get up and eat he gets up and eats it all and then he falls back to sleep for another few days when he wakes up there's another cake there there's another thing of water finally when he gets his strength up he gets up he moves him to this cave and I'm closing I promise God wanted to attract us it is there was a great storm passed by and it rent the mountains it was so powerful till it shook the Rocks but God wasn't in the storm it went before God did and then there come a great earthquake that shook the Earth but still God wasn't in the earthquake and there come a fire but God wasn't in the fire and then there came a still Small Voice and God was where God was in a still small voice I just brought you the answer his still small voice isn't gone but we can't hear it because life has become so noisy but it's here and interesting it's called a still small I think that's intentional I think it's to teach us something because nothing's still in our lives nothing small in our lives the trauma's small anymore they're big traumas the voices and noise we hear are loud noises everywhere but when we find his it'll be a still small voice and he says I I have been in the earthquake I have been in the storm I've been in a lot of things but in this time in your life right you'll find me in a still small voice brother sister I've been back in a cave long enough and you know to know that there's been a lot of earthquakes shaking around a lot of noise and fusses and stews and things like that and big meetings and where has God been out of it there's the reason that's the reason I said this morning there's got to come something deeper than a healing service freedom are we against them no but there's got to come something deeper even than a physical healing service there's got to something something deeper than healing service there's got to come something deeper than a gift to speak with tongues there's got to be something deeper than a rushing Mighty wind the wind went forth but God wasn't in it we've had rushing Mighty winds all over the country and Sensations and blood in the face and in the hands all kinds of signs but where is God at and all the great fuss in America is guilty of listening to those noises we love noise but God is not in the noise although as honorable and thing as that we are yet God isn't in the noise if that would have been so when the Africans beat the tomtoms you never heard such a noise in Rhythm God wasn't in it and we've had rushing Mighty winds we've had all kinds of fires and earthquakes and shakings and great revivals and things like that God wasn't in it if it had been it would have showed itself up but after that come a still Small Voice then God was in The Voice somebody said praise the Lord God was in the still Small Voice God was in The Voice it's here friends it's here and when Jesus said be careful that your hearts become overburdened and depressed by all this around you and your emotions are depleted you know all that pressure was in direct resistance and conflict to the scripture before that was our answer still small voice heavens and earth will pass away in front of you but my word is stable my still Small Voice is there but you got to pull away come away Song of Solomon Come Away Little Bride come away how many rage against it I I feel that but I don't obey it every time I feel that voice of my beloved saying to me as a bride Come Away come away to me get quiet listen to my voice come away come away little bride every young person every older person everybody's called to the same still Small Voice you may have heard it this morning because you sat long enough an hour and a half you sat and listened hopefully it's not just my voice but you hear something calling you how many believes it'll bring stability to your emotions I can be going through the worst thing and it just stabilizes me brother Joe didn't expect last night his boy had pains Clayton nobody expected on a Saturday night you think it's going to be a normal Sun Sunday goes in has appendix taken out this morning praise God he's doing well unexpected things that can put your nerves on edge Financial things but you're in our nerves on edge we're not going to change that it's going to get worse the pressure is going to get worse but we have a fountain to drink from we have a voice that's speaking to us can you say Amen didn't expect that to happen but praise God he's all right this morning stabilized us can you say Amen heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away you to be there with you and in you till the end my brother and sister he's the calm within the storm I know you're the calm within the storm Henry wrote this song and I and when it

Word of Promise the word of Hope you've given it to us Lord we thank you for it may we turn to it may we learn to turn to it may we commit to God when we don't understand may we turn to your word and may we learn in this cave experience that God is not in this the earthquake or the wind or the fire but we'll find God In the Still Small Voice to refresh us to build us up to fill our emotional need to fill our mental need Lord to fill our souls as well Lord I pray for everyone Lord just now that they'll find such a peace that passes all understanding just now Lord find your calm in your word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we commit each soul to you we repent Lord when we turn to other things so much we repent Lord for taking our emotional instability and escaping into something forgive us Lord of that may we run to you may we escape Into You Lord may we find that secret Pavilion that a prophet preached in a rapture he didn't preach about the catching away it preached about that secret of his Pavilion secret of his Tabernacle and we come into that and hide ourselves away in that or that's when we come Rapture material is when we're hiding ourselves in your presence that's where you called us to Lord granted father for each person here we got young children Lord already scared the devil's scaring them identity crisis young children Lord that feel so lonely they don't know what they're going to do next oh God come near them this morning and love them and draw them to yourself Lord let them know you'll never leave them or forsake them your presence is always there father feed them Lord with the food that you gave Elijah that day Supply when they don't have any strength Supply them with the cake and water they need of Jesus Christ we ask it amen amen you love the Lord this
