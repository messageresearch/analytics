[0:17] believers
[0:18] and tonight uh us brother was saying uh
[0:21] you guys worked very hard last week and
[0:24] you might be still a little tired
[0:26] I didn't work that hard but I did a
[0:28] little work so but I'm older so I'm
[0:32] tired but I'm more than tired because
[0:34] I'm retired that's being tired twice you
[0:37] only been tired once you don't know what
[0:39] it is to retire twice
[0:42] you find out one of these days
[0:45] yeah because my grandchildren they sure
[0:48] give me the wrong for my money or their
[0:49] money I don't know
[0:51] they tired me out quickly those those
[0:54] guys said I don't know where they get so
[0:55] much energy anyway
[0:57] so it's it's a joy
[1:00] to be here and we have fun last week and
[1:04] again uh
[1:06] it is always a pleasure and an honor to
[1:09] be
[1:10] I'm on your guys today
[1:12] you know I feel at home so that says a
[1:16] lot
[1:17] so I'm comfortable and I'm not I'm an at
[1:20] ease so that comes for something because
[1:23] I've been around and not every place you
[1:25] go you you feel welcome but I thank you
[1:28] for you lovely uh his church with us and
[1:32] thank you for your for everything you
[1:34] have done for us since we've been here
[1:36] and uh
[1:38] from the church in Tucson love divine we
[1:41] bring your greetings from the pastor on
[1:43] the church
[1:44] and uh may God will bless you richly for
[1:47] all your efforts not only within the
[1:50] body but also what you do in the mission
[1:52] in the mission field because I know you
[1:54] guys are busy doing this work and as
[1:57] long as we're here we will work
[1:59] for the Lord amen let's let's read from
[2:02] Philippians chapter 2.
[2:05] uh
[2:08] let's read verse 5 and 8 it's on the
[2:12] screen if you don't
[2:15] it says bless this mind
[2:19] be in you
[2:22] so what he's saying how the same
[2:23] attitude
[2:25] have the same mindset
[2:27] think
[2:28] the way he thought
[2:30] that is also in Christ Jesus
[2:35] that we being in the form of God who
[2:38] being in the form of God
[2:40] thought is that robbery
[2:44] to be equal with God
[2:46] being God you know the logos God empty
[2:49] himself in him the logos that was God's
[2:53] form God forming himself
[2:56] in the creation that was the first thing
[2:58] that was created the logo God created
[3:00] himself in the creation and he took a
[3:03] form called the logos but later on we
[3:05] know who the logos was
[3:07] and then he becomes a man
[3:09] and he says sorry not Rory so even that
[3:12] he was God equal with God he never took
[3:15] advantage for it
[3:17] and you and I we need to learn that you
[3:20] know whatever position we are called we
[3:21] don't take advantage of our positions in
[3:24] all our gifts because it is God that
[3:28] provides everything it is God against
[3:30] everything
[3:31] he said he didn't take advantage of
[3:33] being who he was but made himself alone
[3:37] reputation
[3:41] I looked at the word reputation he says
[3:43] make boy make of non-effect I like this
[3:47] one too empty
[3:48] to make empty to make void
[3:52] deprive
[3:56] underbain useless a non-effect
[3:59] so see he came and he couldn't have a
[4:02] reputation but he emptied himself
[4:05] and I like that word because the more
[4:07] you empty yourself
[4:09] the more you can have of him
[4:12] but the problem is not me it's not the
[4:14] person not the church you are your worst
[4:16] enemy
[4:17] and we're going to see that the more you
[4:18] empty yourself the more he can feel you
[4:21] and the more he can feel you we're going
[4:23] to see what the effects of the result of
[4:24] that will be tonight
[4:26] he says
[4:28] and he took the form of a servant he
[4:31] left his Royal clothes
[4:33] he left his stroll
[4:35] and he became what
[4:37] a servant
[4:39] see he didn't take advantage
[4:41] he didn't want everybody to worship him
[4:43] or maybe wanted to do for him but I'm
[4:45] God so you know I require this he
[4:48] requires a lot of stuff but he don't
[4:49] force anybody
[4:51] and was made in the likeness of man
[4:55] it will come a body Jesus the body
[4:59] so
[5:01] let us pray father we thank you once
[5:04] again for this opportunity that we have
[5:06] to to look at your word we ask you to to
[5:09] give us what we have need father tonight
[5:12] you know we what is in our heart and you
[5:14] know what it takes father
[5:16] I don't know but you do know father so
[5:19] I'm I'm gonna do my best to stay out of
[5:21] the way
[5:22] keep my thoughts my side here my
[5:24] opinions I don't want them
[5:26] but I want yours tonight I want the man
[5:29] of Christ father to be displayed but we
[5:32] thank you again for your goodness your
[5:34] your
[5:36] your what you do what you're doing and
[5:38] you will do for us father tonight and
[5:41] you are done we love you and we thank
[5:43] you bless this congregation the pastors
[5:45] and why father and those the deacons
[5:48] those who are that are in offices father
[5:52] trustees father we we love you and we
[5:56] ask you that you racely will bless them
[5:58] in Jesus name we ask you these things
[6:00] amen and amen so you can be seated
[6:06] so
[6:08] verse 8 says and being found in a
[6:11] fashion as a man
[6:14] he humble himself that's what I wanted
[6:16] to get to
[6:18] because the preaching the title is
[6:20] humbleness I don't know I'm not too good
[6:22] with titles but we have to put one
[6:25] so I chose that one
[6:27] so if you feel a lot it doesn't matter
[6:30] it is the content doesn't matter so
[6:32] and being found a fashionable man he
[6:35] humble himself
[6:37] and became obedient not only he humble
[6:40] he said but he became obedient
[6:42] or to what or to death
[6:45] even the death of the cross
[6:49] so I believe that
[6:52] we are he is our example tonight
[6:56] and if he came and that was at least his
[6:59] main you know qualities or
[7:01] characteristic or character
[7:04] we cannot do we less than that
[7:07] now remember he was he humbled himself
[7:11] he was obedient
[7:14] all the way to the cross
[7:16] and that's you and I we have the same
[7:18] Journey there's no different Journey if
[7:21] God is the same just say today and
[7:22] forever he's doing the same in you that
[7:24] he did with in Christ can be no
[7:25] different
[7:26] so we need to Humble ourselves
[7:29] we need to be obedient
[7:32] unto death I mean this guy had to die
[7:36] when we are here the only time we are
[7:39] here we are dead physically or or
[7:42] spiritually
[7:43] but we had to die to ourselves
[7:46] die to our desires and that takes
[7:48] obedience but obedience is produced by
[7:52] humbleness that's my title then
[7:56] so the humble you are you're going to
[7:59] find out that more obedient you will be
[8:01] and the more
[8:03] you become like him because the more you
[8:06] die out the more humble you get and the
[8:09] more obedient you get
[8:13] process in Roman 9 13 4 if you live
[8:16] after the flesh you shall die
[8:19] so the flesh has to die
[8:21] there is no good thing in this flesh
[8:25] see but if you through the spirit
[8:28] mortify or kill the disease of the body
[8:31] you want
[8:32] you shall live
[8:35] and we know that Jesus came
[8:38] and he didn't do nothing on his own he
[8:40] had a mind he could think he could do
[8:42] things he had opinions in fact he had a
[8:45] will
[8:46] but he decided to empty himself out of
[8:48] all he thought all his you know whatever
[8:50] he thought he was right or wrong
[8:53] to just to do the will of the father
[8:56] see so whatever he saw the father doing
[8:59] that's what he done
[9:01] so that's why I'm saying he empty
[9:03] himself he empty his mind
[9:06] see just to do the will of God
[9:09] and it's no different tonight that's
[9:11] what we have to do if we want to be out
[9:13] of here
[9:14] because this body you know it's not
[9:17] going to inherit eternal life we know
[9:19] that this condemned is going down what
[9:21] he came from to the ground
[9:23] but there's something in you that's
[9:25] leaving
[9:27] and he has to eternal life brother
[9:29] Banner says he never lasting life
[9:31] he says obedience is better than
[9:34] sacrifice
[9:36] because some people think because I
[9:37] don't give him my tithing because I come
[9:39] into church because I'm doing this
[9:41] because I'm doing that I must be home
[9:43] you know humble and obedience
[9:46] well no that's not what it means it
[9:49] means that you're doing a lot of things
[9:51] it's not a lot of things that make you
[9:53] humble it's not a lot of things that
[9:55] make you you know faithful it's not
[9:56] that's righteousness
[9:59] and that is our righteousness that's not
[10:02] his righteousness
[10:04] the time that we put our eyes on what we
[10:06] do that's righteousness and my
[10:09] righteousness would not get him anywhere
[10:12] another one my righteousness I want his
[10:14] righteousness
[10:16] so he said obedience better than
[10:18] sacrifice
[10:19] do what the holy spirit says do
[10:24] what we need tonight is to let loose of
[10:27] all our little old squishy
[10:30] you know that's probably Kentucky on the
[10:32] squeezy ideas
[10:34] I never heard that one
[10:36] and let the Holy Spirit
[10:39] you are taught here you know what is
[10:42] right and what is wrong
[10:45] so what he's saying you're not ignorant
[10:47] and if you do what you're doing and
[10:49] because you ignorant because you got the
[10:51] holy ghost that will rebuke your will
[10:53] you know convict you that's not right
[10:55] that's not wrong there's no excuse do
[10:58] what the Holy Ghost tell you to do
[11:00] because Satan is going to tempt you I
[11:02] know that he's going to put ideas and
[11:04] he's going to tempt you with things but
[11:06] we have a choice
[11:08] you know the choice is to do his will
[11:13] see
[11:14] and let the Holy Spirit you are thought
[11:16] here that's what the ministry is for
[11:18] that's what your pastor is for that's
[11:20] why when you come to church
[11:22] to teach you what's right and wrong so
[11:25] when you go out there you have something
[11:27] I mean if you don't know right or wrong
[11:29] like a little child you know he don't
[11:31] know evil he don't know bad good or
[11:33] indifferent so they do whatever they do
[11:35] because they don't know
[11:37] but we'd like to train them you know
[11:39] because they're going to stay that way
[11:40] forever we train our children in the way
[11:43] they should go so when they get older
[11:45] that we know what depart
[11:47] so
[11:49] the same thing with us we come to church
[11:51] the pastor is just chopping away you
[11:54] know creating a masterpiece you know God
[11:57] is through your pastor in the ministry
[11:58] is chipping away that God don't like
[12:02] he's making a masterpiece and a chip
[12:04] away and a chip away and so
[12:08] what he desires we come out
[12:12] but this flesh had to be out of the way
[12:14] so when the the Holy Spirit convict you
[12:17] on in the services do it
[12:20] don't make excuses
[12:22] you know let's do what the Holy Ghost
[12:26] because that is what is called the
[12:28] sermon that's why we come to church to
[12:30] know what's right or wrong so we have
[12:32] this sermon when we are there by
[12:34] ourselves that Satan likes to see you by
[12:36] yourself because it's easier
[12:39] to attack one person that the whole
[12:41] congregation here you feel good because
[12:43] he's not here
[12:45] see because we have rebuking
[12:48] but he's still waiting outside the doors
[12:50] and he touched to take advantage of his
[12:53] situation
[12:54] so the more humble we become
[12:57] the more obedience you become
[13:00] because you're humble into the word of
[13:02] God to the will of God
[13:04] and the more you humble to the will the
[13:06] more obedience you come
[13:08] and through that obedience them come
[13:10] faith
[13:11] faith is the most I mean uh
[13:14] faith is a demonstration of your
[13:17] humbleness
[13:18] and your obedience
[13:20] see because faith is all actions see
[13:23] faith without action is dead
[13:25] so the more you walk in Humble is the
[13:28] more you obey the more your faith will
[13:31] increase
[13:32] because you're going to be doing the
[13:33] will of God
[13:35] see it was no it was no
[13:38] uh fight between the flesh
[13:41] it's always a struggle
[13:44] but Jesus knew what to do
[13:47] so you and I the same thing you know he
[13:50] tempted he was tempted by the devil but
[13:53] he knew use a word
[13:55] and you and I that's what we do we come
[13:58] to learn so we can rebuke that Satan and
[14:01] use the right word
[14:03] see
[14:04] but we know that faith without love is
[14:06] is nothing
[14:08] so
[14:10] let's not get out of balance where you
[14:12] know I'm humble
[14:14] and I'm obedience and I got faith well
[14:17] then you have to love because faith
[14:19] without love means nothing
[14:21] Paul says I can move mountains I can do
[14:23] this I can do that but without love we
[14:26] are nothing
[14:28] so I'm glad that God put checks and
[14:31] balances in the world you know
[14:33] if I'm humble then I had to also have
[14:35] love and if I'm obedient I had to have
[14:38] faith
[14:39] so you start examining yourself this is
[14:42] in my life it's not let's go to God
[14:44] examine my life and let's develop let
[14:46] God bring that that is in you it might
[14:50] cost you you might have to suffer for it
[14:52] because God is going to test you
[14:55] you know but that's its way
[14:57] but that is his love to you
[15:01] it's not that his mother you want to
[15:03] destroy you that is love to you when he
[15:05] let you go through all those things
[15:07] he's trying to bring something out of
[15:08] you and the quicker we humble to him to
[15:11] his hand
[15:12] the better we will be
[15:15] but the Bible says in Humble thyself I
[15:17] was talking to a man the other day
[15:20] he was just organizing a church up
[15:23] pull out
[15:24] of our organization that they did and a
[15:29] clear word brother both and that church
[15:32] where they had the greatest Church there
[15:34] for so long and then the Lord was was
[15:38] blessing then the people got to the
[15:42] place that they wanted to polish up you
[15:44] know become a denomination like the rest
[15:46] of them
[15:47] and then they throw into organization
[15:51] and what they did they just throw
[15:55] see and then he said humble Christians
[15:57] either is there did not
[16:00] all their life had been taught against
[16:02] it so they walk away from it
[16:05] so you what you are taught is very
[16:07] important
[16:08] you cannot live the heart when you are
[16:10] taught by your pastor
[16:12] and your pastor is teaching you how to
[16:15] be humble
[16:16] but the Bible says that's now they they
[16:20] they have it says humble Christians in
[16:24] their dinner or their life had been
[16:26] thought against it and that's one of the
[16:29] problems we have
[16:30] in our churches we get a lot of people
[16:32] all the time but they've been trained by
[16:35] all the churches you know I'm not saying
[16:37] that they're bad or indifferent I'm
[16:39] saying they've been trained different
[16:41] than you've been trained so they come to
[16:44] church and then we have to retrain them
[16:46] and then in the meantime we have to be
[16:49] you know patient with them because they
[16:52] have been trained sometimes wrong
[16:55] how to get the Holy Ghost everybody got
[16:57] ideas on how to get their Holy Ghost
[16:58] that's just one way to get the Holy
[17:00] Ghost
[17:01] see but people have been trained in
[17:04] different ways
[17:05] so homeboy says humble Christians said
[17:08] they did not all their life had been
[17:10] taught against it so they walk away from
[17:12] it now they have got a group and the
[17:15] Lord has blessed them until they are
[17:17] coming in up into a big place now again
[17:20] with a church now that puts up about
[17:23] four or five thousand people
[17:26] see what homeowners will do
[17:28] to humble yourself
[17:30] you know not have anything against
[17:32] government and gifts and be complaining
[17:36] but just to follow
[17:40] the leader the ministry and they are
[17:43] studying all over
[17:44] so we sit right here that Jesus
[17:48] taught us in this verses that we read
[17:50] that we need to submit to the father
[17:53] uh we also need to be humbling like he
[17:57] was humble unto death
[18:02] the really
[18:04] you got two choices tonight
[18:07] Jesus had two choices
[18:10] you can choose between being humble or
[18:13] being humbled
[18:17] Jesus knew that
[18:19] he had a choice he went to the Cross he
[18:21] said father can we have some other way
[18:23] to that I had to go to the Cross this
[18:25] cup will pass away me he he was human
[18:28] and he had choice
[18:30] but what he chose
[18:33] he said nevertheless
[18:35] let's do your will
[18:37] because if you're a Christian fill with
[18:39] the Holy Ghost and God has called you
[18:41] and failed you and you are sailed
[18:43] listen either you humble or you will be
[18:46] my humble
[18:48] and I don't want to be humble by force
[18:51] my desire is to humble myself because he
[18:53] wants me to be humble I want to be
[18:55] humble I don't want to be pressure I
[18:57] don't want to be pushed into being
[18:59] something
[19:01] I want I want to desire my heart to be
[19:04] that way like Jesus was
[19:06] so that's the only two choices you have
[19:08] if you're a real Christian
[19:09] you ain't got no way out of this
[19:13] somebody's well
[19:15] let's go the easy way all right let's
[19:17] let's do it oh you're gonna be
[19:19] you know
[19:21] or you call that word in Spanish that's
[19:24] a bad word though in Mexico but they
[19:27] drag you by the legs you know the other
[19:30] one got to drag you
[19:32] you don't want to be under his Wrath you
[19:36] want to be under his law because when he
[19:39] discipline you he will discipline not
[19:42] his children
[19:43] he will do a love
[19:45] and he knows what's best for you
[19:47] so whatever he do I I trust God
[19:51] I have confidence in God I don't care
[19:53] how body looks like see I'm not trying
[19:56] to figure it out and do this and do it
[19:58] because you know what I I do that a lot
[20:00] lately
[20:01] you know if I had to decide before I
[20:04] tell you lately before if I want to
[20:06] decide what part of my life I wanted to
[20:07] live is right now
[20:09] from 25 to 100 if I make it to 100. I
[20:13] don't want the 18 to 25 or 25 to 40
[20:16] because you know I was a teenager on
[20:19] rebellious and then I have family and I
[20:22] had to find a job and I had a career and
[20:24] I had to bring a family but if I had to
[20:27] decide what part I wanted to live and
[20:29] serve the Lord is this one right now
[20:31] because I'm a little wiser
[20:34] I understand more
[20:36] I know more
[20:38] so for me now I I understand more than I
[20:41] used when I used to be a teenager
[20:44] so As I Grew you know I learned I am
[20:48] very seasoned earlier
[20:50] why but it wasn't something that was
[20:52] handed to me
[20:54] this is what life taught me
[20:56] so I'm more better not to handle things
[21:00] that come to me than what I was a
[21:02] teenager so if I had to live a life this
[21:04] is the one for God I like to live my
[21:06] last 25 years someone I want to live the
[21:08] whole thing but
[21:10] if I want a servant truly and get in
[21:12] there will be my last 25 years if I can
[21:15] make it that far
[21:16] so Christ he says
[21:20] oh I lost my okay
[21:24] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[21:25] and forever only thing he could do now
[21:28] he might do like he did when he was here
[21:30] in Earth
[21:31] because
[21:33] the Bible says he's the same yesterday
[21:35] today and tomorrow
[21:37] so whatever he did yesterday he will do
[21:40] today in you
[21:41] he cannot change that
[21:43] you have to come the same way he came he
[21:46] says it is right is that right and when
[21:49] he was on Earth he did claim he did not
[21:52] claim to to be a great person
[21:55] see because the Way Up Is Down
[22:00] and if you want to be great he will
[22:02] abase you it will degrade you
[22:04] you know when you put people in pedestal
[22:06] don't do that God will bring him down
[22:09] because Jesus never did
[22:12] see he says
[22:15] and and when he was on Earth he did
[22:17] claim he did not claim to be any great
[22:19] person he just preached the gospel he
[22:22] dressed like the other bands
[22:24] went along just like make and humble
[22:29] so most of the time they didn't even
[22:31] know he was in the house
[22:33] because he never
[22:35] put attention to himself or brought
[22:37] attention to himself
[22:39] well I'm here I'm a bishop so and so
[22:41] don't take so and so you know
[22:44] in fact
[22:47] he tried not to be noticed
[22:51] see
[22:52] so just preach the gospel
[22:54] now
[22:56] Hebrew chapter 2 57 8 25 say Christ
[23:00] begin his work
[23:02] what did he do
[23:04] what washing how to Humble lowly
[23:09] how he was not a great northern man as a
[23:12] theologian
[23:13] but he was humble make gentle he wasn't
[23:17] a mighty preacher I'm glad he put that
[23:19] there because
[23:22] I'm not a mighty preacher in fact I
[23:24] don't know how to preach
[23:25] his voice wasn't heard in the street he
[23:28] wasn't blowing trumpets and coming
[23:31] you know he's come he comes out the the
[23:34] the main guy you know without me you are
[23:36] nothing no
[23:37] he humble himself
[23:40] and he did not too you know he just here
[23:43] I am
[23:45] and that's one of the things that we're
[23:46] going to start learning what do we what
[23:49] do we expect or what qualities or
[23:51] character to be humble is you don't
[23:53] bring attention to yourself
[23:57] at least to start with
[23:59] no
[24:02] and God could next one everlasting life
[24:04] he says and God could ever get a man and
[24:07] a woman today in this Tabernacle
[24:09] anywhere else that it will pay no
[24:12] attention to what's going on around them
[24:16] see sometimes we like to compare
[24:18] ourselves with somebody else you know
[24:21] but submit themselves to the Lord as an
[24:23] individual unit he says God will lead
[24:27] with the same man today that he let he
[24:31] let them
[24:32] so what he did yesterday he will do
[24:34] today
[24:36] God will not change the program
[24:38] see God gave us a message and the
[24:41] message is supposed to be the address
[24:44] see you cannot add to the Dress well um
[24:49] heavy here let me like something out or
[24:52] oh I'm too skinny let me put no
[24:55] you might might as well either gain
[24:56] weight or lose weight to feed the
[24:58] Garment but you cannot alter the Garment
[25:02] okay
[25:04] he proved that he
[25:06] he is with us
[25:08] what we need today is humble submitted
[25:11] lives submit yourself don't squeeze
[25:14] yourself back
[25:16] so throw yourself out by saying another
[25:19] place take yourself and throw yourself
[25:21] out
[25:23] don't bring it back this guy is dead
[25:25] don't exclusive back in you
[25:28] that's why he's being empty yourself
[25:30] take that guy and forget him keep him
[25:33] down
[25:34] don't let him rise up
[25:36] so meet yourself don't squeeze yourself
[25:38] back into it don't do nothing but lay it
[25:42] straight with the Holy Ghost with the
[25:44] Holy Spirit what the spirit says do do
[25:47] quickly
[25:48] don't say well I'll wait and find out
[25:50] what this is and that is what the holy
[25:54] spirit says do
[25:56] go and do it see I am in that
[25:59] you know part of my life that I had to
[26:02] learn
[26:03] not just learning easy learning I was I
[26:08] was tested and I went through a lot of
[26:10] things but I know now that when he speak
[26:13] I do
[26:14] because I know what happened when I
[26:16] didn't I tried one time it didn't work
[26:19] good for me
[26:21] so that means you have to be in tune
[26:23] with the Holy Spirit you have to be
[26:25] prayed you have to read every day you
[26:27] have to walk in the spirit you know you
[26:30] had to find him every day
[26:34] you don't have every Sunday every
[26:36] Wednesday this is an everyday walk it's
[26:38] a journey
[26:39] so you cannot just you know forget about
[26:42] him all week and then when you have
[26:43] trouble then find them it's just don't
[26:45] work that way
[26:47] we go from experience to Spirit and from
[26:50] glory to glory and the more you know him
[26:52] the more you experience God the more you
[26:54] can trust them and that takes a lifetime
[26:58] because God is not going to reveal to
[27:00] you everything at one point that's a
[27:02] journey
[27:03] some people like to think you know they
[27:06] have this mentality well they focus on
[27:09] the end result
[27:10] I wanted to get out of here and waiting
[27:12] for a change to our body but what they
[27:15] don't understand is
[27:16] that the process is just as important as
[27:19] a result the journey is just as
[27:22] important as the result because without
[27:24] the journey without the process you
[27:26] don't have no results but some people
[27:28] like to focus to the Future and to the
[27:30] result
[27:31] this is what I'm going to be this is
[27:33] what God is going to do for me but what
[27:35] he's doing right now
[27:37] because if you skip the process
[27:40] you will never make the results
[27:44] and God is trying you God is testing you
[27:46] every day that's part of the process
[27:49] to humble yourself so you can die to
[27:51] yourself we can die to ourselves
[27:53] so we can when we get there you know
[27:56] we know where we're going we know the
[27:59] end result we just have to you know
[28:02] submit ourselves surrender ourselves to
[28:04] God so that can become a reality
[28:07] keep our eyes in the vision
[28:11] Matthew 23 11 12 says
[28:14] but he that is greater among you shall
[28:17] be your your servant
[28:19] so that's part of being humble not
[28:21] equality
[28:23] brother said be humble let yourself be
[28:25] the Lords of all
[28:28] do you want to be the first
[28:30] be the last
[28:32] you want to be the one that know it all
[28:35] make yourself stupid dumb
[28:39] you know sometimes I was thinking I'm
[28:41] afraid in this I got brothers that talk
[28:44] to me you know once a week or whatever I
[28:46] see him and they tell me the same story
[28:48] again they forget that they told me the
[28:50] story and I heard I don't know how many
[28:51] times
[28:52] but when they tell me that I I don't
[28:54] tell them you know how many times you're
[28:56] gonna tell me that story you know
[28:59] oh you know I don't want to make him
[29:01] feel bad I don't want them to you know
[29:03] not intentionally so so I said well I
[29:07] put the face like
[29:09] um maybe I did maybe I know but they
[29:12] tell me the story and I do the same
[29:14] thing I will laugh on the point to laugh
[29:16] I will say hi yeah I'm surprised
[29:19] because it is not about me I want the
[29:22] brother to feel good
[29:24] you know it's all about the other person
[29:28] it's not about me being great
[29:30] that's why brother brother everybody
[29:32] loved brother Branham because brother
[29:34] brother make the person feel
[29:36] better horror of themselves than than
[29:39] brother himself
[29:41] to that point
[29:43] that the other person
[29:46] you know he made him feel like he was
[29:48] somebody
[29:50] he says humble yourself God will feed
[29:54] lift you up don't figure that God owes
[29:57] you anything
[29:58] remember you owe him all
[30:03] in verse 12 of uh Matthew says and
[30:08] whosoever I mean I'm sorry uh Matthew 23
[30:10] 12. and whosoever shall assault in such
[30:13] a beer base see brought down
[30:16] and he died and he that shall humble
[30:19] himself shall be what
[30:20] exalted
[30:23] brother said but we must
[30:25] all come in one way
[30:28] there's no two different door no number
[30:31] one the number two number three no
[30:33] that's just one door and that is the
[30:36] straight and narrow way
[30:39] and we all gonna have to come through
[30:41] that
[30:43] but we must come to one way does come
[30:46] knowing that we are nothing
[30:48] and he is all
[30:50] see I've been willing to surrender
[30:52] ourselves to him in order to receive
[30:54] benefit from him
[30:56] if we think we are something God cannot
[30:58] use you
[31:00] I don't care how effective you are how
[31:02] many skill you have how good you are
[31:04] that kind of used you
[31:06] know you have to just become nothing
[31:10] and if you something is for the grace of
[31:12] God that we are what we are but he gets
[31:15] all the credit he gets all the glory and
[31:17] honor
[31:20] I'm so glad that he chose me
[31:24] but Allah says I have nothing to do with
[31:26] this
[31:26] he shows me and I'm glad he showed me
[31:29] because I wouldn't chose him myself
[31:32] somebody asked me hey what do you want
[31:33] to join us of sobriety or whatever he
[31:36] was or a club or something I said if you
[31:38] knew me
[31:40] you know I wouldn't even choose myself
[31:42] to go into just you know if you knew who
[31:44] I am you would not do that
[31:46] but
[31:47] I'm glad that God made all that
[31:50] good for me he cleansing me he saved me
[31:53] he cleansed me he filled me
[31:55] and that life is gone now I am somebody
[32:00] but I am somebody because him
[32:03] before I was a nobody thinking that I
[32:05] was somebody
[32:08] you know pretending to be somebody oh
[32:10] happy don't tell me you didn't okay put
[32:12] your Halos down don't tell me that you
[32:14] never pretended
[32:16] uh see you guys want to have your first
[32:19] girlfriend you pretended
[32:22] I tell a joke you know I'm gonna tell a
[32:24] joke and I'm supposed to joke in the
[32:25] puppy but when I met my wife you know I
[32:28] picked in there that I was rich
[32:31] I bought him a car you got a down
[32:33] payment for car and all that I was
[32:35] trying to impress her
[32:37] then I thought well you know
[32:41] later on she found out that I didn't
[32:43] have no money
[32:45] so let's leave it there because you
[32:46] don't want to know the rest
[32:49] so it says then when you humble yourself
[32:52] down God will insult you but when you
[32:54] assault yourself God will see that you
[32:56] are brought a base degraded humiliate it
[33:00] be leader demeanor
[33:03] so see I don't want I don't have
[33:05] anything
[33:06] to do that anyway
[33:09] Peter says humble yourself
[33:11] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[33:13] that he may assault you in due time
[33:16] the image of Christ says do you really
[33:18] mean that say Amen congregation say Amen
[33:21] now it's in that sweet spirit I do not
[33:25] have it that anything I know in the
[33:29] world you can take all the rest of the
[33:31] world and the fancies and the
[33:34] intellectuals all your doctors rabbis
[33:36] Bishop holy fathers Just Give Me Jesus
[33:40] that's right just let me have him that
[33:43] old-fashioned way I feel him way down in
[33:46] my heart and watching my life see he
[33:49] keep track of his life and see my
[33:51] desires is to serve him
[33:53] so if he's another desire tonight not to
[33:56] serve him then let this sum in our life
[33:58] that should be our only concern
[34:01] is to serve him
[34:04] he said meek
[34:06] to serve him humble make a lonely that's
[34:09] what we need friends
[34:11] that's Jesus that's the Jesus of the
[34:14] Bible not the Jesus of the intellect but
[34:16] the Jesus of the Soul
[34:18] if God is in my soul
[34:21] I live like
[34:22] healing
[34:24] you know if
[34:26] they said brother says if you have the
[34:28] spirit over time you do what
[34:31] you do what Beethoven did if you have
[34:33] the the spirit of the cowboy they're in
[34:36] jail whoever cardboard you like you will
[34:39] go to shooting you know robbing banks
[34:41] whatever but if you have the spirit of
[34:43] God in you
[34:45] that's what you do
[34:47] you manifest his life
[34:49] because with the spirit of him lives in
[34:51] us so if our life is not producing that
[34:54] there's something wrong
[34:57] it has to reproduce Christ in us the
[35:00] hope of glory of glorification
[35:03] so if it's not we need to
[35:05] then surrender maybe a little bit more
[35:07] be more sincere
[35:09] try to be more humble
[35:12] so the Bible says sometimes John the
[35:15] Baptist says I had to decrease so he can
[35:18] what
[35:19] increase
[35:21] so the lower you go the heart he will
[35:24] assault you
[35:26] the Lord the the the the Lord you go and
[35:28] you make yourself nothing you will make
[35:31] something
[35:33] see the Way Up Is Down
[35:36] so John says Ah to decrease your flesh
[35:39] actually increase your liking your
[35:40] desire your ideas your opinions you have
[35:44] to let all that God and the whole
[35:46] journey is to do that God is shipping
[35:49] away all that that is not him so him can
[35:52] appear so the more he chips the more you
[35:56] see
[35:57] his glory see and as a minister
[36:01] that's what I'm trying to emphasize
[36:03] tonight the importance of being humble
[36:06] humility is important
[36:08] but also
[36:09] the fact that
[36:11] being humble is a character
[36:15] is a character and it's a character
[36:17] trait and you cannot live via without
[36:19] the right character in fact the only
[36:21] reason you you hear because you're
[36:23] trying to get that character
[36:26] the character of Christ
[36:28] so hombolis is a character trait
[36:31] and if Jesus had to have it from the
[36:33] beginning to the end until death until
[36:36] this thing dies completely physically
[36:38] and spiritually discarded
[36:41] you know and become humble
[36:43] we are not going to live here
[36:46] until the work is done but I'm glad that
[36:47] he promised me I he says he started the
[36:51] work and he was what he will finish it
[36:55] so is that on me
[36:57] or me is to humble myself and let us
[37:00] finish the word that he started on me
[37:02] see Paul at one point he was bunking
[37:05] against the prick you know
[37:07] until God had to say I'm going to just
[37:09] stop
[37:10] the more you do that the more you hurt
[37:12] yourself
[37:13] you're not getting anywhere anyway
[37:15] but did you surrender your life to me
[37:17] then we can work together we can do
[37:19] something
[37:20] but that's one time we find ourselves
[37:22] just walking again the you know the word
[37:26] what we need to do just let go and let
[37:28] God and surrender our life or whatever
[37:30] he said do do yeah
[37:32] and you receive the glory of God God
[37:34] will do for you because God cannot lie
[37:37] if he promised you that he's going to do
[37:39] something and you do something he will
[37:41] do it
[37:43] you need healing just be humble and come
[37:46] to him humble and tell him you know I am
[37:48] nothing I don't know what else to do
[37:51] but you told me you know that you will
[37:54] heal me
[37:56] and he said if you ask
[37:58] you will answer see God will not lie to
[38:00] you I'm gonna when you come to me and
[38:02] you ask I will answer it's not going to
[38:05] be quiet he might you don't mind you
[38:07] maybe don't like his answer but he will
[38:09] answer you
[38:11] it says
[38:13] so I want to quickly let me see what
[38:15] time I have I don't know what's okay
[38:17] quickly I want to give you some
[38:19] qualities or characteristics what a
[38:22] humble Christian is see
[38:25] so you can look at them we're going to
[38:27] use the Bible on the message
[38:29] and see how many you have and how many
[38:31] you lacking
[38:32] I cannot cover them all but I'm gonna
[38:34] give you a a taste
[38:37] of what a humble person would do
[38:40] the first one is they lead
[38:43] to serve or they live to serve
[38:47] see um in Galatians 5 13 are you there
[38:50] says Brethren you have been called into
[38:53] Liberty
[38:54] only use the liberty for an occasion
[38:58] for not for on a not Liberty for an
[39:01] occasion to the flesh but by law sir one
[39:05] another
[39:09] so serve what one another
[39:13] and don't use the Liberty don't use your
[39:16] position to an advantage well I'm gonna
[39:18] love this guy and this guy because they
[39:20] love me but and then you gotta click now
[39:22] see
[39:23] that's taking the Liberty that you have
[39:25] in God for your honor banished maybe you
[39:27] want to be with this on this one because
[39:28] she got certain you know brother deals
[39:31] that you want to do and you know this
[39:32] one is poor and this one is you know it
[39:35] shouldn't have been that way we should
[39:37] we should treat everybody the same
[39:39] see that's the first train
[39:42] we are here to serve one another serve
[39:45] God and serve the body
[39:48] Galatians 5 14 for all the law is
[39:50] fulfilling one word even in this thou
[39:52] shall love thy neighbor as thyself
[39:55] so if you love your neighbor or thyself
[39:57] who is my neighbor or anybody that cross
[39:59] your path
[40:00] so if you love your neighbor you're
[40:02] going to love your neighbor the way you
[40:04] like to be loved right
[40:05] do you like pain
[40:07] suffering
[40:09] you like people to mistreat you and use
[40:11] you or Force you accuse you but don't do
[40:13] that
[40:14] because you need to love in the way you
[40:16] like to be loved
[40:18] three people the way you like to be
[40:19] treated
[40:21] be kind
[40:23] even if they're not kind to you because
[40:25] you still want them to treat each other
[40:27] way how they're going to know all
[40:28] education
[40:30] you are the teacher you know the truth
[40:33] so love thy neighborhood thyself brother
[40:36] says you know people want Power
[40:39] and really they don't know what power is
[40:44] they really don't know what goes with it
[40:47] see they don't know what they're asking
[40:49] for because power with a character is
[40:51] evil
[40:53] brother Brown said the Way Up Is Down
[40:55] always if you want Power see how humble
[41:00] can you get
[41:05] just get away from all your worldly
[41:08] thinking and humble yourself before God
[41:10] and then you got got more power see we
[41:14] want more power
[41:15] you know the power is in the tone the
[41:18] Bible says
[41:19] you know you can
[41:21] do good or bad evil or good
[41:25] because power is in there
[41:27] so the words that you're saying
[41:30] can do a lot of damage you can do a lot
[41:32] of good so when you see each other the
[41:34] Bible say edify one another
[41:37] say the things that are gonna identify
[41:39] somebody else I don't care you don't
[41:40] feel good and then every time they ask
[41:42] me how you doing brother I said I'm
[41:44] doing I'm doing good in fact I'm doing
[41:46] better than you
[41:48] and they start thinking that's what I
[41:50] want them to think
[41:51] I said I'm doing better at 73 that
[41:53] you're doing a 50.
[41:55] when you make it to 72 we can argue that
[41:57] but I will be way up there away from you
[42:01] so I want to see people that are
[42:03] struggling sometimes either the sick or
[42:06] anything and they and I see him in
[42:08] church and I say hi
[42:10] I don't tell him well you sure look bad
[42:13] you should stay home
[42:16] I don't need I don't I don't need you
[42:18] just no I tell him first thing I see him
[42:21] I said wow you look good today
[42:24] and I had done that and I'm making this
[42:26] up and the brother looked at me like wow
[42:29] you're the first one
[42:31] everybody that saw me today he was in
[42:34] the door and there was his way home
[42:35] everybody just looked at him and said go
[42:36] home
[42:37] I said but no you look good
[42:40] and then he kind of got a little energy
[42:42] he kind of and then went into the
[42:45] service
[42:46] he felt better your words carry a lot of
[42:49] power
[42:50] and if you want to edify somebody you
[42:53] know let the spirit lead you
[42:57] you know what you look like had nothing
[42:59] to do with anything
[43:01] your situation had nothing to do with
[43:03] anything that's the problem we look to
[43:04] most other situation we look at uh the
[43:07] body messages you know body languages
[43:10] but see you got the power to change all
[43:13] that in fact you have the power to
[43:15] change the armor fear in this service if
[43:17] you want to
[43:18] you got power in your tongue right now
[43:21] to change the atmosphere that's when you
[43:22] come to church you should praise the
[43:25] Lord and you should worship God because
[43:27] when you change that atmosphere the
[43:29] Bible said that he dwells in the
[43:31] presence of his people so if we come
[43:34] with the right attitude with the right
[43:35] mental attitude with the right mindset
[43:38] you can change
[43:40] this service can fall or can rise depend
[43:43] just to take one person in the wrong
[43:45] mindset
[43:46] worrying about whatever they worry about
[43:49] well I gotta go to Walmart or after
[43:51] Churchill
[43:53] thank you brother because I know some
[43:56] people out there here but their money is
[43:57] in Walmart
[43:59] or they're thinking about the beans that
[44:01] are burning at home you know
[44:03] I hope this bridge will get done because
[44:04] I you know we're going to lunch and
[44:06] we're going to do this
[44:09] with us when Sunday used to come my
[44:12] children never asked me what were you
[44:13] doing
[44:14] number one rule in my home Sunday is for
[44:18] the Lord I mean every day is a robot
[44:20] Sunday
[44:21] I did not schedule anything on Sundays
[44:25] because I didn't want nothing in between
[44:26] me and God I gotta hurry up get out of
[44:29] the Church Road to whatever party or
[44:31] whatever
[44:32] you want to do park or have fun then run
[44:35] back to church no
[44:37] no function the only function that I
[44:39] have was God
[44:42] and that's what they learned my children
[44:44] learn
[44:45] listen I'm not rich
[44:47] I'm not poor neither but I don't have
[44:49] big million dollars
[44:52] to leave my children reaches or
[44:54] properties but one thing I wanted to
[44:56] leave them
[44:57] is the Legacy
[45:00] of a man
[45:01] the leaf of God the love God
[45:03] I want them to see that in my life
[45:06] see you are a God to your children's
[45:10] let me tell you what
[45:12] you can tell him what to do or not to do
[45:14] but they're not watching what you're
[45:15] saying they're watching what you're
[45:17] doing
[45:18] because they don't understand what
[45:20] you're saying but that Washington says
[45:21] but that why are you telling me that
[45:22] you're doing it
[45:24] see because the you are the God and if
[45:26] you're going to preach make sure you
[45:28] line up with the word
[45:29] because it's in vain
[45:32] so always you want Power see
[45:36] get away from worldly things humble
[45:39] yourself in fact
[45:41] when I when I came in the Lord brought
[45:43] me into this message back in 1990 89.
[45:47] uh I lost family
[45:49] I used to get with them together for
[45:51] Christmas and presents and Easter you
[45:55] know I was just you know I was a good
[45:57] Baptist anyway
[45:59] and I used to do all that stuff
[46:02] um birthdays and whatever we celebrate
[46:04] we go to the park when this message came
[46:07] uh they schedule everything on Sundays I
[46:11] don't know why people do Sundays on
[46:12] Saturdays
[46:14] so I told them you know don't invite me
[46:16] and if they do you know I'm not going to
[46:18] go because I already know what I'm going
[46:20] to be a Sundays and I lost a lot of
[46:22] family
[46:22] now last time that they but they didn't
[46:25] bother me anymore and I didn't go
[46:27] anymore because I said you want to do
[46:29] something you want me to go do it on
[46:30] Friday or something but not on Saturday
[46:32] even if a family come from out of town
[46:35] to my house
[46:36] you know if they don't want to come to
[46:38] church I said well you're still here and
[46:40] he's here's this book or whatever watch
[46:41] whatever and I'm going to church
[46:44] no because my God is first
[46:48] family is second
[46:52] and church
[46:54] it's less
[46:56] because if you love family you love
[46:58] family
[47:00] you are family We Are Family
[47:03] amen well let me get off that says God I
[47:06] want you got more power than man
[47:09] that runs all over the building
[47:11] and makes a big lot of noisy because you
[47:15] have
[47:16] been over the been to conquer yourself
[47:18] and commit yourself to Christ see you
[47:20] have to conquer I'm not your enemy you
[47:22] need to conquer yourself listen we are
[47:25] here to overcome not overcome the
[47:27] preacher
[47:28] you need to overcome your own flesh and
[47:31] before you try to overcome me why don't
[47:33] you overcome yourself before you want to
[47:35] take that being that is in mind or that
[47:37] stick or whatever in my eye take that
[47:40] being that is in yours
[47:42] see overcome yourself first
[47:46] that's what you're here for because you
[47:48] have it over the conquered yourself and
[47:50] commit yourself to Christ to humble
[47:52] yourself before him that is really power
[47:55] so you want Power tonight
[47:58] you need to been nothing nobody whatever
[48:01] he says to do do
[48:03] you know you know you show my church
[48:06] that is humble and I believe this church
[48:08] is humble that's what I'm bringing this
[48:10] anyway
[48:12] real humble not an arrogant church just
[48:15] a sweet Humble Church and I believe that
[48:18] you made me feel wanted you made me feel
[48:21] like I'm part of the group
[48:23] you know and it makes me then
[48:25] participate and do things I do it's
[48:27] because you made me see it is you making
[48:29] me feel that way
[48:31] see on that church I I will say it all
[48:35] the time
[48:36] you are a very humble church and that's
[48:38] because your pastor
[48:39] because you don't get that well that you
[48:41] get a teaching from it and tell you what
[48:43] to do
[48:44] see because you have been over the to
[48:47] Congress that you show me a church
[48:49] that's humble real humble not arrogant
[48:52] church just a sweet home of church and I
[48:55] will show you a church that has the
[48:57] favor and power of God
[49:01] see that's right that's the thing it
[49:04] takes humility
[49:05] humbling yourself before God and letting
[49:08] God just work through you
[49:12] because let me tell you what it's not
[49:13] you it is him working through you that
[49:16] make you who you are to begin with so we
[49:19] surrender to him he will make what he
[49:22] wants of us
[49:24] you know the only place people are there
[49:26] going to see God is in you but the Bible
[49:28] says that's the only place they're going
[49:30] to see it
[49:31] and if they're going to see Jesus again
[49:33] in Earth it has to be the same Jesus
[49:35] yesterday and today and forever Jesus
[49:37] was humble
[49:39] Jesus was slowly
[49:41] he says
[49:43] uh forever but that's right that's the
[49:46] thing it takes humility
[49:48] but it's so hard it's easy to say but I
[49:51] know I'm human I know how that works
[49:53] humbling yourself also before God and
[49:56] letting God just work through us don't
[49:58] have to make a lot of noise
[50:01] you know
[50:03] agree a Christian
[50:05] don't don't let the left know what the
[50:07] right is doing
[50:08] in fact
[50:10] you do things for other people and you
[50:12] don't blow trumpet
[50:13] in fact nobody know who did that to that
[50:16] person
[50:16] because nobody's taking credit oh I did
[50:19] you know what I did no
[50:21] you do things on the quietly nobody
[50:24] knows
[50:25] but if you try to you know do it so
[50:29] people can you know say that you're good
[50:32] and you give him then you die that's not
[50:34] the purpose in fact whatever you do
[50:37] don't let your left hand know what your
[50:39] right hands is doing
[50:41] second to have a reserve they have an
[50:45] inner stream second Corinthians people
[50:47] that are humble they have an inner
[50:49] strength therefore I take
[50:51] pleasure pleasure what's wrong with you
[50:54] Paul
[50:55] I take pleasure in infirmities
[50:59] it says
[51:01] and reproaches
[51:03] are you going to be happy when people
[51:05] mistreat you and kick you and they did
[51:07] all things to this you know to Paul
[51:10] he says in necessities
[51:13] in persecution in distress for Christ's
[51:18] sake for when I am weak
[51:21] he is strong so next time we get to a
[51:25] situation that we look like God there's
[51:27] no way out
[51:28] oh I don't know what God is doing this
[51:30] praise the Lord because the Lord is
[51:33] doing something in your life
[51:35] you know when you are weak it's when
[51:37] you're strong
[51:39] that's the mentality
[51:41] it's not the other way around but how do
[51:44] you feel brother about I don't know I
[51:45] feel bad well good because it's your
[51:48] strength
[51:49] he is just strength
[51:52] so when you're going through things and
[51:54] he led his sickness and the disease and
[51:57] this happened to you if you're a real
[51:59] Christian humble Christian you don't
[52:02] complain about it you said Thank You
[52:03] Lord
[52:04] you know I don't have no strength anyway
[52:06] in fact trying to stand in this Pulpit
[52:09] if it wasn't for his strength I will be
[52:11] probably sitting just like you guys
[52:14] because
[52:15] if I start thinking that I can do
[52:18] something for God that was the end of my
[52:19] the ministry
[52:21] because I had nothing to offer the only
[52:23] thing I had to offer is nothing we come
[52:26] to God offer nothing if you can offer
[52:28] something to God then there's not Christ
[52:30] anymore it's not it's you and Christ and
[52:33] it's not your crisis him only
[52:35] so therefore we know we take pleasure
[52:40] wow every time you have a pain every
[52:42] time you have suffering every time you
[52:43] have a situation you're supposed to
[52:44] rejoice
[52:46] Paul that's what Peter says
[52:48] intestine in in in everything rejoice
[52:53] sing a song
[52:55] you know why because God is doing
[52:57] something in your life
[52:59] now humble thyself brother Brown says
[53:02] look at Jesus nothing but one bundle or
[53:05] what
[53:06] a love
[53:08] you know what what you do what happened
[53:10] when you take a rose and you squeeze it
[53:13] hmm
[53:14] you kind of smell the fragrance
[53:17] see the more just squeeze it the more
[53:18] the fragrance comes out
[53:20] see
[53:21] and that's what happened to us the more
[53:23] the world squeeze us the more God let
[53:26] squeezing come
[53:28] love should come out
[53:31] see
[53:33] if something has come out you retaliate
[53:36] and you want to get even
[53:38] that's not being humble
[53:40] in fact the more they squeeze God the
[53:42] more he loved the people in the cross
[53:44] yeah dying he said forgive them
[53:47] they don't know what they're doing
[53:49] and he didn't open his mouth
[53:51] I mean some of us we I'm gonna get even
[53:53] I'm Gonna Get You Back
[53:55] you know no humbleness means that you
[53:59] have to suffer
[54:00] let his suffer
[54:02] see
[54:03] that is the only way you can be obedient
[54:06] you know that
[54:07] by his suffering he learned what
[54:10] obedience and I said to myself what did
[54:13] Jesus have to learn obedience is God in
[54:15] flesh
[54:16] but this is what that means
[54:19] you don't have to be a disobedient
[54:22] son to learn obedience in fact you don't
[54:25] have to do something wrong to learn
[54:26] what's right
[54:28] what you have to do do what is right
[54:31] even if you
[54:33] think it's right or wrong doesn't matter
[54:36] Jesus did everything right and he proved
[54:38] that he was obedience
[54:40] see you don't have to experience life so
[54:42] you can become you know like me I have
[54:45] to I experience life I did many things
[54:47] so I can find out that we're wrong not
[54:49] when your parties tell you you're that
[54:52] strong don't do it your obedience and
[54:54] you don't do it and that countless or
[54:56] obedience
[54:57] you know how to experience what people
[55:00] have experienced like me in this message
[55:02] to know how God the love of God or to
[55:07] know how good he is
[55:08] you can do his will all the way be
[55:12] obedience and you will be a bundle of
[55:15] love just wait he said
[55:17] nothing but a bundle of love he was God
[55:20] manifested if God Express himself to us
[55:24] a God is present himself to us no one
[55:27] the Miracles and things happen just
[55:29] humble lies and consequent in life that
[55:32] come from just from being God to be a
[55:36] man you know just to express God through
[55:39] himself
[55:40] that's what made him what he was
[55:43] you get it you just God is praising
[55:45] himself
[55:46] to the flesh
[55:49] say he he what he was always said that
[55:53] may Jesus God to me was the way he
[55:56] humbled himself he was so great
[55:59] and yet became
[56:01] so small
[56:05] so being humble a humble person
[56:09] that is it's not a sign of weakness
[56:13] being a homo person is not a sign of
[56:15] powerless
[56:18] but it's a great
[56:20] Inner Strength that comes from God see
[56:23] because when I'm weak he's strong that's
[56:25] what Paul is saying
[56:27] see three I gotta hurry up here
[56:31] three they admit their mistakes
[56:36] husbands and wife okay you need to learn
[56:38] how to say I'm sorry
[56:41] I'm not talking about somebody else just
[56:43] hold on somewhat sometimes confess your
[56:46] fault one another
[56:48] he didn't say confession
[56:51] confess your fault
[56:53] and pray for one
[56:55] another
[56:57] that you may be healed see the reason
[56:59] sometimes we don't get our healing is
[57:01] because we need to confess
[57:04] because it this is what he's telling me
[57:06] if you confess it's your fault to one
[57:08] another then you can be healed
[57:13] the effects of urban prayer with
[57:15] righteousness we know that one we like
[57:18] to quote that one but we let the other
[57:19] half that if you confess
[57:22] say I don't care if you do it
[57:24] intentionally
[57:25] or you do it because you want to do it
[57:27] if somebody's hurt because something you
[57:30] said it's not what you said it how he
[57:32] got it or how he perceived you said if
[57:34] he's offended that person that was not
[57:36] your intention you need to go make a
[57:38] right
[57:40] because a person that is humble cannot
[57:42] meet the mistakes I made many errors and
[57:45] I'm still making many mistakes
[57:47] but the key on it is to make it right
[57:50] but if I say when you come through those
[57:51] doors make sure your life is right make
[57:55] sure you make everything right make sure
[57:57] that you don't come to the store because
[57:58] he says it will be it will be pouring
[58:01] out it you know why
[58:04] it will come that day brother says that
[58:06] nothing will come through those doors
[58:09] but because it's not here we are not you
[58:12] know
[58:12] you know like
[58:14] Safara
[58:16] you know because we are not there yet
[58:17] and we're not seeing it in church I
[58:19] don't mean that it's not happening one
[58:21] of these days we might we need to make
[58:23] everything
[58:25] right before you come to the stores it's
[58:28] going to be called out
[58:29] how I don't know what is that's what he
[58:32] says
[58:33] so confess your thoughts before you do
[58:36] food washing before you turn the
[58:38] communion you know you need to make this
[58:39] try before you do that because it can be
[58:41] detriment to you instead of Health to
[58:44] you will be death to you that's what
[58:46] Paul said many of you are sleeping
[58:48] dead and sick why because you cannot
[58:51] discern the body
[58:53] so stay healthy
[58:56] just do what's right
[58:59] confess you're forced to one another
[59:03] and God will heal you brother says
[59:05] himself humble thyself I was thinking
[59:07] here one little illustration to back of
[59:11] what I'm saying he said now we look at
[59:13] this watch to find out what time it is
[59:16] unless
[59:18] that uh unless there that every
[59:21] instrument in that was any any part of
[59:23] that what she said
[59:25] it's coordinated
[59:27] one with another
[59:29] we will never know the correct time
[59:34] do you know what time we're leaving
[59:37] you know the times this is the time of
[59:39] redemption this is the time to go but
[59:41] you will never notice it because the
[59:43] only way you can notice that everything
[59:45] has to work like a clock right
[59:49] or you would not know what time it is
[59:51] we never know the correct time is that
[59:54] right and that takes all of us all
[59:56] together and that's what I saw last week
[59:59] you got to work all together
[1:00:02] if we want to see the purple ready to do
[1:00:05] something
[1:00:06] for God coordination with everyone of us
[1:00:10] together to Humble ourselves before God
[1:00:12] and confess are wrong and pray and
[1:00:15] believe God for these things
[1:00:19] see
[1:00:20] it's like a watch we all got parts
[1:00:23] some more some less
[1:00:25] but do you know what time we are leaving
[1:00:28] right now you know what's going in your
[1:00:30] church
[1:00:30] the only way you know that is when you
[1:00:32] see everything working together in one
[1:00:35] Accord in one unit
[1:00:36] then you see the power of God coming
[1:00:38] down now you know what's going on and
[1:00:41] you know where you are and you know
[1:00:42] what's happening but when they Discord
[1:00:44] what happens
[1:00:47] and the the parts of the watch are not
[1:00:49] working some parts are working so I'm
[1:00:51] not working you cannot tell what's going
[1:00:53] on it's confusion
[1:00:56] and like I said I can pray that this
[1:00:58] church is not confused you guys were not
[1:00:59] confused last week
[1:01:01] because you forgot about yourself and
[1:01:03] you started working as a union you
[1:01:05] started working for one another to get
[1:01:06] things right in fact you forgot
[1:01:08] everything about yourself that week you
[1:01:10] can do that at church the same way
[1:01:12] you do your part you work your part
[1:01:15] and then you can see the power of God
[1:01:16] coming down then you know what time you
[1:01:18] let you you live
[1:01:20] that's why some of the churches are so
[1:01:22] confused because everybody's pulling
[1:01:25] different ways and then the wash is not
[1:01:28] working time's not working they don't
[1:01:30] this is doing that she's doing that he's
[1:01:33] doing that the kids are doing that and
[1:01:35] people are confused you know well what
[1:01:37] we supposed to do
[1:01:39] but when we are in one mentality we want
[1:01:41] to call it one mindset with the word as
[1:01:44] his bridge then we know where we are we
[1:01:47] are not lost
[1:01:48] we know the presence of God is in this
[1:01:50] place we know where God is and we know
[1:01:53] what he's doing
[1:01:54] see chaos we don't like chaos God cannot
[1:02:00] move in chaos when everybody wants to do
[1:02:02] whatever they want that's chaos
[1:02:04] because everybody wants to pull their
[1:02:05] own way but what we need to come
[1:02:07] together humble us off
[1:02:10] and then bring the power of God down
[1:02:13] he's promised that he will do it
[1:02:16] amen he said
[1:02:18] the circle coordination for every one of
[1:02:21] us together to Humble ourselves before
[1:02:23] God says and four uh another
[1:02:26] characteristic another quality they seek
[1:02:29] input from others but you know what
[1:02:32] happened when you think you know it all
[1:02:35] right that's not being horrible what
[1:02:37] kind of home about myself because I know
[1:02:38] so much it's hard to Humble
[1:02:42] when you think you know it all you don't
[1:02:43] ask for help when you think you know it
[1:02:45] all you know ask for for inputs
[1:02:48] when you think you know oh you know you
[1:02:51] want to even rebuke or correct the
[1:02:53] pastor
[1:02:55] see I know the message and I read see
[1:02:57] and that's I'm saying I'm not making I
[1:02:59] know this happens in churches the people
[1:03:01] that get up and trying to strain out the
[1:03:03] pastor in fact there's some people that
[1:03:05] tend to strain the prophet tell him what
[1:03:09] he meant Oh this is what he meant
[1:03:11] you know
[1:03:12] so
[1:03:15] so what we what we well we are
[1:03:18] uh Escape so
[1:03:21] we we get input for mothers there the
[1:03:23] Bible said here in Proverbs 2 7 but not
[1:03:25] wise in our own eyes
[1:03:27] fear the lord
[1:03:29] and depart from Evil be not wife in
[1:03:32] their own eyes
[1:03:34] the person who is wise in his own eyes
[1:03:36] is rarely so in eyes of other people
[1:03:41] you see I don't care how who you are in
[1:03:45] the sense you can describe who you are
[1:03:46] but if I want to know who you are
[1:03:48] brother says you're going to know that
[1:03:50] Pastor look at the wife
[1:03:52] you want to know about how good is your
[1:03:54] husband ask her she's the one that knows
[1:03:59] sometimes you know
[1:04:01] the bus stop bubbles you know sometimes
[1:04:03] we way up there and the wife come and
[1:04:06] yeah we go back down to earth you know
[1:04:08] we believe to be something that we are
[1:04:10] not without to be you know
[1:04:12] and she sat there with her pain big pain
[1:04:16] and all they had air comes out
[1:04:19] you know
[1:04:21] you want to know what a man's belief
[1:04:23] look at the wife
[1:04:25] you want to know what a man believed and
[1:04:27] who he are what he are look at the
[1:04:29] children look at the family
[1:04:31] see
[1:04:33] so let's not be washing our own eyes you
[1:04:36] know
[1:04:37] I am interested what people said about
[1:04:39] me
[1:04:41] I'm not saying that you know I need
[1:04:43] people opinions
[1:04:45] but sometimes when we don't understand
[1:04:46] that sometimes people look at you and
[1:04:50] see what you're saying and see what
[1:04:52] you're doing
[1:04:53] see and if if you don't line up then
[1:04:56] something is wrong
[1:04:59] but the Brown says above all things it
[1:05:02] is our individual soul that we are
[1:05:04] responsible before God
[1:05:07] see it is you if you go there
[1:05:10] it is not whether I go or he goes it is
[1:05:16] you go in see you if you first and you
[1:05:20] have got to look to die and come sweet
[1:05:24] before the Lord and another
[1:05:26] is saying don't expect with someone else
[1:05:29] to start or doing it you need to start
[1:05:31] in your life
[1:05:32] well when I say uh all this thing
[1:05:34] happening in church I will jump in when
[1:05:36] I see that
[1:05:37] you know water trouble I jump in
[1:05:40] no why do you have to wait don't you
[1:05:43] want to be the first
[1:05:46] no I just wait to see what's going to
[1:05:48] happen with that thing then I join
[1:05:50] but if you don't go right I don't join
[1:05:52] well what kind of mentality is that
[1:05:55] we're working together we helping each
[1:05:58] other
[1:05:59] so
[1:06:00] you are responsible for yourself and you
[1:06:03] are first
[1:06:04] you have got to look to die and come
[1:06:06] sweet before the Lord and I have always
[1:06:09] found out that a man that humble himself
[1:06:11] is a man that God has drawn
[1:06:14] when you take a person that just
[1:06:17] checks out and know everything and you
[1:06:20] cannot tell him nothing at his arrogance
[1:06:23] see why that person that never gets
[1:06:26] anywhere but you take the person that
[1:06:28] humbles themselves
[1:06:30] and walk sweet sweetly so
[1:06:33] by humbling yourself the characteristics
[1:06:36] of not we I don't know at all I know a
[1:06:39] lot you know but I don't know at all
[1:06:42] and if a man tells me that law at all I
[1:06:44] stay away from him brother says if you
[1:06:46] find somebody that thinks he knows the
[1:06:47] Lost stay away from that man
[1:06:50] because they don't who I mean we just
[1:06:53] saw a finite our money so how can we
[1:06:56] know it all God is infinite how can we
[1:06:59] know everything about God or everything
[1:07:01] about anything
[1:07:02] see
[1:07:04] brother says here
[1:07:06] five
[1:07:08] he says they know themselves
[1:07:12] second Peter 3 18 says they they have a
[1:07:15] special Revelation who they are and what
[1:07:17] they are but girl in Grace and in
[1:07:20] knowledge of Our Lord Savior Jesus
[1:07:22] Christ to him glory both now and forever
[1:07:26] now the NIV says
[1:07:29] for who makes you different from one
[1:07:31] else
[1:07:32] First Corinthians 4 7 for who makes you
[1:07:35] different from one else what do you have
[1:07:38] to do
[1:07:39] you did not receive
[1:07:41] and if you did receive it why do you
[1:07:44] boast I thought you did not
[1:07:47] so see everything that we do everything
[1:07:50] that we come or will be come from God
[1:07:55] and if we come from God we cannot boast
[1:07:59] God don't share his glory with no one
[1:08:02] so if we said we receive it what do we
[1:08:05] both if we say we didn't receive it you
[1:08:08] know
[1:08:08] is is the same way the same thing now
[1:08:11] next thing is genuine
[1:08:14] they are genuine says Philippians 2 4
[1:08:18] don't look at out only for your own
[1:08:20] interest
[1:08:21] for for the interest
[1:08:23] in others
[1:08:27] humble people know how to The Importance
[1:08:29] of Being
[1:08:31] authentic see
[1:08:34] you gotta be the same person this is
[1:08:36] what I'm going to hit here because you
[1:08:37] have to be the same person that you are
[1:08:39] in church
[1:08:41] that you are at home
[1:08:43] that you are a school
[1:08:45] if not you're pretending
[1:08:47] if you a humble person you're a humble
[1:08:49] person wherever you go
[1:08:52] to everybody else
[1:08:55] to that lady in the Walmart that gave
[1:08:57] you the church chained you
[1:09:00] or the one that you know did something
[1:09:02] to you
[1:09:04] this is not just for believers only
[1:09:07] this is not for The Clique
[1:09:09] Jesus did not do that he was kind
[1:09:13] he loved
[1:09:14] he has no respect the person whoever
[1:09:17] they were
[1:09:18] and we had to do the same thing
[1:09:21] we had to be the same not all in private
[1:09:24] all but we had to be the same person
[1:09:25] when we're in church when we in public
[1:09:27] or in our personal life in a home uh in
[1:09:30] every situation
[1:09:32] and with every kind of person we should
[1:09:34] be the same
[1:09:35] if I wish you three people the same way
[1:09:38] we treat each other
[1:09:39] if we're not doing that we are
[1:09:42] pretending to be humble
[1:09:44] see brother Banner says humble that sir
[1:09:48] and they come to me and said brother
[1:09:50] Brandon said we went out there in the
[1:09:53] office the church office the other day
[1:09:55] and I said one of the leaders of the
[1:09:57] class and then said what what more what
[1:10:00] must we do and he said find a man to be
[1:10:03] the Shepherd that has no reputation
[1:10:06] I guess they were looking for pasture
[1:10:08] said no reputation
[1:10:11] I'm glad because I will fit that
[1:10:12] category nobody knows me
[1:10:15] when I travel a lot and here you are oh
[1:10:18] I'm Brothers also I never heard of you I
[1:10:20] said no because I don't have no
[1:10:22] reputation I've been living under the
[1:10:24] hotel or brother dog everybody dog
[1:10:26] brother the dog but I'm behind
[1:10:28] and I don't bring myself any reputation
[1:10:31] people don't and I try not to and I will
[1:10:34] not do it it says
[1:10:36] it's a find a Shepherd that has no
[1:10:39] reputation
[1:10:41] in in all denomination it's just a real
[1:10:45] good genuine sweet humble brother that
[1:10:47] live the life
[1:10:51] God will take care of the rest see
[1:10:55] a good pastor that just feed the sheep
[1:10:58] and the home and be humble and then God
[1:11:01] will do the rest
[1:11:03] not some big know it all coming and
[1:11:06] instead put this in order and this has
[1:11:09] to be this way turning things around I
[1:11:12] said I will never work or this will
[1:11:15] never work you just go to that's it
[1:11:17] first keep peace in the church just work
[1:11:20] together and you must keep up your part
[1:11:23] of it so we see what time we are living
[1:11:27] we may be closer than you think we are
[1:11:32] see seven quickly they treated they they
[1:11:37] treat others with respect that's a big
[1:11:40] one for me
[1:11:42] you know it doesn't matter who he is you
[1:11:45] should treat everybody with respect
[1:11:47] I don't care if it's a three-piece suit
[1:11:49] or is somebody in the overalls you
[1:11:52] should treat everybody the same way
[1:11:55] that's a sign of being humble for there
[1:11:58] is no respect of person with God and as
[1:12:01] you would that men should do to you do
[1:12:04] you also to them likewise
[1:12:06] see and humble people are consistent and
[1:12:09] disciplined in their treatment with
[1:12:11] others
[1:12:12] we got to be the same if not we are
[1:12:15] different
[1:12:17] so but the poetries be the same way and
[1:12:20] and you should see me the same way and
[1:12:22] we all should treat ourselves the same
[1:12:23] way
[1:12:24] but you don't you don't belong to the
[1:12:26] church it doesn't matter I belong to the
[1:12:27] body
[1:12:28] so you should treat people that are
[1:12:30] coming from other places even though
[1:12:32] they are not part of this assembly ask
[1:12:35] the word your brother and sister and
[1:12:37] accommodate and be lovely and you guys
[1:12:39] do you guys do
[1:12:41] uh with respect it says over here Romans
[1:12:45] 12 16 B of the same mining towards one
[1:12:48] another
[1:12:49] mind not high things but
[1:12:53] condensed condensed
[1:12:57] to Men of lost State be not wise in your
[1:13:01] own
[1:13:02] concede see
[1:13:04] live the New Living Translation live in
[1:13:07] harmony with each other don't be too
[1:13:10] proud to enjoy the company of Ordinary
[1:13:12] People
[1:13:14] and don't think you know at all
[1:13:18] you know sometimes
[1:13:21] people used to tell me in churches you
[1:13:23] know they always invite the same people
[1:13:25] to
[1:13:26] to the home to eat or to have parties so
[1:13:29] you know but always the same people then
[1:13:31] they complain that they don't have any
[1:13:32] friends I said well you don't have any
[1:13:34] friends because you don't show yourself
[1:13:35] friendly
[1:13:36] I said why don't you do something this
[1:13:38] year
[1:13:39] take this year and start and every
[1:13:42] Sunday or Wednesday check somebody else
[1:13:44] that you don't know
[1:13:46] you know fine and because you said to
[1:13:48] another family why they're saying people
[1:13:50] the same why don't you go around until
[1:13:53] but the end of the year you know who is
[1:13:55] in the service I know everybody and
[1:13:57] invite everybody
[1:13:59] my children used to tell me God you're
[1:14:02] always picking out this message homeless
[1:14:04] what are you bringing all these people
[1:14:05] home because I know how I feel when you
[1:14:08] go to a church and they ignore you for
[1:14:09] three or four years
[1:14:10] they don't even know you there
[1:14:13] big churches you get lost in big
[1:14:15] churches
[1:14:16] and I don't like that uh so everybody
[1:14:18] that came new to church I will introduce
[1:14:21] myself I don't care who they were
[1:14:23] I introduce myself I like to know you a
[1:14:25] little better would you like to have
[1:14:27] dinner with me and I used to take him
[1:14:28] home sometimes I have a home full of all
[1:14:31] kind of people my children say well you
[1:14:33] get well you invited every homeless
[1:14:34] people in church in this message
[1:14:36] I said yeah because I know how it is
[1:14:40] see I want to treat everybody the same
[1:14:42] way
[1:14:46] I know how it feels it took about three
[1:14:48] years you know and I went to the
[1:14:50] Tabernacle when I that was new nobody
[1:14:53] knew who I was nobody knew where I came
[1:14:54] from what happened to me just came and
[1:14:57] sat down and brought my family and I sat
[1:15:00] there about
[1:15:01] about three years later on the brother
[1:15:03] from the pope he says oh we have a
[1:15:06] family here a new family that's happened
[1:15:07] here three years
[1:15:09] not that I need a nourishment
[1:15:12] it just I took that long
[1:15:15] you know anyway brother Brown says we
[1:15:18] want to keep rolling smoothly sweetly in
[1:15:23] and in order of the Lord
[1:15:25] so just remember that your part may be
[1:15:28] the main sprain
[1:15:31] is talking about the wash again or maybe
[1:15:33] the the leader part some little hand or
[1:15:35] some little arm the winding stem
[1:15:38] whatever is maybe or it may be the hand
[1:15:42] on the face of the clock that tells the
[1:15:45] time but wherever you are whether you
[1:15:47] attack us
[1:15:48] it take us all working together in
[1:15:52] harmony with god with the gospel Jesus
[1:15:54] Christ to bring this to pass
[1:15:57] you know what
[1:15:59] why why the Rapture should we do because
[1:16:01] we have not been able to do this
[1:16:03] we're still forcing with one another we
[1:16:05] were divorcing with all the other
[1:16:07] churches you know we should not do that
[1:16:10] I mean it's if you go to someone and you
[1:16:13] say forgive me I did something wrong and
[1:16:14] the person don't want to forgive you
[1:16:15] that's not on you you did your part if
[1:16:18] you want to go to another church you
[1:16:20] want to base it and you want to see and
[1:16:21] you want to enjoy and people look at you
[1:16:24] like you know
[1:16:26] you got you know lepra or disease or
[1:16:28] something you know
[1:16:30] that's on them
[1:16:32] you know sometime in Tucson that's the
[1:16:33] only thing now that's the churches and
[1:16:35] they cannot see each other
[1:16:37] I see people sisters in Walmart and
[1:16:40] brothers from another church and as soon
[1:16:42] as they see me they turn around
[1:16:45] see they don't want to see me and even
[1:16:46] in pictures you know nothing
[1:16:50] and then they said that they are the
[1:16:52] bride
[1:16:53] I'm not I'm not criticizing them
[1:16:55] because that is the teaching from the
[1:16:57] pulpit I don't blaming the people
[1:17:00] see I'm blaming the teaching I come from
[1:17:03] the pulpit
[1:17:06] says
[1:17:09] it doesn't matter what part you're about
[1:17:10] whatever it is it takes all of us to do
[1:17:12] to together to work at Harmony with the
[1:17:15] gospel Jesus Christ you know maybe the
[1:17:17] piano is playing good and he's playing
[1:17:19] good with this and this one but if
[1:17:21] you're not entering in and enjoying and
[1:17:24] praising the Lord then
[1:17:26] you're not doing your part
[1:17:28] even it's your party church is to say
[1:17:30] amen that's your part even if your party
[1:17:33] just to clap that is your part means
[1:17:37] your party just to open the door and
[1:17:38] greet people like they're doing warmer
[1:17:40] that is your part I don't care housing
[1:17:41] insignificant the clock will not work
[1:17:44] without that part you cannot tell the
[1:17:47] time you'll be lost
[1:17:50] so it doesn't matter how small or how
[1:17:53] big
[1:17:54] just do your part
[1:17:57] and when all the parts come together
[1:17:58] then the machine is nice and oily it's
[1:18:01] working together fine
[1:18:03] and
[1:18:05] the pastor is happy
[1:18:07] you know like I said sometimes you know
[1:18:09] if Mama is Happy the house is happy
[1:18:12] see because his mama is not happy I'm
[1:18:15] not happy and the children are not happy
[1:18:17] so we try to keep Mama happy see we do
[1:18:20] what we can do
[1:18:21] was the part was happy you know the wife
[1:18:24] is happy and you know everybody's happy
[1:18:28] you think he says you think if give is
[1:18:32] so great what we call out as Paul said
[1:18:35] though I have faith that I can
[1:18:38] could move mountains and I have no
[1:18:40] charity now I'm not in think of that
[1:18:42] until you say well I understand the
[1:18:45] Bible so I understand the Mysteries see
[1:18:48] and still go out and to do this and have
[1:18:52] no charity I am nothing I haven't got no
[1:18:55] word I haven't got nowhere yet see the
[1:18:58] maintenance love God and humble yourself
[1:19:03] number eight I'm almost done yeah eight
[1:19:07] humble people they understand their
[1:19:09] limitations
[1:19:12] because sometimes
[1:19:14] we like to come to church
[1:19:16] and we don't want to give an appearance
[1:19:18] that we that we don't know anything we
[1:19:19] want to pretend that we know
[1:19:21] in fact some people come to church so
[1:19:23] they don't criticize you know when they
[1:19:25] criticize people don't come to church
[1:19:26] but if I don't come to church they
[1:19:28] they're gonna say something well that's
[1:19:31] not the reason you come to church you
[1:19:32] come to church because you love God
[1:19:35] see but some people like to or if I
[1:19:37] don't go to church I love the pastor is
[1:19:38] gonna
[1:19:39] Point me out from now but that's not the
[1:19:41] reason anyway so we know our limitation
[1:19:45] second Corinthians 12 5 is such as one
[1:19:47] will I Glory of such and and when will I
[1:19:52] go again of myself I will know Glory but
[1:19:55] in my infirmities again
[1:19:58] um perfect strength by Perfect
[1:20:00] weaknesses you come you come say now
[1:20:03] Lord I have been in school for 40 years
[1:20:05] now I am an intellectual student I can
[1:20:08] quote the Bible with my eyes closed God
[1:20:11] cannot use a bit of that see or belong
[1:20:14] to the biggest church see
[1:20:17] um oh Lord oh I am a Pentecostal glory
[1:20:19] to God I just received the Holy Ghost uh
[1:20:22] the other night Hallelujah you are going
[1:20:24] to make me do this and do that God
[1:20:26] cannot use no
[1:20:29] whatever you get late I realize you are
[1:20:32] late and then coming back and humble
[1:20:34] yourself and then get weak for now and
[1:20:38] find out you are human
[1:20:39] but if I said being late sometimes you
[1:20:42] know to God will abase with downgraders
[1:20:45] or let something happen to our life
[1:20:47] where we cannot get out of it then we
[1:20:49] scream out but we don't want a way for
[1:20:52] God to Humble us that way see
[1:20:55] number nine he says
[1:20:58] they are a model
[1:21:00] a model the way they model the way
[1:21:04] they are sample humble people there are
[1:21:06] samples
[1:21:07] they are leaders
[1:21:11] see usually the Bible said Mark those
[1:21:14] that do good but also said Mark those
[1:21:17] that they're not that good that that
[1:21:20] create controversies and and things like
[1:21:22] that so if you have someone that is like
[1:21:25] that it's good you mark them
[1:21:27] if you want to be like somebody that's
[1:21:29] the guy you want to be like
[1:21:31] see
[1:21:32] so no
[1:21:34] there will be an example to the
[1:21:37] congregation an example to you Ephesians
[1:21:40] 2 24 29 said let not corrupt
[1:21:43] communication procedure of your mouth
[1:21:45] but that which is good to to the use of
[1:21:48] edifying that he may Minister Grace on
[1:21:51] to others I already talked to you
[1:21:52] earlier about that but the brother said
[1:21:55] now surely after all these years in the
[1:21:57] field and around the world I see getting
[1:21:59] the people I thought I had to know a
[1:22:02] little bit about the the gates to enter
[1:22:05] in our and if you want to get somewhere
[1:22:08] with God never let an arrogant Spirit
[1:22:11] ever come around don't let No Malice
[1:22:15] come and no matter what anybody says if
[1:22:19] they are wrong don't you never build up
[1:22:21] a complex against the person see
[1:22:24] you'll be sweet and kind remember God
[1:22:28] love you when you were in sin
[1:22:31] and if the spirit of God is in you you
[1:22:34] love the other person when he is being
[1:22:36] wrong
[1:22:38] see just pray for him and love one
[1:22:41] another about everything love God I love
[1:22:44] one another
[1:22:46] and humble
[1:22:48] with God around one another and God will
[1:22:51] bless it and this is hard telling that
[1:22:53] he will do
[1:22:56] amen
[1:22:58] my conclusion here we go
[1:23:02] humble people they lead from within not
[1:23:05] without
[1:23:06] Colossians 3 to us says put on therefore
[1:23:09] as the elect of God a holy and beloved
[1:23:12] bowels of Mercy kindness humbleness of
[1:23:15] Mind meekness and long suffering
[1:23:18] Colossians 3 13 forbidding one another
[1:23:22] see and forgiving whatever forbearing
[1:23:25] one another is to tolerate one another
[1:23:28] you know to be patient with one another
[1:23:30] it says to forgive one another If any
[1:23:34] man have a core against any even ask I
[1:23:37] forgave you so also do you
[1:23:41] brother Brahman says he and this is my
[1:23:43] last quote
[1:23:45] and we can have all things in fellowship
[1:23:48] and common love one another then God
[1:23:51] will work with us
[1:23:53] and we are keeping time that the people
[1:23:57] come by and said if you want to see a
[1:24:00] church that is really humble and I'm
[1:24:03] looking at one
[1:24:05] you want to see a church that is really
[1:24:07] humble a church that really love God
[1:24:09] drop in there at that Tabernacle
[1:24:13] you know one time I'll watch them look
[1:24:16] at and the care they have for one
[1:24:18] another respect and when the gospel is
[1:24:21] being preached how Reverend and how
[1:24:24] everything just in order
[1:24:26] then they can look and see what time we
[1:24:29] are living
[1:24:30] because
[1:24:32] the church had to unite
[1:24:35] but if you can unite in here how can you
[1:24:38] Unite with everybody else
[1:24:40] and the word that Russia is going to
[1:24:41] happen this is how you're going to tell
[1:24:43] when time comes but the man says you
[1:24:46] know it's a mystical body around the
[1:24:47] world you're not people got the idea
[1:24:49] that we are going to get together in one
[1:24:50] place and unite it's not so
[1:24:53] the only place we're going to be all
[1:24:55] together unite it says in heaven we will
[1:24:57] meet him in heaven in heaven we will be
[1:24:58] together
[1:25:00] but here before that happens before we
[1:25:02] get close to that
[1:25:04] you see the churches you know around
[1:25:06] Ohio Michigan you know this church you
[1:25:09] see everybody coming together
[1:25:11] see as we've been talking and then
[1:25:14] suddenly
[1:25:15] change happens
[1:25:17] and then that church had their way out
[1:25:19] there in Michigan Ohio and another state
[1:25:21] they start experimenting the same thing
[1:25:24] and then
[1:25:26] we are not going to meet all together
[1:25:28] here in the earth in one spot in
[1:25:30] Jerusalem yeah
[1:25:31] but are they in Africa suddenly then the
[1:25:34] time comes and everybody's together
[1:25:36] as I just playing then you're going to
[1:25:39] see changes changes changes and suddenly
[1:25:43] a changeover body
[1:25:45] and then we will get together
[1:25:48] in the air not here in there and they
[1:25:51] can look and see what time we are
[1:25:53] leaving they they see the spirit of God
[1:25:54] moving among you
[1:25:56] you know that's the only God they're
[1:25:58] going to see there's people there
[1:26:01] that they are in trouble you know chaos
[1:26:04] and they're looking for just to lead a
[1:26:06] light of a sunshine to you know
[1:26:10] to shine on their darkest problems and
[1:26:13] and you have it
[1:26:16] but you by yourself you can only chase a
[1:26:19] thousand but if you can get with the
[1:26:21] brother that's ten thousand and the more
[1:26:23] we get together more light the more
[1:26:24] light and the light will reject the
[1:26:26] darkness
[1:26:27] that is pressing but we all got to come
[1:26:30] together and humble our son
[1:26:33] that is working together is telling the
[1:26:36] time but but if it's not working then
[1:26:38] the time has stopped
[1:26:40] I always used to tell to myself the only
[1:26:43] reason that God will stop working on me
[1:26:45] is when I poke a hole in his
[1:26:49] let me let me give you the illustration
[1:26:51] so you understand what I mean
[1:26:53] you have a spider you don't like spider
[1:26:56] don't worry it's a spider web
[1:26:59] and that little spider toys all day you
[1:27:03] know all day and then comes a little boy
[1:27:06] like me and then oh look at that
[1:27:10] poor she has toil all night all day now
[1:27:14] she had to stop
[1:27:15] completely the one fixed the hole that I
[1:27:18] caught
[1:27:19] so that's what happened in church we
[1:27:22] keep poking holes and poking holes so
[1:27:24] the church stopped because we got away
[1:27:26] for you now we gotta wait for this and
[1:27:28] we gotta resolve this one we cannot go
[1:27:30] forward now we have to go back and fix
[1:27:33] things
[1:27:35] so don't give a pass to a hard time
[1:27:36] let's move forward it's time to move
[1:27:38] forward
[1:27:39] we cannot go backward any longer
[1:27:42] so the only place to go is that way
[1:27:45] so let's fix our problem let's fix all
[1:27:47] our fall let the speed have harmony
[1:27:50] let's love one another let's forgive one
[1:27:53] another
[1:27:54] it doesn't matter
[1:27:56] because I want to move forward don't you
[1:27:58] want to move forward don't you want to
[1:27:59] see the day of the Lord coming don't you
[1:28:00] want to see your body change
[1:28:03] I want to move forward I don't want to
[1:28:06] start standing stand still in in time
[1:28:10] see because I used to sit just like that
[1:28:13] spider the only reason that I can't stop
[1:28:16] the god the hand of God in my life is
[1:28:18] that I poke a hole in his work
[1:28:21] then he has to go back and okay
[1:28:23] gotta get you back here let me put it
[1:28:25] this other way
[1:28:27] sometimes you have a besetting sin
[1:28:30] it happens and sorry Lord and it happens
[1:28:33] but you know it's going to happen until
[1:28:35] finally you have enough Faith to to face
[1:28:38] it that you have a problem you know like
[1:28:41] alcoholic that you're gonna help someone
[1:28:43] until they face the fact that they're an
[1:28:45] alcoholic if you have problems you have
[1:28:47] anything in your life
[1:28:49] until God take care of that you will
[1:28:52] move forward
[1:28:53] do you know
[1:28:55] that the only way you can move forward
[1:28:57] is that you could overcome that in your
[1:29:00] life and then you can move forward
[1:29:02] but as long as we're still dealing with
[1:29:04] the same thing the same issue and the
[1:29:06] same problem we just spinning law
[1:29:09] uh you know our lives
[1:29:12] so the sooner we let God take care of
[1:29:14] our leader teens
[1:29:16] the body can move forward because Julie
[1:29:18] the part is needed
[1:29:21] he said they can look and so what the
[1:29:24] spirit of God moving among new great
[1:29:26] things same wonders and things will be
[1:29:28] taking place
[1:29:31] if the things working together is is
[1:29:34] telling the time but if it isn't working
[1:29:37] then the time has stopped then people
[1:29:39] come to the church and say yeah I went
[1:29:41] to that church but nothing was happening
[1:29:43] in fact I think we have more in the
[1:29:45] Baptist Church than what they got there
[1:29:47] I mean I saw low faces long dresses and
[1:29:50] long hair but that's all
[1:29:54] I mean if that's what it is I can have
[1:29:56] that in the Baptist Church too no that's
[1:29:58] why some people sometimes do you talk to
[1:30:01] people on the sea and you try to to tell
[1:30:04] them about the gospel you try to give
[1:30:05] him testimony and they look at your life
[1:30:07] and they said
[1:30:08] well you know
[1:30:09] yeah I think I got more than what you
[1:30:12] got because you talking but I don't see
[1:30:14] anything you know I like to see a
[1:30:16] ceremony lived and preach
[1:30:19] I need to finish
[1:30:21] but if it isn't working then the time
[1:30:22] has stopped I won't tell the time no
[1:30:25] more so if we want to know what time we
[1:30:27] are leaving just start everybody working
[1:30:29] together in the gospel you want to see a
[1:30:33] Revival in the church
[1:30:34] it says we're together
[1:30:37] see it says so we want to know what time
[1:30:40] it is it's like where to get in the
[1:30:41] gospel loving one another and loving God
[1:30:43] and the handoff is the hands inside will
[1:30:47] tell the time what we are living in do
[1:30:51] you believe that
[1:30:52] and amen you can't stand
[1:30:56] to your feet
[1:31:02] thank you for being so patient with me
[1:31:04] and thank you for putting up with me
[1:31:08] and I know that it's not an easy thing
[1:31:11] as my wife
[1:31:12] not easy to put up with me so
[1:31:15] but uh
[1:31:17] I thank you guys I thank you for your
[1:31:19] love and thank you for your kindness and
[1:31:21] I thank you for everything you have done
[1:31:24] uh since we've been here I love you guys
[1:31:27] and and uh we love you and now I know we
[1:31:31] don't sometimes have the same opinions
[1:31:34] and sometimes we don't agree but that
[1:31:36] had nothing to do with anything
[1:31:38] we're still brothers and sister
[1:31:40] in favor of I said go to the back go the
[1:31:42] house and go ahead and disagree and
[1:31:44] fight and force and kick but when you
[1:31:46] come to the front
[1:31:48] you know
[1:31:49] with your arms around each other listen
[1:31:54] I've been married 45 years now I'm going
[1:31:57] 46 this year thank you and I still
[1:31:59] cannot agree 100 with my wife
[1:32:03] I mean if I cannot agree with my wife
[1:32:04] you think I'm agree with you
[1:32:07] totally 100
[1:32:09] we're going to have these agreements
[1:32:11] face it we're going to have different
[1:32:13] ideas and thoughts and opinions but let
[1:32:16] that not separate us from one another
[1:32:19] see we're all different
[1:32:21] uh I'm from Puerto Rico but was from
[1:32:24] Mexico and you're from there and you're
[1:32:26] from there God has a variety
[1:32:28] we are not all different we don't like
[1:32:30] the same things
[1:32:31] so if you don't like cherry pie you know
[1:32:33] fine I don't
[1:32:34] but don't this Fellowship me because you
[1:32:36] know our life but I like Apple
[1:32:39] you know
[1:32:41] you know I come from another country I
[1:32:44] was shaped and forming different than
[1:32:46] you were shape and formed
[1:32:48] but see when we come into the gospel we
[1:32:50] kind of agree with one thing and we can
[1:32:52] win one Accord the word the word is
[1:32:54] correct everything else
[1:32:57] is meaningless
[1:32:59] thank you
[1:33:00] yes love you
[1:33:02] I don't think you want to dismiss or you
[1:33:04] want me to dismiss
[1:33:06] that's one thing I don't know how to do
[1:33:08] singing I can carry a tune in a bucket
[1:33:15] no see I'm always feeling jealous
[1:33:17] because you you can sing you can preach
[1:33:19] You Can Dance you can tap
[1:33:21] and God didn't give me anything I want
[1:33:26] [Applause]
[1:33:32] you didn't need to end the sermon that
[1:33:34] way if that's for sure
[1:33:36] you didn't need to say that what a way
[1:33:38] to end a sermon
[1:33:41] yeah humble right
[1:33:44] I praise the lord well the wisdom of God
[1:33:46] we appreciate the wisdom of God and
[1:33:48] sitting at Jesus feet tonight amen
[1:33:50] burning from the wisdom of God and the
[1:33:53] channel of
[1:33:54] Jesus Jesus humility
[1:33:58] is what we want not false humility not
[1:34:01] the humility of the world but true
[1:34:03] genuine humility and as he as he read
[1:34:07] all the characteristics of it I trust
[1:34:09] you weren't sitting there applying them
[1:34:12] to everybody else
[1:34:14] as we're so good at so professional at
[1:34:17] no they needed that and they needed that
[1:34:19] and they needed it take all 10 points
[1:34:22] and apply them to yourself
[1:34:23] and it's the wisdom of God we appreciate
[1:34:25] the Lord in our lives and we appreciate
[1:34:28] these things in God's humility brother
[1:34:30] Bram said if we really want to be led by
[1:34:32] the spirit of God the only way to be led
[1:34:34] by the spirit of God is to be gentle and
[1:34:38] to not know a whole lot
[1:34:40] and that's it and when we get to know
[1:34:43] too much and we put that out there it
[1:34:47] has all the characteristics of not being
[1:34:48] able to work together not being able to
[1:34:51] work function as a body and all these
[1:34:53] other things so the channel That
[1:34:54] humility let this mind be in you that
[1:34:57] was also in Christ Jesus this is his
[1:34:59] mindset this is his this is how he
[1:35:01] functions how he walked on this Earth he
[1:35:04] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:35:05] God he knew his position with God he
[1:35:08] knew who he was he knew he was God on
[1:35:09] Earth
[1:35:10] but yet he made himself a no reputation
[1:35:13] he intentionally made himself less
[1:35:16] popular even though he's getting more
[1:35:17] popular he intentionally made himself of
[1:35:20] no reputation to stay simple and to stay
[1:35:22] humble and to keep that that's what we
[1:35:25] want amen praise the Lord let's say I
[1:35:27] love this family of God and then we'll
[1:35:28] pray and we're going to be dismissed
