[0:00] Hello everyone. Pastor Paula Fontaine
[0:02] and Literal Life Church in Petersburg,
[0:04] Michigan would like to invite you to
[0:06] take the next half hour and enjoy some
[0:08] time in the word of God. If you're
[0:11] hungry for more God, we believe you can
[0:13] be fed. And we pray that you'll be
[0:16] blessed. Visit our website for more
[0:18] information at literalife.urch.
[0:21] May God bless you, my friend. May the
[0:23] music and message encourage you today.
[0:30] [Music]
[0:32] Oh, the trials of this world
[0:37] were getting stronger.
[0:41] [Music]
[0:43] The pool I felt was more than I could
[0:48] bear.
[0:54] And I was on the verge
[0:57] of giving over.
[1:03] The strength within myself
[1:08] just wasn't there.
[1:12] But something keeps holding me.
[1:18] Every day I see
[1:22] he's helping me faithfully
[1:26] to overcome my trials,
[1:32] guiding me constantly,
[1:37] giving me victory.
[1:42] He's a reality.
[1:46] Something keeps holding me.
[1:53] Satan laid before me his temptation
[2:03] of his desire to steal away all my
[2:08] faith.
[2:09] [Music]
[2:12] But I felt within my soul a revelation.
[2:22] It was the strength I had to have to
[2:26] keep me in this race.
[2:31] Something keeps holding me.
[2:34] [Applause]
[2:36] Every day I see
[2:40] he's helping me faithfully
[2:44] to overcome my trials,
[2:50] guiding me constantly,
[2:55] giving me victory.
[3:00] He's a reality.
[3:03] Something keeps holding me.
[3:09] That's how I know
[3:12] my redeemer
[3:15] lives.
[3:19] Yes, I know my redeemer
[3:24] lives.
[3:28] Let all creation
[3:31] testify
[3:33] and let the light within me cry.
[3:37] I know
[3:40] my redeemer
[3:43] lives.
[3:47] Yes, he lives
[3:50] to take away my pain.
[3:54] [Music]
[3:56] Yes, he lives
[3:59] forever. I'll proclaim
[4:05] that the payment for my sin
[4:10] was a precious life he gave.
[4:15] Now he's alive.
[4:18] This isn't a secret.
[4:24] Yes, I know
[4:27] my redeemer
[4:29] lives.
[4:31] [Music]
[4:33] I know
[4:36] my redeemer
[4:38] lives.
[4:42] Let all creation
[4:45] testify.
[4:47] Let this life within me cry.
[4:52] I know
[4:54] my redeemer
[4:57] lives.
[5:01] Let all creation
[5:04] testify.
[5:06] Let this life within me cry.
[5:10] I know
[5:14] Jesus keeps holding me.
[5:20] Deuteronomy chapter 30 and verse 11, if
[5:22] you read with me.
[5:26] For this commandment which I command
[5:28] thee this day,
[5:30] it is not hidden from thee, neither is
[5:34] it far off. Now I wonder why he had to
[5:36] say that this commandment and this word
[5:39] that's come from God from heaven to his
[5:42] people, it's not far from you. Why would
[5:44] he have to say that? because people
[5:46] begin to feel like it's a far off. It's
[5:49] unreachable. How many has ever felt like
[5:51] that I just feel like I'm a I'm a loner
[5:53] and this is the things that's being
[5:55] preached is it's unreachable to me. God
[5:57] seem How many's ever felt like God is
[5:59] just so far away from me.
[6:01] &gt;&gt; And so this word that he said he's
[6:03] given. He said, I I want to let you know
[6:05] that it's not hidden. It's not hidden
[6:08] and neither is it far off. Goes on to
[6:11] say, it is not in heaven. It is not in
[6:13] heaven that thou shouldest say, "Who
[6:15] shall go up for us to heaven and bring
[6:17] it unto us that we may hear it and do
[6:20] it?" You don't have to do that. Who's
[6:22] going to go up to heaven and bring it
[6:23] down? Because that had already happened
[6:25] here when God sent his word through
[6:26] Moses and brought the word to the
[6:28] people. Then he says, "Neither is it
[6:30] beyond the sea that thou should say, who
[6:32] shall go over the sea for us and bring
[6:35] it unto us that we may hear it and do
[6:38] it." So the theme is is that don't let
[6:41] the devil tell you that it's so far away
[6:44] from you. God has brought it close and
[6:47] it's closer to you than you think.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; In other words, my theme today, God does
[6:52] not want these things to be distant from
[6:54] you. He wants to bring it personal to
[6:57] you.
[6:59] &gt;&gt; How close is it? Verse 14, but the word
[7:04] is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth.
[7:08] and in thy heart.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; That's pretty close.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; And if it's not there today, then he's
[7:15] letting you know that's where he wants
[7:16] us to be. He wants the word to be in
[7:19] your mouth and in your heart. It's
[7:21] neither in thy mouth and in thy heart
[7:24] that thou mayest do it. I have one more
[7:27] scripture in the New Testament in 2
[7:28] Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 18. But
[7:32] we all with open face beholding as in a
[7:37] glass the glory of the Lord. This also
[7:39] speaks of a pretty close relationship.
[7:42] It's not distance. It's open face. It's
[7:46] face to face. Can you say amen?
[7:48] &gt;&gt; We all with open face beholding is in
[7:50] the glass. The glory of the Lord. What
[7:53] happens? Are changed into the same image
[7:56] from glory to glory. Notice it doesn't
[7:59] say a one-time event or being changed
[8:02] one night at an altar, but we are
[8:04] constantly changed
[8:07] &gt;&gt; as we're looking in his face. We're
[8:09] constantly changed from glory to glory
[8:12] to glory, even as by the spirit of the
[8:16] Lord. I believe in change. I believe we
[8:19] can keep changing and it's by staying
[8:21] with our face in the face of Jesus
[8:24] Christ. People think that they're more
[8:26] connected today because of social media.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; They think that I'm more connected with
[8:33] people than I ever have been in my life
[8:35] because of social media. I want to let
[8:37] you know that's not completely a true
[8:40] connection.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; That's not a face-toface connection. And
[8:44] actually, culture trains us to be that
[8:46] way that we start to believe that that's
[8:49] a connection. And people con are
[8:52] convinced that they're more connected
[8:53] than they've ever been with social
[8:55] media, but we're not really connected.
[8:57] We're actually less connected than we've
[8:59] ever been. Relationships are suffering
[9:01] and relationships are going ary because
[9:04] we think that we're connected because
[9:06] we're on our phone connected with the
[9:08] whole world, but you're not really
[9:09] connected.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; It's really deceiving us into thinking
[9:14] that we're connected when we're when
[9:16] we're by ourselves. we're we're by
[9:17] ourselves with our phone and that we
[9:19] we're deceived into thinking that we're
[9:21] we're connected that way. Uh and and
[9:24] it's it's it's that somehow that we're
[9:26] connected to the cyber world. So, we're
[9:29] connected and none of it is face to
[9:31] face. So, that that can teach us that
[9:33] because we are at church, uh sometimes
[9:36] we feel like we're personally corrected
[9:39] connected to Christ. Just because we're
[9:41] at church doesn't mean we're connected.
[9:42] This morning,
[9:44] &gt;&gt; I might say some things that offend you,
[9:46] but just give me a chance here and just
[9:48] think about it because I like to talk
[9:50] about what's really real. There could be
[9:52] a possibility that you could be in
[9:54] church but not be connected.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; The culture has kind of made us that way
[10:03] to where we we have a slot and we do
[10:05] something, it's got to be pretty quick.
[10:07] I have a hard time preaching for an
[10:08] hour, an hour and a half because we're
[10:10] we have we're in a generation of ADD,
[10:12] attention and deficit disorder. We've
[10:14] been taught to have everything quick and
[10:16] so we've got it done. We've got a
[10:17] certain time for church. We got to get
[10:18] going. And so it's difficult. We see now
[10:21] we're being taught to be that way. We're
[10:23] being cultured into that way.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; And as I've said before, it doesn't work
[10:28] with the Bible or the scripture because
[10:30] the Bible says, "Be still and know that
[10:32] I'm God." Be still and know God. How
[10:35] many want to know God this morning?
[10:36] You're going to have to learn how to be
[10:38] still to take some time and listen to
[10:40] his voice.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "They that wait upon the
[10:45] Lord shall renew their strength."
[10:46] Anybody want to have new strength this
[10:48] morning? Well, it doesn't come quick. We
[10:50] have to wait upon the Lord. So, all this
[10:53] culture that we get is completely
[10:55] contrary with connecting with this
[10:57] Christ.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; I think I would tell the truth about it
[11:01] because we all fall under this uh
[11:03] cultural wave that we're in. So, we just
[11:06] because we're in church doesn't mean
[11:08] we're connected. Because we have a Bible
[11:10] app on our phone does not mean we're
[11:12] connected.
[11:14] That you're connected with your friends
[11:16] from camp on your phone doesn't mean
[11:17] you're connected.
[11:19] Does not mean you're connected with
[11:21] Christ. and and and we we went from, you
[11:24] know, I was thinking last night, we've
[11:26] gone from deep face-to-face
[11:29] conversations, spiritual conversation,
[11:32] you know, when we didn't have our phones
[11:34] before and didn't have all this, we went
[11:36] from deep face-to-face conversations. We
[11:39] then we went to texting and then we
[11:42] moved to FaceTime. What is that
[11:44] FaceTime? It's not really FaceTime. We
[11:46] moved to FaceTime. Then we moved to
[11:49] chats.
[11:51] just chats. And everybody everybody
[11:54] notice how we're moving now from
[11:57] something that's lengthy and a
[11:58] meaningful deep conversation. I only
[12:00] have time for just a chat.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; Go ahead. Go ahead and be quiet if you
[12:05] want to.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; Culture is moving us into this.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; And that wasn't enough. You know what's
[12:12] next? Snapchat.
[12:15] Not just a chat, but it has to be a
[12:18] Snapchat. It has to be quicker because I
[12:21] don't have time. I just want to have a
[12:23] flash of picture. Show me what you're
[12:25] doing. I'll show you what I'm doing. I'm
[12:26] on to the next thing.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Snapchat.
[12:33] In this world, there's an attack on time
[12:36] for relationships because relationships
[12:38] take time.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Let's start with our relationship with
[12:42] the Lord. Relationships take time and
[12:45] we're being robbed of our time for
[12:47] things that really don't matter. But
[12:49] what's what's suffering? Relationship.
[12:51] Our relationship with the Lord is s
[12:52] we're not connecting with the Lord like
[12:54] we should.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; We're not connecting with our children
[12:58] like we should. We're not connecting
[12:59] with our families. We don't have to do
[13:01] it. And and and it comes, as I said, to
[13:03] to a Snapchat. These these these names
[13:06] that they give stuff really say
[13:08] something sometimes and we don't pick up
[13:10] on it, but it's it's really saying where
[13:12] we're going. We have to be discerning
[13:15] Christians. We can't just swallow all
[13:18] this like the rest of the world does
[13:20] &gt;&gt; because their relationships are hurting.
[13:22] We have the Lord to call on for
[13:24] relationships, but their relationships
[13:26] are really the highest divorce rate we
[13:28] ever had. People had all kinds of abuse,
[13:30] all kinds of things. There's no
[13:32] connection whatsoever. Fathers to
[13:34] children and marriages and all these
[13:36] other things. And you're going to tell
[13:38] me that that doesn't have uh that
[13:40] doesn't have a association with it. that
[13:42] somehow it's teaching us that the
[13:44] relationship I don't have the time to
[13:47] put into it. I'm on to the next thing.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; Don't tell me it's not related. It is
[13:53] related. And we need to be discerning
[13:55] Christians. Can you say amen? In this
[13:57] world, there's an attack on time for
[13:59] relationship. And the same people who
[14:01] are incredibly connected to the whole
[14:04] world on their phone are the same ones
[14:07] sometimes saying they've never been more
[14:09] lonely.
[14:11] Oh, tell the truth, brother Paul.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; The same ones that say they're more
[14:17] connected than they've ever been are
[14:20] experiencing loneliness and some of them
[14:23] depression.
[14:25] &gt;&gt; Now, how can you be connected with
[14:27] everybody around the world and have
[14:30] that? Well, some other reasons for
[14:32] depressions come, but I can tell you
[14:34] sometimes they scientifically is
[14:36] associated with social media more
[14:39] depressed people than we've ever had.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; But they say they're connected.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; It's because it's not a true connection.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; And I wonder if all of this makes us
[14:50] very shallow people
[14:55] instead of the deep people we should be.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:03] I can guarantee you Christ is not
[15:05] wanting a Snapchat chat relationship
[15:07] with you.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; Every now and then a quick prayer. Hey
[15:14] bro, help me out. I'm in need of help in
[15:18] this situation. God does not want a
[15:20] Snapchat response from you.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; God's wanting relationship with you.
[15:26] &gt;&gt; God's wanting time with you. Can you say
[15:28] amen?
[15:31] Lal Harris sang a song years ago and
[15:33] I've I've always been moved by the
[15:34] lyric.
[15:36] He said in the verse, "There he was just
[15:39] waiting in our old familiar place, an
[15:42] empty spot beside him where once I used
[15:44] to wait to be filled with strength and
[15:47] wisdom for the battles of the day. I
[15:49] would have passed him by again if I
[15:51] didn't hear him say." And the chorus
[15:53] goes, "I miss my time with you. those
[15:56] moments together. I need to be with you
[15:58] each day. And it hurts me when you say
[16:01] you're too busy busy trying to serve me.
[16:07] That's right.
[16:07] &gt;&gt; Busy trying to serve the Lord.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; But how can you serve me? The Lord says,
[16:13] when your spirit's empty, there's a
[16:15] longing in my heart, wanting more than
[16:18] just part of you. It's true. God says, I
[16:21] miss my time with you. Second verse
[16:25] says, "What will I have to offer?" How
[16:27] can I truly care? My efforts have no
[16:30] meaning when your presence isn't there.
[16:33] That's
[16:33] &gt;&gt; right.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; But you'll provide the power. If I take
[16:36] time to pray, I'll stay right here
[16:39] beside you. And you'll never have to
[16:42] say, "I miss my time with you."
[16:45] &gt;&gt; Those moments together, I need to be
[16:48] with you each day. And it hurts me when
[16:51] you say, "You're too busy." busy trying
[16:53] to serve me. My heart is longing for
[16:57] more than just a part of you. It's true.
[16:59] God says, "I miss my time with you."
[17:04] &gt;&gt; I just wish I could continue on in this
[17:06] because this is where we're at.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; God has called us to the deepest
[17:11] relationship. You know, I referred to a
[17:13] term called the third pole. If you don't
[17:15] understand that on the broadcast or here
[17:17] today when I return when I referred to
[17:19] the third pole of Jesus ministry which
[17:22] is repeated again in the last days God
[17:24] had different levels and Jesus had
[17:26] different levels of a his ministry.
[17:29] Number one was a first part and it was
[17:31] healing. We are a three-part being and
[17:33] so the first pole dealt with physically.
[17:36] In other words, we're a body, we're a
[17:37] spirit, we're a soul. The second part
[17:39] was our spirit and that was the second
[17:41] pole. That was discernment. Jesus healed
[17:43] the sick and then he discerned the
[17:45] thoughts and the intents of the heart.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; But there was a third part. It's the
[17:50] deepest place that Christ could go. That
[17:54] third pole, that third area, it takes us
[17:57] deeper into a personal, you know what
[17:59] the third pole is? It's a personal It's
[18:01] a personal relationship with him. It's a
[18:04] personal experience with the
[18:05] supernatural God.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; And it's not just a one time at the
[18:09] altar event. Amen.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; It's a constant change from glory to
[18:14] glory
[18:16] &gt;&gt; as we're close to him face to face. How
[18:18] many this morning want a face to face
[18:20] relationship with Christ? How many would
[18:22] like to exit some of these things that
[18:24] we're so bought into that's making us
[18:27] everything has to be quick and and puff
[18:29] potatoes and quick this and fast food
[18:31] and going in and out. We've got to
[18:33] realize, listen, this is doing damage to
[18:36] the way we look at God and the way we
[18:38] look at relationships. How many wants a
[18:40] FaceTime relationship with God? A real
[18:43] FaceTime
[18:45] &gt;&gt; and not a Snapchat. I don't want to have
[18:47] just a Snapchat every morning with my
[18:49] Lord. I want to take my Bible. I want to
[18:51] look to the word. I say, "Lord, this is
[18:53] more important than anything else in my
[18:55] life." You may not have time in the
[18:57] morning with your job, but there has to
[18:59] be time that you not only spend with
[19:02] him, but you have time to communicate
[19:04] with him. And he has time to communicate
[19:07] with you every day through the day.
[19:14] &gt;&gt; David said, "Blessed be the name of the
[19:17] Lord who daily loadeth us with his
[19:19] benefits."
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Give us this day our daily
[19:24] bread." Let me communicate with him
[19:26] daily. Can you say amen? Because the
[19:29] glory of God is wanting to change you
[19:32] personally. the transition to this third
[19:35] pole or this third deeper part of Jesus
[19:38] ministry. And if you if you don't
[19:40] understand that the same God can change
[19:43] his ministry to a deeper way of dealing
[19:46] with us, then you need to know your
[19:47] scripture better. Because some people,
[19:50] in fact, most people in Christianity
[19:52] only know Jesus at certain levels. Jesus
[19:56] as the healer,
[19:58] Jesus as compassion,
[20:00] Jesus as the discerner of hearts, but we
[20:04] need all of Christ revealed to us.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; And so we we have to look at this
[20:09] because he's he's dealing deeper with
[20:11] his people today than he's ever dealt
[20:12] with. He uses ordinary people that we
[20:16] would not expect. In that transition
[20:18] from Moses to Joshua, the ministry
[20:20] changed. And when it changed from the
[20:22] prophet to Joshua taking the people in
[20:25] the promised land, then we the first
[20:27] battle in Jericho that God used two men,
[20:32] no names, didn't know who they were. Two
[20:34] men to go in spy out Jericho. And while
[20:37] they're in there, there's a harlot Rahab
[20:40] that that notice now the two men, we
[20:42] don't even know if they had been with
[20:43] Moses. They probably hadn't. So they
[20:45] hadn't been around the prophet. They
[20:47] were just around Joshua. And this Rahab,
[20:49] she didn't even know Moses and who he
[20:53] was. Never even heard Moses. And yet
[20:56] faith dropped in a harlot's heart to
[20:59] speak the word.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; Now, how does she deserve to get this
[21:04] third pole of speaking the word? How
[21:07] does she because friends, that's the
[21:08] third pole. It's the spoken word upon
[21:10] the lips. That's why I read the
[21:12] scripture. The word is not far away.
[21:14] It's nigh thee in thy mouth. When you
[21:16] have the spoken word on the lips of the
[21:18] people, then you have the third Paul.
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Then you have Christ and what he's
[21:22] wanting to do.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; It's upon the lips of the people. It's
[21:27] the spoken word on your lips. And now
[21:30] Rahab, she didn't deserve this. She
[21:33] hadn't gone through any. She hadn't even
[21:35] been to the altar. She hadn't done
[21:37] nothing. But somehow in the grace of God
[21:40] something drops in her heart and she
[21:43] becomes used to speak I want this. I
[21:46] want this
[21:47] &gt;&gt; and so they spoke said here she said I
[21:49] want this and I want it for my family.
[21:51] That's
[21:51] &gt;&gt; right.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; She hadn't earned anything yet.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; She hadn't earned credibility with the
[21:56] body of Christ yet. She didn't know
[21:58] Moses. Never heard Moses.
[22:01] And yet under this, catch it now. We
[22:05] know the glory of God was upon Moses'
[22:07] face when he brought the word.
[22:09] &gt;&gt; But now the glory of God comes in the
[22:11] heart of a harlot
[22:13] &gt;&gt; and she speaks the word.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; What's my point today? The glory of God
[22:20] is not just to stay in the word, but the
[22:24] glory is to become personal to you.
[22:26] Amen.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; It's not just the ministry changing.
[22:31] It's us changing.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How much more personal
[22:38] can you get?
[22:40] There's Moses message. It was the
[22:42] message of God. There's a great army
[22:44] under Joshua believing it. They're ready
[22:46] to go into the promised land. And that's
[22:49] where God is working, right? That's
[22:50] where he's working. He's working in the
[22:51] big army. The message ranks. It's
[22:53] working in the army. He's working under
[22:54] Joshua. That's where God's working. He's
[22:57] He only worked under Moses. Some people
[22:58] tell us he only worked under Moses and
[23:00] now he's working under Joshua. It's a
[23:02] great army ready to go into the promised
[23:03] land. No, it wasn't that. He grabbed a
[23:06] harlot and moved upon her heart. And the
[23:08] word came and Jericho was fitted for
[23:11] destruction. Can you say amen?
[23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; And she lived inside Jericho as a
[23:17] harlot. And here it's fitted with
[23:20] destruction. And here too, no names. The
[23:23] word came on her lips. With no training,
[23:25] she's going off the witness of two
[23:27] no-name brothers. This glory is to come
[23:30] and be naive in thy mouth.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? This glory is not to
[23:35] stay in books and tapes. It's not to
[23:37] stay on an app on your phone.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; This glory is to come upon our hearts,
[23:43] &gt;&gt; our lips,
[23:45] &gt;&gt; to speak this word again.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; It's a thought. It's the thought of God.
[23:52] And it stays a thought until you speak
[23:55] it.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; And then it begins to materialize.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; Work that way. Before the beginning, God
[24:01] in his thoughts, when he spoke the
[24:03] thought, as soon as he spoke something,
[24:05] this whole earth begin to materialize.
[24:08] Well, if the word is the same, it's the
[24:09] same with us today. Say, "What in the
[24:11] world are you preaching?" I'm preaching
[24:12] Mark 11:23. If you say to this mountain,
[24:16] "Be thou removed." Can I have some faith
[24:18] this morning? This is not unscriptural.
[24:20] This is the deeper move God's taking you
[24:22] to. We're here in this life for more
[24:24] than just a job and more than just, you
[24:27] know, just going through the motions.
[24:28] No, we're here to have a personal
[24:30] relationship with him that he can use
[24:32] the spoken word of God upon our lips.
[24:34] What are you going to point your kids to
[24:35] in this world? There's nothing to point
[24:37] to. Point them to this word. Teach it
[24:40] back in Deuteronomy 23 where he says,
[24:42] "Teach this to your children. Put it on
[24:45] the doorpost of your house. Let it be
[24:47] heard in your home. put it in front of
[24:49] them all the time because that's the
[24:50] only thing that's going to last in this
[24:52] life.
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen out of the families?
[24:57] We have an absolute. We have a word from
[25:00] the Lord. And that absolute is the only
[25:02] stable thing. You young couples, there's
[25:05] nothing else stable in this world. Bring
[25:08] that word into your home. Teach it to
[25:11] your family. Let them see it lived out
[25:14] every day. And you go to messing with
[25:16] it. and you're messing with their minds
[25:18] and you're messing with your lives for
[25:20] the future. But the promise is if you'll
[25:22] get a hold of this with your heart and
[25:24] you say, "Lord, whatever your word says
[25:25] to do, we're going to apply that to our
[25:27] home." You will get a blessing in your
[25:29] life and your children will be blessed
[25:30] when you're gone someday.
[25:33] &gt;&gt; How's God how's God going to do with
[25:34] that? Cuz you some of you sitting here
[25:36] don't have your children. You don't
[25:37] worry about how God's going to do it.
[25:38] You grab a hold of this. I'm going to
[25:40] put this image and this word in front of
[25:42] my kids. I'm going to bring the glory of
[25:44] God in my home. They're going to see it.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; And don't let it be just dos and don'ts
[25:49] where it's a drudgery. You know, how can
[25:51] kids have a passion for the Christ that
[25:53] you're trying to show them when you have
[25:55] no passion for him yourself? It's a
[25:57] drudgery to come to church. It's a
[25:59] drudgery. You're not in the message at
[26:01] all. How can they be impressed with
[26:03] that? Let them see this is not dos and
[26:05] don'ts. This is the passion of Jesus
[26:07] Christ. This is a lifestyle for me.
[26:12] And then if they go astray, then you got
[26:14] the promise God will bring them back
[26:16] someday
[26:17] &gt;&gt; cuz you put the right image in front of
[26:19] them. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[26:23] &gt;&gt; We're not perfect parents. There's no
[26:25] perfect parent in here. The only perfect
[26:27] parent is our Lord. Amen.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; But because we're looking at a perfect
[26:32] parent and we keep our eyes on him, our
[26:35] mistakes, God will override those things
[26:38] &gt;&gt; if we'll put this word in front of our
[26:41] families. You see, this isn't a one time
[26:43] at the altar one time deal.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; We're changed from glory to glory.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; What needs to change? Well, you go in
[26:54] and you got a habit of smoking. God
[26:56] comes out. You couldn't get over it. you
[26:58] took all the pills or you did
[26:59] everything. You got the patch and all of
[27:02] a sudden Christ comes in and just he
[27:04] just delivers you from those filthy
[27:07] cigarettes.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; Delivers you from an adulterous
[27:11] lifestyle. Delivers you from habits of
[27:14] cursing.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; It's amazing. Takes the Lord. Some of
[27:17] you are bad cursors.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Nobody's saying amen. You're I Some of
[27:24] you very professional cussers.
[27:28] But Christ comes in your life and that
[27:30] thing is is laid down.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; So he does a lot of the big stuff, but
[27:35] he's not done with you
[27:37] &gt;&gt; because as I preach over and over again,
[27:40] &gt;&gt; there's deeply hidden heart issues
[27:42] laying there sometimes.
[27:44] &gt;&gt; Jealousies, bitterness,
[27:47] past wrongs.
[27:49] Amen.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; Values that are not God values. They're
[27:55] worldly values.
[27:57] And it's all laying there for some
[27:58] reason. And God's not finished with us
[28:01] yet. His glory has to come in and keep
[28:04] changing us,
[28:06] &gt;&gt; changing us from glory to glory.
