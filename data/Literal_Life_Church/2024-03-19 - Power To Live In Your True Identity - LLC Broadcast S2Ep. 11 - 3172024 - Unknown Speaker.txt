encourage you todaying theous love of Jesus in his mercy and his grace in the manions bright and blessing he'll prare for us to let me hear you sing it come on when we we all get to heaven what a day

heaven what a daying that will be we all see Jesus Will Sing and Shout the victory yes when we all we all see Jesus will sing and Sh the [Applause] Victory and when he had taken the book The Four beast and 4 and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden V full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and Hast made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 time 10,000 and thousands of thousands saying saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever in the four Beast said amen and the four and 20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever chapter five is the emphasis and the theme about this book of redemption and so because of that I want to look at it because it's important to us and to realize that uh Revelations 5 becomes an emphasis on this book and Revelations 10 is an emphasis on the book Because when he came down that same book was open in Revelations 10 so uh what we have learned is that it can be called The Book of redemption but I'm calling it The Book of our true identity this is the book of our true identity because it says our names are in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world so it is our name it is our part not necessarily our physical name but it is our identity in Christ is our identity in him so I'm calling it not just a book of redemption but a a book of our true identity isn't it amazing that God allows us to look upon our true identity in Jesus Christ isn't it a part ful thing to see who you really are because you've been told a lot of different things in your life and you've believed a lot of things about yourself but when God says no no wait a minute let me look at what I thought of you before the foundation of the world it is there's power in knowing your position there's power in in in knowing your true identity and that's what I want to talk about tonight power to live in your true identity I'll say it again the power to live in your true identity because once you begin to catch it you can live every day not just at church not just at camp but to live in your true identity every day confident perfect Faith walking no devil can tell you otherwise when you really know who you are no devil can tell you no you're not that you're something else no you say to the devil I Know Who I Really Am amen so there's power there there's power and position there's power in knowing who you I've of often used the illustration many times of someone who's adopted by a family and they never knew their true father or mother and uh I I've used examples where you know years ago they would bring these people and they would do research and find their true father find their uh True Mother and many times they'll bring them together on a television show and it's a big event first time they ever met one another you know and they'll make a big deal out of it Hollywood likes to do that but you can do that you can pay the money you can track it down if you never knew your true daddy never knew your true mama and there's something interesting if you watch some of these uh uh these uh reunions or these times they come together it really has an effect on them and they of course the initial reaction is a lot of tears and their embracing and to meet your true dad and who you really uh came from not just your adopted parents but you see and and and then they'll show sometimes where you get together with them and you have dinner with them and what happens is is normally what happens is as you're with them the more that you're with your true daddy the more you look at yourself and you say hey I'm recognizing characteristics that is in me that's in my father after you're with him a while you realize I understand why I act this way I understand why I have this little uh thing that I do I understand why this look my eye a certain way or twitch my nose a certain way I understand because your characteristics and even your character and everything that you are begins to come out and you never knew why you acted that way but when you're with your father you start to say now I know who I really am I can see the image of myself in my father and that's what this book is about being revealed it is your true identity and there's power to live in that every day and you start to wash away the old you and what you are nothing the Bible says he that comes to Christ he's a new creature old things pass away and All Things become new well that means your identity is being revealed to you and you don't live like you used to live you don't act like you used to act you don't play out something that said you're supposed to be a drunk because all your family was drunk you you play out this oh they they go to depression and so that's the way I lean because it's in my jeans well I'm here to tell you you got some other genes tonight you got some spiritual genes and they're more powerful than your family jeans Hallelujah and you start to look at this book and you realize we are learning our true identity and our true name is in it our spiritual part of Christ so when you think about uh what happens here in the Book of Revelations and Revelations 5 when you're at this point of Revelations 5 you realize that there have been 2,000 years of Mighty works of the Holy Ghost in the church that's a lot of years of God performing a lot of things to show he's real 2,000 years of Mighty works of the Holy Ghost and the church acting out who she was even under the worst Dark Ages there would be still a little bit of light that would shine in each age and there was some manifestation of God even though they weren't able to look at their full place in The Book of Life they caught it because they were a seed they caught the age that they were living in they believe with all their heart and there was some manifestation of God in their life and God did Mighty things through the Believers from the book of Acts all the way through for 2,000 years he did Mighty powerful things how many believe that even in the Dark Ages he did powerful things but see now and in Dark Ages and and and in the thousands of Miracles and many w wonders and signs were done and it become very strained and limited there was less signs and wonders there was less that the power of God shown in the Dark Ages because of tre Creeds and dogmas but then in the in the Reformation age then we find it begin to burst out of this bondage of creed and dogs and begin to burst out in in the pieces of reformation it begin to burst out and express itself again and then uh Luther and then Wesley's day bursted out a little bit more that we begin to see these lights of God and God doing things and so as a whole God did many things for 2,000 years there was a lot of rejoicing there was more and more worship and then in the next chapter in time we find the attention after 2,000 years the attention turns to a book now if we're looking for the next thing we're going wh what's what's taking place here why why a book why does that come into the symbolism because it was symbolism this book of redemption it's not a physical book somewhere it's your life before the foundation of the world your name written in Christ so it's a spiritual connotation but we've realized it the the symbolism come in Revelations 5 there's a book there's a book all the things God did but here's now a book and it's the book of redemption it's got names in it it's still sealed with Seven Seals so the final thing God as we get to the final stages of the age the book has to come in play and explained it in the first service you can go back I I laid out a lot of things about this book of redemption but the reason I had to come back to the church is because it's a title deed and Adam lost it in the garden ever since the garden Adam lost the title deed to this earth he lost his power he lost his possession over this Earth he lost his position can you say amen and somewhere along the line God had to give this title deed back to the people of God again so now this title de or this book has to come back in the hands of the people but it couldn't could not come in back in our hands by ourselves we needed a an intercessor we needed an in between we needed someone that was worthy to come and take the book and that was our kinsman redeemer Jesus Christ Redemption is not just paying the price Redemption is the power to bring you and claim you and bring you back so after Seven Ages he had paid the price and he was the only one worthy to take this book of redemption in the name of that were in the book and claim them back for himself and bring them to a millennium and bring them to Kings and Priests again he was the only one worthy and that's why when you get to Revelations 5 the book comes into play and the book gets into the hands of our Kinsmen and worship spontaneous worship just breaks out like never before not because necessarily the power of God but the power of what this book can do to your life blessed be his name amen that's exactly where the last days comes into is this revealing of the book and it becomes such a huge thing as a whole God did many things there was a lot of rejoicing there was more and more worship and then we find a book that's sealed and it's amazing the worship that came from the land I just read it to you in Revelation 5 it is amazing the worship that came from the lamb taking this book and then it being opened the worship was amazing going to some points now worship and power at this point was at a whole new level worship and power was at a whole new level than what it was before it was greater it was greater than just the blessings of the Holy Ghost amen the blessings of the Holy Ghost are wonderful and I thank God when they come I I'll say this sometimes they come sometimes you feel God sometimes you don't I've been in some great meetings and on Monday I didn't feel God at all and that's when I had to know who I was in the book of Redemption how am I going to defeat a devil if I'm looking for the same feeling that I had at some meeting I I I can't go on a feeling I'm going to have to know something deeper My Worship is going to have to continue on Monday can I get an amen My Worship and my overcoming and my power has to continue on Monday not just the weekend and here we find the worship and power when this book was open the worship and the power was at a whole new level it was greater it was greater than a blessing it's greater than the power for miracles that's what they had all during the ages is the powerful Miracles but this was a greater worship and even a greater power and that's why I'm talking about the power to live with this book of identity the power to live it because we got to do more than shout of about it we've got to live it it's got to affect us in such a powerful way that's true the worship in Revelations 5 the worship was related to this book coming back into the hands our of Our Redeemer and that means the Redeemer could claim back who was written in there he could give back our inheritance he could restore us to our true identity and we could look at it and see it the worship going on was about this book that it was in the hands of Our Redeemer that he was the only one that would tear the seals off it and reveal it he he could give it back to those who that inheritance he could restore us to our true identity no wonder the worship become exuberant at the opening of this book amen Worship in Revelations 5 at the end time was about this book being revealed and it when it begin to break then we realize from verse 11 to verse 14 I read the rest of the chapter it wasn't just the elders we find in um verse 9 if you just have your Bible still open verse 8 when he had taken the book The Four Beast four excuse me the Beast and the four and 20 Elders fell down having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of oders which are the prayers of the Saints because now you're dealing with the past who had gone to the Grave already in Christ and they pray their prayer was actually that that their lamb would step forth and make claims and bring them to be Kings and Priests and the Millennium their prayer was that and now their prayers are coming up because now the lamb is initiating this whole thing of claiming all these back even the ones that were already in the grave and all their prayers are coming up and everything is rushing up because here we are our lamb took the book this is the time everything I prayed for I brought my prayers I brought my peirs but I wasn't at the time of the Rapture I wasn't at the time of the opening of the book I didn't see everything of who I really was but the last days we'll see the book and when the lamb takes it then all those prayers came up oh my prayer is going to be answered my redeemer like job said with all his trouble he said you can tell me I'm sinning all you want you can put me down you can make me depressed I can I can be all a mess can you say Amen but he said I know my redeemer lives and he'll stand for me in that day I have a redeemer he hasn't come yet but I know he lives and he's going to stand for me in that day amen glory be to God it was how many two thou 2,000 years later and he says I know my redeemer lives the answer is going to be he sent up that prayer he knew what was going to happen and now it's happening he's taking the book he's opening the seals all the prayers come up but it wasn't just that verse 11 behold I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and beasts and the elders the number of them was 10,000 times thousand that's a lot of people worshiping it's a pretty big convention thousands of thousands begin to worship at this time when this book is open saying with a loud voice worthy the lamb that was slain and then verse 13 John take John is a personal thing now something happened to him every creature was in heaven Earth under the Earth in the sea Every Creature heard me saying it says saying but if every creature heard him he was not saying he was screaming and shouting how loud was he he was pretty loud and he said how loud he was I'm telling you I shouted so loud until everything under the sea heard me shout and what was it about what was the shout about just thought of that make sure you know what your shout is about that's my subject tonight is the motive of our worship and I'm telling you the motive of this worship was not just that God was powerful to cast out Devils but the motive motive of this worship was this book of identity being revealed that I can say I know who I am I'm starting to see who I really am and that has more power over the enemy than anything true a confident son or daughter of God in perfect Faith stable knowing their place in the word and knowing they're of God the devil the devil can't do much with them that's true because they're starting to see their true identity see then the reason for all of this worship is the Redeemer opening up our true life to us we can see it our true identity the power our our true inheritance he gives it back to us the power of seeing it will raise us up to adopted sons and position of confidence not arrogance but confidence I want to draw a distinction between arrogance and confidence true Godly humility emerges from this book because the kinsman redeemer had the character of humility he was the lion and he was the lamb yes and so the revealing of this comes with the revealing of Christ's character that humility comes with it can you say Amen but faith comes with it adopted Sons comes with it position and it's a position of perfect faith and confidence in who you are perfect faith in perfect humility the motive behind the worship is not that God is doing Miracles the worship is going on not because God is doing the Miracles now don't ever stop praising God for him doing Miracles I'm not talking about that we should always thank God and I don't care if he heals through medicine or music however he heals or laying hands whatever it is we should give the glory to God hallelujah we should be rejoicing can you say Amen but I want to point out to you that this rejoicing this worship isn't just that God is a god of Miracles because he's been a god of Miracles for 2,000 years he's raised the Dead He's healed the sick he's healed cancer he's opened up the blinded eyes and so this worship goes deeper than just he's a god of Miracles because I can tell you A lot of people can get excited and happy when God does a miracle even unbelievers true are are you holding on tonight even unbelievers can get excited and maybe even lift their hands and praise God because God did a miracle but they have no intention of getting into the kernel of the life of this and that's why say say I say this is a power to live the life this isn't just a power for miracles the motive behind the worship is not that God is doing Miracles not that God is doing things through us that's not it the motive behind is I am not what I thought I was the motive behind the worship is that I'm not what I thought I was I'm a CH I am a child of God I'm a Child of God by my spiritual genetics that's the exuberance of worship I'm recognizing I'm a Child of God listen if you're at one sign that you're not recognizing that is you're dabbling in you're having an identity crisis and you're still trying to copy someone else you don't know who you are but this Revelation comes with a power that says I am who I am by the grace of God I am a child of God by spiritual genetics my DNA has been revealed to me my true DNA has been revealed and that's why I'm so happy the book of identity and seeing my name there is the motive behind my praise not that I have power to cast out Devils now you just put your seat Bel on here okay because I'm a pastor teaching something here it's all biblical okay but I'm going to teach you something Jesus had to direct and correct the worship of his disciples that got misdirected the worship got misdirected and Jesus had to correct the worship because it was getting imbalanced Mark chapter 6 I want you to see it in the Bible Mark chapter 6 this is when he sent sent his 12 disciples out Mark 6 and verse 7 and he called unto them the 12 and began to send them forth two by two and gave them power over unclean spirits and commanded them that they should not take take nothing for their Journey save a staff only no strip no bread no money for their purse but he Shaw with sandals and but be shod with sandals and not put on two coats and he said in what place soever you enter in that house there abide till you depart from that place and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when you depart then shake off the dust under your feet for the testimony against them verily I say unto you it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in that day of judgment than for that City and they went out and preached and men that men should repent and they cast out many devils and Anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them praise be to God if you get sent from God that's what's going to happen and we praise the Lord for it he sent his disciple he didn't go with them he sent his disciples out to cast out devils in his name and they anointed people and they were healed praise the Lord amen can I point out that this is before the holy ghost in the upper room that this power was given so the power that came from The Upper Room must have been a deeper power than this power that he gave them to cast out Devils then you pick it up over in Luke 10 and verse one we have the same thing he sends them out I want to read this account of it after he sent out the disciples 2 by two after these things the Lord appointed other 70 also and sent them two by two before his face into every city and place whether himself would come therefore he said unto them the Harvest is truly great but the labors are filled pray ye therefore the lord of the Harvest that he would send forth labors into the Harvest go your ways behold I send you forth as Lambs Among Wolves and then he gives a lot of the same instructions you know not to what not to take what to take and the house that you remain in and those that receive you and so I'm skipping now all the way down to verse 17 after they went out and the 70 returned again with Joy saying Lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name they were rejoicing because the Devils were subject to them and they were they had power over devils and he said unto them I beheld Satan as lightning fall from Heaven behold I give you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and Over All all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you stop right there now if you know your Bible like this is the 70 that's called out to do all these things and but isn't this the 70 that left him in John chapter 6 and there was only 12 left and one of the ones that were In This Crowd that was casting out Des was Judas so these 70 said this is too when the word came this is too hard of a saying yes sir we'd like to just stick with the casting out Devils come on now don't get mad at me on we'd like to stick with that it seems a lot more exciting but when he began to bring the word and said I and my flesh are one he began to bring them deeper then they said this is a hard saying and many therefore of his disciples took an exit from there the same ones that were given power over the enemy so all I'm saying now and I'm bringing you the scripture is that there's got to be something deeper in our lives there's got to be a power deeper in our lives just to cast out Devils there's got to be a power that's greater than doing Miracles and I know some preachers would say and I agree with them listen we Miracles listen we should pray Faith to the people we should always believe that God is a miracle working God if we stop believing that then that we limit what God can do can you say Amen but there has to be a life of power that we find in our identity in The Book of Life he said notwithstanding in this Rejoice not that the spirits are subject to you don't worship because Spirits are subject to you but rather worship for this motive because your names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life right so Revelations 5 goes to the book as being the motive of our worship and Jesus Takes those that are worshiping about Devils being cast out and he directs them where to the book that's right because this worship is the most important this rejoicing is the most important he says Rejoice don't Rejoice because Spirits are subject to you if you go that direction then that's that's that's not the way to to go your motive and your rejoicing and your worship motive should be because you've seen your name in the Lamb's Book of Life thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall
