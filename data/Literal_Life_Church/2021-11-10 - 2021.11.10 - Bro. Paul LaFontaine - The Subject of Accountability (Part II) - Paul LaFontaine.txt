========================================

and uh i forgot a couple announcements a sunday uh completely forgot them i know that's hard to believe after all the announcements i made but uh i wanted to mention a couple real important things that i had forgotten that is on the 21st on sunday afternoon from 4-7 they're going to celebrate a time for philip and tabitha getting married back here and it will be in lima at the bible believer's school so i'd like to encourage you to go i know i got to attend the wedding but all of you didn't and so if you could support that and go down though i'm sure they'll have some food there and fellowship but philip and tabitha got married here a couple weeks ago two or three weeks ago and that's on february february november 21st and that's on a sunday afternoon so the 21st and then uh i also forgot to mention starts planning ahead for december 5th on sunday afternoon the lord suffered together december 5th the deacons wanted me to announce that and then we had eight or nine families out sunday and some of it was this coffin thing going through the kids and so uh looks like the lord's healing them rapidly and some are back already i know joe's family was healed today and looked a lot better jose so we thank the lord for his healing touch and we just want to continue to pray but we had so many out that i'm going to send the link to all of you by text of what i talked about sending a little bit of church order a little bit of parents watching over the children a little better for our services so if i send that to you that's not what you send to the trash you should listen to that all the families that missed and we'll might send it by email and text and make sure you listen that because that was important from the deacons and i that we set some order for some things and so if you do that we'd appreciate it that's all the announcements so let's read first kings chapter 22 amen are you glad to be here tonight wonderful presence here tonight of the lord and we're glad to be a part of his kingdom and a part of just to sit sit at his table tonight to be able to be fed amen and they continue three years verse one they continue three years without war between syria and israel and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel and the king of israel said unto his servants know ye that rhemath in gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria and he said unto jehoshaphat will thou go with me to battle to remember gilead and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am is our thou art my people as thy people my horses as thy horses and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel inquire i pray thee at the word of the lord today so i'm on the subject of accountability and here we have jehoshaphat and he's trying to make a link here with ahab or at least ahab is asking him which a king which is the king of israel that is now under a curse from elijah and he's at uh he's asking jehoshaphat to join with them in a worthy cause and is something that's actually he's saying is true that we need to take this land but jehoshaphat now says something that ahab didn't think of ahab's a long ways now from inquiring of the lord being accountable to the lord going to the lord but jehoshaphat still has something within him that says great i'll go with you my horses are your horses but you know what we need to be accountable and go and find out what the lord says amen then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about 400 men and said unto them shall i go up against rhema gilead into battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king so he got a green light for all the 400 prophets and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might inquire of him that took something very deep within jehoshaphat after 400 hebrew trained prophets after 400 this man is still saying all right but can i get some more counsel that's pretty amazing and most anybody would say 400 we're in let's do it but but jehoshaphat is feeling uneasy in his spirit and when you're feeling uneasy in your spirit sometimes you don't need to proceed you need to wait until god has really settled your spirit is that okay with everybody and so jehoshaphat is being accountable jehoshaphat is being accountable by consulting the lord a little bit deeper and then you know the story if you don't chapter verse 7 says jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet lord besides that we might inquire and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man micah the son of imla by whom we may inquire the lord but i hate him i want you to beat around the bush a little bit ahab you know i want you just come right out and say it but i hate him look now this is a king of israel friends and he's able to decipher in his spirit that i like all these prophets but this prophet i hate him for he does not prophesy good concerning me but evil and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so so as much as people through the generations maybe have criticized jehoshaphat and he had his times there's something deeper in jehoshaphat that's actually deeper than ahab and that is let's wait a little while and let's just make sure he's being accountable to the true word of god before he moves lord bless your word tonight minister through it we pray and we just pray on anointing it father for all the ears that would hear in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you so tonight i'm this is part two of accountability and i want to be a bit more specific i want to share some scriptures with you and i want to be a more specific and when we when we use the word accountability it's not that we will be accountable to god someday at judgment we will all the world will as i said and it's not other types of accountability this is i'm more specific i would be saying it making yourself accountable making yourself accountable that's really more a specific title but this is accountability part two and it's making yourself accountable and if i can say it another way it's it's it you you have an intentional honest exposure to the light of god's counsel in other words you've learned to grow and live life with an intentional honest exposure to the light of god's counsel and you do it intentionally you expose you're not afraid to show you're not afraid to expose your life to the light you're not afraid to expose yourself before god as far as your everything that you are your life is an open book and also to the body of christ and brothers that you trust and sisters that you trust you're not afraid to be honest and exposed to the light that we would be within them i'll say it another way uh if that wasn't good enough uh it's it's intentionally probing god for all the input you can get for decisions and how to live it's intentionally probing god for all the input you can get for decisions and how to live it's an intentional probing of god lord i'm staying staying with this i really want an answer from you and not a lot of people on the face of the earth will do that we know there's a lot of people in the face there that don't believe in god and then there's the ones that believe in god that think he's a distant god they basically make decisions every day on their own for everything in life and the only time they address god is when they're in emergency or at christmas or at easter at church or wherever they go but there is also a group of people on the face of the earth that have are intentionally probing and wanting the more faith of god in their hearts they wanted more of god they want to see a revival in their heart they want god to be real to them and they want god to be so real that he can come and counsel and give them leadership in every area of their lives and that's not just some pipe dream god can give you leadership in every area of your life do you believe that if you don't believe that then you won't go to god for everything in your life but there is a group of people and i just love that now let me remind you of the scripture in uh john chapter 3 and verse 21 and we read it out of the amplified they can put it up in the king james it's john 3 21 and it's after john 3 16 and he talks about that but this was really amazing i want to remind you of the scripture john 3 21 and this you can read it there but here's in the amplified but whoever practices truth and does what is right morally ethically spiritual i like to word it that whoever is a coming around truth or embraces truth comes to the light when you come to truth you come to light not darkness can you say amen here's how it's worded whoever comes to the truth comes to light so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are accomplished in god accomplished so so it's proving that your works and what's coming from your life is actually accomplished because you're in the light and because you're giving the glory to god it's being accomplished by god it's not being accomplished by you it's not because of your energy's successes but things are being accomplished by god in your life because you choose to live in the light and you're living in the light and it says that it's accomplished by god and this is what i like divinely prompted done by god's help with god's help in dependence on him the part i liked was divinely prompted in other words if you're living in the light you can to be divinely prompted to do the right things so what a wonderful thing to come to the light we'll walk in the light beautiful light come where the dew drops of mercy are bright when you come to the word you come to the light you live in the light you stay in the light you're around the word of the hour you feed on the worthy hour it's every that light is allowed to be everywhere in your life it's most of what you expose yourself to it's it's most of your phone time it's it's mostly where he's at is where you want to be it's mostly mostly in your life trying to be around the people of god who that's who you want to be around it's his works uh and it's his decisions because you're divinely prompted and they're in your decisions and your works in your life are done with god's help because you're walking in the light what a place to be in so we spoke last week of our accountability to god and according to these scriptures and many more we are accountable to the word and even to the people of god how many believe that hopefully i can show you some scriptures tonight to show that we're not only accountable to the word and that's number one we should live our lives looking and probing for what's the word say on it what's god said about it in everything in life we're accountable to say i don't run off here and exclude this this is this is the absolute of my life this is the center of my life christ reveals himself through the word and this thing this is not just a book on my coffee table this is my life this is what influences my life so now you can't let it sit on the coffee table and get the instruction out of it you got to open it you got to say now lord show me out of your word how to do things show me out of your word how to make this decision show me out of your word how to choose and made in life show me out of your word the type of job to have the type of career they have what is your will for this can you say man and so the the the the word is the main thing in life in other words it's it's not just aside one of your responsibilities or one of your appointments church should not just be one of our appointments because if you live in the flesh if it's just one of your appointments of life if you live fleshly you're going to be tired to come to church but not tired to go everywhere else oh should i preach a little bit now you let your flesh through and you make churches just or reading your bible just a part of the schedule your flesh will push out things that are spiritually nourishing to you and it'll be the last on the list and it'll be after all your energy is gone when it should be the other way around god forgive us when we put it at the bottom of the list and god gets the leftovers of our energy and i'll raise my hand say i'm guilty god forgive me for giving you the leftovers of my energy that i'm laying there and i'm gonna try to open my bible at 10 11 o'clock at night after i've wore myself out and i try to open my bible and i'm trying to keep my eyes open i've i've given god the last of everything the leftovers you know how many like fresh fruit and not leftovers sometimes they can be okay but there's nothing like freshly cooked food hopefully this is fresh for you tonight the bride doesn't have to have leftovers by the way god's prepared a feast can you say amen god's prepared a seven course meal seven seals can you say amen and so we're feeding on a feast but we've got to make our priorities right that we don't give god the leftovers and we've got to make him the center of our life we've got to give him the the best of our energy if we if we just schedule god in and some people are very scheduled everything's scheduled in their life some people are not nothing's scheduled and so we won't talk about who's who but you know there's there's extremes on both sides and you can get yourself carnal on both sides not ordering your life because god's a god of order yes but you can so overly schedule yourself that you you don't tend to schedule the right things in and you know god really doesn't need to be scheduled in he'll ought to be allowed to interrupt any of your schedule you know none of this is in my notes tonight i don't know why god's pulling this out of me through you but i'm telling you god should not have to give the leftovers get the leftovers can you say man and if he chooses just like sunday when i was preaching here i had i only finished a half of what i was going to preach but i'll tell you i'm learning when the lord comes down and starts to move in that moment it's time to stop and let the lord move who cares you've got another rest of the sermon if he's moving in and the subject has come to the heart by jesus christ then you gotta you you've got to say lord now what are you doing here it's time to step away here let god do his work and we need to be open to god interrupting our schedule sometimes you know i find people oh i'm going to get in trouble tonight but i find people can schedule their whole month doctor visits everything else they would never miss some of this stuff for nothing in the world and yet they can miss a lot of important things of meeting with the lord praise the lord so the christians works and decisions are divinely prompted and are done with god's help because they're walking in light and so now according to these scriptures it's not just accountable to the word though it's it's to god's people and i've seen so many people say sometimes even within our own uh message believers they they they say i believe the message and yet they don't answer to anybody i could say this i only answer to god and there's some truth to that but when it goes extreme and says i believe god but i don't answer to anybody i'm going to show you some scriptures tonight that poke holes in that belief because there is an accountability that we have to one another is that okay now we've taken on some worldly principles sometimes and uh you know just like the one that we can we when we reach the age of 18 and that is often emphasized when we reach the age of 18 then you know i can do what i want i'm not under anybody anymore i'm not under any headship anymore i can do this i can the words i can drink or i can do whatever the ages are in each state uh and so then that's the teenager hangs on to that because somebody we don't know who said it we don't have set the age but somebody taught that there's this age that you reach that you don't have to listen to your parents that you don't have to listen to anybody anymore you're on your own you're an adult and probably if you're saying at 18 day one i don't have to listen anymore any to anybody more you're not an adult but somebody says your age says you're an adult you're not an adult just because the way you're talking i don't have to listen to my parents when i reach that you guys have told me all this stuff but i'm finished with it i'm going to do it so they get that in mind who taught you that age you didn't get it from the bible so this world teaches principles of unaccountability that will reach a time of unaccountability brother brown talk debate about the age of accountability come like 12 13 years old in all this life your parents been teaching you things but then god i really believe god begins to move on a young teenager's heart 11 12 13. he called it the age of accountability 13 and he even said himself he said listen he said i he says i would have given my heart to the to the lord at age 12. now he wouldn't have given his heart unless god was moving on him god was starting to speak and there's something about god beginning to will you because you're you're leaving that part of you're leaving that part of just saying saying i do this because of mom dad then god begins to move on you say well why are you doing this do you love me do you want to do it because of me and god would you to say come and follow me and it's the age of accountability but we have ages set that will come out of accountability the world teaches you you'll have a time where you don't have to be accountable to anybody you can do what you want you can say what you want you can wear what you want i can do my own thing and i'm telling you it's the lie of the world to bring you out from underneath some kind of protection and guidance and when you really learn about the shepherd jesus christ and you know his loving guidance then you decide i never want to be without the shepherd's care there is no age that i would want to be out of that i'll say it this way i i've learned about the conviction of the holy spirit that the word can correct me and take the hide off me and i would never want to be away from that place that he can convict my heart give me a good uh spiritual spanking and correct me and i would never want to be outside of the realm of his correction because his correction is his protection now that's hard on some of you young teens tonight listening to me on the internet or here tonight in the service it's a little bit difficult thing to swallow i'm not asking you to swallow it i'm asking you to consider what authority and what accountability really is and don't let the world interpret you that there's some age you know the bad part of it is is when teenagers buy into the whirly thing that 18 i'm done and i don't have to be accountable the real bad part is when parents buy into that idea you got to do what i say until you're 18. and then you're on your own buddy so parents buy into it you may have never heard this before parent but the world set that age and you should never ever say that to your child repent if you said it because you're teaching your child there's a place that i reach that i don't have to be accountable to anybody and when you become a christian you're always accountable to the lord and god with skin on and you want to be you want to be how many testimonies do we have in our church that they could stand and say brother paul preached that to the young people because i've got scars on my life of when i was a teenager and took that very mentality i'm headed out as soon as i turned 18 and they can give testimonies of the scars in their life because they bought into that even tonight i can ask for testimonies and they would do it just with a cry in their heart to say that whole thing of just doing your own thing is such a shallow thing to buy into amen so i'm taking my time because i realized that i'm not going to get through all this even tonight but we're having a good time anyway the world's at that age get it out of our minds that there's a time we reach where we're out from authority i'm so blessed to know people that are 60 70 80 years old that are submissive still 60 70 80 90 years old and they're submissive to god's authority his word they're corrected brother lonnie jenkins was one of them and gone on with the lord now but i would talk to him and every once while sometimes he'd say something like yes i always the great teacher of god we need a brother another brother lonnie he was awesome mentored me wonderful man of god and teacher and teachers can probe sometimes into teaching and doctrinal things but i love to hear him say every now and then he says i always thought about that way but he said the other day the lord corrected me and i had to quit preaching it that way and preach it more perfect we were talking 70 years old 75 years old what does that a man that has learned accountability a man that has learned that we never ever reach age brother paul if it's not 18 what age is it then i want to know if you're changing the age where i do my own thing what age are you setting i'm not setting an age because you don't know it yet but when you learn how loving christ's leadership is you never want to be outside of his protection and leadership you never want to be in a place that you can't be convicted by the holy spirit anymore that your heart is being challenged by his presence you don't ever want to be out of that that's why we come to church judgment begins at the house of god am i not reading a scripture judgment begins at the house of god so we're being judged you know why i want to be judged now you know why i want the word to judge me now and i'm corrected now because whosoever is judged here won't be judged on the other side in other words we're the bride's receiving her judgment now the bride's receiving her correction now matter of fact when you're born again you've passed that judgment and passed unto eternal life so as far as the soul god doesn't judge you anymore because you've accepted christ but the judging and correcting is because we live in these bodies and we always need correction as many as i love i rebuke i don't need to be rebuked i'm saved i've got eternal life no no it says as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent repent amen so we need to get that out of our minds i don't know why labor on that point but i did so so i'd like to make some points now on what we should about consulting the lord okay sometimes that it is an accountability consulting the lord sometimes is an accountability to the right people it's a god with skin on and god can use men and women to give you leadership god can use the right people can you say amen now god can use flesh god can speak through lips of flesh the devil can also speak through lips of flesh so now when we get in the territory of listening to people we really have to have a discerning heart because we have to know that this council is coming from the lord because you can think this is coming from the lord so we have to be very discerning because there's some people in the flesh can guide you wrong and we have every good motive and intention so i want to talk a little bit about that and so we we we just we realized that we want to have god using flesh sometimes but never uh we know that the devil can use flesh sometimes but we never want to eliminate the body and who god can speak through god sometimes can actually speak through strange sources like a donkey for a better term instead of the scriptural term like a donkey and balaam was so proud balaam didn't see god trying to say something and he kept fighting against it because he never could see god can't speak through a donkey i can't believe this this is just you know but he is so proud he says i only listen to god through certain sources when i go to church or i do this and he was a prophet remember i only listen to god when he gives me a dream i only listen to god when he gives me a vision i only listen to god when i do this well here's a donkey and he had to humble himself as he was fighting against the will of god so much bible said balaam fell flat on his face and let me say to you you keep bucking against god trying to warn you you will fall flat on your face like balaam so we have to be open to god speaking through different sources sometimes i've had that happen so the next scriptures that i'm going to bring up to you and they will bring them on the screen i want to lay it down that it's not just that we're alone and we're not accountable to other people it's not just we're alone with our bibles and not accountable to the spirit of god in others prophets often go in the desert they have to receive the word alone they don't get it by counsel or by certain board members or denominations prophets are built special where they gotta they go on the back side of the desert and they get the word directly from god they can't consult with men they can only consult with god don't borrow too much of that for yourself that i'm just gonna i don't need to listen to any preachers i don't need to listen a lot of people don't listen to preachers i don't need to listen to any preacher i don't need to go to any church i don't need the body of christ i just need my bible and when i need to get something from god i go off in the desert that's a prophet there's too many other scriptures to say if you're not a prophet there's other ways that god's going to correct you including the fivefold ministry and don't let me say correction he's going to encourage you he's going to grow you he's going to edify you he sent gifts from heaven to you can you say amen he says i'll give them gifts of prophets and apostles and teachers evangelists and pastors a five-fold ministry five is grace god's grace to you is the true fifo ministry brother brahman says a pastor ordained of god he's ordained to lead you through all the way to the other side hallelujah god gives those gifts can you say amen and so now we're not alone with our bibles unaccountable i can stay home with my bible or be on the backside of the desert i just tell you anybody any family member if you're listening here tonight you're going to see by the scriptures that is no way a christian perspective it's not a christian principle and you're going to get yourself in trouble through the years taking that thing that i don't need anybody else we are accountable to the word and accountable to the body of jesus christ so let's go into it a little bit we should never get alone but never l we should you know we should get alone sometimes with god i believe in that but we should never live without seeking good advice from others and older ones there's a principle right in genesis that said in the beginning it's not good for man to be alone you know when i read that it was a single guy i used it for my singlehood praise the lord thus saith the lord it's not good for a man to be alone i want to get married but the the principle is bigger than that okay god says it's not good for man to be alone and remember now he's going to speak his family he's going to speak a family into existence because god himself said i shouldn't be alone god didn't want to be alone god was a lonely god and he just began to create angels but then that wasn't his sons and daughters and so he could he could only he couldn't fellowship with them they just worshiped him all the time he wanted sons and daughters that he could fellowship with and so now this whole thing of creating sons and daughters of god because it's not good to be alone god didn't want to be alone and then he says it's not good for man to be alone it's not safe to be alone it's not right for you to be alone it's not right for you to be lonely can you say amen and to make yourself lonely and to make yourself cut off from the body of jesus christ it's not a principle in god and i can tell you if you're staying home and not associated and not committed to a post of duty and committed also to fellowship with other saints and fellowship around the world and what the body of christ is doing whether worldwide or locally if you're saying i don't need any of that i don't want any of that listen you're going against the principle of god he says it's not good for you to be alone so you go against that you're going to find out why it's not good why your children maybe are not in church eventually why the family might be unraveling because you cut yourself off and the pastor went over and visited the guy who hadn't been in church in a long time and he didn't say nothing he just sat by the fire and they greeted one another but he didn't say nothing and he went up to the fire and took one of the sticks out hot coals and hot hot stick and he took it and set it over to the side and after about 10 minutes there wasn't any fire there wasn't any redness there wasn't anything in that stick but the fire was still going strong and when he laid it it'd become cold after a while become cold there was no fire in it and it's because he wasn't close to the fire pastor got up said god bless you that's all i wanted to say got his point across you do that you're going to hurt yourself in ecclesiastes 4 and i think they have the scripture for you here ecclesiastes 4 9 through 12 says two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor that's one of the benefits is two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor here's another scripture by the way that i used when i was single [Laughter] i had quite a few of them lord two are better than one i need a wife anyway two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labor for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up it's what is the principle it is not good for man to be alone two are better than one go back to the other one go back again i love this for if they fall one will lift the other fell out but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up you need brothers and sisters why would you want to battle the devil alone why would you want to go through a struggle alone it always is amazes me and i'll say it and i hope people are listening but it always amazes me when people can through go through the deepest darkest times of their life for whatever reason and we all have been through that and if you haven't you will go through it in life but some people at their at the time they need encouragement edification uh building up they need somebody else's strength because they have no strength at that time many people will distance themself from church from the body from everybody and they just get alone at the most time they need it and never understand that this is the time you need somebody so that you can help somebody can help you up so it's accountability next one says for two better than one if two lie together then they have heat but how can they be warm alone praise the lord all of us from the north can say amen to that we probably brought down in uh africa and those places maybe don't it's too hot they don't understand this scripture it's so hot brother tony that they're saying no no you get on the other side i'm too hot but in the north this scripture is good for us because you get cold unless you got somebody up close to you you do that too okay i was just teasing you're my friend and if one prevail against him oh my goodness if one prevail against him two shall withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken if one prevail against them well we got somebody prevailing against us and the worst spot that you can be in when the devil's prevailing against you is to be alone you need help you need strength you need the help in the body two shall withstand him and threefold be accountable to one another bible says confess your faults one to another you'd only do that you not only do that to keep the devil exposed but you go to another brother or sister someone you got confidence in and say listen i'm battling something i want you to join together with me because two shall withstand him the devil's fighting me i'm making a phone call today the devil's really fighting me i need your prayers today we're going to join together we're going to bind together listen there's a lot of people in the message even not even doing this but it's you're you're missing out you're missing out on a principle you're missing out on strength in the body call and be honest i'm struggling i've i've i've fallen i've made a mistake even be honest confess your faults one to another so the devil's exposed and say i need your strength right now i need the lord right now i need to bind together two shall withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken is anybody hearing what i'm saying tonight get yourself distant from the strength of other brothers and sisters then he goes on to say i think there's more to it isn't there is that it all right so the next one i want to go through these tonight and that's all the further we get is these scriptures so proverbs 11 14 where no counsel is the people fall but in the multitude of counselors there's safety amen i know some of you knew that scripture but there's some that don't there's some that maybe think in the message these scriptures are important every scripture is important when god restored me back to the word i can preach on every scripture in this bible and it's the word of god somebody said years ago you only need to preach on the ones the prophet commented on how terrible brother branham would have said that's crazy that's that's not true he he gave us these bibles back i can preach on any scripture in this bible and this one gets overlooked but it's got a truth to it for your life where no counsel is the people fall but in the multitude of counselors there's safety for if they fall where are we at here next one proverbs 24 6 for by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war and in multitude of counselors there is safety proverbs 12 15 the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise can i read it again the way of the fool which proverbs speaks quite a bit of the way of the fool is right in his own eyes he didn't got any input you need counsel so now he's bought into that just because he thought it it must be right now sometimes the lord can lead a person but isn't it better to see uh get some counsel and some input to see if you're going the right way because in your own eyes every man appears right and righteous in his own eyes all of you do it we all do it there's something about our human nature we if we're judging ourselves we always come out smelling pretty good we do come on now and the way of the fool is right in his own eyes but he that hearkeneth and that means listening to counsel is wise so we got safety in it we've got when people fall they can be built up we've got wisdom from counsel proverbs 15 22 the next one without counsel purposes are disappointed but in the multitude of counselors they are established can you imagine the depth of the wisdom of this scripture without counsel purposes are disappointed in other words you have a purpose you want to accomplish something you want to do something but sometimes you can set yourself up for disappointment because you maybe didn't get enough input in godly counsel so you set yourself up for disappointment you went it on your own didn't talk to me didn't go didn't consult the lord didn't consult someone else some good counsel in it and so without it your great purposes are disappointed you set yourself up for disappointment and there's no reason that we have to do that we got the word we got the message we got people in the congregation that's been through things already they've they've invested in things they've done things they've went through the school of hard knocks they've learned some things and all that wisdom is available to you young couples and young young people and even older couples it's available to you for free that's pretty good it's a good good price it's for free in the multitude of counselors purposes are established how many would rather have your purpose and what you're shooting for have it established on greater foundations okay just open yourself up to it might be just one or two people but just say i'm running this across you can you give me some input and give them full liberty tell me what you think about this bang bang bang bang give me your input a godly brother a godly sister galileo counsel research in the message of the hour everything you can because it's going to influence and establish your purpose now i'm feeling really good about this because it's established in the word of god and i got my brothers and sisters praying and after a little bit of time they're feeling a green light about it and i'm feeling stronger about it it's established by the word of god and good counsel and this is things that are important for youth deciding on who they marry oh is it ever what they do in life a home to buy a career to have how to raise the children i remember i said it a few weeks ago i know what it was so many young couples do not pull upon the wisdom of the older couples in the church to how to raise kids it's not like they have to tell you what to do but they've already been through it so why not use that free wisdom and say i got a kid and he's doing this and or she's doing that and you know he's pulling people's eyes out whatever you know he's got problems and you know did you ever have a kid that was kind of like this and i just want to know from you how did you learn from it what did you do about it i'm just open to some input it's okay they might give you a just a wisdom and you know how to direct that kid because every kid's different you have to adjust yourself to everyone but why can't we pull upon the resources that god has given us some of you listening your financial life has been in ruin for years because you won't get counsel from somebody that's godly and can give you direction on it you're still living from paycheck to paycheck because you're going to do it on your own you got purposes do you want them established don't set yourself up for another disappointment without counsel purposes are disappointed but in the multitude of counselors they are established i like that ephesians 5 21 here we go in the new testament submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god is that accountability is that accountability submitting yourself one to another in the fear of god i don't believe that it's just letting everybody tell you what to do we misinterpret it that way is that you just tell have all these people they're telling you what to do that's not it you find godly counsel and you submit yourself he's talking about the body of christ then he talks about the wife of course to the husband and the guy some husband to god the subject is submission the subject is accountability we don't as christians live our lives on our own without a submission to the word and in obedience to the word and a submission to the word and to one another congregations submit to your pastors pastors submit yourself to the congregation i want to read the whole quote that's what he said submission is a part of god's kingdom lucifer come out from the submission underneath god satan's principle is rebellion to headship and authority god's principle is submission to the right authority when he sends it hebrews 13 7 8 remember them which have the rule over you what what somebody what somebody has the rule over me paul's saying it in hebrews somebody has the rule over you remember them that have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow what follow i'm not going to follow anybody the bible says there's people to follow paul said follow me as i follow christ and i think that's the strong principle i'm not going to follow somebody who's not following christ i don't have to follow somebody who's not following christ but paul said follow me as i follow christ you see a deeper walk in christ you follow that say what whatever they're doing however they're praying i'm i've got my eyes open to people like that and i'm watching their lives i like what's happening they're getting good they're getting good prosperity how many knows joshua one says that you'll have good prosperity not just prosperity in life that's what the world has but good success good prosperity good successes in the lord regular successes in the world but good success is something for christians how many want good success good success and you see somebody else in good success godly and god's blessing their life in every way they don't say well i'll just do my own thing no he said they're doing something right praise the lord help me out here what are you doing let me come over and pick your brain or your soul or whatever you're doing something right it's an obedience to say god can speak through someone else remember them they have the ruler who have spoken to you the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation conversation is your manner of life and so you're looking at them and watching their the end of their manner of life it's not what they speak over the pulpit it's not what they speak to the word of god anybody can speak the word of god this is why i preach about preachers and everybody else it's not just that we have the message in the word but character comes with it can you say amen the people ought to not only watch how good the preacher preaches and he's a great preacher and he's very polished and he can really bring that word and bring the mysteries i'm looking at that man's life as well i love what he preaches but let me see the end of the manner of his life let me see his attitude is pride growing up with his knowledge of the word i'm out i won't follow it because i'm not just following somebody that preaches the message today i'm following i'm looking for the character of king david i'm looking for the character of king jesus this message does not just produce doctrinal truth can you say mine it produces the character of jesus christ knowledge puffeth up knowledge will make a man more proudful knowledge will make a church and a man say we're advanced above all the other messed churches and when you start giving that attitude i'm out i'm not following it i'm not supporting it and may that never happen here may we stay humble before the lord that as we raise in revelation we raise in humility as well god help us to be that way we've seen so much of this pride even in our own ranks i'm so tired of it you may know all the mysteries of god and be able to preach in much better than i ever could but let me see the end of your conversation if you're preaching the word let me see the end of your life let me see your manner of life let me see your attitude let it be churches can get lifted up in pride that we're the best in the world preachers kadeta nobody's preaching stuff like this you're gonna have to come to this church to hear it what a shame may we stay away from all that if a church stays real humble brother brahm says he says you'll see the power of god working in that church fathers need to stay humble husbands need to stay humble wives need to stay humble remember them to have the rule over you and then the next scripture says what i'm preaching about hebrews 13 8 everybody knows that we don't have to put up jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he doesn't change in his character in his miracles he can do anything he did back then he'll do it again today if he lived that way 2000 years ago we're going to see him live that way today it's not a new version of jesus it's not a new lord it's not a new jesus christ that's not a bible it's the same nature jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever first oh wait let me continue on hebrews 13 17 just a few scriptures down hebrews 13 17. next one obey them later he said obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch over your souls as they that must give an account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you so the guy that's administering it should not do it for any other mode of a reason and they should do it with joy and not with grief for if they do it that way it's unprofitable for you so this is a guy that's bringing it and watching over your souls but then obey them they had rule over you see that character you see that life you see that the real care for your souls submit yourselves for they watch over your souls next one first peter 5. this is the last one here likewise you're younger just checking the time likewise you're younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another have i read scriptures tonight that prove christians should be accountable likewise younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore unto the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time now if he just talked about obeying those that have the rule over and he's in this he said that other scriptures but then he he comes back in in in first peter here and he's bringing the theme ye younger submit yourself until unto the elder be subject one to another and be then he comes and be humble now then verse seven says humble yourself casting all your care upon him for he careth for you look at the benefits that come from being submissive from being the the younger submitting to the elder look at the submission there's a care for you because god cares god can care for you and your needs through that it's how god works can you say amen casting all your care upon him for he cares for you be sober be village vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour do these things submit yourself be clothed with humility be subject to one another because why you have an adversary and you don't want to go at him alone now i believe a brother or sister that's full of faith i don't want to weaken this tonight sometimes i've seen students and people in the alone time grab a hold of the faith of god and they come against the devil because you are a one-man army i believe that you could have the faith to do it but you don't have to go it alone because your adversary the devil is rowing seeking whom he may devour because of that submit yourself to one another be subject be clothed in humanity humility and god giveth grace to the humble wonderful so it seems that when you choose to be unaccountable to god with all these scriptures now i'm going to find a place to close now it seems that when you choose to be unaccountable with godly input and counsel it's a danger zone that you enter into when you live this private life with no other eyes checking what you're doing you set yourself up for sin for stupid decisions for marrying the wrong person for never growing further in the lord by being unaccountable look at examples that we have today a girl meets a guy on the internet doesn't know him from sam develops a relationship with him he says he's a christian doesn't check him out doesn't know anything that's that's going on right now there's there's situations and then she won't listen to the the dad now she won't listen to anybody this is it and then she's gonna proceed unaccountable to anybody not watching it not looking at it close my she's she's gambling with her future don't you don't have to gamble with your future you can get good counsel you can look to the word of god you can have a strong foundation a girl meets a guy in the end a guy meets a girl on the internet and that's how it all happens it's a completely a girl starts to text a guy and there's no accountability to those texts they just text privately a lot can be said that's under the outside of the radar that shouldn't get said when there's no accountability in a relationship i know some of you don't like that and some of my own family i don't even know i'm not trying to preach anybody i'm just saying i was preaching this 32 years ago and i'm going to continue to preach accountability in guy girl relationships in marriages marriage husbands and wife need to be accountable to one another they don't need to live a private life away from one another this accountability carries throughout our entire life a family needs to be accountable to their local church with their attendance and their offerings can you say amen there's an accountability that goes with this kingdom of god and a girl that meets a guy or a guy that meets a girl and it's a completely there is no counsel there is no input it's completely on their own i disagree with that because they're missing out on god being able to guide that relationship with other sources as well not just on their own guess what a preacher refuses to fellowship with other preachers and let his congregation fell up and let his congregation fellowship with other churches he refuses he holds them back from doing it it's dangerous it's a danger zone a boy spends all of his savings whole life savings on an un unreliable investment or rings up 30 000 in a credit for debt without consulting with anybody puts his life under a shadow of debt the rest many years down the road where he buys a fancy car way more than he can afford so you're thinking well is he talking about situations in the church no i come up with these myself but every one of us are susceptible to make foolish decisions when we don't seek the counsel of the lord you young people some of the older ones you've learned this but the young people listen to me you'll never go wrong in your relationships and your money in every part you'll never go around consulting the lord completely living in the light and consulting with good solid godly senior people all these decisions come from people that are unaccountable and living with no counsel say well just can't we just if we just have the holy ghost isn't that enough in my experience we have a mind i may not put this out to on the archive because i'm speaking personally and some of these things are just what i've learned we have a soul and if that's been converted by the holy ghost the power is in there to be able to guide a life can you say amen but you have a mind and you have flesh and that mind can be influenced or that mind cannot be taught yet it's just like i was saying to somebody the other day about a a young teenager receiving the holy spirit when they're young oh how wonderful it is when they receive the true holy spirit when they're young they say lord fill me with the holy ghost i need you right now i'm not going to wait to some other day i may not have the opportunity so they get filled with about 14 years old and the parents start to expect them to act like this fully matured person and christian at 14. that's unfair because even though god's done something real in their life they're still 14 years old in the head they still think 14 year old thoughts so you watch them doing something in just a little bit of offer saying how can you do that and be a holy ghost-filled christian you got to be careful of that you got to watch your tongue because they've got to grow as a human being in some areas even though god's dealt with their heart or god's filled them so it's a tragedy then to to push them to a certain level of of expectation that you should be a christian now and all these expectations come because you're a christian now none of us like to be put under unrealistic expectations how many had parents that put you under unrealistic expectations some of our kids aren't raising their hand because mom and dad's sitting beside i love it amen you can tell this subject i love it i could talk all night about it but i'm going to close the worldly principle is just we have the if we have the spirit of god we have the power within us but we have a mind and that answer that says what else do we need i've had couples say i'm not quite done yet that couple say they both got the holy ghost and that's all the council you need to give them before they're married they've got everything they need to make it through the journey i disagree with that not completely because i know that if they've been filled with the holy spirit they have the power to be able to live but you see that i've had a couple say i know we don't have a job i don't have i know we don't have anything to support the family right now but we have the holy ghost and we have love and with those two things that's all we need a lot of parents that said that and went through so many things looked back and said it's just how that's lacking wisdom in it okay i won't ask for a show of hands but you just say no no no you should approach it with a little bit more maturity than that you need a job okay because something happens in your love and you have kids and they eat right mom i ate i had to eat something you have children then you have another one then you have another one then you have sometimes it's they just keep coming and then you have to counsel and let them know what's happening and like why they keep coming find out the reason why and there's more malice to feed and it's it's responsibility that comes with it but if you be accountable to the lord early on god can give you direction not just that you're filled with the spirit but in your mind and your spirit you can lay down some biblical principles to say i'm going to follow these guidelines through the counsel of god's word and establish something and have a little bit so you don't have to be a rich man to get married you have to be rich i'm not people think well you got to be a millionaire before you can even get married to a girl my goodness no there's no end to the rules around here just in love i mean you don't have to kill it i mean my goodness you and brother barry killing romance killing love all the time we're just love we can live on love if we don't have any food we'll live on love not trying to kill anything i'm trying to get you to approach life accountable to say lord how can i jesus is all about foundations and preparations it's in the book of matthew the guy built his house on the sand guy built his house on a rock jesus is all about foundations don't build your life on sand build your life on the rock of revelation jesus is all about preparation she said what man go at the war it doesn't sit down first and count the cost can i go against this army and win instead of just we're going out we're going right now i don't know if we can do it but we're going to no jesus is about preparations what man goeth to build a house or building and doesn't sit down and count the cost can i afford this can do i have the right pieces in place can i step out and make this decision to build a house you don't say we're doing it we're doing it i don't know how we're going to do it but we're doing it praise god no jesus is not about that jesus about prepare for something lay the foundations for something and then wait until god's timing now you get that green light i'm going to build this house i'm going to marry that woman i'm going to marry that guy those good things come to those who are willing to wait a little bit and the bible teaches that as well well we'll just follow our heart this follow your heart i heard a song on the radio the other day follow your heart no no it's not true it's a lie for jeremiah 17 9 says the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it i the lord searched the heart i try the reigns even to give every man according to his ways according to the fruit of his doings oh you found that one to the fruit of his doings it's so funny his doings you're going to have doings in life all your doings can be established on the word or your doings can be not established in the word and you're actually going to either the fruit of your doings how about let god lead you how about be accountable so that the fruit is a better fruit that the lord is pleased with we don't follow our heart we proverbs 4 23 says to keep our heart protect our heart follow the holy spirit but don't follow your heart make your heart accountable to the word of god because your emotions can kick in and it's your emotions going to tell you do all kinds of things your flesh can kick in your hormones can kick in everything gets in this has to be something deeper in your life besides your hormones and your flesh and your feelings don't be don't act like you don't have feelings you do don't deny who you are as a human being but there has to be a solid thing that leads feelings and emotions and thoughts and that's the word of god let it lead your life father thank you lord thank you that you've given us your word god the word is so specific now this teaching tonight lord i pray that many young people see it not just young people but maybe if someone's older and they haven't seen it yet they see it lord that even though our prophet when he was talking about micah and the prophets and i read it today and i didn't get to it tonight i'll take another service on this but i read it where brother branham says now i know the bible says in the multitude of counselors and safety he says that's not always true it depends on the counselors so it's not always in the multitude of counselors of safety if the counselors are wrong so we have to really seek god to find even the right counsel in our lives that's godly that has the character of god that's the wisdom of god and it's based upon the message and the word of god not someone's ideas help us lord to be accountable help us to be submissive help us to be open lord to the light to be shined on every area of our lives help us to confess our faults one to another help us to go and consult you in every matter of our life father what do you want me to do in this situation lord what do you want what decision do you want me to make and i've seen it over and over again when a couple or one seeking the will of god when they'll just put that prayer sincerely and they'll be neutral about it when they put that there i've seen you come and answer so crystal clear this is my answer for my son and daughter you do it lord because those that are seeking your will the sons of god really want your will and they're neutral until they find it you're more than willing to show them what your divine will is i love you tonight father thank you for my life and with my sometimes i didn't listen and i went through that too sometimes i made a decision and i wasn't accountable forgive me that lord may we all father take our mistakes and say we've learned from them we've learned there's no way that we want to live outside of the correction and the boundaries and the presence the atmosphere of being spoken to by god never would we ever want to live outside of that ever again may this seed that i've planted tonight bring forth great fruit in the congregation i pray in jesus name amen amen thank you for staying alone
