[0:00] the lord and whose hope the lord is for
[0:03] he shall be as a tree planted by the
[0:05] waters and that spreadeth out her roots
[0:08] by the river and shall not see when
[0:11] heat cometh but her leaf shall be green
[0:14] and shall not be careful in the year of
[0:16] drought neither shall cease
[0:19] from yielding fruit amen may god add its
[0:22] blessings to the word god bless you may
[0:24] be seated tonight just want to remind
[0:26] you for the couple's sweetheart banquet
[0:28] saturday night and uh saturday i think
[0:31] at five and if you could just let sister
[0:33] kendall know and make those plans we're
[0:35] really looking forward there's about 70
[0:37] coming so it's a good turnout and we're
[0:39] very excited about uh what the lord has
[0:41] for us with brother chris
[0:43] and maybe some songs and different
[0:44] things as well so we're looking forward
[0:46] to that time together to just
[0:48] increase our love for our mates more and
[0:51] more through the lord so we're just
[0:52] looking forward to that tonight i'm
[0:54] taking jeremiah 17 and this scripture
[0:57] was sent to me after
[0:59] uh sunday service and i'm just being
[1:01] honest i didn't know that
[1:04] god had referred to this this way again
[1:06] in another book of the bible i did not
[1:07] know this was there but boaz sent it to
[1:09] me so brother boaz actually you should
[1:11] be preaching this because you're the one
[1:12] that found the scripture so we just
[1:14] invite you to come up right now and take
[1:16] the service over how about that
[1:18] but i thought it was very unique that
[1:20] the prophet jeremiah seen the same
[1:23] vision as david in first saw psalms 1
[1:27] about a tree being planted by the rivers
[1:29] of living water and i thought it was
[1:31] amazing and there's actually another
[1:33] reference to it in another prophet
[1:36] and so when you have prophets seeing the
[1:38] same vision
[1:39] this close then you know god's trying to
[1:41] tell us something
[1:43] amen and i believe it's a vision of the
[1:45] bride tree when they see this tree i
[1:47] believe it's a vision of the bride dream
[1:49] our prophet in this hour seen the vision
[1:51] of the bride tree and he preached the
[1:53] bride tree and the restoration of the
[1:55] bride tree so these scriptures are not
[1:58] just little
[1:59] sunday school scriptures but they're
[2:01] actually foretelling and speaking of the
[2:03] believers particularly of the last day
[2:06] who are thriving and are planted in the
[2:08] right place and that are that are chosen
[2:11] and predestinated to walk in the word
[2:14] and become adopted sons and daughters of
[2:15] god and when they're planted in the
[2:17] right place then they have all these
[2:19] characteristics and i wanted to read it
[2:21] again because i was amazed how much it
[2:23] just elaborated a little bit more than
[2:25] psalms 1
[2:26] and i want you to read again it says for
[2:28] he verse 8 shall be as a tree planted by
[2:31] the waters and that spreadeth out her
[2:33] roots by the river and that's what we
[2:35] talked about sunday
[2:37] and shall not see when heat cometh but
[2:39] her leaf shall be green and shall not be
[2:41] careful in the year of drought neither
[2:43] shall cease from yielding fruit so it's
[2:45] just it just elaborates just a little
[2:47] bit more on what the scripture says in
[2:49] psalms 1. and so his roots are go have
[2:52] gone down close to the river the roots
[2:55] receive constant moisture from the river
[2:57] and the water
[2:58] and it seems that just it gives more
[3:00] details and
[3:01] i read it today in the amplified i was
[3:03] going to read that to you as well this
[3:05] way this is the way verse 8 is read in
[3:07] the amplified
[3:09] for he will be
[3:10] nourished like a tree planted by the
[3:12] waters
[3:14] that spreads out its roots by the river
[3:16] and will not fear the heat when it comes
[3:20] but its leaves will be green and moist
[3:24] and it will not be anxious and concerned
[3:27] in the year of drought
[3:29] nor stop bearing fruit
[3:32] so i thought it was amazing that brother
[3:34] rap elaborated on worry so much last
[3:37] sunday and talked about
[3:39] that subject so much and here we have it
[3:41] right in the scripture for this
[3:43] believer or this tree and type of a
[3:45] believer showing that it will not be
[3:47] anxious and concerned it will not be in
[3:50] worry if you're planted close to the
[3:53] water and receiving that life source
[3:56] then you're not living a life of worry
[3:58] that you're not worried about a drought
[4:00] this tree is not worried about a drought
[4:02] coming
[4:03] because he doesn't have to worry about a
[4:04] drought
[4:06] he's not dependent upon those rains and
[4:08] we'll just get into that in just a
[4:09] minute but his leaves are green and
[4:10] moist and he will not fear the heat when
[4:13] it comes so this is a just amazing how
[4:16] this just is manifested in such a way or
[4:20] brought to us in such a word picture in
[4:21] such a revelation to show us and it
[4:24] should tell us this is where i want to
[4:26] live this is where i want to be
[4:29] this is god speaking of a holy
[4:31] ghost-filled christian
[4:33] this is where when he's planted in the
[4:35] right place this is the fruit that comes
[4:37] from his life and it certainly is taking
[4:40] away our fears it certainly is taking
[4:42] away our worries can you say amen
[4:45] and so um you know when we speak of
[4:48] they're just that part about no fear or
[4:51] no worry it's just not there in this
[4:53] tree even when no rain is on the outside
[4:56] and the rain in the bible saints rain
[4:59] types blessings
[5:01] rain types blessings
[5:03] so this christian
[5:04] is not dependent on the blessings of the
[5:08] lord we enjoy the blessings of the lord
[5:12] but we don't live on the blessings of
[5:14] the lord
[5:15] our our
[5:16] moisture and our are thriving and our
[5:19] growth comes from something deeper
[5:21] because we know the rains can be there
[5:24] but then the rains can stop
[5:26] and sometimes in our life the rain can
[5:29] stop for a long time and that's called a
[5:31] drought
[5:33] and so if this tree was dependent upon
[5:36] that rain of blessings then it would
[5:38] give out in the drought it would be
[5:40] nervous it would become anxious it would
[5:42] begin to die but because it's not
[5:44] dependent on the blessings of the lord
[5:46] and our prophet taught us that the
[5:48] blessings is different than the power of
[5:50] god he elaborated on those things to
[5:52] show us so that we won't be dependent on
[5:55] some just blessings because blessings we
[5:57] can in life we can have we can have
[6:00] things that we think is the blessings of
[6:02] god but sometimes our trials can be
[6:04] blessings in disguise
[6:07] and sometimes when we have a drought if
[6:09] we're rooted in the lord the drought can
[6:11] be a good time to grow as well
[6:14] only in this type of tree now can you
[6:16] say man a tree that's got its roots way
[6:18] down is that we find in a drought
[6:20] sometimes you're through trials and
[6:22] winds and the things that happen on the
[6:25] outside back to you those things can
[6:28] actually be when your roots are deep
[6:29] actually it can make your roots go
[6:31] deeper
[6:33] so what a wonderful thing to see that
[6:35] but people actually depend people live
[6:38] dependent on the blessings of god uh is
[6:41] everything and when everything is right
[6:43] in their life and when the rain is
[6:45] falling and when everything is good then
[6:48] they're happy
[6:50] when everything's working out all right
[6:53] then they can be happy
[6:55] it when everything is just coming
[6:56] together just so well and lining up so
[6:59] well and that's the times we thank god
[7:01] it's just all lining up good and we're
[7:03] happy about it and we thank god for it
[7:05] and we should do that but see growth in
[7:07] the lord maturity in the lord is that
[7:09] when that's not lining up just right and
[7:11] we don't understand why it's not lining
[7:13] up we still are rooted by the tree the
[7:15] tree is rooted by the rivers of water
[7:18] it's not like we're going to die from
[7:19] that it's not like we're losing our joy
[7:21] from that because we know during those
[7:23] times we're a predestinated son of god
[7:25] anyway god's going to direct us anyway
[7:28] god is going to keep us anyway
[7:31] and so people live dependent on the
[7:33] blessings of the lord and i'm not
[7:35] against the blessing i love the
[7:36] blessings of god but a lot of times it's
[7:39] what we view as blessings
[7:42] it's what we view as god's blessings and
[7:44] a lot of times blessings we view it is
[7:47] if things are just going well and coming
[7:49] in line and perfect
[7:52] can you say man
[7:53] so we have to really become a deeper
[7:56] christian to realize what is god's
[7:57] blessings because we look at it that we
[7:59] got a lot of money and we got all the
[8:01] money to pay bills and we look at it as
[8:03] far as financial price prosperity and it
[8:06] is
[8:07] sometimes
[8:09] sometimes we can be just as blessed
[8:13] spiritually and not have a dime to our
[8:15] name
[8:17] and you won't hear that on any tv
[8:19] preachers i guarantee you that
[8:22] it's god's will for some people to be
[8:24] poor and i believe i'm quoting the
[8:25] prophet there it's god's will because we
[8:27] can't view
[8:28] our spiritual life like a lot of the tv
[8:31] preachers tell us we can't view all of
[8:33] our spirituality where we stand with the
[8:35] lord on just finances we can't view it
[8:37] just as that we can't see i'm blessed if
[8:39] that's happening and i'm not blessed we
[8:41] can't view it carnally like that because
[8:43] we realize god he can prosper us but the
[8:47] most important prosperity we receive as
[8:50] a believer is where we're at spiritually
[8:53] and if we lose sight of that we'll view
[8:55] his blessings by natural carnal things
[8:59] are we listening tonight
[9:02] so then i can be if everything's going
[9:04] right then i'll serve the lord that's
[9:06] how some people feel about it
[9:08] if i feel good then i'll go to church
[9:11] you think that you think that's not true
[9:13] people go to church if they feel if
[9:15] everything's happened good for the week
[9:17] and they feel good and they're feeling
[9:19] healthy
[9:22] then we're going to be at church
[9:27] it's it's about feelings it's about
[9:29] emotions
[9:31] if everything's going good with my job
[9:33] then i'll come and sing and open my
[9:35] heart and worship the lord
[9:37] you really should come and worship with
[9:39] more strength towards the lord when you
[9:42] lose your job
[9:45] see this is counter culture isn't it
[9:48] i won't be there tonight brother paul i
[9:49] lost my job and if i lost my job i'll
[9:52] probably lose everything and i don't
[9:53] know where this is going to go so i
[9:55] won't be there
[9:56] i just don't even feel like worshiping
[9:58] now you might chuckle at that but that's
[10:00] the type of conversations in 30 years of
[10:02] pastoring i've had that sometime
[10:05] and sometimes i have to bite my tongue
[10:07] to not say it and correct it and say no
[10:09] if you've gone through this or you lost
[10:11] a loved one or you're going through a
[10:13] depressing time the very place best
[10:15] place you could be is in the presence of
[10:17] the lord you're letting satan rob you of
[10:20] what you really should be doing that's
[10:22] the times we call out on god that's the
[10:24] time job says you know what i don't have
[10:26] a clue what's going on and my wife's
[10:29] telling me to curse god and die but i'm
[10:31] going to go to church and i'm going to
[10:32] worship and i can you say man i'm a
[10:35] little bit angry here but i'm not going
[10:37] to stop my worship before god because
[10:40] the lord giveth and the lord taketh away
[10:43] blessed be the name of the lord that's
[10:46] the time to worship the lord
[10:48] but we can't view his blessings as being
[10:51] the things that come from the outside
[10:53] and this tree is basically saying this
[10:55] believer is saying that i am not afraid
[10:59] of a drought in my life because i am not
[11:01] dependent on the moisture of those rains
[11:04] i'm dependent on the moisture coming
[11:06] from the river
[11:10] the drought hits
[11:12] and there's no blessings
[11:15] and
[11:17] if there's rain in our life it's all
[11:19] good but you see if the drought hits
[11:21] that's when a drought can be a real test
[11:24] it can bring worry
[11:25] if you're dependent on those blessings
[11:27] and this tree is not worried about a
[11:28] drought if it rains or if it doesn't i'm
[11:31] good
[11:32] why because he's planted by the source
[11:34] of moisture it's not that it comes from
[11:37] the top
[11:38] but the roots are way down deep
[11:41] connected to the moisture of the river
[11:43] if there if there's money if there's no
[11:46] money
[11:47] we pray we worship god
[11:50] amen
[11:52] if people treat me right or people treat
[11:55] me wrong we we serve god we worship god
[11:58] if i'm in pain or i'm not in pain it
[12:01] doesn't change my worship before the
[12:03] lord
[12:04] if the job ends or if they like me a lot
[12:06] at work it doesn't matter it doesn't
[12:08] waver can you say amen because i'm not
[12:10] looking to the outside things going good
[12:13] or going bad can you say man i'm not
[12:16] dependent on that and that's not
[12:18] dictating
[12:20] my joy
[12:22] i say that because
[12:24] for all of us we might as well admit
[12:27] that
[12:28] things of life affect and take away our
[12:31] joy
[12:32] and we should never let
[12:34] outside rain or not rain or whatever
[12:37] take away our joy
[12:38] don't let nobody steal your joy
[12:42] don't let anything steal your joy
[12:44] you say well i lost it no you still got
[12:47] it but you're just letting it being
[12:48] clouded over by thinking something was
[12:51] gonna go this certain way i thought the
[12:53] job was gonna i thought it was gonna go
[12:55] this way and so i'm just not happy and
[12:58] and you know you can say with trying to
[13:00] be careful not to offend tonight you can
[13:03] can say it's very much like a little
[13:04] baby who's only happy when it gets with
[13:08] what it wants
[13:10] and when it doesn't get when a
[13:11] two-year-old does not get what she wants
[13:15] she can turn on you pretty quick he can
[13:17] turn on you pretty quick
[13:19] i mean i just i
[13:21] i get in trouble so i gave
[13:23] ellie a sucker where's she at she gone
[13:26] i gave her a sucker in the office
[13:28] because when we left from the house i
[13:30] had to take her to church tonight and we
[13:32] had to get in the truck so this sucker
[13:33] had to be taken away so this smiley girl
[13:36] had it taken away and she changed to a
[13:38] different countenance
[13:43] and so then i thought well
[13:45] let's give we got in the office i gave
[13:47] her another one
[13:49] and then that had to be taken away from
[13:50] her but it's kind of funny to watch
[13:52] because this is christians sometimes
[13:56] this is christian sometimes these are
[13:58] baby christians and they can change in a
[14:01] moment they're so happy it's so smiling
[14:04] something changes in their life somebody
[14:05] doesn't treat them well somebody posted
[14:07] something that they didn't like
[14:09] and in a moment's time their countenance
[14:11] changed and they become this different
[14:12] person that's
[14:14] babyhood that's a baby christian
[14:18] we let things affect our emotions so
[14:20] much family problems and family issues
[14:23] and
[14:24] and marriage issues and god is looking
[14:27] for that consistent being planted
[14:30] staying filled with the word of god
[14:31] staying with our mind on the word of god
[14:33] so that just doesn't bump us around as
[14:35] much and we're not dependent on the
[14:37] blessings or if the drought comes we're
[14:40] still receiving the from the
[14:42] source we have a source
[14:45] and if we're connected to it it never
[14:47] ends
[14:48] that's right
[14:49] it never gives up
[14:52] praise the lord amen so now let me just
[14:55] take this a little a different step here
[14:56] tonight i won't be long but i want you
[14:58] to be listening real well i just
[15:00] finishing this up from sunday if you
[15:02] don't mind and you won't have the quotes
[15:04] tonight up i didn't have time to get
[15:05] them to them i didn't want to i want to
[15:07] give them the night off so just be
[15:08] listening close to a few quotes that i
[15:10] have
[15:10] so now you know that even a good plant
[15:13] as we talked about sunday we're talking
[15:14] about the tree plant
[15:16] you know that even a good plant taken
[15:18] away from water or not getting water can
[15:21] start withering can start getting sticky
[15:24] can start getting brown leaves instead
[15:26] of
[15:27] as it speaks in scripture here of a
[15:29] flourishing a leaf being green we know
[15:32] that a plant can get dried up we know a
[15:34] plant can become ugly when it was
[15:36] beautiful before we know a plant can get
[15:39] hard instead of soft instead of gentle
[15:42] the petals can become
[15:44] gentle but they can become hard and it's
[15:47] all because of a lack of water if that's
[15:49] true in the natural it's true in the
[15:51] spiritual
[15:52] it can be shriveled up it could be
[15:54] it can be closed and look dead and
[15:57] eventually become dead and so i i think
[16:00] sometimes we can see
[16:02] pretty good when a person is
[16:04] not near the water of life
[16:08] i think it becomes pretty quickly
[16:10] evident when someone is not planted
[16:13] close to the rivers of living water
[16:16] there's a clear evidence of someone
[16:18] being distant from the spirit and from
[16:21] the word
[16:22] and feeding on other things i'm going to
[16:24] say it again it becomes pretty quickly
[16:26] evident in our if it does for a plant
[16:29] like some of our plants within just a
[16:31] few days you can see them
[16:33] shrivel up and they've got brown edges
[16:35] on some of the petals and that's for
[16:37] lack of water sometimes if that happens
[16:40] in the natural that's what happens to
[16:42] your life in the spiritual and it
[16:43] becomes real clear in your life in my
[16:46] life is that when we get a little bit
[16:48] too far away from the waters of life
[16:50] then we start to have these
[16:52] characteristics sometimes to show that
[16:55] we're distant from the word we're
[16:57] distant from uh from the spirit of god
[17:00] and we're feeding on other things
[17:03] usually you can tell what a person is
[17:05] feeding on
[17:07] it shows up in the attitude it shows up
[17:10] in the reactions
[17:13] hey how you doing i'm fine
[17:18] [Laughter]
[17:21] i'm doing fine
[17:23] leave me alone
[17:24] these these characteristics of getting
[17:26] edgy and bitter and angry
[17:30] and feeling your feelings are sensitive
[17:33] and you're easily offended
[17:36] for a believer and you say well no
[17:38] believers act like that
[17:40] all right
[17:43] for a believer it's a direct giveaway
[17:46] that you have become disconnected
[17:49] because you will never get
[17:51] a a a
[17:53] a pattern of those results
[17:56] you might have an instant moment where
[17:58] you get angry because that's anger's a
[17:59] part of us
[18:01] it's an emotion can you say amen
[18:03] remember the bible says be angry and sin
[18:05] not our emotions can rise up over things
[18:08] even over sin can you say amen but you
[18:10] see now he says be angry and sin not
[18:12] it's where that anger goes we can have a
[18:15] moment when we see patterns popping up
[18:17] in a life we know that someone in our
[18:20] own lives we know that you can never be
[18:23] completely connected and feeding on the
[18:25] word of life and the spirit of life and
[18:27] staying in there every day and have all
[18:30] of these patterns of sensitivity and
[18:33] easily offended and outraged anger and
[18:36] bitterness and being edgy all the time
[18:39] and becoming bitter even towards god
[18:41] there is no way you get that fruit from
[18:45] a person that's connected to the source
[18:47] of life there's no way you get it
[18:51] doesn't james say that a tree cannot put
[18:53] forth this fruit in that it can't happen
[18:56] it can't bring forth these different
[18:58] things it's not to be so if you're
[19:00] connected to the water of life and you
[19:02] stay connected there are fruits that
[19:04] come from that
[19:07] and so this isn't complicated this isn't
[19:09] complicated we have his word
[19:12] and i want to get into just a little bit
[19:14] we may not have time tonight but
[19:16] you know
[19:17] god told israel
[19:19] when he received the word when he gave
[19:21] the word to moses on mount sinai that's
[19:24] a very signific is where they were in
[19:26] mount sinai and the word came to the
[19:28] prophet it was such a pivotal point for
[19:30] israel and god actually after it
[19:32] happened they received the word to live
[19:34] by he kept pointing them back to that
[19:36] and that was a pivotal point for them
[19:38] but when he talked to them in
[19:39] deuteronomy 6 which we only have time to
[19:41] read tonight when he said it
[19:43] said to them when he spoke to them after
[19:45] they'd received the word it wasn't just
[19:47] they received the word and it wasn't
[19:49] just that they would uh that they would
[19:51] have the word but he said now
[19:54] i'm gonna warn you when you come into
[19:56] the land the first thing you you should
[19:59] give
[20:00] all of your heart to the word of god and
[20:02] you should meditate upon it day and
[20:03] night you should teach it your to your
[20:05] children you should put it upon the
[20:07] doorpost of your house you should put it
[20:10] upon here you should put it and so so
[20:12] you should become saturated with the
[20:15] word of god they could say well we've
[20:17] got the word from a prophet that's
[20:19] enough but to god it wasn't enough
[20:21] because he says when you get into the
[20:23] promised land a couple things will
[20:25] happen you're going to prosper you're
[20:27] going to have goodly lands and guess
[20:28] what if you keep your eyes on that
[20:31] you're going to forget my precepts
[20:32] you're going to forget me
[20:34] so in order not to forget me this word
[20:37] can't just be on tablets this word has
[20:39] to be in your heart every day
[20:42] do you get it and god's saying that you
[20:44] know teach your children from the time
[20:46] they're young teach your grandchildren
[20:48] get it in front of them post it on the
[20:50] door post have the word up everywhere
[20:52] talk about it he says talk about it in
[20:55] your home constantly why is god saying
[20:57] this we've got the word from a prophet
[20:59] that's all we need no it wasn't all you
[21:01] need you've got to get that word
[21:03] integrated into your life you've got to
[21:05] get that word into your mind you've got
[21:07] to get that word into your soul you've
[21:09] got to get it in your spirit and you've
[21:11] got to keep it in your spirit for two
[21:13] reasons when you prosper you tend to
[21:15] forget god
[21:18] listen god knows human nature
[21:20] i said god knows human nature and when
[21:23] people prosper with blessings they tend
[21:26] to forget
[21:28] the precepts of god so the first reason
[21:31] he says you have to keep it you have to
[21:33] integrate it into your life every day
[21:35] speak about it teach it to your children
[21:37] let it be the forefront of your thoughts
[21:40] the second reasons he says
[21:42] so that you won't be overtaken with
[21:43] idols because when your heart gets
[21:45] distant and when your heart is away from
[21:47] the word you're more susceptible to idol
[21:50] worship
[21:52] and god says i am one lord
[21:54] and i want you to be single in your
[21:56] worship towards me that heart beling
[21:59] belongs to me and he says i want you to
[22:01] serve me with all your heart
[22:03] soul mind and strength
[22:06] there's only one way to serve god and
[22:08] that's all of you
[22:10] and god said that because he knows your
[22:11] heart and the heart can be easily swayed
[22:14] by other gods and other things to
[22:16] worship
[22:17] brother paul i don't worship any other
[22:18] gods tonight you don't you don't you
[22:21] have to be careful that because our
[22:22] heart can be swayed to worshiping and
[22:24] giving our attention and given our all
[22:27] and giving our heart to something else
[22:30] and eventually our worship to something
[22:32] else
[22:33] and god said i'm a i've got an exclusive
[22:36] i want an exclusive relationship and i
[22:38] want all my worship from your heart to
[22:40] come to me
[22:42] i am one lord there's not three gods
[22:44] there's not four gods there's a and he
[22:46] doesn't want you sharing the worship of
[22:49] the depths of your heart with other
[22:50] things
[22:52] so that's the reason he warned him and i
[22:53] thought i mentioned that we'll go into
[22:55] it more at another time but this is the
[22:57] reason why we can't live on feelings but
[23:00] we have to be rooted in the word of god
[23:03] and we know when someone is away and so
[23:05] now i'm just going to bring up israel in
[23:08] that wilderness experience we realized
[23:10] they ran out of water and many times the
[23:12] prophet refers to the time when they ran
[23:14] out of water and typed it and showed is
[23:17] that that's in our lives when we when we
[23:19] don't have water coming to our lives he
[23:22] said israel they got to murmuring there
[23:24] in the wilderness and fussing and
[23:26] carrying on
[23:27] cut the water supply off and maybe
[23:29] that's the ma what's the matter with the
[23:31] church tonight doing too much fussing
[23:34] and grumbling around
[23:35] the water supply is cut off you know i
[23:37] travel around the world a lot and one of
[23:39] the most stickiest nastiest places to
[23:41] try to lay down is in the desert
[23:43] everything there has got a sticker on it
[23:45] you know why
[23:46] everything every every kind of little
[23:48] old weed's a cactus you can't lay down
[23:50] nowhere it's sticking you the reason of
[23:52] it is that it ain't got no water water
[23:54] makes it soft where there's lots of
[23:56] water you don't have any thorns and
[23:58] thistles where there's lots of water and
[24:01] i tell you brother you take an old
[24:02] church
[24:03] that's dry in its bone and no holy ghost
[24:06] in it and no salvation and no divine
[24:08] healing no power of god no shouting no
[24:11] joy and it's always this oh she done
[24:14] this and he done this and he done that
[24:17] sticker sticker sticker sticker
[24:20] and what you need is a good
[24:21] old-fashioned outpouring a gusher of the
[24:23] holy ghost hallelujah and soften up a
[24:26] little bit amen that means so be it
[24:28] amen's to be so be it branham tabernacle
[24:31] needs a good dose of that too that's
[24:33] right oh that is right brother brian
[24:35] gets pretty excited here and he goes
[24:37] amen oh i'm having a good time up here
[24:39] my clothes fit me just exactly right
[24:42] brother higa bathum my clothes fit right
[24:44] my collar's not too big my shirt fits
[24:46] just feels good even my wife's not here
[24:51] and i can just have a glorious time
[24:53] oh don't tell her no
[24:57] i just added that and i thought it was
[24:58] comical that obviously she comments on
[25:01] his clothes a lot but he says all my
[25:02] clothes are fitting right
[25:04] his wife's not there to criticize
[25:07] he's having a good time and then don't
[25:08] tell her i said that
[25:11] oh my i'm so happy how can i he says
[25:14] you're happy i said sure i'm happy how
[25:17] can i keep from being happy and know
[25:19] what i know
[25:21] how can you keep from being happy when
[25:24] you know what you know
[25:26] amen christ saved me fill me with the
[25:29] holy ghost gave me a ticket to heaven
[25:31] i'm just having a big time he said
[25:34] hallelujah so
[25:36] you know even these things that he
[25:38] talked about and this joy you can't do
[25:40] it unless you're connected to the water
[25:43] supply way down deep and when you're
[25:45] connected that's when it brings joy
[25:48] that's when you don't let nothing steal
[25:49] your joy away from you
[25:51] you don't let someone else who said
[25:53] something to you steal your joy
[25:56] make you depressed bring you down you
[25:58] can't let people control you like that
[26:01] you can't let the devil control you like
[26:03] that you can't let the devil steal your
[26:05] joy so quickly don't let them steal it
[26:08] at all you let people's comments on the
[26:11] internet and even face to face which
[26:13] they don't do much of it face to face
[26:14] today but their little comments wonder
[26:16] what he's trying to say by that wonder
[26:18] what she's saying by that i think she
[26:19] met me with that and so you let it steal
[26:22] your joy and your happiness and being
[26:24] able to enjoy the day because you've let
[26:26] somebody else's comments control you
[26:30] and i say don't let anybody steal your
[26:32] joy
[26:34] amen so there's a wonderful message that
[26:37] the prophet preached
[26:38] back i can't remember just what year it
[26:40] is um i think it's in 1958 but it's a
[26:44] message i uh commented on sunday it's
[26:46] called the vine and where to plant it i
[26:49] believe it's called and he reads the
[26:50] scripture in psalms 80 and verse 8
[26:53] and it says thou hast brought a vine out
[26:55] of egypt thou has cast out the heathen
[26:58] and has planted it so now that's when i
[27:01] said sunday brother brahm says in that
[27:02] message israel was a good vine but she
[27:05] was planted in the wrong place
[27:08] and so now that is a whole subject
[27:11] within itself
[27:12] to look at our lives and realize there's
[27:14] a lot of good vines there's a lot of
[27:16] good people but it's not just that
[27:18] you're a good vine well they really have
[27:20] a heart for god and they have a love for
[27:22] god praise the lord that's wonderful but
[27:25] if they're planted in the wrong
[27:26] influence the wrong atmosphere
[27:29] if they're not planted in christ can you
[27:31] say man
[27:33] you see they're not being their full
[27:35] potential they're limited
[27:37] and sometimes feeding on things that you
[27:40] shouldn't feed on
[27:41] you might be a good vine but you you
[27:43] can't stay there you're going to have to
[27:45] be planted away from those things
[27:48] sometimes a relationship can be such a
[27:51] hindrance hindrance to somebody who
[27:53] loves god somebody wants to go forward
[27:55] with god a girl that needs to go forward
[27:57] with god and wants to go forward but
[27:59] they don't realize they're just planted
[28:01] in a they're positioned in a
[28:02] relationship that's not right
[28:05] but it's not just that it's all other
[28:07] things of life sometimes you're planted
[28:09] in the wrong church sometimes you're
[28:11] planted in the wrong place so these are
[28:12] good people i want you to see how
[28:13] brother branham words it so so much in
[28:16] this message the vine and where to plant
[28:18] it and he says israel was a good vine
[28:20] but she was planted in the wrong place
[28:22] in egypt
[28:23] egypt represents the world egypt
[28:25] represents denominations can you say
[28:27] amen so whether it's denominations or
[28:30] whether it's the world we can never
[28:32] thrive when we're hanging around things
[28:34] of the world
[28:35] we can never thrive when we're feeding
[28:37] on things of the world we can never
[28:38] become all the way we're supposed to be
[28:41] in christ you might be a good vine but
[28:43] you're planted in the wrong place you're
[28:45] positioned in the wrong place
[28:49] these things are so real to life but i
[28:50] like how he words it and i'm going to
[28:52] read a little bit in the message and
[28:53] then we'll be wrapping it up here
[28:55] tonight it's something like today we've
[28:57] got in the land many great and fine
[28:59] believers
[29:00] and they are mixed in all denominational
[29:03] churches they come from different
[29:05] denominations and different walks of
[29:07] life and that's why in my ministry i
[29:10] have never tried at any time to run down
[29:13] any certain person or any certain
[29:15] denomination because in them all is good
[29:18] people
[29:20] they are called and chosen people could
[29:23] you have condemned israel i was in egypt
[29:26] could you have condemned israel while i
[29:27] was in egypt they just got off the wrong
[29:29] foot they were planted in the wrong
[29:30] place and their sins had separated them
[29:33] from god and they were planted in egypt
[29:36] and that's the way many people are in
[29:38] churches today good people just planted
[29:41] in the wrong place
[29:43] now if a real believer is brought to
[29:45] christ and he's planted in some great
[29:48] denomination that doesn't believe in
[29:50] miracles and signs and wonders of the
[29:51] lord that person may be a genuine
[29:54] christian a catholic a baptist a
[29:56] presbyterian jehovah witness something
[29:58] else in that church a genuine vine of
[30:01] god but the denominational creed cuts
[30:04] off that vine that life of that vine it
[30:07] can't bear its fruit and usually what
[30:10] fruits you get off of a vine that
[30:12] stunted or not in good ground is bad
[30:15] fruits
[30:16] it'll come forth like apples and be
[30:18] naughty and worm eaten apples that are
[30:21] naughty and worm eaten and those are not
[30:23] good apples it's because a subject
[30:26] it becomes subject to insects a good
[30:29] healthy vine doesn't even need to be
[30:30] sprayed it's healthy enough to throw off
[30:33] all of its enemies so it is with a
[30:35] born-again christian you don't have to
[30:37] be spraying them all the time and
[30:38] patting them on the back they are
[30:40] spiritually healthy enough to throw off
[30:43] all of the scandal of the world they are
[30:45] living off the true nourishment a tree
[30:47] sometimes that or a plant that's been
[30:50] into the desert places and doesn't have
[30:52] sustaining moisture it'll bear little
[30:55] naughty fruit and it doesn't look like
[30:56] the fruit that should come from its
[30:58] spine my brother my sister that's what
[31:01] it is with the churches today the sinner
[31:03] comes in notice this now the sinner
[31:05] comes in after maybe at home they came
[31:08] under conviction they go and read their
[31:10] bible and then they go to a church and
[31:12] instead of finding great luscious apples
[31:16] or grapes the life of the lord jesus
[31:18] being reproduced in the church it finds
[31:21] little naughty worm eaten denominational
[31:24] petty thoughts
[31:27] i would just say respectfully that
[31:30] sometimes they go to churches within our
[31:32] own ranks and that's when a setter finds
[31:35] he doesn't see a thriving holy ghost
[31:37] filled church
[31:39] he sees a denominational system anyway
[31:41] because the people are bound
[31:44] and the right fruit isn't coming forth
[31:45] there's nothing to eat on there
[31:48] we baptist and they come in there and
[31:50] they hear we baptist we got it all we
[31:52] got it
[31:54] we're methodists we got it
[31:56] the arms of god reach from sea to sea
[31:58] and from short ashore and can save to
[32:00] the uttermost but that's what we find in
[32:03] places we've this division we've got a
[32:06] monopoly on the truth we've got the
[32:08] truth over here we've got it taking
[32:09] place our doctrine it's the right way
[32:11] it's the only way to come you might be
[32:13] believe the message but you've got to
[32:14] come our way to do it where does all
[32:16] that come from it's a denominational
[32:18] manner it's a denominational way and i
[32:21] can tell you that a sinner that's
[32:23] looking for the life and the reality of
[32:25] god does not want to leave one
[32:27] denomination and come to another
[32:29] atmosphere like that they're looking for
[32:31] the life of the bride tree
[32:34] they're looking for the life of the
[32:35] fruit of god can you say amen they're
[32:37] looking for deliverance they're looking
[32:39] for the spirit of god unhindered
[32:41] unrestricted can you say amen
[32:44] god help us in message churches god help
[32:47] us to get a hold of the life of this
[32:49] thing so that we don't become another
[32:51] system that people are disappointed with
[32:53] but that we actually be the church of
[32:56] the living god that we're supposed to be
[32:59] hallelujah how many raise your hand
[33:00] tonight say god let me be that kind of
[33:02] tree god let me be that plight of a
[33:05] life-giver in this hour
[33:07] people that are hungry for something
[33:08] different shouldn't come and see the
[33:10] same thing
[33:12] they're looking for the realities of god
[33:14] and it's like david said in psalms 1 he
[33:17] said blessed is the man
[33:19] that will not join up with these
[33:21] scoffers and ungodly people
[33:23] not connect with ungodly people not set
[33:26] in the seat with them
[33:29] you know scoffers that say the david's
[33:31] of miracles has passed and the baptism
[33:33] in the holy spirit is just a
[33:34] make-believe
[33:36] blessed is the man that will not do that
[33:38] blessed is the man that will stand forth
[33:40] from such a thing and they don't want to
[33:42] mix those together and you cannot mix
[33:44] those things together blessed is the man
[33:45] who won't assemble himself and unto one
[33:48] of those things that deny the power of
[33:50] the lord the bible said come out from
[33:52] among such for the day will come when
[33:54] they will be heady high-minded lovers of
[33:57] pleasure more than lovers of god having
[33:59] a form of godliness but denying the
[34:01] power thereof from such turn away from
[34:03] such separate yourself
[34:06] the blessed man separates himself from
[34:09] the things of the world and the scoffers
[34:11] and the influences he separates himself
[34:14] from it
[34:17] so he can be a tree he should be like a
[34:19] tree that's planted by the rivers of
[34:21] water
[34:22] god has put him in a choice spot his
[34:25] fruit shall not wither
[34:28] he'll bring forth his leaves and fruits
[34:30] in the season watch how david worded
[34:33] that this man is blessed
[34:35] he will be planted not just set out you
[34:38] know i like seeing anything that's been
[34:40] planted not just set out i'd like to see
[34:42] something planted
[34:44] and israel egypt was not planted they
[34:46] were just set out it wasn't their
[34:48] original home ground and a man that's a
[34:50] christian that rests his eternal
[34:53] destination upon some denominational
[34:55] creed he's not in his right place he was
[34:58] born to be free and a child of god to
[35:00] worship god but he's under a creed he
[35:03] can't bring forth his fruit yet
[35:05] something in him is longing to do it he
[35:08] shall be like a tree that's planted by
[35:10] the rivers of water rivers plural water
[35:13] singular many rivers coming into one
[35:15] channel in other words he'll be like a
[35:17] man in the scripture that believes all
[35:20] of god's word where the power and the
[35:22] nine spiritual gifts can flow through
[35:25] one god into his innermost being
[35:27] people don't believe in shouting the
[35:29] thing of it is they haven't got a
[35:32] spiritual joy and the joys of the waters
[35:34] of life can flow through that's a whole
[35:37] lot like the that's the matter with
[35:38] branham tabernacle because that unbelief
[35:41] the cares of the world had bound the
[35:43] people until it cannot produce spiritual
[35:45] growth
[35:47] that's what's the matter with our nation
[35:50] that's what's the matter with our
[35:51] churches
[35:52] they have no joy and the joy of the lord
[35:54] has departed
[35:56] as was written one time in the scripture
[35:58] the hebrew word ichabod which means the
[35:59] presence of the lord is departed that's
[36:01] over our churches because we left off
[36:03] the original foundation and placed
[36:05] ourselves into creeds and denomination
[36:08] and permitted the things of the world to
[36:10] dry up our experience with god listen to
[36:13] it tonight we permit the things of the
[36:16] world to dry up our experience with god
[36:21] we can't do that
[36:23] we must stand against it we're not
[36:25] called to be a dried up tree
[36:28] you're not called to be a dried up
[36:30] christian
[36:32] you have to separate from the things of
[36:34] the world to become a thriving
[36:36] holy spirit filled
[36:38] the joys of the lord experiencing more
[36:40] and more of the joy of the lord how many
[36:42] want it tonight
[36:44] so the presence of the lord to bar
[36:46] that's over our churches because we left
[36:48] off
[36:49] he said go with me to arizona and let me
[36:51] take you to the deserts which i roam so
[36:53] many years
[36:54] everything in the desert has a sticker
[36:56] on it any little plant you come to you
[36:58] don't get near it it'll stick you it's
[36:59] always got its stickers right out ready
[37:01] to stick anything that comes near it
[37:03] what's the matter what made it a sticker
[37:05] is because it had no water that's what
[37:07] dried it up that sticker is a leaf
[37:09] rolled up for the lack of water it
[37:12] becomes a sticker can you imagine what
[37:13] he's saying now that's supposed to be a
[37:15] leaf that's green and thriving and it
[37:17] rolls itself up so hard and so sticky
[37:21] that it actually how many has ever been
[37:23] stuck by a cactus before
[37:24] yep ryan for sure
[37:27] in arizona
[37:29] you see and but can you imagine that's
[37:31] supposed to be a leaf he's saying
[37:33] and that's how hard it can get that's
[37:36] how
[37:37] pokey it can get i'm using a word i use
[37:39] with my granddaughter pokey
[37:42] and my daughter she called my beard
[37:43] pokies
[37:46] that's what a beard is pokies dad you
[37:49] got your pokeys
[37:50] kyle you got a lot of pokeys
[37:55] can you imagine now
[37:57] something so hard that's become such a
[38:00] it's become a thorn
[38:02] and it's intended to be a gentle
[38:04] green leaf
[38:06] but because of the lack of water
[38:08] it's the way christians can become in
[38:10] their attitudes
[38:12] he said when he gets away from he said
[38:15] the church
[38:16] and thus before the lack of water
[38:18] becomes a sticker and thus when the
[38:19] church today when they get away from the
[38:21] fountain of life when it gets away from
[38:23] the joys of salvation when it gets away
[38:25] from the lord god then that person
[38:27] becomes a sticker always finding fault
[38:32] sticking
[38:33] no sooner you come and then i'm press
[38:36] the bear i'm presbyterian i'm methodist
[38:38] i'm so-and-so
[38:40] i'm in this doctrine of the message
[38:42] don't talk to me about that stuff a
[38:44] sticker it has no fruits you take that
[38:47] same plant cactus and put it into a land
[38:50] for a few generations
[38:52] where there's plenty of water and that
[38:53] sticker will unfold and will become a
[38:55] soft leaf bearing fruit
[38:58] what's the matter with the church today
[38:59] it's been set into a denomination that
[39:01] has put denominational creeds and bound
[39:03] it no joy just a sprinkle now and then
[39:06] of a little revival to hold it what it
[39:08] needs to be is to come out from among
[39:10] scoffers and unbelievers and be planted
[39:14] by the rivers of water
[39:16] can you say amen
[39:19] praise the lord
[39:20] many many more times he referred to this
[39:23] tree planted by the water and all the
[39:26] characteristics that come from a
[39:27] believer that gets himself away from the
[39:30] water flow and all of a sudden his
[39:32] attitude changes and all this fussing
[39:34] and stewing and
[39:36] bitterness and all these things he said
[39:37] it over and over again i don't need to
[39:38] read all the quotes the type is there
[39:40] the shadow is there when we are not
[39:43] connected and our roots down deep close
[39:46] to where the source of life the one
[39:47] source of life
[39:49] we can have the same characteristics in
[39:50] our life
[39:53] we're not predestined to be
[39:55] away from the source of life
[39:58] we're not predestinated to be
[40:00] going off somewhere where there's not a
[40:02] source where you could be under the
[40:04] fivefold ministry i do not believe that
[40:06] that would be the will of god for a
[40:09] believer to move somewhere where there's
[40:11] no source to be fed by the fightful
[40:13] ministry
[40:14] that can't be the will of god
[40:16] and this whole tree thing that can't be
[40:18] the will of god but we are to be planted
[40:21] in christ and that can be anywhere i
[40:23] understand that to be planted in the
[40:26] revealed word for the hour christ and be
[40:28] there and close to it and feeding on it
[40:31] that can be anywhere but then the same
[40:33] bible that you read gave a fivefold
[40:35] ministry can you say amen those that
[40:38] would feed us nourish us by the word of
[40:40] god those that god would use as angels
[40:43] of the church can you say amen there's
[40:45] seven church age messengers seven angels
[40:47] and then under that he gave he gave
[40:49] gifts unto men of a fifo ministry and
[40:53] staying close to that will be the the
[40:55] life source
[40:56] that the life of the word comes through
[40:58] can you say about
[41:00] and he says for the perfecting of the
[41:02] church
[41:03] for the work of the ministry for the
[41:06] edifying and the building up of the body
[41:08] of christ he gave that fivefold ministry
[41:10] for them
[41:11] i'm thankful for him i never would be
[41:13] where i'm at today except the god called
[41:15] fifo ministry that god has provided in
[41:18] the last days i say thank god for them
[41:21] i know there's a lot of counterfeits but
[41:23] there's when there's a counterfeit
[41:24] there's real fivefold ministry
[41:26] there's gods called men and they'll lead
[41:29] us onto a rapture can you say amen
[41:32] they'll take us onto a rapture someday
[41:34] he said if you give your pastor respects
[41:37] he'll help lead you through to the other
[41:39] side
[41:40] that's a pretty important position not
[41:42] as a man but his office
[41:44] he'll lead you through to the other side
[41:47] that's wonderful
[41:49] so now i would like us to read something
[41:51] here
[41:52] at the last few verses of the bible if
[41:54] you would and i'm going to close this
[41:57] and i'm going to connect with that
[41:59] thought that brother abraham says
[42:02] that a sinner and a thirsty person comes
[42:05] into the church and all of a sudden they
[42:07] don't
[42:08] they don't find they can't eat from the
[42:10] fruit of that and they should be able to
[42:13] but i want you to notice this theme is
[42:16] at the very last chapter of your bible
[42:19] and um
[42:21] we'll just read it here we first of all
[42:23] in chapter 22 we have the pure river of
[42:25] life and we the water of life verse 1
[42:27] says and he showed me a pure river of
[42:29] water of life clear as crystal
[42:31] proceeding out of the throne of god and
[42:34] of the lamb now if that's true this
[42:36] remember this is the book of revelation
[42:38] so this is symbolism and if that's true
[42:40] in the the natural someday that there'll
[42:42] be a pure river flowing it's only a
[42:44] reflection of the pure spiritual river
[42:46] that god has had coming from his throne
[42:49] how many believe that you're you're a
[42:52] believer today because you begin to
[42:54] drink from something coming from the
[42:55] throne of god he sent his messengers
[42:58] from the throne of god he sent his word
[43:00] and through that word the the fresh
[43:03] water of god the river of life flowed
[43:06] through those messengers
[43:08] and you're here today because you were
[43:09] able to drink from and plant your life
[43:11] close to that
[43:13] and so here's this subject in the last
[43:15] chapter of the bible and it's the river
[43:18] of life
[43:20] the river of life isn't that wonderful
[43:22] if you skip ahead all the way down to
[43:23] verse 18 the last few words for i
[43:26] testify unto every man that heareth my
[43:28] words let me just go back a little bit
[43:31] back to um
[43:33] verse 16 i jesus has sent mine angel to
[43:35] testify unto you these things in the
[43:37] churches i am the root in the offspring
[43:40] of david and the bright and morning star
[43:42] and the spirit and the bride say come
[43:45] and let him that is heareth say come and
[43:49] let him that is a thirst come and
[43:52] whosoever will let him take the water of
[43:55] life freely
[43:58] who is the last per the ones speaking to
[44:01] this world
[44:04] this bride tree
[44:08] who is the last one speaking saying come
[44:11] it's the spirit and it's the bride
[44:14] it does not say and i mean this respect
[44:17] that the last thing is that it's a
[44:19] prophet and the spirit no the last thing
[44:22] and the spirit and the bride are the
[44:24] ones saying come on
[44:28] that's why he could say that thus saith
[44:30] the lord is in the bride she has thus
[44:32] saith the lord and she knows what he
[44:34] wants done with the word can you say
[44:36] amen
[44:37] his word will be in his bride she will
[44:40] be the final voice to the final age and
[44:43] you can preach that all day long you can
[44:45] believe it that's fine but unless you
[44:47] have that river of life in you you can't
[44:49] say come to anybody else but i'm here to
[44:52] tell you there is a people in the face
[44:53] of the earth and she's so ta so filled
[44:57] with the spirit and so connected to
[44:59] these rivers of life that she can say
[45:02] anyone anybody who's thirsty let them
[45:04] come i can point you to the river
[45:08] i tell you a person could not say that
[45:10] unless they were connected themselves to
[45:12] this river of life
[45:14] they know they're confident they know i
[45:17] have been connected i have been planted
[45:19] by this river of life i'm receiving from
[45:21] the source so i can confidently say come
[45:26] if you're thirsty come i can show you
[45:28] where it's at
[45:31] it's the spirit and the bride the last
[45:33] voice the final voice to a final age
[45:37] where the world is looking for all sorts
[45:39] of uh places to go and the things of the
[45:42] world and the new movie coming out in
[45:44] sports and and and and
[45:47] and just feeding on all kinds of things
[45:49] trying to satisfy that there's only one
[45:52] river of life
[45:54] there might be many rivers of one source
[45:56] of life one water can you say amen and
[45:58] here's a woman that's so connected to it
[46:01] she can confidently say
[46:03] come on
[46:06] the spirit of the spirit and the bride
[46:08] are saying come yes that's the spirit
[46:10] and the prophet
[46:11] see this thing has trickled down can you
[46:14] say amen
[46:16] and it's about the prophet it's about
[46:17] the prophet it's about the prophet in
[46:19] revelations 10. it's about the seventh
[46:22] angel then
[46:23] and then the seals and then he goes he
[46:25] said but in the days of the voice of the
[46:27] seventh angel that becomes a significant
[46:29] thing because god's gonna pour out and
[46:30] speak things through that seven angel
[46:32] and then it says when he shall begin to
[46:34] sound so you have the voice of the
[46:35] seventh angel but then when he shall
[46:37] begin to sound there's a sound that goes
[46:40] from that voice
[46:42] so it just trickles down and trickles
[46:44] down until he says go in to john type of
[46:48] the bride go and take
[46:50] the little book
[46:51] now that you have it it's been handed to
[46:53] your prophet it's been preached to these
[46:55] people on earth bride take this book and
[46:58] eat it right
[47:01] take the book and eat it
[47:02] and when she does
[47:04] the bible says she is the one at the end
[47:07] thank you for keeping it up it's the
[47:09] spirit and the bride that say come
[47:13] now to me somebody who
[47:15] somebody who doesn't have it
[47:18] somebody who's not connected to it
[47:20] they're not going to be saying come
[47:23] they're actually going to be have their
[47:25] wall up
[47:26] they're going to be hiding
[47:28] isn't that interesting
[47:30] somebody that's ashamed of it
[47:33] they haven't met the source of life yet
[47:35] i'm ashamed of this message i know i
[47:37] want to keep it hidden i don't want
[47:38] anybody to know that i believe it but
[47:41] see here's the bride she's she's a she's
[47:43] a tree that's planted she's so full of
[47:46] life she's so confident she's unafraid
[47:48] there's no worry there's no fear she has
[47:51] thus saith the lord and knows what to do
[47:52] with it and she's not pushing people
[47:54] away she's not closed
[47:57] she's not fearful can i get an amen here
[48:00] tonight this bride tree is not pushing
[48:03] people away from it this pride tree is
[48:04] not hiding and going underground this
[48:07] pride tree is not ashamed of the message
[48:09] of jesus christ this right tree is not
[48:11] on doing searches on google and trying
[48:13] to is this really true or not and just
[48:16] trying to do no no she's already
[48:18] connected and planted to this river
[48:21] and she's not fearful to tell people she
[48:23] doesn't have any walls up she's not
[48:25] hiding and she is saying i am completely
[48:29] tied to this river of life and she is
[48:32] saying by the spirit and with the spirit
[48:35] if you're thirsty come and drink
[48:39] blessed be the name of the lord for i
[48:41] testify unto every man verse 18 that the
[48:43] hearing of the words of the prophecy of
[48:45] this book if any man shall add unto
[48:47] these things god shall add to unto him
[48:49] the plagues that are written in this
[48:50] book and if any man take away from the
[48:52] words of this book of this prophecy god
[48:54] shall take his part out of the book of
[48:55] life and out of the holy city and from
[48:57] the things which are written in this
[48:59] book he which testifieth these things
[49:02] saith surely i come quickly amen even so
[49:06] come lord jesus the grace of our lord
[49:09] jesus christ be with you all amen
[49:14] last proclamation
[49:17] of the lord jesus
[49:19] surely i come quickly the last voice is
[49:22] that he is speaking through his bride
[49:25] saying whoever is thirsty come
[49:30] whosoever will
[49:33] let him take the water of life
[49:36] freely that's right
[49:38] so what is this thing about
[49:40] deciding who's going to receive it and
[49:42] who's not going to receive it
[49:44] the same jesus that said in the gospels
[49:46] whosoever will now he's saying he's
[49:48] still saying it through the bride
[49:51] and in the wedding supper when the first
[49:53] ones were called all those were
[49:54] supposedly ones that would be invited to
[49:57] this great feast how many remember the
[49:58] parable and they were invited and with
[50:01] one one accord they all begin to make
[50:03] excuses i can't be there i won't be
[50:05] there i have i have bought a cow
[50:09] i bought a piece of land i bought an
[50:12] organic cow
[50:15] i got to stock up some meat i won't be
[50:17] able to make it to the feast this is the
[50:19] invitation to the king's feast
[50:21] and they're turning it down because
[50:23] their life's not worthy of the gospel
[50:24] they're turning it down
[50:26] for life things
[50:28] i've got to go over and get an organic
[50:30] cow
[50:32] i have
[50:34] bought a piece of land
[50:36] and i cannot
[50:38] come the third one was that i have
[50:41] married a wife
[50:43] he's the only one that had kind of an ex
[50:45] no he didn't have an excuse
[50:48] i've married a wife enough with all my
[50:50] worries with that and all
[50:52] i just don't have time anymore for the
[50:54] lord because i've got married and i've
[50:56] got to provide for my family and i got
[50:57] we just don't have time to be there
[50:59] brother paul
[51:00] and they all begin to make excuses for
[51:03] why they couldn't come to the invitation
[51:06] and so god said all right
[51:09] then
[51:10] call the lame call the halt call the
[51:14] blind
[51:17] open up the doors if they won't do it
[51:19] they're supposed to be the ones that
[51:20] receive it but if they're making excuses
[51:22] going to live that way there's going to
[51:23] be some new ones come and i'll tell you
[51:25] they really need it
[51:28] they really need it and then they said
[51:31] their house is still empty there's still
[51:32] some room to come in the invitation and
[51:35] he says all right go out into the byways
[51:38] go out in there go and whosoever will
[51:41] let them come i'll give them this
[51:43] invitation
[51:46] and others started to show up at church
[51:48] that we wouldn't expect to be there
[51:52] well these aren't the normal ones it's
[51:54] coming from the other churches
[51:56] you might look over in another seat and
[51:57] see somebody you don't know
[51:59] it's been kind of comical lately it's
[52:01] the people meet people in the bathroom
[52:02] the church and they said well where do
[52:04] you go to church where i go to church
[52:05] here
[52:07] i haven't met you yet
[52:10] somebody said that happened
[52:12] recently
[52:14] you might look over and you see somebody
[52:16] my they're a stranger they may not look
[52:17] all together right but i'm telling you
[52:19] the third poll and the final call is the
[52:22] bride saying who's ever thirsty let them
[52:24] come and drink we have
[52:27] access to the source of life
[52:30] don't be surprised
[52:32] of who shows up
[52:34] because the final call is the bride is
[52:36] saying come
[52:39] and the final calls go out into the
[52:41] byways and hedges and
[52:43] have them
[52:44] invite them to come
[52:47] and the final
[52:48] god did not get rid of i'm going to
[52:50] close
[52:51] god did not get a rid of the whosoever
[52:53] will even with all of our truth of
[52:56] predestination that god knows who he's
[52:59] going to call god knows who his elect
[53:01] are but the problem with too much of
[53:02] that doctrine in the people in the
[53:04] message is they start selecting who's
[53:06] going to come who will come and if they
[53:08] turn you down the first time well
[53:10] they're they're not the seed of god we
[53:12] don't have a right to do that we're
[53:13] supposed to say come we have the source
[53:15] of life in the word of god
[53:18] and we're not and we're supposed to say
[53:20] whosoever will
[53:22] let him come
[53:24] he's still saying whosoever will you
[53:26] think well that's just a a baptist
[53:28] talker that's not a back response that's
[53:29] a scriptural doctrine and the last thing
[53:31] he says is the bride will be proclaiming
[53:35] if you're thirsty
[53:36] and you need something to drink i'm
[53:38] planted
[53:40] by that
[53:41] water of life
[53:42] and because i'm planted there and
[53:44] connected and my roots go way deep
[53:47] i can say to you come and drink
[53:50] whosoever will
[53:52] that uncommon drink none of this
[53:55] i don't think they're a type of person
[53:57] that would receive this
[54:01] i just i don't know about that
[54:05] particular one
[54:07] and there might be a lot of surprises
[54:09] when we get on the other side
[54:14] of people that make it
[54:16] and we didn't think ever was going to
[54:17] make it
[54:19] and as brother brown
[54:21] people who didn't make it we thought for
[54:24] sure we're going to be there
[54:26] my i can't believe that brother bram
[54:28] says there'll be a lot of surprises on
[54:31] that day
[54:32] because you know what it's going to come
[54:34] down to
[54:35] not what church you're a part of not
[54:37] just say i'm in the message movement
[54:40] it's not going to come down to any of
[54:41] that did you take your tree and was
[54:43] planted by this source of life
[54:47] and whoever is really thirsty
[54:49] they're looking for it today they're
[54:52] looking for it they're tired of religion
[54:55] they're tired there are some people even
[54:58] weary of some of the facets that happen
[55:00] in our own ranks they're tired of it i
[55:03] just got a book from somebody and they
[55:05] were writing about it but my my feeling
[55:07] about it is that the person just tired
