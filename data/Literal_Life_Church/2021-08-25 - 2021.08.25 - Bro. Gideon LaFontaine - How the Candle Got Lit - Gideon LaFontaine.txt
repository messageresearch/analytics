TRANSCRIPT
========================================
my wife's gonna start i just wanted to thank the lord because um yesterday at the funeral of jim brother jim bab's funeral at the end of it it was about 95 degrees and my outside yeah and my mom started feeling faint and she went over and she sat next to my dad and then she passed out um when there's they have several doctors in the church they gathered around her and her pulse was at 30 i think and she was um had already turned blue and she was gurgling um so they um revived her and by the time the emts got there um she was feeling somewhat better so they assumed that it was a hit the heat we did advise her to go on yesterday and be checked and everything checked out good but i'm just thankful because you know it could have been a bad situation and we're very thankful that god [Applause] someone else have spared tonight come forward very good god bless you all i was hoping brother paul bring the microphone but a couple of weeks ago there was an air show my brother has a concession with the air show in michigan and he offered us to come and help him you know so during that time there one of the staff was you know like kind of cursing my brother out and she was just going off on him all in his face and you know the little sister in me wanted to go up to her and just say hey back off you know but i started praying my heart and i'm like lord i don't know what that lady is going through but please just calm her down um you know whatever she's she's whatever is is in her life just you know make it right and just calm her down so a couple of seconds you know she did calm down and then i went about my business and and i forgot all about it and later on my brother came up to me and told me that she came up to him um you know in private and told him you know apologized to him and said that she was very sorry that um she embarrassed him in front of you know her family and his family and then later on when everything was over she came up to me she's like i am so sorry that i act the way i did and you know please forgive me and she told me all about her life and i kind of connected why she was acting that way but i told her you know it's okay you know and i i was thinking god that i prayed for her you know i remember brother paul talking about or singing about you know how we have to have compassion you know for the sinner and again you know i that's i believe that's the god in me because in my flesh i probably would have gone up to her and and said what i had to say and i'm being honest but yeah so i just wanted to share that with you big sister right and taking care of the situation praise the lord sis wonderful you were moved with compassion of christ and you moved with compassion all right somebody else i just wanted to have a testimony anyone from the camp i'm like sister jennifer i would much rather stay back there um but many of you know that for probably about the past year and a half you've all been praying for my health and i just want to give glory to the lord because i can be here and not be in hardly any pain [Applause] you know i can stand in my feet and i can sing and really praise without so much pain and before i just couldn't really stand so just a back story is about a year and a half ago i started having a lot of pain in my feet and we finally got on and saw several we saw two different foot doctors and went through injections and different diagnosis and um probably the last six months like everything just slowly got worse and it wasn't just in my feet it was like my knees and my legs and i had muscle pain and nerve pain and my knees got really bad i could barely walk up and down my steps at home so every day was a struggle for my age it was really hard on myself and my family but anyways the lord just put it on our hearts to get just to get another opinion and um we came across um an an old family doctor we had been seeing who had moved and um i think my mother-in-law gave me his information or whatever but we just prayed about it and i thought well let's just get into a family doctor and like just start from ground zero because nothing was making sense as to how much pain i was in for my age so we got in there and um he was like no this is not normal we need to like has anyone done labs you know hasn't i said no he said well let's just start from the ground up and just test for everything so and when when you're in that much pain like you know i i often said like you know i i felt like i was 65 and not you know 34. that's the way i walked it was really sad but anyways so he tested me for all these different things and it was hard because when you're in that much pain it's like lord you know what what tests and trials do you have for us because i feel like i'm dying i feel like there's something wrong with me and um god just gave me strength and faith and through all your prayers and support um everything came back good and i want to praise the lord for that the one thing he he did not test me for was um a mess and he was a little concerned for that with my symptoms and my husband just said we're not even gonna go there so i did not get tested for that that's like a spinal tap um but anyways everything came back clear and he he basically said like for a diagnosis he said fibromyalgia and as i read about that there's not a lot of information about it it's just kind of vague and so i asked him i said so i said to me i said this sounds like a fancy scientific name for we don't know what's wrong with you and he looked and he's a christian man and he laughed and he said that's exactly what it is so he said let's he he did suggest a medication which i was very leery of and he said let's just try it and we prayed about it because i don't like taking medicine i i have not in the past um i hate side effects you know and i just you know we want god's miraculous like just healing you know just to be gone but i said lord i won't be stubborn if you want to use a medication i'll do that and so that's what we're doing and by his grace i am i'm at church and i'm more here because the pain is gone and i just wanna you know i when i take that medicine i don't i don't rely on that i rely on god so i just want to give him all the glory i thank god every day that i can get out of bed forgive me so you just don't realize what you have our health we take our health for granted and i just thank the lord that i feel better and i can take care of my family and my husband and be with you all and be more here and um god is so good i don't deserve it but i give them all the glory and i thank you all for all your prayers and support oh god bless you thank you sis amen god got all the glory for that no medicine god got all the glory you know when you're in pain it's not just the pain it's the mental battle too you want it to be over for the mental battle thank you sister tiffany giving glory to god hallelujah somebody else brother ed come here would you mind coming up here a minute i know i don't want to embarrass you but i become a real friend and a brother i just was i just realized i was looking at you that i forgot to mention you in prayer because you just lost a loved one too and a friend yeah you're a very close friend yeah who was that her name was jeannie you know she's been friends forever but a good christian woman so so that makes it all that much better if not good still but you know and we still got to fight that battle of the hurt that comes with death even though we know you know that she's okay and she's home but the lord has he's blessed me in so many ways that it's you know we're all getting through it and you know you know he he just blessed me over and over and over when was the funeral it was this weekend it wasn't a funeral they just had a get-together and i tell you there was a lot of a lot of drinking and stuff going on there and uh i was with a friend from tennessee my my friend's wife good christian woman and we were sitting there and then all of a sudden at the end of the service my friend jeanne's sister is a she sings christian music i don't know her last name but they have records and stuff and he said uh i want to bring up these people here that are going to sing a song and you know everybody like i said they were just getting drunk and stuff and she's saying um oh what song was it anyway was it was a good christian song you could see people all over kind of thinking about what was going on with this music and it touched a lot of hearts i think you know and so that was the highlight of the the night and it was a good one you know and it's all been good father i forgot to mention brother ed losing somebody this weekend with happy valley and all of them i just pray that you will comfort brother ed's heart i pray you'll give him strength lord knowing that all things are in your hands and we know lord you took his friend uh knowing it was her time to go but i'm thankful lord that you know all things and we trust in that lord and i'm thankful you're given the peace and given the peace to brother ed bless him in the coming days lord as he had this loss in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask it amen amen amen god be with you buddy thank you amen we appreciate you amen somebody else have a testimony tonight anybody else i've also had a lot of pain in my um shoulder i could really have some sympathy for brother ray just a small touch of what he goes through um but i don't know if it's a mixture of the lord touching me and guiding me to the right kind of supplements and things and food to eat but i'm a lot better thank god amen glory to god amen amen anybody from camp want to testify the camp that took place last weekend that you all stayed down there and didn't come home sunday it was so good and we're not holding that against you we're glad of it anybody want to come up say anything um yeah i was really happy about the reports on that i had a testimony come in this week um brother daniel gibson dinner it was his birthday monday he's a minister from covington georgia and i thought i'd just give him a call for his birthday and um he said since you called he said i want to share something with you on the phone last october you came and did our anniversary meetings and brother daniel i don't i wouldn't have time to talk about all that he's been through i don't know if he's i guess he's about 40 some and all that the surgeries he's had three shoulder surgeries he's had cancer he shot his hand a couple years ago we were brought these requests just about every time before our church and he's just been through a lot as a minister just a lot and preached mostly through all of that and then in constant pain because of the surgeries now he's going to have two knee surgeries but the time i met him in october and was down there he was on a lot of medicines i think probably nine or ten medicines he was just having to do that just to function the doctor said you you know how doctors you know you'll be on this rest of your life or you will you'll be dead and so you know like him and i talked about medicines can be used of the lord and all these other things but i'd like to encourage people that never accept that ultimately you'll be on that forever that because we want to believe that someday that in god's timing that he will have you released of that you don't want to accept that it's a death sentence and so we were talking about that he said i want to tell you he said you and and i did i entered into a real urgent fervent prayer when i was there with his church i asked the church with special prayer come around and lay hands on him and we we said a prayer that sunday it was his birthday that sunday two i believe and we really really entered into the need and really prayed for him and he says then he says i was just expecting and expecting and laid it before the congregation and this march he said something happened in one day and he said he went back and he just said i know this is the end of these medicines and he was released to go off all of them he's not on one of those medicines now completely with no pain no pain whatsoever so that was amen that was from october to march so sometimes as i was saying sunday you know when the word speaks pharaoh's days are numbered can you say man just keep believing because the deliverance is coming and that's just the way god works and we have to sometimes in his instant other times we have to wait but in his season he'll do the work and i thought that was a great testimony not to point to me but to the lord and what he does and the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much that's what the book of james says so we when we enter prayer don't make it just a shallow thing enter into the need enter in and believe what you're saying is going to come to pass very important in our prayer to be that way i thought that was wonderful and i know the lord touched many hearts of the camp and also hear this last sunday as well it's just such a move of the lord we're praying for some more that need a touch from the lord but i think many were very touched on sunday we're thankful for that amen anybody else have one tonight before eli come on amen god bless you uh we're just we we want to show our gratitude to our god um this is going to end with a new car but that's actually not the biggest um blessing that we have seen um it was more of god doing lining everything up exactly you know for two weeks that was just amazing i kind of briefly go over it so yeah i guess two weeks ago tomorrow we were an accident well i guess maybe go back my wife had been wanting a bigger car suv for months just so she has more room to deal with samuel and so i'm slowly looking at them well it's you know you never want to spend that much money just because you you know if you don't have to so um so two weeks ago we uh we're in an accident and we thank god that we're all safe nobody was hurt the other driver was um fine um it just so happened we were in it the kid pulled into an intersection as we were going through we uh i had i was stopping on the brake pretty good so the front end it was just uh decent damage but it was like not a high end not high velocity impact um but my car was so old way too many miles so they decided it was totaled so so this was you know over the weekend and so tuesday we get this information your car is totaled we're like okay what are we going to do for a car so we all day last wednesday we went shopping for one we finally bought one on friday but the little series that goes thursday the day of the accident i get home i had already called the insurance company for the first time and we're getting ready to settle down for the night my boss calls me and says uh the mri scanner is down no need to come in tomorrow hallelujah so so luckily all day friday i was doing uh all the insurance you know phone calls you know things like that so that was like taking up my day on friday so then monday he's like still not it's still down stay home and just so happen i was like okay um i had some we were working on a re-accreditation for the um facility that i work at so i was going to come up here and work i got up here started about not even an hour kendall calls me and was like i'm having chest pressure oh okay so we ended up going to the er everything was fine it was just a little muscle um pain and then she probably had the testimony that she actually after i guess would have been last sunday she felt completely better from that as well so we praise god for that um but so i we we went to the er so i had the day off to take that i was here to take her to the er instead of her having to deal with it by herself with samuel so then wednesday so then thursday well so wednesday night or wednesday i had been looking on line for cars and we had found this one in angola indiana is like where i work it's like straight across i was like i've been right on time right on the way i was like okay okay well i'll take a look at that on my way home well that night my boss calls me and says can you go down to marion instead of up to elkhart i'm like sure so i go down to marion well if i don't know if you all know the uh geography but angola is kind of way out of the way from my travel there but fort wayne is right on the way so at work there um there was another lady doing most of the work so i was just you know helping her out and uh looking on my phone well i found two other vehicles and one was up in detroit and one was in fort wayne and the one in detroit never responded to me but the fort wayne was like yeah stop on over you know i was like okay i should be there about five o'clock so i get there about five o'clock and the thing was that from marion for fort wayne was like right on the way i was literally five minutes out of my way so i was like oh i get there in this you know wonderful car and i'm telling my wife how you know how much she would love it and so so so why i'm there i text my boss and say what does tomorrow look like do i you know he's like service guy is going to be there tomorrow stay home like okay so so then that friday we the whole family we go over to fort wayne look at the car we end up buying it and driving back so the thing was i guess the whole point of this is god every time that i needed to be home the machine was down and he worked things out so exactly that what we needed for the past two weeks that we just can't do anything but praise him and i mean you know sometimes you look back and you see it but it was so amazing that we could as we were walking through it we were like wow how did he know we would need that today how did he know we need that today and it was a true blessing so awesome amen amen that's good and i i do like that car too so it's okay to have a nice car you know i did that because he's an on-time god he's an on-time god do you have one a quick one okay i want to move on to the other thing i'm not i'm not saying come on no come on i gave mine and then we'll sing after this one he's an on-time god yes he is i've been sitting there all night saying you should get up and testify my in my mind about the house that we're fixing up getting ready to sell for our investment property and because i know it's been a little long tonight so i won't give the whole test to me but we're gonna put it on video so you guys can watch it but when eli got up and started testifying about the car i was like okay i'll say something about these earthly things that they're not as special as all the spiritual things that happen to our young people this week and and all the spiritual things that god provides for us every day um they don't matter as much but god is more than able and he cares about refrigerators and cars and water heaters and all of our needs and the testimony for meeting eyes we have our house completely finished and on the market to sell and god has provided every single need that we've had we prayed for cupboards one morning and by the end of the day we had free cupboards and we prayed for a stove we god gave us a stove for free refrigerator freeze refrigerator you know dishwasher the whole house is ready to sell it's beautiful and it's all god and he has provided everything that we needed so he cares about us [Applause] i'm not much of a public speaker but um i just can't keep it to myself so this i went to the camp this past weekend and the lord really just met me and um delivered me from something that i felt like i just been in a rut for a really long time and he just delivered me and gave me my freedom and okay and i felt so blessed and encouraged i got to spend about an hour after the prayer line saturday night with isabelle after she got the holy ghost and it was just so encouraging and i'm so happy for her hallelujah thank you lord amen we rejoice we rejoice because he's an on time god yes he is let's all stand he's an on time god yes he is do you guys have that one up there oh he may not come when you want him but he'll be there right on time yes and he's an on-time dog yes he is [Music] yes he is yes he is [Music] amen praise the lord let's give him glory amen [Music] they overcame by the blood of the lamb by their testimony i appreciate everyone tonight looks like we need to do this more often because there's a lot of giving the devil more and more black eyes we need to do it more often brother gideon my son's going to come and share the word tonight he feels a little pull that way and so we always give opportunity for that here and he has some testimonies as well he wants to share so well you come get in we'll sing this again how many believes an on-time god amen even tonight is on time he's in on time god is it on time [Music] [Applause] oh yes he is sing it again [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes it is [Music] [Music] yes it is [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you wow first time so bear with me tonight i still have a little recovery from my voice i was shouting a lot this weekend let's just say that so we'll get to that but um let's just let's just start with the word of prayer all right dearly father god we come before you tonight lord jesus god wanting more of you seeking more of you god lord my nerves are through the roof right now god just lord wanting to get everything right god i may not be ready lord but i know you're ready lord jesus so god would you come and anoint this place right now god anoint my words lord jesus god and let the people pull lord jesus that they would get something out of it tonight god and it would edify them lord jesus that's my prayer tonight god i'm just gonna be sharing um just a little bit my testimony and just things god's showing me in the word but i bless that you would bless it god you would be in it lord that's my humble prayer tonight we give you the service in jesus name amen hey man i was just i was uh just thinking what pull this up can you guys hear me okay okay um i was thinking jennifer and tiffany they're like i'd rather be back there right now and talking but it's not going to work for me either so all right so anyways let's turn to it in the scriptures tonight uh ephesians 2 verse 1 just a simple scripture tonight i mean if you got it say amen and then we got it on the monitor there too so if you want to say it with me too just so we're involved it's just just one verse we'll say here together and you hath be quickened who are dead in trespasses and sins amen you may be seated all right so i guess just starting off um i guess i got some advice on just uh just what to how to start or what to do as far as the first sermon and i got some advice on just just tell how the candle got lit so i'll just testify a little bit and you know we'll just go from there so um so when i thought of these questions how did the candle get lit uh or where did my journey start um the first thing i thought was you know i grew up in a message church grew up in a message home and you know just the i guess it was about ottawa lake there my first church and i was just thinking it was kind of funny people say they're cutting their teeth on you know message pews but it wasn't for us we had chairs right and we didn't cut our teeth on those pews we had those little plastic things on the side that we would pull off right and we would try to fit them in like different ways that's how solomon knows you gotta i don't know so that was just kind of refreshing where i was back there in those days but so i grew up in truth right i grew up in um honestly just i think i mean this was probably biased for me but i think as far as just parenting and just the guidance i got as a child teach the teaching of the word i couldn't have been more blessed so i mean for me my testimony it's like it's uh it's hard to you know say like i was you know extremely off or extremely just way out there but god had to bring me to that and say that i was off i was out there and he had to tell me where i was and he had to show me how how awful i was and how beautiful he is so so that was the first little part there so um so i was a preacher's son as well a lot of that is expectations a lot of people say oh man the expectations of just being a preacher's son and pastors a pastor's son you must feel all this pressure all the time and you feel i don't know just uh i guess you you feel like there's a ton of people watching you and you know you feel like you're you're almost like you've got to do everything right right and there's a little bit of truth to that because you you know you feel that pressure all the time but later on just to encourage i don't know who would watch this later but when god when god is when you want to please god that really fades away all those pressures really fade away because when his blood when his blood is applied and you know then all the other pressures all the other forces coming against you really don't matter anymore because he cleanses you he frees you from all that so there's no pressure anywhere from that so just to encourage all the the pks out there i know my siblings are and you know my dad was and all that so all right so then we've got psalms 103 7 17 and 18 but the mercy of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto his children's children to such as keep his covenant and to those that remember this commandment commandments to do them so i was just thinking about even how our family got started and going back to uh even my grandpa my my on my mom's side my dad's side my my two grandmas just seeing their their prayers back then and seeing their multi-generational view and their prayers for even my life you know so um that little seed that was in them that little seed that's a trickle-down effect that affects multi-gen it's a multi-generational view so um as far as the young people i know it was amazing to see dad we've been going through some of the courtship stuff praying for your praying for your wife praying for your your future kids i mean that's that's something that excuse me that's something that uh we should always have in our heart always thinking of the future that's what we have amen our past is gone but our future is coming amen so that's just a little thought i had on that and then i also thought of grandpa you know yielding to the lord and how we must always be yielded to him to to christ he's he's he should be number one in just the transition you've heard my grandpa's testimony but um you know he was yielded to christ and he was he had that fear fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom right so uh so he was i guess that fear is the beginning of his wisdom right it's not like man-made wisdom or anything it's it's god's wisdom so that seed that fear of the lord that god gave him that's the beginning of something and it's it's it starts it starts it could start multi-generations it could it could trickle down to that so starting with just that fear of the lord and just a simple believer i mean i was just blown away just thinking about that and the past as well so the past can be used for your your uh let me think how to rephrase that everyone looks at the past and think that it's a bad thing right and what their sins were and everything but their the past can be used for good and looking at all the victories you've had in the past so don't don't ever don't ever don't ever look back and say you know oh my past was awful or anything god god in predestination god had all those things planned so just keep you know keep moving forward i was just thinking about that don't uh don't think that your your trials and what you've gone through are a bad thing god god used them for your victory he used them for your character too so so keep that keep that in mind [Music] and then i was also thinking of this this word as far as my testimony i got uh baptized um i got baptized when i was nine years old and um at the time dad gave me good advice even going into it and um you know he he brought up you know it's actually a representation of you being dead in sin you're dying to yourself and rising again in christ so it was a beautiful picture for me so even i i because i found because i understood it so well i knew that that was it was confirmation i can hold on to that time and i can say that's when i that's when i was baptized and i you know i believe that's uh you know that was a step in my my christian walk so i think every christian needs that a water baptism amen it's uh water water blood and spirit amen we need that amen amen amen so yeah we got we got this time in high school as well i would be really real with you tonight because it's dear to my heart and you know you feel ashamed of it and just your past but at the same time i just want to be transparent with you and but in high school that was i would say the sanctification sanctification time for me i was very i guess the roller coaster i mean it was just up and down as far as finding my satisfaction and uh confidence in the word it still wasn't there right so i um i'm going through high school you find you're in an identity crisis you know you're at this stage in your life where you know you don't you don't really know yourself um even looking back on salvation you know i still i still uh i was like unsure you know where i stood so um so looking back there i i went through a lot of uh lust that was probably the main thing and i'm getting to where the victory comes but i would say freshman junior year there's so much of that in my life as far as the mental battles and as you guys know the the greatest battle i've ever fought is the mind so as for me as a introvert i i i really struggle with that so much more because you're you're alone a lot of the time and that's where that's where the battle goes on all the time see the extroverts they just release it they go for it you know they just they talk about it and they get it off their chats with chess which is probably brings them uh uh well i guess it's different forever but it brings them a little bit of victory even exposing the devil like that so for me that gets like it's really hard for me to do you know and uh being transparent and uh you know i guess uh revealing what the devil's doing you know and he's disrupting disrupting things in your life but oh yes so we're uh junior year um i would say that's when really god started dealing with me as far as how how ugly i was as a as a human amen um and it was it was a time when you know the mind battles you'd go through scenarios and your mind is almost completely completely um like controlled i guess by that right um by that spirit and um so i i went through that i would say i was december december of that uh let's see that year i can't i can't pinpoint the year right now but i went to one youth retreat and i remember uh it was a couple sermons that god was showing me and i was there at retreat where i believe god completely purified my life and he he realized he he spoke to me and i realized what i was doing i realized the corruption that was going in my mind i realized that and that's the first step right to uh to the salvation plan your deliverance is realizing realizing what you're doing wrong right so that came repentance right we need we all need repentance amen that doesn't stop either we all we need to repent every day dying daily right as paul said amen so so that brings me um so i go through that and um you know that that that time you're feeling very free you know of just uh what what god's uh got what god's doing for you but that's that's not the last of it right amen there needs to be a filling amen this is where i want to get to tonight as far as as far as the holy ghost goes in my life and even being under the age of the holy ghost and the eagle the eagle age this means so much more to me now the more i feed on the word the more i i the more i listen to them the more i realize how much power we have in the holy ghost just all we have in him all we have in christ so so i asked the question tonight what is the holy ghost to you what is the holy ghost to me that's what i ask myself and it's an overcoming life on a soul level it has to be a soul level all right because we can get in the flesh right we can get in the flesh all the time that's honestly being we're born in the flesh right that's that's usually comes what's number one our feelings our emotions everything that that we want right in our human desire but then but then praise god when that holy ghost comes in on the sole level hallelujah bring so much joy to me you must fight for every inch of ground you get it's the joshua commission the holy ghost is one with the word so with the with the sealing of the holy ghost you can't conflict with the other right so that's where i'm coming to tonight i want to say that people always struggle with is the holy ghost and the message is that is that the same thing is it different right but when you come to it they're the same they're the same the holy ghost and the word are one so if there's something in your heart that's saying i don't know if i have the holy ghost or not right i don't know if i have it but if you if you really have it and you you know you know you've had an experience with them your desires change right and i can testify that my desires changed when that when that happened i believe i believed it was there so the spirit and the word are one and it's it's not just the word it's the word for your day right so that's that's what comes me to the message it's believing the word for your day it's not just it's not just and i'm not trying to separate these here tonight but this has been enhanced for your day right this has been enhanced for your day so looking at these scriptures you can read between the lines with what we have for the message of the hour today amen so don't separate the two amen don't separate them god god is sovereign god speaks in many ways he speaks through his prophets amen and uh he's uh and he reveals himself to to his bride so so that's uh i was just getting to that the the word for your day and this scripture comes to me ephesians 1 13-14 in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were you were sealed with the holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory so i was just thinking amen i love the the way brother aaron mcgeary brought it up one time we have the ocean right we have the ocean and it's just vast right it's just it's just there's so much there's so many elements to it but we have we have one little spoonful of that of the ocean right one little spoonful you take one little spoonful you have more molecules in there than all the drops right so you have everything you need in the earnest of your earnest of your redemption which is the holy ghost everything you need so don't don't cut this thing short the holy ghost is what we need in this evil age amen and uh i'll i'll say that till the day i die the whole the holy ghost is what we need in this age amen and we look back through the bible and these these characters they didn't have it they didn't have it the holy ghost right but they pers they had something within them they purposed in their heart right amen amen that just amazes me to see the purpose they had even without the holy ghost amen so uh so yeah the high school battle of the mind um kind of getting off track here but forgive me um so yeah ephesians but i would rather oh i love this but i would rather brother branham says this um but i would rather be wrong in my doctrine and right in my heart than to be right in my doctrine and wrong in my heart see i said after all it's your heart condition so now i want to start talking a little bit about your heart and how how your heart is the breeding ground for the seed to come forth right so um as far as atmosphere and the atmosphere you lay in this this time i just uh i was just thinking about it and uh kind of bringing it back even to a seed in the ground right the ground needs to be soft right in order for that seed to be nourished and and uh and come forth as as fruit right so uh i was just thinking um you know this this weekend is coming coming to this weekend even kind of bringing it to now but i can get so i can get so uh carnal in my mind right i was just sitting back there just at the meetings and i was uh i was just god was dealing with me but also i could i was also analyzing everything in my mind of what was going on what was going on in the service you know obviously there's a lot going on in the services and stuff but i was sitting there analyzing everything and saying is that right is that right is that right is that right and i'm i'm sitting there in my mind i'm just like i'm a critic right i'm i'm being i'm critiquing everything that's going on around me and now i'm really realizing so much now it's so carnal minded right if we could just see the power of god and what it's doing all those things would just fade away right all the all the carnal things we're not the final judge right we're not the final judge he's the final judge so why are we why are we getting so involved and what's what's right and what's wrong we need to be we need it's just when it comes to those services or in our rooms it could be anywhere but it's you and god right it's you and god so don't judge don't judge when when it comes to a service man god corrected me so so hard on me this weekend i i just i micromanage god so much my i i i think i've got it all figured out and then i don't got it all figured out so um so i was just thinking about this morning but um but god you know by the end of the weekend at the end of the weekend i'm there dancing with them i get going with them i uh i was in that i was i was in that brother brother branham talks about him going to a pentecostal church and him get him doing the same thing right and i brought i brought myself in his shoes i was like my i just experienced the same thing he did when that happens my my but it's it's the holy spirit discerning my heart with the word right brother tim pruitt he spoke straight to me he spoke it doesn't have to be brother branham discerning your heart nowadays it's the word of god discerning your heart so the more you're in the word the more character you're gonna get right the more you're in the word the more he's gonna refine you and bring you as a pure gold right so don't be that's when i come back to the soft heart why should we have a soft heart is because we want god to move if that's our desire in the holy ghost we want god to move however way he's going to move so let's not let's not get carnal let's not get carnally minded god god is a big god we don't we can't even touch what what he can do so let's not micromanage god let's let's give him full control and as a song leader too i don't want to get on even your left but as a song leader we we we get we can we can get so uh like this is the way it's supposed to be right like this is how it's supposed to happen why do that to yourself why hold yourself back from that and i i'm i'm not just talking about in a service i'm talking outside of service right can't just bring in the service right the life is out there right that's that's what the spirit is for and as a song leader i noticed that the way the way that you you worship in a service this is just on a a church level here but the way you worship in a service affects all that's around you right it's the atmosphere right so so what i'm getting at is if the holy ghost obviously it's for you and you're overcoming but it's also for the other people right it's for sinners to come home it's you're supposed to be a spiritual hospital right amen we sing that song um we're the lost and the broken bring the burdens and their cares it's like that's what we're supposed to be like this is your house lord right so i was just i was thinking the people around you they're affected by how you're worshiping you're getting involved but at the same time we're not supposed to be worried about this is the hard thing to catch you're not supposed to be worried about that you're just supposed to worship amen he deserves it he deserves our worship amen i was just realizing that when when he he started talking here i am in the service looking at everyone and pinpointing i'm like god when it comes down to it this is just supposed to be you and me right the message is supposed to bring relationship right god and man right and when i'm looking around me obviously there's different instances and i've heard them before it's like i can't even hear what the the you know the minister's talking about you know that can get hard but at the same time there may be there may be someone there that's getting a victory and you're back there in your heart that you're getting you're getting resentment right and you're it's actually holding you back as well right so i mean i'm just i'm just asking you know i'm trying to not bring too much correction tonight but at the same time you know i just found this god corrected me so i i i'm you know i'm guilty as charged but his his blood made me free amen and then by the end of the service there i was dancing i was shouting oh my the brothers were they were bragging on my dance moves i don't know what that was i don't know what that was about but um but even that you know people can get even with that they can get carnally minded like we that's not what it's about that's not what it's about god wants you to worship in spirit and in truth right spirit and in truth that means not just in church in your homes right when you're talking to your your your son or your daughter you're reading them the bible stories giving them the truth that they need to overcome amen it comes down to when there's a situation in church where it comes down to when uh there's a situation as far as there needs there needs to be a healing you need to step out in faith and you need to pray for them right don't be afraid there's there's something within you that that's calling you go do that amen don't hold back don't hold back so let's uh i guess i'll get to the end of here that was just those uh those little things are so exciting for me you know to see when god corrects me i yes it's hard but at the same time i'm like god lord thank you i i am just i am so ugly sometimes i need your purification to just lord just cleanse me lord i just i get so so carnal amen my mind so that's uh that's just a simple prayer i've been uh seeking the lord for for uh just a little bit here but um let's see college i'm just going to mention this a few things here college made me realize i'm in nursing school right now but college made me realize how evil this age is yeah i went to a baptist school in high school and it wasn't uh near the things that i get in in in college i mean the pressures that i feel and um just the forces that are constantly working in the classroom and even when they talk you know it just it's uh it gets uh they get so so evil you know and uh it's not you know it's not them it's the spirit of the age you know and i've got to understand that so i can be more of a light right i can't just bash these people and say they're gone just like i love sister jennifer's testimony they're having compassion for these people which is what my dad's been preaching having compassion let the holy spirit reign in your life let them reign in your life and have full control amen amen so uh i have this last quote and i probably i'm probably going a little short but it's my first sermon so give me a break give me a break um first last quote here i love this one i just found this a couple months ago but that's the way it is with every born-again christian and i believe that when you're born again you've received the holy ghost right amen when he really gets into god he watches his life with god's word and he realizes he's lined up with every bit of it he's got long suffering gentleness quietness meekness power faith love joy peace he ain't tossed about like a troubled sea he ain't worried about every little thing he ain't jumping here and there like like a bottle stopper on the windy ocean he is set his heart is pure his thoughts is pure his intentions are pure his alternative is is right and he he knows he lines up with the word of god all hell can't move him he's lined by the word of god he's got divine love purity in his heart forever for every man and woman he's got he's he's he's abstained from the things of the world they're dead to him he don't want them to no more amen that's why i was just a beautiful picture of the holy ghost there and you can just think of this the opposites of all those things opposite of love long suffering gentleness just those you can reverse that and say you know lord if there's any of those things in me god purify let that holy spirit within me god lord let the word just just completely purge that out of me i don't want any of it amen and god he cares about the little things too don't think that you know your time doesn't your time doesn't matter to them or you're you know just the little things of life your little white lies or different things he he knows he knows so don't don't uh think that god's not watching you you uh you keep lord let reveal yourself to me reveal the bad in me so the good in that you place within me can come out and it be expressed so those are just a few things tonight as the musicians would come even with the holy ghost i was just realizing i was looking back uh isaac used to tell me all the time but i love this analogy of just just a boxer and a rink right he's in a rink right and uh as a new boxer man you get you you get whaled you get you get you get hit to the ground over and over amen i love that too you always get back up right you always get back up amen but not only that but after a while you start studying your opponent you start studying the devil right i believe that is the character of god right you start studying of god studying studying the word you start knowing all the devil in his devices right so i started i was like so now i can look over the you know left you know left uh dodge or whatever and give him give him a good uh punch there i mean that's what i want to do amen we've got the power to do it by the word amen amen so those are just a few things tonight um had in my heart i know it's a very simple thought tonight i've got to share a little bit of my testimony um i also had a song tonight if you could pull up that song sufficient for the day see i'm used to singing so that's uh that's what i'm used to but you know let's just uh let's just ask god right now uh for a deeper a deeper walk with him and a softer heart towards the things of god softer heart towards um just the people of god the i mean it's like it could be our brother too it could be our our friend that we're actually building a complex toward and uh lord i don't want any of that so if you wanna stand with me i wanna i wanna teach you this song but it's called sufficient for today amen such a beautiful song but you guys got that oh okay oh yeah okay ready did you okay um just pick f for now actually d there may be storms that will move out the way and try trials will come to only test my faith but what i've learned about your favor your mercy and your grace is they go on forever they're sufficient for today when i'm worried about tomorrow i won't be overwhelmed and the burdens that i've carried i will choose to lay them down hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah they're sufficient they're sufficient for today oh hallelujah [Music] in the joy and i find you just the same oh and behind my darkest mornings there's a piece i can't eat is what i've learned cause what i've learned about your favor your mercy and your grace as they go on as they go on forever there's [Music] [Music] they're sufficient for today next verse okay i'll finally see you and my faith will be my son and all my presence will be gone and left behind oh i'm so grateful for your favor your mercy and your grace cause they go on forever bear sufficient for worship him now worshiping [Music] [Applause] oh glory to his name hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] oh [Music] sufficient for [Music] [Music] to trust in jesus just to take him at his word or just upon his promise just to know thus isn't just so sweet oh jesus oh jesus [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] christ [Music] let's all pray go ahead and do that dear heavenly father lord or just a simple thought tonight god i'm just my heart being soft towards you lord jesus lord god i can get so carnal sometimes in my mind lord jesus and what i do god i can testify you brought me out lord you bring me out again and again lord jesus lord let your holy
