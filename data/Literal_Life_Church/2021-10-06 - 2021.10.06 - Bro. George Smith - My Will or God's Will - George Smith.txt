TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to the book of psalms 143 let's see here psalm 143 will be our first scripture and then we'll go to proverbs then we'll go to the book of jonah psalm 143 and verse 8 cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning for in thee do i trust cause me to know the way where and i should walk for i lift up my soul unto thee deliver me o lord from mine enemies i flee unto thee to hide me teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness quicken me o lord for thy name's sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble and of thy mercy cut off my enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for i am thy servant a few pages over into proverbs 14 proverbs 14 and verse 12. let's see here there's a way which seemeth right into a man but the end there are the ways of death we think it's the right way but it might just not be the right way and then over in the book of jonah it's right after obadiah almost to the end of the old testament in prophet jonah chapter 1 now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amitai saying arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me let us pray verse your heavenly father we thank you for your word we thank you lord for the occasion that we can be together in this lovely place with lovely people we pray that you would bless them with your word we can only speak it but it must be you that puts it in their heart bless each one lord help us in jesus name amen you may be seated so like i say it's a good new good to be here and i came just before the weather changed because i happen to know it can get cold up here so uh we uh probably be back someday soon but it's just good to be with brother paul and the saints here now our title tonight is my will or god's will be something you can put on your mirror you can put on your refrigerator whatever my will or god's will now we're going to preach tonight from don't pay attention brother branham's absolute okay that's what he calls his absolutes it'll do for me too okay got that settled now jonah was an israelite okay he was a jew and he lived in a little town of geth hepper which is a little town up north of nazareth up in galilee and he was the first foreign missionary now i'm sure that brother paul's listening close and he'll probably give you a test on this in a few days so you better pay attention that's all i can say and so he was the first foreign missionary or an apostle like the new testament says one that is sent out and that is the highest calling okay everybody thinks well yeah it's just prophet's highest calling no it says first apostles prophets you know right down the line now our prophet says in the end time message 1954 i believe every christian is obligated that's all of you a little guy every christian is obligated not so much that you have to go over to the old country and preach but if you can't go you can help send somebody else to go okay everybody should hear the gospel at least once i want to do my part there's something about missionary work i just love it and just to know that what you're doing you're doing god's will when you're giving to missions see all these lights have to be purchased they don't give these away all these seats had to be purchased when you take something to post office you know it's always money so when you're giving to missions you're in god's will now missionary work is not only traveling to some hot sticky place where they don't speak your language okay or eat food that's not like you got back home but it's living for others right here in michigan and ohio eternal life is living for others sacrifice okay everybody wants eternal life everybody wants to go to heaven if you stood out here in the road and stopped everybody you want to go ahead and i'm sure everybody wants to go to heaven they just don't want to go today so that's right um i'm very proud to be associated with brother paul brother barry in this missionary effort i know we have a same attitude about getting the word to the people um proverbs 29 18 says without a vision that people perish if you look around churches that don't have no missionary vision they're just kind of flat you know so um our vision isn't to make everybody come into this church well there's enough people on this street philip church but there would be a bunch of bunch of you know non-eagles we're just looking for those last eagles out there don't know yet that they're eagles you see and so then we can go but brother ram says on that day on calvary he was just one man the perfect man he gave his life he made an example for you now what must we do now the first thing i want to say jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and do good that's fine but when you live just your life for yourself you don't have eternal life eternal life is living for others it proved it when he came in the lamb of god he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself he lived for others and you receive eternal life by receiving that day on calvary and you don't live for yourself no more you live for others so we want to just give you a just a brief um look through the window to the missionary work that we're involved with because some people think i just live down there in tennessee and don't do nothing well that's not exactly true uh and then we'll get on with brother jonah here but um you know in acts chapter 11 there was some needs in the church up in jerusalem so the church in antioch which is far away that's where paul and barnabas were they gathered some some money says right in your bible we have a real good study in the book of acts but i don't live here so we can't get into it but they took money to the saints in jerusalem they helped them it's not always putting a book in somebody's sense sometimes just buying them food sometimes just getting them off the street and you know rent a house and so we're very involved in a lot of different things for example venezuela i don't know if you've read much about it but venezuela used to be a very growing economy we lived there several years ago many years ago and um uh they had everything you could imagine they had they had you know jaguar dealerships right there in town but all that's gone downhill because in 1999 they've reelected a socialist president knowing he was socialist we'll go in the same direction because you have noticed but they elected this man and for all these years now it's been going steadily down down down they have they say they have more oil underground than they do have in saudi arabia well but it takes technology to get it out and get it pumped out but they've let the whole system kind of deteriorate the americans want to drill the wells and got it going but anyway uh their oil system is not working like it should so everything is it's poverty they want to they want to duplicate what they have in in cuba they got nothing in cube i've been there it's just zero nothing to duplicate they claim about their their medical really no it's a joke uh and in venezuela they have over four thousand percent inflation you can't exist like that so we are helping some of the saints we can't help everybody but you see over over five million believers are not believers but all of the population over five million people have left the country they're they're over here in tennessee they're in uh kentucky they're in brazil everywhere they've went to spain and so those people over there they want to send money back to their relatives well we've got a problem because since we the americans are the enemy then they don't have no western union you don't have no simple way of doing that sending money home so some of these people amongst the believers uh were good friends so they sent me money into paypal or western union then i put it into an account that can be transferred to a friend of theirs in venezuela and when he sees you know a hundred dollars then he pays out a hundred dollars to whatever person we tell them it looks like money laundering and it's about about what it is but it's the only way to get money to them you know because in a church this size uh there's a brother down there it's got a church of uh probably 200 people and so the people work the ones that have jobs but they pay them in the local currency which is worthless so you take up an offering and then you convert it to dollars because everything in town is in dollars you might have twenty dollars well they can't go very far like that right um so anyway we're helping them we every week we send money we send boxes of clothes we send you know beans we send coffee just medicine no medicine your child's sick so you take them to the doctor and the doctor says well he's got this and this and you need this and this and this where are you gonna get it right they don't have it right so we end up sending them etc and all kinds of things so anyway that's one of our constant projects um we also are helping some people over in malawi to build a church that's not our regular type of thing but uh since we have plenty of time and nobody's fallen asleep just yet but we have a solution for that sleep thing that's coming up in a minute um i was over in malawi uh two years ago in 19 yeah and so visited many churches and lovely people poor oh what are you talking about this church probably it wasn't quite this wide but it was longer and they didn't have nice seats had planks they sit on planks no no back so you can't go sleep there's probably 600 people there but they only had two light bulbs one's over the pulpit and one's way back there it's okay they a lot of them don't read anyway so they just you know come to church and so um i remember i was talking to a translator some of them understand english but anyway talking through this translator and the um you know you speak and then he speaks and i speak and he speaks so i said something and while he's speaking guess what this light bulb is attracting bugs says bug comes in here i have to have my mouth closed right then because he was talking so he got cut in the mustache got him out you know but i noticed in one of the churches they didn't have bibles there's only two or three bibles what's the matter here well they can't afford them and i said i promise you will be a bible in every home in your language we went to town they sold bibles right there now they got a bible how do you preach this message to people that don't have the bible what's your you know point of reference so anyway we're helping them and um and so this one churchway room there's probably 150 people or so and so they don't have the luxury of a nursery the nursery is right out here 10 by 10 piece of plastic and either the mother's carrying the baby or like those two little kids back there they'd be sitting over here and of course people were watching them and the deacon's got a big stick and so they they're sitting in church right there where you see them well anyway um they wrote to me later and they said you know this the church you're in uh the brother that donated the property he wants it back it's like that one week to the next and he said now if you don't like that there's the door well he was putting in some strange doctrines too so anyway they said now we've saved up some money and we've seen this piece of property over here we need a little bit more so we can buy that piece of property and build his church you know church name and so forth and um so by the time i got the other 1200 or so together the catholic church bought the property i said don't worry god's got something better for you so they started looking and just out of town a little ways there's a piece of property a couple acres and nothing was on it and they they liked the location and i said fine there let's let's buy that so the money they had with a little bit i sent they bought that property well then we start building now they did all the work by hand all the trenches and everything no machinery and so they're they're building away and they uh they were encouraged and we were helping them and they said you know we've been talking and said we uh we think we'll call this church the george smith tabernacle i said i don't think so we'll call it the walking and the light tabernacle ah yeah we like that so they registered the name well they're almost finished so we're helping them with that and it's going to be a lovely place um and so out there where they're building there's no other churches around there so the neighbors you know they live out in the woods there they uh they come over what do you guys build in here well they start testifying to him he says we baptize somebody every day so this church will be full by the time they get it finished but anyway that's that's over in in malawi and of course we've been involved with the church age book to get it in english and spanish and published around the world so that's going on and it's been a real real blessing so things are happening and uh right now i'm working on the seal book it'll be new you'll love the the new book so let's get on with our buddy here sorry our brother jonah okay now jonah had a direct commission from god go preach to the enemy their wickedness has come up before me i can't stand it anymore go preach repentance there's only one problem jonah was jewish and um people in nineveh were gentiles very serious segregation and when you read your bible see this bible's written a long time ago and it's right but all through the bible these people lived here and these people lived over here they had segregation okay but of course in our great american way we thought the integration be better but it hasn't worked out too good okay so segregation and nineveh at that time was the capital of assyria you can study this on your maps in south you find out that's currently northern iraq very wicked very sinful people very cruel violent city of over 120 000 people it was a large city at the time took three days to walk around it and the assyrians were constantly tormenting the and oppressing the israelites see it didn't start in 1948 3000 years ago they've been after him since so god was sending his prophet right into the jaws of danger to face the enemy go cry against it it was time for repentance and um god always sends a warning before judgment every time you see and so in uh in the new testament jesus you know walked and traveled all through israel and so he uh he went through different cities but there was three little towns in particular that just weren't paying attention you know they didn't believe bethsaida courts him and capernaum he pronounced the judgment time passed jesus left disciples are traveling everybody forgot what's going on 60 years later the earthquake came and destroyed him all three cities today they're a pile of rocks and even the tour guides say you better believe the bible because when it says here that's exactly what happens now they've it built up every place else but those nothing there's only a few people in capernaum because the catholics owned the property and they've made a you know first stop out of it but our prophet uh preached in los angeles 1965 uh choosing of a bribe and he gave a real good blast to los angeles comparing it to capernaum and look at it today i mean it's the news all time this has fallen off that's falling off and sliding away but brother branham said it was going to be a piece three to four hundred miles wide that's about to the arizona border and 1500 miles long it's gonna break off and go into the bottom of the ocean and there would be no repair for that so why is this important to us over here in 2021 well because in first corinthians 10 all these things happen to them for example and are written for our admonition for our learning for our betterment that's right who upon whom the ends of the world are come now when paul wrote this 2000 years ago he had to know somewhere that you know the end of the world wasn't going to come right then it's written for us we're the ones you see we're the end time generation we are at the end of the ages so the world is falling apart and um uh jesus said when these things begin to happen don't try to vote don't try to give money look up the end is near luke 20 28 21 28. so again we have a message of warning before judgment is simple and to the point what is it repent or perish with the unbelievers you got a choice and you can choose you know so we need a shaking we need to get our teeth rattled you know and get away from the attitude of sin uh the attitude of non-concern who cares that's not christian we need a trimming a cutaway of the lazy idol no interest attitude and the idolatry yeah it's everywhere it's not just over the catholic church no we'll get into that in a minute now i i carry this with me it's called a level see we put it here first of all we're going to check the pulpit that's pretty good yeah check that cross but you didn't put it up so we keep it here to to uh remind me to stay level but for you to remember the state level if i see anybody trying to go to sleep watch it so we're far beyond you know an aspirin or an alka-seltzer you'll be okay no that's not we won't be okay we need major surgery we need truth we cannot afford to continue to play church and feel good you know it's high time when each one actively seek the presence of the lord in our individual lives get in the closet seek how we can please god find god's will for your individual life remember my will or god's will that's the idea okay first john 4 20 says if a man says i love god and hates his brother he's a liar for he that loves is not his brother whom he can't see how can he love god whom he has not seen yeah it's a hole in your head so however we treat each other believer to believer that's how we treat god you see he's watching our reaction to all this stuff that's going on you see god could fix everything and have it all back to normal perfect order by 10 o'clock in the morning it's probably not going to happen he lets it go and go and go because he's very patient and while that's going and rotting and you know all the stuff that's going on he's watching the reaction of the believers he lets that things happen to get our reactions to the surface so now jonah was god's man of the hour okay yes he had a clear-cut decision from god a commandment from god go cry out against their sin their corruption i know all about the segregation i know all your fears i know all your doubts go anyway verse three but jonah and see when it starts out with but we got a problem but jonah rose up that morning to flee to tarshish from the presence of the lord he went down to joppa found the ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare went into it to go with them to tarshish and again in case you weren't paying attention the first time from the presence of the lord he was going this way okay so he wasn't just anybody okay he was god's prophet of the hour god's mouthpiece it's not looking good but it's all gonna pan out don't we're not going to throw no rocks at him just yet it's going to be okay so um he did not break his relationship he was still god's man he's still god's prophet but when he broke was fellowship you see and brother branham says right on tape anointed prophets make wrong decisions because they're humans i knew the human william branham i wasn't sitting out there watching the miracles i i knew him you see and so um so he goes down there and he finds the ship going that way and um he uh he reached his pocket got his five dollars out and paid for the ticket now this is a merchant ship this is no you know cruise liner it's a merchant ship and so they took on a you know maybe one or more tourists and he paid and so um these merchants were taking grain from the middle east to other places now for example in the days of paul and this could have been similar they had a ship 100 feet long all wood no steel 100 feet long and it could carry 300 tons of grain in the merchant those merchants they're watching the weather if it's bad they're going to stay put but looks good so they take off they get out there a little ways and what do you think happens there's a storm coming up all of a sudden and they're scared they don't want to die so they start pitching stuff off and the wheat or whatever they're carrying and um but all this time god had a fish right there beside traveling right beside the boat you know right through the storm and so the um uh these these merchants they're praying to their gods and burning little candles and stuff and they said where's that tourist we'd let on where's he at well he's down our sleep no problem now remember he didn't have his he didn't have his his prophet suit on no he he looked trying to look like the rest of them just like peter you know over there in the new testament peter his main problem was his mouth you know he was always open at the wrong time right and so they're on the way to the garden of uh garden garden in gethsemane and jesus said then we've got a weapon oh yeah we got two swords fine now my son takes that to mean it's okay to you know collect guns so jesus said so they get to the garden and and jesus said now boys is going to get tougher a little bit they're going to take the son of man you know all these things peter are you kidding they got to come through me first you know and so um jesus said peter just better just zip it you know and so um sure enough here they come looking for jesus and and peter gets his sword out well he's right you know and so he gets his sword out and you think he was even for the air he probably wasn't that good of a swordsman probably aiming for the neck but somehow he tripped and missed and took off the ear remember that story so there's the ear that's sitting on the ground everybody's looking this guy might be bleeding a little bit we don't know jesus reaches over puts the ear on they should all been on their knees you know okay we got a problem here okay and so um they um so then he just immediately it wasn't you know five years later right immediately they take jesus and he's in the prison and everything over there confidence house and peter oh big mouth peter oh you got to come through me first somehow he bribed somebody and he gets into the yard you know when jesus is in prison there and so they're serving tea you know or coffee or something and so when they come to peter he says oh thank you and when he said thank you in that accent from up north uh-huh you're one of them never heard of him big old cuss word comes out you know yeah peter he already had the keys but no holy ghost so he thought he'd just kind of sneak in kind of you know be the crowd there well that's the way jonah was he was just down there asleep so to get him up there wow got a storm and so um he uh he said well i'll tell you what guys this this is my fault it's all my fault a little bit of revelation you know says throw me over everything be cool fine we don't need you anyway i pitched him over and he barely got wet because the fish was right there and he pitched him over right down the stomach now we're not going to argue about what the fish's name it was a big fish and it was a miracle fish because he had oxygen to breathe okay so um he uh you know god had this big fish a great fish he says because with god there's no surprises god already knew that you would be here tonight that you made the right decision you know others are you know we don't know probably not our people some of the people they're home you know with their favorite friend the remote you know forget paul let's go to the other channel you know come on yeah it happens okay so um the miracle was he could live in this fish okay and so um he's in this fish now he can't see anything it's black there's no light all disney put a little light there but there's no light and um it everything he touches you know it's soft and who knows what all that fish has been eating you know and so um it was dark and he couldn't see the symptoms were everywhere so the next time you think you got a problem you want it right whatever you're going to call a problem think about prophet jonah he had problems now he didn't know he's only going to be there three days he thought about this forever i don't know how i'm going to live but he's in this in this mess and so um uh he's um he had plenty of time to reflect on his decision over here in verse three but jonah rose up to flee from the presence of the lord yeah he had time to think about that and so he uh he couldn't see anything so that's you know eyes don't work and uh but he said these symptoms are lying vanities and he was very much alive he could touch he could taste so yep mousekalot yeah and uh couldn't see he could hear he could smell but god had oxygen there for him to live okay so he starts to pray and he got serious about praying because this wasn't part of the bargain unforeseen circumstances you know we've heard plenty of people well i thought it was going to be this way and i think this we don't care what you think you know wrong every time solomon said it's all vanity the symptoms are very real he had to ignore the present reality and focus his mind on the word of god he didn't have a bible didn't have an ipad it was up here right you see so he had studied the word he had it recorded and that's all he had you see and so uh he had to ignore the present reality and um no bible no prophetic transcript no pictures no nothing he got serious about praying it's in chapter 2. and i say he didn't know it's only going to be three days now our prophet said the devil's tremble when the weakest of saints goes to their knees the person that just came in last week when they start praying things start to happen because the devil you know he can't handle it what a power and a privilege has been given to the church of the living god when you fall to your knees in prayer even the devils tremble to the weakest of them another place and the weakest christian here tonight can defeat satan anywhere any place any time under any conditions with thus saith the lord you just believe it so why was our brother jonah in this sorry condition well apparently you know it looks like he gets shirked away from his duty he okay dude he's here he goes this way okay and he ran from a responsibility he ran from the presence of the lord he ran from the will of god opted for his own will remember my will or god's will but only the fellowship was broken not the not the uh the relationship so each one of us had to make choices today in this week you know and so jonah made a choice and he's willing to pay the price and go his own way he just didn't know didn't realize how high the price was going to be you see he chose to go in the opposite direction now see we we get off by two degrees we start feeling bad you know but he went the opposite direction now we're here close to toledo so god says i want you to go to toronto well god i think i'll go to indianapolis 180 degrees and um so he probably thought well you know there's a lot of sinful people over there in tarshish i'll just go preach over there it won't be so much hassle so much opposition and god would have blessed his word regardless but obedience is much better than sacrifice and i'm sure that every one of you got some kind of testimony just to make that come true and um because you know we have catholics we got baptists we got charismatics they're all using the same bible there's not some foreign bible muslims they got some other bible but all in christian world they got the same bible and um many are being blessed i mean you're being healed there's miracles they believe they're approaching god you see god honors faith that's right and i can show you something where i don't have this i don't think in this culture but where brother rem says and god ignores your doctrine and we've made such a mountain out of the doctrine's got to be this way and all people aren't seeing it this way they're going to hell come on wait a minute god gave the holy ghost to those that obeyed him amen okay so um thirsting for life phoenix and this great pillar of fire the angel of god the logos that went out of god and led the children of israel through the wilderness when it came amongst the people it separated itself and great licks of fire came upon each pillar each one as the pillar fire began to break up god dividing himself amongst his people okay all that ought to tear the heart out of anybody god tearing himself apart that he might divide himself a little bit to each one of us then he says can you see why i'm standing for unity of every church comma not period no standing for the unity of every church oh thank you lord that's the same thing the pope says he wants everybody you know comma every full gospel church okay that narrows down comma every believer yeah we want the unity of the believers we have to be of one heart one mind one accord no matter how much we differ in scriptures people different scriptures people differing quotes some of you don't like the quotes we're reading here yeah and there's a bunch of people out there and sitting on the couch well who's he you know and so he says no matter how much we differ in scriptures or you know your favorite quotations that might be one might see it this way has nothing to do with it here's the part i want to get to but in principle we have to stand one great mighty army of god marching on because each one of you in your peculiarity now i've been working with brother banner's words for 50 years and when he uses a new word pops out you know now you're looking at one person very peculiar but i'm looking at all the peculiar people out there you see we didn't all drive the same kind of car did we and so he says here um because each one of you in your peculiarity god has proved that he's ignoring your doctrine because he gave you the holy ghost and the bible said he gave to them the holy ghost those that obeyed him acts 5 32. now if i obey him in my peculiar way and you obey him in your peculiar way he gave us both the holy ghost so we ought to be christian and brethren and sisters enough to arm up together that's not single file okay arm up together is like this and uh arm up together and march for one great purpose the gospel so that's why i felt led to come by here to encourage you to arm up together forget all the silly stuff you know but see unto us he's revealed the mysteries of the kingdom god doesn't hold all the neighbors accountable for what you know he's revealed himself to you now are you a display of this message or are you a display of a peculiar doctrine we should be brothers and sisters enough he's trusting you with his secrets the fullness of the revelation so god has a perfect will and he's got a permissive will okay for each one of us okay the prophet goes on here in uh does he change does god change his mind 65. we try to work on god's permissive will and he will permit it but also if we take his permissive will though it's not right he will make his permissive we'll work around together to glorify his perfectness but there will be a price you go off you know he'll bring you back but it won't be cheap another place he says we must submit ourselves to his will and to his word don't question it believe it don't try to find our way around it just take it the way it is somebody wants to go around and get some other way and when you do you find yourself going on and you'll find god blessing you but you're working in his permissive will and not his perfect divine will so we'll get back to jonah don't worry i don't know where i'm at that's why i i go by notes you know some people they just pull out of the air but you see people ask me well brother george how can i know for sure god's perfect will right you know young girls young boys people want to know well here's your clue god's word and god's spirit and god's will always run in parallel they never cross no they run perfect parallel okay and they always agree the word the will the spirit run in parallel and they run in harmony you guys know all about music here i don't know about music my wife is known about music but you know we can't have these instruments one in a flat and one in d minor and one in f sharp they've got to be in harmony it's got to work together you know now some people have a portion of the word memorized to the very letter but the wires are crossed and they display a contrary spirit even though they they're quoting the word see there's no harmony with the rest of the word so it produces bad fruit bad results it's contrary to the word jesus told the woman at the well now that's one uh person we don't know her name we're not gonna guess we'll find we're gonna meet her soon but she appears just about every time brother man refers to her and so he said he told us now look god is looking for people that will worship him in spirit and truth that's where this comes in in spirit and in truth i know people got all kinds of spirit and they about tear the church down every time tear up the piano and just just you know wreck and other people got all kinds of truth and they all go to sleep well both are wrong you got to be balanced see okay so they asked brother branham one day how do you feel is the best way to find the lord's will in some important matters that's a good question all of our things are important you know he says i'll tell you dear friend the best way to find the will of god in some important matters is prayer now before you fall off the bench yeah i know you already knew that you know naaman knew that you had to get in the water but it had to be in special water okay important matters prayer here's the way i do i take it before the lord it's always been my strength i wait upon the lord see what he says and i just let myself be neutral to it oh that's hard to do you know the young girl wants that boy well he might not be interested you know it happens or you know somebody might want a white truck an old thing on the lots green trucks i want i want you got to be the prayer neutral okay don't take either side so if i was in your place and didn't have these visions from the lord i would just wait up on the lord and i said lord you show me what's this decision to make and then the way you feel it to do it then wait ah so we got prayer we got neutral we got weight those aren't fruits of the 21st century now down there where i live and of course you got all these restaurants up here too but i know people they they love good coffee i know this one guy so he goes but down the road he's aiming for for starbucks but there's six cars at starbucks ah forget it you'll go across the street and get something else they can't wait and so he says um i says wait and then wait a little bit and then wait a little bit longer and see which side you know he leans which way the spirit now father in my heart you know it does not matter but i want to know what you want to do about it so we got joan over here god did make his permissive will turn around to accomplish his perfect will okay the special fish right there in the bible delivered jonah um on the shore and god reminded him go now i know you've listened to william branham and a lot of times when he tells us he gets into jonah he says you know a few times says that that the people of nineveh they worship the god of the sea so here comes the fish you know cruising up there he stuck at his tongue and prophet walked off they all believed well go listen a little more he says yeah i read that in a book one time because it doesn't jive with scripture at all and he told us check it out with the word well the word says over here in where we have chapter 2 verse 10 and the lord spake unto the fish and vomited out showing up on the dry land okay now you all raise little kids you know sometimes you get sick of the stomach right sometimes you're in traffic going 70 miles an hour and you've got a bad situation right now jonah's been over three days or about three days in this vomit and he is covered now this fish vomits him out on dry land now he's rolling in the sand really got a mess the only solution for brother jonah is go down to the car wash and get a bath then get some clean clothes and go preach because verse 1 of chapter 3 and the word of the lord came unto jonah the second time arise go to nineveh they great city and preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee okay so the object lesson here very clearly is that you might not have the luxury of a second chance the way jonah did you see he he got a second chance god could have left the digestive juices in the fish make nothing out of him it was a special fish and he got a second chance now a long time ago uh i'm sure most of you have read the uh i've seen the movie the ten commandments well that came out in 1955. the first color movie that came out was gone with the win 1939. so by 1955 they didn't even i think it was 55 or 56 is when color tv came out so here's the ten commandments and some of the people at the church and jeffersonville had seen it so they said oh brother brandon you need to save what's great okay so he gathers himself his wife and rebecca which she would have been nine years old at the time and they're going to go down to new albany uh a theater about half the size of this building and um and they're going to watch the movie well so they're sitting there you know and probably not too many about half the sizes i've been there once and um so they're watching the movie and you know on the screen they did so well that when the pillar of fire comes whirling onto the screen brother brandon the same thing he'd always say jumps up takes off his hat oh just a movie casey sits down yeah yeah it was so real well they weren't used to sitting in a four-hour movie so anyway they're going home and rebecca's crying he's nine years old he's very sensitive and so um uh brother bram said well honey what what's the matter and you know i just took a movie and all that but dad didn't you see of course to her like a newsreel you know and so on the movie moses says oh it's on the lord's side come with me you know so here's of course he says that so we're watching the people come with him but she's watching those people that waited for two minutes the earth opened up they're gone so she's feeling sorry for those people so brother brahms will okay now that you notice that let this be a lesson when god says something you move now not tomorrow not when grandma says it's okay and so forth you you moved right now and so that's a lesson now he got a second chance you might not get a second chance so he went and preached a very powerful anointing you can read all about in chapter three and um uh records the reaction of the people the preaching of the word of god greatest revival in recorded history the entire city of 120 000 turned to god stayed back the wrath of god they had a choice repent or perish with the unbelievers but guess what about 150 years later they forgot entirely about god forgot about the mercy forgiveness and god let the babylonians come down in 621 bc and utterly destroyed this powder so devastating was the destruction that the ruins were not even discovered just over 100 years ago 2500 years later oh here's nineveh pretty bad there's such a hatred to destroy and you can see that in the some of the people in the middle east right now they don't care they just want to destroy you see now scofield says such is the way of god light rejected brings destruction brother branham said in 1956 this year america is going to make a decision he says i believe shields right side the wrong way so he spoke that in 56 and we're seeing the effects of it now all these years later so um but god always warns first you see we're seeing the fulfillment of prophecy jonah was in fact a very crucial part of a much larger picture so much so that's repeated by our lord in matthew chapter 12. so here's the the point when you don't fully understand an issue or something that's going on or why paul did this or why rebecca did that um be still i'm gone i gotta figure it out don't need your opinions you know be careful because that could be part of a larger picture see jonah's whole ordeal here was part of a larger picture he wasn't out of the will of god he had this detour you know so god allows these scenes to play out in order to bring reactions to the surface then he can judge certain things so god has not called me or you or anybody else i know to straighten out the things that you think are out of order it would seem that god's man god's prophet of the age god's anointed messenger it would seem that he was backslidden stepped out of the will of god it would seem that way because we are mortals and we all have a canary brain some have a you know chicken brain and we're very small creatures we don't have all the facts see we make things up and we make knee jerk judgments on partial information now i spent a lot of time in the airports and um there was a time when we didn't have cell phones you know then cell phones came out and then everybody hadn't had the latest gadgets you know so here are these people walking around the airport they got a little something in their ear there's no phone nothing they're just talking away blah blah blah and of course the first time you see that wonder are these people insane but see there's somebody at the other end that's talking to them and so you're only hearing part of it and so based on what i hear i can make a judgment you're wrong and we do that you know on partial information so very few people in any given age recognize the value of the message of god during their day hindsight is great you see now we have for example simeon that lived near the temple and god told simmy now son i know you're old but you're not going to die until you see the salvation of israel you know the story and so whenever the dedication of babies you know say it's two days a week or something he would go out and he'd love no nothing today go back to sleep but then one day he goes out there ah there's the sign god show me that wasn't some big lie we don't know what it was nobody else saw it and um so he goes over and he was spirit-led and he was one of the few that recognized what god was doing in present tense he goes up to mary can i hold the baby so only mary and joseph and simeon knew what was going on nobody else they didn't look different they didn't have fine clothes on they were just like everybody else and so he raised the baby let that servant depart in peace my eyes have seen as salvation now our prophet says over here in questions and answers from hebrews this city of jeffersonville at the day of judgment will answer a great price someday for there have been hundreds and hundreds of outstanding healings done right here that's right right here signs and wonders the appearing of the angel down at the at the river and the papers blasted and so forth and still people don't believe why is that now someday i'm going to leave here he says i'm 48 years old why didn't the world recognize the picture you know the halo why didn't they catch that right quick why don't they catch these other things why don't they catch these prophecies and things you know they can't do it now but one day i'm going to leave this world and then when i leave they will recognize it some of you young people will realize that after i'm gone this day this scripture has been fulfilled 1964 the harvest time what did the lutherans do after the death of martin luther they met satan and made a denomination out of it and died she never done anything else after that it was done it just became a great mass of people okay now there's two tapes that if you haven't listened to him recently albuquerque new mexico april of 63. world falling apart and um um god and simplicity very different from anything else these two tapes stand alone things he says there doesn't say nowhere else now he just preached the seals now his pressure's off he's over here with the christian businessman and he's preaching he says you know you might not believe that but this is taped i listened to it a few years from today if there is such and then you will know whether it's true or not one day when the evening lights are breaking and it's too late then you'll say that man could have been right it's too late then just exactly like jesus said when he was here on earth quote god sent you all prophets down through the ages and um and what did you do with each one god sent the prophet you all killed him put him in the grave exactly and then in about another generation you wake up and realize that was a prophet and then what do you do you garnish a tomb what do you do make a tradition of his life that is exactly what israel had done moses every sabbath every saturday around the world they read a portion of their prophet a tradition moses they made a tradition of his life that's the way we do with martin luther john wesley and other men it says here we are always looking back making a tradition of their life garnishing their tombs and their message was for another day by the time you wake up that day is going to live by we're in another day the whole system has worked that way since the beginning man-made systems think about it so we got to give you the bad news is brother bram's life going to be different he says that's the way we do with all of them see so people are just now a lot of times realizing what this is all about we have the warning so when you don't understand when you don't have all the facts be careful amen amen okay let's hurry here um so jonah was god's prophet but as human he looked for the easy way no pressure all to agree pat on the back and many times god will he'll show us his will because it's real obvious yeah but you know grandma said and this and that and it's going to cost money and you know we got reservations in myrtle beach or whatever you know we discuss with the relatives and um looking for a consensus we're looking for the easy way brother branham says you have to struggle to do the will of god sometimes it's not easy but it will produce the best results so today we have message believers i call them book carriers because a lot of people like to carry the book but just can't live it it's too hard oh brother branham you know so we've got these book carriers willfully that's self will not god's will they're climbing onto boats that are headed to tarshish see god has ordained in his word a certain way god told jonah to go northeast he said i'm going to go away from the presence of god i'm going to go southwest and today there's other boats not 180 degrees off no there's just two degrees off well they got the same songs and you know it's okay sometimes they have the same guest speaker or whatever it looks like we're going in the same direction but when it's too late well this isn't the ship of zion after all huh it's just strange and so uh we're going in the wrong direction only too late they're not going to heaven they're going someplace else so yeah anointed once at the end time and they begin to check it out well this isn't even the ship of zion after all so friends you can have a leading now this is pretty deep stuff here you can have a leading you can have a doctrine a promise right out of the pages of the bible okay but if it's not in god's proper season flowing in the economy of god in the plan of god for the hour you'll be fighting the will of god you'll be fleeing from the presence of the living god thinking and believing you're right there's all kinds of people out there carrying these books in the same bible they're off the track they're not even in the same spirit you'll be choosing your will and not god's will not having rightly divided the word of truth you see and there will be a price to pay so revelation chapter four nowadays are so uh they say well we don't believe in saying hell in the pulpit we need men of god who won't hold back now everybody can't be a preacher that's obvious but you have a voice if if you're a preacher you're called to the pulpit to preach if you're not you're still a preacher but live the people a sermon how do we do that well when you with your long hair and your proper kind of dress go to the supermarket when people oh how are you doing sister okay they get a pass but the ones that look over there oh look at them they think there's something well they just cut their self off right there you're preaching you see let your sermon be lived and it's the voice of god that'll bring reproach to them who reject it just live your sermon just be natural the preachers call to preach his and live it too if you can't live it then stop preaching but you're supposed to live your sermons how we need in jeffersonville thousands of lived voices everybody that comes to this church while they go out and by the time they come back they should have lived their sermon out there they should see that something's different about you people you know um we need thousands of lived voices that's the thunder of god thundering out in what sweetness holiness purity undefiled lives walking around the earth today without a blemish yes sir real christians that's the thunder against the enemy the devil doesn't care how how loud you can holler he doesn't care how much you can jump or do this or that what hurts the devil is to see that sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him you want call him anything he's just as sweet as he can be and moves right on that throws him that's the thunder that shakes the devil not how much you memorize not how smart you are who your grandma is no no live your message [Music] a long time ago like 900 years ago there was a man called francis of assists all the catholics knew all about him but brother brahm said he was a gospel preacher and among other things he said um preach always use words when necessary oh that's different because you know we all got our little magic machine here and we blah blah blah blah if we don't know it we look it up you know it's all here everything but you just live your message and then if they ask a question what are you gonna do oh gotta call brother paul no you gotta have an answer if you've been in the church over six months you gotta know that there's five comings of elijah and that's where you start so you go look for them they're in there that's right yeah it's just it's bible because none of your neighbors no one of your neighbors has one iota about william brown they don't care they will if they can see the bible oh well you guys got a point okay so if we turn our back on the word maybe not openly like you know jonah opposite direction but just with indifference just with a bad attitude we are fleeing from the presence of the lord following an antichrist spirit and an antichrist doctrine yes soon you'll be anointed with arrogance and selfishness and self-righteousness respect of persons none of that comes from god i hope nobody here has any of that with you but you know we can pray with you so if we deviate just one degree off a true center see like this here you know i've got another one it's a little fancier than this it'll show you're off quarter inch eighth an inch what else you know there's nicer ones um i met a guy from canada once had one he said like five thousand dollars well can't carry that around you know but uh if you're off just one degree off a true center you're not going to hit the target because it just keeps getting wider and wider you know now a few years ago i took my boys over to africa rebecca always wanted to go so fine we got some money together some miles went over there and um so they're gonna go hunting okay so um we didn't take any guns because they got plenty of guns so we're out there in the wilderness and uh oh there comes that animal you know so they give stephen the shot so he shoots well he's he's a hunter so he of course didn't hit the animal but he knew that he was like three inches high or something so he says okay now animals are all scared now we gotta adjust this gun got to get zeroed in so he goes and um he puts a little kleenex out there at 50 yards and comes back here to adjust the sights the way he thinks it should be and where everybody goes out to look he was almost there within a half an inch so he comes back he adjusts it again he shoots and then they're going to go see again and i just sit still they say aren't you going no i know that he hit it i can tell you he hit it well he was the hero a man can actually you know shoot where you want to shoot with a gun so i don't know how they ever kill anything over there but he he was the star i mean he could actually hit the target you know so you have to be dead on for it to work so you know when mary and joseph took the little boy jesus and they took him down to jerusalem for the for the bar mitzvah and they're coming back well see that's a big thing all the families involved and so forth so they're coming back home to nazareth and they get to the end of the first day and they're going to set up camp and everything and mary says joseph where's the boy well i don't know i thought it was your day to watch him he wasn't there they thought he was with him you know well they had a lovely night didn't they so the next day they head back and they found him you know the whole story but one thing that is always amazing to me when they finally when they found him the next day uh mary's attitude i mean if you leave your child in you know downtown toledo someplace and you go back and look for him there he is next day well oh honey no she says jesus why did you do this to me you made me look bad it's right there in the bible but they they ventured off in the land of make-believe leaving behind the promise of god for the hour you see and many to do today are doing the same thing thinking that god is with them but their life doesn't show it their doctrine doesn't show it okay we're almost finished we have something here in 1964 looking under jesus it's possible today that good man fine men walking with christ reading his word still don't recognize this is the hour that certain things of this bible must be fulfilled it's the hour that we're living in the time is in hamlet these things must be done it's written and it must be fulfilled because god promised it yes our eyes must be opened to see the word now the pharisees had that word all drawn out you know they had their chart and here's going to happen this and then messiah and so forth they had it all figured out the way messiah was coming they believed they were right and there he was born there walked right amongst them they condemned him when he told him you know y'all need to search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and these are religious people these weren't you know communists they were they were bible believers they had the bible you know that moses and he says they testify me us search the scriptures we're moses disciples you know we come from certain places we know it all and he said if you would be moses disciples you would know that he wrote about me you see and so if they would have known moses writings they would have known him they thought they'd do moses writings but they didn't know it they were blinded to that fact so just a few words from him and what'd they do well this man's got a devil where'd he come from but they failed to see that the very god that promised the word was vindicating it right there through the person of jesus christ for he was the light of the hour he was the light for the people to walk in and only the word of god produces light god's word produces the sunshine now i don't know if you've thought about this but you know there's a there's a group of people in this great country of ours they call the flat earth society and they think this is the flat earth maybe they've never strayed too far from the house but they had a convention a couple years ago and they invited an astronaut to speak to him now the astronauts been up there and he saw this ball down here hanging in space it's round so i don't know what happened to that convention but this this ball ron it's just it's here what's holding it up and the moon goes around every 30 days you know and and the moon all this stuff but he says god's word produces the sunshine god's word produces the earth produces the air everything is the word of god made manifest everything that's got a reality to it so when he was here he said i am god besides me there is no other so look around be sensitive to your surroundings don't take things for granted don't assume that everybody's going to stop because you're coming through it doesn't work that way we live in an insane world also prophesied because in 1964 brother branham said if this goes on the way it is going right now in 50 years it'll be total insanity that friends was about seven years ago in 2014. so discern your surroundings be sure that he's with you check up our life our doctrine our experience has to match god's word not some explanation not because your favorite preacher no no we cannot afford any longer to live in a glare we gotta live now prepare for tomorrow see here we are uh what is this wednesday night you've already forgot what you had for breakfast monday morning you know that's passed that water went down the river it's gone you know and who knows if you're even going to get to the house tonight but you're living right now this is present reality see live for the day prepare for tomorrow because we are on a journey we're going someplace we're not going in circles we're going someplace we're going to the gate of the resurrection and when we get there then everything's cool everything's okay then god's in control you don't have to worry about a thing so we have a lot of religious tourists in our midst and they're collecting religious uh trinkets and souvenirs you know and they're right at the point of burning candles i know that's foreign to you guys but there's places that i know about the big picture brother branham burning candles people kneeling down to it i mean the idolatry is everywhere you know but the thing is they have no relationship with jesus christ you see the author and the finisher of eternal life and so brother brown says well that's the way it is today with people who call themselves christians oh i belong to church that's good but you see the reason there is so much trouble in the church he covers everything the reason there's so much trouble in the church the reason there's so much confusion in the church there's so much discontentment in the church not because jesus is not there it's because jesus can't gain access to the places he wants to go we have those little compartments hold on don't touch that you can come in that's far enough i'll join the church otherwise don't tell me how to run my business jesus wants to be the supreme ruler of your being and the only way he can bless you is when he becomes your lord lord is rulership so he's the creator have no secrets before him and when jesus comes in that's another message he wants to be welcomed now if you go over to brother paul's house and the door is locked you see him in there you knock knock knock and they ignore you that's not a welcome is it no that doesn't mean you're going to go there but you know if you go at least take a pie or something you know but people like to be welcomed he says but we got these little secret doors little bitty doors in our heart that we don't want jesus in there over the right-hand side of the human heart after jesus gets in it's a little door called pride now you can you know count this as drama or whatever you want but prophet usually knows what he's talking about a little door called pride oh i'll receive a savior but don't tell me what i have to do and how i have to dress what i have to do if i let it happen you know let my hair grow out stop smoking cigarettes going to the pool room i don't want nothing to do with it don't worry he won't stay too long you know very dangerous you know we do have a choice so if he's not lord of all he is calling you tonight he's giving you another opportunity to get things straightened out come to the foot of the cross you know we'd be glad to pray with you because this can be a turning point in your life i didn't just happen to come by here you know it's kind of out of the way i live in tennessee but if the musicians come up let's sing that song jesus i surrender all you know jesus i love you jesus i surrender because he knows who you are he knows where you're sitting he knows out there on online those people are sitting there kind of snickering maybe he knows what you need you know jesus jesus i surrender all stand together jesus i surrender all the kingdoms of my heart oh jesus jesus [Music] the kingdoms of my heart [Music] jesus be the lord [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] one more time i surrendered [Music] [Music] he [Music] you can use anything lord you can use me how many want to be available to him tonight if you can use anything long you can use me [Music] yes [Music] if you can use [Music] you can use me if you want to be available to him tonight [Music] use me jesus [Music] touch my heart [Music] listen to this now i want to live the way he wants me to live [Music] until there's just no that i want to just [Music] foreign [Music] me [Music] until there's just [Music] yes [Music] to enjoy that tonight i want to be in his perfect will sons of god and daughters of god and have have had six thousand years now 6 000 years to look back and see believers as examples to us where they get out of the will of god and some people are like jonah that actually pay the fee to head the other direction some of you are like that but other ones like you brought out tonight they just start to wander a little bit we just wander and uh we can get ourselves in the permissive little god we get ourselves in our own will and we just wandered just a little bit but after all these six thousand years and seeing men get off track and not will we're at a stage now with sons of god and humility say i don't want to even be in your permissive will lord i really want your perfect will the three things he gave us tonight he never works outside of the word and his spirit so if we wander a little bit from the word or we wander from his presence or we wonder from those things that we know can show us as will people make the will of god so mysterious what's the will of god but it's simplicity it's real simplicity stay in the word stay near the spirit say where god's speaking stay in that channel and everything that you need to know give it time be neutral wait upon the lord he will show you his path it'll become clear in front of you so that you can wall when we get hasty when we make decisions too hastily when we do all this that's where we get good off track the more time you can give something the more time you can give it god's greatest asset to show his will is time we give him time in prayer and stay in the word he wants to show his sons his perfect will he wants to show it to you we just got to stay on track amen brother george we really enjoyed this tonight thank you brother for coming stopping by encouraging us we appreciate it good word tonight and brother george of course we've had the church age book in the red one where the rap is studying that with in the class on sunday mornings at 10 30 and then we'll keep some tonight from him they also he also does it in a leather-bound volume it's very nice i got some of my boys some of those for christmas and my dad he really enjoyed it so we'll have some more of those in the library and then brother as brother shared tonight he does a lot of mission work a lot of things if you wanted to give a an offering to straight to him tonight you can read it write it to believers international uh you can give it right to him and just outside here for a fellowship or if you give it through the church and write it for brother george then we'll make sure that he gets that he does a lot of work has a lot of needs and it's good to work in coordination with him as he knows spanish he grew up with his family down in the spanish-speaking countries and his dad was a missionary and such and so god really formed his life to be able to so greatly used now when the message needs to get out to the spanish countries god's used him so incredibly for that and still using them and so we appreciate his work and his labor and sacrifice and we want to stand behind his work the new seal book coming out not only in english but in spanish and these different things we want to support it there's a huge demand the demand is growing and brother jim and i just we want to the congregation to be a part of these things as you give in your mission giving we want to be a part of it and one way we know we're in the will of god is when we're given to missions can you say man you might be the youngest teenager here tonight but say lord i'm praying for you will or it might be 18 19 20 say i'm praying free will who do i marry what career do i have why don't you start with just giving some of your funds to missions just get in that channel first and say you know if you start doing things that you know that are in his will then maybe he'll meet bring mr right along mr perfect will ma answer your other request amen start start being giving to the lord be a part of god's work that's going on around the world and we always as a congregation want to have a great part in that lower our expenses here at church so most of our funds can go to the needs every other place but you personally have to be involved in that say lord what can i give to help out in other needs i don't want to be selfish with my money i want to be able to have a part in it and if it's a soul saved on the other side brother bran makes a comment he says you'll have a part and the other side in the reward forgiven towards that you'll have a part in that there'll be stars in your crown as well because you have and get to meet the person that came to the lord as a result of you giving amen father we thank you for your word tonight thank you for brother george smith his testimony his life carrying on lord with the gift that you've given him and the great burden he has carried for all these years to get the message out in spanish to the whole world we're thankful for that lord we've had a little part in that but brother george has had a huge part lord may you bless him may you give him traveling mercies in his vehicle there as he goes to the different places may you prosper greatly prosper his work lord give him the funds to do the things that he needs to do and i pray you'll just bless him we're thankful for this word tonight may it be our request tonight lord that we find and walk in every day your perfect will may we never get away from your presence or run from your presence the way we stay right there lord and fulfill your divine and perfect will for our lives
