[27:47] if you join
[27:48] me Joel chapter 2 and verse we'll start
[27:52] reading here at uh verse 28 Joel chapter
[27:56] 2 and verse 28
[28:04] we want to remember in prayer brother
[28:05] Colin I was just asking for a report
[28:07] from him from Israel and most of you are
[28:10] probably Tak keeping up with the news so
[28:13] we know Israel is fighting on almost
[28:15] three fronts now okay that hasn't
[28:17] happened in quite a while as far as it
[28:19] becomes a war uh it's just too similar
[28:22] to the scripture that talks about the
[28:24] Army surrounding Israel I don't know if
[28:26] this the time but boy theyve we fighting
[28:28] on three front fronts now the North and
[28:31] the East and and also then the South and
[28:34] so uh they're very determined that this
[28:36] is going to be a war for a long time so
[28:38] we need to pray for Israel pray for the
[28:40] saints of God there pray for brother
[28:42] Colin pastoring the church there and we
[28:44] just remember them it's atrocities that
[28:46] has been done to Israel never before has
[28:49] it been this barbaric what they've done
[28:51] to the babies and and the children and
[28:53] just different ones uh that they it's
[28:56] just very barbaric so so uh God will I
[28:59] think defend and bring Vengeance for his
[29:01] people and protect his people and be
[29:03] with them but this is a a real rough
[29:05] time for all of the country of Israel so
[29:07] let's just remember them in prayer daily
[29:10] before the Lord I pray trust you would
[29:11] do that Joel chapter 2 and verse 28 and
[29:15] it shall come to pass afterward that I
[29:18] will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[29:20] and your sons and your daughters shall
[29:23] prophesy your old men shall dream dreams
[29:26] your young men shall see visions and
[29:29] also upon the servants and upon the
[29:31] handmaids in those days will I pour out
[29:34] my spirit and I will show I want you to
[29:37] notice a little bit of the change I want
[29:39] to read the rest to to verse 32 and I'll
[29:42] bring up this this uh change and
[29:44] prophecy that happens at verse 30 and I
[29:46] will show wonders in the heavens and in
[29:48] the earth blood and fire and pillars of
[29:51] smoke the sun shall be turned into
[29:53] darkness and the moon into blood before
[29:56] the Great great and the terrible day of
[29:59] the Lord how many remember that term
[30:01] before the great and terrible day of the
[30:03] Lord how many remember where that
[30:04] scripture is at Malachi 45 and6 which is
[30:08] speaks of that slot of Elijah coming
[30:10] before the great and Dreadful day of the
[30:12] Lord so here it has it too so we know
[30:14] what day we're talking about here now
[30:16] it's in our time because this is a time
[30:18] when the the the the sun's turned to
[30:20] Darkness the moon's turned into blood
[30:22] this is just coming into tribulation
[30:24] before the great and ter terrible day of
[30:26] the Lord and it shall come to pass that
[30:29] whosoever shall call on the name of the
[30:31] Lord shall be delivered for in Mount
[30:34] Zion and in Jerusalem shall be
[30:37] Deliverance as the Lord hath said and in
[30:40] the remnant whom the Lord shall call you
[30:44] you got to say thank God because in that
[30:47] time he says even at that time whoever
[30:50] will call upon the name of the Lord I'll
[30:51] deliver them praise be to God and he
[30:54] says if there's a Remnant I believe it's
[30:56] talking about about the bride out of all
[30:58] Christianity there will be a bride of g
[31:00] a gentile bride but there will also be
[31:02] 144,000 of Israel can you say Amen so
[31:05] out of all of that if they'll call on
[31:07] the Lord God will bring a Remnant out of
[31:09] all that mess heavenly father bless your
[31:11] word tonight as we teach it and we pray
[31:13] you'll give us the voice and the
[31:15] strength we pray you'll bless our time
[31:17] together in the name of Jesus Christ
[31:19] amen God bless you may be seated now in
[31:23] covering the three main Prophecies of
[31:26] the Holy Ghost from the Old Testament
[31:29] and so we covered one uh in Isaiah we
[31:32] covered one in Ezekiel this past Sunday
[31:36] and then now tonight I'm taking the last
[31:39] main prophecy for the holy ghost coming
[31:41] in Joel
[31:43] 228 um so we we want to understand uh
[31:47] what it what the Holy Ghost is and what
[31:49] we want to understand what it is just a
[31:51] little more tonight how many's come to
[31:53] understand the Holy Ghost just a little
[31:54] bit more tonight if you'll have that
[31:56] desire then I believe God has something
[31:58] for us so we come to understand the Holy
[32:00] Ghost in each of these times we bring it
[32:02] and talk about it in the next in the
[32:04] last few weeks and maybe in the coming
[32:06] weeks we just want to understand it more
[32:09] and so we've in tonight you're going to
[32:12] find a real distinction again in the
[32:15] demonstrations of the Holy Ghost when he
[32:18] comes and the signs of the Holy Ghost
[32:21] and we're going to make a distinction
[32:22] between the demonstrations and the signs
[32:26] uh from the actions of it and what it
[32:28] does according to the word we have to
[32:31] draw a distinction because when his
[32:33] Spirit pours there's a lot of
[32:35] demonstration and there's a lot of act
[32:37] there's a lot of things that happen the
[32:40] gifts of the Spirit and prophecies and
[32:42] different things because he's pouring
[32:43] out his spirit and so and and all that's
[32:46] of God all that's a a wonderful thing
[32:48] but we have to realize there's a
[32:50] distinction and brother brandom gives us
[32:52] and actually talking about the evidence
[32:55] of the Holy Ghost for you he says don't
[32:58] look so much for the demonstrations as
[33:00] an Evidence but look for the action of
[33:02] the Holy Ghost what it does according to
[33:06] the word so he be so if he draws that
[33:10] distinction he never does away from the
[33:12] manifestations of the Holy Ghost the
[33:14] signs of the Holy Ghost the tongues
[33:16] whatever it is he never does away he
[33:18] wouldn't be a true Prophet to do that
[33:19] it's scriptural it happens when his
[33:22] spirit moves uh things happen can you
[33:24] say amen and and this is a ter in the
[33:27] Bible that says I will pour out my
[33:30] spirit upon All Flesh so a lot of people
[33:34] will be affected by the pouring out of
[33:36] the spirit but I want to draw a
[33:38] distinction when he comes that he has a
[33:42] a distinctive thing to do and that is he
[33:44] don't just want to give a blessing to
[33:46] your flesh he doesn't want to just give
[33:49] a prophecy he's going deeper than that
[33:52] and that is to fill people with the Holy
[33:54] Ghost so he comes for a reason he comes
[33:57] for a purpose but we don't dump out e
[34:00] either thing I'm just going to go ahead
[34:01] and say this I was going to say it at
[34:02] the end is that when he's moving when
[34:04] God is around there's noise most of the
[34:06] time there's noise people don't think I
[34:09] believe that I believe that when God
[34:10] moves there's usually
[34:13] noise and that's why you have the
[34:15] minister say and I think even brother
[34:16] bradam says and ministers quote it all
[34:18] the time he says if you've got a dead
[34:20] religion religion you ought to bury it
[34:22] because anything dead you need to bury
[34:24] and if there's no action to it there's
[34:26] no you know there's no nothing going on
[34:28] you need to bury that religion I believe
[34:30] that with all my heart I believe that
[34:32] God when he's around that there's noise
[34:35] but listen now I believe when there's a
[34:37] new birth and a born again experience
[34:38] taking place I don't believe there's any
[34:40] noise to that because it's at a soul
[34:44] level didn't get as amen many amens to
[34:47] that but now I'm going from the the the
[34:50] teaching of Jesus and what Jesus said
[34:53] when when you're born again he said the
[34:55] the wind bloweth where it listeth and
[34:58] thou hears the sound but you can't tell
[35:00] when it came or when it
[35:02] went so is everyone that's born again of
[35:06] the spirit of God so you have both
[35:09] things there's not a noise of what's
[35:11] going on in the soul that's a quiet
[35:13] thing between you and God but when he
[35:16] comes there's always noise on the
[35:18] outside there's always rejoicing and if
[35:20] you get a real CH change you're going to
[35:23] be emotional in some way you may cry but
[35:26] when God's moving on your heart and
[35:28] God's changing your heart and there's
[35:30] stimulation of Revelation strike in your
[35:32] heart you're you're going to be happy
[35:34] about it there's going to be noise can
[35:37] you say amen and some will get loud
[35:38] shouting some will just cry it we're not
[35:41] we're not manipulating what would happen
[35:43] in the side of the emotion but just know
[35:45] when he comes he says Sons and Daughters
[35:48] some will prophesy the young some will
[35:50] have dreams can you say Amen this is
[35:52] what happens when the Holy Spirit comes
[35:54] around but we almost we we must always
[35:57] draw a Distinction on the inward work
[36:00] that's going on and not look to any
[36:03] manifestation on the outside as an
[36:06] evidence that you have it is that okay
[36:09] with
[36:10] everybody that's where we we we the
[36:13] waters start to get muddy and the
[36:14] confusion is that his Spirit pours out
[36:17] and upon All Flesh and we're affected by
[36:19] it and we're enjoying the presence and
[36:20] the blessings of God and he's doing many
[36:23] things but you must make sure that you
[36:25] don't depend on just an emotion you need
[36:28] a change in the heart you need a desire
[36:31] change you need the real genuine baptism
[36:34] of the Holy Ghost on the soul level can
[36:37] you say Amen so we want all these things
[36:39] we never preach any of them out of the
[36:41] church we never have for 35 years here
[36:44] we know when the spirit moves we know
[36:46] he's moving in this last evening time we
[36:49] want to be available and and I tell you
[36:51] this when he moves you ought to jump in
[36:53] and move with it you ought to respond to
[36:55] it can you say Amen cuz what can he do
[36:57] in that he can do healings he can do all
[36:59] kinds of things but most of all he can
[37:01] save you he can have born a born again
[37:04] experience and change your life so don't
[37:06] be hesitant of the spirit of God moving
[37:08] jump into it step into the water wait
[37:11] out a little bit deeper can you say Amen
[37:14] wet your feet in the water of his love
[37:15] when he moves you better move in that
[37:17] and take advantage of the situation
[37:19] because today there's so much to take us
[37:22] away from the spirit of God and make us
[37:23] cold when he moves even if it's in your
[37:26] Bible study and his presence there you
[37:28] move with it and say I'll raise my hands
[37:30] before the presence of God right now
[37:33] because I feel his
[37:37] presence the two things that we must
[37:39] rightly divide are are are these things
[37:43] between the manifestations of the spirit
[37:45] and so that's what we'll do tonight
[37:47] we'll talk a little bit about that there
[37:48] must be a distinction and the
[37:49] distinction could be said this way I'll
[37:52] continue to talk about a little bit in
[37:53] the middle of the pouring out in the
[37:56] middle of the pouring out of the spirit
[37:57] because he said in the last days how
[37:59] many know that when he says in this
[38:00] prophecy in in in the in when those days
[38:03] come I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[38:06] Flesh how many know that began in the
[38:08] upper room on the day of Pentecost and
[38:10] how do we know that when they asked
[38:12] Peter what's going on he went right to
[38:14] this scripture and he it doesn't say the
[38:17] last days in Joel 2:28 Peter added that
[38:20] he said in the last days I'll pour out
[38:22] my spirit and I'm going to tell you why
[38:24] in a minute why he said it was the last
[38:26] days but I'll pour out my spirit upon
[38:28] All Flesh Peter went right to this
[38:30] scripture because this is the word that
[38:32] God was fulfilling right then and so
[38:35] remember I said you always go back to
[38:37] the word what's happening God's moving
[38:39] but God doesn't move outside of his word
[38:41] God does not move us outside of his word
[38:43] being fulfilled so if it's him moving
[38:46] there's a scripture there's a prophecy
[38:48] there's something there that you can go
[38:50] back say this is that what's going on
[38:53] here is right here in the scripture it's
[38:55] never just some mysterious thing it's in
[38:58] the Bible it's in the word and the very
[39:00] reason he's there is to make that word
[39:02] for that day
[39:04] live that's why the Holy Ghost is there
[39:06] you'll never find him uh operating
[39:08] outside of pointing the people back to
[39:10] the word and making that word live
[39:12] that's the evidence is Holy Ghost is
[39:13] there that's the reason he's there and
[39:15] so now I'll pour out my spirit upon All
[39:17] Flesh and in the middle of this pouring
[39:20] out when it starts on the day of
[39:22] Pentecost in the middle of this pouring
[39:24] out he also is building another
[39:27] Masterpiece Bride for seven Church ages
[39:30] he's going to begin to build as I preach
[39:33] Sunday the Masterpiece was Jesus all the
[39:36] Old Testament he's building the
[39:37] Masterpiece and he finally gets back to
[39:40] Jesus Christ which is his Masterpiece
[39:42] which is the restoration of where his
[39:44] Masterpiece Adam had failed he failed
[39:47] God says I'll rebuild it back again and
[39:49] Jesus was the final M or at least we
[39:51] thought was the final Masterpiece but
[39:53] then like Michelangelo struck that that
[39:56] Moses and that statue and said speak God
[40:00] struck Jesus there and they struck that
[40:02] and out of him came a spirit because
[40:04] brother Braham says God was going to
[40:06] build another Masterpiece off of that
[40:09] which is that piece that was taken out
[40:11] of Christ and it was going to be his
[40:13] wife He restored Adam now he's got to
[40:16] restore
[40:17] Eve he had a masterpiece Adam second
[40:20] Adam now he's going to build for seven
[40:22] Church ages a masterpiece bride because
[40:26] the Eve had to be restored too it wasn't
[40:29] just Adam it was Eve it was you it was
[40:32] the people of God and so now he strikes
[40:35] it there's a piece off the Masterpiece
[40:37] and out of that piece at Pentecost he
[40:40] begins to build a masterpiece so let me
[40:44] let's just bring it a bit deeper here
[40:46] you holding on with
[40:48] me he's in the middle of the pouring out
[40:51] of his Spirit he's building another
[40:54] Masterpiece bride and he begins to build
[40:56] it thus the works and the manifestations
[40:59] of his spirit being poured out and the
[41:02] true purpose of his spirit being poured
[41:04] out is a mystery of the second
[41:08] Eve he's pouring out a spirit but what's
[41:10] the purpose of it there's a
[41:12] mystery there's a bride that was within
[41:15] Christ like Eve was within
[41:18] Adam and so now if I pour out my spirit
[41:22] upon All Flesh if God says I'm going to
[41:23] pour my there's a purpose behind it he's
[41:25] going to be begin to build in the
[41:28] mystery of the pouring out of his Spirit
[41:29] he's going to build a second Eve
[41:31] restored and that's the mystery of
[41:33] Christ that's the mystery of this whole
[41:35] thing of the spirit coming into the
[41:37] church and that means that he may pour
[41:39] out his Spirit but his elect from every
[41:42] age are not only going to get a feeling
[41:44] in the Holy Spirit or just a a baptism
[41:47] on their Spirit they're actually going
[41:48] to be that mystery bride and if they're
[41:50] elect they're going to get the Born
[41:52] Again experienced by the word and they
[41:54] will be attached they will be in come
[41:56] back into Oneness with their maker again
[41:58] with Christ again so he's going to build
[42:00] a bride and thus all the manifestations
[42:03] of the spirit being poured out that's
[42:06] that's beautiful when it within itself
[42:07] it's just the pouring out of the spirit
[42:09] I will pour out my spirit listen we're
[42:12] finished without
[42:16] that we ought to say Thank You Lord that
[42:20] you promis to pour out your spirit I
[42:22] tell you I've been blessed because God
[42:24] has poured out his Spirit on me and he
[42:26] continues to do it and sometimes I don't
[42:28] even deserve it but service after
[42:30] service after service day after day I
[42:33] know that God is pouring out his Spirit
[42:35] on
[42:36] me we've been blessed here Saints for 35
[42:40] years God has blessed us over and over
[42:42] again by pouring out his Spirit Upon
[42:46] Us amen so now this second Eve though is
[42:49] what he's trying to get to so if we
[42:50] don't make that distinction between what
[42:53] God is really doing by the pouring out
[42:55] of the spirit we tend to make the
[42:57] manifestation or the sign the evidence
[43:00] that there's life there or a new birth
[43:02] there in the soul and that is not true
[43:04] when he pours out his spirit it's for a
[43:07] purpose and that's to make the word of
[43:10] that day live and then to live that word
[43:13] for that day to live it out in the
[43:16] people not just through an outside
[43:18] manifestation but to live it out in the
[43:20] people the word for that day is not to
[43:24] stay in the Bible it's to become flesh
[43:26] in the people of God so Joel 2:28 became
[43:31] flesh not in a Bible not in the priest
[43:34] not in the Pharisees his people that by
[43:36] the way didn't have any positions were
[43:38] poor people can you say Amen did not
[43:41] have any prestige in the world and you
[43:43] notice the scripture says I love this he
[43:44] says I'll pour this Spirit upon upon
[43:47] servants and
[43:49] handmaids upon the poor there's no more
[43:52] positions because we make it all
[43:54] positions that you got to go to 10 years
[43:56] of Seminary before God deals with you in
[43:58] this pouring out of the spirit you don't
[44:00] have to have any Seminary he'll pour it
[44:02] out on the handmaids he'll pour it on
[44:04] your sons he'll pour it out on daughters
[44:07] he says young men and young women will
[44:09] have dreams and prophesy he'll pour it
[44:11] out on the young
[44:12] people it's not going to school to a
[44:14] Pharisee school or denominational school
[44:17] for years he said I'm pouring this and
[44:19] it'll happen even on the young people
[44:21] I'll pour out my spirit that's why at 16
[44:25] years old while I was was sitting in the
[44:26] audience he poured out his spirit and I
[44:28] was filled with the Holy Ghost and I
[44:30] didn't even know my Bible yet I didn't
[44:32] even know anything yet I and I still
[44:35] don't know anything but I didn't know
[44:37] nothing and God still poured his Spirit
[44:40] Within
[44:41] Me glory be to God you ought to be happy
[44:45] tonight that you don't have a reach a
[44:46] certain level in Bible knowledge before
[44:48] God deals with you he said I'll pour out
[44:51] my spirit on your sons on your daughters
[44:53] on handmaids on servants
[44:58] on the unknowns on the people that
[45:00] aren't
[45:01] popular on the prostitutes on the drug
[45:04] addicts can you say Amen I'll pour it on
[45:06] anybody who will receive
[45:08] it all the positions is out the
[45:11] door and the Pharisees had all these
[45:14] positions and levels that you reaped and
[45:16] all the little people they were just lay
[45:18] members and then when you get into the
[45:20] new church nickan comes along and it's
[45:23] conquer the Ley all the Holiness is in
[45:24] the Pulpit pulp with the preach with the
[45:27] preacher and the priest and all all the
[45:29] no they took the Catholic church and all
[45:31] the systems took the Bible away from the
[45:33] people and said you can't interpret that
[45:34] you can't read that we'll read it for
[45:36] you nickan ISM but the Holy Ghost said
[45:39] no no I'll pour it upon All
[45:43] Flesh you don't have to go to Seminary
[45:46] for 10 years study your Bible study the
[45:49] word but you don't have to have a
[45:51] certain level before God starts to deal
[45:53] with you you could be a prostitute
[45:55] sitting there and his spirit is poured
[45:56] out on you somebody say praise the
[45:59] Lord and you ought to raise your hand
[46:01] and say I wasn't deserving but the
[46:04] spirit poured out on me and hopefully it
[46:06] poured inside of you there was a change
[46:08] in your life you didn't deserve that but
[46:12] you didn't have to have a certain
[46:13] Prestige for God to do it he just did it
[46:16] you open your heart boy Lord I feel the
[46:19] presence of the Lord here I'm jumping
[46:20] right in Lord fill me tonight and God
[46:23] says all right I'll fill you
[46:27] fixing to get excited tonight on a
[46:30] Wednesday night I'm fixing to run the
[46:32] aisles he pours out his Spirit upon All
[46:36] Flesh Sons and Daughters will prophesy
[46:39] oh man they'll dream dreams and servants
[46:41] and handma I'll handmaids I'll pour out
[46:44] my spirit slaves can you say Amen that
[46:47] aren't deserving and people that are the
[46:49] lowest estate and that's why uh brother
[46:52] BR says that Peter and Paul and all of
[46:54] them they didn't silver and gold have I
[46:55] know they weren't rich people uh for
[46:58] were no didn't have any money can you
[47:00] say Amen in the song that I wrote for my
[47:02] Dad recently I said my dad's like Peter
[47:05] Silver and Gold Have I None but whatever
[47:07] I have give I to you in the name of the
[47:09] Lord rise up and
[47:12] walk these these preachers he says New
[47:15] Testament preachers didn't have any
[47:16] money he said I'm like that myself don't
[47:18] have any money that's a new testament
[47:20] preacher but God gave him the most
[47:22] valuable
[47:23] thing the spirit of God amen his
[47:28] spirit so we have three main references
[47:31] in the Old Testament concerning the
[47:34] prophecy of this holy ghost coming and
[47:36] we've dealt with the first two hopefully
[47:38] you've got something out of that and
[47:39] enjoyed it but now tonight we're into
[47:42] now I I wanted to say that's the three
[47:44] main references I found some others
[47:46] today that are references with the same
[47:48] wording almost about the spirit coming
[47:50] if you want to write them down right now
[47:52] or I can send them to you there are
[47:54] three or four other references to
[47:56] prophecies that the holy ghost coming
[47:58] numbers 11:29 all the way back there and
[48:02] I might bring this up a little bit later
[48:03] if I have time but Moses was complaining
[48:06] a bit to God because he was handing all
[48:08] the burden of the people all this two
[48:10] million people upon himself and and so
[48:13] God said take 70 of the elders and the B
[48:16] Bible says he distributed his spirit and
[48:19] split his Spirit up upon these seven
[48:21] Elders to help Moses out so then uh his
[48:25] his servant came to Moses and he was a
[48:26] little bit irritated because there was a
[48:28] couple guys that didn't show up at the
[48:30] Tabernacle they didn't come to church
[48:31] that day but because they were part of
[48:33] the 70 God still split some of his
[48:35] spirit and this guy he was say they
[48:37] don't need it they didn't show up they
[48:38] didn't come to church and so they and
[48:41] and this is what Moses said in numbers
[48:43] 11:29 and Moses said unto him envest
[48:46] thou for my sake would God would to God
[48:50] that all of the Lord's people were
[48:52] prophets and that the Lord would put his
[48:55] spirit Spirit upon all of
[48:58] them now right there we really have a
[49:01] prophecy of the same thing in joob 2 228
[49:05] I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[49:09] in the Old Testament we see most of that
[49:11] come on the prophet so they can be
[49:13] anointed to speak thus sayeth the Lord
[49:15] but Moses said you know what God's heart
[49:17] is his heart is is that all of his
[49:20] people would be prophets and he would
[49:22] split his Spirit into all people
[49:26] amen he's prophesying because in the day
[49:28] of Pentecost it wasn't going to just be
[49:31] prophets it wasn't just going to be the
[49:33] popular people or the people that are
[49:35] even around Jesus there was 120 a lot of
[49:37] them we don't even know their names and
[49:39] God did what he said said to Moses Moses
[49:42] said he said would to God that all of
[49:45] God's people were prophets and would to
[49:47] God that he could split his Spirit and
[49:49] the Lord would put his Spirit upon them
[49:52] that's numbers 11:29 Proverbs 1:23 says
[49:56] I will pour out my spirit upon you
[49:59] Isaiah 32:15 says until the spirit be
[50:02] poured upon us it's all prophecy about
[50:05] his spirit being poured on poured out
[50:08] and the LA uh Isaiah 44:3 says pour upon
[50:12] thy seed the holy spirit will pour upon
[50:15] thy seed and thy Offspring well I
[50:18] latched on to that I want to put that in
[50:19] a a plaque or something on my wall
[50:22] because I have a promise that he'll pour
[50:24] out his spirit upon my seed and upon my
[50:27] Offspring and I'm holding to that I'm
[50:30] going to pray till all of my Offspring
[50:33] grandchildren all receive that blessing
[50:36] that his Spirit would be poured out upon
[50:39] them rather the riches and inheritance
[50:42] and my will and all that God I'll take
[50:44] that promise pour your spirit upon my
[50:47] Offspring and the last one is Ezekiel
[50:49] 37:14 he says I will pour my spirit upon
[50:52] you so it's I'll WR them again in case
[50:54] you're writing them down to 11 numbers
[50:56] 11:29 Proverbs
[50:58] 1:23 Isaiah
[51:01] 32:15 and Isaiah
[51:03] 443 and Ezekiel
[51:06] 37:14 all are scriptures in the Old
[51:10] Testament that for tell the pouring out
[51:13] of his Spirit coming but I'm dealing
[51:16] with just the main three ones and I'm
[51:18] the three ones that speak specifically
[51:20] about it and they're the main ones that
[51:22] are used and this Joel 228 is the last
[51:26] one here that I will speak about and all
[51:28] of these other ones foretell the
[51:30] dispensation of the pouring out upon All
[51:33] Flesh of the spirit of God now um I see
[51:38] the pouring out of his spirit being not
[51:41] just in the uh Upper Room on the day of
[51:45] Pentecost but I I I might blow your mind
[51:48] tonight but this dispensation that I'm
[51:50] calling out of I will pour out my spirit
[51:54] began at Pentecost but continues
[51:57] throughout the church ages until our
[52:00] day so I'm going to call that the
[52:02] dispensation of the pouring out of the
[52:05] Holy Ghost because he had never
[52:07] fulfilled anything where he poured his
[52:09] Spirit upon All Flesh he had never done
[52:11] that before mostly it was the prophets
[52:13] and then people would get anointed by
[52:14] the Holy Ghost David got anointed by the
[52:17] Holy Ghost they were affected by the
[52:18] spirit but never has he had a place that
[52:21] there's going to begin a time I'm going
[52:22] to pour out my spirit upon All Flesh so
[52:25] it's a dispensation of about 2,000 years
[52:29] that he he fulfills this dispensation of
[52:32] the Holy Ghost and pouring out of his
[52:34] Spirit or I'm going to call this
[52:36] dispensation and hold on with me now I'm
[52:38] not going to make it uh I don't want to
[52:39] make it complicated but I brother
[52:41] brandom called that dispensation of the
[52:43] Holy Ghost or the dispensation of the
[52:45] Son of God now we think the dispensation
[52:48] of the Son of God is when he was here
[52:49] for uh 33 years on the Earth but the the
[52:53] brother brandom and Jesus himself called
[52:55] that dispensation he came in the office
[52:58] of Son of Man
[53:00] Prophet so he referred to himself even
[53:03] though they say Jesus thou son of D
[53:06] David and so now they would refer to him
[53:08] as son of David but he wasn't coming in
[53:10] that office yet they referred to him as
[53:12] Son of God but he wasn't really fully in
[53:14] that office but he was in most most
[53:16] denominations and people would think
[53:17] well that was his dispensation of Son of
[53:19] God but actually it was more son of man
[53:22] because he was the prophet he was the
[53:24] god prophet he was the the ultimate
[53:25] Prophet there and he was in flesh uh
[53:28] acting out what all the prophets did but
[53:31] now the fullness of it it was son of man
[53:33] and then brother brandham calls the Holy
[53:35] Ghost dispensation the Son of God the
[53:38] Holy Ghost so who it is it's the son
[53:42] Christ and his people because on the day
[53:44] of Pentecost and after that the people
[53:46] looked at the the ones coming out of the
[53:48] upper room and then days after they said
[53:51] the people took note that they had been
[53:52] with Jesus they seen the same Jesus
[53:54] living in them him the same Works how
[53:56] many know Jesus said the works that I do
[53:58] shall you do also so he's continuing the
[54:01] same works of himself now in people that
[54:04] are sborn Jesus wasn't sborn we're sborn
[54:07] what a miracle that God would fill you
[54:09] with his spirit and you would be Jesus
[54:12] to your generation a sborn brother or
[54:15] sister that came to the Lord my that's a
[54:18] miracle that's a great mystery I can see
[54:22] God coming in his fullness in Jesus
[54:24] Christ without sin but take a sin born
[54:28] prostitute or or some type of person
[54:32] that's in the drugs of sin can you say
[54:34] amen and God said I'll take them out of
[54:36] the myy clay I'll wash them as I preach
[54:39] Sunday I'll change their Spirit I'll
[54:41] change their Stony heart and then I'm
[54:43] going to take my spirit and put that
[54:45] within
[54:47] them that's a real real miracle and he
[54:51] says it was a paradox all the paradoxes
[54:53] of God the Miracles the signs he said
[54:55] but the greatest Paradox is when Christ
[54:57] comes in your
[54:58] life you are a paradox tonight said that
[55:01] to a sister at breakfast my wife and I
[55:03] meeting praise the Lord and then last
[55:06] night meeting with a sister that had a
[55:08] tremendous both of them had tremendous
[55:10] testimonies of how the Lord's brought
[55:11] him and I looked at the sister last
[55:13] night I said you know you're a paradox
[55:15] right she said yeah I read that message
[55:16] all the time you are a paradox greater
[55:19] than signs Miracles and wonders you are
[55:21] a
[55:22] paradox it's amazing you're sitting here
[55:25] with a heart to hear the word of God
[55:27] what you've been through you should not
[55:28] be here but you're a paradox glory be to
[55:32] God you're a paradox here tonight you're
[55:35] a miracle that you're sitting here if
[55:36] you're saying amen from your soul that's
[55:38] a paradox that's a
[55:41] miracle I don't care what the devil told
[55:43] you
[55:44] today you just say not today
[55:48] Satan I'm a paradox of God I'm a miracle
[55:51] of God blessed be his name so now now in
[55:55] this dispensation of the Son of God the
[55:57] Holy Ghost it's not when Jesus was here
[56:00] 33 years ago but the prophet referred to
[56:02] he was in the office of son of man when
[56:04] he was here those years and then
[56:06] remember Jesus said there'll be a repeat
[56:09] of the son of man ministry again profit
[56:12] to the Gentiles because if God gave son
[56:14] a man to the Jews then he'd have to give
[56:17] it to the Gentiles so there'll be a
[56:19] repeat a shorter repeat of the son of
[56:22] man Ministry Prophet uh
[56:26] in in the evening time at the LA very
[56:28] last days it'll be son of man again but
[56:30] through 2,000 years of seven Church ages
[56:33] it's Son of God it's the Holy Ghost
[56:36] poured out upon the people but then
[56:39] there's another repeat of the son of man
[56:41] before the Rapture and one place or two
[56:44] places the prophet uses that term the
[56:47] son of man he's son of man he's Son of
[56:50] God in the Holy Ghost dispensation for
[56:52] 2,000 years then he's son of man and
[56:55] then he becomes son of David in the
[56:57] Millennium it's another Office King son
[56:59] of David Son of son of David is the is
[57:02] the is the king that'll Rule and Reign
[57:05] so now he was in the uh the office of
[57:07] son of man and so with this son of man
[57:10] re there's two places that he says this
[57:13] son of man husband and
[57:19] wife son of man husband and wife now we
[57:22] think the the calling of the son of man
[57:24] the the office is just a prophet it is
[57:27] it is God coming in the flesh of a
[57:29] prophet God working through a prophet
[57:31] but when he says husband and wife that's
[57:33] perfect with this masterpiece because if
[57:36] he's finishing the second Adam and
[57:37] making a man he's got to bring the
[57:39] second Eve back again so really the
[57:42] Fulfillment of the son of man Ministry
[57:45] is not just a onean
[57:48] Ministry but husband and wife groom and
[57:51] bride Christ and his bride yes that's
[57:55] the ministry we're under now and matter
[57:58] of fact might as well say it we we we've
[58:00] left the dispensation and moved to
[58:02] another dispensation that's why brother
[58:04] Brown could called it the bride age
[58:06] because once you come out of just a Son
[58:08] of God where it's the pouring out of the
[58:10] spirit and you move into son of man now
[58:12] we're talking God finishing the
[58:14] finishing touches on a word bride a word
[58:18] bride
[58:19] Masterpiece so that she can come in
[58:21] Union be married to him and go in a
[58:23] Rapture in a millennium a honeymoon of a
[58:25] thousand years right how'd you like a
[58:28] honeymoon like
[58:33] that how would you like a honeymoon of a
[58:35] thousand
[58:36] years can't afford it
[58:39] right but that's what he's going to give
[58:41] when he finishes us up it's not just
[58:43] going to be a pouring out of his spirit
[58:45] it's going to be molding a masterpiece
[58:48] bride so he does that under the son of
[58:51] man he finishes it under the son of man
[58:53] and so Jesus referred to himself as the
[58:55] son of man the 2,000 years of seven
[58:58] Church Ages was the Son of God the Holy
[59:00] Ghost and the reason that I know that it
[59:02] is right in the same prophecy he goes
[59:05] right into the end time hold your Bible
[59:07] there and Joel 228 again shall come to
[59:10] pass afterward that I will pour out my
[59:12] spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and
[59:14] your daughters shall prophesy your old
[59:16] men shall dream dreams your young men
[59:18] shall see visions and also upon the
[59:21] servants and upon the handmaids in those
[59:22] days will I pour out my spirit now stop
[59:25] there now in verse 30 and I will show
[59:28] wonders in the heaven and in the earth
[59:30] Blood Fire and fillers of smoke this is
[59:32] one of the reasons that we know that the
[59:34] dispensation of the pouring out of the
[59:36] spirit was not just in the upper room in
[59:38] the early church but it went for 2,000
[59:40] years because here we have the days
[59:42] before the tribulation and final battles
[59:45] and where when the heavens and the Earth
[59:47] blood and fire the prophecy switches now
[59:50] to the beginning of the dispensation of
[59:52] the pouring out to the end of the the
[59:54] dispensation of pouring out so it'll be
[59:57] pouring out All Through the Ages until
[1:00:00] we get to what I call and the Bible
[1:00:02] calls the evening
[1:00:04] time if Peter called that day of
[1:00:07] Pentecost and he re he repeats Joel
[1:00:10] because they said what's going on he
[1:00:12] said this is that which was spoken by
[1:00:14] the prophet zo Joel and he goes in the
[1:00:17] last days I will pour out well my
[1:00:19] goodness what is that what year is that
[1:00:20] 33 ad or whatever is it and Peter's
[1:00:23] saying it's the last days
[1:00:26] said that's not the last days we live in
[1:00:27] the last days but dispensation Peter was
[1:00:30] right because it's the last 2,000 years
[1:00:34] in God's
[1:00:35] time 2,000 years till Noah 2,000 years
[1:00:39] till Jesus Christ and now he takes a
[1:00:42] bride in 2,000 years of of the church
[1:00:44] now right that's 6,000 years thousand
[1:00:48] years of Peace in the Millennium right
[1:00:52] that's seven that's completion that's
[1:00:55] it 2000 2000 and then 2,000 of calling
[1:00:59] the church pouring out his Spirit to the
[1:01:01] church now we get to the end of it all
[1:01:03] which I'll call the evening time and now
[1:01:06] he's we we know that this time of
[1:01:09] pouring out of the spirit will last all
[1:01:11] that all the way up until the sun shall
[1:01:13] be turned into darkness the moon into
[1:01:15] blood before the great and terrible day
[1:01:17] of the Lord and it shall come to pass
[1:01:18] that whosoever shall call upon the name
[1:01:20] of the Lord so I always I've already
[1:01:21] taught or preached on that and brought
[1:01:23] that out but I was trying to show from
[1:01:24] the scripture here tonight that because
[1:01:27] he brings in the the evening time
[1:01:30] conditions of getting ready to go into
[1:01:32] tribulation and the judgments and the
[1:01:34] great and terrible day of the Lord this
[1:01:36] dispensation of pouring out his Spirit
[1:01:39] goes from the day of Pentecost all the
[1:01:41] way until the evening time all the way
[1:01:44] through till the lean
[1:01:46] age amen so now we see then he began to
[1:01:51] pour out his Spirit on the day of
[1:01:53] Pentecost and Peter adds the last days
[1:01:55] so the last days is quite a span of time
[1:01:58] he will take 2,000 years to build a
[1:02:01] masterpiece bride of a masterpiece uh
[1:02:05] that he had at Calvary he'll take a
[1:02:06] piece of it and look at all the time God
[1:02:09] takes to build a master priest bride
[1:02:12] 2,000
[1:02:14] years so now let's apply that to you
[1:02:18] individually how long is it going to
[1:02:20] take for
[1:02:22] you but God is determined the sculptor
[1:02:25] to say I don't care how long it takes
[1:02:29] I'm going to stay working on this
[1:02:31] masterpiece and if he does that as a
[1:02:33] church for 2,000 years then he will do
[1:02:36] that in your
[1:02:37] life that's right how long will it take
[1:02:40] for you well some of you it's taking a
[1:02:42] while because you're a piece of work
[1:02:44] like I said
[1:02:45] Sunday you're a real piece of work but
[1:02:48] we get impatient we want some just
[1:02:50] submit yourself to God I'm missing
[1:02:52] things oh I'm going to miss the Rapture
[1:02:53] no no no no don't don't have that fear
[1:02:55] that nervousness just be filled with the
[1:02:57] spirit just stay submitted to God you
[1:02:59] won't miss a Rapture if you're filled
[1:03:00] with the spirit of God staying in tune
[1:03:03] with the spirit be filled on the soul e
[1:03:05] even in the body in the spirit just stay
[1:03:07] filled with the spirit of God Amen he's
[1:03:10] not going to leave his own spirit in
[1:03:13] people he's not not going to leave them
[1:03:16] here under judgment because they've
[1:03:17] already passed from Death unto life
[1:03:20] they've already passed the
[1:03:21] Judgment he couldn't leave them here
[1:03:23] during Tri ulation cuz they've already
[1:03:27] got his Spirit you think God's going to
[1:03:28] destroy this Earth as Israel it begins
[1:03:31] to mount up and we don't know where
[1:03:32] we're going with this but you think God
[1:03:34] would leave his Spirit on the earth and
[1:03:36] Destroy his spirit in his people with
[1:03:39] the rest of the earth he has to Rapture
[1:03:41] his Spirit
[1:03:43] first so that's how important it is to
[1:03:45] get you make sure Lord I'm staying be
[1:03:48] filled with the spirit your lamps
[1:03:49] trimmed and clear look up your
[1:03:51] Redemption is near because and you have
[1:03:54] to have this fear and I better do this
[1:03:56] and I got to read my Bible an extra hour
[1:03:58] because I want to make the Rapture wait
[1:03:59] a minute wait a minute no the spirit of
[1:04:02] God will lead you stay filled with the
[1:04:03] spirit he'll lift his Spirit off of this
[1:04:05] Earth someday and I'm GNA go with
[1:04:09] him I want to go with him do you want to
[1:04:11] go with him when he lifts his Spirit off

[1:04:15] tribulation you don't want to be here
[1:04:16] for Armageddon you don't want to be here
[1:04:18] for this can you say Amen when he lifts
[1:04:20] his Spirit which he's going to do very
[1:04:22] soon Lord may I lift with it

[1:05:22] Amen blessed be his name so this 2,000
[1:05:24] years he takes a masterpiece and if he
[1:05:27] takes that long process with the church
[1:05:29] he'll take a long process with you be
[1:05:32] patient God is patient with you be
[1:05:34] patient with him surrender to him and he
[1:05:36] will make you a masterpiece unto God
[1:05:39] he's working on you he's still working
[1:05:41] on us can you say Amen but we live in
[1:05:44] the last of the last we live in the
[1:05:46] evening time Peter pointed in the
[1:05:47] scripture as as the word was fulfilled
[1:05:50] for that day Joel
[1:05:52] 2:28 I'm going to present something not
[1:05:54] not tonight but I'm going to be easing
[1:05:56] us into continually using Joel
[1:06:00] 228 for
[1:06:04] today Peter used it for the pouring out
[1:06:07] of the Holy Ghost when it began but
[1:06:09] we're not using just that scripture for
[1:06:12] our time now brother Ram says the word
[1:06:15] that fell on the day of Pentecost will
[1:06:17] not work for
[1:06:21] today and I I I want to break that down
[1:06:24] because it's not it's not that we don't
[1:06:27] understand it but if you're looking at
[1:06:29] what I'm seeing tonight there'll be
[1:06:30] other scriptures today that need to be
[1:06:32] fulfilled so the word he gives for the
[1:06:36] day the evening time in the evening time
[1:06:39] it shall be light what's what else do we
[1:06:42] know that will happen in our day well
[1:06:44] not Elijah Elijah wasn't going to come
[1:06:45] in the upper room he was to come at the
[1:06:47] evening time so that's a scripture we
[1:06:49] can latch on to and say the word that
[1:06:51] fell at day in Pentecost won't work
[1:06:53] today right right he's still pouring out
[1:06:55] his spirit because it's a dispensation
[1:06:57] but we've got scriptures to cling to
[1:06:59] that he's fulfilling today I'll have a
[1:07:01] church without spot without ringer I'll
[1:07:04] have a
[1:07:05] bride Pentecost in the upper room was
[1:07:08] the birth of the church he poured out
[1:07:10] his Spirit we're not in the birth of the
[1:07:12] church Christ isn't going to marry an
[1:07:15] infant Christ isn't going to marry a
[1:07:17] baby but after 2,000 years he's going to
[1:07:20] marry a mature woman who's mature in the
[1:07:22] word of God that's come the word like
[1:07:26] him so much that they're one can you say
[1:07:28] Amen so we're really not we shouldn't
[1:07:30] only preach that we're going back to
[1:07:33] Pentecost we're going back to the faith
[1:07:35] we're going to back to the spirit can
[1:07:37] you say Amen but when we realize the
[1:07:39] word that fell on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:42] won't work today we have another word to
[1:07:44] be fulfilled and I'm living right in the
[1:07:47] middle of it right
[1:07:48] now is that okay with
[1:07:51] everybody the these statements for first
[1:07:54] you go w wow wow and it crosses
[1:07:56] Pentecostal theology because they only
[1:07:59] want to use the scripture I'll pour out
[1:08:00] my spirit in the last days and that's
[1:08:02] what's happening well it is but that's a
[1:08:04] whole dispensation God has other
[1:08:06] scriptures to fulfill during the time we
[1:08:08] live in Malachi 4:5 Luke 17:30 in the in
[1:08:12] the days of the son of man when he's
[1:08:13] revealed acts when it says the
[1:08:16] restitution of all things Joel 2 in the
[1:08:19] early verses says I'll restore all the
[1:08:21] years that the cankerworm the
[1:08:22] caterpillar so scriptures of restoration
[1:08:25] justification baptism of justification
[1:08:27] Sanic baptism of the Holy Ghost so here
[1:08:30] restore that that scriptures that
[1:08:31] related and then we get to the end time
[1:08:32] son of man scriptures we get the bride
[1:08:35] coming to this masterpiece we get to
[1:08:37] Revelations 10
[1:08:39] 1-7 God is fulfilling those words while
[1:08:43] we
[1:08:46] speak and you just need to step into the
[1:08:51] water step into the scripture for your
[1:08:53] day
[1:08:54] this is what he's wanting to fulfill in
[1:08:55] my life the day of church members is
[1:08:58] over the day of God winking at ignorance
[1:09:01] is
[1:09:03] over amen it brings us to the full full
[1:09:07] word amen I'm having a good time tonight
[1:09:10] teaching and preaching both so now we
[1:09:12] see it it's so so now he affects the
[1:09:16] young the old men the young men the
[1:09:18] servants the handmaids and we've already
[1:09:20] covered that that it's not about a
[1:09:22] position the Pharisees had positions you
[1:09:23] had a ladder of senority to reach before
[1:09:26] you could be used of God now he says I
[1:09:28] pour out my spirit upon the young upon
[1:09:30] the old upon all the servants God
[1:09:33] touches someone who has no money or
[1:09:35] learning slaves servants can you say
[1:09:38] amen and I'll remind you of numbers the
[1:09:41] beginning scripture I gave you in
[1:09:42] numbers when Moses said Lord I can't
[1:09:44] handle all the pressures of the people I
[1:09:46] can't I can't bear it myself and God
[1:09:49] says bring your 70 elders brings them to
[1:09:51] the Tabernacle he he splits up his
[1:09:54] Spirit now I want you to notice
[1:09:55] something here this is Old Testament so
[1:09:57] we have that happening like the day of
[1:10:00] Pentecost in the sense that he can split
[1:10:02] up his Spirit but we know that those 70
[1:10:04] elders nor Moses could have his holy
[1:10:07] ghost in their soul
[1:10:09] yet so I want you to notice all that God
[1:10:12] did in the Old Testament By His Holy
[1:10:16] Spirit by his Holy Ghost and they
[1:10:18] couldn't get it yet like on the day of
[1:10:20] Pentecost couldn't get to that level why
[1:10:23] sin was in their soul the serpent nature
[1:10:26] was in their soul the same serpent
[1:10:27] nature you're born with well I was born
[1:10:30] in the message no no no no no you were
[1:10:32] born with the serpent nature and you'll
[1:10:35] battle that your whole life until you
[1:10:36] find God's answer and the answer is his
[1:10:38] holy ghost comes on the soul level and
[1:10:40] changes your desires kills the serpent
[1:10:43] nature and the new soul that soul is
[1:10:45] down there that Soul filled with God now
[1:10:47] can respond properly to the word of God
[1:10:50] but you see now the elders here it is
[1:10:53] and Moses say said would to God that all
[1:10:55] of God's people were prophets would to
[1:10:56] God that they all be filled but they're
[1:10:58] all I want you I want you to really
[1:11:00] notice now God could split his Spirit up
[1:11:03] on their spirit level and they could all
[1:11:05] be distributed the spirit of God among
[1:11:08] 70 how many how many followers did Jesus
[1:11:11] call to go out and heal the sick and to
[1:11:14] pray for the sick and cast out Devils
[1:11:16] anybody remember same number
[1:11:21] 70 70 under Moses and God split his
[1:11:24] spirit and then Jesus said I'll call you
[1:11:26] 70 I'm going to send you out two by two
[1:11:29] and I'm going to put my spirit I I'm GNA
[1:11:32] use you with now this is before
[1:11:36] Pentecost everybody listening you'll
[1:11:39] cast out Devils you'll heal the sick
[1:11:43] you'll do many wonderful things all with
[1:11:46] no holy ghost in the
[1:11:51] soul I just want to show you there has
[1:11:53] has to be a distinction between all the
[1:11:56] Holy Ghost can
[1:11:58] do on a person's
[1:12:01] spirit before they get it in their
[1:12:05] soul they went out casting out Devils
[1:12:08] God gave them as a spirit to do it come
[1:12:10] back and rejoice praise God even the
[1:12:12] devils are so we walk into houses the
[1:12:13] two of us and the devils are already
[1:12:15] scared when we get there they don't have
[1:12:16] the Holy Ghost in their soul but they've
[1:12:18] got a portion of his Spirit that's given
[1:12:20] them power that's right all of these
[1:12:22] things were happen happening before the
[1:12:24] day of
[1:12:25] Pentecost so we cannot make a
[1:12:28] restoration to Pentecost today the
[1:12:32] evidence only of the manifestations of
[1:12:34] casting out
[1:12:35] Devils because they already had that
[1:12:38] before the day of Pentecost now did they
[1:12:41] cast out Devils after yes they did and
[1:12:44] it was it powerful yes it was do we
[1:12:47] still cast out Devils today the church
[1:12:50] still does that commission is never
[1:12:52] you'll cast if if you drink any deadly
[1:12:54] thing you'll tread on serpents there's
[1:12:56] power in the church can you say Amen
[1:12:58] it's there it's even probably more
[1:13:00] powerful when you get it in your soul my
[1:13:02] it's probably even more powerful because
[1:13:04] you know your position you can be
[1:13:06] positioned I'm a Son of God now I'm
[1:13:09] connected to God can you say Amen I'm
[1:13:11] not afraid of any
[1:13:12] Devils but all of those things happened
[1:13:15] before the day of Pentecost so
[1:13:18] Pentecostal power of the Holy Ghost has
[1:13:20] to be more than just casting out devil
[1:13:23] and
[1:13:24] healings please respect me those who are
[1:13:26] listening those here tonight I'm not
[1:13:28] belittling healing at all because the
[1:13:30] Holy Ghost does it every service here
[1:13:32] the Holy Ghost cast out Devils said well
[1:13:34] we didn't bring anybody Altar and cast
[1:13:36] out Devils I was casting them out while
[1:13:38] I was preaching this past
[1:13:40] Sunday any true Minister that's bringing
[1:13:42] this word and you bring spirits on you
[1:13:45] if you'll yield I'm casting out Devils
[1:13:47] every service not by Paula Fontaine but
[1:13:50] by the word coming forth how many raise
[1:13:52] your hand and say say I had a bad Spirit
[1:13:54] on
[1:13:56] me tonight no don't say
[1:13:59] tonight but when I left God delivered me
[1:14:02] of that while the preaching of the word
[1:14:04] how many you said I was healed while the
[1:14:06] preaching was going forth he sent his
[1:14:08] word how many say so for me I received
[1:14:11] the Holy Ghost myself while the word was
[1:14:13] being preached I didn't need to come to
[1:14:14] an altar Lord come to an altar great
[1:14:18] respond to God all that's in place I
[1:14:19] just want to say all of these works and
[1:14:21] manifestations happened before for and I
[1:14:24] like to bring up the point not to
[1:14:25] belittle what God does he does it God
[1:14:28] can do it but there are great Miracles
[1:14:30] that happen outside of our ranks and God
[1:14:33] does
[1:14:35] them raising the dead
[1:14:38] healings and I say God did that and they
[1:14:41] weren't in the message they weren't
[1:14:42] around so you can't make that the final
[1:14:45] Revival of the bride only
[1:14:49] healings is it okay with everybody it
[1:14:52] has to be something more and we'll get
[1:14:53] into where the Holy Ghost is taking us
[1:14:57] in the evening time what it finishes
[1:15:00] with and what the bride's Revival really
[1:15:01] is it won't just be another healing it
[1:15:04] will be including healing it'll be
[1:15:06] including the truth of justification
[1:15:08] including the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:11] including the restoration of the gifts I
[1:15:13] believe in every gift in the church I
[1:15:16] just won't manipulate to try to make
[1:15:17] them
[1:15:18] happen I will not do
[1:15:21] that I'm going to preach 10 service on
[1:15:23] until we see the gifts of the Spirit I
[1:15:24] know to preach the word when people get
[1:15:26] yielded the gifts will work in their
[1:15:28] lives but I'm not going to say we're not
[1:15:30] having any nothing going on here because
[1:15:32] we haven't seen the gift in tongues in a
[1:15:33] long time we need to see that I'm not
[1:15:35] going to manipulate
[1:15:37] that because today it's deeper than the
[1:15:39] gifts it's the giver it's the giver can
[1:15:42] I can you say Amen it's the giver it's
[1:15:44] Christ who gave the gifts we want him
[1:15:47] more than anything we want the
[1:15:48] Masterpiece to be built in our lives we
[1:15:51] want to come to that mature divine love
[1:15:54] sons of God come into the manifestation
[1:15:56] of maturity and
[1:15:59] adoption all the power you see it's it's
[1:16:02] power and character the bride's final
[1:16:05] Revival I might as well spill it out I
[1:16:07] believe is that maturity coming in a
[1:16:09] bride she's not a young infant she's not
[1:16:11] playing with the gifts but she's come to
[1:16:14] maturity she's got the gifts she's got
[1:16:16] all the things she's she's filled with
[1:16:18] the spirit of God can you say amen and
[1:16:21] the final thing to me will be power in
[1:16:24] this bride and character in this bride
[1:16:28] not power without character not power
[1:16:31] with
[1:16:32] immaturities but she'll be a mature
[1:16:34] bride in the word know how to handle the
[1:16:37] word know how to handle the gifts and if
[1:16:39] those gifts are messing up we don't mess
[1:16:41] with them somebody prophesies something
[1:16:43] and it doesn't come to pass they need to
[1:16:45] repent of
[1:16:47] that we want the real thing or we don't
[1:16:49] want it all we don't want to just play
[1:16:51] with these things and the mature bride
[1:16:53] of Christ says I want the power that
[1:16:56] comes with this in my life every day but
[1:16:59] I want the character to be molded in me
[1:17:02] to manifest these things
[1:17:05] right so you can't go back and just pull
[1:17:08] Jo Joel 228 and say in the in the
[1:17:11] evening time it'll be a pouring out of
[1:17:13] his Spirit again the same and repeating
[1:17:16] just the same things in the day of
[1:17:17] Pentecost it'll be that but it'll be
[1:17:19] even more it's taking us somewhere in
[1:17:23] this final
[1:17:24] Capstone I want to talk about where the
[1:17:26] Holy Ghost would go but I'm I'm have to
[1:17:28] talk only a certain amount of time
[1:17:31] because the kids got to go to
[1:17:33] school we understand that do you
[1:17:35] understand what we're presenting
[1:17:40] tonight so now when the church was
[1:17:44] birthed by the pouring out of the spirit
[1:17:47] something happened and the Antichrist
[1:17:49] came in I I believe brother rap was
[1:17:50] dealing with that in his class on in a
[1:17:53] couple classes on Sunday morning the
[1:17:54] Antichrist came in right away within
[1:17:56] just a few years the Antichrist Spirits
[1:17:58] begin to work in the
[1:17:59] church and where the rap's talking about
[1:18:01] I wish I could get to his class he sent
[1:18:04] me his notes and it sounds very
[1:18:07] interesting something happened early on
[1:18:09] when the spirit was poured out the
[1:18:10] Antichrist came in and began to push the
[1:18:12] spirit
[1:18:14] out push the word
[1:18:16] out nickan ISM came in and put the put
[1:18:20] all the Holiness in the pulpit and took
[1:18:22] it away from the
[1:18:24] people the Antichrist Spirit limited
[1:18:26] this pouring out of the spirit we never
[1:18:29] want to limit the pouring out of the
[1:18:31] spirit of God we never want to quench
[1:18:34] the spirit of
[1:18:35] God that's what that Antichrist Spirit
[1:18:38] did it preached against it it said we
[1:18:40] don't want that and we and they changed
[1:18:42] it all and quenched the spirit and
[1:18:44] pushed out this moving and pouring out
[1:18:47] of his Spirit God would have continued
[1:18:48] it but and this is evident in Jesus
[1:18:51] words to the denom inational leaders the
[1:18:54] Pharisees if you're listening and you
[1:18:55] don't understand that there were
[1:18:57] denominational leaders in Jesus Day
[1:18:59] called the Pharisees and Sadducees they
[1:19:01] were denominations and they were leaders
[1:19:03] of them and Jesus said to them it's by
[1:19:06] your traditions and by your Creeds that
[1:19:09] you're making the word of none
[1:19:12] effect you're quenching you're ruining
[1:19:15] what God's trying to do by your dogmas
[1:19:18] and your Creeds and your
[1:19:21] Traditions so the word kept be effective
[1:19:24] the spirit pouring out can't do its work
[1:19:26] because you bound the People by your
[1:19:28] Creeds and dogmas and
[1:19:30] traditions the Holy Spirit ought to have
[1:19:32] access to every one of your
[1:19:34] congregations to come in and do whatever
[1:19:36] he wants to do but you have limited you
[1:19:39] have squelched it you've some of you
[1:19:41] churches have preached that the days of
[1:19:43] Miracles are even passed it only
[1:19:45] happened with the apostles you brother
[1:19:47] sister I love you but you do not have a
[1:19:50] right to say that the days of Miracles
[1:19:52] are passed cuz they're still happening
[1:19:54] right here in this church today you
[1:19:56] don't have a church that believes that
[1:19:57] in this city you come you come and we'll
[1:20:00] give testimony after testimony that the
[1:20:02] days of Miracles are still happening
[1:20:05] today
[1:20:06] yes so you don't have a right like the
[1:20:08] Antichrist Spirit to squelch all that
[1:20:10] and squelch people saying amen and
[1:20:13] squelch people the spirit of God moving
[1:20:15] he's always wanting to be given the
[1:20:17] freedom to pour out upon the people and
[1:20:20] your Creeds and dogmas has made the the
[1:20:22] the no effect to the people so this is
[1:20:25] so so now we see now this happened if
[1:20:28] you want to pull up the first quote
[1:20:29] here's how what here's what happened in
[1:20:32] this 2,000 years segment of the pouring
[1:20:34] out of his Spirit here's what happened
[1:20:36] he said the Holy Spirit has been bound
[1:20:39] by these denominational Rivers for
[1:20:41] almost 2,000 years so this is what
[1:20:44] happened by these denominational Rivers
[1:20:47] for 2,000 years in this dispensation of
[1:20:50] the pouring out of the spirit of God
[1:20:52] something something happened and that is
[1:20:54] denominational Rivers for almost 2,000
[1:20:57] years bound the Holy Spirit from moving
[1:21:00] his promise said I'll pour out my spirit
[1:21:03] every Church age but it didn't have the
[1:21:06] fullness to pour out because they
[1:21:08] restricted it God couldn't pour out he
[1:21:11] didn't have the freedom to bring the
[1:21:13] word and have ministers that bring it
[1:21:14] bring the freedom of the word but look
[1:21:16] at this found for 2,000 years by by
[1:21:19] denomination but it is to be loosed in
[1:21:22] the evening time now we have not the
[1:21:24] last days but the evening time the last
[1:21:27] of the last days the Holy Ghost is to be
[1:21:30] loose in the evening time by the evening
[1:21:32] time message there's what the message
[1:21:37] is I said there's what the message is
[1:21:40] it's not a code to live by it's not a
[1:21:44] dress
[1:21:45] code this is what it really is you have
[1:21:48] this Holy Spirit loose to people's lives
[1:21:51] you don't have to worry about the dress
[1:21:52] Cod code can I get an amen the message
[1:21:56] has become a code the message has become
[1:21:59] a denomination it's become all these
[1:22:00] other things but the message itself came
[1:22:03] to loose the Holy Ghost to the people
[1:22:06] the Holy Spirit back in the church again
[1:22:09] Christ himself revealed in human flesh
[1:22:13] in the evening time somebody say praise
[1:22:16] the
[1:22:18] Lord so this is what happened and what
[1:22:21] is to happen at the end time Christ
[1:22:24] himself revealed in human flesh in the
[1:22:28] evening time not just an anointing not
[1:22:31] just a baptism on your flesh not just a
[1:22:34] pouring out again of his spirit and full
[1:22:36] restoration of the gifts and things not
[1:22:38] just that but now to bring it to Christ
[1:22:42] in human flesh again like it was in
[1:22:46] Jesus 2,000 years ago God in flesh a
[1:22:49] further purpose than just the birth of
[1:22:51] the church but the the maturity and the
[1:22:54] marriage of Christ and his bride he
[1:22:57] won't marry a child he will marry a
[1:22:59] mature woman that is matured in the word
[1:23:02] it's more than a pouring out but it's a
[1:23:05] final Masterpiece of the second Eve
[1:23:08] Christ in the evening time here we have
[1:23:11] the distinction that I've been preaching
[1:23:12] about I'm getting ready to close here we
[1:23:14] have the distinction the last days and
[1:23:16] the evening time it shall be be light
[1:23:19] about the evening time here's a
[1:23:20] distinction notice how he explains the
[1:23:23] progress the progression excuse me of
[1:23:25] the end time evening time what will
[1:23:28] happen is not just the pouring out but
[1:23:30] to bring it to a Perfection that's never
[1:23:33] happened in all the seven Church ages
[1:23:36] even with the Holy Ghost being poured
[1:23:38] out it never brought it to a Perfect
[1:23:41] Bride into a
[1:23:43] Perfection a lot of us because the
[1:23:45] denominational Creeds comeing but it
[1:23:46] wasn't meant to come to its fullness and
[1:23:48] prot and and and the final thing till
[1:23:50] the end time he sends a prophet to begin
[1:23:54] that
[1:23:55] restoration and so now the end time the
[1:23:58] the evening time just give me about five
[1:24:00] more minutes and I'm
[1:24:02] done the evening time the last days in
[1:24:05] the evening time must be separated
[1:24:07] because at the evening time he begins
[1:24:10] and if you'll get your Bible this week
[1:24:12] and read Joel 2 not 28 Joel 2 Joel 2 and
[1:24:17] read the from 18
[1:24:19] on verse 25 in particular I will restore
[1:24:23] to you the years that the Locust had
[1:24:25] eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the
[1:24:27] P palmerworm my great Army which I sent
[1:24:29] among you that's the brid tree that
[1:24:32] Satan ate away at for 2,000 years and
[1:24:34] God says here's a prophecy for those
[1:24:36] 2,000 years whatever he ate whatever
[1:24:39] Satan ate off the bride tree this
[1:24:41] masterpiece because she has to be
[1:24:43] smitten
[1:24:44] too this bride had this masterpiece had
[1:24:47] to be smitten too she started out good
[1:24:49] at Pentecost then nickel ananis come in
[1:24:51] the church system come in and because
[1:24:53] this bride had to be smitten but she's
[1:24:55] been smitten and then God says I will
[1:25:01] restore so now we're talking the evening
[1:25:04] time a restoration of the word a
[1:25:06] restoration of Faith a restoration of
[1:25:09] the gifts and a restoration but but when
[1:25:11] all that restoration has come to his
[1:25:13] completion he's just not wanting to
[1:25:15] restore us he's taking us back to the
[1:25:17] second Eve coming to be married to
[1:25:20] Christ so it's not just a pouring out of
[1:25:23] his spirit it's more than
[1:25:25] that he sums it up by saying this the
[1:25:29] second quote if you would in
[1:25:31] Masterpiece notice
[1:25:33] here oh boy I got a bunch here more here
[1:25:36] and I I can't finish it tonight notice
[1:25:38] here the life that was in the husk stand
[1:25:41] up so I that's my signal to
[1:25:45] close but don't don't lose this quote
[1:25:48] now notice here the life that was in the
[1:25:51] husk in the stock and in the tassel he's
[1:25:54] taken the stages of the wheat and he's
[1:25:56] taken the stages being this restoration
[1:25:58] of of Luther's day of Wesley's
[1:26:01] day life was in Luther's Day Life came
[1:26:05] through Wesley's day but then they all
[1:26:06] denominated life came in isusa street
[1:26:09] but then they denominated the spirit
[1:26:11] left it right the spirit left it every
[1:26:14] time you
[1:26:15] denominate you you restrict the Holy
[1:26:18] Spirit right so he said the life that
[1:26:21] was in the star went one went to the
[1:26:23] other this is how he words it
[1:26:26] justification made a way for
[1:26:28] sanctification sanctification made away
[1:26:31] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:26:33] the Zeus Street that's Ben cost
[1:26:35] restoration of the gifts it's not
[1:26:38] over it's not done
[1:26:40] there the baptism of the Holy Ghost made
[1:26:45] a way for the Holy Ghost
[1:26:47] itself to come right down in Perfection
[1:26:51] back back to the word again to manifest
[1:26:55] itself you see why I say it's not just a
[1:26:58] pouring out of his Spirit there's an end
[1:27:00] result to the pouring out of his Spirit
[1:27:02] we pray say God pour your spirit out but
[1:27:05] what's that going to do to us it's not
[1:27:06] just to give us a feeling or sensation
[1:27:08] or bring us into another
[1:27:10] denomination this time when he pours it
[1:27:13] out he's going to take it from just a
[1:27:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost to the Holy
[1:27:17] Spirit himself coming down into
[1:27:18] Perfection into the church's
[1:27:21] lives
[1:27:22] amen I got so
[1:27:25] excited about this
[1:27:28] today and I believe that you should be
[1:27:31] can you say amen and I'll just close
[1:27:32] this by saying when he is pouring out
[1:27:35] his spirit and bringing the right
[1:27:38] atmosphere no matter where it
[1:27:40] is see
[1:27:42] because I know every believer knows when
[1:27:46] God's
[1:27:47] present and I said when he's present
[1:27:49] there's
[1:27:51] noise I believe
[1:27:54] that but I have never been afraid of the
[1:27:56] presence of God I can join in wherever
[1:27:59] I'm at and if it's the presence of the
[1:28:01] Lord people get to worshiping and you
[1:28:04] know might some people might get in the
[1:28:06] flesh listen I'm going to jump in and
[1:28:08] Worship the
[1:28:10] Lord because I know in maturity what he
[1:28:13] really wants to do I know I mean I I
[1:28:16] told you a few months ago I was there at
[1:28:18] that youth camp and dancing myself I
[1:28:20] haven't danced in a long time but I
[1:28:22] don't have to dance every service to
[1:28:23] prove that I got the Holy Ghost but that
[1:28:26] Spirit came in that poured out on those
[1:28:27] young people and I was dancing before
[1:28:29] the Lord and I haven't done that in a
[1:28:32] long time but I don't use that as an
[1:28:33] Evidence but I sure enjoyed
[1:28:35] it and I was rejoicing I can jump in and
[1:28:39] I can enjoy the presence of the Lord
[1:28:41] wherever it is because I know in that
[1:28:43] atmosphere a lot of things can take
[1:28:45] place when you come this Sunday or any
[1:28:47] service even tonight even though you're
[1:28:49] tired but because I always tell people
[1:28:51] you're tired tired and I respect that
[1:28:53] but I'm tired too I'm still a little
[1:28:54] sick actually but we can't use tired as
[1:28:57] an excuse to stay
[1:28:59] home but when you come you ought to get
[1:29:01] over that a little bit and say we really
[1:29:03] want the spirit of the Lord to come
[1:29:04] tonight because in that spirit and I'm
[1:29:06] and when it happens I'm going to jump
[1:29:07] into it because it'll not only wake you
[1:29:13] up it'll not only wake you up a little
[1:29:15] bit but you say what could God do when
[1:29:18] he pours out his Spirit you should never
[1:29:20] stop Desiring God God this is a
[1:29:22] Wednesday night there's only 20 of us
[1:29:24] here but pour out your
[1:29:27] spirit I need it Lord I need it I thank
[1:29:31] you for all I've I got but I need more
[1:29:34] can you say Amen pour out your spirit
[1:29:37] upon all of us there'll be many
[1:29:40] manifestations and and I can worship but
[1:29:44] I can never use any of those
[1:29:45] manifestations as an Evidence you want
[1:29:47] to look to your action in the word of
[1:29:49] God there'll be a lot of noise but then
[1:29:51] if if you feel free in the
[1:29:54] anointing and uh I was born to live in
[1:29:58] that anointing I'm born to live in that
[1:30:00] presence I love it but the new birth
[1:30:02] going on in the inside is something
[1:30:05] deeper can you say
[1:30:07] amen I don't want to leave without the
[1:30:09] spirit of God moving in every service
[1:30:11] every day of my life but pray that when
[1:30:14] that Spirit pours out again that he
[1:30:17] calls his elect to a real baptism in the
[1:30:24] Soul the greatest thing he can do is
[1:30:26] secretly change the desires of the
[1:30:28] inside of you to have life come into you
[1:30:31] power of life that
[1:30:34] overcomes in that pouring out the spirit
[1:30:36] the greatest thing you can pray is that
[1:30:37] Lord give me the life of that because
[1:30:39] the life will overcome on
[1:30:42] Monday it's not just a feeling Sunday
[1:30:45] it's not a c meeting it's not a healing
[1:30:47] line it'll overcome the devil on Monday
[1:30:49] that's the power that you want and so if
[1:30:52] he comes and moves can he step into the
[1:30:56] water wait out a little bit
[1:30:59] deeper wet your feet in the water of his
[1:31:05] love oh step into the water oh wait out
