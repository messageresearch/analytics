[0:00] to the book of psalms
[0:02] 143
[0:04] let's see here psalm 143
[0:08] will be our first scripture
[0:11] and
[0:12] then we'll go to proverbs then we'll go
[0:13] to the book of jonah
[0:17] psalm 143 and verse 8
[0:20] cause me to hear thy loving kindness in
[0:22] the morning
[0:23] for in thee do i trust
[0:25] cause me to know the way where and i
[0:27] should walk
[0:28] for i lift up my soul unto thee
[0:31] deliver me o lord from mine enemies i
[0:34] flee unto thee to hide me
[0:38] teach me to do thy will
[0:40] for thou art my god thy spirit is good
[0:43] lead me into the land of uprightness
[0:46] quicken me o lord for thy name's sake
[0:49] for thy righteousness sake
[0:52] bring my soul out of trouble
[0:54] and of thy mercy cut off my enemies and
[0:57] destroy all them that afflict my soul
[0:59] for i am thy servant
[1:02] a few pages over into proverbs
[1:07] 14
[1:09] proverbs 14 and verse 12.
[1:14] let's see here
[1:15] there's a way which seemeth right into a
[1:17] man
[1:18] but the end there are the ways of death
[1:21] we think it's the right way
[1:23] but it might just not be the right way
[1:26] and then
[1:27] over in the book of jonah it's right
[1:29] after obadiah
[1:30] almost to the end of the old testament
[1:34] in prophet jonah chapter 1
[1:36] now the word of the lord came unto jonah
[1:38] the son of amitai saying
[1:40] arise go to nineveh that great city and
[1:42] cry against it for their wickedness is
[1:45] come up before me
[1:47] let us pray verse your heavenly father
[1:49] we thank you for your word
[1:51] we thank you lord for the occasion that
[1:52] we can be together in this lovely place
[1:54] with lovely people we pray that you
[1:56] would bless them with your word we can
[1:58] only speak it
[2:00] but it must be you that puts it in their
[2:01] heart
[2:02] bless each one lord help us in jesus
[2:04] name amen you may be seated
[2:13] so like i say it's a good new good to be
[2:16] here and
[2:18] i came just before the weather changed
[2:21] because i happen to know it can get cold
[2:23] up here
[2:24] so
[2:25] uh
[2:26] we uh probably be back someday soon but
[2:30] it's just good to be with brother paul
[2:31] and
[2:32] the saints here
[2:34] now
[2:35] our title tonight is my will or god's
[2:37] will
[2:38] be something you can put on your mirror
[2:39] you can put on your
[2:41] refrigerator whatever
[2:42] my will or god's will
[2:45] now
[2:46] we're going to preach tonight
[2:48] from don't pay attention brother
[2:51] branham's absolute
[2:53] okay that's what he calls his absolutes
[2:55] it'll do for me too
[2:57] okay got that settled
[2:59] now
[3:00] jonah was an israelite okay he was a jew
[3:03] and he lived in a little town of geth
[3:05] hepper which is a little town up north
[3:07] of nazareth up in galilee
[3:09] and he was the first foreign missionary
[3:13] now i'm sure that brother paul's
[3:15] listening close and he'll probably give
[3:16] you a test on this in a few days so you
[3:18] better pay attention
[3:20] that's all i can say
[3:22] and so he was the first foreign
[3:23] missionary or an apostle like the new
[3:25] testament says one that is sent out
[3:28] and that is the highest calling
[3:30] okay everybody thinks well yeah it's
[3:32] just
[3:34] prophet's highest calling no it says
[3:35] first apostles prophets you know right
[3:38] down the line
[3:39] now our prophet says in the end time
[3:42] message
[3:43] 1954 i believe every christian is
[3:45] obligated that's all of you
[3:47] a little guy
[3:48] every christian is obligated not so much
[3:50] that you have to go over to the old
[3:52] country and preach but if you can't go
[3:54] you can help send somebody else to go
[3:57] okay
[3:58] everybody should hear the gospel at
[3:59] least once
[4:00] i want to do my part there's something
[4:02] about missionary work i just love it and
[4:04] just to know that what you're doing
[4:06] you're doing god's will when you're
[4:08] giving to missions
[4:11] see all these lights have to be
[4:12] purchased they don't give these away all
[4:14] these seats had to be purchased
[4:16] when you take something to post office
[4:17] you know it's always money so when
[4:19] you're giving to missions you're in
[4:20] god's will
[4:22] now
[4:23] missionary work is not only traveling to
[4:25] some
[4:26] hot sticky place where they don't speak
[4:28] your language okay
[4:30] or eat food that's not like you got back
[4:32] home
[4:33] but it's living for others right here in
[4:36] michigan and ohio
[4:39] eternal life is living for others
[4:41] sacrifice
[4:43] okay
[4:44] everybody wants eternal life
[4:46] everybody wants to go to heaven if you
[4:48] stood out here in the road and stopped
[4:49] everybody you want to go ahead and i'm
[4:50] sure everybody wants to go to heaven
[4:51] they just don't want to go today
[4:55] so that's right um i'm very proud to be
[4:59] associated with brother paul brother
[5:00] barry
[5:01] in this missionary effort i know we have
[5:03] a same attitude about getting the word
[5:05] to the people
[5:06] um proverbs 29 18 says without a vision
[5:09] that people perish
[5:11] if you look around churches that don't
[5:13] have no missionary vision they're just
[5:15] kind of flat you know
[5:17] so
[5:18] um
[5:19] our vision isn't to
[5:22] make everybody come into this church
[5:24] well there's enough people on this
[5:25] street philip church but there would be
[5:27] a bunch of bunch of you know non-eagles
[5:29] we're just looking for those last eagles
[5:31] out there don't know yet that they're
[5:32] eagles you see
[5:34] and so then we can go
[5:36] but brother ram says on that day on
[5:38] calvary he was just one man the perfect
[5:41] man
[5:42] he gave his life he made an example for
[5:44] you now what must we do now the first
[5:46] thing i want to say jesus never lived
[5:48] for himself
[5:50] his life was spent for others
[5:52] that's perfectly eternal life when you
[5:55] say you go to church and do good that's
[5:56] fine but when you live just your life
[5:58] for yourself you don't have eternal life
[6:02] eternal life is living for others it
[6:04] proved it when he came in the lamb of
[6:05] god he lived and had eternal life
[6:07] because he did not live for himself he
[6:09] lived for others and you receive eternal
[6:11] life by receiving that day on calvary
[6:14] and you don't live for yourself no more
[6:16] you live for others
[6:17] so
[6:18] we want to just give you a just a brief
[6:20] um
[6:21] look through the window to the
[6:23] missionary work that we're involved with
[6:24] because some people think i just live
[6:26] down there in tennessee and
[6:28] don't do nothing well that's not exactly
[6:30] true
[6:31] uh
[6:32] and then we'll get on with brother jonah
[6:34] here
[6:34] but um
[6:36] you know in acts chapter 11
[6:38] there was some needs in the church up in
[6:40] jerusalem
[6:41] so the church in antioch which is far
[6:43] away that's where paul and barnabas were
[6:45] they gathered some some money says right
[6:48] in your bible we have a real good study
[6:50] in the book of acts but i don't live
[6:52] here so we can't get into it but
[6:54] they took money to the saints in
[6:56] jerusalem
[6:57] they helped them it's not always putting
[6:59] a book in somebody's sense sometimes
[7:00] just buying them food sometimes just
[7:02] getting them off the street and you know
[7:04] rent a house
[7:05] and
[7:06] so we're very involved in a lot of
[7:08] different things for example venezuela i
[7:10] don't know if you've read much about it
[7:12] but venezuela used to be a very growing
[7:15] economy
[7:16] we lived there several years ago many
[7:18] years ago
[7:19] and um
[7:20] uh they had everything you could imagine
[7:22] they had they had you know jaguar
[7:24] dealerships right there in town
[7:26] but all that's gone downhill because in
[7:27] 1999 they've reelected a socialist
[7:30] president
[7:31] knowing he was socialist
[7:34] we'll go in the same direction because
[7:35] you have noticed
[7:36] but they elected this man and for all
[7:39] these years now it's been going steadily
[7:41] down down down
[7:43] they have
[7:44] they say they have more oil underground
[7:46] than they do have in saudi arabia
[7:49] well but it takes technology to get it
[7:51] out and get it pumped out but they've
[7:53] let the whole system kind of deteriorate
[7:56] the americans want to drill the wells
[7:57] and got it going but anyway uh their oil
[8:01] system is not working like it should
[8:04] so everything is it's poverty they want
[8:06] to they want to duplicate what they have
[8:08] in in cuba they got nothing in cube i've
[8:10] been there it's just zero nothing to
[8:13] duplicate
[8:14] they claim about their their medical
[8:16] really
[8:17] no it's a joke
[8:19] uh and in venezuela they have over four
[8:21] thousand percent inflation
[8:23] you can't exist like that
[8:25] so we are helping some of the saints we
[8:27] can't help everybody but you see over
[8:30] over five million believers are not
[8:32] believers but all of the population over
[8:35] five million people have left the
[8:36] country
[8:37] they're they're over here in tennessee
[8:39] they're in uh kentucky they're in
[8:43] brazil everywhere they've
[8:44] went to spain
[8:46] and so those people over there they want
[8:49] to send money back to their relatives
[8:52] well we've got a problem because since
[8:53] we the americans are the enemy then they
[8:56] don't have no western union you don't
[8:57] have no simple way of doing that sending
[8:59] money home
[9:01] so some of these people
[9:02] amongst the believers
[9:04] uh were good friends
[9:06] so they sent me money into paypal or
[9:09] western union then i put it into an
[9:11] account
[9:12] that can be transferred to a friend of
[9:14] theirs in venezuela and when he sees you
[9:16] know a hundred dollars then he pays out
[9:18] a hundred dollars to whatever person we
[9:20] tell them
[9:21] it looks like money laundering and it's
[9:22] about about what it is but it's the only
[9:24] way to get money to them
[9:26] you know because in a church this size
[9:29] uh
[9:30] there's a brother down there it's got a
[9:32] church of uh probably 200 people
[9:34] and so the people work the ones that
[9:37] have jobs but they pay them in the local
[9:39] currency which is worthless
[9:41] so you take up an offering
[9:44] and then you convert it to dollars
[9:45] because everything in town is in dollars
[9:48] you might have twenty dollars well they
[9:50] can't go very far like that right um so
[9:52] anyway we're helping them we every week
[9:54] we send money we send boxes of clothes
[9:56] we send you know beans we send coffee
[9:58] just
[9:59] medicine no medicine your child's sick
[10:02] so you take them to the doctor and the
[10:04] doctor says well he's got this and this
[10:05] and you need this and this and this
[10:07] where are you gonna get it right they
[10:08] don't have it right so we end up sending
[10:10] them etc and all kinds of things
[10:13] so anyway that's one of our
[10:15] constant projects
[10:16] um we also are helping some people over
[10:19] in malawi to build a church that's not
[10:22] our regular type of thing
[10:24] but uh since we have plenty of time and
[10:25] nobody's fallen asleep just yet
[10:28] but we have a solution for that sleep
[10:29] thing that's coming up in a minute
[10:33] um i was over in malawi uh two years ago
[10:36] in 19 yeah and so visited many churches
[10:40] and lovely people poor oh what are you
[10:42] talking about this church
[10:44] probably it wasn't quite this wide but
[10:47] it was longer and they didn't have nice
[10:49] seats had planks they sit on planks no
[10:51] no back so you can't go sleep
[10:54] there's probably 600 people there but
[10:56] they only had two light bulbs one's over
[10:58] the pulpit and one's way back there
[11:01] it's okay they a lot of them don't read
[11:03] anyway so they just you know come to
[11:05] church and so um i remember i was
[11:08] talking to a translator some of them
[11:10] understand english but anyway talking
[11:12] through this translator and the um
[11:15] you know you speak and then he speaks
[11:16] and i speak and he speaks so i said
[11:19] something and while he's speaking
[11:21] guess what this light bulb is attracting
[11:23] bugs
[11:24] says bug comes in here
[11:26] i have to have my mouth closed right
[11:27] then because he was talking
[11:29] so he got cut in the mustache got him
[11:31] out you know
[11:32] but
[11:33] i noticed in one of the churches they
[11:35] didn't have bibles there's only two or
[11:36] three bibles what's the matter here well
[11:38] they can't afford them and i said i
[11:40] promise you will be a bible in every
[11:42] home
[11:43] in your language we went to town they
[11:45] sold bibles right there now they got a
[11:46] bible how do you preach this message to
[11:49] people that don't have the bible
[11:51] what's your you know point of reference
[11:53] so anyway we're helping them and um
[11:56] and so this one churchway room there's
[11:58] probably 150 people or so
[12:01] and so
[12:02] they don't have the luxury of a nursery
[12:04] the nursery is right out here
[12:06] 10 by 10
[12:07] piece of plastic
[12:09] and either the mother's carrying the
[12:10] baby or like those two little kids back
[12:12] there they'd be sitting over here
[12:14] and of course people were watching them
[12:16] and the deacon's got a big stick
[12:18] and so
[12:19] they they're sitting in church right
[12:20] there where you see them
[12:22] well anyway um
[12:24] they wrote to me later and they said you
[12:26] know this the church you're in uh the
[12:28] brother that donated the property he
[12:30] wants it back
[12:32] it's like that
[12:33] one week to the next and he said now if
[12:35] you don't like that there's the door
[12:37] well
[12:38] he was putting in some strange doctrines
[12:40] too so anyway
[12:42] they said now we've saved up some money
[12:44] and we've seen this piece of property
[12:45] over here we need a little bit more so
[12:47] we can buy that piece of property and
[12:48] build his church you know church name
[12:50] and so forth
[12:51] and um so by the time i got the other
[12:53] 1200 or so together
[12:56] the catholic church bought the property
[12:58] i said don't worry god's got something
[12:59] better for you
[13:00] so
[13:01] they started looking and just out of
[13:03] town a little ways there's a piece of
[13:04] property a couple acres
[13:07] and
[13:08] nothing was on it and they they liked
[13:10] the location and i said fine there let's
[13:12] let's buy that
[13:13] so the money they had with a little bit
[13:15] i sent they bought that property well
[13:17] then we start building now they did all
[13:19] the work by hand all the trenches and
[13:22] everything no machinery
[13:24] and so they're they're building away
[13:26] and they uh they were encouraged and we
[13:28] were helping them and they said you know
[13:30] we've been talking and said we uh we
[13:32] think we'll call this church the george
[13:34] smith tabernacle
[13:36] i said i don't think so
[13:39] we'll call it the walking and the light
[13:40] tabernacle ah yeah we like that so they
[13:43] registered the name well they're almost
[13:45] finished so we're helping them with that
[13:47] and it's going to be a lovely place um
[13:49] and so out there where they're building
[13:51] there's no other churches around there
[13:53] so the neighbors you know they live out
[13:55] in the woods there
[13:56] they uh they come over what do you guys
[13:58] build in here well they start testifying
[13:59] to him he says we baptize somebody every
[14:02] day
[14:03] so this church will be full by the time
[14:04] they get it finished
[14:06] but anyway that's that's over in
[14:09] in malawi and of course we've been
[14:12] involved with the church age book to get
[14:13] it in english and spanish and published
[14:16] around the world so that's going on and
[14:18] it's been a real real blessing so things
[14:21] are happening
[14:22] and uh right now i'm working on the seal
[14:24] book
[14:24] it'll be new you'll love the
[14:26] the new book
[14:28] so
[14:29] let's get on with our buddy here
[14:35] sorry
[14:37] our brother jonah okay
[14:39] now jonah had a direct commission from
[14:41] god go preach to the enemy their
[14:44] wickedness has come up before me i can't
[14:46] stand it anymore go preach repentance
[14:49] there's only one problem
[14:51] jonah was jewish
[14:54] and um people in nineveh were gentiles
[14:58] very serious segregation
[15:00] and when you read your bible see this
[15:02] bible's written a long time ago and it's
[15:04] right but all through the bible these
[15:06] people lived here and these people lived
[15:08] over here
[15:09] they had segregation okay but of course
[15:11] in our great american way we thought the
[15:13] integration be better but it hasn't
[15:15] worked out too good
[15:16] okay
[15:19] so
[15:20] segregation
[15:22] and nineveh at that time was the capital
[15:24] of assyria you can study this on your
[15:26] maps in south you find out that's
[15:28] currently northern iraq
[15:31] very wicked very sinful people very
[15:33] cruel
[15:34] violent city of over 120 000 people it
[15:37] was a large city at the time took three
[15:39] days to walk around it
[15:40] and the assyrians were constantly
[15:42] tormenting the and oppressing the
[15:45] israelites
[15:47] see it didn't start in 1948 3000 years
[15:50] ago they've been after him since
[15:52] so god was sending his prophet
[15:55] right into the jaws of danger
[15:58] to face the enemy
[16:00] go cry against it it was time for
[16:02] repentance
[16:04] and um
[16:05] god always sends a warning before
[16:07] judgment
[16:08] every time you see
[16:10] and so in uh in the new testament jesus
[16:13] you know walked and traveled all through
[16:15] israel
[16:16] and so he uh he
[16:18] went through
[16:20] different cities but there was three
[16:21] little towns in particular
[16:23] that
[16:24] just weren't paying attention you know
[16:26] they didn't believe
[16:27] bethsaida courts him and capernaum
[16:31] he pronounced the judgment
[16:33] time passed jesus left disciples are
[16:36] traveling everybody forgot what's going
[16:38] on 60 years later the earthquake came
[16:41] and destroyed him
[16:42] all three cities today they're a pile of
[16:45] rocks
[16:47] and even the tour guides say you better
[16:48] believe the bible because when it says
[16:50] here that's exactly what happens
[16:52] now they've it built up every place else
[16:55] but those nothing there's only a few
[16:57] people in capernaum because the
[16:58] catholics owned the property and they've
[17:00] made a you know first stop out of it
[17:03] but our prophet
[17:05] uh preached in los angeles 1965
[17:08] uh choosing of a bribe and he gave a
[17:10] real good blast
[17:12] to los angeles comparing it to capernaum
[17:16] and look at it today i mean it's the
[17:18] news all time this has fallen off that's
[17:20] falling off
[17:21] and sliding away
[17:23] but brother branham said it was going to
[17:24] be a piece three to four hundred miles
[17:27] wide
[17:28] that's about to the arizona border
[17:30] and 1500 miles long
[17:32] it's gonna break off and go into the
[17:34] bottom of the ocean
[17:36] and there would be no repair for that
[17:38] so why is this important to us over here
[17:40] in 2021
[17:42] well because in first corinthians 10
[17:44] all these things happen to them for
[17:45] example and are written for our
[17:48] admonition for our learning for our
[17:50] betterment that's right
[17:51] who upon whom the ends of the world are
[17:54] come now when paul wrote this 2000 years
[17:56] ago
[17:57] he had to know
[17:58] somewhere that you know the end of the
[18:00] world wasn't going to come right then
[18:01] it's written for us
[18:03] we're the ones you see we're the end
[18:05] time generation we are at the end of the
[18:07] ages
[18:09] so the world is falling apart
[18:12] and um
[18:13] uh
[18:14] jesus said when these things begin to
[18:16] happen
[18:17] don't try to vote don't try to give
[18:20] money look up the end is near
[18:23] luke 20 28 21 28. so again we have a
[18:27] message of warning before judgment is
[18:29] simple and to the point
[18:32] what is it repent
[18:34] or perish with the unbelievers you got a
[18:36] choice
[18:37] and you can choose you know
[18:39] so we need a shaking we need to get our
[18:42] teeth rattled you know and get away from
[18:44] the attitude of sin uh the attitude of
[18:47] non-concern who cares
[18:49] that's not christian we need a trimming
[18:51] a cutaway of the lazy idol no interest
[18:54] attitude and the idolatry
[18:57] yeah it's everywhere it's not just over
[18:59] the catholic church
[19:00] no we'll get into that in a minute
[19:02] now
[19:03] i i carry this with me
[19:06] it's called a level
[19:08] see we put it here first of all we're
[19:09] going to check the pulpit
[19:11] that's pretty good yeah
[19:14] check that cross but you didn't put it
[19:16] up
[19:16] so we keep it here to to uh remind me to
[19:19] stay level but for you to
[19:22] remember the state level
[19:24] if i see anybody
[19:26] trying to go to sleep
[19:31] watch it
[19:34] so we're far beyond you know an aspirin
[19:37] or an alka-seltzer you'll be okay no
[19:39] that's not
[19:40] we won't be okay
[19:42] we need major surgery we need truth we
[19:45] cannot afford to continue to play church
[19:48] and feel good you know it's high time
[19:50] when each one actively seek the presence
[19:53] of the lord in our individual lives
[19:56] get in the closet seek how we can please
[19:59] god
[20:00] find god's will for your individual life
[20:03] remember my will or god's will
[20:06] that's the idea okay
[20:08] first john 4 20 says if a man says i
[20:10] love god and hates his brother he's a
[20:13] liar
[20:14] for he that loves is not his brother
[20:17] whom he can't see
[20:18] how can he love god whom he has not seen
[20:20] yeah
[20:21] it's a hole in your head
[20:23] so however we treat each other believer
[20:25] to believer that's how we treat god you
[20:29] see
[20:29] he's watching our reaction to all this
[20:32] stuff that's going on you see god could
[20:34] fix everything and have it all back to
[20:37] normal
[20:38] perfect order by 10 o'clock in the
[20:39] morning
[20:40] it's probably not going to happen he
[20:42] lets it go and go and go because he's
[20:44] very patient and while that's going and
[20:46] rotting and you know all the stuff
[20:48] that's going on he's watching the
[20:49] reaction of the believers
[20:52] he lets that things happen to get our
[20:53] reactions to the surface
[20:57] so
[20:58] now jonah was god's man of the hour okay
[21:01] yes he had a clear-cut decision from god
[21:04] a commandment from god go cry out
[21:06] against their sin their corruption i
[21:08] know all about the segregation i know
[21:10] all your fears i know all your doubts go
[21:13] anyway
[21:16] verse three
[21:18] but jonah
[21:19] and see when it starts out with but
[21:21] we got a problem
[21:24] but jonah rose up that morning to flee
[21:27] to tarshish
[21:29] from the presence of the lord
[21:31] he went down to joppa found the ship
[21:33] going to tarshish so he paid the fare
[21:35] went into it
[21:36] to go with them to tarshish and again in
[21:39] case you weren't paying attention the
[21:40] first time from the presence of the lord
[21:43] he was going
[21:44] this way
[21:46] okay
[21:47] so he wasn't just anybody okay he was
[21:50] god's prophet of the hour god's
[21:52] mouthpiece it's not looking good
[21:55] but it's all gonna pan out don't we're
[21:57] not going to throw no rocks at him just
[21:58] yet it's going to be okay
[22:00] so
[22:01] um
[22:02] he did not break his relationship he was
[22:04] still god's man he's still god's prophet
[22:06] but when he broke was fellowship
[22:09] you see
[22:10] and brother branham says right on tape
[22:13] anointed prophets make wrong decisions
[22:17] because they're humans
[22:20] i knew the human william branham
[22:22] i wasn't sitting out there watching the
[22:23] miracles i i knew him you see
[22:26] and so um
[22:29] so he goes down there and he finds the
[22:32] ship going that way
[22:34] and um
[22:35] he uh he reached his pocket got his five
[22:37] dollars out and paid for the ticket
[22:39] now this is a merchant ship this is no
[22:41] you know cruise liner it's a merchant
[22:43] ship
[22:44] and so they took on a you know maybe one
[22:46] or more tourists and he paid
[22:49] and so um these merchants were taking
[22:51] grain from the middle east to other
[22:53] places
[22:55] now for example in the days of paul and
[22:57] this could have been similar
[22:59] they had a ship 100 feet long
[23:02] all wood
[23:04] no steel
[23:05] 100 feet long and it could carry 300
[23:08] tons of grain
[23:09] in the merchant those merchants they're
[23:11] watching the weather if it's bad they're
[23:13] going to stay put but looks good so they
[23:15] take off
[23:16] they get out there a little ways and
[23:19] what do you think happens there's a
[23:20] storm coming up all of a sudden
[23:22] and they're scared they don't want to
[23:24] die
[23:24] so they start pitching stuff off and the
[23:26] wheat or whatever they're carrying
[23:28] and um
[23:29] but all this time god had a fish right
[23:31] there beside traveling right beside the
[23:33] boat you know right through the storm
[23:35] and so the um
[23:37] uh these these merchants they're praying
[23:40] to their gods and burning little candles
[23:42] and stuff and they said where's that
[23:44] tourist we'd let on where's he at
[23:46] well he's down our sleep
[23:48] no problem now remember he didn't have
[23:51] his he didn't have his his prophet suit
[23:54] on
[23:56] no he he looked trying to look like the
[23:57] rest of them
[23:59] just like peter you know over there in
[24:01] the new testament
[24:02] peter his main problem was his mouth you
[24:05] know he was always open at the wrong
[24:07] time
[24:09] right
[24:09] and so
[24:11] they're on the way to the garden of uh
[24:12] garden garden in gethsemane and jesus
[24:15] said then we've got a weapon oh yeah we
[24:16] got two swords fine now my son takes
[24:18] that to mean it's okay to you know
[24:20] collect guns
[24:21] so jesus said
[24:25] so they get to the garden and and jesus
[24:27] said now boys is going to get tougher a
[24:28] little bit they're going to take the son
[24:29] of man you know all these things peter
[24:32] are you kidding they got to come through
[24:33] me first you know and so um
[24:36] jesus said peter just better just zip it
[24:39] you know
[24:40] and so um sure enough here they come
[24:41] looking for jesus
[24:43] and and peter gets his sword out well
[24:46] he's
[24:47] right you know and so he gets his sword
[24:49] out and you think he was even for the
[24:51] air he probably wasn't that good of a
[24:53] swordsman probably aiming for the neck
[24:55] but somehow he tripped and missed and
[24:57] took off the ear
[24:58] remember that story so there's the ear
[25:00] that's sitting on the ground
[25:02] everybody's looking
[25:03] this guy might be bleeding a little bit
[25:05] we don't know
[25:06] jesus reaches over puts the ear on
[25:09] they should all been on their knees
[25:11] you know
[25:12] okay we got a problem here
[25:14] okay
[25:15] and so um
[25:18] they um
[25:19] so then he just immediately it wasn't
[25:22] you know five years later right
[25:23] immediately they take jesus and he's in
[25:25] the prison and everything over there
[25:26] confidence house and peter oh big mouth
[25:29] peter oh you got to come through me
[25:31] first
[25:32] somehow he bribed somebody and he gets
[25:34] into the yard
[25:36] you know when jesus is in prison there
[25:38] and so they're serving tea you know or
[25:40] coffee or something and so when they
[25:42] come to peter he says oh thank you and
[25:44] when he said thank you
[25:46] in that accent from up north
[25:48] uh-huh you're one of them
[25:50] never heard of him big old cuss word
[25:52] comes out you know yeah peter he already
[25:55] had the keys
[25:56] but no holy ghost
[25:58] so he thought he'd just kind of sneak in
[26:00] kind of you know be the crowd there
[26:02] well that's the way jonah was he was
[26:04] just down there asleep so to get him up
[26:06] there
[26:07] wow got a storm and so um
[26:10] he uh he said well i'll tell you what
[26:12] guys
[26:13] this this is my fault it's all my fault
[26:15] a little bit of revelation you know says
[26:17] throw me over everything be cool
[26:19] fine we don't need you anyway i pitched
[26:22] him over
[26:23] and he barely got wet because the fish
[26:24] was right there and he pitched him over
[26:27] right down the stomach
[26:28] now we're not going to argue about what
[26:29] the fish's name it was a big fish and it
[26:31] was a miracle fish because he had oxygen
[26:33] to breathe okay
[26:35] so
[26:37] um
[26:38] he uh
[26:39] you know
[26:40] god had this big fish a great fish he
[26:43] says because with god there's no
[26:44] surprises
[26:46] god already knew that you would be here
[26:48] tonight
[26:49] that you made the right decision you
[26:51] know others are you know we don't know
[26:53] probably not our people some of the
[26:54] people they're home you know with their
[26:56] favorite friend the remote you know
[26:59] forget paul let's go to the other
[27:00] channel you know come on yeah
[27:02] it happens
[27:04] okay
[27:04] so um
[27:07] the miracle was he could live in this
[27:09] fish okay
[27:11] and so um he's in this fish now he can't
[27:14] see anything it's black
[27:16] there's no light
[27:17] all disney put a little light there but
[27:18] there's no light and um
[27:21] it everything he touches you know it's
[27:22] soft and
[27:24] who knows what all that fish has been
[27:25] eating you know
[27:26] and so um
[27:28] it was dark and he couldn't see the
[27:30] symptoms were everywhere so the next
[27:32] time you think you got a problem you
[27:34] want it right whatever you're going to
[27:36] call a problem
[27:37] think about prophet jonah he had
[27:39] problems
[27:40] now he didn't know he's only going to be
[27:41] there three days he thought about this
[27:43] forever i don't know how i'm going to
[27:44] live but he's in this in this mess
[27:48] and so um
[27:49] uh he's um he had plenty of time to
[27:53] reflect on his decision over here in
[27:55] verse three but jonah rose up to flee
[27:57] from the presence of the lord
[27:59] yeah he had time to think about that
[28:01] and so
[28:02] he uh he couldn't see anything so that's
[28:04] you know eyes don't work
[28:06] and uh but he said these symptoms are
[28:08] lying vanities
[28:10] and he was very much alive he could
[28:11] touch
[28:12] he could taste so
[28:14] yep mousekalot yeah
[28:16] and uh couldn't see he could hear he
[28:18] could smell
[28:19] but god had oxygen there for him to live
[28:22] okay so he starts to pray and he got
[28:25] serious about praying
[28:27] because this wasn't part of the bargain
[28:29] unforeseen circumstances you know we've
[28:31] heard plenty of people well i thought it
[28:33] was going to be this way
[28:34] and i think this we don't care what you
[28:36] think
[28:37] you know wrong every time
[28:39] solomon said it's all vanity
[28:44] the symptoms are very real he had to
[28:45] ignore the present reality and focus his
[28:49] mind on the word of god
[28:51] he didn't have a bible didn't have an
[28:53] ipad
[28:54] it was up here
[28:55] right you see so he had studied the word
[28:59] he had it
[29:00] recorded
[29:01] and that's all he had you see
[29:04] and so uh he had to ignore the present
[29:06] reality
[29:08] and um no bible no prophetic transcript
[29:10] no pictures no nothing he got serious
[29:12] about praying it's in chapter 2.
[29:16] and
[29:16] i say he didn't know it's only going to
[29:17] be three days now our prophet said the
[29:19] devil's tremble when the weakest of
[29:21] saints goes to their knees
[29:25] the person that just came in last week
[29:26] when they start praying things start to
[29:28] happen because the devil you know he
[29:31] can't handle it
[29:32] what a power and a privilege has been
[29:34] given to the church of the living god
[29:37] when you fall to your knees in prayer
[29:39] even the devils tremble
[29:42] to the weakest of them
[29:44] another place and the weakest christian
[29:45] here tonight can defeat satan anywhere
[29:48] any place any time under any conditions
[29:52] with thus saith the lord
[29:55] you just believe it
[29:57] so
[29:58] why was our brother jonah in this sorry
[30:00] condition
[30:02] well apparently
[30:03] you know
[30:04] it looks like he gets shirked away from
[30:06] his duty he okay dude he's here he goes
[30:09] this way okay
[30:10] and he ran from a responsibility he ran
[30:13] from the presence of the lord he ran
[30:15] from the will of god opted for his own
[30:18] will
[30:19] remember my will or god's will but only
[30:22] the fellowship was broken not the not
[30:24] the uh the relationship
[30:26] so
[30:28] each one of us had to make choices today
[30:30] in this week you know
[30:31] and so jonah made a choice and he's
[30:34] willing to pay the price and go his own
[30:37] way
[30:38] he just didn't know didn't realize how
[30:40] high the price was going to be you see
[30:42] he chose to go in the opposite direction
[30:44] now see we we get off by two degrees we
[30:47] start feeling bad you know
[30:49] but he went the opposite direction now
[30:51] we're here close to toledo so god says i
[30:53] want you to go to toronto
[30:56] well god i think i'll go to indianapolis
[31:01] 180 degrees
[31:04] and um
[31:05] so he probably thought well you know
[31:06] there's a lot of sinful people over
[31:08] there in tarshish i'll just go preach
[31:09] over there it won't be so much hassle so
[31:11] much opposition
[31:12] and god would have blessed his word
[31:14] regardless
[31:16] but obedience is much better than
[31:17] sacrifice
[31:18] and i'm sure that every one of you got
[31:20] some kind of testimony just to make that
[31:22] come true
[31:23] and um
[31:25] because you know we have catholics we
[31:26] got baptists we got charismatics they're
[31:28] all using the same bible
[31:30] there's not some foreign bible muslims
[31:32] they got some other bible but all in
[31:34] christian world they got the same bible
[31:36] and um
[31:38] many are being blessed i mean you're
[31:39] being healed there's miracles they
[31:42] believe they're approaching god
[31:44] you see
[31:45] god honors faith that's right and i can
[31:47] show you something where i don't have
[31:48] this i don't think in this culture but
[31:50] where brother rem says and god ignores
[31:53] your doctrine
[31:55] and we've made such a mountain out of
[31:56] the doctrine's got to be this way and
[31:58] all people aren't seeing it this way
[31:59] they're going to hell come on wait a
[32:01] minute
[32:02] god gave the holy ghost to those that
[32:04] obeyed him amen okay
[32:07] so
[32:08] um thirsting for life phoenix
[32:11] and this great pillar of fire the angel
[32:13] of god the logos that went out of god
[32:15] and led the children of israel through
[32:17] the wilderness when it came amongst the
[32:18] people it separated itself and great
[32:21] licks of fire came upon each pillar each
[32:23] one as the pillar fire began to break up
[32:25] god dividing himself amongst his people
[32:28] okay
[32:29] all that ought to tear the heart out of
[32:31] anybody god tearing himself apart that
[32:33] he might divide himself a little bit to
[32:35] each one of us
[32:37] then he says can you see why i'm
[32:38] standing for unity
[32:40] of every church
[32:42] comma not period
[32:45] no
[32:46] standing for the unity of every church
[32:48] oh thank you lord that's the same thing
[32:49] the pope says he wants everybody you
[32:51] know
[32:52] comma every full gospel church okay that
[32:54] narrows down comma every believer
[32:58] yeah we want the unity of the believers
[33:01] we have to be of one heart one mind one
[33:03] accord no matter how much we differ in
[33:05] scriptures
[33:07] people different scriptures people
[33:09] differing quotes some of you don't like
[33:10] the quotes we're reading here
[33:13] yeah and there's a bunch of people out
[33:14] there and sitting on the couch well
[33:15] who's he you know
[33:19] and so he says
[33:20] no matter how much we differ in
[33:22] scriptures
[33:23] or you know your favorite quotations
[33:25] that might be
[33:26] one might see it this way
[33:28] has nothing to do with it here's the
[33:30] part i want to get to but in principle
[33:33] we have to stand one great mighty army
[33:35] of god marching on because each one of
[33:37] you in your peculiarity
[33:41] now i've been working with brother
[33:42] banner's words for 50 years and when he
[33:45] uses a new word pops out you know
[33:47] now you're looking at one person
[33:49] very peculiar but i'm looking at all the
[33:51] peculiar people out there
[33:53] you see
[33:54] we didn't all drive the same kind of car
[33:55] did we
[33:57] and so
[33:58] he says here
[34:00] um
[34:03] because each one of you in your
[34:05] peculiarity god has proved that he's
[34:07] ignoring your doctrine because he gave
[34:10] you the holy ghost and the bible said he
[34:12] gave to them the holy ghost those that
[34:13] obeyed him acts 5 32. now if i obey him
[34:16] in my peculiar way
[34:18] and you obey him in your peculiar way
[34:22] he gave us both the holy ghost so we
[34:24] ought to be christian and brethren and
[34:26] sisters enough to arm up together that's
[34:28] not single file okay arm up together is
[34:30] like this
[34:32] and uh arm up together and march for one
[34:34] great purpose the gospel
[34:36] so that's why i felt led to come by here
[34:38] to encourage you to arm up together
[34:40] forget all the silly stuff
[34:42] you know
[34:43] but see unto us he's revealed the
[34:45] mysteries of the kingdom
[34:47] god doesn't hold all the neighbors
[34:48] accountable for what you know
[34:50] he's revealed himself to you now are you
[34:52] a display of this message or are you a
[34:55] display of a peculiar doctrine
[34:57] we should be brothers and sisters enough
[35:00] he's trusting you with his secrets the
[35:02] fullness of the revelation
[35:04] so god has a perfect will and he's got a
[35:06] permissive will okay
[35:08] for each one of us
[35:10] okay the prophet goes on here in uh does
[35:12] he change does god change his mind 65.
[35:15] we try to work on god's permissive will
[35:16] and he will permit it but also if we
[35:18] take his permissive will though it's not
[35:20] right he will make his permissive we'll
[35:21] work around together to glorify his
[35:24] perfectness
[35:27] but there will be a price
[35:29] you go off you know
[35:31] he'll bring you back but it won't be
[35:32] cheap
[35:34] another place he says we must submit
[35:36] ourselves to his will and to his word
[35:38] don't question it believe it don't try
[35:40] to find our way around it just take it
[35:42] the way it is somebody wants to go
[35:44] around and get some other way and when
[35:45] you do you find yourself going on and
[35:47] you'll find god blessing you but you're
[35:49] working in his permissive will and not
[35:51] his perfect divine will
[35:54] so
[35:55] we'll get back to jonah don't worry i
[35:56] don't know where i'm at that's why i i
[35:58] go by notes you know some people they
[36:00] just pull out of the air
[36:02] but you see people ask me well brother
[36:04] george how can i know
[36:05] for sure god's perfect will
[36:08] right you know
[36:10] young girls young boys people want to
[36:12] know
[36:14] well here's your clue
[36:15] god's word
[36:16] and god's spirit and god's will always
[36:19] run in parallel
[36:20] they never cross
[36:22] no they run perfect parallel okay
[36:25] and they always agree the word the will
[36:28] the spirit run in parallel and they run
[36:30] in harmony
[36:32] you guys know all about music here i
[36:34] don't know about music my wife is known
[36:35] about music but you know we can't have
[36:37] these instruments one in a flat and one
[36:40] in d minor and one in f sharp they've
[36:42] got to be in harmony it's got to work
[36:43] together you know
[36:45] now some people have a portion of the
[36:48] word memorized to the very letter
[36:50] but the wires are crossed
[36:52] and they display a contrary spirit even
[36:54] though they they're quoting the word see
[36:57] there's no harmony with the rest of the
[36:58] word so it produces bad fruit bad
[37:00] results it's contrary to the word
[37:04] jesus told the woman at the well now
[37:05] that's one uh
[37:07] person
[37:08] we don't know her name
[37:10] we're not gonna guess we'll find we're
[37:11] gonna meet her soon
[37:13] but
[37:14] she appears just about every time
[37:15] brother man refers to her
[37:17] and so he said
[37:19] he told us now look
[37:21] god is looking for people that will
[37:24] worship him in spirit and truth that's
[37:26] where this comes in in spirit and in
[37:28] truth
[37:30] i know people got all kinds of spirit
[37:32] and they about tear the church down
[37:33] every time tear up the piano and just
[37:35] just you know
[37:36] wreck
[37:37] and other people got all kinds of truth
[37:40] and they all go to sleep
[37:42] well both are wrong
[37:44] you got to be balanced see
[37:47] okay
[37:49] so they asked brother branham one day
[37:51] how do you feel is the best way to find
[37:53] the lord's will in some important
[37:54] matters
[37:55] that's a good question all of our things
[37:57] are important you know
[37:58] he says i'll tell you dear friend the
[38:00] best way to find the will of god in some
[38:01] important matters is
[38:02] prayer now before you fall off the bench
[38:05] yeah i know you already knew that you
[38:07] know naaman knew that you had to get in
[38:08] the water but it had to be in special
[38:09] water
[38:10] okay
[38:12] important matters prayer
[38:14] here's the way i do i take it before the
[38:15] lord
[38:17] it's always been my strength i wait upon
[38:19] the lord see what he says and i just let
[38:21] myself be neutral to it
[38:23] oh that's hard to do
[38:26] you know the young girl wants that boy
[38:30] well he might not be interested
[38:32] you know it happens
[38:33] or you know somebody might want a white
[38:35] truck an old thing on the lots green
[38:37] trucks
[38:38] i want i want you got to be the prayer
[38:40] neutral okay
[38:42] don't take either side so if i was in
[38:44] your place and didn't have these visions
[38:46] from the lord i would just wait up on
[38:47] the lord and i said lord you show me
[38:49] what's this decision to make
[38:51] and then the way you feel it to do it
[38:52] then
[38:54] wait
[38:55] ah so we got prayer
[38:57] we got neutral we got weight
[38:59] those aren't fruits of the 21st century
[39:02] now down there where i live and of
[39:04] course you got all these restaurants up
[39:05] here too but i know people they they
[39:08] love good coffee i know this one guy so
[39:10] he goes but down the road he's aiming
[39:12] for for starbucks
[39:14] but there's six cars at starbucks ah
[39:16] forget it you'll go across the street
[39:18] and get something else they can't wait
[39:22] and so
[39:24] he says um
[39:25] i says wait
[39:27] and then wait a little bit and then wait
[39:28] a little bit longer and see which side
[39:31] you know he leans which way the spirit
[39:32] now father in my heart you know it does
[39:34] not matter but i want to know what you
[39:36] want to do about it
[39:37] so we got joan over here
[39:39] god did make his permissive will turn
[39:42] around to accomplish his perfect will
[39:44] okay
[39:45] the special fish right there in the
[39:47] bible delivered jonah
[39:50] um
[39:51] on the shore
[39:53] and god reminded him
[39:55] go
[39:56] now i know you've listened to
[39:58] william branham
[40:00] and a lot of times when he tells us he
[40:02] gets into jonah he says you know a few
[40:04] times says that that the people of
[40:06] nineveh they worship the god of the sea
[40:08] so here comes the
[40:10] fish you know cruising up there he stuck
[40:12] at his tongue and prophet walked off
[40:14] they all believed
[40:15] well go listen a little more he says
[40:17] yeah i read that in a book one time
[40:18] because it doesn't jive with scripture
[40:20] at all and he told us
[40:22] check it out with the word well the word
[40:24] says
[40:25] over here
[40:27] in where we have chapter 2 verse 10 and
[40:29] the lord spake unto the fish and vomited
[40:31] out showing up on the dry land
[40:33] okay now you all raise little kids you
[40:36] know sometimes you get sick of the
[40:37] stomach right sometimes you're in
[40:38] traffic going 70 miles an hour and
[40:40] you've got a bad situation right
[40:43] now jonah's been over three days or
[40:45] about three days
[40:46] in this vomit
[40:50] and he is covered
[40:53] now this fish
[40:54] vomits him out on
[40:55] dry land now he's rolling in the sand
[40:59] really got a mess
[41:02] the only solution for brother jonah is
[41:04] go down to the car wash and get a bath
[41:07] then get some clean clothes and go
[41:09] preach
[41:10] because verse 1 of chapter 3 and the
[41:13] word of the lord came unto jonah the
[41:14] second time arise go to nineveh they
[41:17] great city and preach unto it the
[41:18] preaching that i bid thee
[41:20] okay
[41:22] so the object lesson here very clearly
[41:25] is that you might not have the luxury of
[41:28] a second chance the way jonah did you
[41:31] see
[41:32] he he got a second chance
[41:34] god could have left the digestive juices
[41:36] in the fish
[41:38] make nothing out of him
[41:40] it was a special fish
[41:41] and he got a second chance
[41:43] now a long time ago
[41:45] uh i'm sure most of you have read the uh
[41:48] i've seen the movie the ten commandments
[41:50] well that came out in 1955. the first
[41:53] color movie that came out was gone with
[41:54] the win 1939. so by 1955 they didn't
[41:58] even i think it was 55 or 56 is when
[42:00] color tv came out so here's the ten
[42:02] commandments
[42:04] and some of the people at the church and
[42:06] jeffersonville had seen it so they said
[42:08] oh brother brandon you need to save
[42:09] what's great okay so he gathers himself
[42:12] his wife and rebecca which she would
[42:13] have been nine years old at the time and
[42:15] they're going to go down to new albany
[42:17] uh a theater about half the size of this
[42:19] building
[42:20] and um
[42:21] and they're going to watch the movie
[42:22] well so they're sitting there you know
[42:24] and
[42:25] probably
[42:26] not too many about half the sizes i've
[42:28] been there once and um so they're
[42:31] watching the movie and you know on the
[42:33] screen they did so well that when the
[42:35] pillar of fire comes whirling onto the
[42:36] screen brother brandon the same thing
[42:38] he'd always say jumps up takes off his
[42:39] hat
[42:41] oh just a movie casey sits down yeah
[42:44] yeah it was so real
[42:46] well
[42:47] they weren't used to sitting in a
[42:48] four-hour movie so anyway they're going
[42:50] home
[42:52] and
[42:53] rebecca's crying he's nine years old
[42:55] he's very sensitive
[42:56] and so um
[42:58] uh brother bram said well honey what
[42:59] what's the matter
[43:01] and you know i just took a movie and all
[43:02] that
[43:03] but dad didn't you see of course to her
[43:05] like a newsreel you know
[43:07] and so on the movie
[43:09] moses says oh it's on the lord's side
[43:11] come with me you know
[43:12] so here's of course he says that so
[43:14] we're watching the people come with him
[43:16] but she's watching those people that
[43:18] waited for two minutes
[43:19] the earth opened up they're gone
[43:21] so she's feeling sorry for those people
[43:24] so brother brahms will okay
[43:27] now that you notice that let this be a
[43:29] lesson when god says something you move
[43:33] now
[43:34] not tomorrow not when grandma says it's
[43:36] okay and so forth you you moved right
[43:38] now
[43:39] and so that's a lesson
[43:41] now he got a second chance you might not
[43:43] get a second chance
[43:46] so he went and preached a very powerful
[43:48] anointing
[43:49] you can read all about in chapter three
[43:52] and um uh records the reaction of the
[43:55] people
[43:55] the preaching of the word of god
[43:57] greatest revival in recorded history the
[44:00] entire city of 120 000 turned to god
[44:04] stayed back the wrath of god they had a
[44:06] choice repent or perish with the
[44:08] unbelievers
[44:10] but guess what about 150 years later
[44:12] they forgot entirely about god
[44:15] forgot about the mercy forgiveness and
[44:17] god
[44:18] let the babylonians come down
[44:20] in 621 bc and utterly destroyed this
[44:25] powder
[44:27] so devastating was the destruction that
[44:28] the ruins were not even discovered
[44:31] just over 100 years ago
[44:33] 2500 years later oh here's nineveh
[44:38] pretty bad
[44:41] there's such a hatred to destroy
[44:43] and you can see that in the some of the
[44:45] people in the middle east right now they
[44:47] don't care they just want to destroy you
[44:49] see now
[44:52] scofield says such is the way of god
[44:55] light rejected brings destruction
[44:59] brother branham said in 1956
[45:01] this year
[45:03] america is going to make a decision
[45:05] he says i believe shields right side the
[45:07] wrong way so he spoke that in 56 and
[45:10] we're seeing the effects of it now all
[45:12] these years later
[45:14] so
[45:15] um but god always warns first
[45:19] you see we're seeing the fulfillment of
[45:21] prophecy
[45:23] jonah was in fact a very crucial part of
[45:26] a much larger picture
[45:27] so much so that's repeated by our lord
[45:29] in
[45:30] matthew chapter 12.
[45:32] so here's the the point when you don't
[45:35] fully understand an issue or something
[45:38] that's going on
[45:39] or why paul did this or why rebecca did
[45:42] that um
[45:46] be still i'm gone i gotta figure it out
[45:48] don't need your opinions
[45:50] you know be careful because that could
[45:52] be part of a larger picture
[45:55] see jonah's whole ordeal here was part
[45:57] of a larger picture he wasn't out of the
[45:59] will of god
[46:00] he had this detour you know
[46:03] so god allows these scenes to play out
[46:06] in order to bring reactions to the
[46:08] surface
[46:10] then he can judge certain things
[46:12] so god has not called me or you or
[46:14] anybody else i know to straighten out
[46:16] the things that you think are out of
[46:18] order
[46:20] it would seem that god's man god's
[46:22] prophet of the age god's anointed
[46:23] messenger it would seem that he was
[46:25] backslidden stepped out of the will of
[46:27] god
[46:28] it would seem
[46:30] that way because we are mortals
[46:32] and we all have a canary brain
[46:34] some have a you know chicken brain
[46:37] and
[46:39] we're very small creatures we don't have
[46:41] all the facts
[46:43] see we make things up and we make knee
[46:45] jerk judgments on partial information
[46:49] now i spent a lot of time in the
[46:51] airports
[46:52] and
[46:53] um
[46:54] there was a time when we didn't have
[46:56] cell phones you know
[46:57] then cell phones came out and then
[46:59] everybody hadn't had the latest gadgets
[47:00] you know so here are these people
[47:02] walking around the airport they got a
[47:03] little something in their ear there's no
[47:05] phone nothing they're just talking away
[47:06] blah blah blah
[47:09] and of course the first time you see
[47:10] that wonder are these people insane
[47:12] but see there's somebody at the other
[47:13] end that's talking to them and so you're
[47:15] only hearing part of it and so based on
[47:18] what i hear i can make a judgment you're
[47:20] wrong
[47:22] and we do that you know on partial
[47:24] information
[47:26] so very few people in any given age
[47:28] recognize the value of the message of
[47:29] god during their day
[47:32] hindsight is great you see
[47:34] now we have for example simeon that
[47:36] lived near the temple and
[47:39] god told simmy now son i know you're old
[47:41] but you're not going to die until you
[47:43] see the salvation of israel you know the
[47:46] story
[47:47] and so whenever the dedication of babies
[47:50] you know say it's two days a week or
[47:51] something he would go out and he'd love
[47:53] no nothing today go back to sleep but
[47:55] then one day he goes out there ah
[47:57] there's the sign god show me that wasn't
[47:59] some big lie we don't know what it was
[48:01] nobody else saw it
[48:02] and um so he goes over and he was
[48:05] spirit-led and he was one of the few
[48:07] that recognized what god was doing in
[48:09] present tense
[48:11] he goes up to mary can i hold the baby
[48:13] so only mary and joseph and simeon knew
[48:16] what was going on nobody else they
[48:18] didn't look different they didn't have
[48:19] fine clothes on they were just like
[48:20] everybody else
[48:21] and so he raised the baby let that
[48:23] servant depart in peace my eyes have
[48:25] seen as salvation
[48:27] now
[48:28] our prophet says over here in questions
[48:30] and answers from hebrews this city of
[48:32] jeffersonville at the day of judgment
[48:34] will answer a great price someday
[48:36] for there have been hundreds and
[48:38] hundreds of outstanding healings done
[48:40] right here that's right right here signs
[48:43] and wonders the appearing of the angel
[48:44] down at the at the river and the papers
[48:47] blasted and so forth and still people
[48:49] don't believe
[48:50] why is that
[48:51] now someday i'm going to leave here he
[48:53] says i'm 48 years old why didn't the
[48:56] world recognize the picture
[48:57] you know the halo
[48:59] why didn't they catch that right quick
[49:01] why don't they catch these other things
[49:03] why don't they catch these prophecies
[49:04] and things you know they can't do it now
[49:07] but one day i'm going to leave this
[49:09] world and then when i leave they will
[49:11] recognize it some of you young people
[49:13] will realize that after i'm gone
[49:17] this day
[49:18] this scripture has been fulfilled
[49:21] 1964 the harvest time what did the
[49:23] lutherans do after the death of martin
[49:25] luther
[49:26] they met satan and made a denomination
[49:28] out of it and died she never done
[49:32] anything else after that it was done it
[49:33] just became a great mass of people
[49:36] okay now there's two tapes that if you
[49:38] haven't listened to him
[49:40] recently
[49:42] albuquerque new mexico april of 63.
[49:46] world falling apart
[49:47] and um
[49:49] um god and simplicity
[49:51] very different from anything else these
[49:53] two tapes stand alone
[49:55] things he says there doesn't say nowhere
[49:56] else
[49:57] now he just preached the seals now his
[49:59] pressure's off he's over here with the
[50:00] christian businessman and he's preaching
[50:03] he says you know you might not believe
[50:04] that but this is taped
[50:06] i listened to it a few years from today
[50:08] if there is such
[50:09] and then you will know whether it's true
[50:11] or not one day when the evening lights
[50:13] are breaking and it's too late then
[50:14] you'll say that man could have been
[50:15] right
[50:16] it's too late then just exactly like
[50:19] jesus said when he was here on earth
[50:20] quote
[50:21] god sent you all prophets down through
[50:23] the ages
[50:24] and um and what did you do with each one
[50:27] god sent the prophet you all killed him
[50:29] put him in the grave exactly and then in
[50:31] about another generation you wake up and
[50:33] realize that was a prophet
[50:35] and then what do you do you garnish a
[50:36] tomb
[50:38] what do you do make a tradition of his
[50:40] life
[50:43] that is exactly what israel had done
[50:45] moses
[50:47] every sabbath
[50:49] every saturday around the world they
[50:50] read a portion of their prophet
[50:52] a tradition moses they made a tradition
[50:55] of his life that's the way we do with
[50:57] martin luther john wesley and other men
[51:02] it says here
[51:04] we are always looking back making a
[51:06] tradition of their life garnishing their
[51:08] tombs and their message was for another
[51:10] day by the time you wake up that day is
[51:11] going to live by we're in another day
[51:13] the whole system has worked that way
[51:15] since the beginning man-made systems
[51:18] think about it
[51:19] so we got to give you the bad news is
[51:22] brother bram's life going to be
[51:23] different
[51:24] he says that's the way we do with all of
[51:25] them see
[51:26] so people are just now a lot of times
[51:28] realizing what this is all about we have
[51:30] the warning so when you don't understand
[51:32] when you don't have all the facts be
[51:34] careful amen
[51:37] amen
[51:39] okay let's hurry here um
[51:41] so jonah was god's prophet but as human
[51:44] he looked for the easy way
[51:47] no pressure all to agree pat on the back
[51:49] and many times god will he'll show us
[51:52] his will because it's real obvious
[51:54] yeah but you know grandma said
[51:56] and this and that and it's going to cost
[51:59] money and you know
[52:01] we got reservations in myrtle beach or
[52:03] whatever you know
[52:05] we discuss with the relatives
[52:07] and um looking for a consensus
[52:10] we're looking for the easy way
[52:12] brother branham says you have to
[52:14] struggle to do the will of god sometimes
[52:17] it's not easy but it will produce the
[52:19] best results
[52:20] so today we have message believers
[52:23] i call them book carriers because
[52:26] a lot of people like to carry the book
[52:28] but just can't live it
[52:29] it's too hard oh brother branham you
[52:31] know
[52:32] so we've got these book carriers
[52:34] willfully that's self will not god's
[52:36] will they're climbing onto boats that
[52:38] are headed
[52:39] to tarshish
[52:41] see
[52:42] god has ordained in his word a certain
[52:44] way
[52:45] god told jonah to go northeast
[52:47] he said i'm going to go away from the
[52:49] presence of god i'm going to go
[52:50] southwest
[52:51] and today there's other boats not 180
[52:54] degrees off no there's just two degrees
[52:57] off
[52:58] well they got the same songs and you
[53:00] know it's okay
[53:01] sometimes they have the same guest
[53:03] speaker or whatever
[53:05] it looks like we're going in the same
[53:06] direction but when it's too late
[53:09] well this isn't the ship of zion after
[53:10] all huh
[53:12] it's just strange and so
[53:15] uh we're going in the wrong direction
[53:17] only too late
[53:19] they're not going to heaven they're
[53:20] going someplace else
[53:22] so yeah anointed once at the end time
[53:24] and they begin to check it out well this
[53:26] isn't even the ship of zion after all so
[53:28] friends you can have a leading
[53:31] now this is pretty deep stuff here you
[53:33] can have a leading you can have a
[53:34] doctrine a promise right out of the
[53:36] pages of the bible okay
[53:38] but if it's not in god's proper
[53:40] season flowing in the economy of god
[53:43] in the plan of god for the hour
[53:46] you'll be fighting the will of god
[53:48] you'll be fleeing from the presence of
[53:50] the living god
[53:51] thinking and believing you're right
[53:54] there's all kinds of people out there
[53:55] carrying these books in the same bible
[53:58] they're off the track they're not even
[53:59] in the same spirit
[54:01] you'll be choosing your will and not
[54:03] god's will not having rightly divided
[54:06] the word of truth
[54:07] you see and there will be a price to pay
[54:10] so
[54:12] revelation chapter four nowadays are so
[54:15] uh they say well we don't believe in
[54:16] saying hell in the pulpit we need men of
[54:18] god who won't hold back
[54:20] now everybody can't be a preacher that's
[54:22] obvious but you
[54:25] have a voice
[54:26] if if you're a preacher you're called to
[54:28] the pulpit to preach if you're not
[54:30] you're still a preacher
[54:32] but live the people a sermon
[54:36] how do we do that well when you with
[54:38] your long hair and your proper kind of
[54:40] dress go to the supermarket
[54:42] when people oh how are you doing sister
[54:44] okay they get a pass but the ones that
[54:46] look over there oh look at them they
[54:47] think there's something well they just
[54:49] cut their self off right there you're
[54:51] preaching you see
[54:52] let your sermon be lived and it's the
[54:55] voice of god that'll bring reproach to
[54:57] them who reject it
[54:58] just live your sermon
[55:00] just be natural
[55:02] the preachers call to preach his and
[55:03] live it too if you can't live it then
[55:05] stop preaching but you're supposed to
[55:06] live your sermons
[55:09] how we need in jeffersonville thousands
[55:12] of lived voices
[55:15] everybody that comes to this church
[55:17] while they go out and by the time they
[55:18] come back they should have lived their
[55:20] sermon out there
[55:22] they should see that something's
[55:23] different about you people you know
[55:25] um we need thousands of
[55:28] lived voices that's the thunder
[55:30] of god thundering out in what sweetness
[55:34] holiness purity undefiled lives walking
[55:37] around the earth today without a blemish
[55:40] yes sir real christians that's the
[55:42] thunder against the enemy the devil
[55:44] doesn't care how how loud you can holler
[55:47] he doesn't care how much you can jump or
[55:49] do this or that what hurts the devil
[55:52] is to see that sanctified holy life
[55:55] consecrated to god
[55:56] say anything to him you want call him
[55:59] anything he's just as sweet as he can be
[56:01] and moves right on that throws him
[56:04] that's the thunder that shakes the devil
[56:06] not how much you memorize not how smart
[56:09] you are who your grandma is no no
[56:11] live your message
[56:13] [Music]
[56:14] a long time ago like 900 years ago there
[56:17] was a man called francis of assists all
[56:19] the catholics knew all about him
[56:22] but brother brahm said he was a gospel
[56:23] preacher
[56:24] and among other things he said
[56:27] um
[56:28] preach always use words when necessary
[56:32] oh that's different because you know we
[56:34] all got our little magic machine here
[56:36] and we blah blah blah blah if we don't
[56:39] know it we look it up you know it's all
[56:40] here everything
[56:43] but you just live your message
[56:46] and then if they ask a question
[56:48] what are you gonna do oh gotta call
[56:49] brother paul no you gotta have an answer
[56:53] if you've been in the church over six
[56:54] months you gotta know that there's five
[56:55] comings of elijah and that's where you
[56:57] start
[56:59] so you go look for them they're in there
[57:02] that's right yeah it's just it's bible
[57:05] because none of your neighbors no one of
[57:07] your neighbors has one iota about
[57:09] william brown they don't care
[57:12] they will if they can see the bible oh
[57:14] well you guys got a point
[57:15] okay
[57:16] so
[57:18] if we turn our back on the word
[57:20] maybe not openly like you know jonah
[57:22] opposite direction but just with
[57:24] indifference just with a bad attitude we
[57:26] are fleeing from the presence of the
[57:28] lord following an antichrist spirit and
[57:31] an antichrist doctrine yes
[57:33] soon you'll be anointed with arrogance
[57:36] and selfishness and self-righteousness
[57:38] respect of persons none of that comes
[57:41] from god
[57:42] i hope nobody here has any of that with
[57:44] you but
[57:45] you know
[57:46] we can pray with you
[57:47] so if we deviate just one degree off a
[57:49] true center
[57:51] see like this here you know
[57:52] i've got another one it's a little
[57:54] fancier than this it'll show you're off
[57:56] quarter inch eighth an inch what else
[57:57] you know there's nicer ones um i met a
[58:00] guy from canada once had one he said
[58:02] like five thousand dollars well
[58:05] can't carry that around you know
[58:06] but uh if you're off just one degree off
[58:08] a true center you're not going to hit
[58:10] the target because it just keeps getting
[58:12] wider and wider you know
[58:14] now
[58:15] a few years ago i took my boys over to
[58:17] africa
[58:19] rebecca always wanted to go so fine we
[58:21] got some money together
[58:22] some miles
[58:24] went over there and um
[58:26] so they're gonna go hunting okay
[58:28] so um
[58:29] we didn't take any guns because they got
[58:31] plenty of guns so we're out there in the
[58:33] wilderness and uh oh there comes that
[58:35] animal you know
[58:36] so
[58:37] they give stephen the shot so he shoots
[58:39] well he's he's a hunter so he of course
[58:41] didn't hit the animal but he knew that
[58:43] he was like three inches high or
[58:44] something
[58:46] so
[58:46] he says okay now animals are all scared
[58:48] now we gotta adjust this gun
[58:50] got to get zeroed in
[58:52] so he goes and um
[58:54] he puts a little kleenex out there at 50
[58:56] yards
[58:57] and comes back here to adjust the sights
[58:59] the way he thinks it should be
[59:01] and where everybody goes out to look
[59:03] he was almost there within a half an
[59:05] inch so he comes back he adjusts it
[59:08] again
[59:09] he shoots and then they're going to go
[59:11] see again and i just sit still they say
[59:12] aren't you going no i know that he hit
[59:14] it i can tell you he hit it
[59:17] well he was the hero a man can actually
[59:20] you know
[59:21] shoot where you want to shoot with a gun
[59:24] so i don't know how they ever kill
[59:25] anything over there but
[59:27] he he was the star i mean he could
[59:29] actually hit the target you know so
[59:33] you have to be dead on for it to work
[59:37] so
[59:38] you know when mary and joseph took the
[59:41] little boy jesus
[59:43] and they took him down to jerusalem for
[59:44] the for the bar mitzvah and they're
[59:46] coming back well see that's a big thing
[59:48] all the families involved and so forth
[59:50] so they're coming back home
[59:52] to nazareth and they get to the end of
[59:54] the first day and they're going to set
[59:56] up camp and everything
[59:57] and
[59:58] mary says joseph
[1:00:00] where's the boy
[1:00:02] well i don't know i thought it was your
[1:00:03] day to watch him
[1:00:05] he wasn't there
[1:00:07] they thought he was with him
[1:00:09] you know
[1:00:10] well they had a lovely night didn't they
[1:00:12] so the next day they head back and they
[1:00:13] found him you know the whole story but
[1:00:15] one thing that
[1:00:16] is always amazing to me when they
[1:00:18] finally when they found him the next day
[1:00:20] uh mary's attitude
[1:00:22] i mean if you leave your child in you
[1:00:24] know downtown toledo someplace and you
[1:00:26] go back and look for him there he is
[1:00:28] next day well oh honey
[1:00:30] no she says jesus
[1:00:32] why did you do this to me you made me
[1:00:34] look bad
[1:00:35] it's right there in the bible
[1:00:38] but they they ventured off in the land
[1:00:39] of make-believe leaving behind the
[1:00:42] promise of god for the hour you see and
[1:00:44] many to do today are doing the same
[1:00:46] thing thinking that god is with them
[1:00:49] but their life doesn't show it their
[1:00:51] doctrine doesn't show it
[1:00:53] okay we're almost finished
[1:00:55] we have something here in 1964 looking
[1:00:57] under jesus it's possible today that
[1:00:59] good man fine men walking with christ
[1:01:02] reading his word still don't recognize
[1:01:04] this is the hour that certain things of
[1:01:05] this bible must be fulfilled
[1:01:07] it's the hour that we're living in the
[1:01:09] time is in hamlet these things must be
[1:01:10] done it's written and it must be
[1:01:13] fulfilled because god promised it yes
[1:01:16] our eyes must be opened to see the word
[1:01:18] now the pharisees had that word all
[1:01:20] drawn out you know they had their chart
[1:01:22] and here's going to happen this and then
[1:01:24] messiah and so forth they had it all
[1:01:26] figured out the way messiah was coming
[1:01:29] they believed they were right
[1:01:31] and there he was born there walked right
[1:01:33] amongst them they condemned him
[1:01:35] when he told him
[1:01:37] you know y'all need to search the
[1:01:38] scriptures
[1:01:39] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:01:41] life
[1:01:42] and these are religious people these
[1:01:43] weren't you know communists they were
[1:01:45] they were bible believers they had the
[1:01:46] bible you know that moses
[1:01:49] and
[1:01:50] he says they testify me
[1:01:53] us search the scriptures
[1:01:55] we're moses disciples
[1:01:58] you know we come from certain places we
[1:02:00] know it all
[1:02:02] and he said if you would be moses
[1:02:04] disciples you would know that he wrote
[1:02:05] about me
[1:02:06] you see
[1:02:07] and so
[1:02:09] if they would have known moses writings
[1:02:11] they would have known him they thought
[1:02:13] they'd do moses writings but they didn't
[1:02:15] know it they were blinded to that fact
[1:02:18] so just a few words from him and what'd
[1:02:21] they do
[1:02:22] well this man's got a devil where'd he
[1:02:24] come from
[1:02:25] but they failed to see that the very god
[1:02:27] that promised the word was vindicating
[1:02:29] it right there through the person of
[1:02:30] jesus christ for he was the light of the
[1:02:32] hour he was the light for the people to
[1:02:34] walk in
[1:02:36] and only the word of god produces light
[1:02:38] god's word produces the sunshine
[1:02:41] now i don't know if you've thought about
[1:02:42] this but you know there's a
[1:02:46] there's a group of people in this great
[1:02:47] country of ours they call the flat earth
[1:02:50] society
[1:02:51] and they think this is the flat earth
[1:02:55] maybe they've never strayed too far from
[1:02:56] the house
[1:02:57] but
[1:02:58] they had a convention a couple years ago
[1:03:00] and they invited an astronaut to speak
[1:03:02] to him
[1:03:04] now the astronauts been up there and he
[1:03:05] saw this ball down here hanging in space
[1:03:07] it's round
[1:03:10] so i don't know what happened to that
[1:03:11] convention but
[1:03:13] this this ball ron it's just it's here
[1:03:17] what's holding it up
[1:03:19] and the moon goes around every 30 days
[1:03:21] you know and and the moon
[1:03:23] all this stuff but
[1:03:25] he says god's word produces the sunshine
[1:03:28] god's word produces the earth produces
[1:03:30] the air everything is the word of god
[1:03:32] made manifest
[1:03:34] everything that's got a reality to it so
[1:03:36] when he was here he said
[1:03:39] i am god besides me there is no other
[1:03:42] so look around be sensitive to your
[1:03:44] surroundings don't take things for
[1:03:46] granted
[1:03:47] don't assume that everybody's going to
[1:03:49] stop because you're coming through
[1:03:51] it doesn't work that way
[1:03:53] we live in an insane world
[1:03:56] also prophesied because in 1964 brother
[1:03:59] branham said if this goes on the way it
[1:04:01] is going right now
[1:04:03] in 50 years it'll be total insanity
[1:04:06] that friends was about seven years ago
[1:04:09] in
[1:04:10] 2014. so discern your surroundings be
[1:04:14] sure that he's with you
[1:04:16] check up our life
[1:04:18] our doctrine our experience has to match
[1:04:20] god's word
[1:04:22] not some explanation not because your
[1:04:24] favorite preacher no
[1:04:26] no
[1:04:27] we cannot afford any longer to live in a
[1:04:30] glare
[1:04:31] we gotta live now prepare for tomorrow
[1:04:34] see here we are uh what is this
[1:04:36] wednesday night
[1:04:37] you've already forgot what you had for
[1:04:38] breakfast monday morning you know that's
[1:04:40] passed that water went down the river
[1:04:42] it's gone
[1:04:44] you know
[1:04:45] and who knows if you're even going to
[1:04:46] get to the house tonight but you're
[1:04:48] living right now this is present reality
[1:04:50] see live for the day prepare for
[1:04:53] tomorrow because we are on a journey
[1:04:55] we're going someplace we're not going in
[1:04:56] circles we're going someplace we're
[1:04:59] going to the gate of the resurrection
[1:05:01] and when we get there then everything's
[1:05:03] cool everything's okay then god's in
[1:05:06] control you don't have to worry about a
[1:05:08] thing
[1:05:10] so
[1:05:12] we have
[1:05:13] a lot of religious tourists in our midst
[1:05:17] and they're collecting
[1:05:18] religious uh trinkets and souvenirs you
[1:05:21] know
[1:05:22] and they're right at the point of
[1:05:23] burning candles
[1:05:26] i know that's foreign to you guys but
[1:05:27] there's places
[1:05:29] that i know about
[1:05:30] the big picture brother branham
[1:05:32] burning candles
[1:05:33] people kneeling down to it i mean the
[1:05:36] idolatry is everywhere you know
[1:05:40] but the thing is they have no
[1:05:41] relationship with jesus christ you see
[1:05:43] the author and the finisher of eternal
[1:05:45] life
[1:05:47] and so
[1:05:48] brother brown says well that's the way
[1:05:49] it is today with people who call
[1:05:50] themselves christians oh i belong to
[1:05:52] church that's good but you see the
[1:05:54] reason there is so much trouble in the
[1:05:55] church
[1:05:57] he covers everything the reason there's
[1:05:59] so much trouble in the church the reason
[1:06:01] there's so much confusion in the church
[1:06:02] there's so much discontentment in the
[1:06:04] church not because jesus is not there
[1:06:07] it's because jesus can't gain access to
[1:06:09] the places he wants to go
[1:06:12] we have those little compartments hold
[1:06:14] on don't touch that you can come in
[1:06:16] that's far enough
[1:06:17] i'll join the church otherwise don't
[1:06:19] tell me how to run my business
[1:06:21] jesus wants to be the supreme ruler of
[1:06:23] your being and the only way he can bless
[1:06:25] you is when he becomes your lord
[1:06:28] lord is rulership
[1:06:30] so he's the creator have no secrets
[1:06:32] before him
[1:06:34] and when jesus comes in that's another
[1:06:35] message he wants to be welcomed
[1:06:38] now if you go over to brother paul's
[1:06:39] house and the door is locked you see him
[1:06:42] in there you knock knock knock and they
[1:06:43] ignore you that's not a welcome is it no
[1:06:47] that doesn't mean you're going to go
[1:06:48] there but you know if you go at least
[1:06:49] take a pie or something you know
[1:06:50] but
[1:06:52] people like to be welcomed
[1:06:54] he says but we got these little secret
[1:06:55] doors little bitty doors in our heart
[1:06:57] that we don't want jesus in there over
[1:07:00] the right-hand side of the human heart
[1:07:01] after jesus gets in it's a little door
[1:07:04] called pride now you can you know
[1:07:07] count this as drama or whatever you want
[1:07:08] but prophet usually knows what he's
[1:07:10] talking about
[1:07:12] a little door called pride oh i'll
[1:07:14] receive a savior but don't tell me what
[1:07:17] i have to do and how i have to dress
[1:07:18] what i have to do if i let it happen you
[1:07:20] know let my hair grow out stop smoking
[1:07:22] cigarettes going to the pool room i
[1:07:24] don't want nothing to do with it
[1:07:26] don't worry he won't stay too long
[1:07:28] you know
[1:07:30] very dangerous you know we do have a
[1:07:31] choice so if he's not lord of all
[1:07:35] he is calling you tonight he's giving
[1:07:37] you another opportunity to get things
[1:07:39] straightened out come to the foot of the
[1:07:41] cross you know we'd be glad to pray with
[1:07:43] you because this can be a turning point
[1:07:45] in your life
[1:07:47] i didn't just happen to come by here you
[1:07:48] know it's kind of out of the way i live
[1:07:50] in tennessee
[1:07:51] but
[1:07:52] if the musicians come up let's sing that

[1:13:21] to enjoy that tonight
[1:13:23] i want to be in his perfect will sons of
[1:13:25] god and daughters of god and have have
[1:13:28] had six thousand years now
[1:13:31] 6 000 years to look back
[1:13:33] and see believers as examples to us
[1:13:36] where they get out of the will of god
[1:13:39] and some people are like jonah that
[1:13:41] actually pay the fee to head the other
[1:13:43] direction some of you are like that
[1:13:46] but other ones like you brought out
[1:13:47] tonight they just start to wander a
[1:13:50] little bit we just wander
[1:13:52] and uh we can get ourselves in the
[1:13:54] permissive little god we get ourselves
[1:13:55] in our own will and we just wandered
[1:13:57] just a little bit
[1:13:58] but after all these six thousand years
[1:14:01] and seeing men
[1:14:02] get off track and not will we're at a
[1:14:04] stage now with sons of god and humility
[1:14:07] say i don't want to even be in your
[1:14:10] permissive will lord
[1:14:12] i really want your perfect will the
[1:14:14] three things he gave us tonight he never
[1:14:16] works outside of the word and his spirit
[1:14:19] so if we wander a little bit from the
[1:14:21] word or we wander from his presence or
[1:14:23] we wonder from those things that we know
[1:14:26] can show us as will
[1:14:28] people make the will of god so
[1:14:29] mysterious what's the will of god but
[1:14:31] it's simplicity it's real simplicity
[1:14:33] stay in the word stay near the spirit
[1:14:36] say where god's speaking stay in that
[1:14:37] channel and everything that you need to
[1:14:40] know give it time be neutral wait upon
[1:14:43] the lord he will show you his path it'll
[1:14:45] become clear in front of you so that you
[1:14:48] can wall when we get hasty
[1:14:50] when we make decisions too hastily when
[1:14:52] we do all this that's where we get good
[1:14:54] off track
[1:14:55] the more time you can give something the
[1:14:57] more time you can give it
[1:14:59] god's greatest asset
[1:15:01] to show his will
[1:15:03] is time
[1:15:04] we give him time in prayer and stay in
[1:15:07] the word
[1:15:08] he wants to show his sons his perfect
[1:15:12] will
[1:15:13] he wants to show it to you we just got
[1:15:15] to stay on track amen brother george we
