[23:52] all my life you have been so
[23:56] so
[23:59] [music]
[24:02] that I am able. [music]
[24:07] I will see. [music]
[24:16] Praise the Lord. Good to be in the house
[24:19] of the Lord this morning to worship the
[24:20] Lord.
[24:22] Amen. [applause] Praise the Lord.
[24:25] Hallelujah. We're grateful for the Lord
[24:28] to offer this thanksgiving and spend the
[24:30] day together and worship him. [music]
[24:32] And I don't have the time this morning.
[24:33] Usually I read a little bit of the
[24:35] Thanksgiving story so everybody knows
[24:37] why we have these freedoms and the
[24:39] purpose of our uh founding fathers and
[24:43] and many of the ones that come over to
[24:45] to uh come for religious freedom.
[24:48] [music]
[24:48] And so thankfully today for the most
[24:51] part here at least in this church we can
[24:54] lift our hands and worship the Lord
[24:56] freely and we should be thankful for
[24:57] that. Can you say amen? We don't have
[24:59] restrictions for that. I know [music]
[25:01] that may change someday, but we still
[25:03] have it. We should not take it for
[25:05] granted that we can come and worship
[25:06] according to the dictates of our own
[25:08] heart. And that's what [music] they come
[25:09] over for to get rid of get away from the
[25:11] religious persecution and also the the
[25:14] bondage that was put on by uh basically
[25:17] denominational systems. And that's what
[25:18] it happens many times. I don't think
[25:20] there should be any restrictions on our
[25:22] worship to serve the Lord with all of
[25:24] our hearts. And uh if there is
[25:26] restrictions today that the devil's
[25:28] putting on you, just say, "Lord, remove
[25:30] all of th that slavery and whatever it
[25:32] is that's those restrictions so that I
[25:35] could be a free man and woman in
[25:36] Christ." Praise be to God. So I don't
[25:39] have time to read the Thanksgiving story

[31:13] the worst and best. [music] You never
[31:16] left me alone.
[31:18] You're always right beside me. You hear
[31:22] me when I pray. [music] And since I
[31:26] first [singing] began, you've been my
[31:27] dearest friend. How many can say that
[31:29] this morning? A friend that [music]
[31:31] sticks closer than a brother.
[31:33] Hallelujah.
[31:34] Thanks.
[31:36] Thanks. Oh, [singing] I give you. Let's

[32:17] I [music] can't forget that moment in my
[32:21] life. You made such a change. [music]
[32:24] Since the spirit came, I've not been the
[32:26] same. I want to give you all [music] the
[32:29] praise.
[32:33] Thanks.
[32:35] Thanks.
[32:37] I give [music] you thanks
[32:40] for [singing] all
[32:42] you
[32:44] done.
[32:46] [music]
[32:48] I am so blessed.
[32:50] My soul is [music] found.
[32:54] Oh Lord,
[32:56] I give you thanks. [singing]
[33:00] [music]
[33:01] Amen.
[33:04] [applause and music]
[33:06] Father, Praise the Lord. Thank you,
[33:09] Father. Praise the Lord. They say that a
[33:12] thankful and a grateful heart.
[33:16] Not too many people with that have
[33:17] depression.
[33:19] Not too many people with that get angry,
[33:22] overly angry. And it's because you're
[33:25] grateful. You're really thankful for
[33:28] what God has given you. It's easy to
[33:29] look at what's bad and what's wrong in
[33:32] you and the other person. It's a lot
[33:34] harder to look at the blessings that you
[33:36] have and look at the good that God's
[33:38] blessed you with. And you, you people
[33:40] are a blessed people this morning.
[33:43] &gt;&gt; You are blessed above measure. Can you
[33:45] say amen? It's easy to look at all the
[33:47] things and maybe you feel like life has
[33:49] handed you the wrong stuff. But God can
[33:52] give you a new start. God can give you a
[33:54] complete new slate and God can uh
[33:57] redeem. That's what he's in the business
[33:58] of doing is redeeming souls of men. And
[34:01] that we appreciate being under that
[34:03] power this morning of redemption. We're
[34:05] glad to have brother Jeremy with us. We
[34:07] want to invite him right away. Not
[34:08] delay. Uh Friday night he talked to the
[34:10] young people about the enemy trying to
[34:13] make our house a haunted house. this
[34:15] house. And I thought it was interesting
[34:16] because we've been preaching on the
[34:17] temple of God, our temple of the Lord
[34:20] becoming a powerhouse for God and our
[34:22] temple being cleansed. But Satan does
[34:24] not want you to be a temple of God. He
[34:26] wants you to be a haunted house. And he
[34:28] talked about a haunted house is tied to
[34:32] for our house is tied to thoughts that
[34:34] we have to scare us, to haunt us,
[34:36] thoughts from the past. Thoughts that
[34:38] there's something still there. And
[34:40] sometimes it's not even there. But
[34:41] thoughts can haunt us from the past.
[34:44] [music] And God wants us to have our
[34:46] houses clear of that. He certainly
[34:47] doesn't want us to be a haunted house
[34:49] that's haunted by thoughts of the past.
[34:51] [music]
[34:52] He wants us to have thoughts that are of
[34:55] him. And we actually can direct our
[34:57] thinking. The Bible says think on the
[34:59] think on these things. Whatsoever is
[35:00] lovely, whatsoever is pure, whatsoever
[35:03] good report, think on these things. So
[35:05] that tells us we have the power to be
[35:07] able to direct our thoughts instead of
[35:10] Satan taking over our thoughts. That was
[35:12] a summary of Friday night. Thank you.
[35:15] That was a summary of Friday night. You
[35:17] didn't get to hear it, but it was
[35:18] wonderful. And Saturday, uh, last night
[35:21] was so wonderful talking about the
[35:23] difference in an an infirmity and the
[35:26] brokenness and the pain. And God can
[35:29] heal all brokenness in marriages. God
[35:31] can heal all brokenness. [music] And
[35:33] those of us who were there was a great
[35:35] blessing to hear those things. And I
[35:37] know we're introducing for the first
[35:38] time, but I know he'll be a blessing to
[35:40] you, Brother Jeremy, and his gift this
[35:41] morning. So, we want him to come. Let's
[35:43] sing it again. And uh we're glad to be
[35:46] able to enjoy the day together. Enjoy
[35:47] the Lord. And uh you be listening
[35:49] because it's not just men speaking. It's
[35:52] the Lord trying to say something to you.
[35:55] It really is. If you look at it that
[35:57] way, God can really say things to anchor
[35:59] in your heart this morning. The past can
[36:01] be washed away. God can give you a new
[36:03] slate. He's He's in the business of
[36:06] giving us a new start. Thanks.
[36:09] Thanks.
[36:11] I give you [singing] thanks for all
[36:17] you've done. [singing]
[36:20] Oh, I am so [music] blessed
[36:27] you.
[36:28] Oh Lord,
[36:31] I give you [music] thanks.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Sing it one more time now. Oh, thanks.
[36:38] Thanks. I give you [music] thanks
[36:43] for all [singing]
[36:46] you done.
[36:49] Are you blessed?
[36:51] I am [music and singing] so blessed. So
[36:53] blessed. My soul has found rest.
[36:57] [music and singing] Oh Lord,
[37:00] I give you thanks.
[37:03] Amen. [music] Let's pray together. Lord,
[37:05] as we come before you, we're thankful to
[37:07] be in this building together. And Lord,
[37:10] where we know your presence is here. And
[37:13] Father, we know that you you're you're
[37:14] with us wherever we go. But there's
[37:16] nothing like coming together with
[37:18] brothers and sisters of like precious
[37:20] faith [music]
[37:20] where we can bind together. No matter
[37:22] what the battle is or the struggle is,
[37:24] you know what it is.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; [music]
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Whoever is ministering the word, Father.
[37:28] Lord, you know, God, one title, but you
[37:31] can speak to every heart in some way.
[37:34] May our hearts be open to you this
[37:36] morning. We pray, God, I ask that you
[37:39] would just give me strength and wisdom,
[37:40] Father, as we surrender our thoughts to
[37:43] you now. And God, that everything would
[37:45] be done for your glory and your glory
[37:46] alone. [music] We just love you and
[37:48] praise you for it all in Jesus name.
[37:51] Amen. Amen. God bless you. You can be
[37:53] seated. We're going to sing a song
[37:55] together. I I think that's a common
[37:58] thing here, right?
[38:00] &gt;&gt; So, it's it's good to So, this song that
[38:02] I've been singing, I guess we'll switch
[38:04] mics.
[38:07] Testing this song that we're going to
[38:09] try to sing together. I've loved to sing
[38:12] since I was a child and it's always
[38:14] meant something to me [music] and and I
[38:18] struggle to go places and you like, what
[38:20] what song can you sing? Because we sing
[38:21] them all, right? But this song I
[38:23] couldn't get away from for the last uh
[38:25] week and I asked brother Paul and and
[38:29] &gt;&gt; yes, thank you. I can't even remember my
[38:31] own name this morning, Sister Sharon, to
[38:33] sing with us. So, we practice it a
[38:34] couple times and we'll practice it with
[38:36] you this morning. But I pray that it'll
[38:37] be a blessing to you. Amen. God bless
[38:40] you this morning.
[38:46] As little children, we [music] would
[38:48] dream of Christmas morning
[38:52] of all the gifts [music] and toys we
[38:56] knew
[38:58] we'd find.
[39:00] But we never realized a baby born
[39:04] [singing] one blessed night
[39:09] gave us the greatest gift [music]
[39:13] of
[39:15] our lives. [singing]
[39:18] [music]
[39:19] &gt;&gt; We were the reason
[39:22] [singing] that he gave his life.
[39:27] We are [singing] the reason [music]
[39:30] that he suffered and [singing] died
[39:35] to a [music] world that was lost. He
[39:39] gave all he [music] could [singing] give
[39:44] to show us the reason [music]
[39:47] to live. [singing]
[39:56] As the years went by, we learned
[39:58] [singing and music]
[39:59] more about gifts
[40:02] and the giving of [singing] ourselves
[40:06] and what
[40:08] that means. On a dark and cloudy day,
[40:13] [music]
[40:13] a man hung crying [singing] in the rain.
[40:19] All
[40:21] because of [music and singing] love. All
[40:24] because
[40:25] of love.
[40:28] [music] And we are the reason [singing]
[40:32] that he gave his life.
[40:37] We are the reason [music]
[40:39] [singing] that he suffered and died
[40:44] to [music] a world [singing] that was
[40:47] lost. He gave all he [music] could give.
[40:53] She show us [singing] the [music] reason
[40:56] to live.
[40:59] Oh, [singing and music]
[41:00] I finally found a reason for living.
[41:05] [singing]
[41:07] [music]
[41:08] It's in giving
[41:10] every [singing] heart of my heart to
[41:14] you. [music]
[41:17] And in all [singing] that I do, every
[41:20] [music]
[41:21] word that I say, I'll [singing] be
[41:25] giving [music] my all just
[41:30] for him. [singing]
[41:33] [music] We are the reason
[41:37] that he [music] gave life.
[41:42] We are the reason [singing] that he
[41:46] suffered [music] and died
[41:49] to the world that was lost. He gave
[41:53] [singing] all he [music]
[41:57] to show
[42:01] to
[42:05] [music]
[42:05] a world that was [singing] lost. He gave
[42:09] all here [music] again
[42:13] to show us the reason [music]
[42:16] to live.
[42:22] He is my reason [singing]
[42:25] to
[42:27] live.
[42:31] Aren't you thankful for that?
[42:32] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[42:35] Lord. Thank you, [music] God. [applause]
[42:39] Hallelujah.
[42:41] He is our reason. If you came here this
[42:44] morning wondering what your reason is,
[42:46] you know it's him. Thankful for the
[42:50] people next to us, but he is our reason
[42:53] this morning. Amen. If we could, we'll
[42:55] just dive into this this morning. We
[42:58] could stand together.
[43:01] 1 Chronicles chapter 13. Again, it's
[43:03] good to be here this morning and to uh
[43:07] meet you from afar.
[43:10] I I am who I am and I try to stay that
[43:13] way. I try not to be like anybody else
[43:17] and then uh I say, "Thank you, Lord, for
[43:19] that." I hear a lot that my ministry is
[43:21] unique. Sometimes I don't know how to
[43:23] take that,
[43:25] but as long as he's working through it
[43:27] and and he gets the glory for it, then
[43:29] that's what matters. But it's good to be
[43:31] here this morning. my first time ever in
[43:33] Michigan and and uh I just appreciate
[43:35] the kindred spirit that we have with
[43:37] brother Paul and and his wife and now
[43:40] meet meeting each and every one of you.
[43:43] Uh let's read verse 13. 1 Chronicles
[43:46] chapter 13.
[43:49] We begin reading at verse number one
[43:52] says, "And David consulted with the
[43:54] captains of thousands and hundreds and
[43:57] with every leader. And David said unto
[44:00] all the congregation of Israel, if it
[44:02] seemed good unto you, and that it be of
[44:05] the Lord our God, let us send abroad
[44:07] unto our brethren everywhere that are
[44:10] left in all the land of Israel, and with
[44:12] them also to the priests and Levites,
[44:14] which are in their cities and suburbs,
[44:17] that they may gather themselves unto us.
[44:20] And let us bring again the ark of our
[44:23] God to us. For we inquired not at it in
[44:27] the days of Saul, and all the
[44:29] congregation said that they would do so,
[44:32] for the thing was right in the eyes of
[44:36] all the people. Could we just pray one
[44:38] more time? Lord, as your presence is
[44:41] here, we ask again that you would deal
[44:43] with every heart in a special way. As
[44:46] again, we are surrendered to you now. We
[44:48] love you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[44:52] you. You can have your seats.
[44:55] This is an interesting title and I say
[44:57] don't shut me down yet. Our title this
[45:00] morning is an is called error in a true
[45:03] revelation.
[45:05] Error in a true revelation. And I pray
[45:07] that by the end of this the Lord will
[45:09] have given us encouragement along the
[45:11] way. So our question is as we build this
[45:14] and we take the time to build this this
[45:16] morning and we won't hold you too long
[45:18] is why was the ark lost in the first
[45:20] place? Why was it lost in the first
[45:22] place? And we want to go to 1st Samuel.
[45:24] And I'm going to just go go through
[45:25] these quickly as I can and and uh to try
[45:28] to save time. 1st Samuel chapter 4 verse
[45:31] one. And I'm going to read a few verses
[45:33] here. And it says, "And the word of
[45:34] Samuel came to all Israel." Says, "Now
[45:36] Israel went out against the Philistines
[45:38] to battle and pitched besides Ebenezer
[45:41] and the Philistines pitched in Aph. And
[45:43] the Philistines put themselves in array
[45:46] against Israel. And when they joined
[45:48] battle, Israel was smitten before the
[45:50] Philistines. For they slew of the army
[45:53] in the field about 4,000 men.
[45:56] [clears throat]
[45:57] Interesting thought there. And when the
[45:59] people were come into the camp, the
[46:01] elders of Israel said, "Wherefore hath
[46:03] the Lord smitten us today before the
[46:05] Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the
[46:10] covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto
[46:12] us, that when it cometh among us, it may
[46:15] save us out of the hand of our enemies."
[46:18] And I want to start with this question.
[46:19] What had the ark become?
[46:22] What had the ark become? Had the word
[46:24] become something only needed in a
[46:27] crisis.
[46:28] You see, or in a sense, our prayers can
[46:32] turn into what seems like a cosmic
[46:33] vending machine to where God, our
[46:36] prayers only turn into something as in,
[46:37] oh God, I only need you now. We're going
[46:40] to go out. We're going to try to do
[46:41] this, but then let's go fetch the ark.
[46:43] This is what it had become. and and then
[46:46] and and and and then ask and you shall
[46:48] receive mindset. You know what I'm
[46:49] saying? Ask and you shall receive and
[46:51] with lack of revelation of actually what
[46:54] does that mean? Let us just fetch the
[46:56] ark. That great pledge of God's presence
[46:59] and help by whose conduct our ancestors
[47:02] obtain success. That's what this is
[47:04] actually saying. It's like so because
[47:06] it's happened before, right? We know the
[47:08] quote Hebrews 13:8, right? And it's and
[47:11] it's used all the time and we know it's
[47:12] the truth, right? The ark was is the
[47:15] truth. It's the true act presence of God
[47:17] in their midst. But instead of humbling
[47:20] themselves and purging themselves from
[47:23] their sin for which God was displeased
[47:25] with them, they take an easier and
[47:28] cheaper course and put their trust in
[47:30] their ceremonial observances. Right? If
[47:34] we're not careful, Sunday becomes a
[47:36] ceremonial observance. Not doubting, but
[47:39] the very presence of the ark would give
[47:42] them victory. They knew, hey, man, we're
[47:43] we're the message. We've got the word.
[47:45] The word is open. And and we know that
[47:47] with the very word of God in our midst,
[47:49] man, things are going to happen. And and
[47:51] it just became this this, hey, let's
[47:53] just fetch it.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, God, help us not to be that way,
[47:58] right? So the people sent to Shiloh that
[48:00] they might bring from then the ark of
[48:02] the covenant of the Lord of hosts, which
[48:04] dwelleth between the cherubams, and the
[48:06] two sons of Eli, Hoffne, and Phineas
[48:09] were there with the ark of the covenant
[48:11] of God. And when the ark of the covenant
[48:13] of the Lord came into the camp, what did
[48:16] Israel do? Shouted with a great shout,
[48:19] right? So that the earth rang again.
[48:23] Now, why did they do this? Because the
[48:25] ark was in their midst. Because the word
[48:28] was there. So the word was in the camp
[48:31] as before. Then the shout came. Why?
[48:33] Because the word was there. Then we go
[48:36] to the other side of the spectrum to and
[48:37] when the Philistines heard the noise of
[48:39] the shout they said what meanth the
[48:42] noise of the great shout in the camp of
[48:44] the Hebrews. I mean remember they had
[48:46] already destroyed a lot of Israelites
[48:48] right and they understood now notice
[48:51] that that's key word they understood
[48:54] that the ark of the Lord was come into
[48:58] the camp. So even the enemy knew the ark
[49:02] is there, right? And the Philistines
[49:05] were afraid because the word was in
[49:08] their midst. For they said, "God is
[49:12] coming." They said, they were
[49:14] testifying, "God is come into the camp."
[49:18] And they said, "Woe unto us, for there
[49:21] hath not been such a thing hereto for.
[49:24] Woe unto us. Who shall deliver us out of
[49:27] the hand of these mighty gods? These are
[49:31] the gods that smokeote the Egyptians
[49:33] with all the plagues in the Hey, they
[49:35] had a testimony service.
[49:38] [laughter]
[49:39] They were testifying about what was
[49:42] going on. I mean, we're what's going on
[49:44] here? But then verse 9 comes in and so
[49:47] they they testify of the very things
[49:49] that God had done. But then they come to
[49:52] themselves like, "Hey, hey, be strong.
[49:54] Quit yourselves like men. Be a man. Come
[49:57] on. You're a soldier. You're You're a
[49:59] Philistine. You've already done this.
[50:01] You've already destroyed some of their
[50:02] lives. I'm throwing this in there, but I
[50:04] hope you understand. Oh, you Philistines
[50:06] that you be not servants unto the
[50:08] Hebrews as they have been to you. Quit
[50:11] yourselves like men and fight. And the
[50:14] Philistines fought. And Israel was
[50:17] smitten.
[50:19] And they fled every man into his tent.
[50:22] And there was a very great slaughter for
[50:26] there fell of Israel 30,000. So now
[50:29] we're at 34,000
[50:31] men
[50:33] that died. 4,000 before the ark was
[50:36] fetched and 30,000
[50:40] after the ark was in their midst.
[50:44] I I want this to be in my heart. I don't
[50:46] I want this to sink in all of our lives.
[50:48] And the ark of God was then taken and
[50:51] the two sons of Eli Hoffne and Phineas
[50:54] were slain. Let me ask you a question.
[50:56] Why would the church lose with the word
[50:59] of God in their midst?
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Why was it Israel's constant idolatry
[51:08] and sins would lead them to lose the
[51:11] very presence of God?
[51:15] &gt;&gt; Here again lies the information issue.
[51:18] to the issue of thinking themselves as
[51:20] something because they had the ark.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Right? Listen, if you're we're nothing
[51:25] without God, right?
[51:27] &gt;&gt; But they thought of themselves as
[51:29] something because they shouted when they
[51:30] fetched the ark. So the ark is now in
[51:32] their midst. We have the word. Hey man,
[51:34] we've got the word. The word is open to
[51:36] us and it's in our midst. We know we're
[51:38] the happening church. We're the
[51:39] happening place. and and a shout begins
[51:41] to come up and all of a sudden people
[51:43] start dying
[51:45] &gt;&gt; with the word in the midst.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; This reminds me of Samson. I'll just
[51:50] quote it. Judges 16:20. And he and she
[51:52] said, "The Philistines be upon thee,
[51:54] Samson." And what did he do? And he
[51:56] awoke out of his sleep and said, "I will
[52:00] go out as other times before
[52:04] and shake myself." And he ws not that
[52:08] the Lord was departed from him. I know.
[52:10] Happy Thanksgiving service.
[52:15] We'll get there.
[52:17] As the word was in their midst, signs
[52:19] and wonders so much that even the
[52:22] Philistines were testifying about it.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, what? Why is the shout this is going
[52:27] on? And and they but they would still
[52:30] lose the ark because of their constant
[52:33] dissatisfaction.
[52:36] constant dissatisfaction. Listen, the
[52:39] Holy Ghost is not here was never meant
[52:42] to make your life comfortable.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; If if if we're only in church to try to
[52:47] make our life comfortable, to make our
[52:50] life feel better, we're in it for the
[52:51] wrong reasons.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; No. If the Holy Ghost is to be a
[52:54] comfort, that means you'd only need
[52:57] comfort for one reason.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; You're going to be going through
[53:00] something. You're going to be going
[53:02] through some trials and tests and
[53:03] sorrows. So, so the the Bible gives us
[53:06] plenty ex examples of why we need the
[53:09] Holy Spirit in our life is because we
[53:11] need that comfort. You see the but I I
[53:13] want to say this. If only a believer
[53:16] would just be a believer. If only Israel
[53:18] would just be Israel, what God had
[53:20] called him to be. And if only we as
[53:22] believers would be what we are supposed
[53:24] to be, to trust and to follow and to be
[53:28] satisfied with his presence and to be
[53:30] satisfied with his word in our midst. if
[53:32] we would only do it without trying to
[53:34] seek for something more outside of the
[53:37] line that God has given us where the
[53:39] prophet said, "Get back in line." Oh, I
[53:41] know I've said this so many times, but
[53:43] it it just strikes me, brother Paul,
[53:45] that that when the prophet cried out,
[53:47] "Get back in line." You know that it
[53:50] doesn't say that she turned around and
[53:52] said, "What do you mean?
[53:55] I I I'm the I'm the I'm the bride. I'm
[53:58] the message." You know, like a, you
[54:00] know, like we act sometimes with God
[54:03] &gt;&gt; when the word's coming forth. Who told
[54:05] you?
[54:06] &gt;&gt; No, she got back in line. She got back
[54:09] in step in step with the word. See, the
[54:12] word do I want to say this. The word
[54:14] will do no good for them.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; It's not meant for them. Thank God for
[54:20] salvation. Hallelujah. But the ark
[54:22] belongs in one place
[54:24] &gt;&gt; to people that will respect it.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:28] What did it do? What did the ark do for
[54:30] the Philistines? It caused them disease.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Man, they got rid of it as fast as they
[54:36] could.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; We're done with this
[54:39] &gt;&gt; because it wasn't meant for them. They
[54:41] couldn't handle it. See, you cannot hold
[54:43] to to your traditions and expect the ark
[54:46] to work for you. Their traditions were
[54:48] more important. So, they kicked the word
[54:50] out.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Hello. Where are we at? What What age
[54:56] are we dealing with here? They kicked
[54:58] the word out. Why? It's not meant for
[54:59] them. It's meant for Come on. I don't
[55:02] want to say you yet. I want you to say
[55:04] it for yourself. But it's not an
[55:06] arrogance. Oh, God help us. So, trying
[55:10] to move through this quickly. The ark
[55:11] was then returned to Israel. Right.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; But it wasn't returned to its rightful
[55:16] place.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; And I like this and I already quoted it,
[55:20] but I want to say it again when brother
[55:21] Brandon mentioned this in the church age
[55:23] book. I wonder if we're sufficiently
[55:24] impressed with the word in our midst.
[55:26] Because when we're not sufficiently
[55:28] impressed with it, we're going to always
[55:30] try to seek for more.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; You know what? What happened in the very
[55:34] beginning? Brother Paul, this really
[55:37] this really encourages me. But what what
[55:39] was it that caused the people to ask
[55:43] what how can we get this? The word says
[55:46] they were pricricked in their hearts by
[55:48] what? the word that was being preached,
[55:52] you know, and so and a lot of times we
[55:54] want to skip to the word, skip beyond
[55:56] the word and just get to the emotions of
[55:58] it. But you've got to get through the
[56:00] word first. You've got to get the word.
[56:02] It's got to prick your heart to change
[56:03] you. I want to say this. It wasn't the
[56:06] ark's fault that over 30,000 died.
[56:09] That's right.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; And we cannot say that we've tried it
[56:14] all with the word in our midst while
[56:17] also idolatry is still there.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times you can you can have
[56:23] idols without having idols,
[56:25] &gt;&gt; you know, because you know, we're
[56:26] message believers, right? We don't have
[56:28] idols.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; You know, we were born and raised no
[56:31] idols and then we our own we are our own
[56:34] idol.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sometimes if we're not careful, we
[56:38] we carry that sovereignty far part too
[56:42] far.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; My home is sovereign.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; I'm sovereign.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; That's not in my notes. I should move
[56:51] forward.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; But if we're not careful, that's what we
[56:54] do. And we make our own lives an idol,
[56:58] &gt;&gt; right? We want We want to parade how
[57:00] good we are.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; We put our own selves on parade. Isn't
[57:04] that amazing how that works?
[57:06] All right.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; No, we're to clear it all up.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; So, the word should be handled with care
[57:12] and compassion,
[57:14] not in a manner of pride or arrogance.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; The ark was lost after 34,000 total men
[57:20] died in two battles. And again, the ark
[57:23] was never meant to be handled by
[57:25] non-elect
[57:27] and thus was quickly returned and dwelt
[57:31] in uh Kith Jerham, I think, is where
[57:33] it's at. And the ark had now been
[57:35] brought back to Israel, but it was not
[57:37] where it should be. And it seemed to
[57:39] have become nothing more than a relic.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Just think about that.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; So we see through disobedience Saul was
[57:51] removed and it was now David's
[57:53] leadership. He had come in and now the
[57:56] Bible shows and I want to build up
[57:58] David. The Bible shows David as a man
[58:01] after God's heart. Right?
[58:03] 1st Samuel 13:14. But now the kingdom
[58:06] shall not continue. The Lord hath sought
[58:08] him a man after his own heart.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; And the Lord hath commanded him to be
[58:14] captain over his people, because thou
[58:16] hast not kept that which the Lord
[58:18] commanded thee. So here the Bible says
[58:20] it. David was a man after his own heart.
[58:24] So after this, David being who he was
[58:27] and we're skipping through a lot of
[58:28] things, but he immediately sought after
[58:30] the ark because he knew it should not be
[58:33] where it's at.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; We need it back. He says, "We need the
[58:36] word. We need the ark back." And I'm
[58:38] mixing two different things here. We
[58:40] need the word back, right? We need it
[58:42] back in our midst. It should be at our
[58:44] forefront. It should be in the center of
[58:45] every service. It should be in its
[58:47] belonging it in the places where it
[58:49] belongs. And we're going to go through
[58:51] some quotes here in trying to do God a
[58:53] service without being his will. Says,
[58:56] notice here in our text, notice David,
[58:58] king of Israel, he was the one who got
[59:00] the revelation of bringing the ark of
[59:03] God back to his place.
[59:06] See, uh uh that they never consulted in
[59:08] the days of Saul cuz Saul had backslid.
[59:11] So they never consulted the ark at all,
[59:14] the covenant in the days of Saul because
[59:16] he had backslid and got away from God.
[59:18] So David quickly with inspiration, now
[59:21] notice this. It's a very treacherous
[59:23] text if you don't get it right. Notice
[59:26] David, king of Israel, the king had been
[59:29] freshly anointed the king or elected
[59:31] king. Samuel anointed him by the will of
[59:33] God. I love this. I'm going to drive
[59:35] this point. He was absolutely God's
[59:37] chosen king. No doubt about it. And here
[59:41] he is. And inspiration strikes him. It
[59:44] was revealed to David. He got the
[59:46] revelation. Nobody else had said nothing
[59:48] about it. Let us go and fetch the ark
[59:50] cuz that's the will of God that we have
[59:52] the ark here with us that we consult God
[59:55] by this ark. Very gallant thing. Brother
[59:58] Brandon says, don't you think so? So
[1:00:00] let's drive this point. Let's look at
[1:00:02] this. He was called of God, right? He
[1:00:04] was anointed king, man after God's own
[1:00:06] heart. We type of Christ in warrior for
[1:00:09] God, giant slayer, anointed musician,
[1:00:11] and many other things. What are you
[1:00:14] saying, brother Jeremy? He was of God.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; But
[1:00:22] [snorts] remember, brother Bren, I'm
[1:00:23] continuing here. But him being king and
[1:00:26] got the revelation,
[1:00:28] he overstepped his place.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; See, there was a prophet in the land by
[1:00:33] the name of Nathan. He was the one that
[1:00:35] was ordained to get the revelation. Said
[1:00:37] there's anything to be spoke. He said,
[1:00:38] "The Lord doeth nothing until he reveals
[1:00:41] it to his servants, the prophet." That's
[1:00:43] right.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; But you see David being king with the
[1:00:46] anointing upon him
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; says now is that the scripture he's
[1:00:50] asking this question. I'm asking you.
[1:00:51] Isn't that scripture?
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; He was anointed
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; with the anointing upon him. He got a
[1:00:57] true revelation
[1:00:59] but it was wrong.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; I want that to be I want that to really
[1:01:04] sink in. It was a true revelation but it
[1:01:07] was wrong.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; You see there was a change sweeping
[1:01:11] through Israel. Right.
[1:01:13] This is exciting times. We got a new
[1:01:15] king. We got the guy. And we're going to
[1:01:18] bring the ark back. And it's time to
[1:01:19] bring it back. We have the guy to do it.
[1:01:21] This is the happening place. This is the
[1:01:23] happening church. We got the preacher.
[1:01:25] We got the preachers. We got the
[1:01:26] evangelists. We've got this. It's the
[1:01:28] happening thing, right? It's moving
[1:01:31] through the land. This is why we must be
[1:01:33] careful not to follow just after
[1:01:36] enthusiasm
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; because even feeling led. I get scared
[1:01:41] sometimes as a pastor when I hear the
[1:01:43] word I'm feeling led
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; because I'm really wondering what kind
[1:01:48] of lead are you feeling.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Right. Good point. Whe whether you like
[1:01:54] it or not, it's a good point.
[1:01:57] But even feeling led in hearts,
[1:02:01] many many have been destroyed.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; We need to make sure that we have
[1:02:07] followed the details first.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Then let the enthusiasm follow it.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; See, just as signs and wonders, what did
[1:02:14] the Bible are to follow and do not lead
[1:02:18] the believer. What why did we get to a
[1:02:19] point where we wanted the signs and
[1:02:21] wonders to lead us
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; when they are to actually follow us? We
[1:02:25] are to be led by the word of God, right?
[1:02:27] That's what we are to do. And so, we
[1:02:30] want that to be in our lives. I'm not
[1:02:31] against those signs and wonders because
[1:02:33] I've had them in my own life. I could
[1:02:34] take your entire day with the things
[1:02:37] that God has done just for my life and
[1:02:39] my wife and my family and my church of
[1:02:41] the things that God has done. But I want
[1:02:43] to just say this, that's not what holds
[1:02:45] me.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; It's the word that catches our
[1:02:48] attention. It's the voice. It's the cry
[1:02:51] that we hear that said, "There's
[1:02:52] something about that that's telling me
[1:02:54] why I shouldn't be in this condition."
[1:02:56] It's those things that do it. Then after
[1:02:58] that, then God begins to show himself in
[1:03:00] wonderful signs and wonders. What if God
[1:03:02] never did anything like that for you
[1:03:04] again? Would you still serve him?
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; It's a good question to ask
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; because a lot of times we want to make a
[1:03:11] deal with God.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; God, if you'll do this, then I'll do
[1:03:13] this. Right? We It's like It's like
[1:03:15] we're striking a deal with God. That's
[1:03:17] not what the Bible never said. Hey,
[1:03:18] strike a deal with me.
[1:03:20] No, trust me. Follow me.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; He said, you got to be willing to take
[1:03:24] up your cross. I don't know if you know
[1:03:26] this or not, but the cross is a sign of
[1:03:29] suffering.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; All right, let's think about this. So,
[1:03:36] now there's some excitement going on,
[1:03:37] right? The word is coming back. Here
[1:03:40] comes the ark.
[1:03:42] But notice, brother Brandham says who
[1:03:43] David consulted.
[1:03:45] Here in the 13th chapter, he said, "But
[1:03:47] he consulted the captains of thousands
[1:03:50] and of hundreds back to his
[1:03:51] congregation." See, said, "Now, don't
[1:03:54] you think we should do this?" And oh, he
[1:03:56] said, "But that isn't it." Now, he was
[1:03:58] trying to do God a service, but he
[1:04:01] wasn't ordained to do it. See, cuz God
[1:04:05] had his way. Well, let's read it. Uh 1st
[1:04:07] Chronicles 13:1 says, "And David
[1:04:09] consulted with the captains of thousands
[1:04:11] and hundreds and with every leader. And
[1:04:13] David said unto all the congregation of
[1:04:15] Israel, if it seemed good unto you that
[1:04:17] it be of the Lord our God, let us send
[1:04:20] abroad unto our brethren everywhere that
[1:04:22] are left in all the land of Israel, and
[1:04:24] with them also to the priests, and the
[1:04:25] Levites, which are in the cities and
[1:04:28] suburbs, that they may gather them
[1:04:29] themselves unto us. Oh, here's this.
[1:04:32] Here's the powerful scripture. And let
[1:04:34] us bring again the ark of our God to us.
[1:04:37] That's true.
[1:04:40] It needs to be in its rightful place.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; For we inquired not add it in the days
[1:04:47] of Saul and all the congregation said
[1:04:50] that they would do so. For the thing was
[1:04:52] right in the eyes of all the people.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Even in anointing, even in the calling,
[1:05:00] even in the true revelation, even in
[1:05:02] inspiration,
[1:05:04] we can find ourselves in error.
[1:05:07] This is why we must always stay true to
[1:05:11] the word of God.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; I will lead you. I will guide you.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Listen, it's not about that's why that's
[1:05:19] why brother Paul doesn't come and
[1:05:20] consult you every service and say, "Hey,
[1:05:22] what do y'all think we should do every
[1:05:24] time? How do you want me to preach?
[1:05:25] Should we do I mean, he might say, "What
[1:05:27] do y'all want to eat?"
[1:05:29] That's okay. But when it comes down to
[1:05:31] it, it's not always going to be the
[1:05:32] sermon that you think it's going to be
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; or any other minister that's here. or
[1:05:36] the ministries that are in this church.
[1:05:37] It's not always going to be what what
[1:05:39] fits our fancy and it shouldn't. Again,
[1:05:42] it's not about making us feel
[1:05:44] comfortable. I believe every service
[1:05:45] should have a challenge of some sort.
[1:05:48] That doesn't mean that we crack the whip
[1:05:49] every service and and I I'm not I'm not
[1:05:52] for those things. I'm for true
[1:05:55] challenging ministries. That's why
[1:05:58] that's why your pastor doesn't do that.
[1:06:00] That's why other true pastors doesn't do
[1:06:02] that. We want to do what God's will is
[1:06:05] because we're not here to just create a
[1:06:07] hype.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; We want the word in our midst, but we
[1:06:11] want it right. We want a balance to it.
[1:06:14] We want to care for it. We want to You
[1:06:15] say, "Care for it?" Yes, we want to care
[1:06:17] for it. We want to hold it dear to our
[1:06:20] hearts. It's it's more than just, "Hey,
[1:06:22] look at me. I've got this and I've done
[1:06:24] this." No, it's all God.
[1:06:28] Even when it's not popular,
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; and even when you lose friends
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; and you lose family,
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; it doesn't matter. You've got to be
[1:06:38] willing to forsake all
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; and follow Christ.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; And I know it's hard because I'm dealing
[1:06:45] with humanity. And I know it's hard to
[1:06:47] not have that friend in your life and to
[1:06:49] not have that family member. And I've
[1:06:51] dealt with with my own church who have
[1:06:53] lost their their mother or their father
[1:06:55] who has walked away or has cursed them
[1:06:57] even myself uh uh brother Paul where I I
[1:07:00] I haven't been able to speak to some of
[1:07:02] my family for years just because there
[1:07:05] was so much hatred
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; and it just got to a point I just want
[1:07:10] to be family
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; but sometimes you can't
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; because the enemy won't let it. So, it's
[1:07:19] going to test us. Will we be able to
[1:07:21] make the stand?
[1:07:25] Let's join David's camp, right? Let's do
[1:07:27] this. This is where the word is coming
[1:07:28] back. And the people rejoiced because it
[1:07:30] was the happening thing. So, here,
[1:07:33] brother Brandham continues. So, you see
[1:07:35] David being inspired. Now, you remember
[1:07:37] I said the anointing and he said the
[1:07:39] false anointing question. Remember, the
[1:07:41] Holy Spirit can come and anoint a person
[1:07:44] and it's still out of the will of God.
[1:07:49] Man, listen. I I want to say this. This
[1:07:51] is stirring for me.
[1:07:54] My grandfather always told me. He said,
[1:07:55] "Jeremy, just as soon as you think
[1:07:57] you're somebody, God will come and pull
[1:07:58] the rug out from underneath you."
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; And that's a true story.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to even go further with
[1:08:04] it. And probably y'all have heard me say
[1:08:06] this before, too. And this is just me
[1:08:08] being me. Listen. So, I've always
[1:08:10] thought, Brother Paul, if if God could
[1:08:11] use a donkey
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; to catch somebody's attention, what does
[1:08:16] that make me?
[1:08:18] God will use whatever vessel he will.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; And I can tell you this is I standing
[1:08:24] here before you that there have been
[1:08:25] times that I I probably shouldn't have
[1:08:28] been standing behind here,
[1:08:30] but it was my time to do so. And I gave
[1:08:33] my heart to God to do so, but God still
[1:08:35] use me. And I you know when I always
[1:08:37] knew something really wasn't right in my
[1:08:40] life, it was the crash after the sermon.
[1:08:45] We're always going to come down,
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; right? Because we're not always It's the
[1:08:49] same in the service.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; You ever see somebody, don't look at
[1:08:53] anybody, but you ever seen, you know, we
[1:08:56] have a wonderful powerful service and
[1:08:58] and crying and tears and all kinds of
[1:09:00] things and it's just wonderful and a
[1:09:02] great atmosphere and then people walk
[1:09:04] out after that and they come from that
[1:09:06] to hear and you don't even want to talk
[1:09:09] to them. They have the sour look on
[1:09:12] their face and they're like, I've just
[1:09:13] been in the presence of the Lord.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Listen, you're not where you should be.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; I understand we don't live up here, but
[1:09:22] from here to here, that's not where we
[1:09:25] should be. And sometimes God allows us
[1:09:26] to feel the presence just to show you
[1:09:29] where you really are.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; All right, let's continue here. says now
[1:09:35] you remember I said that anointing says
[1:09:37] it uh and still if it's out of the will
[1:09:40] of God here it proves it right see we
[1:09:42] have to go through God's way of doing it
[1:09:44] not our ways God's way of doing it
[1:09:46] because David being a king anointed
[1:09:48] anointed with the spirit of God upon him
[1:09:50] a type of Jesus Christ but that wasn't
[1:09:53] God's channel when all the congregation
[1:09:57] it pleased them the Bible said notice
[1:09:59] captains of thousands of hundreds the
[1:10:01] priests theologians thought it was
[1:10:04] wonderful There's your Bible schools and
[1:10:06] everything else that thought it was
[1:10:07] wonderful. Even all the people agreed
[1:10:09] and the priests and all of them agreed
[1:10:12] that the king's anointing was right.
[1:10:15] Notice, but God had not promised to
[1:10:18] reveal his word in its season to them.
[1:10:22] God his way of revealing his word. Uh uh
[1:10:25] I'm sorry. God had his way of revealing
[1:10:27] his word, but not to them. It wasn't
[1:10:30] through that David. Remember, it was
[1:10:33] contrary to God. Because if we go this
[1:10:36] route, if we're not careful, it just
[1:10:37] becomes simply about our church.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Our idea.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Hey, we are the church, right?
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; It's a spirit in the land.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; It truly is a spirit in the land. And
[1:10:47] it's not just a spirit out there. It can
[1:10:48] be a spirit in our ranks that we are the
[1:10:51] church.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; We are the camp. We are the one,
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; right? And that's not what God intended
[1:10:56] it to be. And we're not careful. We come
[1:10:58] back to the Corinthian church ministry.
[1:11:01] 1 Corinthians 3:3, for ye are yet
[1:11:03] carnal. Not y'all, but you know. For
[1:11:06] whereas there is among you envying and
[1:11:08] strife, I'm sure this doesn't happen,
[1:11:09] brother Paul. And divisions, are ye not
[1:11:12] carnal, and walk as men?
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; For while one saith, I'm of Paul, and
[1:11:17] another, I'm of Apollos, are ye not
[1:11:19] carnal?
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Who then is Paul?
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; And who is Apollos? But ministers by
[1:11:28] whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave
[1:11:31] to every man
[1:11:33] I have planted, Apollo swattered, but
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; God
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; gave the increase. So, it's not about
[1:11:41] one man.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to even say it's not just
[1:11:45] about uh uh uh William Brandham, but it
[1:11:47] was God through him.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; That's what caught my attention was the
[1:11:52] word through the prophet. Listen, it I'm
[1:11:55] thankful uh uh it wasn't even about my
[1:11:57] grandfather, though I'm thankful that I
[1:11:59] come up under that leadership. It was
[1:12:01] God that led him to speak the word to
[1:12:03] me.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; So neither is he that planteth anything,
[1:12:07] neither he that waterth, but God that
[1:12:09] giveth the increase. Let's skip down to
[1:12:12] verse 21. Therefore, let no man glory in
[1:12:15] men. [clears throat]
[1:12:17] For all things are yours, whether Paul
[1:12:19] or Apollos or Keus or or the world or
[1:12:22] life or death or things present or
[1:12:24] things to come, all are yours. And ye
[1:12:26] are
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Christ. Say, I'm Christ.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Say it like you mean it. I'm Christ.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; And Christ is God. So here we go. In a
[1:12:37] true and honest zeal for the word
[1:12:40] because that's what David had. David
[1:12:42] truly, I believe his heart was right. He
[1:12:46] wanted the word, the ark back where it
[1:12:49] belonged. We should have that desire for
[1:12:51] our homes. We should have that desire
[1:12:54] for our churches. And I want to say
[1:12:55] this, it's not just up to the pastor to
[1:12:58] desire the word in the church, though it
[1:13:00] is from him. It should be us in a
[1:13:02] unified body that desires the ark in the
[1:13:05] midst. Not in the corner, but in the
[1:13:07] midst. Not only when we want to fetch it
[1:13:09] when we're in trouble, but in our midst.
[1:13:12] But here he had a true honest zeal for
[1:13:14] the word of God and error came and when
[1:13:17] error came because of his zeal because
[1:13:19] he went beyond what he was supposed to
[1:13:20] do. You know the story but I'm going to
[1:13:22] read it. Let's go to chapter 13 of 1
[1:13:25] Chronicles
[1:13:27] verse 7. says, "And they carried the ark
[1:13:29] of God in a new cart
[1:13:32] out of the house of Abinadab and Oza and
[1:13:35] Ao drove the cart and David and all of
[1:13:38] Israel played before God and with notice
[1:13:41] with all their might listen they I can't
[1:13:45] drive this home so much they were so
[1:13:48] truly excited. I don't believe brother
[1:13:51] Paul it was a carnal excitement. I
[1:13:52] believe they were truly excited because
[1:13:55] the word was coming back. The ark was
[1:13:58] coming back. And the Bible tells us that
[1:14:00] they played with all of their might and
[1:14:03] with singing and with harps and with
[1:14:04] sulties and with timberls and with
[1:14:06] symbols and with trumpets. And when they
[1:14:08] came unto the threshing floor of of
[1:14:10] Chiden Oza put forth his hand to hold
[1:14:14] the ark, another man that desired the
[1:14:17] right thing.
[1:14:19] For the oxen stumbled, and the anger of
[1:14:22] the Lord was kindled against Oza, and he
[1:14:25] smote him because he put his hand to the
[1:14:28] ark. Therefore, he died before God.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; And again, continuing the quote here, no
[1:14:37] matter how much your anointing is,
[1:14:40] you've got to get in God's provided
[1:14:44] position.
[1:14:46] David's anointing was all right, he
[1:14:48] says, but in doing it, he got enthused
[1:14:51] and stepped over the boundary line.
[1:14:53] Listen, we and I I I I can't I'm not
[1:14:55] going to speak for brother Paul or any
[1:14:56] other minister. We have to be careful
[1:14:57] ourselves in ministries that we don't
[1:15:00] become enthused, so enthused that we're
[1:15:03] caught up with with ideas and and
[1:15:06] movements and things. Even though we can
[1:15:10] see mighty miracles happening,
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; I want to make sure that I keep my eyes
[1:15:16] on where God wants me
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; and my purpose of my life and my purpose
[1:15:20] for my church and what God See, God
[1:15:23] might be dealing with you differently in
[1:15:25] this area. It's the same word, same arc,
[1:15:27] but God might be dealing with you
[1:15:28] differently here and then God is using
[1:15:31] me in my church, you know, the same way
[1:15:33] or differently over here. But because
[1:15:35] it's it it's everybody is so tied
[1:15:38] together now. And I don't want to say
[1:15:41] why, but we're tied together now. It's
[1:15:43] like we all have to do the same thing.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; And if you don't do what I do, you're
[1:15:47] not in it.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; And because of that, we're enthused and
[1:15:52] and we step over our bounds. And I'm not
[1:15:54] saying that they don't have a heart for
[1:15:56] God.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to dec uh how do you call
[1:16:00] it? Decchristian them or Christianify,
[1:16:03] whatever you want to call it. put your
[1:16:05] own word there. I don't want to do that
[1:16:07] to them. I don't want to do that to
[1:16:09] anybody. But I want to say we've got to
[1:16:11] be careful that we don't follow after
[1:16:13] the enthusiasm because here what David
[1:16:16] did being anointed of God, true king,
[1:16:19] prophet, everything that you could say
[1:16:21] David was. And now he caused death.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; He stepped over the boundary line. And
[1:16:26] instead of putting the ark in its
[1:16:28] original position, he carried it on a
[1:16:29] new cart
[1:16:31] and not over the hearts
[1:16:34] of the Levites.
[1:16:36] It was supposed to be carried on the
[1:16:38] shoulder of the Levites, which is over
[1:16:41] the heart.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; The word is not in the mind.
[1:16:46] It's in the heart.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; When we lose our heart, because we're so
[1:16:51] caught up in enthusiasm and excitement,
[1:16:54] I'm for that. Listen, I want you to
[1:16:55] understand in the balance here, you're
[1:16:58] looking at somebody that loves
[1:16:59] enthusiasm and loves excitement and
[1:17:02] loves worship and all of those things.
[1:17:04] But if I lose my heart because I'm
[1:17:08] looking for the next big excitement.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Listen, why did this not affect the
[1:17:13] Philistines?
[1:17:15] Because it wasn't given to them.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; They didn't have to obey the word like
[1:17:20] you do. Right.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand that because
[1:17:24] you think about it. They carried it on
[1:17:25] and no one died in that sense. See, this
[1:17:28] was not a law given to them.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; This is why we cannot compare other
[1:17:32] churches, other people, other
[1:17:34] denominations, other situations because
[1:17:37] you're held accountable for the word
[1:17:39] that has been open to you in this hour.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; It's been given to the elect. This is
[1:17:44] how we should this is him saying this is
[1:17:46] how you should carry my word. So I
[1:17:49] cannot look at the religious world and
[1:17:50] expect it to work the same for us,
[1:17:53] right? However that church is doing,
[1:17:55] maybe the the church across the street
[1:17:56] or the church over here, it however it's
[1:17:59] working for them, they can come in and
[1:18:00] the rain falls on the just and the
[1:18:02] unjust. There's worship. There's
[1:18:03] excitement. There's all of those things.
[1:18:05] But God has called us, you and us, you
[1:18:08] and I, to carry the word over our
[1:18:11] hearts.
[1:18:14] God requires his elect lady to love his
[1:18:17] word enough
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; to follow through.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; It's because we are accountable.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not a guy that says a lot of
[1:18:27] repeating, but I want you to say this.
[1:18:28] You can even in your heart. I'm
[1:18:29] accountable.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; I'm accountable because I want I want
[1:18:33] you to understand God has confidence
[1:18:36] in his word in your life.
[1:18:40] Here we go. Notice notice by doing this
[1:18:43] he caused the death. Oh this this hurts
[1:18:47] of a sincere man
[1:18:49] putting his hand on the ark when he
[1:18:51] shouldn't have done it. A great sincere
[1:18:54] man think the anointing and everything
[1:18:56] was just right but the ark was moving in
[1:18:58] its wrong way. The Bible uh the oxen the
[1:19:02] Bible said stumbled not the Levites. The
[1:19:04] oxen stumbled and the cart was being
[1:19:05] pitched over. And a sincere man with his
[1:19:08] heart full of love put his hand upon the
[1:19:11] ark to hold it back and was stricken
[1:19:13] dead because no man could touch the ark
[1:19:15] but a Levite.
[1:19:18] See how God keeps his word, keeps his
[1:19:20] channel, keeps his order. Uzziah was
[1:19:22] smitten with leprosy. Here is David
[1:19:26] altogether caused the death of a man and
[1:19:29] a great disaster being anointed with the
[1:19:32] spirit both of them but out of God's
[1:19:35] channel.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; So here is where we see the true
[1:19:39] anointing of David. This is where we see
[1:19:41] who David was brother Paul. He was an
[1:19:44] error
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; and he caused the death,
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; but he did not keep digging a pit
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; to try to lift himself up.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm king and it is what it is and
[1:19:58] I'm anointed. No, David was a man of
[1:20:02] repentance.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; And he went right back to the word. He
[1:20:06] went right back. What was I supposed to
[1:20:08] do? Listen, this tr this shows who you
[1:20:11] really are. When you realize, I am an
[1:20:14] error. I might need to fix something in
[1:20:15] my home or I might need to fix something
[1:20:17] this and and and and sometimes we think
[1:20:19] of it as big things and becomes
[1:20:21] overwhelming in our life. And when it
[1:20:22] becomes overwhelming, we don't do it
[1:20:24] right.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; It's like that project you've been
[1:20:26] putting off for so long because it seems
[1:20:29] overwhelming, but all you got to do is
[1:20:31] start and it will get done. And
[1:20:33] sometimes the enemy wants to make the
[1:20:35] corrections in our lives seem
[1:20:36] impossible. But go back to the word. Go
[1:20:40] back to it and it'll correct you and
[1:20:41] it'll bring you right and it'll should
[1:20:42] bring us to as believers to repentance.
[1:20:45] Oh God, I was wrong and and I and and I
[1:20:48] allowed this in my home and he was a man
[1:20:50] of repentance and he went right back to
[1:20:51] the word. And I would believe perhaps
[1:20:53] brother Paul that he went and spent some
[1:20:55] time with the prophet
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; to get that word in order. Amen.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; I want I want to remind you we should
[1:21:04] keep listening
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; to what the message is saying.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we need to go back. Well,
[1:21:10] I've listened to that. How many times
[1:21:11] have we listened to doing God a service,
[1:21:14] right? And every time we go back,
[1:21:16] brothers and sisters, we catch something
[1:21:18] else and we catch something. Brother
[1:21:20] Paul might be preaching on love a
[1:21:21] thousand times. And you're like, "You
[1:21:22] going to preach on love again?" Yeah.
[1:21:23] Until we start to love.
[1:21:26] I guarantee you if we can just get it
[1:21:28] through our thick heads. I don't know if
[1:21:29] that's a good thing to say here. It's
[1:21:31] okay in Texas. But
[1:21:33] if we can just get it that that God
[1:21:35] wants us to to not just look for the big
[1:21:37] things, but simply loving one another,
[1:21:40] showing that love and and believing the
[1:21:42] word and trusting the word and living
[1:21:44] the word, not living law, not living
[1:21:47] legalism, but living the word. [snorts]
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; So I believe that he spent time with the
[1:21:52] prophet. I believe he spent time. What
[1:21:53] did I do wrong? Where did I go wrong
[1:21:56] here? Now it's time to bring it back.
[1:21:58] Verse 15:1. And David made him houses in
[1:22:02] the city of David and prepared a place
[1:22:05] for the ark of God and pitched for it a
[1:22:08] tent. Then David sent none. Here it is.
[1:22:11] Then David said,"None ought to carry the
[1:22:13] ark of God but the Levites."
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Thank God for a man of God
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; that brings correction to his own
[1:22:21] mistake. Amen.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; So now what he's doing, he's speaking
[1:22:24] the word.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; For them hath the Lord chosen to carry
[1:22:29] the ark of God and to minister unto him
[1:22:32] forever. Now we can see as the word of
[1:22:34] God was brought in its true form, there
[1:22:37] was sanctification in the church. God
[1:22:40] will bring sanctification again through
[1:22:42] the church. The church will have to go
[1:22:44] through season and it'll go through
[1:22:46] times where you will feel like I I I
[1:22:49] just feel like it's I'm always getting
[1:22:50] sanctified and I'm I'm always getting
[1:22:52] this. But it's a season that we go
[1:22:54] through to try to bring correction in
[1:22:56] our lives. And because listen, brothers
[1:22:58] and sisters, I don't want to go all the
[1:23:00] way to the end and miss it on one little
[1:23:02] tiny error.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; And I know I can tell you, God's not
[1:23:06] going to let me in because of who I am
[1:23:08] if I miss out one part of it. I need to
[1:23:11] trust his word of God and live it with
[1:23:13] all of my life.
[1:23:15] [snorts] Once David went from fear
[1:23:17] because remember he went into fear
[1:23:20] and repentance. I like this. He went
[1:23:23] from fear and repentance and then he
[1:23:25] went to full worship mode.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on. You can't you can't
[1:23:31] lay in that past all your life.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; It's time to shake yourself. get back
[1:23:36] into the word of God and come out of
[1:23:37] those things and get back to worship,
[1:23:40] but don't get to worship until you get
[1:23:41] the word right.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; And as the ark of the Lord came into the
[1:23:46] city of David, uh Mikall uh uh Saul's
[1:23:49] daughter looked through a window and saw
[1:23:51] King David leaping and dancing before
[1:23:53] the Lord and she despised him in her
[1:23:55] heart. I mean, here we go again.
[1:23:58] I mean, we [snorts] can't work. Moving
[1:24:00] on. Verse 20. Then David returned to
[1:24:04] bless his household. And Mikuel, the
[1:24:06] daughter of Saul, came out to meet David
[1:24:08] and said, "How glorious." Oh, you know,
[1:24:11] this was not uh you know, this was a
[1:24:13] little bit of a chastening
[1:24:16] from someone who didn't know who God
[1:24:18] was.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; How glorious was the king of Israel
[1:24:22] today. Can you just hear that? Snarky.
[1:24:27] who uncovered himself today in the eyes
[1:24:30] of the handmmaids and his servants. You
[1:24:32] were I mean you are a fool, right?
[1:24:37] As one of the vain fellows shamelessly
[1:24:40] uncoverth himself.
[1:24:42] And David said unto me,
[1:24:45] it was before the Lord
[1:24:48] who chose me
[1:24:51] before thy father
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; and before all his house to appoint me
[1:24:56] ruler. See, now he had something to back
[1:24:59] it up.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Now he's getting right back to what
[1:25:04] happened and the word of God. And to
[1:25:06] appoint me ruler over the people of the
[1:25:08] Lord, over Israel. Therefore will I play
[1:25:10] before the Lord. I ain't doing it for
[1:25:13] you.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; That's why when we sing, we're not
[1:25:15] singing for you.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; We're singing for the Lord. When we
[1:25:19] worship, we're not worshiping for you.
[1:25:21] We're worshiping for the Lord.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; And I will yet
[1:25:30] pretty this is pretty potent right here.
[1:25:32] And I will yet be more vile than thus,
[1:25:34] and will be base in mine own sight. and
[1:25:37] of the maid servants which thou has
[1:25:38] spoken of them shall I be had in honor.
[1:25:42] Therefore, Mika, the daughter of Saul,
[1:25:44] had no child until the day of her death.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Listen, she could not produce life
[1:25:52] because she criticized the move of God.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Don't don't if listen, I want to just
[1:26:02] say this. If we if we find ourselves not
[1:26:04] producing life, we need to look back and
[1:26:07] say, "Lord, what have I said?
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; What have I done?"
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; And move back. Repent of it, right? Go
[1:26:14] to the place you did. And God will give
[1:26:16] you that life. But you've got to bring
[1:26:18] correction. She did not bring forth life
[1:26:21] because of what she said.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; So, we must be careful that we do not
[1:26:26] criticize the move of God and the joy
[1:26:29] that are in the churches.
[1:26:32] Because there's death on both sides of
[1:26:33] this thought.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; We got people throwing stones at other
[1:26:37] people. Right.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Right. It's always seems to be happening
[1:26:41] because one person thinks that we we we
[1:26:44] uh sing too much. We got too much joy.
[1:26:46] Listen, brother Paul, if they knew what
[1:26:48] God did for me, they would have the joy
[1:26:50] that I would have in my heart. Listen,
[1:26:52] and it's more than just a a toetapping
[1:26:54] song. This is a change song. This is a
[1:26:57] life that has been changed by God. If
[1:26:59] you knew what God did for me, you would
[1:27:02] understand why I'm here today, right?
[1:27:04] Oh, I love that. Don't you? You would
[1:27:06] say the same to me because God, it is
[1:27:08] God that has brought you out of darkness
[1:27:10] into his marvelous light. What we need
[1:27:13] is a full revealing of the love of God.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Because we were not just called back to
[1:27:19] the gifts or justification or
[1:27:21] sanctification.
[1:27:23] With all that we have in the church,
[1:27:25] what is it that we need the most? with
[1:27:27] all of the things that we have. 1
[1:27:29] Corinthians 12:31 says, "But covet
[1:27:31] earnestly the best gifts, and yet show I
[1:27:34] unto you a more excellent way." I I I I
[1:27:38] held off a lot of scriptures here for
[1:27:40] the sake of time. I don't know where we
[1:27:41] are, but we're getting close. Verse 13
[1:27:44] of chapter 13. And now abideth faith,
[1:27:47] hope, charity, these three, but the
[1:27:49] greatest of these is charity.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Notice the prophet of God in our day.
[1:27:56] Think about this in in a in our days of
[1:28:00] greatest the greatest moments, the
[1:28:01] opening of the word, the seals open, the
[1:28:03] mighty God power of God revealing. And
[1:28:06] yet see what he says here in standing in
[1:28:09] the gap.
[1:28:11] He says, "And these Rickys and Ricettas
[1:28:13] that have so sassed the word said, "And
[1:28:16] I've called them Ricky and Ricetta, but
[1:28:18] God give me to understand I shouldn't do
[1:28:20] that."
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; That's right. because that's many of
[1:28:24] them are still his children.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; They can't help because they act
[1:28:31] so much different. And I'm going to skip
[1:28:33] down now. He says, "And I wanted to
[1:28:35] bring this to you so that you would see
[1:28:38] and show you the mistake that a man can
[1:28:40] make yet
[1:28:44] being sincere."
[1:28:46] Moses lost his feeling of his people
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; because they wouldn't listen to him. And
[1:28:53] now I cannot go with a ministry like
[1:28:56] that until I feel different in my heart
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; about it. No matter if God did tell me
[1:29:02] something's got to change me. The
[1:29:05] prophet of God said this, "Something's
[1:29:07] got to change me because I in my heart,
[1:29:10] if I go out there feeling the way I do
[1:29:12] now, I still feel that I ought to have
[1:29:15] uh that they ought to have heard that
[1:29:17] message. They ought to have done it. And
[1:29:20] I don't have the feeling for the people
[1:29:22] that I should have. Until I get that
[1:29:25] feeling, there is no need in me going
[1:29:29] because I'd be a hypocrite."
[1:29:33] He said he needed a little change.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Could I say God help us to come to that?
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Help me Lord as a pastor
[1:29:43] to not lose the feeling of my people.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Help me as a father
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; to not lose the feeling for my own
[1:29:51] family.
[1:29:53] We get so so tied in knots and so worn
[1:29:56] down and tired and we get so and I get
[1:29:59] it because who's not in life, right?
[1:30:02] That we could we can lose the feeling
[1:30:04] for our spouse, for our children because
[1:30:08] we just we just they just don't
[1:30:10] understand what I'm going through. And
[1:30:12] if they would only listen. And here the
[1:30:14] prophet of God said, "I I can't I can't
[1:30:16] go out and do that.
[1:30:18] I need my heart changed."
[1:30:21] And I want to say this, if he said it,
[1:30:24] we are not too good to say the same.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; God, we need a change in our heart. I
[1:30:28] need a change in my heart. I don't want
[1:30:29] to lose the feeling. I don't want to
[1:30:31] just go through the motions. I just
[1:30:32] we've got, you know, we've got to do
[1:30:33] this and we've got to do this and and
[1:30:34] and and and then forget the heart of the
[1:30:38] matter.
[1:30:40] Continue. He says, "Now surely after all
[1:30:42] these years on the field and around the
[1:30:43] world and seeing different people, I
[1:30:46] ought to know a little bit about the
[1:30:47] gate to enter in at." He says, "And if
[1:30:50] you want to get somewhere with God,
[1:30:52] never let an arrogant spirit ever come
[1:30:55] around you.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Don't let no malice come in. No matter
[1:30:59] what anybody does, if they're wrong,
[1:31:01] don't you never build up a complex
[1:31:04] against that person.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; You be sweet and kind. Remember, God
[1:31:10] loved you. Oh,
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; when you were in sin.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; And if the spirit of God is in you, you
[1:31:18] love the other person when he's wrong.
[1:31:21] See, just pray for them and love one
[1:31:23] another. But what we want to do is we
[1:31:25] want to we have to prove that they're
[1:31:26] wrong and that I'm right. But that's not
[1:31:28] what God's saying.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Let God do it. Remember,
[1:31:34] I'm not the savior of my family. He is.
[1:31:37] I'm not the savior of the church. He is.
[1:31:40] I'm just a vessel that he will use.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Above everything, love God and love one
[1:31:46] another and be humble with God and
[1:31:47] around one another and God will bless
[1:31:49] us. And it's hard telling what he will
[1:31:51] do. Usually when a church begins to get
[1:31:54] in numbers and getting to a little
[1:31:56] bigger or something like that, they get
[1:31:58] away from that real thing. And I want to
[1:31:59] say I feel love here. I feel the heart.
[1:32:01] And I thank God for that that you feel
[1:32:04] those things. and and and and and it's
[1:32:06] been wonderful to minister you because I
[1:32:07] feel a pull and a desire for the word of
[1:32:09] God. But I know even in that there's
[1:32:11] hurting hearts
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; and we've seen perhaps error in
[1:32:16] revelation and it's brought confusion in
[1:32:18] our minds and it's made us lose trust
[1:32:20] and it's made us lose confidence. But
[1:32:22] God is still on his throne and God will
[1:32:25] not lose one of his. He won't lose you.
[1:32:28] He won't lose uh uh any one of his. And
[1:32:30] so I hold to that. But I don't have a
[1:32:32] confidence in listen I don't have
[1:32:34] confidence in myself. I have confidence
[1:32:36] in his calling and in his election for
[1:32:38] my life. You don't have confidence in
[1:32:40] yourself but you have confidence in his
[1:32:42] calling for you.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; There's no power in pride
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; because p pride seeks constant
[1:32:49] recognition
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; and if no recognition then we begin to
[1:32:53] force the issue and there's no godly
[1:32:55] power in that.
[1:32:57] [snorts]
[1:32:58] you stay humble and be that little
[1:33:01] humble elect lady
[1:33:05] ministered a sermon years ago lady in
[1:33:06] waiting and just just the thought of her
[1:33:10] she he said I'm going to come back for
[1:33:11] you and let them mock around her let
[1:33:14] them say what they're going to say
[1:33:16] around her but you stay that humble
[1:33:18] little lady you do your things you do
[1:33:21] your chores you do your life all while
[1:33:25] listening to the word of God and stay
[1:33:27] humble
[1:33:28] and they're going to come and they're
[1:33:29] going to mock you and they're going to
[1:33:30] say things and it's going to hurt and
[1:33:31] it's going to break your heart and
[1:33:33] there's going to be error all around
[1:33:35] you, but you stay focused on his words.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Remove all the error in true revelation.
[1:33:46] Stay humble.
[1:33:49] I think it might be good for us sometime
[1:33:51] perhaps you've listened to it this week
[1:33:52] but the humility
[1:33:55] the sermon humility is it was it titled
[1:33:58] humility I think it was I think it's a
[1:34:00] really short one but it's a beautiful
[1:34:03] one all of them are beautiful but
[1:34:05] there's just something about going back
[1:34:06] and being reminded God help me to stay
[1:34:08] humble
[1:34:10] I want to stay humble let's bow our
[1:34:12] heads musicians can come
[1:34:14] Lord Jesus
[1:34:17] Lord I ask that you'd forgive me, Lord,
[1:34:18] if I said anything out of the way, but
[1:34:21] may your presence, Lord, that is here
[1:34:23] and working in our hearts,
[1:34:26] Lord. All we want is our heart to be in
[1:34:29] line with you. Lord, I I don't want to
[1:34:33] to come to a a place in a position where
[1:34:36] I'm having to prove anything. Lord, I
[1:34:38] just want to stay in your word. And God,
[1:34:40] if I've gotten an error before, if I if
[1:34:42] I've messed up, Lord, and let me be let
[1:34:46] me be the bride to come and say, "Lord,
[1:34:50] I'm sorry. I want to stay in line with
[1:34:53] you."
[1:34:54] That's how I can be thankful is because
[1:34:56] when I keep trying to to prove
[1:34:58] something, I I lose my thankfulness. I
[1:35:01] lose thanksgiving.
[1:35:03] But Lord, when I can just simply come
[1:35:05] back and know that my heart is open to
[1:35:07] you and nothing's in the way and
[1:35:09] everything's open and free,
[1:35:12] Lord, then you can deal with me. And if
[1:35:13] there's something in my life, Lord, or
[1:35:15] in our lives that's wrong, maybe we've
[1:35:18] lost the feeling of our family. Maybe
[1:35:21] we've lost the feeling of of a church
[1:35:23] service. Maybe we've been hurt and
[1:35:25] broken. Whatever it is, Father, Lord,
[1:35:28] you're here this morning and you're
[1:35:29] willing, Lord. You've already given us
[1:35:32] healing. We We just got to step into it.
[1:35:37] May we come this morning in your
[1:35:40] presence
[1:35:41] and see what you can do, Lord. I'm not
[1:35:45] looking for as it were mighty miracles
[1:35:48] Lord and say this this Lord but just the
[1:35:50] simpleness sometimes of a still small
[1:35:53] voice
[1:35:55] in our hearts
[1:35:58] church I want to just say this as our
[1:36:00] heads are still bowed
[1:36:02] can you hear his voice in your heart
[1:36:06] there's a song in word of God speak I
[1:36:10] love that song but it says I'm finding
[1:36:12] myself in the midst of you.
[1:36:16] Beyond the music, beyond the noise and
[1:36:21] all that I need
[1:36:23] is to be with you.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; And in the quiet,
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; I hear your voice. Why is that
[1:36:30] important? Because there's so much noise
[1:36:33] going on around us. So much noise.
[1:36:39] And it's trying to grab at our
[1:36:41] attention. is the the the bills, the
[1:36:44] debts, the the sicknesses, the the
[1:36:46] [music] job questions, the the children,
[1:36:49] the the spouse, all of these things is
[1:36:52] just grabbing at our attention, and we
[1:36:56] lose our desire. We lose our enthusiasm.
[1:36:58] We come to church, we go through the
[1:37:00] motions, but all he wants you to do
[1:37:01] right now, can you find yourself in the
[1:37:04] midst of his word?
[1:37:07] Would you have an honest heart this
[1:37:09] morning? We're going to sing this, but I
[1:37:10] don't want this to just be a song that
[1:37:13] we sing and oh, it's good.
[1:37:16] But I want this to be a message. I want
[1:37:19] you to find yourself before we turn it
[1:37:21] to brother Paul. I want you to find
[1:37:23] yourself
[1:37:25] in his presence and see what he has to
[1:37:29] say for you.
[1:37:31] And what is it, Lord? Lord, whatever it
[1:37:33] is, whatever it is you have for me, I
[1:37:35] want to I want to do it, Lord. Would can
[1:37:37] you have that open heart
[1:37:39] as your heads are are bowed? If you want
[1:37:42] to say, "Lord, I have something. I have
[1:37:43] a need. Brother Jeremy doesn't know, but
[1:37:46] you know, and I want to give it to you
[1:37:47] this morning. [music] I maybe it's my
[1:37:49] heart just needs to be refreshed. Maybe
[1:37:51] I just need that humbleness.
[1:37:55] God, you're doing what only you can do."
[1:37:58] And it's that simple. Because not
[1:38:00] Jeremy, not brother Paul, not brother
[1:38:02] Rap, not not brother uh Brandon, nobody,
[1:38:05] but God speaks
[1:38:09] and he pricks your heart. [music]
[1:38:11] It's the word that pricks it.
[1:38:14] Could we stand together and worship now?
[1:38:18] What? [music] Kiran, brother,
[1:38:21] can you do B for me? Yeah.
[1:38:25] I'm finding myself
[1:38:30] at a loss
[1:38:32] for [music and singing] words.
[1:38:35] And the funny thing is
[1:38:39] it's okay.
[1:38:42] The [music] last thing I need [singing]
[1:38:47] is to
[1:38:49] be heard. Here it is. Bun
[1:38:52] [music and singing] to hear.
[1:38:54] Oh, what you would say. [music] Word
[1:38:59] [singing] of God speak.
[1:39:02] Would you pour down like [singing] rain?
[1:39:07] Washing [music] my eyes to see
[1:39:12] your majesty
[1:39:15] to be [music] still [singing] and know
[1:39:19] that you're in this place. Here it is.
[1:39:24] Please [music] let me stay and rest
[1:39:28] in your holiness. [singing]
[1:39:32] Word of God speak. [music] Can you find
[1:39:35] yourself here now? I'm finding myself
[1:39:40] Lord in the midst [singing] of you.
[1:39:45] Beyond the music. Oh yes Lord. be on
[1:39:50] [music and singing] the noise.
[1:39:52] And all that I need, [music]
[1:39:56] oh, [singing]
[1:39:57] is to be with you. Yes, Lord. And in the
[1:40:03] quiet, [music] Lord,
[1:40:05] yes, I hear your voice, [singing]
[1:40:09] the word of God speak. [music]
[1:40:12] Would you pour down like [singing] rain,
[1:40:17] washing my eyes to see
[1:40:20] [music and singing]
[1:40:22] your majesty
[1:40:25] to be [singing] still and know [music]
[1:40:29] that you're in this [singing] place.
[1:40:34] Please let me stay [singing]
[1:40:36] and rest [music]
[1:40:38] in your home. Sing it again now. The
[1:40:41] [singing] word of God speak.
[1:40:45] Would you pour down [singing] like
[1:40:47] [music] rain?
[1:40:50] Washing my eyes to see
[1:40:54] your majesty.
[1:40:58] To be [music and singing] still and know
[1:41:02] that you're in this [music] place.
[1:41:06] Please let me stay [singing]
[1:41:09] and rest [music]
[1:41:11] in your holiness.
[1:41:15] Word of God [music]
[1:41:16] speak.
[1:41:19] Hallelujah.
[1:41:21] When he is in our midst, things change,
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; right? Aren't you glad for that change?
[1:41:28] [music] Please don't don't just leave
[1:41:30] this place this morning under the normal
[1:41:33] circumstances.
[1:41:36] Make sure that God has affected your
[1:41:38] heart.
[1:41:39] That's our [music] purpose of being here
[1:41:42] because we want God to move more than
[1:41:44] anything else. We want him to move. And
[1:41:47] I want to turn to brother Paul, but I
[1:41:48] want to sing one more if that's okay.
[1:41:50] It's a song that I love to sing and we
[1:41:52] [music] might sing it differently.
[1:41:53] That's one thing I've learned about
[1:41:54] churches. You go to different churches
[1:41:55] like we don't sing it that way. But uh
[1:41:58] key of A, I believe, brother, it's my
[1:42:02] desire. I've always loved this song.
[1:42:04] [music] It's my desire
[1:42:11] to live for Jesus.
[1:42:18] It's my
[1:42:21] desire
[1:42:25] to [music and singing] be just like him.
[1:42:30] Though often I failed him. Though
[1:42:33] [music and singing] often I failed him
[1:42:37] and brought him much shame and brought
[1:42:40] him much shame.
[1:42:44] It's my desire. It's [singing] my
[1:42:48] desire
[1:42:52] to live for him. I'm going to sing the
[1:42:56] second verse now. It's [music] my
[1:42:58] desire. It's my desire
[1:43:03] to help [music] someone today.
[1:43:06] To [singing] help someone
[1:43:10] today,
[1:43:11] [music]
[1:43:12] someone who [singing] may have failed
[1:43:17] to see the way, to [music and singing]
[1:43:19] see the way. For I too was once lost. I
[1:43:25] too [singing] was [music] once so lost
[1:43:29] till I found my way to God. Till I found
[1:43:32] [singing] my way to God. It's my [music]
[1:43:36] desire. It's my desire
[1:43:42] [singing]
[1:43:44] to live for him.
[1:43:48] [music and singing] more. If you could
[1:43:49] see, if you could see where Jesus
[1:43:56] brought me from to where I am today.
[1:44:02] [music and singing]
[1:44:03] Oh, then you would know the reason
[1:44:08] [music and singing]
[1:44:09] why I love him. So, do you love [music]
[1:44:14] him now?
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Now you can take [music] this world, all
[1:44:21] its wealth [singing] and riches. [music]
[1:44:26] I don't need earth's fame. It's my
[1:44:31] desire [singing]
[1:44:35] to live [singing]
[1:44:37] for him. Let's sing that chorus one last
[1:44:39] time as we turn it now. Oh, if you
[1:44:43] [music]
[1:44:44] could see where [singing] Jesus brought.
[1:44:48] Hasn't he brought you from a lot to
[1:44:50] where I am today? Oh, [singing] then you
[1:44:56] would know the reason [music]
[1:45:00] why I love him. So
[1:45:05] mean it now. Now you [music] can take
[1:45:10] this world all its wealth [singing]
[1:45:13] and riches. [music]
[1:45:16] I don't need
[1:45:26] to live for him. [singing]
[1:45:32] If you could see [music]
[1:45:36] where Jesus brought me from [music] to
[1:45:41] where I am today,
[1:45:46] you [music] would know
[1:45:49] the reason why
[1:45:52] I love him. [music and singing] soul.
[1:45:58] You can [music and singing] take this
[1:46:02] world.
[1:46:03] Your wealth and riches [music]
[1:46:07] I don't need. It's free. It's my desire
[1:46:17] to live
[1:46:20] in
[1:46:22] just one chorus. I'm coming [singing]
[1:46:25] back to the heart of worship
[1:46:30] and it's all about you.
[1:46:35] It's all about you, Jesus.
[1:46:39] And I'm [music] sorry, Lord, the thing I
[1:46:45] made
[1:46:47] and it's all about you. [music]
[1:46:50] It's [singing]
[1:46:51] all about you.
[1:46:54] I'm coming back. I'm coming back to the
[1:46:59] heart of worship.
[1:47:04] All about you.
[1:47:07] Oh, it's all about you, Jesus.
[1:47:12] And I'm sorry, [singing and music] Lord,
[1:47:14] for the things I made.
[1:47:20] All about [singing and music] you.
[1:47:23] It's all about you, Jesus.
[1:47:29] God bless you today. I couldn't say
[1:47:30] enough about the word of God, how it's
[1:47:33] ministered personally to me this [music]
[1:47:35] weekend and this morning. Um, I guess I
[1:47:39] would I stand amazed. I stand in awe of
[1:47:43] the manner and the discernment that the
[1:47:46] Lord is speaking to sons that [music]
[1:47:49] are called to be adopted sons, called to
[1:47:51] come to maturity. And that never ceases
[1:47:54] to amaze [music] me how personal and how
[1:47:56] accurate God wants us to have stuff. And
[1:47:59] it's not that [music] we make it
[1:48:00] accurate. It's our heart given to him
[1:48:04] that he would make it accurate. to hear
[1:48:05] a service [music] that is so
[1:48:09] uh discerning to say that you could have
[1:48:12] true anointing
[1:48:14] and actually [music] a true revelation
[1:48:16] that the ark is supposed to come back
[1:48:18] and yet there be a margin of air in
[1:48:20] there related to our hearts. It it makes
[1:48:24] me sober to say Lord let my heart be
[1:48:27] aligned with this great word that you've
[1:48:30] given us. Maybe that's why we've had
[1:48:33] some issues [music]
[1:48:33] all some issues some major issues the
[1:48:36] last 60 years since the word has been
[1:48:39] restored to us is maybe this is getting
[1:48:42] down to a simple thing what Jesus said
[1:48:45] we don't want to be that people who
[1:48:48] honors him with our lips but our heart
[1:48:50] is far from him
[1:48:53] and for him to come and speak this way
[1:48:56] and just the manner he's been showing us
[1:48:58] [music] of our our temples and you know,
[1:49:01] um,
[1:49:03] moving us from
[1:49:06] just being anointed
[1:49:09] beyond just an anointing, a temporal
[1:49:11] anointing. And there's nothing wrong in
[1:49:13] ano with an anointing, but moving us as
[1:49:16] sons and daughters beyond just an
[1:49:18] anointing to a heart that's actually
[1:49:21] holding that ark
[1:49:24] inside
[1:49:26] with respect and with reverence and with
[1:49:30] obedience. Maybe that's what we've been
[1:49:32] missing. And I don't know about you, but
[1:49:34] the word is [music] ministering to me in
[1:49:36] such levels that he never has before.
[1:49:37] And I I just lay my life before him. I
[1:49:40] want more love. I want more. I want more
[1:49:42] of his power, but I want the things
[1:49:45] within me that let his power manifest
[1:49:48] [music]
[1:49:48] on its own the way that he wants to
[1:49:50] manifest it. So, we appreciate deeply
[1:49:53] the word of God, Brother Jeremy, this
[1:49:55] morning. We appreciate, you know, God
[1:49:59] can take a man like this through 20, 30
[1:50:02] years. He grew up in the message. God
[1:50:05] can take a man through a whole lifetime
[1:50:07] and maybe years of ministry and trials
[1:50:10] on his own to bring one sermon like this
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; and we all get the benefit of it. God
[1:50:17] can mold things in a man that long to
[1:50:20] bring it this [music] way. And so we
[1:50:22] ought to say, "Thank you, Lord." That's
[1:50:23] the way he does things to bring it just
[1:50:25] this way. That's our God. That's our
[1:50:28] God. [applause]
[1:50:29] Hallelujah.
[1:50:31] Praise the Lord. just um as we I want to
[1:50:34] sing a song before we go because when we
[1:50:36] got to the end of this, David got it
[1:50:38] right and he danced before the Lord and
[1:50:41] uh was criticized for that. We ought to
[1:50:44] be careful when we criticize when
[1:50:45] somebody gets really free and they get
[1:50:48] sanctified
[1:50:50] and they really repent. You see, it's
[1:50:52] not just saying I'm sorry. It's showing
[1:50:53] fruits of repentance, fruits of your
[1:50:55] life being sanctified. That means you've
[1:50:57] really repented. If you repent and you
[1:50:59] go back to the same things, that's not
[1:51:00] repentance. you don't have repentance.
[1:51:02] But when it's really repentance, God's
[1:51:04] sanctifying your lives. And then then
[1:51:07] the real joy comes. Then the real
[1:51:09] enthusiasm comes. And when David got it
[1:51:11] right, he danced. And I want to sing
[1:51:13] that in a minor. It's in a minor.
[1:51:14] Whatever you got there in a minor chord.
[1:51:17] When the spirit of the Lord comes upon
[1:51:19] my heart, I will sing like David sang. I
[1:51:23] will dance like David danced. When you
[1:51:25] exit today, when you dismiss, please go
[1:51:27] out this door so we don't crowd where
[1:51:29] the food's being prepared. go out these
[1:51:31] [music] doors and go around the building
[1:51:32] for our potluck today. If you would do
[1:51:35] that. And then one other announcement
[1:51:37] would [music] you would you please wash
[1:51:39] your own crockotss today so we can keep
[1:51:42] all those lids and everything together.
[1:51:44] Please wash your own crockpot. Don't
[1:51:46] [music] leave it for someone else to do.
[1:51:48] We'd certainly appreciate that. And uh I
[1:51:51] think that is it. Enjoy the fellowship
[1:51:53] today. Enjoy your time together. And uh
[1:51:56] we have been blessed this morning to
[1:51:57] hear the true pure word of God. and and
[1:52:00] I love him so much. I love the Lord what
[1:52:02] he's done. Thank you, Father. Thank you,
[1:52:04] Lord, that you've been a father to me.
[1:52:06] [music] You're a father to sons and
[1:52:09] daughters.
[1:52:11] I sat at the edge of my [music] seat
[1:52:12] today, Lord, shutting everything else
[1:52:14] out. Who's here? Who's not here? There's
[1:52:17] even troubles sometimes that [music]
[1:52:19] burdens on my heart as a pastor. But
[1:52:22] Lord, I just shut it out all out and I
[1:52:24] sit at your feet
[1:52:26] like Mary did, Lord. And and Martha
[1:52:30] rebuked [music] her and said, "You need
[1:52:32] to be do working. You need to be
[1:52:34] serving." And Jesus, you said [music]
[1:52:37] Mary chose the better part just to sit
[1:52:40] and listen to the master. I thank you
[1:52:43] Lord this morning to sit at your feet.
[1:52:46] Teach me, mold me, make me Lord. And
[1:52:50] then Lord, after you've fashioned us the
[1:52:52] way you want us, [music] then the true
[1:52:55] joy and true true fellowship and true
[1:52:58] love and true enthusiasm, true
[1:53:01] enthusiasm, [music]
[1:53:03] it comes, Father,
[1:53:05] because this is not a dead religion.
[1:53:07] [music] This is a resurrected savior. We
[1:53:10] thank you, Father, in Jesus name.
[1:53:12] Everybody said, "Amen." Praise the Lord.
[1:53:14] I love him so you got that song up. When
[1:53:18] the spirit of the Lord comes upon my
[1:53:23] heart, I will dance like David.
[1:53:26] [music and singing]
[1:53:30] When the spirit of [music and singing]
[1:53:32] the Lord comes upon my heart, I will
[1:53:37] dance like David. [music]
[1:53:42] I will dance.
[1:53:44] [music]
[1:53:45] I will dance. [singing]
[1:53:48] I will dance like David. [music]
[1:53:53] Oh, I will dance. Yes, I [music] will
[1:53:57] dance.
[1:53:59] I will dance like David. Couple more
[1:54:03] verses before you go. When the
[1:54:06] [music and singing] spirit of the Lord
[1:54:08] comes upon my heart, I will pray like
[1:54:13] David [music]
[1:54:14] prayed.
[1:54:17] When the spirit of the Lord comes upon
[1:54:21] [music and singing] my Oh, I will like
[1:54:25] David [music]
[1:54:26] pray. Sing it now. Oh, I will.
[1:54:31] I will pray.
[1:54:34] I will pray. [music]
[1:54:38] [singing]
[1:54:39] Yes, I will pray. [music]
[1:54:43] I will pray.
[1:54:46] I will pray. [music] Just a tambourine.
[1:54:49] Just a tambourine. Sing it now. When the
[1:54:52] spirit of the Lord [singing and music]
[1:54:54] comes upon my heart, I will sing. Like
[1:55:00] David [singing and music]
[1:55:01] said, play that tambourine song. The
[1:55:04] spirit of the Lord [singing]
[1:55:06] comes upon my heart. I will like David.
[1:55:12] [singing]
[1:55:13] sing.
[1:55:14] Oh, I will sing. [music]
[1:55:18] I will sing.
[1:55:21] I will sing. Like,
[1:55:24] [music]
[1:55:26] yes, I will sing.
[1:55:29] I will sing. [music]
[1:55:32] I will see.
[1:55:37] [music]
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:55:52] [music]
[1:55:58] Bless. I will dance. I will [music]
[1:56:01] dance.
[1:56:03] I will dance.
[1:56:06] I will dance. [music]
[1:56:12] I will dance. [music]
[1:56:14] Yes, I will dance.
[1:56:18] I will dance.
[1:56:20] [music]
[1:56:25] [applause]
[1:56:28] [music]
[1:56:29] Hallelujah.
[1:56:34] [music] Hallelujah.
[1:56:37] Blessed be his name. You know the way
[1:56:39] brother Brandham was said it is when
[1:56:40] David was [music] dancing and that wife
[1:56:42] was criticizing him. He said, "You think
[1:56:44] that's something? Look at this." And he
[1:56:46] went in and did another dance in the
[1:56:47] Lord. When you're unashamed, you're
[1:56:49] unashamed. Can you say amen? You don't
[1:56:51] care what about about what people think.
[1:56:53] I know what God's doing in my heart.
[1:56:56] Only I know. Praise the Lord. And I'm
[1:56:58] going to dance before the Lord. God
[1:57:00] bless you as you're dismissed this
[1:57:01] morning. if we can do anything to help
[1:57:03] you. The greatest way that [music] you
[1:57:05] can be helped is if you'll listen to
[1:57:07] what's being said over the pulpit. God's
