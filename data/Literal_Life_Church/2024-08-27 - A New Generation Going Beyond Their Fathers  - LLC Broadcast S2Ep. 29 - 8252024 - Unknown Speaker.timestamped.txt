[1:00] it's that one regret that haunts her to
[1:05] this

[1:11] fade so many different stories we
[1:16] thought could not be redeemed but it's
[1:20] against our darkest
[1:23] failures we start to see the beauty of
[1:28] the blood

[1:37] undeserved that could never be

[2:11] thought just a single drop forever wipes
[2:19] away our every

[2:27] power Every Chain that has us bound
[2:31] lights at our
[2:34] feet and we stand
[2:37] free that's the beauty
[2:40] of the blood the goodness of his grace
[2:47] the mercy UND desert that can never be
[2:53] explained Heaven's rest takes all our
[2:57] scars for the worst in all of
[3:01] us that's the glory of the Cross The
[3:07] Wonder of his love that's the beauty of
[3:12] the
[3:15] [Music]
[3:20] blood when you get
[3:25] news from the doctor that you hoped you
[3:30] never
[3:32] he and fear sets
[3:36] in but then the
[3:39] [Music]
[3:41] word like a standard it cries out do not
[3:48] fear for you are
[3:51] heal that's the beauty of the
[3:55] blood the goodness of this grace
[4:00] the mercy UND desert that could never be
[4:07] explained Heaven's best has paid the
[4:11] price for our healing by his
[4:15] stripes that's the glory of the
[4:19] Cross The Wonder of his love that's the
[4:24] glory of the Cross The Wonder of his
[4:34] love that's the beauty of the
[4:39] [Music]
[4:43] blood the
[4:45] beauty of the
[4:52] blood Zachariah 1 and uh verse two the
[4:58] Lord hath been so
[5:00] displeased with your fathers and um that
[5:04] term your fathers is something we've
[5:07] been emphasizing because it's throughout
[5:09] the scripture when the new generation is
[5:12] referred back to your fathers the Lord
[5:15] hath been sore displeased with your
[5:17] fathers therefore say unto them say unto
[5:20] the new generation thus sayith the Lord
[5:22] of hosts turn ye unto me sayith the Lord
[5:25] of hosts and I will turn unto you saith
[5:29] the Lord of hosts so though the Lord had
[5:32] was displeased with the generations
[5:34] before them and their unbelief he could
[5:37] tell the generation here is your answer
[5:39] you get your eyes off your father's and
[5:42] turn to me and when you turn to me I'll
[5:45] turn and look at you I'll turn to you
[5:48] what a promise amen be ye and this goes
[5:51] further be ye not as your fathers unto
[5:54] whom the former prophets have cried
[5:56] saying thus sayith the Lord of hosts
[5:58] turn ye now from from your evil ways and
[6:00] from your evil doings he gave them the
[6:02] same message you need to turn to me and
[6:05] they didn't do it turn you now from your
[6:07] evil ways and from your evil doings but
[6:09] they did not hear nor hearken unto me
[6:12] saith the Lord your fathers where are
[6:15] they and the prophets do they live
[6:17] forever so these are questions that he's
[6:20] asking them but my words and my statutes
[6:23] which I commanded my servants the
[6:24] prophets did they not take hold of your
[6:27] fathers and they returned and said like
[6:30] as the Lord of hosts thought to do unto
[6:31] us according to our ways and according
[6:34] to our doings so hath he dealt with us I
[6:37] have uh felt
[6:40] moved by the Holy Spirit again to stay
[6:42] in this theme once again of the fathers
[6:47] and uh more specifically moving on the
[6:50] new generation moving on from the
[6:53] mistakes of the fathers and you know
[6:56] when the image of the fathers has not
[6:58] been right
[7:00] uh it can hinder the faith of the next
[7:03] Generations uh it's so powerful this
[7:06] image of the father it's so powerful
[7:08] that it applies both naturally and
[7:11] spiritually in other words when I say
[7:13] the effects of the image of a father not
[7:16] being quite right or being extremely
[7:18] wrong the effects are upon the new
[7:20] generations not only naturally but Also
[7:23] spiritually as well I'm dealing with
[7:25] mostly the spiritual part but in the
[7:28] natural if someone does not have the
[7:31] right image as a father it has long-term
[7:33] effects upon the human being and it can
[7:36] hinder the faith and the and the
[7:38] confidence and the the positive look at
[7:41] life for the Next Generation most of my
[7:44] time has been spent on the spiritual
[7:46] side uh but so much could be said uh on
[7:49] the natural side and uh the victory that
[7:52] comes when someone rises above the
[7:55] damage of a daddy there's great Victory
[7:58] when someone can get a hold of something
[8:00] real and they rise in their life above
[8:02] the damage that their Daddy has done
[8:05] that's the Victory and that's why I like
[8:07] to preach about it is because it's not
[8:09] just to talk about the damage that's
[8:10] done but to talk about the victory in
[8:13] Jesus Christ there's Victory in Jesus
[8:16] Christ there there's healing in Jesus
[8:18] Christ there's healing in his word can
[8:21] you say Amen damages you you we ought to
[8:25] take all of our damages in life
[8:27] emotionally mentally in our Soul we
[8:30] ought to take all the damage and we
[8:31] ought to bring it to one person and
[8:33] that's the Lord because he knows how to
[8:35] not only repair it but heal it so so
[8:38] much could be said about this but the
[8:40] but the wounds in the heart that were
[8:42] left by a daddy can be healed and we see
[8:45] that that can take place the answer is
[8:47] never to bury those damages inside of
[8:51] your spirit um that's not the answer it
[8:54] is so powerful sometimes you can hide it
[8:57] you can bottle it up this this damage
[9:00] from a father you can try to hide it you
[9:02] can try to cover it up but but that
[9:04] damage will stay there it doesn't go
[9:06] away easy it stays with you can can I
[9:09] get an amen this morning this these
[9:11] things are not things that are theories
[9:14] these are things after 6,000 years of
[9:16] human history that then when there's
[9:18] Damage Done to the spirit particularly
[9:20] by a father it doesn't go away easy it
[9:23] stays with you because the image of our
[9:26] father actually becomes if it's tainted
[9:29] becomes our image of our heavenly father
[9:32] we we associate it together in other
[9:34] words it gets Blended together
[9:35] especially for a young child if the
[9:37] image is not right then we we tend to
[9:40] associate it when somebody introduces us
[9:43] to the heavenly father if it's tainted
[9:45] with our Earthly father sometimes not
[9:47] always but it can be tainted that we
[9:49] don't trust this heavenly father and so
[9:52] now that's a real uh that's a real work
[9:54] of the Lord and the the answer is never
[9:57] to buried inside it is so powerful it
[10:00] won't go away that's how much effect it
[10:02] has on the human being there is a a
[10:04] normal incredible love that is supposed
[10:08] to come from our human fathers but most
[10:11] can't provide all of that love the
[10:14] fathers most of them cannot provide all
[10:16] of it because they didn't get that
[10:19] normal love themselves so how can they
[10:22] provide it all unless Christ comes in
[10:24] their life how can they fill those voids
[10:27] when they didn't get the proper love the
[10:30] themselves amen so we're talking about
[10:33] generational things here but I'm one who
[10:35] believes in the healing of the blood of
[10:38] Jesus Christ I'm one who believes that
[10:41] the Christ blood was not just the for
[10:43] the healing of the body or for the
[10:45] healing of the soul but Christ's blood
[10:47] was for the healing of Wounded Spirits
[10:49] on the inside as well our atonement is a
[10:53] complete atonement when he went to
[10:55] Calvary he didn't just provide for
[10:57] physical healing for us or to heal our
[10:59] soul his atonement is a complete
[11:02] atonement when he said it is finished
[11:06] then the healing for mankind is
[11:08] completely finished I believe in it and
[11:11] and then we should be I believe it heals
[11:13] all of the spirits that are been become
[11:16] wounded and damaged and then we we
[11:19] should be open to whatever way God uses
[11:22] to bring
[11:23] healing sometimes one word from an
[11:27] unexpected source can heal you just like
[11:31] that and basically it doesn't have to
[11:33] come through preachers it can come
[11:35] through
[11:37] anyone but you see you have to be open
[11:39] to how God heals because sometimes it's
[11:42] one word spoken by somebody a a word
[11:45] fitly spoken Solomon says a word fitly
[11:48] spoken in due season is like ashes of
[11:51] gold and pictures of silver it's a word
[11:53] fitly in other words a word that's
[11:54] anointed something that's said and
[11:56] that's it it drops it in there heals the
[11:59] heal human
[12:00] heart sometimes it happens
[12:02] instantaneously like that in other words
[12:04] it's it's very sometimes it's very quick
[12:06] but sometimes it's a healing that takes
[12:09] place over time God uses different
[12:12] sources sometimes it's music do you know
[12:14] God heals through the right kind of
[12:16] music sometimes it's a word sometimes
[12:19] it's preaching sometimes but we get all
[12:22] the credit we give all the glory back to
[12:25] God's
[12:27] power that is able to
[12:30] heal often I think of having prayer
[12:33] lines not only just for physical healing
[12:35] but for mental healing for emotional
[12:39] healing this seems to be not as
[12:41] emphasized but I guarantee you when we
[12:44] went through the healing Revival and we
[12:46] had so many healing campaigns most of
[12:48] them sparring off of William brandham
[12:50] when we had all the healing campaigns
[12:52] there was a great thrust to see the
[12:54] power of God be able to heal someone of
[12:56] the worst diseases even raise the dead
[12:58] there was a great thrusts for that but
[13:00] you see now after 40 50 60 years of uh
[13:04] of what people have been feeding on and
[13:06] what they and the breakdown of the
[13:08] American family it's not just physical
[13:10] healing that we need but there's a
[13:13] mental breakdown in our society and now
[13:15] we need more than ever the blood of
[13:18] Jesus Christ to bring healing to the
[13:20] human
[13:21] Spirit can I get an amen this morning we
[13:25] could have a healing campaign for that
[13:27] because there's a lot of people that we
[13:29] counsel and we deal with even within the
[13:31] church sometimes and they need something
[13:33] and I can know sometimes I don't have
[13:35] the answers except this that his
[13:38] atonement is complete he has
[13:42] provided what we need and it's for you
[13:45] this
[13:46] morning
[13:48] Hallelujah and so then we we should be
[13:50] open to how God uses it you know and so
[13:53] I've looked at a lot of information in
[13:54] the last few weeks I've studied the
[13:56] behavior of someone who did not have a
[13:59] father the behaviors that come from
[14:01] someone when they grow up who who was
[14:03] mistreated by their father uh I've
[14:05] studied someone who has a uh has had a a
[14:08] father physically in the home but
[14:10] they're not emotionally connected
[14:12] they've had their father there their
[14:13] whole lives around them but he really
[14:15] wasn't around he was home but he wasn't
[14:17] really home and so I've studied the
[14:19] behavior that comes in the adults that
[14:21] comes from this and all this behavior of
[14:23] course is documented and I haven't spent
[14:25] a lot of time bringing it up here uh but
[14:27] it brings holes in the heart it brings
[14:30] trait sometimes and I like to understand
[14:33] this behavior and these traits why why
[14:35] brother Paul why do you study that why
[14:37] do you understand the traits and the
[14:39] behavior well uh because I like to help
[14:42] people right that's the simplest
[14:45] answer I like to help people I like to
[14:49] relate to people I like to understand if
[14:53] I can what they're going through and
[14:55] where things come
[14:57] from so if that that's just a a feeble
[15:00] answer then uh that it is what it is I
[15:03] the reason I do it is I like to help
[15:05] people I like to understand PE people I
[15:07] like to get down where they are but I
[15:09] like to study things because I like to
[15:10] get where people at why why do I study
[15:13] this so so you know here's another
[15:15] reason so that I can judge them with
[15:19] Godlike
[15:21] judgment because if I take a quick
[15:23] conclusion about something and I don't
[15:26] understand better I can quickly conclude
[15:28] even about the answers and think that's
[15:30] the answer but I have to pray about the
[15:32] answer because sometimes the answer for
[15:34] one person may not be the answer for the
[15:36] next person so I want to understand
[15:38] better so I can administer Godlike
[15:41] judgment to the situation and you all
[15:43] know that we're supposed to administer
[15:45] Godlike conclusions Godlike discernment
[15:49] and Godlike to judgment Godlike judgment
[15:51] in matters that are rated related to
[15:53] human beings in Corinthians Paul said
[15:56] the people were going to law with one
[15:58] another and SU one another he said you
[16:00] shouldn't have to do that if you have
[16:02] the right to zern with among one another
[16:04] you would judge manners in a mature way
[16:07] but because they didn't have the
[16:08] maturity they judged things in an
[16:10] immature way and they were judging one
[16:13] another and so now I like to judge
[16:15] people with a Godlike judgment and a
[16:19] Godlike love can you say Amen that
[16:21] doesn't quickly judge them and write
[16:24] them off because they're having this
[16:25] problem it's another reason I like to
[16:28] study it not not to draw a quick
[16:29] conclusion to love people on a deeper
[16:32] level God always tries to get to the
[16:35] cause God is a doctor who gets to the
[16:38] cause and I want to be that type of
[16:40] doctor I want to be that type of
[16:43] believer you should want to be that type
[16:45] of person as a Christian can you say
[16:47] Amen is that you don't want to just
[16:49] quickly judge somebody by the symptoms
[16:52] that you see but to pray and say God but
[16:55] what is the cause of
[16:57] this and then you can love deeper amen
[17:01] then it's not just the quick answers
[17:03] like I've heard from ministers all due
[17:05] respect every answers you need the Holy
[17:08] Ghost you just need the Holy Ghost you
[17:10] just need the Holy Ghost come and be a
[17:12] pastor with me 35 years and deal with
[17:14] some people who go through seasons of
[17:15] their life they have the Holy Ghost in
[17:17] their life but they go through Seasons
[17:20] so that's not the answer you just need
[17:22] the Holy Ghost sometimes it is sometimes
[17:24] people need the Holy Ghost but it's not
[17:26] to catch all answer for everything
[17:29] yes why because God has a great Gospel
[17:31] of good news here and he has a great
[17:33] atonement here and it doesn't just it
[17:36] covers everything but you see God wants
[17:39] to get the cause of the problem and heal
[17:42] it that's how much he loves religion is
[17:46] a covering that covers up things
[17:50] sometimes the reason I like to get to
[17:52] the bottom of things is and how the Lord
[17:54] helped me do that is because if the
[17:56] person comes in the office and they know
[17:58] all the the quotes and they've already
[17:59] got the answers sometimes I don't know
[18:01] why they're in there cuz they're already
[18:03] and they're quoting this and and they
[18:04] already got it figured out but if
[18:06] they're real extremely spiritual in
[18:08] their talk sometimes they can be
[18:10] covering up through that religion it's
[18:12] not real spirituality it's a religion
[18:14] and religion is a covering religion is
[18:16] not Deliverance religious is just
[18:19] covering it
[18:21] up I know this is really striking with
[18:24] some of you this morning but I want to
[18:25] be open and honest we are not called in
[18:28] this message message to another religion
[18:30] religion is only a covering to cover up
[18:33] the real problem this message is not
[18:36] religion can you say Amen this message
[18:39] is deliverance and total
[18:42] Deliverance but religion covers up and
[18:45] when they go into that oh that super I'm
[18:47] just sitting back and saying oh we got
[18:49] to get over this thing because this is
[18:50] what Adam and Eve did in the garden they
[18:53] were hiding they were hiding in with
[18:55] their fig leaves which is a religion
[18:57] covering they're hiding from God because
[18:59] of the guilt of their sin and God took
[19:02] that situation and said you've got the
[19:04] wrong thing covering up you're trying to
[19:06] hide you're you're trying to cover this
[19:08] up that's not the way I deal with things
[19:10] I deal with things through
[19:14] blood I don't deal with with you
[19:17] covering up so he had to call them out
[19:19] of hiding in this case they were hiding
[19:21] behind the piano and say Adam and Eve
[19:23] you got to come out here you've got to
[19:25] take those fig leaves off that will not
[19:28] work can you say Amen first thing you
[19:31] got to do is come out of hiding and
[19:32] guess what it was the grace of God to
[19:34] call them out of
[19:36] hiding I might be preaching to you this
[19:38] morning to call you out of your hiding I
[19:41] might preach to you five years before
[19:42] you come out of your hiding but don't
[19:44] sit and hide behind a religion I'm in
[19:46] the message I'm okay I dress right I say
[19:49] all the right things but don't hide
[19:52] things that are unresolved in your life
[19:54] because the Holy Ghost will call you out
[19:56] of hiding because he has something
[19:59] better for you somebody ought to say
[20:01] Amen this morning because when you're
[20:02] hiding under religion and under the
[20:04] quotes and under I'm in the message for
[20:06] 30 years you might be hiding something
[20:09] but this isn't a hiding gospel this is a
[20:11] gospel of Deliverance it's openness it's
[20:14] honesty before our God come out from
[20:17] there come out of there get rid of those
[20:20] fig leaves goes over there and brother
[20:22] bra talks about it rips that animal skin
[20:25] apart it's all bloody it's dirty takes
[20:27] that animal skin and throws it over
[20:29] there to them and said put that on and
[20:32] he's starting to say what the answer
[20:34] will be it'll be
[20:36] blood you cover yourself in the blood of
[20:38] the
[20:39] Lamb oh somebody ought to praise the
[20:41] Lord for the blood of Jesus Christ this
[20:43] morning the atonement the token of
[20:47] God and guess what it wasn't Adam and
[20:50] Eve running towards God asking for help
[20:53] they were
[20:55] hiding you know they did the same thing
[20:57] in the days of Gideon there so afraid of
[20:59] the enemy they were hiding in caves and
[21:01] hiding in in all kinds of hideouts and
[21:04] all God's people were scared to death
[21:05] and they were hiding that's not the
[21:07] answer to hide people miss church for
[21:10] four and five years they go they go into
[21:12] hiding and think that's the answer
[21:13] that's not the answer the answer is to
[21:15] expose yourself to the presence of God
[21:18] whether it's church or anywhere else to
[21:20] say Lord here I am it should have been
[21:22] Adam and Eve coming out of hiding and
[21:24] saying Lord we messed up we sinned
[21:28] hallah help us
[21:31] Lord but it wasn't them running after
[21:34] like us human beings it was them running
[21:35] back towards God it was God running
[21:37] towards them trying to find him Adam
[21:40] Adam where are you it wasn't Adam saying
[21:43] God God where are you at I got to find
[21:46] you was God saying Adam where are you my
[21:49] sons and daughters of God where are you
[21:51] where'd you
[21:52] go are you did you run away to
[21:54] California did you run away to Texas try
[21:57] to get away from everything and God's
[21:59] saying Adam where are you he's coming
[22:01] and finding you and so God Ran after
[22:04] them to get him out of their
[22:05] hiding and uh the Fig Leaf
[22:10] conversations happen a lot I shouldn't
[22:12] say a lot of times but sometimes in my
[22:14] office it's fig Leaf conversations and
[22:16] God had to get Adam and eat out of their
[22:18] fig leaves to the blood don't act real
[22:21] religious when there's stuff way hidden
[22:23] unresolved in your hearts
[22:25] why because it's not over till it's over
[22:29] it's the simplest way to say it there's
[22:32] another one that says it's not over to
[22:33] the fat lady sings but I won't use that
[22:35] one this morning it's not over till it's
[22:37] over in other words unless you come to
[22:40] the resolve and you're delivered
[22:42] completely it's not over till it's
[22:45] over so you stay with it until it's over
[22:49] good open honest real raw conversation
[22:53] is a good place to
[22:55] start but then I'm not staying there I
[22:57] like to study the behavior to not only
[23:00] help me be able to see people the right
[23:03] way but not just to stay there and study
[23:06] the behaviors of uh children of fathers
[23:09] that weren't there or fatherless
[23:11] children that's not the reason I studied
[23:13] just so I can understand that but to
[23:15] point them to and to watch a real
[23:17] victory of people with daddy issues to
[23:20] watch a real Victory come in their lives
[23:23] I not only study the behavior but the
[23:25] keys that unlock the door to their
[23:29] Victory because the keys that unlock the
[23:31] door to Victory are in the lord they're
[23:33] in the word we have the keys to the
[23:35] kingdom can you say amen and so now in
[23:38] Zechariah 1 I believe is one of the keys
[23:40] in my text it says in and it's it's not
[23:44] the only reference to your fathers he
[23:46] says your fathers I was displeased with
[23:48] your fathers don't be like your fathers
[23:51] and then the key turn to me and I will
[23:54] turn to you turn to me this is a key
[23:58] it's that your fathers have done this I
[24:00] don't want you to be like your fathers I
[24:03] don't want you to act out what they did
[24:05] they displease me and throughout the
[24:07] scripture he talks about I was grieved
[24:09] with that
[24:10] generation and remember friends in this
[24:12] series that I'm preaching it was the
[24:14] generation that come under a
[24:18] prophet that he became grieved with
[24:21] wasn't worldly people it wasn't in Egypt
[24:23] it was the generation who for 40 years
[24:25] in the wilderness had a lack of faith to
[24:28] go on to the promise they they had
[24:30] unbelief they had complaints they never
[24:33] would rise in faith to say let's stop
[24:36] doing this let's stop circling the
[24:38] mountain and let's move on to our full
[24:41] inheritance in this they never would do
[24:43] that they Circle the mountain and God
[24:44] said you've circled it long enough it's
[24:47] time to go northward it's time to get
[24:50] past your past it's time to get past
[24:53] what your fathers have made of this law
[24:55] and this
[24:57] messag it's time to find out what it's
[24:59] really about can you say amen and so he
[25:02] says in this key he says turn to me and
[25:05] I will turn to you if your eyes are on
[25:08] just your father's it won't work could
[25:11] this be a key if you keep your eyes your
[25:14] whole life on your father and maybe what
[25:16] he did
[25:17] wrong you'll never get Victory but
[25:19] Christ says here's the answer turn to me
[25:23] right look at me and if your eyes are
[25:27] just on that it won't work turn and look
[25:29] toward me and uh there's a scripture in
[25:32] the New Testament you're familiar with
[25:34] looking unto
[25:36] Jesus the author and the finisher of our
[25:39] faith get your eyes on Jesus look unto
[25:42] Jesus the author your originator when
[25:44] you came in he was the originator the
[25:46] reason you came in but he's not just the
[25:48] originator he's the finisher of the work
[25:50] so look unto Jesus so he can finish the
[25:52] work in your life get your eyes off your
[25:54] fathers get your eyes off the past turn
[25:57] and get your eyes on me it turn and look
[26:00] towards me and I will turn and look at
[26:03] you now can you imagine friends the
[26:05] power of this that you're actually
[26:07] you're looking at him and he's looking
[26:10] at you you have turned only towards him
[26:13] he is an it's an audience of one where
[26:16] you shut everything else
[26:18] out when you shut the past out when you
[26:21] shut everything else all I need you to
[26:23] do is get your eyes looking at me turn
[26:26] to me and I'll turn to you notice the
[26:27] power of this I just I I don't know why
[26:30] I have an image of my mind but a father
[26:32] and a son or a father and daughter they
[26:34] can't even look each other in the eye
[26:36] after all the years of bitterness and
[26:37] then all of a sudden they get the trust
[26:39] to do that and there's repentance and
[26:41] there's heartfelt conversations and
[26:43] there's a beginning of some type of
[26:45] restoration and finally they can look
[26:47] one another in the eye and when that
[26:49] child looks in the Father's Eyes they
[26:51] see love coming out of his eyes eyes can
[26:54] say a lot can you say Amen you don't
[26:57] have to say something sometimes times
[26:58] but the eyes tell a lot that's why all
[27:00] the scriptures talking about we're
[27:01] beholding him we look at him we're b
[27:04] beholding in a glass with this message
[27:06] we're looking at something it's
[27:08] transforming us it's changing us well
[27:11] who we looking at not a bunch of laws
[27:13] and rituals we're looking at the person
[27:14] of Christ and as we look it changes us
[27:18] even without us trying to change ourself
[27:20] you keep looking at him he changes you
[27:22] from glory to glory you have the
[27:24] opportunity to rise to the occasion is
[27:26] that whatever is smudged from the past
[27:28] and wrong from the past I can leave that
[27:31] I can exit that and I can come to a real
[27:33] relationship with the father and the one
[27:36] thing I want to have is a relationship
[27:37] every day with my
[27:39] father I want to look into his eyes amen
[27:42] I wish above all things that you'd
[27:44] prosper and be in good health as your
[27:45] soul prospers God wants to prosper us
[27:48] God wants to bless us God wants to
[27:50] multiply us but what did he really want
[27:52] to do he wanted to pour himself into his
[27:55] son and pour himself into his sons and
[27:57] daughters you can go live your life you
[27:59] can get your career you can do all these
[28:00] things but the most essential thing
[28:02] young person in your life is that you
