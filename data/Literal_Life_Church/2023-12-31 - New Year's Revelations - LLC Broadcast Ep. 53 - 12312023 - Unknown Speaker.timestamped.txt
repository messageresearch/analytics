[5:35] H glor
[5:38] hallelu
[5:43] Hallelujah I
[5:46] [Applause]
[5:49] know
[5:51] [Music]
[5:57] Hallelujah so Psalms chap 1 and verse
[6:00] one blessed is the man blessed means
[6:03] that he's favored of God he's happy he's
[6:07] uh he's a blessed man of God blessed is
[6:09] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[6:12] of the ungodly nor standeth in the way
[6:15] of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[6:18] scornful now we could say that he's not
[6:21] a blessed man if he chooses to walk in
[6:23] the counsil of the ungodly if he chooses
[6:26] to stand in the way of Sinners nor s if
[6:30] he chooses to sit in the seat of the
[6:31] scornful then we could say he's not
[6:33] really a blessed man he may be blessed
[6:35] financially or other ways but in God's
[6:38] eyes he's not blessed because he chooses
[6:39] to position himself to these influences
[6:43] so but the man who chooses and the woman
[6:45] that chooses to be away from these
[6:46] influences and under the influence of
[6:49] God then he's a blessed man goes on to
[6:51] say but his Delight is in the law of the
[6:54] Lord his Delight his passion is in the
[6:57] word of God and in his law doth he
[7:00] meditate day and night day and night and
[7:04] he shall be like a tree planted by the
[7:08] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[7:11] fruit in his season his Leaf also shall
[7:15] not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[7:19] prosper now friends that's a pretty
[7:20] powerful set of scriptures here I
[7:22] believe it's a a blessing to see
[7:25] whatever he doeth shall prosper Happy
[7:28] New Year to everybody we're uh just
[7:31] thankful for the grace of God this last
[7:33] year to be able to enjoy his presence to
[7:36] see the things that he's done and the
[7:39] many hurdles that we've come through
[7:41] many of you we're just grateful to serve
[7:43] the Lord in this capacity to be a
[7:45] blessing to you and may God bless you
[7:47] and your families may it be the best
[7:48] year ever amen now I I just believe that
[7:52] these three scriptures three verses here
[7:54] this morning in it we find a greater
[7:57] Revelation than what we realize Li and
[8:00] in these scriptures that we read I
[8:02] believe that there's a great revelation
[8:05] of the place that a Christian uh can
[8:08] live every day to be an overcomer how
[8:11] many want to be an
[8:13] overcomer that's what we're called to be
[8:15] in leoa we're called to be over every
[8:17] age had Overcomers and we're called to
[8:19] be an overcomer not just a Survivor but
[8:22] an overcomer in this leoan age and so I
[8:25] believe we have some keys in Revelations
[8:27] here that gives us the keys to Christian
[8:30] lives living every day being an
[8:32] overcomer to be uh insulated from the
[8:36] world uh to be isolated from the
[8:39] influences uh that come in our minds and
[8:42] I want to elaborate on that in our
[8:44] thought life and there some different
[8:45] things here this morning because we can
[8:48] be insulated by the Holy Ghost we can be
[8:50] isolated from the influences of the mind
[8:53] and letting them Lodge within our
[8:55] thinking and our thought life and uh so
[8:58] we are we in the scripture here are
[9:00] typed as a tree and if you know your
[9:02] Bible you know that that trees are a
[9:05] type of a man and trees are a type of
[9:07] Christ because in the beginning in the
[9:10] Genesis we find that God talks about the
[9:12] trees that's in the garden but we know
[9:15] that not not all those trees were
[9:17] literal trees some of them were literal
[9:19] trees and some of them represented trees
[9:22] which trees represent man but also trees
[9:25] represented Christ and in the garden we
[9:27] have the Tree of Life in the garden we
[9:29] have the tree of knowledge of Good and
[9:31] Evil and actually incidentally those
[9:34] trees end up being symbolic that the
[9:36] Tree of Life In The Garden was a person
[9:39] the tree of knowledge and good and evil
[9:41] was a person so you can't look at it
[9:43] just through a carnal eyes when you look
[9:45] at the Book of Genesis but we find in
[9:47] the beginning God is speaking about
[9:49] trees in the garden and they were not
[9:51] all literal trees and then if you move
[9:54] to the middle of the Bible we see that
[9:56] the tree of life was a person that we
[9:59] eat of in the middle of the Bible Jesus
[10:01] was saying I am the bread of the life I
[10:03] am the way of life I am the Tree of Life
[10:06] in John 15 he refers to himself as the
[10:09] vine and you are the branches so so
[10:12] Jesus is saying you are connected to
[10:14] this tree of life you are the branches
[10:16] to this tree of life I'm the vine you
[10:19] are the branches and and he and we're
[10:21] engra not engrafted but we're part of
[10:24] this tree so my theme is that the reason
[10:26] that he speaks about in Psalms 1 is the
[10:28] tree
[10:29] a a man is like a tree planted by the
[10:32] rivers of Living Water because men type
[10:35] trees and and we can even bear the fruit
[10:37] of something of the world or we can be
[10:40] connected to the tree of life and your
[10:42] life becomes a tree of life your life
[10:45] bears fruit of Christ can you say Amen
[10:48] so now to summarize just this Foundation
[10:51] that I lay laying here this is a
[10:53] Believer who's been planted in the right
[10:56] place beside the flowing river and
[10:59] Waters of God this is a believer I'm
[11:02] summarizing now what I'm going to preach
[11:03] the rest of the time uh and then so but
[11:06] don't just hear the summary and then uh
[11:08] turn off the computer don't do that uh
[11:11] you should hear the rest of it but I'm
[11:13] summarizing that these three scriptures
[11:16] say that this is a Believer who's been
[11:20] planted in the right place beside the
[11:23] flowing Waters of God his life is
[11:26] planted in the right place his roots are
[11:28] going in the right place in the right
[11:30] position he has shut off all wrong
[11:33] influences he has one main passion in
[11:36] his life and that's the word of God and
[11:39] he is prospering both naturally and
[11:43] spiritually because it says whatsoever
[11:45] this man does is going to prosper praise
[11:49] God I don't want the world's
[11:52] Prosperity I I don't want the success of
[11:54] the world remember he said to Joshua if
[11:56] you'll follow these things Joshua 1 he
[11:58] said said Thou shalt have good success
[12:01] not just success but you'll have good
[12:03] success I want to ask you do you want
[12:05] the success of the world do you want the
[12:07] money of the world do you want the what
[12:09] they call success or do you want good
[12:12] success and good success is when you and
[12:15] your family are following the word of
[12:16] God obedient to the word of God serving
[12:18] him with God in in the passion for the
[12:20] word and then you'll have not just
[12:22] success but good success not just
[12:25] Prosperity but good prosperity God's
[12:28] prosper erity God's blessing in your
[12:30] life
[12:32] hallelujah praise be to God so this is a
[12:35] Believer that's been planted in the
[12:36] right place has shut off all wrong
[12:39] influences has one made passion the word
[12:41] and is Pros prospering both naturally
[12:43] and spiritually and we're talking about
[12:46] your spiritual life your tree I asked
[12:48] you today where is your tree planted
[12:52] what influence are you under right now
[12:54] what influence is your mind under what
[12:57] influence is your thought like life
[12:59] under uh where are you planted and what
[13:02] influence are you under you know uh
[13:04] planting and caring for plants and trees
[13:09] is actually an art and some people are
[13:12] actually gifted with it but then some
[13:13] people can learn I just bought my
[13:15] daughter uh some plant books my daughter
[13:18] amariah for Christmas I bought her cuz
[13:20] she's interested in learning more about
[13:22] planting and things she's really good at
[13:24] it good at it already she's really good
[13:26] at flowers and such but she wants to
[13:28] learn more because it's an actual art uh
[13:30] this guy I have no green thumb my thumbs
[13:33] are not green at all I do not do good at
[13:36] planning and matter of fact my wife gets
[13:39] on me because I'm usually with the
[13:40] Roundup around trying to get the weeds
[13:43] around things and a few times I've
[13:46] sprayed some really good plants and that
[13:49] doesn't go over well with the wife so
[13:51] you know I just attack the weeds but if
[13:53] I get into the planting thing that thing
[13:55] is not going to thrive under me I'm just
[13:57] not gifted at it but we know the simple
[14:01] fact that a tree and a and a plant we
[14:04] know I know this is simple today but I
[14:07] pray that you'll apply it to your lives
[14:09] a tree or a plant cannot Thrive if it's
[14:14] planted in the wrong
[14:16] atmosphere your life is a tree and where
[14:19] you're planted every day spiritually
[14:22] will determine your thriving as a as a
[14:25] tree of the Lord it has everything to do
[14:29] with it you can't say no that has
[14:30] nothing to do with it and what I feed on
[14:32] has nothing to do with it then you're
[14:34] denying what nature says unless a tree
[14:37] is planted in the right place it will
[14:40] not Thrive you're Divine denying all of
[14:42] Nature and you're saying that my life
[14:44] doesn't apply to that no he he typed
[14:46] your life in Psalms 1 as a tree and a
[14:50] man or a woman's life has to be planted
[14:53] close to the rivers of water for
[14:54] moisture can you say that for the right
[14:57] atmosphere can you say amen and if it's
[14:59] not there it's not going to be a
[15:02] thriving tree the wrong atmosphere and
[15:05] if it's there if it's planted in the
[15:06] wrong place it will not reach its full
[15:08] potential you have been you have to be
[15:10] planted in the right place to thrive
[15:13] even the church that you attend can make
[15:15] you grow and thrive in this word or
[15:18] shrivel up and
[15:21] die even the local church that you
[15:23] attend can either make you grow in the
[15:25] word in faith in the word in your
[15:27] position in the word or you can sit
[15:30] there and dry up and shrivel and
[15:33] die you better pray about what you need
[15:36] in your life I think when you're planted
[15:39] by the rivers of Living Water when your
[15:41] life is planted in the right place and
[15:43] you stay there and you're a away from
[15:44] the influences you set yourself as a
[15:47] candidate to receive all that God has
[15:49] for you and if you're lacking the Holy
[15:51] Ghost there's things you can do to obey
[15:53] him and stay close to him he's going to
[15:55] give you it's God's not standing back
[15:57] saying oh I just hold it back from him
[15:59] I'll hold the Holy Ghost back I keep
[16:00] God's not playing games like that God's
[16:03] not God's looking for a hunger in your
[16:05] heart and and Jesus refers to it he says
[16:09] a father when he sees his child needs
[16:11] something would he not give that to his
[16:14] child when they have a need and he said
[16:16] so much more is the father wanting to
[16:18] give the Holy Ghost to his children
[16:20] God's not trying to hold it back from
[16:22] you you set yourself in the right
[16:24] atmosphere and you show your hunger to
[16:26] God say God I need more of you he'll
[16:28] finish to work in you amen he'll seal
[16:30] you by the Holy Ghost you got to have a
[16:33] revelation to know go how much God loves
[16:35] you and then that love reaches back to
[16:37] him and that love governs every
[16:40] situation in life I'll read it later
[16:42] perfect Faith Masters every
[16:46] circumstance that's why we need to live
[16:48] in perfect Faith but where does it come
[16:50] where does it start a perfect love a
[16:52] genuine love knowing that God loves us
[16:55] knowing that he's called us knowing that
[16:57] he has whatever we need and and this
[16:58] governs and and that God loves you you
[17:01] love God you love one another and that
[17:03] brings Faith a revelation of the love of
[17:06] God loving him back is the creator of
[17:09] this perfect faith in our lives it's
[17:11] rooted in the love of God not in works
[17:14] not in just wearing the right thing not
[17:17] in doing perfect things no we need a
[17:19] perfect faith and that doesn't NE
[17:21] necessarily mean doing uh perfect things
[17:24] it's a life that loves him and others
[17:27] more than anything then in Psalms 92:12
[17:30] he said the righteous shall flourish
[17:32] like the palm tree he shall grow like a
[17:35] cedar in Lebanon those that be planted
[17:38] in the house of the Lord shall flourish
[17:41] in the courts of our God I don't know if
[17:43] they have that scripture but Psalms
[17:44] 92:12 the righteous shall flourish like
[17:46] a palm tree he shall grow like a cedar
[17:49] in Lebanon those that be planted in the
[17:51] house of the Lord shall flourish in the
[17:53] courts of our God they shall shall still
[17:57] bring forth fruit in old age they shall
[18:00] be fat and flourishing this goes right
[18:02] with Psalms 1 it's those that are
[18:03] planted you have to be planted in the
[18:05] right place you have to know your
[18:07] position Heavenly places in Christ so
[18:09] many scriptures point to this position
[18:11] being in the right place being planted
[18:13] in the right place that's what perfect
[18:15] Faith that's the perfect faith that
[18:16] we're called to you can have your faith
[18:18] built up temporary by testimonies a
[18:22] preacher can get testimonies and build
[18:24] Faith you can have your faith built up
[18:26] temporary by testimony or by hearing the
[18:29] word faith coming by hearing the word
[18:31] all those things are wonderful but I'm
[18:33] talking about staying in your position
[18:35] and not having a temporary Faith but a
[18:37] perfect faith that is stable that is
[18:40] planted when you use the word planted
[18:43] that means it's planted the roots are
[18:45] down it's there it's
[18:47] not rooting it up and moving
[18:50] constantly you can't spiritually do that
[18:53] and
[18:54] Thrive well I'm kind of tired of this so
[18:57] I'm just going to do this for a few
[18:58] years and you root yourself up and no
[19:01] the the the the plant has to be in one
[19:03] place and stay in that place this is the
[19:05] faith that I'm talking
[19:07] about knowing your position being
[19:09] planted in your position staying there
[19:13] not up and down but planted perfect
[19:15] faith and it's related to your position
[19:18] I hope this is a blessing to you I hope
[19:20] it's an encouragement I hope it builds
[19:21] your faith I hope you set you in a path
[19:23] to come to a life of perfect Faith why
[19:25] do you want to live another year in fear
[19:27] why do you want to live another year
[19:29] just not knowing who you are why do you
[19:32] want to continue to live on the fence
[19:34] about things why don't you be all in
[19:36] Lock Stock and Barrel want say God plant
[19:39] my life my tree plant my spiritual life
[19:43] right besides the rivers of water and
[19:46] Lord let me shut out the things of the
[19:48] world and let me live there this year
[19:50] every day amen what a what a goal what a
[19:54] New Year's
[19:57] revelation I'm just going to quickly
[19:59] make this simple as possible why is this
[20:02] man in Psalms 1 blessed prospering
[20:06] thriving why is he thriving why is he
[20:08] prospering it's where he's positioned
[20:11] himself first thing in his mind he is
[20:15] not open to just any influence number
[20:18] one when you take the counsel of the
[20:20] ungodly you think this doesn't fit with
[20:23] social media and all the access we have
[20:26] to all the wisen of the world and all
[20:28] the thoughts that come across your mind
[20:30] every day and across your phone and this
[20:34] applies the
[20:35] council the example of the
[20:39] ungodly is set before us all the
[20:42] time advice everybody wants to give
[20:45] their advice and everybody's an
[20:49] expert everybody has the final
[20:52] word fouchy Biden
[20:56] Trump the CD see act as if they have the
[21:00] final
[21:01] word and people get on with their
[21:03] opinions and they act as if they have
[21:06] the final word on it your opinion is not
[21:08] the final
[21:09] word my opinion is not the final word on
[21:13] it and so this whole thing of the
[21:16] counsel of the ungodly a Believer says
[21:19] now wait a minute did you give a deaf
[21:21] ear to the other voices and this
[21:23] believer in Psalms 1 gives a deaf ear to
[21:26] the advice and counsel of any one that's
[21:28] ungodly I'm getting practical now why
[21:31] are you given a place at the table to
[21:33] weigh in in your
[21:35] life from the counsil of the ungodly
[21:39] they have no example in their life
[21:40] they're not growing in the lord they're
[21:41] going backwards and you're giving a
[21:44] place at your table and in your thought
[21:47] life to the counsil of the
[21:50] ungodly he is not following their advice
[21:53] he's not following their example he's
[21:55] not get living on Google uh to Google
[21:58] information for the decision he makes I
[22:01] don't make my decisions just based upon
[22:03] a Google
[22:04] search if this is some of your influence
[22:06] you will never grow to more faith this
[22:09] blessed believer is not influenced by
[22:11] those things he doesn't walk in the path
[22:13] of Sinners to be in the path is just to
[22:16] be around them doesn't stand in the path
[22:18] of sin says he's standing he's around
[22:20] them he's watching what they're doing
[22:22] he's standing in the path he's not
[22:24] necessarily following them but he's just
[22:26] standing in the path watching what
[22:28] they're doing the path of Sinners is
[22:30] that where your life is but you're
[22:32] really just standing the path of Sinners
[22:34] on the internet and every else you're
[22:35] just standing there watching what do
[22:36] they do what fun are they having you're
[22:38] standing in the path of Sinners you may
[22:40] not be going down the path but you're
[22:42] standing there watching what they're
[22:44] doing not necessarily following but just
[22:47] standing watching what they do all day
[22:49] it's feeding on what they're
[22:52] doing I wonder what they're doing I
[22:54] wonder what's why but it's so much fun
[22:57] watching them do it just standing them
[22:59] watching them on their path which
[23:02] incidentally leads to a path to
[23:05] hell you don't want to watch people that
[23:07] are on path to
[23:08] Hell nor in the seat of the scornful you
[23:13] know what I cannot take two minutes and
[23:15] talk about the seat of the
[23:18] scornful the mockers the scoffers the
[23:21] complainers the
[23:23] critical moping all the time finding
[23:26] what's wrong finding what's negative
[23:29] you associate yourself with people like
[23:30] that all the time you're not going to be
[23:31] positive about your walk with the Lord
[23:34] we need to talk about people that stand
[23:36] in the way of Sinners we need to talk
[23:37] about people that dwell in the Council
[23:39] of the ungodly and now you're sitting in
[23:41] the seat and this is you were standing
[23:43] in the way of Sinners but now you're
[23:44] sitting in the seat of the scornful I
[23:46] want to elaborate on that of being
[23:48] around negative people and being around
[23:51] backsliders and being around people that
[23:53] are constantly negative that's not going
[23:54] to help you my brother that's not going
[23:56] to help your life they might even be in
[23:58] this church but it's not going to help
[24:00] you to stay around them if you can say
[24:01] an encouraging word and try to pull them
[24:02] out of it but most of the time you can't
[24:04] pull them out of it because they're just
[24:05] negative but you're not going to be in
[24:07] good shape if you hang around just those
[24:09] people all the time amen you're not
[24:12] going to be positive you're not going to
[24:14] have faith you're not going to be
[24:15] confident in what God is doing you're
[24:17] not going to be Kingdom living in the
[24:19] kingdom when you're around the seat of
[24:20] the scornful and they just sit and
[24:22] criticize and they're they're constantly
[24:24] uh looking at things all the time from
[24:26] that perspective those people are not
[24:28] going to do you any good you're not
[24:29] going to prosper being around people
[24:31] like that may that be part of your New
[24:32] Year's resolution Revelation may that be
[24:35] part of your desire Lord let me distance
[24:38] myself from influences that's plaguing
[24:40] my mind making me negative let me sit
[24:42] myself plant myself in the right place
[24:45] let me jump ahead and say this blessed
[24:47] and happy and favored man or woman of
[24:50] God have intentionally position
[24:52] themselves away from people like that
[24:55] away from influences like that they have
[24:57] have to in order to live in the kingdom
[25:00] and his passion his Delight is in the
[25:02] word of God above anything else it's
[25:05] exciting to him they can't wait to get
[25:07] to church they can't wait to hear the
[25:08] word from the church they can't wait to
[25:10] open their Bible they can't wait to read
[25:12] it it's not just reading it it's a
[25:14] passion for it this is this man in
[25:16] Psalms 1 can you say amen and he doesn't
[25:19] let things get lodged in his mind it
[25:20] says he's not only not only does he have
[25:23] a passion for the law of God and the
[25:25] word of God but in that law he meditates
[25:28] day and night this is what he allows
[25:30] himself to think about all the
[25:33] time this is what he meditates about so
[25:36] I don't have a choice in some things I
[25:38] don't have control over some things but
[25:40] I want to tell everybody here I and you
[25:42] have control over our thought
[25:44] life
[25:46] yes see the devil's convince you you
[25:48] don't oh the devil's just bringing all
[25:50] these thoughts no you have control over
[25:51] it you can replace good thoughts with
[25:53] wrong thoughts and you have to
[25:55] distinguish between what's imagination
[25:57] what's Satan's thoughts coming to you
[25:59] and quickly dismiss them not giving them
[26:01] a place at the table and say I'm going
[26:03] to replace it with perfect Thoughts with
[26:06] good thoughts with wholesome thoughts
[26:08] think on these things and so I'm
[26:11] meditating on the word meditating what I

[26:21] prospering this a Believer who's
[26:23] spiritually in a Revival cuz he's not
[26:25] influenced by everything around him he
[26:28] switches out his thoughts back to the
[26:30] word he's thinking his thinking is
[26:33] directed his thought life is directed
[26:35] There are many things we don't have
[26:37] control over but he has control over
[26:40] what this man has control over what he
