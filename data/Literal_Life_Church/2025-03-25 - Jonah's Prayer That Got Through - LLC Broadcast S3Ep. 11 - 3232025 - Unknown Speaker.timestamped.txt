[3:41] Jonah chapter 2. Then Jonah prayed unto
[3:43] the Lord his God out of the fish's
[3:45] belly, and said, I cried by reason of my
[3:48] affliction unto the Lord, and he heard
[3:50] me. Out of the belly of hell, cried I,
[3:53] and thou heardest my voice. For thou
[3:56] hast cast me into the deep. In the midst
[3:58] of the seas, and the floods compass me
[4:01] about, all thy billows, and thy waves
[4:03] passed over me. Then I said, I am cast
[4:06] out of thy sight. Yet I will look again
[4:08] toward thy holy temple. So this is what
[4:11] he's feeling now, that the Lord has
[4:13] actually cast him out of his sight. And
[4:16] yet, even with that kind of
[4:17] discouragement and knowing the Lord had
[4:19] done it because of his rebellion or his
[4:21] running away from the Lord, he still
[4:23] said, "I'm gonna look.
[4:26] The Lord's cast me out of his sight."
[4:28] And so, I'm out of God's sight. At least
[4:30] is what he felt. We're never out of
[4:31] God's sight. But he felt like I'm so far
[4:35] for what I've done. And I'm in now in
[4:38] this fish the the the belly here and I
[4:40] I'm in a terrible state. But he's not
[4:42] gonna start looking stop looking toward
[4:45] the holy temple. Amen. That's the way we
[4:47] should be. Amen. It doesn't matter how
[4:49] low we get. We and we feel like we're
[4:52] cast out of the Lord's sight. We're not
[4:53] out of his sight, but we should always
[4:55] turn and look again. Verse five. The
[4:57] waters compass me about even to the
[4:59] soul. The depth closed me round about.
[5:01] The weeds were wrapped around my head. I
[5:04] went down to the bottoms of the
[5:05] mountains. The earth with her bars was
[5:07] about me forever. Yet hast thou brought
[5:10] up my life from corruption, the Lord my
[5:12] God. When my soul fainted within me, I
[5:15] remember the Lord, and my prayer came in
[5:18] unto thee into thine holy temple. They
[5:21] that observe lying vanities forsake
[5:24] their own mercy. But I will sacrifice
[5:26] unto thee with the voice of
[5:27] thanksgiving. I will pay that that I
[5:29] have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord.
[5:31] And the Lord spake unto the fish. How
[5:34] many believes God can speak to animals?
[5:36] How many believe God can speak to
[5:37] anything? When he hears the cry of his
[5:41] people coming from and it makes his holy
[5:43] temple and his presence, he can speak to
[5:46] anything in your life. He can speak to
[5:48] the storm. He can speak to whatever it
[5:50] is and he can bring you out of it. And
[5:51] the Lord spake unto the fish and it
[5:53] vomited out in Jonah upon the dry land.
[5:57] And I want to title this tonight.
[5:58] Jonah's prayer that got through. His
[6:00] prayer got through. His prayer made it
[6:02] through. And it actually come from,
[6:05] brother Bram refers to about five miles
[6:07] down into the deep. I don't know how far
[6:08] it was. Uh but he says it was pretty
[6:11] deep in the ocean at the bottom cuz
[6:14] Jonah refers to it. And somehow he
[6:17] couldn't get out but his prayer got out.
[6:19] That's right. So it shows how powerful
[6:22] the prayer is of as a son and daughter
[6:24] of God. Even when they're in the state
[6:27] of running away from the presence of the
[6:29] Lord, there's something there that was
[6:32] something within Jonah that when he
[6:34] spoke it in the right position in the
[6:36] right thing, it was he couldn't get out,
[6:39] but his prayer got out some five miles
[6:42] below the ocean. If it goes that far, I
[6:44] don't know. But the thing is is that how
[6:47] that prayer made it through all that all
[6:49] the way to God. And as I was bringing it
[6:52] up, he didn't really deserve to pray at
[6:55] that time. He might not have felt that
[6:57] he had the worthiness to pray at that
[6:59] time. And so I want to I want to speak a
[7:02] little bit practically about our prayer
[7:03] tonight because there are hindrances to
[7:05] our prayer sometimes. But this is just
[7:08] an amazing
[7:10] uh just an amazing prayer. But it's
[7:13] amazing because it's set in a setting of
[7:15] a man who's actually being rebellious to
[7:17] God. He's a man that really don't
[7:19] deserve to pray. That's the way we we
[7:21] look at it. He said he doesn't deserve
[7:23] to bring bring anything before the
[7:24] throne of God. And I refer you to James.
[7:27] He said that confess our faults one to
[7:29] another and the prayer of faith shall
[7:31] save the sick. Confess your faults. And
[7:33] he says he he says Elijah was a man
[7:35] subject to like passions like we are. He
[7:38] had weaknesses like us and yet God heard
[7:40] his prayer. So So the prayer of a
[7:43] righteous man, the righteous man isn't
[7:44] perfect in his flesh, but he
[7:46] acknowledges God. He acknowledges his
[7:48] word. Can you say amen? Uh, in the last
[7:50] two or three years, I've loved preaching
[7:52] about Jonah. It's always nice to talk
[7:54] about somebody else's weaknesses instead
[7:56] of your own. But, you know, I I've been
[7:59] pretty rough in my preaching the last
[8:00] few years. Jonah is a type of all of us
[8:03] sometimes, and we all run from the Lord.
[8:06] We run from his presence. We run from uh
[8:08] uh responsibility sometime. We run from
[8:11] the word of the Lord when he gives it.
[8:12] We don't latch on to it sometimes right
[8:14] away. We come reluctantly because of our
[8:16] flesh. And uh but I look at his life. I
[8:19] look at how his life even ended after
[8:21] God gave him a victory and I say like
[8:23] boy, you know, you need to get your act
[8:26] together. That's the way I've said it.
[8:27] You you really need to get and as I've
[8:29] said, I think God could have chose
[8:31] someone else, but he couldn't choose
[8:33] someone else because he was a son of
[8:34] God. He was a predestinated son of God.
[8:38] And he maybe got out of his position
[8:40] sometimes. But when push come to shove,
[8:43] he reached inside of him and realized,
[8:45] I'm a son of God. and he brought who he
[8:48] was in the Lord out to his mouth in
[8:51] prayer and it somehow made it through.
[8:54] Hallelujah. And what I see in Jonah's
[8:56] life is that that that that great
[8:59] revelation for this hour, especially
[9:01] under the third pole. He that is in you.
[9:04] Greater is he that is in you than he
[9:07] that is in the world. Greater is he that
[9:10] was way deep down in Jonah than the
[9:12] situation he was in, the fish he was in.
[9:16] Greater, can you say amen? Brother Bam
[9:18] says, "Greater is he that was in Noah
[9:20] than the ark and the storm. Greater is
[9:22] he that was in Moses than all of Egypt's
[9:25] power." He kept emphasizing he that is
[9:27] in you. And Jesus said, "Greater is he
[9:29] that's in you that he that is in the
[9:31] world." So there's something deeply
[9:33] hidden down in a son of God that will
[9:36] always be greater, hallelujah, than the
[9:38] symptoms and the situations therein.
[9:40] Hallelujah. The problem is it gets
[9:42] smothered over. He that is in you gets
[9:44] smothered over sometimes with a lot of
[9:47] seaweed. Amen. That's the truth. All
[9:51] kinds of seaweed, all kinds of doubt,
[9:54] all kinds of uh you know, whatever it
[9:56] is, it it gets covered over so much that
[9:59] we forget. This isn't a surface gospel.
[10:02] This isn't a surface message. This goes
[10:05] deep and it reaches down into he that is
[10:08] in you. Right. That's right. That's the
[10:11] part God wants to work on. Amen. That's
[10:13] the part God's trying to draw out of
[10:15] you. We'll get to that more in a minute.
[10:17] But, you know, he sure seems backsliding
[10:19] to me. I've been run from him. But he
[10:20] was rebelling and running from the
[10:22] commission God had called him to do. And
[10:24] he becomes an example of us all. Brother
[10:27] Brandham said, "How many has ever ran
[10:29] from what God told you to do?" Just
[10:31] three of us. All right. H how many has
[10:35] ever ever got buried in your
[10:37] consequences from running from the
[10:39] presence of the Lord? That's right. Oh,
[10:41] yeah. All right, brother Brandham is
[10:42] right. Then how many then had God use
[10:44] you when you did obey and you got a
[10:46] victory out of it? How many's had that
[10:47] happen? That's what happened in chapter
[10:49] three. It's only four chapters to his
[10:51] life. Uh then how many got mad and still
[10:55] questioned God sometimes and lacked
[10:57] mercy and grace for others? How many's
[10:59] ever done that? The book of Jonah has
[11:01] four chapters. Chapter one, Jonah is
[11:03] running from God. Chapter two, Jonah is
[11:05] running to God. Chapter three, Jonah is
[11:08] running with God. Chapter four, Jonah is
[11:10] running ahead of God.
[11:13] So, Brother Bram says if if his life is
[11:15] a type of us all, we find our life in
[11:18] that. Can you say amen? And we've been
[11:20] all these things. We've had all these
[11:21] ups and downs. The man got mad because
[11:24] the Nvites repented. He turns against
[11:26] him. He goes in seclusion. He gets he
[11:29] gets out by himself. He's suicidal. He
[11:31] said, "Lord, just take me." He's angry.
[11:34] He's selfish. He doesn't look to others.
[11:37] He didn't even like the Gentiles. So God
[11:39] is I what I preached on Jonah is that
[11:42] though he was the son of God, God had a
[11:44] lot to work on on his pride and his
[11:48] prejudice, right? And his and his anger
[11:51] and his suicidal spirit and his
[11:53] depression. Yeah. And yet with all of
[11:56] that, God said, "That's my son." Yes.
[12:00] Amen. That's right. And tonight I'm
[12:02] preaching and he heard his son's prayer.
[12:05] Yes, he did. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[12:07] Hallelujah. He heard his son's prayer.
[12:10] Yes, he did. Hallelujah. And he didn't
[12:12] deserve it.
[12:14] And so I'm thankful. So, you know, I
[12:17] want to look at the elements of his
[12:18] prayer tonight. This may seem very
[12:19] simple, but I want to look at the
[12:20] elements of Jonah's prayer that somehow
[12:22] this prayer got through. And remember,
[12:25] that's why his disciples, as you
[12:27] remember my service for a couple weeks
[12:28] ago, his disciples were asking, "Teach
[12:30] us to pray, Lord. Teach us to pray."
[12:33] Because his prayers had results. Right.
[12:36] That's right. The Jews were praying
[12:38] people. The Pharisees were praying
[12:40] people. The Jews, his disciples were
[12:42] praying men. What I know of the Jews,
[12:44] they're praying people, especially back
[12:46] then. But why is it they're asking
[12:48] Jesus, "Teach us to pray
[12:51] because his prayers were uh breaking up
[12:55] demon power."
[12:57] Hallelujah. His prayers were getting
[12:59] through to the father.
[13:01] His prayers were healing people. His
[13:03] prayers were delivering people. His
[13:05] prayers were getting through. His
[13:08] prayers were piercing the darkness. Uh
[13:10] it's an amazing thing that Jonah, his
[13:13] prayer rose out of the darkest, worst
[13:15] condition. When nothing else would
[13:17] help, when nothing else could help. Like
[13:21] the song says, when nothing else could
[13:23] help, love lifted me. Amen. He brought
[13:29] me out of the miry clay. That's what
[13:32] happened. He brought Jonah out. But
[13:34] what? Guess what got out first? His
[13:35] prayer got out. That's right. Amen.
[13:37] Because he couldn't get out by himself.
[13:39] Yes, sir. So, your prayer has to get out
[13:40] first. Yes. Amen. And then he he got him
[13:44] out. He got him out. And so helpless
[13:47] conditions, nothing else rose up except
[13:49] his prayer. Nothing else had
[13:51] resurrection power in it but his prayer.
[13:53] That's right. How many know that we
[13:56] could put down Jonah, and I've done
[13:57] that, but how many know that his he's
[14:00] the only prophet that Jesus referred to
[14:03] as a type of his life of resurrection?
[14:06] That's right. His life spoke of the
[14:08] resurrection of Jesus Christ. That's
[14:09] right. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[14:11] Hallelujah. Said I said to those Greeks
[14:13] or Jews, he said, "I'll give you a
[14:14] sign." He says, "It's the sign of
[14:16] Jonah." After three days, God brought
[14:19] him out of the uh the whale's belly and
[14:21] and God delivered him. His life is a
[14:24] sign of my resurrection. And that means
[14:26] Jonah's prayer had resurrection power in
[14:28] it. Jonah's prayer got him through to
[14:30] resurrection power to bring him out of
[14:32] that after 3 days. Amen. Hallelujah. His
[14:35] prayer, nothing else had resurrection
[14:38] power in it but his prayer. He could not
[14:40] rise but his prayer rose. His prayer
[14:44] faith made it up and out and came into
[14:46] the temple into the It's just amazing
[14:48] friends. His prayer went up all that way
[14:53] into the dimensions of God. When he
[14:55] couldn't get out, his prayer made it out
[14:56] first. That's right. He couldn't even
[15:00] move. He was bound by all kinds of
[15:03] seaweed around his head. He said he
[15:06] couldn't move, but his prayer could. Can
[15:09] somebody give me an amen tonight?
[15:11] Sometimes when we can't move, our
[15:13] prayers can move God. So now I think in
[15:16] this in this I think of David praying
[15:18] for 21
[15:20] days and he didn't think it was getting
[15:23] through but it was it did make it
[15:25] through. But the reason that he couldn't
[15:27] see his prayer get through the answer
[15:29] was on its way but the answer got held
[15:32] up. So now you have the prayer gets
[15:34] through quicker than you think. Daniel
[15:36] didn't know that his prayer made it
[15:37] through but for 21 days the answer
[15:39] coming back got held up by demon power.
[15:42] Amen. the prince of Persia, all kinds of
[15:46] demons. The answer is coming back and
[15:48] there's a there's a fight going on in
[15:50] the other dimension. You know, I like to
[15:52] say it that God, I tell you, when he's
[15:55] getting a son and daughter of God, he's
[15:57] going to go after them. And you don't
[15:58] know how many years or how many things
[16:01] God fought through to get to you. That's
[16:04] right. That's right. That's right. You
[16:07] don't know how what it took to make you
[16:08] a Christian tonight. You don't know what
[16:10] it took for God to get through to you.
[16:12] That's right. Some of you are pretty
[16:14] stubborn. Some of you had spirits on you
[16:17] and God had to fight because of his
[16:19] grace fight through all of it to get
[16:21] back to answer back to you. Thank you,
[16:23] Lord Jesus. And he'll do it. Daniel
[16:26] prayed 21 days and by the time the angel
[16:29] got there, he says, "I heard your prayer
[16:30] the first time you said it." Amen.
[16:34] Hallelujah. I heard your prayer the
[16:36] first time you spoke it, but I had to
[16:39] fight my way through demon power to get
[16:42] the answer. So, what's the elements
[16:44] before we uh just bring it hone it in
[16:46] here tonight? What's the elements of
[16:48] Jonah's prayer? Well, number one, he
[16:50] wasn't worthy to ask. Really,
[16:53] we already covered that, but he wasn't
[16:56] worthy to ask based on his running from
[16:58] the presence of the Lord and running
[17:00] from responsibility. He wasn't worthy. I
[17:03] don't know if he didn't feel at the
[17:05] beginning worthy, you know, he's he's
[17:07] kicked off of the ship. He He told him
[17:10] to kick him off because he's the one
[17:12] causing the storms. He I'm I'm running
[17:14] from God and you'll be safe if you kick
[17:16] me off of this. He didn't know there was
[17:18] a big fish down there that God had
[17:20] prepared for him. Yeah, that's right.
[17:22] Cuz God knows how to get your attention.
[17:24] He does. Amen. God knows how to get your
[17:27] attention. And God knows if you're
[17:30] traveling a certain way and I and it's
[17:32] away from the responsibility of God and
[17:35] I'm headed that way because I'm running
[17:37] from it. I'm running from it. God has a
[17:40] way of creating a big fish to redirect
[17:44] your travel. That's right. Redirect your
[17:47] plans. That's right. He does. Right. God
[17:50] works that way in our lives. And and so
[17:53] now in feeling that once he got
[17:55] swallowed up there had if he was a man
[17:57] he had to be say I feel I don't know if
[18:00] I can go to my God because look what
[18:03] I've done.
[18:04] Similar to what you think this week I
[18:08] can't pray because of the kind of week
[18:10] it's been the kind of person I've been.
[18:12] I can't pray. Feeling unworthy to pray
[18:15] is what the devil uses so much. That's
[18:18] right. To cause sons and daughters of
[18:21] God to forget their authority in God.
[18:26] Feeling unworthy. But yet there was
[18:28] something laying deep inside him that he
[18:31] tapped into in that situation. And that
[18:34] he that was in him had to rise above the
[18:38] unworthiness feeling that he felt. Oh
[18:41] yes. Let me tell being basic tonight.
[18:44] You never get through to God unless you
[18:46] get over your complexes and your
[18:48] unworthiness and being beat up by the
[18:50] devil over your mistakes. Bring them
[18:53] underneath the blood. Amen. That's the
[18:55] truth. Amen. Get over that unworthiness
[18:58] and say, "I'm not worthy because of me.
[19:00] I'm I I I I'm worthy because the blood
[19:03] of the lamb. He has made me worthy to
[19:06] pray. He has made me worthy. He has
[19:09] given me rights from Calvary. I have a
[19:12] right to pray. I have a right to be
[19:14] happy. Hallelujah. And though I'm I I'm
[19:17] unworthy within myself, God has given me
[19:19] a right to pray, the prayer of
[19:21] authority. That's right. And I'll do
[19:23] that now. And that's what he did. He
[19:25] just began to pray not from the surface,
[19:28] not from the symptoms, but he began to
[19:30] pray from who he was as a son of God.
[19:32] And I begin to do that. I'm a son of God
[19:34] here. I'm still a son of God. You know,
[19:35] I'm still kicking. I'm still alive. I'm
[19:38] covered up by seaweed, but I'm still a
[19:40] son of God. I'm still breathing. And as
[19:43] long as I'm still breathing, I can pray.
[19:45] If you're breathing, let everything that
[19:47] have breath praise the Lord. So, who
[19:50] needs to praise the Lord? Everybody
[19:52] who's breathing tonight. That's right.
[19:54] Come on now. Some of you haven't even
[19:56] said amen to me, but nobody has a right
[19:58] to bow out. Let everything that have
[20:01] breath praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[20:04] Hallelujah. Amen. He didn't feel worthy,
[20:07] but he tapped into something. The second
[20:09] thing, that's the first thing he didn't
[20:10] he didn't feel worthy. Second thing is
[20:12] he positioned himself right. He looked
[20:15] away from the symptoms and he looked
[20:17] toward he positioned himself in his
[20:20] heart towards the temple because that's
[20:22] what the word told him to do. You have
[20:24] to be in a position to have perfect
[20:26] faith. You have to position yourself.
[20:28] Brother Brandon says, "Now remember the
[20:30] disciples, they had the word and the
[20:32] word was flesh then and the word told
[20:34] them, I give you power." Amen. I give
[20:37] you power. And they had the power, but
[20:39] they didn't have the faith to operate
[20:41] the word that was in them. You see what
[20:43] I mean? But Jesus had it. He was the
[20:46] word and he had faith that what he said
[20:50] would happen. He said, "Oh, bring him
[20:52] here. How long will I suffer you?" He
[20:54] had faith with his power. How did he? He
[20:56] said, "I can do nothing in myself." Why?
[20:59] He relied upon what he was. He relied in
[21:03] knowing that he was the word and he had
[21:06] faith in God
[21:08] who made him the word. He was God the
[21:12] word and they was in him and that give
[21:15] him faith because he understood his
[21:18] position.
[21:21] Confidence, faith in what God had him
[21:24] for. You know, he didn't have him there
[21:26] for just a regular live a regular life.
[21:28] He had him there for a purpose. Jesus
[21:30] knew his purpose. God called him and
[21:33] this gave him faith and confidence in
[21:35] his position in the word. He knowed what
[21:37] he was because the scripture had said he
[21:40] was this. And here every scripture tied
[21:43] in to prove that he was exactly what the
[21:45] scripture said he would be. And he knew
[21:48] what he was. Therefore, he relied upon
[21:51] what God had made him. And if he did
[21:54] that, then can't we rely upon what God
[21:57] has made us as believers? It doesn't say
[22:00] just Jesus. No, it said him. Him that's
[22:03] in you. These signs shall follow them
[22:05] that believe. He had faith in what he
[22:08] was. And if you're a believer, you have
[22:11] faith in what you are. You are a
[22:14] believer.
[22:16] Maybe you just need to tell the devil
[22:17] when you feel unworthy to pray. Okay,
[22:19] I'm going to start from scratch here. I
[22:21] am a believer. So number three, he
[22:24] called the conditions and symptoms he
[22:26] was around lying vanities and he told us
[22:29] to call him that.
[22:31] How did he say it? He said, and you
[22:33] know, I'm teaching us to pray now. Um
[22:35] Jonah is teaching us to pray. How did
[22:37] this prayer get through? Well, here's
[22:39] elements to it. He didn't feel worthy,
[22:41] but he had to find he was a son of God.
[22:43] Number two, he had to position himself
[22:44] as a son of God.
[22:46] Number three, you have to not look at
[22:49] your
[22:50] symptoms because they're lies. You have
[22:54] to look at the promise. That's right.
[22:56] Right. He gave us some instruction verse
[22:58] eight and how you're supposed to pray.
[23:00] They that observe lying vanities, that
[23:02] means observe means look at. If you're
[23:04] looking at the at the symptoms, you
[23:07] should call them lying vanities. And if
[23:10] you're looking at that, you forsake your
[23:11] own mercy. That's right. You limit God's
[23:14] deliverance coming in when you're only
[23:16] going to look at the symptoms.
[23:20] And he calls them lying vanities. We can
[23:22] call them that. Jonah, I mean, I I can I
[23:26] can buy into his
[23:27] prayer. And part of our prayer means
[23:30] that we don't
[23:32] observe constantly the symptoms. That's
[23:36] right.
[23:38] Because they're lies. And lies are from
[23:40] the enemy. And our bodies are meant to
[23:42] be healthy. That's right. The the system
[23:46] was created by God, the winds and all
[23:48] these things. But when Satan gets in it,
[23:50] he creates a storm. He didn't create a
[23:52] storm, but he he bring I was reading he
[23:55] that is in you today. And he said when
[23:56] you come into the storm, that's always
[23:58] Satan. So you have something created by
[24:00] God. The the the whole uh system of of
[24:04] the weather and all that, all those
[24:06] things, it's created by God. But now
[24:08] when Satan gets in it, he's the one that
[24:10] brings the storms. So now when a storm
[24:12] comes in your life, now now you have to
[24:15] look at that as Satan's come into
[24:17] something that was meant to be healthy.
[24:19] That's right. So you speak to that. You
[24:22] have to speak Satan off of that. Satan,
[24:24] you don't belong there. This is my
[24:25] health. This is my body. And though you
[24:28] see symptoms, uh, the symptoms are lying
[24:30] vanities. That's right. Amen. That's
[24:32] right. I And I don't like people to
[24:34] pretend they're not in pain. I don't
[24:35] think that's what he's talking about. I
[24:37] think it's what you're looking at. You
[24:39] have to look at the promise in your
[24:40] prayer. You have to keep your eyes on
[24:43] the promise.
[24:45] And if the if the symptoms overwhelm
[24:47] you, then you've got to look at them
[24:49] like Jonah that these are lying vanities
[24:51] or you won't have mercy come from the
[24:52] Lord. You won't have a deliverance. So
[24:54] remember that there's no way to keep
[24:56] observing and looking at the symptoms
[24:58] and get a prayer through. Only one way
[25:00] to pray. Look at only God's promise and
[25:03] your right to ask for that promise.
[25:06] Number four, I'm trying to wrap it up
[25:08] here. In his prayer, Jonah offered up
[25:10] the voice of thanksgiving. He says, "But
[25:13] I will sacrifice unto thee with a voice
[25:16] of thanksgiving."
[25:19] I will pay that that I have vowed,
[25:21] salvation of the Lord. So now, he poured
[25:24] on the praise. He poured on the
[25:26] thanksgiving. Yes. Some have said,
[25:29] "Bring the praise first. Bring the
[25:31] worship first." I got a petition to
[25:34] bring, Brother Paul. That's so huge. I
[25:37] got to get over feeling unworthy. I've
[25:39] got to bring this before the throne of
[25:40] God. But you know what? Here's a secret.
[25:42] Start with praise first. Start being
[25:45] thankful first. Something happens when
[25:48] we bring the praise first. That's right.
[25:51] Something happens when we shout it out.
[25:53] Oh yeah, that's right. Hallelujah. Can
[25:54] you say amen?
[25:56] Something happened when he took six days
[25:58] and have him march around the Jericho
[26:00] for six days in silence and on the
[26:03] seventh day let out a shout of praise.
[26:06] Something happens. The walls of Jericho
[26:08] come down. Something happens when we
[26:11] worship first. That's why he said when
[26:13] he teach us to pray our father who art
[26:15] in heaven hallowed be thy name. You know
[26:18] what that is? Worship first before I ask
[26:21] for something. I'm going to bring
[26:22] adoration. I'm going to bring praise.
[26:25] Holy is your name, Lord. Hallelujah.
[26:27] That's right. Jonah. Jonah down there in
[26:29] that fish. He says, "You know what I'm
[26:30] going to do right now? I'm going to
[26:32] bring a shout of praise. Praise. Worship
[26:35] first. Bring your adoration first." You
[26:37] know, we're we're funny with the right.
[26:38] And I'm teaching sons and daughters of
[26:40] God how to how to pray in the right
[26:42] approach to prayer because quite often
[26:44] we go directly for the juggler. We go
[26:47] directly to the need because it's so
[26:49] urgent to us. Why don't you try praising
[26:51] him first? Why don't you try thanking
[26:53] him for a million things?
[26:56] But you try that first cuz then God
[26:58] looks down at this grateful heart that's
[27:00] saying, "Lord, really, I know you'll
[27:02] deliver me, but I want to take this
[27:04] moment just to thank you for what you
[27:06] have done in my life." Talk about some
[27:08] results. Number six, when God stepped
[27:12] in, he spoke to the fish. He can reverse
[27:15] and speak to anything and anyone at any
[27:17] time to deliver a believer. How many
[27:19] believe that? When you have no voice,
[27:22] let him speak for you. Talk about a
[27:25] prayer that got results. I'll tell you
[27:27] the prayer got results because God was
[27:31] able to step in and spoke to the fish.
[27:33] Number seven, in his situation, he had
[27:36] to hold to the revelation that God was
[27:38] greater than the fish and the God in him
[27:41] was greater than the fish and could
[27:43] speak and redirect that fish. He held a
[27:46] revelation in his heart that God was
[27:48] able to do the impossible in this
[27:51] impossible situation. He was a man that
[27:54] was having a hard time, but he had to
[27:56] look beyond the surface into the
[27:59] substance of who he was as the son of
[28:01] God and he had to catch a revelation
[28:04] that the God in me is greater than this
[28:08] fish. Thank you for watching our service
