[2:02] we ask it in jesus name amen
[2:05] and amen and god bless you tonight and i
[2:08] want to invite you to your bible
[2:10] into the book of mark the 16th chapter
[2:13] i want to read for a text tonight and
[2:18] some things here that the lord had
[2:21] put on me uh back a little bit ago
[2:24] actually just
[2:24] was listening to a sermon and uh there's
[2:27] some inspiration came on me and
[2:29] in a certain need actually in the church
[2:32] and sometimes when you you preach
[2:34] something like that and you think well
[2:35] it's all finished you know that was the
[2:36] inspiration and then the holy spirit
[2:38] just starts adding some things to you
[2:40] and so tonight i want to continue
[2:43] something that i've been personally
[2:45] looking at and in the book of mark the
[2:47] 16th
[2:48] chapter and i want to read here from the
[2:52] the 15th verse
[2:56] now this is the great commission or the
[2:59] last commission
[3:00] that jesus gave the church you know he
[3:03] had gave one commission prior to this
[3:06] but this was uh the last words that he
[3:09] spoke
[3:10] brother brown would tell you that there
[3:12] in figuratively there was air under his
[3:14] feet
[3:14] while he was saying these things so it
[3:16] was the last thing that he had to say to
[3:18] his disciples
[3:19] here in the earth and he said unto them
[3:22] go ye unto the world
[3:25] and preach the gospel to every creature
[3:29] you know i think it's amazing no matter
[3:32] how times change or opinions change
[3:34] that reads the same today as it has
[3:38] always read
[3:39] isn't that beautiful go yeah unto the
[3:42] world
[3:43] and preach the gospel to every creature
[3:45] and he that believeth is to be baptized
[3:48] shall be saved but he that believeth not
[3:51] shall be damned
[3:52] and these signs shall follow them that
[3:54] believe
[3:55] for in my name they shall cast out
[3:58] devils
[3:59] they shall speak with new tongues they
[4:01] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[4:03] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[4:06] they shall lay hands upon the sick and
[4:09] they
[4:10] shall recover god bless the reading of
[4:13] his words you could be seated tonight
[4:16] and if i would take uh for a title
[4:17] tonight i'd like to speak to you just
[4:19] for a few moments
[4:20] uh upon this thought that you are
[4:24] in position for a miracle
[4:27] that you are in position for a miracle
[4:31] you know we're living in a season of
[4:33] time when people almost don't believe in
[4:35] miracles anymore
[4:37] that it's an age that doesn't believe in
[4:40] miracles doesn't believe that god still
[4:42] works in miraculous ways somehow
[4:45] man has become of the opinion that
[4:48] because times have changed
[4:49] somehow god has changed but one thing
[4:52] that we find that is definite from the
[4:54] scripture
[4:55] is that the lord says from the book of
[4:56] malachi that i am god
[4:59] and i change not so god has an
[5:02] unchanging way
[5:03] with an unchanging nature though he does
[5:05] change
[5:06] his mask though he does change his veil
[5:09] that he's behind
[5:11] but he never changes his nature
[5:14] he never changes who he is or what he
[5:17] can do
[5:18] because he always remains the almighty
[5:20] god
[5:21] to think tonight that we are able by
[5:23] grace to go through the name of jesus
[5:25] christ to approach
[5:26] the god that created the world we can
[5:29] speak through
[5:30] through the name of our lord to think
[5:32] tonight that we have the ability
[5:34] to approach this kind of god in a
[5:36] message of the paradox in 1963
[5:39] brother branham will tell us this he's
[5:40] going to preach the message paradox and
[5:42] does a good job
[5:43] in describing what a paradox is he said
[5:46] now according to webster a paradox is
[5:48] something that seems incredible
[5:50] but it's true therefore a paradox when
[5:53] it could be the same
[5:54] as a miracle a paradox is when something
[5:57] that seems like that it couldn't be
[6:00] he says the knowledge of a human mind is
[6:03] altogether incredible
[6:04] but yet it's proven to be true now a
[6:07] miracle would be the same thing for a
[6:09] miracle cannot be explained
[6:11] a miracle is something that happens and
[6:14] you cannot explain it
[6:16] that makes it a paradox it's incredible
[6:20] but yet
[6:21] it's the truth isn't it amazing
[6:23] something that is just
[6:25] incredible to the human mind but it's
[6:27] just true
[6:28] and it's it's an indisputable truth it's
[6:30] an it's
[6:31] it's a it's an unexplainable truth but
[6:33] yet it's true
[6:35] and now people today a lot of modernists
[6:37] believe that the days of miracles are
[6:38] past and they don't believe there is
[6:40] such a thing a miracle but yet
[6:42] i believe that the world is full of
[6:44] miracles i believe the paradox is
[6:46] constantly
[6:48] again in the message paradox brother
[6:49] braham says i believe that every
[6:51] born-again member
[6:52] of the body of christ is a paradox in
[6:54] themselves
[6:55] i believe that each one of you
[6:56] methodists and presbyterians and
[6:58] lutherans
[6:59] you that had experienced never had
[7:01] experienced the baptism of the holy
[7:02] ghost
[7:03] it was in some formal church didn't even
[7:06] believe in a genuine new birth
[7:08] but now you've received the baptism of
[7:10] the holy ghost
[7:11] it is a perfect example of a paradox
[7:15] isn't that beautiful that the prophet
[7:17] uses you and your experience with god
[7:20] as a perfect example of a paradox you
[7:23] might not have knew this but i hope you
[7:24] take this home tonight you are
[7:26] a perfect example of paradox amen the
[7:29] world
[7:30] it's incredible to believe this but it's
[7:32] absolutely true
[7:34] that the gospel of jesus christ can
[7:36] thoroughly
[7:37] change an individual that it can change
[7:39] the nature it can change the soul of an
[7:41] individual even change its habits
[7:44] its choices its decisions because god
[7:47] can do it it's incredible that it can
[7:49] happen but it remains to be true
[7:51] because it's a paradox it is a new birth
[7:54] or brother bam says a perfect example of
[7:57] paradox because something has happened
[7:59] to you
[7:59] that changed your whole being and anyone
[8:02] that could look at you
[8:03] and know what a paradox is it is a
[8:06] miracle give me a little bit in my side
[8:08] box here and i'll adjust it
[8:10] as is needed uh unless this happens you
[8:14] cannot be a christian
[8:15] there must be a paradox for you to
[8:17] become a christian
[8:18] because no one can change a spirit in a
[8:21] man and give him a new birth outside of
[8:23] god
[8:23] god alone is the only one can do it it's
[8:25] a miracle how that god can take a man's
[8:27] thinking
[8:28] and his ways and his life and everything
[8:30] and change it from what it was
[8:33] to what it can be amen what he can make
[8:37] it
[8:37] isn't that beautiful amen sitting here
[8:39] out here tonight maybe some of you will
[8:40] say
[8:41] well brother wayne i'm not what i want
[8:42] to be but you would have to agree to say
[8:45] we're not what we used to be you you
[8:47] might not
[8:48] know me the potential fully of what
[8:51] god's going to do with you and you might
[8:52] say well i'm not happy with who i
[8:54] am i'm not what i want to be but then
[8:56] you have to go back in your life and you
[8:58] say but i'm certainly not
[8:59] who i was or what i was then what made
[9:02] you something different
[9:04] was not just a an intellectual
[9:06] conception
[9:07] but it was a change that god brought to
[9:10] you perfectly describing what a paradox
[9:12] is
[9:13] is it's incredible that there's been
[9:15] change but that change come through the
[9:16] supernatural god
[9:18] bringing you this paradox brother madam
[9:20] will say it like this he says see
[9:22] he if you're identified as a believer
[9:24] with believers
[9:25] but until someone is regenerated or born
[9:27] again
[9:28] he says now he's talking about a man he
[9:29] said i'd advise a boy to never marry you
[9:31] all heard brother brown tell a story
[9:33] about a certain family bringing a boy to
[9:35] brother branham and it was talking about
[9:36] the parents were saying there's
[9:38] something wrong with him
[9:39] that he's a good boy he goes to church
[9:40] with us he said but but he's not able to
[9:42] forgive people he
[9:44] has a hard spirit he ain't able to
[9:45] forgive he's kind of stubborn he
[9:47] he's and brother brown begins to discern
[9:49] him he said well i'll tell you he said
[9:50] y'all come from a german people and
[9:52] and uh you you have a certain background
[9:55] and it's it's a stubborn thing he said
[9:57] but you but you and your family he said
[9:59] notice how
[10:00] that god got a hold of you and that all
[10:02] changed one day
[10:03] he said but now this boy though he comes
[10:05] from your family he's never had the
[10:07] change you had
[10:09] he said until he does get that change
[10:11] he'll not make a good husband to any
[10:13] woman
[10:13] he'll ruin some girl's life he said but
[10:16] now what he needs
[10:17] is an experience with god he needs a new
[10:19] birth and that new birth would be a
[10:21] paradox amen
[10:22] that's that's what is the change of a
[10:25] life that's what makes a good wife that
[10:27] makes
[10:28] a good husband amen is when somebody has
[10:30] a paradox let me let me give you uh let
[10:32] me give you a little word tonight just
[10:34] so you
[10:34] don't forget this you're never going to
[10:36] be an angel
[10:38] amen you're never going to be an angel
[10:40] you're always going to be a human and
[10:41] brother braham gave us a shocking moment
[10:43] when he said to me
[10:44] he says that you have a man on the
[10:47] outside
[10:47] who said he's got a sticky nature of a
[10:50] kakabur
[10:51] and it'll be with you to the body change
[10:53] is that right
[10:54] amen so you're always going to be a
[10:56] human and with the human failures is
[10:58] going to
[10:58] going to complex your life and there's
[11:00] going to be troubles always
[11:02] amen but if there's ever been a new
[11:04] birth and there's a way to correct that
[11:05] nature
[11:06] there's something on the inside that'll
[11:08] say y'all that's not right and you'll
[11:09] apologize
[11:10] and you'll go to an altar and you'll
[11:12] repent and you'll say will you forgive
[11:14] me
[11:14] but if there's nothing in you to ask
[11:16] forgiveness then there's something wrong
[11:17] with your nature
[11:19] if there's nothing in you to admit when
[11:20] you're wrong when it comes to the word
[11:22] of god there's something wrong with the
[11:23] nature
[11:24] amen but if god ever gets a hold of an
[11:26] individual there's something inside of
[11:28] that individual
[11:29] that will control their emotions to the
[11:31] word of god
[11:32] it'll control their opinions to the word
[11:34] of god it
[11:36] is completely a paradox to see an
[11:38] individual humble themselves in the age
[11:40] we're living in
[11:41] but if anybody ever had the new birth
[11:43] they know that it will call
[11:45] amen a person to come to that place with
[11:47] god
[11:50] amen it's a paradox now amen i don't
[11:53] know if you have a separate knob on this
[11:55] side
[11:56] on this side but if you can't give it to
[11:57] me and i'll control it from this volume
[11:59] button
[12:00] amen do you see what it is it's a
[12:02] paradox now back in the days of moa
[12:04] brother madam says see he says now it
[12:06] was a hard thing for noah
[12:08] he says see but in a great intellectual
[12:10] age that he lived in
[12:12] he was trying to tell people by a word
[12:14] of god that something how it was going
[12:16] to rain now you talk about paradoxes
[12:18] that was a great paradox in the days of
[12:20] noah and
[12:21] in the time of law he lived in an
[12:24] absolute
[12:25] scientific age now brother branham
[12:27] explains to us how they have things
[12:29] then that we don't even haven't even got
[12:31] to now amen
[12:33] and and the world was destroyed somehow
[12:35] right and the prophet teaches us it was
[12:36] atomic
[12:37] warfare that caused the rain to come
[12:40] down upon the earth so there was a great
[12:42] advanced civilization
[12:43] in science they were advanced amen and
[12:47] when you look at the bible it says as it
[12:48] was in the days of noah now
[12:50] that wasn't speaking about the angels or
[12:52] the burning of the earth such it was in
[12:54] the days of abraham but speaking of the
[12:56] immorality
[12:57] and speaking of the knowledge and the
[12:59] science of the days of noah
[13:01] and to think as it was in the days of
[13:03] noah so shall it be in the coming of the
[13:05] son of man so in a
[13:06] wicked and adulterous age an evil age
[13:09] when evil is upon
[13:10] the mind of every person in such an age
[13:13] like that
[13:14] the bible tells us that noah found grace
[13:16] in the eyes of the lord
[13:18] isn't that awesome that noah found grace
[13:20] in the eyes of such an evil time
[13:22] he found that grace in the eyes of god
[13:25] in other words god could speak to noah
[13:27] that's where real grace
[13:28] is in your life by the way it's when god
[13:31] comes to an individual and he speaks to
[13:33] you
[13:33] concerning your need or your situation
[13:35] had god not spoke to noah noah would
[13:38] have been like everybody else in that
[13:39] age
[13:40] but because god gave him grace god spoke
[13:43] to him
[13:44] and gave noah a message of grace in an
[13:47] age
[13:48] of destruction and because he found a
[13:50] righteousness in noah
[13:52] god was not going to destroy the
[13:54] righteous with the wicked
[13:55] and he made a way of escape amen i'm
[13:58] glad tonight to know that god
[14:00] never changed his way and to know that
[14:02] in an age when the world's about to fall
[14:04] apart that once again
[14:05] god by grace as it was in the days of
[14:08] noah
[14:09] he sends a message of grace to a
[14:12] generation
[14:12] if we had not received a word from god
[14:15] the bible said the blind is leading the
[14:18] blind
[14:18] and they're all going to the ditch so
[14:20] we're not trying to lift ourselves up
[14:22] and say look who we are
[14:24] but we're trying to lift up a message
[14:26] and say thank god for the grace of god
[14:28] that come down in our lives had he not
[14:30] come into your life where would you be
[14:32] sitting this morning
[14:33] what what kind of church would this be
[14:35] today what kind of ministry would would
[14:37] i brother paul have today
[14:39] but because of the grace of god amen we
[14:42] have a message in this
[14:43] hour to believe and give us a way of
[14:45] escaping a time
[14:47] a time of judgment that's upon the earth
[14:50] amen but god
[14:51] did something a certain way in that day
[14:53] that he's going to do in this day
[14:55] and you know what he did he sent message
[14:57] of
[14:58] noah unscientifically proven
[15:01] into a scientific age can you imagine
[15:03] noah
[15:04] only having the word of the lord in the
[15:07] face of science
[15:08] in the face of all their instruments all
[15:10] the man had was the word of the lord
[15:12] amen he had come in contact with god
[15:15] and he knew the direct will of god for
[15:18] the earth he knew destruction was coming
[15:20] he knew the rain was going to fill the
[15:22] earth he knew he was going to build an
[15:23] ark
[15:24] and he knew all of that by revelation
[15:26] and couldn't prove a thing to nobody
[15:28] they either had to believe him or not
[15:31] believe him
[15:32] he either had to believe the word or
[15:34] they didn't believe the word
[15:35] noah could not prove to them by their
[15:38] intellect
[15:38] what he was saying was the truth but god
[15:41] did it that way
[15:42] because god was going to do it again in
[15:44] the last days
[15:45] he was going to send a message of grace
[15:48] to an age of evil
[15:49] and he was going to send a messenger
[15:51] with an intellectual message
[15:54] in the middle of an intellectual age and
[15:57] he wasn't going to be able to prove his
[15:59] message by the intellectual
[16:01] thoughts of man but he would have the
[16:03] word of the lord
[16:05] my when i think about god he gives us a
[16:07] 20 20 mirror that we can look backward
[16:09] today
[16:10] our vision should be 20 20. everybody
[16:12] can say that right
[16:13] amen a rear view mirror is 20 20 is that
[16:16] right
[16:17] so we ought to be able to perfectly see
[16:18] what's coming by what has been we ought
[16:21] to be able to see the reflections
[16:23] of prophecy and the age that we're
[16:25] living in now
[16:26] no a preacher of righteousness preached
[16:28] the message 120 years
[16:30] and they didn't repent and they didn't
[16:32] believe but god
[16:34] had somebody he knew would receive that
[16:37] word
[16:37] god would never send a message unless it
[16:39] was a believer to believe it
[16:42] oh my i think it's amazing that god
[16:45] actually
[16:45] god actually had them amen he actually
[16:48] had them to build that ark
[16:50] and i've always marveled at this amen
[16:53] that god gave noah the measurements
[16:54] before noah ever preached his first
[16:56] sermon
[16:58] he had his measurements he knew exactly
[17:00] who would get on that ark
[17:02] he knew exactly how big it was going to
[17:04] be god knew the number of animals and he
[17:06] knew the number of humans that was going
[17:08] to believe that word
[17:09] because they were already ordained to be
[17:11] believers in the generation that they
[17:13] were living in
[17:14] and i'll tell you this if god has
[17:15] ordained a man and a woman to believe
[17:17] this word
[17:18] amen you will receive it by the
[17:20] preaching of the message of the
[17:22] hour it doesn't matter how many
[17:24] intellectuals
[17:25] it doesn't matter how many scientists
[17:27] could stand and say i don't believe it's
[17:29] true it makes no difference to a
[17:31] believer because they have come in
[17:33] contact with god
[17:35] and they know god is a marker of a
[17:37] paradox
[17:38] and that's what no one knew no one knew
[17:40] a paradox was coming
[17:42] because he had met a god of a paradox
[17:44] and he knew it was incredible
[17:46] but he knew his message was true so he
[17:48] preached that message and he preached it
[17:50] to unbelievers
[17:51] and he preached it to believers and he
[17:53] preached it to skeptics and some days
[17:56] he preached it real loud and some days
[17:58] he preached it real soft
[18:00] and some days he sung about it and some
[18:02] days he beat drums and talked about it
[18:04] but the message never changed amen it
[18:07] doesn't matter
[18:08] whether it's high or low or whether it's
[18:10] soft or loud
[18:11] it's the message of god and it's your
[18:14] true word
[18:14] and the age that we're living in this
[18:16] message will take you in a rapture
[18:19] amen god ain't changed his way he had
[18:21] everybody that got on that ark had to
[18:23] come by noah
[18:25] now that the people that age didn't like
[18:27] it because they didn't like noah
[18:28] they didn't believe the messenger so
[18:30] they didn't believe the message
[18:31] and they didn't want to get on that ark
[18:33] because they had to come to that man to
[18:34] get on there
[18:36] isn't that something that's the same
[18:37] spirit that's in the age we're in
[18:39] amen well i've been told for years amen
[18:42] well y'all just
[18:43] believe it if somebody is going to be
[18:44] saved they got to believe this man
[18:46] william branham well
[18:47] amen you don't really know what we teach
[18:49] much by saying that then
[18:50] because we believe there's different
[18:52] classes of people by the bible
[18:54] we believe there's a foolish virgin we
[18:56] know there's people that'll make it
[18:57] there
[18:57] who actually never even was a new birth
[18:59] but they will do it because they were
[19:01] good to the bride it's written in
[19:02] matthew 25
[19:04] until there's different classes of
[19:05] people that's going to be in heaven
[19:07] because the blood of jesus christ amen
[19:09] can cover who he wants to
[19:11] amen but he made a way and if you're
[19:14] going to be in the rapture in the last
[19:16] day
[19:16] you'll not get there any other way than
[19:19] the message of the hour
[19:20] you'll have to come by a prophet if
[19:23] you're going to get into the rapture of
[19:24] the church
[19:26] where did noah stand he stood right at
[19:27] the door
[19:29] he preached his message from the door
[19:31] and you came by that door
[19:32] or you didn't get on the ark amen i
[19:34] didn't write the bible
[19:36] i'm just responsible for preaching it he
[19:38] said they had to come by noah
[19:40] and the door of this age is the message
[19:42] of the hour it's christ
[19:44] and there was a prophet standing there
[19:47] and if you want to get
[19:50] as you're not going to get there
[19:52] otherwise you're not going to get where
[19:54] you want to go
[19:55] i don't know about you all but the world
[19:56] is falling apart and i do
[19:58] not want to stay in this layout to see
[20:01] you i do not want to be
[20:02] here when the tribulations begin to fall
[20:05] i
[20:06] want to be standing in the grace of god
[20:09] in such an hour like the time that we're
[20:11] living now
[20:12] think about this just a moment amen ask
[20:14] yourself this who went in the new world
[20:16] after the flood
[20:17] who went in the new world who went into
[20:19] the world after the judgments was gone
[20:21] and the water was off
[20:22] who lived in that new world whoever got
[20:24] on that boat
[20:26] amen so a step into the boat was a step
[20:29] into another world
[20:30] a step into that boat was a step out of
[20:33] judgments into the grace of god
[20:35] and if you're ready to get out of the
[20:37] judgments of laodicea
[20:39] come on and step in with the word of god
[20:42] of your age
[20:42] and let the grace of god cover you with
[20:45] the power
[20:45] of the word and the age that we're
[20:47] living in i don't have enough time
[20:49] tonight to
[20:50] get into all the details of noah but i'd
[20:52] like to pull this point out of this
[20:54] he done it by the word of the lord he
[20:57] told him by the word of the lord
[20:59] that's all he had but according to god
[21:01] that's all a man needs
[21:03] he needs to know the word of the lord i
[21:06] don't need to know whatever doctor
[21:07] teaches about the book of matthew
[21:09] i do not need to know what every
[21:11] assembly thinks about malachi 4.
[21:14] i've got to know what does the lamb
[21:15] think what does the word say
[21:18] and there we will abide and stand upon
[21:20] the word
[21:21] because there is where your power is
[21:25] hey man i i know in the last days a lot
[21:27] of people are caught up in
[21:28] in a lot of things and i can't help all
[21:30] that but amen some people say well
[21:32] brother wayne wouldn't some denomination
[21:33] be okay
[21:34] well it's according whether you believe
[21:35] the message or not if you believe a
[21:37] prophet he said flee it like the plague
[21:39] it's the mark of the beast
[21:42] according to brother branham he said
[21:44] rome has two churches
[21:46] catholics and protestants two churches
[21:49] amen catholics and denominations there's
[21:52] a
[21:53] and the daughters of it and the same
[21:55] system is operated by the same
[21:56] antichrist spirit but if god's going to
[21:58] do something in your generation
[22:00] he's going to send a prophet he's going
[22:02] to send the word
[22:03] by prophet and that prophetic word will
[22:06] be the deliverance of
[22:07] every individual that hears it amen and
[22:09] it will be what it is whether i think so
[22:11] or you think so or anybody else thinks
[22:13] so
[22:14] amen the message of the hour is not
[22:16] subject to opinion
[22:18] it's not subject to the judgments of
[22:20] what man says it is or what they say it
[22:22] ain't
[22:23] its message of the hour has already been
[22:25] certified
[22:26] and vindicated as being the word of god
[22:29] in the age that we're living
[22:30] in my i believe that we're standing on a
[22:34] rock brother paul
[22:36] amen amen that's what noah or it's what
[22:39] paul
[22:40] what david was praying that god would
[22:42] put him on a rock
[22:45] it would have been quite a hard thing
[22:46] for noah to preach that kind of word
[22:49] to that kind of people but noah did it
[22:54] isn't it beautiful that noah suffered a
[22:56] reproach for the word of god
[22:58] but he did it because he had been in
[22:59] contact with god
[23:01] and people thought noah was foolish but
[23:03] honestly ask yourself who's full of you
[23:07] ask yourself who's fuller are you going
[23:09] to be
[23:10] people say to me all the time so will
[23:12] y'all follow a man i have to stop and
[23:14] ask him about what presbyterian church
[23:15] are you from anyhow
[23:17] or what baptist what baptist church are
[23:20] you affiliated with
[23:21] or what what denomination are you
[23:23] affiliated with if you ain't done your
[23:24] homework denomination comes from a group
[23:26] of men
[23:27] deciding what doctrine is and they
[23:30] approve that doctrine by their
[23:31] fellowship
[23:32] and you're brought into that doctrine by
[23:34] this trinitarian baptism
[23:36] and you're actually baptized into the
[23:37] fellowship of a roman church whether you
[23:39] know it or not
[23:42] that's the truth according to the bible
[23:44] but if god's going to bring a word
[23:46] he's going to do it through a prophet
[23:48] and that prophet will speak for
[23:50] god then there is a group of people on
[23:52] the earth that's not following a man
[23:54] we're actually following the pillar of
[23:56] fire that led moses out of the
[23:58] wilderness and put them in a promised
[24:00] land
[24:01] oh church i don't know if we have the
[24:02] picture here i guess we don't have it
[24:04] amen but there's a picture brother
[24:05] random of the pillar of fire over his
[24:07] head
[24:07] hey man i want you to if you ever look
[24:09] at that picture i want y'all to know
[24:11] something that picture
[24:12] is not with brother branham with a
[24:13] pillar of fire under his arm
[24:15] it's not with a pillar of fire under his
[24:17] feet amen the pillar of fire is over his
[24:19] head
[24:20] because it was what was leading him it
[24:23] was what was directing him
[24:25] he come out and said the first seal he
[24:27] said the horse rider i thought it was
[24:29] i thought it was christ he said but he
[24:31] stopped me in the back room and said it
[24:33] was the antichrist
[24:34] do you see that brother branham was not
[24:36] asking a group of men what it was
[24:38] but the angel of the lord was stopping
[24:41] him telling him what the revelation was
[24:44] so who are you following them this
[24:45] evening we have not followed a man
[24:48] we have not followed cunning devices of
[24:50] fables we are eyewitnesses of the
[24:52] majesty of the word of god that is
[24:54] coming to the age
[24:55] that we're living in my he told them by
[24:58] the word of the lord
[24:59] my he preached to souls that were in
[25:01] prison he was a righteous preacher
[25:04] he preached to them but they repented
[25:05] not but he preached it anyhow
[25:09] he preached the word anyhow because it
[25:11] was the truth and it remains to be the
[25:13] truth
[25:14] do you see what it was amen it was a
[25:16] paradox
[25:17] it was a paradox when the rain began to
[25:19] come incredible but true
[25:23] but noah had seen noah had seen it
[25:26] 120 years before it happened
[25:29] noah's seen it 120 years by vision and
[25:32] contact from god
[25:34] and when he saw it and and believed it
[25:36] noah
[25:37] began to preach it and to them that
[25:39] heard the word and believed it saul
[25:42] they literally saw the flood by the
[25:44] hearing of the word
[25:46] isn't that awesome that they saw it by
[25:49] the word then they
[25:50] they didn't see it but their natural lie
[25:52] they saw it by the word because they had
[25:54] believed what was being preached
[25:56] uh something really changed up here on
[25:58] the platform guys it went south up here
[26:00] amen do you see what it is you see amen
[26:02] that it rained and it was a paradox
[26:05] now you see if god can took his word and
[26:07] can perform a paradox
[26:09] he can perform a miracle any man that's
[26:11] born of that same spirit performs
[26:13] miracles
[26:14] it's an easy thing for him to believe in
[26:15] miracles because he is a part of god now
[26:18] it's coming back
[26:19] because he is a part of god now a son or
[26:21] daughter of god not by denomination not
[26:23] by creed but by the hand
[26:24] not by a handshake but by birth that you
[26:27] have died to your own intellects to be
[26:29] born of the spirit of god
[26:30] and you're a paradox yourself how that
[26:32] you've been changed from death unto life
[26:34] out of your innermost being is a new
[26:36] creation in christ
[26:38] this is not a historical god god is
[26:41] still doing this
[26:43] god is still causing this do you see
[26:45] what he's saying to you
[26:46] if you're a paradox it's not hard for
[26:48] you to believe in a paradox
[26:51] but if you're not a paradox it's hard to
[26:52] believe in paradox
[26:54] if you're a paradox yourself it's not a
[26:56] trouble to believe
[26:58] that these bodies are going to be
[26:59] changed before they hit the ground
[27:01] to think that the generation we're
[27:03] living in that there is a people that's
[27:05] going to change their bodies while
[27:08] they're yet alive
[27:09] my sometimes i just sit down and look at
[27:12] the world and the chaos
[27:13] and i think about the old grave out
[27:15] there and i'm reminded of a promise
[27:17] amen where paul said some of you shall
[27:20] not sleep
[27:21] but some shall be changed in the moment
[27:23] in the twinkling of an eye
[27:25] amen now think about that because you're
[27:28] hearing that
[27:29] but i cannot scientifically prove to you
[27:31] that's true
[27:34] i cannot intellectually prove to you
[27:36] that that's going to happen in the age
[27:38] we're living in
[27:39] but i can say what paul said by the word
[27:43] of the lord
[27:44] i say unto you by the word of the lord
[27:48] you see what paulie and paul preached
[27:49] the paradox of rapture
[27:51] he preached it by the word of the lord
[27:55] you see noah preached it by the word of
[27:57] the lord paul preached it by the word of
[27:59] the lord in other words what paul was
[28:01] saying
[28:02] was not absolutely uh reading scripture
[28:05] verbatim paul was not just reading
[28:07] isaiah
[28:08] or he wasn't just reading something that
[28:10] malachi said
[28:11] but paul read a little bit of isaiah and
[28:13] he read a little bit of malachi
[28:15] and a little bit of genesis and he read
[28:17] a little bit of ezekiel
[28:19] and god gave him a revelation that the
[28:21] things that had happened
[28:23] was going to culminate in a future age
[28:25] and there would be both a resurrection
[28:27] and a rapture take place at the same
[28:29] time
[28:30] you see he's seen that by revelation and
[28:33] preached it by the word of the lord
[28:35] he said by the word of the lord some of
[28:37] you shall not sleep but you shall be
[28:39] changed there's coming up generation
[28:41] that will not hinder this paradox
[28:43] there's coming a generation that will
[28:45] believe
[28:46] into the place of a paradox taking place
[28:49] in their life
[28:49] you say by the way what have i got to do
[28:51] to get in the rapture you got to believe
[28:53] that god is
[28:54] you got to believe that god can and that
[28:57] god will
[28:58] and he's doing it by his word my
[29:01] to think by the time they saw what noah
[29:03] saw it was too late for them to get in
[29:06] and today we preach rapture but we
[29:08] preach it by revelation
[29:10] and that revelation is to those who can
[29:13] believe
[29:14] that revelation has already begun to be
[29:16] open for paul said for the lord himself
[29:18] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[29:19] with the voice of the archangel the
[29:21] trump of god
[29:22] and the dead in christ shall rise do you
[29:24] see what it was
[29:25] noah was preaching his own paradox do
[29:28] you see what's happening today
[29:29] there's a people preaching their own
[29:31] paradox
[29:32] amen brother paul you're preaching your
[29:34] own body change
[29:35] you're prophesying your way into a new
[29:38] body can you imagine that that we are
[29:40] preaching our new body
[29:42] word by word we are prophesying what is
[29:45] about to take place in the age
[29:47] and i cannot scientifically prove matter
[29:49] of fact my body's getting older
[29:52] my body's getting weaker everything that
[29:54] we say
[29:55] is absolutely unscientifically true
[29:58] but by the word of the lord there is a
[30:01] change taking place
[30:03] amen there is a word that is prophesying
[30:05] over our lives
[30:09] by revelation do you see what it is it's
[30:11] a change
[30:12] when the word of god is spoken there is
[30:14] a change
[30:15] there is a significant change
[30:17] insignificant to the world
[30:18] significant to god
[30:21] when jesus sat under the tree and he
[30:23] cursed it no change at all
[30:25] wait till tomorrow by the word of the
[30:28] lord he cursed the tree the next day
[30:30] they sing the change
[30:32] look at look at the prophecies of the
[30:33] word how the la's going to sink don't
[30:36] look like a change does it
[30:37] but when it happens it happens when it
[30:40] takes place
[30:41] it manifests itself by the word of the
[30:44] lord see
[30:44] see three things are going to happen how
[30:46] many realizes the shout of first
[30:48] thessalonians 4 is the message of
[30:50] brother branham
[30:52] amen it's the first thessalonians 4 is
[30:54] the shout it's the message
[30:55] so you can see then the first portion of
[30:58] rapture
[30:58] is the word of the lord it's the message
[31:02] coming to the church
[31:03] and if you're a paradox you receive it
[31:05] as a paradox prophecy over your life
[31:08] do you see what it is it changes the
[31:10] cycle from a death cycle to a rapture
[31:13] cycle
[31:14] from the death cycle that sitting in the
[31:16] garden of eden by a word unbelieved
[31:19] by one word being fail the whole earth
[31:22] was plunged
[31:23] by one woman's disobedience everybody
[31:25] was plunged to death
[31:26] but at the end time there's another eve
[31:30] who's not disbelieving but believing
[31:33] and if disbelief could take all of that
[31:35] away from a person
[31:37] then couldn't believe in the word give
[31:39] it all back
[31:40] can you imagine this is an age of
[31:42] restoration
[31:44] where god said i shall restore saith the
[31:47] lord
[31:48] now you like your bible as well as i do
[31:51] first corinthians says
[31:52] that this is actually a mystery of what
[31:54] god's going to do
[31:56] now we know being a mystery it locks up
[31:58] the rapture right
[32:00] locks it up to the last age because if
[32:02] it's a mystery
[32:03] how many knows the bible predicts that
[32:05] god won't do anything until first he
[32:07] sends a prophet
[32:09] amos the third chapter the seventh verse
[32:11] surely the lord our god will do nothing
[32:14] until first he sends a prophet not even
[32:16] a rapture
[32:18] he seals the rapture no matter through
[32:21] the ages
[32:22] they could pray and fast they could
[32:24] desire to see the change but it was not
[32:26] the season of change
[32:28] but the season of a rapture would come
[32:31] with a prophetic word
[32:33] and the word and the rapture would be
[32:35] synonymous coming together because it
[32:37] takes the word to break the chains
[32:40] to change to bring paradox it takes the
[32:42] word
[32:45] in amos the third chapter it says that
[32:47] there has to be a prophet
[32:49] in revelations 10 the end of the bible
[32:51] it says the mighty angel will come out
[32:53] of heaven
[32:53] with an open book in his hand is that
[32:56] right
[32:57] that open book would be the word of the
[32:58] lord to the age and dispensation we're
[33:01] living in
[33:01] which would happen to be the seven seal
[33:03] book of redemption from the beginning of
[33:05] time
[33:07] and would be unfolded in your season
[33:10] that you're living think about this
[33:12] god is releasing this not in somebody
[33:15] else's age
[33:16] but in your season in the age of
[33:19] rapture there comes a message of rapture
[33:23] amen to think that that change is taking
[33:26] place
[33:27] by the word that is spoken over you in
[33:29] revelations 10
[33:30] it tells us that that book would not be
[33:33] a different book than the bible
[33:35] i believe we can say that because it
[33:37] said the mystery of god which would be
[33:38] revealed
[33:40] which has been spoken to the servants
[33:42] the prophets
[33:43] so in revelations 10 7 it predicts it
[33:46] will be an opening of the bible the
[33:47] mysteries of the bible would become made
[33:49] known
[33:50] in that season then it would be the word
[33:53] that revelations 10
[33:54] 7 would be bringing to the church and if
[33:56] it's the word it can only come through a
[33:58] prophet
[33:59] amen i think that's established we all
[34:01] believe that amen but it's beautiful
[34:04] because there's a prophet prophesied for
[34:06] this season
[34:07] in malachi the fourth chapter it said
[34:09] behold i sinned unto you elijah before
[34:11] the great and dreadful day of the lord
[34:14] some people try to place that back in
[34:16] the days of jesus but acts 3 20 gets in
[34:19] your way because it said the bibles must
[34:21] receive
[34:21] jesus until the restitution of all
[34:24] things
[34:25] so we know it did not take place in the
[34:27] days of jesus
[34:28] but restitution was in the future
[34:31] restitution would be
[34:32] under the prophecy of joel the second
[34:34] chapter
[34:35] i shall restore saith the lord
[34:38] everything that has been taken shall be
[34:40] given
[34:40] back to the church again so malachi 4
[34:43] would be a restoration ministry
[34:46] is that right it would be an hour of
[34:48] grace to the church
[34:50] to restore something back to perfection
[34:52] if you ever think about
[34:54] malachi 4 and how it's written i know
[34:56] you know your bible so i'm not going to
[34:57] turn and read
[34:58] but you know the bible says i want you
[35:00] to remember the law
[35:02] i want you to remember moses on mount
[35:04] horeb i want you to remember that but
[35:07] i'm going to send you elijah
[35:08] isn't that beautiful i want you to
[35:10] remember moses but i'm going to send you
[35:12] elijah
[35:14] how many ever studied moses's time when
[35:17] he come off of the mountain with a veil
[35:19] on his face
[35:21] if you if you if you watch the scripture
[35:22] he said a prophet like moses go back and
[35:24] read
[35:25] and find out in the unveiling of god
[35:27] when paul's talking about it in 2nd
[35:28] corinthians 3 he's talking about
[35:30] moses being veiled with a veil over his
[35:32] face
[35:33] but you know that don't happen on moses
[35:35] his first trip off the mountain
[35:37] it happens the second trip because the
[35:39] first trip moses has been in the
[35:41] presence of god receives the ten
[35:43] commandments
[35:43] he comes off of the mountain and
[35:45] actually under anger because of the
[35:47] shape the people is in
[35:49] moses broke the first word by throwing
[35:51] the tablets of stone
[35:53] and the word was broken into pieces now
[35:55] let me ask you who can recover what had
[35:57] been broken
[35:59] who could god wrote it but the written
[36:01] word that god had given from his own
[36:03] finger
[36:04] was now laying broken on the ground tell
[36:06] me what presbyterian could put it back
[36:08] together
[36:09] what lutheran could place it put it back
[36:11] together it had been broken and who
[36:13] could restore it but the one that wrote
[36:15] it
[36:16] but the bible said moses went back upon
[36:18] the mountain for the second time
[36:20] and he prayed unto god and said god if
[36:22] there is grace
[36:24] oh i love that word grace if there is
[36:26] grace restore
[36:27] unto us lord restore your word to us
[36:31] lord
[36:31] and god wrote that word again exactly
[36:35] like
[36:35] it had been in the beginning and moses
[36:38] come down under a veil
[36:39] in that beautiful mosaic second trip
[36:42] down
[36:43] that's where the veil was and in the end
[36:45] time god would send the same spirit
[36:47] that was upon moses but it would be
[36:50] under a veil
[36:51] of elijah ministry amen watch this not
[36:54] two different men
[36:55] but the same spirit restoring the word
[36:58] moses and elijah by the authority of
[37:01] god's word
[37:02] listen church this message we're
[37:04] believing ain't just some mamsey pamsy
[37:07] idea
[37:08] come out of some kentuckian this is the
[37:10] word
[37:11] a prophecy for the age that we're living
[37:14] in this
[37:14] is rapture and anointing this is the
[37:17] power of god
[37:18] this is how you're going to get out this
[37:20] is the way you're going to
[37:22] break out of the age you're living in
[37:24] you want to break out of this age
[37:26] this word is here to deliver you
[37:29] to make a way where there is no way
[37:33] prophesying there it went prophesying
[37:36] from a place
[37:37] amen where there has been nothing
[37:39] prophesying from it
[37:40] to think tonight amen that there it is
[37:43] in luke 17 he said he would restore
[37:46] the son of man would return is that what
[37:48] he said
[37:50] in ephesians 1 how many loves how paul
[37:51] writes it
[37:53] he said let us pray for wisdom and
[37:54] revelation is that what he said pray for
[37:57] wisdom in revelation
[37:58] william branham comes along and says
[38:00] pray for revelation
[38:02] more than anything else pray for
[38:03] revelation paul said pray for revelation
[38:06] why did he want you to pray for
[38:07] revelation he said that your eyes would
[38:09] be open
[38:10] that you may receive the spirit and the
[38:12] wisdom of god the revelation
[38:14] and the spirit of him the richness of
[38:16] wisdom and revelation
[38:18] and the eyes opening to think when god
[38:21] opens a man's eyes hey man think about
[38:24] when
[38:24] he opens your eyes you say bro if my
[38:26] eyes would come open what would i see
[38:28] have you ever thought about them boys
[38:30] walking in luke 24 who was walking with
[38:32] the resurrected christ and had no clue
[38:34] who was talking to him
[38:35] but when their eyes were opened they
[38:37] knew that was him
[38:39] a stranger become resurrected christ
[38:42] because the word he was preaching
[38:44] had revealed who he was my
[38:47] when i think about it today i think when
[38:50] their eyes were opened
[38:51] there was a revival their hearts began
[38:54] to burn
[38:55] because of the revelation of the season
[38:57] they were living in
[38:58] think about this people looking for
[39:00] revival everywhere they're trying to
[39:01] build churches they're trying to build
[39:03] assemblies
[39:04] and there's only one revival that's left
[39:06] it's a revival of the word of god
[39:08] in the season and this word will produce
[39:11] a pride's revival it might not produce
[39:14] the biggest churches
[39:15] it might not produce the biggest crowds
[39:17] but it'll produce the most people in the
[39:19] rapture
[39:22] i i know how the message preachers we
[39:24] all feel the same we're not as
[39:26] interested in filling up the pew as we
[39:27] are filling up heaven
[39:30] [Applause]
[39:31] brother brahm said i'll tell you what he
[39:32] said i i'm going to preach the word of
[39:34] god he said because i don't want to be
[39:35] responsible for a bunch of illegitimate
[39:37] children
[39:39] he said i would rather meet god without
[39:41] one convert is a bunch of illegitimate
[39:42] children
[39:44] amen that's the truth because you know
[39:46] what he said this word would produce
[39:48] he said this word will produce an acts 2
[39:51] church how many knows he taught it he
[39:53] said in acts 2
[39:55] tongue talking hollering screaming
[39:57] blabbering
[39:59] church of the living god it's the only
[40:01] kind the word
[40:02] can produce you say brother wayne i tell
[40:04] you people just get too fanatical for me
[40:06] isn't it amazing that all of a sudden
[40:08] worshiping god has become fanatical in
[40:10] this age
[40:11] you can scream your head off at a ball
[40:13] game it's not fanatical
[40:14] you can rock your shoes off in a rock
[40:16] concert and it's not fanatical
[40:19] but when you see that god has answered
[40:21] the prayer
[40:22] in the message of the hour in order to
[40:24] raise the roof on the church
[40:26] of the living god to know that the
[40:28] resurrected savior
[40:30] has come into the age we're living in we
[40:32] are not here
[40:34] by ourselves we are not here tonight on
[40:36] i hope so maybe
[40:38] so but the resurrected paradox god
[40:41] is in the midst of the church in this
[40:44] hour
[40:44] he said preacher what are you what are
[40:46] you really talking about let me tell you
[40:47] what i'm talking about
[40:48] in the days when jesus come off of that
[40:50] mountain riding that white mule
[40:52] you all know what that was that was
[40:54] zechariah 9's prophecy
[40:57] they wondered what zechariah meant all
[40:59] those years behold thy king cometh
[41:01] riding on the photo
[41:02] what does that mean who's going to do
[41:04] that how's that going to happen
[41:06] but that morning they saw jesus on that
[41:09] mule
[41:10] and that was the answer to zechariah's
[41:12] prophecy
[41:13] that was the answer amen to a virgin
[41:15] shall conceive
[41:17] that was the answer to a messiah was
[41:19] coming and when they saw the answer
[41:22] they realized the vindicated word had
[41:24] come
[41:25] to their city my the screams the shouts
[41:28] the hallelujahs
[41:31] because the answer had come and they saw
[41:34] the answer as king
[41:37] are you traveling with me they saw the
[41:39] answer as their king
[41:41] the answer of malachi 4 is this message
[41:44] the answer of luke 17 is this message
[41:46] amen the answer to first thessalonians
[41:49] is this message
[41:50] and because it's the answer we have
[41:52] invited it to be the king
[41:54] to set the order of the church to set
[41:56] the order of our lives
[41:58] to set the church in a place to set the
[42:01] church in a position
[42:03] for a miracle
[42:06] do you see this look look it by the word
[42:09] of the lord

[42:11] going to see a miracle

[42:15] prophet saw you

[42:19] rapture in front of you

[42:23] take place there's a power
[42:25] that is coming back in the church again
[42:27] an anointing to change lives
[42:29] to change hearts you say preacher what
[42:31] do we need to do
[42:32] this is not working up this is not
[42:34] beating it up
[42:35] it's getting the line of god take your
[42:38] position in the word
[42:39] and watch the god of paradox do
[42:43] in your midst oh yeah
[42:47] oh yeah you don't think he can but he
[42:49] can
[42:50] because he is the god of paradox and you
[42:52] have met things in your life that you
[42:54] can't explain
[42:55] and you've met this this disappointments
[42:57] and troubles
[42:58] amen i'm going to come home to you in a
[43:00] minute amen you've met things you can't

[43:03] and you wonder sometimes who are we
[43:05] really following if we're coming into
[43:07] these kind of problems
[43:08] if these kind of situations but read
[43:10] your bible
[43:11] it'll give you a perfect vision amen
[43:13] moses who is an undisputed prophet of
[43:16] god
[43:16] the pillar of fire which is the son of
[43:18] god was leading the church
[43:20] and it led them right to the red sea
[43:25] it led them to the red sea they was run
[43:28] to a place that looked like there's no
[43:30] way out
[43:31] brother paul i know as a pastor you've
[43:33] come to those places look like there's
[43:34] no way out
[43:35] there's no answer you can give whatever
[43:37] you say is going to be wrong
[43:38] whatever you do it's going to be wrong
[43:40] amen but the god that was with moses
[43:43] is standing with you brother the god
[43:45] that was with moses
[43:46] is with this message in the hour we're
[43:48] living in
[43:50] moses got up there and began to whine
[43:52] around to god he began to whine a little
[43:54] bit like all of us do
[43:56] oh god and we're in trouble and looks
[43:58] like i've let the people wrong
[44:00] we're in this problem what are we going
[44:01] to do and it was like god
[44:03] just started talking to moses said hey
[44:05] dried up boy have not i sent thee
[44:09] have not commissioned me have not i
[44:12] anointed you
[44:13] have not i told you what the word of the
[44:15] lord is in this age
[44:17] amen why you cry to me speak the word of
[44:20] god
[44:20] that this people might go forward i tell
[44:23] you brother paul
[44:24] amen the god that was speaking with
[44:26] moses is the one that's standing with
[44:28] this ministry
[44:29] in the end time and he's prophesied to
[44:31] us if you'll just speak the word
[44:34] this mountain's gonna move this valley
[44:37] is gonna pull back this ocean's got to
[44:40] move out of your way
[44:42] by the word of the lord when this ocean
[44:44] started moving then people
[44:46] saw they saw the moon they saw them
[44:48] moving are you hearing me they
[44:50] saw the movement of god they didn't go
[44:53] running backwards
[44:55] they didn't go running backwards and say
[44:56] well i don't know if we are to get off
[44:58] into that or not
[45:00] the way of heresy is your escape when is
[45:03] the last time you got out of your little
[45:04] realm of comfort
[45:05] and worshiped god when's the last time
[45:08] you stepped out of that dignified belief
[45:11] system you got
[45:12] that you're not going to crack a smile
[45:14] you're not going to amend the word
[45:16] and you're just going to sit there and
[45:17] hear things bless me preacher if you can
[45:19] amen listen it's time that the church
[45:22] sees the movement of the holy ghost
[45:24] and the way of heresy that's the way
[45:27] that i worship the god
[45:29] of my father this tongue talking acts 2
[45:32] 38 church
[45:33] is still alive today i know they're
[45:36] going to beat us
[45:37] i know they're going to say don't you
[45:38] preach that way but you've come too late
[45:41] i've already been put in the fire i've
[45:43] already been tried
[45:45] i know that my god will stand in the
[45:47] hour of battle
[45:52] well red sea started part they didn't
[45:55] step back and say what's that
[45:57] no sir those were children of abraham
[46:00] and they knew the god of paradox was due
[46:02] to show up anytime
[46:04] and when he showed up they went and got
[46:06] in the water
[46:08] and i tell you the beauty of it god
[46:09] wouldn't even let them walk get their
[46:10] feet wet

[46:19] my subject
[46:20] it was a long line it was a long line
[46:25] and some of them were still out in the
[46:26] middle of the water with the waves on
[46:28] both sides wondering did god forget
[46:30] about us
[46:31] and there they are in the middle of a
[46:33] paradox wondering
[46:34] is god forgot about us no god he forgot
[46:37] about you
[46:38] you're already in the paradox you're
[46:40] already in the message
[46:42] you are a paradox yourself

[46:49] god gave you that paradox and here you
[46:51] sit tonight
[46:52] hey man they started getting out on the
[46:54] other side i got to think about this the
[46:56] other day i said 2 million
[46:57] a line of 2 million people what if you
[46:59] did fall in the back of that line

[47:20] what's the noise about
[47:21] a word travel back somebody's already

[47:26] and the shout and the victory up there
[47:28] on the other side
[47:29] you say preacher what's all the noise
[47:31] it's the sounds of victory
[47:33] somebody's already broke through they
[47:36] broke through the realms of unbelief

[47:39] laodicea and they see the promises of
[47:42] god
[47:43] being fulfilled in their age listen i
[47:45] believe tonight

[48:20] there's a miracle right in front of you
[48:24] so brother paul when's it going to
[48:25] happen paul ain't going to perform it

[48:31] following the god of paradox
[48:33] who keeps his word it's up to him of
[48:35] time date and season

[50:20] necessary
[50:22] if you know your god his presence with
[50:24] you what difference does it make

[50:41] enough things i've been around left
[50:42] controlling spirits

[50:53] king james version and help me out
[50:57] i don't want to be a smart aleck i mean
[50:59] to be true
[51:01] people present it like it's a teaching
[51:03] of brother branham it's hogwash it comes
[51:04] from the pits of hell
[51:06] william branham didn't teach it the
[51:08] bible don't teach it and anybody that
[51:10] does is teaching false doctrine
[51:13] you said brother wayne that's on the
[51:14] internet i know it is and i hope
[51:15] everybody hears me out there
[51:19] you can hear it now or later i love how
[51:22] brother brown says things he said it's a
[51:24] little good to be scorched now it's
[51:25] burned later

[51:31] that devil better be careful i know
[51:33] where i'm standing
[51:36] bullies bullies in the end time well you
[51:39] can't have these
[51:40] you can have these kind of services you
[51:43] can have your singing you can't have
[51:44] your music
[51:49] well then wouldn't god make you god
[51:52] i look brother donnie was down to meet

[52:10] bit like david i'm new to the routine

[52:18] very scary person
[52:22] what are you going to take from me
[52:27] i don't give everything up
[52:29] [Applause]
[52:30] what are you going to do to a man that
[52:32] don't have nothing
[52:33] i have already forsaken all i have been
[52:36] bought and sold by the word of god
[52:39] if i die i'll die by the word if i live
[52:42] i'll live by the word
[52:44] amen but by the grace of god i'll stand
[52:47] on this word
[52:48] as long as there's a breath in my body i
[52:50] will preach the message of the hour
[52:53] to the young and to the old because this
[52:56] is the truth by the grace of god
[52:58] bullies in the end time reminds me of a
[53:00] goliath amen that wanted to stop the
[53:02] whole
[53:03] stop the whole camp amen just one giant
[53:06] stopping everybody isn't that something
[53:08] get one loud bow stop everybody
[53:12] you know what brother brown said he said
[53:13] that loud mouth spoke up the wrong time
[53:15] he said fell on the wrong ears
[53:18] and david didn't let it rest david come
[53:21] running off of the hill now y'all y'all
[53:22] know i don't have time to preach on
[53:24] david and you know the story of david so
[53:25] let's get the point
[53:27] when david come off of that hill he he
[53:29] done told by
[53:30] all of the tribe by all the army even by
[53:32] his own king that you can't whip this
[53:34] man
[53:35] but he had been in contact with god a
[53:37] paradox
[53:39] he had been in contact with the god of
[53:40] paradox and when he come running off of
[53:42] that mountain
[53:43] he did not walk in the battle he didn't
[53:46] crawl into that battle
[53:48] i love the bible don't you those men
[53:51] trained
[53:51] soldiers wouldn't even get off their
[53:54] their rears on their feet
[53:56] to go back and beat this goliath
[53:59] they were trained men but couldn't move
[54:01] in faith at all
[54:03] but here's this little snotty rose david
[54:07] who come off of that mountain with a
[54:10] revelation that he was going to defeat
[54:12] that giant
[54:13] and he went running into the battle
[54:15] fanatical
[54:16] loose cannon crazy fanatical man
[54:20] but he was in love with the god of
[54:22] paradox knew god would take
[54:24] care of the battle
[54:28] you see what was going on as david knew
[54:32] he knew that god would back it up do you
[54:34] do you see the age that we're living in
[54:37] people say to us they say to us you know
[54:40] how could this happen
[54:41] well i'll tell you what brother branham
[54:42] told us he told us that the god of
[54:44] paradox will make it happen
[54:47] i'm gonna have to leave here and get
[54:48] into this other area i'm gonna get too
[54:50] long with you
[54:50] but i'll tell you this it was david who
[54:54] knew
[54:55] that joshua had stopped the sun
[54:58] it was david who knew the ground he was
[55:01] on
[55:02] had been taken away from giants previous
[55:04] to that time
[55:06] he knew the ground he was on possessed
[55:08] things
[55:09] that was from another age i was studying
[55:11] there one time really struck me
[55:13] amen where jesus said hey man if the if
[55:15] the if the people won't praise me
[55:17] rocks are cry out in their place and i
[55:19] got to think about the testimony of
[55:20] rocks you know and how they testify
[55:22] i went all the way back to the garden
[55:23] and i preached on a little while but it
[55:25] really got me this this point of the
[55:26] testimony really got me
[55:28] i got to thinking about the rocks that
[55:30] was laying in the creek the day david
[55:31] went down there
[55:33] and i thought i mean if you if you if
[55:35] you could have give them
[55:36] them boys a voice what would they have
[55:38] said five stones laying there
[55:40] i meant i mean if you could have given
[55:42] them a voice he was standing in the
[55:44] place
[55:45] he was standing in the same areas of
[55:48] where joshua had defeated all those
[55:50] giants previous
[55:52] you all know the bible said that god
[55:54] rained hailstones
[55:56] out of the heavens literally pummeled
[55:58] rocks out of the heavens
[55:59] and killed giants in the days of joshua
[56:02] i thought about them stones has been
[56:03] laying there
[56:04] since the days of joshua and they've
[56:07] been waiting on a hand that would pick
[56:09] them
[56:09] up amen and let them go back to work
[56:12] again
[56:13] i thought oh my when david threw that
[56:15] rock that rock was a giant killer to
[56:17] start with
[56:18] it just needed somebody to believe it
[56:20] and throw it and i think of the age
[56:22] we're living in there's been a prophet
[56:24] who was out in front of us and he killed
[56:26] the giants of this age
[56:28] and he left all these revelations laying
[56:30] here for the church in this hour
[56:33] not you're not that army sitting on the
[56:35] hill you're the davids of this age
[56:38] you're the david's face in the glass of
[56:40] this age
[56:41] and we're not gonna lay down and let it
[56:44] goliath
[56:45] take our place in this line can you
[56:47] imagine somebody trying to come up
[56:49] you're standing in line for a paradox
[56:51] and he's trying to push you out of the
[56:52] line
[56:53] i don't care how big he is i don't care
[56:55] how much strong
[56:56] or how real he is he has no ability to
[56:59] remove you from your position that god
[57:01] puts you in
[57:06] you're in position for a miracle
[57:09] think about this this line i i just
[57:13] i just was listening to the paradoxes of
[57:15] the one in chicago
[57:16] and brother branham said that his
[57:17] disciples were with jesus and jesus was
[57:19] there one day feeding the 5 000.
[57:22] and he said the disciples came you know
[57:24] of course told him they didn't have
[57:25] enough bread to feed him jesus said
[57:27] don't worry about this
[57:28] and they brought him five loaves he took
[57:31] them five loads
[57:32] and fed five thousand
[57:36] now that's a lot of people to feed i i
[57:38] guess i need to do the statistics
[57:39] sometime maybe brother randy you could
[57:41] help us out
[57:42] about how many loaves of bread that
[57:43] would take or how many pounds amen but
[57:45] do you know that jesus
[57:46] according to the scripture whether
[57:48] brother branham taught it he said jesus
[57:50] had them disciples to line up and he
[57:53] said he literally
[57:54] broke the bread and hand it to a
[57:56] disciple and that disciple would
[57:58] disperse that
[57:59] and the next one in line he'd break the
[58:01] bread now brother ram tells it
[58:02] he said see what was going on is he was
[58:05] giving them all the same portion
[58:07] he would break it when he broke the
[58:09] bread an angel would go plant the seed
[58:12] it would come to harvest they would pick
[58:13] the harvest they would go down and they
[58:15] would
[58:16] mill the grain they would make flour
[58:18] they would go break bread and then bring
[58:19] it back
[58:20] before the next disciple got up there he
[58:23] said brother wayne that's incredible but
[58:24] see it's true because they wasn't
[58:28] he wasn't giving them uncooked bread he
[58:30] was giving them cooked bread
[58:31] how did they get cooked bread because
[58:33] god was creating a miracle
[58:37] he was doing a miracle it was a paradox
[58:40] but brother brahm said he did it to
[58:42] every one of them
[58:43] he didn't just create a bunch of bread
[58:45] and teal to go pass it out
[58:47] but they were in line and they were
[58:49] walking up to jesus and he was breaking
[58:51] the bread and giving it breaking the
[58:52] bread and giving him brother brahm said
[58:53] here it is
[58:54] he's jesus the same yesterday
[58:58] today forever
[59:01] now brother branham's a powerful
[59:02] preacher he took that simple story
[59:05] he said now you are the next one in line
[59:10] he said are you going to go down and
[59:11] fish and try to catch your own fish
[59:13] or would you like a portion of this
[59:16] would you like to go make your own bread
[59:17] or would you like a portion of this
[59:20] you're in a line to receive a paradox
[59:23] from god
[59:24] do you see the bride has a portion
[59:27] coming in this age
[59:29] do you see that brother branham actually
[59:30] tells us in the church's book that you
[59:32] have a turn
[59:34] but the logos has a bride and in your
[59:37] turn
[59:38] to be manifested this is your age this
[59:41] is your turn
[59:42] you're the one in line you can look back
[59:45] and say well david did and
[59:46] paul did and moses did moses is not in
[59:49] that line tonight
[59:51] david is not standing in the line it is
[59:54] you that's in the line
[59:55] and you're in the presence of jesus
[59:57] christ now what are you going to do with
[59:59] it
[1:00:00] are you going to take what god is trying
[1:00:02] to give us or are we going to try to
[1:00:04] make up our own mind
[1:00:05] and how this goes and how's this go
[1:00:07] you're in a miracle line with god
[1:00:10] the paradox has been broken off and
[1:00:13] given to you a bright portion
[1:00:15] of the third pool you have been given a
[1:00:17] commission to speak the word of god
[1:00:19] you've been given a commission to
[1:00:21] prophesy to the giant
[1:00:23] to prophesy to this age
[1:00:26] when david took his portion he
[1:00:28] prophesied over that
[1:00:29] over that giant and began to say to that
[1:00:31] giant amen i'll make you like the bear
[1:00:33] in the line
[1:00:34] i'll feed you to the birds i'll cut your
[1:00:37] head off
[1:00:37] and haul you back he began to prophesy
[1:00:40] and
[1:00:40] david literally ran and met his own
[1:00:43] prophecy
[1:00:47] i wonder tonight i wonder if you could
[1:00:50] prophesy against that that's in your
[1:00:54] life he began to ran
[1:00:56] into the battle he was the one that was
[1:01:00] in line
[1:01:01] do you see where you're standing right
[1:01:03] now you're actually in the line
[1:01:05] the prophet of god said you have come in
[1:01:08] contact again the same as the first
[1:01:09] adam's bride
[1:01:11] do you see what she was she was confused
[1:01:14] on
[1:01:14] one promise how many knows what the
[1:01:18] promise was
[1:01:19] eve was confused on one promise see that
[1:01:22] brother brown makes it simple you don't
[1:01:23] have to keep up with a lot of things
[1:01:24] she's done wrong
[1:01:26] she got confused on something one thing
[1:01:29] she got confused on
[1:01:31] it was on that jesus christ is the same
[1:01:33] yesterday today and forever
[1:01:36] he said it was confused on one promise
[1:01:38] that he's the same yesterday today and
[1:01:40] forever
[1:01:41] she failed on that one promise under the
[1:01:43] temptation of the enemy
[1:01:45] face to face now people let's call for
[1:01:47] his name of course he is his bride
[1:01:49] she has come contact again by the same
[1:01:53] thing
[1:01:55] think about that and we are not confused
[1:02:00] we have been proven vindicated to us
[1:02:02] that he is the same
[1:02:05] now when a person ever comes in contact
[1:02:06] with god
[1:02:08] if a person ever comes in contact with
[1:02:10] god brother braham said he will
[1:02:12] satan will never be able to twist that
[1:02:16] man away from god
[1:02:18] it's a preacher i i i don't i'm in a
[1:02:21] hard time right now let me
[1:02:22] let me say something to you very
[1:02:23] carefully if you've ever come in contact
[1:02:26] with god there's nothing they'll ever be
[1:02:27] able to twist you away from this
[1:02:30] you said how could that be how how could
[1:02:33] it be
[1:02:34] when brother braham said that you
[1:02:35] weren't even born yet
[1:02:38] you said well brother wayne how in the
[1:02:39] world could he say that how could
[1:02:41] job be talked about by god and the devil
[1:02:44] before the trial ever come
[1:02:45] god told that devil he'll stand up to
[1:02:47] you
[1:02:49] because he had confidence that job would
[1:02:52] hold to the word no matter the
[1:02:53] temptation
[1:02:55] and god has confidence in this church
[1:02:58] he has confidence in this bride let me
[1:03:00] let me say something real clear to you
[1:03:01] tonight
[1:03:02] brother paul god's got confidence in you
[1:03:04] as a minister and he called you to this
[1:03:06] message
[1:03:07] because he called you before the
[1:03:08] foundation of the world
[1:03:10] brother said how could god trust you
[1:03:12] with this message
[1:03:13] because he called you before the
[1:03:15] foundation of the world
[1:03:16] before the devil was created god created
[1:03:20] sons and daughters of god to withstand
[1:03:22] the devil in this end time
[1:03:24] so you're not just trying to do
[1:03:26] something you've literally been anointed
[1:03:28] to do this
[1:03:29] you've been called of god to stand in
[1:03:32] this hour
[1:03:33] you see it was a temptation it was a
[1:03:35] temptation lifes and trials
[1:03:38] it was even tempted of job and even
[1:03:41] jesus
[1:03:42] even jesus when he was speaking in his
[1:03:44] day
[1:03:45] can you imagine jesus the lord jesus
[1:03:49] brought up job and said have you not
[1:03:52] heard of the patience of job
[1:03:56] what was his patience he believed that
[1:03:58] god was going to change something
[1:04:00] he didn't know why he was going through
[1:04:02] this he didn't know what this trial was
[1:04:04] about
[1:04:06] he didn't know what this problem was but
[1:04:08] he knew god was real
[1:04:10] and he knew he knew that he had met the
[1:04:13] requirements of god by sacrifice
[1:04:15] and brother man said his patience was
[1:04:17] waiting on god
[1:04:18] he was waiting on god to fix it do you
[1:04:21] see the bride you're in line
[1:04:22] and there's disappointments and there's
[1:04:24] trials and there's
[1:04:26] people trying to twist you on every
[1:04:27] manner but god's got confidence that you
[1:04:30] was going to hold before he put you here
[1:04:34] now there's a security i'll be just a
[1:04:36] couple minutes i'm closing
[1:04:38] there's a security that's sitting here
[1:04:40] tonight in this bride that you
[1:04:41] sometimes you fail to remember these
[1:04:43] things but they're in the scripture
[1:04:45] and i think it's our job to remind you
[1:04:47] that the predestination of god
[1:04:49] is not a doctrine it's not some little
[1:04:52] gimmick or
[1:04:53] something we're doing to to cause people
[1:04:55] to be have a pep rally
[1:04:57] the predestination of god is an absolute
[1:05:00] truth of the
[1:05:01] sovereignty and the divine will of a god
[1:05:04] who can change things to his own will
[1:05:08] and when god predestinated a church and
[1:05:10] said there will be
[1:05:11] a church without spot or wrinkle paul
[1:05:13] said that we might have
[1:05:15] a church without spot or wrinkle brother
[1:05:17] madam said you are
[1:05:18] the church without spot or wrinkle
[1:05:21] a church is not coming you're that
[1:05:24] church
[1:05:25] you're a perfect paradox of god you're
[1:05:28] torn
[1:05:29] but you're the bride persecuted
[1:05:32] but it's the word god already knew you
[1:05:35] would make
[1:05:36] it through it do you see
[1:05:40] brother brown said he couldn't get a
[1:05:42] word from god
[1:05:44] he said but the devil couldn't move him
[1:05:46] either
[1:05:49] and you know i i don't want to get deep
[1:05:50] in this but you know when god won't talk
[1:05:52] to you that's when the devil does
[1:05:57] you know you said well brother wayne i
[1:05:59] can't hardly admit the devil talk to me
[1:06:00] well brother branham did
[1:06:03] he said when his daughter was dying he
[1:06:04] walked out of the hospital he said he
[1:06:06] walked out on the front and he said the
[1:06:07] devil began to talk to him
[1:06:08] he said god wouldn't speak to me
[1:06:10] concerning it and the devil began to say
[1:06:12] to him well you've done this and you've
[1:06:14] done this and you've done this but god
[1:06:16] can't even help you
[1:06:17] he said i was about to say well if he
[1:06:20] can't do that then i
[1:06:22] can't he said before i could get it out
[1:06:25] something rose out of me and i said
[1:06:27] the lord giveth and the lord taketh
[1:06:30] blessed be the name of the lord do you
[1:06:32] see he wouldn't be twisted away from it
[1:06:36] now when god ordains a person to be at a
[1:06:39] certain place
[1:06:40] let me ask you this is there anything
[1:06:42] too hard for the lord
[1:06:45] is there any situation that's too hard
[1:06:48] for the lord then if god says you'll be
[1:06:52] in a certain place at the end of this
[1:06:54] you will be where he put you
[1:06:58] when they crawled on that boat and jesus
[1:07:00] said we're going to go to the other side
[1:07:02] he crawled in there and laid down and
[1:07:04] went to sleep
[1:07:08] they were fishing to go through the
[1:07:09] greatest battle of their life
[1:07:12] and jesus could sleep through it
[1:07:15] you know why he could sleep through it
[1:07:18] because he wasn't worried about the
[1:07:19] destination
[1:07:22] he was not troubled he was not back
[1:07:25] there with a glass of whiskey and
[1:07:27] and some xanax wondering oh how's this
[1:07:29] going to end up
[1:07:32] god was not shook up he knew exactly
[1:07:34] what was going to happen
[1:07:35] he knew a storm was about to strike them
[1:07:38] one they couldn't get through
[1:07:39] one they couldn't survive one that they
[1:07:42] had no control over
[1:07:43] and when they come to the end of their
[1:07:45] rope they were going to remember
[1:07:48] that there was a power that was in the
[1:07:50] ship that was able to stop every storm
[1:07:52] he knew they would call on him at the
[1:07:54] right time
[1:07:56] because he was already in the boat can i
[1:07:59] read you a quote
[1:08:00] brother branham says it like this in the
[1:08:02] message of god
[1:08:03] go away jesus he says it in 1963
[1:08:06] he said the real believer no matter what
[1:08:08] no matter how thoroughly satisfied how
[1:08:10] many real believers we got here
[1:08:13] how many real believers you a real
[1:08:14] believer no matter what they are
[1:08:16] thoroughly satisfied they're thoroughly
[1:08:18] convinced
[1:08:19] because the life that is in them has
[1:08:23] already become
[1:08:24] christ the life that is in a believer
[1:08:28] has already become christ
[1:08:32] say it with me the life that is in a
[1:08:35] believer
[1:08:36] has already become christ he said
[1:08:40] preacher you're off on a lamb i'm not
[1:08:42] the scripture says it's no more me but
[1:08:44] it's christ that liveth in
[1:08:46] me the life has already become you say
[1:08:49] what difference does it make
[1:08:50] see if he's your life how are you going
[1:08:53] to separate a man from his own life
[1:08:56] that's why paul could say this paul
[1:08:58] could say this he was not talking about
[1:09:00] some abstract people
[1:09:02] paul was talking about believers look
[1:09:05] what paul says in romans
[1:09:06] 8 for them he did for know he also did
[1:09:09] predecimate to be conformed to the image
[1:09:12] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:09:13] many brethren them that he did
[1:09:15] predestinate he also called to them
[1:09:17] because he justified
[1:09:18] and whom he justified he also glorified
[1:09:20] what shall we say to these things then
[1:09:23] if god before us who can be against us
[1:09:26] he that spared not his own son but
[1:09:28] delivered him up for us how shall not he
[1:09:30] freely give us all things
[1:09:33] he freely give us all things i'm only
[1:09:35] talking about a few things tonight
[1:09:37] he give us all things he how who can lay
[1:09:40] anything to the charge of god's elect
[1:09:42] for if he that justify
[1:09:44] who is he that condemneth it is christ
[1:09:46] that died ye rather that is
[1:09:48] risen who is even at the right hand of
[1:09:50] god who also maketh intercession for us
[1:09:53] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:09:56] christ
[1:09:57] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:10:00] persecution
[1:10:01] or famine or nakedness or pearl or sword
[1:10:06] who shall separate us brother adam shows
[1:10:08] the reality of that scripture
[1:10:10] it's christ is already in you how can
[1:10:13] you separate it now
[1:10:14] how can you take it out it's already in
[1:10:18] you take a you take a glass of water and
[1:10:20] drop another
[1:10:21] drop of water it's already in the bottle
[1:10:23] now separate it
[1:10:25] and once christ comes into you you're
[1:10:26] not going to separate it
[1:10:28] by trials by temptations by problems
[1:10:31] nothing
[1:10:32] i love how paul says it and i and i i
[1:10:34] really
[1:10:35] feel this on my heart or i would have
[1:10:36] quit 10 minutes ago there is nothing
[1:10:39] that is coming paul said that has been
[1:10:41] able to separate the church from christ
[1:10:44] paul is telling you there's nothing that
[1:10:46] can separate you
[1:10:48] and i love to think about these things
[1:10:49] because there's nothing that has been
[1:10:51] and you've been through a lot of things
[1:10:56] if you've ever heard me use the
[1:10:57] scripture just forgive my ignorance i've
[1:10:59] got to use it tonight
[1:11:02] it don't matter what we have been
[1:11:03] through
[1:11:06] it hasn't stopped us from coming to this
[1:11:08] point in our life
[1:11:10] no matter what we have come to brother
[1:11:12] paul is driving up the road coming to
[1:11:14] this meeting i've used the scripture a
[1:11:16] lot
[1:11:16] but the spirit of the lord struck me so
[1:11:18] strongly concerning this point
[1:11:22] nothing that you have been through has
[1:11:24] been able to stop it
[1:11:28] think about the years think about the
[1:11:30] trials
[1:11:31] think about the discussions and the
[1:11:33] ministry and the in the almost
[1:11:35] seem like total wipeout and this is
[1:11:37] going to get it and this was designed
[1:11:39] and trapped
[1:11:40] but nothing has been able to this point
[1:11:43] to take us
[1:11:44] and remove us from the place that god
[1:11:46] has put us and to think amen
[1:11:48] brother paul said in here tonight do you
[1:11:50] think that's without tribulation
[1:11:52] that's without fence that's without
[1:11:54] someone criticizing
[1:11:56] you can't sit up front and not be shot
[1:11:58] at and beat out and troubled in every
[1:12:00] place
[1:12:02] but the bible already said that it
[1:12:04] wouldn't be able to separate us from the
[1:12:06] love of god
[1:12:10] it wouldn't have the power to do it
[1:12:12] satan don't have that kind of power
[1:12:15] quit letting your imagination run away
[1:12:18] with you
[1:12:18] he's not that powerful he's not that
[1:12:21] great
[1:12:22] he's not that awesome but my god on the
[1:12:25] other hand
[1:12:26] he's an awesome god he's a god of
[1:12:28] paradox
[1:12:29] and he's able to change every situation
[1:12:32] and in that moment when you think it's
[1:12:34] over
[1:12:34] the red sea opens up and in that moment
[1:12:37] you think it's finished
[1:12:38] he steps on the bow of the boat and says
[1:12:40] peace be still
[1:12:41] in that moment you think everything is
[1:12:44] going to be destroyed
[1:12:45] he makes a way where there is no way the
[1:12:48] dead are raised in the
[1:12:50] are healed and the blind see because
[1:12:52] he's a god like that
[1:12:56] that it's easy for me to look at what
[1:12:58] has been and then look at you tonight
[1:13:00] and tell you nothing you're going
[1:13:02] through is going to stop this
[1:13:04] it's easy for me to be able to tell you
[1:13:06] i do not have to be a prophet or son of
[1:13:08] a prophet
[1:13:09] but i can tell you if the devil ain't
[1:13:11] got you yet he ain't going to get you at
[1:13:13] all
[1:13:13] because he's thrown everything he's got
[1:13:15] cove had come
[1:13:16] and here we are kovalev has hit us and
[1:13:19] he tried to shut us down and tear us
[1:13:21] apart
[1:13:22] amen divide the churches and the people
[1:13:24] but here we are
[1:13:26] here we are the devil's got us on his
[1:13:28] hands amen we've got the platform
[1:13:30] and we're not giving it back we're going
[1:13:32] to be the final voice
[1:13:34] to a final age yes sir nothing that has
[1:13:38] been or can be
[1:13:39] so i can easily say there ain't nothing
[1:13:41] coming
[1:13:43] do you see by the word of the lord i can
[1:13:45] prophesy to the church
[1:13:47] there's clear waters in front of us
[1:13:49] there's a rapture in front of us
[1:13:51] there's a body change in front of us i
[1:13:53] don't know what else is there
[1:13:55] but the god a paradox is walking with us
[1:13:59] and he'll take care of it as we approach
[1:14:01] it
[1:14:04] if you will just stay in line look at
[1:14:06] that
[1:14:08] just stay in line
[1:14:12] you are in a position
[1:14:16] for a miracle won't you come to the
[1:14:19] platform tonight if you would
[1:14:21] the musician you
[1:14:27] you're in position
[1:14:32] for change i say unto you by the word of
[1:14:36] the lord
[1:14:39] now if you don't want to come it's okay
[1:14:40] you don't have to
[1:14:42] i say that to you you're in position to
[1:14:44] change
[1:14:49] change is taking place in the bride of
[1:14:51] christ
[1:14:53] a great move a great move of the spirit
[1:14:56] of god is moving over the church
[1:14:58] the bride the bride is going to leave
[1:15:01] this world
[1:15:03] and if you want to be a part
[1:15:08] you just got to step in
[1:15:11] it's time to move in would you stand to
[1:15:12] your feet with us tonight

[1:16:13] maybe there's a mother sitting here
[1:16:14] tonight
[1:16:18] sitting here agreeing with the word
[1:16:22] the god of paradox circling this
[1:16:24] building right now

[1:16:29] [Music]
[1:16:31] i don't understand them all
[1:16:34] i see things with my natural eyes lord
[1:16:36] that's completely
[1:16:37] unexplainable but you're god
[1:16:42] and we submit our beings to you and we
[1:16:44] ask you now lord

[1:16:49] people may you bless this pastor father

[1:17:07] we committed in your name
[1:17:13] so brother wayne i've been suffering a
[1:17:14] long time

[1:17:19] written for your example
[1:17:24] a little girl 12 years
[1:17:27] with an issue of blood
[1:17:31] but she broke through she touched the
[1:17:34] master
[1:17:38] 12 years is not too long if you're in
[1:17:41] the presence of him
[1:17:44] georgie carter was over nine years
[1:17:46] laying in a bed
