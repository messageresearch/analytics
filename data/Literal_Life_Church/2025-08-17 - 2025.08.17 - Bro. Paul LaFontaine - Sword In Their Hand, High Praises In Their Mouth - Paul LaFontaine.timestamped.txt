[35:30] all of my faults
[35:33] and saw my need.
[35:42] Amazing
[35:46] grace

[35:57] [Music]
[35:59] out of darkness

[36:12] could clearly
[36:15] see.

[36:28] the mountains
[36:31] and the valley.

[36:47] my homes
[36:49] and he saw all my dreams.

[38:58] Hallelujah.
[39:01] Give him some praise this morning. He
[39:03] looked beyond our fall and so need.
[39:06] Hallelujah.
[39:09] Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[39:15] Let's sing it all together. I shall
[39:20] forever
[39:23] [Music]

[40:38] Yes. Hallelujah.
[40:40] Amen. Brother Wes, would you come up
[40:42] right on? You may be seated this
[40:45] morning.
[40:46] Hallelujah.
[41:16] [Music]
[41:22] What a wonderful presence this morning.
[41:24] Amen. I was going to sing something
[41:26] different. And I was going to play the
[41:27] piano
[41:32] and I got a call this morning on my way
[41:34] here and
[41:37] got some really sad news from back home.
[41:42] And there's a little family with broken
[41:44] hearts this morning.
[41:48] And as I was listening, I I wasn't even
[41:50] singing this morning. I was just
[41:51] listening to all your beautiful voices
[41:53] in this atmosphere.
[41:55] And I was just praying for them in my
[41:57] heart
[41:59] that God would just go and just pour out
[42:02] his love, his grace, and his mercy upon
[42:05] this little family.
[42:07] We're part of that family.
[42:12] And I just uh this song just came to my
[42:14] heart. I've been singing it for the last
[42:15] few months. Really, just never sung it
[42:17] before. You might say that's crazy to do
[42:20] in in front of all these people that
[42:21] you've half of them you don't know. But
[42:23] you know what? We're a family, right?
[42:26] We're the family of God. And so when God
[42:28] lays something on your heart, sometimes
[42:29] you might say, "Man, that's crazy."
[42:31] Listen, folks, the spirit is unscripted.
[42:34] And he moves when he wants to move. And
[42:36] so I just pray that you just worship
[42:38] with me. And when we're singing this
[42:39] together, if you know it,
[42:42] just pray for this family this morning,
[42:44] will you? Amen.
[42:48] When I walk
[42:52] through deep waters,
[42:56] I know you will be with me.
[43:03] And when I'm standing,
[43:06] oh, in the fire,
[43:10] yeah, I will not be overcome.
[43:18] through the valley of the shadow.
[43:25] Oh, I will not fear.
[43:30] I am not alone. Hallelujah. Oh, I am not
[43:34] alone.
[43:37] You will go before me.
[43:41] You will never leave me.
[43:44] I am not alone.
[43:48] I am not alone.
[43:52] You will go before me.
[43:55] You will never leave me
[44:02] in the midst
[44:04] of deep sorrow.
[44:08] Oh, I see your light is breaking
[44:12] through.
[44:15] Oh, the dark of night. Oh, it will not
[44:20] overtake me.
[44:23] Oh, I am pressing into you.
[44:29] Oh
[44:30] Lord, you fight my every battle.
[44:36] Oh,
[44:38] and I will I will not fear. I am not
[44:43] alone. Oh, hallelujah. I am not alone.

[45:35] You will never leave me. This is who he
[45:39] is. Oh, you amaze me. Redeem me. You

[45:59] me. Yes. your own. Oh, you amaze me,

[46:14] You're my strength.
[46:17] You're my strong tower.
[46:22] You're my refuge in the storm.
[46:27] Oh, through these trials, you've
[46:32] always been faithful.
[46:35] Oh, you bring healing to my soul.
[46:41] Oh,
[46:43] through the valley of the shadow.
[46:49] Oh,
[46:51] I will not fear. you. I am not alone.
[46:57] Sing it now. I am not. Do you realize
[47:00] that this morning he's going before you?

[47:45] You will go before me.
[47:48] You will never leave me.
[47:54] Praise. God bless you.
[48:00] [Applause]
[48:05] [Music]
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Blessed be his name.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; We're not alone this morning. Can you
[48:14] say amen? Praise the Lord.
[48:18] Amen. And if you just stand with me, I
[48:21] while you turn into Psalms chapter 149,
[48:24] just make a few announcements. What a
[48:27] blessed I could talk quite a bit about.
[48:29] And brother Wes in the specials this
[48:32] morning, you ministered to us, Sister
[48:34] Gloria, I think it was, Brother Wes.
[48:36] Thank you so much. Uh, Brother Wes is
[48:39] brother Ed Biscll's grandson. So, you
[48:43] can see that anointing coming right
[48:44] down. Praise the Lord. We appreciate him
[48:47] being here from Georgia and all all of
[48:49] the visitors. God bless you each one.
[48:52] You've really uh refreshed all of us by
[48:54] coming in and I hope we can refresh you
[48:57] in the Lord. What a time last night.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; What a time last night. I'll tell you uh
[49:03] it was just above and beyond. And we
[49:06] pray we appreciate brother Lee Paul Luca
[49:09] the director from the MB choir. Many of
[49:11] the choir members here and other family
[49:13] members joining in. Thank you, brother
[49:15] Lee Paul, for your direction and also
[49:17] brother Kenny Slacka, our choir director
[49:20] and music director. And I trust me,
[49:22] there's so many logistics that go into
[49:26] planning something like this for the
[49:28] weekend. It's been planning since
[49:29] probably January with brother Lee Paul
[49:32] and all the logistics in the church. And
[49:34] I don't have time to mention all the
[49:36] helpers, but we give a big thank you to
[49:39] all of the AV people and all the people
[49:41] who put this on. God bless you each one.
[49:44] God rewards you.
[49:47] God rewards you for that. And I know he
[49:49] will. We had about 5 to 600 there last
[49:52] night, but we had over 5,000 streaming
[49:55] the concert last night around the world.
[49:57] I got texts from the UK, from Nigeria,
[50:01] uh, all over the place saying how much
[50:03] they were blessed last night. So, we're
[50:05] not only worshiping with 500, we were
[50:07] worshiping around the world with saints.
[50:09] And it's such a tremendous blessing. We
[50:12] thank you. Uh my uh I wouldn't mention
[50:15] this with so many visitors here. I hate
[50:16] to mention my daughter and son-in-law,
[50:18] but they're visiting from Washington. Uh
[50:20] Gabby and Tyler are visiting. I don't
[50:22] even know if they have a seat in the
[50:23] building. They might be in the back
[50:25] section, but we welcome them this
[50:27] morning. And before you clap, before you
[50:30] clap, I have an announcement to make.
[50:33] There's a baby coming in February.
[50:38] [Applause]
[50:39] Amen.
[50:43] Y'all pray for me. I'm announcing new
[50:46] grandbabies almost every Sunday here.
[50:48] I'm I announced one last Sunday. So,
[50:51] y'all pray for me. My goodness. I love
[50:53] him to death, but I didn't expect to get
[50:54] this many so quick. Pray for me. The
[50:57] Lord blesses my uh bank account, too.
[51:01] I'm going to need it for sure. Praise
[51:03] the Lord.
[51:05] This week, we lost a dear friend and
[51:07] brother, Evangelist, Bruce Jacowski.
[51:10] Surprise. He was 70 years old. He he um
[51:13] his heart just quit. He died. And so we
[51:15] were talking to Sister Donna. She's very
[51:17] broken about it. Brother Bruce helped us
[51:19] in the initial days of this church um
[51:22] starting this church and him and his
[51:24] wife. And he has been a blessing. I just
[51:26] want to take a minute and honor him and
[51:28] we'll be sending you the the funeral
[51:30] arrangements and such. But brother
[51:31] Bruce, he was in our congregation in the
[51:34] beginning, but he's went from uh two or
[51:35] three churches and been such a huge
[51:37] assistant to pastors doing anything he
[51:40] needed to do. Uh whether it's play the
[51:42] trumpet or preach or lead songs, he's
[51:44] been such his life is a great testament
[51:46] to a life of service and we hate to lose
[51:49] him. And we remember sister Donna, she
[51:52] just weeping on the phone and and uh you
[51:55] know that you know all of you know
[51:56] who've lost someone some recent me uh
[51:59] members of the family, brother Bird
[52:01] family. It's you can pray for them
[52:02] deeper when you know you've lost
[52:04] somebody like that. So let's lift Donna
[52:06] Jacowski up and we just will give you
[52:08] those uh funeral arrangements. Uh also
[52:11] brother John Garrett, his wife would
[52:13] like to be announced on September 20th.
[52:16] Uh and we just rejoice with him. Brother
[52:19] uh John Garrett has come into retirement
[52:23] and graduation from 28 years of military
[52:26] service and a master's in applied
[52:28] behavior analysis. He's here this
[52:30] morning, Brother John right here. We
[52:33] thank you for your service and thank you
[52:36] for all that you've done. God bless you.

[53:10] we just have the food for those who've

[53:29] a video if you guys have it up there.
[53:31] Just before I read our scripture, and we
[53:33] have to do this. I think it was on April
[53:34] 7th, we begin to pray for Sister Lorie
[53:37] Snow. And they gave her no hope to live.
[53:41] She would ne and if when did she begin
[53:43] to continue to live, they gave her no
[53:45] hope to walk again. I'm going to show
[53:47] you this uh video from just the other
[53:49] day of give Glory to God. They April
[53:51] 7th, they said she they had no hope to
[53:53] live. 0% chance to live. And if you
[53:56] live, she would never walk again. Go
[53:58] ahead and play this video to give Glory
[53:59] to God.
[54:02] Sister Lorie Snowise.
[54:07] [Music]
[54:15] [Applause]
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; And she's not done yet.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Couple weeks ago, I showed a video of
[54:25] she went seven sticks. I said, "You did
[54:27] seven steps for to perfection." She's
[54:29] not done. She's going by herself there
[54:31] and back and she's a woman of faith and
[54:35] she's she's confessing, I'm going to
[54:38] completely walk again and be back to
[54:39] normal. We give glory to almighty God.
[54:43] Hallelujah.
[54:45] God is good.
[54:48] You know, this isn't just something we
[54:50] sing about or worship about. This is a
[54:52] real almighty God that shows up when
[54:55] he's when there's a need. I believe
[54:56] that. But I want to read this morning
[54:58] from Psalms chapter 149. And we'll just
[55:01] be mindful of the time today knowing
[55:02] that many of us are tired and worn out
[55:05] from the uh rehearsals and all the
[55:07] things this week. But we do sense the
[55:10] Lord's presence with us this morning.
[55:12] And he's the one that makes it all
[55:13] worthwhile. How many can identify those
[55:15] who know the Lord know that he's present
[55:17] among us and he's greater and bigger
[55:20] than any man, any preacher, any singer.
[55:22] He's the main attraction here this
[55:24] morning. And when he is this close to
[55:27] us, boy, we ought to just give him all
[55:29] of our hearts and all of our worship.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Psalms 149, praise ye the Lord. Sing
[55:35] unto the Lord a new song and his praise
[55:38] in the congregation of the saints. Let
[55:41] Israel rejoice in him that made him. Let
[55:43] the children of Zion be joyful in their
[55:46] king. Let them praise his name in the
[55:49] dance. Let them sing praises unto him
[55:52] with the timal and harp. For the Lord
[55:55] taketh pleasure in his people.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; He will beautify the meek with
[56:01] salvation. Let the saints be joyful in
[56:04] glory. Let them sing aloud upon their
[56:07] beds. This type of praise is not just
[56:10] when you're in church.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; This type of praise is not just when
[56:15] you're around the saints and showing
[56:17] off. This is even on the beds. It's at
[56:19] home. It's at work.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; This is a continual praise. Amen.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Let the high praises of God be in their
[56:28] mouth and a two-edged sword in their
[56:31] hand.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; To execute vengeance upon the heathen
[56:35] and punishments upon the people. To bind
[56:38] their kings with chains and their nobles
[56:41] with feathers of iron. To execute upon
[56:44] them the judgment written, "This honor
[56:47] have all his saints. Praise ye the
[56:51] Lord." Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Praise ye the Lord. Hallelujah.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, bless your word today.
[56:58] I know last week, Lord, you impressed
[57:00] upon me this thought for this morning. I
[57:02] pray you'd anoint it and bless it to
[57:04] every heart in Jesus name. Amen. God
[57:07] bless you. You may be seated.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to pay attention this
[57:12] morning to David's writings. And there's
[57:14] so many songs and so many truths in
[57:16] David's uh words in the Psalms. And
[57:19] David is particularly special to me. I
[57:21] identify with him very much in the
[57:24] scripture and his life. But David here
[57:26] at the very end of his writings, we find
[57:29] he speaks of the people of God. And he
[57:32] speaks of a people who God is drawing
[57:36] great pleasure from their worship. And I
[57:39] this this scripture drew my attention
[57:41] many years ago, but the Lord brought it
[57:43] back up again here today knowing this
[57:45] weekend we were giving so many efforts
[57:47] to offer our gifts and an offering to
[57:49] God. All the musicians and all the
[57:51] singers and so many gifts coming
[57:53] together. And we had a good devotion
[57:56] Friday night together and prayer of
[57:57] rededication all of us before we went
[58:00] into the concert because we wanted to
[58:02] realize that it's not about us. It's not
[58:04] about glorifying oursel. It's about
[58:06] glorifying him. It's offering a a a
[58:08] worship to God that's acceptable to him
[58:11] and then to bless the people of God. And
[58:13] so that's the purpose. There is no other
[58:15] purpose than that. And so when we look
[58:17] at this scripture, I wanted to just
[58:20] minister on it a little bit because a
[58:22] couple things in there with that we see
[58:24] is God is taking pleasure in this type
[58:27] of worship. And it's not just that he's
[58:30] taking pleasure in us, but we're taking
[58:33] pleasure in him. And when we start
[58:35] talking about that, we start talking
[58:37] about a a wonderful worship, a worship
[58:40] that comes to a high pinnacle. And that
[58:42] is when God is pleased with the worship
[58:46] and when the and he draws pleasure from
[58:48] the worship and that we draw pleasure in
[58:51] worshiping him.
[58:53] And so uh what what this is coming from
[58:56] is is I just want to present it this way
[58:59] is that this this praise has has reached
[59:02] actually a higher level. It's not just
[59:05] called praise upon their lips. It's
[59:08] called the high praises of God. I don't
[59:10] know if you ever noticed high praises.
[59:13] And this is the only place in the
[59:16] scripture where high high praises is
[59:19] mentioned. the only place in the
[59:20] scripture we always have praise and we
[59:23] have that word mentioned many places but
[59:25] this people at this time that David is
[59:28] pointing to that they they h they they
[59:30] have a distinction about them and I
[59:32] can't help but think that this is the
[59:34] bride of the last days because they are
[59:37] really the people that have the
[59:39] two-edged sword in their hand
[59:44] &gt;&gt; but I want to preach to you it's not
[59:46] just that that we have the two-edged
[59:47] sword in our hand but we have the high
[59:50] praises of God upon our lips.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; And this is a people that he's pointing
[59:55] to that it's the high praises and it's
[59:57] it's it's on their lips. And I I'm going
[59:59] to venture to say this is a prophecy of
[1:00:02] the people of the very end. After 6,000
[1:00:05] years, there will be a people arise that
[1:00:07] will reach the apex of all things that
[1:00:10] God would be so pleased with their
[1:00:12] worship. And you remember, worship isn't
[1:00:15] just singing or lifting your hands or
[1:00:17] clapping. Worship is our life before
[1:00:19] God. Worship is our offering to God.
[1:00:22] Worship is who you are even when you're
[1:00:24] by yourself.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; And so just look at it that way this
[1:00:28] morning. It's more than just what we're
[1:00:29] doing this weekend. And it it comes from
[1:00:31] a life that is poured out before God, a
[1:00:34] sanctified life. And after 6,000 years,
[1:00:37] I believe this is speaking of the bride
[1:00:39] because we'll reach the apex of all
[1:00:41] things. God will restore his word. God
[1:00:44] will give that book of redemption back
[1:00:46] to his people again. Everything climaxes
[1:00:48] at the end time. But all of that is to
[1:00:51] produce a people that have come to the
[1:00:54] apex of what real worship is all about.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; And uh David brings it. It just seemed
[1:01:03] to strike the right thing in the heart
[1:01:05] of God and it moves the heart of God and
[1:01:07] it it it strikes the right thing with no
[1:01:10] elements missing. And I want you to hold
[1:01:12] on to that worship with no elements
[1:01:14] missing because in a moment I'll speak
[1:01:16] of uh times in the Bible when there was
[1:01:19] worship going on even to Jehovah God.
[1:01:23] But it had missing elements to it.
[1:01:26] And and God does not take pleasure when
[1:01:30] worship is missing elements to it.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; He's looking to a people and he's
[1:01:35] creating a people to come to true
[1:01:37] worship. How many remember what Jesus
[1:01:39] said to the woman at the well? And and
[1:01:41] and she was confused about worship and
[1:01:44] he prophesied. He said to this woman at
[1:01:46] the well, this harlot, he said, "The the
[1:01:48] hour is coming and now is that the true
[1:01:51] worshippers will come and worship in
[1:01:54] both spirit and in truth." He's talking
[1:01:57] about our day. In other words, they
[1:01:59] won't just have they don't won't just
[1:02:00] have the spirit and lacking truth.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Nothing will be lacking. And they won't
[1:02:06] just have truth without the spirit. But
[1:02:10] when they come with the full truth and
[1:02:12] spirit, then they become the true
[1:02:14] worshippers of God.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; God brings this thing to a head.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So this is a people
[1:02:23] that's reached the highest form of
[1:02:25] worship, the highest level that you come
[1:02:27] to. And this is a people with the
[1:02:29] two-edged sword in their hand and the
[1:02:31] high praises of God upon their lips.
[1:02:34] They have the king's sword in the end
[1:02:37] time. And I want to say that the king's
[1:02:39] sword is not just books and tapes and
[1:02:42] Bibles. It's so much more than that.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; The king's sword, the word is so much
[1:02:49] more than books and tapes.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; It's so much more than just our Bibles.
[1:02:55] Because why? The sword is to be put in
[1:02:58] the hand. And when the sword struck, how
[1:03:01] many know that the sword struck the
[1:03:03] prophet's hand in Sabino Canyon? And he
[1:03:06] he said it was real and it struck him
[1:03:08] and it and and he was holding this sword
[1:03:11] and they the the angel corrected him and
[1:03:13] said, "This is not a king's sword." He
[1:03:15] said, "A king sword." No, this is the
[1:03:18] king's sword. There's only one king and
[1:03:21] he's the word of God. But I want you to
[1:03:23] notice now when we come to this, it
[1:03:25] strikes, it didn't strike the prophet's
[1:03:27] head. It struck his hand. It had to come
[1:03:30] into the hand of the prophet. And not
[1:03:33] just the prophet, but he's going to put
[1:03:35] that sword in the hand of his people.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; It strikes his hand. It strike It
[1:03:43] doesn't strike his his head. This isn't
[1:03:46] an intellectual thing.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; It's something you're able to use.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; A sword on a mantle or on a wall does no
[1:03:55] good. books and tapes and Bibles on the
[1:03:57] shelf do no good.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; The word is not just me meant to be on
[1:04:03] the wall or or or the word is not meant
[1:04:06] to be just something on your phone, your
[1:04:07] Bible on your phone. It's meant to be so
[1:04:10] much more than that. Where does it
[1:04:11] belong? It belongs in the hand of the
[1:04:13] believer.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; And why is that? It's because the
[1:04:16] prophet said, "Even though the sword be
[1:04:19] the word, it takes the strong hand of
[1:04:22] faith to hold it there and bring it to
[1:04:24] the heart of the enemy."
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; So, it's not meant to be in our heads.
[1:04:30] It's got to be in our hands.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; How many believe the word has come back
[1:04:34] to us
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; and it's not just placed in the hand of
[1:04:37] the prophet? That's very symbolic. And
[1:04:40] as he said it was real, but it's very
[1:04:43] symbolic to see that it struck his hand
[1:04:46] because that's who it that's who David
[1:04:48] is saying. He said they have the
[1:04:50] two-edged sword in their hand.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Not in their intellect, but they have it
[1:04:57] in their hand because they're going to
[1:04:59] take it to the heart of the enemy. Why
[1:05:02] did they tell me that it's good enough
[1:05:03] just to push play?
[1:05:09] just push play. And and I believe in
[1:05:11] push and play, but it's this word that
[1:05:14] we have is more I'm not going to get in
[1:05:16] a rapture just because I push play.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; And hope that don't offend anybody, but
[1:05:21] this word is not just something
[1:05:23] mechanical. This word is not just to get
[1:05:26] in our heads. This word is not something
[1:05:29] that we can just push play and we'll be
[1:05:31] in the bride and we'll make a rapture.
[1:05:34] I want to remind everybody that sword
[1:05:36] was placed in the hand of the prophet.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; It's meant to be in the hand.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; I might have just lost a few of you
[1:05:46] there.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; This sword is placed into the hand of
[1:05:51] the people. And I believe this bride
[1:05:54] holding it, she knows by character it's
[1:05:57] not meant to use on one another.
[1:06:00] Amen.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; At least she should know that
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; it's meant to use on the devil. Can you
[1:06:08] say amen?
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; And this bride is going to take it and
[1:06:11] she's going to go for the juggler.
[1:06:13] There's some young girl that's going to
[1:06:15] pierce through the spirit of immodesty
[1:06:18] of this generation and she's going to
[1:06:20] take that sword in her hand and she's
[1:06:22] going to cut through that spirit of
[1:06:23] immodesty.
[1:06:26] There's some young men that are probably
[1:06:28] sitting here that's going to take that
[1:06:29] word and it's not just books and tapes
[1:06:31] to them. They're going to put it in
[1:06:33] their hand and they're going to drive it
[1:06:34] and cut that demon of pornography. Cut
[1:06:37] that demon of lust.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; A people will have it in their hand and
[1:06:45] take it to the root of bitterness in
[1:06:46] their life.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen?
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; People are going to when they have it in
[1:06:52] their hand, he says they take it to the
[1:06:53] heart of their many enemy. They're going
[1:06:55] to take it to the core of something and
[1:06:57] take it to a root of bitterness in your
[1:06:58] life and cut that out
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; using the word that he has sent to do
[1:07:03] that. Hey, maybe they're going to take
[1:07:04] it and drive it to the heart of pride in
[1:07:07] your life and cut that pride out of your
[1:07:09] life. I as I go along I may have less
[1:07:12] amens and I'm prepared for that.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; This is not just books and tapes and
[1:07:19] Bibles. It was in the hands of the
[1:07:21] people. And I believe in the end time
[1:07:23] it's going to be more than our heads.
[1:07:25] It's going to be in our hand and we're
[1:07:27] going to take it to the heart of the
[1:07:28] enemy. Maybe it'll cut the pride out.
[1:07:31] The pride that says I'm better than
[1:07:32] everybody else. The pride that says this
[1:07:35] church is better than all the other
[1:07:36] churches. May God take the word and cut
[1:07:39] that out of our life. There is no
[1:07:41] perfect church.
[1:07:45] This isn't a perfect church and your
[1:07:47] church is not a perfect church. And if
[1:07:49] you've got that pride to lift up some
[1:07:51] church or some minister, may that word
[1:07:53] is for this to take in your hand and cut
[1:07:56] that pride out of your life.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Cut the pride out. Use that sword to cut
[1:08:04] Hollywood trash out of your life.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; To cut those clips out that you're
[1:08:10] flipping through that glorify sexual
[1:08:12] perversion.
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; That's what this word was sent for. It's
[1:08:17] not just to play around with it and sing
[1:08:18] about in church. It's to take into your
[1:08:20] hand and cut those things out of your
[1:08:22] life.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; We need to know understand why the Lord
[1:08:30] has given us this word. So they have a
[1:08:32] sword in their hand, but they have high
[1:08:34] praises upon their mouth. So I don't
[1:08:36] want to leave that part out. This is the
[1:08:38] people of the end time. They have the
[1:08:40] sword in their hand, but they have the
[1:08:42] high praises in their mouth. They have
[1:08:44] been taught to bring their mouth under
[1:08:47] God.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Causing them to say the right thing.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; The right thing is coming out of their
[1:08:57] mouths.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Now, put your seatelt on cuz I'm going
[1:09:00] to be straight with you.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; And you're saying, "You haven't been
[1:09:03] straight already."
[1:09:06] This people will not only have the word
[1:09:09] in their hands and the word restored,
[1:09:12] but they will have the right thing upon
[1:09:14] their mouth. It's interesting that the
[1:09:16] third pole was related to that sword
[1:09:18] coming in his hand. And the third pole
[1:09:20] is also related to this spoken word
[1:09:23] coming forth from the bride's mouth
[1:09:25] saying the right thing because he said
[1:09:27] little had right when the third poll you
[1:09:30] remember it of all everything that woman
[1:09:32] said the right thing. You've got to say
[1:09:35] the right word, the right thing to God.
[1:09:38] So what's coming out of these mouths on
[1:09:41] a daily basis is tied to the power that
[1:09:44] comes in this bride. It's not just that
[1:09:47] we have the message. It's not just that
[1:09:49] you have the word, but what's coming out
[1:09:52] of our mouth. Amen.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; I'd just like to add that when that
[1:09:59] happened and that sword struck brother
[1:10:01] Bram's hand, he had his hands before
[1:10:03] that sword struck him, he said he had
[1:10:05] his hands up to the Lord by himself,
[1:10:09] praying and worshiping God. And while he
[1:10:12] was praising and worshiping God, the
[1:10:14] sword struck his hand. And then he said
[1:10:17] when it was all over and that sword
[1:10:19] disappeared, he said, "I come down
[1:10:21] excited, shouting, screaming, praising
[1:10:25] God, coming down. I couldn't get wait to
[1:10:28] get to my wife. I was praising." He
[1:10:29] says, "I was jumping over rocks.
[1:10:31] Couldn't get back wait to get back to my
[1:10:34] wife to say, "Honey, this isn't the end
[1:10:36] of my life. I thought it was the end of
[1:10:37] my life. This great blast." No, this
[1:10:39] isn't the end of my life. This is my new
[1:10:41] ministry. This is the third pull. And I
[1:10:44] asked you because the third pole isn't
[1:10:46] just for brother Brandham. It's for the
[1:10:48] bride to come into.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; And how was it brought to the prophet? A
[1:10:53] sword in the hand and the right thing
[1:10:55] upon the mouth.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; So at the end time, there's an apex of
[1:11:05] the people. There's a there's a a a high
[1:11:08] level of worship. A sword in the hand
[1:11:11] and the right thing in the mouth. the
[1:11:12] third pole tied to the sword in the hand
[1:11:14] and the spoken word upon our lips. And
[1:11:17] when his people come to this, if you
[1:11:19] notice my text after let the verse six,
[1:11:22] let the high praises of God be in their
[1:11:24] mouth and a two-edged sword in their
[1:11:26] hand to execute vengeance upon the
[1:11:29] heathen. Verse eight, to bind the kings
[1:11:31] with their chains and nobles with their
[1:11:33] feathers. I just want to summarize that
[1:11:35] and say to you, when his people come
[1:11:38] into this type of worship and this type
[1:11:41] of praise, it starts to bind up kings
[1:11:45] and nobles, spiritual wickedness in high
[1:11:48] places is bound up. Now, that's the
[1:11:51] opposite of what spiritual wickedness in
[1:11:53] high places is meant to do from the
[1:11:56] beginning of all of it. It's meant to
[1:11:58] take the saints and bind them up. Bind
[1:12:00] up their worship, bind up their lives,
[1:12:03] bring them under chains. Can you say
[1:12:05] amen? But when the people of God come to
[1:12:08] this type of life and this type of
[1:12:10] worship, he's not binding us, but we're
[1:12:13] binding him up. We're binding up
[1:12:15] principalities and powers.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; I tell you, there's nothing God gets
[1:12:23] pleasure out of this type of worship.
[1:12:25] And there's nothing Satan can do to stop
[1:12:28] it.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; He can bind up the whole realm of Satan
[1:12:32] worship that starts not only irritating
[1:12:36] Satan but binding him up.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; I just stop for a minute and say if we
[1:12:42] have agreement here, how many want to be
[1:12:44] a worshipper at the last days that
[1:12:46] doesn't just irritate Satan but actually
[1:12:49] binds him up?
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:12:54] Can I be a worshipper at the end time?
[1:12:56] That my life and my praise and my lips.
[1:13:00] I don't have to do anything special. I
[1:13:02] just got to get the word and the right
[1:13:04] thing on this mouth. I got to take this
[1:13:06] sword to the enemy. And God just
[1:13:09] breathes it in with great pleasure. And
[1:13:12] he steps into your situation and binds
[1:13:15] the devil completely.
[1:13:19] We are not called in the last days to be
[1:13:22] bound by depression and bound by fears.
[1:13:25] You may be that way, but remember,
[1:13:27] you're not called to be that way. When
[1:13:29] you're in the right place as a
[1:13:30] worshipper, there is power there to bind
[1:13:33] up those devils.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; And none of it has to do with what you
[1:13:38] created. God created it. God restored
[1:13:41] the word. God gave the book back to his
[1:13:44] people. God be to speak to the prophet
[1:13:47] of this last days and says, "There's a
[1:13:49] people coming. There's a bride coming.
[1:13:52] My true worshippers, they're coming.
[1:13:57] We've reached the apex. We've reached
[1:13:59] the end." And what is God looking for?
[1:14:02] Just for us to be intellectuals and part
[1:14:04] of a movement? No. He's saying, "One
[1:14:06] day, the hour has come when true
[1:14:09] worshippers will worship me in spirit
[1:14:12] and truth." Amen.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; And you don't think the devil's going to
[1:14:16] be on the run.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; On the run.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; When she finds that place.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Let's talk about worship that is missing
[1:14:30] elements to it throughout the Bible. And
[1:14:32] I have no have no time to go through
[1:14:33] every incident. I just want to say since
[1:14:36] the fall in the garden, we seen the
[1:14:38] effects of the fall,
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; man.
[1:14:42] the the and created in the image of God.
[1:14:44] He fell. When the woman fell, they fell
[1:14:46] together. And there were so many effects
[1:14:49] of that fall. He lost his oneness. He
[1:14:51] lost everything. He lost his title deed
[1:14:53] to the earth. He lost his power. But one
[1:14:56] thing that we seen in the offspring is
[1:15:00] from the false union that union that
[1:15:02] took place with Eve and the serpent. One
[1:15:04] thing that we've seen that kind of
[1:15:06] surprises us from the offspring of the
[1:15:08] fall. And what we've seen come from the
[1:15:11] offspring is worship.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Think about it now.
[1:15:17] And to me, I would never expect that
[1:15:20] from from sin and the fall and and and
[1:15:23] and and all of a sudden now everything's
[1:15:25] messed up and man's lost his place and
[1:15:28] and and now he's born with a serpent
[1:15:30] nature and he doesn't have a he doesn't
[1:15:32] have he has a soul but he has a serpent
[1:15:34] nature to automatically gravitate to the
[1:15:36] things of the world. And so he's all
[1:15:38] messed up in sin. And yet and yet Cain
[1:15:40] himself,
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; it's worship.
[1:15:44] Yeah.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Well, number one reason is he has a
[1:15:48] soul. And when man man has a soul, no
[1:15:51] matter how far they are from God,
[1:15:53] they'll have a craving for God to
[1:15:54] worship God.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; And Cain had that as well.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; But here's another reason why worship
[1:16:01] was there right away. It's because the
[1:16:04] one who caused all this fall, and I'm
[1:16:06] going to expose him this morning just a
[1:16:08] little bit. Lucifer anointed the serpent
[1:16:12] to cause this fall.
[1:16:16] And Lucifer knew very much about worship
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; and matter of fact, he was probably more
[1:16:25] knowledgeable about what worship was
[1:16:27] around the throne of God
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; than anybody on earth, any angel,
[1:16:32] anyone. Lucifer, chief angel, chief
[1:16:35] musician,
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; right there at the right hand of God
[1:16:39] around all of the perfect worship of
[1:16:41] God. He was knowledgeable about worship.
[1:16:44] And so I'm wondering that's why now
[1:16:46] Cain, he anoints him. And now Cain, he's
[1:16:49] going to bring worship.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; You think, oh, he's a dastasterly fella
[1:16:54] just loves the things of the world.
[1:16:55] What's he want to worship for? He's to
[1:16:57] go out and just do all kinds of things
[1:16:58] in the world. No, no, it's worship. The
[1:17:00] third first thing he brings is worship.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; This is very hard for people to admit.
[1:17:09] It was worship.
[1:17:12] It was worship
[1:17:14] be but it was missing
[1:17:17] elements to it.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Now we say, "Well, he's worshiping God."
[1:17:23] I mean, come on. He's worshiping Jehovah
[1:17:25] God. He's bringing an offering. He's
[1:17:27] doing it. So, our tendency would be,
[1:17:29] surely God is loving enough to accept
[1:17:32] that offering,
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; to accept that worship. I'm here to be
[1:17:35] real clear now. We're reaching for the
[1:17:38] worship that God takes pleasure in.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Not a lower form of worship, not a
[1:17:45] worship that's tainted, and not a
[1:17:47] worship that's missing elements. Well,
[1:17:49] what was Cain's worship missing? It was
[1:17:52] without revelation.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; It was worship without a cleansed soul,
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; a redeemed soul.
[1:18:03] That's a pretty huge element missing in
[1:18:04] your worship.
[1:18:06] It was worship without the holiness of
[1:18:08] God. It was worship without relationship
[1:18:11] with God. It was worship without oneness
[1:18:13] with God. It was worship with no
[1:18:16] fellowship with God. And yet it was all
[1:18:18] worship. And Cain's worship was worship
[1:18:20] to Jehovah, but it brought what it
[1:18:23] wanted to bring to the Lord. It was
[1:18:25] worship without blood.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say, "Praise the Lord
[1:18:29] this morning." I'm speaking the truth to
[1:18:31] you. That worship that's missing
[1:18:33] essential elements. God is not pleasured
[1:18:36] in that. But there's a people coming
[1:18:38] with all the elements.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing missing.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Blood, revelation.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; A redeemed soul.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Standing there with the book of
[1:18:52] redemption
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; and their identity revealed to them.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; That's why Revelations 5, I read it last
[1:18:58] night. That's why they, as David says
[1:19:01] here, they'll sing a new song. It says
[1:19:03] that in Revelations 5 when the he takes
[1:19:05] the book they'll sing a new song.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; He hath made us kings and priests. That
[1:19:11] book of redemption revealed their true
[1:19:13] identity and it made them something.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Cain worship was worship to Jehovah, but
[1:19:22] it brought what it wanted to bring. It
[1:19:24] was without blood. It was without
[1:19:25] sacrifice. It was without atonement to
[1:19:27] purge sins. It had great fruits to it,
[1:19:30] but it offered no sacrificed life with
[1:19:32] it.
[1:19:35] God is not interested in cane worship
[1:19:37] even today.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; The music can be perfectly right, but
[1:19:42] God is not interested in cane worship.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; And I can safely say we have a lot of at
[1:19:50] the climax, we have a lot of cane
[1:19:52] worship today.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; But that's not my desire. I'm not called
[1:19:57] to cane worship. I'm called to worship
[1:19:59] at its highest level with all the
[1:20:02] elements there.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; These elements were missing in Cain. And
[1:20:07] I'd say they're essential elements, but
[1:20:09] from time on, from that time on when it
[1:20:11] was worship, but missing something, God
[1:20:13] never took pleasure in it. I wouldn't go
[1:20:14] so far as to say he rejects a sincere
[1:20:16] heart. Please understand, God doesn't
[1:20:19] just reject sincere hearts. And if
[1:20:21] they're offering what they can offer,
[1:20:22] that's fine. But he withdraws himself
[1:20:24] from worship that's missing certain
[1:20:26] elements. In fact, in some cases, he
[1:20:28] rejects it if it's missing certain
[1:20:30] elements. There are places in the
[1:20:32] scripture that show this and I don't
[1:20:33] have the time to cover them, but there
[1:20:35] are lower forms of worship even to
[1:20:37] Jehovah. There were times when God's
[1:20:39] people mixed their worship with the ways
[1:20:41] of the heathen.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; They borrowed from the heathen, whether
[1:20:46] it was Baal worship or whatever it is,
[1:20:48] and they mixed it together.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yeah,
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; I I trust some of you would pray for me.
[1:20:56] God told me to speak these things.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; It's hard, but I'm going to obey the
[1:21:00] Lord.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Normal circumstances would have there's
[1:21:03] several ministers here and different
[1:21:04] ones to have someone else speak, but I
[1:21:06] know God told me to say this this
[1:21:08] morning, and I say it with the greatest
[1:21:10] humility. I trust you pray for me. But
[1:21:12] you see, now there were times when they
[1:21:14] would mix their worship with the
[1:21:15] heathen. They borrowed too much from the
[1:21:17] heathen, and it lost its purity. It lost
[1:21:20] its originality.
[1:21:22] It lost its puress to us. And we should
[1:21:25] be very careful today to not try to get
[1:21:28] a direct copy of what other churches are
[1:21:32] doing.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; I encourage you that that our agenda and
[1:21:38] our goal is not to copy what the other
[1:21:41] churches are doing, to try to copy
[1:21:43] what's going on out there. Can you say
[1:21:45] amen?
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; But to get it original from God. Can you
[1:21:48] say amen? I don't remember David having
[1:21:51] any influences when he was on the back
[1:21:52] side of the desert and he became a
[1:21:54] musician and a songwriter and got a hold
[1:21:56] of God. He did all that by himself on
[1:21:59] the back side of the desert. He received
[1:22:01] his inspiration directly from God.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; And when he come out of that, he was
[1:22:06] ready to face Goliath.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; He had an anointing to face Goliath.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; He had the right anointing. He had the
[1:22:12] right songs. He had the right faith.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; He learned how to be a worshipper. Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; You young people, you you you have a lot
[1:22:22] of alone time because you're not married
[1:22:24] yet. You ought to you ought to be on the
[1:22:26] back side of the desert. Say, "God, give
[1:22:28] me your inspiration. Build my faith.
[1:22:32] Make me a worshipper, a true
[1:22:33] worshshiper."
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Because guess what, young people? You're
[1:22:36] going to face Goliath someday. And you
[1:22:38] need to have God preparing you to get
[1:22:40] ready for your Goliath. I'm 59 years
[1:22:43] old. I face some Goliaths. You're going
[1:22:45] to face Goliath. And you need the faith
[1:22:47] that David had to go with boldness.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Lord, make me a true worshipper. Now,
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; We must be careful. A song that's
[1:23:01] written even in denominations can come
[1:23:03] by inspiration from God. But then it's
[1:23:06] sung by someone missing a sanctified
[1:23:09] life.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; It's missing an element. That's true.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Don't think I don't think we should
[1:23:16] follow who sings it or how they sing it.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; God loves the beauty of holiness behind
[1:23:25] the person worshiping.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; In fact, the Bible's clear on it.
[1:23:30] Worship the Lord in the beauty of
[1:23:32] holiness.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; If holiness is missing, it's missing an
[1:23:36] element to it.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; God doesn't take pleasure in it.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; That's right, sir. Come on.
[1:23:43] God loves the beauty of holiness behind
[1:23:45] the person that's worshiping. He does
[1:23:46] not. It does not bring God pleasure when
[1:23:48] there's a secret life of sin behind it
[1:23:51] all. You may be the best musician and I
[1:23:53] tell you because I love you. You may be
[1:23:55] very good at it and getting better at
[1:23:57] it, but God does not play take pleasure
[1:23:59] in gifts or or uh talents when there's a
[1:24:04] life of sin secretly being hid behind
[1:24:07] it.
[1:24:09] [Applause]
[1:24:16] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo was
[1:24:18] hearing some great music put on. Bible
[1:24:21] says they heard all kinds of music, big
[1:24:23] orchestra. It was beautiful music. But
[1:24:26] don't be deceived because as beautiful
[1:24:28] it was and the variety that was there,
[1:24:30] it was beautiful, but it was missing
[1:24:32] something. Matter of fact, they had
[1:24:33] something injected is that he was that
[1:24:35] music was drawing people to wash worship
[1:24:38] an image of the prophet of that day.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Well, it's okay because it's worshiping
[1:24:45] the message. But if it's worshiping the
[1:24:47] prophet of the day, Shadrach, Meshach,
[1:24:50] and Abednego say, "No, we're not doing
[1:24:52] that. That's not what we worship.
[1:25:00] That's not the reason we worship. We're
[1:25:02] not going to worship our brother, our
[1:25:04] friend, the prophet of this hour. Our
[1:25:07] worship belongs to one person, and
[1:25:08] that's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:25:14] They say, "We will not bow. If you put
[1:25:16] us in and we burn, we're not going to
[1:25:18] bow. We're not going to bend. We're not
[1:25:21] going to change our principle. We're not
[1:25:23] buying into this because it's related to
[1:25:26] the message. We're not doing it. Our
[1:25:28] worship belongs to him and him alone.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; They were stern on making sure the
[1:25:37] worship was pure.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Not missing any elements to it.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Throughout the Bible, it wasn't worship
[1:25:46] God was looking for.
[1:25:49] There's a reference in Isaiah 66 at the
[1:25:51] beginning. He says, "Your sacrifices
[1:25:52] have become uh your elations." is is
[1:25:56] like swine's blood. So now we have a
[1:25:59] place that's bringing sacrifices the
[1:26:01] people of God and it's the right
[1:26:03] sacrifices but it wasn't giving God
[1:26:06] pleasure. And he goes on later on in the
[1:26:07] chapter he says to this man while I look
[1:26:09] to him that's poor humble and of a
[1:26:11] contrite spirit. To this man will I
[1:26:13] look. So they were bringing the right
[1:26:15] sacrifices but without a humble broken
[1:26:18] spirit. And God was not pleased.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; So it's it's sobering. And it's very
[1:26:25] sobering to realize this has been
[1:26:26] happening throughout the Bible. And then
[1:26:28] Paul brings up in the New Testament. He
[1:26:31] brings up you can give your body to be
[1:26:33] burned. You can understand all the
[1:26:36] mysteries.
[1:26:37] Anybody know where I'm going? 1
[1:26:38] Corinthians 13. It's in the New
[1:26:40] Testament, too. You can bring all this.
[1:26:42] You can understand all the mysteries.
[1:26:44] Give your body to be burned. You can
[1:26:46] speak in tongues.
[1:26:50] But if it's missing the element of Holy
[1:26:53] Ghost love,
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; he says it's as a sounding brass and a
[1:26:58] tinkling symbol.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; That means it's just noise to God. It
[1:27:03] doesn't give him pleasure. He doesn't
[1:27:05] take pleasure because you have all the
[1:27:08] speaking in tongues, all that. But if
[1:27:10] you're missing Holy Ghost love, you're
[1:27:11] missing the key element.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; I just Why you preaching this, brother
[1:27:22] Ball? Because really, if I get to it and
[1:27:24] have time, I don't want to just bring
[1:27:26] all the bad. I want to bring the good.
[1:27:28] Cuz we're headed God is forming a people
[1:27:30] in the last days.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And he will finally, after 6,000 years.
[1:27:35] Because what he's given to the bride in
[1:27:37] the last days through the prophet, he'll
[1:27:40] finally get to his true worshippers.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. I believe I'm preaching
[1:27:46] to some of them here this morning.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Many acts of service, but it's a
[1:27:53] sounding. And let me say something to
[1:27:55] you. If there's elements missing in your
[1:27:57] worship,
[1:27:58] it's just noise to God.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Music can become just noise.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And we call it the anointing. Be
[1:28:05] careful.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Be careful.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; It can be just noise. And really the the
[1:28:12] person that we're interested in is just
[1:28:13] noise to is God. If it's just if it's
[1:28:16] just a sounding brass and tinkling
[1:28:17] singing it to him, we're failing.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; I I was looking up last night. I was
[1:28:24] curious. I I love the song that we sing
[1:28:26] in the heart of worship. I'm coming back
[1:28:28] to heart of worship. And Matt Redmond
[1:28:29] wrote it. And he tells the story of a
[1:28:31] church's journey. This is back in the
[1:28:33] 90s.
[1:28:35] He tells a story how he wrote the song.
[1:28:37] I don't know if you ever read it, but
[1:28:38] his church's journey
[1:28:41] is his church took the journey with the
[1:28:43] pastor back to the core of worship
[1:28:46] after experiencing a season where
[1:28:47] worship had become overly focused on
[1:28:50] style and performance.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; The song reflects a time when the church
[1:28:56] intentionally stripped away instruments,
[1:28:58] sound systems, and other external
[1:29:00] elements to rediscover worship's true
[1:29:02] essence, a heartfelt devotion to Jesus.
[1:29:07] Amen.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; So, they went through a season. They're
[1:29:10] recognizing, first of all, we're putting
[1:29:12] too much emphasis on other things.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; And we're missing the heart of true
[1:29:17] worship. We're kind of pushing him out.
[1:29:19] And isn't that what the Leoian church
[1:29:21] did? He was on the outside, but all the
[1:29:24] worship was going good. And all the
[1:29:26] music was going good. But I'm telling
[1:29:27] you, if he's been put out, pushed out
[1:29:29] the door. You've missed what worship is
[1:29:32] all about.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Trust me, I'm not speaking to anybody
[1:29:35] personally here. my church. I think all
[1:29:37] of us musicians and singers, which I'm
[1:29:39] included in you, I think all of us can
[1:29:42] take this finetuning this morning that
[1:29:44] we have a goal to reach towards. We
[1:29:46] don't want to settle for lower worship.
[1:29:48] We want to reach for the highest of high
[1:29:51] in our worship to the Lord. Every one of
[1:29:53] you.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not here to rebuke somebody. I'm
[1:29:56] here to give you guidelines. I'm here to
[1:29:57] say, let's take this to the next level
[1:30:00] in our worship to the Lord. Amen. That's
[1:30:02] right.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Goes on to say, "The story behind the
[1:30:05] song begins with a period of reflection
[1:30:07] and reorientation within Redmond's
[1:30:10] church community. The church decided to
[1:30:12] put away their instruments and sound
[1:30:13] system for a few weeks, encouraging
[1:30:16] people to bring their Bibles and focus
[1:30:17] on what they could offer to God from
[1:30:18] their hearts. This led to a deeper
[1:30:20] understanding that worship is more than
[1:30:22] just a song and that God searches the
[1:30:24] heart, not just outward appearances."
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Amazing.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Amazing. Someone not doesn't have the
[1:30:30] truth of the last hour, but they're
[1:30:32] catching inspiration. Hold on. Wait a
[1:30:34] minute. Wait a minute here. Let's let's
[1:30:36] slow down just a minute.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Let's make sure we understand. And out
[1:30:40] of it comes this inspiration. I'm coming
[1:30:43] back to the heart of worship. And it's
[1:30:45] all about you.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Goes on to say, one of the most common
[1:30:51] lurs is an overfocus on style. that
[1:30:56] tempt that temptation has a certain
[1:30:58] ability to grab the attention of
[1:31:00] everyone who sees or hear. So we start
[1:31:02] we start acting in a place to just draw
[1:31:05] the attention of what's going to be
[1:31:06] flashy enough to draw the attention. And
[1:31:08] I believe music can brother Bram says
[1:31:11] music and healing campaigns was the bait
[1:31:12] on the hook. It has a drawing card to it
[1:31:15] to bring them to truth. But we need to
[1:31:18] use it for that
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; purely. Can you say amen? And so it has
[1:31:23] this lure to grab the attention of
[1:31:25] everyone else who sees it. Matt Redmond
[1:31:27] was one of the first to admit the danger
[1:31:28] of getting caught up in the quality of
[1:31:30] sound, the desire to be pleasing to more
[1:31:34] than simply the ear of God. A few years
[1:31:37] back, his church was on the forefront of
[1:31:38] modern worship. But the pastor sensed
[1:31:40] that in all the excellence of craft,
[1:31:43] there was a heart of praise missing from
[1:31:45] the gathering worship. The pastor of our
[1:31:47] church, Mike, did a brave thing. We
[1:31:49] stopped using the PA and the projectors,
[1:31:52] packed away our instruments for a while,
[1:31:53] and gathered it in an adjoining room
[1:31:54] with nothing but our voices and the
[1:31:56] Bibles.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; This led us into a whole new season. We
[1:32:04] stripped away anything associated with
[1:32:06] style, preference, or performance. And
[1:32:09] there was a real sense of discovering
[1:32:10] the heart of worship again. Thus, the
[1:32:13] song, I'm coming back to the heart of
[1:32:15] worship. As a church family, we'd always
[1:32:17] given a lot of time to responding to God
[1:32:19] through song. However, we'd lost
[1:32:21] something of the sense of bringing an
[1:32:22] offering. Instead, a sense of uh uh
[1:32:25] consumerism
[1:32:26] had seeped in. Songs and style and
[1:32:29] personal volume preferences
[1:32:32] and so crept and so on have crept far
[1:32:36] too high up the ladder. We lost the
[1:32:40] dynamic of worship being the
[1:32:42] allconsuming response to the
[1:32:45] alldeserving
[1:32:47] revelation of God.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; I can be corrected by that this morning.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; In his book later, he says, "After a
[1:32:57] while, the worship band and the sound
[1:32:58] system reappeared, but now it was
[1:33:00] different. The songs of our hearts had
[1:33:02] caught up with the songs of our lips."
[1:33:04] Amen.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; You had something in the churches out
[1:33:07] there sometimes they a lot many times
[1:33:10] they had a revival here recently what
[1:33:12] they called a revival in Kentucky at
[1:33:13] that college. This happened too. This
[1:33:16] revival happened. It was 2,000 young
[1:33:18] people getting together and formed a
[1:33:19] church. I really believe that people
[1:33:22] begin to hunger for the reality of God.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; And the only thing the church can point
[1:33:28] them to is maybe a show or good music.
[1:33:33] What a tragedy
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; because even this movement fizzled out
[1:33:37] because why? They had no substance to
[1:33:39] bring those young people to. I'm glad to
[1:33:42] say this morning, it's not me. It's But
[1:33:44] I believe that we have a substance.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; When somebody is hungry for God, I
[1:33:50] believe we have a place that we can take
[1:33:52] them to. And that hunger can be filled
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; not only by music and good music, but
[1:34:00] can be filled. but the reality of a
[1:34:03] supernatural God.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; There were a few times in the Bible
[1:34:12] where the worship just hit just right.
[1:34:14] 12:30. I'm aware of the time. They give
[1:34:16] me a clock back there, so don't worry.
[1:34:19] Can I go on a little while longer?
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; There are a few times that in the Bible
[1:34:25] the worship just hit just right. It
[1:34:27] wouldn't be like the our days when he's
[1:34:29] it's going to hit perfectly right. But
[1:34:31] it hit just right. And when it did, the
[1:34:33] worship struck the right thing and the
[1:34:36] right thing was there and the right
[1:34:37] elements were there. And when it hit
[1:34:40] just right, things would happen.
[1:34:42] Solomon's temple is a great example of
[1:34:45] that.
[1:34:46] There must have been all the elements
[1:34:48] there of dedication of rededication of
[1:34:52] pure hearts
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; because when they struck that and
[1:34:56] incidentally friends there was hundreds
[1:34:58] of worshippers there was hundreds of
[1:35:00] musicians there was 120 trumpets
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; I don't think they were quiet trumpets I
[1:35:05] think they were loud
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; can you say amen
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; and and and this was a hu I wish I'd
[1:35:10] have been there but to be honest with
[1:35:12] you I'd rather be here in the service
[1:35:14] this morning rather that in Solomon's
[1:35:16] day because God said he said the glory
[1:35:20] of that temple won't even compare with
[1:35:22] the glory that's in the temples of the
[1:35:24] end times.
[1:35:28] I'm glad to be here this morning cuz I
[1:35:30] believe I'm not a part of a movement but
[1:35:32] I'm part of what God's doing
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; to bring true worshippers
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; that he breathes it in
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; and it's a sweet smelling savor to him.
[1:35:43] I take pleasure in my people. May God
[1:35:46] take pleasure in my worship.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; May he be pleased with my worship.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; May he be pleased with the way I play
[1:35:53] the guitar. May he be pleased with I way
[1:35:56] I play my piano.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; How I use my voice.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; May he be pleased with it. That's right.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; That place that place began to just
[1:36:07] there was such something struck it just
[1:36:09] right and God just come down into that
[1:36:12] temple and swept in there with his
[1:36:14] glory.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Sometimes, you know, I I think it gets
[1:36:20] quiet sometimes when that type of glory
[1:36:22] comes
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; cuz nobody can really say anything. But
[1:36:25] their worship and their instruments and
[1:36:27] everything congealed in oneness and
[1:36:29] harmony and it just pleased God and he
[1:36:32] swept through that whole place with his
[1:36:34] glory.
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[1:36:42] the glory filled the temple that the
[1:36:44] minister wasn't even able to speak.
[1:36:50] In prophecy, he says there will be a
[1:36:51] restoration of the temple and the glory
[1:36:52] of the latter will be greater than the
[1:36:54] first prophecy. All the elements will be
[1:36:56] there in the end time. It will be just
[1:37:00] right in the eyes of God.
[1:37:02] I just want to say this.
[1:37:05] You know what's going to happen at the
[1:37:07] climax of these worshippers at the end
[1:37:09] time? His glory is going to come in
[1:37:11] their temples so much.
[1:37:15] this glory is going to be so much we'll
[1:37:17] take a rapture.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; They didn't do that in Solomon's day.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says in 1953 and the
[1:37:27] beautiful Rebecca came out and said,
[1:37:29] "Now ever who waters this camel," do you
[1:37:31] guys have that quote? He said, "Lord,
[1:37:34] let that be the one you've chosen." And
[1:37:35] Rebecca went and watered the camel and
[1:37:37] give him a drink and then watered the
[1:37:38] animal. Look, the very animal that she
[1:37:40] was watering, the animal represents a
[1:37:42] beast, of course, a beast of burden,
[1:37:44] which means power in the Bible. And the
[1:37:45] very animal that she was watering was
[1:37:48] the very animal that packed her to see
[1:37:50] her bride, see her groom. Is that right?
[1:37:53] And what is watering? The very power
[1:37:56] that we're watering now with praises and
[1:37:59] thanksgiving and glory and power and
[1:38:02] might is the very Holy Spirit that'll
[1:38:06] pack us up to see Jesus someday.
[1:38:10] [Applause]
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; I want to be a part of that glory.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; And I believe I am. I believe I will be.
[1:38:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:24] When you get to the end time, it shows
[1:38:25] up in the message with the prophet
[1:38:27] preaching words like, and this is shows
[1:38:29] the heart of God. He's coming to that
[1:38:31] time with the true worshippers because
[1:38:33] he's addressing worship when he preached
[1:38:35] God's only provided place of worship.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; That's not just a sermon. It's God
[1:38:41] saying
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; it's time.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; It's time that the all the elements are
[1:38:46] right.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; So, he's speaking. And God's speaking
[1:38:51] these things cuz he's coming at that
[1:38:53] time of the true worshippers.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; And that's why you find in the message
[1:38:58] he goes to churches and he sees this
[1:39:00] tight skirts. They're in the choir.
[1:39:03] They're up singing and
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; the big high heeled shoes. Come on.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Well, let's just close the service and
[1:39:19] sing only.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Take the name of Jesus with you. Child
[1:39:24] of sorrow and of woe.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; You can't eliminate that stuff from the
[1:39:31] message. But if you look at it as just
[1:39:33] some dress code, you're missing it.
[1:39:35] Amen.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; What's happening? The heart of God
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; is screaming at at those Pentecostals
[1:39:41] saying, "I'm looking for true worship
[1:39:43] and that's missing some elements.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; No, no, that tight that slit up that
[1:39:48] dress, that tight form fitting dress.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; That bobbed hair, those earrings, and
[1:39:53] you're up worshiping me, and God's
[1:39:54] saying, "Listen, uh, you know, I might
[1:39:56] respect it, but listen now. That's not
[1:39:58] what I'm looking for.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; That's not what I'm looking for yet.
[1:40:04] And it's not all about what we wear. You
[1:40:06] can have the perfect dress and the
[1:40:07] perfect modesty and still not have the
[1:40:10] heart of worship.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; But all the elements have to come
[1:40:14] together.
[1:40:15] [Applause]
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Don't
[1:40:18] Don't underestimate and don't dump out
[1:40:21] anything the heart of God is breathing
[1:40:24] on this generation. The reason he's
[1:40:26] saying it to you young girls and you
[1:40:28] sisters and you men, don't look like a
[1:40:31] woman. Don't dress. Don't men don't
[1:40:33] dress like women. Women don't dress like
[1:40:34] men. Why is he saying it? To make our
[1:40:37] lives miserable. No. He's coming to the
[1:40:39] true worshippers.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; This is it.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; And they're going to strike it just
[1:40:46] right.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; And his glory is going to sweep through.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, let my worship be right to you,
[1:40:57] Lord.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Let it be right to you, Lord. Yeah,
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; it's time to quit playing around. It's
[1:41:04] time that we don't have lower forms of
[1:41:06] worship. It's been 6,000 years of it.
[1:41:09] It's time that the highest praises come
[1:41:12] from the mouth of the people
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; as high as praise.
[1:41:19] Hallelujah. David expressed
[1:41:22] more than anyone about the power of
[1:41:25] praise. I have to take a moment on him
[1:41:27] because he he talks about it as a boy.
[1:41:29] He learned it on the back side of the
[1:41:30] desert desert. And so, you know, he
[1:41:33] expressed more about praise than anyone
[1:41:35] David did. And
[1:41:38] God used him to create music and create
[1:41:40] songs. Every revival, every inspired
[1:41:44] person of God, if they have a gift, that
[1:41:46] gift just brings forth that revival in
[1:41:49] their life. And that's what happened to
[1:41:51] David. I just want to remind the devil
[1:41:53] this morning.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; God created music. Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; And devil, you perverted it.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; God created true worship and devil, you
[1:42:05] perverted it.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Years ago, I used to read the lyrics of
[1:42:10] a song. I looked them up again last
[1:42:12] night. Excuse me for reading Barry
[1:42:13] Manalow's song. He didn't write it, I
[1:42:16] don't think, but look at what the
[1:42:18] devil's boasting of way back in this
[1:42:21] song from Barry Manalo. Only those over
[1:42:24] 50 probably will remember this song.
[1:42:27] I write the songs. Well, who's speaking
[1:42:29] here? The first verse says, I've been
[1:42:32] alive forever and I wrote the very first
[1:42:35] song.
[1:42:36] I put the words and the melodies
[1:42:38] together. I am music and I write the
[1:42:40] songs. I write the songs that make the
[1:42:43] whole world sing. I write the songs of
[1:42:46] love and special things.
[1:42:48] I write the songs that make the young
[1:42:50] girls cry. I write the songs. I write
[1:42:53] the songs. It's so warm and fuzzy and
[1:42:57] it's just oh oh something here is
[1:43:01] writing the songs and the devil is
[1:43:03] boasting
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; through that lyric from 1960 or whatever
[1:43:08] it was.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Second verse says my home lies deep
[1:43:14] within you
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; and I've got my own place in your soul.
[1:43:21] Now when I look through your eyes, I'm
[1:43:24] young again, even though I'm very old.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Devil, I'm exposing you this morning.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; You wrote this song, but it's a lie.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; I'm Oh, the the bridge says, "My music
[1:43:43] makes you dance. It gives your spirit to
[1:43:45] take a chance. I wrote some rock and
[1:43:47] roll so you can move." Well, he did come
[1:43:50] up with that. Yeah.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Music fills your heart. Well, that's a
[1:43:54] real fine place to start. It's from me.
[1:43:57] It's for you. It's from you. It's from
[1:43:59] me. It's a worldwide symphony. And for
[1:44:04] 6,000 years, it has been a worldwide
[1:44:08] symphony because it is the world and the
[1:44:11] devil's grubby mitts are all over it.
[1:44:17] I want to remind the devil this morning
[1:44:19] that you did not create music.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; My God created music.
[1:44:28] [Applause]
[1:44:29] And you may have written some songs with
[1:44:31] the wrong inspiration, but God has
[1:44:32] written some songs and given it to
[1:44:34] people. And God writes the songs that
[1:44:36] make the young girls repent.
[1:44:44] God writes the songs that make takes a
[1:44:46] sinner and redeems them by the grace of
[1:44:49] God.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; God writes the songs who gives
[1:44:53] deliverance and gives a shout of joy to
[1:44:55] somebody who's been delivered.
[1:44:58] God writes the sweet, quiet, anointed
[1:45:01] songs that will calm your nerves in the
[1:45:04] midst of a storm.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; True. He writes the songs that make the
[1:45:10] bride sing worldwide. The redeemed of
[1:45:13] the Lord say so. Can you say amen?
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; David, it wasn't that praise was the
[1:45:22] only thing he talked of. You know, in
[1:45:23] Psalms, David's real and honest about
[1:45:26] many things. His struggles, his sin, his
[1:45:28] enemies, his pressures. He actually
[1:45:30] writes songs about all that. His
[1:45:33] struggles, his sin, his enemies, his
[1:45:35] pressures, his fears. It's all in the
[1:45:37] book of Psalms. Then he came out, these
[1:45:40] came out of songs, out of his trials for
[1:45:43] us to enjoy today. But most of what
[1:45:46] comes the song I feel the pull came out
[1:45:48] of I don't mean to lift myself here, but
[1:45:50] I was here in this city 36 years ago. I
[1:45:54] moved to an apartment. I started to have
[1:45:56] services in the in in the business
[1:45:58] building below. And I just I didn't have
[1:46:01] a clue what the Lord wanted next in my
[1:46:04] life. I took a job, but I was so much in
[1:46:08] the dark about what God wanted next for
[1:46:10] me. And I went up in that office one
[1:46:13] night and God be to drop in my heart
[1:46:18] something that said, "I may not have all
[1:46:20] the answers right now, but there's one
[1:46:23] thing I can't deny. I feel the pull of
[1:46:26] God."
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; At night, I lay in bed and I begin to
[1:46:33] cry.
[1:46:34] And my heart don't understand, doesn't
[1:46:36] know exactly why. I can't explain with
[1:46:40] tongue or pin. The spirit's groanings
[1:46:42] deep within.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; But it must be God
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; here in my soul cuz I feel the pull.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; And that's all I needed to know at that
[1:46:52] time in my life.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; God has brought me through trials. God
[1:46:56] has brought me things that I write songs
[1:46:58] about. That's what songwriters do. He
[1:47:00] brings you through things like he did
[1:47:01] David. But the interesting thing about
[1:47:03] David, most of what comes out in all of
[1:47:06] his trials, he always ends up with a
[1:47:08] victory and a positive confession. He
[1:47:11] always ends up with a praise upon his
[1:47:12] lips. Praise to his God. How can the guy
[1:47:15] who sinned again with Bashibba went
[1:47:18] through so many trials, the enemies
[1:47:20] against me, he was reproached, people
[1:47:23] were talking against him. How can a guy
[1:47:25] go through all of that and he ends up
[1:47:28] with the praises of God on his lips?
[1:47:31] He ends up being the great writer that
[1:47:33] wrote about the praise of God more than
[1:47:35] anybody.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; It's not just when he felt like it. You
[1:47:39] know, David, he didn't praise God just
[1:47:41] when he felt like it. He ordered his
[1:47:43] mouth
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; to make praise a continual thing.
[1:47:49] Here's some scriptures. I will bless the
[1:47:51] Lord at all times. His praise shall
[1:47:54] continually be in my mouth.
[1:47:58] Re from the rising of the sun to the
[1:48:01] setting of the same, the name of the
[1:48:02] Lord shall be praised.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Rejoice in the Lord always. And again, I
[1:48:08] say rejoice. Somebody ought to praise us
[1:48:10] with the Lord this morning.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:15,
[1:48:15] I'll bring the sacrifice of praise
[1:48:17] continually.
[1:48:19] When you're in a trial, that's why it's
[1:48:21] called the sacrifice of praise. It's not
[1:48:23] so much here when you bring the
[1:48:25] sacrifices. It's easy when everybody's
[1:48:26] around to praise unless you come in with
[1:48:28] the dull drums and you've lost your job
[1:48:30] or something like that. But I want to
[1:48:32] tell you, David learned that's when God
[1:48:34] wants to hear you sing. He wants you to
[1:48:37] come to church.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; And you've lost a loved one and you've
[1:48:40] had the greatest trial of your life. And
[1:48:43] then all of a sudden, this worshipper
[1:48:44] rise and said, "I will worship my God.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Though he slay me, I'm going to trust
[1:48:51] him."
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:48:55] God loves to hear his people sing in the
[1:48:59] midst of their trials.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; His praise shall continually. It's a
[1:49:07] sacrifice sometimes here, but most of
[1:49:09] all, it's a sacrifice of praise when
[1:49:11] you're in your trial.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; David did it continually.
[1:49:16] I believe David really had a revelation
[1:49:19] of this. It was a revelation to David.
[1:49:21] Real joy of life comes when we find what
[1:49:24] he takes pleasure in. Can I say that
[1:49:26] again? The real joys in this life comes
[1:49:29] when we find what he takes pleasure in.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Not what we take pleasure in.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; What he takes pleasure in,
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; he takes pleasure in us. And
[1:49:38] specifically when our mouth is mostly
[1:49:40] bragging about and glorifying him.
[1:49:44] Brother Bram says, "If I'm accused, some
[1:49:47] lady said, you brag about Jesus too
[1:49:49] much. Guilty as charged.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; If that's what my testimony is on my
[1:49:57] tombstone,
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; he bragged too much on Jesus, then so be
[1:50:02] it.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; You ever seen somebody who's bragging
[1:50:04] all the time on themselves? It's all the
[1:50:06] time. They always end up telling their
[1:50:08] stories and always bragging on
[1:50:09] themselves and it's it's all about them,
[1:50:11] them them. Let's switch that over and
[1:50:13] it's always coming out about the Lord.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Let's brag on him.
[1:50:19] Amen. Amen.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Here we go. God's army coming in the
[1:50:23] last days with a sword on their hand, a
[1:50:26] praise on their lips. I believe we're
[1:50:28] coming to it. Friends, how many believe
[1:50:29] that
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; the high praises refers to, just so you
[1:50:34] know, the high praises first of all
[1:50:37] refers to an intense, fervent, and
[1:50:39] outward often an outwardly expressive
[1:50:42] form of worship and adoration to God.
[1:50:44] That's the first meaning to high
[1:50:45] praises. It's not just praise the Lord.
[1:50:48] Praise the Lord. It is an intense
[1:50:53] fervent
[1:50:56] outward expression form of worship and
[1:50:58] adoration. It goes beyond casual and
[1:51:01] perunct and and casual praise involving
[1:51:05] deep motion but it involves deep emotion
[1:51:08] loud declarations
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; high praises joyful even exuberant
[1:51:15] expression of gratitude for God's
[1:51:17] greatness and goodness. That's the first
[1:51:18] meaning. The word ha is the root of
[1:51:21] hallelujah. In the Hebrew, ha, their
[1:51:23] understanding was to celebrate with
[1:51:26] exuberance. Hallelujah. Somebody say
[1:51:27] hallelujah. Is to celebrate with
[1:51:30] exuberance. Clamorous loud to boast it.
[1:51:33] How can people get mad at people being
[1:51:35] loud when they're worshiping?
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; How can be people be critical of
[1:51:40] something getting loud? Those 120
[1:51:42] trumpets you probably would have been
[1:51:43] offended at.
[1:51:46] Oh, no. That was that was Hebrew music.
[1:51:49] I wouldn't mind it that loud. Now, I got
[1:51:50] I got a notion that you'd have been
[1:51:52] going to David saying, "Can we cut it
[1:51:55] down to 50 trumpets?
[1:51:57] It's hurting my ears."
[1:52:00] Trust me, friends, I I don't think we
[1:52:02] should go to the place that we're
[1:52:03] hurting people's ears. But don't forget,
[1:52:06] highest praise is an exuberant loud the
[1:52:10] loud sounding symbols.
[1:52:14] It was intended to be intense.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; Another Hebrew word for praise is yada.
[1:52:23] Boy, how the devil has changed the
[1:52:24] meaning of that word.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Cuz now it just means yada yada yada
[1:52:30] yada yada yada yada.
[1:52:32] [Laughter]
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; That ain't what it means. Yada means it
[1:52:36] literally means to use the hand,
[1:52:39] especially to revere and worship. So
[1:52:42] when the Hebrews would hear praise and
[1:52:44] worship, they would physically worship
[1:52:47] by using their hands, raising their
[1:52:49] hands, clapping their hands.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; It was a physical action as well as was
[1:52:57] with the mouth.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; It was intense emotion. It was not
[1:53:02] lukewarm or passive. It involved strong
[1:53:04] feelings of awe, of love, of
[1:53:06] thankfulness towards God. It means loud
[1:53:08] and exuberant expression. And it often
[1:53:10] involves loud singing, shouting and
[1:53:12] joyful declarations of God. This is what
[1:53:14] it meant in the Old Testament. It also
[1:53:16] means high praises means spiritual
[1:53:18] warfare. High praise is seen as a
[1:53:20] powerful spiritual weapon capable of
[1:53:23] pushing back the forces of darkness
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; and aligning believers with God's will.
[1:53:29] It means an outpouring of the spirit. It
[1:53:31] can be in the manifestation of the Holy
[1:53:33] Spirit's presence and power working in
[1:53:35] and through believers.
[1:53:37] But this is the last thing about high
[1:53:39] praises that I want you to catch. While
[1:53:41] music is often part of high praise, it's
[1:53:43] not limited to music. High praise can be
[1:53:47] expressed through various forms of
[1:53:49] worship and even in daily life through
[1:53:53] actions of obedience
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; and love.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; It's not just in the music. Sometimes
[1:54:04] when you worship God, you don't need
[1:54:06] music to do it.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; And if you become too dependent on music
[1:54:11] to bring you into worship, you're
[1:54:13] missing an element to worship
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; cuz he is more than the music. He is
[1:54:21] more than just what's playing and it's
[1:54:23] appealing to our ears. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; My point is if you think it's just
[1:54:28] singing in church worship or this high
[1:54:30] praises speaking or shouting or speaking
[1:54:33] in tongues, that's all a part of the
[1:54:35] church. It's all a part of the church.
[1:54:37] But it's not just that. The high praises
[1:54:41] of our mouth means we're letting our
[1:54:44] mouth be used of God for the right
[1:54:47] things.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; The third pole, sword strikes his hand.
[1:54:53] The third pole had a right saying the
[1:54:56] right thing.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; I take pleasure in this people
[1:55:00] worshiping because they have a sword in
[1:55:02] their hand and they have the high
[1:55:03] praises of God on their lips.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Not just in church, not just in front of
[1:55:09] your brothers and sisters. I said
[1:55:11] something a few weeks ago. I said, "You
[1:55:12] know what? You're complaining, your
[1:55:14] complaining mouth,
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; will never bring you
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; to more of the glory of God. Amen.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; See, I I'm concerned. I'm not concerned
[1:55:29] about the bride, but I'm concerned about
[1:55:31] her growth because she quickly grows in
[1:55:35] maybe the music and the worship and the
[1:55:37] services and maybe grows in the gifts,
[1:55:40] but God hasn't grown in their tongues
[1:55:43] enough.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; We have long hair and long dresses and
[1:55:48] long tongues.
[1:55:54] And I'm wondering, we haven't reached
[1:55:56] the pinnacle yet in this message.
[1:55:58] Sometimes we try to work it up through
[1:56:00] the music or through a service. No, no,
[1:56:02] no, no. You don't have to work anything
[1:56:03] up.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen? You don't. You don't.
[1:56:06] This revelation you don't work. This is
[1:56:07] not choosing the stimulation first. No.
[1:56:10] Brother Bram says the stimulation comes
[1:56:11] from revelation. Revelation's first.
[1:56:14] Preach the word to the people. You don't
[1:56:15] have to worry about the stimulation.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; But we would try to work up the
[1:56:20] stimulation first. You might be missing
[1:56:22] the substance of revelation.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; And so you you you you have to come to
[1:56:29] this place that you begin to you realize
[1:56:31] what the high praises of God. And I
[1:56:33] think there's too much talk that goes on
[1:56:35] and spills out of our mouths
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; and we give our I'm ending now, but I
[1:56:41] just want to hit this final point and
[1:56:43] strike the devil
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; right where it hurts.
[1:56:47] right in the heart of what he does in
[1:56:50] the people that are holding the message
[1:56:52] and got the word and the sword, but what
[1:56:55] about your mouth?
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; You may have the sword, but what's
[1:57:01] coming out of your mouth every day?
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; What's coming out of my mouth? And I'm
[1:57:06] here to say the high praises of God
[1:57:08] wasn't just last night when we're
[1:57:10] exuberating our worship or this morning.
[1:57:12] It's what's coming out of your mouth on
[1:57:14] a daily basis. And if it's complaining,
[1:57:17] you'll never come to this glory.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; If it's gossiping against another
[1:57:21] church, you'll never come to this
[1:57:22] worship.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; It's tearing down preachers. It's
[1:57:28] preaching against other preachers. It's
[1:57:30] tearing down this. And if I you feel
[1:57:31] like this morning, I I I apologize. I
[1:57:33] don't want you I don't have any right to
[1:57:35] speak against anybody else. I'm just
[1:57:36] trying to correct and say uh God is
[1:57:39] bringing us to true worshippers.
[1:57:42] &gt;&gt; And we have to give our hearts, our
[1:57:44] lives, but this word has to grow up into
[1:57:47] our mouth.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Paul speaks of corrupt communication
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; coming out of our mouth. And that's in
[1:57:57] our that's in our Ephesians. That's in
[1:57:59] our that's in our adoption chapter,
[1:58:02] Ephesians. And he talks about our mouths
[1:58:04] and corrupt communication, gossip,
[1:58:06] putting down the other person,
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Putting down the other message, church,
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; putting down somebody. Can we Can we
[1:58:14] just leave each other alone?
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Can we leave each other alone and let
[1:58:19] everybody do what God calls them to do?
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; And respect it.
[1:58:30] Can we quit backbiting one another? Can
[1:58:32] we quit criticizing one another? Can we
[1:58:36] get the Holy Ghost in our tongue and
[1:58:38] say, "Lord, I only want edifying things
[1:58:41] to come from this mouth."
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; I can't answer for the person sitting
[1:58:45] next to me, but this mouth, I wanted to
[1:58:48] bring the high praises of God.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Tear down your wife. You tear down your
[1:58:54] husband. You think you know everything.
[1:58:56] You tear down every other message.
[1:58:57] church. God, come and purge our lips and
[1:59:00] purge what we say. Clean us, Lord, of
[1:59:02] this to be the true worshippers of God.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; This is the hour Jesus said true
[1:59:10] worshippers were come will come.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; And I just got to believe it's not just
[1:59:14] the sword in the hand,
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; but it's when these high praises
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; reach
[1:59:22] their highest point.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's a people that he's
[1:59:26] drawing pleasure from.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "I'm so pleased with what's
[1:59:32] coming out of their hearts, their
[1:59:35] mouths, their lives.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; I'm breathing it in. This is the people
[1:59:42] that I'm going to finish the work with."
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning?
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:48] It's been intense. But I just I as I
[1:59:51] said,
[1:59:53] I know the Lord. There's not too many
[1:59:55] times the Lord knocks me on the head
[1:59:57] this much and says, "You preach that."
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; But don't say that to both. I want to
[2:00:04] obey the Lord. And I trust all of us to
[2:00:06] say, "It's more than just music. It's
[2:00:08] more than just choirs.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Keep doing it. Keep doing your best at
[2:00:14] it.
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; Play skillfully." I'm here to encourage
[2:00:18] this morning. Encourage you. Keep going
[2:00:20] forward.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; But God wants all the elements in
[2:00:24] worship.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; It's time for it. It's the hour for it.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; It's the hour for it.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; And we we'll use a song from somebody in
[2:00:35] the denominations that was inspired
[2:00:37] because we knew it come from God. Even
[2:00:39] that church has kind of gone arry now.
[2:00:42] And God bless them. But the inspiration
[2:00:44] of God come to that pastor and them
[2:00:45] says, "Let's take a step back."
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; And the song comes forth when the music
[2:00:51] fades.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; And all is slipped away.
[2:00:56] And I simply come,
[2:01:02] longing just to bring
[2:01:07] something that's of worth
[2:01:10] that'll bless your heart. heart.
[2:01:16] I'll bring you more than a song.
[2:01:20] For a song it itself is not what you
[2:01:26] have required.
[2:01:28] [Music]
[2:01:31] &gt;&gt; You search much deeper within
[2:01:36] through the way things appear. You're
[2:01:39] looking into my heart.
[2:01:44] [Music]
[2:01:47] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[2:01:54] And it's all about you.
[2:01:59] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:02:04] I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I made
[2:02:11] when it's all about you.
[2:02:16] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; King of this world.
[2:02:26] No one good.
[2:02:30] How much deserve
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:38] the we
[2:02:42] [Music]
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; think about it this morning. Every
[2:02:47] single
[2:02:49] sing
[2:02:52] [Music]
[2:02:54] I'll bring you more than a song
[2:03:00] for all
[2:03:03] is not what you have.
[2:03:06] [Music]
[2:03:11] You search my deeper way
[2:03:16] through the way things appear.
[2:03:22] Can we stand?
[2:03:24] Lift these holy hands to him this
[2:03:25] morning.
[2:03:27] [Music]
[2:03:35] Jesus
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus.
[2:03:40] about you, Jesus.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[2:03:49] [Music]
[2:03:52] It's all about you.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:04:02] When the music
[2:04:04] fades
[2:04:07] and all is straight away
[2:04:11] and I sent
[2:04:17] I'm longing, Lord, longing just to
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Something that's worth
[2:04:27] that bless.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Could I bring you that
[2:04:32] offering, Lord, to bring you more than a
[2:04:34] song?
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; Let the offering of my life bring you
[2:04:38] more, Lord.
[2:04:40] For a song itself
[2:04:44] is
[2:04:45] Jesus.
[2:04:47] [Music]
[2:04:52] You search my
[2:04:58] way
[2:05:02] into my heart.
[2:05:09] [Music]
[2:05:16] It's all about you.
[2:05:21] [Music]
[2:05:33] and it's all about you.
[2:05:38] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; I wonder in this moment this morning
[2:05:45] before we close, we could offer
[2:05:48] not a song, but a an offering of
[2:05:52] rededication to the Lord. Every
[2:05:54] musician, every singer, every believer.
[2:05:57] I wonder if we could lay our hands on
[2:05:58] one another and pray for one another and
[2:06:01] lift our voices this morning in a a
[2:06:04] prayer of rededication to God
[2:06:07] to give all of ourselves to him. Not
[2:06:09] just not just our hearts. How many would
[2:06:12] say, "Lord, let me give my mouth to you.
[2:06:16] May you correct what's coming out of my
[2:06:18] mouth and let it be the high praises of
[2:06:20] God, the thanksgiving of God." Can we
[2:06:23] pray for one another this morning?
[2:06:25] Heavenly Father, we're offering a
[2:06:27] rededication of our lives to you, Lord.
[2:06:30] And there are many gifts here and many
[2:06:32] people, many churches represented. Even
[2:06:35] online, they're listening. Lord, all of
[2:06:38] us, we take this moment to tell you,
[2:06:40] God, we rededicate our hearts, our
[2:06:43] gifts, everything to you that they could
[2:06:46] be effectively be used for your kingdom.
[2:06:50] But Lord, at the end, what it said about
[2:06:52] us is that they are the true worshippers
[2:06:55] of God,
[2:06:57] worshiping in spirit and in truth. You
[2:07:01] spoke of that. You said they were coming
[2:07:03] and here we are. Lord,

[2:07:36] forgive us.
[2:07:38] Get control of what is spoken from these
[2:07:41] lips. I pray, Father, let it only be

[2:07:46] building up. Let it only be the right
[2:07:49] thing. Lord,
[2:07:51] this is the power against the enemy.

[2:07:56] what to do with the people that this is
