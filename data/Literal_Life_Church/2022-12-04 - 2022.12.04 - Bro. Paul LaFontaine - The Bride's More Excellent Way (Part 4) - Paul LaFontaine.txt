========================================

Peter chapter 3 a portion of scripture we welcome is that sister Lily with us with uh I know her name but I don't know the other one what's your name sister Chantel nice to have you girls and you're sitting right behind Ryan so make sure you let you connect with Rye their own buddy buddies from way back good to have you this morning and all the other visitors God bless you all where did I say we were reading okay First Peter chapter 3. First Peter chapter 3 is we're going to take the text out of this morning mm-hmm God is good amen God is good all the time first Peter chapter 3 and verse 8 . now this portion of scripture will be that I'll read will be um in in relation to our response and our courtesy to to others and Paul comes into verse 8 speaking about marriage before I'll let you read that on your own but he's speaking about marriage and you have to have honor in marriage Christian honor and christ-like honor and marriage or the marriage does not work right and for Christian marriages if you skip back to verse 7 likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered the honor thing and the respect for one another shows up and our word shows up in our attitude and that happens every day in a marriage if it's going to be right then your treatment of one another should be with honor that's how things work right that's how the Holy Spirit works in your marriage so this is a scriptural thing so this is what he's talking about and he applies it to to the marriage first but now he just expands it to everybody when he says in verse 8 finally be ye all of One mind and having compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing that's not how we respond is that they were evil to me so I'm going to respond with the same thing they deserve it but contrary wise blessing knowing that did he just say that we respond with the blessing to somebody being evil to us yes he did not many amens on that one but yes he did that's what he said that's how we respond contrary wise a blessing knowing that ye are there into called so this is a calling as a Christian did you know as a Christian it's not just being a Christian that you're called to what the scripture says you're called to that this is a calling the rest of the world doesn't have a calling you have a calling you also have a calling to take this gospel into the whole world you have a calling to be a witness can you say Amen you don't live in your own little your own little world but we're called to be witnesses to everybody and so we're called to this type of Life of responding and blessing instead of evil for evil that ye should inherit a blessing verse 10 for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile let him issue evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it let's pray heavenly father bless your word anoint it to day Lord I pray you'll give me Grace from your throne that I can minister to it in Lord in the way that you want it to come across and we commit that to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you shake somebody's hand as you sit down today in Christian love God bless you each one now by the grace of God I'm I'm uh I'm just going to take a couple more of the attributes of divine Love In First Corinthians 13 to take our time with this and this series is called the bride's more excellent way because Paul introduced something greater than the gifts and all these other things something better a more excellent way and I'm preaching that more excellent Way To You Paul introduced it to the church back in First Corinthians 13 and so I'm going to hold up more of the attributes of the image of Christ First Corinthians 13 just to bring you into the channel that we've been speaking of First Corinthians 13 in your Bible to me is a window it's a window into the deepest place a Christian can enter First Corinthians 13 is the deepest place that a Christian can enter in their Christian wall it is deeper than all the other manifestations of the spirit and what it does it's deeper than all the other manifestations of the spirit in the church and what it does what he presents is the more excellent way is beyond faith how many believe that we preach Faith how many believe that just stay back at the other screen we preach faith and we believe in faith how many believe that you can have faith to move mountains how many believe God can raise the Dead how many believe there's enough faith in this word that come that the blind eyes can be open cancer can be healed God is nothing impossible with God and we need perfect faith we need Faith to do that so we're not dumping out Faith how many believe that's important for us to read our Bible and to get knowledge of the word of course it is how many believe it's important important just to have knowledge read the word but to ask God to give you Revelation the word because reading is is one thing but Revelation is another of the word Jesus talked about Revelation the disciples asked him why do you speak in Parables why do you speak in Parables why don't you just come out plainly he said because it's given to you disciples to know the Mysteries Behind The Parables but it's not given to some and so I speak in Parables to draw the attention but if we'll ask God he'll give you the meaning for the parable and you'll understand the word can you say Amen so we believe in knowledge we believe in reading our Bibles we should do that we believe in faith but what Paul introduces here is deeper than the manifestations of of the spirit deeper than the gifts it's beyond faith it's beyond knowledge it's beyond good works this is something for a Christian Beyond good works and how many believe we should do good works of course we should that's part of our Christian Journey as well we should do good things we should give to the poor but when he says though I give my body to be burned and give all my goods to feed the poor and have not charity I am nothing this more excellent way has to be our pursuit or all the good works that we do mean nothing so we can't pursue those things and a lot of those things sometimes feel better is to give to the poor you feel good about yourself it feels good when you're Anointed with some type of gift of the spirit oh it's it's some it's it's it feels good but yeah listen Paul says you can have all that and not have Divine love and can you say Amen and sometimes when you preach on Divine love what I'm going to do today it doesn't feel very good let me just warn you when I get into the traits today it's not going to feel very good because most of us most of us are going to leave the service today saying Lord I I need help can you say man I need help but nevertheless it feels better to give the poor it feels good when you rise to a faith and pray for somebody lay hands and they're healed of cancer that feels better and God will continue to do those things but we if we ignore in our Christian walk this more excellent way we are a troubling person because we're ignoring the most excellent way and the the better thing for the Christian to pursue and so it's beyond faith it's beyond knowledge it's beyond good works it's beyond of what true Christianity has always produced for two thousand years it's this this love is greater than hope it's greater than Faith Can you say Amen let me ask you this this morning if we are in the end time and if we are on the finishing the Capstone of God's work in a people for two thousand years Christianity started 2 000 years ago and so now God has been in this work to take out a people for his namesake to take out a people to to bring them to a culmination to a Capstone if we are in that finishing Capstone work on God's people then shouldn't we be entering into the best expression of who he is at these Final hours I'm asking shouldn't this be the time that we enter the final Capstone and the final expression of who Jesus is in a people I think it's time and if Paul opened to us the more excellent way shouldn't this be our desperation more than any other thing that this be our expression as a Christian that this be if Paul opened it up to us shouldn't this be our desperation more than anything I think it's a good question shouldn't this be our Pursuit more than possessions more than careers more than School more than education don't dump any of that out but there's a Pursuit more than more than that that fishing boat that your brothers want right more than that new dress that new outfit your sisters want and you're you're given hints to your husband the next few weeks more than any other Pursuit this as a Christian should be Lord I got this lane from me God this is the final age is the final time God let the people see this Divine love in my life can I get an amen this morning praise the Lord so but because but you see that's the pursuit it is the more excellent way that a Christian will live We tend to fall back on our known our ways that are known to us of gifts in the church and knowledge in the church and good works we tend to fall back on that but this is a whole other thing altogether and it's also I've been preaching to you that this Divine love is not just a giving to the poor this Divine love is not in human effort it doesn't originate in us as humans it doesn't originate in our minds this don't try to mechanically put this on this morning this Divine love only comes through one source and that's the Holy Ghost himself living in the soul this is not human love this is his Capstone Divine love living in you so we just yield ourselves because he wants to express that and so it's the full expression of his character expressing his bride his wife and that's why you have the term bride showing up at the end of the Bible quite a few times the bride the bride the bride who's the bride because the people that God has taken for his namesake the people is are in the final expression at the end I read the scripture to you the spirit and the bride say come he speaks of a bride in the Book of Revelations because the final culmination to God's work is he Christ will take a bride a many many membered body he will take a bride for himself and she will become into a marriage at the end time she will marry Christ and then it talks about the marriage supper of the Lamb that we go to I'm gonna blow your mind a little bit the marriage of Christ is not to come someday when we go in heaven the marriage is happening now we go to the marriage supper a marriage is the union can you say amen and the marriage the spiritual union between Christ and his bride is not coming someday it happens at the end is he the word Christ presents himself and the bride says yes I will be become your wife I will obey your word I will follow your word I will become your word I will Express what your word says there's a lot of groups of people a lot of churches let me just say it this way and I think I said this when I started the church in Toledo 30 33 34 years ago I kept saying this because I was looking up in the phone book and I I was saying there's like seven or eight pages of churches well on one side you could say praise the Lord you know there's Christian churches that are preaching but then I thought as the Lord began to show me that that God wants something more than just more churches God's not looking for another church to start he's looking for a bride and then I was wondering where the statement holy Toledo came from holy toledo and I found out I researched and I found out that Toledo had more churches per capita than any other city I don't know if it's the same but at that time 30 years 30 years ago Toledo had more churches per capita than any other city in the United States and that's where the term came from holy toledo but I've lived here for 33 years and Toledo is not holy it's not holy there's there's a lot of Unholy things that happen every night every day and so you can't so how you have to be honest and say if you have more churches doesn't guarantee you have more holy people if you have more churches that are using the Bible even praise the Lord we thank God for that but we have to have a result that God is calling a people for his namesake he's not calling another church he's not calling people to religion but he's calling a bride to marry in this last days how many want to be a part of that bride we don't need more churches we don't need another church Toledo has a lot of churches but Christ is looking for a bride he's calling a bride in the last days to be married to him the word praise the Lord amen that's scriptural you believe it without a heart so let's start this morning you say well you already started no I'm starting right now that was all just the opening so let's start by reading my text today in the Amplified and go into the subjects this morning on Divine love the next oh I do this right I okay I hit the button all right so this is the scripture we had in our text in the Amplified so let's make sure we get it as we go into this theme of what the theme is today finally all of you be like-minded United in spirit sympathetic brotherly kind-hearted courteous and compassionate towards each other as members of one household say no there's a lot of households here no really you got your household but you're when you become a member of the body of Christ you're a member of One household the body of Christ so now that's why we treat each other because this is brothers and sisters this isn't just some alien that's sitting next to you here this morning maybe you might treat him like an alien I don't need that person I don't need to shake their hand I don't it makes me uncomfortable shaking hands I just want to come if you want to come for a while and you don't want to just talk to anybody then you you should come and sit on the front seat and then you'll be undistracted by people and you just look at me you're welcome to do that now you don't have to sit the front seat you say whatever you want but listen now people kind of get this way but you you if you're born into by a new birth into Christ you're born into a household you're born into a body so just like at home when you got a household with all different brothers and sisters and kids uh young or old and it doesn't matter you're a household so now we see every day what it takes to make a household rung and I'll tell you you're not going to have a good household without without courteous compassionate forgiving kind-hearted brotherly if you if you violate those things what kind of home are you going to have so if it works in a you know it has to ask you have to have certain boundaries of respect you have to have certain things you have to love one another when somebody's unlovable you have to repent you have to talk it out if you want a functioning household well that works the same in the household because he says be sympathetic be brotherly kind-hearted courteous and compassionate towards each other as members of one household and humble in spirit and never return evil for evil or an insult for an insult avoiding scolding avoiding scolding berating and any kind of abuse it's interesting that abuse any kind of abuse but it's interesting abuse is used with something you're saying it's your words it's when you're scolding you're using your tongue your words when you're berating you're using your tongue your words can you say Amen so those when he says the abuse today abuse abuse is not just physical abuse there are many forms of abuse and verbal abuse is one of them so in our words we got to bring our tongue under subjection to those that we're supposed to be honoring and it has to express itself in being courteous and compassionate even when we disagree now some of you might have households where you you you agree on everything and everybody's laughing you know if you do meet me in the office because I'd like to ask some questions what you're doing right all right but listen so we don't agree on everything but when we disagree we we don't we don't go here to being discourteous or disrespectful or scolding or abuse you don't have any right as a Christian to go the direction of abuse verbally just because you disagree and just because somebody's not doing what you want to do want them to do can you say Amen so so berating any kind of abuse I like to talk more on that because we have way too much abuse going on today even sometimes in Christian homes and because because people don't know what abuse is they don't know what they're doing they've developed habits over time habits in their home that they come from and they just do it because they think it's normal and it just passes on from generation to generation what your household was normal this is the way we did it so you just start abusing you start lashing out whatever comes from your past home and but as a Christian you got to stand still and said no wait a minute I'm the one by the grace of God would like to break the cycle of homes being in such a disarray giving it a normal status that it's normal to just scold somebody and walk away and never repent of it I need to know Lord help me because you're presenting to me a what a Christian home is and a Christian Body of Christ this is the way we should function if you want to leave today and ignore just this scripture and say nobody can live like that you go right ahead but for a Believer he's saying Lord I don't have all that yet but it's your word and the word does not come in just word only but power and demonstration and I want to see the Holy Ghost bring a demonstration of this word in my life avoid scolding berating in any kind of abuse but on Con on the contrary give a blessing pray for one another's well-being contentment and protection for you have been called for this very purpose this isn't just an instruction that you intellectually okay I'm gonna go home and do this this is a calling you've been called by God to this you ever hear somebody running from a calling a minister can run from years from a calling and he feels this urgency in the inside something's there I don't know what it is and and but they can run from a calling and usually the one that's running has the calling and you're never going to get away from it if God's called you you can fight for 10 20 years but if it's a calling he's called you to you're going to have to address that someday and unbelievers don't care about this but Believers you have a calling to live this way and to treat people this way and from the pastor down to the Pew from the pastor to the janitor whoever it is this is our calling for you have been called for this very purpose that you might inherit a blessing from God that brings well-being happiness and protection for this is the rest of it for the one who wants to enjoy life and see good days whether a parent or not the one who wants to enjoy life can we show a raise of hands who wants to enjoy life who well the reason wants to see good days can't guarantee every day is going to be good but if we're pursuing something we can have more good days and we can have we can have enjoy life a little better and that's by saying I yield myself in humility that I'm going to say Lord take over my tongue and my character and my attitude and let me treat everybody in this household and in the household of God with respect let's say praise the Lord amen so now laying that down as we take the next two attributes of divine love these two next ones are tied together these two next ones are tied together and so the first one here is love is not rude you'll have to go back and listen to the other attributes we've been through I think five of them we'll take two more today so love one of them today is love is not rude and the second one is love is not self-seeking this is in First Corinthians love is never rude Love Is Never self-seeking because it's not about you right lane it's not about you it's about Christ yeah I'm quoting Lane this morning who gave that admonition to his mom one Wednesday night as she was struggling to get to church and almost gave up to come to church because of the traffic and because everything going on and trying to get him to church and trying to and just pulling her hair out but it wasn't too bad she still has her hair this morning and Lane says when she drives in frustrated into the parking lot Lane says but Mom it's not about you and out of the mouth of babes he speaks the truth thank you Lane so love is not rude and love is not self-seeking both of these are complete opposite both of these tied together because they're the complete opposite of a self-centered person God's love is never selfish and never self-centered can I say it again you'll never find in the true genuine love of God self-centeredness or selfishness you can't find it in the love of God so if you still have some of that then it's not coming from the the Divine love that's in the Holy Ghost not coming from that it's coming from something else and it's hard to move into a life of divine love when you have self-centeredness or selfishness so now we're going to go into the first one which is love is not rude so First Corinthians 13 5 says does not behave itself unseemly that's the way it's worded in First Corinthians but it means love is not misbehaving love is not behaving it's about behavior when you're acting rude to somebody you're you're treating that person bad you're more about yourself than their feelings and and it's about Behavior does not behave itself unseemly which means it doesn't love does not behave itself dishonorably or improperly Divine love of God is not rude to someone else Divine love of God is not rude to someone else it is not dishonorable it doesn't dishonor it's not behaving improperly and I'll add Titus 3 2 in the ESV to speak evil of no one to avoid quarreling to be gentle and to show perfect courtesy toward all people love is not rude Divine love is never rude or self-seeking Divine love is not rude and so now love does love does not needlessly offend love has good manners love is courteous it is polite it is sensitive to the feelings of others and always uses tact the reason we are not courteous of course is that we are thinking only of ourselves and not of others not honoring the other person and so now this is bringing us into saying Lord help us this morning because every person has a right of my honor as we preached a few months ago every person I owe the love of God to every person I owe it I'm in debt to every person that's what the Bible says you oh suddenly say well they I they don't owe me nothing and I don't owe them nothing you can't say that as a Christian you stay over there I stay over here I don't owe you anything it's not true if you have the love of God you owe them you're in death you owe everybody the love of God you're in debt to them because God gave it to you and it's not just for yourself can you imagine now I've got the love of God for myself but it becomes selfish with the love of God there's no selfishness in the love of God there is no holding back in the love of God so then this description of Love In First Corinthians 13 includes a list of what love is not and love is not rude we read that love is not rude in verse 5 love then has good manners the Greek phrase could literally be translated does not act unbecomingly that's why it says does not behave itself unseemingly because in the Greek it says love does not act unbecomingly or does not act inappropriately notice it's not what you're thinking it's how you're acting this isn't about what you're thinking because you could say do you love them and you say you might say yeah I love them it's not how you think it's not your words but it's your behavior and your words that are expressed to say whether you love them or not love has honor love has respect love has a tolerance not for something off the word but it has a tolerance for that person's growth may God help us may God help me to have a tolerance for a person's growth in the Lord and where they're at our attitude has to show something in our behavior that love cannot ever be rude to someone no matter what state they're in and no matter how rude they're treating you the Greek phrases does not act Unbecoming it doesn't act inappropriately Christian love does not seek to cause problems or it does not belittle others Christian love involves choosing appropriate actions and responses that help other people rudeness is finding more and more Acceptance in today's culture I'm reading from a writer now a few things on rudeness and I agree with this completely rudeness is finding more and more Acceptance in today's culture things have changed in the last 10 20 years in rudeness people are becoming more rude stay at a light too long texting and you find out how rude we get rudeness is more and more accepted today and become normal but it's not normal in God's Kingdom what's normal in the world and I'll tell you you should take this for every subject what's become normal and in the world what's become normal in American lifestyle don't you dare accept that as normal as a Christian lifestyle you know what I find that there's a lot of Christians today they're Christians but they don't live a Christian lifestyle they live an American lifestyle and I could take some time right now and describe the American lifestyle and basically in lifestyle they live just the same as the world but they're Christian but I believe that a Christian does not take on an American lifestyle or a European lifestyle or an American Spirit we have a different Spirit we're from another kingdom altogether can you say amen and though we may be humans like other Americans if we have the love of Christ and the Holy Ghost within us it'll bring a different lifestyle in our lives they used to have a show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous I wanted to preach a sermon sometimes lifestyles of the poor and unknown all right I'll preached that one this morning the other one everybody's quiet so maybe I'll preach this one lifestyles of the spiritually poor and unknown that's what most Christians today are spiritually poor can you say Amen they're they're unknown or sometimes they're spiritually poor and popular some of our singers that are the most popular singers in Christianity they are popular and they are they're they're maybe rich and they're they're known but you look at their lives and they're spiritually drained and poor not all of them but a lot of them and a lot of Christians today are spiritually poor it's a lifestyle can you say man it's the lifestyle so rudeness is finding more and more Acceptance in today's culture public behavior and words that were Unthinkable a generation ago are now being commonplace now commonplace we live in what the uh SAS marrow Marco in the Wall Street Journal calls a Renaissance of rudeness I read the article it's the Renaissance of rudeness we're in the age of rudeness and it's increasing one writer says that our politicians in the last four or five years have taught us that it's okay to be more rude and because they do it then we can do it because we're all we're all followers can you say man we're sheep God made a sheep so we're not we're followers so the image is what they do what they say if it becomes normal for the Hollywood stars and for the politicians we develop it must be normal for us so rudeness it's the Renaissance of rudeness because these people start doing it it becomes normal to walk up in an award show and just basically haul off and slap somebody in the face and get a free pass for it right you don't think that Millions eyes are watching and so the next day if they get angry it becomes normal you just walk up and slap that wife in the face or slap that child in the face we're taught by Hollywood and our leaders in this culture it is the Renaissance of rudeness we're being taught through what we feed on that it is normal to be rude when we feel like it when you're having a bad day that it's okay to be rude thank you when a woman is having a difficult time at a certain time in a month then it becomes okay to be rude I'm here to say for a woman or a man it's never okay to be rude we justify rudeness we justify how we treat one of the people thankfully there's some families that when you're rude which I have been all of you have been thankfully we have some families either you're not going to correct that unless there's a complete disclosure and an apology and say I was wrong I was rude to you I belittled you and that's how we get through this stuff can you say Amen our goal is to lead less and less rude until we have Divine love only Divine love coming from our vessel does anybody hear what I'm saying this morning are our our desire because you see our I loved it when brother rap spoke Wednesday night is such a powerful message on the Holy Ghost and what it is please go and listen if you haven't heard it I haven't heard it in a long time the Holy Ghost broke down like that but one thing's for sure he was talking about taking the pulse of something and we take the Pulse based upon whether we have the evidence of Holy Ghost not it's not about signs and miracles and wonders or speaking in tongues can you say man the evidence says do you do you do you believe but the greatest one is taking a pulse of your desires the pulse of what whether you have something real or not is your desire because you can make a lot of mistakes but what is it you desire and your desire will make you repent and make it right and say God don't let this fruit come from my life let it stop with me Lord I desire not just to go repent to my son or my daughter or my wife or my pastor I desire not just to repent but I'm saying Lord not only bring fruits or repentance changed me that I stopped doing that can I get it amen this morning change me Lord that I stop being rude that I stopped this just making people feel so mistreated take the Pulse of the evidence and the pulse is our desire because God's looking at our desires if you don't have the Holy Ghost you don't have the true desire for the things of God you'll never have the desire for the things of God and more of his word unless you have the truly and that's the evidence that you have it it's not speaking in tongues it's not intelligence it's not how much you know of the Bible it's the Life of Christ Living you that is the Holy Ghost and it's he changes your desires and hunger for the word of God and when God's diagnosing you other people diagnose you do they have the Holy Ghost or not God diagnoses by has your desire been changed and he's working off of your desire what do you desire this morning your life may be shadowed with all kinds of sin and all kinds of past and you don't feel worthy to even be in this building but what is your desire because if he can fill you with his desire things are going to be different in the years to come how many want them to be different in the years to come things are going to be different for your life Mercy is going to rewrite your book Mercy is going to rewrite your biography Mercy rewrote my life can you say Amen grace and mercy will rewrite it and the passes in the sea of forgiveness and now I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I'm still a human being but I got a desire to serve the Lord I'm going to work off of that desire I'm going to read the word I'm going to stay close to him I'm going to direct my children the right way and I'm going to repent when I need to repent and I'm going to give it all to God and my future will be better than my past somebody say praise the Lord it works off your desire what's your desire this morning I got all this all over me I got my my spirit is full of all kinds of trash from the world what's your desire take that desire no matter how small it is and say God I desire for things to be different but getting back to rudeness we're in a generation of that we are taught to be that way that it's normal if you're having a bad day I've been looking some of the conditions that the prophet described way back in the 1950s as a nervous and neurotic age in the 1950s a nervous and neurotic age if it was in the 1950s people are scared people are nervous and I will say people are under guilt some of his guilt some of it they're nervous and nervousness and pressure will make someone act rude they didn't mean to do it but pressure will make them blow their stack and treat everybody with rudeness we're nervous and neurotic we're we're more nervous than we ever have do you know that some of it is the judgments of God are looming over this world you don't think human beings know we're almost there it's not if it's when there's not many preachers that preach the judgments of God are coming but the Bible says the judgments of God we're almost here we're in pre-tribulation right now there's more diseases that hit the earth there's more afflictions that's at the Earth there someday we'll get more things that cancer will look like a toothache there's more homosexual diseases coming attributed right to homosexuality monkey pox how appropriate that name because when man begins to without the Holy Ghost without the holy ghost man becomes Beast and Romans 1 says it man becomes like a beast and Men turn to one another that's what the Bible says and then you have a disease coming from it I'm not condemning you brother I'm trying to trying to bring conviction in your life if you're looking at me there in the screen or here today and you've got that Spirit on you that's never normal that's never right that's not what God intended for you to be you learned that and you took the wrong Spirit God has better things for you you can be delivered of that that is an Abomination to God but God can God can deliver somebody and you won't be Abomination but you'll be a son of God filled with the Holy Ghost the very image of God can you say Amen but how appropriate monkey pox because man without the Holy Ghost turns back to monkey and Beast again not a monkey because they can't find the missing link between us and monkeys we know what it is that there was a beast in the garden in between humans and monkeys so close to us the serpent and he was dissolved after the fall he spoke he stood upright he spoke to Eve so he's very close to human because he could speak to Eve but God after that dissolved his form and put him in the form of a serpent as we know what a serpent is did I just blow your mind it's what the Bible says he said well I've never heard that before well it's what the Bible says we know the missing link and it's not we're tied to monkeys we're tied in our human first birth to the serpent that beguiled Eve and misinterpreted the word to her and we fell because of a misinterpreter misinterpretation of the word that's not in my subject about rudeness but it might be some of the reason people are just rude that comes from the serpent nature the serpent nature was in Cain and he murdered his brother you'll never find that originating in God so I'd say if he murdered his brother I'd say he had some rudeness doesn't come from the love of God it comes from the the dark side can you say Amen can you say you love me thank you thank you I'll take all I can get here this morning feeling emotionally unstable so I need your support people are under lots of pressure they're nervous the Judgment Day of God is looming and the people know it and they're scared but none of that all that nervousness never none of that ever gives Christians a right to be rude can you say Amen look at us we don't want to look at each other hardly we're looking at our phones all the time even at home when we're sitting across on the couch to one another look at this look what we're doing could I say that that's a level of rudeness when someone's trying to have a heart-to-heart conversation and we're in our phones you say well I can multitask not a heart-to-heart conversation somebody's lied to you somebody's made it normal to you I said don't bring your phones in the church because people were you know doing business and looking at things on their phones in the church if it's your Bible I guess that's fine but we'd rather you not have it because can't you give can't you give an hour hour and a half of your life away from that phone but it's a part of the rudeness in this generation can you say Amen it's a part of the rudeness there's a rudeness that is that is here today and people are but there's so many levels of this rudeness rudeness turns into violence it's not just happen on your phone being on your phone but it rudeness turns into violence can you say Amen that someone to take children's lives in a school or wherever it's at uh and and you know have no sensitivity they don't know who they are they just snap and they so destruct disrespect human lives there's no value for human life not only cussing them out but murdering them Time Magazine wrote an article back a year ago why everyone is so rude right now and they said September was bad A bad month for manners it says on the 21st a woman pulled a gun on servers at a Philadelphia fast food restaurant when they asked her to order online she pulled a gun on him on the 16th several women from Texas pummeled a host is that a New York City family style restaurant a few days prior to that a Connecticut mother was investigated for slapping an elementary school bus driver and that same week a Californian woman was charged with felony assault for attacking a Southwest Airlines flight attendant and dislodging some of her teeth we're going through a time where physiologically or psychology of people's people's threat system is at a heightened level right now says Bernard golden a psychologist and the author of The overcome destructive overcoming destructive anger this period of threat has been so long that it may have had a damaging effect on people's mental health which was for many has been uh further uh debilitated by isolation loss of resource the death of loved ones and reduce social support during covid there has been an increase in anxiety a reported increase in depression and increased demand for mental health services he adds lots of people in other words are on their very last nerve this is true he adds whether they believe the virus is an uh was a a threat or whether they don't believe it was a threat half the people fear covet said golden half the people fear being controlled so I can label it I think like brother Chad labeled it in Lima this was a pandemic of fear that's accurate it was a real pandemic and we did what we could to protect ourselves but you're not looking at the bigger picture if you think it was just covered was the problem because there's people if they didn't fear code it was just some of us who didn't they did for coven some people feared the government take over the government control what they use for covet to control things more and if if you don't think that was part of it you're blind the government's going to start using everything and here I am in uh saying this this internationally if you think it was just covet or if you think it was just that and not the government moving into the spirit that the Book of Revelation saves the moon to for controlling one day they say you're not be able to buy or sell unless you receive the mark of the beast we're headed to a government control can you say man that's exactly scriptural whether we want it or not can you say Amen but half the people were fearing covet half the people be if you're being controlled and so it was a code a pandemic of fear and now they're saying we're still under the results of going through covet because of this this rudeness that has increased this violence that has increased it wasn't like Americans were exactly overlooking their differences before the pandemic some researchers point to the increase in the increase in crude public discourse both from political leaders in online discussion which encourages outsized emotions oh my goodness I've been preaching that for quite a few years that online social thing and all this thing that people are feeding on can encourage outsized emotions as the Gateway rudeness that has led to the current wave we don't filter ourselves as much as we used to we don't check ourselves as much as we we don't watch what we say as much we used to on the internet people feel like they can say anything they no longer guard themselves and I think they transfer that lack of filter into public life so they learn there's no filter I can do and say whatever whatever I want and then they don't bring any filter to their interaction at the job or at church and they give themselves permission to be rude at the very beginning of the pandemic people just didn't know how to be polite it was hard to communicate a smile and it became necessary to avoid rather than Embrace people but after a certain point the unintentional rudeness became intentional and deliberate it's meant to call attention to what they see as this kind of unjust policy some demons some discrimination or some infringement on some other right says Zach in the minds of some individuals snapping at the flight attendant is not rude anymore it's a civil disobedience but rudeness is never civil and it's never a civil disobedience the Renaissance of rudeness perhaps you read about Lakeisha beard the 39 year old woman who was charged with disorderly conduct for talking loudly on her cell phone in the designated quiet car of an Amtrak train as she traveled last weekend from Oakland California to Portland Oregon according to the old Oregon State Troopers who finally escorted her off in cuffs she had talked non-stop on her phone for 16 hours despite repeated complaints and warning from all the people rude she's being told she's rude she don't care the fact is that rudeness is rooted in selfishness can you say Amen ERS are meant to reduce the friction of human interaction that's an interesting statement matters are meant to refuse reduce the friction of human interaction correct manners Christian manners conduct words we say are to reduce the friction in human interaction because humans have friction with one another you got different personalities you got your irritations you got your past and then you got the other dimension that's full of devils that's trying to get you to argue trying to get you to fuss because Satan hates Oneness when Jesus did miracles none of the disciples took up Stones against him but when he said the words I and my father are one then they took up stones the devil hates Oneness and if you're becoming really truly one with Christ truly and this word get ready for the devil to fight get ready for your home to have sometimes more friction because the devil's screaming and the demons are screaming no no we've got to stop this we've got to stop this Oneness friction comes but God puts this courtesy in order to reduce the friction of human interaction discourtesy reveals a lack of consideration for others the ill-mannered person is communicating that it's all about me the song doesn't go and it's all I'm coming back to the Heart of Worship and it's all about me it's all about me Jesus and Jesus is okay don't think I'm weird Revelations 3 says because of their lukewarm lifestyle in the last days I will spew them out of my mouth that's right yeah he hates a lukewarm like he'd rather be cold in the world or on fire for God but when you're lukewarm God says I feel like spilling you out of my mouth you'd like you to be one or the other decide what you're going to be I'll love you the same but decide you need to decide you're going to be a miserable person until you decide I either want to be an on fire filled with the spirit Christian every day or I'm going to just be on fire filled up worldly person don't be lukewarm and so it's all about me I'm a songwriter so I can do this it's all about me Jesus no we're coming back to the Heart of Worship and somebody wrote that probably that got the Revelation it's not about the songwriter it's not even about the artist it's not the worship isn't about worshiping the artist who's singing it I'm coming back to I believe it was inspired to say this I'm coming back why is the songwriter saying that who's in the Christian Realms because we've had about 50 60 years there that it become Christian music became about Hollywood became about the artists become those people aren't worshiping God they're they're worshiping the person just like Hollywood worship Their Stars and somebody caught a revelation Lord forgive me this isn't about me this is about you may I direct the worship towards you it's not about you it's about him right lane oh right lane it's not about you it's about Jesus do you go to the bathroom you feel better now all right it's good to have you back sorry I just embarrassed you my dad used to do that my brother Ike all the time I don't know where he is right now but he used to do it all the time around the country we traveled all those years around the country like five or six years old sitting on the front row because Dad I think made him sit on the front row so he could keep his eyes on him and Ike would get up and start walking halfway back while Dad was preaching he'd say Ike where are you going well that's rough to the bathroom and sometimes dad would say okay go ahead sometimes you say no you don't need to come back sit down oh Lord talk about doing damage I don't know where he went he was here a minute ago I'm going to do it to him sometime again I shed a car to wherever he went out here I should have caught him today Mike where are you going to trigger all that past I seem to be doing it a lot lately with people it's trigging things like that so hey we got to move on to the next one I think that's enough about rudeness I don't know where he's at his where's he at is in the back room okay so he's watching all this on the screen back there all I know is his 50th birthday is coming up the end of the month and I'm going to have to now buy something very very nice for his birthday love is not rude and love is not self-seeking seeketh not her own Philippians 2 3 that's how it's word in the Bible seeketh not her own love is not self-seeking Philippians 2 3 in the end of I do nothing do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit through factional motives or strife that's why brother Branham taught us to check our motives all the time because with our motives we can be doing wrong things but did you know that you can be doing the right things with the wrong motive so we don't check what we did as much we check our motives for why we did it because that's the Hidden World right do nothing for selfishness or empty conceit through factional motives or Strife but with an attitude of humility being neither arrogant nor self-righteous regard others as more important than yourselves can you say Amen it is not it is not selfish does not demand its rights one writer says the secret of every Discord in Christian homes communities and churches is that we seek our own way excuse me the secret to every Discord in Christian homes communities and churches is that we seek our own way and our own Glory rch Lesinski put it this way if you cure selfishness you plant a garden of Eden another writer says selfishness is the root problem of the human race it is the antithesis of love which is self-sacrifice and you got a temper you got something about you makes you talk when you ought not to talk you got a temper you got something about you makes you talk when you ought not to talk so I guess evidently there's times that we ought not to talk if you're angry Under Pressure that's not the time probably to talk but you better come back and talk later oh God lay it there now lay it there watch the fire of the altar come down and take it away watch the love of God Lick It Up watch all that old selfishness the way you've been talking to your wife the way you've been talking to your husband the way you've been talking to your neighbor the way that you've talked about the people in the church and pretty much covers it lay it on the altar this morning and the fire of God will come down and take it right away and divine love will burn in its place and we can raise your hand say I'm in agreement with the word of God let Divine love burn out the rudeness and selfishness and let Divine love take over and let Divine burn it in its place praise the Lord what we need tonight is not an arguing on the a little Creed but what we need tonight is the Holy Ghost and Fire old-fashioned powers of God to burn sin and selfishness disrespect for each other burn it out of us with the love of God that's right now remember it's only the sick that demands attention service just the stick they demand attention and when you see a preacher and may I not only limit it to a preacher but may I limit it to every church member that wants attention I'm somebody just remember there is a spiritual sick person they are needing attention Pride that we talked about last week pride and arrogance and someone who is about themselves I'm somebody and belittles everybody else whether it's a father to his children a husband to his wife a pastor to his congregation I'm somebody that's for you who did not know and have not researched the nicolaitan spirit in the Book of Revelations in the early church within just a few years he he rebuked the nicolaitan spirit Nico and the Greek is conquer Nicholas conquer Leighton there's a laity they begin to conquer the laity and through over time it put all the Holiness behind the pulpit and took the Holiness and holy ghost out of the people so all people need to come to do is go to their priest come on the Holiness is all behind the pulpit you see that's the nicolaitan spirit we believe the original church was that God did not just fill Peter and the leaders but he filled every believer in that upper room with the Holy Ghost the laity get the same Holy Ghost as the preacher does praise the Lord amen uh a limit every Churchman that wants attention I'm so it's not just that they have arrogance Pride but sometimes they need attention that's why they brought all the attention to themselves and say I'm somebody but they're needing they're needing attention their Spirit that's a spiritually sick person that's self-centered they need the attention of the spirit of God to give them something that will take that attitude out of them and heal them for from their selfishness should we have a prayer line to see selfishness healed because the prophet said they need something to heal them from their selfishness not just their toothaches not just cancer not just their broken hip but they need healing for their selfishness I'll let you ponder that one a little bit this week heal them from their selfishness and their big ideas and the big me and little you the Holy Ghost makes us all the same praise the Lord ah okay I I don't know okay I've got just a little bit more time would you turn with me real quickly um I want to reference a scripture here back in first Samuel chapter 25. can you give me about 10 minutes this is not a 20-minute sermon this morning are you learning anything amen you sit at Jesus feet and we learn from his word he's the word first Samuel 25 . I want you to look at something that is here uh David is not coming to his throne yet and now he's kind of with his men and going in conquering different places and he's Gathering his army and he comes to this certain area and they see a rich man there called nabel and he has a lot of food and he has a lot of things we can get food so they're hungry so he's going to request David's going to request some get to get some food from some of their men respectfully okay so they're coming through the area and verse 2 says about uh nabel and there was a man in Mahon whose possessions were in camel and the man was very great had three thousand sheep thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel and now the name of the man was nabel and the name of his wife was Abigail and she was a woman of good understanding of a beautiful countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and that sureless nabel was labeled as being a husband who was rude trellis means rude and mean-spirited nabel was rude and mean-spirited and but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he was of the House of Caleb and David heard in the wilderness that neighbor did hear his sheep David sent out 10 young men and David said unto the young man so let me make the long story short because of my time here this morning and you promised to hold on so he sends his man ten men and he's going to ask respectfully ask this man enabled send a message to him you guys are are you guys are got food here and uh you're shearing the sheep and you got different things so can we borrow some of this as we go through respectfully and we're not going to do anything we're coming through we mean War everywhere but we're going to come through we will leave your men alone we'll be respectful to it so here's here's the the rude guys response to David verse 9 and when David's young men came and they spake the neighbor according to all the words in the name of David and cease because he said go to them in my name and David's thinking this guy's going to have respect for his name tell him this is in my name I'm the son of Jesse I I'm this that the other I'm set to be king just throw that in you guys are not just on your own you're coming in my name it's kind of like the Christian we come in his name and so he goes and when the young young David's young men came they speak the neighbor according to those words in the name of David and ceased and nabo answered David's servants and said who is David he's not even on my radar list who is David and I'm sure he's heard of him but he's rude and he don't care who David is and he says who is David and because they said we come in the name of David the son of Jesse who is David and also who is Jesse they mean squat to me this guy's rude your name your boss means squat to me who's this guy there'd be many servants nowadays that break away every man from his master there's a lot of people in this world but I've heard maybe heard but who's David to me that's really what he's saying who's David to me so this guy's rude and so shall not shy then take my bread and my water and my flesh that I've killed for my shears and give it unto men whom I know not whence they be so David's young men turned their way and went again and came and told him all those sayings next step and David said unto his men gerd ye on every man his sword and they girded on every man his sword and David also guarded on his sword and there went up after David about 400 men and 200 Abode by the stuff I'll leave 200 but this guy's disrespected me this is a Rude Dude and I'm going up with just his little kingdom there I'm going up with 400 sordid guys now we know David's the type of Christ but guess what this ain't that part I say that part and there's some other things in David's Life That's The Human Side and that's the type of Christ and it only takes a revelation to see when Christ is coming out you're going to see it in a minute when Christ is coming out and when David's coming out and guess what his this guy's rudeness David is reacting to his rudeness with the same rudeness in our original scripture says we don't fight evil with evil we don't fight argument with argument we don't fight back with the same thing somebody's fighting with us with there has to be something comes from the depths of our heart to say Lord let me stop let me settle down here because it never works you're never going to win when it's all a spirit of argument let me stop right here let me respond in the right way let me wait let whatever and David did not do that he said this guy's rude he's churlish he's he's disrespectful to me and my name and everything God's called me to do get your swords I'm getting mine and we're going to show him later on he says in the scripture there won't be one animal left in his entire Kingdom not it no there won't be one scratch of anything of nabel left it's a bit rude you can't respond when somebody's rude to you with more rudeness or vengeance I'm going to get back to them they don't know who I am can't do it so to make a long story longer the men come back to Abigail's wife and says he's coming for you he's coming for the whole thing Abigail gets some food together and she comes and Bows before David pleads her husband's case she actually enters into she's she's actually going to absorb the iniquity of her husband that's another sermon altogether but I'm telling you you even find the Life of Christ in Abigail doing that you know first you can ask your question why'd she ever marry this Rude Dude she knows him better than David obviously she's lived with them how she ever married this guy I'll never know and girls pay attention young girls single girls pay attention I don't know how she married it she didn't know he's churlished before she didn't sit down and pray and God show her don't marry him he's churlish is that what the word is am I saying it wrong people are looking at me funny yeah churlish I don't know why she even why she did this but she comes She lays before and said let my verse 25 let not my Lord I pray thee regard this man of Baal Belial um the man of Belial uh I don't have that written down but the sons of Belial and the man of Bilal she's not calling him nabel she's saying he's a son of emptiness and wickedness and worthless there's a generation that he called the Sons of Bilal they're just they don't have anything good within them and I married a son of Belial even nabel for as his name is so is he oh well that's interesting somebody needs to underline that because that's what that's what brother Branham taught us that your name means something has an attachment to it your name means something uh name enables his name and Folly is with him that's what his name means but I iodine handmade saw not the young man my Lord whom thou descend now therefore my Lord as the Lord liveth and as I so liveth seeing the Lord hath with those withhold me from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with my own hand now let thine let now let thine enemies and they that seek evil to my Lord be as Naval and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my Lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my Lord here you go and she's standing in the Gap I pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid it's not her trespass it's his she's absorbing it for the Lord will certainly make my Lord a sure house because my Lord fighteth the battles of the Lord and evil hath not been found in the holidays do you realize what this woman was doing I'm closing I know where I'm at I want you to notice something don't miss this okay it's this bride this woman here that has caught a revelation of David's position when he forgot it he's forgot his position because he's called to become King David and he's called her the right thing and she even says they're not bound there have not been evil found in the all the days if he goes and does this there's going to be evil he's going to wipe out a guy just because he was rude to him that's not acting like King David that's not what his calling is and she is used to remind David hey my husband's like this this isn't you can I say to you this morning as a minister of the Gospel if you're sitting here hungry for the word hungry for the Holy Ghost you may act out of place sometimes but if you have a desire for God if you act out of place that's not you or I should say that's not who you're meant to be that's not your calling so this scripture shows they are sons of Belial who will always be rude and die rude and we leave it up to them how God judges them on the day of judgment but there's some predestinated people like David who are meant for the throne I believe I'm preaching to some here this morning and you have to be reminded when you make a mistake repent of it make it right but don't ever let the devil tell you that that's completely you said David I got to read the next scripture David yes a man yet a man is risen to pursue thee verse 29 and to seek thy soul but the soul of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle of life and that is actually the bundle of Love Your Soul this is incredible she's pointing out what's in his soul and she's saying this isn't in the soul of my husband but this is what's in your soul is different than what's in my husband's Soul you're acting out of place yet a man rise to pursue and to seek thy soul but the soul of my Lord shall be bound in the bundle of love with the Lord thy God and The Souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out is out of she's separating that there's something different in The Souls of men and the ones that have the souls that are predestinated seeds they may act in the flesh sometimes but they don't have that in their soul they have another calling they're destined for the throne can you say Amen and when he acted out of place it was going with 400 men to destroy Naval that wasn't acting the way he should act a woman corrected him and caught the Revelation and reminded him David this isn't you repent of this don't do this turn around and guess what he listened to her because he knew what she was saying is the truth David this isn't you you haven't done this don't start doing this aren't you glad for the grace of God that comes in services and speaks to the road and you could be filled as defeated as you can feel and yet he loves you to come and tell you that's not you you're a son and daughter of God that's not in your soul that's not what you're meant to be that's not your calling stop living like another man stop living like another woman and submit your life to what your purpose is in life that my purpose is not to be another statistic my purpose is not to be rude like the rest of the world my purpose is to react with Christ the image in my life to every situation perfect Faith Masters every circumstance Let It Be Lord that my life expresses them the only thing that comes out of this vessel is divine love in every situation in every bit of rudeness in everything that I've dished out in life let it be expressed let's stand together let's Worship the Lord give him a hand this morning that he chose you [Applause] it's what's in your soul it's your desires can you say Amen try to be good to one another try to shake hands and be friendly and nice tear down all the walls of partition around you God bless you I love you that's malice and indifferent ungodly tear it down keep doing good to one another every time you meet one another make yourself be good to one another and the first thing you know it'll grow around you till a bundle of love will wrap around you how many want this morning but a bundle of Love Abigail said you're wrapped in a bundle of love this isn't you you got to be wrapped in a bundle of love that's who your calling is let me be wrapped in a bundle of love and that'll wrap around you Hallelujah that's the making of God what did he say about little old David when he was up there she said your soul Abigail said your soul is wrapped in a bundle of love amen when Abigail met the great woman that met David we know that your enemies will be flung out like a sling that's right said because you're wrapped in the bundle of the love of God oh brother where there's prophecies it'll cease where there's healings it'll fail where there's all this will cease but when that which is perfect is come the love of God will set us together praise be to God I give him glory [Applause] there's more I'll pick it up again next Sunday oh I love him don't you key of C I love him I love him because he first loved me there's only one way to express Divine love of God when you have a revelation how much he loves you he loved you before the foundation of the world you weren't even born yet and Christ died because he loves you went to Calvary for you there is no greater love than what God has given your life and when it begins to Dawn on you and come on you by Revelation you don't have a problem loving the next person you don't have a problem forgiving and you realize how much he's forgiven you [Music] let's pray before we sing may this Holy Ghost Divine Capstone love be molded into us and expressed and projected I need it Lord more than anybody else in this building this morning I can say that honestly before you Lord you know me you know how I've been rude sometimes Lord forgive me Father and this image that I lay here before the people it's for me too Change Me Lord changed me as a man change lives change these homes change these marriages may we grow to become a big bundle of divine love expressed Lord I pray this wouldn't just be a sermon but we would weep in Repentance toward you Lord and a cry in a heart of desperation we need this more than anything else in our lives granted father to the sick to the hurting to the ones who are hearing these things for the first time and the ones who've heard it for many years we all need you Lord we need you just lift your hand if you would say Lord remember me today remember me do not pass me by I need more of you thank you for your gifts in the church thank you for my possessions thank you for my car that I can drive Lord thank you for my family but I need something more than all these other things you've bless me I need more expression of your Divine love if you need the Holy Ghost this morning I wouldn't leave here till you say father please fill me with your Divine Spirit change my desires Lord whatever you need he has for you granted father as we commit these words to you for the furtherment of the kingdom of God and to each that's listening online help them Lord not to look strange at me but to ponder the word and pray and take their Bible and pray and see if these things are so I ask it in Jesus name
