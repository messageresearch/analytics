[0:00] if we could say i just i see different
[0:04] brothers and different ministers i start
[0:06] calling names i'll probably miss
[0:08] somebody and
[0:09] i don't want to do that but i i just so
[0:11] i want to tell you i
[0:12] i love each and every one of you amen i
[0:15] just think it's just an honor to be able
[0:17] to
[0:18] stand and serve in the same army of the
[0:20] living god
[0:21] and may god bless you god bless the
[0:23] wives and everything god bless you
[0:26] hebrews 11 verse 32
[0:29] and what shall i say more for the time
[0:32] would fail me to tell of gideon and of
[0:35] barack and of samson
[0:37] and jephthah of david also and samuel
[0:41] and of the prophets who through faith
[0:44] that's very important who through faith
[0:47] subdued
[0:48] kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained
[0:51] promises
[0:53] stopped the mouths of lions quenched the
[0:56] violence of fire
[0:57] escaped the edge of the sword out of
[1:00] weakness
[1:01] were made strong waxed
[1:04] valiant in fight turned to flight
[1:08] the armies of the aliens women
[1:11] received their dead raised to life again
[1:15] others were tortured not accepting
[1:18] deliverance
[1:19] that they might obtain a better
[1:21] resurrection
[1:23] what we just read was just as glorious
[1:26] as kingdoms being subdued
[1:30] god's got to have vessels that stand
[1:33] no matter what's taking place they're
[1:36] standing
[1:37] for the lord jesus
[1:40] others had trial of cruel mockings and
[1:43] scourgings
[1:44] yay moreover of bonds and imprisonment
[1:47] they were stoned they were sold as under
[1:50] were tempted
[1:51] were slain with the sword they wandered
[1:54] about in sheepskins
[1:55] and goat skins being destitute afflicted
[1:59] tormented of whom the world was not
[2:01] worthy
[2:03] they wandered in deserts and in
[2:05] mountains
[2:06] and in dens and caves of the earth and
[2:09] all these
[2:09] and these all having obtained a good
[2:13] report
[2:13] through faith receive not the promise
[2:17] god having provided some better thing
[2:19] for us
[2:20] that they without us should not be
[2:23] made perfect amen may god bless you
[2:27] bless the reading of the word as you're
[2:28] being seated
[2:31] paul is is writing here and letting the
[2:36] generation be known of those that have
[2:40] come before all through the old
[2:41] testament that
[2:43] this these great mighty acts that were
[2:46] were done
[2:47] that it was through faith it was through
[2:50] faith
[2:51] in a living god but it was not just the
[2:54] faith
[2:55] of those people but it was god's faith
[2:58] that was released to them
[3:00] that would that so superseded their own
[3:03] faith and it was god
[3:05] working through their lives to achieve
[3:08] and
[3:08] by yielding to that they obtained a good
[3:11] report
[3:12] paul speaking of the anticipation that
[3:15] those who were
[3:16] they were looking for a coming event of
[3:19] the messiah
[3:20] and the outpouring of the holy spirit
[3:22] they they
[3:23] they stayed they stayed steadfast and
[3:26] they looked for the promise
[3:27] in their in their time they were
[3:30] steadfast with that but
[3:32] in that in that time we realized that
[3:34] many of them has
[3:35] as they had went on by way of the grave
[3:38] but yet
[3:39] god as he came within that set time
[3:42] to raise up and make that promise now of
[3:46] the outpouring of the holy spirit
[3:47] after the lamb had been offered up and
[3:50] crucified
[3:51] buried resurrected ascended on high and
[3:54] i want to just say
[3:55] in in this manner all of this that we've
[3:58] read about here
[3:59] it was a drama the whole the whole bible
[4:02] is a drama it is as brother branham
[4:05] would allude to it many times
[4:07] it is a it's a drama that has been laid
[4:10] out and many times you'll find
[4:12] in the lives of of some of the people
[4:14] that we
[4:15] refer to and even haven't referred to
[4:17] here in this scripture
[4:19] they didn't altogether speak things of
[4:21] prophecy
[4:22] but sometimes it was simply their life
[4:25] as it was yielded to god would speak out
[4:28] in prophecy
[4:29] that there were going to be others that
[4:31] would come that would
[4:32] actually be the fulfillment of the types
[4:35] and
[4:36] different things that lay within their
[4:38] life now you know a drama when we
[4:40] begin to look at a drama there has to be
[4:43] a casting of that drama
[4:45] and to think of how that what was what
[4:48] what how paul would write this
[4:50] he would speak of different ones that
[4:52] already served their part
[4:54] in the drama in the shadows and types
[4:57] and
[4:57] and they fulfilled their part within
[4:59] that drama now
[5:01] i want you to remember one thing as we
[5:02] think about this
[5:04] god doesn't hold tryouts
[5:08] this drama god is not saying well i'll
[5:10] just see who's gonna
[5:12] we'll see if this one will do it no god
[5:14] already
[5:15] has his cast chosen
[5:19] they're not a cast that maybe somebody
[5:22] else would pick or say
[5:23] i think this one will make a good fit
[5:26] god's not considered
[5:28] anybody else's opinion god already has
[5:32] his cast
[5:33] and his cast is his children
[5:36] those genes those seed of his own
[5:39] choosing of his own substance of his own
[5:43] loins it's all laid out in a bed of time
[5:46] just like in that of that play and that
[5:48] drama
[5:49] paul would write it like this and say in
[5:52] first corinthians
[5:53] you see your calling brethren how that
[5:56] not many wise men after the flesh
[5:59] not many mighty not many noble are
[6:01] called
[6:02] but god hath chosen the foolish things
[6:05] of the world
[6:06] to confound the wise god hath chosen the
[6:09] weak things of the world
[6:11] to confound the things which are mighty
[6:14] and base things of the world and things
[6:16] which are despised
[6:18] hath god chosen yea and things which are
[6:21] not
[6:21] to bring to not things that are that
[6:25] no flesh should glory in his presence
[6:29] but of him are you in christ jesus who
[6:32] of god has made unto us
[6:34] wisdom righteousness sanctification and
[6:37] redemption
[6:38] that according as it's written he that
[6:40] glorieth
[6:41] let him glory in the lord now i want to
[6:45] speak here just just a few moments
[6:47] on on a thought out of weakness but i
[6:51] want to
[6:52] look at it of out out of weakness but
[6:55] with the thought
[6:55] of casting the drama and when we we
[6:59] think of this
[7:00] you know perhaps maybe in school and you
[7:02] know in school or other things you know
[7:04] that you've had to do maybe in a
[7:06] in a bible play or whatever there's been
[7:09] parts that's been rolled out and
[7:10] somebody tries to look and say
[7:12] who can we get that would fit this part
[7:15] sometimes they can look for maybe
[7:17] somebody let's say somebody they want to
[7:19] play
[7:20] mary and they could say maybe not that
[7:23] little girl she's kind of she's a little
[7:24] rough
[7:25] she went i don't think you want her
[7:26] playing mary i don't know if she'd be
[7:28] able to
[7:28] handle it real good nothing wrong with
[7:30] the little girl she might fit better
[7:32] in another role but you see god
[7:35] specializes in looking
[7:37] deeper than what you can even see
[7:40] about yourself you see our
[7:43] understanding of our self is limited but
[7:46] god can see to the depth of that which
[7:49] is already
[7:50] sown within our life that maybe hasn't
[7:53] come to an expression
[7:54] but god knows what's there and it takes
[7:57] somebody
[7:58] to take an interest in you that knows
[8:00] about you
[8:01] to tell you really who you are to let
[8:04] you know
[8:05] the potentials that lay within you
[8:09] and so when we think of this of weakness
[8:11] i know that's not a term
[8:13] especially that likes to be used even
[8:16] when we
[8:17] think about it in the world it's not
[8:18] even a term that if you are going to
[8:20] choose
[8:21] people it's not a term that you would
[8:23] think about
[8:24] you would not choose about the choosing
[8:27] people who are
[8:28] weak whether it's emotionally physically
[8:30] or whatever you'd say
[8:32] i don't want nobody's weak but god
[8:35] chooses and desires
[8:37] weakness but it's not weakness like you
[8:40] and i think of it
[8:41] god when god is speaking of weakness as
[8:44] the scripture says
[8:45] out of weakness we're made strong
[8:48] god is speaking of a complete
[8:51] surrender you see it when we look at the
[8:55] word
[8:56] surrender it's there's a word that very
[8:58] similar with it
[8:59] is yielding you see god when he's cast
[9:02] this drama
[9:04] god is not interested in somebody trying
[9:07] out for the part
[9:08] and telling him i think it would be
[9:10] better
[9:11] if i did it this way or if i stood
[9:14] over here but god god doesn't need
[9:17] nobody
[9:18] to tell him how to run his business
[9:21] as a matter of fact god doesn't even
[9:23] need you
[9:24] to tell him how to meet your needs
[9:28] he already knew your needs he knew what
[9:30] your need would be
[9:31] right here tonight god already had it in
[9:33] mind it's already in the script
[9:35] god has the drama everything is set
[9:38] sometimes you might be waiting
[9:40] and you're looking and saying well where
[9:41] is these pieces coming together
[9:43] but remember as god taught us through
[9:46] the prophet's ministry
[9:47] be patient you wait on god whoever has
[9:50] to sit in that chair
[9:52] the handkerchief has to be here glasses
[9:54] here
[9:55] this person's in the room just be
[9:57] patient because
[9:58] if you're looking to god you cannot
[10:02] miss what god has for you
[10:05] the bible says in psalms 1 19 you can do
[10:08] no iniquity
[10:09] when you're seeking after god when
[10:11] you're when your heart is set on god
[10:13] everything that god has for you
[10:16] he will make sure you don't miss it
[10:18] he'll make sure
[10:20] that you catch each part of the junction
[10:23] and what it is that you have need of
[10:25] what we read about was god's heroes
[10:28] these are heroes and i want to say it
[10:30] like this i believe right now as i can
[10:32] look around
[10:33] this room even of of of i think the
[10:36] different brothers you know brother paul
[10:37] brother ron
[10:38] different ones that's around some of
[10:40] some of the veterans around in here and
[10:42] and others oh god doesn't just have
[10:44] heroes back here on the
[10:46] pages there's heroes that's standing in
[10:49] this
[10:49] hour in the face of satan's eden let me
[10:52] just say it to you like this
[10:54] for you as a young person to stand in
[10:57] the midst of satan's eating this
[10:59] is the most deceptive age that's ever
[11:02] been upon this earth
[11:03] and for you to make a declaration that
[11:06] i'm going to serve god
[11:07] you might say i'm not where i need to be
[11:10] but there's a pulsation in your heart
[11:12] that says
[11:13] i want to serve god i'm telling you
[11:16] right there
[11:16] that's something god can work with
[11:19] god put that inside of you
[11:23] it's god drawing that out of you it's
[11:25] god who's already
[11:26] casted the drama now he's just
[11:29] assembling his subjects
[11:31] he's assembling those that are in need
[11:34] for the part to be acted out through
[11:37] before these
[11:38] as we look before they ever could ever
[11:40] be strong
[11:42] they had to first get weak they had to
[11:44] first get weak you see
[11:46] brother brown would tell us like this he
[11:47] says out of weakness
[11:49] and humility you know humility ain't you
[11:53] or me walking around with
[11:57] somebody can walk around like this and
[11:59] inside there like this
[12:02] then humility is not the position of the
[12:04] body humility is the condition of the
[12:08] heart
[12:10] it's not thinking it's not thinking it's
[12:13] not thinking less of yourself
[12:16] looking down on yourself it's just
[12:18] you're not putting yourself
[12:20] up there you put yourself under the word
[12:24] it's not belittling yourself out of
[12:27] weakness and humility
[12:29] god chose to build his kingdom out of
[12:31] isn't it a coincidence
[12:33] god will choose he will choose those
[12:36] to bring forth promises that you and i
[12:39] could look at
[12:40] and say god to bring forth a promised
[12:44] son
[12:45] and you choose a man by the name of
[12:47] abraham
[12:48] and his wife is barren oh there's been
[12:51] some mix-up in the cast here
[12:54] something's not right but you see
[12:57] god doesn't choose us based on our
[13:00] strengths
[13:02] he knows your abilities because he put
[13:04] them in you he knows your talents don't
[13:06] despise your talents
[13:07] but don't ever try to take your talents
[13:09] and serve god
[13:10] without having them surrendering and let
[13:13] god use them
[13:15] god knows what they are because he put
[13:17] them in you college didn't put them in
[13:19] you teachers didn't put them in you
[13:21] all they did is tap into a channel and
[13:23] there's an
[13:24] interest that was already sown in there
[13:26] it's just like when somebody goes to be
[13:28] an engineer
[13:29] hey there was already traits and things
[13:31] that even when they were a baby
[13:33] and other things start coming out later
[13:35] on they love math that's why i'm not an
[13:37] engineer i don't like math
[13:40] i mean i like math when it comes to one
[13:42] one one boneless chicken breast
[13:44] another boneless chicken breast i'm that
[13:46] kind of math but but the other kind of
[13:48] math i'm not an engineer that way
[13:50] but god knows these things as they lay
[13:52] within our life
[13:53] and to think brother brown would say
[13:54] like this he said if we ever make it to
[13:56] heaven
[13:57] we'll stand in a with a bunch of people
[13:59] that's been
[14:00] weak and rejected and cast out by the
[14:03] world
[14:03] and knowing nothings
[14:05] [Applause]
[14:08] there's something within us we like to
[14:11] be accepted
[14:14] that's not an ungodly thing
[14:17] it's just having that channeled in the
[14:20] right
[14:21] way if you have to be accepted
[14:25] and you compromise in order to be
[14:27] accepted
[14:28] you're really not being accepted
[14:31] are you hearing me but you see it's
[14:34] within you
[14:34] to desire to be accepted so
[14:38] how then what is the right acceptance is
[14:40] to
[14:41] be really who you are and say god
[14:44] if you find yourself saying you know i
[14:46] need some real i need some real good
[14:48] people in my life
[14:50] i need some real christian people in my
[14:52] life then you look to god and say
[14:54] god i want to meet some individuals lord
[14:57] that really i can be myself
[15:01] brother samuel that seems awful simple
[15:03] god cares about you
[15:05] he cares about these little things
[15:06] sometimes we're putting things
[15:08] so far way out there that we forget to
[15:11] ask him because
[15:12] he's mindful of every decision
[15:15] and every part of our life god cares
[15:18] think about it god you know when you
[15:20] look at all the rest of the other
[15:22] animals you know
[15:22] like brother graham says a horse can run
[15:24] a lion can bite you and
[15:26] you know and a bear and things like that
[15:28] squirrel can go up a tree
[15:29] he said but a sheep stands helpless
[15:33] and that's the way god wants us is to
[15:35] realize that we're totally
[15:37] insufficient then god takes that person
[15:41] and begins to mold himself into that
[15:44] person now let me just qualify this not
[15:46] that i need to
[15:47] but this is not where you look at it and
[15:49] say oh i've tried to serve god
[15:51] i just can't do it that's not what he's
[15:54] saying
[15:55] he's saying that when you would come to
[15:58] a place to recognize
[15:59] lord i can't do it on my own
[16:03] you put this desire in me it's you that
[16:07] put it in me
[16:08] it's magnetized to you lord i'm trusting
[16:11] in you
[16:12] to give me the strength in my life
[16:15] what's
[16:15] needed lord god that my life might be
[16:19] filled and satisfied that's when you see
[16:22] yourself
[16:22] insufficient and you realize yourself as
[16:25] a sheep what does a sheep do
[16:27] a sheep know my voice a sheep that can
[16:29] be led
[16:30] is that right think of it then god when
[16:34] he comes into your life
[16:36] remember when god comes in he comes into
[16:39] the very
[16:39] depth of your life god deals with that
[16:42] soul
[16:43] that first nature god wants that first
[16:46] nature
[16:46] to agree with him when it finally starts
[16:49] to agree
[16:50] with him and it comes in agreeance god
[16:52] kills it right there
[16:53] and god raises up that seed on the
[16:56] inside
[16:57] by the quickening power that's the
[16:59] temple
[17:00] not made with hands this body
[17:04] and this human spirit then becomes
[17:07] the visible like this is right here it
[17:10] becomes the visible
[17:11] display of what is on the inside
[17:15] that's why paul said no you're not your
[17:18] body is a
[17:19] temple of the holy ghost see god
[17:22] dwelling within your life so
[17:23] it's not you or me trying to act out the
[17:27] word
[17:29] it's not that at all it's not us looking
[17:31] at the word i mean
[17:33] you know they talk about when people
[17:34] take apart i
[17:36] i don't know i'm not an actor but what
[17:38] i've understood is that some when they
[17:40] try to get
[17:40] somebody they have to take a part in the
[17:42] script and somehow they have to
[17:45] so immerse themselves into a place
[17:48] to where they actually take on the
[17:51] identity
[17:52] of that character they have to take on
[17:54] the persona of it
[17:55] they have to take on how that person
[17:57] talks and you know how they act and they
[17:59] conduct and
[18:00] and the thought process they have to be
[18:02] willing if they are going to
[18:04] uh you know be in whatever that is that
[18:07] play
[18:07] they have to be willing to do that they
[18:10] can't
[18:10] bring just their own self and expect
[18:14] that part of the drama to be granted to
[18:16] them let me just tell you
[18:18] god he's not holding tryouts but god
[18:22] in himself he draws you and i to that
[18:24] place to where that we
[18:26] can actually surrender and say lord i
[18:29] don't know how to fulfill the part
[18:33] i don't know how to fulfill this i i
[18:35] don't know how to make this live
[18:36] god said it's getting right it's getting
[18:39] right
[18:40] it's about time for them to step on
[18:42] stage why
[18:43] because you're getting to a place of
[18:45] where you know you can't
[18:46] do it in yourself you're realizing that
[18:50] my knowledge of the message
[18:52] knowing the doctrines know and do this
[18:54] and do that
[18:55] you realize that ain't going to work i
[18:57] need something that's
[18:58] deeper than that i'm tired of acting the
[19:02] part
[19:02] i need god to come and act through my
[19:06] life
[19:08] hallelujah and that invites god's
[19:12] presence
[19:15] hallelujah let me just say it like this
[19:18] everyone down through there don't worry
[19:20] i ain't gonna be real long
[19:22] but just remember this
[19:25] the bible said with elijah
[19:29] men subject to like passion such as we
[19:31] are
[19:33] he had his ups and downs
[19:37] he had days that he felt like he was on
[19:40] the mountain
[19:41] he had other days he felt like he was
[19:44] underneath
[19:45] the the the water was flowing in the
[19:47] valley
[19:48] that's the outer part of an individual
[19:52] i'm speaking because i know that i know
[19:53] all the way through this congregation
[19:54] there's one
[19:55] different different places where you're
[19:56] at but i want you to understand
[20:00] that a man the way they were men subject
[20:02] to like passion such as we are
[20:05] when god when god is assembling his cast
[20:08] remember he's already chosen
[20:09] but god has to bring him to a place of
[20:12] weakness
[20:13] you take for example let's look at a few
[20:15] characters gideon
[20:18] god says gideon right here in this role
[20:21] this is what the role says you're a
[20:23] mighty man of valor
[20:25] get in sin must be another gideon around
[20:28] here somewhere
[20:29] because he sure ain't talking to me god
[20:32] wasn't talking to that outward
[20:34] man he wasn't talking to that first
[20:36] birth are you hearing me
[20:37] because that first birth it was a coward
[20:40] but god was looking
[20:42] deeper in gideon's life
[20:45] so what would gideon have to do
[20:47] eventually get in he has to settle down
[20:49] and this is where god works on his life
[20:52] to get him
[20:53] to look beyond his complexes my family
[20:57] is the least family
[20:58] and this he's what's he doing the word
[21:00] keeps coming
[21:01] and what's the word doing the word is
[21:03] actually unfolding
[21:05] the very position in the drama and that
[21:08] word as he's receiving it
[21:11] it's dismissing complexes where he's had
[21:14] fears and he's timid the word holds the
[21:17] power within it
[21:19] to bring him in position and dismantle
[21:22] every bit of doubt
[21:26] who does that god does it
[21:30] gideon never stepped up and said i can
[21:32] do this
[21:35] but god knew what lay within him he had
[21:38] to work with gideon a lot
[21:40] you see it ain't the same let me just
[21:42] sound like this
[21:43] it ain't always the same ways
[21:46] or maybe pattern or length or whatever
[21:49] it ain't always the same
[21:50] but god knows each and every one of us
[21:53] god even knows
[21:54] even the situations and things in your
[21:57] life let me tell you something
[21:59] you realize you can look in your life
[22:00] and say you don't know the times
[22:02] that i've tried to serve god and how
[22:05] many times i've failed
[22:06] you realize that god allows you to fail
[22:10] because the course you were on was one
[22:13] of your own strength
[22:15] god allowed moses to build himself up
[22:18] in understanding in wisdom he knew about
[22:22] the deliverer
[22:23] he he believed well i'm to be that one
[22:25] but he lacked
[22:26] what was necessary in order
[22:30] for that to be fulfilled god was not
[22:33] asking
[22:33] moses to fulfill it it finally came to a
[22:36] place
[22:37] when god got moses in a place where
[22:40] moses
[22:41] looked at the roll and moses said i
[22:44] can't
[22:44] do that god said that's where i want you
[22:48] now it's ready for you you're getting
[22:50] ready now to step on the stage
[22:53] you see god is the one who brings you
[22:55] and i to a surrender
[22:57] it's not you that does it it's god
[22:59] working on your life
[23:01] it's god that deals with your life that
[23:03] brings you to that place
[23:05] god don't force nobody on stage
[23:08] sometimes you ever seen little kids
[23:11] i i don't think none of y'all look okay
[23:14] i think everybody's big
[23:15] but you're seeing a little kid they got
[23:16] a part sometimes they have an apartment
[23:18] they don't really want that part
[23:22] and they've got that part they're not
[23:23] they're not real too happy about that
[23:25] part that they've got
[23:27] but they'll go ahead and do it let me
[23:30] just say this
[23:31] when god brings us to that place and
[23:34] through that surrender
[23:36] we're happy with that part if it's no
[23:39] more
[23:40] than just to say amen
[23:44] whatever the party is we're so delighted
[23:47] that god has so dealt in our life to
[23:50] bring us
[23:51] to the place a position that he might
[23:54] perform his word through our life
[23:58] god allowed moses to fail god allows
[24:02] god allows those things you you see you
[24:04] can look and say well
[24:05] i've been raised around the message i
[24:07] i've listened i've listened to tapes all
[24:08] my life i told you the other night
[24:10] i could finish quotes i could finish
[24:12] quotes
[24:13] that when you know when when i really
[24:15] wasn't in in good good positions of mind
[24:18] from hearing them played in the car
[24:21] playing in the home
[24:22] but just hearing it didn't do it
[24:26] did i believe brother rahm was a prophet
[24:28] i did believe he was a prophet
[24:32] but that didn't do it what had to happen
[24:35] there had to be a meeting with god
[24:39] i didn't force that meeting with god
[24:42] i'm going to tell you that meeting right
[24:44] there god arranged that meeting
[24:47] [Music]
[24:47] [Applause]
[24:51] i didn't know what was going on i didn't
[24:53] know why my desires were being turned
[24:55] i didn't know why i started to look at
[24:57] things differently why i started to
[24:59] notice things in the world and say
[25:00] i can't trust this i can't trust that i
[25:03] didn't know that but it was
[25:05] god that was dealing with my heart what
[25:07] was god doing
[25:08] he was drawing me to a place of
[25:11] surrender
[25:12] like what he had to do for moses he let
[25:15] moses know
[25:16] i don't need your intellect i don't need
[25:19] your strength
[25:20] i just need to borrow your body
[25:26] i already put you in the drama you're
[25:29] already
[25:29] cast in the drama all i need is you for
[25:32] you
[25:32] to let me bring you into position
[25:37] what do i have to do just surrender i'll
[25:40] do it
[25:43] jephthah a lot of these a lot of these
[25:46] there in the scripture
[25:47] jeff doing different ones jephthah you
[25:50] look at his background
[25:51] he was a son of a harlot he didn't have
[25:53] a great pedigree
[25:55] oh he you know he couldn't look back and
[25:57] say boy i'll tell you all the way
[25:58] through everything just
[25:59] it lined right up man with the law
[26:02] everything
[26:03] know as a matter of fact there were
[26:04] things in the law that was stacked
[26:06] against him
[26:09] but god was for him you say why would
[26:11] god include that
[26:13] for you and me to let you and i see that
[26:16] god's grace
[26:17] is so rich it's unsearchable that when
[26:20] you think
[26:21] you've gone too far god says my grace
[26:24] goes further yet
[26:27] [Applause]
[26:27] [Music]
[26:28] when you would have wrote yourself out
[26:30] of the script but
[26:31] god knows it's not your nature it's not
[26:35] that real you
[26:36] on the inside
[26:39] are you hearing me you would have wrote
[26:42] yourself out of the script
[26:44] i would have wrote myself out of the
[26:45] script i'm not worthy
[26:47] i'm not worthy to be called your son i'm
[26:49] not worthy to be in this drama
[26:51] but god as though he don't even hear
[26:54] that he keeps
[26:55] dealing with our life he keeps sending
[26:57] word
[26:58] after word and ministering to us why
[27:00] he's got
[27:01] confidence that seed on the inside will
[27:04] respond to that voice
[27:07] what i have to do like mary be it unto
[27:10] me
[27:11] according to the script
[27:22] samson
[27:26] the first gold gym picture boy you know
[27:34] better
[27:36] if it would have been samson's physique
[27:38] they would have for gold's gym
[27:40] nobody would go there to pump iron
[27:45] brother brown called him a curly
[27:48] headed little shrimp
[27:52] scrawny this will help some of you boys
[27:54] out mama's boy
[27:58] hey that ain't number one ain't nothing
[28:00] wrong being a mama's boy
[28:03] you look at mama mama will help you
[28:05] decide and know what wife you should
[28:06] choose later in life
[28:09] are you with me but think of it god
[28:12] chose him
[28:13] to go and fight the philistines like he
[28:15] chose gideon
[28:17] he chose a guy who's a coward god's
[28:19] looking deeper
[28:22] what is wrote there in the script god's
[28:25] the one
[28:25] who brings forth the character
[28:29] that is wrote within that word god
[28:32] brings forth that character
[28:34] by the character of his own life
[28:40] david we looked at him on friday night
[28:43] he was a youth aren't you glad that god
[28:46] had some young people included in there
[28:49] if you really studied in the scriptures
[28:51] there you find that there's a lot of
[28:52] young people that's
[28:53] that's men that's actually mentioned
[28:57] in the in the in the field of boaz young
[28:59] men
[29:01] joshua had young men is that right there
[29:04] were young people
[29:06] that were included within that and david
[29:09] is known as
[29:10] looked upon here he is a youth he's
[29:13] ruddy i mean he david wasn't even the
[29:17] pick of the prophet
[29:19] come on now showing let me tell you what
[29:22] that means to me
[29:24] it shows that the natural eyes of man
[29:27] is not what chose you and i
[29:31] gloria because there could have been a
[29:33] lot of
[29:34] individuals that could have looked to
[29:36] you and i and said i
[29:37] don't know how i don't know if there's
[29:40] anything there
[29:41] but god said yes sir there's something
[29:44] there
[29:45] inside of their life all it takes is for
[29:49] me
[29:49] to get in contact with them and
[29:52] something starts to move and
[29:54] things start changing
[30:02] the lord jesus well there was no
[30:04] weakness in him
[30:06] but how brother branham describes it he
[30:09] was a
[30:11] spindly fella so if you're a real skinny
[30:14] guy
[30:16] he was a spindly fella but you can't put
[30:19] me out for being a chunky one spindly
[30:22] fellow
[30:23] he didn't look like a king
[30:27] sometimes you know we have images of how
[30:30] people ought to look
[30:33] paul wrote letters and when paul came
[30:34] among them they said
[30:36] this can't be the guy because the
[30:39] letters we wrote
[30:40] mighty men of god a man seven feet tall
[30:44] it wasn't the mightiness of paul
[30:47] it was the mighty god oh my
[30:51] great big things come in small
[30:54] packages
[30:55] [Applause]
[30:59] look at peter in them they never get
[31:02] invited to a spelling bee
[31:10] i don't mind you laughing because but it
[31:12] ain't trying i'm not trying to be funny
[31:13] i'm just trying to point out to you if
[31:15] you're looking at things
[31:17] that could be picked out brother brown
[31:18] tells us they couldn't even read their
[31:19] name if it was wrote out on a boxcar
[31:23] i've seen people who who've never been
[31:25] able to read and you write their name in
[31:26] from
[31:27] they don't know what it is then when you
[31:30] go to tell them this is your name right
[31:31] here
[31:32] wow this is what it looks like god chose
[31:35] men like that
[31:38] he didn't choose them because they were
[31:39] illiterate
[31:41] but god was showing that his choosing
[31:44] and the acting out of his drama he
[31:46] doesn't need somebody
[31:48] that can read the script and try to come
[31:50] into imaginary way
[31:52] god doesn't need that he doesn't even
[31:55] need
[31:56] our efforts he only needs our yielding
[32:10] and remember he said
[32:13] you've not chosen me but i've chosen you
[32:20] i'm glad about that because how many
[32:23] times
[32:24] we try to get out of the parts that god
[32:25] wants us
[32:27] god said this is what i have for you
[32:32] lord how can this be how can i do this
[32:35] how can i god that's where that's a
[32:38] place he wants us
[32:40] but it's to say lord i can't do this
[32:45] on my own i need you
[32:49] i'm not only talking about before you
[32:52] get the holy ghost
[32:53] i'm talking about after you get the holy
[32:55] ghost
[32:58] because the holy ghost isn't something
[32:59] that you put in your hand in control
[33:01] he comes and controls you
[33:04] it's him that we're surrendering to
[33:08] he directs our life he's the one that
[33:11] changes maybe ambitions and objectives
[33:14] and a lot of things that we have
[33:15] and when he comes into our life the
[33:16] desire that we have is to please him
[33:19] in such a way that when he begins to
[33:21] deal with our life
[33:22] sure there might be things that are
[33:24] disappointing to us
[33:26] things pathways that we wanted to go
[33:28] maybe career paths or
[33:29] other things like that but when he
[33:31] begins to deal with our heart and our
[33:33] heart has been changed
[33:34] brother there's a desire that means more
[33:37] to us
[33:38] than anything and that's what is my
[33:41] father's will we may have to die
[33:44] and we do have to die paul said i have
[33:47] to die
[33:50] daily
[33:54] let me just tell you something
[33:57] god when you're part
[34:02] god don't accept no
[34:06] god don't take his drama and say
[34:10] let's see now i've got to find who am i
[34:11] going to get to fill that part
[34:13] good job god don't accept no he might
[34:15] have to work with us a little bit like
[34:17] you seen
[34:18] gideon and the rest of them he came to
[34:20] our prophet
[34:21] he told him you're going to be praying
[34:23] for kings and monarchs
[34:25] you're going to take a message that's
[34:26] going to going to announce
[34:28] and forerun the second coming of the
[34:30] lord what did
[34:31] what did brother graham say i told him i
[34:34] would not
[34:35] be able to do it
[34:42] then he told me brother braham goes on
[34:43] to it he began to tell me
[34:45] of the signs that would be given to me
[34:47] he began to unfold what did brother
[34:49] brahm say
[34:50] he begins to unfold the places in the
[34:52] word questions that brother brahm had
[34:54] god don't mind questions
[34:57] with the right motive god don't mind
[34:59] questions
[35:01] god god will take those questions that
[35:03] you've got on your heart
[35:04] and god will answer them those questions
[35:07] that arise in your heart is an
[35:09] opportunity
[35:10] for god to unfold himself to you
[35:16] and god began to unfold the word to
[35:19] brother branham
[35:19] this is this place in the scripture this
[35:21] is where this is being fulfilled
[35:23] this is where this has taken place god
[35:26] has so placed it house as he would say
[35:30] in his word
[35:31] we have this treasure in
[35:34] earthen vessels i know now they've got a
[35:38] lot of different
[35:39] flower pots but do any remember them
[35:42] clay flower pots
[35:44] that they would have i mean they look uh
[35:46] well they look a
[35:47] clay color like a reddish color you know
[35:50] man i remember my mom used to have those
[35:52] things
[35:52] you didn't knock them over you knocked
[35:55] them over they broke
[35:57] they are fragile that's how our lives
[36:01] are like earth and vessel it's very
[36:04] fragile
[36:07] but we have this treasure in earth and
[36:10] vessels
[36:12] it's not the earth and vessel that's the
[36:13] treasure it's what it is
[36:16] housing on the inside
[36:19] that the not the excellency of the power
[36:22] of god
[36:23] it might be of god and not of us
[36:27] so they became empty vessels by yielding
[36:30] to the lord how many know that that
[36:33] where the where the scripture said
[36:35] not by might not by power but by my
[36:38] spirit
[36:39] saith the lord how that he
[36:42] would reveal himself in the book of
[36:44] revelations walking
[36:46] in the midst of the church he would
[36:49] reveal himself
[36:50] as the one who is declaring the victory
[36:54] in the midst of his brother you see what
[36:56] this is saying
[36:57] god's not interested in just being
[37:00] somebody who's close
[37:01] by he wants to be in the
[37:05] midst of your life he wants to be the
[37:08] strength of your life he wants to be the
[37:11] one who is
[37:12] living and acting his word right through
[37:15] your life
[37:16] this is why after all was said and done
[37:20] and after the resurrection of the lord
[37:22] jesus that word began to gather
[37:24] the disciples with a purpose to let them
[37:28] know that because what they had been
[37:29] doing
[37:30] they were looking at the lord jesus they
[37:32] were walking with them
[37:33] it was necessary they observed that
[37:35] ministry
[37:36] it was necessary that they would catch
[37:39] many of the things that were happening
[37:40] but there were some things they didn't
[37:42] catch because it wasn't time yet
[37:44] but when he got up on that easter
[37:46] morning he
[37:47] never forgot about the cast
[37:51] that was part of that drama there were
[37:53] already
[37:54] witnesses that were chosen that he would
[37:57] reveal himself to
[37:58] and you know what that word coming on
[38:00] display did it made an announcement
[38:02] there
[38:03] that your time is now on it's time for
[38:06] you to step
[38:07] on the stage and that's what the holy
[38:09] spirit what he not only did through the
[38:12] ministry
[38:12] of the prophet in this hour but that
[38:15] same living god
[38:16] as he comes right down into your life
[38:18] he's assembling
[38:20] the cast members that was in his mind
[38:23] before the foundation of the world
[38:25] what's he assembling us to
[38:27] he's assembling us to the promise that
[38:29] he would pour
[38:31] out himself he would pour out the holy
[38:34] ghost
[38:34] which is the strength
[38:38] of our lives
[38:43] now the scripture says it like this can
[38:46] i have just a few more moments
[38:50] you i know you're probably familiar with
[38:51] this remember
[38:53] now the creator in the days of thy youth
[38:57] lest the evil days come not
[39:01] you know what evil days are let me see
[39:04] here
[39:04] anybody how can i cover myself anybody
[39:07] 45 years and over just cover your ears
[39:11] it's when you get older the evil days
[39:14] when you
[39:14] you've been doing a little bit of
[39:15] working oh man oh i feel that
[39:18] but i got to get some ointment on
[39:20] where's the advil
[39:23] those are evil days you start feeling
[39:26] the effects of those things but notice
[39:28] what it says remember thy creator in the
[39:30] days of thy youth
[39:31] in lamentations 3 7 it's good for a man
[39:34] that he
[39:35] bear the yoke in his youth
[39:38] you know in your youth you've got a lot
[39:40] of strength and stamina
[39:44] you do you've got a lot of strength god
[39:47] wants
[39:48] to use your strength there's a lot of
[39:51] things to be done
[39:52] in this final stretch of the race
[39:56] god wants to use your strength your
[39:58] vigor where
[39:59] some of us that are older we get a
[40:00] little tired after a little bit and our
[40:02] words get crossed up
[40:03] but god looks in and says here i need
[40:05] your strength i want that
[40:07] youthfulness i want that energy but god
[40:09] doesn't want us
[40:10] taking our energy and trying to do it
[40:15] he wants it yielded
[40:19] he won't take nothing from you he won't
[40:21] demand it
[40:23] he wants you to surrender it the bible
[40:26] says in isaiah 40. let me refer to this
[40:28] isaiah 40 29
[40:29] he giveth power to the faint and to them
[40:33] that have no might
[40:35] he increaseth strength
[40:38] even the youth shall
[40:41] faint and be weary and the young men
[40:46] shall utterly fall
[40:50] isaiah by the spirit of god is pointing
[40:52] it out
[40:53] that just mere strength alone
[40:56] in youthfulness is not going to be able
[41:00] to get the job done you'll grow theory
[41:03] and you grow
[41:04] faint and weary why because you're not
[41:06] fighting against flesh and blood
[41:09] you can't overcome these devils with
[41:11] knowledge
[41:12] you've got to have a great big god on
[41:15] the inside
[41:16] you've got to have a strength and
[41:18] brother what is that strength
[41:20] where the inside desire has been changed
[41:23] and the devil can do whatever he wants
[41:25] to do but your
[41:27] appetites have been changed
[41:31] your desires are different that's the
[41:34] work of almighty god
[41:36] that's when like the song brother paul
[41:38] wrote there when it drops from the head
[41:41] down to the heart it's no longer you
[41:45] acting it out but once it gets down here
[41:48] it's where
[41:48] god has put on the vesture and it's god
[41:52] acting out his word
[41:55] through your life even your
[41:58] peculiarities
[42:00] god has made you that way
[42:07] so even the youth so strength alone
[42:10] won't do it
[42:11] they'll utterly fail but they that have
[42:15] wait on the lord
[42:16] shall renew their strength and they
[42:18] shall mount up with wings
[42:19] as an eagle they shall run and not be
[42:23] weary and they shall walk
[42:24] and not faint to wait
[42:28] is to be yielded
[42:32] to god
[42:37] god asked you and i to separate
[42:40] ourselves
[42:42] from the world
[42:45] god don't come down and do that for us
[42:48] he asks you and i to do that
[42:50] how do we separate ourselves paul said
[42:52] purge ourselves from other vessels in
[42:54] the house
[42:55] how do we do that by his word
[42:58] if god had not given a word in this hour
[43:02] we would be just like the rest mixing in
[43:05] with everything else
[43:06] but in that word it holds a call
[43:09] it holds a mystery it holds the
[43:12] unfolding
[43:12] of who you are it's calling you in
[43:15] position and god don't ask you to figure
[43:17] it out
[43:18] god don't ask you to say i want you to
[43:20] study this script over and i want you to
[43:22] memorize the lines
[43:23] i want you to have this gods and god god
[43:25] doesn't have sunday school charts
[43:27] with golden stickers on it god's not
[43:29] asking that you and i
[43:30] memorize it all god wants us to do is
[43:33] yield ourself to him
[43:35] invite him in that he can come and
[43:38] perform his word
[43:43] we looked at that even with moses and
[43:45] seeing that with how god allowed moses
[43:47] to get to that place
[43:48] the bible would write to the right right
[43:50] in the book of john i think brother ron
[43:52] read this scripture i don't know if it's
[43:54] morning or last night
[43:56] but he wrote how remember how john wrote
[43:58] to the young men
[43:59] it was young people in general he would
[44:01] say you've overcome the wicked one
[44:04] i write to your little children because
[44:05] you've known the father i've written
[44:07] unto your fathers because you've known
[44:08] him that is from the beginning
[44:10] i've written unto you young men because
[44:12] you are strong
[44:13] and the word of god abideth in you and
[44:16] you have overcome
[44:17] the wicked one what's he dealing with
[44:20] he's talking about not their
[44:22] earthly or their physical strength
[44:26] their strength is the word of god
[44:29] abiding in them
[44:32] that's their strength to where it's not
[44:35] it's not a letter it's not what i know
[44:40] but it's the reality of that word
[44:43] of the person of jesus christ himself
[44:47] where in your life you know there's been
[44:50] a passing from death unto life
[44:54] you say how do how do i know that
[44:57] look at what your life produces
[45:01] what is the very desires of your life
[45:03] remember what brother brown tells us in
[45:04] desperation
[45:05] he said people say i've seen a lie i've
[45:07] seen this i've seen that he said that's
[45:09] all fine and good
[45:10] but what is your life after all of that
[45:15] is that right he said god comes down in
[45:18] other places
[45:19] and he says god will come down and he
[45:21] whispers in your heart
[45:23] it's finished and when god whispers that
[45:26] in your heart
[45:27] it's finished it's done it's over
[45:30] brother there's been a transformation
[45:33] that takes place in the depths of your
[45:35] life
[45:36] the desire of sin has ceased
[45:40] sure you can be tempted but there's a
[45:43] resistance on the inside
[45:46] you've got a strength there's already
[45:48] been an overcomer
[45:49] on the inside that's moved in there
[45:51] might be snags and traps along the way
[45:54] but you're not a piece of driftwood
[45:57] floating down the stream
[45:58] you've been brought into the ark of the
[46:00] lord you've got a
[46:02] power behind you that when things would
[46:04] come about
[46:05] when discouragement comes your way
[46:07] you've got a strength
[46:09] that's behind you what is that that
[46:11] ain't human power
[46:12] that's the power of the holy ghost
[46:19] hallelujah
[46:24] god will have to allow jacob
[46:27] to get to that place
[46:30] jacob had met god but jacob didn't
[46:33] he he wasn't changed at that first time
[46:36] in bethel
[46:39] but he did he he told god when i
[46:43] returned
[46:46] he got to that place at night what he'd
[46:47] been running from and
[46:51] that night he was left alone
[46:54] and there god came
[46:58] and he wrestled with god
[47:03] jacob had a lot of strength now let me
[47:05] just say this
[47:07] jacob had grown tired of being jacob
[47:11] he got to a spot he said i'm tired of
[47:14] being jacob
[47:16] i'm tired of this
[47:19] and god's saying yes
[47:22] yes he's realizing he's tired of being
[47:26] jacob
[47:27] so at that time god shows up
[47:31] like you heard the lord speaking through
[47:32] brother ron it was an arranged
[47:35] moment that night
[47:40] and in that moment of wrestling when
[47:42] finally
[47:43] jacob himself he had no more strength
[47:47] it was in that time he was asking for
[47:49] what is your name that when god
[47:53] asked him what's your name are you
[47:55] hearing me
[47:56] god asked him what's your name he
[47:59] identifies
[48:01] i'm jacob he wasn't trying to make
[48:03] excuses for it
[48:04] i'm the deceiver i'm a supplanter and
[48:07] i'm sick of it and god said
[48:09] now's the time that i can step on the
[48:12] scene
[48:13] i've got a part in this cast that's got
[48:16] to be fulfilled and god said you're
[48:18] right
[48:18] in the right place that's repentance
[48:21] recognizing that i'm jacob
[48:24] and god said you shall no longer
[48:27] be called jacob but now thou
[48:30] shalt be called israel for as a prince
[48:34] you've got power with god
[48:39] a moment of weakness
[48:42] he wasn't standing on excuses lord i've
[48:44] tried
[48:45] i've tried lord i just can't do it i
[48:48] don't have the stamina
[48:49] he's still not ready but when he finally
[48:51] came to a time
[48:52] i'm jacob god said that's the time
[48:57] this is what i've been waiting on and it
[48:59] wasn't like god was just waiting around
[49:00] like well i wish you'd hurry up
[49:02] everything was in his time
[49:07] god brings his children to a place
[49:10] to where they recognize the only place
[49:14] they can stand is on the word of god
[49:16] that's where faith comes in through
[49:19] faith they subdued kingdoms
[49:21] through faith righteousness
[49:26] through faith it was not because
[49:30] they were some great people
[49:34] within themselves no
[49:38] it was because they came to a place
[49:43] of yielding to god
[49:46] that god could step inside of them
[49:50] and you know that's that's what god's
[49:52] desire is that that's what the new birth
[49:54] is
[49:55] it's you coming to a place to say i'm
[49:58] jacob i'm jacob
[50:01] lord i need delivered lord
[50:04] i need set free maybe you've already
[50:08] come to that place
[50:10] but in your life right now maybe there's
[50:12] things that
[50:14] making some choices on your own and
[50:16] you're just kind of looking at things
[50:18] and saying
[50:18] well you know i think i can do this or i
[50:20] think i'm going to do that i'm not
[50:21] talking about sin
[50:23] i'm not i'm speaking about now or you
[50:25] start realizing
[50:26] and you start looking at it and say wait
[50:28] a minute here
[50:30] there was a surrender in my life and god
[50:33] took control of my life
[50:35] that don't stop the surrender
[50:38] when the lamb of god was sought out by
[50:41] the spirit of god
[50:42] and he was brought to the river jordan
[50:44] in perfect obedience
[50:46] right at the right time he was baptized
[50:49] by the prophet john not because he was a
[50:52] sinner he had to be washed
[50:54] as the sacrifice as even as that of the
[50:56] priest
[50:57] is that right and here he comes into
[51:00] that place
[51:00] and john says oh no no no no no far be
[51:04] it
[51:04] no no i need to be baptized to you but
[51:07] jesus standing on the word said
[51:08] it becometh us to fulfill
[51:12] all righteousness
[51:15] and following in obedience to the word
[51:19] oh my brother and sister this is one
[51:22] thing
[51:22] young people you could never get around
[51:24] obedience to the word
[51:26] the holy ghost does not come upon
[51:29] disobedience
[51:31] he giveth the holy ghost to them that
[51:34] obey him
[51:36] you might even have things on your
[51:37] phones right now you might have things
[51:39] in your bedroom
[51:40] that you say i wouldn't want nobody to
[51:42] know about but
[51:43] god's talking about an obedience down
[51:46] here when he gets that lined up
[51:48] your phone will change your bedroom will
[51:51] change
[51:51] those things will take care of itself
[51:54] why because there's a new man
[51:56] on the inside and that man that's in
[51:58] there says
[51:59] i don't like those things we don't do
[52:02] those things
[52:03] why you've got a new man inside this
[52:06] temple
[52:08] let's stand
[52:09] [Applause]
[52:11] god's cast that he's drawn to himself
[52:16] god's assembled you in this hour
[52:20] we're not here by chance we're not here
[52:22] by chance
[52:23] in this moment and in this time we're
[52:25] not here by chance in this service
[52:27] tonight
[52:27] we've heard that here this weekend and
[52:30] you we have heard that
[52:31] throughout we've we've heard that we
[52:32] believe that but this is a reality this
[52:35] is a moment
[52:36] right now remember god is god does not
[52:39] take no
[52:40] for an answer you belong within that
[52:44] caste
[52:45] ordained to be in that position god
[52:47] deals and he works on your heart
[52:50] he might have to work on your heart like
[52:51] he did gideon where he dealt with
[52:53] getting with the sacrifice in the rock
[52:55] then and then it was right after that
[52:57] tearing down the altar
[52:59] then it was you know the the the piece
[53:01] of sheepskin
[53:02] do on it the next night do all around
[53:04] and knit dry
[53:05] but you know what god is going to prove
[53:08] himself and his desire is is to get you
[53:12] to believe him if you can believe
[53:16] what he saith unto thee
[53:20] that's all god wants you go to believe
[53:23] in that and you start saying
[53:25] yes lord yes lord
[53:28] a pulsation starts yes lord yes
[53:31] lord beyond your thoughts remember how
[53:33] the holy spirit spoke here this morning
[53:35] think beyond your thoughts look beyond
[53:38] what you see
[53:39] i'm telling you to see yourself don't
[53:41] look at yourself as a devil
[53:43] can point you put you down like oh
[53:45] you're nothing you know you're too young
[53:47] or you're just trotted out you've made
[53:48] too many mistakes in your past
[53:50] i want you to look there through that
[53:52] blood
[53:53] and see a real son and daughter of god
[53:56] and know that that's where you're
[53:57] standing
[53:58] and know that god's desire is for you to
[54:00] be placed
[54:01] right there god didn't choose you
[54:05] because
[54:05] you'd be mistake free and you'd come in
[54:08] this way he know
[54:09] what that seed laying on the inside and
[54:12] all it takes
[54:13] is in his presence
[54:17] where our life says yes
[54:20] lord be it unto me
[54:24] and god steps down and here we are
[54:27] brother paul can you come help me for a
[54:28] moment

[55:11] other one

[55:18] there

[55:27] surrender

[55:31] willing to die out to yourself
[55:34] say i had enough and even if you you've
