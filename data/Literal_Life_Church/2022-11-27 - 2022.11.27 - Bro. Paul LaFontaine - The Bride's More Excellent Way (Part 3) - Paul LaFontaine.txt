TRANSCRIPT
========================================
rest in every situation of life that it it that it would be projected and when Divine love is not just in your heart say well I love everybody and I love the Lord but it's when Divine love is projected Sovereign Grace takes over and and I want to be a vessel this is my desire through this I want to be a vessel that eventually the only response that comes out of this vessel my lips my mind everything and my reaction to anybody my only reaction is is saturated with the Lord's Divine love there's no other response that comes out of this vessel that's my desire and so we'll go back into it this morning and we we are looking forward to What the Lord Has for us we're not under expectation for another big healing or national Revival Revival but we do look for a final glorious victory in Divine love can you say amen and this is the more excellent way I'm not going to read the scripture but this series comes from the more excellent way that Paul said as he was talking about the gifts and correcting the gifts and all the wonderful things that's in the church the nine spiritual gifts and in his in the midst of correcting all of it he has First Corinthians 13 was it's a unique chapter in the middle of all the the gifts and things being displayed in the Corinthian Church he said covet the best gifts and you know the scriptures so I'm just quoting it to you covered earnestly the best gifts and yet I show unto you a more excellent way and I believe that excellent way is the bride's Victory I believe we're to come to it Genesis 26 and verse 1 and there was a famine in the land beside this the first famine that was in the days of Abraham and Isaac went unto abimelech King of the Philistines into career and the Lord appeared unto him and said go down go not down into Egypt dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of sojourn in this land and I will be with thee and will bless thee For unto thee and unto thy seed I will give all these countries and I will perform the oath which which I swear unto Abraham thy father and I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thee thy seed all these countries and in thy seeds shall all the nations of the earth be blessed this is the same blessing that came on his father Abraham and now God revisits him because how many know that the blessings of Our Father Abraham falls on all his seed after him are ye Abraham seed this morning so when God visited us through the message of the hour through his Prophet he's reiterating the same thing that he's saying to Isaac the same blessing that come for it Abraham is coming on you and he's echoing it again to him verse 4 or verse 5 because that Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge and my Commandments my statues my laws and Isaac dwelt in Greer and the men of the place asked him of his wife and he said she is my sister for he feared to say she is my wife lest said he the men of the place should kill me for Rebecca because she was a she was fair to look upon and came to pass when he had been there a long time that benaught king of Philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold Isaac was sporting with Rebecca his wife and abimelech called Isaac and said behold of a surety she is thy wife and how sayest thou she is my sister and Isaac said in him because I said lest I die for her and abimelech said what is this thou has done unto us one of the people might lightly have lion with thy wife and thou shouldest have brought guilty guilt guiltiness upon us and abimelech charged all his people saying he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death then Isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year a hundredfold and the Lord blessed him so I want you to notice now an elected Abraham seed coming but he has to go because of the famine down into Greer and these other places that are that will become difficult places because you're going to run into jealousy and you're going to run into trouble and you're going to run into problems and you're you're going to be run into reactions of people because you're not in your own land you're having to go into places like you have to go into places of life that are not going to be the best response even though you're the Blessed of God so this is a type now in Isaac's life it's a type of the Bride now because we are certainly not in our homeland right now spiritually we are but we're not in our homeland yet so we're living in every day in Satan's Eden we're living in a career we're living in a a place where you're not going to be accepted and there's going to be all kinds of situations happen in your life just simply because you're blessed and you're the promised of God and when you get into those situations you're going to have reactions from people what I want you to notice in this is Isaac's reaction to all of it because we can't change what the world treats us like what our trials treat us like but we can change or God can change how we react to all of it and in type Isaac is the love type of God he's the love and that's why I'm reading him because brother Brown says Abraham was Faith Isaac was love Jacob was Grace and Joseph was Perfection and so now in the love look at his response verse 13 and the man whacks great and went forward and grew until he became very great so Isaac was being blessed in these situations no matter what he was prospering I may believe you can prosper spiritually in any situation for he had possessions of flocks and possession of herds and great storm servants and the Philistines envied him okay there's the jealousy the Envy for all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father in the Philistines had stopped them and filled them with her and abimelech said unto Isaac go from us for thou art much mightier than we so he just sends him away sends Isaac away and Isaac notice now no response he said look what I'm doing here I I'm I'm prospering here if they had to pay taxes then it's like you could say sometimes I want to say to townships and different ones you know we pay taxes here and you're making us feel unwelcome and he could have responded but Isaac didn't respond to any of it you know what he just polite he said all right I'll move on to another piece of land here and Isaac departed this and pitched his tint in the valley of Greer and dwelt there and Isaac did begin the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father noticed these are his possession that's it's Abraham he dug these well for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them and Isaac's service digged in the valley and found their well-springing water so now once he starts digging these old Wells out then he starts to find water none of these guys could find that so he's blessed in fine water you can imagine how the jealousy just keeps Rising my goodness look what he's doing they become jealous and envious and start to turn against them even more Isaac's servants digged in the valley and found there as well springing and the Herdman of Greer did strive with Isaac's Herdman saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well esek because they strove with them and that means that they want to defuss they wanted to Stew they wanted to argue they wanted to have Strife they wanted to get mad they they were jealous and they wanted to cause arguments you know Thanksgiving can be a good time but it can be a bad time with family members sometimes when everybody wants to just form arguments there's people that feel like they're called in life to fuss and stew and strive and Uncle so and so is always trying to stir up something can't stop that got to invite Uncle so and so but we can pray and say Lord help our responses and they digged another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitna and he removed from thence and digged another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it rehabath and he said for now the Lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land and he went up from thence to Beersheba and the Lord appeared unto him the same night and said is the Lord appearing to him again I am the god of Abraham thy father fear not for I am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake I know I'm taking a while here but I'm getting this now I'm preaching on this now so I won't have to come back to it but I want you to notice in the midst of a trial in the midst of people wanting to argue people want to fuss Express every other thing but love Isaac expresses it and right in the middle of that God Appears to him again and encourages them in I'm with you doesn't God do that with you sometimes if we're faithful to say Lord I want to walk with you and and give the right response back to people and give Divine love back to people when they're fussing and acting a certain way and treat them with respect the lord loves that and the Lord comes on the scene to Isaac said Don't Fear I am with thee I Will Bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham say and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord and pitched his tent there and there Isaac service dig the well then abimelech went to him from Greer and has us one of his friends and file and the chief captain of his army and Isaac said unto them wherever Come Ye to me coming back again to fuss with them seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you you're the one that sent me away you're the one that's expressing hatred here why are you coming out to me again and that's the way spirits will do in your life they're going to keep coming after you you've expressed love they're going to keep coming and keep coming and agitating and wanting to fuss with you can you say Amen Isaac's response was only one response because he expressed the mystery of divine love and that is that no matter what they do I'm going to stay in my calling God's chosen me I if they asked me to move I'll move over here and do my work diligently for the Lord and his promise I'm going to live in his promise and whatever I do I don't want to react and be like them and I'll get in some scriptures today that show us Paul said in the New Testament is that when we as Christians begin to react and act like the world and our responses we're in we're in a bad place because we are not called to react like they react we're not called to blow off in our anger can you say Amen as uh Wesley's song said he takes away if you let him he'll take away all that take away your anger take away your bitterness that's what we want we want God to take it away and our response cannot be like the world our response must be the love of Christ that's within us can you say Amen father bless the word today I pray you'll help us and strengthen us anoint us Lord as we look to it and may every person here listening and streaming in different places Lord even if we don't know them even if they're an unbeliever whoever is listening I'm praying that your anointing would get behind our words today and that you would call that heart closer to you father you have a calling for them you have something for them maybe they just don't know it yet I pray the anointing of God would reach out and get a hold of their hearts we commit the service to you in this day to you in the name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen amen you may be seated I'd like to open this morning with the fact that all of us know that well not everybody might know but most of us Believers here know that God has been building a masterpiece God throughout history of the Old Testament was actually building towards something and when he came to his final Masterpiece it's kind of like a sculptor he takes many many years and a sculptor would take and God was taking through the Old Testament many many years until he got to his final Masterpiece in Jesus Christ I like to say it this way in the Old Testament God was trying to say something unless you have spiritual discernment it's hard to read the Old Testament but when you have Revelation the whole entire book of books of all the Old Testament God is trying to say something and he was trying to say something he's trying to say something in types and shadows and lives but then when Jesus came on the scene Jesus was what God was trying to say Jesus was the Masterpiece that God was building all through the Old Testament can you say amen and he come to his final Masterpiece and this would and think about what he was building a man like us he was virgin board but he was a man like us God came down and became us and God actually put his fullness within that man that God could express himself on Earth and see what God would look like on the face of the Earth that's was God's mystery is they would come down and express himself to man so that was God's Christ was God's Masterpiece all the character of God all the love of God all everything that was God he poured into that physical vessel and it was expressed to the world so everything was a build up in the Old Testament to get to that final Masterpiece but God's work did not stop there just like God did not stop his work in the Garden of Eden when he stopped with Adam he didn't stop with Adam there was another mystery that was there was another Masterpiece to be formed not just Adam how many knows he didn't stop it Adam there was an eve that was to become a masterpiece too and she was part of the whole mystery of God and so just like he did he took Eve out of Adam now when he finishes with Jesus Christ two thousand years ago as his Masterpiece not his final Masterpiece but his Masterpiece now he takes out of the side of Jesus Christ you wonder why the the there's the types and shadows and things that we can look at but he takes that spear that Roman surgery and he puts it up in into Christ into his side and blood and water comes out of Christ and spirit comes out of him and we know he gives up the ghost he raises on the third day but then something happened his Spirit did not just go up into heaven his Spirit came back on a group of people what was God doing God was bringing Eve out of Adam God was beginning to form a woman of many membered bride just like he did taking Eve out of Adam now he was going to form a many member body that would be the next Masterpiece can you say man and these would not be virgin born these would be sin born people that have such a new birth in their life they would be transformed by the power of God and they have the potential now to become Sons and Daughters of God and express the Masterpiece of God to this world oh I just explained to you God's full mystery can you say Amen that God did not stop with Jesus Christ but he wanted to have a bride and now here we are two thousand years after that and I can tell you God is culminating this statue this this image this masterpiece and he's doing it not in a building like this not in fineries of churches but he's doing it in people praise the Lord he's doing it in a people he's going to have a bride Ephesians he'll have a spotless bride without wrinkle without blemish Washed by the Water of his word we're coming to the final climax of a people that are the full expression of the image of God praise the Lord that might not be shout and material this morning but it should be we should say praise the Lord if you've got a heart to listen to the word today you can say I'm a part of that work I'm a part of that forming but you see there's one thing about a sculptor and I didn't have much time to look it up you can look it up you know you can go and find sculptors and how long they take and all their work and I didn't realize till last night there's I didn't didn't bring it with me but there's several stages that a sculptor that's like Michelangelo or someone like that when they're going to do a statue there's several stages that they go through and you can read those stages there's many stages they go through to get to the final product can you say man there's many different facets and phases and things that they do and so you can learn things from that because we realize God is our great Michelangelo God is our great architect God's our great sculptor can you say amen and he over time forms this Great Masterpiece and he does it to his certain way but it's just like a natural sculptor we can learn so much about God in our lives and somebody one of our missers ought to preach a sermon and just take all the stages of a sculptor but we can assume some things about a sculptor that we know if it's a really great statue like Michelangelo did some we know that it takes years to do it it doesn't take a week it doesn't take a month it doesn't take a year I was in the Vatican and scene of my some of Michael I was I was I seen a bunch of stuff that you've done and I guarantee you there are countless years that the sculpture took of working on it and working on it and working on it until he got to something you know what he got to he had a vision already in his mind what that was supposed to look at and and it looked like and he kept working on it and chiseling it and working on it until finally someday the vision that was already in his heart finally one day after years he sees the vision right in front of him in a statue I'm telling your friends the same God is working in our lives can you say amen and it may take years but if you'll submit to him he'll keep chiseling he'll keep working because why our God has a vision in his mind can you say Amen of what we're supposed to come to I just want to tell you this morning if you're listening wherever you're listening why don't you give up and let God work through me as a pastor and these ministers and the five full ministry and the prophet of the hour through the message why don't you quit haven't you had enough years where this world has formed you into dirt trash in jail divorce haven't you had enough of drugs and abuse and torn up families haven't you had enough of this Satan's Eden and Satan forming your life into addictions and depression and all kinds of things and sin and dirtiness and pornography haven't you had enough of Satan forming you why don't you give up and let the Great sculpture take over your life why don't you come to this church and come to another Bible believing church and listen to God and listen to what God's speaking through the ministry let him start reforming your life why don't you just sit still a while become a one service and that's it you know you you really want to go back to what's been forming you in your life why don't you sit still a while and let the Sculptor begin to form your life into something different one of the things the prophet said he said you can't if you can just get the bride to sit still long enough it isn't this super Supernatural thing just to get them to sit still and let God do the work over time can I get any help this morning maybe that's such a supernatural thing is you can't get people to sit still and be consistent with the word of God and let this word do its sculpting work the bride needs to just sit still and let God do the work people can't sit still alone people can't even sit for an hour and listen to the word we have a national problem and it's it's add and we have ADD we have a lot of children add we have medicines for it but we have spiritual add the attention span the attention span for people listening to the word of God is almost nothing but oh you can watch a movie for two hours oh you could be on the internet for three hours and we're like well what happened to the time oh you can go here and you can go there and you can listen to this and you give your full attention to what the Kardashians are doing Keeping Up with the Kardashians and people will not give a half hour to open up their Bible an hour to pray can you say Amen to listen to the word to come be faithful and bring their family to church to sit still you know you expect a two or three or four year old to wiggle in church you know they don't know what's going on all they see is a guy up here yelling at him and you know I try to keep their attention that way but it doesn't work you can understand a three or four year old or sometimes a 10 year old they're wiggling I'm ready to go but it's a problem of this generation they can't sit still and just listen to the word of God and let it see it's not just a sermon I'm preaching the Holy Spirit could get a hold of me and say something that could transform your life and if you're not listening it's sitting still and you can't take out of the week you know it's amazing to me that they people can't take one day Sunday and take off of work and take off everything else and give one's one day undistracted only to the Lord and only to Fellowship I still don't understand that Hobby Lobby can do it and they're blessed Chick-fil-A can do it and they're blessed and I always thought my first thought is I get mad because I head to Chick-fil-A on Sunday and forget they're closed and my first thing is I get upset and then I get happy because I realize somebody's applying a principle of God there needs to be a day that we set aside for just sitting still and resting if your boss tells you you have to you don't have a choice but in most cases we have a choice oh that's another sermon and I better stick with this one here but it's irritating people can't sit still long enough so I got to get move it along here but you see now uh when you have a sculptor number one we can assume it takes years how many would say Amen it takes years it takes many types of tools there's big tools that take big chunks there's little tools fine tools we consume it goes through many stages of cutting chunks are taken off and little carvings and then just little areas which something you feel like who've been in the way of the Lord a little while is what I felt like the last uh two or three weeks here maybe a month God dealing with things in my life very very secret things and he just takes that little chisel and the thing he thought you're pretty good you're doing pretty good in your Christian walking then the Lord just says but but what about this I'm going to just shave that off because oh Lord help me please and I've been down a little bit but at the same time I've learned let God do it let him dig it out let him carve that little thing because if it brings me closer to my goal a Divine love coming from this vessel I'll take the carving just that little it might feel like your pastor's like that I'm just got that little tool I'm just I'm just digging right in that little spot but I love you I really do it's not me it's the Lord that loves you you think I know everything I don't know everything God knows everything though and if people come and counsel stuff that's wonderful but most times if we just pray and let the Lord deal with us he'll speak things across the pulpit you get well that man didn't know about that and he gets right down in those little areas and exposes it say now I got I got to cut that off because it doesn't match the vision of what you're supposed to be God's got a vision of what you're supposed to be and you ain't there yet you think you're there and you're not there yet but we're on our road he's still working on me to make me what I ought to be it took him just a week to make the moon in Stars the Earth and the Sun Jupiter and Mars how loving and patient he must be he's still working on me amen uh there's another thing here that the sculptor does he's got that vision and he'll know when he sees it and he keeps working and shaving off what's needed to get to that Vision that's our life and if we would learn to stand still then God can do his work can you say Amen so when God was doing this he brother Brian says he made a foundation for that Masterpiece and I'm just going to mention this again he formed he formed his people by the word of a prophet I have formed you by the words of a prophet so people get afraid of prophets but you see now God's way of the sculpture forming the people into what they need to be is through the word of a prophet God anoints the man's vocal cords speaks his word and he says I have formed you I have shaped you by the prophets that's God's way that's his tool can you say amen and then he talks about a foundation um in the shadows and types so we can see now that this is not built upon uh getting people better by psychology God doesn't do it by psychology God does it by His prophets the word of His prophets and then he mentions also the the Patriots excuse me the Patriarchs and the apostles um Ephesians 2 19 says therefore we are no longer More Strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself so if we're if there's a foundation and he's going to build a statue he's going to build your life into the image of God there has to be a foundation and the foundation is the apostles Prophets The Patriarchs Jesus as Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together growth into a holy Temple on the Lord in whom ye also are building together for a habitation of God through the spirit Patriarchs prophets and he says Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph was the foundation for this masterpiece Abraham was Faith Isaac was love Jacob was faith and Joseph was Perfection we have to have whatever was in those men in their lives being expressed is the mystery of the Masterpiece Foundation He is building in the bride of Christ that's why we need it all all the elements must be there for a complete Foundation it's not just that we preached Faith like Abraham had it's not just that we preach Grace Like Jacob had it's not just that we preach Perfection but we preach love because that's part of the foundation can you say Amen that's why I get specific about the love part because it's part of the foundation he's building you into something and these foundations of faith if we heard Faith all the time then we'd be lacking in other areas there are some ministers we bring through here they are Faith ministers they build Faith they tell testimonies they build our faith that we can reach out as a son of Abraham and believe that all things are possible thank God we have a great ministers doing that we have brothers that preach the grace of God like I've never heard the grace of God we need that can you say Amen then we look at the Perfection Joseph was Perfection Christ and we pray preached that perfect place that the bride would come to through the grace of God but then you see now love is a part of it and in the mystery of Isaac is this mystery of love that's what the prophet said there's a part there I want you to go back and read it when you go home read Isaac's life and I'm I'm summing up right now to get to my teaching but look at Isaac's life as he comes into career and comes into situations that we come into and he comes into reactions from people that is so worldly his response is divine love his response is just not a worldly response not to Divine not to brag but to be patient and just serve the Lord and to stay in tune with his position and to reach out to God and and just to stay there and and and to respond however you're treated I know I'm a son of Abraham I know this land is mine I know these these fountains and these these Wells are mine I know they were my father Abraham's but I'm not going to fight someone else I'm not gonna fuss with somebody else I know my calling I'm going to go on but I'm not going to get into squabbles I'm not going to get in the ring with people even at church people want to draw you in the ring and have a fight and box don't be drawn in the ring with people hey I'm not getting in the ring with you people haven't battled marriages having battles I I'm the guy that's supposed to help you but don't draw me in the battle with you I'm looking for a victory not a battle we battle we fight we fuss we're in intentions but we've got to go beyond that and live beyond that say I'm not getting in the ring with people I'm not going to fuss with people there's a greater power working in my life I'm not better than anybody else but there's something working me deeper and I want that to be my answer I don't have to defend people I don't have to defend myself I don't have to constantly be fussing to try to defend myself let God speak for me is anybody learning something this morning if you're dealing with people you're dealing with family members church members whatever it else you have come through years that people did not act right and you got in the ring with them and you fussed and maybe years of bitterness was between you so we've had that we don't want any more of it in this message let the fussing stop in this message let the favorite preacher stop in this message let Divine love have its victory in our lives let's stop with all who has the biggest church let's stop with who all is the biggest Ministry let's let's stop with this carnality can you say Amen let's let the Victory and divine love take over our lives that God can get the glory in the Final End this will bring their tremendous victory in Divine love so now as we look at these things I want to bring us back into the channel of my PowerPoint here and talking about the different attributes of divine love this made me get very basic like it did a few weeks ago and we were dealing we dealt with out of 15 attributes of divine love in First Corinthians we dealt with the first three attributes of divine love and hopefully you have all three of those down pat so we can move on to the other 12. what are you laughing at because that was enough in itself love is patient Divine love is kind Divine love is not jealous really no there's no jealousy in it so the first three hopefully you got them down pat because we want to move on to a couple more today um it's kind of like the preacher who kept preaching at his church the same exact notes in the same servant for about six weeks and finally the Deacon board got enough courage to come and ask him are you going to move on a little bit you've preached exactly the same sermon the congregation's asking are you going to get a fresh sermon and he said when they start living that then I'll get another sermon trust me I'm preaching to myself on these things and I'm going through a change in my own personal life I thank the Lord for it it's hard but I thank the Lord for it so let's go back um if we can figure all this out let's go back to our uh just quickly go over the first things this is the bride's more excellent way and I'm skipping through so these were the 15 in First Corinthians love is patient love is kind love is not jealous love does not brag or boast love is not proud or arrogant love is not rude love is not self-seeking love is not easily provoked to anger love does not no friends I'm this comes from your Bible this doesn't come from me this is the more excellent way how many want to lay your life for God say I want that more excellent way it's for me amen I mean you know I was thinking about something yesterday I thought brother Brown preached hearing recognizing and acting upon the word of God and that's three stages it's wonderful the way he brings it out because what I find is there's a lot of people that stay at the stage of just hearing his word they come to a message church hearing they'll nod yes hearing hearing hearing but there's another stage and that's recognizing what this is it's a revelation of what this is you can stay your whole years in the message just in the hearing stage but there's other stages it's recognizing what it is recognizing what God wants to do and then there's acting upon it I trust we can move from hearing to recognizing to acting upon the word of God I love to hear a little testimony in my church of somebody Who's acting upon the word of God they're not hearers only but they're doers of the word of God amen all of these are in your Bible it's all in the love chapter it's all Divine love the bride's victory in Divine love this is the more excellent way it's not more a national healing Revival it's not great uh tent revivals can you say man it's not that we have a big explosion of the gifts of the Spirit that's that's not promised Paul said it here in First Corinthians he said when that which is perfect that which is the part is done away it's not what we ever do away with the nine spiritual gifts or all the prophecies in the church we don't do that but you say there's he said there's a more excellent way and if we gravitate around if we really get around just all the gifts and as long as that's happening we're okay and not pursuing and say but Lord I want to grow in the more excellent way we're losing something in our Victory because we can have we can always have all of the the gifts working we can always have healings and miracles we had some this week we'll always have it but if we got all of that and not have this Capstone love we're nothing you and the message that are listening if you've got all that going on in all the conventions and everything taken place praise be to God but all that without the Capstone victory in your life personally it means absolutely nothing that's a bold statement but it does I'm saying what Paul said love does not keep record of others wrongs love does not rejoice with injustices or iniquity love excuse me love rejoices when truth prevails love bears and protects things love believes the best of things first love always has hope for all things love endures and holds up during difficulties praise be to God should we just have an altar call now and just leave it at that I want it don't you it's our Bible this is and I've been I've been diagnosing and just dissecting these things because of this one this is what he said was the more excellent way then I want to know what the thought of God was behind what when Paul said this there's a love of the world that gives and gives to charities but that's not what he's talking about because he said though I give my body to be burned though I give all my goods to feed the poor have not loved so this is a deeper love though I understand all Mysteries all Mysteries and have not this I am nothing that's why you've had ministers in our own ranks that could preach like an angel all the depths of God all the depths go and I love it as a preacher I love to hear the depths of God but we got we got one that could preach so deep everybody had him in oh he was just today he's in Florida wearing his shorts and you know away as far as he can away from this message and he could preach the mysteries of God and just Dazzle you so that's the Paul's saying that's not everything I love the mysteries of God and then he says though I give my body then he says though I have all the gifts and manifest all the gifts and have not love I am nothing so this is what he's pointing us to and this is what I I've been wanting to break down in the next few weeks we went through this when love is patient and we wrote the scriptures down there just moving on and a couple quotes that go with it love is kind this was a wonderful one to study be kind and helpful to one another tenderhearted compassionate understanding and and by the way I'm going to get you all these when I'm finished get you all these quotes there's a lot more quotes that go with each attribute of the Prophet I'm going to get you all those in a printout or digital and you'll be able to study it later on because I can't get to all the quotes in a service like this love is not jealous I just want to go back to this scripture in the Amplified he says in First Corinthians 3 3 you you saw in the Corinthians now you are still worldly now he's Christians it's Christians but he said you are still worldly controlled by ordinary impulses the sinful capacity for as long as there's jealousy and strife and Discord among you you are not unspiritual and spiritual and are are you not walk I'm saying that wrong as long as you have jealousy and strife disorderline are you not unspiritual are you not walking like ordinary men unchanged by faith he's saying that to Christians he's saying you're walking carnal you're you're walking like men you're walking like the ordinary men out there now there's your reactions you're Christians and the Corinthians were Christians have the Holy Spirit but Paul's talking but when you act like this you're walking like ordinary men and the church should not be walking like ordinary men there should be a district distinction in what we do how we react can you say amen and when there's Discord among you and and it's jealousy and strife you're walking like ordinary men like the rest God's changing us to something deeper can you say Amen all right so here's the next one love does not brag or boast love does not brag or boast and here's the scripture I gave you Matthew 6 1 says take heed that you do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee that's bragging do not sound a trumpet before thee as the Hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have Glory of men the fishing for praise they're wanting to put some put a trumpet out there and blow their own trumpet so that they can get the Praises of men verily I say unto you they have their reward but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right is doing so this is the way it was said by one guy oh let's finish the scripture that thine arms may be in secret thy father would seeth and secret himself shall reward me openly and when thou prayest Thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are for thy love to praise they love to pray standing in the synagogues in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily I saying to you they have their reward but thou will now pray US enter into thy closet and when thou has shut the door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly he that is tooting his own horn is usually Out Of Tune something wrong it's bragging it's boasting um there's something wrong with somebody who keeps directing the conversation back to their life their story their successes they have to one-up everybody When Love focuses on one another on the other person love focuses on that but this person it's not that we can't give glory to God and brag on him or break or say God did this in my life and there's there's a certain way that you can bring it but this is a constant directing things back to me myself and I and bragging about it love focuses on another not self and there's another thing love focuses on and that's giving glory to God when you're bragging about yourself you're not giving glory to God so we're called in Divine love to to and over and over again the prophet said he said people say you one lady said you brat you talk about Jesus you brag on him all the time he says I'm guilty I'll brag on Jesus Christ my whole life and what he's done in my life but that's giving glory to God and that's not to self not focusing on yourself all the time John McArthur JR says bragging and pride stem from selfishness and they are the flip side of jealousy we've already dealt with jealousy and what that is and that's not in Divine love as well but jealousy this is the flip side of jealousy jealousy is wanting what someone else has bragging is trying to make others jealous of what you have so you're talking about it constantly because you want to get attention you're craving for attention so you're bragging on yourself and your successes and all that you've done Divine love doesn't do this jealousy is wanting what someone else has bragging is trying to make others jealous of what we have jealousy puts others down bragging builds us up bragging is an outward manifestation of Pride we'll get to Pride in a minute but bragging is the outward manifestation of Pride the braggart tries to impress others of his Great accomplishments in order to make himself look good after all I've done for you honey and you treat me this way to your wife after all look at all I've done and you start to listen All and after all have I done I've done for you you treat me this way but love isn't trying to build me up love is trying to build up the other person love is humble The Humble loving person is aware that everything he has everything he has is an undeserved gift from God I've built this business up for years and made it what it be everything you have every gift you have every success you have the glory should go back to God I gave 30 years to that company 40 years to that company blessed God I did this you didn't do nothing for 30 years without the strength in your body from the Lord I won awards I've got this and I was recognized by the big guys in the interest Industries you better give that Glory back to God if you are you better look at Joseph Who Rose to the high ranks you better look at Daniel Who Rose to the high ranks but he gave the glory back to God because he lived the way he lives he lived When Trials came and he was in the midst of lions the Lions wouldn't touch him because of the way he lived he gave the glory to God when they wanted to build even the king wanted to say you're a dreamer you're a prophet we're going to even serve your God because of you you we're going to build an image unto you no no no we're not doing that this is this dreams these dreams that I have these Visions every gift that I have I cannot take one ounce of the glory from it now we're talking about Divine love a humble loving person that records everything he has his undeserved gift from God we'll get to that more in a minute so he doesn't boast but thankfully uses what God has given him to serve others Proverbs 27 2 says let another praise you and not your own mouth let a stranger praise you and not your own lips it's not bragging and building up ourself is not supposed to come from our own mouth our testimony of who we are should stand by itself with other people testifying of it but when we're we feel like we're lacking enough praise we've got to step in and praise and brag on ourselves the Bible says otherwise let another praise you not your own mouth a stranger and not your own lips and James 3 5 7 he even sold the tongue as a very little member and but it boasteth great things praise the Lord just a little tool just just carving very very little that you and it's work he's working on me too because I realized that I talk too much about my things that I have I give glory to God I walked out of the barn today and I said Lord I wept I looked at my house I looked at my barn I never had a barn I mean I never thought I needed a bar and then I got one and I needed beautiful home in seven acres it's just it's just and I just wept and I said Lord I I never would have thought that you would bless me I don't have any of this because any of my efforts and I mean that but every once in a while to spill out and I'll talk about my quarter of a mile driveway I think brother Kenny got me back one time oh the quarter of a mile driveway quarter of a mile drive that's all I hear something like that you better watch your attitude yeah I was bragging about it until I realized I got a snow plow all that snow off of a quarter mile drive I wasn't thinking of that even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things it's just a little member of your entire body but oh does it ever can it ever say some big stuff about yourself how great a matter a little fire kindleth brother Brown says a true a true great Revival it don't get headlines and things like that no no there's one thing that Jesus Christ lacked in his life I hate to say that but he did Jesus lacked one thing a modern Showmanship he wasn't a show-off no everybody today has got to have a great big headlines and bragging what they're doing that's a stuffed shirt that's right that's not a servant of God a servant of God will keep humble and keep himself back hey man he's not he wasn't Showmanship he wasn't bragging and and the revivals today if God's doing a personal I personally believe that it's a personal Revival that's happening in you and if you're having a personal Revival in your life maybe the whole church doesn't even isn't gonna gonna hear about it the whole world's not going to hear about it and God doesn't care as long as he gets the glory but we want to recreate these big National revivals in these big and this is a movement going on my my and brag about it and several places I read last night he said and we want to brag of this and we want to brag of that and how big the preacher is brother Bram saying this brag how big our church is God have mercy on us for bragging about that that has zero to do with what God's trying to do numbers mean zero to God it's quality it's five people there filled with the spirit that's all he needs wherever two or three are gathered can you say Amen and so we get into this mode of who has this and the biggest that and and so I I wanted to read this to show Jesus wasn't that way of course we don't want to be bragging about what's going on and all these other things we don't want to do that except we're giving glory to God so that's uh the bragging part but it's interrelated here and remember what brother Bradham said there it's it's it's there's something about Jesus said he's still with me Jesus said my Works testify of me so your life will testify and speak louder than telling people how great your life is today they say it with pictures on the internet what I find about bragging today is people don't necessarily have to say it with their mouth they say it with their Facebook page what an age of bragging about your life on social media what an age of bragging through pictures if most of your pictures are about yourselves there are some Facebooks that the only picture we see is the person who's on the Facebook pictures of themselves constantly different outfits and all these other things if it's mostly of yourself you've got a problem you have a problem to bring to the Lord you're bragging most the pictures of themselves or their life and who they know and who they met and their successes you know it's it's it's nice if they look to others and and praise others and and build up the kingdom of God but they put all the stuff on to impress other people and as I've said it before and I've preached on this enough to the youth and everyone adults is that we have to be careful that we're not feeding a lack that social media can feed a lack within us don't shut me down don't shut me down if it's true to your life go home and take it to the altar we have to be careful we're not using social media to feed a lacking of praise and a lacking of approval that needs to be filled by the Holy Ghost by God Maybe by your husband she shall be praised proverbs 31 Brothers she shall be praised maybe your wife is reaching for it somewhere else because you're not ever praising her you're not ever complimenting her can I get an amen from the sisters this morning I'm helping you out here maybe it's the same with the husband he's supposed to get his affirmation from the wife at home and and now he's looking for it for someone else and other people but you see God gives us these these fountains within our own lives and there's something wrong with a person bragging on the internet with its constantly about themselves and their successes just to bring it to about what back to what they've done there's something hungering within them that they will not recognize and they need a deeper walk with God for him to fill and make you satisfied and confident in your walk with the Lord there's some real confident people be on social media it's fine we're not going to get rid of it I'm not preaching against to get rid of it I'm just saying if it's feeding an ego if it's feeding your pride if it's feeding a lack of something spiritual in life you better take a look at that because anything worldly like that anything out there when it's a replacement for getting your confidence in God and with your family and your your your approval from others I saw the scriptures to let him let her let another man praise you well there's a certain part but you don't praise yourself you don't brag yourself I'm not getting enough likes this week so I'm going to throw up my vacation and some people's vacations it's just like the way it's presented none of us will ever have a vacation like that some of the dishes they're making and the pictures of and the presentation I didn't know this week until Thanksgiving was not just the food to eat but my wife said it's the presentation I did not know that till this Thanksgiving I said why is this why can't we just cook the food and eat it and I found out I'm 56 years old it's about the presentation I'm going how long does the presentation take place I'm hungry but the presentation and some of the food is in the presentation on these pictures it's just then you go back to what you got at home and stuff and you're going wow my life is just trash my vacation is just piddly but people can put it out there like my life is superb and yours is trash that's what it says yep all right sometimes people lie they lie to impress others it's all self-focused I'm trying to get us to grow into something deeper congregation not trying to save the world here I'm not going to try to correct all the message problems in one sermon that's I'm not doing that it's on my calling I'm taking it to the souls that God has given me and saying there's a more excellent way to live and God's calling it to us and these are the specifics of it when you do we lay before the altar you say God here it is Lord I'm guilty of these things I'm not strong in this area I know I have the love of God but this must get out in my reactions to life things God take this tongue that's a world of fire take this tongue and may it be replaced no Bragging let it give glory to Jesus Christ so in relation Pride now love is not arrogant or proud and and and um bragging and boasting is interrelated with pride you brag because you are proud so we have to talk about pride and pride could take me several weeks to talk about because pride is something throughout the scripture God hates Pride God hates any kind of pride pride keeps you from growing in the Lord Pride keeps you from going into a closer walk with him religious Pride I'll get to that in a minute but any kind of pride is a downer it keeps you away from being closer to God so uh you haven't pride is an overestimation of yourself an overestimation of your gifts and overestimation of your talents and we're familiar with the regular Pride we're familiar with the pride of life people work to achieve things they work hard to buy things to have things people work hard for a greater education and all that is fine people work hard sometimes to impress other people they spend much of their life trying to compete with someone else and they then but the the Trap is not having things or achieving things I just think when we're achieving and doing this should be to the glory of God but when you come to the end of it and you're so full of yourselves that you're smarter than everybody that you're better than everybody that you're Superior to everybody that you've done more than anybody then we're getting into pride and God hates pride and you'll never find it in the love of God the love of God does not have this when pride comes boiling up with an arrogant attitude of self-importance then come dishonor and shame but with the humble the teachable who have been chiseled ah teachable who have been chiseled by trial and who have learned to walk hunly with God there is wisdom and soundness of mind so that's the fruits of the humble but the fruits of a bowling up with arrogant attitude of self-importance it's all about three people me myself and I everything you'll destroy your marriage if you're all about yourself you destroy your family if you're all about yourself when pride comes arrogant attitude about self-importance then come dishonor and shame that's the fruits from this continued years of self-importance it's all about me all that comes is dishonor and shame in the family dishonor and shame in your life and other people's lives that's the fruit of it Philippians 2 and the appetite said make my joy complete by being of the same mind having the same love towards one another knit together in spirit intent on one person's purpose and living a life that reflects your faith and spreads the gospel the good news regarding salvation through faith in Christ do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit through factional motives or Strife but with an attitude of humility being neither arrogant nor self-righteous regard others as more important than yourself can you say Amen there's a scripture it's just plain as day that's in Philippians 2 in the Amplified amen but let me just begin to wrap this up here in the next 10-15 minutes are you still with me talk a lot about the pride of life and the pride of this world but to Christians I've got to move into an area of religious Pride because religious pride is the worst kind to think that you are more spiritual than anyone else as I read in Matthew 6 the Pharisees they did everything over the top and but they did it for the wrong motive they did everything over the top but it was to appear more holy than the other men I thank God that I'm not like this sinner here everything the Pharisees did was to appear more holy to other men as better than other men a religious spirit thinks it has it all together and looks down on others no one ever measures up to where they are at I hope you're listening to me one and all a religious spirit you don't want a religious spirit you want the Holy Spirit sometimes they can look like the real thing so much but it's not the real thing a religious spirit thinks it doesn't work for marriages doesn't work for churches it always messes things up because it thinks it has it all it looks down on others who are not Measuring Up and actually no one ever measures up to where they are a husband never measures up the wife never measures up to a legalist or to a person that's got a religious spirit nobody ever measures up nobody lives the word tightly and closely enough for them and yet I find in people when I look deep in them that have a religious spirit when I look deeper into their eyes and deeper into their life and trust me we've seen and looked through people for many many years now when I look deep into them they are just like us empty many times they're just like us they've made mistakes like us we don't know about them but they've made mistakes like us they feel empty sometimes like us and they feel embarrassed by their true weaknesses but they want never want anybody to see them so Pride makes them put on a show Pride makes them put on a religious show not a you have people in the world like this but this is a religion so this is a message show that if I can appear spiritual and that I know more quotes to the next person and that I know more Mysteries than the next person and that I'm dressed and even the prophet addresses and is your life worthy I believe he said and you've got your long hair and your long dress and you've got everything just right but you see if a brother brother Brian said if a pride goes with that that you're more holy than someone else you've got the wrong motive for wearing your dress you've got the wrong motive for having your long hair because you've got it in a religious project said I'm better than anybody you are not better because of those things in the essential thing of your soul and your life without God you are nothing and putting on the long hair and dress does not make you make it into heaven can you say Amen it's about what's in that soul and without the Holy Ghost you're capable of the worst sin without the Holy Ghost you're capable you've got long hair but you're capable of the worst vile sin without the Holy Ghost so why not quit boasting of everything go ahead and do it follow the word of God God appreciates that God will honor it can you say Amen but don't ever do it to put on a show here's some interesting things that the prophet said about this back in a message called Pride go back and read this message what does the Pharisee word mean in the Greek it means an actor someone who acts oh I hate that somebody acting trying to put on I despise such a thing many times people are trying to act like the other fella listen you quit trying to act like the next fella and just act out your own convictions and get get along better be yourself and find out that the most of the people and I find out the most people that's growed on the whole environment of the American people to act we're great actors Pharisees tell you where he where we learn it they there there they are we'll see them they're better for the screen before they're before the screen so much until they always acting and I skipped the quote there a little bit but he said this is a Hollywood we learn it from Hollywood we're consumed with Hollywood and Hollywood is a world of actors they're acting out something because we feed on that America feeds on that he says then they become actors the American people through television and through picture shows they have seen so much of the put on till they become put-ons themselves too bad and we get it in the church actors hmm God don't want them far be it from us to be actors be yourself God wants you to be that way I despise seeing someone to trying to do something that they cannot do putting on a show it's become actors Pharisee putting on something so you can appear spiritual to everybody else I've noticed it many times in beautiful voices that God has given to people a talent and then they over train it I hate to hear an overtrained voice when they stand up to sing and get some kind of a note till they hold it so long till they get blue in the face just to show the congregation how long they can hang on for dear life I don't believe brother Rams is against training I never read that quote that way he's not talking about that he's talking about somebody's becoming a show-off and it's not about the anointing it's not about the life it's not about the words of the song anymore it's how well they sing it so just to show the congregation how can they can hang out for your life and when they come back down then people's not praising God their mind is on the Note musicians and singers you do a disservice to people if the attraction is all on you supposed to be on the Lord supposed to be on the anointing sing your heart out sing to your very best that God has given you to do but if you have in your heart to draw that praise to yourself and all of a sudden I've watched musicians and I'm not saying that we we got good Brothers here and good sisters playing and good Hearts I believe it but it's always good these type of quotes are all good because God's blessed us so much with so much musicians in this church we thank God for it but I've watched sometimes somebody showing off on the organ or the piano I'm not saying here but years ago somebody's just they're playing real loud and they're playing above everybody else and they're doing all the things and doing all the licks and all that and you can't hear anybody else and eventually the congregation stops worshiping because all the attention is on the guide doing the solo and nobody's asked him to do a solo he's doing one anyway the worship's gone any musician or singer who doesn't who distracts the people from entering in to worship themselves doing a disservice we got music directors here brother Michael brother Kenny they have this heart it's all about worship and drawing those people into worship sing your best We Believe here playing our best playing skillfully continuing to grow and learn become better at your gift we believe in all that some people say why I know two chords and I I played 20 years ago in church do you know any more chords no just the same two chords you can only sing in those two keys how ridiculous you're not doing your best for the Lord we believe in doing playing skillfully and doing our best and getting better and better at it for the glory of God but don't you ever distract from the worship to the people's minds are not on praising God but on the Note I love good old-fashioned Pentecostal singing where you raise up your hands with tears running down your cheeks whether you could sing Do Re Mi Faso latido or not and just sing in the spirit from the heart you give praise to God all out of the program you have to get out of man's program to get into God's program get out of it oh my deliver me from being an actor be what you are God will bless you but a Pharisee oh I hate that word I'm I'm an actor some sisters do the same thing got a lot of acting about them oh they'll cut their husband's nose off John why did you do that that's how they acted home John why did you do that I'm glad you used John because that's my name John Paul John why do you do that my wife didn't say that but he's talking about a woman here I don't know who she is John why did you do that just as Snappy as they can oh my God delivered me from ever calling on you if that's the kind of spirit you have but let someone talk on the phone with him someone else who how do you do I'm so glad that you called John what are you doing hello Pharisees actors being something different at home than you are a church I never completely judge you by the way you act here everybody acts good here who's going to do anything bad here Worship the Lord I'm glad you do but my question is how do you act at home actors shame on you house Angels Road devils you think I'm a hard preacher putting on just be yourself all the time that's the best way don't you believe it sure you know how to take you then not actors not Pharisees go to church on Sunday and know how Pious you are and on Monday morning nobody could get along with you your employers can't get along with you and the reason they can't get along with you you can't even get along with yourself how Pious you are on Sunday hapaisha and on Monday morning nobody can get along with you you Pharisee what good does it do you to go to church foreign I want to read a scripture here I know I got a couple more minutes and I'm going to take this over to something Paul said in First Corinthians 4 6 I'm going to read it I believe it's the Amplified I can't remember just what it is here let me see yeah it's Amplified this is an interesting scripture and it tells me there must have been some divisions going on he does mention in First Corinthians he mentioned some say I am of Paul I am of cephas I am of this teacher I'm of that so I already had that kind of plain favorite preachers going on Paul kind of breaks it down here in chapter four he said now I have applied these things that is the Anna analogies about factions factions are divisions to myself and Apollos for your benefit Believers so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written in Scripture so that none of you will become arrogant and boast in favor of one minister or teacher against the other have we done this in our own ranks have we done this in our own ranks yes we have yes we have so that none of you will become arrogant and boast in your favor of one Minister teacher against the other for who regards you as Superior or what sets you apart as special so he's saying you're choosing favorite ministers but it's not just that you have got a pride about you and you're bragging about your teacher and you're bragging about your minister and you're bragging about your favorite and you're bragging bragging about as if you have become Superior in what they're bringing in your Revelation you're Superior to everybody else have we had any of this in our own ranks well I can't get people to respond I been around a little bit but see the Bible has the answers it was happening back then so it's not just the minister he might get an arrogant Spirit about himself an over exaggeration of himself and that he's going to bring new things to the bride and he's going to correct all the message problems in one sermon and he can become like trust me we know some of them but but it's when the congregation members get the superior attitude Superior Revelation our church is this we're doing this for who regards you as Superior what sets you apart is special this happens very subtle in movements in the message very subtle the superiority comes in that we're the place to be we're the church you need to be at if you're mincing this convention you're missing everything and say it publicly please let the day be over of raising up just one teacher that's going to take the bride to rapturing Faith my Bible Bible says a faithful Ministry and when you lift up one man too far you're going against the scripture can you say amen I don't care who they are I don't care what Dove has appeared to them I don't care what Vision they have if there's no scripture for that man you're wrong in lifting up that one teacher and they're wrong for letting you do it for who regards you are superior what sets you apart special what do you have what do you have that you did not receive from another and if in fact you received it from God or someone else why do you boast as if you had not received it but had gained it by yourself this is the point that I want to end on this morning is that everything that we have comes from God whatever revelation we received we have no right to boast of it to brag of it or it came through a certain teacher we have no right to do that we have received nothing of ourselves we have not brought it to ourselves so we have no Bragging Rights can I get an amen we have no personal bragging rights for everything that we have within us today I hold within me I Not only was crying this morning over what God has given me but I was crying over something greater and that's the Revelation he's deposited in my heart I can't get over the riches that he's placed within me and guess what I didn't learn any of them I didn't get any of them myself it's what God deposited into this soul he did it through the fightful ministry I could acknowledge a lot of men that's been a blessing to my life but God did it through those men Paul's saying we don't have any there's no bra but Paul's saying is that in my Amplified version we have no Bragging Rights because we received it from God or someone else God through someone else why do we boast as if we had not received it but had gained it by herself we don't have bragging rights because this may this bring true humility in our lives and love in our life is to really know that we can that what we can be what is it in our lives that we can be proud of in ourselves what can we brag of everything that we have has come from him if you have a revelation it came from him I wonder if you could get out of that um PowerPoint and bring up the scripture as I in Deuteronomy 8 17 and 18. I didn't have this one in the PowerPoint but I'm I'm ending this morning I'm I trust it's been a blessing to you I've taken a little longer than usual but I trust you take it and take it and pray with these things hope it's a blessing to you hopefully I get an encouragement to you to lift you take you further we're ministering if we can to everybody this morning we're even given ministering Comfort to Ohio State fans this morning depression whatever it is we'll pray over you Deuteronomy 8 17 says and thou say and this is a scripture that's saying when you get in the promised land and you're blessed and your herds are blessed and the food and everything probably don't forget the Lord and that and that's how Thou shalt say in thy heart my power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth but Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his Covenant which he swear unto your fathers as it is this day we must never forget and this will get rid of bragging this will should get rid of pride that whatever we have has come from the Lord the power to work the power to live the power to get wealth can you say amen and wealth can mean not just the wealth of this world but the wealth of Revelation that this bride enjoys don't forget you didn't get it for yourself you didn't get from some super duper teacher it all comes from the Lord aren't you grateful this morning it should humble us to say Lord let me not take any Glory myself but let me say if I have a family this morning if I have a lovely wife if I have a lovely husband you know it all you say well I did that I got that no no there's something that trumps all of it if I'm blessed all every good and perfect gift has come from God you come through trials and you come out of the overcoming and you come out better for it and you come out better instead of bitter you ought to raise your hand and say thank God I'm still here I'm still here this morning brother Ed I'm still here I don't know how I'm still here but I'm still here by his grace I'm still here and if I have anything good if I have anything uh that's of of of of of significance in my life at all I did not I can't boast of it because I didn't get it for myself I got it from him and when brother Brown went to the meeting for the first time to see tongue's interpretation in any Indiana Fort Wayne I think it was wherever that tent meeting was he as a Baptist had never seen the gifts of the Spirit working he was very impressed he said I want to study this he'd be in a study realized it was scripture okay and I have a quote here when I was just going to say it to you before we close and he said there were two men that both spoken tongues and prophesied in the meeting he said so now if I can just get to those two men he said the little gift within me I want to discern these men so he went to the first one he said I found him to be a very humble Christian he could see his life he was humble serving God he had tongues and interpretation and it was true and everything was great he went and found the other guy and he says he was arrogant he was proud he was bragging and yet he was manifesting the same gift of the spirit of tongues and interpretation now we don't dump out the tongues because of that but we realize what Paul said is right though I speak with tongues of men and angels and if you've got bragging and arrogance and pride with it you're missing something it's saying to us you can have all the gifts going on in the church but there's a more excellent way for all of us to come to by his grace Grace Grace God's grace Grace that will pardon and cleanse Within rain God's Grace that is greater than all go ahead and stand up everybody a couple young guys visiting this morning good to have you guys God bless you thanks for coming come back hope you enjoyed yourself amen all of our visitors let's pray you don't have to speak through me to the Lord you can speak to the Lord directly yourself you can talk to him this morning This Love that I'm preaching about it's available to you this Holy Ghost is available to you why let the world keep forming you into some type of addict or something why let him continue why let the devil make you a puppet and keep manipulating your life why don't you turn your life over to the Great sculptor Christ mowed you into something of a Son of God why don't you let him do that this morning Father as we look at this image of your character we can only humbly lay ourselves in our hearts before your throne and say the Lord let that let the spirit of God mold this deeper in me I'm here to ask forgiveness Lord if I've done or said anything opposite of these things which I have father I'm asking you to mold my life and burn it out of me that I would no longer jump in the ring with somebody or fuss with somebody or defend myself or brag Lord forgive me Lord forgive me for taking the glory too many times when I know it had to be your work doing that [Music] pray for people around the world and just went to meetings and stuff and people a lot of compliments and things but Lord Jesus I know whatever good happens in people's lives it's because you showed up and you did something through our gift and I had to return that glory and give it to you Lord help us Lord help us to be more loving more loving Christians burn all the pride out of us Lord if we have any confidence let it be that we're a Son of God Son of Abraham what our reactions would be just that we don't have to defend ourselves we don't have to fight Isaac didn't have to fight say these are my fathers these are my father's Wells I have a right to them he didn't say nothing he just kept serving the lord kept digging the wells fresh water came out of him you blessed him Lord and you visited him I think you were pleased with his life give us that love Lord Express that love through us forgive us Lord in our homes and families the people we love the most is the people sometimes we hurt the most forgive us for that let us cherish one another as we're living and walking with royalty let us have that respect father I committed to you would commit Our Lives to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen praise the love never give
