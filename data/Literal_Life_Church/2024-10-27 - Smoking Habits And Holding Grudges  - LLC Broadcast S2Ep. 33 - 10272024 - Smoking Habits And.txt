thy brother in thine heart where in thine heart Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and suffer and not suffer sin upon Him Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself I am the Lord there's another scripture in Proverbs 19 I will add to this Proverbs 19 and verse 11 the discretion of a man deferreth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression I want you to notice here now we we have uh we have our interpretation of what the glory of the Lord is and I believe we're experiencing the glory of the Lord in this place this morning I believe the glory of the Lord can do many things to let us know his presence is here but let us not limit the glory of the Lord because this man when he when he defers his anger and when he passes over a transgression then there's a glory in that as well don't limit the glory of God so when this man forgives this when when this man releases and he passes over a transgression and he lets that anger flow away from his heart and his heart is clear there is a glory of God in that there's a glory of God in that so this morning I I'd like to speak a little bit on and this is a strange title smoking habits and holding grudges but in the proverb that we read it speaks of a glory of a on a man that is the power of forgiveness he he overlooks a matter he releases a matter he defers his anger towards someone when he does that there's a glory of the Lord that's in that there's a power we know there's glory in saying to this mountain but there's a glory in the Lord when you forgive from your heart we may not see the results of that but nevertheless the glory is in a man who defers his anger and overlooks the transgression Hallelujah ah praise the Lord I want that kind of glory and so when we come into that truly it is it is of god this glory is of God and it sets us up into a freedom in us that empties us out empties us out and makes more room for more of his glory can I say it again yes what is why is he teaching on forgiveness because it empties us out of things that are shadows in our hearts so it empties us out so that more of his glory can work in our vessel I want to remind you all that the power of Calvary was released to us when he died the full power of redemption was released to us when he died can you say amen he said when he died the whole Earth Earth shook it was such an incident and Redemption was finished for Sons and Daughters of God and it pulled Sons and Daughters of God not only Jesus but other sons that had died in him it pulled them into the power of Resurrection when Jesus died it triggered a resurrection and the Saints come out of the Grave when he cried from the cross and says it is finished it was completely finished and now not only him but Sons could enter into Resurrection power and so that was the power of Resurrection but moments before the resurrection power came before these are the words that came from Jesus as he looked at those that were shaming him gossiping at him falsely accusing him beating him scoring him gossiping against him embarrassing him he looked at those people and he said father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing they're doing this but they don't know what they're doing and so he released a forgiveness the power of forgiveness was released to them and none of those people even deserved it can I get an amen this morning they didn't deserve getting any forgiveness but I'm here to say the power of forgiveness was released before the P other powers and the power of Resurrection came there was something that was released in him to say I forgive you forgive them Father they don't know what they're doing forgiveness and the power of forgiveness was released before the power of Resurrection was released maybe that's why Jesus put it in Mark chap 11 maybe we shouldn't look down so much and try to hide things but to say Lord I really need to release all of my ought in my heart against those who've done me wrong if we're really serious about more faith if we're really serious about walking in the precepts where the bride should be walking if we're going to preach it and we're going to say Amen to that then we have to say Amen to say God change my heart soften my heart that I can release this forgiveness in me and release this ought in me and forgive those who have done me wrong you may be there this morning and I say praise God you're further along than a lot of the rest of us God bless you brother Paul I don't have any odd against it I'm a free person people have done me wrong I've released it like the maturity of Joseph to say what they did in evil God has turned it to my good that's the only way I'm going to look at it that's my predestinated trials every evil that's been done to me every gossip it's turned to my good God bless you but for those of the rest of us who have things come along that that you hold there I pray that you could leave this morning with it released but when we leave I pray that we would leave because Jesus released the power and the height of forgiveness was released and all the other power was released after Resurrection all power in fact he said the words in Matthew 2818 all power is given unto me in heaven and earth full Authority was given when full forgiveness was given I don't know if you've ever heard this before you have but I want to emphasize it over and over again that with Jesus the full and complete Authority was released until he said all power is given to me in heaven and earth the full power was released and Authority when all forgiveness was released amen Peter's Last Words excuse me step's last words as he was stoned while he was being stoned lay not this sin to their charge and he left with the heavens opened up to him the glory of the Lord opened up to him are you listening this morning while they were stoning him Stephen said Lord don't lay this sin to their charge so why my title that says smoking habits and holding grudges this is it from a quote smoking habits and holding grudges I want to talk about grudges holding grudges there's much to say about it and then this this particular prayer line it stuck out to me he said uh brother B says in 1957 while you're praying shed in with God there was those who raised their hands they they that wanted a walk with God wanted to open their hearts to him the altar is open now my friend I'd invite each one of you to come here at the altar and kneel down and say Lord Jesus be merciful I want you to come into my heart move all my fears move all my selfishness move everything out and come in come into my heart and be Lord oh I believe you're my savior but you haven't been my Lord how many know there's a difference there's a difference in just being Savior and being Lord that means he takes up housekeeping and takes control of this vessel that means if there's something that's odd something that's wrong it has to be released for him to fully set up housekeeping I don't just want him to be my savior I want him to be my Lord now look at this is just a small statement and now this is the discernment he looks at this brother and and if you read the messages you see the discernment uh when that came came on him and he knew those things it was accurate he could see their life he could see the doctor talking he could tell their name he could do their house number their street number and and brother brandom did not know that but God knows it tells us God knows all things about us he knows your house number he knows the trial your family's going through he's completely aware probably more than you are of your problem problems and he proved this by that son of man gift working through a vessel like brother brandham God bless you brother this man's name is Davis he comes from Virginia he's here to give up a habit of smoking and a little Grudge that he's held in his heart against a loved one since he was a child and when I read that I thought oh my there's my sermon that's what he's at the altar for this morning this is things we come to the Altar for now first of all I don't really have to preach against smoking at least I hope I don't have to if you've got that filthy Habit in your life and it's been proved over and over again for many many years of the damages to your body and this is what you find with smoking addicts is that they're doing that I think when we come to smoking there's no benefit to it and yet people are so uh pretend they're so addicted that they'll actually know that it causes damage my grandpa and grandma Le Fontaine died of lung cancer and Up Until the End she's smoking those just smoking smoking smoking and she kns knows what it's going to do other family members died how can a person know that and do it that's how much an addiction can take you and that that's how much a person can hold tightly on to something even if it's doing them damage so my question to you is if that can happen with a smoking habit which everybody knows then this other thing that this man come to the Altar for and I don't even know if he knew about the other thing this is Brother Brown Discerning this is what you're at the altar for I think the other part was hidden since he was a child that he was holding a grudge he might not have even known but I want to make the point whether it's being released of a habit of smoking or whether it's being released of a grudge it's the same thing it's still something that holds on to a person and this brother it was his whole life what was it some no a grudge against a family member we don't know what it was but it was a a grudge and he's at the altar to pray this is his need this is his name this is where he's from and he's got two things and to us it looks like two very separate things that's why I've said before recently in the past is that we have healing lines and and and prayer lines for deliverance of demons and deliverance of diseases if this is true where's the prayer lines to pray for grudges praise the Lord because here to me I don't see it too much as being two things that were holding this man holding him down holding his heart against a loved one and they're both things that binding him and both things he needed to be delivered from can you say amen he is at the altar for a smoking hat Abit and a grudge and I guess he needed freedom from both it was all the way since he was a child that he held a grudge how long can a person hold a grudge how long can a person hold a grudge he wants us to forgive and release grudges why they are bad and I want to safely say this morning they're just as bad as smoking smoking is bad bad right we all agree all the young people everybody smoking is bad both are dangerous smoking has years of research showing cancer and other things coming from it and yet someone when they hold on to a habit when they hold on to that they think it's not doing that much damage but over time it's doing damage people know the re the research and still hold on to it but is the same with a grudge against someone it has terrible damage as well that's why they hold on Lord deliver me from this nicotine Spirit sometimes they will say but nothing in their unforgiving spirit that they've had in a grudge for years in the science science says forgiveness reduces stress and improves Health holding on to grudges causes and I you know you can look at this yourself I don't want to read a lot of science or the psychology about about it but holding on to grudges this is clearly science now this is not uh any from any Christian Source holding on to grudges causes chronic stress which harms your health and well-being forgiving others lowers stress hormones like cortisol decreases blood pressure and leads to a stronger immune system it also lowers the risk of depression and anxiety studies show forgiveness even slows aging and increases longevity boy do I ever need to forgive cuz I want to live a little longer so you know this is science and you know what if you think that these inward heart things don't affect you physically go through the prayer lines and find out as he would say you can be healed of this but the real core problem was this thing and it wasn't a physical problem it became a physical why does the Bible say say laughter doeth good like a medicine if you're happy and you're free and you're laughing there is a medicine even for your own physical body and then it says when you forgive science says it leads to changes in your brain that improve your ability to regulate emotions and reactions activity in the AM magdala which I hope I'm saying that right magdala which processes fear and anger decreases areas linked to empathy positive feelings and emotional control become more active what when we forgive this rewiring makes you less reactive and more compassionate over time this rewiring how many want to be rewired this morning not by psychology but by the Holy Ghost happiness the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink the kingdom of God is not just a dress code but it's righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible says this life is a life and it should be of joy in the Holy Ghost on Monday on Tuesday why aren't you enjoying the joy of the Holy Ghost but beyond that what we're preaching on this morning it's a hindrance to Mountain Moving Faith how many want Mountain Moving Faith this this lack of forgiveness is a hindrance to Mountain Moving faith it is a hidden stronghold that Limits The Authority and the confidence of the believer forgiveness the power of it Martin Luther says if you guys could pull that up again Martin Luther says and and just for those who are watching there were seven angels in Revelations these were seven Messengers to the seven Church ages all seven had a portion of Truth all seven believed closer to the original word Paul preached than all the rest of them there's seven angels in God's right hand sometimes we quote from them we we quote a lot from the last one the seventh because he's the most recent one to us but all those these Messengers you'll find Harmony between them Luther says for just as we sin greatly against God every day if you don't think that's right then you can go to the message and find that we we sin every day now that's not to give you a license this week if it gives you a license say oh man we sin every day now I'm going to go do stuff you got the wrong thing in your heart but humility says I said every day brother Brown said he made mistakes that's why we need the blood that's why we need to forgiveness of sin so for justice we greatly sin against God every day and yet he forgives it all through Grace so we also must always forgive our neighbor who does US harm violence and Injustice Bears malice against us Etc we it's linked together the Forgiveness of God and the Forgiveness of others is linked together now the commentaries they they really especially when they're really on the justification side because when you go they want to run to Romans and different places to talk about what justification is there's nothing hinging in our actions on the on the justification of God we're justified by faith nothing attached to it so the scripture Jesus said if you don't forgive neither does your father in Heaven forgive you it looks like it jeopardizes that justification but it doesn't in the eyes of God a Son of God when they're dipped in the in the blood of Jesus Christ as far as in the eyes of God they're Justified just as if they ever never did that's the standing with God but on an everyday basis if we hold a grudge and don't forgive then God has to forgive us also on an everyday basis and it can limit that in other words you can't say I'm holding on to this Grudge I can't I can't let it go I can't let it go well then God just looks at that and says you're limited yes it's not that God doesn't justify You by his blood as the Son of God but it's that on an everyday basis yes if you're going to live a life of an unforgiving Spirit towards people then it's going to limit the authority you have as a Believer your prayer prayers will be hindered how many knows your prayers can be hindered and that's what I'm preaching about I don't want my prayers hindered anymore I want the prayer of faith I want when I pray for somebody there's results how how long it takes is up to God but I want to I want my prayer to pierce Heaven Can you say amen and get results that's it should be the desire number one desire of every believer but you see now Paul talks about if we don't treat our wives like a CO Heir in the Kingdom in a vessel she's the weaker vessel but is a daughter of God she's co-s with you now I realize when I'm saying that I'm cross some some culture sometimes they still look at the woman down here and the man up here that's not what the Bible says in a vessel she's the weaker vessel but as coars with you in a marriage you are together in that co-s together equal because Adam and Eve were equal in the garden amen that's right amen and we're coming back to that that's why a man should treat his white and Paul said you better treat her white as a daughter of God or your prayers will be hindered so if there's other things that can hinder a prayer then we look at a lack of forgiveness that can hinder not only Luther said it but also I believe we have one from John Wesley another messenger in God's right hand God forgives us as we forgive others so that if any malice or bitterness if any taint of unkindness or anger remains if we do not clearly fully and from the heart heart forgive all men their trespasses we far cut short the Forgiveness of our own God cannot clearly and fully forgive us he may show us some degree of Mercy but we will not suffer him to blot out all our sins and forgive all of our iniquities that's a pretty straight preacher under the sanctification uh restoration movement or reforming movement sanctification clean your life make your out holy he's pretty straight about it he will not suffer to BL our sins and forgive all our iniquities that's pretty straight you got armenis and Calvinism both coming on the cross but they're saying the same thing and that is you cannot ignore an unforgiving spirit and come into the Forgiveness of God and fully and come into Faith an unforgiving Christian is an oxymoron failure to forgive is a result of either failure to accept or appreciate the Forgiveness that we have received there's something that you haven't come to the full forgiveness and the realization of how much God has forgiven you when you restrain your forgiveness to others
