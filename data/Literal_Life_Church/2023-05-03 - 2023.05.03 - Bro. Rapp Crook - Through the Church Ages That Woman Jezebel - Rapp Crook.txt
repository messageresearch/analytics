========================================

um while we're still standing maybe we can open up our Bibles to the Book of Revelation chapter 2. and Lord willing this evening we're going to continue on with the thyatiran church age start this up here and we have liftoff very good um by God's grace it seems you want to take a look at um that woman Jezebel that's spoken of in the thyatiran uh message in Revelation chapter two and uh see how the Revelation is a book of Prophecy and how that Jezebel spirit is referred to back in the Old Testament how it manifests itself there and then how it was taking a hold on the church in the age of thyatira and then all the way up into the present and there's some prophecy that'll be trying to take a look at today may the Lord has helped me to share it clearly and uh for me I remember looking at the prophecy this way um what's the purpose of it for me the purpose the big takeaway we look at properly to see that God's in control that's that's the big that's the big thing we can see he's gotten all he's taking care of the big picture over the thousands of years he can take care of the problem in my life too that's what we're going to try to look at so Revelation Chapter 2 and verse 20 um we'll just start here he says uh notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou suffrist that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and I gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not so behold I will cast her into a bed and then that commit adultery with her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds and they will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reigns and hearts and I will give you unto every one of you according to your works I just pray heavenly father I just ask your blessing upon our service this evening Lord I pray father that you would break the word clearly this evening Lord that we might see your hand both in the Old Testament the New Testament now and then even in our lives as well oh God I just pray that you would speak to each one of us tonight the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated as we look back at these two scriptures we just read where Jezebels mentioned just want to highlight a couple of the characteristics that Christ is bringing out as he speaks to John through the angel that woman Jezebel she calls herself a prophetess so she's she this some of the the church isn't recognize her as one God's not recognizing her as one but she's claiming this for herself so Jezebel one of the characteristics she's not receiving word from God she wants to be giving word out herself and that she want she's going to do what she wants to do and that's just a characteristically she's calling herself a prophetess and she's teaching what is she teaching she's teaching God's people to commit fornication she's seducing them unto it she's a seductress teaching people to commit fornication to eat things sacrificed under Idols so here she's folk she's she's she's ministering if you'd call it that to people who are who are trying and sincerely wanting to serve God but she is corrupting their desires and teaching them to do the wrong things and we're going to look in the Old Testament at these characteristics of Jezebel and we can see this is this is this is spot on we're going to see how how Jezebel acted in the Old Testament because I think is amazing God is such a gracious God he gave Jezebel space to repent he gave Ahab space to repent and we're going to see the past that they took when they both have the opportunity to repent Ahab and Jezebel made different choices but Jezebel is hard she is not willing to repent even though she's given the opportunity she doesn't and we'll see tonight what happens when we refuse to repent and we'll and we'll see what happens to uh to Jezebel here um there we have it um and then she's going to be cast into a bed and then they commit adultery with her there's going to be judgment but again God is gracious except they repent of their deeds he's continually offering repentance and the messenger of this age was Columba and these Irish monks who were carrying the gospel back reseeding the gospel back throughout Europe it's there for those who want to see it and then other the John Wycliffe the morning star of the Reformation John Huss and others at the end of this period they're also there giving the chance to repent but the Catholic Church hardens its heart and refuses that and verse 23 is important and brother Brandon points out something that you almost would would read over Christ says I will kill her children with death and he says he's referring to her children which means Jezebel has children she has daughters and we'll see what those daughters are what those children are but they're going to be carriers of death and we'll and we'll see that perhaps we can I have I have to I'll refer to some scriptures but they're all in the and and the notes as we go I'm going to take a look at the Old Testament references to Jezebel because there's a very ex there's a purposeful reference to her here he says that woman Jezebel if we're going to see what how Jezebel acted in the Old Testament and that really does strengthen the message if I attire because we're going to see how just how what an evil corrupt woman she was and what she did but we'll see first in First Kings chapter 16. and uh and verse uh verse 30. it says Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord above all that were before him and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nibat that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of f Bell king of those idonians and he went and served Baal and worshiped him and this is the marriage of convenience this is this is a political marriage um so that his his kingdom will be stronger he is not going to have to worry about his father-in-law attacking um this is this is a political marriage this is the very thing same thing that Constantine does he's bringing church and state together it's for political purposes there's no there's no love here um this is this is a political marriage but when Ahab marries Jezebel verse 32 says it says he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal first he's just marrying a jezebel but before too long it's not just his wife serving Baal that says he is also rearing up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal so what we have and in verse 33 it says and Ahab made a Grove so it's not just Jezebel he's getting the honeydew list and he's doing it too he's engaging in it and we can see what Jezebel does here the very first thing that happens when Ahab marries Jezebel the fruit of this marriage is official sanction to idolatry this is becoming official act where the king himself is building this Grove the king himself is building this altar this is how the Jezebel spirit Works she's bringing official sanction to idolatry and then next you'll see over in the First Kings chapter 18. um Jezebel um this is when Elijah is being fed by the Lord there at the brook cherith I believe and there's been no rain for a couple years and Ahab is going out to find um Elijah so we can take care of this rain problem and he takes with them um his one of his ministers Obadiah and Obadiah has been he's a sincere follower of Jehovah and he's hidden um prophets of God well why was it necessary to hide prophets of God in the days of Ahab and Jezebel well first Kings 18 uh verse 4 says it was so when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord that Obadiah took a hundred of them and hid them by caves and verse 13 reference to this also Obadiah is told by Elijah Elijah appears to Obadiah and said I will go and appear to Ahab tell your servant I'm going to be coming tell your king I'm gonna be coming and Obadiah is like why don't you come with me because if I go and tell Ahab that and you don't show up it's gonna be off with my head I want you with me and I just said no just go tell them I'll do what I say because verse 13 says obadia says haven't you heard that when Jezebel slew the prophet of the Lord that I did this this Good Deed by hiding prophets what we see here Jezebel is doing ever she can to purge Believers in God's promises this is not purging them getting evil out of their lives this is the kind of purging like Stalin did and cutting off their heads he wants all the True Believers to be gone that's what Jezebel wants to do the spirit of Jezebel she can't tolerate true sincere belief if you're not going to bow to her it's going to be off either bow your neck or cut the neck off she's not going to tolerate any any dissent the next characteristic of Jezebel we see is that she is going to incite her husband to Greater wickedness and when I was reading this this past week it just it just struck me the power of a spouse Ahab marries Jezebel and what an impact she has on his life she is inciting him to do more and more evil because here um First Kings chapter 20 one verses five through seven this is when Ahab goes walking and he sees this beautiful Vineyard next to his house and it's naboth's Vineyard he goes and asks neighbors can I buy it from you and they both says no I'm not going to sell this Vineyard this is part of my spiritual inheritance it's been in my family since Joshua told my tribe this is this is yours I can't give you even if you're thinking I can't give you what God gave to me this is this is mine I I can't sell it and Ahab comes home and he's just pouty he's just he's just all messed up because somebody told him no he's not used to that and Jezebel says what are you doing pouting you're the King this is easy to solve and she incites her husband to Greater wickedness he might have just gotten over it but she and says um as why is your spirit so sad that you eat no bread and he said unto her because I speak unto neighbor the Jezreel light and said to him give me your Vineyard for money or else I'll give you another Vineyard forward if you want that and he said I will not give you my Vineyard and jezebela's wife said to him Dash thou now govern the Kingdom of Israel arise eat bread let your heart be merry I will give you the vineyard of naboth adjust your light and she takes care of it she's inciting him to do more and more wrong and that's not the kind of spouse you want you and the spouse who encourages you in the Lord because you're going to be down sometimes even you want a friend who can pray with you who can who who can lift you up and doesn't tell you the easiest way to get your way when it's not God's will to do it that way but Jezebel said hey it doesn't matter if you want it I will help you get it and then the next characteristic that we see in First Kings 21 she's unrepentant this is after uh um Elijah gives the the final prophecy of judgment that the dogs will eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel and him that dieth of Ahab in the city of the dog shall eat Etc and then it's written there verse 25 there was none like unto Ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord whom Jezebel his wife stirred up so what are we stirring up our spouses to that's that's that's just for me a big a good question to think about verse 26 he did very abominably in following Idols according to all things as did the M writes and the Lord cast out before the children of Israel and it came to pass Earth 27 when Ahab heard these words of judgment that the rent is close and he put sackcloth on his flesh and fasted and laying sackcloth and went Softly don't write anybody off who would have thought that Ahab would have repented but he does God gave both Ahab and Jezebel space to repent and there was something in Ahab that laid dormant for a long time that had been that had been transgressed stepped over again and again and again but if you if we still have the slightest speaking of God's holy spirit in our hearts that is the most precious thing we have God heard ahab's prayer however um Jezebel did not repent I just think of verse 29 God says see is thou how Ahab humbles himself before me because he humbles himself before me I will not bring the evil in his days but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon this house God was merciful to Ahab Jezebel had the same chance she had space to repent but she refused now we know brother Brandon referred to the the children that uh that that Jezebel had in the fire Tyran age so I want to take a few minutes and look at the daughters of Jezebel and see what kinds of characteristics they had and we're going to see that the uh it's like mother-like daughter The Same Spirit that was in the mother uh the same modus operandi the word the way of operating that's where the daughter worked as well and second Kings chapter 8 it says in the fifth year of joram the son of Ahab king of Israel Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah johoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to Reign so it's about johoram here and he walked in the ways of the Kings of Israel as did the house of Ahab why how could the son of Jehoshaphat a righteous King How could jehosha a holy man son like that how could he be walking in the ways of Ahab the explanation is for the daughter of Ahab was his wife and he did evil in the sight of the Lord and we're going to see that just like the mother so is her daughter like it says in Ezekiel 16 44 athaliah just like Jezebel imported idolatry from the sidonians into Israel half a lie is going to import idolatry into Judah from Israel and that we'll see that um and second Chronicles chapter 22 we'll see again how this characteristic of of inciting greater wickedness in her spouse athaliah does this in second chronicles 22 it says on page three of the notes and says that johoram walked in the ways of the House of Ahab um this is not this is a um this is the Sun for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly so johoram passes away athelaya is in Queen and Judah I'm sorry she's not Queen it's it's their son who's the young boy the young man is is is is is the king but his mother is the counselor behind the throne and she is inciting him to do more weekly she was his counselor to do wickedly wherefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord like the house of Ahab for they were his counselors after the death of his father to his destruction so this this Jezebel spirit brings us to do more and more wickedness well after the sun passes away aphaliah sees his power and she goes about and executes a purge of all the House of David of all of anybody who would be heir to the throne anyway she executes a purge and kills all of them it sounds like the fairy stories almost where they kill every single person but one always escapes right and there's one little boy his name is joash he's hidden by the chief priest and he's he he said he's a young little guy and he's raised in the temple uh the the the priest raises him and teaches him until he finally comes I think to be seven years old and then then the priest introduces him to the people very very secretly this is a coup d'etat because athalia has been ruling uh for for some years now but we see this is just like Jezebel she is purging every heir to David's Throne she wants to have the power for herself and even when she's confronted with Wicked with with her wickedness she remains unrepentant just want to kind of show how this happens how this plays out in the genealogies you can't really read it too well that's not the point the point is on the left side you've got the House of David 's house is blessed with the promise and that promise goes from father to son son son son all the way down that's a straight line because there's a promise there that I've that that there will always be a man in the House of David upon the throne of Israel on the right side you have the you have the Kingdom of Israel this Kingdom isn't blessed with the same kind of Promise David's kingdom is so it kind of moves from one person there's a coup another person comes along a general kills that that King and then another and he becomes king on the throne just switches switches switches but I looked at this and I got to thinking about what brother Branham says about the two vines in the in the in the true church the false the false and True Vine in the church and you can see in the house of Israel there's idolatry from the beginning where is that Spirit of idolatry aiming that Spirit of idolatry is aiming right for that True Vine to see if he can swallow that up and try to try try to catch it brother Branham says in the days of Ahab Israel went into the Dark Ages it's in the days of Ahab or that false Jezebel spirit is trying to go from the house of Israel into the house of Judah and strangle the truth that was right there brother Branham says in the in the church age book is the Jezebel lafayatira was in no mood to give up her hold upon the people and thus we see her daughter aphalaya raise her head in the sardisian age with the hopes that she would be able to strangle the true seed by her schemes of organization and that's what she's trying to do she's trying to enter take over the uh take over the Throne of David so there can be no promise holder that that of of that of that promise that God gave to David she wants to take that she wants to be on the throne of promise that was her goal there and again she's completely unrepentant so when we look at the thyatyrian age it's like all the church ages Revelation chapter 1 says this book is a book of Prophecy so it's not just book of History what happened in the Old Testament when when this is spoken of that that woman Jezebel and the thyatiron church it's not just referring back to somebody who's like that woman Jezebel and this is a history lesson no it's that same Spirit John saying that's going to be coming here in the future it's going to be coming and she doesn't repent so it just keeps going and growing and growing throughout the ages this is talking about what athalia did and brother Branham saying look what Jezebel did she was so surrendered she took her daughter she had her daughter born here and this daughter athalia goes over here to this great holy man and takes and marries his son that's jehoshaphat's son and brings the same thing over in here from Jehoshaphat over into this part and that's what was trying to be done in the church ages as well and now notice the same thing they took Jezebel here at the Catholic church and down here she takes her daughter her organizations and marries it right into them down there and does the same thing to them killing the children killing her children with death and brother Brown says that's that's a spiritual death because as soon as that Spirit of organization comes in life is gone the spirit's gone that happened in the days of Ahab it happened in the days of jehoshaphat's son it happened in the days of thyatira and that Spirit still going on still today on page four he just kind of says the same thing um he's talking about um here's Jezebel and Israel it happened there but here's Judah a different type over here another one this was jehoshit over he was sincerely trying to serve God but the same thing comes into his house that's what happened with the uh just what happened at the uh um with the with the Kingdom of Israel so what we see have playing out in the Old Testament comes again the New Testament in the thyatar and there in this message of the church ages it's a book of Prophecy and it's going to be happening again in the future that's what it's telling about now the question what happens when you refuse repentance because that's what happens to Jezebel she in the thyatiron age she's given the space to repent but she doesn't repent what does she become the next time in the Book of Revelation that we see Jezebel is in Revelation chapter 17. and here um John is he's he he he sees a not sure if it's a literal Vision but but this is a vision we'll just call it that and one of the Seven Angels come which had the seven vowels and talked with me saying unto me come hither I will show you the Judgment of the great that's quite an advance from how we see Jezebel described in Revelation Chapter 2 Revelation Chapter 2 she's not a good woman she's teaching people to commit fornication she's not good but all of a sudden this description is is even worse and when you refuse repentance sin just goes to seed in your life and it gets worse and worse and worse and this is what we see happening to her I'll show you the the Judgment of the great that sits on many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication what's in red here is what I'm seeing is the same characteristics we saw of Jezebel the Old Testament the kings of the earth commit fornication with her Ahab did he was led into sin with her the kings of Judah were led into sin with her and she has made everybody who drunk with the wine or fornication she's inciting people to wickedness leading them into sin it happened then it happened in thyatir and it happens what John is seeing even further into the future verse three he carried me away in this Spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of Dames of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and Scarlet colored decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup and her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication I bet she's getting the desire for heart here she wanted a certain Throne she wanted that Throne of David that Throne of Promise the devil gives her a different Throne she seated upon this beast and she's she's Deck with everything her heart would desire but she didn't repent and because she's writing this power and not repenting she's going to be punished with Great Tribulation and with death because she didn't repent when it was given to her verse 5 and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and the bomb nations of the earth just like the Jezebel of the Old Testament had a daughter who went and led other other kingdoms True Believers into a sin just like it happened in the thyatiron age here in the end there's a great with a mother who's a mother of harlots leading more into Abominations of the Earth this woman is drunk with the blood of the Saints Jezebel in the Old Testament purged all the True Believers athaliah did the same thing doing everything she can this Jezebel spirit keeps on doing it she's drunk with the blood of the Saints with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration this is just this isn't John this is an impressive sight to him it's it's just it's it's amazing to him let's see what Jezebel has become and but if if we have space to repent take it because sin will take you farther than you want to go cost you more than you want to pay keep you longer than you want to stay it did hurt it cost her her life take that space to repent this uh this this Jezebel who refused repentance she becomes the great of Revelation 17 and we see this alarming illustration of the corrupting power of sin we see the also the characteristics of Jezebel that we've seen before here also displayed they want to focus for a little bit on this Beast that she's writing because this is not the first time that this beast on which she's sitting comes up in Scripture the first time it's referred to is in Daniel chapter seven perhaps we can turn over there Daniel chapter 7 verses uh one through seven I've got a short summary of bullet points on page five Ezekiel Daniel 7 verse 1. in the first year of belshazzar King of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters and Daniel spake and said I saw in my vision by night to Behold The Four Winds of the heaven strove upon the Great Sea and four great beasts came up from the sea just as in Revelation chapter 17 a beast comes up from the sea the first one was like a lion and had Eagle's Wings and beheld I beheld to the wings were plucked it was lifted from the Earth and then verse 5 he beholds another Beast a second like to a bear it raised up itself on one side three ribs in the mouth of it and it was told arise and devour much flesh verse 6 after this I beheld low another like a leopard which had upon the back of its four wings of a fowl the Beast had also four heads and Dominion was given to it and these three beasts are three kingdoms it's the Babylonian Kingdom the media Persian Kingdom The Grecian Kingdom if you think about the leopard such a fast uh animal and Alexander the Great leader of Greece he conquered the known World by the time he was 33. I'm not going to go into detail everyone to try to emphasize one point as we look at these different visions verse 7 after this I saw in the night visions and behold a fourth Beast Dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron teeth it devoured and break in pieces and stamped the residue at the feet of it and it was diverse it was different from all the beasts that were before it and it had ten horns just like the Beast that they're in Revelations everything also had ten horns but the destruction that this Beast brings is just total it seems now the interpretation of this and we find in verses 15 to 26 but um I'll kind of Hit the hit the bullet points in verse 19 that's emphasizing the last Kingdom will be this mysterious Kingdom will be of a different sort than the first three kingdoms as also in verse 23 another characteristic verses 21 and 25 is this last kingdom is going to make war with the Saints just like the Jezebel spirit did what's the last Kingdom also known for in verse 25 this is just interesting verse 25 he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the Saints of the most high and think to change times and laws and they'll be given unto him time times and the dividing of times and this idea of changing times and laws the calendar we got wasn't always the calendar we had Julius Caesar and before Christ he came up with a calendar it was a solar calendar based on 365 days a year in every fourth year a small correction that was the Julian calendar but the calculations were probably really cutting edge for that time period but as time went on it got off and you could see with the you could see with the solar and the uh the equinoxes of the spring and the in the winter it wasn't the summer and winter it wasn't quite it was changing and after a while it could be weeks and months different so over over 1600 years after Julius Caesar Pope Gregory the third comes up with a new calendar and he it's a minor changed how the leap year is calculated but that's how we got the grigorian calendar that we knew now now use got this man that comes into his heart to change times and laws and where does it come from it comes from this from the the head of the Catholic Church so this this is a this is a very mysterious Beast here he's coming up out of the sea and it's got a characteristic of a lion has a characteristic of a bear characteristic of of a leopard all combined into this fourth Beast with these ten ten horns very strong terrible notice also the references to the iron teeth now this is a the second time this kind of a vision comes up in the Book of Daniel where four kingdoms are prophesied the first time we see this kind of Prophecy coming forth is in Daniel chapter 2 after King nebuch and Nazar he wakes up in the middle of the night having had a terrible Nightmare and he uh he has all of the wise men his kingdom awakened as well and tells them if you can't interpret tell me my dream and interpret it it's off of all of your heads and all these wise men we can't do this it's going to be it's a bad they're having a bad night as well and Daniel gets the summons to come interpret this and he goes to prayer and says God I can't do it but my God can give the interpretation and God does let's see here up I'm off of course in Daniel chapter 2 and verse 40 um beforehand this is the image that Nebuchadnezzar is seeing the Dream It's a mighty image made of different composed of different Metals the head of gold which is the Babylonian Empire the uh the the chest of silver which is the medo Persians then you've got the um the thighs of brass which is as grease and as you go down you have legs of iron and then feet of iron mixed with clay and again this is this mysterious fourth Kingdom and we'll see some characteristics in this fourth Kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar's dreams are very similar to the fourth Beast that Daniel sees in Daniel 7 the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron and that is strong iron teeth of that fourth Beast of Daniel 7 was was emphasized it as iron breaks in pieces subdues all things as iron breaks all these shall it break in pieces the destruction of this fourth Beast this fourth power is going to be of of a catastrophic scale in both of these visions and whereas you saw the feet and Toes part of Potter's clay and part of iron this Kingdom will be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron that iron goes all the way through for as much as you saw the iron mixed with Miry clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken you saw the iron mixed with Mario Clay that will mingle themselves with the seed of men but they will not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay just wanted to take a look at the what those the the significance of the legs of of iron and the feet of iron and Clay because this is this is noteworthy the iron and Clay symbolize romanism Catholicism and protestantism mixed together and when brother Branham reads in verse 43 how they will mingle themselves to the seed of men he talks about Protestants and Catholics marrying one another and diluting uh their their the the true the the true Bible faith that way um and then at the end time the image that that Nebuchadnezzar sees is smitten in the toes this image there's this Nebuchadnezzar's dream there's a stone cut out of a mountain without hands and it goes hurtling through space and it doesn't strike the head it doesn't strike the chest doesn't strike the legs it strikes the feet it strikes the toes why is that significant oh it shows if you put if you were to lay the image on its side you'd have a horizontal timeline through history starting in Babylon ending up all the way until now and that destruction happens at the end time and they're in the toes as it were so brother Brandon underscores that that mixture of iron and Clay Protestant Catholicism being mixed together and then he's preaching the sermons on them the 70th week of Daniel in the early 1960s I think 1960 or 61. shortly before that um there's a there's a speech that takes place in the United Nations and you have Nikita Khrushchev from the Soviet Union he comes and visits the United States there's President Eisenhower um Eisenhower I think that German Bruce were for iron and whether Brandon points to these two men working together like this it points to where we are we're right in the right in the toes or the iron and the clay are mixed together and This Crew shops in the United Nations and he's giving a speech and to emphasize it he stands up and he just starts motion like this with his hand and here's the picture that that's taken well what does he have in his hand he has a shoe and brother Graham talks about this this is this is a crazy thing to do not ever any people get up and use their shoe as as their as their uh visual aid but Khrushchev does this and for the Ramses see what he's doing see what God's doing he's showing you we're living in the time of defeat we're living in a time of the toes pick it up this is the time where we're at and that is the time where we're at and but it's not everybody is looking oh it's communism it's communism we know God's using a world leader from a communist country to illustrate a point he's the communist leader people will listen to him but it's not communism brother Brandon points out in the talking about in the seven Church ages and there there was iron and clay in those toes and they wouldn't mix together Protestant Catholicism under the same Gentile domination and the handwriting on the wall and how in the Roman time they have two different churches among the Gentiles one would be Catholic one would be Protestant the iron of the Catholic church and the clay of the Protestant then the 70th week of Daniel this is about a year after uh khrushchev's Speech he says now notice here and here at the end of this age and Daniel 2 Daniel watched this image with great consideration he watched it until the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands it rolled down smote the image in the feet and broke that it never hit in the head now it was in their feet that was at the end time and then ten toes then in the on page five of the notes from the message restoration of the Bride tree brother Graham talks about those Tim ten toes run in every Kingdom Under the Earth he says there's an iron curtain communism there's a bamboo curtain of China and there's a purple curtain but don't you fear the rest of them but watch the purple curtain that's the one to to focus on so you see um we started with that that that the Jezebel upon the Beast and Rule and in Revelation 17 the Beast came up out of the sea it had ten horns and it was there was there was a description of it the matches very closely that Beast that comes up out of the water in Daniel 7 and there are some similar characteristics with this with this Vision this dream that Nebuchadnezzar had in Daniel 2. so now we're going to pick up another place where the same Beast that comes up out of the water with the ten horns or the seven heads we'll see another description of that in Revelation chapter 13. perhaps we can turn there verse one and they stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy this is the same Beast we saw in Daniel 7 and we see again in Revelation 17. and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth is the mouth of a lion these are this this is that same Beast described in Daniel 7. and the dragon gave him his power that's that same dragon that in Revelation 12 is trying to kill that man child the Christ child this dragon is the devil this is that old serpent this is his all he's been trying to pursue Christ see the Promise throughout time and now you have this Beast coming up and the dragon is anointing it the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the Beast and they worshiped the dragon as they watched the beasts wonder if they Beast they don't see the Dragon but the dragons anointing the Beast and they're giving wondering admiration to the beast but the dragon's the one receiving it they worshiped the Beast saying whose life unto the Beast who's able to make war with him it's what we see here in Revelation chapter 13 we see the same Beast coming up as the mouth of a lion the feet of a bear comes out of the sea it's like a leper the dragon's giving his power to receiving worship that's what the devil has always wanted to receive and we see the similar characteristics the Beast rising up the ten horns the same animal characteristics it's also interesting I saw one of its heads as it were wounded to death and this deadly wound was healed it seemed like it would have been a mortal wound this Beast would have been dead but it survives this symbol this description comes up one other time in Revelation 17 8 again it's the same Beast Revelation 13 Revelation 17 Daniel 7. verse 8 says the Beast that you saw was and it is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit go into Perdition they'd dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and the idea is and this is when papal Rome was destroyed by The Barbarians yet it was it was gone and it comes back into papal room this is the very same thing this is an amazing thing when such a power is papal whereas Pagan Rome was completely destroyed and then it comes back and this is ruling the world again how could that be it's anointed by a dragon and it's foretold so so so so so to happen so in Revelation 13 we see also um this is the same Beast like we said after in Revelation 13 we see two beasts the first Beast we just read about the one that comes up out of the sea that looks terrible Dreadful a diabolical yet still to be wondered at and even worshiped but in verse 11 of Revelation 13 John says I beheld another Beast this one doesn't come out of the sea it comes out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb this doesn't look diabolical this looks like a nice little lamb looks like a nice creature but he spake as a dragon appearances are deceiving and he exercises all the power of the first Beast before him and causes the Earth and then what's dwelder into worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed how was it successful you did all the world to worship the first Beast it looks innocent it looks all right but it speaks like that Dragon verse 15 it says he had power to give life under the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed again we have this this purging of someone who wants to do righteously that's that Jezebel spirit again it won't tolerate any dissent it's the it goes all the way through and then Verse 18 it says here is wisdom let him a hath understanding count the number of the Beast for it's the number of a man and his number is 603 score and six the dreaded six six six and it says in Revelation 13 if they uh won't be willing to take that Mark of the hand or in the forehead you won't be able to buy or sell anything like that I can remember back in the wonderful days of covid quarantines when you had to before somebody could come into the school I had to had to take this a thing look like a gun point at their head and take their temperature and they couldn't brother Wayne Lawson he comes and does Chapel message and he says and I I said brother can't take take your temperature real quick to assure the people say that this thing's checking the mark of the beast or something I mean people believed all kinds of things because you know we we think wow there's prophecy here we're going to be able to look out for things and I just want to one of the things I just kind of have learned from this particular study prophecy isn't given to us to function as a crystal ball or we look in it and say oh wow that's exactly how usually when the disciples tried to figure out what Jesus said is that we've got it they were wrong every time and I'd say probably when we Believers think I know exactly how it's going to come I know who's going to be the next president Hillary Clinton who as if she was running against I forget now um Hillary Clinton man brother Branson will be a strong woman it'll be her we've got all those predictions we have it all figured out didn't happen that way she's still not president and she's not in jail either but anyway um we prophecy isn't a crystal ball for us when we treat it like that we bring ourselves into error and create confusion what prophecy is it's interesting when people treat it that way it brings fear it brings conspiracy it brings anxiety that's not what prophecy is given for prophecy is given to give us rest so we can see after things have happened the disciples remembered oh yes Jesus told us about that prophecy brings rest we don't have to figure it out God interprets his own words by bringing it to pass and that we see that oh yes wonderful praise the Lord he was uncontrollable and I didn't even see it he's in control now prophecy helped us to learn to rest and relax at what God's doing so we have a message here in these three different things that we've seen so far we've seen in Daniel chapter 2 Nebuchadnezzar's dream is showing a mixture of Catholicism and protestantism as iron and Clay are mixed together and the feet and the toes of the fourth Kingdom we see the same thing emphasized in Daniel 7 Revelation 13 this beast and this image to the Beast and I didn't read a quote that I had I'm out of order about the image to the Beast and the resume of the ages the false Church groups will come together in a world Council of churches the World Council of churches is the image directed to the beast in Revelation chapter 13. what's wrong with unity what's wrong with churches coming together this is this little lamb that looks so innocent but when it's combined has this lamest two horns civil and ecclesiastical power when they're combined like that it can look so innocent but it can speak as a dragon that's this image to the Beast This World Council of churches now remember it was Imperial Pagan Rome that fell by the sword but she was healed of her Deathstroke when she joined to the nominal Christian Church of Rome and Incorporated paganism and Christianity and thereby came the Holy Roman Empire which was to endure until Jesus came and destroyed her but Rome is not going it alone her daughters are right with her and she will take over absolute Authority by the World Council of churches so that World Council of churches is the image to the Beast the underlying portion here this ecumenical move will end up with Rome at the head even though the people did not Envision it that way I've got a I don't have it in this presentation but I think four six years ago or so the pope met with various charismatic and Evangelical leaders and that this big picture together in the pope is talking about just all put our arms around us in Christian Brotherhood and they see that and he's smiling and when the pope gives you a hug I just feel like this is the false Vine tentacles trying to strangle us and and take all life away from us but that's that's the that's the spirit that's behind him even though it looks like that you're kind and gentle old man so you've got the second part the Beast and the image to the Beast and thirdly in Revelation 17 the great and the Harlot daughters the great is the Roman Catholic Church when the Catholic church when she starts having when um daughters come out of the mother they're in the birth process as people start leaving the Catholic church in the at the end of the Middle Ages in the Reformation there's a Lutheran Church that gets birthed and then there after the Wesleyan Church comes out different different with all kinds of nominee all kinds of little churches come out but they come out of the Harlem of of of of the great and they carry the same and and you don't always see it clearly but they carry the same spirit that athaliah had like mother like daughter and you can think about uh this is that this kind of boggled my mind when I when I thought about it but after England uh converted to protestantism so that Henry the eighth could marry again and again and again in hopes of getting a son that was the only reason he converted to protestantism but it had some good fruits there was an English Bible that came out of it the translations was it was a nice thing so technically the English church has left the Catholic Church but here you've got different groups within England the the separatists which we call the pilgrims the Puritans now you've got this Pro this so-called Protestant Church in England persecuting these people who won't tow the line of the king of England that's the same spirit that was upon the mother so these separatists in these Puritans they go over to Massachusetts and they establish a colony well after a while in Puritan Massachusetts comes a man named Roger Williams who doesn't always agree with the Puritan elders and they persecute him they boot him out of the colony and he has to go and he goes and found Rhode Island it's the same spirit that that's that that's persecuting Roger Williams wasn't born at the stake but he wasn't allowed to stay there in Massachusetts he wouldn't tow the line and there was a spirit that wasn't going to accept that and you can go along and see if you try to be in a Homeschool Group and won't sign a trinity pledge sorry you can be respectful as much as you want but you got to tell the line because they won't bring they want to accept any dissent from that may the Lord help us not to have that spirit gotten that order here again here I go just want to take a look at the some key pieces of the puzzle from these different scriptures this woman there are seven heads and seven mountains let's look at Revelation chapter 17 I believe this is yes Revelation 17 and verse 9 says it's the seven heads of the Beast are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth we want to find the interpretation of that also says um in the same chapter Revelation 17 the woman is that great city which rules over all the Earth all over the kings of the Earth in Revelation 13 we read Verse 18 the number of the Beast is number of man 666. well the seven heads are seven mountains um so I just kind of looked what kind of cities of the world are built on seven mountains or Seven Hills well there's a number of them Cincinnati Seattle they're all on Seven Hills or seven mountains in the Netherlands is Brussels Edinburgh Moscow is built on seven on seven hills and Rome Italy they're all there there are many cities who would qualify this but then the question is there's another qualification how many of these also rule over the kings of the Earth it doesn't not all of them will satisfy that Putin tries to make it so Moscow says you're the Third Rome but only Rome Italy can be said they do there are seven hills around there on Rome and world leaders try to get their picture taken with the Pope they they go there in the pool even says there's a secret mission going right now to Kiev to uh to to broker peace with the Russians I don't know if it'll work but here is a city on Seven Mountains there's influence over all kinds of world leaders it's there and then the number of the Beast is a number of a man and one of the titles of the pope is vicarius filiai day which means vicarious vicar or in the place of the son of God and I'm sure you've seen this before but if you take the the the the values of the Roman numerals vicariously the v's and one of five the eyes and I as C is a hundred this is where you when you're forced to learn Roman numerals kids this is where I kind of actually gets interesting Philly eye that's 50 and then day D is 500 you add these up 100 plus 1212 they have 53 you have 501 they have their 666. and that's uh that's met by that that's met by one man here and it's he's supposed to have it there on this crown on his miter 666 vicarious phillyi day now there is some the Catholic Church um used to say and say yes one of the titles of the pope is vicarious phillyi day they don't claim that anymore conveniently um the this title first appears in an 8th Century document called the Donation of Constantine in which the Vatican draws up this document and which they claim that emperor Constantine donated all of the land of Italy to the pope of course all that land that's it that's that's huge uh profits for the Pope the all the rents from the people living there everything is power they control the king's there and one of the titles of the Pope in here is the vicar of the son of God however um this document that came out hundreds of years later that the Vatican forged the document the nation of Constantine it was a forged document the Vatican Druid up to convince other kings other Frankish kings that they they donate their lands to the pope as well because he is the vicar of the son of God so sometimes people will say yeah the doctrine was forged which this title first comes up so it's not really the title of the Pope anyway however it was the it was the the lie about the donation of the land that was the LIE of the document but that he was called the Son of God everybody accepted that that wasn't uh that part wasn't a forgery at all and doesn't so that it was a forgery doesn't negate the significance of that title vicarious Philly I did actually attests that this was common teaching of the church because people would accept what that document said because this was the title that was already being used and up until the 1940s popes would use this title and even in in 1914 there is a a Catholic weekly called our Sunday visitor in November 15 1914 and here conveniently enough you cannot find this uh the copy of this particular there are a few universities you might have it on microfilm but you can't find they have the the Sunday visitor website has copies of all issues but there are some of 1914-1915 that are missing and this is one of them but the question here is is it true that the words of the Apocalypse in the 13th chapter uh 18 refer to the pope but here is wisdom 666. and this is what the answer was the Sunday visitor of the Roman Catholic Church is the title of the pope of Rome is vicarious phillyi day and this is inscribed on this miter and if you take the letters of the title which represent Latin numerals and add them together they come up to 666. the Catholic Church says this in 1914 end in 1915 they get the same question written in and this one is also not available on their website but there are a few places that put them on the microfilm and they're there if you go to look for them and here the the question is what are the letters supposed to be in the Pope's Crown what do they signify if anything and it says the letters inscribed in the Pope's might or these vicarious phillyi day which is Latin for Vicar of the son of God and then in 1941 the same magazine said that's been commonly stated that this is one of the titles of the Pope but it's not because if you add up six you add up the numerals of somebody's name you could take anybody's name and add them up and they might equal the 666 and that can be true however there are multiple qualities multiple stars to be aligned City on Seven Hills there were many of them only one of them rules over Kings of the Earth and then his number is also 666. you can say that this person or this person this person you got up their names I tried mine and maybe that I don't know um but yeah I don't live in a city that sits on Seven Hills so even if your name adds up to 666 that doesn't mean anything you have to have all these stars of Prophecy aligned together and they do with this pope of Rome so for me just interesting this the spirit of Jezebel the church ages it's it's a book of The Book of Revelation is a book of Prophecy and you see this the spirit of Jezebel referred back to alluded to in the Old Testament seeing the church ages and it keeps on going and going and going until at the very end John is seeing this woman she refused to repent and she got what she wanted she got all the power but her end let's take a look at Revelation chapter 17 and we'll see what her her end is and traversa after 17 verse 17 you have verse chapter 18 rather after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mildly with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is fallen and has become the habitation of devils so Babylon this was something in chapter 17 John looked at this woman and this beast and he wonders after with a great admiration it's an impressive thing she had her time when she was at when she was uh um and she seemed powerful and admirable even the problem even the Apostle John looked at her that way but in chapter eight and you see that's of the pleasures of Sinner for a season the promises the devil gives you there for a season because in chapter 18 Babylon Has Fallen and there'll be great judgment brought over her and that's the end that's the end of that of that particular spirit and then in Revelation 21 you see a new Heaven and a new Earth come down that's what's promised us that's what we have to wait upon and just like we read in at the end of last our sermon last month we've talked about thyatira it ends unto verse 24 chapter 2 under you I say unto the rest and thyatira I will not put upon you any other burden but that what you already have hold faster I come to overcome I think keepeth my Works to him will I give power over the Nations he'll rule them as the wrath of irons the vessels of Potter shall be broken the Shivers even as I've received of my father I'll give him the Morning Star there's a promise to the Overcomer even though even though this this this Powerful Beast seems to rule over all the Earth we hold on because there's a promise it'll be a morning star come and we will rule and reign with Christ but as I said what's the point we can try to figure all these details out we might have details wrong left and right but the point is God is in control he's been in control the entire time like it's not a crystal ball the disciples are told by Jesus that that they're going to Scourge the Messiah they'll put them to death and the third day he will rise again that seems to us very clear how could you not understand that but it says they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them neither neither knew they the things which were spoken John 12 16 these things understood not as Disciples of the first but when Jesus was glorified and then remembered they these things have been written of him God interprets his word by bringing it to pass if God said will do a thing when he does it that's the interpretation of it that's how we know what he meant God interprets his own word he does his own interpretation he doesn't need any Seminary or ministers me you no one else to interpret him he promised it he turns around he does it that settles it that interprets it so an incorrect crystal ball view of Prophecy encourages us to connect all the dots and explain everything it puts a great burden upon ourselves to figure everything out and we just get conspiracies anxiety the result is fear God is not the author of confusion God is the author of Peace he's not the author of conspiracy but a correct if you have prophecy lets us rest in the sovereignty of God we can hold fast till he come because he said he's going to come we can just wait for that amen enemy positions can come and we can pray Heavenly Father we just thank you so much as we look at all these different prophecies that you made in Millennia past and Lord we're just so thankful that we have our eyes of understanding have been enlightened just by your grace Lord that we can see what you were doing then we can see that you're still working and we're and we're waiting Lord for that time the morning Stars risen over waiting for that Rapture to come oh God we can meet you in the air oh Lord and we'll be able to my we can we can reign with you for a thousand years o God and then come down on Earth in this new heaven that's completely new heaven new Earth completely purged pure oh God what a wonderful thing there won't be any phones or social media or news feeds or anything there will be just a atmosphere an environment of your word we can worship you in the truth Lord father I just pray that you would help us to rest as we we can see the end time events coming around and we can try to figure out this or that but Lord let us just rest in your promise you're going to come we're your children you're not going to let us behind you're not going to leave us behind you're going to come and get us to oh God we're going to rest in that Lord I pray that you would help us to rest in you in the name of Jesus Christ a
