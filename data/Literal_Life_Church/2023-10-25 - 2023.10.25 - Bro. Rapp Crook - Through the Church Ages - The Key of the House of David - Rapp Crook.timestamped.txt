[20:23] we can open our Bibles to um uh to the
[20:27] Book of Revelation chapter 3 we'll just
[20:29] start
[20:31] there I was tucking my daughter on the L
[20:35] into bed last night and and said uh
[20:39] Papa's going to go and I got to go
[20:40] prepare for service tomorrow and she
[20:42] said Papa what you going to pray about
[20:43] what what are you going to preach about
[20:45] and um I said well I'm going to I'm
[20:47] going to talk about the key of the house
[20:49] uh the key about I'm going to talk about
[20:51] the key tomorrow at church and um her
[20:54] response kind of startled me it just
[20:56] kind of shows andage encourages us as
[20:58] parents there's a lot more going on than
[21:00] meets the eyes sometimes they pick up a
[21:02] lot more than you think should is it
[21:04] about the key of receiving the Holy
[21:06] Ghost wow somebody's been listening to
[21:08] what we've been preaching about here at
[21:10] church so um even when it uh looks like
[21:13] not a lot might be happening uh Lord's
[21:16] getting in there so be not we well doing
[21:20] we'll just uh start here the Book of
[21:21] Revelation chapter
[21:23] 3 and uh you're there but I'm not yet
[21:28] Revelation 3 and: 7 as where we're going
[21:30] to take our take our text we're going to
[21:32] start with the Philadelphian age this
[21:34] evening and to the angel of the church
[21:36] in Philadelphia write these things said
[21:39] he that is Holy he that is true he that
[21:43] hath the Key of David he that openeth
[21:45] and no man shutteth and shutteth and no
[21:48] man openeth and I want to focus
[21:51] especially on that those phrases um he
[21:54] is true and talking about the Key of
[21:57] David and then the opening and and no
[22:00] man shutting let's just pray Heavenly
[22:02] Father we thank you for your goodness
[22:04] and your grace to us Lord I Thank you
[22:05] for bringing us here together father we
[22:08] we take it easily for granted I think of
[22:10] the churches in Laos that we've seen
[22:12] pictures of just uh Believers Gathering
[22:15] uh on the dirt floors of of homes and
[22:19] having to take such uh trouble to get to
[22:21] smuggle materials in and out and and
[22:24] we've got U books uh all over our homes
[22:27] we don't have to
[22:28] to worry about them being safe Lord I
[22:30] Thank you for the freedoms that we have
[22:33] Lord I just pray that you would uh bless
[22:35] the service this evening you grant us a
[22:37] opener understanding oh God and that we
[22:39] might see more clearly your hand in our
[22:42] life and your plans for our life oh God
[22:44] in Jesus name amen you may be
[22:48] seated it's been a it's been a big month
[22:50] for the uh for the KK family I
[22:52] appreciated brother Paul giving us some
[22:54] flexibility just because we we moved to
[22:57] homes uh two weeks ago and um that's
[23:00] quite an undertaking uh moving from one
[23:02] place to another we just lived in the
[23:04] other place for for seven years but
[23:06] still in seven years time it's amazing
[23:08] how much stuff can aass so even if
[23:11] you're not moving you should play moving
[23:13] every few years it's just uh it make the
[23:16] experience easy somewhere down the road
[23:19] but uh want to do uh this CU we've been
[23:22] a month away uh almost a month and a
[23:25] half away from this going to take a few
[23:27] minutes kind of review what we had
[23:29] talked about uh in Sardis before we um
[23:32] head into the uh uh Philadelphian
[23:35] age um we we ended last time with the
[23:38] book of Sardis looking at the at the
[23:41] tree of life and uh uh sorry The Book of
[23:44] Life um but um Jesus speaks about the
[23:48] the the church ages in a very compact
[23:51] form in John 12 where he says except a
[23:54] corn of wheat fall into the ground and
[23:56] die it abides alone but if it if it does
[23:59] die it brings forth much fruit and this
[24:02] is the process that uh that the church
[24:05] has undergone during the church ages um
[24:09] there was a seed that was sown there in
[24:11] Jesus's uh Jesus's Ministry there in the
[24:13] day of Pentecost the seed was swn but
[24:16] then they had to go into the ground and
[24:18] die through the Dark Ages brother Braham
[24:20] says those Dark Ages that the age of
[24:22] that perrian age that was the age of the
[24:24] open door for the Antichrist he was
[24:27] injecting his Much Death as he could
[24:29] into the church but that seed uh
[24:33] um died there in the ground so that it
[24:35] could bring forth new life and that's
[24:38] what began to happen in the sardian age
[24:40] under Martin Luther and it continues in
[24:43] the Philadelphian age we talked in the
[24:46] previous weeks about the book of life
[24:48] and it can be hard to understand God's
[24:51] election we kind of looked at the
[24:52] election is uh everybody standing up on
[24:55] the end line being team be having teams
[24:57] be picked and that just is something
[24:59] that's that's an idea that just is very
[25:01] repulsive to us especially if we'd ever
[25:02] been the last one picked before but
[25:05] election isn't a matter of God picking
[25:08] us or US choosing God that's not the
[25:11] right picture of election election
[25:13] doesn't have to do with with with with
[25:16] picking or choosing in that way election
[25:19] instead is kind of taught in Jesus's
[25:22] Parable in Matthew Chapter 13 where a SE
[25:25] Goes Forth to se and he knows what he
[25:28] wants to uh he's already been to the
[25:30] store he been to the barn he's gotten
[25:31] the seeds he wants to be planted that's
[25:33] what he's going to be have growing in
[25:35] this field and that's what he that's
[25:37] what he
[25:37] SWS however after him comes this enemy
[25:41] who SWS all the the dandelions and the
[25:43] weeds in the field so it's not that God
[25:46] goes and looks at the field and I'm
[25:48] going to choose that plant there I'm
[25:49] going to choose that plant I'm going to
[25:51] choose that plant it's not based on how
[25:53] good the plant's done it based on what
[25:55] kind of plant it is and so election is
[25:59] not a matter of picking and choosing
[26:01] it's a matter of identity and that just
[26:05] uh that just takes the whole picking and
[26:07] choosing out of it's God has uh before
[26:10] the foundation of the world he's that
[26:12] sewer who went forth to seow he SED his
[26:15] good seed and then the enemy goes after
[26:17] that but um brother brandom says that we
[26:20] have to be careful and see this it's not
[26:22] the person that comes eternally
[26:24] predestinated from God it's the word or
[26:27] the seed it's not that oh my this
[26:29] particular brother this particular
[26:30] sister they are just so good God says Ah
[26:33] because they're so good I'm going to
[26:34] predestinate them it's not in that way
[26:38] it's it's the word of the seed inside of
[26:39] them and then you know our body is just
[26:42] made of Flesh and as we're that that
[26:44] that seed's there and we're being made
[26:46] we're just the we're just the flesh
[26:48] that's around the most precious thing
[26:50] the seed of God there on the
[26:52] inside so it's that word or the seed and
[26:56] we going to want to bring this back to
[26:58] the book of life because he says the
[27:00] record of this wheat plant it goes into
[27:03] the ground it dies and then it goes on
[27:07] through out through all the church ages
[27:09] going through uh tassel form going
[27:11] through stalk form going all the way up
[27:13] to shock till it reproduces weed seed
[27:17] the wheat there at the end all that
[27:19] story of the wheat plant that record of
[27:21] the wheat plant that is The Book of Life
[27:24] and like we saw last time God is so so
[27:27] gracious even at the great white Throne
[27:30] judgment were people who had never come
[27:33] to faith in God but have they've done
[27:35] good things to that wheat plant if
[27:37] they've been gracious to God's children
[27:39] wow it's just like how we would respond
[27:41] if some as our as our kid goes to school
[27:44] for the first time anybody who's kind to
[27:45] our kid we're going to be we're going to
[27:48] be so happy and gracious to them as well
[27:50] as any anything that seems to be
[27:52] involved with the growth of this wheat
[27:54] plant in some way has some part of the
[27:56] story and God includes them in his book
[28:00] of book book of life there at the end so
[28:04] this corn of wheat it falls on the
[28:06] ground and dies brother Brandon preaches
[28:08] this in a couple different messages um
[28:10] he starts preaching it I think mainly in
[28:13] um that message the sea is not air with
[28:15] the shock and um that's um that that's a
[28:19] good one to to listen to but here's a
[28:21] kind of a nice compact form of it in the
[28:23] Rapture message the corn of wheat fell
[28:25] on the ground and died under the dark
[28:27] age persecution it went into the ground
[28:29] and it had to die because unless that
[28:31] seed dies in rots it abides alone you
[28:34] can keep that seed on your shelf it's a
[28:36] nice seed but it'll stay by itself until
[28:38] it actually gets planted in rots and
[28:40] laid there in the ground and rotted and
[28:43] the devil seems like he's he's won the
[28:45] day there in the Dark Ages but then come
[28:47] forth in two little blades of the
[28:49] Lutheran church now the Lutheran Church
[28:52] brought off more blades zwingle and so
[28:55] forth and then the light life was there
[28:57] in that seed but then that that the life
[29:00] leaves the seed and it's going up
[29:02] through the now the the the stalk is
[29:04] coming out with with with Luther wingly
[29:07] and so forth and from that on up it
[29:09] comes into the tassel as that life keeps
[29:12] on going up you have to continue hearing
[29:15] what the spirit is saying unto the
[29:17] churches walking in the light of the day
[29:19] because the life that was once there in
[29:21] The Roots has now gone further and it
[29:24] keeps on going further so that life goes
[29:26] on up into the tassel which was John
[29:28] Wesley the great missionary age then it
[29:31] dropped back out of there come that
[29:32] deceiving age that Pentecostal age it's
[29:34] gone further and that Pentecostal age
[29:37] that that that that shuck that's just
[29:39] right around the that that that germ of
[29:42] wheat that's going to be reproducing
[29:43] itself it's right around that and it
[29:44] looks really close but the point of the
[29:47] of that sermon is the Shu and the seed
[29:49] are not airs together the seed keeps
[29:52] going forth and it goes off to obtain
[29:54] its inheritance and it leaves the Shu
[29:56] behind because the shock isn't willing
[29:58] to go on before that so the shock is not
[30:00] air with that uh with that wheat seed
[30:04] the life that comes up through through
[30:06] Luther was that was what was what made
[30:08] Wesley the life that come out of Wesley
[30:10] is what made Pentecost the life that
[30:12] comes out of Pentecost makes the wheat
[30:14] but each one of them are just
[30:16] carriers that's why we can't focus just
[30:19] on Luther we can't focus on Wesley we
[30:21] can't focus just on brother Brandon
[30:23] because they're carriers of Life
[30:25] bringing us further want to keep on
[30:27] walking into what God is doing today the
[30:29] real life goes on through there and
[30:33] that's what God has done in each and
[30:35] every age and the shock has to be there
[30:38] to shelter it all these things that God
[30:40] has done in previous ages they've been
[30:42] necessary to to carry that life on
[30:44] through and we can look at that even in
[30:46] our own lives why did we have to take
[30:50] the path that we've taken in life it's
[30:52] it can be hard to understand sometimes
[30:54] but God has Us in some places for a time
[30:56] because it's kind of sheltered us I was
[30:58] talking to the uh um brother gusta from
[31:01] from Germany who was here this past week
[31:03] and we know some we have mutual friends
[31:06] in in Eastern Europe and he was talking
[31:08] about this one particular Church who who
[31:10] seem to kind of there's one brother
[31:12] leading the church kind of a caretaker
[31:14] wanted them to stay in the Thunders
[31:15] movement for a while and they stayed
[31:17] there and they really couldn't
[31:20] understand why we're doing this because
[31:21] really Church wasn't growing or anything
[31:24] but it was almost because they weren't
[31:25] getting in fellowship with other areas
[31:27] was almost God had them under quarantine
[31:29] because some of the other churches in
[31:31] the area that seem like really good ones
[31:32] they've since gone
[31:34] off but God kind of preserves them and
[31:38] now the other influen is they've not
[31:40] been under that so it can be hard to
[31:42] understand why is God dealt with us the
[31:44] way he has hey we don't have to worry
[31:47] about that's God's baby he's going to
[31:48] take care of us he'll shelter us
[31:51] throughout the way and he'll bring us
[31:52] through the life goes right out of that
[31:55] shuck right into the wheat that's the
[31:56] way each just done and that's how it
[31:58] worked with us personally as well God
[32:00] sheltered us he has his own path for us
[32:03] and we can just rest in that so as we
[32:07] look now this evening at uh the
[32:09] Philadelphian age this is uh this is I
[32:12] think starts in 1750 it's a long age
[32:15] goes all the way up to I think uh early
[32:18] 1900s I think 1906 I think in the zeusa
[32:21] street to happen that's it's it's a
[32:23] longer age and it's interesting age to
[32:26] look at because this is something that
[32:27] we cover in our history books quite a
[32:29] bit have the Industrial Revolution
[32:31] that's happening in this time period the
[32:33] American Revolution you've got all kinds
[32:36] of interesting things going on and
[32:38] spiritually there's a lot going on as
[32:40] well the when we talk about in
[32:43] Revelation
[32:45] 3:7 these things say he that is Holy he
[32:48] that's true he that ha the key of David
[32:51] when emphas brother Brandon emphasizes
[32:52] this word true as being it's a special
[32:56] word it doesn't mean God's true in the
[32:58] sense that he's not false that he's not
[33:00] being a liar it it means something more
[33:03] than that has he a sense of um being
[33:05] complete perfect as brother Bram uses
[33:09] these phrases talk about perfect
[33:10] realization or or partial
[33:14] realization he says this word true is a
[33:16] very wonderful word it does not mean
[33:18] true just in the sense it's opposite to
[33:20] false it expresses the perfect
[33:23] realization of idea as contrasted with
[33:26] its partial realization and now we can
[33:29] understand he says as never before
[33:31] antitype what happened in the Old
[33:33] Testament contested with type and
[33:35] substance with Shadow and that's kind of
[33:39] what I wanted Lord willing will bring
[33:41] out this evening um looking at the idea
[33:43] of the substance is greater than the
[33:46] Shadow and I I kind of uh express it
[33:49] this way we all uh can have fun with
[33:52] shadows kids will play make little
[33:54] animals there on the wall different
[33:55] things like that well even cats will
[33:57] play with their Shadows it looks like a
[33:59] shadow this cat's been lonely this
[34:01] kitten's been lonely once a playmate and
[34:03] it'll play entain itself quite a while
[34:06] with its shadow but you know what when
[34:09] that cat needs some comfort or something
[34:10] that shadow is not going to come out and
[34:12] embrace it uh that Shadows not the cat
[34:16] and uh we can enjoy shadows in the Old
[34:18] Testament we can enjoy the shadows of
[34:20] things this life is just a shadow of a
[34:24] real life beyond so we can when we're
[34:27] enjoying this life we're kind of like
[34:29] the kitten playing with its shadow we
[34:32] want to press past the Shadow and get to
[34:35] the get to the
[34:36] substance brother Brandon talks about
[34:38] types and shadows the things that
[34:40] happened in the Old Testament the
[34:42] stories that play out they're more than
[34:44] just stories like we've talked about the
[34:46] book of the story of Joseph and we can
[34:49] tell the story of Joseph it's a
[34:50] beautiful story but then when you see
[34:52] the parallels that are packed into that
[34:55] with uh with Jesus Christ even prophetic
[34:58] here to the end times it's more than a
[34:59] story or like King David as he's as he's
[35:04] as he's the as he's been re re rejected
[35:06] by his people by his own son even he's
[35:08] he's leaving and then this shimy is is
[35:12] abusing him throwing things at him and
[35:14] um saying all kinds of terrible things
[35:15] at him David doesn't realize what's
[35:18] happening but he is actually
[35:20] demonstrating in tight form and
[35:22] illustration what's going to happen to
[35:25] Christ later and so he's bearing the
[35:28] reproach of Christ before Christ is even
[35:30] there because he's he's standing as
[35:32] loyal as he can to his poster Duty and
[35:35] he's he's showing us how how how Christ
[35:38] suffered as a rejected King but we say
[35:41] that the substance is greater than the
[35:43] shadow we can look at the shadows in
[35:46] these Old Testament Bible stories and
[35:48] they're just they're they're they're
[35:50] they're amazing they're powerful they're
[35:53] meaningful but when we look at the at
[35:56] the type is that is that powerful just
[35:59] how much greater must the must the must
[36:02] the substance be that's right so I want
[36:04] to look this evening at uh where this
[36:07] phrase the Key of David comes from where
[36:10] the phrase um he that openeth and no man
[36:13] shutteth and shut and no man openeth
[36:16] where those come from because they come
[36:18] from the Old Testament John um he's
[36:22] Jesus is speaking this to John and Jesus
[36:24] is speaking words that he had spoken
[36:27] to Isaiah the prophet hundreds of years
[36:30] earlier and that was the
[36:33] Shadow and now in the church ages it's
[36:36] being quoted again the substance is
[36:38] coming so we're going to take a look how
[36:40] the shadow played out and we'll lay it
[36:43] right on top and see how the substance
[36:45] will be playing out has played out and
[36:48] is still playing out that's kind of what
[36:50] we're looking at this
[36:52] evening um on page one of the notes just
[36:54] kind of want to delve a little more
[36:56] deeply into this idea of the partial
[36:58] realization versus the perfect
[37:01] realization again brother bam says about
[37:04] true is not just opposite the false it's
[37:06] perfect as opposed to to partial in the
[37:10] Bible perfect doesn't mean faultless
[37:12] perf mean complete
[37:15] mature um so he brother brand gives a
[37:18] couple of examples in the church age
[37:20] book Moses didn't give that bread from
[37:22] Heaven Jesus says but my father giveth
[37:24] you the true bread from heaven
[37:27] now the Mana was bread from heaven but
[37:30] as great as that was as satisfying as
[37:32] that was to the children of Israel there
[37:34] on their Wilderness Journeys Christ is
[37:37] so much more
[37:39] satisfying the the man was like play
[37:42] things like the shadow was to the kitty
[37:44] cat but when Christ comes down his life
[37:48] that is that is
[37:49] substance Jesus says I am the true vine
[37:54] when we look at talk about true and
[37:55] false Vines in the church ages that's
[37:58] also very
[38:00] meaningful um Hebrews chapter 9 Christ
[38:03] has not entered into the holy places
[38:05] made with hands which are the figures of
[38:08] the true all the temple worship all the
[38:11] the the instruments that were used there
[38:12] the pieces of furniture that were used
[38:14] there those were just Shadows pointing
[38:17] to what was coming so if you walk into
[38:19] the temple you can see as you walk in
[38:22] you've got the the the the Laver the
[38:25] Brazen Altar and you walk in the Holy
[38:27] the holy place the position of all the
[38:29] furniture if you look at it from above
[38:31] it's in the shape of a cross yeah that's
[38:34] a shadow but my the substance of the
[38:37] Cross when Jesus dies on it oh that's
[38:40] even more meaningful so it's example of
[38:43] partial as opposed to perfect
[38:45] realization and in 1 John
[38:48] 2:8 um the word speaks because the
[38:51] darkness is passed the True Light can
[38:54] now shine so again it's true in the
[38:57] sense it is mature it is uh it is
[39:02] full so we can look in Hebrews chapter 9
[39:05] we've got the all the sacrifices of the
[39:07] Old
[39:08] Testament that is the the way that God
[39:11] made for his people at that time and
[39:14] he's and he and he's teaching them about
[39:16] what Redemption is I like to think of it
[39:18] all the Old Testament is showing us that
[39:21] God is a Hands-On teacher the priests
[39:23] aren't just telling the people what to
[39:25] do but as they're as they're going
[39:27] through all the feast as they're
[39:28] offering the sacrifices everything that
[39:31] they're doing has has much greater
[39:34] meaning as a symbolic value and because
[39:37] they're participating at the idea is
[39:38] when you're Hands-On learning it'll
[39:40] stick better than if you just if just if
[39:43] if you just have to repeat the lesson
[39:44] and write it down on a piece of paper
[39:46] but that's what the point was of the Old
[39:49] Testament sacrifices there's um Christ
[39:52] was a high priest of good things that
[39:54] come with a greater and more perfect
[39:57] Tabernacle the Tabernacle was wonderful
[39:59] the temple was wonderful but there was a
[40:01] greater and more perfect Tabernacle that
[40:03] that was true and that was mature that
[40:04] was complete the blood of bulls and
[40:07] calves that was what God gave at that
[40:09] time but he comes later with his own
[40:11] blood to make not a temporary Redemption
[40:14] that just covers the sin for a while but
[40:17] an eternal Redemption that completely
[40:19] settles the question and it's important
[40:22] to have this this understanding of of
[40:25] Christ as the as he's he's faithful and
[40:28] holy and true with the mature truth and
[40:31] not just a partial
[40:33] realization because if we look at things
[40:35] with just a a partial life not a full
[40:38] understanding of it then someone might
[40:40] be very grateful to have Jesus in their
[40:42] lives because we all need Jesus's help
[40:45] and that can sound really good think we
[40:47] just need Jesus's help and but we need a
[40:50] lot more than just help Jesus isn't here
[40:54] to to help us he's here to to completely
[40:57] redeem us and Wesley uh um his uh well
[41:03] well he was in uh um at Oxford he and
[41:06] the group of young men that he was
[41:08] teaching with and praying with and
[41:10] studying with um they got this nickname
[41:13] of of methodists because they had a
[41:15] method for everything a method to become
[41:17] to become holy and Wesley understood the
[41:20] grace of God he he leaned upon the grace
[41:22] of God but a movement came up after him
[41:26] called called arminianism which
[41:28] emphasizes the importance of of of of
[41:30] human works in the in in the Salvation
[41:33] mix and if you don't grasp the
[41:37] reality of Jesus Christ is true he's the
[41:40] full realization not just a partial he's
[41:43] he's he's the full if we don't grasp
[41:45] that we will be leaning in some way upon
[41:48] our works and Christ is saying at this
[41:52] as he's as he's greeting the church in
[41:53] Philadelphia he says I am I am he that
[41:55] is Holy he that is true I am complete
[41:59] your works are incomplete what can we
[42:01] what can we hang our hat on what can we
[42:03] hang our life upon we can't hang our
[42:05] life upon our own works there only one
[42:08] thing we can do that's hang our life on
[42:10] Jesus Christ but a lot of modern
[42:13] theology talks about how Jesus helps us
[42:17] I remember some years back um as a uh
[42:20] some of the um really nice books you can
[42:22] get at the Christian bookstore they tell
[42:25] really nice stor
[42:26] to your kids but I was as as I was
[42:30] reading it it was talking about how
[42:31] Christ can help us we can take our
[42:32] problems to Jesus and he can he and he
[42:35] can help us fix our problems and things
[42:37] like that but there was no place in this
[42:39] really nicely illustrated book and
[42:41] everything there was no place it talked
[42:43] about Sin the necessity of repentance it
[42:46] was a really nice story but it was all
[42:48] about Jesus helping us and the song that
[42:54] the modernists would sing is Jesus p La
[42:57] apart and I apart you know we can work
[43:00] together Jesus and I we can make things
[43:02] better we see that sin leaves a little
[43:05] stain in our lives yet we washed it wide
[43:07] as snow this is not the gospel this is
[43:10] almost an Armenian kind of gospel where
[43:12] we have to work together with God but
[43:15] that's not that's not the true gospel
[43:17] brother Brandon talks about this in the
[43:18] church age book that it's not your works
[43:20] at all we don't have we we we don't play
[43:23] a part in this but the true gospel is
[43:25] not that Jesus helps us it's that he
[43:27] saves us he didn't come to make us
[43:29] better he came to resurrect us cuz we
[43:32] were dead in our sins you can't make a
[43:34] dead man better I mean the Undertaker
[43:36] tries to but he has a pretty bad job of
[43:39] it but Christ came to resurrect us we
[43:42] were dead in sins he has to Quicken us
[43:44] we're saved by him not of ourselves it's
[43:48] not of works we are his workmanship we
[43:51] don't have a dog in the fight we're just
[43:54] here Lord save me and and that's and
[43:56] that's the beauty of it and uh when we
[44:00] when we look at Christ being the reality
[44:03] brother Bram says here in the quote at
[44:04] the bottom of page one this age began
[44:07] the years of arminianism that do that
[44:09] does not believe in Christ as the
[44:12] reality it doesn't sing of Nothing but
[44:13] the Blood it sings of nothing but the
[44:15] blood and my own conduct as long as part
[44:19] of our Salvation depends upon our own
[44:21] conduct we're going to have very fitful
[44:23] walk now he I do believe in God Good
[44:26] Conduct if you are saved you will do
[44:28] righteously we've gone over that but let
[44:29] me tell you salvation is not Jesus plus
[44:33] it's Jesus alone salvation is of the
[44:35] Lord from start to finish it is all all
[44:38] of God let his life be in me let it be
[44:42] his blood that cleanses me his spirit
[44:44] that fills me his word in my heart and
[44:47] mouth his stripes that F fill me Heal me
[44:51] Jesus and Jesus alone not by works of
[44:53] righteousness which I have done no sir
[44:55] Christ is my life life
[44:57] amen that's a that's a big part of this
[45:00] message
[45:02] here but um as as we kind of move
[45:07] further in looking at the substance is
[45:10] is greater than
[45:12] Shadow when when Christ speaks to John
[45:15] the Beloved about the Philadelphian
[45:17] church he speaks about this key of David
[45:20] that opens any door and brother brandom
[45:23] alludes to the same prophecy here I
[45:26] wasn't the one that discovered it but
[45:27] he's he's alluding to a prophecy from
[45:29] Isaiah CH
[45:31] 22 and this also lets us look at partial
[45:35] and perfect realizations up close
[45:38] because Isaiah 22 that's the type and
[45:41] the story that unfolds there and in
[45:43] later chapters we we'll look at that
[45:46] that's in miniature that illustrates
[45:47] something that will be even greater
[45:50] later on the substance that happens in
[45:53] the Philadelphian age and then also
[45:55] Beyond
[45:56] but the characters in Isaiah
[45:58] 22 will be they reappear later in the
[46:01] story and want to take a look how um
[46:04] they they're going to illustrate the
[46:06] truth brother bam talks about there are
[46:07] two spirits in the framework of the true
[46:09] church it's been the way all the way
[46:12] since Ephesus and these two Vines just
[46:14] keep wrapping themselves around the tree
[46:16] all the way up until the end that's why
[46:19] later on in Revelation three in the
[46:21] message to the Philadelphian church he
[46:23] says I'm going to make them of the
[46:24] synagogue of Satan which say they are
[46:27] Jews and are not but do lie still here
[46:30] in Philadelphia they're going to be
[46:31] people who are identifying themselves
[46:33] with the true church saying that we're
[46:36] we're part but God says no you're not a
[46:38] you're not a part you are the synagogue
[46:40] of Satan they say we're we're Jews
[46:42] because that's they would have been the
[46:44] Jews would have been the first first
[46:46] Christians would have been been Jewish
[46:47] believers they were're we're we we're
[46:50] Jews we are right he says no you're not
[46:52] you're you're lying about that so the
[46:54] these two Vines are continuing and we
[46:57] can remember this this happens all the
[46:59] way through scripture Lucifer versus
[47:01] Michael these two twins battling and out
[47:04] in heaven that and that and that battle
[47:05] goes on continues down with Cain and
[47:07] Abel they're on the garden they're
[47:09] outside of the Garden of Eden lot versus
[47:11] Abraham ishmail versus Isaac these two
[47:15] as soon as God started to do something
[47:17] Satan's right there very quickly to try
[47:19] to badet Esau and Jacob Kora and Moses
[47:23] Moab under the ministry of balum versus
[47:25] Israel and then we'll look at this sheb
[47:27] and eliakim this evening Judah versus
[47:30] Jesus we'll look at this one tonight but
[47:32] it's all kind of pointing up unto this
[47:35] this this the these twins that are
[47:36] battling even still today at this very
[47:39] end time the Antichrist Spirit against
[47:42] the work of the Holy Spirit even now and
[47:46] and uh Revelation chapter 3 talks about
[47:49] in verse 10 you've kept the word of my
[47:52] patience I will keep you from the hour
[47:54] of Temptation when this Antichrist
[47:57] spirit is going be looking so much like
[47:59] the real but the promise here you've
[48:01] kept the word of my patience I will keep
[48:03] you as well from the hour of Temptation
[48:07] that's what we'll be looking at so we'll
[48:09] look at the the um shadow in the
[48:11] substance here we we we've quoted
[48:13] Revelation 3:7 a couple times now Heath
[48:16] at the Key of David and I want to
[48:17] compare it to the scripture in Isaiah 22
[48:20] before we go and look at it further
[48:23] Isaiah 22:22 and the key of the house of
[48:25] D will I lay upon his shoulder so he
[48:27] shall open and None Shall shut and he
[48:30] shall shut and None Shall open that
[48:33] sounds pretty close to Revelation CH 3:7
[48:36] so we're going to go back and dive into
[48:38] the story that unfolds there so that we
[48:41] can see better um what um what what
[48:45] Christ is meaning here to the
[48:47] philadelphians so these two Spirits are
[48:50] are battling they've been doing that the
[48:52] whole time now they're getting ready to
[48:53] Duke it out and um I Isaiah in the book
[48:56] of Isaiah and the passages in 2 Kings
[48:59] will be think chapters 18 and
[49:01] 19 the background here is that um
[49:05] Hezekiah he becomes king uh when he was
[49:08] just 25 years old and you could remember
[49:12] um hezek um sorry I got my stories mixed
[49:16] up Hezekiah King 25 years old his father
[49:19] was an evil King ahaz he did not have
[49:22] much uh to go on as far as his his
[49:25] natural Tree of Life his natural
[49:27] genealogy goes he had to separate from a
[49:30] lot he didn't have a good inheritance
[49:31] from his father
[49:33] ahaz um Hezekiah he leads a remarkable
[49:37] Reformation there in the in is in in in
[49:41] Judah repentance um he leads an amazing
[49:45] uh um U Passover I think it had been
[49:48] thousands of uh of cattle are actually
[49:51] offered as part of these sacrifices just
[49:53] the greatest Passover I think that been
[49:54] been been uh celebrated in hundreds of
[49:57] years it's just he he does some
[49:59] remarkable things here he even attempts
[50:02] to he's attempting to purge the nation
[50:03] of idolatry he's doing things in the
[50:05] spiritual front he's also preparing his
[50:08] National defenses the the Bible talks
[50:10] about how even um introduced new systems
[50:13] of wells and aqueducts to prepare the
[50:15] cities in case there seizures would
[50:18] would would
[50:19] come well two of the men who work with
[50:22] Isaiah with with Hezekiah then were men
[50:26] named shebna and eliakim maybe we could
[50:29] just turn over to Isaiah chapter 22 as
[50:32] we catch the
[50:35] background I've got some of this on the
[50:37] slide but not all of
[50:50] it so Isaiah um is prophesying now to
[50:54] Hezekiah I believe in verse
[50:57] 15 thus sayth the Lord God of hosts go
[51:01] get thee un this treasure even unto
[51:03] shebna which is over the house and say
[51:07] it's important she's position right now
[51:09] he is over the entire house he's the
[51:12] he's the treasur it's a position of of
[51:14] great
[51:16] responsibility verse 16 what have you
[51:19] here and who H and whom hast thou here
[51:22] that thou Hast hewed thee out of Seiler
[51:25] here is he that Heth him out of the
[51:26] Seiler on high and that graveth in
[51:28] habitation for himself in a rock it
[51:32] seems like a strange thing for Isaiah
[51:34] the prophet to be speaking to this
[51:35] treasur but what it's pointing to is
[51:38] shebna has not been doing his work very
[51:41] Faithfully as the treasur how is he able
[51:44] to afford this beautiful uh Seiler it's
[51:49] not really easy to to hide all of his
[51:51] money um he didn't have didn't have
[51:54] Bitcoin and things then so he's
[51:55] investing it and he's giving this this
[51:58] this this beautiful Seiler this this
[52:00] this real estate he's abusing his power
[52:04] and God's calling him out on it because
[52:06] Hezekiah is going to need Faithful Men
[52:09] around him shebna is not a faithful man
[52:13] and this is what Hezekiah is going to be
[52:15] Isaiah is going to be talking about
[52:16] remember there are two spirits in the
[52:18] framework of the true church and right
[52:20] now Hezekiah has somebody who's probably
[52:23] of the wrong Spirit at his right hand
[52:26] overseeing everything a little bit like
[52:28] Judas and Jesus Judas was the treasure
[52:31] he was overseeing things for Christ and
[52:33] ultimately betrayed him and shebna is is
[52:37] of a similar
[52:39] ilk so he says um behold the Lord will
[52:42] carry you away with a mighty captivity
[52:44] and he will surely cover you shebna
[52:46] you're planning on staying here and
[52:48] having a good life here in Jerusalem
[52:50] you're planning all the way out into the
[52:52] future you will have a great uh a great
[52:55] tomb you have great uh things engraved
[52:57] and stoned about you you think you're
[52:58] going to end your life here I've got
[53:00] different plans for you the Lord will
[53:02] carry you away with a mighty captivity
[53:05] he will surely cover thee he will surely
[53:07] violently turn and toss thee like a ball
[53:11] into a large country and there shalt
[53:14] thou die there the Chariots of thy Glory
[53:17] shall be the shame of thy Lord's house
[53:21] and I will drive thee from thy station
[53:23] and from thy State shall he pull thee
[53:24] down
[53:26] so everything that shb has been
[53:27] investing in here in Jerusalem God says
[53:29] it's for nothing because you are all
[53:32] going into captivity I'm going to make
[53:33] sure you go there too and you're going
[53:36] to die there anybody you you've been
[53:38] enriching yourself out of Hezekiah out
[53:41] of my own house perhaps even and I'm
[53:44] going to make sure you pay for it and
[53:46] then he goes on and it shall come to
[53:48] pass in that day that I will call my
[53:51] servant eliakim the son of hilk and I
[53:55] think it's interesting to even look at
[53:56] the names she's name um just means Vigor
[54:02] and a lot of people can do jobs with
[54:04] Vigor but um I kind of think about it as
[54:08] sheb had his Zeal but not according to
[54:10] knowledge he was he was vigorous for for
[54:12] his own work but eliakim means god
[54:15] raises God sets up eliakim had his
[54:19] strength through his in his through his
[54:20] position God positioned him there and
[54:23] God uh and God strength stred him and
[54:25] blessed him there and it is thought that
[54:28] shebna was a gentile serving in the
[54:31] court of Jerusalem because his name
[54:33] isn't a Hebrew name and there's no
[54:35] genealogy given usually when Hebrew
[54:38] names are given in the Bible you'll say
[54:40] so and so the son of so and so the son
[54:41] of so and so and it's just Sheva comes
[54:44] out of nowhere so it's thought he might
[54:46] be this Gentile serving there how we got
[54:49] there isn't known but um perhaps it was
[54:52] in the reign of ahaz hezekiah's father
[54:55] but he was obviously not a true servant
[54:57] because he was mainly concerned about
[54:59] enriching himself but eliakim he's going
[55:02] to be of a different kind entirely God
[55:05] raises him up and verse and and and this
[55:08] is remember this is when we talk about
[55:09] the eliakim and shebna this is just a
[55:12] partial realization of what's going to
[55:14] come this is just the shadow so if God
[55:17] is faithful in the
[55:19] shadow how much more is God faithful in
[55:23] the substance if we see God's
[55:25] faithfulness in these Bible stories how
[55:28] much more is God faithful when it comes
[55:30] to our lives when it comes to the the
[55:33] great time of Temptation is going to
[55:35] come we don't have to worry about God
[55:37] being faithful in the future he's
[55:39] faithful to us now he was faithful to us
[55:41] then substance is greater than
[55:47] Shadow so verse
[55:49] 21 my servant Eliah him I will clothe
[55:52] him with thy robe and strengthen him
[55:54] with thy gir and I will commit thy
[55:56] government into his hand and he shall be
[55:58] a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[56:01] and to the house of Judah and the key of
[56:03] the House of David will I lay upon his
[56:06] shoulder so he shall open and None Shall
[56:08] shut and he shall shut and None Shall
[56:11] open and I will fasten him as a nail in
[56:15] a sure place and he shall be for a
[56:17] glorious Throne to his father's
[56:21] house I really like verse 23 it it comes
[56:26] up a couple times in the Bible a nail in
[56:29] a sure Place how can we look at how can
[56:31] a nail be speaking of even of of of of
[56:35] Christ but um I can remember one time we
[56:39] had a nail in a sure place is a very
[56:41] important thing I remember one time when
[56:44] we lived in the Netherlands um we
[56:46] invited my in-laws over for dinner and
[56:48] we were all at the kitchen table
[56:50] together having a nice uh nice
[56:52] homecooked meal for my wife and in the
[56:55] middle of the meal there's this crash
[56:58] that happens behind us we all look
[56:59] behind us and this big mirror that had
[57:02] been hung on the wall crashed to the
[57:06] ground the nail had not been set in a
[57:09] sure place because probably my wife had
[57:11] been asking me for weeks honey could you
[57:13] please hang this up for me could you
[57:14] please hang this up for me could you
[57:15] pleas hang this up for me so I didn't
[57:18] grab the hammer one night I was away and
[57:20] she grabbed the hammer and she just
[57:22] packed it up there she likes to hang
[57:24] things up with thumb tacks make the hole
[57:26] as small as possible this wasn't with a
[57:28] thumbtack but you know she put that nail
[57:30] there and right in front of my
[57:34] father-in-law that comes crashing down
[57:36] that's not when you want those things to
[57:38] happen and you know what we don't want
[57:40] that kind of thing to happen in our
[57:41] lives when there's a time that we want
[57:43] things to turn out right that everything
[57:46] that we've hung our life upon has not
[57:49] been hung Upon A a strong nail in a sure
[57:53] place the right-hand man of Hezekiah was
[57:57] shebna and he wasn't a nail he wasn't a
[57:59] strong nail that that that Hezekiah
[58:02] could hang his King Deon and Hezekiah
[58:05] and God is merciful to Hezekiah he knows
[58:08] the Temptation that is going to be
[58:09] coming on Hezekiah where the devil's
[58:12] going to try to surround him and
[58:14] completely shut him in the Kingdom down
[58:16] just like as Christ looking through the
[58:19] church ages at the end of this
[58:20] Philadelphian age is L de is coming on
[58:23] how the Antichrist spirit trying to
[58:25] encircle the church and just strangle It
[58:27] Through The ecumenical Spirit he's
[58:28] looking on just like God was Isaiah was
[58:31] looking through hezekiah's time is snack
[58:34] RB's coming the king of Assyria is
[58:36] coming you're going to need a nail in a
[58:38] sure place you're going to need this the
[58:39] key of the city of David so that you can
[58:41] make it through these times because the
[58:42] devil's going to try to shut every
[58:44] single door but this key of the House of
[58:47] David it'll keep the doors open as long
[58:50] as it need to be open when it's under to
[58:51] shut that door that key will shut up and
[58:53] the devil can't ever get in
[58:55] that's what that's what Hezekiah needed
[58:57] and God's looking forward to the church
[58:58] AG he says that's what the church is
[59:00] going to need in the time of
[59:02] Philadelphia in the time of laa we want
[59:04] to have a we want to have Christ up into
[59:06] our hearts so much so that we can get
[59:07] the baptism of the Holy Spirit and that
[59:09] key is closed the devil can't get in
[59:13] that's what that key of the House of
[59:14] David has to talk about is it talks
[59:16] about the position where you're
[59:18] completely secure and God says Hezekiah
[59:21] you need to nail on the sure place you
[59:23] need that key of the House of David
[59:25] and God provides it through eliakim and
[59:27] he provides it in our time as
[59:31] well so we just want to kind of follow
[59:33] along uh this particular um Bible story
[59:36] here this in this Shadow so Isaiah
[59:38] foretold a couple things in the prophecy
[59:40] we just read that shebna is going to be
[59:42] demoted at the beginning shebna the
[59:44] treasure is over all the house but
[59:47] Isaiah says he's going to be demoted and
[59:49] eliakim is going to take his position
[59:51] and then in spite of the riches he's a
[59:53] master in Jerusalem shebna is going to
[59:55] be brought as a captive to a far country
[59:57] and he's going to die there and anybody
[59:58] who built their hopes around shabna's
[1:00:00] power is going to fall with him that's
[1:00:03] what we just read now we're going to
[1:00:06] follow along what happens here now in I
[1:00:09] let's turn over to Isaiah chapter
[1:00:13] 36 and we will see how this plays
[1:00:22] out Isaiah 36 and 37 I think they
[1:00:25] parallel uh 2 Kings 18 and
[1:00:29] 19 now it came to pass in the 14th year
[1:00:32] of King Hezekiah that sakb king of
[1:00:35] Assyria came up against all the defense
[1:00:37] cities of Judah and took
[1:00:40] them and the king of Assyria sent RAB
[1:00:42] Shaka from leish to Jerusalem to king
[1:00:45] ezekiah with a great Army leish was
[1:00:46] another walled City uh a Judean City an
[1:00:50] Israelite City and they had already
[1:00:52] surrounded that City and now uh sakra is
[1:00:56] sending Messengers from Lees over to
[1:00:59] Jerusalem and uh they go to King
[1:01:02] Hezekiah with their great Army and
[1:01:04] Hezekiah stood by the conduit of the
[1:01:06] upper pool and the highway of the
[1:01:07] Fuller's field pay attention to verse
[1:01:10] three then came forth unto him
[1:01:14] eliakim hilah's son which was over the
[1:01:18] house and shebna the
[1:01:21] Scribe what had just been prophesied in
[1:01:24] Isaiah 22 shebna was over the house and
[1:01:28] now demotion and promotion had been
[1:01:31] prophesied eliakim is now over the house
[1:01:35] and shebna is the
[1:01:37] Scribe God has already taken care of
[1:01:40] this it was prophesied if God's faithful
[1:01:43] in the type he's going to be faithful in
[1:01:45] the substance as well so sheb is just
[1:01:48] the Scribe the secretary then joah asf's
[1:01:51] son the recorder also goes long and um
[1:01:56] the prophecy is being uh is being
[1:01:58] fulfilled here and if you read what goes
[1:02:00] on in uh in Second Kings 18:19 and
[1:02:04] Isaiah chapter
[1:02:05] 36 rabsha comes and um they start uh
[1:02:10] it's it's uh it's just complete Assyrian
[1:02:14] propaganda they're making all these
[1:02:16] announcements in the Jewish language
[1:02:18] that everybody on the inside of the wall
[1:02:20] can hear what's being said the king and
[1:02:22] his Messengers say hey guys please can
[1:02:24] you please just talk to us in the Syrian
[1:02:26] we can do we can handle that said no
[1:02:28] we're not talking to you we're talking
[1:02:30] to the people behind you because the
[1:02:33] devil is dealing with fear he wants to
[1:02:35] make everybody fear and that's what he's
[1:02:37] trying to do here well what happens um
[1:02:40] at first in this story um Hezekiah um he
[1:02:44] doesn't respond as Faithfully as we
[1:02:46] would have liked keep your finger in in
[1:02:49] Isaiah 36 let's go over to 2 Kings 18
[1:02:55] and we'll see how this plays
[1:03:01] out because you will see that ezekiah
[1:03:04] needs a nail in a sure place because he
[1:03:07] goes through some pretty shaking
[1:03:12] times so 2 Kings 18 and uh and verse 13
[1:03:16] again it parallels Isaiah
[1:03:19] 36 in the 14th year of King ezekias and
[1:03:22] Acra king of Assyria came up against the
[1:03:24] cities of Judah and took them it says
[1:03:26] Hezekiah king of Syria king of Judah
[1:03:28] rather sent to the king of Assyria delaa
[1:03:31] saying hey I've offended return from me
[1:03:35] that which you put on me I will bear so
[1:03:38] this is a little bit different response
[1:03:40] this is not a really faith-filled
[1:03:42] response basically Hezekiah says I will
[1:03:44] pay what you ask me to pay just leave me
[1:03:48] alone and the king of Assyria appointed
[1:03:51] into Hezekiah king of Judah 300 talents
[1:03:53] of silver and 30 talents of gold a lot
[1:03:57] of money where does Hezekiah get the
[1:04:00] money Hezekiah gave him all the silver
[1:04:03] that was found in the house of the Lord
[1:04:06] and in the Treasures of the King's house
[1:04:07] he's plundering God's
[1:04:10] house and this next verse just when they
[1:04:13] saw this it just amazed me at that time
[1:04:16] did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the
[1:04:19] doors of the Temple of the
[1:04:21] Lord from the pillars which Hezekiah
[1:04:24] king of Judah had overlaid and he gave
[1:04:26] it to the king of Assyria so the
[1:04:28] beautiful gold that was overlay the the
[1:04:31] post the temple the doorways of the
[1:04:34] temple Hezekiah needs to get this gold
[1:04:36] so instead of going to the Altar and
[1:04:38] praying initially he's going along and
[1:04:41] with with their chisels getting all the
[1:04:43] I'm not sure how they did that but I'm
[1:04:45] imagine with with this chisel they're
[1:04:47] taking all this off boxing it up melting
[1:04:49] I don't know how how they did it but
[1:04:51] what are they doing that which is most
[1:04:53] important it's like they're they're
[1:04:54] they're ripping away God's glory to buy
[1:04:57] off this this this this this Pagan King
[1:05:01] and what does what impact does that have
[1:05:05] as they then next couple days go under
[1:05:07] the anybody who goes into the temple to
[1:05:09] pray you look around and you're not
[1:05:11] seeing images of God's strength and
[1:05:13] power anymore you're seeing we have
[1:05:15] debased our Temple these are reminders
[1:05:18] about how God wasn't there to help us
[1:05:20] but how we leaned upon the arm of Flesh
[1:05:22] not the not the arm of God
[1:05:25] ah wow this talk about
[1:05:28] condemnation they're right in it's just
[1:05:30] like if they go all their faults
[1:05:31] surrounding them in the very place that
[1:05:34] their faith should be being lifted up
[1:05:36] the devil is so subtle in how he works
[1:05:39] but that's what Hezekiah did he tried to
[1:05:42] buy off the devil it doesn't work we can
[1:05:46] try to buy off the devil get extra time
[1:05:49] good behavior whatever we do it's not
[1:05:50] going to work because what does uh what
[1:05:53] does sakb do he stays away for a while a
[1:05:55] little bit later he comes again with
[1:05:57] more forces he comes right there to
[1:06:00] Jerusalem and we can see what happens
[1:06:03] let's see I got to get my notes
[1:06:06] together this is where the RAB shika
[1:06:08] comes uh with this intimidating
[1:06:11] message and um we can catch this over
[1:06:17] in yep and and in in sorry 2 Kings
[1:06:23] 19 RAB Shake's speech is uh he's saying
[1:06:27] why how can you even lean
[1:06:30] upon god um God isn't he's not going to
[1:06:33] deliver you none of the none of the gods
[1:06:36] that sakb has come up against other
[1:06:37] countries have been able to overcome
[1:06:39] sakb he's not going to deliver you and
[1:06:42] uh um when Hezekiah hears this 2 Kings
[1:06:46] 19:1 he he he tears his clothes covers
[1:06:49] himself with sackcloth and he goes into
[1:06:52] the house of the Lord
[1:06:55] this is the same house of the Lord that
[1:06:56] he has just
[1:06:58] defaced that he robbed of its uh gold
[1:07:02] and and and silver so as he's going into
[1:07:04] the house of the Lord he's seeing
[1:07:06] reminders of his own weakness he's
[1:07:08] seeing reminders how he's failed God so
[1:07:10] many times and how much weaker he must
[1:07:13] then
[1:07:15] feel but he sent
[1:07:19] eliakim eliakim was this man that he
[1:07:22] know he knows Sak is coming he wants to
[1:07:24] close every door but I'm going to put a
[1:07:28] a man in a sure place a nail in a sure
[1:07:30] place with the key of the House of David
[1:07:32] here again liim he was over the
[1:07:34] household to take shb the Scribe he'd
[1:07:36] been demoted and they go to Isaiah the
[1:07:39] prophet son of amamos and uh they say to
[1:07:42] Isaiah this is a day of trouble rebuke
[1:07:46] and blasphemy and I just kind of think
[1:07:49] about this situation that Hezekiah finds
[1:07:51] himself in it's kind of similar to
[1:07:55] Revelation 3:10 I will keep you from the
[1:07:57] hour of Temptation where the Antichrist
[1:08:00] spirit is trying to hem Us in trying to
[1:08:02] trying to surround us choke us from all
[1:08:04] life that's what sakb was doing but God
[1:08:08] had a nail in a sure Place Hezekiah
[1:08:10] could hang his life upon there was a key
[1:08:12] of the House of David that would open
[1:08:14] every door and Isaiah um Isaiah tells
[1:08:19] him speaks to him and Isaiah verse 6
[1:08:22] speaks to these Messengers thus shall
[1:08:24] you say to your master thus says the
[1:08:25] Lord be not afraid of The Words which
[1:08:28] you've heard with which the Servants of
[1:08:29] the king of Assyria have blasphemed
[1:08:32] me I will send a blast upon him and he
[1:08:35] shall hear of a uh of a rumor returning
[1:08:38] to his own land and I will cause him to
[1:08:40] Fall by The Sword in his own
[1:08:43] land well when uh um Hezekiah gets back
[1:08:47] the messagers come back the devil also
[1:08:49] delivers a message Isaiah sends a
[1:08:52] message back with of of encouragement at
[1:08:54] the same time that sakra with rabika
[1:08:56] sends another message and
[1:08:59] um here's what rika's message
[1:09:05] says verse 10 let not thy God in whom
[1:09:08] you trust deceive you saying Jerusalem
[1:09:10] shall not be delivered into the hand of
[1:09:11] the king of Assyria isn't that just like
[1:09:13] the devil as soon as you've gotten the
[1:09:15] message of deliverance from God the
[1:09:18] devil's right there God did God just
[1:09:20] tell you this don't trust it it's not
[1:09:22] true parallel tracks God sending a
[1:09:26] message the devil's right there to tear
[1:09:28] it down so you won't believe
[1:09:30] it did God just say about this behold
[1:09:33] you've heard what the kings of Assyria
[1:09:35] have done to all lands by destroying
[1:09:36] them utterly and shall you be delivered
[1:09:40] the devil asks questions to get you to
[1:09:43] provide the answer to they're rhetorical
[1:09:45] questions so that you provide the answer
[1:09:47] when you're providing an answer to his
[1:09:49] questions you're almost in agreement
[1:09:51] with him so when the devil's asking
[1:09:53] questions let him talk to the hand don't
[1:09:55] give him the time of day otherwise
[1:09:57] you're participating in his plot to
[1:09:59] deceive
[1:10:00] you have the gods of the Nations
[1:10:03] delivered them which my father have
[1:10:04] destroyed as Goen heran Reef Etc where
[1:10:07] is the king of a where is the king of
[1:10:09] arpa Etc and Hezekiah received the
[1:10:13] letter of the hand of The Messengers and
[1:10:15] he read it then Hezekiah takes this
[1:10:18] letter he walks down to the temple he
[1:10:22] walks past the same pillars that he had
[1:10:24] stripped the gold
[1:10:26] from he's walking past these reminders
[1:10:30] of how he himself had
[1:10:32] failed we have to walk past the
[1:10:34] reminders of our own failures because
[1:10:37] the devil get these pillars say yep you
[1:10:39] failed here you failed there don't go
[1:10:41] any further but he had this letter he
[1:10:44] had to he had to talk to God about this
[1:10:46] letter so he goes further he goes to the
[1:10:48] doorway that he had just stripped the
[1:10:50] gold from the silver from all the
[1:10:52] precious things the says hey what's so
[1:10:55] precious about your walk with God you
[1:10:56] stripped the very value of it yourself
[1:10:59] it's nothing valuable there but Hezekiah
[1:11:02] has to walk past that the devil's doing
[1:11:05] everything he can by hezekiah's own
[1:11:07] faults to keep him back from God and he
[1:11:10] goes fth and he goes into the very
[1:11:11] Temple itself and he goes in and lays
[1:11:14] this letter before the presence of God
[1:11:17] there on the ark and there are not very
[1:11:19] many prayers that are recorded word for
[1:11:21] word in the Old Testament but this is
[1:11:23] one of them and Hezekiah to take such
[1:11:26] steps past his own
[1:11:29] failures that the devil had Memorial
[1:11:32] memorialized so so poignantly he stepped
[1:11:35] past them got past himself as God I
[1:11:38] can't handle this letter anymore this
[1:11:41] letter that I got from sakb stole all
[1:11:43] the peace that Isaiah had given me Lord
[1:11:45] I need to hear from you I just heard
[1:11:47] from the prophet I don't I need more
[1:11:49] than prophet's words right now I need
[1:11:50] your words right now Isaiah had spoken
[1:11:53] about now he's not sending people to
[1:11:55] Isaiah anymore he's going to God himself
[1:11:58] and that's what we need to do we need to
[1:12:00] have a personal walk with God and God
[1:12:02] will Design things in our life so that
[1:12:04] we can't just pick up the phone and call
[1:12:05] somebody else we get on our knees and
[1:12:07] seek God ourselves in prayer and God
[1:12:10] will answer Hezekiah he he spreads this
[1:12:15] letter there in in verse verse 14 he he
[1:12:18] he spreads this letter before the Lord
[1:12:21] and he prays this oh Lord God of is
[1:12:23] Israel which dwelleth between the
[1:12:25] cherubims thou are the god even thou
[1:12:29] alone of all the kingdoms of the earth
[1:12:31] thou H has made Heaven and Earth Lord
[1:12:33] bow down thine ear and hear Open Lord
[1:12:36] thine eyes and see hear the words of
[1:12:38] sakra which has sent him to reproach the
[1:12:41] Living God of a truth Lord the kings of
[1:12:44] Assyria have destroyed the nations in
[1:12:46] their land they have cast their gods to
[1:12:48] the fire for they weren't real Gods with
[1:12:50] the work of men's hands wood and stone
[1:12:52] therefore have they destroy them now
[1:12:54] therefore oh Lord Our God I beseech thee
[1:12:58] save thou us out of his hand that all
[1:13:01] the kingdom of the earth may know that
[1:13:03] thou art the Lord God even thou
[1:13:08] only
[1:13:09] amen and God heard the prayers of this
[1:13:14] king who had just backslidden some
[1:13:17] months before stripped the value of that
[1:13:19] out of his testimony stri the value of
[1:13:21] the temple he felt rotten
[1:13:23] but you know when we feel rotten have
[1:13:25] nowhere else to go we go as a rotten
[1:13:27] person to the throne of God and God
[1:13:28] accepts us and he hears us he hears
[1:13:30] Hezekiah and Hezekiah shortly thereafter
[1:13:34] got word back and you know what um he
[1:13:36] says that uh this King sakb he goes back
[1:13:40] into his own land he does hear a rumor
[1:13:43] just like Isaiah had heard he goes back
[1:13:44] into his own land and as this God as
[1:13:46] this an ACB in verse 37 it came to pass
[1:13:50] as he was worshiping in the house of nro
[1:13:53] his God God that the damac and sherzer
[1:13:55] his sons smote him with the sword and
[1:13:58] they escaped in the land of Armenia and
[1:14:00] his son reigned in his dead this is
[1:14:03] exactly what God had said would happen
[1:14:04] through Isaiah the prophet and the Sak's
[1:14:08] God wasn't able to protect him from his
[1:14:09] own
[1:14:11] son this again is the
[1:14:15] shadow this faithful man eliakim when
[1:14:19] he's getting when when Hezekiah is
[1:14:21] getting all kinds of conflicting
[1:14:23] messages all kinds of conflicting
[1:14:26] messages if shebna the Scribe been over
[1:14:28] there this treasure might have been
[1:14:29] saying we can't afford it King we can't
[1:14:32] do this King we can't do this King but
[1:14:34] he
[1:14:34] had a faithful man a true man next to
[1:14:38] him who could speak truth go back and
[1:14:39] forth to the prophet with him shebna
[1:14:41] just went along as a Lackey but eliakim
[1:14:43] was faithful and true and that's what
[1:14:45] God knew this King needed because he had
[1:14:48] this key of the House of David as sakb
[1:14:51] tries to close every door this key opens
[1:14:54] it when sakb tries to try to bust
[1:14:57] everything open this key keeps it closed
[1:15:00] that's what that's what they needed and
[1:15:02] next time when we look in the age of
[1:15:04] Philadelphia as we maybe we can look
[1:15:05] over in Revelation chapter 3 we can see
[1:15:08] what's described toward the end of it
[1:15:11] when brother brandom talks about the
[1:15:13] Philadelphia age and the leodan age he
[1:15:15] sees says these these two ages they they
[1:15:18] fade into one another there's there's a
[1:15:20] like this this lapping over periods they
[1:15:23] go from one to the other very quickly
[1:15:24] because the last stage is is is is is is
[1:15:27] is short and this this work that starts
[1:15:30] in Philadelphia comes into a quick
[1:15:31] fruition in La
[1:15:34] DEA and you can see that the devil is
[1:15:36] fighting tooth and nail um that's why
[1:15:39] you see in verse in verse 10 about this
[1:15:41] hour of Temptation is kind of looms over
[1:15:44] the devil's trying to to to to uh to
[1:15:47] strangle the seed before it uh before it
[1:15:49] gets any more light but um the message
[1:15:53] message here is the devil's going to try
[1:15:55] to close every door he's going to try to
[1:15:57] strangle but you've got the key of the
[1:15:59] House of David he is faithful and true
[1:16:03] if you think this story about shebna and
[1:16:05] eliakim was powerful that's just the
[1:16:08] shadow because when when we go through
[1:16:11] tough times and brother bam says this
[1:16:12] hour of Temptation This has to do with
[1:16:14] the ecumenical movement drawing
[1:16:17] everything together to shut down the
[1:16:19] true church that's going to be powerful
[1:16:21] but you've got the key of the House of
[1:16:22] De David there and then then no then the
[1:16:26] devil can't shut any door that's a
[1:16:28] that's a um that God opens he can't open
[1:16:31] the door that God
[1:16:34] shuts the bottom of page uh
[1:16:41] four because
[1:16:43] um he goes on to say to them because
[1:16:45] you've taken my word and lived by it and
[1:16:47] thereby become patient I will keep you
[1:16:50] from the hour of Temptation which shall
[1:16:52] come upon the world to try them that
[1:16:54] dwell upon the earth now here again we
[1:16:56] see the overlapping of the two ages
[1:16:58] Philadelphia and ludia for This Promise
[1:17:00] has to do with the end of the Gentile
[1:17:02] period which culminates in the Great
[1:17:04] Tribulation I will keep thee from the
[1:17:06] hour of Temptation which shall come upon
[1:17:09] all the world to try them that dwell
[1:17:10] upon the Earth this verse is not a
[1:17:13] declaration that the true church will go
[1:17:14] into and through the tribulation if it
[1:17:16] meant that it would have said it but it
[1:17:18] said I will keep you from the hour of
[1:17:20] Temptation this temptation is exactly
[1:17:22] like the temp ation in in Eden it'll be
[1:17:25] a very inviting proposition held up in
[1:17:28] direct opposition to God's commanded
[1:17:30] word and yet from the standpoint of
[1:17:32] human reasoning it'll be so very right
[1:17:35] so enlightening and
[1:17:38] lifegiving as to fool the world only the
[1:17:41] elect will not be fooled the Temptation
[1:17:43] will come as follows The ecumenical move
[1:17:45] that has started on what seems such a
[1:17:47] beautiful and blessed principle
[1:17:49] fulfilling Christ prayer that we all
[1:17:50] might be one we saw a video of that last
[1:17:53] month it's is so deceptive it'll become
[1:17:56] so strong politically that she Bears
[1:17:58] pressure upon the government to cause
[1:17:59] all to join with her either directly or
[1:18:02] through adherence to principles little
[1:18:04] groups will lose Charters privileges Etc
[1:18:06] until they lose all property and
[1:18:07] spiritual rights with the people but the
[1:18:09] promise here is you've got the key of
[1:18:12] the House of David that keeps every door
[1:18:14] open needs to be open keep every door
[1:18:16] shut that needs to be shut and that
[1:18:19] [Music]
[1:18:21] key you can look at uh uh page three
[1:18:25] what does the key signify we don't
[1:18:27] usually have a key on our shoulder
[1:18:29] usually keys in a hand or some people
[1:18:31] might wear Keys around their neck but
[1:18:34] why is this being written as the key is
[1:18:36] on its shoulder what does the shoulder
[1:18:38] have to do with it and somewhere else
[1:18:41] the shoulders important the government
[1:18:43] shall be upon his shoulders as
[1:18:44] prophesied brother am says the bottom of
[1:18:46] page three the government shall be upon
[1:18:48] his shoulder it comes from the wedding
[1:18:50] ceremony of the East when the bride has
[1:18:53] been committed to the groom as she takes
[1:18:55] off her veil and places it over the
[1:18:56] groom's shoulder signify not only is she
[1:18:59] under his Dominion that she has
[1:19:01] transferred her rights to him that he is
[1:19:03] the head but also that he Bears the
[1:19:05] responsibility and the care that he and
[1:19:08] he alone no one else nor their man nor
[1:19:10] their power has any right and
[1:19:13] responsibility and that beloved is the
[1:19:15] Key of David the Key of David has to do
[1:19:18] with our
[1:19:19] position that we are the Bride of Christ
[1:19:24] and in that position we're completely
[1:19:26] safe we're completely secure and that's
[1:19:29] a beautiful thing and it's not just the
[1:19:31] key of the House of David it's not just
[1:19:33] about a key and a door yes the the
[1:19:37] Philadelphian age was a was a missionary
[1:19:39] age every door seem to be open
[1:19:40] missionaries went around the world but
[1:19:43] uh it could it speaks of a special
[1:19:44] relationship being between Christ and
[1:19:46] the believer our hearts can be locked
[1:19:51] sometimes it yet God's key can open that
[1:19:54] locked heart the devil tries to P push
[1:19:57] so many complexes upon us so many things
[1:19:59] in our past so our heart can just stay
[1:20:01] locked to him but that key of the House
[1:20:03] of David can open those closed Hearts so
[1:20:06] they can be restored so this age of the
[1:20:09] open door is much more than just a
[1:20:11] missionary age as God's word has been
[1:20:14] restored relationships with his people
[1:20:17] can be restored as well and when this
[1:20:19] Keys open the doors of our hearts the
[1:20:22] devil can't shut those doors either and
[1:20:25] when the Kia's closed doors were
[1:20:26] completely sealed he can't open and
[1:20:29] burst himself in there either we have
[1:20:31] security there so I was just amazed as
[1:20:34] we were getting into the uh into this
[1:20:37] Philadelphian age I'd uh never expected
[1:20:40] there to be so much in this very
[1:20:42] beginning about I'm the key of the House
[1:20:45] of David the open door I thought that's
[1:20:47] was just the missionary age but verse 8
[1:20:49] says I've set before thee an open door
[1:20:52] and what is it this Open Door well
[1:20:53] Christ is the door as he's he's setting
[1:20:56] himself up before us he's revealing more
[1:20:58] to him of himself to us so we can come
[1:21:01] into a closer relationship with us Jesus
[1:21:04] is the door he's the door of the sheep
[1:21:06] and now it speaks of a door opening I
[1:21:08] set before you an open door this is a
[1:21:10] revelation of himself and it's that
[1:21:12] Revelation that brings us strength which
[1:21:16] is what we need in hour of Temptation
[1:21:18] that gives us illumination that
[1:21:19] glorifies his name and it's in the midst
[1:21:22] of these last to ages at the revelation
[1:21:23] of who Christ is blossoms out before us
[1:21:27] so next time Lord willing we'll talk
[1:21:29] more about uh what actually goes on in
[1:21:32] the age we see now if the shadow is that
[1:21:34] powerful the substance is even more
[1:21:37] powerful amen let's
[1:21:40] pray Heavenly Father we thank you for
[1:21:42] your goodness to us your grace to us
[1:21:46] Lord father I know uh circumstances in
[1:21:49] life can uh can uh can happen situations
[1:21:54] just happen Lord that can lock us all up
[1:21:57] that can uh Lord keep us from hearing
[1:22:01] your word just be caused of such
[1:22:03] confusion Lord Lord I just pray that you
[1:22:06] would bring that key into our hearts
[1:22:09] Lord they might be unlocked and Open
[1:22:12] Lord so that you can fill every fiber of
[1:22:14] our being so that when we're completely
[1:22:16] filled that heart can be just locked up
[1:22:18] again so we're completely safe with you
[1:22:20] oh God Lord that's what we talking about
[1:22:23] but they brought Paul's been talk about
[1:22:24] the baptism the Holy Spirit Lord father
[1:22:27] sometimes the spirit can become cloudy
[1:22:29] and Lord we just pray that your your
[1:22:31] light will come over that and will open

[1:22:36] your light can strike this strike our
[1:22:37] soul oh God lord I pray that your light
