========================================

20 years ago i guess it was her and her children and grandchildren from liberia we took them to church about every sunday in our car they didn't have a vehicle and she passed away this morning sister mary and this is a picture of her and me i felt led to go last down last year down to charlotte and i'm so glad that i did i got to see her and express my appreciation for her being a part of a congregation and she has stayed faithful to the lord through the years i don't even know what age i know she's in her 80s and and so we're thankful for the people who had an influence on us and we had an influence on them and they were grateful some of you most of you probably weren't here when she was here but she's a great godly sister of god and we're losing some but we're thankful that we have faithful people to the work of the lord faithful to the message and we honor their memory can you say amen if your brother gary has passed on and the family has not let me know yet about the memorial service but we've asked if we could have a memorial service here for brother gary so they're still getting things in order and they have to bring his brother in from virginia they will let us know so if you're wondering about that we'll let you know should be here hopefully this month sometime we'll have a memorial service for him we thank god for these heroes of faith that has stood faithful to the word amen joshua chapter 11 if you have your bibles open we'll read a section of scripture here my family and i will be away this week on vacation so we just if you have a need or something you're welcome to contact the brothers that are here brother brandon and any of the ministering brothers or deacons if you have a need joshua 11 and verse 16 so joshua took all that land the hills and all the south country and all the land of goshen and the valley and the plain and the mountain of israel and the valley the same i pray that through this series removing what's between you and the promises i pray that you're taking more of your land i pray this testimony that you're taking more of your land even from the mount haleck that goeth up to syrah even unto baalgad in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon and all the kings he took and smote them and slew them joshua made war a long time with all those kings there was not a city that made peace with the children of israel saved the hittites the inhabitants of gideon all others they took in battle and this is the verse i want to speak about today a little bit for it was of the lord to harden their hearts how many knows in the scripture god's able to harden the enemy's heart i remember how many remember pharaoh's heart being hardened and god always has a purpose for that he's not doing just to play games with people's heart he has a purpose for it in this case it was the lore to harden hearts that they should come against israel in battle that he might destroy them utterly and that they might have no favor but that he might destroy them as the lord commanded moses the prophet whatever the prophet commanded and prophesied now some 50 years later 60 years later we're seeing the prophet's word being fulfilled in israel so whatever the prophet commanded here we have it fulfilled in them conquering and taking the land that god has given them heavenly father we ask you to bless your word we ask you father to just minister to our hearts we see that the songs this morning and the special song has just really moved us into a place that we could soften our hearts that your word could be planted in us lord that's what music is for that's what music was intended for and lord we see lord if there's any heart hearts in us that you would remove it that lord we would have an open welcome place that you could speak father and that you'd use this simple vessel and this gift you've given me to be able to feed the flock and be able to minister to those who are in need today we thank you lord for the hungry hearts we thank you for those who have gathered lord my prayers that you fill every one of these seats here every one of them with hungry hearts in this generation it would seem father that people don't want the word anymore and that people are too distracted by many other things and they're not interested in it but lord i believe you're going to prove the enemy wrong that there are hungry hearts that are going to come and hear your word and father there's a famine for the hearing of the word and so we're glad to have these that have gathered today and we just humbly pray that you will feed us and feed your flock bless the che mary chafe family today as they've lost their mom their grandmother be with them comfort their hearts i pray you'll lift them up lord and also i remember my brother john garrett that you will strengthen him lord and give him peace and father we just our hearts are with him today be near him and speak to him your promises we pray in jesus name we ask it amen amen god bless you may be seated god bless you uncle dan and aunt linda my mom's brother and his wife they stopped by every now and then they stop by and see us and it's good to have you guys god bless you from the charlotte area north carolina area amen i'm going to go through a move quite quickly in the first part of this this morning and go through a few more of these things and points that is coming in between you and the promises and then we'll come back to our opening scripture and end on that as we read our text then we'll come back to that opening scripture and speak on that a little bit but i want to move quite quickly through some more of these things we don't have to talk about them a lot but they're things that get in between you and the promises of god that should be a priority that anything that gets between us and god's promises should be removed if it's an enemy that's between you and taken all of your inheritance it should be removed and we have to submit ourselves to the lord for those things to be removed from our lives can you say amen and some of these that i'll bring up right away this morning will have a theme or will be related to the influence of other people there are other people in our lives how many has other people in your lives family associates you know bosses employees there are other people in our lives and as much as sometimes we would prefer maybe not to have other people in our lives we're always going to have other people in our lives and these some of these things especially the last point will be related to the influence of other people in our lives everybody here sitting here this morning and listening to the streaming everybody everybody here is under the influence of someone there's no human being not under the influence of somebody and some of you are under the influence of people you don't even know very well some of you are under the influence of people that you don't even know very well and you don't even know at all there's people that get under the influence of maybe a movie star or someone who dresses like you would like to dress you don't even know that person you don't even know their life teenagers quite doing that and i hate to say it but older ones who don't grow up they're under the influence of somebody that they don't even know they don't know how they live they don't know as well i heard a distant thing they were a christian but you don't know their lives and yet you're under the influence of them yet you're wearing what they wear and you're duplicating what they do and you're you're posting exactly how they are because you're under their influence but it's not just those it's everyone everybody is under somebody's influence and uh so that's a powerful thing that's a thing to talk about because other people's influence can get in between you and the promises of god another person's influence can get in between you and you may have been influenced by an uncle or an aunt or a grandfather or something years and years ago they might be gone now but there are people that are still under their influence even though they're gone and passed away the influence is a powerful powerful thing so let's be honest this morning everybody is under somebody's influence so now i want the first thing i wanted to mention to you today and this is number seven and all the things that can be getting between you and the promises number seven is that the wrong crowd if you're around the wrong crowd it can get in between you and the promises of god you're hanging with the wrong people you're hanging around the wrong people uh and and the the people that you keep company with the most will make you what you are will form your opinions will form your uh your impressions of things the people that you hang around with the most whether good or bad they're going to be an influence on you the people that you keep company with the most will make you what you are the people that you hang with i'm using that term hang with because that's the modern term from the young people who are you hanging with dad where are you going i'm going to hang out with my friends so this is this is what they call it well who you hang out with is is an influence and who you hang out with the most can be an influence in your life and it's pretty obvious for a christian if you hang around worldly people too much they will end up being an influence on you instead of you being an influence on them just simply because that's who you hang with most of the time uh so that's pretty obvious it's not a good thing to hang a lot amount of time with worldly people it might rub off on you we want to be a testimony we want to be a witness jesus encouraged that we be a witness to those and he himself bible says he was around sinners and different things but a lot of times they were coming to him it wasn't that he was necessarily going out to them but they were drawn to jesus and so he would hang out and share things with them so but we understand if you go out and get in their territory and you're spending a huge amount of time with people like that instead of the right crowd it's going to be an influence on you and it's going to keep you from the promises of god that's pretty simple isn't it so obviously we're worldly people but your job and your school and certain situations you have to be around uh people sometimes and it's not by your choice you don't choose to be around certain atmospheres at your job certain people you hang around that and it's not by choice and you're going to hear a lot of stuff you're going to hear a lot of cussing you're going to hear dirty jokes and there are some times that we don't have a choice we have to hear all that we can't say no i'm not going to go to work today because they're cussing too much we can't say that so there are some things we have a choice in the crowd that we're on there are some things that we don't have a choice we don't have a choice sometimes we do have a choice so i would just say to you that the things that we don't have a choice we can't get around that we have to bear and say lord help me to keep my spirit clean help me lord not to get these dirty words in my mind and these dirty stories that i'm hearing help me lord and just sanctify me keep me clean by the word of god we don't because i don't have a choice in this but most of the time we have a choice in who we're hanging around and so if i have that choice still i want to make a good choice i want to hang around the right people can you say ma'am and and so i want to be around the right people i want to read around the right influences and uh i think someone asked brother branham a question one time who should we let our teenage teenagers hang around with and she said he said getting get them around good associates and good boys and good girls as long as you can get them around the right influences get them there around the right crowd because they're gonna have friends can you say amen they're going to want to go out with friends they're going to want to go do this and go do that and it would be unrealistic to think they get to those ages and they don't have to be around anybody but you you're being unrealistic as they grow older they're going to want to have friends but we are as responsible as parents especially the young years to direct them who they hang around and give them choices of a good christian camp to go to to look forward to give them choices of good ones to be around and the and the youth meetings that we have here and the different events to get them around and not everybody in those youth meetings are perfect by any means not every teenager coming to our youth meetings has got it all completely together but i guarantee you it's a better atmosphere than being out there in the world can i get an amen so you have a choice in that and the things that i have a choice in i want to be able to to direct that can you say amen and and so we have choices and uh by associating who we're hanging around uh we should make good choices of who that is brother brahm says in the message believing god and the only thing that kept me from being saved when i was 12 years old because a spirit hung over me a devil saying wait a little while longer that's the reason you wasn't saved you knew when you became the age of accountability a spirit you got in a crowd and that hovered over you and you kept it kept hanging over you now friends this is a principle this is not just a story about a 12 year old being on the wrong crowd and the wrong influence and with that crowd came a spirit that actually said don't give your heart to the lord now just wait a little longer this is not just a 12 year old i knew i know 40 year olds that need to get this principle they're hanging around the wrong people can you say man and with those people comes a spirit that causes you to hesitate and wait to take the promises of god and let me say it this way to grow as a full mature son and daughter of god spiritually it's holding you back from your growth it's a spirit that says just wait a little longer i'm good enough i'm a good person and i'm telling you when you get out of that and get in the word it's going to be encouraging you to grow further in the grace of god can i get a greater amen than that i believe that this applies to everybody that he said i got around the wrong boys at 12 years old i got around the wrong crowd and i said i'll be fine i'll be good i can i can do this but listen you stay long enough they're going to influence you instead of you influencing them and also there might be a spirit there that's with that crowd that makes you wait a little longer amen well i don't feel comfortable around people who talk about the bible and the lord all the time or at all i don't feel comfortable around those that wear modest dress and well doesn't that show what's in you so you got to take a look say i don't feel comfortable around people like that i run from people like that and yet you're choosing other ones doesn't that show where you're at who do you feel comfortable to be around you like the jezebels you like to hang around jezebels you like to hang around fornicators when the bible says don't hang around fornicators the bible says that you like to hang around successful people who are christians who speak against the message of the hour you like to hang around that shouldn't you pray about that that that is a choice that you're making that is going to influence your life that's not a good influence and it'll keep you from the promises of god so as i in this point i would say who should i get around then brother paul who should i get around and paul said a couple things one place he said paul said follow me as i follow christ paul said follow me as i follow christ let me take it a bit deeper because that's the prophet of god paul the apostle paul the prophet of god he said follow me as i follow christ we're not following the man we're following the christ in the man so i've got confidence and when i talked a few minutes ago about everybody is under the influence of somebody i'd rather my influence of my decisions the influence be under a true prophet of god than anybody i'm going to go ahead and say this that i value a god called man and his opinions above my own opinion sometimes i knew i wouldn't get as many amens on that but that's how i've ordered my life since the 16 year old boy i'm not ashamed to be under the influence of a god called prophet i'm not ashamed to be under the influence of what this bible is is prophets and apostles and i read this every day because why i would rather be under their influence than my own opinions i would rather this form my opinions of life than to form my own is that cultish no if it is then paul was wrong when he said follow me as i follow christ is that some type of brainwashing yeah in some ways it is because paul said be transformed by the renewing of your mind you don't want to live by just your own thoughts you want to live by you don't enter the influence of the world or under the influence of movie stars or the influence of politicians you want to be under the influence of godly men and the holy ghost and the spirit of god can you say amen you have a choice who you're under the influence of so the next scripture the last one i want to read as i end this point is hebrews 6 12. i don't know if you guys could pull that up quickly but hebrews 6 12 says hebrews 6 12 says and i don't have the whole scripture it says that ye be not slawful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises who do i need to hang around the most those that are taking hold of these promises and you can see it they're on fire with it and they're human beings they have struggles they've had trials but you know what they're barreling through and you can see them they're taking the promises i see more of the character of christ i see more of the victory of christ i see more of the love of christ i see them growing in the lord i see things in their life that i want to be so i'm going to hang with people like that followers are those you say brother paul you preach this series i'm hardly inheriting my promises i'm still held back well then maybe take a step and get around some people who are inheriting the promises and maybe that'll rub off on you get back up here and go to the next point because okay go with me to first corinthians 10 and we'll go to a few more points here first corinthians 10. now this is the group in the wilderness that we read in hebrews last week and now we give some more points from how they were acting in first corinthians 10. moreover brethren i would not have you be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto moses the prophet in the cloud and in the sea did all eat the same spiritual meat did all drink the same spiritual meat drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed him that rock was christ but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted so now it's going to go into some points of what kept them out of the promised land what kept them from going in god wandering in the wilderness this is the same group that we read last sunday in hebrews the same group that it said they heard the gospel preached but it did no good to them because it wasn't mixed with faith remember my points last sunday they had hardened hearts they had unbelief they kept doubting moses they kept in that mode and it kept him out of the promised land right here's the same group and here's some more points about that group in the wilderness neither be ye first of all it says don't lust after evil things neither be idolaters as some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play there's a similarity with the word idols that comes from the other word idol i-d-l-e and they just basically become idol first the main time it happens when moses was up getting the word and they just were you know laying around moses isn't coming down moses isn't coming down they got impatient they they got all the gold together they formed an idol they formed one but it wasn't just they rose it wasn't just that they gonna worship this calf they became idle they should have been praying for moses they said this should have been saying in the waiting time shouldn't we just pray and just pray for him that god speaks to him and we're ready to receive the word but the time they got idle idle time makes people idol worshipers you got teenagers young people the devil's in the details idle time is the devil's playground when you're on your phone and on the internet too many hours of idle time just doing that is very dangerous okay countless hours watching posts and looking through these votes can bring you down can make you depressed you know how the postings is everybody's life is more exciting than yours you know how it goes and you get more and more depressed because they're in tahiti somewhere this even though we know they might be just making their bedroom look like tahiti and they're not really there and the dish that they did and all this and basically it just screams my life is better than yours and we live by that we get under the influence of that and everybody's better everything's not everything but this is a very immature thing and people in their idle time don't fill it with the word of god or being around the right people you stand alone you're alone with somebody and character is character is what you are when you're by yourself this is really going to show up and so if you have idle time they rose up to play they they got into pleasures fornication come in all because of this idle time and then an idol came in after that so it says don't do that okay this is things that can come in between you and the promise of god neither let us commit fornication verse eight as some of them committed and fell in one one day three and twenty thousand neither let us tempt crisis some of them were also tempted and were destroyed of serpents last son we talked about how they tempted god neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these things happen unto them for examples that and they happen unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come those things happen so that we can take the example is that you're going to be kept from the promised land if you allow yourself to become idol you allow yourself to become a murmur and complainer these are things number eight lusting after evil things number nine the pleasure that comes in idolatry and idols number 10 murmuring and complaining these are things that keep people from the promised land it did it back then it'll do it now now did you notice that all these things are not individuals it's a crowd that did it it's them it's the other people it says they were idolaters they rose up the people sat up down to eat and drink and rose up to play so many more things i could say about that neither let us commit fornication as some of them did and them that tempted christ and neither murmur as some of them also murdered this was not one individual this was the crowd this was a crowd that became complainers if you hang around murmurs and complainers you probably will become that way you'll become negative if you hang hanging out today is not i'd say today we're not around as many people as we used to be having them over to our homes and different things like that that's a detriment but we're not around are hanging out is on social media and if you think that has less influence than somebody at your house you're crazy because it probably has more influence and you don't even know sometimes who they are but the whole social media is the crowd what's the crowd saying what's everybody saying what's the general consensus here what's the and you can get on with certain people and they're constantly murmuring complaining putting things down they're just negative and you'll become that way or if you hang out on the social media with people that are successful in the world's eyes they always got things they're always got this got this knew this knew this and they're always boasting on it on the internet if you hang out with that you become that way you become possession minded you under get under the influence of it if you hang out with people there that are depressed all the time and they have a spirit of depression who do you go to when you get depressed a lot of times people go to depressed people for counsel you're laughing because it's funny okay now i'm gonna get you when you have hit a hard time in your life should we be in church more or out of church more you don't have to stay amen to that one just think about it what would be a good thing if you're really going through it probably around the atmosphere of the word the saints of god the encouragement the songs but a lot of times people will go the opposite direction and the very thing they need is a thing they distance themselves from you understand it's influence and if you go to somebody for council first of all that's going to tell you what you want to hear and sympathize and play a pity party with you they're not doing you any good if you're going to people on social media that have the same problems as you and haven't been delivered for years you're not going to be delivered i'm asking you to think about it this morning that you have to make a choice of who influences you if you're interested in deliverance from things there's a promise that you don't have to live in that depression anymore there's a promise that you don't have to live in bitterness anymore there's a promise right in front of you but you're holding it back by hanging around the wrong crowd these people were murmurs complainers they were fornicators there all these things and couldn't go into the promised land and if you were there the best thing that you could do is to distance yourself and by the way joshua and caleb had to do that joshua and caleb got away from that crowd got away from the murmurs and complainers got away from the fornicators the idolaters and they may have walked alone but they got away from because why they wanted the promised land i want the promised land and it does mean no good to hang around murmurs and complainers number 11 prosperity would you turn with me to deuteronomy 6 prosperity is something that keeps you from the promises is there anything wrong with prosperity no but how can prosperity keep you from the promises he says here in deuteronomy it says in several places before the chinese came into the promised land several warnings and some of them like a whole chapter full of it here's a small area that says deuteronomy 6 verse 10 if you guys would put it up deuteronomy 6 and verse 10 you wouldn't think that prosperity would keep you from the promises of god watch some god prosper somebody's life watching they get more things watching god blesses what they're doing watching it's god's blessing and they even give god glory for it thank god he's blessing this and he's blessing this and my business and all this stuff be careful it's a test when things begin to expand and you're doing this and doing this and that and it said be careful be ready it's right here in the scripture because it can keep you from the promises of god it becomes a trap and you think oh but god's blessing it but there's always a test that goes with it where's your heart and verse 10 says and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which he swear unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac to jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou build us not and houses full of all good things which shall fill us not and wells dig with saudis now and vineyards and olive trees which thou plant us not when thou shalt have eaten and be full then beware lest thou forget the lord this warning is here in several places before the children of israel come into their promised land a land flowing with milk and honey places that were given them by god they had to drive the enemy out but they were giving them my god they never had to pay for it it was the blessing of god when they come into it he knew ahead of time our hearts and he says when you go into that price for prosperity then beware lest you forget the lord oh it's happened to thousands of people in the message christians ruined by prosperity because all of a sudden their priorities change what's important changes and they still think god's blessing because everything's being blessed but you're forgetting the lord you're forgetting your walk with the lord something has become in between you and you growing into the promises of god and prosperity did it i say we take his warning can you say amen so when we come to our text now moving on told you i'd move quickly promised my wife i'd preach short today she never believes me when i say that 27 years of marriage and she's learned and she says when i say that i actually end up preaching longer and sometimes i said i don't very have too much here today i do but sometimes i just don't have too much i just you know be a short surface she says when you don't have too much on your notes it ends up being a longer service art wives just a lovely thing just so precious what would you do without that voice in your life just to keep you humble children and wives should just keep you in your place keep you real praise the lord i have the best wife in the world i want to just say just now she's one of the seven wonders of the world i love her to death and now i've embarrassed her so but i'm taking you on vacation this week don't forget that when we read our scripture in in joshua there about the lord hard in the hearts if you want to turn back there just keep that and we'll just talk about that a little bit just back here in joshua chapter 11 verse 20 for it was of the lord to harden their hearts that they should come against israel in battle that they might destroy them utterly and that they might have no favor but that he might destroy them as the lord commanded moses so last week we were talking about our hearts becoming hardened the children of israel come to unbelief because they let their hearts be hard and i don't have time to talk about it today but if you could listen to last sunday you'd see how did they become hardened in their hearts the very people listen to the prophet the very people in the message become hard in their hearts i explained it last sunday is that they kind of put god in a spot lord if you do this miracle then i'll serve you is that a lack of commitment and god would even meet their miracles but over time if we don't get the things that we want just how we want them our hearts become hardened and we start to disbelieve the word of god so last week it was about our hearts becoming hardened and the holy spirit i want to thank him today for how the holy spirit so deeply moved last sunday something the presence of god come in such a special way at the end unexpected and those that raised their hand maybe some that didn't but those who reacted to that presence being there that way i am hearing testimony after testimony after testimony of god just coming down in that moment listen the most important thing in your life is the holy spirit comes in your life and you respond to it because i can preach a sermon here for 60 minutes you might not get nothing but when he comes and starts wooing your hearts last last sunday god began to woo a heart to be able to say i want a young boy to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ last sunday sunday somebody who's had migraine headaches they ask a sister to pray i think it was at communion or before it this wasn't even the morning service and we had such a lovely time at communion service we had 70 i think 70 or 80 people at communion that's the largest show up for the lord's supper in the history of this church almost 80 people come for the lord's supper and that's the way it should be can you say man she asked the sister to pray she had those migraines for days instantly it was i believe this was if not the next day we had dinner with them she said i don't have any pain whatsoever sister laura received a healing for something on her neck that's a grow not a growth but something that was there and she said i just put my hand on it after that service and raise your hand and it was gone there's some we still have to wait for the healing and reports to come back because they raise their hand it might be instantaneous it might be later but i tell you hold on to the promise of god can you say man that's more than paul lafontaine that's the reality of this god that's among us you got depression you got things you need to be in the presence of the lord and respond and say lord i want what you have for me you don't have to work for it you just receive it in the name of the lord jesus christ god is real friends god is real this isn't about church in a beautiful building and a preacher it's about god coming down he loves you he cares about what you're going through and he wants you to see the victory that he's given you in jesus christ christ wants to see you come to victory through him so we cannot become hardened and we talked about that last week but now this scripture says other people who get hardened so it's not us becoming hard it's other people that are hard hearts and the mystery of it in our text is that god the lord hardened the enemy's heart and so let me just say this way when god wants to finish something off that's in between you and your promise he may increase the pressure by hardening their heart towards you amen when god is so interested in taking you from where you are to taking more of your promises the lord may harden the heart of the enemy or other people the enemy and other people and harden their heart against you and sometimes we don't understand that sometimes we don't understand when friends turn on us i know nobody's ever had that happen before here but we don't understand it people are supposed to be loyal to us people are supposed to be supportive of us we have that happen i want to say another thing that happened last sunday not just physical healing but some person shared a very close intimate thing about a room in their h in their heart that they hadn't given to god and it was very descriptive and i ca she kept ignoring it and the holy spirit come and just spoke said just bring jesus in that room she said i got victor i i i don't know how old she is but 30 40 years old i don't all these years i had that little room and she said i got victory in the service it was done a lot of you have little rooms in your heart you won't let anybody go there including the lord and then gideon gets up just after and sings the song jesus is in in the room is that the name of it i feel jesus in the room right after the lord spoke that to her then he says i feel jesus in the room god's doing things friends it's not just physical healing it's healing of the heart you hang around long enough around here you're going to hear a preacher that preaches about the heart because we hide things many times and the prophet and the discernment lines many times it wasn't physical healing they needed it was a emotional healing and they're hiding things and the devil's got them bound right in that place in their heart past history whatever it is it doesn't matter to me what it is you've got to get to the bottom and trust and say lord i welcome you in that room because you're the only one that can change it can i get an amen from someone so now here we have god hardening other people's hearts to move israel to destroy the enemy and when god wants you to finish something off that's in between you and the promise the purpose of god he may increase the pressure by hardening their heart toward you other people becoming more hard other people becoming more hard what an influence this can be on your life when other people get hardness of heart towards you what an influence that can be on you you didn't get hardened but they're hard hearts and that can be make an influence on your life can you say amen i encourage you don't hang around that don't hang around that type of people it'll rub off on you but god here the mystery of it is god hardens other people's hearts and we talked about pharaoh did god harden pharaoh's heart and i was just thinking about that last night god you know israel wanted to be delivered by the prophet and so pharaoh fought it pharaoh fought it and we had these different miracles that moses showed to prove god was and went back and forth it's because god was working on pharaoh's heart to make this thing more glory that goes to god that when israel left they knew it would be a supernatural thing it wasn't just it just it was in other words it wasn't an easy thing pharaoh wasn't just going to say all right well just go then just go he wasn't going to be that easy and it was god who was hard in his heart to not make it easy that's how much he loves you nothing's easy in this life remember the prophet saying last night i was listening here at the church and he says we he says we have more pressure than we've ever had and the devil is many times harder to fight against in this age than any other age and he he talks about the enemy coming in and pressuring more and more and more and and we see then god hardening pharaoh's heart to make it he says life isn't going to be life isn't going to be easy and he says you already have tension when you're out there in the world without the lord before the lord the world is full of tension pressures financial pressures all that and he says when you become a christian you just add that much more to the pressure we thought it would be less but he says now you enter a phase that you're walking on pins and needles because you want to please the lord so you're watching every step i want to be a good testimony i want to please the lord that can be a pressure but don't think of it out about a pressure too much it's a privilege to serve the lord but anybody who's telling you that it's easy life to live a sanctified life before the lord all those that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution anybody who's telling you that this is an easy life i got some land to sell you you see what i'm saying anybody who who's trying to sell that is selling the wrong christianity because god hardened pharaoh's heart if he can harden pharaoh's heart who thought he was a god he can harden anybody's heart in your life right now to make it not so easy on you that you'll rise to the occasion not be influenced by that and say i'm gonna go take the enemy and i'm going to go take my promises anyway imagine this israel i thought this was going to be easy and he says now pharaoh comes to a place after a certain time says okay just go go i don't want you to just go i think ten commandments just you can go now and they get going and they get down the journey and god hardens pharaoh's heart again nope changed my mind anybody ever been around a person like that one day they love you one day they support you and for some reason the next day changed my mind i don't like you anymore i don't support what you're doing anybody had people like that in your life maybe it's to challenge you are you going to go on the whims of the emotions of somebody who's one day up and one day down and one day they're hardened so much against the messages against god and the next day that oh maybe it's all okay and they're up and down like a roller coaster you cannot let your emotions be affected by the hardened heart of someone else and pharaoh did that when they went out they came back you see they went out and pharaoh said no i changed my mind back and forth back and forth i like you i don't like you okay go and get your land the next day i changed my mind i like you i don't like you back and forth the other day i was at the ymca and this old older lady i kind of like to go to a certain section there because they're all older than me and she says talk talk talk it's eight in the morning she's just talking talking tons so friendly so nice just going on and on and on i just told my daughter later i said you know sometimes you like a little bit of quietness she had a lot to talk about and every day it's that way i see her talking talking but for some reason that first day she just said he asked me about pastoring and the covet and the decisions through cope and all that so friendly the next day i just was smiling i said hello good morning to you she didn't even say good morning she looked the other way and every day she will not say hello she won't even address that i walked up there and said now friends i just it's kind of a crazy example but listen we're human beings and you can't help but wonder what did i do wrong i got the same gym outfit i'm the same guy that was here yesterday you were so friendly and so open and so nice to me and now you won't even say hello it can play with your mind what did i do and a lot of times you didn't do anything it's just people it's like what in the world where are they at what's going on up and down and up and down am i talking to anybody you do people do that in your life family members one day they're up one day they're down listen you got enough of that in your life sometimes you don't need to live on the emotions of where people at and you don't where people are at and you don't need to draw your confidence and your credibility and your peace from the up and down emotions of others you need to stand sure-footed on the promise of god that's where god wants you to stand and let it be a motivator to you i'm going on with the lord anyway i'm going to take my promises anyway and pharaoh's hearts and let's bring up the last one is when they were so rejoicing and then they get down to the red sea and the red sea was okay you know that was fine but then they get to the red sea because they were so happy and they were so excited and they got so much faith and they get to the red sea and the thing is is that this big swing of emotions where god is with us we got a prophet here everything's going so good we're marching out pharaoh let us go how many has ever testified of something god is with me my look at the super action oh god look at moses look how poor if it's and we're out here now we're going to the promised land praise the lord how many has ever had you testify and all of a sudden everything swings around as if and i'm here to tell you it's a test because nobody promised you that that testimony was just going to continue on you're going to not have any more trouble nobody promised you that and they're there at the red sea and they're already wondering what's going now they start to wonder what's going to go on now we're stuck here and they look back and see a cloud of dust coming and it's pharaoh who's changed his mind because god hardened his heart their god that the pillar of fire and moses the prophet their same god is over there working on pharaoh's heart to harden his heart and say i'm going after him now and here they are coming you talk about the swing of emotions i thought god was with us i thought the prophet was true i thought i could trust this prophet anybody see the little laced comments i'm making here there are things the devil had concocted for people of this message to make them question the authority of a prophet and make them question whether this is true or not it's a test so the up and down lord what are we going to do now and that's when those god had to come to moses because even he's crying he's crying after the lord the children of israel crying what what lord we don't understand this we can't make heads or tales of this and they're crying and they're weeping and god comes down and says to moses why cry speak and go forward so god did that as a test so they would be driven to their crying but he wants them to grow out of their crying can you say man he would have rather them said at that moment you know what we've come this far god supernaturally brought us this far i don't care that pharaoh's coming with his army right now we're right on the verge of something really good happening we're not going to cry we're not going to complain we're going to look to god and say lord what do you want us to do because the same god that brought us out of egypt will get us out of this that's what he wants to hear out of your lips can you say a matter he wants to hear faith he wants you to grow up then you're a people for the promised land can you imagine these people already complaining they got to go take the enemy out of the promised land yet they're not ready at all god hardens people's hearts to test you and he said why are you crying unto me i gave you a commission i told you what to do i've given you the commission hasn't changed nothing's changed moses you can take those people over the promised land nothing has changed even though you're seeing pharaoh's oh god help me to say this right nothing has changed in the promises of god if somebody hardens their heart towards you if somebody persecutes you if somebody does you wrong nothing's changed as far as your promises nothing's changed as far as god's love for you situations people hardened people people that are treating you wrong and yesterday they treated you right but you've got to stand there and say but nothing has changed in god's love for me nothing has changed in my position in the holy ghost i am a son and daughter of god and none of that up and down emotions changes where i stand with him [Music] can i get it amen that's what you need to hear today this week when it hits and somebody turns on you nothing has changed in my position in christ and this red sea in this pharaoh's army is not a problem for the lord something good is fixing to happen like sherry sings when nothing but a miracle will do there are some spots that we hid that we had we have to have a miracle nothing else we'll do and that's when you need to be saying you know what this is really good because i'm at a spot right now for god to really do something big can you say amen i'm right at that moment when nothing but a miracle will do nothing less than a miracle of god you're standing there and you're saying that god i'm i'm expecting it opens up the red sea oh okay i see that's how he's gonna do it they start running down there they get on the other side can you say amen and they look back and all affairs army just washes with all their chariots whoo glory be to god praise god i shouldn't have cried i should have just spoke and went forward i'm learning quit crying during the trial quit crying over people hurting you quit crying over a preacher who hurt you years ago stop crying speak and go forward stop crying over people that have done you wrong stop crying that things are not turning out the way that you thought stop crying speak and go forward they get washed in the red sea and it's like they're standing in all put yourself in the shoes of those children of israel brother standing there and the entire pharaoh and his army washed in the sea put yourself there and they're just standing silent until miriam says give me the tambourine i can't find it because the musicians hide it from me she said give me the tambourine i will sing unto the lord for he has triumphed gloriously the horse and the rider get thrown into the sea everybody i will sing unto the lord for he has triumphed gloriously the horse and the rider get thrown into the sea can't hear me back there i will sing unto the lord for he has triumphed gloriously the horse and the rider get shone into the sea thrown into the sea and she starts to dance and moses started to dance and the children of israel began to dance and they just had a hallelujah breakdown so praise the lord for that praise god but what i'm trying to preach is let's let it be the joshua commission attitude ahead of time that doesn't cry about the hardness of heart and how are the people who treated you but it speaks and i'm going to go forward if you don't get nothing else today i'm asking the question you could come on my office today and tell me your story and everybody has a story and i'm not belittling that story at all there are hurts and the pains that i would have never dreamed satan could do to people even in this message and i would listen and i would pray with you but there comes a point comes a point that you have to stop crying and speak and go forward with the lord only you can make that choice i'm going forward i'm getting past this i'm getting past my past and the only thing i look at now is the future pull that quote up if you guys got it as i close god trains his men then anoints them gives them experience takes them through the rigid training down through the sands of burning punishment trying testing not only does he do that to his prophets but he does it to his children every son that cometh to god must be chastened and tried tested by his word so when the pinch come the strong time when it faces death are you able to stand there on the word of god say god said so that settles it and god had called such a man and that man was moses but moses a great deal like us every time it come to a place to something had to be done moses called out oh lord what must i do in this place now isn't that just like we do god had blessed him anointed him above his brethren give him a message and a ministry that had not been on the earth since that day until that day and yet every time something taken place moses run off to god by the lord what must i do what must i do in this case god kind of got tired of it wow and maybe maybe he gets tired he loves you to qualify that his love doesn't change if he got tired of a prophet coming and doing that does he get tired of you doing it because he tired of you and your circles it just keeps going round and round and corrupt communication comes out of your mouth and that's just old conversations and old hurts and pains and just in that circle i wonder if god gets tired of it god got tired of it i believe and said why are you crying to me speak to the people and go forward my if any time ever looked like ought to retreat was then but god has no retreat god has no retreat say that with me god has no retreat god is only leading you one direction and that's forward he will never justify you going back to the past that's why paul said forgetting those things which are behind i pressed toward the mark of the high calling great you'll never find the holy ghost leading you back into the past into a pity party it's always to speak and go forward there's no place to retreat in god we go forward the doctor says it's cancer go forward if he says it's tb go forward if the devil says you can't give this up go forward if your home says that you're going to be a fanatic go forward the turn the church turns you out go forward amen only one direction there's no retreating back go forward speak and go forward with his word and go forward thus saith the lord and move on how many believe you do you have thus saith the lord what more do you need than that he had thus saith the lord in your life it's his word he said it and there's one direction the lord wants to take you and that's forward end up can you say amen forward is up to the lord this bride is headed for a rapture this pride's heading in what direction but what all the stuff that's done you can't stop the promise of god you can't stop that from happening it's going forward he has a church they're going to be transformed by the word and they are having it happen now there will be a rapture there will be a change of our bodies there will be a heaven there will be a day as gabriella and gideon saying we shall behold him face to face can you say amen hold on to those promises that's where we're headed can you say man don't look where we come from don't look where we are today look where we're going blessed be his name do you love him today let's stand and worship the lord let's give him a handclap of praise thank you lord thank you lord don't let people with hardened hearts keep in between you and the promises go beyond it break the sound baby say lord i'm moving on break the sound barrier i'm moving on and though it's a struggle i'm moving on i'm separating from those that are negative and i'm moving on with the lord no matter what i want to move on with him and take a hold of his promise i want to hang her how many want to hang around those that are already inheriting the promises a lot of people here a lot of people here that's there they're they're taking them get around people like that god in his grace i know god has given us the victory mickey i know god has given us the victory by his word by the power of his might oh god has given us the victory oh victory oh victory [Music] god has given us the victory their second one has given us the peace of mind that's our promise god has given us his peace of mind by the word i saw the light by his power of his mind oh god has given us the peace of mind peace has given us his peace has given [Music] has given us overwhelming oh god has given us overwhelming joy by the power of his might of his mind oh god has given us [Applause] given us [Music] is there any more verses there oh god has given us the victory disclaimer today friends god has given us the victory [Music] yes the victory victory yes victory has given us the victory [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah [Music] can we bow our heads and pray they can just play something softly i think you shouldn't leave this building without just speaking to the lord ourselves saying god is there something in between me and your promises there's something in the past i hang on to a little room something you can come and be in that room and take control of lordship of my life [Music] when you harden other people's hearts lord do i accept it or do i fight against it do i get angry too does my heart get hardened too or can i grow lord to stand and say possibly lord you harden their hearts possibly you made them more angry at me so that i'd learned my lesson i learned to stand on faith learn to stop crying speak and go forward we know this is a reality today father we know it's a reality that you can harden other people's hearts against us lord maybe you work on the other side because you have our victory in mind you have our glorious victory and our possession that we're to take you have that in mind remember paul saying that our chastening is for good fathers of the earth chasing their son for their own benefit lord you chasing us for you for our good for our benefit or that we can be a partaker of your righteousness so lord let me not question let me not give over lord to the negative of other people the negative on the internet the crowd mentality the hanging with the wrong ones buying into being influenced by it let me come under the influence of the word of god and under the influence of the presence of the lord how many would raise your hand and say let me be more influenced by the presence of the lord and by his word let me be under that influence not what i'm under thank you bless them father take that heart behind the hand and lead them as a shepherd out of their defeat out of their status quo to a greater walk with you it's my desire lord as a pastor to see this word more and more living in the people in their victory of their lives that you've given them calvary purchased its lord calvary gave it to us may we take it with all of our heart forgive us of our sins forgive us of our failures forgive us when we fall short lord put a faith within us that would rise and say i want to be different than i was when i come in here today i want to be better i want to be a better christian i want to walk with you closer lord i realize today that i may have to get past my past and get past others that are up and down and wishy-washy in their treatment of me i may have to pull away from some associates that just keeps influencing me to do or say things that i shouldn't say i may have to pull away from them and they're going to look down on me if i do that lord i'm willing to do it if it means being closer to you draw closer to my wife go closer to my husband remove the hindrances and distractions draw closer to my family draw closer to the lord maybe even draw closer to the saints of god in my own assembly granted father help us lord not to be islands but to really choose good atmospheres and good fellowship and good places to be we have that choice lord i thank you for what you have done last sunday and this sunday lord i thank you for the power of god i thank you that you're able to show even the youngest child by your presence that you're real that you care that you love us lord i thank you that you want to show yourself mighty father help us today as we dismiss the service let there be the change and transformation of the holy ghost in our lives lord the only time we cry out to you would be that we need you there's nothing wrong with crying when we need you lord [Music] god help us to have a faith in boldness that we're not continually to cry over our problems but we overcome them lord we stand christian shows his love for god by conducting himself with joy in the midst of his trials such a high task it seems like but lord that's what we want to be i thank you father we give you glory to your name in jesus name amen amen god bless you if you need prayer just come forward this morning and i'm going to sing that chorus that gideon's saying i feel like going on and i want that to be your testimony as you leave this morning i feel like going on i feel like going on not going backwards i feel like moving forward
