I want to say that next Sunday we won't have a Tri-State because of the kids days coming up so we won't have that until next but next month but we got quite a few good ones coming up brother Danny steaman will be with us in July brother Daryl Ward is coming and then brother Chris Barrette so we had some good a good lineup of ministers there coming in for those weekends and we're looking forward to that I'm reading from psalms 27 this morning from the word of God together if you have your Bibles the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life is he the strength of your life if he's the strength of Your Life whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell though a whole should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me in this will I be confident one thing I have desired of the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life I'll tell you this experience with the Lord and where David wanted to live it's not a one year at Camp's experience it's not once a week at church he said this is the one thing I desire in my life and that is I'd seek after this and that's to dwell in the presence of the Lord every day of my life can you say Amen and so and to behold the beauty of the Lord to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yea I will sing praises unto the Lord amen heavenly father I believe that's what we've just done is sing praises to you Lord and we know there's an enemy encamped around us we know there's an extreme trouble in this hour we live in but Lord to be able to come in your house and express ourselves to you Lord is just a joy to us today and so we'll offer those sacrifices of Joy before you and Lord you've done something deep in our hearts and we have something to thank you for something to worship you for and I just pray you'll bless every heart and soul that's here today from the youngest child to the oldest those who are listening online those who would listen on the broadcast I pray father that you would if there's a seed there may it respond to the word of God I pray and God we pray you take the anointing and bring it in the service today use my lips of clay father God help me to get out of the way so that your presence and your spirit your character can be the image in front of the people today we trust in you we believe Lord you have something for us and we commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you maybe see this morning I want to speak a little bit out of Psalms 27 and I want to title this hide me in this time of trouble hide me in this time of trouble David is the only one that used this term four or five times in his writings besides job and he just says those words hide me and he asked God God hide me hide me and I'm only one of the reasons I'm preaching this is because that's why that's the way I have felt lately and that is Lord just hide me just hide me there's a certain protection can you say amen and so he asked the Lord but I I was looking at it uh the last couple days and it seems a bit mysterious if you don't understand why David is saying hide me it seems a bit mysterious because we know that David is a warrior David was a fighter David from his very young years as a teen was had faith in God and he wasn't afraid of anything he proved himself to be unafraid of the enemy since he was a little boy so if we were to use the context of him saying Lord hide me my enemies are encamped about me hide me it doesn't seem like it's the right thing for David to say because he doesn't look like somebody that would hide from the enemy he actually ran towards Goliath he didn't have a problem of being afraid of the enemy and it just seems mysterious that he would say Lord hide me from the enemy they're encamped about me and and there's and there's this I I feel it moving in and approaching them to me kind of like we feel in the time we live in and so he but you see we we don't have the impression from David's life that he was one that would be one that would run from the enemy or to hide and and yet he's asking the Lord hide me Lord hide me yet it is not running away or it's not being scared in other words he's not saying hide me because he's afraid because he said at the beginning To Whom Shall I Fear I don't fear anything he says the Lord is my strength of whom shall I be afraid he's not saying hide me because he's afraid he's not saying it because he's wanting to run from the enemy that's not David and yet it is not a running away or a scared he's he says he is not afraid uh To Whom Shall I Fear I'm not afraid he said in this will I be confident there's full confidence here there's no fear here but yet we must realize that fear is around him fear is surrounding him can you say Amen uh uh there's there's the enemy surrounding him my foes that were coming to eat my flesh he's being completely surrounded by the enemy and so he's saying hide me not because he's afraid but because if he don't live in that secret place then he's vulnerable to become influenced by this fear praise the Lord so he says I'm confident but he says does hide me that he says let me live in a place that's protected and a place that's higher another place that opens up to me that would be higher than the enemy now but in Psalm 64 2 the way he says it in hide me he says it this way he says hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked from the Insurrection of the workers of iniquity so now we get a little bit more window into what he's saying hiding me from and that is the the secret counsel of the wicked from the Insurrection of workers of iniquity the secret counsel of the wicked in other words hide me don't let me be affected by what's being said about me in private things are being said about from my enemy and that's the secret counsel and things but so now this is something he said hide me from that and I'm just just pondering this morning with you why would he say hide me from that I'm going to bring this out if I can why is David saying hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked I wonder if this hide me is not so much is is not so much protection from a regular war or arrows that are coming at him uh he wouldn't be afraid of that but maybe what he will hear that is being said about him and what he would hear being said about him might affect him a little bit and that would influence him and may influence him out of this place of protection uh just bear with me as I just lay these foundations maybe he hide me means that I don't want to be affected affected by what's being said about me I'm just preaching this because this is the way I'm feeling lately before the Lord God just hide me I just feel like um lately I just feel like I'm trying to stay out of the line of fire has anybody ever felt that that way you know just don't say too much because if you say something if you say too much it can and will be used against you in the court of law and that's how the enemy is can you say man you can have the best intentions and say something it gets twisted by the enemy can I get an amen and so it kind of makes you on edge is that I'm just trying to stay out of the line of fire things being shot at me things being said that's how David felt this is all through the book of Psalms where he talks about the enemy and things coming at him and his enemy what they're saying about him and so David had to live in another place David had to live in a higher place because why words can affect us the enemy's attacks can affect us especially if we have a lot of complexes the enemy abuses those things so he wanted to live in a higher place that he wasn't affected or brought down by that and he was saying hi me it hide me from those things God just hired me and sometimes it's safer not to say anything or the devil can twist it and I just want to be I don't know about you but in this last stage where there's such a and I'll talk about this in a minute just such a a pressure such a pressure and such enemy power against Christians I just want to be a simple Christian with no guile and no pretense I just want to be nice and I do that and I still can't do things right job is the only other man who said hide me and he says it this way which is to me a mystery behind it Job 14 13 says oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest keep me secret until thy wrath be passed that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me now I want to elaborate on this because all that job went through this is what he says in all that he's gone through on Earth he said hide me in the grave in other words there's a lot of pressure he went through a lot of losses he had in this life but he had a revelation of Resurrection how many know that job had a revelation of Resurrection how many know that job was not afraid of the grave he's not afraid of the Grave he's not afraid of dying because he knows the grave is not the end for him he's got a revelation that if I go there it's not the end it's actually just the beginning and I will end this life someday I will end the pressure here someday and if I'm putting that grave to hide there that's a good place for a Christian to hide because God's going to come and pull me out of that grave someday hide me in the grave till thy wrath be passed and so you know he understood the judgments of God how many understand that we're living in the pre-judgments of God right now we're living in pre-tribulation it can't fully set in until the bride is gone but don't tell me that we're not experiencing prejudgments pre-tribulation pre-plagues that are hitting the Earth we're just on the verge of the wrath of God being Unleashed on this Earth on the perversion on the Rebellion to God we're uh we're living in the very on the verge of it happening because we live in Pre some diseases have already started can you say man we're in pre-tribulation right now it's upon us now and the Death Angel is already in the land that's what he said in the token the death angel is in the land today it's not a physical death it's a spiritual death it's after your children it's after your families it's after anything spiritual like it was that night in Egypt can you say man the death angel was passing through all of Israel and only if there was the token the blood on the door did the death angel passed it and the prophet said the death angel is already in the land today okay that's why people are spiritually dying people you thought were stable spiritually dying well the death angel is in the land and unless you have the token the Holy Ghost it's not going to pass you it's not going to just pass your family because you go to a message Church the death angel is not going to pass your family up just because you go to a message church it's out to get our families it's out to divide our families it's out to divide us it's out to divide churches people can you say Amen to bring spiritual death that pale horse rider getting ready to run a combination of all three of them Pale Horse death the death rider beginning to run and we're right on the verge of that and so the Wrath coming down getting ready to come and job says hide me in the grave that says a lot there's a mystery behind this that only job knew and that is nobody would ask God to hide me in the grave that's not a place most people on the face of the Earth are saying just hide me in the grave you'd have to have a revelation to ask God hide me in the grave remember revelation of resurrection and rapture to say hide me in the grave and so job has that Revelation and unless they knew people knew that it was some sort of a Hideout and I believe job did not look at it as death he looked at it as kind of a hideout until the resurrection this is what psalms 27 is because the revelation of the Rapture is tied to psalms 27 how many Believers know that psalms 27 is the text that was used for Rapture the revelation of the Rapture is tied to this very mysterious scripture where he says in Psalms 27 what we read read today though and hosted and Camp abound me those fears around me I will not fear I will be confident but Lord I need one thing one thing I desire to dwell wherever you're dwelling I need to be in the secret of your Tabernacle I need to live in that protection can you say Amen and so that's why the prophet used Psalms 27 never refers to it again throughout the sermon but he had to use this scripture because this is the conditions before Rapture there had to be a a hideout there had to be a secret place and if we didn't have it we won't survive laodicea we won't survive the judgments of God we won't survive the conditions we better be real and say without the Holy Spirit and living in his presence none of us have the human capability to survive the times that we're living in right now the quicker some of us raise our hands and be honest about it there's nothing within you that can make it in these times without the Holy Ghost secret place and the quicker we realize that that this is the answer to Rapture time matter of fact you can't get rapturing Faith unless you're in that place that's the room that's the place he gives you Faith because why outside of that is doubt is fear can you say that you're not going to get rapturing Faith by feeding on the things of the world you're not going to get rapturing Faith by feeding on a denominational Creed you're not going to get rapturing Faith by just some nominal Christian thing God has provided the food to bring rapturing Faith to his people in the last days and if you stay outside of the secret place then you realize you don't have the strength teenager I'm going to tell you as your friend and your servant of the Lord you cannot make it in this lustful age without the Holy Ghost your mental capability your willpower it's not good enough for Satan's Eden come on friends can I get a greater amen if you're not good enough there's nothing going to make it except you get in Christ in that place with Christ families are not going to make it without being in this word and being in with Christ marriages are not going to make it without being rooted very heavy in that secret place with Christ where the word is the most important thing in your life I can play around this I can you know what no no it's too much maybe even Luther's day you might have survived it a little bit but in this Satan's Eden it takes this answer to the Rapture to develop rapists it's a developing room can you say Amen you know job thought it was a it was a it's it's a hideout it's a play job never seen it as the end but a hideout a waiting room a green room let me know what everyone knows what a green room is it's the Green Room green room before the big stage event The Green Room is where all the artists go and they waited out before they are invited to the big stage event and to perform praise the Lord so until you're called out on stage you're you know and that's job is in the Green Room waiting to be called for the big Resurrection event praise the Lord everybody he wanted to be hiding until Jesus cried out and there he was all the Old Testament Saints who died in the Lord there they are hiding out in the grave they're hiding in the grave and everybody thought they're dead and they're gone no they're just in the green room waiting to be called on stage and sure enough when Jesus cried out with a loud voice there was a power behind his voice of resurrection and the Bible says they come out of the green room and they showed themselves in the city streets of Jerusalem their life wasn't over the great what the grave wasn't the end they were just hiding out there hide me appearing now the Bride of Jesus Christ on stage and if she goes to the Grave she's waiting in the green room because it's gonna how many knows it's going to happen again how many knows there's a voice of Resurrection how many knows there's a shout for the rapture Jesus said the shout Paul said to shout the voice and the Trump the three phases of the Rapture that means that we're already in the cycle of it shout the voice of the Resurrection the same voice that called the Saints out of the Grave is the same voice that's here now the message ended up being the shout ended up being something different we ever thought from a Pentecostal View and here he presents it the shout is a message and a prophet to gather the people together so we're already in the cycle of it now we're looking for that voice of the Resurrection which will be in The Bride of Jesus Christ she's the Earthly body on Earth something's going to happen in her to trigger the resurrection oh I can't wait friends and then the last Trump the last Trump a lot of people thought when this president got in president Trump that was it that was the last trump it was a type it was a type as I said the prophet never commented back to his texts in the Rapture back to psalms 27 never he never mentioned it again it seems like it don't fit but it fits perfectly for several reasons one is that David said hide me in the secret of his dwelling place and that types with the Rapture or that links with the Rapture because we know this he says put me in not your Tabernacle not your Pavilion the secret of your Tabernacle the Rapture also is a secret can you say Amen so that ties together perfectly with the Rapture because we're talking about a secret place secret place uh when you have a secret place it means that not everybody knows where it is not everybody knows where it is or not everybody is called to that secret place uh it's a place that God develops us for rapturing Faith it's a place secretly it has to be a place why because all around is doubts and fears and questions all around us is doubts and fears and questions and Satan messing with absolutes all the time Satan closing in on us with his doubts you can't get more rapturing faith when you're being destabilized by Demons of Doubt let me say it again you can't get rapturing Faith to get out of here when you're exposing yourself online on social media to all kinds of doubt you'll never get rapturing Faith from those sources and if you expose yourself too much to it you'll find yourself doubting because that's all that produces it'll never bring rap string faith preaching some Creed will never bring Rapture in faith going back to Pentecost will never bring rapturing Faith but God has provided the place that he will preach rapturing Faith to his people he will Rapture his people how many want to be raptured amen but you need rapturing Faith Rapture is a revelation I need that Revelation above any revelation amen so God will provide it so the next scripture though even though the prophet does not mention psalms 27 the next scripture and now I'm going to get into this just a little bit deeper the next scripture he mentions in the service is the one in in the New Testament that says in the last days concerning the coming of the Lord scoffers will come scoffers and he takes that and elaborates on it scoffers just before the coming of the Lord and during the midst of the coming scoffers will rise up and you know what they're scoffing at not just that you're a Christian we always get that but they're scoffing the promise of the rapture they're scoffing the coming of the Lord they're scoffing and making fun of this promise that you believe you're saying Amen to this morning you're saying I believe I'm a part of it they're scoffing they're making fun of that they say where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers came all things continue just as they are that's what the world says that's a lot of times what in the Christian church says that's doesn't mean anything that that that doesn't mean nothing and so now we have a doubting we have scoffers that are scoffing the promise the very promise that we believe can you say Amen so if we have a day of scoffers then the whole thing is mocking and questioning that whole question where is the promise of his coming the questions where is the Vindication for all of this where is the Vindication that he's going to send a prophet oh I can't get my mind wrapped around it to think that the very answer for this age is a prophet and that's the thing that gets mocked denominational Creeds and Dogma sense missed one of the most crucial principles of the Bible and it's the Amos 3 7 principle it's the one man principle surely the Lord God will do nothing except he revealeth his secrets to his servants the prophets and that principle is All Through the Bible God's mouthpiece and all of a sudden some Theory says yes we believe it all through the Bible but today God doesn't do it that way he comes through our denomination he comes through a group of people no he begins his process of visiting his people by using the mouth of a prophet the Forerunner to the first coming of Christ was one man John the Baptist with the spirit of Elijah it wasn't many men it was one man and that principles throughout the Bible say well where's it at in the New Testament well it was Paul because Paul you see he wasn't just an apostle he was a prophet okay see well he was just one of the Apostles and one time I was talking to somebody I don't like to get into this too much but I just want to mention to you that somebody was saying no no this prophet of this day no it's not that it's not that it's just Jesus and these things and so I I said to him this is many many years ago so I'm not talking about anybody here I was I was saying to him then what about Paul and I realized he had to say that Paul wasn't a prophet going with that Regular Baptist type of theory is that he wasn't probably he was just one of the Apostles he had to go that direction because if you say a Paul is a prophet then you got to believe that there's New Testament prophets and he couldn't go there so he said no no he wasn't a problem he was just an apostle I said wait a minute now wait that's not scripture at all we know that Paul was a prophet wrote 14 books in the New Testament and so you asked the question how do you give him that much Authority as the Canon of scriptures to where even Paul said he said you're taking the things the Believers are taking things that I'm saying as the Commandments of the Lord as the very word of God how do you do that with Paul because it's the Canon of scriptures but you you give yourself authority to eliminate it as a possibility today can't do that it it's Satan messing with absolutes is Satan messing with the Bible leave it alone just believe it can you say man believe it the way God says it can you say Amen so this mocking of things is also mocking what happens in end times events and also especially the promise of the Rapture the coming of the Lord mocking the coming of the Lord and just before Rapture our promised we realize that there's an increased intensity of pressure and trouble and that's why I'm pulling out that word out psalms 27 the time in the time of trouble in the time of trouble how many believe we're in the time of trouble in the time of trouble I need you to hide me in the time of trouble there is a great intensity of the enemy be being encamped around the people of God in the time of trouble there will be a lot of trouble we we ask the Lord to hide us because we don't want to be caught in the trouble it's it's Pride to say that I won't be caught in all this trouble you have the vulnerability to be caught in the trouble around you you have the the humanness The Human Side the fleshly side of you if you feed on things enough you will be caught in the web just like everybody else is caught in the web of pornography of adultery of Family Division you'll be caught in that world because you're vulnerable to it you'll be caught in it yourself but God gives us an escape God gives us a place out and so in the time of trouble is when he's saying would you please Lord hide me there's no need for us to hide unless there's danger all around can you say Amen amen why is David saying hide me Lord hide me because there's danger all around him if you don't realize there's danger all around you and that it could affect you then you're not asking Lord hide me hide me hide me in that rock put me on that rock he's saying lift me above my enemies in the time of trouble please hide me he wouldn't be asking that unless there's danger all around the time of trouble if you don't see there's danger around then you don't see the value of that secret place we need to be hidden away with Christ the Bible says also that we live in perilous times testing times can you say Amen besides all the spirits and Hell being unloosed around Unleashed around us besides the lustful Spirits the perverted Spirits all these things surrounding us it's a time of trouble but then the Bible says in the last days there will be perilous times that means testing time we're vulnerable outside of his daily protection there is a hedge from the spirit of this world there's a protection from the spirit of this world is safety in Jesus Christ the word can you say Amen do I need to be more specific demon power do I need to be more specific if you don't think that you walk out of here and you're living in a dangerous time then let me be more specific demon demonic power from hell can be in music demonic power can be in movies it can be in tick tock it can be in books it can be in social media it can be on YouTube if you're growing up as a Christian right that you realize that that we're living in a spiritual Battle of things that we can't see and so something that you feed on too much you could take a spirit so quickly and not even see that you took it that's the danger that we live in and and I can't I can't come with you every day and watch over you and some of you kids growing up your parents can't watch over you every waking minute they can't see all the time what's on your phone and so danger danger danger when you get older danger danger not because your parents is warning your or your preachers getting right in the face warning you it's danger not because I said it it's danger because the Demonic power that's against your life it's a dangerous time so you're not going to take a loose attitude towards a dangerous time I wish I'd never given my kids a phone at whatever it was 14 15 years old I wish I'd have set the age at like 30. yeah good luck with that because I didn't realize till later on that just like brother Brandon said about TV said it could have been a great instrument for the kingdom of God and in some ways today it is being used that way could have been a great the devil got a hold of it becomes the worst place for trash and demonic power to come across you ever heard about a movie years ago in in the 80s called Poltergeist it's about demons it's all the way back in the 80s and the inspiration comes to some director and he pegs demons come into somebody's house so this is the story of the movie demons come into the household and then because because the little girl sitting and the TV after midnight goes into this fuzzy what do you call that huh static whatever and she's watching this during the night late when the kids have gone to bed and that all of a sudden through that brings demons into that home and they suffer in that home with demonic power for months and months and months and they don't know what's going on but they started it came through the TV there's a movie saying this out there completely blatant about it and saying exactly what the prophet said in the 50s and 60s so here it is and so now they go through months if I they can't get them out they can't do that they're haunting them every night this is and I not encourage you at all to watch it for sure because they'll bring demonic power in your home but you see now it's it's real it's real but it started with that and so now it gets to the end of it and you know they had to almost destroy that entire house they had to move they could not get them out had no power of God to do it so they couldn't they had to move I think they even just if I remember right they destroyed the entire house and everything went to a motel with their family and the last I didn't expect to say this today but this is this is good the last scene of the movie is dad takes the TV in the motel and rolls it out to the sidewalk and shuts the door of the motel and that's the last scene because daddy realized that's how it all got started now it's hard to preach these things today because it's not popular because I know there's a lot of integrated stuff my family and I every once in a while we if we have a a nice evening which is very rare we have time to do it but we'll watch a decent thing this new chosen series all these we like is something decent I let the kids watch VeggieTales when they're young it's not that we didn't have a video in a monitor and a a TV in our home because of that but it was very restricted what came through that screen and a lot of it was because I read things like that years ago this is real the prophet isn't knocking the women's dress just to be happy he's not knocking TVs he's just he's deserting as a prophet where this television and phone and Technology who's in charge somebody needs to say Amen don't be vulnerable this is a dangerous time to live in and that's why David said this is dangerous the enemy is not out there he's encamped right up to my door and so what am I saying hide me hide Me Lord let me become so hidden in Christ that the devil doesn't know where to find me is this okay with everybody today hide me Lord hide me because of the danger that's around me so he's honest and saying if you don't hide me I'll be affected by what's around me I'll be affected by what people say about me amen praise the Lord demonic power can be in those things last days minships here we go in the last days testing time because men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous vultures proud disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truce Breakers false accusers this is all the last day's stuff true spankers promise Breakers false accusers despisers of those that are good incontinent Unholy and oh with all that hello having a form of godliness Christians Christians that don't have the Holy Ghost and all these manifestations of the last days are all there that's a dangerous time that's the last days as well in the last days they'll mock the promise of God they'll mock it on the internet they'll mock it they'll mock this message it's it's a mocking time it's things being set against it to to to try to produce fate a lack of faith in your life so having said all that uh you know plus is the form of godness and I don't want to forget always what he says at the end of all that from such turn away that sentence has more power in it than all the rest from such all that turn away nah I think I'm hung around that guy at work because I want to witness to him and I want to hang around them a bit try to save them I'll go with them to the bar because I just need to hang around them and do some missionary work the Bible said from such turn away and if they're hungry for if you're living the life of Christ filled with the spirit if they're hungry they're going to thirst for that they're going to start asking you questions I'm gonna I'm gonna witness to them and time after time I'm gonna go help this person because they're they're having that they're going through this time and they go help them and that Spirit turns them around because they're not strong they don't have the solid Christ in their life yet so they think they can handle it but they're vulnerable they're in a dangerous spot Dangerous Ground run into a safe place that's what David said I want to run the name of the Lord is a strong tower we're in the righteous run into it and are safe a host is encamped around us that's why David is writing for our day this is the rapture scripture for our day because the environment is everything now I'll just take this a bit further just for a short few minutes here there's an incident that you're familiar with many of you if you're not that's why I say these things because some people are not familiar with it but I want I want you to notice that the the everything around us is not just neutral in the sense that they're just living their own lives but it has a an agenda with it it has a spirit added to it to influence you to pull you and drag you down it's not neutral can you say Amen and and so in a great example of that of course is something that we had a few years ago we had um homosexual Spirit come upon a boy in the church he'd actually had it for years we didn't realize it then we'd be gonna pick up on it a brother was picking up on it there's a couple dreams Holy Ghost working in the church and so now then it manifests itself and me going through that trying to help this boy just a little bit what helped he let me give him I realized with that spirit and then as you read the news articles that that spirit is never uh good enough to go off and leave the congregation and leave everybody and go find some Mountain to live with all the rest of the homosexuals not going to happen it has something with it that it wants to stay around and so I found that in scripture when I realized the sodomites were knocking on lot's door so it's like go go over there on your side of town and just do your thing okay I'll respect you okay I'll respect you I don't agree with you I'll pray for your deliverance but go over there no no knocking on Lord's door so I realized this is the thing and so dealing with this then we realized that he wanted to continue as normal and these are other incidents that continue to hang around the young people and hang around and at Christmas time wanted to just you know and it's like no I know and I'm asked to give counselors no you can't do that and then you know what happens to that Spirit then you you block it off and you say no you can't we have to separate from this because your choices then your Christianity comes into examination Your Love Of Christ comes into question you know I've been serving the lord since I was 16 film of the Holy Ghost was 16 years old and if I have the Holy Ghost I have the love of Christ and now after 30 years my love of Christ is being brought in question like how do you have the authority to do that where did you get the authority because it's an arrogant Spirit it knows everything I couldn't understand the news broadcast the other day when uh fox or somebody they had this guy on who was a homosexual and he was very critical of the trans and he was saying we shouldn't make our kids do this and change all this that's wrong it's it's it's it's cruel to children and I'm going why is this homosexual an authority on the subject now like get him out of there he's of The Same Spirit as I tell you friends don't mess with my mind I tell the word quit messing this is a messed up world this is a messed up world I must speak in a few weeks on a few weeks on insanity and insanity is not somebody in an asylum today it's just the form of thinking that we have today that's insane thank God I've got a place to go over a sound mind in a secret place thanks be to God that's all I want I just want to live there I don't want to take the theories that I'm hearing can you say amen and even sometimes bring them up because they're feeding on the wisdom of the world and they're bringing it up you don't live by business by family life you don't live by the wisdom of this world there's a wisdom of God the wisdom of this world is contrary to the wisdom of God don't live by it don't try I'm gonna go to all these seminars and not go to God's word for your business the wisdom of this world is in a conflict to the wisdom of God so that Spirit began to work I didn't expect to say this but it was something that was attached that it was why I I want you to accept me and I want the congregation to accept me and then I just have to say well there's some new congregations out that will accept you so you can go there but I want them to I want people to tolerate it and if you don't accept me at least tolerate me being here and then get around the youth and uh can't happen people get mad sometimes because I just say hey you know we're not going to have that are you going to keep doing that we're not going to have that around the youth group I'm supposed to do that scripture I'm supposed to be that way then I get parents mad at me you say where's the parents at that's my job can you say Matt to protect the people of God protect these young lives these young girls have held their virginity and they've held them and they ought to be able to come to a safe place at a youth meeting they ought to be a safe environment here can you say that so you preach against demon power and if you have to say it personally you're not welcome here until you get delivered to that spirit so the prophet in in relation to this he went to Portland Oregon and he says and many of you has read the story of the maniac I don't have this on the sides I was just going to tell this story in case you don't know it uh the maniac comes to the platform and just as this great big almost 300 pound giant I wait at that time 128 pounds myself and he was close to seven foot great big arms and he comes stomping through the building while I was preaching on faith before about six thousand people raised up to the platform preachers scattered like flies and I wonder what was the matter I thought it might have been someone coming to bring a message to some ministers I turned to look in this great big giant standing there with his chest swelled out and groaning and his teeth sat in his eyes he said you hypocrite up there acting like a man of God I'll break every bone in your body tonight I'm going to knock you Plum out of the middle of this audience to show you whether you're a man of God little did I know that he was out of the insane institution and I Knew by his size he was very able to carry out his threat so I looked at him ordinarily I would have took off with the rest of those preachers but you know what something happened to me now you know the story and he tells it many times it must have been a reason he's leaving this with us is that to realize that he challenged the Demonic power that way in a service very hard very embarrassing very hard but this is demonic power and he actually had he had beat up a preacher come out of the and saying snuck out and beat up a preacher just a few days before he was in the news so the police realized who it was they were come when the police come to try to get him they said no said no this is a spiritual battle going on this is not flesh and blood so he told the police to stay and here's this guy's coming for him and he said ordinary I run off with the rest of preachers but you know something happened if I can only always stay that way something instead of hating the man I felt sorry for him I thought that man wouldn't want to hurt me while he's a man like I am and that's got to be the devil making that man do that so the poor martyr and he rushed up towards me and he hawked down in his throat and he spit right in my face a matter of fact did it two or three times hooked up spit right on his face brother and said it was dripping down my my nose you read all the places to me he said he says now if you had any temper in you whatsoever you're not going to get over this something else has to kick in okay and and you know the story that you know he he tells it many not different ways but he he elaborates it in different places and he's up there he said he could have done what he was carried out to do and uh he he says they spit at him and he's threatening and he told the police to hold back and he says something come over he's oh I wish that would come over me all the time I wish I could be that way but I loved him I loved him and I and I I said he no doubt has a family and it changed the whole atmosphere and he rushed up toward me hawked in his throat and spit in my face this is the one I tried so hard to find and pull it out that's what I want to emphasize and see the devil was trying to get me to shake away from that atmosphere that God was getting me in so this is what I'm preaching to you today the devil it's not good enough for him just to accuse and just to come against you and just no he actually wants to pull you from your atmosphere in your secret place into the same atmosphere as him now you think about that when there's a Family Feud that comes in your family and I know nobody here ever ever has family feuds so just act like you have one sometimes we have them it's you know sometimes we have family feuds and it's just the devil gets working among us and we could be on that show Family Feud I believe we could it's just we we have it and I know none of you ever have it but you think about when a Family Feud comes up and all of a sudden there's a scripture in the New Testament says The Strife of words The Strife of Words which brings envy and strife and all kinds of things and he says it starts with words the strife and there's tension it's just everybody's drawing the lines The Strife of words you know the devil doesn't have to come out with a pitchfork he just gets you talking against one another and strife is there and there's walls up and there's clouds between you and you you can't since the devil working can you say man it's just the enemy working but he's trying to get you he would the devil was trying see that's something we wouldn't know unless he said it is that here's the wisdom and just a son move into an adoption that he can look at a demonic power first of all say I don't need the police Uh something's coming over but while something was coming over him he said he could even detect that the devil was trying to shake me away from the atmosphere that God was getting me in but it didn't bother me forgive me Lord for losing sleep for hours over one little sentence the devil said that's a lie and not the truth somebody say Amen but it didn't bother me because it was a lie it's not the truth we don't give him time we don't give him credit we don't give him the floor we don't let him cause us to lose sleep we don't let some family member that says something that's not true about us just get us in some kind of a mess of nervousness no it shouldn't bother us if it's Elijah and mothers now if it's the truth fess up to it I did wrong but if it's a lie don't give the devil any ground let him dabble in his own lies I've got other things to do with the kingdom that's what my sister Sharon said you know just a few years ago when we have all this pressure to doubt the message all this would all this come up 10 years ago whenever it was my sister Sharon she's had a wonderful thing she said we have too much to be doing for the kingdom of God to be going backwards and worried about that stuff there's too much good to be done can you say Amen get your life focused on the Lord and what you can do for his kingdom not on all the chatter and the gossip praise be to God that's good preaching can you say Amen you need your life focused on the kingdom not on Aunt this and Uncle this and what they said and what the other churches is doing in Lima and Lorraine I don't care God is leading them by the Holy Ghost you find what you need to do for the kingdom of God I'm not in any competition and all that I am not a part of any I don't want to be on the floor for any of that I've got something to do I've got a vision in my heart it's the message of the hour give it to me as many people as you can and if some of you don't want it there's somebody out there that wants this message somebody's hungry for it God's Gonna Fill these front pews with prostitutes and alcoholics this is what a word came from the Lord many years ago he's going to feel these front wheels did you notice nobody's in the front row I don't know what it is this is a good seat up here guys you're missing out I promise I won't spit on you that much but these are good seats and I never see anybody in them I'd love to see my young men and you know my young women right up here shouting me Han the cheerleaders can you say Matt let's do something for the kingdom let's see the devil destroy can you say man let's see his Works destroyed Among Us let's get excited about the kingdom of God not about so and so what they said about our church there's too much to do for the true Kingdom there's too many hungry Souls you're focused on their own thing but he's trying to get me out of the atmosphere so one thing to have things encamped around you it's another thing that they want to drag you down and pull you into it with them how many is everybody had somebody wanting to pull you into a fight with them you're in a good atmosphere you're doing good you're kind of Happy somebody comes in with their stuff and you're there to be a strength to pull them out of that but they're trying to pull you into their their ring and have a boxing match with them draw me into their fear draw me into their scare draw me down to their nervousness draw me into their gossip draw me into their opinions of things draw me into their lies to draw me into their concrete conclusions of the matter already to draw me to brother Daniel when he was here daniofori Darko he said yeah he said the devil has to have company it's not good enough for him to say something he's got to get some recruits and to agree with them tell me I don't know how Spirits work in a local assembly it's looking for allies gossip is looking for allies for support you don't need to do it that way come and be men of God come and talk about it let's look at the word let's look at what's wrong if I'm off this Bible and off this message you have a duty as a brother and sister in Christ to come and tell me but you don't have a duty to tell somebody else it's the wrong way draw me into their competition draw me into their pressure to choose sides with them draw me into and the tone of this world the tone is to turn against one another Jesus said many will betray one another many will turn against one another and they're the extreme divide in our country right now it's amazing but don't just remember there's an extreme spirit in our country to go to extremes against the other person and hate them there's no more respect for them Mark Levin is a conservative talk show host I don't listen to him but the other day he popped on the radio on in the car and he's the one that's always just so vicious you know against the Democratic party and he gets so mad he was so mad when Obama was in and he'd call him this and call him that in and I can only use one term in here I said hey he's got a whiny voice Obama he's an idiot he's he's just an idiot you know and I thought there was a certain respect level for the president's office that we're supposed to have he's an idiot and the other day he's on the Democratic party hates our country all of them hate our country and they want to burn our country to the ground and I sin the whole Democratic Party how does he have the authority to label the whole Democratic party and say they all hate America I know that's not true and message people just join in with it that's right amen mark oh Lord help us brother Brian says both parties are corrupt that's my word from the prophet so he's an idiot and they want to burn our country to the ground I said they do all of them and so I thought of it when it was on there Friday I said this is the tone of the spirit that's here but unfortunately we see it try to come in the church and it shouldn't you could draw the lines dig their heels down I can't dig these too far but they dig their heels down real deep down here you hate me and I hate you and I'm standing for what's right and they realize you've got the spirit of the world they've caught the spirit of the world it's the tone of the world they don't need anybody they don't need the other party they don't need the other believers they don't need oh God help us it's a dangerous time this is spirits of the last days to kill to try to kill the Divine love working amongst the people and it starts with the preachers down including myself we need more Divine love we need a better attitude we need to quit saying I hate this one or I detest this one we need to stop using that we need to hate the devil praise the Lord First Timothy oh I already quoted that so let me try to find a place here on psalms 27 to end now is everybody on the same page I feel like I'm delivering my heart today and I have the freedom to do that thank you for your openness I'm not a polished preacher by any means I don't mean that probably just I'm just not I I stutter sometimes Wednesday night I stuttered a lot and so but I pray the Holy Spirit can get something across to you of my heart I really like I said I just want to be a sincere Christian without guile I just want to be a simple Christian you know I want to preach a message on complicate the devil complicates this message so much he complicates everything this message is not meant to be complicated and don't forget he said in the scripture he says God is not the author of confusion so it's easy to say if there's confusion and doubt and fear and complicated Satan is trying to anoint you with the spirit no it's the Simplicity God in simplicity and if someone's trying to shake you out of that simple life then you just just stand and say Lord hide me hide me let them say what they want to say hide me in your Pavilion I mean you want to be hidden today hide me Lord so I'm not affected by this and if you get in the boat and Jonah gets in your boat if you've got to join in your boat you know what they did with them get off of my boat I mean I know it's a simple little lesson but and you probably learned it in Sunday school but like if you have a Jonah that's running from the presence of the Lord and rebellious and running from the things that's being preached and doing the opposite then get off of my boat God's going to deal with you but don't stay in my boat because if you stay on my boat my boat might start sinking and I don't want my boat to sink get off on my boat Jonah so in Psalms 27 I would say this that it's not so much hiding even though he uses that word but when the other words are there when it says he shall lift my head above he shall set me up upon a rock and he shall lift my head above my enemies it's not so much about hiding in this but it's but it's lifting us above it all that we can live above it all set me on a rock above my enemies praising the Lord because it says here he sets me up my head above the enemies how many would say I want to live above my enemies it's another atmosphere it's something else I want to live above it and therefore will I offer in this Tabernacle sacrifices of joy and I will sing yea I will sing praises unto the Lord so David is so confident here he says when you lift me up above my enemies you put me in a place set me on a rock and you lift me up above my enemies that I can at least be above them and and then what I'm doing up there is I'm praising I will offer the sacrifices of joy I will just praise the Lord like the Brother's song said today I'm not going to be shy to praise the Lord you know is it wouldn't it be annoying is you know David said on the Rock and he's just praising the Lord and all his enemies are down there and he's not even looking at them glow repeated God praise be to God and you start singing like I will not come down to the Devils level he set me up on a rock can you say Amen I'll pray for you my brother but guess what I'm not coming down to where you're at I don't want your fear I don't want your doubts I don't want your nervousness I want to live in this secret place above my enemies and you can imagine if this spirit is true that it's always trying to drag you down they're not happy that you're up there but they're saying hey get down here I got something to talk about with you get down what do you get down here why can't they come up with you they might not be called to it but if they are they don't want to come up there you need to hear my case you need to hear my disgrunleness you need to hear this get down here step off of that chair and get out of that place and we're saying no I want to live there one thing have I desired can you imagine a Believer saying out of all the things that we could ask for there's really today only one thing I want above money possessions retirements I know I can say this in my heart above a better job above more money above retirements above all the things one thing is what I really want and I'm going to seek after it I want to dwell in the house of the Lord every day of my life I want to stay there I'm going to stay up on that chair can you say amen I will not get down here get down here no no no no no no no I will not come down to the devil's level that's the cue for the musicians to come here and help me in I will not come down to Satan's grind Satan's grind oh when the Devil comes around I'm gonna move right up to Higher Ground oh I will not come down to the levels level no no no no no no no no no no no no no well I will not come down to the Devils level I'm just gonna praise the lord well I will not come down to Satan's [Music] never come to wrath I'm gonna move right up to Higher Grounds to the devils level no no no let me hear you say good morning I will not come down no no no no no I will not come to Satan's cry oh when the Devil comes around I'm gonna move right up to half the ground well I will not come down to the devil never no no no no amen amen this is I know this chair seems like a shaky place for a big guy like me but on the solid rock that he sets his own it's not shaky can you say man it's unmovable can you say man but I want to stay up here on God's ground let me sing a little bit more traditional one for you Lord lift me up and let me stand by faith Heaven's table land Hallelujah Lord Lift Me Up This shall be a revelation and let me stand by faith on heavens [Music] a high place Lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] all that surrounds me the danger hide Me Lord [Music] I'm pressing on the upwards Only One Direction the bride's going what do you do hearts I'm getting I'm gaining every day still praying as I'm all about Lord let my feet Lord Jesus Lord Lift Me Up I understand oh yes I stayed on heaven heaven [Music] [Music] hallelujah praise the Lord is more than just a sermon it's a mystery that's under the Rapture Revelation it's more than just a sermon it's God calling you to a higher place do your choice where you want to live maybe you come today and you're just you're struggling you're struggling maybe with the message for years there's a place that's in Simplicity that you can dwell and you shut all the rest of it out just you and Christ alone I encourage you to give your heart to that today with all my heart I encourage you to give your heart I wonder brother Solomon you'd come and sing that song with my message that last one you're saying Come and sing that you and your wife again but right with the service today you just want to raise your hand and praise the Lord lift my head above my enemies can you say Amen let's sing the second verse to this one you have this is a I think it's my
