TRANSCRIPT
========================================
began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance may the lord add its blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated god bless you amen amen [Music] um this scripture right here though it is familiar to us it's an extremely pivotal point in the scripture itself as brother bam taught us the roman catholic church taught that the church started in rome and he said that's not true at all it started on the day of pentecost this was the birth of the church here and what's even more amazing about this scripture was that this was a direct fulfillment of what jesus said about being born of the spirit as it says in john 3 verse 8 the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou heareth the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh and whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit of god so see there came a sound from heaven you can hear the wind but you don't know where it's coming where it's going and a rushing mighty wind came that day and they were all filled with the holy ghost amen it was a direct fulfillment of what he was saying amen as a matter of fact in acts 2 verse 14 to 16 uh the spirit when it anointed peter it came to another scripture that was being fulfilled as peter said in acts 2 verse 14 but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto him you men of judea and all you that dwell of jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose seeing is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel amen now we're not going to go into the exact prophecy but the next four verses is the prophecy from joel amen and we know when the spirit anointed peter amen the spirit of god don't mess up we mess up he don't and so when he anointed peter here he anointed the exact scripture they were fulfilling at this day it wasn't a surprise to god he knew it was going to happen oh glory to god and you go acts 2 17-21 the exact prophecy is actually from joel 2 28-32 amen so that was the fulfilling of joel 2 28-32 but if we go to joel 2. you know what i'm going to ask you to open your bibles this one time okay joel 2 there's actually something that is said before verse 28 that i want to show you here in joel 2 and we're going to start at verse 23 amen joel 2 and verse 23 it's one of those minor prophets so it could be a little hard to find those books sometimes joel 2 and verse 23 watch us here be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the thou shall overflow with wine and oil amen watch this in verse 25 and i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cake worm and the caterpillar and the palmer my great army which i send among you now just to do a little refresher i know you all know about this is that brother bam taught us that was the same type of bug just in different stages just like that horse rider that comes but you notice even though it would eat at it amen it would eventually be restored by the spirit of god but if you notice the positioning this restoration right after that comes joel 2 28-32 so when you watch when peter said this is that he never quoted verse 25. he quoted verse 28 to 32 because that was the birth of the church but the the extent of the prophecy in joel is not only the birth of the church but a promise that that same joel 28 to 32 would be restored to the church again that it wasn't just going to be dead yeah the bugs are going to show up yet an antichrist spirit would try to destroy it but he said i will restore the years glory to god i'm going to restore pentecost to you that's my title in case you're wondering a restored pentecost amen watch watch what brother graham says here rising of the sun i gave him the quotes and we'll just hope they put him up there for you amen i just feel so religious i just got to keep going just like a freight train we're going to keep going amen hope you want to come along amen brother brahm said this in the rising of the sun 65 he was waved to them the word which it was and waved back to them on the day of pentecost the word made manifest now as i said it is to be waived again in the last day amen this is not just a good suggestion this idea of pentecost and we're gonna get to it a little bit but it's not just a a just a funny feeling see a lot of people have corrupted the idea of what pentecost truly is hey man people thought pentecost was the emotion as if emotion just showed up in 1906 azusa street amen the church has always been emotional amen we didn't just start being emotional amen we've always been emotional amen in job 38 god came to job and said where were you amen when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god were shouting for joy amen we didn't just start becoming emotional the church has always been emotional we've always been shot we always been praising god we've always had a reason to be happy amen [Applause] as brother brahm taught us in job 38 amen those sons of god were shouting for joy why he said because they saw the plan of salvation when they looked at the plan they said wait a minute we make it wait a minute we're going to be there amen oh and they started shouting for joy you say brother stephen i don't remember shouting back then no but how do you know you were there how do you know you were shouting there it's because you're shouting now is he in job 38 amen remember we don't believe in pre-existence of souls but god's thoughts are not like our thoughts brother graham said in the church age book amen god's thoughts are real who glory to god god's thoughts are real amen and so that means that when he saw you in this day when you received salvation he knew you were going to do that back then so in his mind he saw you shout for joy amen you're getting emotional then sometimes we need to take a drink of that wine amen and you all know what that wine is it's stimulation from revelation that's why sometimes depression can get to you a little too much amen it's because you haven't taken a drink of the wine jesus came in the third seal he said a measure a week four penny three measures of barley for a penny he said but see thou hurt not the oil and the wine now we know what the oil is right it's the baptism of the holy ghost but that wine is that revolu stimulation from the revelation amen listen we don't believe in telling you how you're going to worship god but you can't tell me when the revelation of god hits you nothing's going to happen if i stick your hand right here and i take a hammer and i go smack there's gonna be a lot of emotion that day hey man see we get so scared about this stuff sometimes we get nervous about it you know why you're getting nervous because the devil can't hurt the wine he can't hurt the oil or the wine he can't touch it glory to god so the only thing he can do though is try to convince you to not take it and if it you think god would tell the devil not to touch something unless it was important to you sometimes we need to get emotional amen don't turn into a dirty word don't don't worry about what everybody else sells you make sure you're right between you and god don't worry about what everybody else says about it don't worry about what other people's opinions about it they're not going to make it to heaven for you who preach your brother stephen i think i will amen we look too much at other people thinking they're going to rapture us somehow thinking man's opinions can rapture us only god can do that [Applause] glory to god you love the lord that was all free we're supposed to be talking about this pentecost here hey man i'm gonna go to this next quote brother i'm also saying the rising of the sun he was waved at the day of pentecost when there came a sound from heaven like a waving mighty rushing wind and was waved over the people the pentecostal people that was up at pentecost waiting for the blessing to come and to be waived again we realized in the last day according to luke 17 30. i've listened to this sermon so many times but i never quite caught that luke 17 30 was a waving over us it was a waving of the original again see we're not just another church age we're not just a church with better thoughts in the church down the road we are a manifestation of seven church ages of all the history of the church we're the results of it i don't know there's a as brother man would talk about in dispensationalism there's the idea of type versus anti-type and i'm going to try to explain it and make it clear as i can because it is it gets convoluted in a theological talk but pretty much what an anti-type is is the result of a type for instance you look at the bible and you see a lamb amen remember um abraham found a lamb caught in the thicket right well the lamb would be a type of what the lame was the type of christ christ would be called the anti-type okay so it's the result of a type it's the explanation of a type amen and did you know there's so many types about us in rebecca and ruth and tamar all these great stories in the bible they're typing us do you know we don't type anything we're the result of it we are the anti-type we were the reason why that was written in the bible you say brother stephen there's got to be more scripture on that i'm so glad you asked there is it's galatians 3. galatians 3 watches here and that as you can tell i don't have this saved so i got to turn to it too but it's galatians 3 watches here galatians 3 and verse 16 watches now to abram into a seed where the promise is made he saith not as the seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ so when god went to abraham and said your seed shall possess the gate of its enemies amen everybody in that time in the old testament thought of a natural seed called isaac amen but paul is breaking into the mind of god here and saying no it's not that wasn't actually what he was talking about in type but the real seed that was he was thinking about what does logos mean in the beginning with the word the word was with god and the word was god the word logos means thought so when you write a p when you write on a piece of paper there's the thought in your mind that allows you to write it and he's breaking into that right now when god anointed moses right and thy seed the thought in god's mind everybody thought was isaac but paul's saying no that wasn't the thought in god's mind when he wrote that it was christ and guess what there's something else in there because if you go down to verse 29 in galatians 3 verse 29 and if you be christ then are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise wait who is the seed then if you're in christ that was you you were the thought in god's mind that when he wrote and thy seed he was thinking about you and that's how he was able to write that word you see these promises that god gave us he doesn't even feel pity towards us amen he saw you he already provided for you and you tell me the church ain't gonna be emotional about that i'm not telling you to work it up i'm saying ask god to give you the revelation of that because i'm not asking you to remember that but do you believe it see that's the next thing we need to start walking in this stuff we've been hearing it for years but we need to start stepping into it and walking in it amen it's like a story brother bam talked about you know oh i believe it is the rising of the sun i may be wrong about that brother he's talking about the trinity and so forth and how the how the trinity is wrong and how it actually works as god being offices and so forth and he was talking to a man at dinner i believe and they were talking and they were saying he was saying do you actually think it's that important to be re-baptized if somebody was baptized named father son holy ghost and brother baby said yeah you should be really baptized because you haven't been baptized at all he said you've been baptizing titles you weren't baptized in a name he said oh but it can't be that important and then he even said why didn't why didn't jesus just say that he said if i looked at you and i said go pay for this and sign the check in the name of the governor of arkansas or wherever they live i can't remember the exact quote now i don't remember exactly where they were eating supper but if you go there and write uh uh signed this check in the name of the governor of arkansas you wouldn't write that would you and he said he said well and he said well he said no you because we are citizens of arkansas we know it's arizona thank you lord i was it was driving me nuts it was arizona it's driving me nuts in my head it's arizona in the name of the governor of arizona because we are citizens of arizona amen we know what his name is so you wouldn't even question me about that and you could tell it pricked that man's heart you could tell it pricked it because brother man said he said oh yeah that makes a lot of sense boy don't it amen see jesus didn't have to say do in the name of the lord he didn't he said he said during the name of father son and holy ghost right because he wasn't talking to the whole world he was talking to people who are citizens of the kingdom that were in god's mind so when he came to use they get baptized from father son holy ghost he said of course it's jesus christ well that was pretty easy why i'm a citizen glory to god i'm a citizen of the kingdom of course i know hallelujah thank you jesus but what was so amazing i like how brother brahm said it that man said oh you could tell he pricked him but brother ram says now here's the next thing will you believe it and that's where that man failed see believing something is more than just accepting it in your mind it's more than just accepting it for conscience sake accepting it for what you know somebody convinced you and you say oh that does sound great but when you start actually believing something it changes your very actions it changes the way you are going to behave amen when you actually believe something that's why he said that's the next thing that man accepted what brother branham said he accepted what brother branham said about the the idea of trinity he accepted it but the man couldn't believe it it didn't change his actions one time me and my brother we went to uh um when i used to live in defiance there was a church planting bible study going on and they actually put an article in the newspaper so me and my brother read it and i looked at andrew saying do you want to go he said sure i'll go yeah let's go so monday night we went to this church planting bible study and uh there was a guy and there was a good 12 14 people there and we and this guy was just doing this bible study well i'm flipping through the pages of the bible study you see where he's going and stuff and i see matthew 20 19. i said there's my chance all right let's go so sure enough he goes to matthew 20 and 19 and the man says what he reads matthew 20 19 which we all know and he said what is the name of god so my brother pipes up my brother pipes up and says the name of god is the lord jesus christ that man looked at him said uh uh uh he said read your texts again sure enough somebody else in that bible said he piped up and said father son and holy ghost and he said yup see that's the name of god father son holy ghost you gotta know caresses a little bit so i'm gonna give you a little insight into us okay we both go like this and i start praying i said lord if he asks anybody if they got a question i'll ask him one sure enough my brother beside me he starts praying he says lord i know steven's gonna say something so he said he started praying for me then [Laughter] sure enough just he says does anybody understand anybody got a question whoosh right here right here i got a question i got a question about that i said and i brought it up what about acts 2 38 that same man who heard the same guy say father solomon goes went to acts 2 38 and completely changed to what you're saying taking baptizing the name lord jesus christ it was crazy what he said it's almost mind-boggling but he said peter was trying to evangelize to jews since the jews were the one that crucified jesus he was trying to push the name of jesus christ to the jews and so he was evangelizing that i said that's funny the same guy who was evangelizing jews but the name of jesus felt it was important to do it in acts 10 when he pushed it to gentiles when he went to a house with gentiles he said you need to get baptized in the name lord jesus christ and so i and i went down the same road that brother manum did i said he said i'm a brother i'm a husband and i told him i said i hope i'm your friend i said but i'm not any of those i'm not that's none of those are my name i said my name is stephen carrussel now this is what came out of that man's mouth washes here he said you're turning god like he's this one big diamond and depending on which way you turn him is the part that you're going to see and i went actually that's pretty good i like that i've actually kept that in my back pocket i said that's a good way of saying that yeah i do think that you're right you know what came out of mouths next he said and that takes away from god being three individual people out of his own mouth came one of the best descriptions of the godhead i've ever heard but what was the next thing he couldn't believe it he couldn't believe it and what does that believing mean he could just accept things in conscience like i said it came out of his own mouth he's the one that said it i didn't say that he said it but the next thing came can you believe it and i'm trying to encourage you about this okay you you've got to start accepting these things that's true amen brother brandon said this in the token he said you can't just believe you got the token you know he said that he said you got to know that you know that you know you got the token make your calling election sir you think you're offending god making sure you got the goods amen don't worry about that make sure you got it god's coming back look at the world right now if it was ever falling apart it sure is now look where we're at friends this will not go on forever and i don't i don't mean to scare you but i'm gonna shake you a little bit this ain't gonna keep going on forever enoch one day was walking with god and the bible says and he was not one day he went from being on earth to not being on earth amen it's gonna happen amen and who's gonna be there those that are filled with the spirit of god that's why we needed a restored pentecost amen and thank you lord he brought me full circle amen watch this here brother man said in the church age book this is why i'm preaching this exactly like this too brother bram said this in the church age book he said in the ephesian church age chapter three he said he that hath in the ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches how tragic it is that this first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man see that's the beat right there say i wasn't making anything up was i amen we need to stop listening to all these other voices amen and make sure you're going to be there amen you want to make sure you're going to be there don't ask me go ask god about it see if he says you can listen to the spirit you know what that means the spirit talks oh that was so good praise the lord that means he can still talk amen that means he can still speak amen who listens to nothing who listens to nothing the spirit will tell you he will answer you he will speak to you whether in church whether you're home whether left to hear he can talk to you glory to god how tragic it is that first they did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man but thank god can you say thank god in the last age there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirits when the spirit says something she's listening she's already ready she's standing attention amen if god wants this then i'm gonna listen to it watch us here and that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus christ oh isn't that quote just powerful see we're gonna go back to this we've been restored to it hey man god did it right the first time it was when people started listening to man that started all the persecution all the problems in the church all these false doctrines it's when people started listening to man and not the spirit of god amen that's why we got so many problems hey man people keep thinking they got the answer and so forth and they know more about it than god somehow out like like i've said before like out profiting the prophet how in the world is that going to work i had a man one time tell me he didn't like i said brother graham said all the time and he said what's the difference between you saying it and brother brain i'm saying it if you're both anointed by the holy ghost i said easy i said i'm not malachi 4. god didn't write about my ministry in the bible but this man was going to be so important in these last days that he wrote prophecies about his ministry anointing other prophets to say them malachi is another prophet and malachi was anointed by the holy ghost and said i'm going to send you elijah the prophet identified his even his personality and so forth and no idea what he was going to do i said and god didn't do that for me that's why i quote brother branham amen that's why i'm a message believer amen because it was right here god promised he was going to do it through that ministry he's returning us back to the power of pentecost there's power in the holy ghost this morning you don't have to live the same way you came in there's power there's power to do what to change things that word power and in some instances of the bible that word power means dunamis it's actually the word we get for dynamite did you ever like dynamite before i never had but i've seen pictures of it when you like dynamite guess what things change things are going to change amen and that's what we need brother said in the rising and the rising of the sun he said you are a house a temple for the dynamics amen you have the mechanics in you now you need a spark inside of you to ignite it time to light the dynamite church we need some changing power [Applause] see we my dad always told me if you always do we always did you always get what you always got that's the problem just coming to church sunday and wednesday sunday and wednesday thinking something's going to change no you need to step out of your comfort zone get sparked by the holy ghost and things will change [Applause] glory to god i want to welcome him back when i meet him in the air when i welcome him back it's going to be through the power of pentecost who you love the lord i feel good i think we need some more changing power in our life can you say amen it's not going to happen through our works see what happens a lot of times say you have a besetting sin something you can't stand happen and you sit there and you try to come up with ways to strategize to try to get it out of your life to try to change this circumstance oh let's say like this let's bring it a little closer some of us may have family members who don't believe and you kind of try to think of ways that will save them you try to think of avenues well if i can get them to this special service they might make it who said that remember this church if your true goal is for some of those loved ones to be saved to be filled with the holy ghost your first step is to get out of the way you don't know what that person's gonna have to go through to get saved brother stephen what do you mean how do you know i know because i am a result of that promise thank you lord jesus long time ago when i was still a sinner my dad and my brother ended up fighting about this well no my dad knew about the message for years and i'm not gonna try to get into the whole testimony but my dad got back into the church and so forth and was starting to serve god and his boy out there was smoking and drinking still my dad the what what i love most about my dad my dad would always ask me to go to church but he never it was amazing my dad would never condemn me at all never said a word of condemnation to me all he did was pray all he did was pray for me and through events that he had no control over glory to god he wasn't he just got out of the way and god orchestrated events in my life to bring me to this message so when you start doubting that promise just remember this day there was a preacher up here who's up here preaching because of that promise see we're not just returned to the emotion of pentecostal emotions fine we're not just brought back to the doctrines of pentecost which are just great but we're coming back to the power of pentecost that when you pray when you get down on your knees and you speak to god you know he responds oh i tell you what we got a little too wishy-washy bride we need to start stepping forward the bible says approach the throne of grace boldly quit shrieking back against all these problems step forward and believe it amen we need some more daniels in the church when the whole government said you weren't supposed to pray anymore daniel got on his knees and kept praying to god regardless what i love about that story of daniel praying the bible says his windows were opened now i i thought it was the strangest thing why is the bible even mentioning that you can already kind of tell that he was praying you could read in the bible he's praying and you read in the chapter before that they made a law that you can't pray so you know the circumstances but the bible specifically mentions and his windows were open why i wonder if yeah the windows open because he was hot he was hot you know you ever get there you get hot in a room so far especially in those days keep the windows open to keep it cool in the house did you realize the world was so insignificant to daniel that even when he thought uh think about did the thought even cross his mind to close the windows to hide his prayer it was so insignificant to daniel what the world thought that he's like you know what i'm kind of hot i'm gonna keep the windows open i want to cool down a little bit well i pray to god amen god's a bold man amen even throwing the lines then and so forth like that listen i'm gonna say this sometimes when we read these stories we read them like a children's story book oh isn't that neat wow isn't that neat that god did that i'm here to tell you we're returning back to the power of pentecost god what if there was a lion pit out there today could god still close those lions mouths see it's the same god amen we're not just being returned to the doctrines the emotions we're going back to power dunamis dynamite amen of pentecost glory to god hallelujah see i'm preaching this so you keep stop thinking that pentecost is somehow a bad word say pentecost all of a sudden you get a little nervous who i don't want people to think where i am but let people think what you are who cares you know where you stand one time when i was working back in the elevator i walked in the maiden shop and they looked at me and said look the holy roller's in i said thank you very much i like that i know they don't know what they're talking about hey man i know where i stand so when they call me a whole world i'd wear like a little badge they don't know what they're talking about when people start calling you brandonites don't worry about that you know where you stand and if you don't you better get back in pentecost go find out where you stand i don't know about you but i'm tired of religion i'm tired of religious activities i'm tired of thinking because of certain this certain thing not happening now i'm just gonna fail amen we gotta get back to power when god shows up brother baby taught us wherever god is the supernatural's there shouldn't be so foreign in our lives oh that was good help me god as well that's what i'm saying the supernatural shouldn't be so foreign in our lives so the question becomes now what is pentecost then what is it really watch what brother behind says about pentecost himself brother man said this in jehovah 3 listen friends i know they say pentecost they organize pentecost that's wrong pentecost is an experience the methodists get it the baptists get it all of them get it pentecost is not organized it is experienced and if you haven't had the experience of pentecost come receive it now listen god's not holding pentecost from you god's not holding power back from you god's not holding supernatural back from you oh no he's not see i know it's i'll see i feel that little pullback sometimes when i've said this before in multiple locations oh you're trying to you're trying to work up god you're trying to call something of god it's a promise church we you it's not just a good idea to have power in your life it is necessary you know how so necessary is if you've got no power in your life tell me how you got saved i think i said this a couple while ago here actually that's where the lord to me amen you're not saved by good thoughts you can't just sit here and think yes i'm safe yes i'm safe yes i'm safe you're not saved by that at all you're saved by power god came and made a blood for you and broke the blood cell and the life of god now comes back upon the believer which is the life of god the holy ghost itself comes back on you you're not saved by good thoughts i'm going to get a little strict here you're not even saved by a church you're not saved by a church you're not saved by these things you're saved by power [Applause] so there's no power how'd you get saved i know i know see and it's not just good enough to talk about this stuff you know what i mean pentecost is an experience you know billy ramsey said one time he said sometimes i think we get people to a church and not to christ we're not against church functions i'm not talking about any of that okay it's okay to get together and fellowship and be with each other it's actually better than some of the alternatives out there let's be real okay so there's nothing wrong against that okay but be careful some people and young people hear me parents hear me too maybe i'll say it like that teacher young amen these things are not to replace the power of god some people think because they attend the religious activities now they have become religious and that's the problem they probably have they didn't get to christ though hey man these things need to be christ-centered brother baby said if he's the center of the bible then he should be the center of our whole lives about knock the wine over it's all right amen if he's the center of the bible he should be the center of our lives it shouldn't be so foreign i'm preaching on myself this morning just so you know i may have to go to the altar this morning as well we it shouldn't be so foreign to us we need to start accepting this getting into it experiencing it here watch this brother man said this in the token the token 64 paragraph 188 the pentecostals they claim we're a pentecostal organization there is no such thing i like that pentecost is an experience not as an organization they try to organize it but you can't it doesn't organize pentecost is an experience it's the seal of god the holy spirit that comes on the day of pentecost amen see it's an experience you've got to see it for yourself actually we're going to get to that here in a minute brother man said in jesus christ the same yesterday forever 63. and if he will manifest himself here that he is here this very holy spirit that you receive proves that it's him watch it's so powerful pentecost is the only thing is going to prove christianity watches you can't prove it by science you can't prove it by nothing but by a pentecostal experience you baptist know that you methodist and peace between whatever you are you know it takes a pentecostal experience to prove god wow now watch this here and to each individual it doesn't prove the organization it proves the individual see i this is why i keep coming back to this it's not just good enough to talk about this anymore do you know just talking about it doesn't prove god it doesn't prove him real in anybody's life i i've said it like this before anybody in here know who george washington is yeah i bet everybody's hand would raise we all went to first grade didn't we george washington was the first president of the united states you ever heard that old story of him cutting down the cherry tree so forth like that we all know things about george washington he could have went for a third term but he didn't want to be president anymore so he stopped and so forth like that we all know these things but who met him anybody here experience him no why he's dead anybody shake his hand anybody talk to him and this is my point a lot of you can learn a lot about jesus and let's just be let's just bring it on down we're not baptist we're not methodists we're here message you can learn a whole lot about god through this message you can learn that you're not supposed to cut your hair you're supposed to wear skirts that you're supposed to just write how we worship how how this works how that works the proper way to be baptized what the trinity had the correct doctrine of the trinity and so forth like that serpenty boy serpency you can know so much about god and yet never experience him you see what happens a lot of times and listen i'm going to bring into some of your holy ghost-filled people that's what happens a lot of times in your life when you feel like god's so far away is because you started trying to figure out how to fix the problem and not start talking to him about it just as much these experiences don't stop glory amen we just don't get one experience one and none no god wants to talk to you every day do you ever think about this for a second think about how much you want to experience god boy i it's through the roof how much i want to experience god yeah brother brando taught us that he wants to give you the holy ghost more than you could even want it so you think about how much he you want to experience him think how much he wants to experience you we're just all over the place this morning aren't we glory to god you look in the beginning of the bible in creation when adam was made when adam was made god looked down on adam and said he's lonely he named all those animals but there wasn't a mate for him and he was lonely so what did he do to fix adam's loneliness he took out of his side his bride his mate eve and when eve showed up it cured adam's loneliness it cured adam's loneliness so much that even when he knew his wife was wrong he was willing to take on her sin to stay with her i heard a preacher say this one time i i've been trying to find the quote he said brother bram said but i haven't found it but i think it's so beautiful anyways when god saw what adam did he said that god said i want to do that that was the cure to adam's loneliness and brother mom taught us when god was alone he was lonely and so what did he have to do to fix his loneliness you think of how much you want to see god can you hear the tears of god up in heaven waiting for you to talk to him he was lonely back then and so he set this whole drama up so he wouldn't have to be lonely anymore so his attributes he could dwell with his family those thoughts in his mind you're the cure to god's loneliness do you see do you ever under the bible says when we partake of these debris promises we partake of the very nature of god did you do you think god gave you promises out of pity oh well he just wants you to be better than everybody else you ever think about that why did god even give you promises to begin with oh my gosh this is fresh from heaven huh thank you lord jesus why did god ever give you a promise to begin with did you ever wonder because he wanted a fellowship with you yeah do you ever think about that how much does god want to talk to you how much god wants to hang out with you hey man oh and it's good to hang out with each other amen but do you ever wonder how much god wants to be there with you too boy that that humbled me a little bit i don't know about you brother thinking about god's own heart how much he that's why he gave you the promises that's why he wants to have fellowship with you he wants to experience you do you ever you ever look at the walk to emmaus i told you we'd be all over huh you ever think about the walk to emmaus those two men walking down talking about the events that happened and then all of a sudden a man approached them now we know it's jesus in the story right we know it's jesus but we look at that they didn't know it was jesus and so jesus looked at these two guys walking down emmaus and goes hey you know why you so sad what what why you got so sad was something bad happened down the road well there was a bad funeral why you got so sad they said what are you talking about dude don't you know what happened three days ago we thought that guy was the messiah and they ended up crucifying him he's dead you know i just jumped the story didn't i did you not hear what happened in jerusalem did you not hear now here's the little thing you know jesus didn't know what happened in jerusalem right you know why he knew he was there but what did jesus say to him what things did you ever wonder about that jesus knew what happened and now he looked at these two men walking through a maze and saying what happened you ever think about he just wants to hear from him he's just having fellowship oh i say you know church if we're if we're the bride that means we're the cure to god's loneliness i say we start stepping in our position get into this he wants to experience you just as much as you want to experience him have that relationship with god and like he said here to each individual it proves god god can't be proven by just book learning is it good to learn about god of course it is i want to know more about him but that's not going to take you all the way you've got to actually experience god it's not just good about to talk about how god's a healer have you experienced it is it real to you that i'll give you a little test brother brahm said this if you be talked into something you can be talked out of it amen you've got to have the baptism the holy ghost so much that nobody could talk you out of it just like our example with enoch did you notice enoch when he went up he had family he had kids he had parents uncles aunts and he was still willing to walk up to god you hear me church it's it you brother stephen you you're making this sound really serious i sure hope i am sure hope i am amen amen i want to read another quote here watch this i want to get to this one brother abraham said in the trial 64. this is that man who actually ends up going to india and he has that um that indian man said that um muhammad can produce such just as much psychology as your god can the only difference between muhammad and jesus is that jesus said when he came back the works that i do shall ye do also that was the difference between what jesus said when muhammad said but i want to show you something brother brahm said here watch us brother man said this he's talking about that man saying i want to ask you something he said when i was a little boy i had an experience and my mother washed washed and everything to send me to school and i thought surely when i got my ba that i would find christ he said that's when it was given to me i didn't find it when i got my doctor's degree i thought i would find it when i got my lld i thought i would find it he said brother branham i got enough degrees both literal and honorary that i could plaster your walls with them but where's the god of the bible now i'm going to bring this down to r i've read the church age book i've read the seven seals i've heard message preaching i go to a message church i have people in this family as a message listen this this all sounds sometimes we take these stories and don't apply them to ourselves sometimes you can replace all this stuff with all that stuff i just said and you could still end up in the same spot he is where is the god of the bible he said was the teachers wrong who am i to say that the teachers wrong brother ramsey said paragraph 17 well here's what i understand that you turned pentecostal brother braham says well i don't say i believe when i was born in the kingdom of god i automatically was pentecostal because pentecost is not an organization they try to make it but it isn't god will fill a presbyterian a lutheran or whoever you are see it doesn't matter quit giving god your religion and give him he wants you he wants you he wants you as an individual he doesn't want your religion just throw it away the bible says can you be more holy than god could get you just somehow just muster up the holiness and go i'm so holy now that i could talk to god now see god god never wanted that to begin with you understand that god wants you he wants a relationship with you he wanted to manifest himself to you amen not just as lord but as savior healer redeemer father forgiver he wants to manifest these things to you when you have those problems i've noticed this the bible says pray without ceasing it doesn't mean to be on your knees all the time what it means is is to be your default when something happens in your life what do you default to you go talk to somebody else about it you talk somebody in the church about it somebody somebody said something bad about you in the church oh i don't mean to get too close but sometimes somebody do about it sure what you do you start talking to everybody else about it and you forgot the one person you ought to be talking to about it relationship that's what pentecost is and with relationship comes power you see what i'm saying i hope you understand what brother brahms said or brother steven's saying does he that this restored pentecost with the power behind it is what's going to welcome back jesus christ so i'm trying to encourage you if this has been lacking in your life if you've been struggling with those mind battles and so forth is this the reason why have you got too much in the ba too much in the doctor's degree in your mind trying to figure everything out you boy i tell you what message people we're the worst about this sometimes i've had my fair share of counseling meetings i've sat in a lot of those things i remember one time i had i was talking to a brother and he was telling me all this and he didn't feel saved and he didn't feel like he was going to be in the rapture he didn't feel like he had the holy ghost and i looked at him just dumbfounded i said brother i said are you sure you just think too much it's like what do you mean i said well you keep saying all this stuff and yet what i see i don't believe it for a second i said if anybody's got the holy ghost at you i said if anybody's gonna make you in the rapture to be you you've been such a faithful brother you pray for the ministry you pray for these people you give your tithe and your hearts filled with the love of god i've seen what you do and i'm just going i'm so dumbfounded right now i have no idea what you're talking about see we get bad about this we think too much think too much and not talk to god about it i tell you what this is what i'm trying to encourage you about chain i want i want you to i want to challenge you a little bit change your prayers change your prayers quit giving god religion if you got an all in your heart about somebody be real with him you're not hiding it from him oh i i i love you message people so much we always think we're good at hiding we're always just good at hiding we put our little halos in church and we're just all bunch of angels i know better but if so if you really got an issue quit giving god a religion be real with him about it lord jesus i don't know why that brother said that about me it's making me mad be real and don't worry god's going to help you in that because you don't actually want to be like that you don't want to feel like that tell them about it lord i don't want to feel like this but i am god's shown me what's going on so i can have a better spirit about it that's pentecost true that was so good right there that's pentecost when you can have that kind of a relationship with god that you can talk lip to ear to god that you know when you pray when you speak he hears from heaven he's going to answer your prayers what brother ramsey said one time he said every time i pray to god he's either giving it to me and told or told me why i couldn't have it see and that's that's what i want to get to well i love you church so much it's like being at home here i feel i get i only get like this with family folks so i hope you can endure me just a little bit longer amen a lot of times we we treat prayers like we're like we're talking to the president or when we when we talk to god sometimes we think he's an atm machine that you insert the promise then here comes the blessing and then you go home [Laughter] but as brother branham said he either told me i could have it gave it to me or told me why i couldn't this is where i want to get to is that this pentecost is a relationship an experience of a relationship power only comes from relationship amen and you look at this how could some of us handle god saying no do you ever think about that when if god would say no how could you could you could you stomach it there was one time a woman came up to jesus and she wanted her daughters saved or healed and the bible says that she couldn't go to him and said she said thou son of david thou son of david jesus didn't even regard her just kept on walking kept wider walking she kept coming lord i have need of thee lord help me lord help me what did jesus say jesus said is it meat to give the children bread to dogs now think about this for a second i'm getting to a point we're talking about what pentecost is it's a relationship like i said it's not an atm machine god is not an idol amen he's not an idol he has a spirit he is living amen he wants a relationship where you're just as much he's worried about you and you're worried about him amen and he says this kind of thing to a woman brother brahman said if you said some of these pentecostal people i know he said they would run right out the back door call me a dog but what'd she say truth lord she admitted the word was right no matter what he said he's right but i'll even eat the crumbs lord and what did jesus say i mean i've read the bible specifically says if i remember this greatly you forgive me if i'm wrong the bible says he marveled you know what that word marveled means means to wonder in amazement i think i'm blending some stories but it still applies to this woman i think wonders in amazement he went he looked at this woman went whoa i have not seen so great of faith no not in all israel see not even the one you see this is my point here of this whole story it's relationship with god god's not an atm machine he wants to hear what you think about it he wants to hear what you think what you're experiencing what you're desiring amen he wants to talk to you he wants fellowship that's pentecost could you imagine you you know how much god wanted this in the old testament uh when they wanted to meet god only the priest could go in there once a year and it was behind the veil and the bible says when you were before the veil you're even before the lord and he wanted to have fellowship so bad but sin was in the way he cannot come in where sin is at amen he can't touch sin remember when he was on the mountain anything that touched it had to die amen so when he was covered in the veil sin could not enter into that amen so when jesus christ came though and he died on the cross and he said it is finished and he gave up the ghost as soon as that sacrifice was made you were so cleansed by it that the bible says he read the fail from top to bottom as soon as the sing question was settled he said i'm sick of this veil in the way i got to rent this veil amen it didn't do it from the earth to heaven right he did it from heaven to earth means it was a work of god came down stroke it and said here i am i finally can make it now here i want to talk to you i want to hang out hey what are you guys all doing over there he wants that fellowship with you that's pentecost pentecost ain't just an emotion it ain't just a doctrine amen it's power from god the same life that dwelled in him he wants to dwell in you have fellowship with you talk with you walk with you he wants to hear what you think amen you love the lord you're right i got about three more pages but i'm going to read one more quote and i'll be done i just want to say this real quick here that if you bring up that balm and gilead that this pentecostal experience just didn't exist 40 years ago 50 years ago during the pentecost it didn't exist or it didn't just only exist during the times of peter of all these stories of martin luther john wesley we hear about these god has never brother braham said pentecost started with no ending do you know what that means church that means it's still here it's still here and i want you to read this i want to read this quote here brother graham said in baum and gilead bill abraham said this onto the streets they went they had the results they showed that they've been inoculated they showed that something had happened all the fear and then talking about the day of pentecost now all the fear and things had vanished away as soon as they got the injection of god's toxin of the holy ghost that was poured out upon them who if if you've been feeling that fear lately and listen this world is hanging handing it out in droves remember this about that covid you know why covid was a lung disease because that devil's trying to snuff out your voice he he knows what it means when you talk to god so if you can get the breath out of you you can't talk to god no more amen that's why he's attacking the breath in you amen i say if he's trying to attack our breath then we ought to be able to say it louder then boo devil i'm still talking to god i'm still going to speak to him that's why he's attacking here he's trying to get you to be quiet i said we'd be louder then amen that devil don't like it hear this then amen oh my glory to god that's why we need that toxin when that fear is coming out of this covet and this world handed this see it's getting worse church you got to be careful i was just talking to brandon about theirs in the office i've noticed this lately that depression spirit has been getting stronger and stronger than it's ever been i remember sars back in 06. i remember bird flu this kind of spirit never happened but this kobe thing when they started trying to shut things down said things like that has caused such an isolation when you get by yourself that's when you start fearing that's when you start getting depressed and anxiety and you get all nervous what's going to happen you know when those stuff come in god's got enough medicine for you this evening morning you just need to get another inoculation of the holy ghost get back in the word of god get back in pentecost amen get back in the spirit of god [Applause] it's only going to get worse church i'm going to tell you something and this is maybe this is attack caresology i call it my opinion just think if this is the extent how much farther can they go at this point huh it's only going to get worse i'm not trying to scare you i'm trying to tell you there is an inoculation to that fear there is something you can do about it and look for the world for the answer god's got the answer for you god can still speak to you and take that fear out of your heart by pouring into you his perfect love guess what he still loves you hallelujah even when you get caught up in that stuff and you start getting that depressed spirit you know he never left you yet even when you think you left god guess what he still holds on to you he doesn't let go the bible says you were in the palm of his hand can a mother forget her child he said yay she might but i won't he's never forgotten about us he wasn't surprised about covet he knew it was gonna come amen you need to step up and believe that you need to get rid of that depression and that fear in your heart god's coming for us he still is holding on to you even if you feel so lost right now and so depressed about these things he's never let go of you yet thank you lord jesus as butler branham said we're not holding on to our religion our religion's holding on to us glory to god get back in that holy ghost amen get back to where you were first saved get back in that spirit of god get back to pentecost amen i want man let me finish this part of the quote poured upon them it made them slobber stammer act like a bunch of drunk people but they were receiving new life god was placing his life into that 120. they screamed they shouted they spoke in tongues they run they acted like drunk people because they were inoculated can i say something here this is my hopefully my final statement he's not just talking about in the church you can do this at home amen i actually i'd be nervous it happened in church every time then i start questioning some things but whenever you need an inoculation it's always available no matter where you act i'll give you another testimony one time i was driving i worked for an elevator and um i don't know if you ever seen this big three wheel farm vehicles they're really tall gators that's right and and they they they are floaters that's what they're called they're supposed to they have big wide tires one time i was listening to brother bram and that floater and i mean this is a big vehicle i could crush your car i really could and i was striving and brother bannon said something that just so blew my mind that i i went somewhere while i was driving down the road 35 miles per hour i don't suggest this like right now everyone's going to go home and start doing it i'm not suggesting this but god came down into that little floater's cabin and i don't know what happened but i was gone for 30 seconds i know i was because i was down to the next stop sign and i was speaking in tongues i was rejoicing i was just like god i'm so thankful for this and he kept that floater on the road i didn't hit anybody matter of fact when i came to i was breaking stopping at a stop sign and i went what see that's pentecost i'm not saying that to glorify myself what i'm saying is it's available to all of you what i'm saying is if god did it for me he can do it for you sometimes you need that to happen in your life you need that inoculation yes it should happen in church but i also say it should happen at work sometimes too when a married couple may be getting a little feuding and stuff like that and i listen we'll be real with you when husband and wife starts getting to feuding you know what sometimes you need you just see an inoculation of the holy ghost grab each other by the hand and say lord bring the holy ghost down we need you so much more if you have an ought with the brother grab them by the hand and say we're going to pray that the inoculation comes you ever seen drunk person before and i'm not proud of this but i have been drunk in my life and but what brother ram says absolutely true when you see a drunk person they're in love with everybody they are they they don't even think about any problems they don't even think about uh all the issues other people have said about them they don't care about any of it all they just love everybody that's what we need an inoculation of the holy ghost amen amen you love the lord as the musicians come may we just bow our heads for a prayer most gracious kind heavenly father lord i just want to thank you lord for your holy spirit i thank you lord for the anointing of god that this little body accepts and receives from you lord that they hear from heaven lord i just i just feel so overjoyed in my heart lord it's even hard for me to speak these words right now i thank you lord for this assembly i thank you lord for its pastor and all the associate ministers and their musicians and the people here lord what a wonderful atmosphere lord for your spirit to come down and to still minister unto us what you what you would want us to hear for lord even myself though i was the speaker there was things that i said that really struck my heart that i'm asking you lord god will you help me i've been failing in this lately lord that when i have a problem or an issue i'm forgetting what my default is it's prayer to you lord it's a pentecost amen that i can even be inoculated of the holy ghost even in my office lord that i can have it anywhere i seek it you'll be there though we may have let go lord you have not let go of us lord and we are truly humbled by it god we are so thankful lord how much you desire of us help us lord to not neglect our relationship with you anymore lord brother branham taught us we backslide every day and i wonder if that backsliding is based solely upon our relationship with you it's not so much religious activities and so forth but we're backsliding a lot of times in our relationship with you god and lord maybe ask us a little assembly though some may have been continuing and maybe they feel all right and some feel like they can do a little repentant we can all admit together that we want to be closer to you lord that we want to do a little bit of a rededication in our hearts oh god to stop looking at the world lord to stop looking at all this coven nonsense to stop stop paying attention to entertainment so much and and what's on our computers and our phones lord our phone's not gonna rapture us the news is not going to rapture us but pentecost will that spirit of god dwelling in our souls setting our souls of fire lord that's what will clean us that's what will cleanse us that's what draws us closer to you lord as the bible declares draw nigh unto god and he will draw nigh unto you so lord as i speak for myself i want to rededicate myself as well oh god i ask you lord forgive me for my sins i look at myself a lot of times and i just think failure but lord i know god that you have never failed and we just need another pentecost in our lives oh god help us dear jesus may we start speaking to you in a relationship as you said on the walk of emmaus what thanks i wonder if the spirit of god is saying that to some people in here this evening lord this morning he's looking at us and he's asking us what things what's what's going on in your life what are you desiring what do you wish would change in your life is there a loved one that needs safe what things he's looking at you and saying what things maybe you just need another baptism of the holy ghost you want the joy to spring in your soul he's asking you what things maybe you need the baptism of the holy ghost this morning you've heard about it you've heard people talk about it you've seen people scream and stammering and you're saying lord i want to experience that he's asking you this morning what things what things are you seeking what things are you desiring he's ready to have a relationship with you oh you may have left for a season but he's never left you yet and he's asking you what things may the church receive may the bride start speaking to their lover right now in your own voice why don't you speak to god speak unto him what's on your heart right now don't worry about religion don't worry about what people are saying don't worry about what people think or if they overhear you god you want to make sure god hears you sometimes you got to do something about it sometimes you got to step forward you got to have the faith to say god i need you so much more in my life i want to be changed lord i need dynamite in my life oh god i need something to happen to me lord he's asking you what things may the bride seek it and may the bride receive in jesus name brother get in go and sing a song of worship with us if you got to keep praying just keep praying let's just worship him [Music]

one time that you got to do something sometimes when he was in sabino canyon with those brothers and he ended up the lord told us to grab a rock and throw it in the air he said he grabbed the rock through in the air when it came down and made the whirlwind and god dwelled in the whirlwind he said but see god was telling me i gotta do something see you're not an idol either in case you're wondering you're not a robot either you're not just saved automatically because you showed up here this morning but you got to do something you got to show that you believe in amen if that word is true if god is coming back in the rapture and you still have a doubt about the baptism of the holy ghost you got to step forward and do something about it then you got to step forward you got to step out from the pew you got to stand as the bible says if you stand for me then i'll stand for you you got something to do grab the rock bride throw it in the air if you want something to change in your life then you got to do something about it amen amen seeing whatever's on your heart let's just worship him [Music] and
