[0:00] reading joshua but we'll just skip right
[0:01] to second corinthians chapter six
[0:04] but this will be along the lines of our
[0:06] joshua
[0:07] commission series that we've been in on
[0:10] for quite a while
[0:11] but we want to read in second
[0:12] corinthians chapter six if you would
[0:16] coming here in verse 14 towards the end
[0:22] second corinthians chapter 6 and verse
[0:25] 14. be ye not unequally yoked together
[0:31] with unbelievers
[0:34] for what fellowship hath righteousness
[0:37] with unrighteousness
[0:38] and what communion hath light with
[0:41] darkness
[0:42] what concord hath christ with baal
[0:46] and what part hath he that believeth
[0:49] with an infidel and what agreement hath
[0:52] the temple of god
[0:55] with idols for we are the temple of the
[0:58] living god
[0:59] as god has said i will dwell in i just
[1:01] want to stop here
[1:02] if you have discernment you know that
[1:05] paul is talking about
[1:07] a separation that a believer must have
[1:10] from unhealthy fellowship and he makes
[1:12] it so clear that it's difficult for
[1:15] there to be levels of fellowship with
[1:17] the the unrighteousness and righteous
[1:18] and difficult to have
[1:20] concort with christ and baal hath he
[1:23] that one that believes with an infidel
[1:25] there's only a certain level that you
[1:27] can go to and fellowship with these and
[1:29] after a while
[1:30] it'll become a hindrance to you who you
[1:33] fellowship with
[1:34] and that's what he's trying to say but i
[1:36] the next the next verse
[1:38] tells the reason why you know you could
[1:41] separate from people but
[1:42] or from influences that are not right or
[1:45] fellowship that's not right
[1:46] but if you don't know the reason why
[1:48] you're just going to see it as another
[1:49] rule
[1:50] why do we have to do that and here to me
[1:52] is the reason why
[1:54] it says here at the end towards verse 16
[1:57] and what agreement at the temple of god
[1:59] with idols
[2:00] for ye are the temple of the living god
[2:02] as god has said
[2:03] i will dwell in them and walk in them
[2:06] and i will be their god
[2:08] and they shall be my people wherefore
[2:12] come out from among them and be
[2:14] separate saith the lord and touch not
[2:16] the unclean thing
[2:18] and i will receive you and will be a
[2:21] father unto you
[2:22] and ye shall be my sons and daughters
[2:25] saith the lord almighty so what's the
[2:26] purpose of separation
[2:28] god wants relationship
[2:32] with you god it's about relationship
[2:37] it's about god wanting to be and when
[2:39] you talk about sons and daughters and
[2:41] the father
[2:42] that's that's a relationship and so now
[2:45] if he talks about separation
[2:47] it could cause a break in our
[2:49] relationship with the lord
[2:52] if we don't separate from
[2:53] unrighteousness can you say amen
[2:56] so this is the importance but here's the
[2:58] last verse i want to add chapter 7 and
[3:00] verse 1.
[3:01] having therefore these promises dearly
[3:04] beloved what promises he just talked
[3:06] about a promise now
[3:08] which is what i'm going to preach a
[3:09] little bit about today the promise what
[3:10] promise do we have a promise of god
[3:13] that he wants fellowship with us he
[3:15] wants relationship with us
[3:18] and he says if you'll do these things
[3:19] i'll have i'll dwell with my people i
[3:22] will be in them
[3:23] i will have relationship with them and
[3:25] he says having that kind of promise of
[3:27] relationship
[3:28] which should be so important to us
[3:31] having
[3:32] therefore these promises dearly beloved
[3:34] let us cleanse ourselves
[3:36] from all filthiness of the flesh and
[3:38] spirit
[3:39] perfecting holiness in the fear of god
[3:43] i want to just begin a little series
[3:45] here this sunday and next sunday
[3:46] and i won't be able to get it all done
[3:48] today but i want to talk about what is
[3:50] between you
[3:51] and the promises what is between you and
[3:54] the promises
[3:55] because this is what we have in joshua
[3:58] in the joshua commission
[4:00] the fight and the battle was destroying
[4:03] anything
[4:04] between them and the promised land
[4:07] anything that was between them and the
[4:09] promised land but today i trust i can
[4:11] build some value into what the promise
[4:13] is
[4:14] because if you don't see what you have
[4:16] and the promises you have
[4:17] and the value of them you won't fight
[4:18] for them but when you see how great the
[4:21] promises god has given you
[4:23] you'll fight for and you'll ask yourself
[4:25] yourself the question
[4:27] what is between me and my promises
[4:30] father we pray you'll bless the word
[4:32] today bless those who have gathered
[4:34] and those that are listening on
[4:35] streaming we pray the holy ghost
[4:37] will speak through your ministers not
[4:39] only here but around the world lord i
[4:41] pray that your bride your chosen people
[4:44] wherever they may be i pray they would
[4:46] be ministered to
[4:48] the lord they find that faith in the
[4:49] word of god
[4:51] lord jesus that we would see an end to
[4:53] this pandemic and an end to these
[4:55] viruses and different things i pray
[4:57] father that you will bless and heal your
[5:00] people lord
[5:01] god we stand with the blood of jesus
[5:03] christ against any
[5:04] sickness that would try to take
[5:05] someone's life lord we don't stand in
[5:08] fear
[5:09] but we stand in faith lord jesus i pray
[5:12] today your spirit would sweep through
[5:13] this place
[5:15] god i pray that would take hard hearts
[5:17] and humble them father
[5:19] heart hearts and soften them before your
[5:21] presence
[5:22] lord i yield my vessel to you that lives
[5:25] can be changed not because of paul
[5:26] lafontaine
[5:27] but lord because there's a substance of
[5:30] your spirit
[5:31] here that loves us enough lord to draw
[5:33] us close to you
[5:34] i pray that everyone that's not in a
[5:36] relationship today with you
[5:38] would come into a close relationship
[5:39] with you i pray they'd be able to see to
[5:41] remove in their lives
[5:43] what it is that keeps them back lord
[5:45] from a total relationship with you
[5:47] lord they may pray to you and many
[5:49] people pray sometimes unbelievers pray
[5:52] lord
[5:52] god let it be a closer relationship than
[5:55] just praying when we're in trouble
[5:57] but let there be a a holy ghost
[5:59] relationship
[6:01] between god and his people sons and
[6:03] daughters of god
[6:04] rising to the hour that we're living in
[6:06] and living in relationship with you
[6:09] i pray father that you'll bless everyone
[6:11] who's gathered today and bless your word
[6:13] anoint it father
[6:14] take me out of the way now that your
[6:16] word can go forth
[6:17] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[6:20] ask it amen everybody said amen
[6:22] god bless you amen you may be seated
[6:26] so we find from these scriptures that we
[6:28] read that there is
[6:29] the promise and the promise is a
[6:32] relationship
[6:34] with god and the relationship is even
[6:36] deeper than a sons and daughter
[6:38] relationship with god it's even deeper
[6:40] than that it's a husband and wife it's
[6:42] christ and his bride
[6:43] that's a more intimate relationship and
[6:46] that's the relationship that we're
[6:47] coming into
[6:48] it's about relationship the message
[6:51] itself is about
[6:52] restoring relationship can you say man
[6:55] the the the message itself is about
[6:58] restoring
[6:59] relationship that had been broken
[7:02] by creeds and dogmas and different ideas
[7:04] and the world
[7:05] and so the promise is the relationship
[7:08] the battle is removing anything between
[7:11] you and that relationship
[7:13] and so the question today is what is
[7:15] between
[7:16] you and the promises of god only you can
[7:19] know that only you can ask that question
[7:22] if the promise is so great and they
[7:24] belong to you
[7:25] what is it that's between you and the
[7:27] promises
[7:29] and are you willing to remove those
[7:30] things now i just want to
[7:33] uh this morning step back and just be
[7:35] real
[7:36] practical uh and real simple
[7:40] and the reason sometimes we just have to
[7:42] lay out a foundational thing
[7:44] and this will be what the message is or
[7:46] the motive of god sending the message
[7:48] and the motive of william branham
[7:50] who we preach here as being a
[7:51] fulfillment of malachi 4 to bring us
[7:54] back
[7:55] to the faith the original faith that was
[7:56] delivered to the saints
[7:58] because there are things that float
[7:59] around to de-establish the value of that
[8:03] then sometimes the waters get a little
[8:05] bit muddy
[8:06] as far as what this is and it becomes
[8:09] complicated
[8:10] our beautiful message that god sent over
[8:12] resurrection at the last days
[8:14] that message becomes complicated in
[8:17] people's eyes
[8:18] because of what they read many times on
[8:20] the post and the different
[8:22] uh people things people are saying the
[8:24] waters get muddy
[8:25] and the the term the message gets
[8:28] clouded by so many different ideas and
[8:31] complications
[8:32] but i want to read something right from
[8:35] the prophet
[8:36] who said his motive this morning and i
[8:38] always tie back to this
[8:40] to to show us that the enemy's work
[8:43] has been great to cloud people's view
[8:45] and the value of the message
[8:47] but let the prophet answer in his own
[8:49] words what his motives are
[8:51] and the purpose of him coming and the
[8:53] purpose of what the message is and this
[8:55] is a personal motive
[8:56] so we're going to get real basic here
[8:58] and like i said the reason that we have
[9:00] to say this
[9:01] is because there's such damage from the
[9:04] enemy to damage the name of the message
[9:07] to complicate and confuse people that
[9:10] that even that term
[9:11] people run from it and are afraid from
[9:13] it that's the enemy's work
[9:14] something so wonderful that god has
[9:16] blessed you with to bring you back to a
[9:18] relationship to jesus christ
[9:20] and satan attacks it to make you
[9:22] hesitant of it
[9:25] and so this in his own words if you guys
[9:26] have that first quote
[9:28] in his own words i'd really like to have
[9:30] it up not for one moment
[9:32] do i bring a message to the people that
[9:35] they might
[9:36] follow me or join my church
[9:39] or start some fellowship and
[9:41] organization
[9:43] let's hear in his own words not for one
[9:45] moment do i bring a message to the
[9:46] people
[9:47] that they may follow me or join my
[9:49] church you say well aren't we supposed
[9:51] to follow the prophet
[9:52] like we did paul he was the prophet he
[9:54] said follow me
[9:55] as i follow christ how are we following
[9:59] william bradham the christ
[10:00] that's in william branham that led us
[10:02] into a relationship with jesus christ
[10:04] but the man we don't follow the man
[10:07] because brother adam told us not to here
[10:10] not for one moment do i bring a message
[10:12] to the people that they may follow me
[10:14] or join my church or start some
[10:16] fellowship and organization
[10:18] i have never done that and will not do
[10:20] that you say well
[10:21] my this sure seems a lot of orgasm
[10:24] organizational things started
[10:25] that wasn't brother branham's doings
[10:27] that was somebody else trying to build
[10:29] off of it
[10:31] i have never done that and will not do
[10:33] that now i have no interest in those
[10:35] things but i do
[10:36] have an interest in the things of god
[10:39] and
[10:39] people and if i can accomplish just
[10:45] the next quote if i can accomplish just
[10:49] one thing i will be satisfied that one
[10:52] thing
[10:53] is to see established a true
[10:56] spiritual relationship between god
[11:00] and men there's a motive of a prophet i
[11:04] don't care what you've heard people say
[11:05] about him
[11:06] this is his motive not to build his own
[11:09] kingdom
[11:10] not to build some new denomination he
[11:13] preached against that
[11:15] and so anybody who does that is not from
[11:17] the motive of this man or the holy ghost
[11:20] his motive is to see whatever he can do
[11:22] to point people to the word
[11:24] to see a true look at we're talking
[11:26] about it again relationship
[11:27] that's what it's about a true
[11:28] relationship between god and men
[11:31] that god could use this message that you
[11:33] come into a greater relationship with
[11:35] jesus christ can you say amen
[11:38] that i could see a true rep a spiritual
[11:40] relationship between god and men
[11:42] wherein men become new creations in
[11:44] christ
[11:45] filled with his spirit and live
[11:48] according
[11:49] to his word i think that's a good desire
[11:53] i think it's good for us to see that
[11:55] desire
[11:56] i think it's good for us to desire that
[11:59] desire
[12:01] i want to be that new creation that's
[12:04] filled with the spirit
[12:05] and lives according to the word i
[12:07] believe the message
[12:08] that's brought us back to the true bible
[12:11] doctrine
[12:12] and through by back to the word i
[12:14] believe the message has brought me to
[12:16] that in jesus christ
[12:17] to be a new creation filled with the
[12:19] spirit and live according to his word
[12:21] i would invite plead and warn all to
[12:24] hear
[12:24] his voice at this time and yield
[12:27] yourselves completely to him
[12:30] even as i trust in my heart that i have
[12:32] given
[12:33] my all to him god bless you and may his
[12:36] coming
[12:37] rejoice your heart every few years i
[12:41] read this because i feel like this is
[12:42] the last
[12:43] paragraph in the church age book every
[12:46] few years i like to read this because it
[12:47] brings us back to perspective
[12:52] why do i have to do that because satan
[12:54] does his work to just distort
[12:56] and a bunch of things come under the
[12:58] name of message that
[13:00] to me aren't the original motive
[13:03] an idolizing a deifying of the man
[13:09] and so if you feel that i've that way of
[13:12] course you you've misread me
[13:14] because that's not true why do we read
[13:15] so much from him here
[13:17] because he was the spirit of elijah to
[13:19] bring us back
[13:20] but if you stay here long enough you
[13:22] realize it is certainly not
[13:24] about a man it's about christ
[13:28] you're not going to catch that maybe in
[13:29] one service but you're going to catch it
[13:31] and realize
[13:31] we're not about a man around here we're
[13:34] about christ
[13:36] and so i like to read that because it
[13:38] brings us back to the perspective
[13:40] of what his motive was i and you know
[13:42] what it was
[13:44] i want to see a relationship between you
[13:47] and christ
[13:49] now i'm going to take this a little bit
[13:51] further this morning but i want to
[13:53] establish that is that
[13:54] that's what he came to do that's what
[13:56] the message was sent to do is to see a
[13:58] relationship now
[14:00] if you've come to a religion through it
[14:02] and everything is just do's and doubts
[14:03] to you
[14:04] and it's just become some other code to
[14:06] live by
[14:07] that just shows something's missing in
[14:09] your life
[14:11] because it's not meant to do that he
[14:13] never was meant for you to come in some
[14:16] routine and code to live by and i've got
[14:18] to do this out of fear
[14:19] he never his motive was is that you come
[14:21] into relationship
[14:23] with jesus christ you take a hold of the
[14:25] promises of jesus christ
[14:27] and when you take a hold of the promises
[14:29] and you come into union with him
[14:32] you'll never see this thing as rituals
[14:35] and do's and don'ts
[14:37] and so the next quote is just taking it
[14:39] a bit a little bit further
[14:40] i'd like them to pull it up and this is
[14:42] what he says now
[14:44] later on in the prophet's ministry he
[14:46] come to a transition
[14:47] and that transition was moving from all
[14:50] of the
[14:51] the miracles and signs and things that
[14:53] took place in his life
[14:54] all you have to do is get on the
[14:55] internet and check this out is that
[14:56] there was a lot of
[14:57] there was a big healing campaign that
[14:59] took place brother brano's ministry was
[15:01] kind of the spearhead of that many of
[15:03] the healing ministers say that
[15:05] but many ministers oral roberts and all
[15:06] of them spirit had a great healing
[15:08] revival
[15:09] of the 1940s 1950s and went around the
[15:12] world and was many ministers that we
[15:13] could talk about
[15:14] but you see now something begin to
[15:16] change as we realize
[15:18] that god when he catches the people's
[15:21] attention by great
[15:23] signs it's not just that we say in signs
[15:26] and wonders
[15:27] but that we come into relationship
[15:29] deeper with jesus christ
[15:31] god could heal you and you never come
[15:34] into a deeper relationship with him
[15:36] you could be healed of cancer you could
[15:38] be blind eyes open and you never come
[15:40] into the relationship
[15:41] so when god flashes and shows that i'm
[15:44] powerful i'm able to do this
[15:45] i can raise the dead i can open up the
[15:47] blinded eyes it's not just you can sit
[15:50] there and say well praise god he can do
[15:51] it
[15:52] it's so that it draws your attention in
[15:54] and
[15:55] now the prophet begins to show you the
[15:57] word jesus christ
[15:58] so you come into relationship with him
[16:02] and if it doesn't accomplish that it's
[16:03] not accomplished anything
[16:05] so as he come into a transition in his
[16:08] ministry now if you read the books which
[16:10] i have many of them that read given
[16:13] their diagnosis of william branham
[16:16] okay i don't know why i'm being so plain
[16:18] on this this morning but we're just
[16:19] taking our time being plain on it
[16:21] if you've read the books you're going to
[16:23] find the conclusion brother
[16:25] branham was a great prophet or he was a
[16:27] great man of god
[16:28] he had great healing revivals as a
[16:31] matter of fact most of them say
[16:32] nobody had the accuracy in speaking of
[16:35] speaking someone uh what the problem
[16:38] they had
[16:38] in the prayer lines no one had the
[16:40] accuracy it was from all of them it was
[16:42] 100 accurate
[16:43] and there wasn't any flaws in it it
[16:45] wasn't just guessing saying
[16:47] i think somebody out there in tv land
[16:49] has heart trouble
[16:50] i'm seeing they have heart trouble of
[16:51] course somebody out in tv land has heart
[16:53] trouble
[16:54] that wasn't what this is about this is
[16:56] about christ working through someone
[16:58] that
[16:59] by vision he could see what the person
[17:01] had
[17:02] he could give their house number and
[17:04] that's beyond just
[17:05] human that's god showing i'm alive again
[17:09] and i can i know your house number did
[17:11] you know god knows your house number
[17:13] this morning
[17:13] he still knows your house number he
[17:15] knows where you live but you see now
[17:17] as he come into a transition he begin to
[17:20] see that it wasn't just going to stay
[17:22] all the healing and these books will say
[17:24] he was a great man of god but he got off
[17:27] at the end of his ministry
[17:29] every one of them was saying he was a
[17:31] great man as far as miracles and we'll
[17:33] follow him matter of fact i don't know
[17:34] if you've
[17:34] seen it recently on the internet all
[17:36] these ministers now
[17:38] a lot of them have picked up this little
[17:40] thing about him speaking the seven
[17:42] visions
[17:43] and all of them have come to pass and
[17:45] the sixth one was
[17:46] i see a great woman rising to become
[17:49] president or vice president and i see
[17:52] her dressed in a purple
[17:53] outfit and then the seventh so all six
[17:58] visions have been fulfilled since 1933
[18:00] he's seen mussolini he's seen hitler
[18:03] come to a mysterious end
[18:04] he's seen the cars in the advancement of
[18:06] science he's seen women get the vote
[18:08] he's seen all
[18:09] and it's all happened and now we have a
[18:11] woman that's standing taking the oath
[18:13] who's in a purple outfit
[18:17] they're all jumping onto it and they're
[18:19] reading it could this be my
[18:21] it's so accurate this is amazing
[18:24] interesting though they won't read the
[18:25] rest of the message
[18:28] and pentecostals they tend to jump to
[18:30] the visions part of it all the visions
[18:32] and the profit
[18:33] and all that they jump to those things
[18:35] but they don't want to look at the
[18:36] resume they never accept the rest of
[18:38] this
[18:39] you see so so so you you see then
[18:42] when they say he he did find until he
[18:45] got off to the end what they mean
[18:47] is is that god was bringing them deeper
[18:50] into something to bring the people into
[18:52] relationship
[18:53] with the word because you could be
[18:57] in a healing revival and see the
[19:00] greatest miracles
[19:01] and still not be in relationship with
[19:03] jesus christ
[19:05] still not come to oneness with him and
[19:08] so
[19:09] that's their conclusion but as he come
[19:11] to this transition now i'm ready for the
[19:13] quote
[19:14] as he come to this transition he
[19:15] explained it many ways this is one way
[19:17] he said it in one place that goes along
[19:19] with our series on joshua
[19:21] 1961 he says about three o'clock in the
[19:23] morning i suppose i had gotten up and i
[19:25] looked where in front of me and i was
[19:26] coming down to the jordan there's a
[19:27] vision now our dream
[19:29] looked like i was standing on the map of
[19:31] palestine
[19:32] and i was coming down to the jordan and
[19:34] it seemed like i could hear the song
[19:37] i'm going down to jordan
[19:40] and somebody was singing it and as i
[19:42] drew near the river
[19:44] i looked back and seen which away i had
[19:46] come
[19:47] and i was two-thirds of the way there to
[19:49] the jordan
[19:51] and i looked across so all these visions
[19:53] speak up a furthering of his ministry
[19:56] and what this was be is that we're
[19:57] coming out of
[19:59] the wilderness as moses brought the
[20:01] people out of the wilderness and said
[20:03] joshua
[20:04] it's time to take the people into the
[20:06] promised land
[20:07] this same thing is happening in the last
[20:10] days
[20:10] that the prophet brought the people out
[20:12] of egypt which means the world
[20:15] or denominational systems coming out of
[20:18] egypt to the promised land
[20:21] to all the promises of god that lay in
[20:23] the word for us
[20:24] and this is the transition and so he'll
[20:26] move out of
[20:27] just moses in the wilderness showing
[20:30] mighty signs of opening up the red sea
[20:32] and and uh providing manner for the
[20:35] people who were hungry and providing
[20:37] water
[20:37] to the people who got thirsty my was so
[20:40] wonderful and great and yet the people
[20:41] stayed immature
[20:43] in their complaining by seeing miracles
[20:45] there wasn't enough there was never
[20:46] enough
[20:48] there was never enough miracles now
[20:50] moses said i'm going to go joshua you're
[20:52] going to come
[20:53] finally to the commission and that's
[20:55] there and so was brother brahms come
[20:57] into this
[20:58] and i looked across jordan and i said oh
[21:00] praise
[21:01] god just on the other side is where all
[21:05] the promises lay every promise
[21:08] lays in the promised land this is the
[21:11] transition of his ministry what's next
[21:14] what's next well it's it hasn't gone off
[21:16] his motive of a relationship
[21:18] but all the promises of god are laying
[21:20] before us
[21:21] and i'll bring the people by the grace
[21:23] of god into
[21:24] all of their promises that lay in this
[21:26] book ties together with revelations 5
[21:29] when he takes the book the lamb takes
[21:31] the book and
[21:33] the book of redemption is sealed in
[21:36] other words
[21:37] it can't be it can't be seen in the way
[21:39] it should be seen to bring
[21:40] all the redemption and all the promises
[21:43] of god back to the people again
[21:44] and we find the book open in revelations
[21:46] 10 and when it's open that means oh
[21:49] we're in a land of all of his promises
[21:52] being given back to all of his believers
[21:54] somebody say praise the lord he said
[21:56] praise god i'm looking across right now
[21:59] and i'm seeing all the promises of god
[22:02] laying ahead of me
[22:05] i think that's wonderful and when the
[22:07] transition and
[22:08] ministry took place it was bringing the
[22:10] bride into all the promises of god
[22:13] so that to me is a simple explanation of
[22:16] the message as well
[22:17] looking and seeing all the promises of
[22:19] god
[22:20] the joshua commission and i'm just going
[22:23] to say
[22:24] that everything that the prophet
[22:26] preached
[22:27] everything that you have heard
[22:28] everything that you feed on
[22:30] the purpose of it goes back to these two
[22:32] things and that is
[22:33] to bring you into relationship with
[22:36] christ
[22:36] can you say amen and for you to take all
[22:39] the promises that are yours
[22:42] amen to bring us to those promises to
[22:45] get us to see those things
[22:47] also that's between us and the promise
[22:49] because when we feed on the message and
[22:51] read it
[22:52] when we hear preachers today true gospel
[22:55] ministers you know what they're
[22:56] preaching
[22:57] they're preaching the same motive to
[22:59] bring you into relationship and into the
[23:01] promises of god
[23:02] but also if you're under a holy ghost
[23:04] minister you're going to hear the holy
[23:06] ghost tell you
[23:08] of things that are in between you and
[23:11] your promises
[23:12] and sometimes it gets very convicting
[23:17] because all of you have a soul all of
[23:19] you have something within you i'm
[23:20] trusting everybody in this building has
[23:22] somebody everybody listening
[23:24] has something within them or you
[23:25] wouldn't be listening to me
[23:27] there's something within you to that
[23:29] that's responding and that's hungry
[23:31] for something not me
[23:35] not me i'm just here because dad mom
[23:37] told me to be here i'm just here because
[23:38] it's time to go to church
[23:40] i don't believe that i believe there's
[23:43] something within you
[23:44] maybe it's dormant maybe it's hidden
[23:46] maybe it's
[23:47] covered over with a bunch of whatever
[23:51] but i'm going to believe that there's a
[23:52] hunger within you
[23:55] and when you hear holy ghost preaching
[23:57] sometimes
[23:59] it's going to preach things that you
[24:01] didn't realize wow
[24:02] there's something standing between me
[24:04] and the promises of god
[24:06] everybody listening there's something
[24:10] in between me and taking all of his
[24:12] promises because these promises are
[24:14] yours
[24:15] they're not just brother paul's they're
[24:16] not just for the branhams they're not
[24:18] just gideons they're not just for the
[24:19] kinney they're not just
[24:20] no these are your promises this is your
[24:24] inheritance
[24:25] you see well i'm kind of a different
[24:28] bird you know
[24:29] no you're not you have a soul
[24:32] i'm kind of in a different category will
[24:34] you put yourself in a different category
[24:38] these promises are not to just a
[24:41] selective thing it's for the bride of
[24:42] jesus christ
[24:43] and if there's a hunger on the inside
[24:45] which i believe there is in you
[24:47] there the only reason that you are not
[24:49] enjoying and taking all of it in a real
[24:52] filling of the spirit is because there's
[24:54] something
[24:55] in between you and the promise
[24:58] can you say man and so to remove all
[25:01] those things if someone gets an
[25:03] inheritance
[25:04] and a dad or a grandpa promised an
[25:06] inheritance to somebody
[25:07] but they lived in texas okay you'd be
[25:11] looking at what's the hindrances to me
[25:12] going and getting my money
[25:14] what's the hindrances to that because
[25:16] the you have the inheritance it is yours
[25:18] but you've got to remove the hindrances
[25:20] you've got to remove the distance
[25:22] between it
[25:22] so you'll probably have to purchase a
[25:24] plane ticket you'll probably have to
[25:26] sacrifice
[25:26] and put some money in the car to make
[25:28] the trip to texas but are you willing to
[25:30] do it because it's yours can you say man
[25:33] you've got to remove all the
[25:34] encumbrances and hindrances and all the
[25:36] stuff
[25:37] in between you and the promise to take
[25:39] your promise
[25:41] and this sunday excuse me not this
[25:43] sunday but next sunday
[25:45] the holy spirit just through this this
[25:47] time of being locked into my house for
[25:49] almost three weeks
[25:50] had really begun to open some practical
[25:52] things that get un
[25:53] between us and the promise and i
[25:54] probably won't get to until next sunday
[25:56] but if you'll come
[25:57] we're going to talk about simple things
[25:59] that the devil uses keeping you from the
[26:01] promises
[26:02] they're in the bible they're in the
[26:03] message they show us they're simple
[26:05] things
[26:05] but if we could just remove them say god
[26:07] take that out of the way
[26:08] you'd be a different person you'd live a
[26:11] different life can you say math
[26:13] it's something personally to you that's
[26:16] in between you
[26:17] sometimes people get in a way i found a
[26:19] wonderful scripture in joshua that says
[26:21] actually god hardened the heart i'm
[26:24] going to give you this one
[26:25] god hardened the heart of the enemy god
[26:28] hardened their hearts and made them
[26:29] even more vicious so that it would drive
[26:32] israel
[26:32] to go for their promise even more i said
[26:35] can you imagine
[26:36] god is working on the other end of
[26:39] people to make those people mad at you
[26:43] anybody ever had anybody mad at you
[26:47] just okay one all right two three of us
[26:50] four and you're wondering why have they
[26:53] changed what is going on
[26:54] they're treating me so bad what has
[26:56] taken place in these people's life
[26:58] and according to that scripture god
[27:00] could be working on the other side
[27:02] to drive you to say i'm going to fight
[27:04] for my promises
[27:07] and you get mad at the people but it
[27:08] could be god
[27:10] making other people gossip at you and
[27:12] say things about you or come down in you
[27:14] and say lies about you and you get mad
[27:17] at them all you want to
[27:18] but if god's working on them to make you
[27:21] rise up and get some grit and say
[27:23] i'm going to take my promise anyway can
[27:26] i get an amen this morning
[27:27] i want you to see what's in between you
[27:30] and the promise
[27:31] because on the other side of this over
[27:33] jordan is a great great spiritual
[27:35] awakening for you
[27:36] a great life of freedom from people's
[27:39] opinions
[27:40] how many like to be free from people's
[27:42] opinions how many like to destroy the
[27:44] enemy in your life
[27:46] and so through this time i i wrote down
[27:48] a bunch of things and trust me
[27:50] i hope i can end this because i got a
[27:51] lot after three weeks in the house i got
[27:53] a lot of hay on my fork friends
[27:55] i got a lot of sermons something open to
[27:57] me about jonah that i'd never seen
[27:59] before
[27:59] i got to do a whole series on jonah
[28:02] would anybody like to come out the next
[28:03] seven nights and hear it
[28:06] i got a lot you know this is the only
[28:08] bad thing about being closed in the
[28:10] house for me
[28:11] that long for you is that i got a lot of
[28:13] hay on my floor
[28:14] a lot of things to preach i thank god
[28:16] for them
[28:18] this is one is to break down what is it
[28:20] between you and the promise
[28:22] what is it between you and the promises
[28:24] because that's everything can you say
[28:25] amen
[28:27] so if the
[28:32] if you read things in the message and
[28:33] you read things and you hear
[28:35] gospel ministers just remember if it has
[28:38] this
[28:39] motive of bringing you into relationship
[28:42] and bringing to you into promises you
[28:44] shouldn't quickly jumped
[28:45] to say he's out to get me
[28:49] because to me the way i see the message
[28:52] is everything that he was saying
[28:54] was for the purpose of removing the
[28:57] obstacles
[28:59] and for me to take all the promises of
[29:01] god
[29:03] everything everything right down to what
[29:05] we call dress code
[29:06] everything is what's the hindrance to
[29:09] you coming into the promises of god
[29:15] so and the preaching is still today even
[29:17] though the prophet's gone the holy ghost
[29:18] how many believe holy ghost still
[29:19] preaching is still going on
[29:21] and if that's happening if there's a
[29:23] holy ghost in that preacher
[29:25] he is not your enemy he's actually your
[29:27] best friend
[29:29] oh praise the lord
[29:32] that's not your enemy he's actually one
[29:34] of your best friends
[29:36] if he gets under the anointing of the
[29:38] holy ghost and says what your promises
[29:41] are
[29:41] and says what's in between you and the
[29:43] promises that is your greatest friend
[29:45] you say god
[29:45] thank you lord today for encouraging me
[29:48] thank you lord today for using that man
[29:50] to show me another promise of mine
[29:52] thank you lord today that guy today he
[29:54] took the very height off of my back but
[29:56] thank you lord
[29:57] because i see my promises lay it ahead
[30:00] and i want to take my promises
[30:02] praise the lord it's how you look at it
[30:05] can you say amen
[30:07] praise the lord and so we see that he's
[30:10] your best friend
[30:11] and because under the holy ghost he will
[30:12] pinpoint whatever it is between you and
[30:15] the promises of god is that okay with
[30:16] everybody
[30:17] so what's the message about connecting
[30:19] you and god's promises in this hour
[30:21] that's it
[30:22] that's what the message is all about i
[30:24] don't care what somebody has told you
[30:26] what the message is
[30:27] and the people of the message get that
[30:29] out of your mind the message is you
[30:32] being connected to your promises
[30:35] that's what this message was set to do
[30:37] you you
[30:38] no not brother paul you this morning the
[30:41] message came
[30:42] so that you could connect with
[30:43] relationship with christ and come to all
[30:45] the promises he's given you
[30:47] that's what the message is for that's
[30:49] why i sent it
[30:50] don't let anybody complicate it in your
[30:52] mind can you say man
[30:54] it's about you it's about the promises
[30:56] it's not about people
[30:58] it's you and the promises of god and
[31:01] what is in between you and that
[31:03] and it has to be about you and him
[31:06] only you got to come in that secret
[31:09] place with you and him only
[31:12] one day for everybody's life it can't be
[31:14] about you god and your wife or you god
[31:16] and your husband or you god and your
[31:18] pastor
[31:18] it's got to be about you and god
[31:23] where do you where are you are you
[31:26] in relationship with him you can't get
[31:29] you can't come
[31:30] because an emotional decision just i no
[31:34] you have to say lord if all of my family
[31:37] and everybody was removed
[31:39] what do i have with you
[31:42] if my wife quit coming to church where
[31:45] do i stand in my relationship with you
[31:49] if ten thousand fall by my right hand
[31:51] and twenty thousand by my left as david
[31:53] quoted it there
[31:54] it shall not come nigh unto me i'm in a
[31:57] relationship with him and i'm going
[31:59] forward i'm not going back
[32:00] as the song said this morning we won't
[32:02] go back
[32:04] to the way it used to be if no one goes
[32:06] forward i want to go forward with the
[32:08] promises of god
[32:09] i want to move on many people i want my
[32:12] family to go with me i want my daughter
[32:13] to be saved i want my family to keep
[32:16] praying for them
[32:16] but don't let them hold you back
[32:20] can i get an amen this morning don't let
[32:22] a girlfriend hold you back
[32:23] don't let a boyfriend hold you back
[32:25] don't let the things you're looking at
[32:27] on your phone
[32:28] stop letting it hold you back can you
[32:30] say a man kill that thing and say lord
[32:32] i don't want anything to come between
[32:34] you and ours relationship
[32:36] i want to be close to the lord i want to
[32:38] stay close to him and i won't go back to
[32:40] the way it used to be everybody else in
[32:42] the family can go back
[32:44] everybody if if if everybody leaves this
[32:47] thing
[32:48] i'm not going anywhere
[32:51] praise the lord
[32:54] so i want to say something this morning
[32:57] about the promises of god
[32:59] a little bit because if you don't see
[33:02] what the promises are
[33:04] and the value of them and that they're
[33:07] yours
[33:08] you won't fight for them you won't
[33:10] remove things
[33:11] that's in the way because you don't see
[33:13] the value of the promise of god
[33:15] his promises are his word his promises
[33:19] they are
[33:20] they have their beginnings in the
[33:22] thoughts of god
[33:23] before the foundation of the world i'm
[33:25] being real basic again
[33:27] not assuming that everybody understands
[33:29] all this that i'm assuming
[33:30] you might not understand it if you don't
[33:33] understand the promises of god then you
[33:35] won't fight for him
[33:37] valued they are what god has given you
[33:39] in the promises that lay in this bible
[33:42] you can't just believe them you have to
[33:44] possess them
[33:47] you can't just profess them you have to
[33:49] possess them
[33:51] and possessing is taking them you can't
[33:54] just say i believe that's the promise of
[33:56] god you say
[33:56] but is it am i taking it is it mine
[34:00] or is it just my mom and dads or is it
[34:01] just my uncles or is it just the pastors
[34:04] are these promises mine or am i a
[34:07] spectator
[34:08] am i a arms link christian am i just
[34:11] keeping one foot
[34:12] in because i know that it's the truth
[34:15] and so i don't want
[34:16] but i'm just keeping one foot in to be
[34:17] safe you're not really safe
[34:19] if you're stretching your foot like that
[34:21] you could fall
[34:25] why are you putting just one foot in
[34:27] find out what you believe
[34:29] fi this is not a profession it's a
[34:31] possession it's taking it for yourself
[34:34] it's having the grit to say i don't care
[34:36] if any and not
[34:37] no other young people in this church get
[34:39] a hold of it i'm going to grab a hold of
[34:40] this thing
[34:42] not waiting for someone else to take the
[34:44] promises they're my promises
[34:46] i'm taking them for myself so promises
[34:49] are
[34:49] what he established in his thoughts
[34:51] before the foundation of the world
[34:53] not making them up as he goes along god
[34:55] doesn't make up his promises
[34:57] as he goes along and god doesn't break
[34:59] his promises
[35:00] all the mistrust today we live in a land
[35:03] everybody breaks trust everybody's
[35:04] misread
[35:05] you can't trust anybody from car dealers
[35:07] all the way through the government you
[35:08] can't trust any of them
[35:10] can't trust the president you can't you
[35:12] can't trust any of them to follow
[35:14] through
[35:14] promises are broken over and over again
[35:16] that's why it's hard for people to
[35:17] believe god's promises
[35:21] but i want to establish this morning
[35:22] that they are promises of god are just
[35:25] not being made up as he goes along and
[35:27] he hopes to keep them
[35:28] they were in his mind before the
[35:29] foundation of the world established
[35:32] for every age he made a promise for
[35:34] every age and he promised and then
[35:36] when it came to that age he spoke it
[35:38] through a prophet and when he
[35:39] spoke it it had a power within it and
[35:41] it's as good as done
[35:44] can you say man and so that's the part i
[35:46] want to get to but
[35:47] we're just number one it's his word
[35:50] unfailing but number two it's unfailing
[35:52] promises of god are unfailing there is
[35:54] no chance
[35:55] that the promises of god can fail they
[35:57] have never failed
[35:59] the bible says heavens and earth will
[36:01] pass away but his word
[36:02] can never fail his word will never pass
[36:06] away
[36:07] how secure is that find anything else in
[36:10] your life that that's it's that secure
[36:14] fi i i challenge you to find any
[36:18] almost any relationship that's as secure
[36:22] as this one that his promises if he
[36:25] makes him
[36:26] will never has never will never
[36:29] fail there's no element of failure in
[36:32] god's promise
[36:34] when he says he will do something in a
[36:36] generation
[36:37] he will fulfill it he'll follow through
[36:42] wasn't it john the baptist that says if
[36:44] if these don't
[36:46] or jesus said if these hold their peace
[36:47] the very rocks will cry out
[36:50] if you don't praise the lord god's going
[36:52] to raise up something to praise him
[36:54] he's going to fulfill his word promises
[36:57] of god
[36:58] do not fail there is no element of
[37:01] failure in them can you say amen
[37:03] promises of god have a power in them
[37:06] when they are believed and they
[37:08] are possessed they have a power in them
[37:10] to make the promise live and that's what
[37:13] we find in the message is that he gave
[37:14] us promise to every generation
[37:16] because i just seen a video a couple
[37:18] days of somebody who was
[37:20] just trying to knock that out the the
[37:22] message taught us that he gave his word
[37:24] to every generation he allotted a
[37:25] certain word to every generation
[37:26] he allotted a promise to every
[37:28] generation believers come in that
[37:30] generation
[37:31] and they believe the promise for the
[37:32] hour but it's not them that live it as
[37:35] much as there's a
[37:36] power within the promise that if they'll
[37:38] possess that promise
[37:40] there's power within it to cause that to
[37:42] be lived out
[37:44] i'm proof of that here this morning i'm
[37:47] walking in all kinds of word just by
[37:50] being here at church this morning
[37:54] i'm walking in the scriptures just by
[37:56] being here i'm the bible says for
[37:57] ministers to feed the flock
[37:59] guess what i'm feeding the flock i'm
[38:02] walking right in the promise of god i'm
[38:05] assembled together
[38:06] i've come together and and and so you
[38:09] know the
[38:10] the the the promises of god have the
[38:13] power in them
[38:14] to fulfill the promise of that day
[38:18] by the holy ghost in other words the
[38:20] strength of the promise
[38:22] does not rely on you but
[38:25] god to fulfill it the promises of god is
[38:29] like a covenant of god
[38:31] and a covenant of god when god makes a
[38:34] covenant
[38:35] and it doesn't fail unless he makes a
[38:38] covenant with you
[38:40] in other words if you're the other side
[38:41] of the deal every time god did that it
[38:43] never worked because there was an
[38:45] element of failure in it
[38:47] with the covenant i'm talking about this
[38:49] morning he makes a covenant by himself
[38:52] if you turn with me to hebrews
[38:54] chapter six
[38:57] this is how sure it is this is the
[38:59] covenant of god
[39:01] hebrews 6 and i knew i wouldn't get too
[39:04] far this morning but hopefully i'm
[39:05] getting
[39:06] far enough that you can see my heart and
[39:09] see where we're going with this
[39:12] hebrews 6 and verse 13 says for when god
[39:14] made a promise to abraham
[39:16] made promised abraham because he could
[39:17] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[39:22] saying surely blessing i will bless thee
[39:24] and multiplying i will multiply thee
[39:27] and so now look at this abraham is given
[39:29] the promise for his day
[39:32] god says it and god swears by himself so
[39:35] somebody makes a promise i swear by it
[39:38] because he could swear by no greater god
[39:40] swore by himself
[39:42] okay he didn't make a covenant with you
[39:44] and make a deal with you
[39:46] he didn't make a deal with me he just
[39:48] said this is your promise
[39:50] and i swear by it it will come to pass
[39:52] that's pretty strong
[39:55] blessing i will bless thee multiplying
[39:56] and multiply the and so after he had
[39:58] patiently endured
[39:59] he obtained the promise that's one of
[40:02] the scriptures we'll talk about next
[40:04] sunday
[40:04] that's something in between you and the
[40:06] promise impatience
[40:11] because when abraham
[40:14] patiently endured he obtained
[40:17] the promise so if you got an impatient
[40:20] problem
[40:22] with the promises of god you've got to
[40:24] say lord remove
[40:26] this impatient problem i know nobody in
[40:29] here at all
[40:30] has any problem like that that's only me
[40:35] verse 16 for men verily swear by the
[40:37] greater an oath for confirmation is to
[40:39] them and end of all strife so
[40:41] when they swear by something to make a
[40:42] promise they swear by someone
[40:45] greater than them wherein god willing
[40:47] more abundantly to show unto the ears of
[40:48] promise
[40:49] the immutability of his counsel in other
[40:52] words the unchangingness of his counsel
[40:54] the
[40:55] impossibility for it to fail confirmed
[40:57] it by an
[40:58] oath that by two immutable things in
[41:01] which it was impossible for god to lie
[41:04] we might have a strong consolation who
[41:07] have fled for refuge to lay hold
[41:09] upon the hope center before why would
[41:11] you lay hold upon the hope side of
[41:12] fourth
[41:13] why would you lay hold of the promise of
[41:14] god why would you get the grit to say
[41:16] these promises are mine and i'm taking
[41:18] them up
[41:20] because you understand that this promise
[41:22] he swore by himself
[41:24] number one two immutable things number
[41:27] one he swore by himself
[41:29] there was no greater story sword by
[41:31] himself he didn't make a deal with you
[41:32] he swore by himself
[41:33] that's strong in itself but the second
[41:35] thing it's impossible
[41:37] for god to lie he's never lied
[41:42] and this provides a strong consolation
[41:45] to those who have fled to refuge to lay
[41:47] hold upon the hope that set before us
[41:50] the promise of god the covenant of god
[41:52] stands sure within itself
[41:54] can you say amen it will be done but it
[41:57] needs to be believed and it needs to be
[41:59] embraced
[42:00] and everything keeping you from it needs
[42:02] to be removed
[42:05] everything has got to be removed you've
[42:07] got to embrace it yourself
[42:11] so they have a pow
[42:14] let me say it in our terms here the
[42:16] promise of god is airtight
[42:18] it can't fail and
[42:22] they are enforced by god this is not a
[42:24] deal with you and god
[42:26] and hopefully your failure part will not
[42:28] ruin the deal
[42:29] it's not a deal with you and god he
[42:31] swore by himself i
[42:32] will fulfill it i will bless you abraham
[42:36] i will make you a father of many nations
[42:39] here's a man that's a grandpa already
[42:41] but he hasn't had any children or
[42:42] grandchildren
[42:43] but he's as old as a grandpa and he says
[42:45] i'm going to bless you
[42:46] with thousands of generations and
[42:48] thousands as the seeds
[42:50] as the sand of the sea and as the stars
[42:52] of heaven i'm giving you a promise
[42:54] talk about a promise to blow a grandpa's
[42:56] mind
[43:00] would it seem impossible to the human
[43:01] mind i'm sure
[43:03] abraham said me and my wife have tried
[43:06] to have children
[43:07] you know we can't help children why did
[43:09] you even choose us
[43:10] because we're not able to have children
[43:13] this has got to be
[43:14] somebody else's promise that's able to
[43:16] have kids
[43:18] god likes to make it as impossible as he
[43:22] can
[43:23] so to blow our minds so you see this
[43:26] doesn't depend on you
[43:28] you realize abraham standing said i
[43:29] can't contribute at all
[43:33] i don't know how this promise is going
[43:34] to happen but that's what i want you to
[43:35] see today
[43:36] i can't contribute to this at all i just
[43:39] need to believe it
[43:40] take it confess it possess it it's mine
[43:43] it's not this brothers it's another
[43:45] abraham said this is my promise
[43:47] and i don't know how he's going to do it
[43:49] but i'm taking it and i'm possessing it
[43:52] he started confessing it started saying
[43:53] to his wife you know the stories that
[43:54] brother brad says
[43:56] you know every day he said do you feel
[43:57] any different dear do you feel any
[43:58] different
[43:59] no sarah says i don't feel any different
[44:01] praise god abraham's praise out
[44:03] we're going to have a baby anyway sarah
[44:06] goes uh
[44:06] you know you're getting a little senile
[44:10] you're getting a little strange with
[44:11] this thing
[44:13] the next day you asked and saying you
[44:14] feel any different sarah you feel is
[44:16] there anything going on down there at
[44:18] all
[44:19] just a little twinge no i don't feel any
[44:22] different today abraham sorry
[44:24] he goes praise god we're going to have
[44:26] it anyhow
[44:27] it's coming and he prepared for it this
[44:31] is my promise
[44:33] i don't care if everything in science
[44:35] says and every doctor says we can't have
[44:37] children
[44:38] this promise is mine and it doesn't
[44:40] hinge upon
[44:41] my contribution to it he swore by
[44:44] himself
[44:45] it's going to happen and it's going to
[44:47] happen
[44:48] in me and sarah not any other couple
[44:51] it's for me and sarah you see how you
[44:54] got to believe it
[44:55] see how you got to possess it and
[44:58] brother brahma says he
[44:59] he bought the little rattlers or the
[45:01] little toys and he
[45:03] he you know painted the tint walls blue
[45:09] had a gender reveal
[45:12] blew up something it all
[45:16] spilled out blue everywhere
[45:20] i mean he believed this and he didn't
[45:22] just believe it this is my promise
[45:24] it's gonna happen he's 75 she's 75 he's
[45:28] 85 they're getting close to 100.
[45:29] he's still believing it because the
[45:31] bible says he staggered not
[45:33] at the promise of god he didn't stumble
[45:36] over his own mind that was saying
[45:38] you know there's no way for this to
[45:40] happen he staggered not at the promise
[45:42] because the promise
[45:44] strength of the promise stood alone with
[45:47] god to fulfill it
[45:49] it wasn't anything that he would inject
[45:51] and when he injected and made a deal
[45:54] it was wrong and it had failure in it if
[45:56] you inject with god
[45:58] it's going to have failure in it these
[46:01] promises that i'm preaching to you and
[46:02] this message has preached to you
[46:04] they are your promises but the strength
[46:06] of them is not to be
[46:08] fulfilled by anything that you
[46:10] necessarily contribute
[46:12] it's when you possess it say it's mine
[46:16] then the power of it begins to work in
[46:18] you and the impossibility of it
[46:20] happening
[46:22] starts to blow your mind and you realize
[46:23] this is happening in me this is
[46:25] happening now there's something
[46:26] happening to me there's something
[46:28] changing in me
[46:29] god's doing something in my life and
[46:31] it's because you remove the hindrances i
[46:33] don't care about
[46:34] other people i don't care what's been
[46:35] said it's just me and the lord and we
[46:38] got our thing
[46:39] going here together in a relationship
[46:41] going together
[46:42] and i'm starting to see the results
[46:45] of things that never could be changed in
[46:47] my life and now they're being changed
[46:50] not on your strength but on the strength
[46:52] of the promise
[46:53] somebody say amen this morning the
[46:56] strength of the covenant does not rely
[46:58] if you would turn with me to psalms 105.
[47:02] and i told you i would i'll be just a
[47:04] little longer but i just want to get to
[47:06] some of these
[47:07] look what this says about the covenant
[47:08] i've preached on this before a little
[47:09] bit
[47:10] but in psalms chapter 105
[47:14] it says 105 in verse 9. it says
[47:17] which covenant he made verse 8 he hath
[47:20] remembered his covenant forever the word
[47:22] which he commanded two thousand
[47:23] generations
[47:24] don't forget god never don't forget that
[47:26] god never forgets
[47:28] his promise he has remembered his
[47:31] covenant forever the word which he
[47:32] commanded a thousand generations
[47:34] which covenant he made with abraham and
[47:36] his oath unto isaac
[47:37] and confirmed the same unto jacob for a
[47:39] law and to israel for an everlasting
[47:41] covenant
[47:42] saying unto thee will i give the land of
[47:44] canaan and a lot of your heritage
[47:46] when they were but a few men in number
[47:48] yea
[47:49] very few and strangers in it
[47:52] when we went from one nation to another
[47:56] from one kingdom to another he suffered
[48:00] no man to do them wrong yet he reproved
[48:04] kings
[48:04] for their sakes saying touch not mine
[48:08] anointed
[48:09] and do my prophets no harm
[48:12] how did they have that kind of
[48:14] protection a small number of people
[48:17] holding the promise and possessing it
[48:18] going forward
[48:20] how do they have their protection
[48:21] because there's a protection that goes
[48:23] with the promise in the covenant
[48:25] god's going to watch over it to see it
[48:28] gets done
[48:30] and every time there was an interruption
[48:32] or it appeared like an interruption
[48:35] to it wasn't going to happen
[48:38] then the strength of the covenant and
[48:41] god
[48:41] stepped in to say no no it's still going
[48:45] to happen
[48:47] when abraham went with hagar
[48:50] with abraham backslid and went down into
[48:54] gorier says there's a famine in the land
[48:57] and so
[48:58] he started to get hungry and started to
[49:00] realize well he should have just stayed
[49:01] there in his land but he said
[49:02] and we that part of abraham
[49:06] we see in our lives is that we tend to
[49:09] get a little shaky sticking with the
[49:12] promise of god
[49:13] when we have troubles come our way
[49:15] there's a famine we get low financially
[49:17] whatever happens in our life we tend to
[49:19] be emotionally driven and there is the
[49:21] thing that says abraham went down
[49:22] into guerrilla we don't know all the
[49:24] reasons why but he left the land that
[49:26] god gave him
[49:27] went down into grier i like to say he
[49:29] went down to career maybe for a new
[49:31] career
[49:33] because it wasn't working out where he
[49:34] was or at least he thought it wasn't
[49:36] working out
[49:37] one place he went to the king fell in
[49:39] love with his wife
[49:40] he says i'm going to marry her because
[49:41] abraham said it's my sister he lied
[49:44] he's getting himself all messed up and
[49:46] god's promise and his covenant is laying
[49:47] right there the whole time
[49:49] and abraham it looks like he's going to
[49:50] mess the whole thing up sounds like some
[49:52] of you sometimes
[49:56] but i'm here to preach to you the
[49:57] covenant over your life is stronger
[49:59] than your mistakes i said the covenant
[50:03] is stronger than your mistakes
[50:04] or we would have messed this thing up a
[50:06] long time ago and there's that covenant
[50:08] just laying there and the promise he
[50:10] made him and abraham's going down there
[50:12] he's lying telling me you're my sister
[50:14] he's this king's getting ready to marry
[50:16] it and it gets to the very last moment
[50:18] that it's going to interrupt the whole
[50:19] plan of god
[50:20] because he's supposed to have a baby
[50:22] with sarah some other king is going to
[50:24] put his seed in her
[50:25] this is abraham has made this thing an
[50:27] entire mess
[50:28] but i'm telling you when it looks like
[50:30] it gets to his last moment the covenant
[50:32] and the power of it
[50:33] god steps in and says no no no no no no
[50:35] no
[50:36] i've swore by this by myself this is
[50:39] going to happen
[50:41] so he meets the king during the night
[50:43] and says boy
[50:44] you touch her and i'll kill you
[50:49] king says what in the world lord you
[50:52] never talked to me the first time you
[50:54] talked to me you're going to kill me
[50:57] i'm an innocent guy i know you're
[50:58] innocent i know you don't have anything
[51:00] it's actually my son that's messing up
[51:02] abraham
[51:04] i know you're innocent but if you go
[51:07] with that woman she's got a covenant
[51:09] over her life
[51:09] and i'm ready to jerk her out of this
[51:11] situation because she's not meant to be
[51:13] yours she's meant to have seed
[51:15] and have children with abraham and i've
[51:16] got a covenant in her life and i'm here
[51:18] to protect him
[51:19] so you can correct this by doing this
[51:20] this and this and and
[51:22] you know turn this wedding off and just
[51:24] do all you need to do
[51:25] i know you're an innocent man you've
[51:27] served god you've done it
[51:28] that's great but give that woman back to
[51:31] her
[51:32] husband he lied to you he's in trouble
[51:35] he lied
[51:36] what kind of a son of god is that what
[51:38] kind of a guy is that i've never lied in
[51:40] my life and this guy's lying and i was
[51:42] supposed to
[51:42] yeah he lied i'll deal with him he's my
[51:45] son
[51:48] send the woman send him and his wife
[51:49] away and when he goes
[51:52] before he leaves ask abraham to
[51:54] pronounce a blessing on your kingdom
[52:01] talk about not understanding things
[52:03] abimelech is going
[52:05] this is really weird i've never
[52:07] understood a god like this
[52:11] but i'm telling you friends the promise
[52:14] and the covenant over a believer's life
[52:17] doesn't change there is
[52:20] no situation there is no thing there is
[52:24] no mistake
[52:25] that interrupts the strength of this
[52:27] covenant
[52:30] you may be away from the lord today and
[52:32] distant you've ever been before
[52:35] maybe you've never been into a
[52:36] relationship but you might be away from
[52:38] the lord
[52:38] god dealt with you and now you're you're
[52:40] you're in a backslidden condition but
[52:42] you won't admit it
[52:43] but i'm telling you if god's calling is
[52:45] on your life you'll come hard or you'll
[52:47] come easy but god's going to arrange
[52:49] things that you're going to get the holy
[52:50] ghost and you're going to be established
[52:51] in his kingdom
[52:53] he's going to love you back why
[52:56] because the love in this covenant is
[52:58] greater than your
[53:00] feelings going up and down and you're in
[53:02] and out of church and you're in and out
[53:04] of things and you can't get established
[53:06] there's something greater thankfully
[53:07] there's something greater than your
[53:09] emotions
[53:10] there's something greater than the
[53:12] people that have hurt you
[53:14] there's something greater than the
[53:15] people who have damaged you
[53:17] there's something greater than family
[53:19] members who've done you wrong
[53:21] can i get an amen there's a calling on
[53:25] your life
[53:26] there's a covenant on your life and it
[53:28] trumps
[53:29] everything that's happened to you
[53:32] when god looks at it it's kind of like i
[53:34] remember gideon coming and saying
[53:36] not this gideon but the getting in the
[53:37] bible says lord you know i come from a
[53:39] poor family
[53:40] i'm not this i'm you're saying i'm not
[53:42] this that's not me and he just kind of
[53:44] bows out and says the lord says
[53:46] no it's you he wouldn't listen to his
[53:49] complaints
[53:50] what he'd been through what family he
[53:52] come from you don't know how my parents
[53:54] raised me
[53:57] lord you don't know what my parents did
[54:00] to me
[54:01] yeah he does yes he does
[54:06] and none of those excuses were good
[54:08] enough when there's a covenant over
[54:09] somebody's life
[54:10] and i guarantee you they're not going to
[54:12] be good enough at judgment day
[54:14] you're going to give a little puny
[54:16] answer on judgment day to the lord that
[54:19] this happened and this happened this is
[54:20] why i didn't serve the lord really
[54:23] no i think it's going to be all together
[54:25] different
[54:26] where you're going to realize the
[54:27] magnitude and you're going to see
[54:29] is that god's calling on your life and
[54:31] what he did to you through calvary
[54:33] stands alone by itself and all the other
[54:36] stuff on this side
[54:38] can never be used as an excuse for not
[54:40] embracing this
[54:41] it's a separate issue that's your first
[54:45] birth that's your firstborn life that's
[54:47] the trouble that came with your first
[54:48] birth but in your second birth
[54:50] there is no trouble there is no falls to
[54:54] it
[54:55] there is no failures john even said he
[54:58] that's born of god
[55:00] does not commit sin
[55:03] wow now can you still make a mistake in
[55:06] the flesh yes
[55:07] but that birth is secured it's sealed
[55:10] into the day of redemption
[55:13] it's sealed it's it's it's firm
[55:16] it's there's no failure to it
[55:20] praise the lord well i might end up
[55:23] shouting this morning and
[55:24] maybe doing it alone but praise the lord
[55:27] the covenant is sure
[55:29] the promises of god are yea and amen
[55:36] he says here be mindful of the covenant
[55:39] because god remembers his covenant we
[55:41] need to be mindful of his covenant don't
[55:43] forget his covenant
[55:45] the word he sends is tied to the
[55:47] covenant
[55:48] both things the covenant in his word
[55:50] because he said the word to these
[55:51] generations that's my covenant with the
[55:53] people they're given by god
[55:55] he is the original i'm going to try to
[55:57] find a place to end here but he is the
[55:59] originator of it
[56:00] he's the orchestrator of it god is the
[56:03] enforcer of the covenant
[56:04] god is the protector of the covenant god
[56:07] is the completer of the covenant how
[56:09] many know the scripture
[56:10] he who has began a good work in you will
[56:12] be faithful to complete it
[56:15] he doesn't say i'll begin the work in
[56:17] you and you work hard to complete it
[56:19] no this covenant says i'll begin it i'll
[56:22] end it
[56:24] i'll i'll complete this work in you if
[56:26] you'll just yield to me
[56:28] if you'll just embrace my promises the
[56:30] promise will do the work
[56:32] you don't complete it he completes it
[56:34] he's the originator
[56:35] he's the enforcer he's the protector
[56:38] he's the completer
[56:39] he's the author he's the finisher in
[56:42] this journey
[56:43] it is crucial that remember that we
[56:45] remember
[56:46] this is the covenant that god swore by
[56:49] himself
[56:51] over your life can you say amen this is
[56:54] not a human thing at all in its
[56:56] origination
[56:57] if it had humanness in it then it would
[56:59] have flaws in it there's no humanness in
[57:01] this
[57:03] be mindful that there's no humanness it
[57:05] must be the things
[57:06] that will happen if we forget it
[57:09] sometimes we forget and we
[57:11] tend to humanize this relationship with
[57:14] god or we tend to
[57:15] humanize the the covenant god made what
[57:18] do you mean by that brother paul
[57:20] it's possible we humanize this and it's
[57:23] easy to humanize because
[57:24] it's the promise of the word made flesh
[57:26] in us so the word is becoming flesh in
[57:28] us
[57:29] so it's it's possible for people to
[57:32] humanize it
[57:35] so with humanity blending with deity
[57:39] it has the potential to stumble at times
[57:41] because the humanity is stumbling
[57:44] and that's why we're instructed to keep
[57:45] always in our heart remember the
[57:47] covenant remember the strength of the
[57:48] covenant
[57:49] the original plan was a covenant that
[57:51] god made
[57:52] and the strength of this covenant and
[57:55] promise lies with him
[57:57] the proving of it lies with him you ever
[58:00] had people say prove it
[58:02] prove it prove what you got prove that
[58:05] here's this person
[58:06] here's this person pray for them let me
[58:08] see if they get well all these people
[58:10] prove it
[58:10] listen we don't have to prove anything
[58:14] we have faith in his word and god will
[58:16] prove his word
[58:19] keep that mindset of how you look at
[58:21] this lest we look at it from a human
[58:23] standpoint
[58:24] now i wish i had another hour to preach
[58:26] because that's what we do is we tend to
[58:28] start looking at the church
[58:29] the message one another from a human
[58:32] standpoint
[58:33] instead of the covenant that's over the
[58:35] people of god
[58:36] you tend to come to church looking at
[58:38] the humanness of people
[58:39] even my humanness as a preacher you're
[58:42] looking for the flaws or you're looking
[58:43] for the mistakes
[58:44] you look into the lack of things that
[58:45] maybe you disagree with and things like
[58:47] that
[58:47] but you see don't let humanness cloud
[58:51] your vision
[58:52] of what's happening here the promises of
[58:55] god are being preached to the people
[58:57] and those who will take a hold of them
[58:59] will live in the strength of those
[59:01] promises
[59:02] that's what church is about if you
[59:05] humanize it
[59:06] how many knows that the people humanize
[59:07] the prophet how many know the people
[59:10] did deify the prophet either one is in
[59:13] balance can you say man
[59:15] you see god was blending with humanity
[59:17] just like he's blending with you
[59:18] the word becoming flesh that's what's
[59:21] happening in you
[59:22] so when it's blending with flesh and we
[59:24] only look at the flesh we say there's a
[59:26] problem with the covenant there's a
[59:27] problem with the promise
[59:28] because you're looking at the humanness
[59:30] you look at people within the church
[59:32] sometimes
[59:34] you look at people within our own church
[59:36] or whatever church you go to
[59:38] you look at the flesh and humanness
[59:40] you're gonna stumble
[59:43] you're gonna stumble sometimes you might
[59:45] look at me in decision to make you
[59:46] stumble sometimes
[59:47] i pray not but you're looking at the
[59:49] flesh
[59:51] you're looking at the human side i wish
[59:54] people would have grace for me
[59:56] like they have for themselves
[1:00:00] because they get a free pass for all the
[1:00:02] stuff they've done and stud and gossiped
[1:00:04] about
[1:00:05] and yet when i say one little thing out
[1:00:07] of place oh my goodness
[1:00:09] that's not a christian i wish i had
[1:00:11] grace for me like they have for
[1:00:12] themselves they get a free pass for
[1:00:14] everything listen
[1:00:15] we don't get a free pass for our
[1:00:17] humanness if we make a mistake we got to
[1:00:19] apologize for it but people get to
[1:00:23] looking at the human size and they
[1:00:24] humanize
[1:00:26] the promise the covenant the work of
[1:00:28] don't put humanness in it
[1:00:30] it's separate in the humanness now i'm
[1:00:32] not justifying a bunch of just sin going
[1:00:34] on in people
[1:00:36] i'm not justifying that i think if we
[1:00:39] make a mistake in sin we should repent
[1:00:40] quickly before god
[1:00:44] but the covenant the promise stands
[1:00:47] alone in its strength
[1:00:49] without you to keep it together
[1:00:53] the strength of the covenant does not
[1:00:56] finally lie
[1:00:57] with you it's with god
[1:01:02] and he says he'll protect you from the
[1:01:04] nations you go through he'll remove
[1:01:06] kings if he has to he'll move the world
[1:01:10] if he has to everything will move
[1:01:12] according to the word that's over your
[1:01:14] life
[1:01:15] everything that becomes a hindrance will
[1:01:17] be removed
[1:01:18] and god will fulfill his word in your
[1:01:22] lives
[1:01:24] we must approach this what it is it's a
[1:01:25] covenant that means it's stronger than
[1:01:27] our mistakes
[1:01:28] it's stronger than anything to stop it
[1:01:31] it will step in and rebuke anything that
[1:01:32] gets in the way
[1:01:33] there's way too many scriptures that we
[1:01:35] can read right now of human mistakes of
[1:01:37] people
[1:01:38] in the bible who were carrying this
[1:01:40] covenant and i tell you the people were
[1:01:42] not
[1:01:42] perfect but the covenant was
[1:01:46] let's give the lord a hand
[1:01:49] [Applause]
[1:01:51] the people many in the bible the people
[1:01:54] weren't perfect
[1:01:56] but the covenant was perfect
[1:01:59] it had no failure in it abraham oh we
[1:02:02] could talk
[1:02:03] his mistakes uh isaac jacob my you could
[1:02:06] go on and jacob here he is he's coming
[1:02:09] and here he is coming back to his
[1:02:11] brother
[1:02:12] and he had to come back to his land and
[1:02:15] he's scared of his brother and he's got
[1:02:17] fears and then he's got his own trouble
[1:02:20] within him
[1:02:21] he meets god face to face the night
[1:02:23] before he meets god face to face
[1:02:25] god changes him because he held on to
[1:02:27] the angel said god i cannot go
[1:02:29] another day without you changing me
[1:02:33] can you say man so he was a deceiver he
[1:02:36] did him he deceived his father-in-law he
[1:02:38] deceived
[1:02:38] he had this trouble in his life but yet
[1:02:41] yet there was a covenant over jacob's
[1:02:42] life
[1:02:43] that that carried with him no matter
[1:02:45] what he was doing and finally
[1:02:47] it came to a head god finally changed
[1:02:49] him and when god changed him
[1:02:51] then he could look at his brother
[1:02:53] correctly and had no fear of him
[1:02:55] when god changes you you look at people
[1:02:57] different
[1:03:00] when me when you are face to face with
[1:03:02] god
[1:03:04] then you can look at other people
[1:03:05] different and not humanize them so much
[1:03:08] but have more love for them the people
[1:03:11] you're afraid of the people that have
[1:03:13] done you wrong the people have to
[1:03:15] get a hold of god and get close to him
[1:03:17] you'll look at him different
[1:03:19] i can't forgive that person i can't they
[1:03:21] you don't know what they did brother
[1:03:22] paul
[1:03:23] if you get in the presence of god and
[1:03:25] see him face to face you see yourself
[1:03:27] different
[1:03:28] and when you see yourself different you
[1:03:30] look at other people different
[1:03:32] amen praise the lord these are the
[1:03:35] problems this is
[1:03:36] i could preach so much more but we'll
[1:03:38] bring this to an end the promises of god
[1:03:40] are yea and amen
[1:03:41] the promises of god don't have failure
[1:03:43] in them the promises of god are worth
[1:03:45] fighting for
[1:03:46] these are your promise these are your
[1:03:49] promises that god gave you
[1:03:53] to take a hold of to fight for can you
[1:03:55] say man and when they're fought for and
[1:03:57] when they're embraced and when you
[1:03:58] remove everything that's around then you
[1:04:01] realize that the strength of them
[1:04:03] will carry you and it's not you carrying
[1:04:06] yourself
[1:04:07] it's the strength of the covenant and
[1:04:08] the promise carrying you
[1:04:10] that's why we want to fight for these
[1:04:11] things when you see the value of
[1:04:14] living in the promises of god holding on
[1:04:17] to your hand
[1:04:18] guiding you through each situation then
[1:04:20] you hold to those promises with all your
[1:04:22] heart
[1:04:22] and it guides you it helps you there's a
[1:04:24] strength in it can you say amen
[1:04:27] oh yeah you'll want to remove anything
[1:04:30] between you and the promises
[1:04:33] when i get done with this you'll want to
[1:04:35] remove what's in between you and the
[1:04:37] promise are you with me today
[1:04:40] when i get done next sunday and
[1:04:41] hopefully you'll come out here
[1:04:43] brother andrew wednesday night and us
[1:04:45] next sunday
[1:04:46] when we talk about what you want to
[1:04:48] remove when you see how great it is on
[1:04:51] the other side
[1:04:51] you'll want to remove all these things
[1:04:54] between you and the covenant
[1:04:55] you'll want to do it yourself you want
[1:04:57] to remove them say that's not as
[1:04:58] important to me anymore that's not as a
[1:05:02] big a deal to me anymore
[1:05:05] the promise of god you see that's the
[1:05:06] problem is the promises of god are so
[1:05:08] cluttered down here in people's life
[1:05:10] and everything else up here is more
[1:05:11] important and i'd have to give this up
[1:05:13] i have to give that up but when the
[1:05:15] promises of god are lifted so much
[1:05:18] greater than all that
[1:05:19] then it's easy to give this up that's a
[1:05:22] walk with the lord right there
[1:05:25] he's promised to hold my hand he's
[1:05:26] promised to help me stand musicians can
[1:05:28] come

[1:05:30] preaching because i'm having a good time
[1:05:32] today
[1:05:34] you'll oh yeah you'll want to remove
[1:05:37] what is in between you and the promises
[1:05:39] when you realize
[1:05:40] how great it is to live in the promises
[1:05:42] of god
