[4:31] name no one
[4:38] name
[4:44] Jesus praise
[4:47] God Exodus 19 and verse three if you
[4:50] would here and Moses went up unto God
[4:54] the prophet of God went up unto God and
[4:56] the Lord called unto him out of the
[4:58] mountain saying thus shalt thou say to
[5:00] the house of Jacob and tell the children
[5:03] of Israel so now God is telling the
[5:05] prophet to go tell the people
[5:08] something and this is what he told the
[5:10] people you have seen God's saying you've
[5:12] seen what I did unto the Egyptians and
[5:14] how I bear You On Eagle's Wings and
[5:17] brought you unto myself now therefore if
[5:20] you will obey my voice indeed and keep
[5:23] my Covenant I just want you to stop and
[5:25] recognize now what God is saying he just
[5:27] gave his whole history with the the uh
[5:30] children of Israel he said what have I
[5:32] done he says I you've seen what I did to
[5:34] the Egyptians I took care of your enemy
[5:36] phase one and then and then I I bore You
[5:39] On Eagle's Wings now in this Wilderness
[5:41] journey I bore You On Eagle's Wings
[5:43] phase two and then he says I brought you
[5:46] unto myself which is a revelation of the
[5:49] mystery of why God did all that and that
[5:51] is to bring you to himself to bring you
[5:55] to himself aren't you glad that that's
[5:58] the purpose God's bringing you to
[6:00] himself he'll use miracles to do it
[6:03] he'll destroy your enemy in the Red Sea
[6:05] to do it he'll do whatever needs to be
[6:07] done but the purpose is to bring you to
[6:09] himself because he wants relationship
[6:11] with you now therefore if you will obey
[6:15] my voice if you follow my voice indeed
[6:18] and keep my Covenant then ye shall be a
[6:21] peculiar treasure unto me above all
[6:23] people for all the Earth is mine and ye
[6:26] shall be unto me a kingdom of priest
[6:30] plural a kingdom of priests a holy
[6:32] nation these are the words which Thou
[6:35] shalt speak unto the children of Israel
[6:36] and I believe that it's there's more in
[6:38] here that I'd like to preach on a little
[6:40] bit and that it it shows and unveils to
[6:43] me the final purpose of God through many
[6:46] of the mighty acts that God did you got
[6:48] to realize with the children of Israel
[6:50] he did some mighty acts some mighty
[6:52] things that he hadn't hadn't done for 4
[6:54] or 500 years and then God visits his
[6:57] people God sends a prophet and then God
[6:59] begins to display himself in such a
[7:03] powerful and a mighty way uh I don't
[7:05] think until this day God displayed him
[7:09] himself to that many people two million
[7:11] is what come out of Egypt and I don't
[7:14] think God displayed himself until today
[7:16] to in that way of Mighty acts like he
[7:18] did to the children of Israel it was
[7:20] awesome it was amazing the things that
[7:22] God did you couldn't deny that God had
[7:24] not come down and visited his people and
[7:26] he opened the Red Sea and he brought
[7:28] water out of the rock for them and he
[7:29] brought bread and he just did so many
[7:32] marvelous things and then he destroyed
[7:34] as he said the the Egyptians for them
[7:37] the enemy and so there was so many
[7:38] mighty things done but I believe these
[7:41] scriptures just a few scriptures we read
[7:43] right in the middle of all that there's
[7:45] a there's a revealing of God's purpose
[7:47] you see because when God does something
[7:50] Mighty or many things Mighty like that
[7:53] it's to grab our attention but whatever
[7:55] he's doing he has a a final purpose to
[7:59] it God is a god of
[8:03] purpose God doesn't do anything just to
[8:06] fill time God doesn't do anything just
[8:09] to just to show off God doesn't do
[8:12] anything just that you can continue to
[8:15] watch his mighty acts he always has a
[8:18] final purpose to it and and so this is
[8:22] what I believe these scriptures revealed
[8:24] that you're seeing the F there's always
[8:26] a final purpose and you're seeing the
[8:28] the purp purpose and and and let me just
[8:31] say it this way seeing God's purpose is
[8:34] very very very important and a matter of
[8:37] fact it's probably the most important
[8:39] out of your experience with God is
[8:42] seeing his purpose of why he's doing it
[8:45] as a matter of fact you could watch God
[8:46] your whole life and not catch his
[8:49] purpose and what a shame that would be
[8:51] because God has an achievement he has
[8:53] something he's trying to do even in the
[8:55] hour we live in he has an achievement
[8:57] something that he wants to accomplish
[8:59] something he wants to get done can you
[9:01] say Amen I've always aligned myself
[9:03] since 16 years old with God's
[9:05] achievement for this hour I said Lord
[9:07] whatever it is you're trying to achieve
[9:10] it's not about my career it's not about
[9:12] my achievement it's not about my vision
[9:14] my goals although you have goals I think
[9:16] it's good but you must align your
[9:19] achievements and your goals and your
[9:21] career and your college choice or
[9:23] whatever it is uh young person you
[9:25] should align your dreams and your goals
[9:27] and your achievements with with what
[9:29] God's achievement is for this hour young
[9:32] couple that you you've been married you
[9:34] got a young family you should pray and
[9:36] say God what can we do for the kingdom
[9:39] of God how can we align our careers and
[9:42] our jobs and our paycheck every week
[9:45] with God's purpose for this
[9:49] hour because there's nothing everything
[9:51] else is empty you know why would you
[9:53] want to put all your money into
[9:54] something and then you then it just
[9:55] doesn't mean anything someday the only
[9:57] meaning only one life to soon be passed
[10:00] only What's Done For Christ will last my
[10:03] mom here used to sing that song Only One
[10:06] Life till soon it will pass only What's
[10:09] Done For Christ is going to
[10:11] last only one chance to do his will so
[10:15] give to Jesus all your days it's the
[10:17] only life that pays when we recall we
[10:20] only have but one life how many raise
[10:23] your hand say we only have we only get
[10:25] one we only get in the on this Earth
[10:27] anyway now we know we have eternity but
[10:29] on this Earth we only have one chance
[10:32] boy I want to do it right don't you we
[10:34] only have one CH chance we better do it
[10:36] right and we better not wait to
[10:38] opportunities to come we better say Lord
[10:39] you're giving me this paycheck and maybe
[10:41] it's a big paycheck or maybe it's little
[10:43] doesn't matter doesn't matter are you
[10:46] saying Lord what can I do for the
[10:48] kingdom of God what can my family do for
[10:50] the kingdom of God if you don't have
[10:52] that then you're not catching God's
[10:53] purpose and so God has a purpose for
[10:55] everything he has a vision and seeing
[10:58] that vision is so important if we don't
[10:59] see it what happens when we don't see
[11:02] God's purpose if we don't see God's in
[11:05] purpose in what he's doing then we might
[11:07] get hung up on all the details in
[11:10] between we might get hung up on people
[11:13] get hung up on the details people get
[11:15] hung up on God people get hung up on
[11:17] God's law people get hung up on God's
[11:19] principles people get hung up on what
[11:22] God tells them to do oh why is God
[11:24] asking me to do that I don't understand
[11:26] and so they might get hung up on the
[11:27] details and why is it they lack seeing
[11:30] God's purpose in all of it because
[11:32] there's a purpose there's an in purpose
[11:34] there's a there's a reason why God says
[11:37] everything he says there's a there's a
[11:39] final end to it can you say amen and
[11:41] what would it be if you didn't
[11:42] understand the end can you say amen and
[11:45] you're trying to figure out why he's
[11:46] saying this now but you don't understand
[11:48] his purpose God has a purpose in it and
[11:52] so you're always praying saying God give
[11:54] me a vision show me a vision show me
[11:57] what your purpose is for this hour and
[12:00] show you show me what my purpose is
[12:02] because if we don't catch that then we
[12:04] might get snagged we might get hung up
[12:06] on the details and or people might get
[12:08] hung up on depending too much on
[12:10] watching Miracles the Bible speaks of
[12:12] sign Seekers the the the the uh the uh
[12:15] there was a certain group of people in
[12:16] the New Testament they were follow the
[12:18] signs they were saying Jews are somewhat
[12:20] that way they they seek signs we would
[12:23] become just sign Seekers of God if we're
[12:25] not catching his purpose the sign is not
[12:28] as final purpose and so we can't just be
[12:31] sign Seekers but we must be purpose
[12:35] Seekers saying Lord what's your purpose
[12:38] what happens when we don't get his
[12:39] purpose and we don't get the vision it's
[12:41] because we because we maybe don't want
[12:43] to see it or we're not crying for it God
[12:46] show me your purpose and why you sent
[12:48] this message show me your purpose and
[12:50] why you said this in this hour what's
[12:52] the final result of everything God I
[12:54] want to know what your purpose is if we
[12:55] don't we get hung up on the details and
[12:58] we become a sign seeker and by that we
[13:01] stop short uh like I was saying on
[13:03] Sunday about the farmer the husbandman
[13:06] who here he is he he has faith in the
[13:09] seed that's been planted in the ground
[13:12] that it says he has long be patient un
[13:15] the coming of the Lord he has long
[13:17] patience for it until he receed the
[13:19] former and latter rain why does he have
[13:21] patience because he's got a faith and a
[13:23] confidence in the seed that's been
[13:25] planted it's the right seed it's the
[13:27] good seed and The Good Seed has been
[13:30] planted not by him but by the son of
[13:33] man and when you have a confidence in
[13:36] what's been planted then God for a
[13:39] farmer he knows if that's good
[13:42] conditions and it's a good seed and
[13:44] there's going to be the right sunshine
[13:46] and the the right rain which by the way
[13:48] is all up to God you realize the farmer
[13:52] is completely dependent on God for his
[13:55] crop he may take his tracker track and
[13:59] tear up the you know and break up the
[14:01] follow ground and then they may have uh
[14:04] things today tractors to plant the seed
[14:06] and all that but you see it's got to be
[14:07] good seed but once it's planted in the
[14:09] ground that he stands back and he's he
[14:12] has to have faith in the seed and then
[14:14] he's completely dependent on the sun and
[14:16] the rain can you say amen and God
[14:18] provides that so when we know that God's
[14:21] in our life then we step back and say
[14:23] God I know this will be right if you're
[14:25] in it can you say amen and and and so
[14:28] the far he has faith in the seed but I
[14:30] want to I don't want to preach that
[14:31] sermon again but he has faith in the
[14:33] seed and who planted it and the vision a
[14:36] farmer can see if the if the conditions
[14:38] are right he has a vision of what's
[14:40] going to come out of that ground he sees
[14:42] a full crop coming up there's a purpose
[14:45] in planting the seed and because he sees
[14:49] that purpose it's easy for him to be
[14:51] patient and wait for God to do it amen
[14:54] he has patience he waits on the full
[14:55] purpose to be fulfilled so millions of
[14:57] people even Christians have struggles
[15:00] over history because they did not see
[15:02] the purpose of God millions of people
[15:05] even Christians throughout history 2,000
[15:08] years of church history even in the Old
[15:09] Testament there's been people that
[15:11] struggled there's been people that had
[15:13] that has fears they they they haggle
[15:16] over things they they they they struggle
[15:19] within themselves sometimes you can't
[15:20] see it outside but they struggle within
[15:22] themselves and many times is because
[15:24] they don't see the purpose of God they
[15:28] don't see and they get hung up on trying
[15:30] to understand him in their own mind we
[15:33] can't understand God in our own mind his
[15:37] thoughts are higher than our
[15:39] thoughts his life is higher than our
[15:41] life can you say Amen his purpose is
[15:44] greater than our purpose and people get
[15:46] up hung up trying to understand them in
[15:48] their own mind why is God asking me to
[15:50] do this why does God ask us to wear
[15:54] this why this is strange and it's
[15:58] because it's strange to them because
[16:00] they don't see the purpose the longrange
[16:02] result of God in his mind and what he's
[16:05] trying to accomplish correction of God
[16:08] correction from God is mostly resisted
[16:12] do you realize that God's correction is
[16:14] mostly resisted in people but it's
[16:17] because they don't understand the
[16:19] purpose in the
[16:25] correction I think Paul mentions it
[16:27] where he says our fathers in the flesh
[16:29] corrected us and spanked us and you know
[16:33] disciplined us for their own profit for
[16:36] their own benefit but he says our father
[16:38] chastens us as Sons not for his own
[16:41] benefit but it's for our benefit so
[16:43] God's chasing God's correction has a
[16:46] purpose it has an intent behind it
[16:48] aren't you glad can you say Amen but
[16:50] most people resist the correction of God
[16:52] because why they don't see the purpose
[16:54] of God behind it they just see they're
[16:55] being corrected they only see the moment
[16:57] you did wrong I'm correcting you for it
[16:59] but God has a much bigger purpose in
[17:01] correction when he comes and corrects
[17:02] you God has a vision God has a
[17:05] correction for your life and that
[17:06] correction is to bring something good
[17:09] you can't see your purpose without
[17:11] seeing God's
[17:13] purpose you can't understand why you're
[17:17] here on Earth unless you understand what
[17:19] God's purpose is it's linked together
[17:22] can you say Amen why would somebody want
[17:24] to say I'm going to figure out what my
[17:26] purpose is in life but I don't believe
[17:29] there's a
[17:30] God doesn't work that
[17:33] way matter of fact you're in trouble if
[17:35] you ignore God uh in a lot of ways
[17:38] you're going to be in trouble you can't
[17:40] go without God you can't go without his
[17:43] his Revelation and his his personal
[17:45] relationship with you you can't approach
[17:48] marriage or finances or life or
[17:54] death without
[17:56] God so when you're trying to find your
[17:59] purpose then you can't see your purpose
[18:02] without seeing God's actually God's
[18:05] ultimate purpose and achievement can
[18:08] never be separate from you personally
[18:10] now that's a strong statement but I can
[18:12] confidently make it is that God God's
[18:16] ultimate purpose and achievement that he
[18:17] wants to achieve can never be separate
[18:20] from you personally the elect of God
[18:23] because his achievement is related to
[18:26] you right his fin achievement is related
[18:29] to you you say God I don't I'm not a
[18:31] part of this you just go ahead and
[18:33] fulfill your final word no no no his
[18:35] final achievement is to express himself
[18:37] through his people so your purpose is
[18:40] interlined with his purpose this mystery
[18:44] is comes back to as Paul said Christ The
[18:47] Mystery of God revealed as Paul said
[18:49] Christ in you the hope of glory you
[18:51] can't separate God's purpose from it
[18:53] being related personally to you and I
[18:55] don't mean a group because you can't say
[18:57] well God's purpose is a Revival around
[18:59] the world God's purpose finally is God
[19:01] being revealed personally to you if no
[19:04] one else if the theologians don't
[19:06] understand it God doesn't care if the
[19:08] theologians don't understand it he
[19:10] doesn't care if systems don't understand
[19:11] it the final Revelation the final the
[19:14] new birth is the revelation of Jesus
[19:16] Christ personally to you so you can't
[19:20] say I'm going to find my purpose in life
[19:22] without finding God's purpose because
[19:23] you are God's purpose you are God's
[19:26] final achievement he went to Calvary for
[19:29] you so Trouble Comes when we don't find
[19:33] our
[19:34] purpose if you don't have it tonight say
[19:36] God this is my priority tonight God show
[19:38] me my purpose why I'm on Earth show me
[19:41] why I'm here Lord show me I'm a son and
[19:44] daughter of God and what not just what
[19:45] I'm supposed to do show me who I'm
[19:47] supposed to be then he'll show you what
[19:50] to do in the kingdom of God but but look
[19:53] at that if you could only find that
[19:55] place of your purpose how much trouble
[19:57] you'd save God in your yourself too if
[19:59] you just find your place what kind of
[20:01] trouble have you caused because you
[20:02] weren't in your position you weren't in
[20:04] your place what kind of trouble have you
[20:07] brought to God no I haven't brought any
[20:09] trouble I doubt it you probably brought
[20:10] quite a bit of trouble to God and you
[20:13] probably got try to quite a bit of
[20:14] trouble to your life and maybe your
[20:16] finances or whatever else because you
[20:19] don't know your you don't know your
[20:20] purpose
[20:22] yet I know uh a young man or a young
[20:25] woman sometimes can cause a lot of
[20:26] trouble because they don't know who they
[20:28] are yet they have an identity crisis so
[20:31] now they're trying to be a basketball
[20:33] star and then the next week they're
[20:34] trying to be this and they're trying to
[20:36] be that and parents can't figure it out
[20:37] because they have an identity crisis
[20:39] they haven't found out who they are in
[20:40] Christ yet the purpose of God is
[20:43] essential the purpose the mystery of God
[20:46] what is the mystery of my life what is
[20:48] the mystery of God I must personally
[20:50] find that or else I'll struggle even
[20:53] with the scriptures sometimes the
[20:55] purpose of God is revealed you see I can
[20:58] go down to Ephesians chapter 1 you know
[21:00] what I don't think I'll leave it out
[21:01] Ephesians chapter 1 just to confirm how
[21:05] important that God's purposes how many
[21:07] believe that God has a purpose let's not
[21:09] let that become common to to us God has
[21:12] his acts he has his miracles he has so
[21:15] many things that he has done and will do
[21:19] can you say Amen our faith applied to
[21:23] the word will heal cancer our faith
[21:26] applied to the word will open up the
[21:27] blind eyes I said that on Sunday but
[21:30] it's not just what God can do it's
[21:32] what's his purpose because performing
[21:34] Miracles is not his final
[21:37] purpose so it's important that we find
[21:40] the purpose of God and here in Ephesians
[21:42] 1 it speaks about it just so you know uh
[21:45] picking it up here in verse three
[21:47] blessed be the god of our father Lord
[21:48] Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all
[21:50] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[21:52] in Christ Heavenly places is the
[21:54] believer's position standing in Christ
[21:57] according as he has chosen Us in him
[21:59] when that night at the
[22:01] altar no he chose us in him before the
[22:04] foundation of the world that we should
[22:06] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[22:08] love having predestinated us unto the
[22:10] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[22:12] himself according to the good pleasure
[22:14] of our
[22:16] will of his will to the praise of the
[22:19] Glorious Grace wherein he hath made us
[22:21] accepted and the Beloved in whom we have
[22:23] Redemption through the blood the
[22:24] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[22:26] riches of his grace wherein Heath
[22:28] abounded toward us in all wisdom and
[22:30] Prudence having made known unto us the
[22:32] mystery the mystery of his will
[22:35] according to his good pleasure which he
[22:37] hath purposed in
[22:39] himself that in the dispensation of the
[22:42] fullness of times he might gather now
[22:45] we're in our day we're in the
[22:46] dispensation of the fullness of times
[22:48] that he might gather together in one all
[22:50] things in Christ both which are in
[22:53] heaven and which are on earth even in
[22:55] him in whom also we have obtained an
[22:58] inheritance being predestinated
[23:00] according to what according to the
[23:03] purpose of him who worketh all things
[23:07] after the counsel of our will of the
[23:10] government's will he's working
[23:13] everything Accord oh I like this type of
[23:14] counseling this type of counseling he's
[23:17] working his purpose according to and
[23:20] work of all things after the counsel of
[23:22] his own will what does his will say and
[23:25] he's going to work that and bring his
[23:28] purpose to pass and we're a part of that
[23:30] purpose by predestination how many you
[23:33] can raise your hands Thank God I'm a
[23:34] part of his purpose that we should be to
[23:36] the praise of his glory so I want to let
[23:38] you know this is priority when he's
[23:40] speaking to the Ephesians the purpose of
[23:42] God is priority for believers it's not
[23:44] just the miracles of god it's not just
[23:46] the signs of God it's it's not just
[23:49] heaven in the future but it's what God
[23:51] is showing you in a mystery for your
[23:53] lives right now can you say Amen so the
[23:57] purpose of God God in Exodus 19 is
[24:00] revealed to the Jews listen now I want
[24:01] you to catch these
[24:03] points the purpose of God in the
[24:05] scriptures that I read is revealed to
[24:07] the Jews before all the
[24:10] Commandments after all the Miracles had
[24:12] been done through the Wilderness and
[24:15] before the laws came right in the middle
[24:17] God gives a few uh a few things he says
[24:21] to the Jews through the prophet that is
[24:24] his purpose revealed and it's a simple
[24:28] hidden purpose of all the Miracles
[24:31] purpose of the law coming is to bring
[24:33] you to myself I'm going to bring these
[24:35] things up because it's revealed right
[24:37] here it's to bring you to myself that's
[24:39] Oneness God says I want to bring you to
[24:42] myself think about all the Commandments
[24:44] and I'm going to talk about how many
[24:45] they are here in just a minute if you
[24:47] don't know think about all the Miracles
[24:49] he did before this before Exodus 19
[24:51] think about all the Commandments coming
[24:53] down the road in the next few TW the
[24:55] next 20 chapters is Commandments
[24:58] so you got all these Miracles and you
[25:00] got all these Commandments and right in
[25:01] between just four verses God says to the
[25:05] people but but here here's what it is I
[25:07] did these things and I will do these
[25:09] things that I could bring you to
[25:13] myself that I could be one with you and
[25:17] we know he couldn't fully fulfill that
[25:19] until Jesus went to Calvary you realize
[25:21] that but when he went to Calvary and
[25:23] took care of our sin we could truly
[25:25] become one with Christ and so the the
[25:28] mystery is that it's Christ in you the
[25:30] hope of glory it's Oneness it's you and
[25:32] Christ becoming one and you may see the
[25:34] Miracles you may see the you may believe
[25:36] and love all the law of God and the word
[25:38] of God and study the word of God but
[25:40] what's it all for what's the purpose
[25:41] that I could bring you unto myself and
[25:44] Oneness that you could follow my Bo
[25:46] voice and Obey it all along the way and
[25:49] if you do that I will fulfill my purpose
[25:52] in you and he mentions this last thing
[25:54] that ye shall be unto me a kingdom of
[25:58] priest I know I won't get to all of this
[26:00] tonight but this opens up a whole
[26:02] another Revelation I want you to be a
[26:06] kingdom of
[26:08] priests you say well well what's that
[26:10] mean it means a
[26:12] lot because remember God God didn't say
[26:15] here my purpose is I want you all to
[26:17] keep watching me do
[26:21] Miracles my purpose here is that I'm
[26:23] getting ready to bring you about 20
[26:25] chapters of laws and I need you to just
[26:27] obey all my laws that's not the full
[26:32] purpose my purpose here is to build a
[26:35] kingdom of priests and that means a
[26:37] couple of things that means that I will
[26:40] bring you into relationship with me a
[26:43] priest has access to God complete access
[26:46] to the inner Chambers and secret of God
[26:50] the priests are the ones the only ones
[26:51] that the high priest only one had
[26:52] clearance into the inner
[26:55] chamber they had it and he he's saying I
[26:58] want everybody to have clearance I want
[27:00] a whole Kingdom of ones that have
[27:02] clearance they don't have to go through
[27:04] anybody they have clearance they they
[27:07] can go in the inner Veil
[27:09] themselves they can see my secrets I'll
[27:11] tell them my secrets I'll whisper my
[27:14] secrets to them and then they will come
[27:16] in and go out because that's what the
[27:17] priest did and the second part of her
[27:19] priesthood is what's so wonderful they
[27:21] have access to God they can come in the
[27:23] in Veil but the main part of a priest is
[27:25] he's a mediator between God and humans a
[27:28] priest is a mediator between God and
[27:31] humans and they will go between and
[27:33] they'll go catch the mystery of God and
[27:36] then they'll come back and they'll be
[27:37] able to bring God to the people can you
[27:40] say Amen they'll they'll be able to pray
[27:43] for people and it won't just be the
[27:45] preachers praying for people it won't be
[27:46] the big evangelist everyone will be a
[27:49] priest unto God and have access to God
[27:51] and when they lay hands on the sick
[27:53] they'll recover somebody say praise the
[27:55] Lord you don't have to wait for the
[27:57] Pastor to pray for you you don't have to
[27:59] wait for the Evangelist for the next
[28:01] convention you don't have to wait you
