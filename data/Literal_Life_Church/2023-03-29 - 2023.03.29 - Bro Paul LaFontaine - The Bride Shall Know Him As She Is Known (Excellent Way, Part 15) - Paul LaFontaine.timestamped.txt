[0:00] First Corinthians 13 12-13 for now we
[0:03] see through a glass Darkly but then face
[0:05] to face now I know in part but then
[0:08] shall I know even as also I am known and
[0:11] now abide the faith hope charity these
[0:14] three but the greatest of these is
[0:17] Charity amen you may be seated tonight
[0:20] father bless the word as we administer
[0:22] to it Lord and just give to the people
[0:24] we pray that you'll bless each one and
[0:26] father we give our gift to you that
[0:28] could be a blessing to the people commit
[0:30] the service to you in Jesus name amen
[0:33] so tonight we're going to finish up what
[0:36] we were talking about Sunday and also
[0:37] finish up about 14 15 part Series in the
[0:41] excellent way in First Corinthians 13
[0:43] and we're happy tonight to make the
[0:45] conclusion to that and tonight we want
[0:46] to talk on these last couple scriptures
[0:48] talked a little bit about it on Sunday
[0:51] but we want to finish in the word of God
[0:53] the theme at the end of first
[0:55] Corinthians 13 that Paul's bringing so
[0:57] tonight I want to title this the bride
[0:59] shall know him as she is known the bride
[1:02] shall know when I say shall know it's
[1:04] because there is a prophecy and it'll be
[1:07] this time that the bride shall know
[1:08] Christ the bride shall know him as she
[1:12] is known and so uh we'll just talk a
[1:15] little bit tonight and teach on the more
[1:17] practical side of it and bring out some
[1:19] things and then towards the end of the
[1:21] service we'll go into this prophecy of
[1:23] Paul saying that at that day he's saying
[1:27] now for we see through a glass in the
[1:29] first church age we see through a glass
[1:31] we see Christ through a glass but then
[1:33] face to face and so we know that that's
[1:36] a prophecy also he mentions it in verse
[1:39] 10 if you're looking when that which is
[1:42] perfect has come then that which is in
[1:44] part shall be done away so that is a
[1:47] prophecy there'll be a coming day when
[1:49] that which is perfect will come and that
[1:52] that which is in part shall be done away
[1:54] I personally believe that there's enough
[1:56] Vindication to show that we're in that
[1:58] day when that which is perfect has come
[2:00] and I'm going to read something here in
[2:02] a moment from the prophet that's going
[2:03] to show that but before we get to that
[2:05] we just want to Echo what we said on
[2:08] Sunday about this knowing him face to
[2:10] face and the bride coming to know him in
[2:12] a face-to-face relay relationship and
[2:14] I'll just say it this way that if our
[2:16] vision of Christ is limited if we have a
[2:18] limited which Paul describes here as a
[2:21] dark glass or seeing through a glass
[2:23] Darkly seeing through a window that's
[2:26] faded or a window that doesn't give the
[2:28] full picture Christ is on the other side
[2:30] and it's not clear through the window
[2:32] because it's it's through a glass Darkly
[2:34] and that's the simplest way to explain
[2:36] that's how they looked through this
[2:39] glass Darkly to see Christ and when we
[2:41] look at them that way it's it's a
[2:43] wonderful thing but he says there'll
[2:44] become a day when we'll have a
[2:46] face-to-face relationship with Christ
[2:48] not through a glass Darkly can you say
[2:50] amen and so if our but here's the point
[2:53] if the if our vision of Christ is
[2:55] limited if we see through a glass Darkly
[2:58] then other things are limited and we
[3:01] have a partial revelation of Christ
[3:03] throughout the ages they had a partial
[3:05] Revelation and the the wonderful thing
[3:07] about the Believers in God who will have
[3:09] the Holy Ghost in every age they
[3:12] connected with what Christ was doing in
[3:14] that hour his word for that hour and
[3:16] when they connected with that they lived
[3:19] it they believed it with all their heart
[3:20] that even though it was a partial
[3:22] revelation of Christ they gave their all
[3:25] to it some of them gave their lives to
[3:26] it do you know that those Believers that
[3:29] were beheaded and given their lives for
[3:31] the gospel of Christ they did all that
[3:33] and sacrificed their life knowing very
[3:36] little of the of the character of Christ
[3:38] knowing very little of what we enjoy
[3:40] today of what Christ and yet they gave
[3:42] their lives for I'd say that if we know
[3:45] that this much of Christ in this hour
[3:47] and we're blessed with so much word
[3:49] revealed to us then we ought to give our
[3:51] all to it you got brothers and sisters
[3:53] you're going to shake hands with when
[3:55] you get on the other side and I'll tell
[3:56] you I'm going to feel humbled to be in
[3:58] front of them because they gave their
[4:00] lives and they only had a partial
[4:01] revelation of Christ they didn't know
[4:04] them like we're blessed to know him
[4:05] today but they gave their lives for they
[4:07] gave their all to it we should give our
[4:09] all to it can you say Amen a partial
[4:12] Revelation uh will tend to make our love
[4:15] partial as well as what we said Sunday a
[4:17] partial revelation will make our love
[4:19] partial and uh I want you to I want just
[4:22] to bring back some scriptures again
[4:24] related to the subject that partiality
[4:27] in the body of Christ shouldn't be there
[4:29] looking at one another and showing
[4:31] partiality with one another shouldn't be
[4:33] happening it happens in the world it
[4:35] happens in schools it happens in
[4:37] business can you say man their people
[4:40] are partial to different ones and
[4:42] they're they're partisan and all these
[4:44] other things but within the Holy Ghost
[4:46] kingdom of God the partiality should go
[4:49] away and we should look at one another
[4:51] through the eyes of Christ and we
[4:54] shouldn't just have favorites can you
[4:56] say amen and look down on other ones and
[4:58] try to judge each other but when we're
[5:00] looking through this glass and see
[5:01] Christ then he sees us without
[5:03] partiality so we should see one another
[5:06] that way so we have when we have a
[5:08] limited view in the face of Christ that
[5:10] we have a limited view then we're going
[5:12] to be limited in how this love comes out
[5:14] from us to others and that's the uh
[5:17] point that I was going to bring Sunday
[5:19] and so as Believers we cannot be partial
[5:22] in judgment or in our treatment of
[5:24] others we can't be partial in our
[5:26] treatment with others if you haven't
[5:28] learned anything from this uh excellent
[5:30] Way series you I would say if you learn
[5:33] it you you should learn this that we are
[5:36] to react to everyone in the love of
[5:39] Christ the same way
[5:43] and and the treatment of other people
[5:45] they deserve to be treated with the love
[5:48] of Christ and given the love of Christ
[5:50] and I'm not talking about compromising
[5:52] because you have to tell the truth love
[5:53] is rooted in truth but but when we're
[5:55] treating people wrong uh because we
[5:57] think they're less that doesn't belong
[5:59] in the body of Christ we should treat
[6:00] one you know hey everybody wants to be
[6:02] treated right
[6:03] how many rage yet I like to be treated
[6:05] right I'd like to be treated with
[6:07] respect and uh you know nobody likes to
[6:10] be abused whether it's mental or verbal
[6:13] or physical abuse uh sexual abuse that's
[6:16] a disrespect to the human being and so
[6:18] none of us like to be disrespected
[6:20] whether it's an attitude coming we like
[6:22] to be treated right and if there ever is
[6:24] a place that you see the treatment of
[6:26] one another with high respect and love
[6:29] and you may disagree but the the respect
[6:31] and the treatment of one another and and
[6:34] feelings and love for one another it
[6:36] should be resident Among Us and when
[6:38] it's not I would just say this safely
[6:40] when it's not happening somebody is not
[6:43] looking into the face of Christ
[6:44] correctly
[6:46] there's a there's a story that I
[6:48] remember a quick little story about
[6:49] Leonardo da Vinci
[6:51] uh DaVinci as he's painting the face of
[6:54] Christ and I've mentioned this before
[6:56] but there's a story that when he was
[6:59] painting the face of Christ on the the
[7:01] painting he was doing of the last supper
[7:03] and he was there and he was intently
[7:05] just working on the face of Christ
[7:08] and Leonardo he got angry at one of his
[7:11] servants and he lashed out at him he
[7:13] just lashed out he got outset they had
[7:15] done something wrong and so he pulled
[7:17] away from painting the face of Christ
[7:18] and he just got romantic lashed out at
[7:20] him
[7:21] and then he went back to and he and he
[7:24] he says he could not he was stumbling
[7:27] and and struggling to go back to
[7:30] painting the face of Christ he had
[7:32] trouble with it and he tried and he
[7:34] couldn't do it he tried he couldn't do
[7:36] it and there was too much evils just
[7:38] stirring within him and his anger and he
[7:40] had a lack of peace and that lack of
[7:42] peace made him throw down his brushes
[7:45] go and find that servant that boy and
[7:48] ask forgiveness from him
[7:50] just effective he could not paint the
[7:52] fate of face of Christ and have that
[7:55] feeling within him
[7:56] now that's just a natural thing it's
[7:59] just a natural story but I think it says
[8:00] something to us
[8:02] of what I'm trying to minister on
[8:04] that there's something about when we're
[8:07] when we're looking into him
[8:09] and looking at him through the word of
[8:12] God and we're keeping focused on him
[8:14] makes it very difficult to hate one
[8:17] another
[8:19] why because we're being changed into
[8:21] looking at the way Christ sees it
[8:24] so we can kind of tell in our lives when
[8:26] we're not in the face of Christ enough
[8:28] we've become affected so by so many
[8:30] other carnal things but when we're
[8:32] looking at them so he I just finished in
[8:34] the story he wouldn't ask forgiveness
[8:35] and and then only through asking
[8:37] forgiveness and prayer did Leonardo did
[8:41] he did he have an inner calm and settle
[8:44] down enough to go back to painting the
[8:46] face of Christ he settled down because
[8:49] he asked forgiveness hello he asked
[8:51] forgiveness and he he went to prayer and
[8:55] that's the type of things that relieves
[8:57] anger that's the type of things that
[8:58] relieves and so he did that and then he
[9:00] could calm down in order in order to go
[9:02] back and paint the face of Christ I
[9:04] think it says something to us and so uh
[9:06] you know I mentioned a couple scriptures
[9:07] I want to bring him up again tonight if
[9:09] they want to bring him first Timothy 5
[9:11] 19 says against it in this whole
[9:13] partiality thing and showing us it's not
[9:16] it doesn't belong Among Us within the
[9:18] church church people and Believers First
[9:21] Timothy 5 19 against an elder receive
[9:23] not an accusation Nation but before two
[9:26] or three Witnesses so it's very
[9:28] important that Among Us that we be
[9:31] careful when an accusation comes against
[9:34] an elder and for that matter for anybody
[9:35] that's a member of the body of Christ
[9:37] it's very important we don't just accept
[9:39] that and take it as truth
[9:41] and and so now notice the subject of
[9:44] partiality notice the subject of of
[9:47] waiting to see the whole picture of
[9:49] things not judging on partiality not
[9:52] judging on seeing it oh somebody made an
[9:54] accusation somebody gossip somebody put
[9:57] an elder down somebody put a pastor down
[9:59] somebody put an elder in the church down
[10:00] we are we are taught in the scripture we
[10:03] are not to receive that just like that
[10:05] but out of the mouth of two or three
[10:06] Witnesses or in other words we're
[10:08] waiting to see if it's the truth before
[10:10] we believe it
[10:11] that's maturity in the body of Christ
[10:13] you don't just accept gossip you know
[10:15] just to take it as the final Authority
[10:17] because that's being partial in your
[10:19] judgment
[10:21] and we're not supposed to be partial in
[10:23] our judgment we're not supposed to take
[10:25] half truths about somebody none of us
[10:28] like that about us being said about us
[10:29] so in maturity we're not taking half
[10:32] truths about what we hear but before two
[10:34] or three Witnesses it goes deeper when
[10:36] it says in verse 20 them that sin rebuke
[10:39] before all that others also May fear now
[10:42] that's a strong scripture and I've never
[10:44] heard too many uh pastors talk about it
[10:47] nevertheless it is in the scripture that
[10:49] Among Us them that sin rebuke before All
[10:52] That Others May fear I can't help but
[10:55] think it's in this same subject of
[10:56] partiality it's in the same subject
[10:59] we'll be real harsh on somebody here and
[11:01] somebody over here we won't be as harsh
[11:02] on and we have to be careful about
[11:05] partiality in our judgment
[11:07] here it says rebuke before all that
[11:09] others may feel or fear because all of
[11:12] us are under the same Holy Spirit and
[11:14] and the word is the same and so in that
[11:16] theme then he says verse 21 I charged
[11:19] thee before God and for the Lord Jesus
[11:21] and and the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[11:23] elect Angels this is pretty serious that
[11:25] thou observe these things without
[11:28] preferring one before another doing
[11:32] nothing by partiality
[11:35] doesn't belong Among Us
[11:37] how many would just say that's that's
[11:38] good that's a good lesson for me
[11:40] that's the way it's supposed to function
[11:42] that you I say this before the elect
[11:45] angels and for the Lord Jesus Christ
[11:47] observe these things without preferring
[11:49] one before another without partiality
[11:52] and then it's echoed in again in James 2
[11:54] verse 2 if you want to bring it up James
[11:56] 2 and verse 2 said my brethren have not
[11:58] the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ the
[12:00] lord of Glory with respect to persons
[12:02] for if there come unto your assembly a
[12:04] man with the gold ring in Goat goodly
[12:06] apparel and there come also a poor man
[12:09] in Vile Remnant he remit so in our day
[12:12] you know one comes in he's got all the
[12:13] rich clothes clothes on he he buys the
[12:16] very best he's got the very best of
[12:19] jewelry or she does and they're dressed
[12:21] for great maybe they're got a position
[12:23] in the in the in the county or in this
[12:26] or they're a mayor or something like
[12:28] that they're dressed good they drive
[12:29] drove the Mercedes in and then you got
[12:32] another guy gets out of his truck in
[12:34] overalls and he comes in and he stinks
[12:37] and he doesn't look that great and so
[12:40] our own human nature of this world is to
[12:43] judge them based upon those things we
[12:46] shouldn't do that
[12:48] and ye have respect to him that weareth
[12:50] the gay clothing come on in and say unto
[12:53] him sit down here in a good place and
[12:55] give them the best place at the potluck
[12:57] and sit up close to the food and be the
[12:59] first in line and say to the poor stand
[13:02] back over here and sit here under my
[13:04] footstool
[13:06] are ye not then partial
[13:11] are you not not then partial in
[13:13] yourselves and are become judges of evil
[13:15] thoughts so it's it's related to now
[13:19] if we do not I'm getting back to seeing
[13:22] the face of Christ when we're looking at
[13:23] him then we see him the right way and
[13:27] his love flows through and the
[13:28] partiality is gone because why if we if
[13:32] we see him part impartial then we'll
[13:34] look at one another partially as I said
[13:37] Sunday he doesn't look up at us with a
[13:39] partial revelation
[13:41] aren't you glad
[13:43] he knows us fully and not only does he
[13:46] knows know our weakness and what we were
[13:48] born in our first birth actually he
[13:51] knows us in our new birth and he knows
[13:53] us there's some we're a Son of God from
[13:54] the foundation of the world
[13:56] does God see you does God know you God
[13:59] knows you God knows who you really are
[14:01] God knew who you really were before you
[14:04] knew who you really were
[14:07] and and so now that's why he can love
[14:10] you with a predestinated elective love
[14:12] because he knows he really knows who you
[14:15] really are and take people a lifetime to
[14:18] figure out who they are sometimes and
[14:20] they their identity crisis and trying to
[14:22] be everybody else young people do that
[14:24] when they're young they're trying to be
[14:25] everybody else and we're always preached
[14:28] to them find your identity in the word
[14:29] of God and actually by looking into the
[14:31] face of Christ in his word you find who
[14:33] you really are
[14:34] because it's a revealing it's a knowing
[14:37] this Christianity this this message is
[14:40] an identity that we get to know how God
[14:43] made us what he made us for why he sent
[14:46] us what he sent us here to do can you
[14:48] say this message is a revealing of our
[14:51] true identity and the true identity of
[14:53] Christ and who he really is it's a
[14:55] knowing relationship it's not putting
[14:58] something on the outside it's not
[14:59] changing who we are all the time it's
[15:01] not having complexes of who we are it's
[15:04] finding out solid I'm confident I know
[15:07] this is the way God made me I'm
[15:08] comfortable in my own skin and I'm going
[15:11] to give God glory in the way he made me
[15:13] because I am known of God I know God I
[15:16] am known of God He Knows My Name can you
[15:19] say amen he knows who I am and so I'm
[15:21] going to be who I am because I know who
[15:23] I am
[15:24] what an age of what an age of an
[15:26] identity crisis right down to the
[15:28] perversion of not even knowing whether
[15:31] you're a boy or girl anymore
[15:32] it's a it's a it's a Satan's attack on
[15:36] the identity even of a man and a woman
[15:38] what a perverted thing it's an identity
[15:41] crisis and yet in the word of God we are
[15:43] fearfully and wonderfully made who we
[15:46] are and individually we are known of God
[15:49] and when we know that we're known and he
[15:51] reveals to us who we are that he reveals
[15:54] to us who he is and we find our identity
[15:56] in him can you say Amen when God unveils
[15:59] who he is completely and we can look at
[16:02] him face to face
[16:03] then it brings this victory in Divine
[16:06] love flowing through you it brings this
[16:09] victory in Divine love looking into his
[16:12] face
[16:13] this face-to-face relationship this
[16:15] knowing him knowing us and US fully
[16:18] knowing him perfectly it brings us into
[16:21] this Victory Divine love that's why I
[16:23] conclude with this tonight that Paul is
[16:25] concluding the same way when we come in
[16:27] that day when that which is perfect has
[16:29] come we're looking perfectly into the
[16:31] face of Christ through his word it's a
[16:34] day of knowing it's a day of knowing who
[16:36] he is and it's a day of knowing Who We
[16:39] Are
[16:39] it's an unveiling it's a revealing it's
[16:42] it's not smearing on Christianity
[16:46] it's not living off the blessings of
[16:48] Christianity
[16:50] let me say this way it's not being just
[16:52] interested in Christ as The Giver it's
[16:55] being interested Christ himself the
[16:57] person and knowing that person how many
[17:00] want to know him tonight
[17:02] most people are happy with seeing what
[17:04] he does giving them a blessing his
[17:07] actions his miracles that he does
[17:09] observing from a distance but they don't
[17:11] want to give their heart and they don't
[17:12] want any relationship with him but when
[17:14] we're called to this this end time it's
[17:17] not any more about a partial
[17:19] relationship with him it's about knowing
[17:21] him intimately in a relationship that's
[17:24] why saying Falling In Love With Jesus
[17:26] that's why I'm saying I keep falling in
[17:28] love with him because this is not a
[17:30] religion this is a love relationship
[17:32] with Christ can you say Amen this is an
[17:35] everyday falling deeper in love with him
[17:37] I'm falling in love knowing as I get to
[17:40] know him more I fall in love with him
[17:41] more that's a true relationship in
[17:43] marriage too they start courtship and
[17:45] they start dating a courtship and so you
[17:47] know what it's about getting to know one
[17:48] another and so if you get to know one
[17:50] another and there's no love there's just
[17:52] like I'm backing off but you keep if you
[17:54] keep getting together and you know them
[17:55] more you keep falling in love with who
[17:58] they are and they're falling in love
[17:59] with you that's the way it is with
[18:01] Christ the more I get to know him the
[18:03] more I fall in love with him
[18:05] amen
[18:07] and so let me just say it this way how
[18:10] we're living day by day comes down to
[18:12] what we're looking at
[18:17] you can't separate it how we're living
[18:19] day by day in our house and in our lives
[18:21] comes back to what we're looking at most
[18:23] the time
[18:25] how you react to Life's troubles depends
[18:28] on this one thing what are you looking
[18:31] at
[18:32] what are you beholding what are you
[18:35] beholding in your life what are you
[18:36] looking at and if it's very little of
[18:39] this word in your life then you will not
[18:42] be able to react to life circumstances
[18:44] the right way but there's a power
[18:46] there's a power there's a transformation
[18:48] it just does it because God said in my
[18:51] in the gospel is power I'm not ashamed
[18:54] of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it's
[18:56] the power unto salvation it does
[18:58] something when we keep our eyes
[19:00] beholding the word of God we see him can
[19:02] you say amen and and you don't have to
[19:05] work up the power you don't have to work
[19:06] up the transformation he just says keep
[19:09] beholding me keep looking at me and all
[19:11] the power to live to react to give love
[19:14] to to have wisdom in every situation it
[19:18] comes out of looking into his face
[19:20] and we look at it and it's hard to come
[19:23] out of prayer and come out of looking at
[19:25] his face it's hard to have ill feelings
[19:28] towards somebody when you're in that
[19:30] atmosphere of looking at him just like
[19:31] Leonardo just like it was hard to stay
[19:35] ill in his in his heart
[19:38] come into in front of the face of Christ
[19:40] that was just a picture
[19:43] I'll tell you when we're we got we're
[19:44] always looking at this
[19:46] there's a power that changes us we look
[19:49] at life different
[19:52] how you react to troubles depends on
[19:54] what you're looking at your Victory as a
[19:56] Christian is what you're mostly looking
[19:57] at in your life
[19:59] if he is here and has appeared before us
[20:02] in this hour then we can see him clearly
[20:05] it brings the result of a constant
[20:07] change from glory to glory to glory we
[20:11] all with open face beholding as in a
[20:14] glass the glory of the Lord because the
[20:16] glory of God is in the word of God and
[20:18] I'm not just talking about just our
[20:19] Bible it's the word it's the word of
[20:22] power but it starts by reading your
[20:24] Bible it starts by getting into it it's
[20:26] staying in front of it it's saying in
[20:28] the message it's it's staying in the
[20:29] word of God it's not the technical
[20:31] Written Letter on here it's what we're
[20:33] looking at in his character and when we
[20:35] keep looking at and beholding it because
[20:37] James brings up that thing about someone
[20:40] who's not a doer of the word and just to
[20:42] hear is the one that looks in a glass
[20:44] quickly and walks away
[20:46] but somebody who looks in a mirror and
[20:49] stays there and keeps looking and keeps
[20:51] looking he starts to see the flaw and
[20:53] becomes a doer of the word and not a
[20:56] hearer only
[20:58] how many members how many remembers that
[20:59] scripture in James
[21:01] so we are in his appearing now where his
[21:05] we're looking for his coming but we're
[21:07] in his appearing now he has appeared he
[21:12] is revealing his glory that which is
[21:15] perfect has come we just need to keep
[21:17] looking at it and be holding it and
[21:19] gazing upon it and Americans and
[21:22] American believers stop stop being so
[21:26] distracted by so many things and
[21:29] beholding everything else if you behold
[21:32] the news every day
[21:33] you're going to be pretty weak and
[21:35] pretty scared
[21:37] if you're beholding social media most
[21:39] the time you're going to be insecure
[21:43] you're going to be scared you're going
[21:45] to be
[21:46] buying into all different things of the
[21:49] world wisdom of this world
[21:52] what do you beholding uh you know right
[21:54] to the worst perverted things and
[21:56] looking at women and men on there if
[21:58] you're beholding that you're not going
[22:00] to survive it unless you pull out and
[22:02] say God take that from my life you're
[22:05] going to be affected by it every day
[22:07] your mind everything your heart try to
[22:10] come to church after feeding on that
[22:12] stuff say why do I feel so disconnected
[22:14] why because you're looking at the wrong
[22:16] thing
[22:17] you got to be beholding Christ most of
[22:20] the time
[22:21] we have to look at our computers we have
[22:23] to look at work we have to do our work
[22:25] of course we do but what I'm talking
[22:26] about is what are we be holding most of
[22:28] the time and if it's hardly any time in
[22:30] the word or in the message we're not
[22:32] going to be looking into the face of
[22:33] Christ enough we're going to be scared
[22:35] we're going to be insecure we're going
[22:37] to be jumping into all kinds of ideas of
[22:39] what's pretty and what looks good and
[22:41] what what what's what's accepted in this
[22:43] world and how I need to be accepted and
[22:45] how I need to be successful and it's all
[22:48] in what we're looking at makes us who we
[22:51] are
[22:52] and if we're barely looking into the
[22:54] word of God we're barely looking at it
[22:56] and not beholding that all the time
[22:58] we're going to be suffering spiritually
[23:00] and that's just the truth and we're not
[23:02] going to be able to offer this and come
[23:04] into this Divine love the way that we
[23:05] should so what we're looking at is
[23:07] that's that's what it is all about it
[23:09] comes down to what we're looking at most
[23:11] the time comes down to what we're
[23:13] beholding all the time
[23:16] even if it's not a computer it's just
[23:18] looking at one another
[23:20] we're not supposed to just constantly
[23:21] look and
[23:23] judge each other and nitpick one another
[23:25] and no it's discouraging sometimes to
[23:29] just keep looking at that but if we're
[23:31] looking and beholding him
[23:32] then we look at one another and we see
[23:34] each other the right way
[23:36] Grace comes Mercy comes
[23:39] uh balance comes
[23:42] can you say Amen
[23:43] so that's just a practical way of
[23:45] looking at it in our lives that what
[23:47] we're beholding is is has a power upon
[23:51] us and incidentally the word has power
[23:53] on us but the worldly the worldly things
[23:56] we're beholding has a power that goes
[23:58] with it but that's not the power you
[23:59] want in your life
[24:00] that is not the power you want working
[24:02] in your life a sway comes in when when
[24:05] Paul was talking about
[24:07] I have certain Liberties to do and if I
[24:09] have those Liberties I wouldn't do it to
[24:11] offend someone else
[24:12] and he says all things are lawful for me
[24:15] but not all things are expedient I know
[24:17] things are beneficial so there was
[24:18] things that you could do as a Christian
[24:21] he said I can do them I have Liberty to
[24:23] do them but it's not expedient for me to
[24:25] do them so I make a decision in in
[24:28] maturity to do to do that but he said
[24:31] there's one thing I will not be brought
[24:33] under the power of any of those things
[24:36] that's the key
[24:38] so obviously with those things there's a
[24:41] power that goes with it and so I will
[24:43] not be brought under the power of
[24:45] anything except the power of Christ we
[24:47] come into the power and love of Christ
[24:49] when we're beholding him when we're
[24:50] looking at his word where we're looking
[24:52] into him if we have very little time in
[24:54] that then we may come under the power of
[24:56] the Fashions of this world we might come
[24:58] under the power of somebody's uh Gossip
[25:01] of us we might come under the
[25:03] discouragement that somebody has put us
[25:04] down or abused us or said something
[25:06] wrong and there's a power goes with it
[25:08] that binds you
[25:10] and Paul said I will not be brought
[25:12] under the power of any of these things
[25:15] but I want to be under the power of one
[25:18] thing beholding Christ the power of the
[25:20] Holy Ghost the power of His word the
[25:22] power of his love manifested in my life
[25:25] can I get an amen tonight there's only
[25:27] one power I want controlling and leading
[25:30] my life and and guiding my life and
[25:32] that's the power of His Holy Spirit and
[25:34] his love working in me I won't be under
[25:37] the power of anything but so easily we
[25:39] get under the power of something else we
[25:42] get depressed by something else there's
[25:44] a power that goes with it and so we want
[25:46] to be under that so I'm going to switch
[25:47] down talk about this prophecy and I've
[25:49] been mentioning it that that when we get
[25:51] to the end time that which is perfect is
[25:53] come that which is perfect is come so
[25:56] Paul ends this with a prophecy that the
[25:58] bride of Christ of the last days shall
[26:01] see him and Behold Him clearly crystal
[26:05] clear through the word being revealed
[26:08] and his appearing through the word being
[26:11] revealed to us she this bride will
[26:14] Behold Him in a clear way and not
[26:17] through a glass Darkly
[26:21] let me say this respectfully dreams
[26:24] prophecies healings
[26:27] it's through a glass Darkly
[26:30] but it may not be knowing him this is a
[26:33] knowing relationship
[26:35] this is a knowing him relationship
[26:37] so dreams sometimes dreams are of the
[26:40] Lord sometimes they're not and if people
[26:43] want to follow every dream that they
[26:45] have
[26:46] I wouldn't follow hardly any of my
[26:48] dreams
[26:50] people get caught up in that in this
[26:52] stream and district and they're trying
[26:53] to interpret it be careful
[26:55] be careful because unless you're someone
[26:58] who really has a gift there to interpret
[27:00] it uh you you could go way off track and
[27:03] guess what you're doing you're seeing
[27:05] through a glass Darkly
[27:08] you're holding on to something that's
[27:09] it's a it's a partial trying to see
[27:13] what's coming and trying to see what's
[27:15] in your life and you know the thing is
[27:16] about the mystery of his will and that's
[27:18] what the Bible calls the mystery of his
[27:19] will you know his will is a mystery
[27:21] there's only one way to find his will is
[27:23] to look in his word because his word is
[27:25] his will
[27:26] I'm trying to find his will so you're
[27:28] looking maybe I'll give you a get I'll
[27:29] get a dream or something like that and
[27:31] and God does speak to but if you're only
[27:34] depending on a dream it's it's seeing
[27:36] through a glass Darkly
[27:38] there's a more sure word of Prophecy
[27:40] there's a there's a there's a a way the
[27:42] Lord can speak to you and drop it in
[27:44] your heart this is the will of God
[27:47] young people say well what do I do what
[27:49] career do I have and I don't know I wish
[27:51] the Lord would tell me to just be an
[27:53] engineer and God may do that God can do
[27:55] that he can impress upon your heart what
[27:56] to do but if it's the details of what
[27:59] who do I marry and all these other
[28:01] things you know I say to people his will
[28:03] is in the word of God so get in the word
[28:06] stay in the word and out of that that's
[28:09] his will for this hour that's his
[28:11] achievement for this hour what does what
[28:13] is God's will that he wants to achieve
[28:16] for this hour right now
[28:19] what is God's will right now what am I
[28:21] to be doing as a Christian in this hour
[28:24] and you find that in the word and you
[28:26] position yourself there then out of that
[28:28] he'll lead your heart to what job you
[28:31] should be having so what person to marry
[28:35] see it all comes back to beholding his
[28:37] word stay in the word and you're going
[28:39] to be winging it if you're out of his
[28:40] word and you've got to make big
[28:42] decisions in life and you're not saying
[28:44] in this word you're going to be winging
[28:45] it you found the fly it's off the cuff
[28:48] and I think vaguely I don't really have
[28:50] sure about this but I'm standing at the
[28:52] altar marrying this girl but I don't
[28:54] have full faith of it you can't do that
[28:56] you got to know where you stand you got
[28:58] to know it's his will can you say Matt
[29:01] to walk as solid as we can walk and
[29:03] there's nothing more solid in this world
[29:05] than beholding the word of God
[29:07] constantly everything comes out of
[29:10] staying in this word and beholding it
[29:12] look at God what's next for me I'll tell
[29:14] you I am so excited about what's next
[29:16] for me God what do you have to speak
[29:17] next to me what's next for the
[29:19] congregation what's the next series
[29:20] what's the next thing you want to say to
[29:21] us I'm excited when I look every morning
[29:24] in the word of God and I read it I'm
[29:26] excited about it because over and over
[29:28] again there's just this little trigger
[29:30] in my heart and I see a little scripture
[29:32] said there it is right there that's what
[29:34] I've been wondering about and that
[29:35] answers it
[29:37] if I hadn't been reading or stayed in
[29:39] that I may not have got that answer
[29:43] praise the Lord
[29:45] so dreams and prophecies that's through
[29:47] glass Darkly but she the bride will come
[29:50] into knowing him as he knows her he
[29:52] reveals himself and he reveals who she
[29:55] is too why it's a day of knowing he he
[29:58] is revealing who you are and he's
[30:01] revealing who he is
[30:03] that's the hour
[30:05] at that day Jesus said you'll know I'm
[30:08] in the Father the father and me I and
[30:10] you and you and me you'll know what kind
[30:12] of Oneness is happening because I'm
[30:14] gonna I'm gonna appear to you and I'm
[30:17] gonna reveal this oh plan to you I'm
[30:19] going to break open all this to you I'm
[30:21] not going to be partial I'm not I'm not
[30:23] going to be uh uh uh seeing you're not
[30:27] going to see me through a glass Darkly
[30:29] anymore
[30:30] but you're going to look at to me in a
[30:32] relationship that's face to face and
[30:33] thus you're going to know me and I'm
[30:36] going to know you there's nothing here
[30:38] and it's a relationship can you say Amen
[30:41] praise the Lord he reveals himself and
[30:43] he reveals who she is too it's a knowing
[30:45] time it's knowing him
[30:47] why is it important to see it because we
[30:50] tend to sometimes look back into a
[30:52] partial vision of Christ and reach back
[30:54] to
[30:55] Luther's day or Wesley's day
[30:59] or Pentecostal day and we we if you
[31:02] don't think people do this they'll
[31:04] they'll default back to that that
[31:07] Revelation which is a partial revelation
[31:10] of Christ
[31:11] if you have a minister and he comes to
[31:13] the light of this hour but he hangs on
[31:15] to his tradition he was a Lutheran
[31:16] Pastor or he was a Wesleyan Pastor which
[31:19] is under sanctification it's the
[31:21] restoration of sanctification or he was
[31:23] a Luther the justification reveal
[31:26] and or he came out of Pentecost you will
[31:29] find that if they don't Purge themselves
[31:31] of a life of just partial Revelation
[31:34] they'll they'll default back to their
[31:37] because you know in in the word we have
[31:40] today we're waiting for this to come to
[31:42] perfection in the bride we're looking at
[31:44] a perfect word but we're waiting for it
[31:46] to come to Perfection and how he's going
[31:48] to interpret it and people like to
[31:49] interpret it this is the bride's Revival
[31:51] so when we get nervous trying to
[31:53] interpret what's next what's next what's
[31:55] coming What's tomorrow what's next week
[31:57] in that we have an anticipation which I
[31:59] love that I'm excited about it but don't
[32:01] try to interpret what God's going to do
[32:02] and what brothers do sometimes they're
[32:04] in their nervousness they reach back and
[32:06] say well that worked back in Pentecost
[32:08] so I'm going to bring that forward and
[32:10] try to make that work
[32:12] but you're reaching back into a partial
[32:14] revelation of Christ
[32:16] when we've seen through a glass of
[32:17] Pentecost seen through a glass Darkly we
[32:20] don't want to reach back we want to go
[32:22] forward
[32:23] we want to take all that restoration
[32:25] right Gideon we want to take all of that
[32:27] restoration of justification
[32:29] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[32:32] and we want to take all those truths
[32:33] that were there not the traditions
[32:38] amen when I when I put my hand to my ear
[32:42] it means you need to say Amen
[32:46] we want to take the traditions of those
[32:48] because every one of those eras have
[32:50] traditions
[32:51] no no we don't want the Traditions but
[32:53] the kernel of truth of those things will
[32:56] take it with us and go on with the word
[32:59] but oh most of the church world and many
[33:01] times in our own ranks there's such an
[33:04] influence coming from the past that
[33:06] influences to where you have a a starchy
[33:09] Church
[33:10] reading quotes with no moving of the
[33:12] spirit
[33:14] when I was a kid I went to some churches
[33:16] that were preaching the message it was
[33:17] like being in a Catholic Church
[33:21] and then my dad would come in and break
[33:22] the whole thing up and make everybody
[33:24] make everybody laugh and then bring the
[33:26] word in there and start a Revival in
[33:29] that place the spirit of God start to
[33:30] move
[33:31] that's I observed it as a kid wow
[33:34] there's no life here
[33:35] can you imagine
[33:37] but it's it if if you don't invite the
[33:40] Holy Spirit to do what he wants to do
[33:42] and move on you become traditional with
[33:44] whatever you have can I get an amen
[33:46] you'll become traditional with whatever
[33:47] you have you'll become denominational
[33:49] with whatever you have
[33:51] and then you go into some environments
[33:53] and I don't mean to be critical but it's
[33:54] just a display exactly what's going on
[33:56] in the Pentecostal Traditions the same
[33:59] thing and so we're not reaching for
[34:00] those Traditions we're actually coming
[34:01] out of the traditions and I have
[34:03] something that says brother brother
[34:05] Brown said it this way he said he said
[34:07] this the seventh trumpet to Israel is
[34:10] the same as the seventh seal to us
[34:12] bringing us out of Pentecostal and World
[34:14] Traditions to the genuine atonement to
[34:16] the world of of the word genuine
[34:18] atonement of the word so when he brings
[34:20] us out he doesn't bring us out of the
[34:21] truths of that we bring the truth but
[34:24] we're we definitely have to come out of
[34:26] the traditions
[34:28] of those ages
[34:29] in order to move on and so now here's
[34:31] the prophecy we're coming out of partial
[34:34] Revelation and seeing through a glass
[34:36] Darkly
[34:37] to be holding in this appearing of the
[34:40] Lord the fullness of his Perfection of
[34:42] his character and who he is the why is
[34:45] he doing this in the last stage because
[34:47] he's going to marry a bride he's
[34:48] marrying a bride
[34:50] it's full disclosure
[34:52] that's why we do a little pre uh marital
[34:54] uh talking with young people because
[34:56] there needs to be full disclosure there
[34:59] needs to you need to know that person
[35:00] sometimes the counselor can help to get
[35:02] them know them more everything's got to
[35:04] be out because you don't you want to
[35:05] have faith when you stand there I I want
[35:08] to marry this person I marry and I'm
[35:10] going to care for all of their heart
[35:11] everything that they are I fall in love
[35:13] with and I'll care for their life their
[35:14] heart for the rest of their life there's
[35:16] going to be a union we're moving towards
[35:18] a union the same with the bride of
[35:19] Christ it's not going to be a dating
[35:21] relationship it's not going to be
[35:22] staying in according with today is the
[35:24] age of marriage with Christ intimacy
[35:27] with Christ
[35:30] it's a relationship can you say man it's
[35:32] not and how much of the church world is
[35:35] a is a is is not even a bride but a
[35:38] woman who just keeps dating Christ and
[35:41] then breaks up with him
[35:43] come on
[35:45] do we have a world that has Partners all
[35:47] the time and breaking up and all these
[35:49] other things and I don't like to see
[35:50] that cycle on young people this
[35:52] boyfriend and they're in a relationship
[35:54] they're out of a relation to in they've
[35:55] got 10 of them before they that you know
[35:57] it's it's the way the world functions
[35:59] and it's the way the church World
[36:01] functions can you say man when they just
[36:03] want a dating temporal relationship with
[36:06] Christ this message is not that this is
[36:09] a union of a marriage so much he says
[36:12] invisible Union of the bride of Christ
[36:15] it's a union we go to the marriage
[36:17] supper the marriage is happening now
[36:20] the intimacy and the Oneness with Christ
[36:22] is happening now we're moving out of
[36:25] just a courtship relationship
[36:28] because when you have that then you have
[36:30] people that well I'll break up for a few
[36:33] months or a few years and then I'll come
[36:35] back no no no no this is not that
[36:38] or I just I I only want him for the
[36:41] gifts I only I like this boyfriend
[36:43] because he gives me a lot of nice gifts
[36:45] but I really don't want to marry him
[36:48] I like the jewelry he gives me I like
[36:50] the gifts he gives me uh hello
[36:53] I like when he blesses me
[36:56] I like when I see the signs of this
[36:59] boyfriend
[37:00] but I really don't want to be married to
[37:04] him
[37:04] and and know him that that like that
[37:09] praise the Lord we're in a knowing
[37:11] relationship with him
[37:12] we are known of him he is known of us
[37:14] this message has brought us into that
[37:16] relationship and it cannot be
[37:18] denominational it cannot be reaching
[37:20] back into a partial seeing through a
[37:23] glass Darkly even today it is not enough
[37:26] to watch what he does we must crave to
[37:29] know who he is can you say Amen
[37:33] we will look at what he has done instead
[37:35] of what he is
[37:38] it is not enough to watch what he does
[37:40] we must crave to know who he is I mean
[37:42] just raise your hand brother Paul pray
[37:44] for me pray for me that I have a craving
[37:47] a craving to not just be a spectator to
[37:50] what God does but to want to know who he
[37:52] is to Crave who is he
[37:55] and to come into relationship with him
[37:57] praise the Lord that's what even today
[37:59] is not just enough to watch what he does
[38:01] but we must crave who he is the children
[38:03] of Israel he complained God complained
[38:06] in in Psalms and then in Hebrews you
[38:09] find it I forgot to write the scripture
[38:11] down but he says there are people that
[38:12] know my works for 40 years for 40 years
[38:15] they watched my works but he says they
[38:17] have not known my ways that's what I
[38:19] preached on Sunday you get to know
[38:21] person when you know his ways they talk
[38:23] you hear their thoughts then you know a
[38:26] person but not just physically it's it's
[38:28] knowing his ways and God said for 40
[38:31] years I'm grieved and notice this now
[38:33] God is grieved he was grieved with an
[38:36] entire 40 Years of generation why was he
[38:38] grieved because they would only go so
[38:41] far as to know him according to his
[38:42] Works they wanted to watch what he did
[38:44] and they wanted him to do more and more
[38:46] and more but he says there are people
[38:48] who do not know my ways
[38:51] my nature they're not catching my nature
[38:54] my character
[38:57] and so they stay in their immaturity of
[38:58] complaining in the wilderness because
[39:00] there are people that have not known my
[39:02] ways only my Works he was grieved with
[39:04] that generation they only stayed at
[39:06] knowing his word his works not knowing
[39:09] him he was always grieved with that he
[39:11] still grieved with that today when you
[39:13] have a people that just are always just
[39:15] knowing and Spectators Spectators of of
[39:20] what he's doing all the time
[39:22] testifying of what he's doing
[39:25] praise the Lord thank God you testify
[39:26] but you can't stay at a level as just
[39:28] testifying and being a spectator to what
[39:30] he's doing
[39:31] it's a relationship
[39:34] it's not deity it's not a boyfriend it's
[39:36] not just a friendship it is a friend
[39:37] God's a friend that sits closer than a
[39:40] brother but you move to those stages and
[39:42] it's in you in Christ you don't stay in
[39:45] dating or courtship or a boyfriend or
[39:46] girlfriend or stay in friendship and
[39:49] that's what we teach and even in young
[39:50] people when when it comes to that this
[39:52] is a thing to really pray about but as
[39:55] you get to know one another it's growing
[39:56] towards something it's not in and out of
[39:58] things all the time it's growing towards
[40:00] it I feel the faith to do it it's in
[40:02] growing into it to a union and that's
[40:05] what we're coming into with Christ as I
[40:07] said Sunday it's not in a physical
[40:08] glance that we know a person this is
[40:12] true in courtship and in marriage you
[40:15] can see someone but you don't know them
[40:18] you can see a person
[40:20] and that's why the question is always
[40:23] come up years ago James Dobson brought
[40:26] it up is it is love that first sight
[40:29] really possible
[40:32] mom
[40:34] and and respectfully some would say yes
[40:38] of course and they got the scripture for
[40:40] it when Isaac singing Rebecca okay I'll
[40:41] go with that and then you maybe got to
[40:43] test me and say first team my dad had it
[40:45] first time she walked into the back of
[40:47] church I looked there said that's it
[40:48] that's the woman I'm going to marry well
[40:50] God dropped the Revelation his heart I'm
[40:51] not against that
[40:52] but let me say it love is commitment
[40:55] love is respect love is loving the
[40:57] person who they are so is love at first
[41:00] sight real love really doable at the
[41:04] moment you see them
[41:07] no you have to know them
[41:10] in order to love them
[41:13] with sacrificial love
[41:15] so that's why he moves into this growing
[41:17] thing and the whole courtship thing is
[41:19] getting to know one another and getting
[41:21] no to know the families
[41:24] because you marry into a family too
[41:28] amen
[41:30] and so all of that is getting to know
[41:32] the person and it's working towards
[41:34] something because because if it's just
[41:37] you know uh something that's loose like
[41:39] the world then it's just I'm involved in
[41:42] going in and out of these things it
[41:43] shouldn't be that way it should be taken
[41:45] more serious than that and you shouldn't
[41:47] be under pressure for it but you should
[41:48] be prayerful prayerful about it
[41:51] very prayerful to say I'm in this not
[41:55] just for physical well I seen her and
[41:57] she's pretty and that's it I want to
[41:59] marry her
[42:02] I've seen him and he's
[42:04] he's good looking
[42:06] and so that's it you know that's I'm
[42:08] going to marry him well that doesn't
[42:10] work for this and it doesn't work for
[42:12] Christ
[42:13] and you say Amen
[42:15] but
[42:16] Divine love and the depth of Love Comes
[42:20] as you know and that's the thing when
[42:22] Christ got come to know us and knows us
[42:24] the way he knows us then the love just
[42:26] keeps pouring out because he knows who
[42:28] we are this is the way it should be in
[42:30] falling in love with Christ
[42:32] how can you love a person until you know
[42:34] who they are and the world has perverted
[42:36] this and reversed all of this until
[42:38] someone is intimate and physical with
[42:41] somebody the first night
[42:43] because the world's perverted
[42:47] I don't even have to know that person
[42:48] they're just a body and you that feed on
[42:51] pornography I can tell you in your mind
[42:53] a woman even in the church a young girl
[42:55] in the church or young person is just an
[42:57] uh just a a an image to you it's just a
[43:00] body because you've been taught that
[43:03] didn't expect to say this but I'm going
[43:05] to say it
[43:06] I'm going to say it you feed on that you
[43:08] feed on the world you feed into those
[43:10] things you'll never look at our young
[43:11] girls properly
[43:14] they're an object to you
[43:16] but you really don't care about their
[43:18] personality or getting to know them it's
[43:21] just moving quickly and the hormones are
[43:23] Russian and it's all carnal it's all
[43:25] wrong and all that stuff is to be left
[43:27] for the intimacy that's in a marriage
[43:29] that comes last can you say Amen
[43:32] but when you get to know them and you
[43:34] grow in that I've fallen in love with
[43:35] this person when we interrupted and
[43:37] perverted to the other way you haven't
[43:39] fallen in love with a person you're not
[43:40] even it's not even true love it's just
[43:42] lust because you're just thinking about
[43:44] just just that part of it which is God's
[43:46] made it special within a marriage that
[43:49] that will be that at the end of the
[43:51] relationship and the beginning of
[43:52] marriage that's where that's to be
[43:54] placed a complete intimacy and guess
[43:56] what it's a it's a it's a partnership
[43:59] but it's an exclusive relationship with
[44:02] just the two of you
[44:05] and you should come into an exclusive
[44:09] relationship with Jesus Christ
[44:13] an intimate relationship with him
[44:16] that nobody's going to talk you out of
[44:18] it
[44:19] it's not an in and out thing I have
[44:21] become married to Jesus Christ he is my
[44:25] lover so to speak in the sense of he's
[44:28] my spiritual connection he's my my one
[44:31] that I've given my life to
[44:34] pray I say this to the children when
[44:35] they get baptized you you uh you take on
[44:39] a woman takes on the husband's name and
[44:42] so she becomes a part of the husband and
[44:44] that's what you do when you get baptized
[44:46] in Merry Christ I take on his name I
[44:48] become him I'm one with him everything I
[44:50] do now represents my husband Christ
[44:52] there's certain things like places I
[44:54] can't go now there's certain things I
[44:55] can't do because I'm a representative
[44:57] I'm his wife
[44:58] what I do reflects on his name
[45:01] that's how serious we should take it but
[45:03] the world has perverted all of it
[45:05] friends and turned it all around and and
[45:07] I I'm blessed to know that God has
[45:10] restored truth
[45:12] not only in a relationship with Christ
[45:13] but the relationship how to direct these
[45:16] young people to approach it the right
[45:17] way and if you're approaching the right
[45:18] way God bless you and may God bless your
[45:21] marriage and God bless you your life
[45:23] because if you respect these values and
[45:25] these scriptural principles
[45:27] that are here God will bless you and God
[45:29] will have a happy marriage for you I
[45:31] believe that
[45:34] how can you know how can you know them
[45:35] until you know who they are how can you
[45:36] love them
[45:38] if you get to know them love grows for
[45:40] them your hearts begin to beat as one as
[45:43] brother Graham said it and it just keeps
[45:44] growing that way it keeps growing that
[45:46] way until there's a complete intimate
[45:48] relationship with one another you're
[45:49] known of one another and by that knowing
[45:52] you love one another more deeply so we
[45:56] go from a limited vision of Christ you
[45:58] still with me
[45:59] we go from a limited vision of Christ to
[46:02] a perfect vision of Christ from partial
[46:05] Revelation to perfect revelation we look
[46:07] how the prophet explains now the
[46:10] prophecy of Paul and I meant to read
[46:11] this Sunday didn't get to it but I'm
[46:12] going to read this and now then I'll
[46:14] close but stay with me here a minute as
[46:16] we look at that this statement that Paul
[46:18] says when that which is perfect is come
[46:20] and this is how the prophet explains
[46:22] that and I'm going to read this to you
[46:24] as they bring it up and this actually
[46:26] originated in a question in 1964. a
[46:29] question what is the evidence of the
[46:31] Holy Ghost that's what somebody was
[46:32] asking what is the evidence what do I
[46:34] look for in an Evidence of Holy Ghost
[46:36] 1964 and I think it's good teaching for
[46:39] us to know this but he said now there
[46:41] there is a really good question now the
[46:44] baptism with the Holy Spirit is a
[46:46] definite experience that a person must
[46:48] receive now let me kind of clear that up
[46:50] just for a minute you see and many
[46:52] people have the idea I believe it's
[46:53] twisted
[46:54] and maybe right here to the church and
[46:56] to the church that's listening there
[46:57] might be a question okay can I do this
[47:00] ah there we go and when I speak of not
[47:02] believing in the initial evidence of the
[47:04] Holy Ghost is speaking with tongues I I
[47:06] do not accept that I believe with God's
[47:08] help I can prove it to you by the Bible
[47:10] that that's wrong because the speaking
[47:12] in tongues is a gift of the Holy Ghost
[47:14] how many knows that Divine Healing is a
[47:17] gift of the Holy Ghost and here Beatles
[47:20] are doing it stop right there we're just
[47:21] going to explain that so you know what
[47:24] he's referring to in 1964. so now here
[47:26] he's saying that the the evidence of the
[47:29] Holy Ghost is not speaking in tongues
[47:31] speaking in tongues is one of the gifts
[47:33] of the Holy Ghost the nine spiritual
[47:34] gifts it's actually at the bottom of all
[47:36] of them and Pentecost in the early days
[47:38] of Pentecost made the doctrine that that
[47:41] is the speaking in an unknown tongue
[47:43] unknown tongue is the evidence that you
[47:47] have the Holy Spirit he said that's
[47:48] wrong I can prove to you the Bible by
[47:50] the Bible That's wrong well where he
[47:52] gets it in the Bible is go right to the
[47:54] book of Acts that's is where they got
[47:55] the book of Acts and they come down and
[47:57] everybody was speaking in unknown
[47:58] tongues that's not true
[48:00] the Bible says they came out of the
[48:02] upper room speaking in other tongues
[48:05] not unknown
[48:07] and all the nations that were gathered
[48:10] in Jerusalem heard them what they were
[48:12] saying in their own language so it was
[48:15] not unknown tongues it was other tongues
[48:17] and these people were praising God in
[48:20] their Hebrew language Jewish language
[48:22] and the people were hearing them a
[48:24] supernatural God was making them hear
[48:26] this gospel or this praise and this
[48:28] worship is what it was there David is
[48:30] drunk in the Holy Spirit coming from the
[48:32] upper room just drunk in the filling of
[48:34] the spirit praising God praise the Lord
[48:36] look what he's doing this is Joel 2 28
[48:39] fulfilled I don't know what they were
[48:40] saying but they were glorifying what God
[48:42] was doing in their own language
[48:45] but somehow all the nations were hearing
[48:47] it in their tongue God did a
[48:50] Supernatural That's not unknown tongues
[48:52] and Pentecost took and said that must be
[48:54] the evidence everybody that has the Holy
[48:56] Ghost has to speak in tongues
[48:58] or they don't have the Holy Ghost
[49:00] unknown tongues
[49:02] look what he says here so how many knows
[49:04] that Divine Healing then he goes
[49:06] Divinity is a gift of the Holy Ghost
[49:08] that's not the Holy Ghost the person
[49:11] it's a gift of the Holy Ghost
[49:13] we don't want just the gift of The Giver
[49:16] we want the giver
[49:18] we don't just want to enjoy the gift of
[49:20] healing praise God thank you for healing
[49:22] me and not know the giver of the healing
[49:25] then he says is a given and here the
[49:28] Bible you know what he's referring to
[49:29] the Beatles the singing group there was
[49:32] evidence of healings taking place in
[49:35] their concerts
[49:37] it's quiet
[49:39] how do you explain that I I really can't
[49:42] explain it I do not know the explanation
[49:45] that but it's I've got the news articles
[49:46] to show it that there was people built
[49:49] up in the frenzy and whatever happened
[49:51] faith I don't know what it was but
[49:53] something happened and besides that all
[49:55] the churches have Miracles taking place
[49:57] right
[49:58] so that can't be the only distinction
[50:01] God can perform God can honor faith in
[50:04] anyone that believes
[50:06] the strangest thing he's referring and
[50:08] he goes a little bit to me to an extreme
[50:10] to say and the Beatles are doing it okay
[50:12] The Beatles are doing it he said it I
[50:15] didn't then he says now that's no
[50:17] evidence oh holy ghost see you can't
[50:18] really rely on that you can't rely upon
[50:20] then he goes through you can't rely upon
[50:21] the fruit of the spirit because the
[50:23] first fruit of the spirit is spirit is
[50:24] love no that's one of the fruits of the
[50:26] spirit and the Christian Science
[50:27] exercise more love than anybody I know
[50:29] of and they even deny Jesus Christ being
[50:31] divine so they have the acts of the
[50:34] fruits of the spirit they can duplicate
[50:35] them the Pharisees duplicate them
[50:37] peace Joy long-suffering they can put
[50:39] them on and not have the giver can you
[50:42] say Amen
[50:43] even an act of love that's what he's
[50:45] talking about there the act of love and
[50:47] and put on these fruits of the spirit
[50:48] and they deny Jesus Christ being Divine
[50:50] you can't deny Jesus Christ you can't
[50:52] deny the word Jesus Christ and say well
[50:55] but I've got all the fruits of the
[50:56] spirit manifesting in my life you can't
[50:58] do that they're gifts they're things of
[51:00] the holy spirit so there's only one
[51:01] evidence holy spirit that I know of and
[51:03] that is a genuine faith in the promised
[51:05] word of the hour
[51:07] all the prophets that portrayed his life
[51:09] in portions played their part so this is
[51:11] later in the quote and he says all the
[51:13] prophets that portrayed his life in
[51:14] portions partial play their part but in
[51:18] him was the fullness of the Prophet so
[51:19] now he's taken all the Old Testament and
[51:21] all of them reflecting Christ through a
[51:24] glass Darkly but when you get to Christ
[51:26] of 2000 years ago you have a Perfection
[51:29] that come into into Christ that all the
[51:32] prophets and the law was talking about
[51:34] it came to a perfection
[51:36] so watch what he says now here he said
[51:38] all the prophet has betrayed his life in
[51:40] portions played the part he was in
[51:42] Joseph he was in Moses okay in portion
[51:45] in portion
[51:47] the prophets the word of the Lord came
[51:48] to them the prophets but this was the
[51:50] word and the prophet the same person now
[51:52] when a man receives Christ in that
[51:53] manner that he is in you can accept it
[51:55] as being you see now some of them say
[51:58] well I'm a Lutheran well there's nothing
[52:00] against that but the Eagles don't feed
[52:01] on that you see that was as far as it
[52:03] was that was fresh food of that day I'm
[52:06] a Wesleyan that's all right but you're
[52:08] living in the past you see now those
[52:10] people said why if we have we have
[52:12] Abraham Our Father the prophet said
[52:14] God's able to be Stones arise children
[52:16] to Abraham so where's this evidence it's
[52:18] knowing the Christ for your hour not a
[52:21] past portion of Christ not a past
[52:23] revelation of him not going back to
[52:26] Luther's day that was good for them
[52:27] Wesley's day that was good for them but
[52:29] knowing him now because even the Jew
[52:31] says we have Abraham Our Father how
[52:34] could they spiritually be the children
[52:36] of Abraham and denying their Messiah
[52:41] so it come to the Perfection and they
[52:43] missed it
[52:44] because they were reaching back we have
[52:47] Abraham Our Father physically they could
[52:48] say that that's true I'm from my father
[52:50] Abraham but spiritually they weren't
[52:52] connected with the word Christ for the
[52:54] hour and seeing him in front of them
[52:55] face to face in a Perfection that all
[52:58] the prophets wrote about he's standing
[53:00] in front of them
[53:01] so we get to the gift of the Holy Ghost
[53:04] you're quiet tonight we belong to this
[53:06] we belong to that that had nothing he
[53:08] said you generation of snakes who's
[53:10] warned you to flee from the Wrath don't
[53:11] begin to say we have Abraham to our
[53:13] father because God's able these stones
[53:15] to rise children to Abraham you see so
[53:17] being a well-trained theologian had
[53:18] nothing to do with it being Meek and
[53:20] gentle had nothing to do with it what
[53:22] made him different he was the word made
[53:24] flesh not the word for the day of Moses
[53:26] Moses was for that day word not the word
[53:29] for the days of Noah know us was the
[53:31] word for that day the word for the day
[53:33] of Elijah Elijah was the word for that
[53:35] day but he was the present tense word
[53:37] and they were living in the back so the
[53:41] first point he makes about us coming to
[53:42] a Perfection at the end time and the
[53:45] perfect uh the more perfect way is you
[53:48] can't reach back into the past
[53:50] into a partial Revelation because it's
[53:53] not a perfect revelation
[53:55] the same thing repeats that's the
[53:57] evidence of the Holy Ghost when God
[53:58] reveals to you you see it thus said the
[54:00] Lord and accept it not what you are what
[54:02] you was or nothing about it it's what
[54:04] God had done for you now there's the
[54:06] evidence now the Holy Spirit when it
[54:07] comes it is a witness unto you that this
[54:09] word is right the word for today not the
[54:12] word for Luther the word not the word
[54:14] for Moses we witness it's the truth but
[54:16] it's it's another day now what if Jesus
[54:19] would have come and said now as Moses
[54:21] come talking to you taking you out of
[54:23] Egypt I've come taking you out of
[54:25] somewhere else what if he said let's go
[54:26] to work and build an ark here Jesus
[54:28] would have said that
[54:29] I'm the Lord God I'm going to float the
[54:31] world away now I'm going to drown the
[54:33] world all of them see we'd be an out of
[54:35] the see the scripture never said he'd
[54:36] come like that see he wouldn't have been
[54:38] the Messiah no matter how much Ark he
[54:41] built or whatever he had done he's still
[54:42] not he had he'd not have qualified the
[54:45] Messiah Hallelujah there you are it's
[54:47] qualification yes sir stop right there
[54:50] and now he goes to the scripture that I
[54:53] have been reading for several weeks now
[54:55] he goes to First Corinthians 13 and says
[54:57] when that which is perfect is come that
[55:02] which is in part shall be done away
[55:06] I feel safer with him bringing that
[55:08] scripture than any of us if he applied
[55:11] that to this now we ought to just sit up
[55:13] and pay attention
[55:14] that he's talking about Christ and them
[55:16] hanging on to their past
[55:18] coming to the Perfection after the Old
[55:20] Testament and now you have seven Church
[55:22] ages now you have all this 2000 years of
[55:25] church history them knowing Christ
[55:27] through a glass Darkly okay but he says
[55:30] when that which is perfect is come you
[55:33] can't reach back to a past revelation
[55:37] it would be detrimental when that
[55:40] perfect appearing has come to try to
[55:43] reach back now
[55:44] can't do it and the evidence actually
[55:46] you have the Holy Spirit is that is that
[55:49] you will connect with that which has
[55:51] come that's perfect that'll be the
[55:53] evidence of the Holy Ghost
[55:54] finishing up here so all these little
[55:56] things so he says when that which is
[55:58] perfect has come that which is in part
[56:00] is done away so all these little things
[56:02] of jumping up and down like a kid trying
[56:05] to talk in tongues and all these other
[56:06] things
[56:08] and that which is perfect
[56:10] and we have today by God's help the
[56:14] perfect interpretation of the word with
[56:17] Divine vindication
[56:21] there'd be a lot that squawk at that
[56:24] but because I've been serving the lord
[56:26] all these years and because he said it
[56:27] and because I've seen the Vindication of
[56:29] it he's exactly right
[56:32] Revelations 10 7.
[56:34] through the seventh angel the mystery of
[56:36] God should be finished Malachi 4 5 and 6
[56:38] Elijah coming to restore all the truth
[56:41] back
[56:42] there's too many scriptures that show
[56:44] exactly what he's saying there'll be a
[56:47] day coming and we're in that day when
[56:48] that which is perfect
[56:50] has come
[56:52] aren't you glad to live in this age
[56:55] I feel honored to live in this age
[56:58] didn't Jesus say something like this as
[57:00] many prophets and sages would have
[57:02] longed to hear the things that you hear
[57:04] every Sunday and Wednesday we're here
[57:06] there's prophets in the Old Testament
[57:08] that would give everything they had to
[57:10] be able to sit in one service that you
[57:12] hear the fullness of the word
[57:16] so we should say Thank You Lord For That
[57:19] and we have we have today by God's help
[57:21] the perfect interpretation of the word
[57:22] with Divine Vindication then that which
[57:24] is in which is in part is done away with
[57:27] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[57:29] understood his child but when I became a
[57:31] man I put away childish things now we
[57:36] could take it too far and say we're
[57:38] putting all the manifestations of God
[57:40] away that's not what he's saying
[57:42] we let God be God
[57:46] if he wants he continues to do this we
[57:49] let him do and vindicate to our young
[57:51] people that he's real can you say Amen
[57:54] I've said this before and I don't mean
[57:56] it mostly
[57:58] I don't need to see one more Miracle to
[58:00] keep me serving the lord
[58:03] I'm I'm All In
[58:05] because I've met the person
[58:07] he doesn't have to bless me financially
[58:09] or in any way if he never did again if I
[58:12] become a pauper
[58:14] I'm not leaving Christ
[58:17] I'm not Sherry's song says I'm not going
[58:20] anywhere let the devil know I'm not
[58:21] going anywhere he thinks oh they're
[58:23] gonna they're finished now this trial
[58:25] they had they're finished now I want to
[58:27] let the devil know I'm not going
[58:28] anywhere if I never see another miracle
[58:31] Another Blessing of God I'm not going
[58:34] anywhere because why this is not about
[58:37] another miracle to me this is a
[58:39] relationship of knowing him
[58:42] this is a face to face with him this is
[58:45] not a dress code can I get an amen this
[58:48] is not I believe in the dress code and I
[58:50] live by the dress code because I trusted
[58:52] God sent that too but this is not about
[58:54] a dress code to me this is not about
[58:56] rules to me don't do this and kick this
[58:58] out this is not about that I do that to
[59:01] sanctify my life because that's what
[59:03] came from the word of God but I don't do
[59:05] it and live and stay with Christ because
[59:07] of the do's and don'ts
[59:10] I do it because I love him and I'm in a
[59:12] relationship with him
[59:14] let him take everything from me let them
[59:16] take my my books let them take the
[59:18] message from me let him take my tablet
[59:20] let them now take my Bible which by the
[59:22] way they did in the early church they
[59:23] took their Bibles the Catholic Church
[59:25] took the Bibles away from people
[59:28] and the restoration gave our Bibles back
[59:30] to us
[59:31] come on now you know your history Luther
[59:34] and all of them thank God for King James
[59:36] King James Bible
[59:38] God was God used them
[59:41] but let them take this away and guess
[59:43] what guess what
[59:44] that's why when the people have the word
[59:46] in in them in communist country they got
[59:48] enough of the word in them you'll see
[59:49] all scriptures written on the wall and
[59:51] they don't have their Bible anymore but
[59:52] they remembered enough and God remembers
[59:54] to write them on the wall
[59:55] take this away from me tonight
[59:57] and I am in a relationship with Christ I
[1:00:00] will go on
[1:00:02] I will go on because this is not about
[1:00:03] rules it's not about it's not about
[1:00:06] trying to please him I I already pleased
[1:00:09] him
[1:00:10] when he took his son at Calvary can you
[1:00:12] say amen I was approved in the Beloved
[1:00:15] now I do want to please him I do I don't
[1:00:17] want to grieve his Spirit but but I'm
[1:00:19] not trying to gain my entrance to Heaven
[1:00:22] by my works
[1:00:25] the love is there he's proved it to me
[1:00:27] the love is there from him to me from me
[1:00:30] to him it's there it can never be
[1:00:32] removed
[1:00:34] that's just perfect just come we move
[1:00:36] out of this childish when I was a child
[1:00:38] I spake as a child I understood as a
[1:00:40] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:00:43] childish things and what does that mean
[1:00:45] I don't dump out the gifts I'm not
[1:00:48] preaching that okay but you can't depend
[1:00:50] on just the gift
[1:00:52] now it's face to face with the giver
[1:00:55] it's face to face with him this message
[1:00:58] has brought us of the last days a
[1:01:00] completely different relationship with
[1:01:02] the Lord than the churches ever had
[1:01:04] before
[1:01:06] it's completely different knowing of
[1:01:08] Christ and completely it's not through a
[1:01:09] glass Darkly this is a face to face with
[1:01:12] him and I'm calling by the grace of God
[1:01:14] and the Holy Spirit of God every young
[1:01:16] person every person if you're just got a
[1:01:19] religion of this message I'm calling you
[1:01:21] this is much more than that
[1:01:23] the person meets us every service the
[1:01:26] person knows you he knows your name
[1:01:29] the person of Christ is speaking to your
[1:01:33] heart the person of Christ is speaking
[1:01:35] to your heart on the Internet or if it's
[1:01:36] on the broadcast the person of Christ
[1:01:38] it's the person of the word that's
[1:01:40] making himself real that's appearing in
[1:01:42] the last days and he's longing to to to
[1:01:45] take your heart and and to bring you
[1:01:48] into a love relationship with him not a
[1:01:51] religion but a relationship this is not
[1:01:53] about religion this is about
[1:01:55] relationship and this is the hour this
[1:01:57] is the time this is the day of his
[1:01:59] appearing
[1:02:00] this is the day when Christ makes him
[1:02:02] known he takes all the veils off what's
[1:02:04] the Book of Revelations mean Revelation
[1:02:05] means unveiling he's taken all those
[1:02:08] veils off of himself he's revealing
[1:02:10] himself to his people
[1:02:12] so don't reach back into just a blessing
[1:02:14] and I want God to answer this prayer and
[1:02:15] I want God to do this that's fine it
[1:02:17] will always bring our prayers to him but
[1:02:19] if you only have that and not know him
[1:02:22] then you're falling short
[1:02:24] he wants to know you
[1:02:26] he wants to know you more he wants to
[1:02:29] know you closer can you say Amen
[1:02:31] he wants to be so close to you that
[1:02:35] whatever would happen around you and
[1:02:37] whatever friends that you would lose or
[1:02:39] whatever this world dishes out to you
[1:02:43] what stays intact is your relationship
[1:02:45] with him
[1:02:48] did you hear me out tonight
[1:02:50] are you picking up when I'm laying down
[1:02:52] using all these modern terms I hope
[1:02:54] you're picking up what I'm laying down
[1:02:56] because God wants a relationship with
[1:02:59] you through the message of the last days
[1:03:01] and the light on the Scriptures it
[1:03:03] wasn't even you know there's a lot of
[1:03:04] people think he just brought back a
[1:03:06] dress code for the women the message is
[1:03:08] just God saying I'm going to bring the
[1:03:09] women under bondage oh my goodness how
[1:03:12] can somebody conclude I can tell you
[1:03:14] they're not looking into it themselves
[1:03:16] they're taking somebody's opinion
[1:03:18] because this is this is so much Beyond
[1:03:21] just a dress code
[1:03:24] so much Beyond just sanctification
[1:03:26] Beyond it and you should sanctify your
[1:03:28] life but this is
[1:03:30] this is deeper can you say Amen let's
[1:03:32] Stand Together God bless you thank you
[1:03:34] for letting me finish this tonight
[1:03:36] and I know it took a little taking a
[1:03:39] little bit over an hour
[1:03:40] but uh I pray that it'll be a blessing
[1:03:43] to you this evening you're a little
[1:03:44] quiet and tired but that's all right as
[1:03:47] long as you were listening take it in
[1:03:48] and speak to the Lord that's that's the
[1:03:50] main thing praise the Lord God is good I
[1:03:54] have a man
[1:03:58] make about it
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:09] before
[1:04:11] even time began

[1:04:27] my name

[1:04:35] my every thought

[1:04:43] each tear that falls and hears me when
[1:04:51] I call listen to this now I have a
[1:04:55] father
[1:04:56] I have
[1:04:59] a farm ER thank you Lord oh he calls me
[1:05:07] his own what a relationship

[1:05:31] my name
[1:05:35] he knows
[1:05:43] and he sees
[1:05:45] each tear that falls
[1:05:50] and hears me when
[1:05:53] I call
[1:05:56] one more course think about this now
[1:05:59] what we've been preaching in these last
[1:06:01] services on the excellent way you know
[1:06:03] what it is
[1:06:05] oh lord
[1:06:07] your beautiful
[1:06:13] your face
[1:06:15] is all I see
[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:21] for when
[1:06:26] I are
[1:06:27] homeless child
[1:06:30] your grace
[1:06:33] abounds
[1:06:34] in me leave it covet covet earnestly the
[1:06:39] best gifts and yet show I unto you a
[1:06:43] more excellent way
[1:06:44] though I speak with tongues of men and
[1:06:46] of angels and have not charity I am
[1:06:48] become as a sounding brass and a
[1:06:50] tinkling symbol and though I have the
[1:06:52] gift of Prophecy and understand all
[1:06:54] Mysteries and all knowledge and though I
[1:06:57] have all Faith so that I could remove
[1:06:58] mountains and have not charity I'm
[1:07:01] nothing and though I bestow all my goods
[1:07:03] to feed the poor and though I give my
[1:07:05] body to be burned and have not charity
[1:07:07] it profit of me nothing charity
[1:07:09] suffereth long it's kind charity envious
[1:07:13] not charity vaulteth not itself is not
[1:07:15] puffed up does not behave itself
[1:07:17] unseemingly seeketh not her own is not
[1:07:20] easily provoked thinketh no evil
[1:07:22] rejoiceth not an iniquity but rejoices
[1:07:25] in the truth beareth all things
[1:07:27] believeth all things hope with all
[1:07:28] things endureth all things charity never
[1:07:32] fails but whether there be prophecies
[1:07:35] they'll fail whether they be tongues
[1:07:37] they shall cease whether it be knowledge
[1:07:39] it shall vanish away for we know in part
[1:07:42] and we prophesy in part but when that
[1:07:45] which is perfect has come then that
[1:07:46] which is in part shall be done away when
[1:07:49] I was a child I spake as a child I under
[1:07:51] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:07:54] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:07:57] childish things for we now we see
[1:08:00] through a glass Darkly but then face to
[1:08:03] face now I know in part but then shall I
[1:08:06] know even as also I am known now abide
[1:08:09] of faith hope charity these three but
[1:08:13] the greatest of these is Charity Divine
