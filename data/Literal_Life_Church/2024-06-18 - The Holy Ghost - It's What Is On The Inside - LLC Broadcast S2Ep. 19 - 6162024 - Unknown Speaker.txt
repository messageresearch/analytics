new mercies I see all I have thy hand has P my head Great Is Thy Faithfulness great Great Is Thy Faithfulness great is thy [Music] faithful unto me great is my faithfulness in John 7:38 and this is an ongoing series here on the Holy Ghost he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified so if we go back and see he's speaking of the spirit affecting a human being so much that it actually flows from the inside out so we have to look at this this U picture of Jesus pointing to what the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost will do in us we have to look at this picture because we always look at it as this him filling us and we know that's true on the day of Pentecost they were all filled with the Holy Ghost but you see now you can't just look at it that way this is something working from the inside out this is something because if we always look at it as something always coming from the outside in and we know the Holy Ghost can do that then we're missing the the deepest mystery behind what the Holy Ghost does in you because in you it will be something that's happening inside not outside but inside and it'll actually flow out as we'll read it again out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water and and the the theologians they I looked it up and they they can't find this reference in the Old Testament that it says as the script rure saith they can't find it but there is some references there to the this thing of out of the belly flowing and the rivers of living water flowing there is references to the rivers of living water in the Old Testament but guess what those rivers are coming out of you yeah by the Holy Ghost so it is there and then he said this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified so this is the coming of the Holy Ghost here that Jesus refers to and uh I I just wanted to mention there's something else that's said there before we move on at the end of it that he said this is the spirit that will come for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified so this is a reference to the holy ghost coming after Calvary and that's an interesting thing because after Calvary the Holy Ghost would do something deeper than it ever did in the Old Testament and that is it would move to the level of the soul the Holy Ghost has always been there if you know the Holy Ghost of as the the one who came the person who came in the word of every generation in Moses day in Joshua's day that was the Holy Ghost himself moving in and anointing and uh and and anointing a man's Spirit the Bible says prophets were moved the oldtime prophets were moved by the Holy Ghost so it's not that the day of Pentecost was the first time the Holy Ghost came no it was always there but now Jesus makes a distinction is that it could not become rivers of something coming out of you until he went to Calvary and he was glorified and the reason the Holy Ghost couldn't come on your soul in the Old Testament is because it had serpent nature on it right God's not going to dwell the same place with his serpent nature so something had to take care of your serpent nature First Calvary took care of your serpent nature and the one you were born with so that you could be born again by the Holy Ghost and now the potential is there for his Spirit to rest in your soul that's pretty powerful friends and the Holy Ghost had never done something that deep on a human being that's why it's prophesied throughout the body body what without the with with all the testimonies of the Holy Ghost and everything that he did all the prophets nothing will ever Trump now what he's going to do with his spirit and that's put it in the heart of man that's pretty powerful that's the mystery of Christ actually that was hidden that's the Eve that was hidden in Adam praise the Lord so so now we uh had covered a part here last Sunday about God doing the drawing instead of and that's the part of the Holy Ghost we covered Sunday I think I I talked about the Simplicity of Christ then we talked about that no man can come except my father first draw him so God does everything in other words if you if you come to repentance it's the H it's him drawing you if if you want the Holy Ghost he's already drawing your heart if you desire to be healed or if you desire something from God guess what he already put that desire within you this coming of the spirit would be something that's deep on the inside after Calvary and it would be so deep that it would go to the soul level it would be not just something uh that would be on the outside manifestation and this is interesting because there's references All Through the Bible in uh uh in the Old Testament All Through the Bible in fact that the Holy Ghost uh coming in the Old Testament and it seems as if it says that it had not come yet when he speaks of the day of Pentecost but that's not what he was saying this coming of the Holy Ghost would be different with a deeper uh purpose on the day of Pentecost it would be fulfilling something and going way down deep to the soul level it's not on the outside it's on the inside coming out of you as Rivers flowing as as out of your belly shall rivers of flowing water and this spake he of the spirit that was to come this is what it would be it would some be something working from the inside out can you say amen and remember religion religion always religion is a Reformation from the outside in but God's gospel and his word always works from the inside out the gospel deals with the inside first the message is to bring the Holy Spirit back to deal with your inside first first and then let God put things together on the outside it's the opposite of psychology it's the opposite it's the opposite motive of all of that denomination all of that it's it's a pure gospel and it's meant to go to your soul first that's the new birth the new birth is not something from the outside in it's from the inside out is that okay with everybody so any religion without the power of God is to work to reform you on the outside to dress it up to make it look good like a pig you didn't change his nature you bring him on the front row you put a you dress him up nice with a bow tie and you look it make him look better than I even look tonight set him there give him a jerk every now and then to say Amen or oink or something like that he'll act a part out but as it's been said take the leash off and after a while he'll run to the quickest M mud hole that he can find get right down in that mud hole and oh this is me this is me I love this what happened to your pig you didn't change the nature this is not it's a personal thing it's a personal Revival it's a personal change but it comes by the word of God and one of the EV the evidence you have is that you'll never deny any of this word of God and that's what I said Sunday my evidence I know is that there's nothing in my soul level since I received the Holy Ghost that would buck up against any of this word I might not understand some of it until he re reveals it I might say oh that but if there's nothing left down here to resist and buck up against any word of God that's how I knew I had something changed in my life and I just been going on since 16 years old what am I now 25 I think I just been going on growing in the Lord you know all these 10 years why are you laughing I just been going on just and it's it's from Revelation to Revelation then I found that place in the word where Jesus was with he was with the men on the road to Emmas and this is after he had done all his miracles and everything but these men on the road to Emmas he just talked to them and they didn't know who he is who he was so he just he says and then when they finish he says did not our hearts burn with us while he opened to us the scriptures and then their eyes were open inside the house they realized wait a minute this is Jesus the Same Jesus that did the Miracles is the Jesus that's being real to me by doing what opening the scriptures to me and I said to my heart I wasn't here when brother Brown was here so I didn't see I've seen a lot of Miracles and I still see them I've seen the blind eyes open so I thank God for that but I know that I wasn't in the day when I seen all the Miracles but the same Jesus that worked in brother rah's life it was it was sitting here with me and ministering to me opening up the Bible to me and that's just that's just as powerful or more powerful than all the Miracles he can do he knew the Jesus they knew the Jesus that was opening scripture matter of fact those days in between his uh in between his death and his Ascension that's what he was doing for the disciples he was opening the scriptures can you say Amen so now it's word upon word if I can have that quote again it's word by word that's where he failed in the Garden of Eden that's where he's always failed that's where them the tape on the false anointed ones and the anointed ones if you don't know what that is that's uh most of you should know but he preached the message brother Brandon fals anointed ones at the end time you should listen to that cuz that's where God spoke to us through his prophet and taught us that the just will fall on the the rain will fall on the just and the unjust and that that his anointing true anointing can fall on vessels that are even false and preach in false Doctrine now I like I said I don't understand how God set that up and why he did it that way but it is a truth that the and this revealed it the false anointed ones he preached revealed it they can be Anointed with the spirit speak in tongues dance shout preach the gospel and still a devil sir honestly I don't understand all that I just know I've seen it happen and I know it's the truth but then he says these few things and I preached on the last one Sunday no man I think these are three things to help clear up the confusion on the evidence of the Holy Ghost because that's what he's saying there's so much confusion about the evidence of the Holy Ghost this is where he clears it up and I spoke Sunday all the father hath given me uh will come to me that pretty much clear clears it up can you say Amen cuz you can't work your way into this it's all the father's already given they're going to come and no man can come except my father's drawing him first so that with that laid then I drop back to what he said here on tonight speaking a little bit about what he said first when he's countering the wrong interpretations and confusion about the evidence of the Holy Ghost then he he talks about the anointing falling of the Holy Ghost but then he says it's the inside and there he's he's in a subject of predestination and the seed and we understand that part and it's been and it's important to realize now you couldn't come unless your father draw your father drawed you but you'd have to be in his mind before the foundation of the world we see then that there's a confusion about it but you see that it's it's God they were predestination all the father hath given me will come he says that in John chapter 6 when he's addressing might as well mention this again when he's dealing with John chapter 6 he's dealing with 5,000 followers of Jesus all enticed by the fishes and Lo's miracle and all the Miracles and setting up as as a king then he starts to say that I'm the bread of life you've got to eat of me he he he to break the word to the people then 70 of his disciples leave many leave because of the word he's preaching and that's what's separating and in the midst of all that he's saying things like all the father ha given me will come no man man can come except my father's wrong he's he's laying in predestination to them to realize you can't come of your own ACC Accord you have to be predestinated to this and God has to call you to this he's laying it into them and then he one chapter he goes from 5,000 followers to 12 in one chapter and one's a devil I mean that was a pretty quick Ministry you know like 6,000 yeah 12 and one's a devil you got 11 left and then no wonder Jesus said you guys going away too and Peter says from the from his soul something resoning something's right he didn't even have the Holy Ghost yet but something's answering saying thou the Christ you have the words of the Living God hallelujah remember what he said now thou Hast the words of eternal life and and Jesus said then he said my words I speak unto you they are spirit and they are it's always tied with the word so but the last thing the first thing I want to elaborate is it's the inside so when we talk about this it's a focus on the inside if he's talking about the evidence and that's what he is in this quote there's two things never use an outside manifestation as a personal evidence that you have it that's what he's teaching here it's on the inside everything's happening on the inside that's what he's trying to get to is something happening a change a change of your desire ties a new birth all on the inside not the outside the inside and so it's on the inside it's amazing to to see this now because he h he has he has to say this this way in this quote why is brother brand saying it's on the inside or it's the inside because of the confusion what confusion that for some reason many of the Great and I say this respectfully many of the Great outside manifestations of God can be impersonated so that makes it hard and it can make it confusing cuz let me say tonight as a qualification just so I don't get labeled against the manifestations of God we can never we never want to downplay the fact that his holy ghost can do and can still do Mighty things among us he's still doing it he always will do it and if we start downplaying that and not praying in faith that he can do it then we're missing something see so I want don't want to be known as someone that's that's preaching against that cuz if I would preach against that and I'm not even a gospel preacher because we know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we know he can manifest his power at any moment he can do anything how many believe that we're believing for some cancer cases here and some different things going on and in the last few months some sin in the church and things and you know what God God is dealing with those things God is dealing with hearts that's what the Holy Ghost is for but the manifestation of the gifts and the church and and healings and all these other things we never want to downplay the fact his holy ghost can do and is still doing Mighty things among us one of the reasons we should pray for that and this is the way I've said it I have said that I don't need to see another miracle for me to stay a Christian or stay believing if God never did another one hey I'm all here I'm in until the duration of this thing but our children and our unbelievers need to see the power of God they need to see the move of God they need to see the outside manifestation because they don't have anything on the inside yet so they need to see God doing something say God's among these people God's doing something here but we we want to just rightly divide this because if if the the church is in the spirit of God he will do these things but we must separate this move and this thing we must separate it correctly and never use an outside manifestation as a personal evidence that you have received the Holy Ghost because brother Braham says it's the inside it's not the outside it's not what he does on the outside that may lead you to believe the first second second poll is to cause you to believe in God that's right believe that he's real right but we can't stay at the first and second pole and so so now it's it's we should never cling to something that's one of those manifestations as evidence it's the inside that draws that we should draw on for our evidence the reason it's been confused also the second reason is if people use an outside evidence it can't be solid sometimes because we know God can manifest himself but then when we know Satan can copy that sometimes in the in the in the coming of the spirit of God there will be lot a lot of things on the outside that we can Rejoice over that we can testim have testimonies of that we can actually see with our eyes that he's doing but what he does in you is deeper than that both will be going on if it's a if it's a holy ghost filled church both would be going on at the same time yes the outward things that you can see but then I'm always saying God what's happening on the inside because there's a lot of groups it's a lot of outward but you're questioning but what where's the true repentance where's the heart where's where's that person's heart you see the Holy Ghost does not come and manifest and show Miracles just to show off it's to draw somebody into the holy ghost in a Deeper Life to cry out to God to say I need him personally I need God God's here but I need more than a miracle I need him to change me he's there for for a reason so uh I can safely say God is out to deal in the soul level more than he is just to manif manifest himself on the outside verse 24 of Ezekiel 36 for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out from all the countries now this is speaking of Israel but it's a type of the what the holy spirit will do to his people and you individually he'll do this to you individually for I will take you from among the Heathen gather you out of all the countries will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all of your Idols will I cleanse you so there's a cleansing that goes on who's doing it who's doing it you we got to do all this stuff in preparation get ready for the Holy Ghost well I think you should offer up a surrendered heart I think you should follow the word and be obedient but you can't even to repentance unless he's drawing you and all these scriptures says I'm going to come and clean you with water from all your filthiness from all your Idols why clean a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you praise the Lord I got the Holy Ghost no no no brother re says no that's not his new spirit yet that's he gives you a new spirit that's right because you can't even get along along with yourself with your spirit brother brah says you can't even get along with neighbors or yourself how are you going to get along with God to start receiving anything from him you're not even in in the place yet and God says they have and you know what else you have he says and I will take away your Stony heart you got a Stony heart towards God you were born with it Stony heart I got to replace your spirit he hasn't even filled you with the Holy Ghost yet he's got to do all this he says I'll take the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh and then he says in verse 20 27 and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statues and you shall keep my judgments and do them you'll live the word because the author of the word is on the inside you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God I will also save you from your uncleanness and I will call for corn and will increase it and lay there's the maturity that comes adoption maturity and lay no famine upon you and I will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field this is what's to happen in your life personally by the Holy Ghost it's going to multiply it's going to be rivers rivers coming from the your uttermost being it's going to be an increase can you say amen I will multiply the fruit and tree and increase the field and ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the Heathen did anybody ever noticed and I know some of you have that the word I is mentioned nine times and you're not mentioned at all doing anything in this he said I will do this I will do that I will do that I will cleanse you I will do it that's why I said no man can come except my father draws him first and all the father had given me will come you need cleansing I'll do that Hallelujah you need a you have a Stony heart I'll take care of that Stony heart and religion is trying to address all these things you got to have the softer heart to come before the Lord you've got to do this you got and I do think we yield to him but in this scripture about the Holy Ghost coming into you he does it all Hallelujah he does it all it's not you mention you're not mentioned doing any of that the word I is nine times I will take you out from the Heathen I will cleanse you I'll take away your Stony heart I'll give you a new spirit and when I'm done with that work and that's why I said the first Sunday I talked on Simplicity we can't complicate this thing of the Holy Ghost because you see now friends what I want to get into is that when the Holy Ghost is moving it can affect people in a lot of different ways and he can make people feel better he can heal people it's all the Holy Ghost and when he cleanses you and when he changes your Stony heart it's all him doing it if we'll yield to him am but sometimes it's preached where hey you know you don't have nothing yet and that's why I tried to say if God has done something in your life you say well I don't know if it's the Holy Ghost yet and after you preach this I'm I'm not sure but if he's done something you say I know God called me when I was a young boy at 8 years old I know God spoke to my heart I know I was baptized I know just a few years ago I know God led me into this don't you ever let the devil belittle what he's done in your life you ought to celebrate it you ought to worship about it because the same God that was doing all those things is the same God that will give you everything that you lack to make the Rapture yes he will praise God you going to tell me that a God Like that's doing all that work I said Sunday we are his workmanship if we're under his workers ship and stay in that powder's wheel and stay under his workmanship you don't have to be afraid that you're lacking something you just have to show desperation say God I seen that word he preached tonight I seen that word he preached I want that Lord that's my inheritance but you can't do anything to get it except yield he is the one that does the work Paul said I fear your Minds be corrupted from the Simplicity that's in Christ and I pray I can preach it this the youngest child could understand it this is for you and the devil's the one that complicates it thank you for watching our message today if you would like more information please contact us by visiting our website literall life. church and if you
