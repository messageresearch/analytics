now but we'd sure love to hear maybe look something up um while she's looking it up and coming I appreciate it so much let's give her a hand God bless [Applause] [Music] you in my m moments of fear through every pain through every tear there's a God who's been faithful to [Music] me with my strength was all godone and with my heart had no song still in love he's per faithful to me every word he's promised is [Music] true and what I thought was so impossible I've seen SE my god do he's been faithful faithful to me looking back it's his love and his Mercy I see the in my heart I have questioned even fail to believe yet he's been faithful faithful to [Music] me when my heart looked away the many times that I could not pray still my God he was faithful to me the days I spent so selfishly reaching out for what pleased me even then he's been faithful to me every time I come back to him he is waiting with his opened arms and I can see once again that he was faithful faithful to me looking back it's his love and his Mercy I see though in my heart I have question even fail to believe yet he's been [Music] faithful faithful to me keep me faithful faithful to [Music] you and when I walk through the valleys keep me close to you let me keep my eyes upon you be faithful and true keep me faithful faithful to you sometimes in my heart I have questioned even fail to believe yet he's been faithful faithful to [Applause] me Hallelujah let's stand together if you would and read in the book of Hebrews at times I've had questions and even failed to believe but he was faithful He's been Faithful thankful for that this morning praise the Lord Hebrews chapter 2 and I'm going to read from three or four places in Hebrews here catching uh a little bit about this um man mzc it's just mentioned several times in the book of Hebrews and there is a mystery under his life and I wanted to talk a little bit about it this morning and preach so we begin here in Hebrews chapter 2 Hebrews chapter 2 and verse 9 but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor so you know now that from even from this scripture before we go on Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels He took on something lower even than what he was uh he was there but then he condescended and come and was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with Glory and Honor that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man so what Jesus did in his human uh Journey here in the in the human life what Jesus did had an effect on others because he tasted death for every man and it goes on to say further for it became him for whom are all things and by all are all things in bringing many sons unto Glory so you'll have this theme here where it's talking about the Son of God but then it's talking about Sons plural and they're tied together because whatever the son did the only begotten son the first son whatever he did has an effect on all the sons of God right in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings all right we'll pick it up here now uh in chapter 5 and verse 6 and as he saith also in another place thou art a priest Forever After the order of MDC who in the days of his flesh which he's talking about Jesus again in the days of his flesh once again saying that there was a season of 33 years that he come down and condescended and became a human being like us in the days of this flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered this is a real mystery because we wouldn't think that the perfect Son of God how many know that Jesus Christ was the son of God and he was perfect and and yet the scriptures speaks of on The Human Side he had to live out this learning obedience by the things that he suffered and being made perfect well we wouldn't think of him as being having to be formed or made perfect but there were elements that he went through in order to come to something to receive crown and glory in this life and he being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation once again unto all them all the rest of them that obey him so you can see the mystery is that we could never get out of here we could never make it through this human life we could never have any hope until he came first and lived out this life and that would have an effect Upon Our human life that that that actually we could follow him and go to the same Glory called of God a high priest after the order of mzc so look at that then and then he says of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing so he says I have many things to say about this MDC he said but but I can't elaborate on all the mystery behind this man because you're doll of hearing for when when for a time you ought to be teaching yourself ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such as one need of milk and not of strong meat in other words you're babies you stay babies you want just to hear the principles of the of the things that are just the beginning principles of what a baby is taught when he first comes to the Lord but you can't just hear that you have to grow to become sons that are mature that can hear all of the word of God for everyone that useth milk just milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe that that Minister who only ministers milk he's a babe himself and he can't take the son's IM maturity if he's just bringing milk all the time but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercise to discern both good and evil maturity and grown up is that we have our senses ourself that somebody doesn't have to come and tell us what to do we have our senses exercised we can discern the wrong Spirit and the right Spirit that's maturity you know I I tell people Hey listen God's given me some discernment through years I'm not checking it out at the door I'm going to use it it's Holy Spirit discernment therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection well this is what Jesus did he he come on he was made perfect he come into Perfection not uh not in the sense that we think perfection in our bod sinless Perfection but growth to maturity let us go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead or of Eternal judgment you can see these themes are very much a part of the kingdom of God the laying on of hands the healings can you say amen the doctrine of baptism these things are all essential Elementary principles but if we only preach those things and only emphasize those things we can't grow where we need to be of dead and unal judgment and this we will do if God permit which means that we will grow to Perfection and maturity if God permits last set of scriptures on mzd is chapter 7 verse1 for this mzc king of Salem priest of the most high God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after also king of Salem Jerusalem which is king of peace without father without mother without dissent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually now consider how great this man was are you catching it now he says he's a man that met MDC but he had no beginning of days or ending of Life mystery behind this man but consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils amen father may you bless your word today as we break it to the people may you anoint our hearts I father father there are many hearts of the people here and listening abroad that Lord would maybe if they need something from you you're aware of that need today and I pray Lord your Holy Spirit would take control that the power of God that's in your word Paul said I come not to you with enticing words of man's Wisdom but with power and demonstration in the Holy Ghost it's by testimony by witness that if there's a life of the Holy Ghost that's overcoming then Lord we can witness of that that in our own lives we have hundreds here that can witness of it in their lives so it's not just a intellectual gospel but it has the power with it to change lives and live an overcoming life let that be displayed through the preaching and through our lives this morning and we pray that you'll draw the Hungry Heart closer to you in Jesus name amen God bless you you may be seated there's amazing there's an amazing mystery under this person who met Abraham in Genesis 14 if you don't know where it's at That's Where It's At there's an amazing mystery so much so that Paul kept mentioning it in Hebrews and he said there's a lot of things under this life and mysterious and theologians through the years have tried their best to explain who is mzc who is this man is he just the priesthood is he uh they can't explain it because there's a mystery around his life and uh it it under it under this mystery is many things but under of course is the truth of predestination under mzc in the mystery there's the truth of predestination and there are other things uh the prophet says that we find here in this mystery of mzc the complete Secret Of Our Lives of the Journey of our lives so I I'd be curious to know what's under this mystery because it holds the complete Secret Of Our Lives I think that's wonderful and our and our journey and our destination as I've been preaching on that God has a destination for us when he gives us the Holy Ghost it's taking us somewhere there's a journey with the Holy Ghost there's a destination with the Holy Ghost and so I'm tying this in with the Holy Ghost series to talk about MDC for one service because we realize there's something so important under the mystery of this man and he says Paul says that this great man he calls him a man consider this man let's Ponder let's let's pray about understanding this man and yet yet he was eternal because he had no beginning of days there was no history to him when Abraham met him it's like where are you from he didn't come from any place there was no Heritage from him and he afterwards there there was no there was no record of ancestors and there's no record of descendants and so he met Abraham and here they had a meeting and they sat down this was after Abraham come back from the Battle of of delivering his uh his relative and he come back with the spoils of the battle and come back after that and mzc met him uh and had a meal with him there after his battle and so this was a very very unique meeting uh if you're listening this morning this was a special meeting with Abraham and it was very important that God manifest himself this way and speak to his son Abraham and Abraham if you read the scripture he he uh paid tithes of all he he he he worshiped he rejoiced and he really realized this uh vessel that was in front of him was telling him that he was the uh inheritor of all things he was he was going to inherit all things he was a he was giving his position and showing that you may not think you have a lot you may not think that you have a a a Heritage or or something that you're going to have descendants but you are going to have descendant you're going to be blessed a matter of fact there'll be hundreds of children of Abraham that come from you so he's telling his future some somehow this vessel in front of him is connecting him with the Eternal thoughts of God to tell you your life is not just here you're not just living a temporary human life but he made a connection with a vessel that was telling him something Eternal about himself Abraham you didn't begin here you were in the thoughts of God there's something that you were in the thoughts of God and Abraham is sitting there hearing this and not only did he hear his thoughts of who he was but who he would be now when Jesus comes on the scene he makes a statement he says I come from God and I go back to God and so Jesus held something within him that though he stepped into this space of time for 33 and a half years he held a revelation of where he came from and he held the revelation of where he's going I'm going to go ahead and say it if God should connect you with the eternal thoughts of God and you should know that while you're on Earth it'll affect how you act it'll affect how you live you won't be so disappointed in life because you know you came from somewhere and you're going back to somewhere and that's where I believe becomes the maturity of sons that we conduct ourselves as sons that we're not tossed about by every window of Doctrine and back and forth and don't know whether I'm saved one day and going back to Camp every year and getting the Holy Ghost again no there's a stability when a revelation strikes your heart you connect to the Eternal that this is just the thing that I come and gave my heart to the Lord in an altar and now I'm just struggling to get along when God gives you a revelation who you are you stand sure I come from God and I go back to [Music] God glory be to God boy you're getting into it quick brother Paul yes I am amen because there's a mystery under here for our lives right and that's why we have such instability when a person doesn't make a connection with the Eternal like Abraham did with azdc this is all just a a struggling thing it's about just this life and the Commandments of God become carnal that it's a law and it's a rule praise the Lord so he met Abraham he had no record of ancestors or descendants met Abraham and then he was gone or so we think he was gone after that but if he was eternal he wasn't gone brother Braham said he's whoever it was there meeting with Abraham he's still alive this morning and he unveiled to us that it had to be Jesus Christ but in another form to Abraham because God can change his mask it can be all God standing there in front of you and his his mask is different God and morphe he can change his mask like a a person in a play can play three or four different parts he goes back behind backstage and he changes his clothes and he comes out and acts the part of the villain goes back changes his cloth he he act he acts out another part he have three or four parts if he's a real good actor but it's all the same person so God and morphe God God changing his mask and this was Jesus Christ and so but you see he has this eternal uh part to him and so as all Mysteries should be finished and settled at the end time aren't you thankful all Mysteries will be settled and finished at the end time under the seventh angel of Revelations 10:7 how many believe that this morning under the seventh angel of Revelations 10 107 The Mystery of God should be finished and all the things that have been lost if you're listening here this morning uh maybe on the Internet or through the broadcast it's a glorious day that we live in it's a a powerful day it's a glorious time when God would take truths that have been lost through church history and covered up by Creeds and dogmas God says in the last days by the seventh angel I will unveil all of that and give all my truths back to the people again and all Mysteries will be finished and we'll understand what has been lost and hiding to us throughout Generations this is the hour and guess what this mystery of MDC had to be settled during this time at the end time so Paul Paul needs to reveal some things about this MDC but you know what he says there's many things under this story in this mystery mzc that are needed but I can't I can't tell you all right now back 2,000 years ago I Can't Tell You Why why couldn't he tell them why couldn't he bring all that because of their immaturities chapter 6 and verse 11 in the Amplified version and if you guys want to put it up there you can but this is concerning this mil etica we have much to say about it's hard to explain since you have become dull and sluggish in your spiritual hearing and discipline to listen reason I'm bringing this up is I I've been talking about maturity and so he said I couldn't tell you all these things because of your immaturity he says for though by this time you ought to be teachers because of the time you have learned all these truth learned these uh uh simple truths you actually need to be someone to now you should be teachers but you actually need someone to teach you again the elementary principle principles of God's word from the beginning and you have come to be continually in need of milk and not solid food for everyone who lives on milk is doctrinally inexperienced and unskilled in the word of righteousness since he is a spiritual infant himself a preacher that's a spiritual infinite a teacher that's a spiritual infinite but solid food is for the spiritually mature whose senses are trained by practice to distinguish between what is morally good and what is evil chapter 7 said therefore let us give get past the elementary stage in the teachings about Christ advancing onto maturity and Perfection and spiritual completeness now remember when he says leaving these principles he doesn't say we're ditching them we're leaving them we're going away from them no that doesn't what he that's not what he means he says we're not staying there on just those things we're moving on to Perfection okay just like 1 Corinthians 13 might as well bring it up when Paul says when that which is perfect is come that which is in part is done away well you're talking about the gifts you're talking about everything no that didn't mean Paul said we do away with the gifts they always should be in the church but when we're moving to Perfection we're moving to a greater uh deeper Holy Spirit that's leading us for the gifts to operate and that's excellent that's an excellent way of perfect love so we don't leave those things we don't ditch the gifts we want all those gifts in the church how many wants the five gifts of the fful ministry in the church amen you know there's a spirit that's working around to try to eliminate the five-fold ministry we don't need those gifts anymore we just need to push play I think that's the spirit of the enemy that does that God gave five spiritual gifts to the church the fivefold ministry to the church and we shouldn't remove them from the church God gave nine spiritual gifts to the church we don't have a right to remove them but when he says leaving these things he says that there's a deeper level there's something to move on to without ditching these things we've got to move on to perfection to excellent the excellent way to perfect love amen so now I I like how the Amplified words this that's why I'm reading it he says therefore let us get past the elementary stage in the teachings about Christ advancing onto maturity and Perfection and spiritual completeness completeness doing this without laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward God of teaching about Washings uh baptism the laying on of the hands the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment these are all important matters in which you should have been proficient long ago and we will do this that is we will proceed to maturity if God permits so this is the problem God had some Revelations to bring to Sons about MDC but they wanted to stay babies and did not want to receive this or were not able to receive it they wanted to stay in the comfort blanket of the elementary principle Sons cannot remain babies spiritually the Holy Ghost won't let you do it you can keep stomping your foot like a two-year-old and wanting your own way and ignoring other parts of the word and acting like a baby and staying staying in the realm of your carnality and your favorite preachers and your gossip and you're saying anything giving yourself permission to say anything I've covered a lot of these things you can stay there all you want to but if you stay in the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost and you are a son it will not allow you to stay a baby he's going to put trials and allow trials in your life to cause you to grow up and be a man be a woman of God to be a man of God some of those trials that you get say I can't believe God's using this I failed miserably God will God will allow you to fail because you got too much pride maybe I had to stop here and preach this a minute it's amazing to me what God can order in a person's life when they have so much pride or they have so much of themselves it takes an extreme thing that God has to do to Humble you as a son that you learn to be obedient to God you learn to follow his word and he doesn't push us and make us uh uh override our will he just makes us willing to go amen because he loves us but you stand back and look at your journey and you look at your story and you're going I I never would have wanted a story like this I don't like my story it's Unique to myself this happened this person died this person fell away this husband left me this W wife left me I never wanted it that way it's embarrassing I can't believe this this is not the ideal this is not the perfect thing this wasn't the perfect marriage that I wanted this wasn't the perfect thing and God in those weaknesses and Imperfections if he gets anything out of it it'll be to train you as a son and daughter to get out of your babyhood and stand up and be a man or a woman in God I'm going to serve him no matter what took place in my life I don't care if I'm divorced or there's been losses in my life I'm going to stand as a mature daughter of God and a man of God and I'm going to let the devil know I'm not going anywhere I'm not going anywhere I stand for the message of the hour I stand for truth that's right let 10,000 Fall by my left 20,000 by my right it shall not come nigh to me by the grace of God I'm going to stand right here somebody ought to say praise the Lord that's where God wants to get you mature sons and so Sons cannot remain babies so if they want to get more solid uh then they have to come to this so you need to be open and mature to receive stronger Revelation and some of these things you will receive and it will stabilize you it'll bring you to more and more stability and maturity as Sons God has things to give you this morning that will burn the immaturities out of your life and make you more stable more mature God has Revelations to bring you God has trials to allow in your life but he also has Revelations and if you catch some of those things it changes everything it changes your perspective it changes how you look at yourself it changes how you look at other people changes how you look at pastors can you say Amen there's Revelations to mature you as well and we can't remain babies if we want to receive those Revelations we have to be willing to eat spiritual meat and I don't believe spiritual meat is just deep deep doctrinal things I believe it's things that God gives us for Sons to mature may not be a deep deep doctrinal Revelation because I've seen a lot of people they can really explain the deep deep Revelations and Dazzle us with how deep in their types they can go and I don't see any growth in character something's wrong with that picture I think if he takes you deep in the word he takes you deep in your life I think if you're a deep Christian doesn't mean you can intellectually explain all the seals I think if you're a deep Christian he's taking you deeper in the word he's taking you deeper in a sacrificial life deeper in a prayer life deeper in a dedication lost in the presence of God can you say Amen you're not wavered and so affected by life's human experience the first thing in our first scripture that we read he shows here there is a connection with the Son of God and all other Sons what Paul is bringing is that Jesus Christ didn't just die if you want to go back to chapter 2 we refer to this again our first scripture we read Hebrews chapter 2 he said he shows that there's a connection with the Son of God and all the other Sons what Paul is bringing is that Jesus Christ didn't just die for Sons of just die uh Jesus Christ did not just die for sons of God but he would bring many sons unto Glory with him so now if I was just preaching the basic principle I would just say that Jesus Christ died so that we can be saved and take all our sins away that's not what Hebrews is saying he died for our salvation but when it says he died and lived out a life of suffering that he could bring many sons to Glory the same Glory that he would come to that doesn't mean he died just to save you from your sins he died to bring you to maturity to come to the same Glory that he came to that's what the scripture is saying to bring many sons not just to save you but bring All Sons to Perfection to maturity to adoption in their Human Experience you at some point in your life experience this uh holy ghost coming and you w and when that Spirit comes that Spirit coming to you will lead you and guide you into all truth you will overcome things you will come to the same Glory as the first son did that's what the scriptures saying is that when he the spirit because the spirit of his son the spirit of his son his only begotten son he will come living an experience but that didn't end the story he came back again on the day of Pentecost and the SP Spirit of his son Christ this the the not a different Spirit his Spirit of his son trinitarian is not trinitarianism is not the truth can you say Amen because when Jesus said when you see me you see the Father the father was in him and when the day of Pentecost came it wasn't some other spirit that came on them by tongues of fire it was the spirit of his son that came in his people now friends I'll tell you I'll just stop right here here and say if he lived out 33 and A2 years and he healed the sick and he raised the dead and he he lived through the Temptations of the devil and he overcome every one of them the Bible says in Hebrews he was tempted in every Point as we are in every Point Jesus was tempted women and everything else if it's said every point he was tempted that you would be tempted he was tempted in every Point whatever you face tomorrow whatever you fac last week maybe maybe you failed I don't know but whatever you were tempted in he had to come and be tempted with the same thing and guess what we got a story because he overcame it all he's already overcome it and then he said because I have already overcome you will overcome as well now friends you just got to think about if it's the spirit the H the Holy Ghost if it's the spirit of his son living in me he's already over come the world he's already put the devil under his feet he's already overcome can you say am man he's already been there done that got the T-shirt hate to say it that way but he's lived this experience out and that same Spirit who overcome it came was born went through a journey went to Calvary died resurrected the third day that spirit is living in me this morning what's that do it gives me confidence wow The Same Spirit that's already overcome everything is living in you what could the devil bring tomorrow what could he stir up against you whether it's through your the economy the the the your finances uh what bill could come that you didn't expect what family drama could be going on that could ever be bigger than God's spirit being in you to overcome it God hallelujah I can live confident not proudful but confident that's the kind of spirit that's living it's his Spirit of his son and will the spirit of his son bring many sons to Glory yeah he'll bring him to Glory because God didn't just have one son in my in mind but he had he predestinated a world of Sons and Daughters of God and they were all in his mind be before the foundation of the world God had his in his mind a family God had his mind he predestinated a word of sons and daughters not just one son we we hear of his only begotten son but in your scriptures brother and sister and those who are listening there's too many references to Sons Sons God predestinated a world of sons and daughters not just the only begotten son not just the first son who came we can't just preach about him but we can preach about the power of him living in the rest of his sons they were in his mind as well you were in his mind as well how many you believe this morning you were in his mind just as much as Jesus Christ was in his mind all of his sons were in his mind before the foundation of the world so they were all come to not just a birth in Christ but the glory and the power in them like Adam had in the beginning before the fall like Christ had like Adam had they are partaking of the same power and glory in their lives because why they were a son in God's mind before the foundation of the world how does he do all this they all are included in his perfect son partaking of this testing and suffering in his life now we go back to Hebrews 2:10 and read it in the Amplified hope not hopefully you're not off ended by that I screen through these interpretations and these different Bible translations because sometimes they don't get it right sometimes I like the Amplified if they if they get it right and they just bring it out just a different way but it's the same theme uh you know brother Harold hillbrand used to call it the perversion version so we have to be careful of those things but he says in Hebrews 210 for it was fitting for God that is an act worthy of his divine nature that he for whose sake are all things and through him are all things in bringing many sons to Glory should make the author and the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering bringing to maturity The Human Experience necessary for him to be perfectly equipped for his office as high priest now God's taken him to be a high priest for all the other people for the next 2,000 years he's going to set them at the right hand of authority as as a high priest that when we go pray he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities did you ever think of if you went to prayer about a certain need in your life in this Human Experience that you prayed to a Christ who didn't know what you're talking about to a God who didn't know what you're talking about friends when you go and express things to him he knows cuz he's been here he's lived it out and when you pray whatever it is you think you got a new thing you there's nothing new to God Christ has been through it he knows how to overcome it and you pray God hears your prayer and the says that high priest is touched by the feeling of our infirmities and I like this last statement to bring to maturity The Human Experience necessary Christ to to have a human experience but to bring it to maturity through Human Experience necessary for him to perfectly be equipped for the office of high priest so Christ himself even though we look at him as perfect he had to experience things so he could be a faithful high priest so he could could come and be that high priest so in other words there's a position waiting there's a position he's coming to he had to come and experience what you experience in order to get that position of high priest how many know that Revelations 5 says after the seal come into the hand the book come into the hand of Christ it says they worship he hath made us Kings and Priests we're going somewhere we're being molded for the Millennium we're being molded to rule and reign with Christ and the human experience must be used for us to come to maturity in order to rule and reign with Christ can't stay babies there it is Christ it was a journey bringing him to be a priest molding him to be something coming to maturity in The Human Experience the journey was to come to maturity in The Human Experience if I can express that to you you're here not for a job not to make a lot of money money and if you do praise the Lord if you don't praise the Lord cuz you're not here just to just to squeeze out this Human Experience to see how much money you can make do I need to say more you're not here just to get married and you know enjoy all the things of life and the material things of life and you're not here just for that if a young person could catch you're not here just to get married that's important and if God has a plan for you praise the Lord I'm sure he does find that plan find the will of God but always remember you're not here just to get married you're not here just to have jobs God has put you here for a reason young girl God's put you here for a purpose young man God's put you on this Earth in this journey and you might have 15 years or you might have 50 years or you may have a 100 years but God chooses that your days may be over at 20 years old you could leave here and your days be finished but one thing for sure he put you on this Earth for a purpose and that's to mold in you what is needed as a son and daughter of God time to get up on the potter's wheel and say Lord here I am I'm Yours how long you going to wait well I'll do it someday when I'm not a teenager no more I'll give my life to God when I'm older why wait why not now say Lord I'm Yours who's telling you to wait say well I got a few things I want to enjoy and this message will restrain me from enjoying them yeah but talk to about 70 other people in this congregation and they'll tell you that's a big [Music] lie that's the biggest lie one of the biggest lies got some things to enjoy and I can't do it without the restraints of the message being over me I need to go enjoy some things first that's a lie you never enjoy life until Christ is the core of who you are there is no possession there is no relationship with a guy or girl there is nothing that trumps the relationship with Jesus Christ if you had it all and didn't have that you're missing everything if a man gain the whole world and lose his soul sons are coming here to be perfected and molded just like Jesus was to come to his kingship to come to his priesthood and so other Sons would know he did it and they would do it by the same power leading them we have to get into what he knew while he was in his experience so this is what I want to get into now what did Christ know when he got into his experience on Earth that set him towards the perfect will of God instead of his own will because he struggled with his own will in The Human Experience he had his own will there and he struggled all the way up to the end he struggled oh if it be possible possible let this cup pass from me and that was his will saying is there any way to get around this Calvary is there any way to get around this type of sacrifice he's struggling with it there great great blood drops of Tears blood drops coming down earnestly in the garden there's a struggle until the struggle was won the battle was won nevertheless Lord not my will but thine be done and at that moment the battle was one can you say Amen it wasn't just Calvary brother Brown says the battle is actually one in the garden he said the battle was one in the garden on his knees at an altar the battle was won because his will was overcome said I submit myself to the will of God whatever happens from here on out I'm going to walk in the scriptures of what he said and every place we have especially the ends of Jesus life that the scriptures might be fulfilled that the scriptures might be fulfilled if anybody doesn't have that goal then you got a wrong goal that the scriptures be fulfilled in my life think not that I can call 10,000 Legions of Angel right now as Peter grabbed his sword and everybody's a will def Peter you know he just he must have just started in his immaturity just swinging the sword at everybody you know I don't know if he was a fisherman so he probably wasn't trained and he just slung around anybody taking the sword which we're not supposed to use the sword of the word to do that slices off the ear of one of the soldiers Peter as I said to you a couple weeks ago Peter you don't even know what Spirit you're of the son of man didn't come to destroy lives but to save lives put your sword away for those who live by the sword die by the sword that's not the kind of battle we're in he's swinging Jesus reaches up and puts that back on and he said but here they're all in there and they didn't understand what was going on and he said Peter don't you think that I could call 12 Legions of angels right now and deliver me out of all this imagine a Son of God and he knows his power but look at the submission but that the scriptures might be fulfilled he had a choice there to use his power as a Son of God to bring 12 Legions of angels and deliver them out of that but then the scriptures wouldn't be fulfilled every obedient son is obedient is that what does the word say about my life in this human journey and every bit of it I want it to be fulfilled in my life if it brings hurt if it brings suffering if it brings losses whatever it is that the scriptures might be fulfilled in my life I mean raise your hand and say that's that's what I want and so this is how Jesus was and so so now what what made him uh what made him so have this confidence uh within him we have to get to that and know that in his experience he could set his will towards God instead of his own will before the G beginning let me just explain it this way before the beginning in in uh Genesis 1:1 you know what it says you were taught in Sunday School in the beginning God so the that's the only first thing we have is the beginning so in the beginning God God and he's an object of worship there was no family yet there wasn't anything it was just God an object of worship but before the beginning then it was there was no beginning it was just Eternal and God dwelt eternally there with just him and his thoughts even before Angels were created and so it was God and God is a spirit and so there he was with his thoughts with his attributes and then God wanted to to descend and begin coming down to man God wanted to begin in descension actually God wanted to be able to express himself in his family in different attributes that he had within himself and so he begins this condescension he begins this descending and uh Prophet said his first being was Spirit God Supernatural all right the great Eternal and second so that's the great Eternal that's the supernatural God in spirit but second he begin to form himself towards flesh so he's on a journey to condescend to form himself towards flesh the second thing is that he begin to form himself towards flesh in a theophonic the word but it's a body it's a theophonic body Christ I'm teaching Sons this morning in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God because remember he had God the Eternal Spirit there was no form of him right now he forms himself into the body called the word and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so you can't make two out of that so somehow in his mystery he could begin to form himself down to the human exper to Human by uh changing his mask and coming into a thing called the theophany which is called the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God read a little further in chapter four verse 14 of John 1 then we have the next phase and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so the whole journey there Jesus goes through that as he's condescending and coming down to his Human Experience condescending coming from thought to word the person perfect theophany body a visible manifestation to humankind of God that's what a theophany means if you look it up in the dictionary theophany means a visible manifestation to the to humankind of God a visible manifestation because God as a spirit we couldn't have any visible manifestation we couldn't understand we couldn't see he forms himself in some form form of a visible manifestation a theophany body and this is what he had come to Abraham in in a body but it was that theophany body in a body and now he's meeting with Abraham he's he's he's transort transporting himself into this meeting with Abraham this word is really what we could call John one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God then the word was made flesh in other words he stepped out of Eternity into time when he became flesh he stepped out of that theophany that Eternal Body and he stepped into time that's when he became flesh he stepped out of etern Eternity into time now I ask you that question why did christ have to do that frankly in a nutshell why do you have to come all the way down to human beings and come into time why did he have to do it frankly we messed up like I said a few weeks ago you're all a piece of work and when Adam and Eve messed up you messed up too you're messed up you're all messed up and I'm really messed up and so we we we see then that he had to we were messed up if all of his sons of God are in his mind and that's a that can choke somebody that doesn't know the word that's that's real meat to accept the fact I don't know why it's hard to accept though that I was in God's mind I was in his lineage I was a seed of God in God's Mind by representation why it's hard because all of my sons this morning my two sons all of my sons two of them and my children were in me and they took the betting ground of marriage to bring them the past that's why they reflect the image they start to look like me they start to act like me they don't want to but they start acting like me they start have characteristics of me and that's the proof that's the proof okay that they weren't just some random no no they come from my genes my and some of my characteristics will be in them if that's true in the natural it's true in the spiritual I don't know why that's hard to admit that if we are Sons we had to be like Jesus Christ in the mind of the father if I'm going to be anything as as a Christian it'll not be because I'm trying to make myself better it'll be because I was in God's mind as a son amen so all the inheritance of the son comes with me and is given to me not because I deserved it but because I was in his mind and he will not lose one of them that was in his mind somebody ought to shout and say praise the Lord this morning Hallelujah so a visible so I got to move on here because you see why do you have to do that why did you come to it's because we messed up and if all the sons of God were in his mind then all would have to be manifested right if Christ was manifested his son all his sons would eventually have to be manifested someday they'd have to come the difference in us in Christ is that we skipped from God's thoughts we skipped our theophany body and we skipped that part and we came straight to the Human Experience we bypassed our theophonic Human Experience Jesus did not skip that Jesus did not bypass that Jesus came from the Son of God the thought of God an attribute of God to his theophany body and then to The Human Experience and that's why he knew all things that's why he stood with confidence and knew his place in the word and had perfect Faith because he had this uh Mind Of God that was flowing through him he knew where he came from now if Sons could catch that they would act different on Earth I mean it's called the Paul says let me just go off here a minute Paul says we receive the mind of Christ now friends if through this Holy Ghost we receive the mind of Christ in our soul and that's all that God has for you and all God thought of you and that's resident within you then and it starts to affect you by Revelation then you're going to start recalling how many is getting older and has a bad memory only me okay fine but I have to meet with my mom and my mom tells me stories of when I I could forget all my childhood all of it and she has to tell me and when she starts talking it triggers my memory oh yes and it's wonderful I love for her to do it because I hate forg getting things that were good I hate forgetting good good memories and it triggers it and brings it back it's almost like us spiritually when we're not born again we don't know who we are we're out there in the world we're serving the world dressing like the world acting like the world smoking like the world drinking like the world committing adultery like the world and all of a sudden now God touches your life and you come in contact with something Eternal and you begin to recognize wait a minute I'm acting like the world but I'm not really the world I'm starting starting to recall from the mind of Christ that I'm an attribute I'm a glory be to God I'm a quality I'm a characteristic I'm one of God's qualities glory be to God if you this week could look at yourself what's an attribute it's a quality or characteristic of someone else can you say amen and you could have that memory started and as we stay in the word and stay under the message in this open book of redemption the sons of God are learning who they really are when the prophet says I'm an attribute of God you start to see okay I know what that means I'm one of God's qualities the devil's told you you're dirt you're dirt you're dirt all your whole life you're dirt you're living it out and you're living from the experience of dirt and you he's told you that your whole life and he still tries to tell you that but when are Sons and Daughters of God got to rise up and say no I'm actually one of the qualities of God because God has no bad attributes he has no bad characteristics like us we have bad characteristics right are we going to at least say Amen to that this morning we're born with them we got traits of the family we got traits of we got spirits that you know we got it we have bad characteristics some we need to die to but God has none and so I can say ly say I'm one of God's qualities how can I word it I'm one of God's quality characteristics because he doesn't have any others when sons of God catch that that's a pretty powerful Life to Live amen praise the Lord oh glory be to God I'm excited about the word this morning I forgot my thoughts so I have to go back up here and figure out where I'm at oh I know what it was was um you know sons of God are starting to recall it's all coming back to them you know Sherry has a song It's All Coming Back to Me Now where were you job when I laid the foundation of the Earth where the sons of God shouted for Joy that's why when somebody shouts when somebody dances the aisles you know they're just expressing their original state don't get offended at that if you start to recognize this and get happy about it from the foundation of the world the sons of God are shouting for Joy but they connect with that memory and it comes back to them it's kind of like it's a little bit like deja vu anybody ever have Deja Vu and they don't know what that is till yet but we know what it is because sometimes and I used to have my friend brother Mark Johnson he'd be standing about four or five brothers and we'd be talking he'd be talking to us and then he would say he would just say stop everybody stop right here just a minute don't nobody move he said I've seen this before I've said I've I've said these things before that's deja vu something's coming back and they can't describe it but if that can happen that way how many's ever had Deja Vu happen it's like this spiritual Dayja Vu is saying I'm starting to recognize what I was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world it's coming back to me now and as it comes back you live every day by the mind of Christ that I am a quality of him in my father I'm one of the attributes or qualities of God I'm not what the devil says about me my mistakes are underneath the blood of Jesus Christ can I get an amen I can't get enough amens this morning my mistakes are all under the blood of Jesus Christ and I'm only seen by the father as a quality attribute that was in him my it all starts to come back to Sons when they connect with something Eternal this morning if you don't connect with that you're going to look at life carnal you're going to look at the word as carnal Commandments you're you're going to look at this as law you're going to you're going to see it completely different but if you have a meeting like Abraham had with mzc Jesus Christ he's going to connect you with the Eternal thoughts of God the difference in us in Christ we skipped our from thought life to straight to the Human Experience we never were in in our word Eternal Body because of sin we messed up we bypassed our theophany but guess what we have a theophany body Jesus had a theophany body we have a theophany body I don't know if anybody's don't know it but you you if you're a Christian you have the Holy Ghost the very reason you have the Holy Ghost is you heard from your theophany there's like an ellic cord from your soul to your word body it's a perfect body it doesn't get sick it doesn't get headaches it doesn't get depressed it doesn't have have any mind battles it never struggles with the word it says Amen to every word of God because it's a word body and that's what you heard from when you received the Holy Ghost it wasn't just I came to the Altar and you know I gave my heart to God that's fine that's wonderful but this is deeper than just giving your heart to God this is connecting with your theophany body when you recognize the eagle food for this hour you have heard from your theophany body you have connected with something Eternal and that's why when we begin to recognize that nothing that happens in this Human Experience can ever jeopardize the destination that I'm going to you see why the Holy Ghost is tied to this mzc it's very much tied to it and now God says I have to condescend further down now I have to come a little bit lower than the Angels God says it because it was God that was coming to us it was our kinsman redeemer he was coming down and coming to our level he had to come to to our level because of sin we sin so now he's condescending as Hebrews says Paul says in Hebrews a little lower than the Angels into time itself in a couple weeks we'll celebrate the time of the birth of Christ he comes down and he doesn't begin as an adult he begins as a baby because that's how we begin can I get an amen he lives out The Human Experience just as we do a baby adolescent teenager all of that he lives it out and he comes into the space of time why is he doing that why does he come to The Human Experience why did my Lord Jesus Christ have to become like me because I couldn't be redeemed unless he did I'm lost and this morning without Christ you are lost headed for a dying hell it's Jesus Christ that offers you life and eternal life but you have to accept C it you have to receive it well I'm an exception to the rules you're not an exception to the rules he is the way the truth and the life he is the connection to the Eternal there is no finding God in relationship without Jesus Christ the word and so he my sons are stuck in sin and Humanity I'm having such a good time this morning that I'm going to stay with it for a little while here and because I had three amens I'm going to do it so God says because my sons some of my sons are stuck in sin and Humanity they're stuck there they can't get out headed for a Hell Without Me they are lost I will go into time and put myself into The Human Experience and I will save them but I also will teach them how to overcome I'll give them my spirit so it can it started with him coming here overcoming himself and then putting his Spirit within them they will be redeemed they will have experience full Redemption they will come out of the muck and myy Clay they will come out of the worst possible situations they will be prostitutes sometimes they will be alcoholics sometimes they will have all kinds of dysfunctional family life of sexual abuse they will come through situations that are so you don't even have situations a hundred years ago like you have today they will come in Satan's e with all kinds of trash and dirtiness in their minds from pornography they will be in the worst case but my Redemption power will come to my sons and I will raise them out of it and they will be Overcomers praise the Lord they'll come under the power of redemption you see this Redemption is not just a sermon that you preach at your church on Sunday morning this is a power of redemption and when you come under that power it goes in One Direction it raises you up out of your sin out of your myy clay out of your habits out of your addictions and out of your contention and out of your gossip and out of your resentment and out of your doubts about everything I'll raise them up Jesus steps into time for 33 years on planet Earth and lives by Perfect Faith he deceits the enemy he's tempting every Point like we are why he's bringing many sons to Glory too his other Sons he did it he's not ashamed to call them Brethren did you know Hebrews said that next in the scripture I'm not ashamed to call them my brethren now I know we don't think of Jesus as our brother but Jesus referred to you I went for you because these are my brother and these are my family and he's not ashamed to call them this is my brother how many's ever had how many's ever had to stand unashamed with your brother or your sister or for family sometimes we have to stand for them when nobody else will stand for them Jesus stands where stands up for his Brethren Jesus died for his Brethren Jesus died Jesus lived an overcoming life for his Brethren Jesus went to glory to bring the rest of his Brethren I tell you that's an unselfish act I'm not just going to Glory myself I'm bringing All My Sons and Daughters to Glory somebody ought to shout amen I'm bringing all of them to Glory I'm bringing them they're coming they'll come hard they'll come easy but they're all going to come cuz all the father has given me All My Sons will come to me glory be to God hallelujah so now they get a revelation that I have a word body and the spirit the tutor will come and Lead Me and guide me into into all truth one big one is that is I've got a theophany one great truth of all the truths the Holy Ghost will teach you is I have a theophany the seven seal was revealed to show we have a theophany the Seven Seals were revealed to show we have a theophany the reason I'm responding to him and want to overcome is because I'm a predestinated Son of God just like Jesus his spirit is in me leading me back to Eternity he came into Human Experience to be perfected and to be matured and I can get excited about the journey that I'm in this Human Experience I can worship like I'm already there I can live like I'm already there because it's just as good as done in the mind of God can you sayen I can live every day as if I I can worship in church as if I'm already there some of you people need to Worship the Lord with all your heart as if you're already there cuz it's in the bag but I've been put under this tutor did you know that the Holy Ghost is called a tutor brother R called a tutor to lead you and guide you as a matter of fact let me blow your mind and say he says the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is only just a temporal gift for you the real gift is that soul that lays down there see I I thought it would be quiet I don't understand all of it either that all I know is that he gave the spirit of a tutor to lead you in your human Journey until he leads you into all truth and you come to your theophany body the real gift is your soul you were part of God before the foundation of the world so he gives this paraclete in the Greek holy ghost is perite it's I'm sticking with this this is good 12:41 I got lots of time here so holy ghost means paracite or paricus in the Christian biblical term occurring five times in the text of the New Testament in this paracite in Christian theology the word commonly refers to the Holy Spirit and is translated an advocate or a counselor or a helper or pericet one who goes goes alongside to help now we know that it's living within us and we know that it's Christ but it's also known as a tutor because if you have babies you have to have a tutor you better you have to have a mommy if you're left to yourself as a baby no telling what'll happen to you God puts you under tutors God you put you under mommy then you go to school and you under teachers some teachers are good some teachers are bad but they're all teachers you're put under then you come under your dad and then you come under your because in The Human Experience if we didn't have teachers we would be a mess so in the spiritual experience the Holy Ghost is this parac one who goes alongside to help us through this human journey and leads us and guides us into all truth when you don't know something the soul registers by Revelation gets a revelation there's another truth there's another truth I'm always saying what's next Lord because I've already been on this journey I love one main thing in this life and that's the revelation of this word that's why I read it in the morning that's why I come to church I don't come to church just to see you I come because I might get another Revelation I come because I love to come I love the family of God I love his presence I love to connect with my theophany I love to hear from my theophany I've got a word body and I love to hear from it body what do you have to say to me today but one day we'll cut the umbilical cord like a baby and we'll go into that new body some of you in the broadcast you say where in the world getting that I'm going to quach the scripture if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one waiting Eternal aonian Eternal Eternal no beginning of days nor ending of life no C that we have a body waiting for us sons have a body waiting for them aonian in the heavens it's a truth in the Bible you can't deny it so you weren't really saved one night at an altar if you're a real Son of God in his mind you were saved before the foundation of the world this tutor comes along and he teaches you things and he shows you and and Sons will make mistakes and he says son you you know the T says oh Prophet even elaborates about reporting back to the father and you know she's wearing short dresses and she's doing all this stuff and oh I have to bring a bad report I don't want him to bring a bad report to the father but I want to say I want to have that testimony he's really getting into the word he's really standing with the word he's acting like a mature son I put him through all kinds of Trials and he's standing there unmovable that's the report I want to get he's growing he's maturing and the tutor is just Distributing these things to to all of us by the Holy Ghost here's what you need next that's why I've been preaching in the Holy Ghost Series this is not a one night Affair this is a journey this mystery of mcedc is the mystery to pred predestination and it's a mystery how can we not preach predestination to Sons how can we not preach it to Sons they catch that truth of it can it go off the deep end where you get lazy and oh just whatever no no no I don't want it to do that you have to preach predestination to Sons so they can catch what they are by eternity and that will affect their future I came from God I'm headed back to God teacher a par Le one who goes along sides but he said that will be just a temporal gift for your Human Experience God loved you so much that he would give you the Holy Ghost for this Human Experience to lead and guide you into all truth to make sure that you go into all truth to make sure that you make a Rapture he ensures my sons will need my guidance and my teaching my Revelation while they're in that Human Experience I'll go with them I'll leave them my spirit and it will lead them into all truth until they make the Rapture and they walk into their new body next Sunday we'll finish this series on the Holy Ghost by talking about our new bodies and talking about this Earnest of the Resurrection is just an Earnest it's a down payment that we're going all the way it's just temporary for human time M the mystery of mzc is in a nutshell he was there all the time Jesus was there all the time he was in mzc with Abraham he's there all the time but he stepped into time if that's true if that's the mystery of mzc then can we say that as well I've been here all the time I just stepped into this Human Experience and when I'm done I will step out of it back into eternity I got stuck in time how many feel like you're stuck in time I'm just stuck here but friends you're not stuck here God's going to get you out God's getting you out out God's giv you the key to get out of here can you say Amen brother Bram says and who is this mzc so many things we can read in that but if you bring that quote up now we see the attributes the sons of his Spirit the sons look notice how that words the attributes the sons of his Spirit have not yet entered into the word formed body but a theophany the subject the body is subject to the word in Earnest waiting for the earnest the change of the body so the earnest is the down payment it's waiting for the change of the body now the difference between him and you Christ and you as a son you see he was at the beginning of the word and in morphe body he came in and lived in that in the person of mzc you want me to change it but go back but okay I think I got lost hold on I'll do it then later we never heard no more of mzc because he became Jesus Christ mzc was the priest but he became Jesus Christ now you bypass that you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet you come like Adam like me you become from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted but when this life is finished here if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting that's where we go that is the word then we can look back and see what we done now we don't understand it we have never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word but and look clearly it makes it clear you will never be the word unless you was that thought at the beginning that proves the predestination of God you see you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking first but you see in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass the theophonic to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all the father ha given me will come to me and I'll raise him up at the last day see you had to be first and then you see he come right down the regular line Jesus come the regular line you came The Irregular line oh I wish I would have come the other way well you didn't you're here but his Redemption is going to get you back in line the regular line was come before the foundation of the world his name was on the B go life then from that he became the word the theophany that could appear disappear and then he become flesh and return back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you bypass the Theology and become flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if this Earthly Tabo be dissolved we have one waiting we have not yet the bodies but look look at this look at this look at this Ellie when this body receives the spirit of God the mortal life inside of you it throws this body in subjection to God hallelujah I've been preaching on the Holy Ghost this is the evidence of the Holy Ghost something has happened in you that's Eternal has come in you eternal life and it throws this body into subjection to God you couldn't do that through psychology you couldn't do that in a church system of just denomination it takes the Holy Ghost to do that guess what it does it throws this body did you ever think this is a sborn body it will always be a sinb born body you think of the miracle of God throwing a sinb born body under subjection to the word when it doesn't even want the word your mind don't want the word your flesh don't want the word it don't want to line up with the word why doesn't it well you don't have your word body yet these bodies are born in sin doesn't inherit the kingdom of God think about the miracle now though that he says when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside you it throws this body in subjection to God hallelujah he that's born look look at the scriptures he's using now now we understand these scriptures he that's born of God does not commit sin he cannot sin now that does that mean sinless perfection in the flesh it doesn't mean that if it meant that we're all failures we'll never make it in because we live in a sborn body we think wrong thoughts sometimes we do wrong things we have to ask forgiveness that's what we have the blood for but we want to grow as sons that we're doing less and less to disle God and more and more to please him less and less of the mistakes can you say amen and never justifying a mistake oh I fell to that the other day and I asked God to forgive me and I went back to it again there's got to be a power of the Holy Ghost sometime in your life that you overcome that thing come on now we water down the Holy Ghost way too much but we don't water down the Holy Ghost it has power to cause you to overcome it has power to take over these Minds to take over these bodies and bring a body that doesn't want to serve the God doesn't want to come to church it didn't want to come to church this morning you might as well raise your hand and admit it your body didn't want to come to church you're too tired Wednesday nights you don't want to come to church and so this body so the Holy Ghost picks up as I said picks this body up that doesn't want to go to church and says you are going to church because something in the soul Rises up and says I need something from God glory be to God all right so he this born of God did not commit sin he cannot sin why we're looking at from the perspective of Eternity right Romans 81 there's therefore no here's another scripture there's therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus they walk not after the flesh but after the spirit they are there there you are see that throws your body subject you don't have to say oh if I could just quit drinking if I could just just get in Christ and it's all gone because your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead let me hear an amen don't water down the Holy Ghost you keep getting under this power of redemption it'll overcome everything they are dead your sins are buried in baptism you are a new creature in Christ and your body becoming subject to the Spirit try to live a a right kind of life like you women claiming you got the Holy Ghost and going out here wearing shorts and things how could you do it how could the spirit of God in you ever let you do such a thing as that it just can't be so certainly it can't be he's not a filthy Spirit he's a Holy Spirit and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but this seed word made manifest or quickened Hallelujah Made Alive and when the Bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there is no question amen amen but I'm not done yet when there is a connection with Christ to the Eternal when this MDC meets you you connect with the Eternal there is a power in it for Sons to live this life you're tapping into God's mind can you say Amen the mind of Christ and you begin to live from that or want to live from that every day functioned by the Inner Man by the mind of Christ what's he thinking today what's his thoughts of me instead of my own you know the prophet was in a service like this sometimes and do you know that the Holy Spirit would allow him to catch the thoughts of people only a prophet I don't know what you're thinking this morning I know the spirit does and that's why I'll preach on things and people come up and say were you at our house last night were you behind the corner were you listening to us because everything we talked about you said the Holy Ghost knows what you said he a discerner of the thoughts and intents you can't hide anything from him but a prophet has a unique gift where he's looking he says now he said I I've somebody just thought that this is mental telepathy I caught that thought I caught that thought when you thought that amazing amazing but listen if God can catch our thoughts then why don't we catch God's thoughts why don't we say Lord let me catch your thoughts this morning Hallelujah let the Holy Ghost allow me to just catch his thought tomorrow morning when I get up and face my day Lord let me catch your thought for today who do you want me to witness to today how do you want me to live today let me catch your thoughts when Sons connect to this they mature into finding themselves in the mind of God I was in his thoughts from the beginning they're not tossed about in and out living up and down getting the Holy Ghost every Revival not clinging to Elementary principles for a comfort blanket to live in the past they're growing into further revelation of who they are walking in it every day not snag by temporary things you see now friends if you don't get anything else when you connect with the Eternal you're not as snagged by temporary things that's happening in this Human Experience I've got to do this I've got to do that I I'm I'm worried about my finances I'm worried I won't have a retirement you're caught in the temporal but when you connect with the Eternal there's a rest there's a peace in the Holy Ghost God will provide for me and my destination is in his hands when you find the Eternal element it affects sons of God to act mature instead of nervous and I got to do something for my retirement you know what you can do for your retirement pray that your kids get the Holy Ghost so they go on serving the lord when you're gone you know what you can do for your retirement go ahead and invest my wife and I do it but I'm not worried because you know your your retirement money in overnight can be completely gone by this economy you could work your whole life and it be complete you have no rest in those things you have no rest in your business but I can preach to you a rest this morning in the Holy Ghost that's the Eternal rest glory be to God it's an eternal rest I am stable I'm not tossed by temporary things that's going on some temporary things I could tell you some this morning see then I'd be sharing the negative I've been criticized more than I ever have not from this congregation but people talking he say I'm not even never mind if I didn't connect to the Eternal I'd be I'd be out of this thing just out of it after 35 years you have to hear you know you're not even preaching the message anymore listen if I was caught in temporary I would be worried about that but when I was 16 years old I tapped into the Eternal and somebody's temporal opinion of me which is a Lie by the way does not affect me I'm a human being and I say it affects my spirit sometimes but it doesn't affect my soul it doesn't say I'm throwing in the towel I'm finished with the I'm finished with all these people you know brother Brandon wanted to do that I'm finished he lost the feeling for the people Moses wanted that I'm finished I'm Lord just destroy all of them I'm sick of all of them that's right that's right that's carnal that's looking at temporary people and what they're saying and gossiping about but your heart has to be connected with something Eternal because guess what Hebrews says Brothers here we have no continuing City what's the message I listen to this week he's going oh that that's the title here we have no con City and he goes through his life story and he says I lost my dad he names four or five people lost my dad lost my two brothers lost lost my wife lost my daughter all within a certain amount of time he talked about when he was a little boy and he was sitting his dad was a drunker his dad was an alcoholic he said but I love my dad I love my dad and he said I would give a million dollars all I all the money if I could just sit across the table from him at 5 years old and just be across and see my daddy's face he said I give anything but he said here we have no continuing City we can't go back people change people go up and down we go life goes up and down here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come that's Eternal your children are going to go astray sometimes your there going to be things ups and downs why did they do that why did my kid do that why did my wife do that why did my husband do that life is not certain life will change almost on a daily basis and you just need to say here we have nothing that's stable or continuing you might have everything your ducks in a row and it changeed in a moment's time but we do have an eternal weight of Glory we have an eternal consistency and we're looking for a city whose Builder and maker is God not snagged by things Eternal you guys don't have this quote in the back a man ought to be able to say I read this quote years ago and I was going to read it again a man ought to be able to say when you meet a man is is your a Christian experiences when was it the dearest to you your Christian experience when was it dearest to you you ought to be able to say right now well my best experience was back when I first got the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I come first come then say Oh Brother you have fallen from Grace that's right you've left your first love showing that they had something in the beginning that they left it not not he that Beth but he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved not he all that saith Lord Lord not all that say Lord Lord will come in oh let me just let that soak in just a minute I was talking fast tonight anyhow so let us let that soak in a minute he that doeth the will of my father he that endureth to the end he that endureth if somebody say I believe he that that guy over there he's an old hypocrite well if you think that about me I'll just leave church I won't have any more to do with it all right there you are it shows What You're Made Of so somebody called him a hypocrite say I'll just leave that church I'll go somewhere else immaturity brother if it was a wheat to begin with it'll be a wheat at the end you just never stayed long enough down here you never make the thing right that's right remember therefore from when I Fallen go back and remember when you used to have the experience where you wouldn't talk about nobody you used to have the experience you wouldn't talk no about anybody anything went wrong in the church you didn't sit on your neighbor's steps over there and talk about the church I'm correcting some things from this quote when you had a real true experience with God anything that went wrong in the church you didn't sit at the neighbor step over there and talk about the church and talk about everybody else and fly loose and go join another church no you stayed right there patiently and prayed it out and God brought it on through when was your experience dearest to you oh it was back when I first got the Holy Ghost he says you've fallen for Grace you ought to be able to say right now is my closest experience with God because this is a journey this is It's be what I got back then has only become more real now brings confidence it brings rest that he had millions of attributes in his mind and I'm one of those attributes one of those qualities one of those features an inherent characteristic of God and I'm one of God's qualities I'll tell you that brings confidence it brings Assurance it brings rest in the Holy Ghost can you say amen and in who mzed again he says and that's the way with a Christian Hallelujah we know musicians can come as long as everybody listens to me now and that's away with a Christian Hallelujah we know when we walk into the presence of God something in US tells us that we come from somewhere and we're going back by that power that's pulling us when we come into the presence of God something tell us tells us that we came from somewhere and this thing is pulling us back to where we belong there's a power that goes with this Hebrews 7 7 15 can you guys put that up he refers to mzc again in this spot and Mark this down or in in your head remember to read this Hebrews 7:15 and it is yet far more evident that after the similitude of mzc there ariseth another priest who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life when you connect with the revelation of mezc you connect with the with an endless life eternal life and guess what it has a power with it it's not just a religion not something I don't know if I'm in today I I have a bunch of no no no it's an endless life because you've tapped into a power of an endless life that's the mystery of mzc brother BR goes on to say when we come into the presence of God we know that we are come from somewhere where and we're going back again by that power that's pulling us that little Dew Drop he glistens and shines and shouts how many's ever seen a DW drop in the morning on a blade of grass millions of them that little d drop he glistens and shines and shouts because he knows he come from up there and the Sun is going to draw him right back up again you're your story is written in nature

reflecting us that he's there and he's he said and and and a man that's an attribute of God born of God knows Hallelujah when he come into contact with the Son of God he's going to be draw brought up
