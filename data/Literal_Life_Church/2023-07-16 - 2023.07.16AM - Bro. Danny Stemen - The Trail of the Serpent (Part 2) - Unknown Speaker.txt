========================================

you this morning certainly wonderful to be here and it's such a privilege to be with you brother Paul thank you for your hospitality and the love you've shown us and I mean just really nice to reconnect with so many people that we've known through the years and so we just want to say God bless you and we love you with the love of the Lord and amen just appreciate this opportunity to come together amen because we have one thing in common we come from all walks of life and we may not even amen another past life wouldn't even like each other amen but what we have in common draws us together and that's that's and that's the goal of the Gospel is the you until we all come the body of Christ amen not every church but the body the body of Christ come in unity of his faith amen and that's what he's at work doing and so amen it's only he that can do that so God bless you this morning let's just bow our heads for a word of prayer our heavenly father what a privilege it is to Stand Here Lord to minister the word Lord we just pray that you would get me out of the way I do not want to project my own thinking or thought for that would not help the people but Lord we want to glorify your name and lift you up Lord and Lord bring the word let me be planted in your in the people's hearts father and may you have complete control and preeminence if there would be anything Lord any hindering thought or Spirit may it be bound Lord in the name of Jesus Christ father for Lord where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty father now I pray Lord that you'd have your way we love you father in Jesus name amen amen God bless you if you turn in your Bibles to the Book of Revelations the 12th chapter last night I I was speaking on the trail of The Serpent and I'm kind of at a at uh it's kind of difficult at times as as a minister when you travel out because at home you can just spend brother Brandon you can just spend as many services you want preaching on a subject and then amen and ice been a number of months speaking on this Trail of the serpent then you come and try to speak a couple services on it and then you basically have spam amen so you just condense everything down and just try to put out a few things but we trust the Lord will take it all and just put it where it needs to be and because he knows the people's hearts and I don't and he does so we just have have confidence in that amen Revelations 12 1-5 we'll read this and let you be seated there appeared a great Wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of 12 stars and she being with child travail travailing cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his head heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon it was as it was born and she brought forth a man-child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto God into his throne you can be seated may the Lord bless the reading of his word last night we had read as a couple of our opening scriptures Isaiah 14. amen where where Isaiah had said what was in This Heart of Lucifer and then we read out of first Thessalonians uh where Paul was speaking and seeing the desire of of Satan's Heart come to fruition and Satan come to that position that he desired to be in uh it had to do uh Paul was comforting the people and he was comforting them with the revelation of the Rapture the coming of the Lord talking to them about the order of of what it would be um and and so forth but he describes to them how this man of sin would be revealed and and he he says in that time of revealing he called it the mystery of an of iniquity working he said there would be a feeling of the son of man and he said at the same time there would be a falling away amen so you have a falling away and at the same time there is a revealing of not the son of man but the man of sin I'm sorry who's be called the the Son of Perdition and and this son of perdition he would come in such a deception his deception would be after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth now notice he said they had the truth but they didn't love it so if you don't love the truth the value of it is not there for you as you spoke of last night and Satan can rob the effect and I think about that brother Paul the effect of the truth upon the people Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth shall what set you free so that effect is here this morning that comes with the truth but Satan will try through his deceiving and cooling off of the heart to rob you of the effect of the truth because if he robs you of its effect you'll walk away from it so keep in mind then uh these descriptions of of Lucifer we we spoke about them last night the old serpent the serpent the dragon each one of them with with maybe a a little bit uh description but it's all describing the same person and and he can he can he changes his labels but it's the same person right he's Lucifer son of the morning a worshiper amen but when he fell he became Satan the Devil the serpent because he wasn't the serpent he became the serpent because that's what he used amen he was the old serpent he was abandoned he was a pollen amen and here in Revelations 12 he's a dragon now a dragon is a serpent but he's much larger he's not just in one vessel now he's in a power and I want you I just want to use one thing out of the scripture to describe what I what I want to talk about because uh this is the dragon he's a serpent working now here in Revelations 12 through political and religious powers to kill Jesus At Birth remember and and we read it last night and we spoke about this Trail of the serpent and I'm in no means trying to uh assert brother Branham and preach a sermon he never preached at all he didn't preach it so let me preach it I just thought it was a good title you know somebody should use it right Amen brother Alex amen we use that title because it's a good one the trail of the serpent I'm no ways trying to stand up here and say oh this is what brother Madam means you know I'm just taking that title and taking what he said and about it and then we just go from there now he said it was Matthew 24 24 he said it was a Pentecostal move oh a Pentecost was the birth right it was the birth of the church and that's where Satan came in to deceive and we will find from Genesis to Revelations that's always where he corrupted was at the birth because if he can get it stir it to a wrong birth because because be sure every church can produce a birth denominations can produce a birth but it's a church birth but there's one birth that we are interested in and that is the birth the New Birth by the word of God is that right if you have a church birth it'll produce a church action you act like that church you have the same mannerisms of that church you have the same characteristics of that church because that's what you were birthed under that church doctrine but if you come by the word I don't care where that word is it can be in any country but if it's birth under the word it will have the same characteristic and that is the life of Jesus Christ because the interest of the holy spirit is always to teach you the truth of the word it's a corrector Holy Spirit he is the spirit of Truth lead you and guide you into all truth so brother Madam said it's the same he said it is the same the deception in this hour is it is the same betting ground the same church but it is two different fathers now we're we're in the layout of seeing age and I'm not going to get caught up in all the all the political moves that are around our rank so we got to call it this age we've got to call it that age this is the layout of C and H there's a layout has seen age that we are raptured out of and I'm not I'm not just talking about spiritually I'm talking about we are physically raptured out of this age this age is also known as The Rapture time it is also known as the Harvest age is that right it is known as the bride age why is it called all these things because this is the maturing of the word the word could not mature under denomination or organizational system and the Holy Ghost was bound at the door of all these systems Through the Ages that's why we had a period called the Dark Ages it suppressed everything and if you go if you go if you've ever went to any of these art galleries and everything when they come through the Dark Ages you can see the perception of these religious men that would paint it was it was a corrupted version of what God looked like and who he was and it's because they were suppressed even the Bible was kept out of their hands and the only interpretation of the Bible was the priesthood interpreting to them the words so the Holy Ghost was bound but in this age it's come back for a full restoration with the restoration comes the power of the word behind it and the power of the word has a purpose come on Church the power of the word is full Redemption and it's his purpose this morning amen is is brother Branham said that in the Harvest Time which is our time he said there had to come teachers that would bring that false Vine to to a full uh maturity and the only the only only person could bring the the bride to the full maturity had to come through a prophet surely the Lord will do nothing except he revealeth his secrets to his servants of prophet Satan knows this Satan knows this so this this I wanted to put this picture in your mind of what we read there in Revelations 12 here is the dragon this Force this power standing before the church to kill the life as soon as it's birthed amen there's a beast at the beginning it's a beast at the end you see at the beginning we are given the serpent we are shown the serpent God exposes his work and we'll go back to that in a minute he exposes him out of that comes the mark of what the mark of the beast well the mark of the beast has to follow what God is doing he had the Seal of God and you have the mark of the beast Amen brother bam said you had twins he had natural twins amen and twins come in every Revival and we're in the bride's Revival the bride's Revival is amen the word Revival that amen was promised for this hour amen and brother Branham he spoke about it you can go back and read it in excuse me the third seal he said why is everybody crying he said they're crying out for a Revival he said he'll take those seven on unknown Thunders to wake the bride up she's not awake it's going to take these to wake the bride up he said we haven't had a move of God yet to wake her up hope you're listening it would take those Thunders to wake her up a year later recognizing your day in this message he's preaching again and he says why is everybody crying he said you listen they're saying we need a Revival we need a Revival fast pray we need a Revival he said why do they do that he said they have not recognized The Awakening of the Bride now a prophet said it would take the seven unknown Thunders to wake him up God did not leave that up to an organization neither did he leave it up to a special Apostle he brought it through the ministry of a Vindicated Malachi for a prophet and the Thunders were uttered their voices through that Ministry and that's what wakes us up that's the only thing that can breed a bride to birth I'm not here Amen to preach a bunch of Doctrine but we're here to show that why there is a revival going on in the bride and it's a word Revival it's not stirring us back to something Foreigner it's stirring us ahead to the Fulfillment of Prophecy Hallelujah now you just watch the brother bam said to you watch how cunning he is he said it's it's two together he said you had Esau Jacob you had you had uh Cain and Abel you have Judas and Jesus they're just brothers in the same tribe he said even the Holy Ghost in the Antichrist are twins praise the Lord so with this Junction amen it's this Junction that I'm reading to you in Revelation 12. that was a junction of time it was a time of transition for here you have the woman amen and she she and I just need to you just forgive me here as I go back to it because I got to keep keep it before me because I can't all remember it all anymore amen just something that happened I don't know what it is but the scripture says there's a great Wonder in heaven amen notice where she's at she's in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun she's clothed with the sun and the moon is under her feet so she's in a dispensation a transition the law which is the moon is passing away it's changing now she's clothed in the sun they're moved into the the coming of the Lord right amen she's crowned with 12 Stars that's the apostolic doctrine that is coming I'm only quoting to you a prophet amen he's now so the church is bringing forth Jesus Christ but notice the position of the Red Dragon he stands in front of the church to hinder the church and when the birth is coming forth he's going to devour it now we read the scripture and we said it last night Satan tells you he's going to do something to you and he's very good at doing it I know I mean he has ordered your life and told you what's going to happen he's he's or he knows all about your genealogies he studied him I know hey you might be on An ancestry kick or something like that Satan already knew your ancestors he knows all your genealogies he knows the downfalls he knows amen the bad apples and he tells you you're that one and you're this one and that one and because I know your past I can tell you what your future is but Jesus says when he says a lie he is speaking of himself so when he's telling you something it's not the truth all right amen he'll tell you you can't get the Holy Ghost he tell you you've sinned away your day of Grace well there's a reason he's telling you that that's his problem that's not my problem amen he send away his day of Grace but there's Grace for you there's nobody without hope here this morning and it's our it's our Command as a minister to bring that hope to you and send it out so that the eye of faith can see it and the Hand of faith can reach out and take it [Applause] God wants you to see it and if you see it he wants you to say it what do you see Jeremiah I see an almond Rod he said I will watch over my words and perform it but you have to say it so there it was amen the Orthodox Church passing away the Apostolic Church coming in in brother Branham he pinpoints us down to this time the Roman Empire issued a proclamation to kill all the children from two years old and down to kill Christ Jesus now I want to I want to pay attention here because in the Garden of Eden we see a serpent now here's it's a dragon the garden it's a serpent the Bible says he's more subtle and all the beasts of the field and the prophet said he had characteristics physical characteristics that Satan took advantage of it tells us Satan's a planner he watches physical characteristics and he plans around that for the downfall listen and you don't feel sorry for the serpent but it was the downfall of a serpent right and he took advantage of that and you can see and he used those characteristics with great success against the woman we can see the subtlety and the cunning of Satan that he deceived Eve you you see now listen uh you know if everything was going right in my life and and the atmospheres were perfect and I had a uh my whole family was serving God I I know I would serve him and well hold on a minute because the Bible says shows us that Eve is in the midst of paradise amen with perfect atmosphere perfect Fellowship Perfect Harmony in marriage perfect health they had the power and authority by the word of God they lacked nothing God came down in the cold of the evening and fellowship with him and in that kind of atmosphere the spirit of a twin came in I remember where the revealing is of the man of sin there's a falling away where the word is there is a deception that will come in amen I want to want to see this because if you notice the Canon of Satan he not only studied the physical characteristics of of the serpent he studied the physical characteristics of the woman because he had knowledge of the woman before Adam did and he used that knowledge to bring this Union a false Union but why was he doing that we'll come to that in a minute because he knew the prophecy the command he attacked the message of the hour to multiply he attacked the birth so he done it with a false Union that brings forth life and even deceives the church till she says I have gotten a man from the Lord this birth is of the Lord brother Branham said she actually believed that at first um so we can see that he comes this is the tactic he used to just he deceived the woman he knew he could not deceive Adam so he come to the woman who who he knew was weaker and could be deceived the woman is a type of the church so we're not discriminating between men and women here now that's for a marriage sermon that brother Paul can preach we're talking about the church and the church is weak in the sense she can listen to Doctrine that's not of God and be convinced to go another way you cannot deceive the man Christ Jesus because he said Satan has no part in me he is not on my level he's not in my equal he wants you to think he has power to to make your life better he does not have power to make your life better there's one man in this room this morning who has the power to change your life to lift it up Glory we don't have much more information than on the serpent other than what we see we see a serpent he's more subtle than than all the beasts we know he's upright we know he can talk we know he can reason we know that his blood could and did Mingle with the human race right but now in Revelations 12 and Revelations 13 we are seen by Vision a more developed serpent he's more developed now he's called the dragon it's more description of the Beast you know the church will not make the connection with the dragon in the garden it takes a prophet to do that Amen in this chapter we may see as in a Revelations 12 we may see is in a panorama the entire conflict between the principles of Good and Evil between God and Satan we have set before us the old original quarrel between the woman and the serpent which was I'll put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed there'll always be an enmity and and so you can see you can see by scripture how both have developed now we're in Revelation and both have developed and one has become a queen decked with with the celestial amen and the other is a python with a tail so vast that he threatens to to destroy the stars with it with his sweep and he's successful in taking a great number of them brother random said it wasn't the tale t-a-i-l he said it was the t-a-l-e that he told in heaven now he's still telling a tale who do you think he's going to attack I do not see Satan out there trying to destroy the reputation of of Billy Graham amen there's not a hatred toward Billy Graham like there is toward William Branham but why is there a hatred towards William Branham amen it wasn't Billy Graham that preached the serpent seed amen but the serpent seed was revealed under the opening of those Thunders and Satan knows that when he's exposed he loses trophies now here's the thing about God Amen Satan can have a trophy room and you may be the centerpiece of that trophy room but God has the power to go into that trophy room and take it out of Satan's home oh Hallelujah Satan amen amen he does not open the door of his prison but God has the keys to it amen so we see now the church is developed but here's one more thing I want to show about this Dragon before we go back to the the beginning the python is red he's the Red Dragon red is the color of Edom one of the twins the adversary of the Lord the adversary of Israel it's the color of the Antichrist amen what was Edom Edom was the name the name change of Esau right and it signified he got his name changed when he sold out his Birthright [Music] he was already read but when he he sold out his Birthright they changed his name to Edom amen because now he has sold it out for his Passions for his appetite see it was the appetite that Satan introduced to Eve and the appetite has has the ability to change your life path why did the Lord say oh taste and see do you know when David wrote that you know when David wrote Oh taste and see that the Lord is good when he had been out of the will of the Lord and was down in the Philistines Camp amen he was going to help them fight Israel and some of the men amen are the princes of of the Philistines looked at David and said is this not the one they were singing songs about you know a Believer can get out of position amen but God has said something over their life that can never be taken away from them hallelujah amen and God spoke it amen they sung amen Saul has us thousands and David has his is this not the one they said would be the king of Israel and David changed himself in that moment and acted like a madman and scrabbled at the door and spit and he was running down his beard and he escaped and he went to the cave of agilom and there he wrote oh taste and see that the Lord is good Hallelujah why because you eat the word it also changes your life we said last night Amen to eat the word and it's a command of our day to eat the book to eat the book is a change it'll change you he's not telling you just nibble on it just taste it and put it back on the Shelf he's telling you eat it to develop an appetite for the words [Applause] praise the Lord we only see this spirit is one that rejected the birthright for the appetite amen and that is the embodiment of Esau's character it's a religious character but it's a spirit that God hates amen here's here's Satan's intention in the in the song of Moses it's a Red Sea Moses saying these words the enemy said I will pursue I'll overtake I'll divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them I'll draw my sword and my hand shall destroy them that's his mind that's his spirit that's the spirit of the enemy who opens not the house of his prisoners somebody can be sitting here this morning without hope because he doesn't open up the house of his prisoners he's a real enemy and all these names that I described to you and we mentioned them last night and spoke of some of them this morning it shows how much of an enemy he is because of his adaptability he adapts he adapts he presents himself a man as an angel of Light he adapts he he presents himself as a minister somebody who cares for you he will present himself as a believing church member because he has studied characteristics and he knows how dangerous it is to reason you remember Judas was one of the twelve if I would ask every one of you to to paint a picture of What Judas looked like you would probably not be very flattering in your depiction right because of his reputation you would want to put something in there that would look like he was capable of doing what he's doing what does a Trader look like to you you know you're not going to put him up there amen as one of the 12 working miracles preaching a sermon like this morning and people praising the Lord but that was Judas Judas was also under the command of the word go out and heal the sick and cast out devils announce my coming to the cities as you go Judas did not have a devilish Ministry he didn't want slouch around and and try to whisper in people's ears he had a holy ghost Ministry [Music] that's right the only thing he could not do is come up to birth right he could not come up to birth and because he had that characteristic that he could not receive all of the word Satan capitalized on that I can use this man and that man somebody in the message church will fulfill my words sell me for 30 pieces of silver the price of a Slave [Music] and Judas was a message believer who could sell the Lord back to the religious system because he knew the places Jesus was he could point out the quotes he didn't agree with and he became a betrayer the the thing with Cain and the thing with Judas is they recognized what they done after it was too late God have mercy on these men and women who are spouting out nonsense and they know nothing about what they're talking about I don't care what I do not care what the internet says or what somebody acts like they have all the information on William Brown I'm like we never had that before I want to tell you what God uses a prophet as a channel for himself to come down and meet you personally all you telling me is you never met God [Music] oh and I challenge you where do you go I'm screaming too loud ain't I but I found out with Satan he's deaf at times and I'm sick and tired of his hold over people's lives and the lies he tells to you I want you to know you do not have to live under that kind of lie I stake my life on this word [Applause] this word is the truth and it don't have to be filtered through another Channel this is how Satan hides Satan hid behind Judas Jesus was so lovely that even served communion to this man knowing what this man would do to him amen it was in that time of communion that Saint had entered in amends but God has exposed Satan by sending Messengers that would unmask him and if you want to find his Trail you can see it because God has sent his word so you can see it Satan has proven over and over what a champion he is as it was said in the days of Goliath he's been a champion from his youth it's his early days but the thought of his Hearts has been revealed just as the syrians told their King in the days of Elisha he said the even the word spoken in his bed chamber are there known that's what Isaiah did he exposed the thoughts of his heart I'll exalt my throne above the Stars ah of God I'll sit upon the Mount of the congregation the sides of the north I'll Ascend above the heights of the clouds I'll be like the most high but the response of the holy spirit is on Satan's declaration of war is you shall be brought down to Hell once you know hell was not created for you it was created for the devil and his angels come on the Lake of Fire was not created for you it was created for the devil and his angels amen but brother random said that first battle is in heaven said he was cast out and now it has fallen on human beings you are fighting battles this morning that first waged war Before Time that's why it's something that's hard to grasp and has such ability to pull down because if it could pull down Angels it can pull down your emotions it can meddle in your families it'll meddle in your hunger your spiritual hunger and in your walk with God it will focus your attention on failures and not on victories because he's a champion he knew what it meant for a giant to strut for in front of sons of God for 40 days and not one of them would move out of fear because of the words what have you done since Satan began talking to you he just holds you powerless sitting there in the tent sons of God sitting in the promised land and refusing to fight the enemy because he's not going to stop with you he's going to take your spouse and he's not going to stop with your spouse he's going to take your children and he's not going to stop with your children it's going to come into your grandchildren and then the next Generation that's his desire hey man but there's some Davids in here that can hear the words when that enemy speaks out it strikes something in my heart that's not my God how dare the enemy challenge the armies of the Living God I want you to know what army I'm associated with I'm associated with the armies of a living God by God's Alive Amen in the book of uh in the church age book The thyatar and church age there's there's that portion of they have not known the depths of Satan he's speaking to them in a thought Iron Age and he said the depths of Satan is very simple Amen to to to understand he said when a man experiences the depth of God in his life it is an actual personal experience of the spirit of God indwelling him and in his mind in his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of God through the word but the depth of Satan will be that he will attempt to destroy this reality he will always attempt to make a substitute for the reality of God there's the twin how will he do it he will take away the knowledge of the truth why do you think he's attacking the way he is today because he's trying to take away the knowledge of the truth because if you lose confidence in the truth you won't search out the truth and you lose the knowledge of the truth and here destroy the word by then putting forth his alternative he was talking to message Folk and then he will say yea hath God said is this what he said he'll then substitute the personal Christ in your spirit and the born-again experience that's what he did with Israel he caused Israel to do the same by a human being reigning as king instead of God the born-again experience will be rejected in favor for church joining Satan came to destroy God's purpose and that is to attack the anointed sons of God what did John say the Book of John first John he said beloved now we are the sons of God Satan's attacking that position I won't hold you much longer I forgot to set my clock so the word exposes Satan now I just want to speak about Adam and Eve before it closed we do not read of Adam and Eve having the knowledge of The Serpent and his characteristics that could be used against them why didn't God tell them you see God don't tell you things that will test you because they're there to test you I want you to know God has never lost a test you may have but God never has we do know and Adam would have had knowledge of this that he had Dominion over the serpent remember he had Dominion the Beast beginning is a beast at the end if he had Dominion then Gus Dominion now to beast in the Garden of Eden and the Beast and Satan's eaten because that was the Garden of Eden perfect atmosphere perfect health perfect communion Perfect Harmony we're not in that Garden we're in Satan's Eden we struggle with health marriage is struggle the harmonies get mixed up communion between Brethren gets divided Satan's Eden and Satan's Eden he is actually attacked the very command and creation of God by denying that we are creation of God and that no matter what you were at Birth you can be whatever you want to be you can be fluid you can choose if you want to just think in your mind oh you thought that way didn't you Satan why does he try to change the stature of a man to a woman and a woman to a man because in his heart he wants to be a son of God and he cannot be and this whole age of Satan's Eden is shouting out the sin in the garden because it's nothing but sexual perversion and it's permeated the atmospheres and and permeated culture and permeated politics and permeated the church there'll only be one righteous that sons of God that amen came under the blood that was shed amen and brother Branham says you can fall to one another but to God he can only see you through the blood amen Satan attacks the power of the blood by trying to say he's off The Mercy Seat he's not mediating anymore but I see where brother banham said amen get the book of redemption is still being read and it's when the last one comes in is when we leave I want you to know the book of redemption is still being read this morning brother Doug he's reading it over your life it might have started out in darkness and confusion but as he reads that book it comes up Hallelujah I'm about to act non-mennonite hmm two times we get stirred tacking your position when you say son of God put yourself there because that's who you are I don't care what the devil's lied to you and even where you're at in your life God has said over you you're a Son of God he didn't say that when you were born again he said that while you were yet in sin when the Holy Ghost fell upon them in Corinth when it fell upon them in Pentecost it fell upon Sons [Applause] you did not become a son by the Holy Ghost you were already sons and he knows his sons and his daughters that are here this morning and the same word that brought him to life there is the same word this morning praise the Lord if you look at the origins of man Adam was the Son of God the attribute of God's Own thought placed on Earth the Bible says and he's a secondary god with jurisdiction over everything pertaining to Earth Superior he's Superior to all things of the on Earth no I am not equal to a ear of corn do not care what the scientists say or any movement I am not equal to a cat or a dog come on I have more value our babies have more value than the life of a dog I'm sorry dog lovers come on Church we have more value because we have a soul that Soul was placed here to have jurisdiction over animal life amen he was God's Own expression his God's Own thoughts living in flesh Superior to everything on Earth everything obeyed Adam because God gave him power over it all but where Adam fell was in the power that he had to make of his own self the Brennan spoke that and fundamental Foundation of faith said that's where Adam fell the power to make his own self I want I want to put this out here for you because where that power was and it's the word that gives you that power where that power was this position of a son is where he fell he fell in his identity you see this is why God is against organization this is why he's against Church identities amen because you fail to reach what God has ordained for you Adam's own God's Own thoughts Living In the Flesh of Adams Superior to animalize Superior to the winds and elements Superior to all plant life everything obeyed Adam amen but he fell in that place of his identity and he lost fellowship with his father and when he did he lost power over the Earth and lost his friendship with God and I want you to notice what Adam fell before he fell before the serpent a beast of a lower order amen something of a lower order was the cause of the woman being deceived something Adam had power over is what he felt too and I want to say that this morning to you as sons of God you are not here to be held captive by something of a lower order something of the flesh passions of the flesh lust of the eyes the pride of life all these are lower order you're not made to be captive to a genealogy of of Fallen parents and the Fallen order of this Earth we are not made to be captive to somebody of a lower order we're thinking that that lower order has power over you to keep you but this serpent who is of a lower order brother Branham said in one place and I can't remember exactly where it is and I'm not going to say false Doctrine you can go look it up he said that the serpent was more attractive than Adam well that's a marriage seminar isn't it could you be attracted to a serpent because he didn't look like what they do now and tell you this about your friends of a lower order they're not your friends brother Branham said in the falling part of the world he said this Jezebel system of the devil's Got the Whole World in corruption and not a sound place in it it's all putrefied sores of cancer malignancy of the devil eating the very core out of the systems that they've got set up here Satan is a vulture feeding upon his own kingdom he's a devil he's impure he's the father of a lie and he feeds upon the Flesh of his own Dev of his own people that's the devil your so-called friend feeds upon your flesh the Garden of Eden is a place of Fellowship the Garden of Eden was actually called The Doorway to heaven that's what the Garden of Eden is the doorway to heaven the place where God came to fellowship with his people it's a place where he God had commissioned the couple to multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it the commission to Adam the man was to multiply and replenish if you study that that meant he was charged with cultivating it and bringing out more than what the eye sees you see we look at the scripture and we're commanded to do as Adam is commanded we're we're commanded to multiply and replenish and cultivate the word of God don't let it just set in the pages and be read let it multiply in the people's life and bring forth fruits that is there you're commanded as a Son of God to cultivate the word amen you have that power it's placed there by God in men Eden means it's a delightful place this place with God is delightful it's a place of pleasure it's a place of paradise it wasn't that that place was a better piece of ground than anywhere else but it was where God came it's where he fellowshipped amen amen God also told him to keep it to preserve it to guard it keep it and guard it Judas tells us to contend for the original faith not for your church Faith brother Branham said he said we must be stable but don't be stable in your church doctrine we can be stable in church doctrine he said but you must be stable in Bible Doctrine you'll find somebody they're messed up in their life it could be marriage and divorce or someone they're going to go around as preachers and find out who supports their situation it's not looking for the they're looking for a church doctrine by they're not looking for Bible doctrine that can correct their life so we're not to be stable in church doctrine or men's thoughts don't get messed up with William branham's preaching and think it's men's thoughts we have not followed cunningly devised Fables this is the word of God we find out that as soon as the church or the woman comes on the scene we're introduced to the serpent and we know what happened in one day one day an action that took place a deception that resulted in adultery in one day turned all the potential Lane out there turned it into a waste howling wilderness the first Adam did that everything changed on that day a man who was Superior to what happened to him fell we know how Adam was because of how Jesus was Jesus walked on water Adam walked on water Jesus could speak to the elements Adam could speak to the elements Adam was the first Adam Jesus is the second Adam he was given jurisdiction over everything Superior God of the Earth there's attributes in God that God is going to use to expose the trail of the serpent and to show that no matter how close that trail weaves its way into your home the attribute of God will expose it and show that it does not have the power to have the last word the book of redemption is still being read what do you mean brother Danny when Eve comes back Adam and says what has happened to me she's convinced that what has happened to her is good she gives it to Adam she's convinced what she's heard she doesn't realize and I'm going to call him what brother random called him he said the serpent became Eve's interpreter another interpreter to the church other than God's word oh that's not what brother Branham meant no no he didn't say it uh brother Branham prophesied this show me where it happened brother random said this if he's a man of God well I'll tell you what I'm just going to make a statement here this morning you can hate me if you want if you leave William Branham you leave Moses you leave Jesus you leave every one of these other prophets because every one of them had same flaws except Jesus and Jesus spoke in Parable so that the Believers couldn't even understand themselves until he told them plainly And when everybody that started leaving him because of what he preached he turned around to the 12 and said you're going to leave too I'm on Church you would have left them there you leave them here you leave them there but I'm telling you I want to stay you're safe oh brother banham brother Danny excuse me I'm not brother random brother Danny you shouldn't say that the devil will hear you well he already knows it Eve did not know what she was doing Adam knew exactly what he was doing when he listened to what Eve had to tell him he knew what he was about to do was wrong it was while he was still god of the Earth that he made that decision to step out with his wife he did not make that decision as a fallen man he became a fallen man after he made that decision when his wife came to him and said what she had done Adam knew it was adultery and he knew that this woman would have to be burnt but he loved her the trail of the serpent had the serpent had weaved its way right into Adam's own home there's only one way to save his wife and that was while he's God of the Earth to know what he's doing step out and partake of her Fallen condition Prophet said he took her quickly he intervened Adam intervened and took her quickly to himself knowing what he was doing would result in a falling condition but he loved her and he wasn't willing to lose her he's not willing to lose you your Fallen condition is not what stops him it's a lie from the trail of the serpent that tells you there's no hope and that you cannot be forgiven and that you're worthless and that you're no good it's a lie from the trail of the serpent that tells you that this message is not true because he knows that it's the love of God that has intervened in your life if the love of God had not intervened in my family I would be sitting down there in a lie to Ohio and Sharon Mennonite church with my arms folded gone amen but because the love of God intervened Amen I am now known as a son of God [Applause] I'm not a Mennonite I'm not an organizational man I come from the mind of God and what was in his mind is now in my body foreign he wants it to be flesh in yours Adam intervened can you imagine and I said I'm closing it's just taking a while to get down can you imagine they've made their own fig leaves now presenting themselves they didn't need that covering before but now they need a covering and they make up their own covering to meet God and they're trying to meet him they've covered up the place of multiplication and replenishing with their own fig leaves not put them over their mouth they made aprons and they meet God Adam what have you done this is not the same atom that stepped out for his wife and took her to himself now he blames her the woman you gave me it's not only her fault it's your fault how many people in here ah God you don't love me come on I want to say something about God and you if it wasn't for God you wouldn't even be here to have the nerve to say it God is your creator he's your owner he owns you he birth you he gave you life he gave you will he gave you a tongue that you use against God but it's God that gave that to you you're not God well if God really loves me why did my baby die God really loves me why did I go through this if God really loves me come on Church speaking with brother Brandon there amen back there and listen to brother random say this he said I was coming down off a hill he said I guess he'd been hunting or something I'm coming off a hill and I'm thinking about all I had went through in my early life and he said I lost my wife I lost my my baby and I I at my you know and at that time his church was dwindling he lost his father shortly before that and other people in the family a brother and so so he lost a lot he was scarred amen and he's thinking himself he said I don't think I could ever go through that again I don't want to ever go through that again and he said and something spoke to my heart and said well what of all the thousands that have come to the Lord because of the testimonies about your baby and he said and I stopped and I said then Lord I'd do it all over again that's a surrendered life not a resentful life we strut around like we got that kind of power to tell God what to do God is sovereign nobody can tell him what to do and nobody can tell him who to save and nobody can tell him though this one's no good it's God that intervened not you it was God that shed his blood not you it was God's amen Jesus that gave his life we strut around and act like we got power over him and he lined him up Adam Eve and the serpent the man of the home he said this is the principle in counseling you speak to the man of the home first because it's his his jurisdiction you're responsible for everything under that roof he didn't ask the woman first he asked the man I just got to stop and say I said I'm closing but it's a long Runway we got a jam up there at the thing so amen foreign I had a couple in the office one time married many years had four Sons and they couldn't get along with one another they had come to a point in their relationship they couldn't even look at one another and they sat in my office with their backs to one another at an angle they set at an angle and looked at me but they wouldn't look at one another they sat like they had their positions like this and he was positioned that way they're looking at me and I'm thinking this is really weird foreign you wondered what pastors are thinking in the office that's what it is we're not sitting there with Halos and and they begin to run each other down run each other down there was nothing good being said about each other nothing the man she's this she's that Jesus this isn't and he's doing this and he's doing this he's doing that and she's doing this he's doing this I got fed up with it you wanna know pastors get fed up I got fed up with it I said do you think we're actually going to accomplish anything here by telling each other's faults I said number one you can't even look at one another I said turn around and take each other's hands and look each other in the eyes I wish we had some kind of Orchestra or something playing because it took a while turned around they took each other's hands now it's hard to take each other's hands look each other in the eye and say how miserable they are so I said now you've been telling me nothing bad about that person because you're the man of the house I want you now to start telling me every good thing you can about this woman to me tell me every good thing now this is going to be funny and it was funny God moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform and you're going to find out he looked at her and he looked at me and he looked at her and he looked at me and he looked at her and it's like it was like it was going to take a while because you're coming from Mountain resentment going down through the valley of I can't think right now now you got to go up to the other Mountain of Love and it's hard to get there sometimes it's a toll road and then the bridge is out and he finally got there and this is what he came up with she makes good cookies thank God for chocolate chip cookies now you don't think God can't move in that when they started talking like that God dropped right down between them if it takes talking about cookies let's talk about cookies I'll let you know my God will move in your home here's Adam I'm getting there the Jam's leaving at the gate and here's Adam he's standing there God looks at him and says what have you done he said you know the woman you gave me she gave me this and I ate it he's a fallen son he forgot why he intervened so God he just does the order he turns to the woman why did you do this the woman is usually the truthful one of the bunch she opens up her mouth well you know what it was it was a serpent he beguiled me and I ate it and it was good and I took it back to Adam and he ate it too Hallelujah yep and God turned to the serpent it was more subtle than any beast of the field he could talk now he's anointed of the devil I can guarantee you if he's got that much time in a counseling session he's working up his reason I'm getting ready to tell why I did what I did the devil made me do it but when God turned to that instrument that lower order he didn't ask a reason he just turned him the devil's like the server's like ah and God said because you did this you are cursed to the ground and on your belly you shall go have you ever thought about that kind of counseling service because here's these two humans waiting for their judgment and they watch God judge a animal and he goes straight down to the ground boom he's on the ground oh my God you can imagine the fear that's now anointed them we are next but all God did is he turned to them and he looked over them in Prophecy because what they did did not hinder the plan of God but now God is going to bring out of himself the answer that you need this morning the answer you could not see you did not know God could be a savior but now you're going to know you did not know God could be a Healer but now you're going to know it was because of the trail of the serpent that we know these things blessed be the name of the Lord Satan is a loser he's not a winner I'll show you my plan and he killed a lamb and he covered them with another covering in Prophecy that the second Adam will come and his life will cover yours he did not come to Earth ignorantly he came to Earth to intervene and take you quickly to himself and become a part of your sin not by being a partaker of it as in the action of it by actually taking yours instead of your punishment he says now give your punishment to me all your guilt that you feel now has already been paid up all the things that you have in your mind wrestling at the wordless listen I can't make it it's already been paid amen the trail of the serpent has been exposed and he has lost he cannot stop this bride from having a can you imagine what it's doing to the arch enemy The Serpent amen his Beast was cursed to the ground but our bodies are changed in a moment he can't stop it he can't stop it amen we will not be shut up the prophet said we will be taken up to identify myself with blessed be the name of the Lord you love him let's Stand Together Hallelujah come brother Paul Hallelujah follow me
