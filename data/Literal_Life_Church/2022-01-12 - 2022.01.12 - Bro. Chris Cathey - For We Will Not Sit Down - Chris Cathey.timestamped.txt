[0:48] first samuel uh 16 it says you know if
[0:51] you go through samuel right here in
[0:53] verse 16 you know samuel was on a great
[0:56] mission for the lord he was on a great
[0:58] mission for the lord to go after gods he
[1:01] was looking for
[1:02] god's anointed king
[1:04] he's on a great mission that he's
[1:06] looking for god he wasn't going to stop
[1:08] until he found god's king
[1:11] and i like what he said here in verse
[1:12] 11. he said for right there at the end
[1:14] he said he says right in verse 11 and
[1:16] samuel said unto jesse are here all thy
[1:18] children and he said there remaineth yet
[1:21] the youngest and behold he keepeth the
[1:23] sheep and samuel said unto jesse sin and

[3:33] wisdom in that
[3:35] but i just want to encourage you tonight
[3:37] not to sit down on god

[3:41] and he says that samuel he said for we
[3:44] will not sit down
[3:46] so i'm here to tell you that we don't
[3:47] need to rust out or you know fold up
[3:50] shop it's not time to fold up shop it's
[3:52] time to keep pressing on where it's such
[3:55] a great hour that it's time to keep
[3:57] pushing on no matter your family comes
[3:59] against you if whatever happens you keep
[4:02] serving jesus christ you serve him with
[4:04] all your heart covers in the land i know
[4:07] it's we got to use wisdom in that and
[4:09] everything but i'll tell you what i
[4:11] we got god in the land he says when we
[4:14] lay hands on the sheik they shall
[4:15] recover you call me a nut case today but
[4:19] i'm happy to be in that case because i
[4:21] love jesus christ i know what this word
[4:23] says brother says show me a bible and
[4:26] i'll show you it's marked up and read
[4:27] through tonight and it's born and
[4:29] battled he said i'll show you a go a
[4:32] person that loves the lord
[4:35] brethren says he said i'd rather just be
[4:37] a little over jealous about my the
[4:40] father's kingdom than to have no zeal at
[4:42] all
[4:43] he said i'd rather overwork he says and
[4:46] as a as the church of christ preacher
[4:49] told me some time ago brother brown he
[4:51] said mr brown i'd rather i'd rather well
[4:53] or wear out than rust out
[4:56] he said and that is a lot of truth he
[4:58] said i'd rather wear out and die in the
[5:00] harness oh praises hey as brother
[5:03] neville said then you refused to have
[5:05] the harness on
[5:08] he said you can't do any nothing he said
[5:10] you can't do nothing any worse than
[5:13] neglect to try
[5:16] he said let's do all we can
[5:19] all we can
[5:21] with what you have to do with he said in
[5:24] the holy spirit our tutor will bring it
[5:26] to the father

[5:31] don't just use some of it i believe some
[5:33] of us we got so much talent with the
[5:35] youth or whoever age you are tonight i
[5:38] don't care all young but you can you
[5:40] could serve with everything you got for
[5:42] the lord
[5:44] that was a spiritual adoption
[5:48] you say who
[5:49] the lord jesus christ the king is coming
[5:52] and i believe this is just the same
[5:54] thing we're doing today we're not
[5:56] sitting down until the king is coming
[5:58] we're not sitting down like samuel the
[6:00] bride of christ is making herself ready
[6:03] and as she's coming to church every day
[6:05] when the doors are open or when they're
[6:07] supporting the ministry brother says
[6:09] supporting their local church get in
[6:11] there and and put your shoulder to the
[6:13] will i tell you you know say they say i
[6:15] hate to say this tonight but they push
[6:17] push play and obey i'll tell you what
[6:20] they're not obeying some of these people
[6:21] are not obeying tonight they're not
[6:23] listening to what the prophet's saying
[6:25] and i tell you what he never took
[6:27] ephesians 4 out he never took the
[6:29] started taking the bible out tonight and
[6:32] i tell you you shouldn't either
[6:36] but i tell you luke 19 13. i was reading
[6:39] before i came in here it says then he
[6:40] called his ten servants and delivered
[6:43] them ten pounds and said them i could
[6:45] occupy till i come another word get busy
[6:49] in other words get busy for the lord
[6:51] tonight i tell you to get busy you know
[6:53] we look at other people and say well
[6:55] they're doing something for the lord i
[6:56] tell you you do something for the lord
[6:59] oh just tell someone about jesus tell
[7:01] him about the love of god tell him what
[7:03] he's done for you and your life i tell
[7:05] you why you'll feel the holy spirit come
[7:07] down it'll take a negative situation
[7:09] when they start talking negative i tell
[7:11] you to turn into positive i get someone
[7:13] on the phone sometimes rachel be on the
[7:16] phone someone be talking negative i say
[7:18] rachel just say something positive
[7:21] and before you know it they're like hey
[7:22] someone's on the other line i gotta go
[7:25] try it sometime
[7:27] because they want to just hear some
[7:29] negativity always they just want to hear
[7:31] we're we're in this flash and we're
[7:33] we're we're mortal but i tell you what
[7:35] we got a haul that rachel sing about
[7:37] today that i see it coming down in this
[7:40] age i believe the home is right in plain
[7:42] sight tonight and i'm going there
[7:45] tonight i got a mother there tonight
[7:47] that's saying son keep pressing on
[7:50] you probably got a father there tonight
[7:52] if he can look at you he brought back
[7:54] through the time brother brown said he
[7:56] said they came there and there was
[7:57] converts and converts and they said hey
[7:59] i don't want to go back in that body he
[8:01] said brother he said you he said the
[8:03] saints said keep pressing on he heard
[8:05] him saying keep pressing on i believe if
[8:07] you saw your daddy tonight he would say
[8:09] keep pressing on brother keep pressing
[8:11] on tonight he would say brother paul you
[8:14] keep pressing on sister brother keep
[8:16] pressing on i tell you because the
[8:19] reward is so much greater
[8:21] the reward is so much greater
[8:26] 1 7
[8:27] through 8. jesus replied he said it's
[8:29] not for you to know the times or seasons
[8:31] that the father has fixed by his own
[8:34] authority but you will receive power
[8:37] when the holy spirit comes upon you and
[8:40] you will be my witnesses in jerusalem
[8:42] and judah samara and to the ends of the
[8:44] earth
[8:45] our job is not to sit down
[8:47] if you read this our job is to be filled
[8:50] with the holy ghost and do something for
[8:51] the lord
[8:53] it's not just to say i'm a bible
[8:55] believer i'm a message believer or i
[8:57] just quote a couple quotes or i know a
[8:59] quote i tell you what it's time to live
[9:02] what the prophet talks about and he
[9:04] lines up with the word of god it's time
[9:06] to get in the action and not just say
[9:08] it's brother paul tonight or it's for
[9:10] the preachers or the deacons or the song
[9:11] leaders it's for everyone that's sitting
[9:14] in front of me tonight we have to put
[9:16] all our shoulders to the wheel when i

[14:51] people he said just think that you would
[14:53] become a christian that's all we need to
[14:55] do that settles it forever as they are a
[14:58] christian he said everything's going to

[15:19] the techniques of the enemy
[15:21] and to know how to afford he said
[15:23] fortified to know how to fight the fight
[15:26] he said then we can only do that as the
[15:28] holy spirit reveals it to us
[15:31] we can't take what some other nation
[15:33] tells us and he says when we go to war
[15:37] he says some of their ideas he said but
[15:39] we got to take our own ideas the way the
[15:42] holy spirit would direct us he said what
[15:45] ideas we would give us become because he
[15:48] is the commander chief of the army of
[15:50] the christians
[15:52] he also says in another place he said he

[16:29] in your the young kids i want to hear to
[16:31] tell you tonight that you got to get a
[16:33] get a passion for jesus christ you gotta
[16:36] get in the word of god no matter if your
[16:38] parents don't pray don't matter if you
[16:40] you're you know what you pray
[16:45] you pray i learn real quick i enroll
[16:48] with a prayer family besides my
[16:49] grandmother
[16:50] and i believe real quick i had to
[16:52] realize research and start studying why
[16:55] i believe what i believe and when you
[16:57] start researching not just because your
[16:59] parent believes it you research why you
[17:01] believe the word of god you go through
[17:03] from genesis to revelation and when you
[17:05] get a sound doctrine and you get a sound
[17:08] and you get that root inside and it just
[17:10] starts to get watered i tell you what no
[17:12] one will take it out of you
[17:15] no one will take it out of you
[17:18] he says the christian don't ask for easy
[17:20] things you are not there's so many
[17:22] promises today amongst christian people
[17:25] so many ministers promise the people a
[17:27] false saying if you'll just come to
[17:29] christ all your troubles is settled he
[17:31] said i tell you when you come to christ
[17:34] then they begin
[17:36] that's when you put on the uniform and
[17:38] take the gun and enter the battlefield
[17:41] he said this christian road is not a
[17:43] flower bed of ease it's a battle from
[17:45] every very hour you start

[22:38] for yourself he said whoever could kill
[22:40] goliath i'll give him my daughter

[23:04] what he's got a bride that he's coming
[23:06] back without a spot or wrinkle and
[23:08] that's because of the blood that's shed
[23:10] on calvary that's not because what
[23:12] you've done is because pure grace
[23:14] tonight and it's the grace of god that
[23:17] has come down your house and knocked on
[23:19] your door tonight and said i want to

[24:08] script scarecrow to you i said but i
[24:10] believe every word of the bible
[24:12] from genesis to revelation i don't just
[24:14] take it this ain't a solid buffet this
[24:17] is you take the whole book tonight
[24:21] it's not a time we were driving up here
[24:23] it's not a time to put it on cruise
[24:25] control i thought about our car you put
[24:27] it on cruise control it's not a time for
[24:29] cruise control it's a time to get up and
[24:31] keep pressing on tonight
[24:34] it's time where i believe we're in the
[24:36] last i believe we're in the last sprint
[24:38] tonight
[24:39] i was reading an article the other day
[24:40] and i think his name was redmond he had
[24:42] all the history he made that he was mean
[24:45] every single medal
[24:46] i was reading the article he was winning
[24:48] every single medal throughout history
[24:51] and he was winning all these medals and
[24:52] he gets to the main race and he starts
[24:55] running this race and all the cameras
[24:57] were pointed on them
[24:58] in the olympics and they're all pointing
[25:01] on this one guy and they kept pointing
[25:03] the camera because he was way afraid of
[25:05] everybody else and about halfway through
[25:07] the race here he is he falls down and he
[25:09] loses
[25:11] something falls out cramps in his leg he
[25:13] hurt something and pulled the hamstring
[25:15] and he starts to limp and then he falls
[25:16] down and all of a sudden he sees his dad
[25:19] in the corner and he looks and he sees
[25:21] his dad come running down and his son's
[25:23] starting to weep and he says son you
[25:25] don't have to prove anything you've won
[25:27] medals after medals after medals he says
[25:29] son you don't have to prove anything
[25:30] this is a true story he said you don't
[25:32] have to prove anything you've got it on
[25:34] the walls at home
[25:35] he said daddy he said just come on home
[25:38] son i'll bring you home he said daddy if
[25:40] you don't carry me whatever it takes i'm
[25:42] gonna take this old beating up leg and
[25:44] i'm gonna get up and i'm gonna keep
[25:46] going until i cross that finish line and
[25:48] he said he just grabbed his leg and he
[25:50] started carrying his leg and he said he
[25:53] started limping and he limped halfway
[25:55] through to the rest of the finish line
[25:57] and he said there wasn't one record that
[25:59] he won the race but there was a record
[26:01] on the line that said he finished the
[26:03] race and i believe there's a bride of
[26:05] christ here tonight that you might be
[26:07] battled and bruised tonight and you
[26:08] might be limping tonight but i tell you
[26:10] to get up i tell you to get up and keep
[26:13] serving jesus christ i'm not telling you
[26:16] tonight you just get up i don't care if
[26:18] you're battled and scarred tonight but
[26:20] you grab your leg or whatever it takes
[26:23] and you pre-pressing forward i tell you
[26:25] what don't look what people are saying
[26:27] out there it's better i'm saying it's
[26:29] chatter chatter chatter and it's chatter
[26:31] chatter i'm there to tell you tonight
[26:33] you just to keep pressing forward
[26:35] tonight
[26:36] and you grab that leg or that arm or
[26:39] whatever the devil wants to tell you to
[26:40] god tonight brother said refuse anything
[26:43] the devil brings you
[26:45] and he says as soon as you accept that
[26:47] package back he says then the devil's
[26:49] got you
[26:51] but i believe tonight we got to refuse
[26:53] everything the devil you know what i'll
[26:55] say i think sometimes as a believer we
[26:57] think the devil's amazon
[26:59] they just show up on your doorstep the
[27:01] devil gives you what you want and you go
[27:03] okay i'll take it
[27:05] i tell you why you need to kick the
[27:06] devil out tonight
[27:08] and say devil you're not belong in this
[27:10] house
[27:11] i tell you it's time to go home
[27:12] sometimes and do a house cleaning
[27:15] i got it over my door over my door at
[27:17] home it's just for in this house we're
[27:19] going to serve the lord i said boys
[27:21] we're going to serve the lord we're
[27:23] going to go to church we're going to
[27:24] love jesus christ and we're going to
[27:26] love him with everything that's within
[27:28] us
[27:30] like ii timothy paul said i fought the
[27:32] good fight i have finished the race i
[27:35] have kept the faith
[27:38] i have prayed paul said i pressed toward
[27:40] philippians 4 3 14 i pressed toward the
[27:42] mark of the prize of the high calling of
[27:45] god in jesus jesus
[27:49] so if i had something to say that
[27:50] tonight
[27:51] i didn't know where to go i was praying
[27:52] really praying before in the hotel
[27:58] i was just like lord let me get your
[27:59] channel
[28:02] but i want to encourage you to write
[28:03] something down tonight don't sit on your
[28:05] purpose
[28:07] don't sit down on your purpose
[28:09] because you know what samuel didn't
[28:12] samuel had one purpose and to find the
[28:15] king
[28:16] and i believe tonight that a bride of
[28:18] christ has a purpose tonight and that's
[28:21] to find the king tonight and i'm telling
[28:23] you tonight that you keep pressing on
[28:26] you keep striving everything that's in
[28:28] you you just take everything the word
[28:30] says and you believe it and you take
[28:32] your purpose tonight and you say i got a
[28:34] purpose devil you you applied the i said
[28:37] if he applied the asset to your eyes
[28:39] tonight
[28:40] tell the devil to get out of your house
[28:42] and you believe it with all your hearts
[28:45] and i believe like samuel you know god
[28:48] samuel god samuel didn't sit down on his
[28:50] purpose
[28:52] you pray you have a purpose
[28:54] any purpose is until he takes you out
[28:56] here keeps serving him with all your
[28:58] heart
[28:59] you know people are going out with cove
[29:01] within this and it flew and all these
[29:03] sicknesses rachel was in the medical
[29:05] field for 15 years as a pharmacist i
[29:07] know we were living in south carolina i
[29:10] looked at her one day and i said honey
[29:12] we're doing and i'm just saying this for
[29:13] my family so wherever you feel led i'm
[29:15] not telling you i'm just telling you
[29:16] what we felt that i was praying and
[29:18] praying rachel come home one day and i
[29:20] said honey you've been 15 years in that
[29:22] hospital i said now we have isaac i said
[29:25] i want you to raise them kids
[29:27] i want you to raise them boys i want you
[29:29] to i don't care about that money
[29:32] i said i got in the prayer closet and i
[29:34] just started praying and started weeping
[29:36] rachel will tell you tonight she come
[29:38] home after 15 years in the hospital they
[29:40] said we want you to be the director of
[29:42] i'm telling you about not sitting down
[29:44] tonight
[29:45] and i'm telling you i'm just sitting
[29:46] here to encourage you i'm not telling
[29:47] you you have to do this you do what the
[29:48] lord tells you to do
[29:51] and so i come home i was praying i said
[29:53] honey put your notice in
[29:56] she was scared to death she didn't know
[29:58] how we were going to make it she didn't
[29:59] know where the next paycheck was going
[30:01] to come but i don't know about you
[30:03] tonight but i know where the paychecks
[30:05] come from i know where my 401k comes
[30:08] from and that's from jesus christ he
[30:10] said greater is he that's in me than he
[30:13] that's in the world
[30:15] and i started realizing i started really
[30:17] thinking about first john 4 and i
[30:19] started thinking about really where my
[30:21] faith lies in and it's jesus christ i we
[30:23] almost lost everything we really all
[30:26] know you could tell her we were on the
[30:27] verge of about losing everything we had
[30:30] and a check came in the mail she put her
[30:32] notice in
[30:34] we put another sin i put resumes all
[30:36] over the place and i i was searching for
[30:39] a job i said lord you got to find us
[30:40] somewhere fellowship we didn't have much
[30:42] of a church then
[30:43] her father served in this message in the
[30:45] in the word of god all over all over the
[30:48] world faithfully and uh
[30:50] at the time we did we started having
[30:52] boys and we started realizing they
[30:53] needed fellowship
[30:54] you're starting to realize when you have
[30:56] a faithful pastor that wants to push
[30:58] fellowship and push young people to get
[31:00] closer to god and because they're the
[31:02] next ones coming up
[31:05] i think there's some churches i see in
[31:07] the message like well what about the um
[31:08] well we'll forget about them no they're
[31:10] the next people coming up
[31:13] and i i where i'm going with this i
[31:15] don't know but i'll tell you what i uh
[31:17] rachel played another said she was
[31:18] shaking that night i looked over she
[31:20] thought i was asleep and i looked over
[31:22] and the faithful wife was just putting
[31:23] her resume they said we want you to be
[31:24] the chief she said actually i'm quitting
[31:27] she said my husband told me we're going
[31:28] to quit i'm going to follow the leading
[31:30] of the lord i applied all over the place

[36:13] don't sit down let's read in verse 41.
[36:15] and the lord said unto samuel how long
[36:18] will thou mourn i saw seen i was
[36:20] rejected from him he reign over israel
[36:22] fill thine horn with oil and go and he
[36:24] said i will send night into jesse he
[36:26] bethleh might for i am provided for a
[36:29] king among his sons
[36:31] verse six
[36:32] it says and it came to pass when they
[36:34] were come and he looked at elab and he
[36:37] said surely the lord's anointing is
[36:39] before him and he started praying he's
[36:42] talking to the lord he's praying to the
[36:44] lord he says but the lord said unto
[36:46] samuel look not on his countenance or
[36:49] not on his height or statute because i
[36:52] refused him for the lord seeth not as a
[36:55] man saith before the man he said for the
[36:58] man looketh on the outward appearance
[36:59] but the lord looketh on the heart
[37:02] so don't think you know someone's heart
[37:04] tonight
[37:05] i'll tell you what just serve do your
[37:07] purpose get in your purpose and serve
[37:09] jesus christ with all your heart and
[37:11] don't sit down on your purpose and don't
[37:13] sit down on your prayers
[37:15] he answered here he is he answered saul
[37:18] he answered samuel's prayers and he gave
[37:20] him what he was looking for
[37:22] he didn't just get it on the first try
[37:24] he went through jesse jesse started
[37:26] bringing his sons bringing him up kept
[37:28] bringing but he found his purpose he was
[37:30] looking for the king here's one here's
[37:32] one if you read through for time you
[37:34] read through chapter 16. he brought one
[37:36] here comes another cuts up the thing
[37:38] with seven he keeps going and finally
[37:40] finds a ruddy boy that you wouldn't
[37:42] think that he'd be choosing of god's
[37:44] king but i tell you why god don't you
[37:46] people look at the world and they're all
[37:48] caught up in the cove and this and that
[37:49] but i tell you what a perfect time to
[37:51] leave the world what a perfect time when
[37:54] the world's caught up in sickness and
[37:56] all this drama and all this thing that's
[37:57] going on and the bride just one day just
[38:00] keeps walking like he walked i believe
[38:02] it's coming around the corner that we're
[38:04] going to be walking like enid walked i
[38:06] believe we got that testimony we got
[38:08] that in the bible to show the bride of
[38:09] christ that's what it's coming down to
[38:12] it's a showdown time it's not a time to
[38:14] sit down
[38:16] brother i'm saying oh father i pray as
[38:18] your servant the only way we realize
[38:20] that that prayer changes things he said
[38:22] prayer changes a sinner to a christian
[38:25] he said prayer changes a sick man to a
[38:27] well man he said and i asked in joining
[38:30] prayer he said with this man that you
[38:32] heal his body may he go off this
[38:34] platform happy rejoicing in jesus name
[38:38] and i tell you i don't know if you've
[38:40] ever heard this quote but i tell you he
[38:42] said we have the most powerful thing he
[38:44] said prayer is the most powerful weapon
[38:47] powerful weapon that was ever put in the
[38:49] control of human beings
[38:52] now you take a statement tonight what
[38:53] the prophet god said he said prayer was
[38:56] the most powerful weapon you have
[38:59] tonight
[39:01] why don't we use it enough because we
[39:03] get caught up in things of the world in
[39:04] busyness of life but god wants us to
[39:07] cross a rugged christian soldier and get
[39:10] in your prayer closet and say lord show
[39:12] me your will tonight show me your will
[39:14] lord i want to be in your channel
[39:16] tonight
[39:18] i'll tell you he'll show you if you
[39:20] would just be stuck you just listen to
[39:22] that small that still saw voice
[39:26] but i want to show something tonight i
[39:28] hope i get to it but but luke said luke
[39:30] 11. i want to bring something out
[39:32] tonight really hit home for me
[39:35] jesus teaches on prayer
[39:37] it's really hit home hope it hits home
[39:39] for you tonight
[39:41] it says then it came to pass
[39:43] that is as he was praying in a certain
[39:45] place
[39:46] he said when he ceased one of the
[39:48] disciples said unto him lord
[39:50] he's his disciples
[39:52] think about this tonight the disciples
[39:54] could ask him for anything they wanted
[39:57] they saw the five loaves and the five
[39:59] fishes they could have not had to go to
[40:00] walmart anymore to go shopping anymore
[40:03] they could ask them anything he wanted
[40:05] he hung the stars in the sky they saw
[40:07] every miracle tonight but they asked him
[40:09] one question
[40:10] they said in a certain place when he was
[40:13] ceased he said one of the disciples said
[40:14] to him lord
[40:16] teach us to pray
[40:18] he didn't say how to pray he said to
[40:21] pray
[40:22] he didn't say how do we pray he goes on
[40:25] and says how he goes in he's telling you
[40:26] how to pray but the disciples said to
[40:28] pray
[40:29] so i'm here to tell you tonight just to
[40:31] pray
