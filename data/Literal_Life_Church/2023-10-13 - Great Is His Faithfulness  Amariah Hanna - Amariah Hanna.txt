Great Is His Faithfulness

Lyrics:
Verse 1
If you have felt the dark of night
Questioning what is out of sight
He is the answer, He is the light

Verse 2
If you have felt the weight of sin
Bound by the shame that’s hemmed you in.
He’ll break the chains He will forgive

Chorus
Oh lift your head
Morning is coming There’s more to the story
Don’t forget
In grief and in glory Still great is His faithfulness

Verse 3
If you’ve felt broken and betrayed
No one to trust, alone, afraid
He’ll comfort you, He knows your name

Verse 4
If you’ve wrestled with the ache of loss
And why this has been your road to walk
He bore your pain, He wore your cross

Bridge
He is Present Helper Keeper
Great is His Faithfulness
Perfect Sovereign Fortress
Great is His Faithfulness
Abba Father Comfort
Great is His Faithfulness
Redeemer Restorer Sustainer
Great is His Faithfulness

Tag
Wait on Him, Rest in Him Come find your peace again
Trust in Him, Hope in Him Great is His Faithfulness

Written by Steven Musso, Elizabeth Hunnicutt, David Gentiles, May Angeles
