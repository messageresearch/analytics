TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i'm glad to be free this morning i'm glad to be a christian i'm glad to walk in the message of the hour i'm glad to be in his presence here this morning glad to be amongst the body of christ and i pray that around the world the holy spirit would move in a special way not only with us here but everywhere where we meet under the true word of god and the presence of god i pray that lies would be changed we don't want to leave here the same as when we came in amen praise the lord hosea chapter 3 this is the text i read last sunday we're going to continue with the subject seeking the son of david in the last days seeking the son of david in the last days it says here in verse 4 for the children of israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince and without a sacrifice and without an image and without an ephod and without a a tariff him those things some of those things that are mentioned that the children of his or went many days without are some of those things are essential things to connecting with jehovah god a king a prince the sacrifice if we remove those things they're essential and the people of israel had got so far away from them this is speaking about how the condition you can get in without a king without a sacrifice anybody can get in that condition if they distance themselves and get separated enough from what god sent his essentials for your spiritual life i don't care if you grew up all these years in church you get away from the right things and you're going to start to suffer but some of the things mentioned here are not and we'll get into this a little bit today it says without an image and without an ephod and without a terraphim these are actually things if you study it deeper that are there weren't things necessarily god provided because he said no have no graven image before you so these are things god didn't provide but they were things that the people set up in their homes when they were so far away from jehovah god they begin to set up images they begin to set up an ephod and a terraphim and these things were anything that they could just grab and put in their homes and put it in their lives that could somehow make them feel better that they were connecting with god so when we get away from god this is what happens and with essential things from god we start to develop our own things to make our own connection with god and that's idolatry and that's imagery and those are things that if you think that we don't have those today we still have those today but when redemption comes in verse 5 this is what the people did the children of israel return and seek the lord their god and david their king and shall fear the lord in his goodness in the latter's days and that's why i said seeking the son of david in the last days seeking the lord seeking the son of david and with the fear of god and his goodness this is what the people did in the last days that's my heart i don't want to be seeking any possession of life i don't want to be seeking any other thing of man i'm not seeking politics this morning i'm seeking the lord and i'm seeking the king and if we could have a new year's resolution or i call him new year's revelations this would be it for me i don't want to be seeking anything else except the lord and the king amen father bless the word today bless every soul that is here and listening lord jesus may you surround us lord and fill us with your presence lord jesus there's such a dependence on you and more and more as the days are approaching we see this in the scripture lord and in the last days the people coming back to seeking the right thing lord i pray we would do it i pray we would make it a if there is a new years to look towards a goal i pray we would make this the greatest thing in our hearts lord that we seek you more and we seek your presence and we seek to be around those things and the things that you've provided for us lord to bring us back to you and lord we're rejoicing and happy we're thankful this christmas is not just some shallow tensile but father it is a worship that's in our hearts we stand today worshiping the king of kings and the lord of lords we stand today lord with with with no agenda to tell you what to do but to invite you to to come as king and kings lord and and to do a work in our lives and to change us lord and to impress us with your presence father and change us move among us we pray anoint the minister this morning give me grace lord from your throne god i pray that you bless every heart that's here in the name of the lord jesus christ we ask you amen and amen god bless you may be seated we appreciate brother michael that special this morning god bless you we appreciate all the gifts and just the anointed words of god and singing of god that brings us certainly into his presence amen do you love the lord this morning praise the lord we want to just stay in this channel of talking about this seeking the son of david in the last days and being it's this time where the world celebrates and our focus is on the story of when christ was born and we know a majority of people don't really completely understand what was taken place in that and yet the world focuses on it and looks at it and and we we certainly do that it's not about the tinsel and all these other things as much as is about recognizing god came in flesh and all of us are affected because that a visitation from the lord we we we try to watch together as a bit of a tradition the nativity story and it's a it's a special film that uh it makes it really real the birth of christ really real mary's really they make it real down to earth and real not covered over with things and maybe more of a catholic way about it but it's just very good and we always minister to with that but the story is that over 2 000 years ago the world did not know that in bethlehem god was actually bringing the world doesn't know this but god was actually bringing a completely different kingdom to the earth probably not a lot of people know that's what was happening but when he came himself in a baby what he was doing was bringing his kingdom to earth a completely different kingdom than we would be used to and he brought it in the form of a little baby the word made flesh of course is completely different than any politics or completely different than any religion even the jewish religion even the pharisees and sadducees and all that they knew of jehovah and all that they studied and the law that they knew i can tell you that when the word was made flesh and was born there god was bringing something completely different a completely different kingdom their law and their religion actually they'd turned it into their own kingdom they turned it into something god did not intend for it to be turned into we always do that as human beings we take something from the past and we make it a tradition and we turn it into a kingdom but then it's god's saying no that's not what i was looking for that's not what i was wanting that's not the kingdom of god that's become a religion that's become something you put on the outside and then because we adopt our own ways then it get we get into such a condition without god thinking we're okay with our religion that after so many years god has to say listen they've gotten completely away from my kingdom and so now i have to come again myself and bring the kingdom of god back to earth again he was bringing his kingdom to earth can you say amen he was bringing his kingdom and they didn't recognize it as that they didn't know that it was that and they didn't know that what god was bringing was exactly what they needed they didn't know that what god was bringing in that baby was exactly what would exactly meet the need that they were in the condition that they were in god had the answer for the condition they were in and that's true this morning don't be looking for your own thing look for what god has provided to meet the condition you're in because god's way is the best way god's way is the way that's going to really bring the answer to your life and bring the answer to what their condition you would be in no matter what it is so they didn't know what was needed they didn't know this is exactly what was needed and it's it's not now that it's not that they weren't fed up with the system it's not that they weren't fed up with uh what was going on they were fed up with it and it's not that they weren't poised for another kingdom to come they were actually ready they were anxious for another kingdom to come something else has got to happen and the jews particularly gravitated towards the messiah but they interpreted it as being that the messiah the king would come in a manner that would get rid of rome and deal with our problems and we would be in charge and so even a desire for something to change it wasn't interpreted according to the word because what israel needed first was not a king but they needed a lamb to die for their sins can you say man because if you don't take care of the sin first what good is a king if you don't take care of your problems and your sin what good is a king in a kingdom because the kingdom in god's kingdom it's about your soul it's about your heart why would god want to take you in the condition you're in and take you over into a millennium with a king and you didn't have any of the character of the king you didn't have any change in your life you didn't have the kingdom of god within you he has to have his kingdom within your soul and within your heart first and then you're ready for the king can i get an amen this morning i don't know if you had too much turkey yesterday what's going on but i'm intending on preaching my heart out whether you're going to get into it or not let me tell you something god said exactly what the people needed and it was for the heart first it was for the sin first so don't question how god's dealing with you sometimes because he deals with things in different ways and he comes to you in different ways but he knows what he has to deal with first they were fed up with the kingdom that they had they were fed up with they were ready for another kingdom they were but it's the way god brought it that made it difficult to see and they didn't see it they were in dire need of something different but this was not just a a different bent on things this was not just to put a bandage on their problems this was not another version of the world that god was bringing this was a completely different kingdom coming not to be compared at all with what they had if they had a revelation that it was god's answer they would have been seeking for it let me say that again if they had a revelation that this baby was god's answer to their condition then they would have been seeking after it if you have a revelation of what god has provided in the last days you will be seeking for it every day you will be looking this is what i want this is what i've i've pursued every other thing in my life but i have found this is god's provided way and i'm gonna seek for it with all my heart i'm gonna get closer to it i'm going to get closer to my lord can you say amen and it's when you have a revelation which that day only a few were seeking it out the shepherds the wise men only very few in that day the rest herod certainly wasn't seeking it and if he was it was to kill the messiah it was to kill the king but we find the wise men and mary and joseph and there was very few but they had a revelation and so we find something rise up in the hearts of the shepherds and the hearts of the wise men as they begin to seek this thing they took this journey clear across the desert why they were seeking i was going to sing a song with my mom today we sung for years she's sick today wasn't here but wise men still seek him today and not just wise in their head but a people with revelation what's how do i know they have a revelation they're seeking him the wise men took the journey they were willing to come many many hours drive many many hours with their camels can you say man i think of many of you who drove many hours this morning out of a hunger of god in your heart can you say amen it's a revelation those that are seeking something can you say man they're seeking more of god they're seeking i want to know the king more can you say amen and here's these these basically heathen men we don't know what was in complete in their hearts but they got a revelation of the stars coming together and god dropped in the heart that's the time for the king of kings we're going to make the journey to go clear across the desert and it took him a long many months probably two years and they said we're doing this thing we're leaving our everything comfortable to us why they were seeking because they had a revelation you see that's why we have to pray for our children and pray for those that we're praying for the greatest thing you can pray is that they receive a revelation don't try to conform them don't try to get them in church and just make them look like the message but pray because my god can do much more than any religion can do my god because why are we praying for life god opened their eyes because once their eyes are open they see this thing completely different if it took a revelation for the wise man it takes a revelation for our own children we're not just something different or we've got the messages no it still takes a revelation to see what this message is you cannot run this through the filter of some idea and some denomination or some movement or some other thing you can't this doesn't compare with anything else this is different this is the kingdom of god coming to us it didn't look like it but it is it takes a revelation the wise men run going in the camels completely across by the way you drove in a much more comfortable situation this morning you certainly did you ought to say thank you lord for my nice lincoln or whatever you guys got thank you lord a lot more comfortable you look on the movie and you see these guys on these camels and i'm thinking two years with your hips going like this it's pretty rough there's only one answer to it they were seeking the king of kings nothing was going to stop them praise the lord and the shepherds were seeking and they it should have been shepherds because the lamb was coming they were seeking the true lamb the wise men are seeking the true king they were seeking the king and when they arrived it was in this is what i said last sunday when they arrived it was in it was a baby it was in infant form if i can say it that way the king of kings and all that he would be and all that he was was in potential form in a baby but guess what when they arrived and got down on their knees they weren't disappointed that it was a baby because they had a revelation that everything that i need is in that baby see when we come to church and we're seeking the right way we're never disappointed if people are coming to church for the right reasons they're never disappointed but if they're coming for the wrong reasons they can be disappointed they can be critical they can be they keep thinking about everything what everybody's wearing or what whatever you see you got to get everything off of your mind can you say man and come to church for one reason i come because i want to be in the presence of the king i want to see the lord i want to worship and i want to grow and i want to change i want to be different than what i was last week there's a way to come to church can you say amen and might i say it this morning because we're a tad stew starchy might i say there's a way to come and worship the church too we don't come as some type of starchy thing but we come this is one place in the world we can open up our hearts and express ourselves to god freely if we can't do it here then where can we do it you should be able to do it in your homes but if you don't have any other place you ought to feel free here you ought to say i can bring my problems i can bring my burdens i can bring anything before god he's not afraid of any of it can you say man there's a way to come to church but not only can i bring my problems i can bring the best of my worship for the lord amen praise the lord they seen it in potential form but they weren't disappointed they started to worship anyway because everything they needed was in that baby she was holding what is it you're holding with this message amen what is it that we're holding so god once again now to bring it up to date god once again has given to us in the last days a virgin-born word of god untouched by man's hands you realize that right jesus was untouched by man's hands the religions didn't have anything to do with it mary didn't have anything to do with it joseph didn't have anything to do with it this was a virgin untouched by man's hands and that's the way god has to have it to bring his kingdom has to be pure has to be untouched it can't originate in a denomination and it is so similar if not the same thing when he births his word and brings it to the last days it can't be micromanaged by a denominational system it can't come through a filter of a board meeting to decide this or that the other it just comes in its simplicity and humility not even william branham this is untouched by william branham if you have a revelation this is this is his kingdom coming to us again and we know he always brings it through a vessel we understand that but it's still untouched by man's hands it comes pure can you say amen i ask you what is this baby that you're holding what is this message that you're holding i'll tell you it's god's kingdom coming back to the earth again and the reason we know that he had to come back this way is because our condition in the last days got away from him again what about all the conditions of laodicea what about all the conditions of our world i'm going to talk about it today just a little bit look at the condition of the world that we're in look where we're at even different from the 60s when this word was birthed back to us again look at where we're at today first of all none of us expected to be here but we're still here look at the condition that we're in trust politicians can't trust anything lie through their teeth this message this word is exactly what we needed praise the lord untouched by denominations and politics virgin i asked you this morning again what is it that you're holding or are you even holding it but if you're holding it what are you holding when we see the state that we're in and and we see the conditions of the world then the believers start to get to seeking and they don't stop at the son of man they don't stop at the son of david our text shows that them doing this in the last days they're seeking the lord and seeking david the king because because he is all three and we must seek all three i'm going to say something just to us this morning that i'm seeking more than just the theme that god sent a prophet son of man my heart i'm saying that i'm not intellectually doing it my heart is seeking more than that my heart is seeking more than son of god which the prophet said was the holy spirit and the people for two thousand years the holy ghost and the people invisible god invisible in the people but it was the spirit of god and so now it's a baptism in the holy ghost the true baptism of holy ghost and i've had that for years if you don't have that seek the lord for it can you say amen but my heart is seeking more than just having services to encourage just the baptism of the holy ghost my heart is seeking more than just a healing another healing line we're not here just to reinvent another temp meeting from the pentecostal days we're not here to repeat azusa street we're we're seeking something deeper there's more in this message than just a baptism of the holy ghost that is not the end is that okay with everybody we have to be seeking more because there is more and it's not that we're seeking something that's not in there it lays in there can you say amen and so we can create any kind of atmosphere we want to create anything but my emphasis as a pastor my emphasis is not just to have another repeat of pentecost and work up in motion and or try to bring an atmosphere just just to preach the baptism of the holy ghost because we have that but we have something more that god is bringing us all to individually i'm seeking for the character of the king you can preach the people under any expectations can you say amen but we have to really pray that we make sure we preach the people under the right expectations amen help me lord so look at the conditions again being without a really a revealer of truth let's look at the conditions back here again the israel had done meant it said went many days without certain things they had many went many days i think that's very significant they went many days without a king and many days without a prince without a sacrifice and so conditions increase to be worse when you're without a revealer and without the things that are needed and things that are uh you know when you're without something for so long but then god starts to show what you need then then you know it's kind of like when you're without something you appreciate the real thing when it comes so it's not so mad you know i don't want to beat anybody over the head for being through a season of your life when when you got distant or you're without things and you get maybe you got really distant from the essential things god's given us in this age you got real distant for there's there's one good thing that comes out of it is you see a the law of contrast how this morning would we ever appreciate a godly woman and many of them sitting here godly not just dress godly but just godly in their character and just so many things how would we appreciate that more if we didn't see the kind of women that are out there today every day in front of us brothers how many of you raise your hand when you see and when you've come from the world and you knew women and maybe you were with women and you've seen all the wrong side of it then you come around the body of christ and you you start to get a greater appreciation a greater value can you say amen because you were without being able to see a godly woman but now you can see it and now you value it more i wonder sometimes if we don't value that enough amongst our own congregation i wonder if our husbands we don't appreciate our godly wives enough to realize if you had a contrast you'd see she's a she has a lot more in her than what you realize you can look at her weaknesses you can look at all of her downsides and she can look at yours and you can nitpick at them but when we step back and look at things we can say praise the lord there they got something in them that the world didn't give and the world can't take away we have to see the value of what we got and some people they have to see a contrast to see what what the wisdom of this world does to you what the fashions of this world does to you what the friends of the world can do to you i'm just saying and so it's not so bad that we see as israel they were without things they were without the lamb they were without true worship they were without a king they were without leadership they were without and you go enough being without the right things then all of a sudden if you're of god you start to seek the right thing and that's all god needs i've seen that i've seen enough of it i'm seeking something different and that's all god needs can you say amen that can encourage you to seek when we see a contrast when you see a holy girl holy woman we can take it for granted sometimes among ourselves but when you've been around the wrong kind of woman your whole life you value a real woman of god and i'll say it again we have so many that's here this morning young and old that are holding up the banner of true genuine dignity of true womanhood these are these are not these are not just some criticism of some cultist thing this is what god intended for women to be and god bless every one of you sisters that are holding that up in this generation god bless you [Applause] but look how long they were without all their connection to god and the lamb the king and then there was some some bad things that they tried to connect with so let me just show you something here okay get your bibles and the days of judges is a great example of being without a lot of things they were so far away from god and incidentally i'd like to turn to judges 17 first incidentally god still blessed them during this time to give them judges not necessarily prophets or kings they were without a king now and god gave them when they cried out to the lord god gave them temporary deliverance through judges god gave them temporary deliverance but not major prophets not kings just ordinary people god raised up in joshua's judge's day judges 17 and you find a couple examples here that show that the people were without they were without if you go through the whole book of judges he temporarily provided judges and deliverers but they were basically without and and don't forget it's great that god provides temporary deliverance but we don't just want temporary deliverance the days of judges god in his grace gave temporary deliverers but no king no major profit so no matter how good the temporary deliverance was they would ultimately need a major profit and a major king leadership how many would admit this morning no matter how good a temporary deliverance is i'd rather have a total deliverance than a temporary deliverance because that can only go for so long and get the end of the judges and you look judges chapter 17 verse one there was a man of mount ephraim whose name was micah micah and he said unto his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from the about which thou cursed us and spake us also in thy ears behold the silver is with me i took it and his mother said blessed be thou this lord my son very religious here and when he had restored the 1100 shackles of his mother his mother said i have wholly dedicated the silver unto the lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image now therefore i will restore it unto thee now notice have no graven image before thee i thought the commandment said but they are so far away from god and so hungry for something from god the mom is willing to take this money and make and buy and have them make a molten graven image within her home yet he restored the money unto his mother verse 4 and his mother took 200 shekels of silver and gave them to the founder who made there of a graven image and a molten image and they were in the house of micah and the my man micah had a house of gods and made made in ephod you remember our texts and a terrifying remember our text and con consecrated one of his sons who became his priest now is this right no but it comes from this state that they are in without a prophet without a king without a connection to god and be careful friends of what you turn to or what you try to create on your own to try to get a temporary satisfaction that i'm connecting with god you don't have to do that this morning every one of you do not have to go through any priest or anybody to talk to the king when we in this service and you bring your heart before god you have a direct line to the king of kings you are speaking directly to him you don't need a graven image you don't need a you don't need a quote book to talk to god can you say man you don't even need your bible we love our bibles we read them it helps us can you say amen but a bible is just a helper to come to a revelation and to know the king you don't have to go through that or use a crutch you can come directly to him praise the lord so they made up these graven images and they did it in the home and boy we could preach a long time about how people find their own religious stuff online to make them feel better and ditch the message i know i'm being straight with you and i know i'm being straight i know that i'm doing that because this in the bible speaks of many of us sometimes who out of a a desire create our own thing when you don't have to it's just the condition you're so far away micah you're so far away that and look at verse six here's the problem here's the problem in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes even though god was around to bring temporary deliverance the condition was there's no key they got away from the leadership and so they're so far away that they don't even know how far away they are so this condition they bring a graven image they set up their own priests i'll take one of my sons and make him a preacher i'll do what needs to be done he's not called but i'll call him because we just have this need and they didn't have to do that look what it says in chapter 18 and verse 1 in those days chapter 18 there was no king in israel and in those days the tribe of the danites saw them in an inheritance to dwell in so that's that's all i want just to catch the theme chapter 19 and verse 1 and it came to pass in those days this is the days without a king this is days that maybe you've had in your life this is days without how many can raise your hand if not physically but in your heart i've been in these days before i've been probably from my own choices i've lived through the days without and i don't want to be there anymore they came to ask in those days when there was no king in israel that there was a certain levite sojourn on the side of the mountain and ephraim and all these things go into little stories at the end of judges of the people but the real issue is there was no king and so they were just trying to do everything they could with the levites and priests and graven images and everything they could do to try to try to create something and it just speaks sometimes of our nature getting in the way our old nature getting in the way to try to come up with something new or try to come up with something that that we just feel uh the thing and we've just done a message on on on guilt and even guilt even guilt satan's guilt can make us do things and try to create things and try to do things to relieve our own guilt and yet all the time god is saying i'll take care of your guilt don't come up with something new i'll take care of it i've washed your sins away and even the feeling of guilt if you'll get in my peace and in my word and you'll stay just in that channel you can rest and you don't have to live with the guilt from the enemy turn with me to second chronicles chapter 15. one more example of the people so far away second chronicles 15. ii chronicles 15 and verse 3 now for a long season israel hath been without the true god and without a teaching priest and without law wow all the things god provided for them and for for a long season they had been without it without the true god without a teaching priest without the law but when they in their trouble did turn into the lord of israel and sought him he was found of them and in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in but great vacations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries and nation was destroyed of nation city of city for god did vex them with all adversity so here's another element of it all right if you're without god and you're not getting anywhere where god is and you're without a teaching priest with maybe you're chose to be without the five full ministry in your life without the true ministers of the gospel without the law away from the word you're going to start feeling vexation of spirit so this is another thing that wow you know it's one thing to step away a little bit it's another thing to deal with vexation of spirit which is the state of being annoyed or frustrated or worried torment is the other word now friends we are not called to live in torment okay i have been well i i i know all those things annoyed frustrated worried tormented been there done that got the t-shirt been there and incidentally i might say to you those who experience these things you'd be surprised how sometimes the person next to you is experiencing some of the same things sometimes as the devil doesn't like us and he's given us a greater battle to make us question who we are to make us question our position and so he tries to make you overly annoyed or worried about things that's the devil's work but sometimes sometimes it's that we're not exposing ourselves enough to the true god to the true priesthood to the true things god has provided in the end time in order to drive away those torments can you say amen do you realize that while i'm preaching this morning that i can cast out devils while i'm preaching i don't have to have a big prayer line and i'm not knocking that sometimes we need to do that but i don't have to do it while i'm preaching the word the devil's afraid of this word the enemy's afraid can you say amen like our brother kyle said this morning they're afraid of us can you say amen they're begging for mercy this morning while this word it's not paul lafontaine but this word is all powerful against the demonic realm and whether that's depression or worry or fear this word that i'm preaching demons scatter from it you got to realize that they're crying for mercy right now the devil's whispering to you why did you come today why did you come i told you not to come there why did you come i'm begging for mercy get up right now you got to go to the bathroom or something get up get out of here get out as quick as you can they're crying for mercy not because of this fat preacher but because this word this word that i'm holding is god's answer for depression and fear it is god's answer for vexation of spirit he has provided all the atmosphere i need to be at peace and he's provided that for you this morning this is the prince of peace this is the king of peace this word that we hold had his presence in it and he provides the peace and when the people turn to the lord look what happens now after he says god did vex them with all adversity and great vexations we could spend a lot more time on that but why was it they lost their connection to god that's our day and the king becomes the answer but verse 7 says be strong therefore and let not your hands be weak for your work shall be rewarded and when asa heard these words and the prophecy of obed the prophet he took courage and put away the abominable idols out of the land of judah and benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken from mount rey from and renew the altar of the lord that was before the porch of the lord and he gathered all judah and benjamin and the strangers with them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of the simeon for they fell to him out of israel in abundance when they saw that the lord his god was with him who was god with a king that loved god and and who said let's get rid of the idols let's get rid of the graven images let's get together and create an atmosphere here we're all in this together they needed a king and they got the right king the answer was a king a godly king [Applause] yep so they gather themselves together that's why we come to church thank you for being here this morning because no matter what the devil's been trying to tell you i believe that just being in the presence of the licks of fire can be helpful to you this morning don't ever stop coming find a church of your choice find somewhere where the presence of god is moving and you're getting fed and be there be there they gather themselves together at jerusalem in the third month in the 15th year of the age of 8 sorry i'm finishing this but i just want you to see what the king did and they offered unto the lord the same time of the spoil which had brought 700 oxen and 7 000 sheep and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul what's it about seeking that whosoever would not seek the lord of god should be put to death whether great or small whether man or woman now that's kind of a forced thing and i wouldn't go for that because it has to be in your heart but i will make the point that whosoever would not seek the lord there was death and i'll just say that respectfully if you don't say lord put something in my heart to seek more of you spiritual death happens this is important not for just me or the word pro or next to you but for you personally that i'm going to seek the lord and the bible says if we draw nigh to him he will draw nigh to us that's just it but what about all the stuff that i need what about stuff i can't figure out what about the stuff that i don't want to do yet it just says draw nigh to him seek him [Music] he'll figure it all out for you and they swear unto the lord with a loud voice with shouting with trumpets and with cornets i never thought of that about about that josiah we got the cornets here this morning good to have you amen the shouting the trumpets this is pretty this isn't just a just a formal confession this is seeking the lord bring the instruments in bring the very best bring the worship in jump right in why we're seeking the lord praise be to god i'm feeling good this morning some of you are waking up and it's great man i can see you woke up and all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found of them and the lord gave them rest round about and also concerning menika the mother of ace of the king he removed her from being queen because she was one that was messing up he moved removed his own mom because she had made an idol in the grove yeah sometimes family members can get in the way of you seeking the lord sometimes mama's not being that great of a blessing to you what a terrible thing to say after christmas day but be alert this is your own personal walk with god this guy had to remove his mom from being in that position because he was influencing the country the wrong way asa cut down her idol and stamped it and burned it at the brook kid run but the high gates were not taken out of israel nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect all of his days praise be to god you know what the answer was a godly king we'll stop these idols we'll go through our home we're getting rid of this stuff that brings vexations we're going to be we're going to choose by the holy ghost what movies to watch and what not to watch we're going to choose by the holy ghost and not by our own feelings we're going to be very choosy here because you know a graven image is a graven image and it's a vision and it's a television and that can bring the television is not the problem it's the images that are on the television graven images that our heart seeks after come on somebody this is the hour you live in and let's talk about the computer oh let's never mind the commuter let's talk about your phone let's talk about the graven images on your phone this morning but when aza the king came the people responded and said we're going to crush these things we're going to get them out of our lives the wrong images were going to crush the image part of it because why this thing has brought us to vexation of spirit this thing has not brought us closer to god this thing is only taking me further away from god so why do you keep doing it if it's taking you away from god i don't know that your neighbor doesn't know that nobody knows only you know that but if you're honest this thing's taken me away from my god it is time to crush that image because i'm seeking god i'm through with this thing i'm i'm done with this thing i won't read the statistics but look at all the science coming out now about social media and the effect on teenagers in every age but especially on young teens to where even some of the experts are saying parents you have got to limit this the the result of this is not turning out good and the bible's saying it all along have no other image before you i would say if you draw away from that social media and be be use the holy ghost to choose what's encouraging and what's right i say if you draw away you might have less and less and less vexation and depression i know some of you were happier without it when we didn't have it 20 years ago or whenever it was whenever it came you were just free or you were happier i'm just telling you something has affected us this is about seeking the lord while he may be found you know i like preaching this because i know that every person here i believe with all my heart already has the desire to seek more of the lord god put that there god created that in there lebron said to a woman in the back she went back to prayed for and went in the back she sat down and she's just praying beside another woman another woman is just praying about this certain need it's hidden you know she's praying for it she's just speak to the lord and the prophet says back to her what she's saying to the lord he says don't forget sister you speak it don't forget it's god that created in you that desire to say that and desire that use the word create because he's the creator he's not creating the moon and the stars now he's done with that he's creating in his people his kingdom you he's creating it now does this kingdom come slow or does it come fast it always comes slow it's never fast enough how long did it take jesus to get here how long did the conditions go on in egypt before god sent a prophet how long sometimes will god allow your situation to go and go and go and go until he steps on the scene be patient the answer's coming amen praise the lord look at our conditions here at christmas look at our fear-driven world no wonder we have some fears because we have a fear-driven world fear-driven media a fear-driven presidency all due respect friends the first of the year we'll probably go off of facebook and go off of youtube because i get sometimes the alert that we're going to be scanned more and more and flagged but i just want to let this congregation know we may do that and we'll just have our archives on our website but i am not afraid to continue to speak the truth i am not afraid i will not be intimidated by the condition and the fear of this world i want to say it like it is we have a fear-driven leadership in our country remember that's respectful to everyone's personal choice of what they do and how they live that's that's all but in this pulpit we want to have the liberty to speak are they going to come and scan it anyway someday or they come possibly and take me to jail probably but until they do i want the liberty in my heart to call things what they are through through only the spirit of the lord look at the conditions look at look at the alternatives to christendom to cause a person to to to leave truth and go to some alternative i can serve god my own way look at the woke the woke culture look at the cancel culture woke is in a way it started as an awareness to injustices in this world now it's not the meaning is not an awareness of the injustice it's an acting upon injustices in other words it's turned into violence in other words there's injustices in this world which they've always been because their people are without god and the people are just waking up to it not really not christian christians have all been awake to the injustice of the world people wake up but it's not good enough just to wake up to it it's to take things in your own hands to become violent about it to disagree about it never have we been in a time with more division and more disagreement and more disrespectful things being said to one another on social media and around this world disrespect for the president cussing at the president i think it's a shame that we've come to this but remember it's the spirit of our nation woke is not just some new movement it's the spirit that's on the people and we just have to make sure we don't take that spirit the woke culture has become council culture and that means now that you if you if somebody said something wrong 20 years ago i can cancel you i'm canceling you i'm canceling this show i'm canceling this the problem with that spirit if you go with it is is as unbelievers will start canceling the word of god and start canceling if there was a prophet in this day and start canceling the message because they have a right to i'm just canceling there's been a lot of people that's just canceled me i'm canceling you because i can i don't have to listen to you anymore what do you say in this world because this is my heart this is a spirit in our nation we are not called to take the spirit of our nation we're called to a completely different kingdom is that okay if you study real hard the statistics will show that real change and decline in our country was mostly in the 1960s it began it was building up but a real change came in the 60s the spirit of the last days took the people but i'm happy to say during the same time we received something we receive a kingdom that cannot be removed we received not another reformer not a man but another kingdom and when we received it it means the king is speaking we receive the son of man we receive the son of god but we receive the son of david as well can you say amen and so we're just in transition i'm going to read a couple quotes and i'm going to finish just now i appreciate your attention this morning how many would want to say i want a greater seeking of the lord and the king david just to be in harmony here with the seeking the king the first quote he says but what we have today what have we got today with our own voting and politics and things we set the system that we run from and made a nation out of it here we've brought it back in here because it's the desire of the people and of course he's referring to the voting being manipulated in the 60s when it come to uh john f kennedy and these different things and friends if if there had proof of voting being manipulated back then then i i would say it's still happening today but now and then he says this right now i'm neither democrat or republican i'm a christian the whole thing is polluted i cast my vote on jesus christ amen on this rock i'll stand all other grounds is sinking sand yes sir friends we are not promised a system jesus wouldn't have nothing to do with the system we wasn't promised a system we were promised what he was he promised what was it he promised a kingdom how do you get into it by one spirit we're all baptized into this kingdom it's the kingdom of god a kingdom of eternal life with an eternal king giving forth his eternal word with an eternal people predestinated to eternal life he's the king we're baptized into it sitting in heavenly glory we are dead our lives are hid in god through christ and not only that but we are raised with him raised up what in a system a denomination organization we are resurrected in the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is within you why all these man-made systems must fall not once more i'll shake the world but i'll shake the heavens and those things that cannot be shook is what will remain and we receive a kingdom receiving a kingdom that cannot be shook or moved that's the kingdom of god not a system not a political wheel not a denomination but a kingdom amen and its subjects is dead to the systems of this world its subjects are dead to these organizations it's dead to these political systems and it's alive and resurrected by the power of the king have you heard what he said this morning what he's saying what god has given us is separate than any system of this world don't ever compare it don't ever try to bring it together don't try to figure it out that way we received a completely different baby this is not an ordinary baby it's not attached to any system this is the kingdom of god that's come to us look what he says here oh i love him i'm so glad to be one of them i'm so glad to be dead in christ alive in the kingdom of god this is not my home we seek a kingdom we seek the king can you say a man this morning we seek the king we're already in the kingdom we're seeking the king to come and the king quickly will come to his kingdom we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved all these other things are falling apart america is falling apart europe is falling apart asia is falling apart all the world is falling apart but we are in a kingdom in the eternal kingdom it cannot be moved amen where christmas is every day amen living in the presence of the king praise the lord the last one here says like a man and a woman they're both human beings but a woman has a different characteristic to a man i was reading here some time ago about solomon and the queen i've never got around to preaching my little text here to you on the queen of the south coming up to see solomon and seeing the gift of discernment i was reading about that here not long ago and they said that one of the puzzles that was put before solomon was this queen took a woman or a woman rather and dressed them like a man now that was foreign in that day but it is certainly up to date today this is in a history book that brother bran read of one of the tests that they gave solomon the woman of the south and i know he says now that was foreign in the day but it's certainly up to date today and you know that's wrong the bible said that a woman shouldn't do that it's abomination for a woman to put on a garment pertains to a man the unchangeable god said that's true so that is true so we find out that solomon no more than watched them he had them to walk or do something and immediately he says it's a woman he's dressed like a man so he could tell by the characteristic of that woman the way she handled herself that she was a woman and not a man well the country has certainly lost the discernment of solomon the government has lost the discernment of solomon common sense discernment can you say amen and they are known there by their characteristic one acts like a woman one acts like a man and if you dress them different hello wake up and smell the coffee they're not different i mean they're not you know they're not you can't make a man a woman or a woman a man how perverted and pitiful do we have efforts of laws being changed but put a man as a olympic swimmer competing with girls because he says he's a girl and he's beating all the other women and people are complaining in the government and all the officials say but if he says it he is what a world we live in what is shame but brother abraham's point here is that you can tell if you can't by the outside there's characteristics that make a woman a woman there's characteristics that make a man a man so we find out solomon no more than watched them he had them to walk or do something i mean he says that's a woman so he could tell by the characteristic of that woman the way she handled herself that she was woman and not man and then most anything that way it's the characteristics i might drop a little point here jesus said matthew 24. the characteristics of the spirit would be in the end time now somewhat in the last day alike in the last days so close that it would deceive the very elected if it was possible see they would just you take your hand and just hold it up see if you don't notice one of them looks like the other in another way but one of them is left and the other one is right that's the way the spirits are in the last day they are somewhat alike but they have a characteristic that identifies them one is right and the other one is wrong and it can't be it can be identified by its characteristic no matter how close the spirit of true christianity and false christianity no matter how close it looks on the outside the characteristics will tell the difference and we'll be able to tell the spirit of god can be identified by its characteristics see the spirit of god in the spirit of the church there is a church spirit and the spirit of god that's absolutely not like the church spirit at all there is a denominational spirit we don't want a church spirit can you say man we want the true spirit of god we don't want a denominational spirit we want the true spirit of god and they are different there's a national spirit there's a spirit of the nation here not long ago i was going with my wife when we still lived in indiana a couple years ago over to the little supermarket i just come home we had to get some food and on my road over there it was the summer time you might not believe it but we found a lady had a dress on and it was so strange it shocked me i said look at there that looks strange that woman is wearing a dress the rest of them was wearing clothing that not becoming to a woman and she and she said i said well that's just the american spirit see the spirit of america now the spirit of america is supposed to be a christian nation but the spirit of this nation is not christian can you take that this morning no no we're not a christian nation anymore and the spirit that motivates americans is not a christian spirit it's giving it's vanilla benevolent it's all that which is great i'm happy for giving people but that is always the spirit of america and the spirit of patriotism is not the spirit of god it's something different the spirit of america is supposed to be a christian nation but the spirit of this nation not christian might be called a christian nation but it's a million miles from it it's in 1964. so this woman said i said she said well aren't we his wife said to him next to him aren't we americans said i said no we live here this is our country we stay in it we love it it's the best nation in the world i say amen to all that but yet we're not americans i know what you'd say this morning but i'm an american i'm glad to be i'm proud to be america i'm proud to be i'm not knocking any of that i'm just saying what the prophet said by spirit by spirit we have to be something different than american you can't run it all together i think that happened a year ago when we had a different president people were so upset and all this because they thought you know trump is the answer and he's he's christian and he's all this stuff that's gonna stop judging things by politicians whether they be by nor trump look in the word of god and order your life by the word because brotherhood says it's all corrupt no trust in that the days that we have to live in peace as best we can i thank god for it every day i thank god that at night i don't hear a lot of noise around my house and stuff but i know enough to know the word that may all change someday our liberties may all change someday but i i certainly thank god for it now that we still have some liberties left to be able to serve god worship god not a lot of countries have that we are born so we we we are not americans i said we are born from above the holy spirit come down and we belong to a kingdom it's not of this world i said that's the reason that our sisters wear dresses wear long hair don't wear makeup remember he's talking to his wife about uh dress and things in this woman on the street wearing a dress he's trying to say we're from a different kingdom that's why we're expressing the image of a different kingdom that's why he says to do that but when he says we don't wear makeup we don't have we don't cut our hair we don't we wear dresses see their characteristics identifying this holiness unto the lord from above he's telling his wife that it's not just these quotes get read and all the time we think well you know that's the kingdom as ones that were wearing dresses is it's so much even more than that let's talk about the men can you say amen men who don't cheat on their taxes men who lead their ways in their homes in a godly way men who are not born to looking at other women and bound by some type of addiction we can preach about dresses all day long and it's the truth it's the reason god gave it to this thing is because we're from a different kingdom do you realize what he's saying there you realize what he's saying he's saying what i'm preaching is that when we receive this message it was god bringing another kingdom to us now we've got people walking on the face of the earth that's already expressing that kingdom god bless you for it but it's not just dresses and hair it's not just we don't wear makeup the beauty of a true godly woman doesn't need all this makeup you're too pretty to put that stuff on you're just too pretty because god made you beautiful don't question how god made you got a little blemish or something and you got to put a little something to cover your blemish go right ahead but don't paint yourself up like a barn because god's made you a lot prettier than what you're reading on the internet you're beautiful the way god made you is it okay for a pastor to say that i don't know god's eyes you're beautiful don't question it don't take your cues from the cosmos what's he saying this stuff is the kingdom of god coming back to us and it's just like men don't do this men don't do that well it's not do's and don'ts it's that we're from a different kingdom we're from a different kingdom therefore we are seeking a kingdom we are seeking a king to come and receive a subject to his kingdom and they are identified by their characteristics that their treasures everybody listening last quote and this is it they are identified but how do i tell the ones that are growing towards this millennium kingdom they're identified by their characteristics that their treasures are not of this earth or of this nation it's of above in glory your life this coming year our lives should say something not just our words but our lives say our characteristics say we're seeking another kingdom we're seeking a king the characteristics of our lives should show that he is coming and we are preparing for him and to show that he is coming we are showing the characteristics of the kingdom now it's not about young couples young men young women it's not about the treasures of this earth it's not about this nation and the politics we have a whole different kingdom praise the lord you've been quiet today and that's all right so this is a story here that i'm going to end with all the children want to be listening to this some children were in play in their playground one day when a herald rode through the town blowing a trumpet and crying aloud the king the king passes by the road today make ready for the king the children stopped their play and looked at one another did you hear that they said the king is coming he may look over the wall and see our playground who knows we must put it in order the king is coming all the kids decided to act upon the announcement that the king is coming to get our playground in order for the king the playground was sadly dirty and in the corners were scraps of paper and broken toys for these were careless children but now one brought a hole and another a rake and a third rand to fetch the wheelbarrow from behind the garden gate and they labored hard to let length all was clean and tidy now it is clean they said but we must make it pretty too for the kings are used to find things maybe he would not notice mere cleanliness for he may have it all the time maybe he will excuse me maybe he would not notice mere this for he may have it all the time then one brought sweet rushes and shrewed them in the ground and others made garlands of oak leaves and pine tassels and hung them on the walls and the littlest one pulled marigold buds and threw them all about the playground to make it look like gold for the king when all was done the playground was so beautiful that the children stood and looked at it and clapped their hands with pleasure let us keep it always like this said the littlest one and others cried yes yes that is what we will do let's keep it always like this they waited all day for the coming of the king but he never came only towards sunset a man with travel worn clothes and a kind tired face passed along the road and stopped to look over the wall what a pleasant place said the man may i come in and arrest your children the children brought him in gladly and set him on the seat that they had made out of the old cask they had covered it with old red cloak to make it look like a throne and it made a very good one let him sit there it is our playground they said we made it pretty for the king but he did not come and now we mean to keep it so for ourselves that is good said the men the man because we think they said because we because we think pretty and clean is nicer than ugly and dirty and the man said that is better and for tired people to rest in the littlest one said that is the best of all said the man he sat and rested and looked at the children with such kind eyes that they came about him told him all they knew about the five puppies in the barn and the thrush's nest and the four blue blue eggs with the four blue eggs and the shore where the gold shells grew and the man nodded and understood all about it by and by he asked for a cup of water and they brought it to him in the best cup with the gold sprigs on it then he thanked the children and rose and went on his way before but before he went he laid his hand on their heads for a moment and the touch went warm to their hearts the children stood by the wall and watched the man as he went slowly along the sun was setting and the light fell in long slanting rays across the road he looked so tired said one of the children he looked so tired but another said but he was so kind see said the littlest child see see how the sun shines on his hair it looks like a crown of gold jesus said insomuch as you've done it unto the least of my brethren you have done it unto me the word says some of entertain angels unaware so the kids prepared not only in their preparation to make it nice for the king when he comes but they also begin to work together showing the character of the king and the character of working together and the care for one another they already had that atmosphere going that the king could be comfortable with i think god has given us a wonderful message and i think it's his kingdom that has come to us and i think we should take it back to our playgrounds and use the word to prepare for the king i think we should work together i think if we say the love we love the lord i think we should love one another i think if we brother brown says it's the characteristics that we can tell the difference i think we should say lord i'm seeking the king but may the characteristics of the king be seen in me every day royalty showing itself with my family with how we treat one another on the playground i don't know how your playground looks this morning but i can tell you the king is coming and you need to go back to your playground say lord if there's anything in here that displeases you i'm preparing my playground for the king i got a throne and i've got this and i've made it nice and i'm everything in my life says to the world i'm seeking a king to come real soon how many wants that this morning amen let's stand and pray want to live the way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to love love to there's just no more love for i could never ever the lord [Music] i want to live the way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more [Music] no more [Music] just bow your heads just a minute one of the things i enjoy sometimes about studying the message it's not just all the powerful restoration of the word he's given us making the bible a new book to me but i watch a man's life grow into adoption i watch him say things and hear him say things like i want to live so that the at least little bit of grieving that i've done to the lord i would know it right away and i'd be so sensitive to i'd be able to make it right right away don't forget friends this is a prophet but he says i grieve the spirit sometimes but i at least want to know what i want to call a month i don't want to go a year i want to be sensitive to the king that as soon as i grieve his spirit i would know it and make it right whether that's a thought or i spoke too harshly to someone held bitterness on my heart [Music] these are the things that the characteristics of a kingdom people i just raised my hand to the lord say god may i surrender the inner things of my life i can express the character of the king that is soon coming [Music] it's not a sign it's a surrender i'm not looking for some sign from the lord he just asked for a surrender how many raise your hand and say i surrender i want to live the way he wants me to live god bless you say well i don't know what i have i don't know what i need and i i don't know what i'm lacking god knows what you're lacking god knows what you still need leave that in his hands just surrender yourself [Music] the people in the last days sought king david and they sought the lord and they were restored and they had peace amongst themselves and in their kingdom because they began to seek the king heavenly father this is my heart lord the last couple weeks i've spoken to you several times just saying lord what is it lord that we would be missing help me to be a pastor of an example of where we're going where this word is taking us i don't want to be the status quo i don't want to just be dwelling in the same things but lord where are you bringing us and lord start with me send a revival and start the work in me that's my prayer lord and this character of the kingdom that you have taught us let it be living in me and my everyday life and my little playground let it be let me set my house in order let me set my life in order and everything that it says my mind my heart everything says i am prepared and i am ready to receive this king at any time forgive us lord and we walk with you closer than we've ever walked change hearts lord move upon lives and this little story that i read is more for just it's not just the children lord but we all see changes that we want you to make to bring a kingdom people and a character in us it's about us working together it's about us preparing it's about us treating someone kind it's about the stranger lord that comes in and we give him the very best seat in the house and we gave him the king's cup shouldn't live any different than that every day should be the same mold that in me lord load it in these people take us for the lord take us deeper we ask these things in your precious name of the lord jesus christ let this word do its full work and completion in our lives we pray we commit that to you in jesus precious name thank you lord amen
