TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to read that text again finish a few things from last Sunday I wanted to say that we lost Sister Janice green and she was a the wife brother Perry green and she was just as brother Perry was a mentor to me especil to me in my early years 16 year old boy brother Perry gave me my first car when I was in Tucson and we went to the school there and did different things but she was very special to me as well she was a music lover a wonderful piano player and singer and was a mentor in the music field for me and I appreciate her so much I don't think I'll be able to attend the funeral but hopefully we can watch it online and I just want to say how much I appreciate the people that God's put in my life and Sister Janice was certainly one of them she was a lovely 89 I believe she was and we will miss her as a part of the body of Christ here and her singing her anointed singing she taught us to sing with anointing and sing and pray for the anointing to come when you sing and that's a great I was a great mentor to our family they supported us when we first went out there in Tucson and oh I can't remember what year that was Mom we first sang there at the convention brother Perry asked us to sing and we sang a song Thank you Lord for your blessings on me I think I was I don't know 14 maybe younger I don't know and uh that was before Sherry come along Sherry was born in Tucson actually later on and so there was singing going on before Sherry in the LaFontaine Family I always remind her of that but he asked us to sing in the convention and back then it was cassettes and those cassettes went around the world from that convention and then our invitations began to come in to come and sing and dad to minister and that's what kind of began the music Ministry but also dad's Ministry and we traveled the next I don't know 10 years of my life we traveled but it's because where the period asked us to sing there and really heavily anointed the song and it went out and was a blessing to people so we thank God for that and we appreciate Sister Janice green we pray God will comfort her family today I know most of you didn't know her but we like to honor those who have gone on to their reward and know that we're looking forward to seeing them on the other side amen psalms 27 again and we'll just pick it up here I want to I do want to pick up verse three because I'll be talking about that a little bit though and a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple every day he wanted to dwell in the dwelling place of the Lord and that was his one desire above money above riches above business above anything we need one main desire and that's to stay in the presence of the Lord for in the time of trouble now to me this is a prophetic scripture for our time and we know that in the history of Israel God's people Israel the Jews we know they they come to times of extreme trouble time of trouble Daniel speaks of a time of trouble for the children of Israel and uh so we we realize that will begin to climax towards we get to it getting to end time events the trouble will be that the whole world will surround Israel and come against Israel and the whole and armies will surround so now when when David says he's feeling that there's armies encamped about me Israel will go through the same thing in Prophecy that they'll be encamped or the enemy will be encamped around we spiritually go through what Israel will go through literally and so then he says one thing I ever desire the Lord and then he says in the time of trouble verse 5 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock that's that has a lot of Revelation in it to tell us where this is at number one it's the secret of his Tabernacle it's not out there publicly openly it'll be a secret as to where God's dwelling place is but for the people of God he will show them where he is so that they can live in his presence this last part I want to go he shall set me up upon a rock how many know in the Bible that rock means revelation so what do we what what is our secret place it's really the Revelation that God has given us and you know you can't give yourself a revelation it comes directly he told Peter he says flesh and blood has not revealed this you didn't learn it in seminary my father has given you this Revelation Satan kept getting can't get his grubby mitts on it but when he gives you a revelation it becomes the hiding place and it becomes the stability can you say amen and now shall mine head be lifted up above my enemies around about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing you know what a Believer does when he's surrounded by demon power he raises his hands his head's lifted above all of it and he just starts to praise the Lord and then the devil gets more mad can you say man I'm so glad in my trials and troubles I can lift my hands and give a song to the Lord amen praise the Lord I will sing yeah I will sing praises unto the Lord father blessed and anoint and strengthen Us in the word of God today we stand feeble without your help Lord and we stand weak without your strength to live and to preach and to and to minister Lord your love and to be a witness we're we're nothing without you and we thank you for the children who's ministered to the fathers today to give them an encouragement I pray for every father here and every father that's living listening Lord that you will give them an encouragement in their heart they've went through sacrifices Lord for the family and for the sake of the gospel and they they do things many many things every day that the children maybe don't see but today may they feel appreciated and Loud father and as you look down as the heavenly father you look at the fathers here and you can see the quiet sacrifices they're making to support their family to to bring bread on the table to administer correction when it's needed in love to administer encouragement when it's needed and to find those teachable moments that only a father seems like can give and to seize those teachable moments I'm so thankful for that I'm thankful for my Earthly father that I had but I'm also especially thankful for my heavenly father that has taken those teachable moments and taught me everything Lord that I have today we pray you'll Bless the people of God around the world as they gather today and feed on your word may you continue and Advance the Bride of Jesus Christ in the word and in the Revelation and in rapturing faith as we commit this service and this day to you in Jesus name we ask him amen praise the Lord God bless you you may be seated I want to title this today hide me in the safe place of Revelation hide me in the safe place of Revelation while the bride is called into a revelation for the Rapture and that's what we were saying last Sunday that it's actually a revelation of the Rapture is a revelation and this is the scripture that the prophet used to describe the Rapture time and it's a strange text but yet it has the mystery of rapture within there because just before our deliverance just before our ultimate deliverance we realize that the increased pressure the armies gathered around us the pressure will not decrease but it will increase so much so that sometimes mentally we don't know if we can handle it the only cry that we can cry is what David said hide me in your secret place during this time and I believe that's the the place that you're living in that develops this rapturing Faith builds this rapturing Faith but we know there's great pressure on the outside how many can say Amen there's great pressure on the outside the heat has been turned up on the Bride Can you say it's in such an increased State that's hard to Fathom how much more pressure can come and I just wanted to say this that if that pressure is too much for you and you want that pressure off of you then just stop standing up for the right things if you know if you can't handle the pressure of this hour then just stop standing for things because a lot of your pressure is because you're standing up for something you're standing for the message of the hour I'm going to elaborate on that a little bit later but but if you if you don't like the pressure stop him stop living a holy life I want to say that it's the one standing on Revelation that are being surrounded and encamped by demons the ones that are experiencing criticism heavy criticism is probably the ones that are making a stand and if you want an easy life without a lot of demons against you then just be a borderline believer today because there's a lot less pressure on a borderline believer but when a Believer makes a stand for the truth and wants to live in Holiness and live in sanctification instead I believe this message with all my heart get ready for more pressure it's the ones that are making a stand that get more criticism and if you can't take the heat stay out of the kitchen Bridge yeah you can release a lot of pressure can you say man you can get out of a lot of this if you don't make a stand for anything and you can you know you can be out of a lot of it matter of fact you can there's choices you can make to just to release a lot of pressure in your life and just kind of take the normal uh status of this world or maybe a borderline believer it'd be a lot less pressure than this but once you begin to stand once you begin to articulate and speak this message and speak what you believe whatever environment it is if you do that get ready for more pressure and it's not people as much as it is demons don't like somebody to make a stand amen so you know and and you got to take a stand for things you think that the trouble in this world is the economy or you think the trouble is the scare of War uh you think your trouble is you don't have enough money to meet your bills this week you think that's my trouble I don't have enough money that's not really your trouble when the Bible says it's a time of trouble it's not it's not that you can't meet your bills this week it's a much deeper trouble than that and I'm not belittling that trouble in your life we all have trouble but the trouble the Bible speaking of is not just that some friend forsake you or or you don't have enough money or you lost your job your trouble as standing for a Believer your trouble is a lot deeper than that David was talking about a much deeper trouble Army's encamped around him everything against him can you say amen and so the the scare of war and money trouble your trouble is not really that it's much deeper than that and last Sunday we left off with uh the uh the scary experience of a demon-possessed man coming against brother Branham and coming against the man of God and uh so I I don't have time to read all that but I made a point out of that as he came up to the platform broke up the services everybody got afraid preachers were running from the platform this happened back in Portland Oregon uh many many years ago and so he was demon-possessed he was a man that was just uh needed the Lord and so he come against the man of God just broken the jaw of a Preacher a few weeks before had come out of the insane Institution for some reason his direction for his persecution was against preachers probably grew up and some preacher heard him I don't know what happened but his he was zeroing in on preachers and so he broke a preacher's jaw and and was put back in the end then now he gets out again and he's interrupting this whole big meeting with about five or six thousand people there Everybody's scared everything but he's directing he's coming right up to the platform he's threatening and you know the story I'll break every bone in your body and this is a big man brother Brandon was a small man it was a very intense situation and we know the story how how that he stood there and stood firm and he says Divine love came over him and he loved the man he told the security guards not to get him he would he would just deal with it he wasn't afraid he's only probably the only person in the building that wasn't afraid of this demon power because there has to be something greater than us to not be afraid and that's Divine love that's the Holy Ghost Divine love for these situations of demon power it takes more than your strength to handle it it takes the Holy Ghost Divine love to respond can I get an amen this morning and that's what he said something come over him and he says I wish I could have that all the time but he stood flat-footed and that man kept throwing and come up hawked in his throat spit in his face two or three times um and they said later on I I think I missed this last Sunday they said later on after he was prayed for and delivered he says well he is he completely delivered is he healed he said no he'll he'll take that Spirit back again because he worships that spirit so that's a temporary Deliverance in the presence of God which I how much I wonder how much that happens today temporary Deliverance we don't want that we want complete deliverance but one of the points I was making last Sunday is and I'll go back here in my notes and read it just the way he said it he said and he rushed up towards me and he hawked down in his throat and spit right in my face I'll show that you're not a true man of God I'll break every bone in your body and one comment really reminisce it and see the devil was trying to get me to shake away from the atmosphere from that atmosphere that God was getting me in but it didn't bother me so I thought I'd read that again because the point that I was making besides all this demon power all over the building and coming against brother Branham which is what we Face a lot of times besides that it's not just that it would make accusations and and come against the man of God and threaten the man of God it's not just that Spirits sometimes have a desire to pull you down to pull you out of praise and worship to pull you out of where you want to live can you say Amen you're wanting to live in his presence you're wanting to live in his Joy Cal repurchase Joy so you're wanting to take that possession Cal repurchase peace for you and you're wanting to hold on to that peace there'll be efforts to try to pull you out of that atmosphere and as I mentioned the homosexual agenda is not just to go off and live that they wait the way they live they want us to accept them they want your children they want to influence can you say amen that's demon power it's not good enough just to persecute and bring accusations but they want to draw you into their world and incidentally let me mention that the scripture is very strong about an accusation against an elder you can look it up but when we when we have things uh being presented this way then we must realize the scary experience that it's one thing to have armies and capped about you let me just ask how many's felt that before just just in Camp David describes it you know it's it's it's everywhere everywhere I turn it just seems like there's things all the way around you it's one thing to have that pressure but it's another thing when they want to drag you down when they want to pull you in with them they want to draw you into the same fear that they're under they want to draw you into the same scare that they're under the same nervousness they want to draw you into the same gossip that they're partaking of the devil likes company so the devil wants to draw you into the same gossip they feel better if someone else will join in the gossip with them so that it's not good enough to gossip but it's they want to draw you in with the gossip they want to draw you into their opinion because they need allies they want to draw you down to their lies that they're telling they want to draw you to their concrete conclusions that may not be based in truth can I get an amen this morning it's it's it's an effort to bring you down and bring you into their Dimension and their realm and they want a war with you sometimes they want to battle they want to have a good scrap I've said it before there are people in life that they just like a good scrap every day and it doesn't matter who is around I live for a good scrap can you be the person please sister dong to scrap with me just a little bit I know she wouldn't she wouldn't join in with me with that I know her as a Godly woman but the devil wants to draw every day people just like to scrap about something my son so told me something a few weeks ago he said you know I'm learning that there are people that are that drama is so normal in their life they can't live without it I said son that is so true and Lord help me not to be that way drama and something going on in the church and this and that and the other and they they live in a soap opera and how many knows soap operas aren't real soap opera and they present that as real life but it's not really real life it's a soap opera people like soap operas going on the church wonder what the pastors why is he doing that why is he why is she doing that why she do it and so they they live in that because it's so normal to them if they come out of that they wouldn't know how to live yeah they like drama they're like a good scrap they're like a good fight they like competition between families they create it because you are a creator the pressure to choose sides to pull you down but then I go back to that scripture that David said God Is Lifting Me Above All these things can you say amen and I can raise my hand he's going to set me upon the rock of Revelation above mine enemies now when you say above it doesn't mean I'm better than my enemies but I'm above it in other words I can live above it I can live in that secret place I can live upon a rock and I got up on the chair last week I'm living up here and all down here they're saying come on down fight with us come on down into my fear I'm nervous about stuff can you be nervous with me no I'm not I'm just praising the Lord I will pray for you but I'm not coming down to that level you know that's not where I want to live and when God is Raising you to uh to higher levels get ready for more devils that was borrowed from borrowed from TD Jakes when you want to go to the next level get ready for more doubles because you can't go to the next level spiritually unless there's a fight to keep you away just the way it works because you're making a stand you're making a better stand you're making a higher stand and you don't want to be brought down how many would raise their hands say I don't want to be brought down by people living in fear I don't want to be living with a Jonah can you say amen I want to be praised in the Lord all the time no matter what I'm going through can you say Amen you get up here say no I'm not coming down there why don't you come up here with me and praise the Lord a while once you come out of that fear [Applause] so this is what I didn't get to from the quote last Sunday uh I didn't get to any of these so I'm getting it here here people want to fight and this is the way the prophet said this is so good the way he wanted to live he said let my neighbors gossip do you have this quote let my neighbors gossip let this that or the other be gone I go to church for one thing that's to stay in your presence I would love every believer to only come to church for that reason I'm finding Through The Years people are coming for all different agendas all different motives even for a religious Duty I don't think we should come to church for any of that I don't think we should come to church to be seen I don't think that we should come to church just to pay our tithes I don't think it's a religious Duty I don't think we come to church to see one another I don't think we come to church for any other reason to to be in the presence of the Lord no other motive no other agenda can you say man no drama I'm coming to church because I hungry for the word of God that's it I go to church for one thing that's to stay in your presence I am moved in there Lord I never desire to leave again I'll Trust your word what you say there's where I want to be drop the veils around me Lord that I can only see Jesus alone and live and walk and die in him there you are drop the veils all around me you know your Bible well enough to know that they come in that interview only the high priest could do that but after Calvary every believer can come into the presence of the Lord and not only that say drop the veils behind me so I'm not affected by the weather I'm not affected by the gossip I'm not affected by the chatter I'm living in the inner veil with all the veils dropped behind me that's what brother Brown says he wants to live I want to live or walk and die in him can you say Amen on Mount figuration how do I go back uh oh no on Mount Transfiguration you're helping me out up there aren't you technically challenged Pastor up here on Mount Transfiguration when Jesus stood transfigured before the apostles when they looked up they seen just Jesus alone they said they seen Jesus only standing there remember Moses and Elijah were there wow some pretty important men prophets of God but when this is all done it's not about the prophets it's about Jesus only people get hung up on only looking at a prophet the the prophet's influence all that Fades away especially when they go off the scene the word that he brought of Christ but you see John the Baptist come to introduce Jesus and John the Baptist says now that he's here I must decrease he must increase to where the bride is saying when I look at this message when I come to church I only I don't see friends I don't see families I don't see competitions I see Jesus only Hallelujah they said they've seen Jesus only standing there oh God hide me in that place hide me over in that place where all the veils will drop and I'll see nothing but Jesus himself I don't want to hear the Fantastics of the world notice how hidden he starts to talk about now you become so hidden in Christ that you don't care about the latest thing that's going on sisters you don't care about the latest fashions that are going on so hidden in Christ the devil doesn't know where to find you I don't care whether they got atomic bombs whether they got a Jet Plane whether the new whether the new Chevrolets look better than the Buicks now we laugh about this but this is the realm sometimes even Believers can get in say our minds which one's better and when I think about that which I do when I think about that it's not about Chevrolet's or Buicks it's about Fords but I told you I think I told you I told some people I drove around here for two or three years in a Toyota Tundra around Lambertville and I got looked down on because you only dry to drive a Ford F-150 around here then I drove by the toms and I said yeah it drives better so I got a Ford so sometimes your carnal this is the stuff we begin to think about and I don't mean carnal and bad way I'm just saying it takes away from our mind time it's not a sin to think about a Buick or well it might be but you know this is the stuff and that's why brother Brandon mentions it whether this is the mindset whether the new Chevrolets will work look better than the Buicks it doesn't matter the thing of it is I'm walking living with Christ daily and I've died yourself and the veils are dropped around and I am in he and he and me that's the most important thing let the storms rage my anchor holds within the veil can't tell you why we have a lot of storms of the season this day but I'm thankful for an anchor that holds steadfast within the veil when she is rocking and look like every move would send her to the bottom yet my anchor is in the veil I've anchored in the veil I've Anchored In Jesus the storms of life I will Brave I'm Anchored In Jesus I'll fear no wind or wave I'm Anchored In Jesus for he has power to save I've anchored in the Rock of Ages he shall set me up upon a rock of Revelation God help us this morning to enter into that inner life quit staying out here where you're tossed about by every wind of Doctrine every little thing that comes along look at that lesson stop being tossed about by every little thing that comes along it's the little foxes the spoil the vine it's not the big thing sometimes it's getting so obsessed with the little things little stuff is this really important I remember Amanda's dad brother Steve he used to minister here passed away but he used to talk about that little things that he said one time and I remember it he said he said you're squabbling and you're arguing over this it's such a little thing what's that going to mean two years from now what a wisdom it's like you are making this such a big issue and it won't even matter in six months it may not even matter next week and you're going back to why don't we argue over that it's a little thing kept you from your joy kept you from your peace pulled you out of the atmosphere you're supposed to be in let's not let the little things the wind of Doctrine toss us about can you say Amen this morning praise the Lord so the theme of I just want to go into this prophecy of Israel just a little bit the theme of Prophecy for Israel is to in Prophecy to become surrounded by the enemy literally the world against them and many Jews see and believe prophecy of Deliverance they believe it today that their Messiah will deliver them they believe the the Deliverance part but they don't see what comes before their Deliverance they don't understand that and there will be great armies gather around that uh that uh piece of land there and it's not because of the piece of land necessarily but it's who's there and God's people and so we see them that the armies I'm going to skip some of this because some of some of this is revisiting what I've already preached on before but I just wanted to bring in this element of Israel literally now and so if you turn with me to Daniel 12 we'll see something happen here when all the armies gather around just after all the armies uh in Prophecy all surround Israel in Daniel chapter 12 . if you turn with me there to verse 1 there's a little bit of Prophecy for Israel here I wanted to deal with we see then when it comes to this trouble and it's called This is Israel's time of trouble worse than any trouble they've had a lot of trouble but this is the worst time is when all nations will gather against them and it's it's a time of trouble like never seen before chapter 12 says then and at that time and this is a time where the pressure will come shall Michael stand up the great Prince would standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time now Israel had a lot of trouble through the years that's six thousand years of trouble they had times of trouble they had times when they went in Rebellion against God and they went into Babylon into captivity they had a lot of troubling times but this scripture says at the end they've never had any trouble compared to this trouble and I just look at that spiritually and say that for the bride spiritually there's no trouble like we're having now in the spiritual realm there's no other pressure like we're having now now you say brother Paul I don't know what you're talking about my life is good I'm doing pretty good I got a good salary and everything's pretty comfortable um so I'd only say to that what are you doing right I say that first but then I would say check your life because anybody who's making a stand and that's the elect of God the guns are pointed on you it says says now the the the the and it talks in the Bible here let me just finish this in the time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even at the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book notice now there's the elect written in the Book of Life so we got several reasons now why the armies are encamped around this particular people they're in the Book of Life I think you remember that when you're being surrounded can't you remember that there's a reason that I'm being fought with demons probably because my name is in the Book of Life and I'm the elected can you say Amen and I'm part of him and so the the Bible speaks of the King of the North he plays a big part which is Russia the King of the South with more than likely that's China we don't know that for for sure but it if it's if it's talking about geographically the King of the North Russia we know who that is King of the South China and if you don't think that China and Russia look what's happening in the news they become prominent dictators now and they're finagling things and there's actually a pressure now I was talking about the Chad about this the other day there's there's a there's an alarming concern coming up for the economy to really crash here coming up and jobs are being lost and different things are happening because they're expecting a recession and a lot of it is attention in the world the the China moving in Russia moving in this war and all this and China joining with them well we got the King of the North and even though we realize that we were directed not not always just watch communism as being the problem but romanism as being the final thing the Antichrist spirit will be more deceiving than Russia so we're watching all of this but he did say watch Russia and now you watch China if that's the King of the North the King of the South all this would be part of end time events to fuel and bring on more and more tensions around the world the King of the North the King of the South and feeling other nations to bring more and more tensions around the world and they are behind much more than what we think these these bigger Nations they stir up they stir up things for no reason other than to turn and remember the right the the the the the communism is just a Godless communistic people they don't regard God there's no regard for the holy part of the war that will happen in Armageddon and happen in the third world war we know that it by Revelation that when they gather around it's more about a holy war than it is than it is a war about Nations struggling at the end of the day it's going to be a holy war well then it's the same with you it's not a carnal thing that people are just against you there's a holy war going on it's about Holiness it's about your stand that you make so the Russians don't care about they don't they're just doing it for power and all these other things there's no regard for the part of the holy war part of it it'll be only one man the Antichrist that will be interested in taking over Israel and being the god of that as well and being over that he's because it's a holy war to him and they have no regard it's it shows they have no regard for God because they're the ones that drop the bomb on the Vatican now for those listening uh listen I'll be glad to sit and have coffee and explain these things but God has opened up a lot of things of Revelation The Book of Revelation has been opened up in the last days and if you're curious and interested in it we can show you some things for me be able to have the authority to say there will be a bomb dropped from Russia the king of the north on the Vatican showing they have no regard for the holy part of it or the the religious War part of it but it will be the final Conquest the final battle will be around a holy war religious the pressure that comes on you and I even as Believers today and comes on the foolish version when she's in Tribulation will be about a pressure from the economical religious system against the true people of God you can't do that anymore you can't meet like that anymore you can't do that you've got to join in with us it's a religious War that's why on a lower level we're persecuted even sometimes in our own ranks by people when we make a stand to get something that's the Antichrist spirit I know it's quiet I'm prepared to preach during these things without any amens but I'm preaching to you the word of God this is reality this is a religious deep religious devils and demons two hundred thousand thousand two million religious Devils were released upon the Jews can you say Amen religious devils so let me just move on here but Russia is not the biggest problem in chapter 11 it goes into the Antichrist if you study the Book of Daniel Daniel he is this deception that the world Falls for so deceiving he makes contact with Israel to make a contract with Israel to try to help her and then backs out at the last minute that's what Daniel says they make a covenant with Israel and thinking it's going to be a religious thing but then he backs out of it he breaks the Covenant so Russia and the Antichrist are key players until Christ comes and steps forth and this is the point that I want to make to you out of chapter 12 and verse 1 at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standed for the children of thy people and there should be a time of trouble such as ever since it was a nation even to the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered Hallelujah so Israel doesn't know that it'll be time of great trouble and pressures in the world surrounding him and they're going to try to get their their military together and try to fight and God will stand behind them but what the greatest thing is Michael Michael Christ is going to step into this thing and the time of trouble at their worst trouble will be the time of their Deliverance if we could only hold on to that today that in this time of trouble we're getting close to our deliverance let it get worse let the pressure bring it on if it's going to bring my Deliverance Bring It On devil if it's going to bring my bring it on if Michael steps into the situation and he will do that someday for the Jews and if he doesn't for the Jews he'll do it today for us he's going to step into our pressure someday while we're living in that hidden place and as I said last Sunday it's like job said hide me in the grave well he had a revelation to say that who wants to be hidden in the grave who wants to die and go I the grave is not a hiding place it is for a Christian job could say hide me in the grave because he knew the Redeemer I know my redeemer lives I know my redeemer lives and at that day he'll stand for me and he'll stand at that grave and say it's time to come out it's time for your deliverance so I can take the trouble Bring It On oh I hope I'm not bringing more things on me but I got to let the devil know that all this works together for my good all the accusations all the criticism it's gonna the devil if he only knew I'm trying to tell him but he's not listening he only knew bring it on because it's bringing my Deliverance it's giving me more Rapture and Faith it's given me more I want to get out of here praise the Lord everybody it's the truth the time of trouble is the time of Deliverance for Israel notice this was revealed under the Sixth Seal Revelations 12 17. I want you to notice this scripture I will go to book the revelations Revelations 12 17. just another small element I want to bring in that you would understand why there's an increased demonic power and Satan Maybe is in the time where he's very nervous and he's you know he doesn't understand the word he doesn't understand revelation and he can't have what the bride has he can't have it this is why he's jealous that's why he fights against it to stop it you know you've always had what the devil wanted with Adam and Eve he had the creative power and it was the ruler of this Earth and that's what devil wanted from so from the very start you the Believers have always possessed by Revelation and had it in them what the devil wanted you wonder why he's against you and he can never have it is everybody awake today just raise your hands and pinch yourself there turn the air on hot real cold something here he can't ever have has never had it and can't ever have what you have that's enough to have a really shouting time on Monday put it on your refrigerator if you have to devil you will never have what I have and and from the beginning I like to point this out it's like he comes on the scene because he's jealous of what Adam and Eve have and eventually he had to be kicked out you know what actually it happened before he was kicked out of heaven he got this stir with all the the brothers the angels and a third part of the angels with influence with them to come against he wanted to raise his kingdom so he was jealous he couldn't have the position he wanted and so now he creates a certain finally there he was kicked out of heaven with his angels He was kicked out on Earth he's kicked out of the garden even the son and daughter were kicked out of the garden because they fell with him who's kicked out then there's tension between uh Isaac and Ishmael there's tension between Cain and Abel and then then that ended and then his tension between Ishmael and Isaac and he had to be kicked out of the camp we got to get rid of cast out the Bond woman and her son and then I could go after scripture where the tension Rises he gets kicked out the tension Rises he gets kicked out why do you let this guy bother you when he's been kicked out of every believer's situation from the beginning if he's been kicked out all the way through then why don't you give him the boot every now and then he's used to it he's used to being kicked out all the way to the end when we get the Book of Revelation and Satan and his angels will be cast out the accuser of who the accuser of the Brethren stood there with tension with accusations keeping things tense all the time accusing accusing in your ear every neighbor of the Joe in your ear every day brother Bob and but but one day one day it's the same history he's going to be kicked out and you'll never hear that voice again this is history I don't know how he can't look in the Book of Revelations and see his answers he's going to be kicked out at the very end of it kick out of the atmospheres kicked out of heaven kicked off the Earth so the bride can come back and enjoy this without the devil here praise God hallelujah give him the boot every day because he's used to it when he's trying to come in and make you a gossip or give him the boot and stop your family and say we don't do that because that's the realm the devil Works in give him a boot that's not you you're teaching your children to be gossipers teaching your children to be accusers of the brethren to be accusations against Elders that's a serious thing I know that's not the kingdom of God that's Satan's kingdom I was going to read something to you this morning and I didn't expect to say this we're always sensitive to the God speaking not only through me over the pulpit through different believers quite a few months ago there was a sister that had a dream several things in the dream have come to the Past she hasn't told me the specifics of the last one she doesn't want to do that but it was this and then a sister sent me a voicemail the other day and she just said this is what my heart is feeling and I just feel brother Paul pray about this because there's there's more pressure coming to tell the people to button up to lock all the doors she says it's like a it's like a tornado getting ready to hit the church or one happy family the devil's not going to leave it that way so I always take these little things as I'm not the only one that can speak her God can speak through his body through dreams and things and there was just a sensitivity that something's coming here soon and we need to buckle up our armor because the armor is the for the fiery darts buckle up close the doors get in that safe place get ready and I don't know the details of it but I just say I take any warning if it's from the Lord I take it serious we're not in a picnic here what I'm preaching here and what you're trying to live is not a picnic it's what the devil hates he hates Revelation he hates people growing in the Lord he hates Unity amongst the people of God he hates it so I think it's a little bit of warning I didn't want to say it but I guess I'm willing to be sensitive say Lord let me be prepared in my heart that I can keep the right spirit one of the parts of the dream is the family betraying me so I just say Lord let me respond with Divine love if that happens is that okay with everybody in the time of trouble the time of trouble is our the time of Deliverance and this is what he says in Psalms 27 it in the time of trouble he will hide me but it's the time of Deliverance because the prophet Rapture so in this time of trouble is the time for our deliverance and a Rapture if we're surrounded by the enemy ganged up on by the enemy guess what and it's if it's showing no relief it it shows nothing in the prophecy for it to stop uh you know and the thing is is that until God steps in he lets the pressure continue he lets the pressure go the only hope we have is a hiding place until he delivers us in a rapture but we have that hiding place the only thing it's doing is setting us up for the total deliverance and that's our Rapture my friends if you hear the Simplicity of what I'm expressing for my spiritual life and your spiritual life the only place we need the one desire we need to be in every day is to live in that secure safe place in the word I'm going to be direct right now you you young couples are you listening to the this prophet you got young children are you listening to this word are you in this Bible how much of the day is spent on social media or on movies how much of your entertaining time is consumed and I ask you how much are you in the prophet that God sent us listening to that voice it's not about the man it's about what he said I love every line of this message when I when I listen to it I don't see the man I see there's there can be a sentence that God breathed to this generation because if you don't understand a prophet then you see you're not going to have a value for it it's like why do we quote this all the time because if it is true that God sent Elijah through a man if you got that Revelation this is the Elijah of this day to introduce the second coming Christ then if you know that then it's like when I was 16 years old I said it this way if God sent an Elijah man with the spirit Elijah to my generation if that has happened which he showed me it is it was prophesying it happened then I'm hanging on every word I know the humanness part of it and there's not he said himself that some of this is just human some of it's the some of it's not safe I understand all that but I I value every word there's a reason why he says things I'm hanging on it every sentence and one sentence can be such a such a damage to the enemy so I asked you how much are you listening you young couples young married you don't have a core to your marriage unless you find and dwell in that word for this generation get your Bible you have anything to hold your marriage together except Christ and the word and being in the word this isn't a guilt trip this is say just get into the word because you're going to need it if what if what somebody's word of the Lords is saying and the pressure it's not going to be one happy family people turn against one another you're gonna need to be in a a hiding place you're going to need to be in the word you're going to need stand praise the Lord now so it's a different type of trouble that we're under today I don't think for the bride it's going to be about Rockets or bombs hitting close to your house at night even though when I hear something I go what's going on because it could happen at any time with the war going they could drop a bomb you know they could drop a little bomb not the big one we'll be out of here before the big one comes the bride will be but I hear those I don't know I'm sleeping when the word was that I'm too scared to go outside and see what it is what's starting to get on the news what's going on here but I don't think our trouble is to be worried about bombs coming close to our house I think it's demonic homosexual lesbian entertainment of the world that's the bombs being dropped close to your house that's the trouble that causes families our trouble is Detention of the Antichrist Spirit working Among Us it hurts it's trouble so I want to end this today at a very decent time 12 30 by turning to this group Daniel chapter 3. because if you want to talk about uh you know and there's a lot of scriptures that talk about when the people of God were surrounded the enemies surrounding there's a lot of places in the children of Israel when they were warring and fighting they got surrounded by the enemy remember gehaza I remember the prophet saying and he looked out and just like everywhere there's a host of enemy all the way around him remember what the prophet had said to him God opened them open the boy's eyes open his eyes because all he could see is all this real what are we going to do they're surrounding us Lord open the boy's eyes God help the boy God help the boy he opened his eyes I seen a great host around the back of him what did I say Daniel 3. so if you're talking about being surrounded All Through the Bible you have it but here's some guys that Daniel chapter 3 verse 8. or for at that time certain Chaldeans came near and accused the Jews they spake and said that the King Nebuchadnezzar O King live forever forever thou O King has made a degree that every man that shall hear the sound of their Coronet uh flute harp sack butt sultry dulcimer and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image um I'd like to preach a little sermon in here that did you notice bowing to the image was associated with all kinds of music music was used to open their emotions to bow to the image because music is used to open up your emotions we use it here in the service but what is it opening up your heart to receive right and whoso fall was not down and worshipeth that he should be cast in the midst of the burning fiery furnace there are certain Jews whom the whom thou has set over the Affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach Meshach and Abednego these men O King have not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods no worship the golden image which thou has set up then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage point this man was mad but now he's in a rage and what is he in a rage about what has his in his anger increased about believers who made a stand against him that's what it was about his anger increased his rage increased I'm going to do something more now because I'm angry why am I angry because they won't join in with the rest and bow to the same thing they're not going to bow his rage was increased then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shaq can you imagine we get mad at a lot of things but can you imagine what this guy is on rage and fury about he's against three believers who make a stand you make a stand see some of you today I'm I'm encouraging you I pray you feel the pull of the Lord for your family your wife girlfriend whatever it is I pray that you feel the pull through the preaching that Christ is pulling you because you haven't made a stand yet mom you haven't made a real stand but you need to make a stand you're a daddy you need to make a stand for the rest of the family so he's in a rage he's in a fury in verse 14 never connect or spake and said unto them is it true oh Shadrach me shaking do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I've set up now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp sagput sultry dulcimer I don't know why all the names of the instruments are mentioned again and all kinds of music ye shall fall down and worship the image which I have made well but if ye worship not ye shall be cast in the same hour into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands threats pressure anger coming against you wow so he gave him another chance my dad used to preach this I always loved when he preached Shadrach Meshach in a minute ago because he said I'm gonna give you guys another chance okay we're going to do this privately the whole world doesn't need to see just come over here in a minute and here's the image right here and just while nobody's watching just get down and bow that's all you have to do just do quick little bow privately secretly I'm giving you another chance to bow and here's their answer verse 16. Shadrach Meshach and Mingo answered instead of the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter in other words in our language let me make myself perfectly clear perfectly transparent we don't want any question in your mind we're being very careful to answer very direct to you glory be to God take a stand don't be afraid of the enemy have we made ourselves perfectly transparent if it bestow Our God whom we serve as able Deliver Us From The Burning Fire furnace and he will deliver us out of thine handle King so God's able to do it but if not be it known unto thee may we make it Crystal Clear To You O King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has set up you want a little amen there's a Believer to me God is able at this moment to deliver me from whatever it is cancer emotional instability God Can Heal Me God can raise the Dead and I believe it with all my heart I've watched it happen I know it can happen but I want to let the devil know that if something happened God chooses to take somebody in cancer I'm still not bow into the world I'm still not bowing to your image that's the language of a believer and did you know the image was unto the prophet that's the solo added that's another sermon whoo so we're not bound to that either images to William Branham we're not bound to that this church doesn't bow to that we have one in Lord savior here we have one Christ that we serve can you say Amen not bowing God can deliver us but if he doesn't we're not still not bowing then was Nebuchadnezzar full of Fury do you guys have to keep doing things that make him even more mad he was already inferior now he's full of Fury friends I'm saying this to let you know this is the same devil who's against the same thing he's against you he's against your family try to live holy try to get your kids in the right atmosphere try to try to have a Godly marriage and fellowship around the world try to do those things and watch the devil fight it with distractions and financial pressures and all this and pressures of businesses trust me I've lived there I know what a pressure of businesses can bring on a marriage on your walk with the Lord and finally you get to the place and wait a minute none of this is worth my fellowship with the Lord said you stop right there there's no money there's no retirement I hope I'm speaking to somebody there is no planning financial planning that's more important than what God's doing in this hour let it all let it be taken from me today my track my money my retirement my 401k and incidentally you may lose it I say let it all go if I have Christ Living in my heart is this the part Satan can't take job job could everything was taken from him his kids his money his buildings everything but guess what Satan couldn't take that part that was in job there's something Satan couldn't take then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fear in the form of his Visage was changed against sadrach Meshach and then he go therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more did I read that right and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than was want to be heated in other words in my language Satan is turning the heat up on the bride Satan's turning the heat up on your life things to turning the heat up on your family Satan's turning the heat up on Gatherings like this turn the heat up he commanded the most mighty men that there were in his army to bind them I'm picking out the strongest dudes to bind these guys up so they never get out and cast them into the burning fiery furnace then these men were Bound in their coats they're hosen and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king's commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach Meshach and meningo to the fire furnace they died they got so close to it they died and these three men Shadrach Meshach and minigo fell down Bound in the midst of the burning fiery furnace there's nobody that's been around surrounded by the Flames like these young men were I know I'm taking just a tad longer but I'll just say this how many remember the thing that God showed brother Branham as he was coming down the escalator in a mall and as a little boy he had a little vision or trance he went into of hell and he seen miserable people just bound people and women with makeup and just and this they were kind of panting and seeing these ridiculous things and just bound and he's seen it scared him to death and he said God never let me go there he went to hell he went to the dimensions of Hell I was coming down in 1964 65 the escalator in a mall can't remember which mall it was it was in Tucson or Phoenix and he says I looked and there was some women there in the bottom floor he said I look he said they were panting they had all the stuff on their face everything was saved and he says I realized I was back in hell again a transition had taken place he got the scripture and just so we're scriptural for everybody it's listening scripturally hell has enlarged itself hell has surfaced in the end time that we look we're going to go we'll go with people they're going to go to hell someday going to go well someday well I want to let you know the the the fourth dimension television The Fifth Dimension hell where they go that are unsaved sixth Dimension is where they go when you're saved to wait to the final Resurrection seventh Dimension is where God dwells these are all these are all right in this room right now way up there right here first three is time light and matter which is what we live in fourth dimension is television so the sixth dimension through the sixth Dimension hell spills into the fourth dimension when television was developed and then we watch it and the sixth Dimension spills into the fourth and the fourth spills into our dimension he said I was scared he didn't say I was scared he said I realized I was living in hell again it's 1965. so it's not that we look for those Dimensions to go to someday but they're already moved up to Earth so I can safely say as I close the service we are like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego we are surrounded by the Flames of hell now because we were always taught in the Baptist Church as a it's an eternal burning place it's a Eternal burning place and you have enough types of scriptures so that there is a break but there's not Eternal it's not going to burn for for all of eternity and hell because the only thing Eternal is God it was created for Satan and his angels it's going to end someday so there is a place and remember the man that lifted up his eyes in hell and he wanted to drink so there's a reality with that but hell is so much more than just a physical place where you burn that's that's not it hell is separation from God and if you're separate from God this morning you're already living in a Hell I hate to be so straight with you but don't look at hell as I'm going there someday don't look at that look at this that I'm living it without God I'm living in hell now I'm surrounded by Flames now and Shadrach and mizak were surrounded surrounded surrounded by Flames why because of the anger increasing in Satan in Nebuchadnezzar he increased the heat he increased the pressure you got an enemy you're increasing the pressure every day on your life because of the stand you make that's why they're in that fire furnace because of the stand they make the Revelation that's why I titled this hide me hide me Lord give me uh put me in the safe place of Revelation because that's the only safe place to be oh let me finish the Sunday School Story and I hope to the young people and children and to the adults this is more than just a Sunday school story of Shadrach Meshach and a minute ago we're living in it right now we're surrounded by the Flames of hell right now because of the stand we make because of revelation we hold it doesn't devil doesn't hate your personality that's your uncle that's that family member devil doesn't hate you because your personality or that you know he hates the Revelation that you got that he doesn't have it's a revelation we stand upon these three men fell bound into the Mist then Nebuchadnezzar the king verse 24 astonished rose up in haste and spake and said unto the counselors did not we cast three men bounded in the midst of fire they answered and said unto the king oh tree true king we only set three in there he answers said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire [Applause] unharmed by the flames surrounded but unharmed how many would raise your hand and say that's where I want to be living I don't care the flavors if I'm surrounded I want to be unharmed by the protection of God and also another thing I want to see and that the devil can look and see walking in the midst of the fire can you imagine these guys and the King was so angry and it didn't make him any more peaceful at all it'd probably make him I bound them I stuck them in I put everything on them and these guys are in there walking around in the middle of the flames every praise is to our God every word of worship never could answer you got some music well I got some music right now he answered and said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the son of God eyes yeah we're in the midst of Hell the Flames of hell it's not prophesied to get any better but if I can be in there with the Lord he's walking through the Flames with me that's all I need I'm done you feel courage today you feel Faith in your heart today you know that what God has deposited within you that's the thing the devil doesn't like we wishy-washy with it make a stand you stand for this message of the last days of Christ I always like to say the message of Christ for the last days because that's what it is it's not the movement it's not the churches that's not the message when I say I love this message I don't mean the churches and the movement I mean the core of what God spoke through his Prophet I love every bit of it I live on it it's my spiritual bread he provided for me to how to live in this game you will never regret if you build your life on that Revelation foundation and take a stand today it's not just saying I'm in a message church it's taking a stand say I believe it with all my heart get ready for the devil to fight you when you do that but it's time to make a stand it's not just I'm kind of part of the group here and I'll be oh no that's taking a stand for all the day when we have more young people taking a stand for righteousness for holiness stand having done all to stand stand therefore I don't have to do anything to agitate the devil I just stand for the word brother Stephen just stand for the right thing amen and it makes me mad I have to go out there and find him and say no no no no no no no I just stand on the revelation God is deposited with you he'll

hold us through the rest of the storm father I pray for the souls this morning that you've placed in my care Lord to minister your word though Lord Jesus we we have many things come our way you have

understand it they see it they they agree with it Lord but they haven't made a stand yet oh father I pray they'd find that altar today Lord give their heart to you holy to you make a full Stand For You Lord like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego strong stand that if God is able to deliver us but if he doesn't we're not we're not going to bow no matter how much of the influence of the world the music of the world the entertainments of the world not going to bow to the same image of everybody else Lord I imagine the many people that day were there observing and watching maybe hundreds maybe thousands and they'd all bowed they all did what the king said to do but just three people said no it we don't agree with that we're not going to do it they're the ones all the anger was turned against what I felt that before helped me to stand in love Grace dignity and courtesy respect for people no matter how much they lash out let me maintain my respective courtesy and pray for that soul they could find the same Deliverance Lord that Shadrach Meshach and Abigail found standing on your worm Lord you'll take us through every storm we'll Brave them Lord because our anchor holds within the veil you take these Hearts this morning each one every one of them including my own you lead us as a Shepherd towards the strength that we need to face the cowards coming ahead we ask it Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for your God we trust in you we have settled on you we rest in you that the future is in your hands Lord in Jesus name but you lay your hands on somebody and pray for

your kingdom Lord love them enough love them Lord draw them pull them towards Yourself by love not by force but draw them till they'll fall in love with you put a hedge of protection around them from the spirits of lust and demons that want to destroy their minds and hearts they're modesty their virginity their Simplicity their cleanness oh God put a hedge around them may you give them a revelation by the Holy Ghost of who you are I pray that's my prayer Lord the children that will gather for kids days and learn about Jesus and learn about principles many of them never heard before I pray that you will begin to deal with their hearts even beforehand Lord all the children that would come deal with their hearts their hearts would be softened turn their life over to you this week during Kids days we committed to you because we're claiming not only older ones but all the little ones as well for your kingdom thank you Father may we have a good day and like I said about the father who is climbing up the mountain with his little boy and got to a real rough patch dangerous didn't know which way to choose and that little son says daddy make sure you choose the right path

in thank you Jesus commit the day to you father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ [Music] don't you just love moments like this you feel his presence peace to settle on the people I trust that so
