[0:00] what a nice time of fellowship sunday
[0:02] and we want to say thank you to sister
[0:03] sharon i don't know if she's the
[0:05] sharon's here yeah she's so tired she's
[0:07] sitting down right now she's she's still
[0:08] wore out
[0:09] but um let's give her hand what a
[0:11] wonderful job with the children on
[0:13] sunday just
[0:14] and all the staff
[0:17] she had a lot of helpers and different
[0:18] ones and sister tina and
[0:21] sister lindsay i think helped greatly
[0:23] and all the others and the children who
[0:24] did it it was just a superb presentation
[0:27] i wish it had been a lot more visitors
[0:30] from the community so we'll try to push
[0:31] that a little bit more next year but
[0:33] what a wonderful night we just had a
[0:34] great day together and
[0:36] tired and body but we were just revived
[0:38] to see what the lord did we appreciate
[0:40] that day
[0:41] and if you have a great day like that
[0:43] then it just helps you the rest of the
[0:45] week amen encourage you good to have you
[0:48] all out tonight uh we're reading from
[0:50] deuteronomy chapter 19 we'll read
[0:52] together certain scriptures
[0:54] and
[0:55] ask the lord to bless us in the word
[0:56] tonight
[0:57] when the lord thy god hath cut off the
[0:59] nations
[1:00] whose land the lord thy god giveth thee
[1:03] and thou succeedest them and dwell us in
[1:06] their cities and in their houses thou
[1:08] shalt separate three cities for thee in
[1:10] the midst of thy land which the lord thy
[1:12] god giveth thee to possess it thou shalt
[1:15] prepare thee away and divide the coast
[1:17] of thy land which the lord thy god
[1:18] giveth thee to inherit into three parts
[1:21] and that every slayer may flee thither
[1:24] and so now he's going to explain what he
[1:26] means by the slayer and this is the case
[1:28] of the slayer which shall flee thither
[1:31] that he may live whosoever killeth his
[1:33] neighbor ignorantly whom he hated not in
[1:36] time past
[1:38] as when a man goeth into the wood with
[1:40] his neighbor to he would and his hand
[1:42] stretcheth forth a stroke with the axe
[1:44] to cut down the tree
[1:45] and the head slippeth from the hell and
[1:47] lighteth upon his neighbor that he die
[1:50] he shall flee unto one of those cities
[1:53] and live
[1:54] so this is a category of someone who
[1:57] had an accident did it by accident
[1:59] and it was not intentionally done it was
[2:03] something was done and they were guilty
[2:05] but it was a bit a bit of different
[2:07] guilt because it wasn't an intentional
[2:09] thing it was an accident and god
[2:13] god thinks of everything
[2:16] can you say man god has already in his
[2:19] mind he he thinks through everything
[2:22] even for today he knew this day and he's
[2:25] already has his plan
[2:27] in your trial that you'll hit next week
[2:29] he's already got an answer for it
[2:32] so that's our god amen so so as when a
[2:35] man go through the wood then verse six
[2:37] it says lest the avenger of the blood
[2:39] pursue the slayer while his heart is hot
[2:42] and overtake him i'd say
[2:44] i say his heart is hot and his temper is
[2:46] a bit hot too as well and a bunch of
[2:49] other things and he overtake him because
[2:51] the way is long and slay him whereas he
[2:53] was not worthy of death in so much he
[2:56] hated him not in the past so here's a
[2:58] category that this person was not worthy
[3:01] of dying of this because his intent was
[3:04] not to do it it was an accident
[3:06] wherefore i command thee saying thou
[3:08] shalt separate three cities for thee
[3:10] look at this now and if the lord thy god
[3:12] enlarge thy coast as he has sworn unto
[3:15] thy fathers and give thee all the land
[3:17] which he promised to give unto the
[3:18] fathers if thou shalt keep all these
[3:20] commandments to do them which i command
[3:23] thee this day to love the lord thy god
[3:26] and to walk ever in his ways
[3:29] then shout thou add three cities more
[3:32] for thee besides these
[3:35] grace grace
[3:38] here's a bounding grace
[3:41] you're walking with the lord and you're
[3:42] growing in him and you love him with all
[3:44] your heart make three more cities to run
[3:47] into when the devil's after you
[3:52] i love it
[3:55] that innocent blood
[3:57] be not shed in thy land which the lord
[3:59] thy god giveth thee for an inheritance
[4:02] and so blood the blood be upon thee but
[4:05] if any man hate his neighbor and lie and
[4:08] wait for him and rise up against him now
[4:10] here's a different category
[4:12] and smite him mortally that he die and
[4:15] fleeth into one of these cities
[4:17] then the elders of his city shall send
[4:19] and fetch him thence and deliver him
[4:21] into the hand of the avenger of blood
[4:24] that he may die
[4:26] different category
[4:28] whole different category
[4:30] thine eyes shall not pity him but thou
[4:33] shalt put away the guilt of innocent
[4:37] blood from israel
[4:39] that it may go well with thee
[4:43] i want you to remember this statement
[4:44] here's the purpose i want you to put
[4:47] away the guilt
[4:49] of innocent blood
[4:52] the guilt of one who's truly guilty is
[4:54] one thing
[4:55] but i want you to put away the guilt
[4:58] of the innocent
[5:01] that's our god
[5:03] i i want to talk a little bit and teach
[5:05] a little bit tonight on
[5:06] god knows how to deal
[5:08] with guilt
[5:11] god knows how to deal with guilt
[5:13] heavenly father we ask you to help us
[5:15] strengthen us and we place our souls in
[5:17] your hands tonight bless every ear
[5:20] that's listening tonight what the spirit
[5:22] is saying to the church and we pray that
[5:24] you help us to yield ourself in such a
[5:26] way that lord you could bring us as our
[5:28] brother was speaking on sunday about the
[5:30] vision being a revelation and without a
[5:33] revelation without a vision that people
[5:35] perish
[5:36] give us a vision of your word tonight
[5:38] give us a revelation of your word we ask
[5:40] it in jesus name amen god bless you may
[5:43] be seated
[5:45] now i'm going to go back just a little
[5:46] bit and catch the end of
[5:48] a service that i was doing titled the
[5:51] difference between
[5:53] condemnation and conviction
[5:56] and we received a lot of good response
[5:59] from that service and so that was that's
[6:01] the difference we spoke on the
[6:02] difference between condemnation
[6:05] and conviction there's so much more to
[6:08] explore
[6:09] in this subject and also satan
[6:12] certainly does not like a minister
[6:14] dealing with these certain subjects
[6:17] as satan is a professional
[6:19] in using guilt and using condemnation
[6:23] to mess up people's minds especially a
[6:26] true believer
[6:27] satan is a professional i hate to
[6:29] compliment him but he's a professional
[6:31] in dwelling in the realm of guilt
[6:33] satan is professional in dwelling in the
[6:34] realm of confusing believers minds
[6:37] i said satan is a professional
[6:40] in dabbling in the subjects of guilt and
[6:42] condemnation and mixing it with
[6:44] conviction and you remember that's why i
[6:46] spoke about it is just to give a black
[6:49] eye to the enemy and and show the
[6:51] believer his position and to help in a
[6:54] healthy way separate these things so
[6:56] that we understand them the devil
[6:58] understands them but we must understand
[7:00] them we must understand in our battle
[7:02] every day the difference between
[7:04] condemnation and conviction
[7:06] we must understand that or the devil
[7:08] will wreak havoc with our minds and our
[7:10] and uh and our our condemnation and the
[7:13] different things we experience and the
[7:15] voices that speak to us so satan sure
[7:18] likes to mess up people's minds in these
[7:19] subjects especially the true believer
[7:22] and to where the mind and the spirit you
[7:24] know remember the mind and the spirit is
[7:27] all satan has left to work with in your
[7:29] body
[7:32] when you're born again and the soul is
[7:34] sealed in by god the mind and the spirit
[7:38] and your flesh is all he has left to
[7:40] deal with
[7:42] and so god's got the best part
[7:46] can you say man isn't it good to know
[7:48] god's got the the best part
[7:50] and god sealed himself and your soul
[7:53] you know if god was in in the flesh in
[7:55] the sense he was only in my flesh then
[7:58] that wouldn't be a victory but the
[7:59] victory is is that he's sealed in my
[8:01] soul the best part and from there there
[8:04] can be such a power to take over my
[8:06] spirit to take over my mind to take over
[8:09] my flesh can you imagine how
[8:12] supernaturally it is to happen that a
[8:14] human being can live so yielded to god
[8:17] and filled with the spirit that actually
[8:19] the holy ghost can bring a body that was
[8:23] never that will never inherit the
[8:24] kingdom of god never go in a rapture but
[8:27] it can soul control the body and the
[8:29] mind it'll bring this body under
[8:31] subjection to him
[8:32] human beings can live in victory with
[8:35] this body under subjection i'll tell you
[8:37] that's a supernatural miracle that's a
[8:39] great thing but god's got the best part
[8:41] and satan is left with the bodies our
[8:44] spirits our minds and so whatever he's
[8:46] left to work with he'll take that's if
[8:49] you let him take it
[8:51] can i get an amen it's what territory
[8:55] you let satan have that he'll take
[8:58] you could give your mind
[9:00] holy over to god and say i'm going to
[9:02] think on good things i'm going to think
[9:04] on positive things i just had a negative
[9:07] thought to me and so i'm going to change
[9:09] that right away by my own choice and i'm
[9:11] going to replace it with a good thought
[9:13] i just had something depress my spirit
[9:16] somebody said something or somebody
[9:17] didn't say anything but i feel depressed
[9:19] i know it's a depressing spirit that's
[9:21] come around me but by choice i'm not
[9:23] going to let that do it i'm going to go
[9:25] over there and put some music on and in
[9:27] a matter of a few minutes of holy ghost
[9:28] field music i'm going to draw myself out
[9:31] of that spirit of depression and i'm
[9:33] going to be rejoicing the lord because i
[9:35] have a choice of what i let satan get
[9:37] involved in
[9:40] and whatever you give him he'll take
[9:42] you can be in depression all day long
[9:45] all week long all christmas season long
[9:49] if you let satan control it
[9:51] or you could have a good christmas
[9:54] and happy
[9:56] and thankful
[9:58] praise the lord
[10:00] so i'm going to go back and read some
[10:02] things that i feel are worth repeating
[10:04] before i go into the subject of guilt a
[10:06] little bit i was going back in my notes
[10:08] and i read some things real quickly at
[10:10] the end because i didn't have much time
[10:12] left there's some good things here about
[10:13] conviction and i already talked about
[10:15] condemnation that's a final
[10:17] condemning
[10:18] there's no hope it's over and god
[10:21] doesn't dwell on that
[10:23] but he deals in conviction
[10:25] and you have to know the difference
[10:26] because somebody can begin convicted by
[10:28] god and say i'm feeling condemned i'm
[10:30] feeling you're not being condemned by
[10:32] god but conviction of god is different
[10:35] and you want conviction of god you want
[10:37] you want that in your life you would
[10:39] never want a life without conviction
[10:41] amen so you got to know the difference
[10:43] so some people said some good things
[10:45] they said
[10:46] different writers and i collected some
[10:48] of the things what gives us conviction
[10:50] uh of sin is not the number of sins we
[10:54] have committed it is the sight of the
[10:55] holiness of god martin jones said that
[10:58] and then it goes on to say here's
[11:00] another writer henry blackaby said when
[11:02] a holy god draws near in true in true
[11:05] revival
[11:06] people come under terrible conviction of
[11:09] sin the outstanding feature of a
[11:11] spiritual awakening has been the
[11:14] profound consciousness of the presence
[11:16] and the holiness of god you when you
[11:18] come into his presence of a holy god
[11:21] then all of a sudden your sin is exposed
[11:24] and that's a good thing
[11:25] that can bring a revival because what
[11:27] happens is people don't just get
[11:28] convicted they repent and when you start
[11:31] repenting remember what brother bannon
[11:32] said a revival was he said it's it's
[11:35] like a big ocean out there and he says
[11:37] when all the winds come in the ocean he
[11:38] says it washes up by the waves it washes
[11:41] up all the trash up on the shore and
[11:44] when you have a hallelujah time and wash
[11:46] all the trash out of your life on the
[11:48] shore then you can really have a
[11:50] rejoicing time a revival is happening in
[11:52] your life get rid of all the trash let
[11:54] it all wash to the side and then you
[11:56] feel a revival
[11:58] amen conviction is part of that
[12:01] another writer said conviction of sin is
[12:03] god's way i love these now conviction of
[12:05] sin is god's way of inviting you to
[12:08] restore fellowship with him
[12:12] because obviously you're away from him
[12:13] you're distant from him you feel
[12:15] convicted and you repent say god bring
[12:17] me back brings you back into restoration
[12:19] of relationship so conviction is a good
[12:21] thing that's not condemnation conviction
[12:23] is not repentance
[12:25] conviction leads to repentance but you
[12:27] can be convicted without repentance
[12:30] that's from martin jones another one
[12:32] from martin jones i think that's a good
[12:33] quote some other writers said conviction
[12:35] is more than
[12:36] the mere feeling and this is what i'll
[12:38] speak a little bit about tonight
[12:40] conviction is more than just the mere
[12:43] feeling of guilt for something we have
[12:45] done wrong
[12:46] it's normal to have to feel guilty
[12:50] after doing something that we know we
[12:52] shouldn't have done
[12:53] so so the
[12:55] tonight i'll talk a little bit about the
[12:57] feeling of guilt
[12:58] but we must distinguish the feeling of
[13:02] guilt
[13:03] over real guilt
[13:05] if we did something wrong and we're
[13:07] convicted of god there are good there's
[13:09] going to be guilt that goes with that
[13:11] but then satan dwells in the realm of a
[13:14] feeling of guilt and you not haven't
[13:16] necessarily did anything wrong but you
[13:18] got a feeling of guilt how many has ever
[13:20] met somebody in your life and they're
[13:21] professionals that making you feel
[13:23] guilty
[13:24] don't look at your husband or wife next
[13:26] to you
[13:27] please don't do that
[13:28] not in a service tell them when to get
[13:30] home
[13:32] but if it's not your husband or wife
[13:34] it's your children that make you they're
[13:36] they make you feel guilty all the time
[13:39] or it's the parents to the children
[13:41] making them feel guilt their kids they
[13:43] never measure up you always making them
[13:44] feel guilty always talking about what
[13:46] they do wrong and never what they do
[13:47] right but there are other people in our
[13:49] lives there was one fellow in my life
[13:52] years and years ago and he worked in the
[13:54] church here and he was very good his mom
[13:57] i better not be personal here
[13:59] he was very good at making you feel
[14:02] guilty and hit our personalities clashed
[14:04] a little bit but he could make me feel
[14:07] so bad and make me feel like i've done
[14:10] so many things wrong and then when i got
[14:12] away from him and i thought it through
[14:14] most of the stuff i hadn't even done but
[14:16] i felt like i but when he got done with
[14:18] me i feel like i had done it and that's
[14:21] a good lawyer in court you can be
[14:22] innocent but a good lawyer after he
[14:25] talks it's like
[14:26] i wonder if i did do it
[14:29] that's a good lawyer i'm starting to
[14:31] feel like
[14:32] i might i wasn't even there that night
[14:34] but maybe i was
[14:38] that's a good lawyer right there and
[14:40] i'll tell you satan is a professional
[14:42] lawyer against believers
[14:45] satan is your voice in your mind someday
[14:49] every day and he is a professional
[14:51] lawyer can make you feel guilty the
[14:54] feeling of guilt
[14:56] now i know i'm not talking to anybody
[14:58] here tonight none of you ever have the
[15:00] feeling of guilt that's only me i'm sure
[15:02] but anyway the feeling of guilt
[15:06] is not necessarily the conviction and
[15:08] the guilt that goes with conviction
[15:11] see why we got to talk about these
[15:12] things because you might be feeling
[15:14] might be from the enemy
[15:16] and not from god
[15:18] but you're just beating yourself all up
[15:20] and you're depressed and you're i wonder
[15:22] this and i wonder that in a wonder
[15:24] wonder wonder and you just become a
[15:25] wandering star
[15:28] because you're wondering all the time
[15:31] so we gotta really talk about these
[15:33] things so conviction is more than a mere
[15:35] feeling of guilt for something we've
[15:37] done wrong it's normal to feel guilty
[15:39] after doing something that we know we
[15:40] shouldn't have done conviction goes
[15:43] above and beyond having a feeling true
[15:46] conviction goes above and beyond having
[15:49] a feeling
[15:50] convict in the greek is translated into
[15:53] elencho
[15:54] which means
[15:55] to convince someone of the truth
[15:58] to reprove to accuse in other words it's
[16:01] there's truth to it
[16:04] a feeling most the time doesn't have
[16:06] truth to it
[16:08] but true conviction has a truth to it
[16:10] it's it's to convince someone of the
[16:12] truth so we see that conviction brings
[16:15] out the truth it accuses us of our
[16:17] wrongs and rebukes us of our sins as we
[16:20] have seen through the verses we have
[16:22] discussed conviction is good
[16:25] brokenness is good
[16:28] it always draws us closer to god
[16:32] if you find yourself in deep conviction
[16:35] for something
[16:36] don't ignore it
[16:38] young people can learn this early in
[16:40] life if you find yourself in deep
[16:42] conviction about something and it's
[16:43] coming from god don't ever ignore that
[16:46] go to your prayer closet
[16:49] get right with god today
[16:51] today is the day of your reconciliation
[16:54] don't wait two weeks don't wait two
[16:56] years don't wait 20 years
[16:59] when you feel the conviction repent
[17:01] before god and reconcile with god our
[17:04] lord wants to be with you he wants to
[17:06] manifest himself through you and he
[17:08] cannot do that if you're not right with
[17:10] him yes brokenness is painful but it's
[17:14] necessary and it's beautiful thank god
[17:17] for conviction
[17:19] how many would raise your hand say thank
[17:21] you lord for conviction
[17:22] thank you lord
[17:24] there is a clear difference between
[17:26] conviction and condemnation
[17:28] conviction comes from the lord and it
[17:31] leads to life and joy
[17:34] condemnation however comes from satan
[17:37] and it leads to despair
[17:40] conviction is intended to lead us to the
[17:42] lord but condemnation drives us away
[17:45] from the lord so listen if you're
[17:47] feeling i'm i'm getting out of here i'm
[17:49] going you know i'm i'm going to turn to
[17:50] things of the world i'm going to do this
[17:52] or whatever and
[17:53] because i'm just feeling condemned that
[17:55] is not god driving you away that's satan
[17:58] using it to drive you further away
[18:01] when conviction is involved god is doing
[18:04] it to draw you closer to him
[18:07] condemnation drives you away
[18:09] condemnation causes us to look at
[18:11] ourself
[18:14] conviction causes us to look to christ
[18:18] when someone is experiencing
[18:19] condemnation there's no solution to
[18:21] their problem
[18:23] you're just doomed you cross the line
[18:25] it's over you're done there's no hope
[18:28] for you
[18:30] some of satan's voices
[18:33] with condemnation there's no solution to
[18:35] the problem but we know with christ with
[18:38] everything there's a solution
[18:41] there's grace can you say amen there's
[18:43] an answer
[18:44] our bible says that with every
[18:46] temptation he will make a way of escape
[18:49] for you
[18:50] [Applause]
[18:52] every time
[18:54] and so when someone is experiencing
[18:55] condemnation there's no solution when
[18:57] we're experiencing conviction it's meant
[18:59] to draw us to him to receive his love
[19:02] his grace his forgiveness in conviction
[19:05] there is hope because on the cross jesus
[19:07] christ died for all of our sins when we
[19:11] look to the cross we find freedom and
[19:13] hope and john 12 47 says for god did not
[19:17] send his son into the world to condemn
[19:20] the world but to save the world through
[19:23] him there's always
[19:25] salvation through god's conviction but
[19:28] there's always uh
[19:30] damnation and condemnation with satan's
[19:32] condemnation
[19:34] a final a final word praise the lord you
[19:37] love him
[19:39] so i thought i wanted to go back and
[19:41] just ring those those are just ringing
[19:42] true with my heart for sure
[19:44] now
[19:46] if we just look at now we just want to
[19:48] go go into guilt a little bit tonight
[19:51] and just expose it
[19:54] guilt
[19:56] has the power
[19:59] to go beyond convicting the really truly
[20:02] guilty
[20:04] guilt can plague the innocent
[20:10] so we have to recognize when satan is
[20:12] using the thing of guilt and i don't
[20:13] even know necessarily what it is but we
[20:16] know it is something because we feel it
[20:20] and satan knows that feeling and satan
[20:22] with his voices gets in that feeling but
[20:24] the the thing that can be way too
[20:26] powerful and satan using it is the power
[20:29] of guilt can go beyond convicting the
[20:31] really guilty
[20:33] which it should but it also can plague
[20:36] the innocent
[20:38] so when you look closely at the dynamics
[20:41] of today what's going on with the
[20:42] believer now
[20:44] you can see why there is not more
[20:46] visible victories sometimes than
[20:48] believers
[20:50] just ahead lies a greater place of
[20:52] freedom just ahead lies a greater
[20:55] victory for them just ahead just through
[20:59] the soundberry just just across just a
[21:01] little remember i was speaking a few
[21:02] weeks ago about your potentials
[21:04] sometimes somebody's full potentials are
[21:06] laying right there and they're just a
[21:08] step away from it and satan's keeping
[21:10] them from greater potential
[21:12] satan's keeping you from a greater walk
[21:14] with the lord because you're held back
[21:15] right there it's just it's just stunted
[21:18] right there and there's a greater place
[21:20] of freedom but sometimes there's a cloud
[21:23] of guilt that lays over a believer
[21:29] sometimes we bring it on ourselves
[21:31] sometimes other people bring it bring it
[21:34] on us and there are ways that we bring
[21:36] guilt on ourselves and other people can
[21:37] bring us we you know
[21:39] sometimes
[21:42] and i'm just going to be real honest
[21:43] with you tonight sometimes we over
[21:45] examine ourselves
[21:47] because we want to please god so much
[21:50] out of his desire that he put within us
[21:54] so now here's just a real dividing line
[21:56] here we're supposed to examine ourselves
[22:00] because the bible says fourth
[22:01] corinthians let a man examine himself
[22:03] it's before the lord's supper but every
[22:05] day let a man examine himself so i'm not
[22:08] knocking that but be careful how you're
[22:10] examining yourself and how you're
[22:12] measuring yourself
[22:14] do it with the word of god
[22:16] but don't do it by other people's
[22:18] measuring stick
[22:22] and don't do it by your own measuring
[22:24] stick because those of you who are real
[22:27] extreme legalistic and or maybe ocd or
[22:31] whatever nature that you have that kind
[22:34] of
[22:34] especially you people you can set
[22:37] yourself in expectations that you'll
[22:39] probably never measure up to
[22:41] and when you don't measure up that week
[22:43] or that day
[22:45] then what do you get
[22:48] guilt
[22:52] just the thought just come to me that
[22:53] monday morning i woke up and sometimes i
[22:55] try to make out a list a lot of stuff i
[22:57] need to get done
[22:58] for the week
[23:00] this week's list because i had a week
[23:02] off last week this week's list was
[23:05] a whole page
[23:07] and a half a page on the other side
[23:09] and i looked at it today and i only
[23:11] scribbled off like three
[23:14] and i've been working hard all week
[23:16] so i got a whole list but
[23:18] i'm preaching this tonight
[23:20] and you know what i don't really care
[23:23] i'll get to it when i can
[23:26] because i'm preaching and i'm not going
[23:27] to bring more guilt on myself i'm just
[23:29] thankful i have a list i don't usually
[23:31] have a list and i'm trying to work on
[23:32] that i'm ju i think it's a great
[23:34] accomplishment and i can relieve myself
[23:36] of guilt tonight that i even made a list
[23:38] of stuff i'm supposed to do praise the
[23:40] lord brother josiah praise the lord
[23:42] thank you thank you
[23:44] yes if i can just do that it's half the
[23:46] battle
[23:48] but you know we got all this we got a
[23:51] couple we got this you people that are
[23:53] ocd you better be listening is that the
[23:55] bad part of it great be organized get it
[23:58] all done but when you don't and a lot of
[24:00] times you don't
[24:04] self-guilt
[24:06] guilt
[24:08] and you start measuring your character
[24:09] by it
[24:11] and then satan comes in and says what oh
[24:14] yeah
[24:14] i just feel like a loser this week and
[24:16] say it says yeah
[24:20] you feel like it but i really feel i
[24:22] know you are a loser
[24:26] you get all this stuff going on you're
[24:28] feeling guilt and he's he dwells in the
[24:30] realm of guilt so he jumps in and agrees
[24:32] with you
[24:35] yeah you you're really
[24:37] man who do you think you are you just
[24:39] can't ever measure up to stuff that
[24:41] you're supposed to get done
[24:44] guilt is a real thing that's in our
[24:46] lives that sometimes we bring on
[24:48] ourselves
[24:51] so i want to separate and say if god
[24:55] if you've done something wrong
[24:57] and god brings conviction about it
[24:59] make that right and bring it under the
[25:01] blood of jesus christ even god asking us
[25:04] to do that
[25:05] you know why it's to do it so that you
[25:07] don't live with days of guilt
[25:11] god
[25:12] does not want you living with any guilt
[25:18] so whether it's self-inflicted or
[25:20] whether it's someone else because we
[25:22] examine we over examine ourselves
[25:25] we have people around us who know us too
[25:27] well and put guilt on us
[25:29] we're afraid to not keep examining
[25:32] ourselves if we don't examine ourselves
[25:33] enough we get too confident i might get
[25:36] too confident it might get too arrogant
[25:38] so we just keep examining ourselves
[25:41] we shy clear of really enjoying our
[25:43] sinless place in christ
[25:46] lest we should get off track
[25:52] i said way shy clear of really enjoying
[25:56] our sinless place in christ
[25:59] because we're afraid
[26:01] that we might get off track
[26:04] i got a quote in a minute for you
[26:06] it's going to blow your mind
[26:10] you see so much guilt the devil uses
[26:12] that is not necessary
[26:14] there's a necessary guilt that comes
[26:15] with the conviction of sin
[26:18] but most of the other guilt is not
[26:19] necessary and even the true guilt and
[26:22] conviction is only temporary god wants
[26:26] you to be relieved of it when you truly
[26:28] sincerely bring it under the blood of
[26:30] jesus christ god forgive me i made a
[26:33] mistake i'm appealing to my great high
[26:36] priest
[26:37] who can be touched by the feeling of
[26:39] infirmities i'm leaving at your butt i
[26:41] mean it lord and i mean it so much help
[26:43] me never to do that again
[26:46] that's a repentant heart
[26:49] and then he washes it away and the bible
[26:51] says if we confess our sins he's
[26:53] faithful and just to forgive our sins
[26:57] so that our guilt can be relieved
[27:01] can i get an amen from
[27:04] someone hallelujah
[27:08] so
[27:09] the bride in this hour can i let you
[27:12] know where the bride stands
[27:14] the bride in this last days received an
[27:17] announcement in the first person from
[27:19] god
[27:22] saying you are the pure virtuous sinless
[27:26] bride of jesus christ you never sinned
[27:28] in the first place
[27:30] you are justified that means you have
[27:32] been declared righteous and you have
[27:34] been cleared in court as the brother
[27:37] priest said sunday you can't have it
[27:38] both ways you can't believe that christ
[27:41] became sin for us unless you believe
[27:43] that
[27:44] we become the righteousness of god
[27:46] that act at calvary did two things
[27:49] that's to take our sin but it's to make
[27:51] us the righteousness of god and you
[27:53] can't have one without the other
[27:56] the bride is the pure sinless virtuous
[27:58] bride of jesus christ you never sinned
[28:01] in the first place you're justified
[28:03] declared righteous and clear that means
[28:05] to be cleared in court that you are
[28:08] innocent you are a virgin you are in
[28:10] good standing with god it is an
[28:12] unchangeable verdict it can't be
[28:16] appealed
[28:21] can we give a handcuff of praise tonight
[28:24] can't be appealed
[28:26] [Applause]
[28:28] satan buffets satan yells he doesn't
[28:30] like the pronouncement he doesn't like
[28:32] what was said by the prophet unless that
[28:34] stays about the bride he doesn't like
[28:36] that at all but he can't appeal it he
[28:38] can't change it it has been declared can
[28:40] you say man
[28:43] the life in the blood of jesus christ
[28:45] who is the word has picked us up and
[28:48] placed us back into an innocent pure
[28:51] state in the eyes of god and i'm not
[28:54] talking about the person who's sitting
[28:55] next to you just them i'm talking about
[28:57] you tonight
[29:00] i'm talking about you
[29:02] that the blood of christ has placed us
[29:04] back into the innocent pure state that's
[29:06] the bright standing with god now
[29:10] that's what he said about you
[29:13] those listening on the internet that's
[29:14] what he said about you
[29:17] and i'd rather believe what he said
[29:19] about me
[29:21] in court
[29:23] than what i even believe about myself
[29:28] let's talk about your enemy each day
[29:31] who's this
[29:32] who is this
[29:34] creature
[29:37] who is this accuser of the brethren well
[29:41] he's a creature
[29:43] who's had a pronouncement on him too
[29:49] he has been exposed in the last days
[29:52] from the garden of eden actually before
[29:55] that
[29:56] with lucer he's been exposed from the
[29:58] very beginning before the beginning
[30:00] he's been exposed from the garden to the
[30:03] antichrist spirit at the end through the
[30:05] message of the hour he's been exposed
[30:07] from the garden to the antichrist spirit
[30:10] and everything in between
[30:15] the fivefold ministry today the true
[30:17] fivefold ministry not just any christian
[30:20] preacher we appreciate all of them but
[30:21] there is a fivefold ministry that are
[30:24] preaching the trail of the serpent the
[30:25] last 50 years until we have seen satan
[30:28] as the judged one as jesus said you can
[30:31] read it in your bible the prince of this
[30:34] world is judged jesus said it the prince
[30:37] of this world is judged
[30:40] there's been a pronouncement he is the
[30:42] god of this evil age and he's being
[30:45] exposed and by being exposed he is a
[30:48] creature who lives with guilt
[30:54] he's a creature that's under
[30:56] condemnation because he's been condemned
[31:01] he's a creature that never really even
[31:04] had a chance even though he wants one so
[31:06] bad he's a creature that wanted creative
[31:09] power like adam and eve had and he can
[31:12] never get it he's never had it and he
[31:14] will never have it can you say man
[31:17] he's a creature that's been condemned
[31:19] and lives under guilt no wonder he talks
[31:22] to believers every day and spills over
[31:25] his guilt over to you because he's a
[31:27] creature of guilt
[31:31] he's a creature of condemnation
[31:35] unless we give him power he has no power
[31:38] he sits in a corner some way all just
[31:41] shriveled up and down and can't have any
[31:43] release in the believer's life unless we
[31:46] give him room and then he steps up and
[31:48] starts to try to take over every time
[31:50] but when he's in his condition without
[31:52] any place or power he stands as a
[31:54] condemned convicted
[31:58] guilty
[32:00] creature
[32:02] judgment pronounced all the way back in
[32:04] the garden even
[32:06] on the serpent can you say amen
[32:09] so he being jealous of your innocence
[32:12] which you didn't even earn
[32:16] he's jealous of your innocence
[32:19] he's jealous of your freedom
[32:22] he's jealous
[32:26] that he can't be free
[32:28] like some of your sunday in the service
[32:30] was so free i mean when they sang that
[32:33] special the holy spirit came down
[32:35] and
[32:36] can you say man we had church just with
[32:39] the special
[32:40] [Music]
[32:41] and satan's in the wings saying
[32:44] i don't have that freedom and he's
[32:45] jealous of the people who do
[32:49] i'm preaching tonight whether i get
[32:51] amens or not i'm telling you i'm
[32:53] exposing this guy that talks to you
[32:55] every day is a guilty creature he's
[32:58] condemned his days are numbered and
[33:00] there isn't any reason to continue to
[33:03] listen to his voices
[33:06] [Applause]
[33:10] he's jealous of your innocence he's
[33:12] jealous of your freedom he seeks to
[33:14] transfer some of his guilt on you you
[33:16] ever meet someone who is guilty and
[33:18] they're trying to transfer some of that
[33:20] guilt on you because it makes them feel
[33:22] better that's right passing the guilt
[33:25] over
[33:26] blaming somebody else the blame game
[33:30] they're the victim
[33:32] they're under a lot of condemnation a
[33:34] lot of guilt a lot of things and they
[33:36] try to distribute it on to other people
[33:38] they're the reason that i'm doing wrong
[33:40] and they're the reason i'm not living
[33:42] right the church yeah they're those
[33:44] people at the church they're my problem
[33:46] and
[33:47] and you better be careful because you
[33:49] got to own up to where you're at
[33:52] satan's a creature that wants to
[33:53] transfer the guilt
[33:56] so all of this and i hope i've talked
[33:58] about it enough all of this
[34:01] in this atmosphere
[34:03] i think we can be affected by it to the
[34:06] place we carry
[34:08] too much guilt
[34:12] i said
[34:13] we carry way too much guilt
[34:19] i said you you carry way too much guilt
[34:22] on a daily basis
[34:23] we're actually probably carrying more
[34:25] guilt
[34:27] than what we should be
[34:31] and boy the psychological side of it
[34:34] which i'm not allowed to talk about that
[34:36] because people think i'm a psychologist
[34:37] but the psychological side is it has all
[34:39] kinds of
[34:41] spillover of fruit it can be different
[34:44] fruit in people's lives you know
[34:46] some people they just talk too much or
[34:48] some people don't talk at all and they
[34:50] clam up and there's a lot of different
[34:52] results that come from somebody who's
[34:54] really under complexes and under guilt
[34:57] and
[34:58] satan has beat them down so much and
[35:01] they don't realize god doesn't want them
[35:03] to live every day in a state of feeling
[35:06] guilty
[35:08] when we're under this friends and i just
[35:11] want to say that we carry way too much
[35:12] guilt
[35:13] and some of us dish out too much
[35:20] i'll take a drink of water on that one
[35:27] maybe we dish it out too much because
[35:29] we're under it
[35:33] it's not right
[35:34] to just keep making everybody else feel
[35:36] guilty
[35:42] it's not your job to make somebody feel
[35:44] guilty
[35:45] if god uses to speak somebody in
[35:46] christian love and brings godly
[35:48] conviction great but that's a different
[35:49] story than constantly putting guilt on
[35:51] people that they never measure up
[35:54] you'll never measure up you'll never be
[35:55] anything look at you failing again look
[35:58] at this
[35:59] you tell your children that you see how
[36:00] your children turn out
[36:03] maybe you're a person that got that from
[36:04] your parents
[36:06] and only the hope of the cross of christ
[36:08] and the believers and
[36:10] images in the body of christ can help
[36:12] build that back up where you get you
[36:14] find your identity in in the word and in
[36:16] christ
[36:17] but that affects the human spirit to be
[36:19] beat down all the time to be told you're
[36:21] a loser to be told you'll never be
[36:23] successful in life you'll never make it
[36:25] you'll never do all these things
[36:27] and guilt is passed on
[36:29] in other words it's dished out
[36:32] and when we're dishing it out or we're
[36:33] giving too much of it i ask you to
[36:34] examine your life tonight when we're
[36:36] carrying too much ourselves or we're
[36:38] dishing it out it's time to step back
[36:40] and say
[36:42] why
[36:43] do i need to carry any of this or dish
[36:46] this out why do i need to feel bad all
[36:49] the time
[36:52] why do i as a believer have to continue
[36:54] with all this guilt i'm living under a
[36:56] different covenant
[37:00] i'm living under a covenant that there's
[37:03] no guilt in that covenant
[37:06] my desire is resonating inside and it
[37:10] it's a it's resonating delighting in god
[37:13] i know my desires i delight in god can
[37:16] anybody say that here tonight
[37:18] because i think it would be good if you
[37:19] truly know that what resonates deep down
[37:22] in the regions of your soul is a a
[37:25] burning desire for more of god i ask you
[37:27] to raise your hand to the devil right
[37:29] now just say i know that that's
[37:31] resonating in my soul
[37:36] all right thank you praise the lord
[37:38] don't raise your hand unless you yeah
[37:39] and to you might need the holy ghost or
[37:41] you might need you might need something
[37:43] greater or greater feeling i don't know
[37:45] but god knows what you need but i'll
[37:46] tell you you need to tell the devil
[37:48] sometimes if you know that desire is
[37:50] resonating for more of him then you've
[37:52] got to tell them that's why i say raise
[37:53] your hand again some of you are too i'm
[37:55] surprised
[37:58] you don't have to participate i guess so
[38:02] i know that no matter what my mistakes
[38:05] are i know that i have a desire in here
[38:08] a burning desire for more of god
[38:12] amen
[38:14] so you can do it in church but when it's
[38:16] getting heated with the devil that's
[38:18] when you have to remind him wait a
[38:19] minute wait a minute
[38:21] god's looking at my desires here
[38:23] i brought that under the blood the other
[38:25] day satan my desire is burning can you
[38:28] say man my desire read it delights in
[38:31] god delights in the law of god it's not
[38:33] tainted it's pure and when my flesh gets
[38:36] out of the way my loving father is going
[38:39] to correct me
[38:41] so when i satan when i do make a mistake
[38:43] my loving father is going to correct me
[38:45] and bring him out back on track satan if
[38:48] you're telling me you're getting off
[38:49] track you're getting off track you're
[38:50] getting off track oh my i don't want to
[38:52] do that but i got a loving god that if i
[38:54] listen to him he's going to bring me
[38:55] back on track tell the devil this god
[38:58] he's going to bring me back on track
[39:01] [Applause]
[39:02] but you said something wrong the other
[39:04] day look at the thought that you did i
[39:05] know i did but i brought that under the
[39:07] blood i'm sorry for that and now my
[39:09] god's going to bring me back on track
[39:11] because that's my god i sir
[39:17] praise the lord
[39:20] amen
[39:22] supposed to stay behind the pulpit on
[39:24] wednesday nights
[39:27] i can't wake some of you up tonight i
[39:29] don't know what i'm going to do
[39:32] i'm a believer
[39:34] when i make a mistake
[39:35] i have a place to take that mistake
[39:39] are you thankful tonight you have a
[39:40] place to bring your mistakes
[39:42] [Applause]
[39:44] there's a lot of people that don't have
[39:45] that place they don't know about it i'm
[39:47] saying but you know and you have a place
[39:51] you have a scripture that says if you'll
[39:53] sincerely confess i'll be faithful to
[39:56] forgive you of that mistake i have a
[39:59] place to bring my mistakes
[40:01] hallelujah i have a place to come
[40:04] with my sin and my
[40:08] mistakes i don't know about others but
[40:11] he's given me a place to bring it
[40:13] i have a city of refuge
[40:16] it's in jesus christ
[40:19] he gave me a city of refuge to run into
[40:22] and i say to the elders i didn't mean to
[40:24] do that i'm so sorry for doing it there
[40:26] was nothing in my heart that i wanted to
[40:28] do that but i made a mistake and the
[40:30] elders say you can stay in this city of
[40:33] refuge and the enemy can't get to you
[40:38] hallelujah
[40:40] [Applause]
[40:43] amen i have a place to go with my
[40:45] mistakes
[40:47] but this feeling of guilty
[40:49] when i haven't done it nothing that's
[40:52] crazy
[40:54] i want to lay something in here there's
[40:55] two sides
[40:58] to this guilt in the webster's
[41:00] dictionary
[41:02] there's two sides to this
[41:04] one side of guilt one meaning of guilt
[41:06] is a remorseful awareness that you have
[41:09] done something wrong
[41:11] a remorseful awareness that you've done
[41:13] something wrong
[41:14] so
[41:15] we have that and i'll let you know
[41:17] this guilt a remorseful awareness that
[41:20] you've done something wrong was so
[41:21] deeply ingrained in us
[41:24] when we were born
[41:27] condemnation
[41:28] by representation
[41:30] before you did anything wrong
[41:33] you were born with condemnation
[41:35] so guilt came with our birth
[41:38] you start growing up and you you already
[41:40] feel there's a there's a cloud
[41:43] you're born with condemnation you're
[41:44] born with guilt by nature you're born
[41:46] with the guilt of sin by nature that
[41:48] serpent nature is tied to satan and his
[41:51] condemned defeated state has been on us
[41:54] since we are cursed because we come
[41:56] under the curse and that's where it all
[41:58] started
[42:00] satan felt like dirt
[42:04] and makes you feel like dirt
[42:06] because he was cast to the dirt
[42:12] maybe the reason you feel like dirt is
[42:16] because the one that was cursed to dirt
[42:20] is talking to you every day
[42:28] we're born with that by representation
[42:30] it's called the guilt of sin but i got
[42:31] to quote if you guys would bring it up
[42:33] the guilt of sin and we're guilty but
[42:35] calvary came through with not only an
[42:37] atonement but a release from the guilt
[42:40] of sin how many can say man that calvary
[42:43] came through not only with an atonement
[42:45] for our sin but a release from the guilt
[42:47] of sin can you say amen
[42:51] calvary not only paid for our sins but
[42:54] it released us from the guilt of sin
[43:00] that's what you see in this scripture
[43:02] that i read and which i won't have time
[43:03] to talk about now but you can see the
[43:05] type is that he says when you go into
[43:07] the promised land now remember they
[43:09] already had a sacrificial lamb they
[43:11] already applied the token in egypt they
[43:13] already had a lamb that was until they
[43:15] carried the lamb they brought the lamb
[43:17] for their sins so they had a lamb for
[43:19] their sin but that wasn't enough god
[43:21] says when you go into the promised land
[43:23] build three cities they're the cities of
[43:25] refuge because the lamb is taking care
[43:28] of your sin but if you feel guilt
[43:30] he's saying i'll take care of the guilt
[43:33] as well
[43:36] god does not only want to take care of
[43:38] your sin but he doesn't want you to live
[43:40] in guilt
[43:42] he wants you to run to the city of
[43:43] refuge every day
[43:47] i have a place i can run
[43:50] and live guilt-free
[43:56] you know for the last 30 years we have
[43:58] all this guilt-free food
[44:01] did you ever notice it was never called
[44:03] that to the last 30 years something like
[44:06] that and you know the bride comes into
[44:08] her guilt-free living
[44:10] and all the natural types of spirits so
[44:11] now we have all this guilt-free food why
[44:13] because all the stuff you ate before it
[44:15] brings guilt on you
[44:17] and now you can eat guilt-free ice cream
[44:22] which tastes terrible
[44:26] i'd rather wait a year and have a real
[44:28] ice cream
[44:30] thanks brother joe he agrees with me
[44:34] guilt-free this and guilt free that and
[44:36] guilt free this and i tell you
[44:39] god took care of not only our sins
[44:43] but he gave us a city of refuge every
[44:45] day that we can run into
[44:47] and be
[44:48] safe from the life of guilt
[44:55] oh i'm enjoying this tonight
[44:57] all right you got that quote up there
[44:58] sis
[45:00] listen to this this is so powerful just
[45:02] one quote tonight
[45:05] oh here it is hey how you doing
[45:07] now you you are a believer but god
[45:09] doesn't recognize your faith until he
[45:11] proves it to you amen oh brother let me
[45:13] tell you something when your faith it
[45:15] might be recognized in your own thoughts
[45:18] but when it sees you can in your own
[45:20] thoughts i'm saved and
[45:22] all that but when it comes into god's
[45:24] thoughts god seals that faith by the
[45:26] baptism of the holy ghost
[45:29] abraham believed god
[45:31] and it was imputed to him for
[45:33] righteousness
[45:34] and god give him the seal of
[45:36] circumcision as a sign that he had
[45:39] accepted him
[45:41] hallelujah
[45:42] and so god it's just once again this so
[45:44] just leave that up there if you would
[45:46] god is just sealing when you're using
[45:48] the word seal he's sealing this up
[45:52] it's no haphazard thing that you're
[45:54] gonna you're gonna get saved but you're
[45:56] gonna live with guilt the rest of your
[45:57] life no he seals it and he comes back
[46:00] and identifies by the circumstance of
[46:01] the holy ghost that evidence of the holy
[46:03] ghost in your life he seals this up
[46:05] brother brahm says it this way in one
[46:06] place he seals god in and he seals the
[46:10] devil out
[46:12] it's a seal
[46:14] it can't be changed
[46:17] it's pretty settled
[46:20] and uh the seal of the living god search
[46:22] the scriptures and the baptism the holy
[46:24] ghost upon the human heart ephesians 4
[46:26] 30 says grieve not the holy spirit of
[46:28] god whereby you're sealed unto the day
[46:30] of your redemption the seal of god god's
[46:33] recognition as you as a believer seals
[46:36] you into the body by the baptism of the
[46:39] holy spirit
[46:40] then if you haven't been deceived to
[46:42] believe some theory some feeling some
[46:45] something or another which is all right
[46:47] i have nothing against it whatever god
[46:50] uh give it whatever way god give it to
[46:52] you that's god's business and yours you
[46:53] see but when a man is ever born of the
[46:56] spirit of god you'll find him just as
[46:59] boldly
[47:01] and humbly
[47:03] as he can be
[47:04] walk up to the throne of grace and know
[47:08] that he has a right to eat from the tree
[47:11] of life
[47:14] i like that boldly
[47:17] but humbly
[47:19] and he has a right with the baptism the
[47:21] holy ghost he walks up he's not afraid
[47:23] of the enemy he's not afraid of the
[47:25] indies condemnation can you say amen he
[47:27] says just as sure for something has
[47:30] happened to that individual that is
[47:33] experienced of him that he never found
[47:36] anywhere else in the world
[47:39] and every man or woman that's born of
[47:41] the spirit of god has an experience
[47:44] within themselves that they know
[47:46] directly when it happened how it
[47:49] happened and what kind of effect it had
[47:51] on them
[47:52] every man and woman that's ever been
[47:54] born in the spirit of god something
[47:55] happened just something changes it's
[47:57] what is it it's a conversion as we said
[48:00] this morning you got an o sheet there
[48:02] just as dirty as it can be full of ink
[48:05] and everything else nothing can take it
[48:07] away you dip it that down in the full
[48:09] box of clorox full a can full of clorox
[48:12] or a tub bring it back out it's just as
[48:14] white as it can be
[48:17] that's what the blood of jesus christ
[48:19] does to the believer that confesses his
[48:20] sin
[48:21] it is there is a fountain filled with
[48:24] blood
[48:25] drawn from emmanuel's veins when sinners
[48:28] plunged beneath the flood
[48:30] lose all their guilty stain
[48:35] then when god shakes the sheet and sees
[48:37] that it's dried out by the holy winds of
[48:40] god
[48:41] coming like a rushing mighty wind from
[48:43] heaven he takes the holy spirit seals
[48:46] that to the day of redemption like that
[48:47] then the devil looks upon that seal he
[48:50] can't come to it he can tease it
[48:53] and buzz at it
[48:55] and fuss at it
[48:57] but he can't get into it
[49:00] that's right he can't get it because
[49:03] there's a seal of god that forbids him
[49:06] hallelujah
[49:08] forbids him to touch it
[49:11] that's god's
[49:12] private property
[49:16] [Applause]
[49:23] yes sir
[49:26] that's what makes men walk boldly
[49:29] they're not scared
[49:31] of backsliding
[49:34] no sir
[49:35] they're not scared
[49:37] of what the devil says
[49:39] i want you to leave that last statement
[49:41] i want you to leave it up the rest of
[49:42] the service we're going to close in a
[49:44] minute
[49:45] this is what makes men walk boldly when
[49:47] they have this revelation
[49:49] they're not afraid
[49:51] of backsliding
[49:55] are you afraid of backsliding tonight
[49:57] are you scared of backsliding
[50:01] no sir they're not afraid of scared of
[50:04] sliding they're not scared
[50:06] of what the devil says
[50:11] i love that friends
[50:18] so
[50:19] this is the guilt i believe that
[50:23] the bride deals with because when we
[50:25] make a mistake we have a place to take
[50:26] it but when we have it and the devil or
[50:28] anyone makes us feel inadequate
[50:30] we're not to live in that defeated form
[50:34] i say this not only because god has a
[50:36] lamb in the old testament for sin but he
[50:39] also gave a city of refuge to run every
[50:42] time the hounds of hell was running
[50:44] after you to place guilt on you for
[50:46] something that you did
[50:48] even in innocence
[50:50] so
[50:52] i'm just gonna have to skip some of this
[50:54] now because we come to our time here
[50:58] god says i don't have to live in guilt
[51:01] and if he says that then i don't want to
[51:03] carry it
[51:05] and i don't want to dish it out
[51:08] the world is full of people trying to
[51:10] relieve their guilt of their sin
[51:14] and we have a place to bring ours
[51:18] the holy spirit conviction
[51:20] brings conviction
[51:22] you can repent of that
[51:24] but then the devil brings it over to a
[51:26] guilt trip in a judgment that something
[51:28] evil is inside your heart you can't let
[51:30] him do that
[51:32] can't let him do that can you say amen
[51:37] so others some other things in here on
[51:39] guilt maybe that i'll touch another time
[51:49] mary and martha were there and mary was
[51:52] sitting
[51:53] listening
[51:54] at the feet of jesus
[51:57] martha was a worker
[51:59] bee
[52:01] working for the master
[52:04] i find it interesting about martha that
[52:06] she was
[52:07] it's all wonderful that she was working
[52:09] so hard for the master
[52:11] but that wasn't good enough she had to
[52:13] try to make mary feel guilty
[52:18] she wasn't doing what she was doing
[52:20] anybody ever had any people like that in
[52:22] your life
[52:24] i've had way too many
[52:26] and i've probably been that to other
[52:27] people
[52:29] you're not doing enough
[52:31] you're not serving enough you're not
[52:33] you're not you're not punching out
[52:34] enough you're not carrying your your
[52:36] side of the deal
[52:40] and she's making her
[52:43] because the bible said she was
[52:44] encumbered which means she was driven
[52:47] about mentally
[52:49] to be over occupied
[52:52] to be too busy
[52:54] cumber means that
[52:56] to draw around to draw away to be driven
[52:59] mentally to be distracted
[53:01] in essence to be over occupied too busy
[53:03] about a certain thing
[53:06] but it wasn't good enough that she was
[53:08] too busy she made mary feel like
[53:12] she wasn't doing the right thing and
[53:13] jesus said
[53:15] mary has chosen
[53:18] jesus wasn't saying being lazy and don't
[53:20] work
[53:21] but he says at this point it was
[53:23] important for her to choose this and she
[53:24] chose the right thing
[53:28] if i don't get to all the sacrifices and
[53:30] i'll tell you i'm a lafontaine we dream
[53:33] and we're constantly thinking of stuff
[53:34] that we can do for the kingdom of god
[53:37] it's a part of our blood
[53:39] but if i don't get to all the sacrifices
[53:41] i can make for others
[53:44] but i made it a priority to sit at jesus
[53:46] feet when the time came
[53:48] jesus says there's no guilt about that
[53:54] you chose wisely
[53:58] our text says
[54:01] put away the guilt
[54:04] of innocent blood
[54:06] in these places to run these cities i
[54:08] tell you this is a god rich in mercy
[54:11] in god's heart was to provide a place of
[54:14] peace
[54:15] for the innocent so they can live
[54:18] without guilt and without the hounds of
[54:21] hell talking to them and running after
[54:24] them
[54:25] you did something wrong you did
[54:26] something wrong you did something wrong
[54:28] did something wrong you did something
[54:29] wrong there's something wrong and they
[54:31] can all day
[54:32] get something
[54:34] you did something you're guilty you're
[54:35] guilty you're guilty
[54:37] i find it interesting in that scripture
[54:39] it's about the heart
[54:41] because in that case they did something
[54:43] wrong
[54:44] but it wasn't the desire of their heart
[54:46] to do it
[54:47] so they came before the elder said i am
[54:49] so sorry i i did not mean to do that
[54:53] and god says i'm judging them from their
[54:56] heart
[54:59] put away the guilt of innocent blood
[55:02] do not apologize for it make it right
[55:06] but once you've done that
[55:08] put away
[55:09] the guilt
[55:13] put away the guilt
[55:15] don't let satan
[55:17] hound you
[55:19] with the guilt can you say amen let's
[55:21] stand together
[55:22] [Applause]
[55:24] live without the guilt god wants you to
[55:25] do that
[55:29] live without the condemnation god wants
[55:31] you to do that it's not god condemning
[55:33] you
[55:35] live in freedom
[55:37] live in victory
[55:38] if you've done something wrong to god or
[55:40] to someone else make it right
[55:43] god i'm sorry i bring that under the
[55:45] blood of the lamb you gave me a place to
[55:47] bring it and i'm bringing it there i'm
[55:49] not going to bring it to psychology or
[55:50] bring it to something or i'm not going
[55:52] to ask advice and google it i'm going to
[55:54] bring it to the cross i'd done wrong
[55:56] lord forgive me
[55:58] but look at the heart and look what
[56:00] god's saying is that even when you do
[56:02] something that his intentions was not to
[56:05] do that
[56:06] god says i'll forgive you of it but
[56:09] don't you dare
[56:10] let satan hound you with the guilt
[56:15] because in god's eyes you're innocent
[56:19] once it's confessed it's just the bleach
[56:21] just
[56:22] and you can't find a stain of it can't
[56:24] find a stain of it
[56:26] can't find a trace of that anywhere it's
[56:30] a white sheet that stands there is there
[56:33] between you and god and satan can't get
[56:35] it he can't penetrate it and all he can
[56:38] do is just buzz around it
[56:42] just hit it a little bit
[56:47] ruffle with it a little bit but he can't
[56:49] get past
[56:51] that white sheet
[56:53] he can't get past how god looks at you
[56:57] there's only one way god can look at you
[56:58] and that's through the blood of calvary
[57:00] there's only one there's no other way
[57:01] god can look at you is anybody listening
[57:03] tonight there's only one way that god
[57:06] can look at a believer and that's
[57:08] through his blood
[57:12] oh i remember a minister bringing up one
[57:14] time the three
[57:15] the three crosses there and one on the
[57:18] other side he's not being humble but
[57:20] this guy over here and they had been
[57:22] blooded and i don't know if they got a
[57:23] crown of thorns he did but they had
[57:25] blood all over them and this minister
[57:28] said it's so wonderful he says the first
[57:30] time he says this blood was around there
[57:32] was blood on all of them and this
[57:34] person's reaching out and says
[57:37] lord
[57:39] hadn't even been saved hadn't been
[57:41] baptized
[57:42] remember me
[57:43] when you come into your kingdom
[57:46] and he said the first time that jesus
[57:49] eyes look through the
[57:52] blood he looked at him and said today
[57:57] you will be with me in paradise
[58:00] [Applause]
[58:03] first time he looks through the blood
[58:05] and the man gets salvation in the
[58:07] kingdom of god
[58:08] [Applause]
[58:10] that's the power of when he's looking
[58:14] through the blood
[58:15] he only sees you one way
[58:18] i tell you this has been a good
[58:19] wednesday night service
