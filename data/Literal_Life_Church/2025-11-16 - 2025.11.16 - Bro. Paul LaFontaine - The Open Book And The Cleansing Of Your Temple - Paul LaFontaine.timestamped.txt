[17:28] throne. They were told
[17:32] that he would spare
[17:36] their lives
[17:38] if they would renounce
[17:42] the name
[17:44] of Christ.
[17:46] But one by one
[17:50] they chose to die,
[17:54] the son of God. They would not be
[18:02] like a great

[20:16] to honor
[20:18] his
[20:20] command.

[33:51] dependence, total dependence on him this
[33:54] morning. And he is truly the great one
[33:56] among us. He's the one who wants to make
[33:58] himself known more to you. As he does
[34:01] that, then we know ourselves more, know
[34:03] our purpose, his will for our lives as
[34:06] he reveals more of himself. And that's
[34:08] what we desire him to do this morning.
[34:10] God bless you all in Christian
[34:12] fellowship. May the Lord bless the word
[34:14] in our time and breaking bread together
[34:16] today and appreciate the atmosphere that
[34:19] you've created and inviting our Lord to
[34:21] be among us and uh whatever doubts or
[34:24] whatever fears or whatever you've been
[34:26] through I believe uh there's presence of
[34:29] someone among us today that knows all
[34:32] about it
[34:33] &gt;&gt; and he's he's he's got the answer. It's
[34:35] not not that he got the has the answer.
[34:37] He is the answer.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; He is the answer. I just like to I
[34:42] forget to do this sometimes but I greet
[34:43] the people who are listening different
[34:45] places and some a part of our assembly
[34:48] some not. Um I was with a a young
[34:51] wonderful sister from South Korea last
[34:54] weekend at the youth camp and she
[34:56] listens in faithfully from South Korea.
[34:58] So I greet you sis if you're listening
[35:00] this morning and many others that said
[35:03] that they listen in sometimes and uh so
[35:05] we appreciate them. A couple weeks ago,
[35:07] we had John and Karen Edwards here from
[35:08] upstate New York, and they'll be coming
[35:11] here once a month. And uh so we greet
[35:13] them as well this morning. Any others
[35:15] who are listening, God bless you, and
[35:17] may uh it's not it's not like being
[35:19] here, but it's a second best thing, I
[35:22] guess. So, we pray that God will bless
[35:23] you and grow you in the Lord. Have some
[35:25] upcoming meetings next weekend, and uh
[35:28] we have uh brother Chris Kathy is
[35:30] stopping by this Wednesday. We'll have
[35:32] him. And then there's a couple
[35:34] fellowship Saturday. I'm not sure if
[35:36] we've already have the deadline for
[35:38] that, but maybe if you let Miriam know
[35:40] and you talk to me, I'll get you in if
[35:42] you're late. U but I think it's
[35:45] Saturday. We're meeting at 5, I believe
[35:47] it is there at 5:00 p.m. It's a nice
[35:49] time of fellowship and each of our
[35:50] congregation gets to invite one other
[35:52] couple if they want. Brother Jeremy
[35:54] Shriner will be with us for that and
[35:55] also Sunday morning. He's from Amarillo,
[35:57] Texas. And uh you enjoy his ministry. We
[36:00] had him last year at the winter youth
[36:01] retreat. Praise the Lord. I want to
[36:02] welcome brother Kyle, sister Carrie
[36:04] Wyart with us this morning and Josiah
[36:07] Koli and all their families and whoever
[36:09] whoever else is visiting. God bless you
[36:11] each one. I had some good fellowship the
[36:13] other day with brother Kyle around the
[36:14] word of God and uh he was here a couple
[36:16] years ago with young people and I told
[36:18] him I appreciated his spirit and uh so I
[36:22] just I've enjoyed his fellowship so
[36:24] much. Amen. I think that's it. So, if
[36:26] you wouldn't mind turning this morning
[36:27] in your Bibles to uh First Kings, and
[36:31] we're going to read together
[36:40] again in the story of Josiah and to go
[36:44] into that again, we've been speaking on
[36:46] that. And uh we're going to read second
[36:49] Kings
[36:51] and then we'll read in the New Testament
[36:53] as well.
[36:55] Are you happy to be in the h the Lord's
[36:57] house this morning?
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Certainly feel his presence. God
[37:00] bless you each one. I hope I didn't miss
[37:02] uh any of the announcements. I know
[37:04] Gideon made some there. Second Kings
[37:07] chapter, excuse me. Yeah. 2 Kings
[37:09] chapter 23 and we'll read a few verses
[37:12] and then we'll go to 2 Corinthians
[37:14] chapter 6. 2 Kings 23 is we read the
[37:18] word together. And the king Josiah sent,
[37:21] and they gathered unto him them all the
[37:24] elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. And
[37:26] the king went up into the house of the
[37:28] Lord, and all the men of Judah, and all
[37:31] the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him,
[37:33] and the priests, and the prophets, and
[37:35] all the people, both small and great.
[37:37] And he read in their ears all the words
[37:40] of the book of the covenant, which was
[37:42] found in the house of the Lord. I
[37:44] remember uh they found the book that had
[37:47] been lost in the temple and the temple
[37:49] was in a bad condition and so that they
[37:52] begin to read that it begin to be open
[37:54] to Josiah and then he was coming into
[37:57] action. Now he's inviting the people to
[38:00] come with him in reading this book so
[38:03] that they can maybe come to the same
[38:06] revival in their hearts that he's coming
[38:09] to by the opening of the book. You know,
[38:12] this is not uh this message and the
[38:15] opening of God's word is not just for
[38:17] you.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; I didn't get too many amens on that, but
[38:22] it wasn't just for you. Uh I believe
[38:25] it's to be passed on. And the king stood
[38:28] by a pillar and made a covenant before
[38:30] the Lord to walk after the Lord and to
[38:33] keep his commandments and his
[38:34] testimonies and his statutes with all
[38:36] their heart and all their soul to
[38:38] perform the words of this covenant that
[38:41] were written in this book. And all the
[38:42] people stood to the covenant. And the
[38:45] king commanded Hikayiah the high priest
[38:47] and the priest of the second order and
[38:49] the keepers of the door to bring forth
[38:51] out of the temple of the Lord all the
[38:53] vessels that were made for Baal and for
[38:56] the grove and for all the host of
[38:59] heaven. And he burned them without
[39:01] Jerusalem in the fields of Kidedron, and
[39:03] carried the ashes of them unto Bethl.
[39:06] And he put down the idolatrous priest
[39:08] whom the kings of the Judah had ordained
[39:11] to burn incense in the high places in
[39:13] the cities of Judah and the places round
[39:15] about Jerusalem and them also that
[39:17] burned incense unto Baal to the sun and
[39:20] to the moon and to the planets. Now, as
[39:23] I've been preaching, it's amazing. It's
[39:25] amazing that all of these idolatrous
[39:27] heathen gods, they weren't out there in
[39:30] the land somewhere. They had come so
[39:32] close to the temple of God. They were
[39:34] actually in the temple of God.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; That's an amazing thing how far things
[39:40] have gotten away. Verse six. And he
[39:42] brought out the grove from the house of
[39:44] the Lord without Jerusalem unto the
[39:46] brook Kiddran, and burned it at the
[39:48] brook kind kid kind and stamped it small
[39:51] to powder, and cast the powder thereof
[39:54] upon the graves of the children of the
[39:56] people. and he break down the houses of
[39:59] the sodomites that were by the house of
[40:03] the Lord where the women wo hangings for
[40:08] the grove. I'm hoping this morning by
[40:10] the grace of God to explain some of
[40:12] these things from the Old Testament and
[40:14] what they were and also by the help of
[40:16] the Lord to realize that they're not too
[40:18] far away from the type of idols we have
[40:21] around us today.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Uh don't ever think that that's just Old
[40:25] Testament. the the the devil's the same
[40:27] devil
[40:28] &gt;&gt; and he works the same way to cause us to
[40:31] worship something other than the true
[40:32] God. So let's go if you would to 2
[40:35] Corinthians chapter 6 and let's add this
[40:37] in so I don't have to refer to it later.
[40:40] 2 Corinthians 6 and verse 14.
[40:45] Be ye not unequally yolked together with
[40:48] unbelievers. For what fellowship hath
[40:51] righteousness with unrighteousness? What
[40:53] communion hath light with darkness? And
[40:56] what concord hath Christ with bile? Or
[40:59] what part hath he that believeth with an
[41:02] infidel? So Paul's talking about
[41:04] separation. And you know, we may shake
[41:07] hands with somebody. We may witness to
[41:09] somebody. We may have to be around other
[41:11] people who don't believe like us, but
[41:13] there cannot be a union with what God
[41:15] has given you. There cannot be a union
[41:17] with that. It just Paul's saying it just
[41:21] doesn't go together.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Now he goes into the temple. And what
[41:25] agreement hath the temple of God with
[41:28] idols.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Those two things should never be
[41:32] together.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; They never should work together.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; For ye are the temple of the living God.
[41:39] As God has said, I will dwell in them
[41:42] and walk in them, and I will be their
[41:44] God, and they shall be my people. Can
[41:47] you say amen to that? I want it to be
[41:49] that way in my temple that I would walk
[41:51] in his precepts and he would be my God
[41:53] and we are his people and all of that.
[41:55] But you can see what Paul is saying is
[41:57] that idols never belong in here and you
[41:59] can't have this type of fellowship in
[42:02] your temple if there are idols there.
[42:05] That's right.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Goes on to say, "Wherefore come out from
[42:08] among them, and be ye separate, sayeth
[42:09] the Lord. Touch not the unclean thing,
[42:11] and I will receive you, and will be a
[42:14] father unto you relationship,
[42:17] &gt;&gt; and ye shall be my sons and daughters,
[42:20] saith the Lord Almighty." I want that
[42:22] type of relationship.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; But Paul's saying, the temple of God
[42:27] doesn't go together with idols.
[42:30] &gt;&gt; So, they have to be purged. and so I can
[42:33] come to that kind of relationship.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; I want to speak on the open book and the
[42:37] cleansing of your temple. Heavenly
[42:39] Father, we ask you to enrich the word
[42:42] this morning, Lord, by your Holy Spirit.
[42:44] And Father, we put it in your hands now
[42:46] to do the work, Lord, that the word has
[42:48] promised to do. And we depend on you
[42:50] this morning for all things, every need.
[42:53] And we ask it in Jesus name. Amen. God
[42:55] bless you. You may be seated.
[42:57] Now I have been kind of itching to take
[43:01] a service on these particular things
[43:03] that were in the temple and break them
[43:05] down just simply so that we have an
[43:08] understanding that a lot of times we
[43:10] just read over scriptures but I want you
[43:13] to understand and break it down a little
[43:14] bit simpler. Um a few things I'd like to
[43:17] break down the con the condition the
[43:19] temple had reached at that day. uh what
[43:22] had been invited into the temple over
[43:24] time because uh those idols and the baal
[43:27] worship and all these things going on in
[43:29] the temple of God, they didn't come in
[43:30] there and force their way in. They had
[43:32] to be invited.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; So what had been invited into the temple
[43:36] over time? And why were false idols
[43:39] brought directly into the temple of God?
[43:41] I'd like to answer some of that. And and
[43:44] it's I I feel like saying, "How in the
[43:45] world did all of this get this close to
[43:49] the holy place of God?" The temple
[43:51] Jerusalem, that spot was God's place
[43:54] back in that day. It was the meeting
[43:56] place. It was the holy place. It was the
[43:59] place that when Solomon built that
[44:01] temple and everything was in order and
[44:03] was cleansed and and perfect, the glory
[44:06] of God came down in that place. It was
[44:08] the meeting place. It was the place that
[44:10] the people brought sacrifices. It was a
[44:12] central place for everything. How in the
[44:15] world over time, how in the world did
[44:17] these things get into the holy place of
[44:19] God? And then I want to go into the
[44:22] attention that Josiah and the people
[44:24] begin to give after they read the book
[44:27] and after the book was open to them, the
[44:29] attention, the the the soberness to how
[44:33] bad the temple was. Uh there was truly a
[44:36] hearing, recognizing, and acting upon
[44:38] the word of God. That's what brother
[44:40] Brandon preached. Hearing there stages
[44:42] hearing, but hearing is not good enough.
[44:45] Recognizing is the next stage, but then
[44:47] acting on the word of God. And Josiah
[44:49] and the people didn't just hear the
[44:51] book. They were hearing, recognizing,
[44:53] and they were acting on the book. And
[44:55] and uh because of that, they took
[44:57] specific actions to purge the temple.
[45:00] They took a they they stood up and said,
[45:02] "We're going to do this." This is what
[45:03] the word said. I don't know how they
[45:05] missed it before. I don't know if they
[45:07] become blind. I don't know what
[45:09] happened. Maybe I can get into that. But
[45:11] all I know, thanks be to God, the open
[45:13] book struck their heart in a revival. It
[45:15] put them into action and say, "We will
[45:17] no longer from this day forward allow
[45:19] God's holy place to be uh uh uh
[45:23] putrified, if I can say it that way,
[45:25] with unholy things. Something has to has
[45:28] to rise up." And listen now, God is the
[45:30] one actually that puts it on the heart
[45:32] to cleanse the temple. But the the
[45:35] people are the one that took the action.
[45:37] The people of God are the ones who apply
[45:40] the token to their home. Can I get an
[45:42] amen this morning? When brother Brandham
[45:43] preached the token, it wasn't just that
[45:45] we had the token in the end time. But it
[45:47] was not just the token. It was the
[45:48] application of the token.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; When the children of Israel had the
[45:52] blood, it wasn't just having the blood
[45:53] and lamb in their home. It was applying
[45:55] it to the doorpost of their home. So, we
[45:57] live in the hour of not just hearing the
[45:59] word, but applying the word, applying
[46:02] the token to our lives. And we're the
[46:04] ones that do that.
[46:06] We do it to our homes. We do it to our
[46:08] household. And the best place that we do
[46:10] it to is this house right here.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; So, so in other words, the the open book
[46:17] revealed the value of the temple.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; When the book was open to them, they got
[46:24] a revelation of the value of the temple.
[46:26] I talked to young people about this.
[46:28] Talked to them about it last weekend. A
[46:29] camp a few weeks ago. Lots of youth
[46:31] camps. Been invited one to in Maitius. I
[46:34] told you Wednesday night. So the Lord
[46:36] must have me still have something to say
[46:38] to the young people. I got invited to
[46:39] Maitius. I didn't even know where that
[46:41] was. Come to find out it's an island in
[46:43] the middle of the Indian Ocean.
[46:45] About the size of New Jersey.
[46:48] I'm going have to pray real hard before
[46:50] I go there. I don't know. But you know,
[46:52] when I talk to young people, I talk
[46:54] about the value of their vessel. And if
[46:56] that if you don't value your vessel as a
[46:59] vessel of the Lord, then you won't
[47:01] listen to the instructions that the word
[47:03] gives in order to keep your vessel pure.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Says every reference I have in the New
[47:08] Testament about telling young people to
[47:09] flee youthful lust and keep their vessel
[47:11] and their minds pure. Every reference I
[47:14] have is tied to the vessel. It's tied to
[47:16] the temple. And he says it's good not
[47:18] for a man not to touch a woman. But
[47:19] before that, he says, "Know ye not
[47:21] you're a temple of the Holy Ghost." So
[47:24] you cannot value the guidelines the word
[47:27] gives you to keep your life pure until
[47:29] you value your vessel.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; You put a high price tag, young girl, on
[47:37] your body and your mind and your spirit
[47:39] and your emotions, young guy. You value
[47:42] it that that this doesn't belong to the
[47:44] world. My mind is not a trash can for a
[47:47] bunch of junk. My vessel belongs to him.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; It's to be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[47:53] and nothing else. Can you say amen?
[47:56] &gt;&gt; When we value it, and this is what
[47:58] happened when the book was read, they
[47:59] begin to value their temple and they
[48:01] realize, my something's going on. And
[48:04] because they valued their temple, it
[48:06] revealed uh it revealed nothing can be
[48:09] right or fulfilled by God if their
[48:12] temple is not right. Let me say that
[48:13] again. The revelation they got is
[48:16] nothing can be right. And the
[48:18] fulfillment of God's promise can't be
[48:20] right until the temple is right.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; What a revelation.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Nothing can be the way it should be
[48:28] until the temple is the way that it
[48:31] should be. Why? Because that's the
[48:33] central place to the purpose of God. He
[48:35] ordained. I'm just going to be reading a
[48:37] lot of things because I got a lot to get
[48:38] to this morning. A lot of hay on my
[48:40] fork. So you just uh uh as my dad used
[48:43] to say uh I'll read quick and you listen
[48:45] fast or however he said it there. So
[48:48] because this was the central place to
[48:50] the purpose of God he ordained that
[48:53] being the center of everything. It would
[48:55] be that temple and let me just move now
[48:57] to our day. The center of the entire
[49:01] revelation is c of Christ. The center of
[49:04] where's the center? Where's the
[49:06] headquarters of the entire revelation of
[49:09] Christ? It's not that you're in a new
[49:11] movement. It's not that you're in the
[49:13] right church. It's not that you're in
[49:15] the right gathering. That's not the
[49:16] center. It's not a certain church in
[49:19] this city. Uh I I can mention cities.
[49:22] The the the gathering and the center is
[49:24] not in a certain church.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; It's not even here. Can you say amen?
[49:29] The center of the revelation is in you.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; It's in every believer. Can you say
[49:34] amen? The headquarters for this message
[49:37] is in the spiritual Jerusalem which is
[49:39] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says it this way in
[49:44] Christ the mystery of God reveal upon
[49:46] this rock. I'll build my church and the
[49:48] gates of hell will never shake it down,
[49:50] never prevail against it. I'll build my
[49:52] church upon this rock a revelation of
[49:54] Jesus Christ. Look, Christ in you makes
[49:57] him the center of life of the
[49:58] revelation. See, Christ's life in you
[50:01] makes him the center of the revelation.
[50:03] Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the
[50:05] complete revelation of Christ. Christ in
[50:08] you makes you the complete revelation of
[50:11] the whole thing. You see what God is
[50:14] trying to do.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; What's he doing it through? Through the
[50:16] message to bring you to the revelation
[50:19] that the headquarters, the center is not
[50:22] here or not in a church. It's in the
[50:24] believer of this hour.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; That's the headquarters.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; That's where God's everything he's
[50:30] doing. This whole message is summed up
[50:32] as he that is in you. The third Paul is
[50:34] summed up in he that is in you,
[50:37] &gt;&gt; not a church, not a movement.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, I should get more amens than I can't
[50:41] get enough amens. The center, the
[50:43] headquarters
[50:45] &gt;&gt; of this message
[50:46] &gt;&gt; is within every believer.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[50:52] And if that is true, then the attention
[50:55] of the condition of the of your temple
[50:58] during these times is paramount.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; I I just I wish I could just say that
[51:04] about 50 times because rather than
[51:06] having a good sermon, I'd rather the
[51:08] people here at Lift Your Life and the
[51:11] believers catch catch that the condition
[51:14] of your temple is paramount today.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; The question is, what's going on in your
[51:20] temple?
[51:21] That's good.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; What's around your temple?
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Because it has everything to do with how
[51:27] much this revelation grows.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; If there's something not right in your
[51:31] temple, it cannot be ignored. It should
[51:34] be quickly dealt with.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; If there's something wrong in your
[51:39] temple, it should be quickly dealt with
[51:41] or nothing will be right. Worship won't
[51:43] be right. Freedom won't be right. Life
[51:45] won't be right.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; What's going on in the temple is
[51:49] everything. I want to say that religion
[51:52] in all of its forms and all of its
[51:54] movements will never make your temple
[51:56] the center of God's work.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Religion is the opposite of true
[52:01] Christianity.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Religion in all of its forms and all of
[52:05] its movements, maybe even within our
[52:07] rank some religion to making this
[52:09] message out of a religion, it will you
[52:12] know what the distinction is? It'll
[52:13] never make your temple being the center
[52:15] of God's work. They will believe in
[52:17] Christ. They will go to church.
[52:20] Hope y'all are listening.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; They'll believe in Christ. They'll go to
[52:23] church. They will give their money. They
[52:25] will volunteer. They will be kind. They
[52:27] will put on the dress code of the group
[52:29] that they're in. They will believe even
[52:31] that God sent a prophet. They will
[52:33] attend some camps and meetings. You can
[52:35] attend all of that. You can be a part of
[52:37] all that and your temple be disconnected
[52:40] from the main central revelation. Right?
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Excuse me for being so straight, but
[52:45] it's the time that we look at these
[52:47] things and not separate the message
[52:51] &gt;&gt; from our temple.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; That's religion.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; And you take the extreme of that. You
[52:56] have people within Christianity and
[52:57] their vessels full of vile things and
[53:00] they're still believing that Christ
[53:03] &gt;&gt; is still believing in the Lord. But
[53:06] there's no attachment because but
[53:07] they're missing the the most important
[53:09] revelation that everything God wants to
[53:11] do is not in a church building. That's
[53:12] right.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; It's not you being a part of movement.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; It's that whatever God has, it's coming
[53:18] in you and coming out of you.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; That's the opposite of religion and
[53:22] Christianity. That's the difference in
[53:24] the two. And we must be careful not to
[53:27] make it that way oursel. People will
[53:29] believe God sent a prophet. They will
[53:30] attend things. But see their temple
[53:32] can't be disconnected. The enemy is
[53:34] always trying to misdirect people from
[53:37] this revelation.
[53:39] Satan fights this revelation.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; He said in Christ the mission, Satan
[53:44] howls at this revelation.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; And if you think that Satan stops at our
[53:50] doors in the message because we have a
[53:52] message name on the church sign, you're
[53:55] greatly mistaken. You're underestimating
[53:58] our enemy. that he gets all them to
[54:01] choose religion instead of the true
[54:03] revelation, personal revelation of
[54:05] Christ. Satan doesn't stop just because
[54:08] we have a message sign on the door. He
[54:10] wants to go for the people who are
[54:12] called to be the temples of the Lord.
[54:16] He's he's coming against and trying to
[54:18] get people that are called to be the new
[54:20] Jerusalem. Can you say amen? And try to
[54:23] get them to choose a religion.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. instead of the true word,
[54:30] &gt;&gt; instead of the true revelation of it,
[54:33] he's still trying to misdirect people to
[54:35] pride that I'm in the message or I have
[54:37] a superior knowledge. He's Satan's still
[54:40] trying to direct people that because I
[54:42] shouted and dance danced that I'm fine.
[54:47] Is Satan misdirecting people?
[54:49] &gt;&gt; You got a true revelation? You're
[54:51] welcome this morning to shout and dance
[54:53] all over all over this building. I'd be
[54:55] happy if some of you did it,
[54:58] &gt;&gt; but it better be because a revelation
[55:01] has struck your heart
[55:03] &gt;&gt; of your position in Christ.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Cuz there is stimulation with
[55:06] revelation.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I'm feeling it right
[55:09] now. I believe I'm hearing the true word
[55:11] of God and something is stirring inside
[55:13] my soul. Something's going on with me.
[55:16] Something says amen down inside. And if
[55:18] you're doing that, you ought to say,
[55:19] "Praise God, the amener is on the
[55:21] inside. My life might be in shambles
[55:24] right now. I may not have any money. I
[55:25] might be emotionally down. But one thing
[55:27] today, something down here is saying
[55:30] amen to the word of God.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Let me finish that quote in Christ the
[55:36] Mystery. What is the new birth? Then
[55:38] you'd say, "Well, Brother Brandon, what
[55:39] is the new birth?" It's the revelation
[55:41] of Jesus Christ personally to you. Amen.
[55:44] See, not you joined a church, you shook
[55:46] a hand, you done something different,
[55:49] you set a creed, you promised to live by
[55:52] a cold of rules.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; That's religion. Can you say amen?
[55:56] &gt;&gt; But Christ, the Bible, he is the word
[55:58] that was revealed to you. And no matter
[56:00] what anybody says, what takes place,
[56:02] it's Christ, pastor, priest, whatever it
[56:05] might be, it's Christ in you. That is
[56:08] the revelation that the church was built
[56:10] upon.
[56:15] Hallelujah.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; The amazing thing is how Israel become
[56:19] so disconnected with that revelation and
[56:22] allowed themselves to retain their
[56:25] Jewish name and Jehovah's name and all
[56:28] the while the temple became full of
[56:30] idols.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; How in the world did that happen?
[56:34] How can you know the commandments that
[56:36] say don't make any graven images,
[56:40] &gt;&gt; have no other gods before you? Now,
[56:43] these are the people that got the ten
[56:44] commandments. The word came to them. It
[56:47] wasn't the heathens. It wasn't anybody
[56:48] else. It was the people who received the
[56:50] ten commandments that said, "Don't have
[56:52] any graven images." It says, "Don't have
[56:54] any other gods before me." How in the
[56:57] world did the people who knew those
[56:58] commandments, it just shows we can
[57:00] become blind and hearing the very word
[57:03] Yes.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; And slowly slowly let our temple
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; become
[57:14] used for other things.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; So they had a huge connect. Had they
[57:18] forgotten that even their father Abraham
[57:22] came from a family of idol worshippers?
[57:28] Did they forget that that's the very
[57:29] thing their father Abraham that started
[57:31] this whole group of the Jews and the
[57:34] circumcised and all that? Did they
[57:36] forget that Abraham one day was in a
[57:38] home with, if you look it up, full of
[57:41] idol worshippers, full of idols even in
[57:43] their homes, set up all over the place.
[57:45] And God come and spoke to him, says, "I
[57:47] want you to get away from all that. I
[57:49] wanted you to get away from your family.
[57:51] Get away from your kindred. I've got
[57:53] another land for you and and get away
[57:55] from your father's house." He needed to
[57:58] make a separation
[58:00] &gt;&gt; from the idolatry in order to come to
[58:02] the full promise of God. I'll bring you
[58:05] to a new land. I'll multiply your
[58:08] people. See, part of it was a
[58:09] geographical promise. I'm going to give
[58:11] you a geographical piece of land, and
[58:13] it's yours. But the deeper part of the
[58:15] promise is that you'll become a nation.
[58:17] And his wife was barren.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice the second part of
[58:22] the promise wasn't literal or a
[58:24] geographical piece of land. The first
[58:26] one was a spiritual seed that would come
[58:29] from him, natural and spiritual that
[58:32] would go over the whole earth as the
[58:34] sands of the sea. He first he said the
[58:38] angel said, I just love this. He said
[58:40] it'll be like the your seed, his wife's
[58:43] barren, your seed will be like like the
[58:46] sands. And later he says, no, it won't
[58:48] be like the dust. It'll be like the
[58:50] stars above. You won't be able to number
[58:53] what's going to come out of where?
[58:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Come out of you.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Well, there's the revelation
[59:01] &gt;&gt; right there with our father Abraham is
[59:04] that second part of the promise. He
[59:06] wasn't going to go somewhere and find
[59:09] that. That promise was going to come out
[59:12] of his own loins.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; He won't go find it in a temple or a
[59:18] church. He would be the temple.
[59:20] Hallelujah.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; The promise is going to come through
[59:23] him.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; He would be the center of it all.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; And he wouldn't get to it unless he
[59:32] separated from an idolatrous family and
[59:35] all that will come out with him. It was
[59:37] not an earthly temple. It came out of
[59:39] the revelation God gave him. And in
[59:41] Josiah's time, God's grace came through
[59:44] this young king. And he had a revival, a
[59:47] personal revival in his heart that come
[59:49] from when the book was read to him. He
[59:51] had already started to repair the
[59:52] temple. Got a revelation. This temple's
[59:54] a mess. I'm going to start repair it.
[59:55] When they were repairing it, they found
[59:57] I'm just catching people up here. If you
[59:58] haven't listened, while he he gets in
[1:00:01] his heart, this temple is a mess. We're
[1:00:03] going to It's kind of like I think of
[1:00:05] people who recognize things that need to
[1:00:07] be done around this big building and the
[1:00:09] yard and everything. And God just puts
[1:00:11] in their heart that this needs to be
[1:00:12] done and they go do it. as Josiah says,
[1:00:14] "This temple needs to be repaired this,
[1:00:16] you know, let's see." And so he just
[1:00:17] begins doing that. And while they were
[1:00:19] doing it, they found the book with dust
[1:00:21] on it. And
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; that's how far they had gotten away from
[1:00:24] God.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Book was everything.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; The book of redemption is everything.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; That's why our lamb had to take the
[1:00:33] seals off it in the last days
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; because it's a book of our identity. The
[1:00:37] book is everything.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so Josiah,
[1:00:44] God's grace came through him and he his
[1:00:46] revival spilled over to everyone else.
[1:00:48] Reminds me of what brother Brandham
[1:00:50] says. You sit around and wait for the
[1:00:51] church to have a revival. He says,
[1:00:52] "Don't do that." He said, "Let it start
[1:00:54] in you and it'll break out other
[1:00:56] places." And so he got a personal
[1:00:58] revival by the book being open and read
[1:01:00] to him. And it spilled over into
[1:01:02] everyone else. And he had that book read
[1:01:04] to the whole congregation. It connected
[1:01:06] them with the revelation. Nothing goes
[1:01:09] any further if you don't have a value of
[1:01:10] the temple. And they got a revelation.
[1:01:13] The first action we need to do is to
[1:01:15] cleanse our temple and separate idols
[1:01:18] from our beloved temple.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; And notice to this people, it is not
[1:01:23] good enough just that the book was
[1:01:25] opened and being read. The book being
[1:01:28] right and the temple being wrong is not
[1:01:31] what we're looking for.
[1:01:33] Amen.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; The book being right and open to us and
[1:01:38] the temple being wrong is not what we're
[1:01:41] looking for as a congregation
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; and as people.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; In fact, I'd say maybe that's why we're
[1:01:48] not finished with all this yet.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Why isn't the rapture yet?
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Why are we gone yet? Could
[1:01:58] it be because our temple is after all
[1:02:00] these years and the message and the
[1:02:02] conventions we've been to and all the
[1:02:05] preaching and the open book and all of
[1:02:08] it? Could it be that this isn't wrapped
[1:02:10] up because our temples are still filled
[1:02:14] with other things?
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Still got some bitterness in your heart?
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Still dabbling privately in some
[1:02:23] worldliness.
[1:02:26] Pride,
[1:02:27] the need to be popular. That one's for
[1:02:30] the preachers
[1:02:32] more than anybody else.
[1:02:35] Complexes from the past
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; still binding you in your temple. We
[1:02:40] can't ignore that in our vessel. Those
[1:02:43] things in our vessel and celebrate the
[1:02:46] open book.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Doesn't work that way. Didn't work that
[1:02:53] way in Josiah's day. didn't work that
[1:02:55] way today. Don't work that way today.
[1:02:57] But I believe there's a people rising
[1:02:59] that they're saying it's not good enough
[1:03:02] that I just in a message church hearing
[1:03:04] about the open book.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; I said there's an army rising. There's a
[1:03:07] there's let the worshippers arise. Let
[1:03:10] the true worshippers arise this morning.
[1:03:12] There's a people rising and saying it's
[1:03:14] not good enough that I can celebrate the
[1:03:17] book being open. I want that book to be
[1:03:19] revealed in my life in this temple.
[1:03:21] Whatever he said is going to happen in
[1:03:23] me, I want it to be revealed in me. It's
[1:03:26] not good enough that the book is right
[1:03:27] and my temple's not right. It's not good
[1:03:30] enough that the book is right, but my
[1:03:31] mind is constantly bound for 20 years.
[1:03:34] That's not good enough. I want a freedom
[1:03:36] in my temple. I want to worship freely
[1:03:38] in my temple.
[1:03:40] There's a people rise and saying because
[1:03:42] good enough for some of you, and I'll
[1:03:44] tell you, I hate to say it. I've been a
[1:03:46] pastor long enough. Some of you, I'm
[1:03:48] going to be straight with you. You'll
[1:03:49] hear a sermon like this and go right
[1:03:51] back to your habits. But I'm praying
[1:03:53] that God would deal with you because
[1:03:55] this isn't about coming to church. It's
[1:03:58] where is your vessel every day with the
[1:04:00] Lord? What are you feeding on? What are
[1:04:02] you looking at? What kind of books are
[1:04:05] you reading?
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; And some will go back right to their
[1:04:10] habits because it's such a habit to
[1:04:12] them. But I'm praying in my own life
[1:04:14] first because the minister has to be
[1:04:16] first partaker of the fruit. God, where
[1:04:19] in my private life, where in my temple
[1:04:22] is there anything
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; that shouldn't be allowed?
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Purge it, Lord, from me.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; I'm so interested in a revival breaking
[1:04:32] in my heart and
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; breaking out other places that there's a
[1:04:36] people rising because and saying, "Take
[1:04:39] me deeper."
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; How many are with me?
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Take me deeper, Lord. Take me deeper
[1:04:45] than that. Cuz religion isn't working
[1:04:49] anymore.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Religion isn't working anymore.
[1:04:54] Every single Sunday, just like the one
[1:04:58] before,
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; religion isn't working anymore.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; I want to know my precious Jesus.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; And I want to love him like I've never
[1:05:09] loved him before.
[1:05:12] I want to know the power and the
[1:05:15] resurrection power cuz religion isn't
[1:05:19] working anymore.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord,
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; take this house of God. Take this
[1:05:31] temple, Lord.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Let it all be yours.
[1:05:36] That's why that's why
[1:05:39] re religion likes the Christmas holiday.
[1:05:41] Might as well get ready for Christmas
[1:05:43] coming up, right?
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Religion likes Christmas, you know. And
[1:05:47] I just I have this thing when they start
[1:05:52] start decorating, you know, like a month
[1:05:55] before Thanksgiving.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; I have a pet peeve about that.
[1:06:01] So my kids, you get that back in the
[1:06:03] barn.
[1:06:05] Get back because you're doing what the
[1:06:08] rest of the world. You're over you're
[1:06:09] overriding the only American Christian
[1:06:12] holiday is not Christmas. It's
[1:06:14] Thanksgiving.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Now I'm becoming very few and far
[1:06:19] between that still believe that. I I was
[1:06:21] coming back from Newark. Got home by the
[1:06:23] grace of God with all the cancellations.
[1:06:24] And I get out I'm happy to be home
[1:06:26] walking through the airport. I said, "Am
[1:06:28] I 3 weeks before Thanksgiving?" Not
[1:06:30] Christmas. Am I hearing Christmas song
[1:06:32] coming across in this airport right now?
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Am I really Is this really happening?
[1:06:39] And the righteous anger of God rose up
[1:06:42] in me.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Is this really happen? If I hear that
[1:06:49] song,
[1:06:51] last Christmas I gave him my heart. The
[1:06:56] very next day, he threw it away. Hey, I
[1:06:59] don't know what he did with it, but if I
[1:07:01] hear that song one more time, I'm going
[1:07:03] to pound my head against the wall
[1:07:07] and Santa baby as well.
[1:07:12] But the world doesn't know what
[1:07:14] Christmas is.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; And Christianity has made it's symbolism
[1:07:20] over substance.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; There's no substance what what Christmas
[1:07:24] is. It's the symbolism of it. And
[1:07:26] religion is emphasizing the symbolism of
[1:07:30] the resurrection, the cross, the
[1:07:32] symbolism, but no substance.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be that way. I want the
[1:07:38] substance of what Calvary produced.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So hopefully, you know, we'll get
[1:07:45] over this. And it's it's incredible
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; uh how quickly. But I I I pulled up this
[1:07:51] scripture last night. It's Malachi 3:1.
[1:07:53] If you guys want to pull it up,
[1:07:56] um,
[1:07:57] here's a Christmas scripture. And all of
[1:07:59] them know all the scriptures. They read
[1:08:00] them, but there's no power of the
[1:08:03] Christmas one. Look at this one. Behold,
[1:08:06] I will Here's a Christmas scripture for
[1:08:07] you. Behold, I will send my messenger,
[1:08:10] and he shall prepare the way before me.
[1:08:12] That's John the Baptist. And the Lord
[1:08:16] whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his
[1:08:21] temple. Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; That's a Christmas scripture. Yeah,
[1:08:27] that's the best one because what
[1:08:28] happened in Christ is the Lord was
[1:08:31] coming to his new temple.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't going to be Solomon's
[1:08:36] temple. It wasn't going to be the
[1:08:37] tabernacle anymore. He's revealing his
[1:08:40] revelation. The Lord will come to the
[1:08:42] true temple that he wanted to come to.
[1:08:44] He'll pour himself, 100% of himself in
[1:08:48] that little baby. Can you say amen? and
[1:08:50] he'll start the revelation that the Lord
[1:08:53] will come to his temple. On the day of
[1:08:55] Pentecost, the Lord was coming to his
[1:08:57] temple. At the end time, the Lord is
[1:09:00] coming to his temples. That's Christmas.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; That's Christmas. Can you say amen?
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, now
[1:09:12] let's go into some uh specifics here.
[1:09:14] Now
[1:09:17] over a 300year period then they become
[1:09:19] so disconnected
[1:09:22] the idols of Baal and groves come into
[1:09:25] the temple and outside groves everywhere
[1:09:27] around the temple. Things that were
[1:09:29] usually in the heathen lands were out
[1:09:32] there. You had to go many many miles to
[1:09:36] get into the uh the Canaanite land or
[1:09:39] somewhere where you found all this
[1:09:41] stuff. But now after 300 years it's it's
[1:09:43] right housed. They built houses. They
[1:09:45] built groves all around the temple and
[1:09:47] then somehow they got invited in the
[1:09:48] temple. So that's the condition. Little
[1:09:50] groves are little places of trees to
[1:09:53] gather around and speak and worship the
[1:09:56] god. So the grove could be the statue,
[1:09:58] but then the grove could be a
[1:09:59] surrounding of trees around the statue
[1:10:01] that you could come in privately and
[1:10:03] worship that grove and that statue that
[1:10:06] that began to be built all around. And
[1:10:08] they said here that they took a grove
[1:10:10] out of the temple as well. I don't know
[1:10:11] what it was. We don't know. But we know
[1:10:13] what groves are. We know what the
[1:10:15] statues are. And then of course I
[1:10:17] mentioned to you that there were houses
[1:10:19] of sodomites and prostitution, male
[1:10:21] prostitution that had built taken over
[1:10:24] houses and built houses right around the
[1:10:27] temple. Anything built by or idols in
[1:10:30] the place of God's holy place is an
[1:10:32] abomination. How many knows that Jesus
[1:10:34] quoted Daniel says when the abomination
[1:10:36] of desolation he referred to it and an
[1:10:40] abomination of desolation is something
[1:10:42] else was allowed in the holy place to be
[1:10:44] built in the holy place and it became
[1:10:46] empty of God's presence. So abomination
[1:10:48] is that there's something else in the
[1:10:50] holy place of God. The desolation is it
[1:10:53] becomes empty of God's presence because
[1:10:56] the desolation is there. Excuse me the
[1:10:58] abomination is there. So now the
[1:11:00] abomination of desolation began of
[1:11:02] course when Titus came in took the
[1:11:03] temple in that day and Jesus prophesied
[1:11:05] of that until this day till this day is
[1:11:08] still the abomination of desolation.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; But I just want to remind the devil that
[1:11:13] there's a promise for the Jews. They're
[1:11:15] going to take back over that holy place
[1:11:17] and the temple's going to be built back
[1:11:19] again. That ought to be an encouragement
[1:11:21] to you this morning. No matter what the
[1:11:24] condition of your temple, no matter what
[1:11:26] you've done, no matter how bad you've
[1:11:28] messed up, God can restore your temple
[1:11:31] to be a temple of the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; You got to start getting broken before
[1:11:36] the Lord and say, "Take me, Lord, as I
[1:11:38] am, and he'll take you." Start to
[1:11:39] rebuild the temple. So, you are the
[1:11:41] temple of the Lord. Can you say amen?
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; The bride is the new Jerusalem
[1:11:44] spiritually. You should recognize that
[1:11:46] that promise and take it back completely
[1:11:48] for the Lord. So they headed in there
[1:11:50] and they took out all the vessels of
[1:11:52] Baal and all the groves, took them out,
[1:11:54] beat them, and crushed them to powder. I
[1:11:57] just want to make a note. They This was
[1:11:58] serious business. They didn't just want
[1:12:00] to kick them out and they're laying over
[1:12:02] in the grass. They crushed these idols
[1:12:05] of Baal to powder.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; How serious should we be to crush the
[1:12:11] idols and images out of our lives?
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Crush them to powder.
[1:12:18] You talk about a revelation.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; I don't ever want to see that thing
[1:12:22] again.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Crushed it to powder, sprinkled the
[1:12:26] ashes over,
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; took some of them into uh Bethl, which
[1:12:31] is the worst uh place supposed to be the
[1:12:34] house of God. Bethl is supposed to be
[1:12:35] and it became the worst heathenistic
[1:12:37] worship in Bethl. So, they took all the
[1:12:39] ashes over there. So, now Baal, I don't
[1:12:42] have to tell uh many of you this. You
[1:12:44] know this from the history of the
[1:12:46] prophet's message and also maybe you
[1:12:47] study but for the ones who haven't Baal
[1:12:50] means lord or ruler and of all the gods
[1:12:53] that came as an influence to Israel of
[1:12:57] all the gods Baal was the biggest rival
[1:12:59] to Yahweh Baal worship became the
[1:13:02] biggest it's even mentioned over in the
[1:13:04] in the book of revelation so Baal was
[1:13:06] the biggest rival so we should look at
[1:13:07] that and realize that the biggest
[1:13:09] influence of Israel came from the god
[1:13:12] Baal goes way back origins 5,000 years
[1:13:16] ago or maybe more. We don't know. The
[1:13:19] prophet breaks it down in the church age
[1:13:20] book says Nimrod's wife deified him
[1:13:23] after her husband died. Nimrod's wife
[1:13:26] deified him after he died. She deified
[1:13:28] herself, too. That's what she did. Uh
[1:13:31] yeah, it be it's interesting to make a
[1:13:33] note that after someone dies, they deify
[1:13:36] him. That's the spirit of Satan.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; You take a prophet after he dies, people
[1:13:42] deify him. That's right.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; It's the spirit of Satan to do that.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; But she did it and she deified herself
[1:13:50] to and she made herself not only the
[1:13:51] wife of Nimrod but the mother of Nimrod
[1:13:54] and then made him the son god. Brother
[1:13:57] Bram brings it out. The son god become
[1:13:59] known as the god of storms, the god of
[1:14:01] fertility. So you have the the woman is
[1:14:04] attached to fertility of course and also
[1:14:06] god blessing and prospering the lands.
[1:14:08] And so he was the god of storms. So he
[1:14:10] had power in that area over nature and
[1:14:13] then he had power to sway men and do
[1:14:16] what he needs to for men through that uh
[1:14:18] god of fertility. And they begin to cry
[1:14:20] out to that bless our crops. But also it
[1:14:22] was related to a woman a woman's body
[1:14:25] and that became a god. A woman a woman's
[1:14:28] body was part of the statues and that
[1:14:31] became a god to the people. That was
[1:14:33] never meant to be for that to happen.
[1:14:35] One true Jehovah God that they didn't
[1:14:37] have an image of necessarily. He didn't
[1:14:38] want images of that. But they put images
[1:14:41] and this is what it was a power over
[1:14:43] nature in turn to bring us power over
[1:14:47] I'm just saying these way because this
[1:14:48] is the way I interpret it. When they
[1:14:50] begin to worship that it's dealing with
[1:14:52] something in men wanting to worship a
[1:14:53] god that had power over nature another
[1:14:56] god that had power of nature that would
[1:14:58] in turn m make us think that we had
[1:15:00] power over nature. We don't have power
[1:15:03] over nature ourselves. Right?
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Nature controls us. So now this God
[1:15:10] became nature controlling us and women
[1:15:13] controlling us. Maybe because she
[1:15:15] birthed us. And then brother Bram takes
[1:15:17] it now all the way to Satan coming into
[1:15:19] the Christian church,
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; And bringing that whole worshiping of
[1:15:23] mother,
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; the mother of Jesus and the son, son
[1:15:28] God, which became su became sached
[1:15:32] it together and now we have Christmas.
[1:15:35] We have all this stuff that come, but it
[1:15:37] originated, you know, some 5,000 years
[1:15:39] ago.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; The whole precept is deception, and
[1:15:42] Satan brings it into the Christian
[1:15:44] church.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to summarize. Satan was
[1:15:48] wanting to misdirect things away from
[1:15:50] God. And that's why he did the mother
[1:15:52] and son. Even a dual or multiple God
[1:15:56] worship was against the ten
[1:15:57] commandments. Here, O Israel, the Lord
[1:15:59] our God is one Lord. And whatever you
[1:16:02] split it into two or three or 500,
[1:16:06] you're talking the opposite of
[1:16:07] Christianity because Christianity and
[1:16:09] actually the true Jews, it's one God.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't that simplify things a
[1:16:15] little bit. I I always look at it that
[1:16:17] way. You know, Brother Kyle was just
[1:16:18] like that's it's one Lord, one faith,
[1:16:21] one baptism. When we start to get into
[1:16:23] multiple choices here, uh it's like Leo
[1:16:26] Deia,
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; but it's simple. There's only one Lord.
[1:16:29] There's only one faith. There's only one
[1:16:30] baptism.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; There's not 335 different denominations
[1:16:34] in their take on God. There's only one
[1:16:36] true faith. There's only one true Lord.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; So this emphasis on mo mother and woman
[1:16:44] and son. So it's possible this is what
[1:16:46] they look like when they come out of the
[1:16:48] temple. And we don't know, but this is
[1:16:49] some of the archaeological findings they
[1:16:51] bring up. The first one is a statue.
[1:16:53] This probably was in the temple and the
[1:16:56] artistic depictions of this. So this was
[1:16:58] Baal. This is one of the things. Other
[1:17:01] other ones were just a head with horns
[1:17:03] coming out. But you notice you got horns
[1:17:05] coming out of them. He's holding a tree.
[1:17:07] Trees are always associated with all of
[1:17:09] this. We had the trees in the garden and
[1:17:12] that become the emphasis. The trees
[1:17:14] become the the tree of knowledge, good
[1:17:15] and evil is a person. The tree of life
[1:17:18] was a person, but it was there in a
[1:17:20] garden. Okay. So here he's holding a
[1:17:22] tree. So trees are associated in the
[1:17:24] groves. Trees were around as around the
[1:17:26] groves. And then he's holding something,
[1:17:28] but he's got this, and this is the way
[1:17:30] it explains um number one, the the
[1:17:33] artist depictions um is usually a
[1:17:36] bullheaded figure.
[1:17:40] Okay, you didn't get that one. He's got
[1:17:44] horns coming out, so he's bullheaded.
[1:17:47] Maybe that's why there was such an
[1:17:49] attraction from some people, because
[1:17:52] they're a bit bullheaded. Okay.
[1:17:56] Bale is often shown as a man with the
[1:17:58] head and horns of a bull, a thunderbolt
[1:18:00] wielding deity. He is frequently
[1:18:02] depicting holding a thunderbolt
[1:18:04] symbolizing his power over storms, power
[1:18:08] over fertility, power over destruction,
[1:18:11] and your own power over nature o over
[1:18:14] life. That's the deception I think
[1:18:16] that's in it. There's a God that that
[1:18:19] has power over nature besides the true
[1:18:21] God has power over life, all these other
[1:18:24] things. And then man begins to take that
[1:18:25] because remember he told Eve you shall
[1:18:27] become as gods yourself.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; So the deception is that now these
[1:18:31] things that this God has you can take.
[1:18:33] You have power over nature yourself.
[1:18:36] Look at look at the deception because
[1:18:37] sons and daughters of God under Christ
[1:18:39] in their heart can have power over
[1:18:42] nature to
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; speak to the storm.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; But here's another god saying no you get
[1:18:47] power here over nature over life and uh
[1:18:50] you know abortion comes in there
[1:18:52] different things. So they're worshiping
[1:18:54] a god that can bring us prosperity,
[1:18:56] fertile lands, fertility through a a
[1:18:58] woman. So you see you you have uh so
[1:19:02] here's let let me just look at the other
[1:19:04] two statues here. The one here you have
[1:19:06] this is another one that they found. So
[1:19:08] this is Baal. This might have been what
[1:19:10] come out of the temple as well. He's got
[1:19:11] the horn. He's got something in his hand
[1:19:13] there. That's what it looked like. But
[1:19:14] then there was this other one that was
[1:19:16] actually related to Baal. And she looks
[1:19:18] he it's it looks like more of the
[1:19:20] feminine side because in this god was
[1:19:22] the masculine side, the feminine side as
[1:19:25] well,
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; god of fertility and and mother and
[1:19:29] things. And so that's that's what uh the
[1:19:31] feminine side looks like there. She kind
[1:19:33] of she's got her sunglasses on. She kind
[1:19:36] of looks cool there. I don't know how
[1:19:38] many thousands years of old she is, but
[1:19:40] that was just it it just reminds me of
[1:19:43] some things Brother Bram said about the
[1:19:44] male. There's not much attraction, but
[1:19:46] then Satan makes the woman attractive.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Brother Paul,
[1:19:51] I don't know how you find that
[1:19:52] attractive probably, but nevertheless,
[1:19:55] it's it's a little bit different than
[1:19:56] the male.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; You have one here. It's almost a
[1:20:01] crossover to a female form. When this
[1:20:04] happens, it's the spirit of trans,
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Crossover.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; You can be either. You can choose to be
[1:20:13] either,
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; right? We're going to say these gods are
[1:20:16] still alive today.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; These demons are still alive today.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; When this happens, it's it's a spirit.
[1:20:25] So images and grows. And I can show you
[1:20:28] more images. I can show you the full
[1:20:31] images, but I can't show them because in
[1:20:33] this open audience because they're
[1:20:35] they're not appropriate to show because
[1:20:37] most of the female images is a a statue
[1:20:41] of a woman's naked body. and and and
[1:20:44] that God is called Asher, not just Baal,
[1:20:47] but Asher, the counterpart of Baal. And
[1:20:49] she's usually naked or she's emphasizing
[1:20:52] parts of her body. Now, listen friends,
[1:20:54] this message isn't to point back to, you
[1:20:56] know, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 years ago.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; If that's the God, and Brother Bam says,
[1:21:03] now we have a woman's body becoming the
[1:21:05] goddess of this generation.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; It's what the in the days of Noah, sons
[1:21:09] of God fell by
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; the beauty of women. Those images, you
[1:21:14] don't have to go see us. Those images
[1:21:16] are put in front of us all the time.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; The cross is because this is both the
[1:21:26] power of a woman and the worship of a
[1:21:29] woman and the worship of a powerful man.
[1:21:32] Power that is without God, of course.
[1:21:34] So, I'm getting past some of these
[1:21:35] points. I want you to think about them.
[1:21:37] Groves were trees as well, not just
[1:21:39] statues. grows through trees. That God
[1:21:41] uh that God there is holding a branch of
[1:21:43] a tree. Trees are tied to heathen
[1:21:46] worship. Trees are tied to her heathen
[1:21:48] worship. I'll just leave that with you.
[1:21:50] So this idol worship appealed to man's
[1:21:52] flesh and his fallen nature. Something
[1:21:55] drew him to it. It was more appealing to
[1:21:57] Jehovah worship. Why was it more
[1:21:59] appealing? Why was it more appealing
[1:22:02] than Jehovah worship? because it was
[1:22:03] sensual and it appealed to the flesh of
[1:22:06] man,
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; not his soul.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; How many things do we have today in
[1:22:12] front of us available to us that are to
[1:22:15] satisfy the sensual flesh?
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; And so then you know you if you move
[1:22:26] into that, you're staying home and
[1:22:28] watching your shows and reading your
[1:22:30] books instead of coming to church.
[1:22:35] They weren't ignorant
[1:22:37] to this going on. They were ignorant to
[1:22:39] this going on and how it appealed to
[1:22:40] them because these idols could not
[1:22:43] speak. 1 Corinthians 12 verse one. Now
[1:22:47] concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I
[1:22:49] would not have you ignorant. So just
[1:22:51] Paul says this several times. We as
[1:22:54] believers are not to be ignorant.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; The Gentiles, other Gentiles are
[1:22:58] ignorant. They don't know what all these
[1:23:00] gods mean. They don't know how the devil
[1:23:02] uses them. But we are not to called to
[1:23:05] be ignorant. In one place Paul says we
[1:23:07] are not ignorant of Satan's devices. And
[1:23:10] if you are, you're like other Gentiles.
[1:23:12] You choose to be ignorant. But we're not
[1:23:14] to be an ignorant people. We're to use
[1:23:16] our discernment to say, "Wait a minute.
[1:23:17] This is this is what this is. I
[1:23:19] researched it. I did my homework. This
[1:23:21] is where this comes from." There's some
[1:23:23] sisters that won't even young girls that
[1:23:24] won't even look where something comes
[1:23:25] from. They'll just start wearing
[1:23:26] something. I think you ought to go
[1:23:28] research where it comes from.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. research the source of it.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; That shows you're interested. I don't
[1:23:33] want to just start wearing something
[1:23:34] just because it was in a magazine or
[1:23:36] just because it's popular. Check out
[1:23:38] where it comes from. And those your guys
[1:23:40] clothes as well. Oh boy, this isn't in
[1:23:43] my notes, but you guys ought to research
[1:23:44] where little styles come from sometimes.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; And haircuts come from
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; if you're not going to take the time to
[1:23:52] do it, then you're choosing to be uh
[1:23:56] ignorant.
[1:23:58] And we're not called to be ignorant.
[1:24:00] This is what Paul does deals with the
[1:24:01] spiritual gifts. The idols appealed to
[1:24:04] the flesh instead of the soul. They were
[1:24:06] dumb idols. And that means they didn't
[1:24:08] speak. You know, if they're in front of
[1:24:10] a thing that didn't speak, aren't you
[1:24:12] glad to have a God that speaks today?
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; He's speaking to us right now.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They had no clue as to the
[1:24:21] portals that opened up to the demonic
[1:24:22] realm. So, they were dumb. The the the
[1:24:25] idol was dumb. Couldn't speak. And the
[1:24:27] people following the idol were dumb
[1:24:29] because they were dumb to the portals
[1:24:33] that it opened up to demons because it
[1:24:35] wasn't just this statue in the temple
[1:24:37] sitting there. If they begin to worship
[1:24:39] that, it opened a portal, a channel for
[1:24:42] all the demon power to come into that
[1:24:45] temple.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; And they were dumb of this. They didn't
[1:24:49] have the discernment to know this. It's
[1:24:50] still true today. Everything has a
[1:24:52] spirit with it. Music has a spirit with
[1:24:55] it. The right or wrong spirit. Movies
[1:24:57] have a spirit with it. The right or
[1:24:58] wrong spirit.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Books have a spirit that carry with
[1:25:02] them. The right spirit or the wrong
[1:25:03] spirit. And the quicker we grow up and
[1:25:06] get discernment about ourselves and
[1:25:08] discern not just, oh, I'm enjoying this.
[1:25:10] This is good. It makes me laugh. No, no,
[1:25:12] no, no. What spirit is behind it?
[1:25:14] Because if I feed on it long enough, I'm
[1:25:16] going to take that spirit.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Now, concerning spiritual gifts,
[1:25:22] brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
[1:25:23] You know that ye were Gentiles carried
[1:25:25] away with these dumb idols even as ye
[1:25:28] were led. They were led away by dumb
[1:25:30] idols that couldn't speak. They were
[1:25:32] dumb because they couldn't speak. But
[1:25:33] Paul's really saying you were led away.
[1:25:36] So they were dumb and you were dumb.
[1:25:38] That's the Lefontaine Standard Revised
[1:25:40] Version right there.
[1:25:42] You were led away by it by dumb idols
[1:25:45] and you were dumb to be led away by it.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; And we're not as other Gentiles. We're
[1:25:50] not called to be like all the rest of
[1:25:52] the world. We're not called to feed on
[1:25:53] the things like the rest of the world. I
[1:25:55] don't care what condition you are this
[1:25:57] morning. Repent before the Lord. Repent.
[1:25:59] Claim the blood of Calvary and say,
[1:26:01] "Lord, cleanse my temple and grab a hold
[1:26:03] of that promise. I'm not like the other
[1:26:05] girls. I'm not like the other guys. My
[1:26:08] mind is not meant to be trashed like
[1:26:10] this."
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; We're not like other Gentiles. We're
[1:26:14] called to be sons and daughters of God.
[1:26:16] Say, "I'm only 12 years old." You're
[1:26:17] called to be a son of God. Stand with
[1:26:19] the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:22] They were ignorant. They were led away
[1:26:24] by fleshly love, lot a fleshly appeal.
[1:26:28] God does not want his people ignorant,
[1:26:29] the bride will get advantage. How many
[1:26:32] can say, praise the Lord, the bride will
[1:26:34] get the advantage over Satan in the end
[1:26:37] time.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm speaking promise. This bride,
[1:26:42] he won't get the advantage over her
[1:26:44] because she's not dumb. She's got
[1:26:47] discernment. She won't be deceived. Is
[1:26:49] what the Bible says. Can you say amen?
[1:26:51] The bride will get the advantage over
[1:26:53] Satan in the end time because the book
[1:26:56] has been open to her by revelation. She
[1:26:58] is no longer ignorant of Satan's
[1:27:00] devices. How will she become a brother
[1:27:03] says we'll become powerhouses for the
[1:27:05] kingdom of God. How does she going to
[1:27:06] become a powerhouse for the spirit of
[1:27:08] God? Because she knows what can affect
[1:27:11] her temple. She's all over it. She knows
[1:27:14] she discerns the spirit behind
[1:27:15] something.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; We're not like other Gentiles.
[1:27:20] It's amazing today after all the
[1:27:22] statistics and all the results of
[1:27:23] something or is people choose to still
[1:27:27] dabble in things that affect them.
[1:27:29] Christians do video games. I've preached
[1:27:32] for years uh against video games and
[1:27:35] being obsessed with that.
[1:27:38] And then now all the results are in and
[1:27:41] now all the shootings are in. It's
[1:27:42] interesting that the news they'll
[1:27:44] mention something about this boy who
[1:27:47] killed Charlie Kirk and all the other
[1:27:49] shootings. 95% of them their life is
[1:27:52] spent behind that those video games
[1:27:55] shooting and killing until they become
[1:27:57] numb to shoot somebody themselves. And
[1:27:59] the the news will just mention it, but
[1:28:01] that's all. But I'm telling you, they
[1:28:03] don't understand the portals that you
[1:28:06] open yourself up to with those video.
[1:28:08] And I'm going to continue until I die to
[1:28:10] preach against that stuff.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; It's not whether mom and dad told you
[1:28:17] and wouldn't didn't, you know, mom and
[1:28:19] dad didn't allow me to have it, so now
[1:28:21] I'm going to have it myself.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; How childish.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; You need to look at what's what it's
[1:28:27] influencing your life to do. I've
[1:28:28] watched men not even get up and go to
[1:28:31] work and support their families because
[1:28:32] they're so addicted.
[1:28:36] And I've told some of you, you get rid
[1:28:39] of that in your life. Get rid of that.
[1:28:41] Get rid of that. Things will be
[1:28:42] different in your life. You're not going
[1:28:43] to do it. You're going to hang on to it.
[1:28:44] It's your comfort blanket.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; But it opens up channels of demons.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; But it don't affect me.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Must have been the same thing Israel
[1:28:57] said for 300 years. it don't affect me,
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; but it did back then
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; and it does today.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; So, that was what's on the inside of the
[1:29:08] temple. But then right close around the
[1:29:11] temple, there's these statues as well on
[1:29:13] these areas of trees. And I'm moving
[1:29:14] along as quickly as I can.
[1:29:17] Statues around the temple of God, houses
[1:29:20] of male prostitution, houses of
[1:29:21] sodomites. And I said at the beginning
[1:29:23] of the series, how in the world do you
[1:29:25] have a whole house of Sodom and Gomorra
[1:29:27] and Sodommites planted right next to the
[1:29:30] temple? They were supposed to be in
[1:29:32] Sodom.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; And isn't that like the Sodom spirit?
[1:29:35] It's not good enough to stay amongst
[1:29:36] their own community. They want to change
[1:29:38] the laws. They want your children. They
[1:29:41] want to knock on the door of Lot's
[1:29:42] house.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; That's the spirit behind it. It's not
[1:29:45] good enough to stay in their community.
[1:29:47] They want to come in here,
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; take one of our teenage girls or teenage
[1:29:51] boys and influence them with the spirit
[1:29:53] of sodom sodomites.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; So they were they were begin to build
[1:30:05] houses around Israel didn't catch didn't
[1:30:08] catch it. And so groves, the groves
[1:30:12] where they could they could have certain
[1:30:14] they could have curtains or I want you
[1:30:16] to catch this now. They could have
[1:30:17] curtains or tent-like coverings. When it
[1:30:20] when it says there in the scripture, it
[1:30:22] says something about and the women
[1:30:23] around the houses of sodomites and
[1:30:25] around the groves, they had they had
[1:30:27] coverings. So they had tent-like
[1:30:30] coverings used to create shrines or
[1:30:32] private places for the cultic sexual
[1:30:35] rituals associated with the worship of
[1:30:38] the goddess and male cult prostitutes
[1:30:41] often mentioned in the verse. In
[1:30:43] essence, the women were participating in
[1:30:45] a form of idol idolatrous worship that
[1:30:47] involved weaving items for a false deity
[1:30:50] within the very precincts of the Lord's
[1:30:53] temple. Now, this first picture I want
[1:30:56] to show you is the heathens when they
[1:30:58] were in their own land. This is how they
[1:31:00] had it. They were in the open. There's
[1:31:02] not coverings or things that make it
[1:31:04] private. They were out there. So, this
[1:31:06] would have been in the heathen lands
[1:31:07] wherever that was. This is how they did
[1:31:09] it. So, they had this. It was a cultish
[1:31:11] uh worship. It was related to sexual,
[1:31:15] how should I say it, just male
[1:31:17] prostitution. All the it was very
[1:31:18] sensual and sexual related. This is how
[1:31:20] it would have looked with their gods
[1:31:22] right out front and there. in this this
[1:31:24] whole party, but it's open. When they
[1:31:26] begin to build houses around the temple,
[1:31:29] then the groves came in of covering it.
[1:31:32] And as it just said, I want to read it
[1:31:33] the way he said it. The the the the the
[1:31:36] women had tent-like coverings used to
[1:31:38] create shrines or private places
[1:31:43] to cover up
[1:31:45] what was going to happen in there.
[1:31:48] He didn't do that when it was back in
[1:31:51] the heathen land. But when he got it
[1:31:53] around the temple for the Israelites to
[1:31:55] participate in, he made private places
[1:31:58] for them to do it.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; This is what it would like to look like
[1:32:04] in the temple.
[1:32:07] All not only inside the temple, but
[1:32:09] around the temple. That doesn't that's
[1:32:12] this. I'm just showing you around the
[1:32:13] temple. There would have been houses.
[1:32:15] There would have been groves. There
[1:32:17] would have been all kinds of places
[1:32:18] built completely surrounding the temple
[1:32:21] over 300 years now. This is the temple
[1:32:23] of God. They're not in their heathen
[1:32:24] lands anymore, but they're building
[1:32:26] these houses of sodomites, these groves
[1:32:29] around all these trees and building
[1:32:31] private places for the people of God
[1:32:33] that are called to be the people of God
[1:32:35] to get in their own private place to
[1:32:37] worship that other God.
[1:32:41] Most of the things that has been
[1:32:43] developed by Satan today for us to fall
[1:32:48] has been made strategically
[1:32:52] that you can do it privately
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; in a movie theater. You're with a lot of
[1:33:02] other people but not today. Right.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; So now when they come to doing the
[1:33:08] groves around the temple, this is what
[1:33:10] they would have looked like a little bit
[1:33:11] more something like this where with
[1:33:14] something around it. Could have been
[1:33:15] tapestries, could have been a brush,
[1:33:17] whatever it is. This actually is from
[1:33:19] 400 years ago. This is brother uh Tony a
[1:33:22] a grove in Nigeria, believe it or not. A
[1:33:24] very popular grove there. It's still
[1:33:26] there. And so I'm only taking that
[1:33:28] because they didn't change too much in
[1:33:29] their pattern through the hundreds of
[1:33:31] years of idol worship. When there was a
[1:33:32] grove, it became a a private place like
[1:33:35] this that they go secretly in there. And
[1:33:37] sometimes they were even smaller, just a
[1:33:39] small. So that lets you know what it
[1:33:40] maybe would have looked like around the
[1:33:42] temple, more private. And then the
[1:33:44] houses would have looked like this. I
[1:33:46] got to move along here because my time
[1:33:47] the houses, this is a standard possible
[1:33:50] home of the Israelites around the temple
[1:33:52] of God. So now they would have either
[1:33:54] built the sodomites would have built
[1:33:56] houses like this or they would have uh
[1:33:59] rented the houses like this. Satan,
[1:34:02] he'll take a rental
[1:34:05] if it's close to the temple of the Lord.
[1:34:07] He'll he'll sign a lease
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; for a short time
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; till you kick him out.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; He'll take what he can get.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; This kind of what it looked like. But
[1:34:18] they made them houses of sodomites,
[1:34:20] houses of prostitutes. And friends,
[1:34:21] they're not in Sodom. They're around the
[1:34:23] temple of God.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Close to the temple of God. So then if
[1:34:28] you take all these things together,
[1:34:29] here's the temple of the Lord. All of
[1:34:31] these things were not out somewhere.
[1:34:33] They were either in or around the holy
[1:34:37] place of God.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Meant to be where the glory of God would
[1:34:40] come down. Is anybody getting this this
[1:34:43] morning?
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; Is anybody tying it together? We can
[1:34:46] talk all day. Let's And this is what
[1:34:48] needs to happen. This is what needs to
[1:34:49] happen next. We need to go forth and
[1:34:52] purge our lives so that
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; then we got a temple that's clean and
[1:34:56] dedicated only to the Lord.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:02] I can't do that for you. I can only
[1:35:03] preach it to you. You can only do it for
[1:35:05] yourself.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; We can talk all day about back then, but
[1:35:09] how relevant is the things I'm saying to
[1:35:10] today?
[1:35:14] I listened to yesterday to Christianity
[1:35:16] versus idolatry.
[1:35:19] There's only two things, Christianity,
[1:35:22] true Christianity and idolatry. And it
[1:35:25] was amazing to watch the prophet and he
[1:35:27] just says we think idolatry is in Africa
[1:35:30] over he says our country is full of
[1:35:32] idolatry full of it
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; because we have access see it's about
[1:35:38] the images that's placed in front of us.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; A statue is an image but today images
[1:35:44] can be flashed in front of us
[1:35:46] constantly.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; So we still have the wrong things
[1:35:50] flashing in front of us and that's still
[1:35:52] idolatry. So, you know, and so many
[1:35:54] things he said in that, I encourage you
[1:35:56] to listen to it, uh, because it's
[1:35:59] there's
[1:36:00] it's incredible how he's taken not only
[1:36:02] the world's the African idolatry, and
[1:36:05] he's seen all that, but he's taken
[1:36:07] denominations, the systems, not the
[1:36:09] people, the systems have become an idol
[1:36:11] because he what are you? I'm a Baptist.
[1:36:13] I'm a Presbyterian.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; It becomes an idol to them instead of
[1:36:17] true Christianity.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:20] Then he then he brings in the
[1:36:22] Pentecostals.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm listen I'm going he's rebuking
[1:36:28] and he's saying that Pentecost has gone
[1:36:30] into a bit of idolatry like this. He
[1:36:32] said when you it's my church so I can
[1:36:34] say this.
[1:36:36] He said he said the idolatries he says
[1:36:40] just kind of lose yourself and get you
[1:36:42] go into a trance or something when
[1:36:43] they're worshiping these gods. And then
[1:36:44] he brings up the Pentecostals and he
[1:36:46] said, you know, that's what they're
[1:36:48] encouraging them to do. Just start
[1:36:50] speaking in tongues or start doing
[1:36:51] something. Just kind of lose yourself.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; He's attaching it to it. These
[1:36:58] Pentecostal traditions, it's crossing
[1:37:00] over an idolatry and yet it seems like
[1:37:02] the real thing.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; He's the one who's saying it. He's
[1:37:07] seeing that. He's sitting down. He's
[1:37:08] study. He said, "I've taken two weeks to
[1:37:10] study idolatry." And he studied it. He
[1:37:12] brings this message Christianity versus
[1:37:14] idolatry. He brings denominations. He
[1:37:16] brings in the Pentecostals using some of
[1:37:18] the same things. Just lose yourself and
[1:37:21] things like that. And then he says he
[1:37:23] tried to rebuke a lady who ended up
[1:37:25] speaking in tongues while he was
[1:37:26] preaching and told her to sit down.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not done preaching. Sit down. And
[1:37:30] she kept want interrupting. He said sit
[1:37:32] down till I'm done.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; They came up to him afterwards and says
[1:37:35] you grieve the spirit of God when you
[1:37:36] did that.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; He said any spirit that would interrupt
[1:37:40] the word being preached should have been
[1:37:41] grieved.
[1:37:44] And this guy said, he said, "But she had
[1:37:47] something fresh from the Lord."
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; And brother Bren says, "Wow, ain't that
[1:37:55] back to that old idolatry again?
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; I have something fresh is other than
[1:38:00] that Bible.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; You're talking idolatry."
[1:38:04] And when we have an emphasis of people
[1:38:06] coming forward always wanting a fresh
[1:38:09] word from the Lord,
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; I would be careful of that.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Because a man be may be led to say
[1:38:15] something to you, but when you're
[1:38:16] depending and you're not tied to that
[1:38:18] Bible and you're wanting something fresh
[1:38:20] from the Lord and that's the craving,
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; something wrong with that picture.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; You get back over here.
[1:38:31] I want to ask this question though.
[1:38:34] How close has the images
[1:38:39] come to our temple in 2025?
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Now I'm not talking about books so much
[1:38:45] even though they can be have the wrong
[1:38:48] spirit. I'm talking about images because
[1:38:49] that's what the idols were. It was an
[1:38:51] image in front of you. How close have
[1:38:53] images come to our temple? How many
[1:38:55] images are put in front of us out there
[1:38:57] every day?
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; A lot.
[1:39:00] But they are closer than they've ever
[1:39:02] been. Hollywood invaded our shores.
[1:39:04] According to brother Brandham, we had an
[1:39:06] invasion of the United States. They
[1:39:07] invaded the West Coast. And how was our
[1:39:09] shores invaded? Not by an army from
[1:39:11] another country, by Hollywood.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Our country was invaded by the Army of
[1:39:17] Hollywood.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; So maybe we lived in Pittsburgh or maybe
[1:39:23] we lived in Detroit or maybe we lived
[1:39:25] all over the country. But but Hollywood
[1:39:29] brought began to develop its images and
[1:39:33] so it was getting closer to us.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; Hollywood invaded our shore 1910.
[1:39:41] Not long after that, not very long after
[1:39:44] they had bioscopes in theaters.
[1:39:46] Louisiana was the first one. So when
[1:39:48] they come into theaters now, Hollywood,
[1:39:50] what it's producing can be closer. It
[1:39:53] moves closer to the individual.
[1:39:56] That's right.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; That's the early 1900s. The first TV in
[1:39:59] a home was 1928.
[1:40:02] Just want to say he moved it closer.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; First computer in a home. PC personal
[1:40:12] computer.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; This is my computer. This is personal.
[1:40:16] Even these names.
[1:40:23] Do I have that symbol of apple on the
[1:40:25] back of my Yeah, there it is. It's an
[1:40:29] apple with a bite out of it.
[1:40:32] Most preachers have it, so I'm not bad
[1:40:33] this morning.
[1:40:40] How close is it? First computer in the
[1:40:42] home PC 1975 came closer. First time the
[1:40:46] worldwide web was available was 1991.
[1:40:49] And with the worldwide web, everything
[1:40:51] comes closer. It's called the
[1:40:52] information highway. That means we have
[1:40:54] access to all information around the
[1:40:57] world and it's come into our personal
[1:40:59] computer.
[1:41:00] Access to everything eventually access
[1:41:04] to everything including the most vile
[1:41:08] things.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; In our eyes, images before eyes.
[1:41:16] The first cell phone with a screen
[1:41:19] was 1994.
[1:41:22] Did it come closer with the cell phone?
[1:41:24] Come closer to us.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; The images came closer.
[1:41:30] Then quickly in 1996,
[1:41:34] the cell phone got the cell phone got
[1:41:36] full access to the worldwide web came
[1:41:39] closer to us.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Next year 1997, the first social media
[1:41:44] platform came into play, which means it
[1:41:48] came everything came closer to us. Who's
[1:41:51] leading this?
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Who's leading this?
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; But technology,
[1:41:57] it's more than technology.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; It's moving it closer
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; to the believer's temple.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; I wonder if Satan said, "Huh,
[1:42:11] so the Bible says, you know, he reads
[1:42:13] the Bible, too.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Huh? The Bible says that these guys are
[1:42:18] the temples of God." Huh? The last
[1:42:22] prophecy in the Bible in Revelations 21,
[1:42:27] I think it is, Satan says, I think it
[1:42:29] is,
[1:42:31] is that the new Jerusalem comes down
[1:42:34] like a bride adorned for her husband.
[1:42:37] Behold, the tabernacle of God is with
[1:42:41] men. The final prophecy is God has
[1:42:46] tabernacled himself where in a people.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; She's the new spiritual Jerusalem.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; And Satan reads it and he's saying,
[1:42:56] "Okay." And he's saying, "I've got to
[1:43:01] bring
[1:43:03] the demons so close to them.
[1:43:12] guys. Talking to all his guys, his
[1:43:14] demons. I want you to put every image
[1:43:16] that we've got available
[1:43:19] as close to their temple as you can put
[1:43:22] it.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; So, he begins this prophecy. If that's
[1:43:26] the prophecy, we got the power. We're
[1:43:28] going to fight against that prophecy. If
[1:43:30] they're the temples, then it doesn't
[1:43:32] matter if it's in Hollywood. You've got
[1:43:33] to bring Hollywood close to their
[1:43:35] temples.
[1:43:37] If they've got a mind like they've got,
[1:43:39] like the rest of the Gentiles, we've got
[1:43:41] to bring those images so they see those
[1:43:43] images more often.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; So guys, I want you to work on it. I
[1:43:47] want you to bring these images. I want
[1:43:49] you to take everything in all the
[1:43:51] coffers. Bring it out. And I want you to
[1:43:53] throw these images just as close and in
[1:43:56] front of their faces and their eyes as
[1:43:58] you can do them. I believe there's not a
[1:44:00] way any human being can escape if you
[1:44:04] place that right in their hand. and
[1:44:06] place that right in front of them. I
[1:44:07] don't think he any human being can
[1:44:10] escape that.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Well, he's greatly mistaken.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Put everything in front of their eyes.
[1:44:18] Make it so they never have to go get
[1:44:20] something bad. Make it private. They can
[1:44:23] look privately in that way. Make it so
[1:44:25] it's user friendly to defile and mess
[1:44:28] with their mind, to depress them, to put
[1:44:31] condemnation on them. Do everything you
[1:44:33] can. We have ruined. We've already guys,
[1:44:36] we've already ruined their attention
[1:44:37] spans.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; The whole culture has ADD.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; It's a new name that Satan come up with
[1:44:45] and threw at them. You guys are ADD. You
[1:44:47] have attention deficit disorder. That's
[1:44:49] why some of you can't sit an hour, hour
[1:44:51] and a half while I preach.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; But you can watch a three-hour movie.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Preacher is being rough today. I'm going
[1:45:00] to tell it like it is. There's an
[1:45:01] imbalance in our lives. If we can't sit
[1:45:04] and hear the word of God, there's an
[1:45:05] imbalance in our lives.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; We don't care enough for our temple.
[1:45:09] What goes in these minds?
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; I'd rather sit for hours and hear the
[1:45:13] word of God and get those seeds in my
[1:45:15] mind and my heart than anything else in
[1:45:17] this life. Cuz I know that's the only
[1:45:19] thing that's going to get me in a
[1:45:21] rapture someday.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Only thing that gets me out of here.
[1:45:24] Your movies won't get you out of here.
[1:45:26] Your books, your romance novels won't
[1:45:28] get you out of here. That's right.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; This word by revelation is going to get
[1:45:33] us out of here. Somebody ought to say,
[1:45:35] "Praise the Lord."
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Make it so user friendly to defy and
[1:45:41] mess with. They have ADD. They can't
[1:45:43] even focus for an hour sermon. So make
[1:45:46] Now make clips because they have ADD.
[1:45:49] Make clips 10 seconds, no longer than 10
[1:45:52] seconds, and flash those images and
[1:45:55] idols as quick as you can because we
[1:45:58] know demons that their mind still
[1:46:01] catches it even if it flashes for a
[1:46:04] second.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; See, Satan knows that in his demons,
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; but a lot of Christians don't know that.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; How close?
[1:46:14] How close he makes
[1:46:19] How how close how close did he bring it?
[1:46:25] It's right here in my pocket. You might
[1:46:28] put it in your back pocket. If I do
[1:46:30] that, I can't find it. But I have it in
[1:46:32] this pocket. Sorry, deacons. We're
[1:46:34] having my phone in church.
[1:46:36] But I want to illustrate
[1:46:39] this how close he brought everything.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; I'm holding I'm holding. Don't think at
[1:46:44] the end of the service I'm going to tell
[1:46:45] you to throw these away. Even though I'd
[1:46:48] like to,
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; but but it's amazing how it's been all
[1:46:54] planned out that we can't really throw
[1:46:56] them away.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; We could distance oursel from them a
[1:46:59] little bit more
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; because we are addicted to them.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; But look how close. Now it's not a PC.
[1:47:07] Now it's not this. I appreciate this. Uh
[1:47:11] what is this? An iPad. Saves a lot of
[1:47:14] paper. I'm doing my part, you know.
[1:47:18] global warming, whatever. I'm doing my
[1:47:20] part.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; But it comes from all this and it's this
[1:47:24] close to us.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; And it's in our hand and it's, you know,
[1:47:29] most of the time in restaurants and
[1:47:30] everywhere, this is where you see
[1:47:32] there's no communication.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; And it's and and he's got it right.
[1:47:38] Every image, every image that you could
[1:47:40] find in this world is right here,
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; put right in front of us.
[1:47:47] That's serious.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; It's serious when our temples are to be
[1:47:52] temples of the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; So then it then in my phone it makes an
[1:47:59] app for everything.
[1:48:01] And you know there's an app for
[1:48:03] everything. That's what they say. So we
[1:48:05] got access to all these things. I've got
[1:48:08] you know I've got my Bible app which I
[1:48:09] love. I've got the table app. If you
[1:48:11] don't have that one you should get it. I
[1:48:13] love it. I can listen to something. I've
[1:48:16] got the new Fountain House app. Anybody
[1:48:18] know about that? Every song that's ever
[1:48:20] been recorded here. Over 500 songs. The
[1:48:23] Fountainhouse app. I'm doing a
[1:48:25] commercial right now.
[1:48:27] I can hit that app and have music all
[1:48:31] the time going in my life. I love it.
[1:48:33] You should get it.
[1:48:37] You know, I got some of these other
[1:48:38] things that I probably don't even need.
[1:48:42] You know, they have all the apps. Some
[1:48:44] of it is good,
[1:48:49] but
[1:48:51] a lot of it, if not most of it, needs to
[1:48:54] be through the filter of the word of
[1:48:56] God.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; The new apps coming out or you can have
[1:49:03] a friend on here. If you don't have a
[1:49:04] friend, you can have a friend.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; That's the newest thing coming out. the
[1:49:09] newest there's a new one that's coming
[1:49:11] out or it's out and uh I forget what
[1:49:14] it's called but it helps you to focus to
[1:49:16] get stuff done during the day. Boy, I I
[1:49:18] might need that but it it's actually a
[1:49:20] friend who reminds you and helps you
[1:49:22] focus
[1:49:25] and I you know so a lot of this stuff is
[1:49:27] good. I like you know I like to speak
[1:49:30] into it instead of having to type on a
[1:49:32] really small screen. I'm telling the
[1:49:34] stuff I like.
[1:49:38] And so I I talk to people and sometimes
[1:49:41] those texts don't come out right. I've
[1:49:43] had to apologize.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; And the other day I was on the phone
[1:49:48] with a telemarketer and I said a bunch.
[1:49:50] I said, "Are you going to send that
[1:49:52] form?" Period.
[1:49:58] I said, "Period.
[1:50:03] How many days is that gonna come
[1:50:06] to my house?" You know,
[1:50:09] if I if I'm talking here and I say
[1:50:12] period,
[1:50:13] somebody please I want the deacons to
[1:50:15] take my phone away from me because it's
[1:50:16] getting out of hand. It's
[1:50:21] so many options, you know, so many
[1:50:22] things and some of it's good, but then
[1:50:24] you just, as I said last Sunday, you
[1:50:26] just you just click in something really
[1:50:29] quickly that's defiled. How close has it
[1:50:33] come to us? I just tell you about this
[1:50:35] new
[1:50:36] uh app that my wife made me get on and
[1:50:40] it's called steps app and she's
[1:50:41] monitoring all the steps I take every
[1:50:43] day.
[1:50:45] I didn't like it. I didn't want it. It's
[1:50:48] accountability. She already calls me
[1:50:50] every day. Says, "What are you having
[1:50:52] for lunch? How many carbs are you
[1:50:54] having?
[1:50:56] Tell me the number of carbs. You're
[1:50:58] gonna die."
[1:51:01] I'm already dealing with that. And now
[1:51:03] she wants she can see my steps. You know
[1:51:07] how many steps you get in today. How I
[1:51:09] can just imagine I'm going to be
[1:51:10] sleeping ready to go to sleep at
[1:51:12] midnight and I'm 500 steps short. You're
[1:51:15] 500 short. You got to get out there and
[1:51:17] I'm going to get out in the driveway in
[1:51:18] my pajamas and finish my steps.
[1:51:24] One day she said, "How come you only
[1:51:26] have 200 steps today?" I said, 'Well,
[1:51:29] that's how many steps it was to across
[1:51:31] the McDonald's parking lot to get to
[1:51:32] McDonald's and get back.
[1:51:36] It's accountability.
[1:51:42] I'm just saying that here we are. How
[1:51:46] close can all of that out there? Say
[1:51:48] it's out there and it's not out there.
[1:51:50] It's right here.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. And it's the same thing
[1:51:53] that happened thousands of years ago
[1:51:55] with the children of Israel. But now
[1:51:57] it's every image that's an idolatrous
[1:52:00] image
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; can be quickly placed in front of us.
[1:52:03] And whatever's in your heart that you're
[1:52:05] craving,
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; the devil has something out there to
[1:52:08] feed that craving.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; What it is to be successful to to you
[1:52:13] know remember the god of fertility, the
[1:52:15] god of prosperity. They got all the
[1:52:17] things to fulfill that desire. Looking
[1:52:19] for this, looking for that, looking to
[1:52:21] make more money. It's all there, but
[1:52:22] it's feeding something within us. I just
[1:52:24] think that we should go to the Lord. Can
[1:52:26] you say amen
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; to him to meet our satisfaction? I
[1:52:30] believe that we need to have so filled
[1:52:32] with the Holy Ghost that they took and
[1:52:35] purged purged. I don't know how we do
[1:52:37] that, but I believe the Lord will show
[1:52:39] you in your life that your temple is so
[1:52:43] important to the Lord.
[1:52:47] I know the devil is saying, "I've got it
[1:52:49] real close to them and they're never
[1:52:50] going to catch it." But I got news for
[1:52:52] the devil. I'm preaching it this morning
[1:52:55] and there's a bride that's going to
[1:52:56] catch it.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; They're not dumb. They're going to catch
[1:53:00] it.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Satan, I'm all over you. I know how
[1:53:02] close you brought it, but I've caught
[1:53:04] what's going on. It'd be great if some
[1:53:06] young people catch it.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; You catch what I'm preaching this
[1:53:09] morning.
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; This is not just an instrument. This is
[1:53:12] a device of the enemy. We have to use it
[1:53:15] for the right things,
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; but we also have to purge our temple of
[1:53:21] the wrong things and say, "I value this
[1:53:25] temple. This house,
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; my mind, and my spirit is not a garbage
[1:53:30] can."
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; This belongs to the Lord.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:41] I was thinking of I was thinking of
[1:53:43] these things and I'll close on this. I
[1:53:45] was thinking of a fellow I had to look
[1:53:47] up his name, but I remembered on 911
[1:53:50] there was two planes. One went into the
[1:53:52] Twin Towers, one went into uh the
[1:53:55] Pentagon, but there was three planes
[1:53:57] that crashed.
[1:53:59] And I heard this little story of the
[1:54:00] wife who wrote a a book about her
[1:54:02] husband. It was called Let's Roll. And I
[1:54:05] got to thinking about those people on
[1:54:08] that third plane.
[1:54:11] And I so I researched it to see were
[1:54:13] they sitting there going on the plane
[1:54:15] and they got news that two planes were
[1:54:18] taken over by the enemy and they went
[1:54:21] into the actual cockpit and begin to
[1:54:23] redirect it into these places and killed
[1:54:26] thousands of people. Did they know that
[1:54:28] that was going on? And I found out uh
[1:54:31] this Todd fella and many others. Now you
[1:54:33] can you imagine now you're sitting on a
[1:54:36] plane and you're receiving phone calls
[1:54:39] and he was talking to a an air airport
[1:54:42] operator and he informed him right there
[1:54:44] and he says listen there's two planes
[1:54:46] being taken over by the enemy. They've
[1:54:48] already already crashed crashed one into
[1:54:51] the Pentagon and one into the Twin
[1:54:52] Towers. Can you imagine sitting there
[1:54:54] and you're on a plane? Can you imagine
[1:54:57] listening saying you got to be kidding?
[1:55:00] But that realization wasn't as serious
[1:55:04] as when they begin to realize their
[1:55:07] plane has been taken over
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; by the enemy.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; It's tragic when somebody else's plane
[1:55:15] gets taken over and somebody goes into
[1:55:17] the cockpit and you watch them fall and
[1:55:19] crash. It's terrible. But when you're
[1:55:21] just I want you to put yourself in their
[1:55:24] shoes
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; sitting there. It's tragic. But you have
[1:55:28] to learn what the enemy has done in
[1:55:30] other people's lives. But you realize
[1:55:32] now the same enemy is on your plane.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; May that may that jolt us like it did
[1:55:43] me. The same enemy is on your plane and
[1:55:46] he gets off and they get a plan
[1:55:48] together. Nobody knows what exactly
[1:55:50] happened, but they do know that that
[1:55:51] plane was headed, I believe, towards the
[1:55:54] White House or somewhere in Washington
[1:55:55] DC. and they rose up and he said, "Let's
[1:55:58] row. Let's take over." And they ran. And
[1:56:01] somehow they were able to fight to
[1:56:04] redirect that and save thousands of
[1:56:06] other people's lives, knowing that they
[1:56:08] would probably die. They probably tried
[1:56:10] to take over that. I'm preaching to you.
[1:56:12] It's time for you to take over the
[1:56:14] cockpit of your temple from the enemy.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; If he's sitting in there, it's time to
[1:56:20] purge your airplane.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "Are you guys ready?" He said,
[1:56:26] "Let's row." And that's the last words.
[1:56:28] And and they took off, tried to to storm
[1:56:30] and we don't know what they did. All we
[1:56:33] know is somehow they were able to that
[1:56:34] thing crashed in Pennsylvania and saved
[1:56:36] many lives. And we're thankful for that.
[1:56:39] This a tragic story, but they because
[1:56:41] they had to die. But I want us to get
[1:56:43] the same Holy Ghost fervor in our lives.
[1:56:45] That's not even Holy Ghost. That's just
[1:56:47] a heart rising to say, I want to save
[1:56:49] lives. I want to I want to get this
[1:56:50] enemy out of the cockpit.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; My life will be destroyed here. I got to
[1:56:54] do something about this. Young person,
[1:56:56] you got to do something about what I'm
[1:56:58] preaching today.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; You can't let the enemy sit in the
[1:57:01] cockpit of your airplane.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's going to be a crash no matter
[1:57:05] what.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; You got to go fight. I don't know how
[1:57:08] far he got. Maybe he got in that door
[1:57:10] and he was wrestling and fighting with
[1:57:11] those men, trying his best to get them
[1:57:14] out of there. And maybe while he was
[1:57:15] fighting, trying to save it, that's when
[1:57:17] it nose dived into. I don't know what
[1:57:19] happened. We don't know the story, but
[1:57:21] thank God for that testimony of somebody
[1:57:23] says, "Let's roll." I'm I'm going to say
[1:57:24] it to you this morning. Let's roll.
[1:57:27] Let's roll. Can you say amen? Let's
[1:57:29] roll. Let's do something about it.
[1:57:33] Hallelujah.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Because this
[1:57:37] is not just important. This is the
[1:57:39] highest value. This temple, this mind,
[1:57:43] these thoughts,
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; my spirit, my emotions, everything
[1:57:47] that's part of this is has a high value
[1:57:51] to the Lord.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; And it should have a high value to us
[1:57:56] personally.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want a personal revival.
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; I want the glory of God to come down in
[1:58:02] this temple.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Nobody else is wanting it. That's fine.
[1:58:05] But I want this in my life. What do I
[1:58:08] need to do to go home and make it and
[1:58:11] send a message to the Lord that this is
[1:58:14] important?
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; This vessel
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, it
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; is important to you.
[1:58:20] This is your house.
[1:58:24] Father, come and dwell.
[1:58:27] Can we stand? This is your house,
[1:58:33] a holy house of prayer
[1:58:37] where the lost and the lonely
[1:58:42] bring their burdens and their cares.
[1:58:46] This is your house.
[1:58:51] This is your house.
[1:58:55] Come and dwell.
[1:59:01] First verse. Let's sing it together. We
[1:59:03] dedicate this temple, Lord. You Lord.
[1:59:10] Make it your prayer this morning. Let
[1:59:13] your glory fill this sanctuary.
[1:59:20] Oh, be enthroned on Praise
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; your people,
[1:59:31] Lord. We agree
[1:59:35] in unity.
[1:59:39] This is your house.
[1:59:44] Father, come and dwell.
[1:59:48] Oh, this is your house.
[1:59:54] A holy house of prayer.
[1:59:58] Oh, where the lost and the lonely
[2:00:03] bring their burdens and their care. This
[2:00:07] is your house.
[2:00:12] This is your
[2:00:16] come and dwell.
[2:00:20] Oh my
[2:00:22] Holy Spirit. Oh hallelujah.
[2:00:27] Yes Lord. Yes Lord.
[2:00:31] Decorate
[2:00:33] our heart with grace and mercy.
[2:00:40] Let healing a hallelujah.
[2:00:44] Find searching souls.
[2:00:49] Lord, have your way.
[2:00:53] We humbly pray.
[2:00:57] Oh, this is your house.
[2:01:02] Father, come and dwell.
[2:01:06] This is your house, Lord.
[2:01:12] A holy house
[2:01:16] where the lost and alone
[2:01:33] come.
[2:01:35] I want you to bow your heads with me.
[2:01:38] I want you to think about if you're a
[2:01:40] vessel
[2:01:42] person saying that brother Paul I I
[2:01:45] didn't know this when I was a young
[2:01:47] person. I have really
[2:01:50] I I didn't give my vessel to the Lord
[2:01:52] when I was a kid. Didn't fully yielded
[2:01:54] and I have made damage to this
[2:01:58] my mind my spirit my body. I don't know
[2:02:01] what happened.
[2:02:05] Maybe you're saying I wish I heard this
[2:02:06] preaching to warm me when I was young.
[2:02:08] Maybe you heard it. You didn't value
[2:02:10] that you were a daughter of God or
[2:02:12] you're a son of God and that your your
[2:02:14] vessel was important to him. You know
[2:02:17] what? God's forgiveness is here for you
[2:02:20] today.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; God's blood is here to wash it away. And
[2:02:24] if you got anything out of this today,
[2:02:26] you ought to know
[2:02:28] that God is able to restore a temple
[2:02:31] that's been destroyed.
[2:02:33] How many say amen?
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is able to restore and
[2:02:38] reconcile no matter how much damage.
[2:02:42] Maybe you're a vessel that you've got
[2:02:44] full of hurt and full of pain. You've
[2:02:45] been damaged in your spirit. The things
[2:02:48] people have said about you.
[2:02:51] Maybe you've done your own private
[2:02:52] damage and your own guilty pleasure, so
[2:02:56] to speak. Pleasure is fine, but it's
[2:02:59] it's the guilty pleasures of the world
[2:03:01] that brings guilt and condemnation. And
[2:03:03] maybe you're you think you're hiding
[2:03:05] that, but you know it's done damage to
[2:03:07] your walk with the Lord.
[2:03:10] And maybe you're a temple here today
[2:03:12] that has just been
[2:03:14] you had a good upbringing,
[2:03:17] but the devil's certainly been close to
[2:03:20] your mind and it it's really tore you
[2:03:23] down and whispered things to you that's
[2:03:25] not the truth. Maybe your temple is
[2:03:27] filled with the past sins and mistakes
[2:03:30] and you just can't get over it.
[2:03:34] I ask you to bring your prayer and your
[2:03:36] life before the Lord today
[2:03:40] because he's able to restore and cleanse
[2:03:43] your temple if you desire it with all of
[2:03:46] your heart.
[2:03:48] And would you just raise your hand and
[2:03:50] say,
[2:03:52] "Heavenly Father, cleanse
[2:03:55] this temple.
[2:03:57] Purge it. Clean it, Lord, with your Holy
[2:04:00] Ghost. Sanctify it, Lord.
[2:04:04] Let me have a new start today. Let me
[2:04:06] have a the joy of the Lord.
[2:04:10] May it not be a temporal joy, but may be
[2:04:12] longlasting from this day forward.
[2:04:15] I give my life.
[2:04:18] He'll work out all the details of what
[2:04:20] the problems are. I am going to give my
[2:04:23] life. You young person, would you raise
[2:04:24] your hand? Say, "This day, I give my
[2:04:26] vessel, my mind, my heart, my spirit, my
[2:04:29] soul. I give it to the Lord. I give it.
[2:04:32] I yield it. It's his. He owns it now.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; He has full ownership of I'm not allowed
[2:04:38] to lease it or rent it out or go on
[2:04:41] vacation. It's always It belongs to him.
[2:04:46] God bless you, Lord. Bless those hearts.
[2:04:49] Bless those lives. Every temple in here
[2:04:53] is important to you because it has the
[2:04:56] potential
[2:04:58] of the glory of God filling it. Lord,
[2:05:01] forgive us.
[2:05:03] All of us, Lord, could say we're sorry
[2:05:06] and we repent after a service like this
[2:05:09] today. All of us could use more of a
[2:05:11] value for what our temples are. Yeah,
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; all of us, Lord, could have greater
[2:05:16] strength to not quickly put all these
[2:05:19] images in front of our eyes. Fill us,
[2:05:22] Lord. Teach us, Lord. Guide us, Lord.
[2:05:25] And as we navigate through this Satan's
[2:05:28] Eden, oh God, give your people the
[2:05:31] strength of the Holy Spirit within their
[2:05:33] lives, Lord, that they could walk every
[2:05:35] day, Lord, dedicating this house to you,
[2:05:38] dedicating their life to you. It's the
[2:05:41] Lord's. Even when a negative thought
[2:05:43] comes, we quickly pass it out of our
[2:05:45] minds.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Help us, Jesus. I pray. We give our
[2:05:49] lives holy to you now.
[2:05:52] We are your house, Lord. In Jesus' name,
[2:05:56] everybody said, "Amen."
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; I hope this isn't just a prayer here,
[2:05:59] but it's a life that you take hope with
[2:06:02] you today. If you want special prayer
[2:06:05] with the ministers or something today,
[2:06:08] please come. This altar is open.
[2:06:10] altar in your heart should be open, but
[2:06:12] this altar is open today. Yield to the
[2:06:15] Lord and he'll take over your life.
[2:06:18] Hallelujah. We are your house.
[2:06:24] So, Father, come and dwell.
[2:06:31] We are your house.
[2:06:34] Holy house of prayer where the lost
[2:06:41] Bring their burdens and their cares. We
[2:06:46] are your house.
[2:06:49] Oh, we are your house.
[2:06:54] Come and dwell.

[2:07:20] people.

[2:12:59] life.
[2:13:01] Lord
[2:13:03] be glorified
[2:13:07] today.
[2:13:11] It was a tiny simple stable
[2:13:16] all beaten and warm.
[2:13:21] Hardly
[2:13:23] a place
[2:13:25] for a king to be born.
[2:13:29] He didn't choose some place special
[2:13:34] to reveal his majesty.
[2:13:38] So I know if I'll give him control,
[2:13:43] he'll be born in me.
[2:13:48] Let your word
[2:13:52] be born
[2:13:54] in the manger of my heart.
[2:13:59] Let it live in me.
[2:14:02] Let it start
[2:14:06] and live inside this house of clay
[2:14:11] and mold it every day.
[2:14:16] Let your word be born
[2:14:20] in the manger
[2:14:22] of my heart.
[2:14:27] Well,
[2:14:29] outwardly I'm nothing,
[2:14:33] not much to behold.
[2:14:37] Unlikely
[2:14:39] a place
[2:14:41] for his word to unfold.
[2:14:46] But if I just yield this vessel,
[2:14:51] let him have his way
[2:14:54] from glory unto glory.
[2:14:59] You'll change me day by day.
[2:15:04] Let let your word be born.
[2:15:09] Hallelujah.
[2:15:15] Let it live in me. Let it start.
[2:15:21] Oh, live inside this house of clay
[2:15:27] and mold it every day.
[2:15:32] Let your word be born
[2:15:35] in the manger
[2:15:38] of my heart.
[2:15:42] Sing that again. Outwardly. Oh,
[2:15:45] outwardly. I'm nothing.
[2:15:49] Not much to behold.
[2:15:53] Unlikely
[2:15:55] the place
[2:15:57] for his word to unfold.
[2:16:01] But right now, if I just yield this
[2:16:04] vessel
[2:16:06] and let him have his way
[2:16:10] from glory unto glory, he'll change me
[2:16:16] day by day.
[2:16:19] So let your word
[2:16:23] be born
[2:16:25] in the manger of my heart.
[2:16:29] Oh, let it live in me.
[2:16:34] Let it start
[2:16:37] to live inside this house of clay
[2:16:43] and mold it every day.
[2:16:48] Let your word be born
[2:16:51] in the manger
[2:16:54] of my heart.
[2:17:01] vessel of honor
[2:17:04] I am today.
[2:17:09] And it's all because Jesus
[2:17:15] didn't throw
[2:17:17] the clay away. Over and over,
[2:17:21] over
[2:17:24] and over,
[2:17:26] he molds me and makes me
[2:17:32] into hallelu.
[2:17:37] He fashions
[2:17:39] the claim
[2:17:42] of the soul
[2:17:45] of honor.
[2:17:48] I am today.
[2:17:52] &gt;&gt; It's all because Jesus
[2:17:57] been thrown the clay away.
[2:18:01] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, we thank you for the
[2:18:03] lives
[2:18:05] responding and asking Lord for you to
[2:18:08] come and respond to their surrender.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; May there be a change by the Holy
[2:18:12] Spirit. I pray in all of our lives Lord.
[2:18:16] And we just thank you. May you guide us
[2:18:18] as you did Josiah in the Bible, Lord, to
[2:18:21] make the changes, Lord, in our temple
[2:18:24] that you're leading us to make. And we
[2:18:26] ask it in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[2:18:29] you. You're dismissed in Jesus name.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Over and over.
[2:18:39] He molds me and makes me
[2:18:44] into
[2:18:46] his likeness.
[2:18:49] He fashions
[2:18:51] the play
[2:18:53] of vessel
[2:18:56] of honor
[2:18:59] I am today.
[2:19:03] And it's all because Jesus
[2:19:08] didn't throw the clay away. Verse
[2:19:13] empty
[2:19:15] and broken.
[2:19:17] I came back to him.
[2:19:22] A vessel
[2:19:25] unworthy,
[2:19:27] so scarred by sin.
[2:19:31] But he did not
[2:19:34] despair.
[2:19:36] He started over
[2:19:39] again.
[2:19:41] And I bless the day. He didn't throw the
[2:19:48] clay away.
[2:19:51] Over
[2:19:53] and over.
[2:19:55] He holds me and makes me
[2:20:00] into
[2:20:02] his likeness.
[2:20:04] He fashions
[2:20:06] the clay
[2:20:08] of the soul
[2:20:11] of honor
[2:20:14] I am today.
[2:20:18] And it's all because Jesus
[2:20:22] didn't throw the clay away.
[2:20:27] And he is the potter.
[2:20:32] I am the clay.
[2:20:37] Molded
[2:20:38] in his image.
[2:20:41] He wants me to stay. Oh, but when I
[2:20:46] stumble
[2:20:48] and fall
[2:20:50] and my vessel breaks, he just picks up
[2:20:57] all the pieces. He doesn't throw the
[2:21:01] clay away
[2:21:04] over
[2:21:06] and over.
[2:21:08] He molds me and makes me
[2:21:14] into
[2:21:15] his likeness.
[2:21:17] He fashions
[2:21:20] the clay
[2:21:21] of a soul
[2:21:24] of honor
[2:21:27] I am today.
[2:21:31] It's all because Jesus
[2:21:35] didn't throw the clay away.
[2:21:41] He's higher than the highest,
[2:21:46] greater than the great.
[2:21:50] No one could ever take his crown away.

[2:23:09] Oh,
[2:23:10] ladies
[2:23:12] and gentlemen,
[2:23:14] may I have your attention?
[2:23:20] I want to introduce
[2:23:23] to you.

[2:24:52] to enter this arena. Thank you, Lord. to
[2:24:57] raise his hands in victory
[2:25:00] for me.
[2:25:04] But in angry crowd cried, crucify
[2:25:08] this king who wore their crown and they
[2:25:13] gladly watched their champion go down.
