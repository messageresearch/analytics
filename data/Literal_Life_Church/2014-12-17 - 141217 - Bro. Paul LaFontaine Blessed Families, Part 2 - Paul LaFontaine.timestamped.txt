[0:01] I am I am
[0:04] blessed I am blessed I am blessed every
[0:08] day that I
[0:12] live when I wake up in the morning till
[0:16] I lay my head to rest I am blessed
[0:21] Hallelujah I amess one more time and
[0:24] you're blessed tonight I am
[0:26] blessed I am
[0:28] blessed
[0:30] every day that I live I am blessed amen
[0:36] when I wake up in the morning till I lay
[0:40] my
[0:41] head I am blessed Hallelujah I am
[0:46] blessed amen let's give the Lord a hand
[0:49] clap of praise
[0:52] tonight Abraham seed tonight then we're
[0:55] blessed amen how many believe you're
[0:57] Abraham seed amen and we're a blessed
[0:59] group of people because of that because
[1:01] of his faith and that Faith passed down
[1:03] from generation to generation that same
[1:06] family God certainly blesses those
[1:08] families and that's what we were
[1:09] speaking on last Wednesday night we want
[1:10] to pick it up again if you want to turn
[1:12] with me to Genesis 12 in mentioning uh
[1:16] the prayer request I don't know if one
[1:18] of my family members wrote in but
[1:19] Gabriel is sick tonight home with um
[1:22] some type of sickness she came home from
[1:23] school early today so remember her in
[1:25] prayer and also continue to remember
[1:27] brother Ed's son there is very serious
[1:29] condition if you would we certainly
[1:30] appreciate it we're truly blessed
[1:32] tonight and uh we've had about I think
[1:35] $4,200 towards the furnace from the
[1:37] church here raised and our total is
[1:39] going to be 6,500 for both the units
[1:41] which as we said Sunday is a very uh
[1:44] I'll say as brother John said it's a
[1:45] miracle to have both units put in for
[1:48] the labor and everything for that so you
[1:50] just remember that if the Lord puts it
[1:52] on your heart to give towards that we're
[1:53] almost reached our goal to pay that off
[1:55] so we won't have to use any money out of
[1:57] the building fund if we raise it in the
[1:58] church here so we thank God for that
[2:00] amen praise the Lord we're going to
[2:02] we're speaking out about blessed
[2:03] families that's what it says here in
[2:05] Genesis 12:3 so we're going to continue
[2:08] this little series I might just go back
[2:10] a little bit over it from last Wednesday
[2:12] night so we can kind of check the uh
[2:14] channel that we're going in and uh we
[2:16] just pray that it'll be a blessing to
[2:18] you tonight as we just teach these
[2:19] things Genesis 12:1 the Lord had said
[2:22] unto Abraham get thee out of thy country
[2:24] and from thy Kindred and from thy
[2:26] Father's House unto a land that I will
[2:28] show thee and I will make thee a great
[2:31] nation and I will bless thee and make
[2:33] thy name great and thou shalt be a
[2:36] blessing and I will bless them that
[2:38] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[2:40] thee and in thee shall all families of
[2:44] the earth be blessed amen heavenly
[2:47] father thank you for your promise that
[2:49] Lord through this Faith line that you
[2:51] could bless families Lord with the honor
[2:55] and the privilege of being able to serve
[2:56] you in each generation so we pray
[2:58] tonight Lord your open the word to us
[3:00] we've taken the time lord the beginning
[3:03] of the service to express our heart to
[3:05] you in worship Lord we heard the people
[3:07] expressing their hearts through singing
[3:09] and through their hands and lifting up
[3:11] holy hands and we pray that you it would
[3:14] be a sweet smelling Savor to you tonight
[3:16] we pray it would go up to you Lord that
[3:18] that is perfected praise in your ears
[3:20] and your heart Lord and father you just
[3:22] come back now and speak those things
[3:24] that are solid those foundations those
[3:27] stones of Revelation those rocks Lord
[3:29] that we build our life upon I just pray
[3:32] Lord that you come forth and do that
[3:34] Lord and just meet every need that's in
[3:36] the house tonight those who are
[3:38] listening on the internet we just pray
[3:39] that you'll break through every barrier
[3:41] and Lord that you'll be able to bring
[3:43] freedom to our hearts through the word
[3:44] of God we just commit it wholly to you
[3:46] now we ask it in the name of Jesus
[3:49] Christ amen praise the Lord you may be
[3:51] seated tonight God bless each one for
[3:53] coming
[3:54] out certainly had a wonderful service
[3:56] Sunday and a wonderful spirit here we
[3:59] appreciate the the uh reception that the
[4:01] freedom that we felt in the service and
[4:04] it's good to have our visitors here
[4:05] tonight as well Wednesday night the
[4:07] townsin and all the visitors coming in
[4:10] for retreat and uh just God bless you
[4:12] all uh the gray family it's nice to have
[4:14] you we're looking for I seen your names
[4:16] on the I knew you were coming but I seen
[4:18] your names on the registration last
[4:19] night as we were working on the retreat
[4:21] stuff and so just good to have you all
[4:24] here praise the Lord are you glad to be
[4:25] in the house of the Lord amen you want
[4:28] to be a blessed family
[4:30] well the word of God says that you can
[4:31] be a family that's blessed and that
[4:33] blessing is passed down from our Father
[4:36] Abraham because of his obedience because
[4:38] of his faith because of the Revelation
[4:40] that he held because of holding steud to
[4:43] that then not only is it say that what
[4:46] he said I will bless them that bless the
[4:48] curse them that curseth thee and that is
[4:50] because not not because Abraham is a a a
[4:54] uh different person himself in the sense
[4:55] of his own personality but God chose
[4:58] Abraham and he made a a covenant with
[5:00] Abraham and that gave the distinction
[5:02] that he would be blessed and those that
[5:04] cursed him got cursed those that blessed
[5:06] him were blessed but this is the one I
[5:08] was looking at is that all the families
[5:10] of the Earth being blessed through this
[5:12] and that's quite a powerful trickle down
[5:14] effect from a man of Faith there is a
[5:17] trickle down effect from a man of faith
[5:19] and I want to apply this to our families
[5:21] because if we have a family of faith and
[5:24] we have a man of Faith uh leading the
[5:26] family even sometimes when we don't have
[5:28] that cuz there are many situations today
[5:31] where we don't have that man of Faith
[5:32] leading the family nonetheless the
[5:34] blessing can still come on a family if
[5:37] they're a family of faith if they're a
[5:39] family that holds the sword and we'll
[5:41] get to that towards the end of the
[5:42] service tonight Lord willing and that is
[5:44] you got to have you you may have the
[5:46] word but it takes a strong hand of Faith
[5:49] to take the word to the heart of the
[5:51] enemy and you can have all the message
[5:53] tapes and all the books and you can know
[5:55] about brother brand know all the stories
[5:57] you can have your Bible you can read it
[5:58] all the time but it takes something more
[6:00] than just the word it takes Faith with
[6:02] the word and Faith steps out and
[6:04] believes the word can you say amen and
[6:06] somebody in that family if not the best
[6:08] thing all of that family needs to have
[6:11] the same faith of Abraham to step out
[6:13] upon the word and uh bring things to the
[6:15] heart of the enemy because the enemy
[6:17] what he tries to do is is he tries to
[6:19] cover up God's promises to you and keep
[6:22] you from God's promises and His
[6:23] blessings for your family and all kinds
[6:25] of things of the world try to creep in
[6:27] and unbelief Creeps in and all these and
[6:30] that'll never stop until the Rapture but
[6:32] a blessed family that has a man of Faith
[6:34] or people of faith can take the sword of
[6:36] the word take it to the heart of the
[6:38] enemy and as brother Bram says that he
[6:40] says he says you just cut back until you
[6:42] can get to the promise of God we have to
[6:44] cut sometimes we have to use the hand of
[6:46] Faith to with the word of God to be able
[6:49] to get through and cut through what the
[6:51] enemy is trying to destroy and as I said
[6:53] last Wednesday night this is a good
[6:55] thing to talk about because Satan wants
[6:57] to bring a curse on families right Satan
[6:59] is out to curse families God is out to
[7:02] bless families Satan is out to divide
[7:05] families God is out to bring Oneness in
[7:08] families and uh we need to be on our
[7:10] toes all the time as Believers to
[7:12] realize his attack so much towards the
[7:14] families and uh we just are praising the
[7:17] Lord that he's bringing us back around
[7:19] to talk about this just to kind of go
[7:21] back over a little bit we realize that
[7:23] Abraham uh here in his Blessing God
[7:26] wanted to bless the families and uh he
[7:28] mentions it doesn't it doesn't mention
[7:31] your job as we said last Wednesday night
[7:34] doesn't mention a blessed business or a
[7:36] blessed job but he said families here
[7:39] and that's because in the mystery of God
[7:41] we find that God in the beginning had
[7:43] his desire to have a family on Earth of
[7:46] his own the original desire and the the
[7:49] Capstone of God as it were or the or or
[7:52] or the ultimate achievement of God was
[7:54] to fill his loneliness to make a family
[7:57] a family of sons and daughters of God
[8:00] for himself so that's why God doesn't
[8:02] see much in blessing a business he may
[8:05] bless your business or blessing a job or
[8:07] blessing some worldly thing what God
[8:10] really wants to bless is families what
[8:13] God had in his mind in a mystery before
[8:15] the foundation of the world was to
[8:17] express himself first and that he and
[8:19] man could become one and that he could
[8:21] have fellowship with his sons and
[8:23] daughters he could have preeminence in a
[8:25] family to express his character in a
[8:28] family and so in the very beginning that
[8:30] is the mystery of God is God created a
[8:32] family we're going to read from that
[8:33] tonight and go back to the beginnings
[8:35] because that's where we learn God's
[8:37] heart is to see what he began this for
[8:40] so in God's loneliness he wanted a
[8:42] family and we find that when God brings
[8:45] a family that's what God uh that's what
[8:48] God wanted to bring the beginning and
[8:49] that's what God wants to bless now is
[8:52] the families even in the last days here
[8:54] in Satan's Eden the thing that he want
[8:57] because if you have blessed families and
[8:59] and strong families you have strong
[9:00] churches right if you have families that
[9:03] are one with God and one with one
[9:04] another you can have Oneness in the
[9:06] church but when Satan breaks up the
[9:08] marriages and breaks up the families and
[9:10] breaks Divi brings division there then
[9:12] it's a trickle down effect to the church
[9:14] as well and uh that that that has
[9:16] happened and we see that uh many times
[9:19] happening and we have to really get
[9:20] aggressive with the Enemy that's in this
[9:23] day that's trying to destroy Oneness can
[9:25] you say Amen so so now that is God's
[9:29] crowning achievement when he created
[9:31] male and female and and his IM man and
[9:34] His Image in the beginning when he had
[9:36] him there in Genesis 1 they weren't even
[9:39] separated yet as far as in body but they
[9:41] were one in spirit both male and female
[9:43] that was God's crowning achievement
[9:45] that's why he rested the seventh day
[9:47] because he couldn't go on creating he
[9:49] couldn't cap that that was his top
[9:51] Capstone it was his crowning achievement
[9:54] is to have the potential there for
[9:57] family God God's crowning achievement
[10:00] was that marriage and that family that
[10:02] he was making for himself and for his
[10:05] son on earth when he says now I'm going
[10:07] to give you Dominion but it wasn't just
[10:08] the Dominion he says I want you to be
[10:10] fruitful and multiply God was wanting to
[10:13] create more children of his own God was
[10:15] wanting to fellowship with more of the
[10:17] children that was in his in his mind
[10:19] before the foundation of the world and
[10:21] so now you can ra imagine why God rested
[10:24] the seventh day his true peace his true
[10:27] Sabbath was this after to this crowning
[10:29] achievement this beautiful creation all
[10:32] that God did and yet he ended all ended
[10:35] it all with creating someone in His
[10:37] image a being in His image that had the
[10:39] potential for a family coming into
[10:42] Oneness and that just moved the heart of
[10:44] God I really believe it did it moved
[10:45] God's heart and until he said when he
[10:48] was finished with all he says it's good
[10:49] it's good of course then when he he
[10:52] formed Adam Out of the Dust and then he
[10:55] then he took a rib and made the wife
[10:57] then we realize after that that then uh
[11:00] Adam is there and the reason he made the
[11:01] wife is because after all this was good
[11:03] good good good then he says he looked at
[11:05] Adam says it's not good because he's
[11:08] alone he doesn't have a helpmate he
[11:11] doesn't have fellowship and he could
[11:12] relate to that because he was alone with
[11:15] his attributes he was alone by himself
[11:18] he wanted to fellowship with his
[11:19] attributes and so God in his
[11:21] multiplication in his multiplying he was
[11:25] creating a whole earth that he could put
[11:27] man on and bring his sons to and
[11:30] daughters into manifestation so that he
[11:32] could fellowship with them and so when
[11:35] all the creation had a counterpart but
[11:37] Adam God said this is not go good notice
[11:41] Adam he could create he had the power to
[11:43] create he had the power to he name in
[11:46] The Animals he had dominion over the
[11:49] entire Earth he had everything and yet
[11:51] God said it's not good now Believers
[11:55] through faith and the authority of the
[11:57] word have power to do do things can you
[11:59] say
[12:00] Amen but let's always remember what
[12:03] God's achievement is Faith can do a lot
[12:06] of things faith can create faith can lay
[12:09] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[12:11] faith can cause you to step out on God's
[12:14] promises for many things can you say
[12:16] amen and Adam was standing there with
[12:18] that power to create and yet God said
[12:21] it's still not good showing us that
[12:25] family and relationship and God bringing
[12:28] two that could Fellowship together was
[12:30] more important even the power to create
[12:34] somebody say praise the Lord that's good
[12:36] God showing because Adam had all of that
[12:38] he stood there with all the power and
[12:40] yet said when I look at you Adam it's
[12:42] still not
[12:44] good the crowning achievement is that
[12:47] there would be a fellowship and a
[12:48] Oneness expressed in fellowship with a
[12:50] husband and wife and a family can you
[12:52] say amen God was Desiring that himself
[12:56] and so now with all that power it still
[12:58] wasn't good until God created someone as
[13:00] a helpmate with him that he could have
[13:02] fellowship with he could have
[13:03] relationship with always remember that
[13:06] that you can achieve a lot of things in
[13:07] life you young people remember you can
[13:09] achieve a lot of things in life but
[13:11] always remember you serve a god that
[13:13] relationship is more important than
[13:15] anything else you can have all the money
[13:18] of the world and all the possessions of
[13:19] the world but if you don't have good
[13:21] relationships you don't have anything
[13:23] especially with God when the
[13:26] relationships are broken because of
[13:28] money when relationships are broken
[13:30] because overworking yourself to get
[13:32] money when relationships are broken
[13:34] because you're in debt up to your ear
[13:36] loads God is not pleased because God to
[13:40] God everything is about relationships
[13:42] and anything that breaks relationship
[13:44] the whole kingdom is destroyed because
[13:46] the relationship's not there can you say
[13:47] amen and so now just refreshing your
[13:50] mind from last Wednesday night that was
[13:51] a summary um that didn't cost you
[13:53] anything that was free that was just
[13:54] some summary if you weren't here just to
[13:56] bring you into the channel That We're In
[13:58] to realize how important this is how
[14:00] many wants to be a blessed family amen
[14:04] so now you know it's been a little while
[14:06] since we did a little series on the
[14:07] family I don't know how long this will
[14:08] go but it's been quite a while since we
[14:11] talked about the family and you know but
[14:14] even though I haven't talked about it
[14:15] it's been the greatest dominant thing as
[14:17] a Christian as a father it's been the
[14:20] the the dominant thing in my mind the
[14:22] last few years uh many years now I've
[14:25] been pondering these things and I think
[14:27] I've backed off a little bit from
[14:28] preaching on it a lot because uh I have
[14:31] wanted to just learn uh by working on it
[14:35] and implying things rather than
[14:36] preaching on it a lot um I wanted to be
[14:39] a little bit humble like that because
[14:41] you can talk a lot about it and then all
[14:43] of a sudden but you're not really living
[14:45] it and you're not really applying the
[14:46] things that's in the word and I just
[14:48] wanted to learn I wanted to observe and
[14:50] I I've been right in the thick of it
[14:52] I've been right in the trenes of raising
[14:53] teenagers man and uh when you're when
[14:57] you're when you're first married you
[14:59] think you're going to um you you got
[15:01] that Pride that you're going to you have
[15:03] the perfect kids and you think you've
[15:06] got the you know you were raised in a
[15:07] good family so and and I was thank the
[15:09] Lord so I thought well it's going to be
[15:11] real easy here and so this is going to
[15:12] be easy to do and so you start speaking
[15:15] yeah you do this and you do that and you
[15:16] do this and you do that well it's a big
[15:17] humbling thing you eat a lot of Humble
[15:19] Pie because some of those kids may not
[15:21] just conform the way you want them to
[15:23] conform I'm not going to mention any
[15:25] names tonight but I'll tell you it gets
[15:26] to be a a difficult thing but you see
[15:29] now maybe that's why I backed off a
[15:31] little bit is because rather than
[15:33] preaching on it I I just wanted to think
[15:35] through things and and I think like many
[15:38] things that we look at you you think you
[15:40] know so much and oh I got this this will
[15:42] be good I'll have a good family because
[15:44] I had a good family and it'll be easy
[15:46] now but once you're into it you realize
[15:49] it's a challenge to raise a Godly family
[15:52] in the last
[15:54] days didn't hear many amens on that but
[15:56] nevertheless it's the truth it's a
[15:58] challenge to raise a Godly family in
[16:01] this age all right let me say it this
[16:03] way it's a challenge to raise a normal
[16:05] family in the age we live in all right
[16:08] got a little bit more out of that it's a
[16:10] challenge just to have a normal family
[16:11] with normal relationships because
[16:13] there's so many guns trained on us
[16:15] there's so many things that divide the
[16:17] family there's so much uh spirits that
[16:19] come up in the family that try to divide
[16:21] us and uh we just want to come out the
[16:24] other side of our families and raising
[16:27] our children uh balanced uh and and
[16:30] normal kids and balanced kids and most
[16:32] of all filled with the Holy Ghost I
[16:34] can't think of a greater desire than to
[16:36] see my children walk in truth because of
[16:38] the Holy Ghost that is my desire and
[16:40] it's been a dominant thing in my mind to
[16:42] be able to see my children it wouldn't
[16:45] do any good to preach for 30 years over
[16:47] this pulpit and not see your children
[16:49] see the reality of it that they embrace
[16:51] the same thing that is I take no joy in
[16:53] that whatsoever because friends our
[16:55] children are
[16:57] credentials we can talk a lot about the
[17:00] word but how we live the word in front
[17:01] of them it there's it's it's more what's
[17:04] caught than what's taught right right
[17:07] and I want to be so in love with Jesus
[17:10] Christ that my children see that it's a
[17:13] love affair and not a duty as such that
[17:17] they are crave crave this same joyful
[17:22] experience it's not an easy experience
[17:24] but it's a joyful experience and there
[17:26] is no other life to live there is no
[17:28] Greater Life to Live I want my children
[17:30] to be able to fall in love with Jesus
[17:32] that way amen amen that's my desire and
[17:35] that's why it's been such a a thing that
[17:37] I've so prayed about and and looked over
[17:39] and and once you start getting humble
[17:41] and you realize you don't know it all
[17:42] then you start giving less advice and
[17:45] just start shutting up and start praying
[17:47] more and taking it one day at a time how
[17:50] many can you say Amen to that amen yeah
[17:52] you humble yourself a little bit I know
[17:54] some people uh still go around and think
[17:56] that they uh are in their pride feel
[17:58] that the way the way they're raising
[18:00] their kids or raising them is the best
[18:02] way and it's above everybody else and
[18:04] like the Bible says every man is right
[18:06] in his own eyes uh we still sometimes
[18:08] have that and families that feel that
[18:10] way but I I think we should be confident
[18:13] in what we're doing but not proud in
[18:15] what we're
[18:16] doing I think we should be confident
[18:19] parents that we lead them in the things
[18:20] of the Lord but not proud and ready to
[18:22] repent when we do
[18:24] wrong you know w r o n g wrong when
[18:28] you're wrong admit you're
[18:29] wrong can you say amen amen that's one
[18:33] of the greatest things I think as a
[18:34] characteristic of my dad that I can say
[18:36] besides the fact I knew that he sat and
[18:39] read read the Bible to us and the
[18:40] devotions and things he times he spent
[18:42] with us in the evenings and taking the
[18:44] prayer requests and such but there was
[18:45] another thing about him that when he
[18:47] made a mistake he repented of it openly
[18:49] in front of us he owned up to what he
[18:50] did wrong he didn't make a lot of
[18:52] mistakes but when he did it he did it in
[18:54] front of us and he owned up to it and
[18:56] that spoke volumes to me of a man that
[18:58] can humble himself and say I may not get
[19:00] it right every day but I know the goal
[19:02] that I'm shooting for is to raise a
[19:04] family with the token applied to the
[19:05] home and to see my children filled with
[19:07] the Holy Ghost that's the ultimate goal
[19:09] remember Sunday I was preaching on the
[19:11] destiny God looks at the destiny God
[19:14] doesn't look at the current problem or
[19:15] mistake you made God's looking at your
[19:17] destiny amen and when when God corrects
[19:20] you he's even looking at your destiny
[19:23] and when we as parents correct we should
[19:25] be looking at more than the the thing
[19:27] that they've done wrong but look at the
[19:28] destiny where we want to lead them
[19:30] towards can you say Amen praise the Lord
[19:33] so now we don't have it all figured out
[19:35] can you say Amen we don't know all the
[19:37] answers we we have to make adjustments
[19:39] and I think that's one of the uh the big
[19:42] things is to be able to be humble not
[19:44] proud and stay flexible and make
[19:45] adjustments when I say make changes and
[19:47] adjustments I don't mean to compromise
[19:49] on standards I don't believe in doing
[19:51] that but to just I feel like I've told
[19:53] people I feel like the last few years
[19:55] I've had to make adjustments uh the goal
[19:58] is to lead them and and to live in front
[20:00] of them God's kingdom ways that's what I
[20:03] want to do and to and to have their
[20:05] hearts and their trust is what I need to
[20:09] be able to lead them right because you
[20:11] can be leading them but you don't have
[20:13] their hearts and you don't have their
[20:14] trust so my first goal is to have their
[20:16] hearts to have their trust so that when
[20:19] I go to lead them they have some trust
[20:21] in me they have they they have trust me
[20:23] to lead them and you have to live a life
[20:25] and that's where you make the adjustment
[20:27] sometimes you make adjustments to keep
[20:30] their hearts and to have their hearts
[20:32] because you can go right along teaching
[20:34] teaching teaching this is what you need
[20:35] to do this is what you need to do and
[20:36] all the while you're losing their
[20:38] heart can you say amen yeah and having
[20:42] your their hearts to follow you is more
[20:44] important than just drilling principles
[20:47] into
[20:48] them and that wasn't as important as
[20:51] when they were little kids I didn't
[20:52] recognize that but I'll tell you when
[20:54] they start to get older having their
[20:56] hearts and having their attention and
[20:58] connecting with them is so extremely
[21:01] important to me and that's that's a
[21:03] challenge I feel like I make adjustments
[21:05] every day sometimes not compromises but
[21:08] adjustments because why I don't want to
[21:10] go in get to a place that our hearts are
[21:13] no longer on the same page you
[21:15] understand everybody understand that so
[21:18] you know it's more what's caught than uh
[21:21] than what is taught it's more powerful
[21:24] than what is taught whatever is taught
[21:26] must be backed up and here's another
[21:28] thing I've
[21:30] learned whatever is taught must be
[21:33] backed up with images that they're
[21:34] looking at whatever you're teaching
[21:37] whatever you're preaching they have to
[21:39] see images of what you're preaching at
[21:42] the church in the atmosphere you live in
[21:44] in the home now this world they not
[21:46] going to see images but there has to be
[21:48] enough places in atmosphere that they
[21:50] see images of what's being preached Sons
[21:53] and Daughters of God that are moving in
[21:55] that direction of what's being preached
[21:57] because I've learned learn images can be
[21:59] more powerful to young people than what
[22:01] is
[22:01] taught they'll tend to follow the images
[22:04] over what's being taught sometimes but
[22:06] if they have enough images and
[22:08] atmosphere and that's why brother says
[22:09] brother somebody asked brother Bram what
[22:11] should I do with my young teens what
[22:13] things should I allow them to
[22:14] participate in he said get them around
[22:16] good Christian Fellowship as often as
[22:19] you can if they're going to choose a
[22:21] boyfriend get them around some good boys
[22:23] if they're going to choose a girlfriend
[22:24] get them around some good girls and keep
[22:26] them in the atmosph spere so that they
[22:29] can see good images can you say amen and
[22:31] choose out of those images Right image
[22:34] is more important even than what's
[22:36] taught yeah oh I have another sermon on
[22:39] that but I'll tell you you could say so
[22:40] much about how powerful imag is not just
[22:43] to your teenagers but to you a lot of us
[22:46] are functioning by the images that we
[22:48] look at and the images that we get
[22:50] images from what we read we get images
[22:52] from what we see we get images of the
[22:54] people that are around us a mindset a
[22:57] thought set in other words a a mentality
[22:59] an approach to life that's an image
[23:02] that's an image too and so we take that
[23:05] and if we're not careful we'll buy into
[23:06] the wrong image and we're start to
[23:08] living start living something out
[23:10] because we bow at the images God has
[23:12] made us as a human being everybody with
[23:14] me here tonight amen God has designed
[23:17] our bodies that we are they were we're
[23:19] designed to worship we're designed to
[23:21] worship and because of that that's why
[23:23] man falls so quickly to Idols cuz we're
[23:26] made that way uh and animals aren't made
[23:28] that way humans are made that way and so
[23:30] we're so susceptible to Idols that's why
[23:32] in the Old Testament Israel fell to
[23:34] idols and a lot of those idols and the
[23:36] idol worship that went with it was more
[23:38] fleshly and sensual than the worship of
[23:40] Jehovah God that's why it became more
[23:42] appealing to the children of Israel to
[23:44] worship idols they were built to worship
[23:46] God made them that way but yet they
[23:48] leaned towards a more sensual fleshly
[23:51] thing to follow because it was just more
[23:53] fun right right but we're go you can't
[23:56] get around the way God built you but you
[23:58] have to pick and choose the right images
[24:02] to follow because whatever image we're
[24:04] looking at is what we're changed into
[24:06] that's and doesn't the bible say that
[24:08] about looking into the face of Christ as
[24:10] that we as we continually behold the
[24:12] face of Christ we are changed into that
[24:14] same image images have the most powerful
[24:17] effect on human beings what we're
[24:19] looking at what we read what we feed on
[24:22] forms the images of our thinking and
[24:24] that forms us into who we are and so
[24:27] when you're raising children that it's
[24:28] not just them you teaching the right
[24:31] things which you have a mandate from the
[24:33] scripture in Deuteronomy is that talk
[24:36] about these things when you get up talk
[24:37] about these things when you go to bed
[24:39] put them on the doorpost of your house
[24:41] put them everywhere talk about the word
[24:43] just it doesn't have to be a a long uh
[24:47] uh uh exhortation on the Seven Seals on
[24:51] Monday morning before they go to school
[24:53] please don't do that but it's talking
[24:56] about what God's doing in your life it's
[24:58] talking about what God taught you and
[25:00] then teach that to them what you've seen
[25:01] in the word teach it to them read the
[25:03] word with them it's not complicated but
[25:05] we as parents have a mandate to teach
[25:07] the word to our children and if you feel
[25:10] like you've waited too long to do that
[25:11] you still have a chance start teaching
[25:13] it to them now praise the Lord so we
[25:16] have a mandate to do that but I'm here
[25:18] to tell you teaching is not enough in
[25:20] this age because there's so many images
[25:23] of other things there's even images of
[25:26] Christians today and I'm not going to
[25:28] dechristianize them but there's
[25:30] Christians out there that are lovely
[25:32] people I know some of them I'm friends
[25:34] with some of them even in this area I'm
[25:36] very good friends with people I would
[25:38] never dechristianize their life but yet
[25:40] you have sometimes the definition of a
[25:42] Christian of a person that lives a a
[25:44] quite a worldly life in comparison to
[25:46] what the Bible Way is right right and
[25:49] that image of a person saying I'm a
[25:51] Christian can have an effect on a young
[25:54] person sometimes because they see that
[25:55] now wait a minute we're Christians and
[25:57] they're Christians what's wrong here Dad
[25:59] you see you know what that is that's
[26:01] image right right that's image and if
[26:03] they're not careful it'll Trump
[26:05] everything in the scripture and say I'm
[26:06] going with the image I want to go be a
[26:08] Christian like
[26:09] that they're allowed to wear pants
[26:11] they're allowed to do those things
[26:12] because they don't honor certain parts
[26:14] of the scripture so they're allowed to
[26:15] do all these other things and still be a
[26:16] Christian I can do that like the woman
[26:18] that who had those real high-held shoes
[26:19] on in the in the dream brother brah said
[26:21] and you know what she said to him I'm
[26:23] going to prove to you I can make it up
[26:24] that Holy Highway to Heaven with these
[26:26] heels on I can still be a Christian and
[26:29] have these heels on and she started to
[26:30] walk up and then she didn't go up she
[26:32] actually fell off the road and fell in
[26:34] another Direction but don't is her
[26:36] attitude I can still be a Christian and
[26:38] have these high
[26:39] heels and that's the attitude I'm
[26:42] laughing because I better uh I better
[26:45] keep going here because I'm getting
[26:46] myself in trouble but it's the truth
[26:48] nonetheless that's the attitude many
[26:49] times I can be a Christian and still do
[26:51] this you better check that through the
[26:53] filter of God's word you can't bring
[26:56] caked on makeup through the filter of
[26:57] God's word you can't ring real high
[26:59] spiked high heel shoes through the
[27:01] filter of God's word it won't come
[27:03] through there it may become come through
[27:05] your filter but not through the filter
[27:06] of the word so we can't have the
[27:08] attitude of that image that says they
[27:10] can still do this not when it's in a
[27:14] direct contradiction to the word no
[27:15] matter how good it looks but sometimes
[27:17] in our weakness we'll choose an image
[27:19] and turn down parts of the word because
[27:22] image can be more more powerful in our
[27:25] lives than what's said
[27:28] praise the Lord so you need to make sure
[27:31] that the images you're
[27:33] following are lined up with the word of
[27:35] God Amen and the images that you're
[27:37] putting before your children what you're
[27:39] letting them part participate in the
[27:42] atmospheres that you allow them to be
[27:43] around you're directing the atmospheres
[27:46] that they're around I'm directing my
[27:48] children until I'm uh they they are off
[27:51] on their own I have the authority as a
[27:54] dad and I have the the Mandate from God
[27:56] as a dad to direct who they're around
[28:00] what they're feeding on in my home what
[28:02] kind of music they're listening to I
[28:04] have to direct that in the right way but
[28:06] I've got to give direction to that
[28:08] because I know how the heart works I
[28:10] know how it can be distracted to the
[28:11] wrong thing I know how the flesh works
[28:13] trust me yeah because I'm flesh too
[28:16] right yes and sometimes in their young
[28:19] years they don't fully understand how
[28:22] powerful images are on their flesh so I
[28:25] have to be the Holy Ghost for them
[28:28] I have to help lead them so yeah I'm
[28:30] weighing in on who they stay overnight
[28:32] with I'm weighing in on uh they often
[28:35] ask about the kids at school there and
[28:37] all that and said I just say listen if I
[28:38] don't know the family and I I don't know
[28:41] what they stand for is that we're not
[28:43] going to have a big p pajama party with
[28:45] them you know say hi to them at school
[28:47] be friends with them all you want to but
[28:49] spending the night's another story ah
[28:51] Dad yeah you're so rough and all these
[28:54] other things all right but I'm the dad
[28:56] and I've got to walk watch over this
[28:58] thing and I don't feel one well I do
[29:01] feel bad
[29:02] sometimes but but I'm trying to look two
[29:07] years down the road and where it goes
[29:09] I'm trying to have a a a
[29:10] multigenerational vision for my
[29:14] kids I hope you're getting something out
[29:16] of this tonight I'm just sharing from my
[29:18] heart most of this but I I just want to
[29:20] uh realize and cause you to realize how
[29:22] important images are to them the images
[29:24] will have more an effect on them than
[29:26] what is said
[29:27] another thing is I watch other families
[29:29] I learned from
[29:30] that but maybe I've not said too much
[29:33] about it but the word has many good
[29:35] things to say about it in relation to
[29:37] the family and its families that he
[29:40] wanted to bless and to be a blessing on
[29:44] Abraham and his seed can you say amen
[29:47] that's the point is God wants to bless
[29:49] your family and God wants to bless the
[29:52] families of Abraham's seed a matter of
[29:55] fact he said all the families of the
[29:57] Earth Earth will be blessed that's a
[29:59] pretty powerful trickle down effect from
[30:01] Abraham's faith is that there's God's
[30:03] doing something so special in him it'll
[30:05] have an effect on the blessings of the
[30:07] families and I want my family to be
[30:08] blessed and so I shared with you is that
[30:10] maybe that's why I haven't said much
[30:12] because I want to learn but I want to
[30:13] take this little series on the family
[30:15] you just be praying with me we'll take
[30:17] it on some Wednesday nights here Lord
[30:18] willing in in January after the retreat
[30:21] hopefully the Lord will allow me to
[30:22] continue on and speak about it and some
[30:25] specifics uh about fathers and mothers
[30:27] and and children and all these other
[30:29] things and relationships and uh what to
[30:32] not do and what to do and you know what
[30:34] to say what to not say what breaks up uh
[30:37] uh breaks the brings Division and what
[30:40] doesn't bring Division and some
[30:42] specifics and I just pray that it will
[30:43] be a blessing to you in some way so
[30:46] we've been praying a little bit where do
[30:48] we start then if we're going to talk
[30:49] about the families where do we start and
[30:51] I was listening to Oneness last week the
[30:54] message that was preached called Oneness
[30:56] from 1962
[30:57] and I was listening to that and God just
[30:59] LED my heart and said that's the place
[31:02] to start is Oneness because when he had
[31:04] his original family they had perfect
[31:06] Oneness and when he wants to create a
[31:09] family you you you really in reality you
[31:12] don't really have a family unless you'd
[31:15] address the subject of
[31:18] Oneness you don't have a family because
[31:20] you physically had kids right right a
[31:23] definition of family to God is Oneness
[31:26] right God wanted to have Oneness on
[31:29] Earth between people that live in the
[31:32] same house every day yeah in the same
[31:34] tent in the Old Testament in the same
[31:36] house every day around each other
[31:39] different personalities different
[31:41] natures and it's like this and then it
[31:44] gets harder and harder and and and so
[31:47] God wanted to take out of that family
[31:50] unit but he wanted the definition of a
[31:52] family he wanted to be in a reflection
[31:55] of Oneness and that should be our goal
[31:57] that's a great goal for our family if
[32:00] you want to write it down let's start
[32:02] there what's the goal for my family to
[32:05] make a million dollars no what's the
[32:07] goal for my family to go to Cedar Point
[32:09] every year no that's not it go to Cedar
[32:13] Point whatever you want to do what what
[32:16] is the what is the first thing that
[32:18] should be a goal we want to do this this
[32:20] year our family has goals we sit down
[32:22] and we talk about our goals I've got a
[32:24] family Covenant that I made years ago
[32:26] it's it's in the file there and it's a
[32:28] long-term family lifetime vision for my
[32:31] family with specifics on it where we
[32:33] want to go in natural things and
[32:34] spiritual things it's a covenant for my
[32:36] family and made all the kids sign it and
[32:38] all that and so but what is what's the
[32:42] beginning there's a lot of different
[32:43] goals you can have but what's the first
[32:45] goal for a family Oneness with God and
[32:51] Oneness with one
[32:52] another now you tell me is that a good
[32:55] place to
[32:56] start if we're going to talk about how
[32:58] to build the foundation of a good of a
[33:02] blessed family let's start there with a
[33:06] goal Oneness with God and Oneness with
[33:10] one
[33:12] another because that's what Co God
[33:14] really looks at as a real family you
[33:16] start on real Oneness if you don't have
[33:19] that you don't really have the family
[33:21] that God could bless you to be you might
[33:24] still be in the same house but there's
[33:26] no connection there's no Oneness it's
[33:29] the same as saying there is a true
[33:31] definition of a father and there's just
[33:33] a just the world's definition of a
[33:36] father and it's come down to a father is
[33:38] just somebody that was with someone
[33:39] sexually and the woman conceived seed
[33:42] and he had a son and daughter by that
[33:44] woman and so now he's technically called
[33:46] the father but that doesn't mean that
[33:48] he's a real father right God's
[33:51] definition is you go back to Abraham a
[33:53] father of many nations a father he says
[33:55] I know he'll said about about Moses I'll
[33:57] he'll command his house well that's the
[34:00] definition of a real father that He
[34:02] commands his house well that he has a
[34:05] multigenerational vision which Abraham
[34:07] had that he has these things that the
[34:09] reasons why he's teaching his kids so a
[34:10] father could be just someone who
[34:12] actually just has a child walks away
[34:15] never wants to see the child again let
[34:16] the woman keep him that's why a lot of
[34:18] women are dependent on the government
[34:19] there because there's so many fathers uh
[34:22] back when I was managing my properties
[34:25] most of my tenants were single women
[34:26] with lots of children sometimes by
[34:28] different fathers every one of them I
[34:30] couldn't believe it almost every one of
[34:31] them my tenants came in were in that
[34:33] situation and I don't know the reasons
[34:35] maybe they each child they get
[34:37] government help for each one I don't
[34:38] know but the father was not in the
[34:40] picture at all and if he ever was she
[34:43] was out doing all the work and he was at
[34:46] home with the video games right cuz I'd
[34:48] go collect my rent and that's where
[34:49] daddy was yeah oh he was supposed to be
[34:52] watching the kids right but he's there
[34:54] playing videos for hours and she's the
[34:56] one that's got a full-time job yeah
[34:58] that's how twisted we're we are right
[35:01] that's how twisted we are but he's not a
[35:03] real father he's just technically he had
[35:05] a child same with mothers can you say
[35:07] Amen there's a definition of a real
[35:10] nurturing mother that wants to be with
[35:12] those children that's a real calling of
[35:14] a mother The Fifth Gospel brother Braham
[35:17] says to make that connection with don't
[35:19] don't let anybody else make those
[35:20] connections with the kid that mother
[35:22] should make the connection with that kid
[35:25] but you see then you got mothers today
[35:26] that soon as as soon as they have it
[35:28] within a few weeks they want to drop it
[35:31] off at the daycare they want to give it
[35:33] and stay away from that child as much as
[35:34] they can the bare minimum with that kid
[35:36] or it's going to make me crazy and go I
[35:38] can't take it I need to go work and all
[35:40] these other things that's a detriment to
[35:42] the age we live in that's for sure it's
[35:43] a terrible thing but it's another
[35:45] definition of somebody that calls that a
[35:48] mother and I would never not call her a
[35:50] mom but I'm just saying that there's
[35:52] deeper there's deeper things to being a
[35:54] mother than just having a child
[35:57] so if that's true about fathers true
[35:59] about mothers then it's true about
[36:02] families you don't have a family just
[36:05] simply because you have kids running
[36:06] around the
[36:07] house we have a family because we're
[36:09] praying for Oneness in that
[36:11] family right Oneness in that family so
[36:16] you raise you raise them you you you
[36:18] nourish them and uh in the en of the
[36:21] Lord but when there's disconnections
[36:23] then we realize something's wrong in the
[36:24] family unit the longing to be connected
[36:27] in the heart is what is needed so that
[36:30] is what what is needed in a blessed
[36:31] family of God not just that you have
[36:34] kids in the same house not just you have
[36:36] a husband or wife uh but you have
[36:38] Oneness there is an
[36:41] anchor that you all agree on and now
[36:44] we're going to get into Oneness there's
[36:46] an
[36:47] anchor among yourself that you all agree
[36:50] on that's what brings
[36:52] Oneness there is a standard there is a
[36:56] there is not not only a standard but
[36:57] there's a spirit that dominates to make
[37:01] those standards lived in the home and
[37:03] everybody agrees with that standard now
[37:06] you're talking
[37:08] Oneness so let's get into it the message
[37:10] Oneness he says uh at the beginning here
[37:13] he says now this Oneness means to be one
[37:15] with it means to be United and now this
[37:18] is quite a subject this Oneness subject
[37:20] and it deserves a lot more attention
[37:22] than I'm able to give it and more than
[37:24] most any person on the earth could be
[37:26] able to give it I say it's pretty
[37:29] important he said it deserves more
[37:31] attention than him and more attention
[37:33] than I guess any person on the earth
[37:34] could ever give it so you imagine where
[37:36] I stand here
[37:37] tonight this subject of Oneness is uh uh
[37:42] extremely important if you've never
[37:44] taken the time to study Oneness in the
[37:46] Bible and study what it means I'd say by
[37:49] that comment we should make it a
[37:51] priority to say Lord help me to
[37:52] understand it
[37:54] better because it deserves a lot of
[37:56] attention
[37:58] it means he says to be one with and he
[38:01] says I will I I would like to express to
[38:03] you my opinion of it and with what God
[38:05] has given us now it's in this teaching
[38:08] do in this is a teaching Doctrine and to
[38:10] the Brethren who may hear this tape I
[38:12] trust that you will not take be uh an
[38:15] offense but but it will be to to cause
[38:18] you to take this very considerably under
[38:20] consideration rather that you would
[38:22] study it prayerfully carefully and weigh
[38:25] it out in the back balance of God's word
[38:27] to see whether it's of God or not that's
[38:31] the prophet encouraging you to take what
[38:35] he preaches and study it
[38:38] prayerfully carefully and weigh it out
[38:41] in the balance of God's word so any kind
[38:44] of voices that saying that we're just
[38:45] supposed to just take this and just
[38:47] accept it no here's the prophet saying
[38:50] take an important message like this get
[38:51] your Bible and prayerfully study it
[38:53] carefully weigh it out with the balance
[38:55] of God's word can you say amen amen it's
[38:58] good advice for I believe that that's
[39:00] the way we should always do weigh things
[39:03] with the word because the word is the
[39:06] only thing that will be able to remain
[39:09] that's God's program he goes on to say
[39:11] later that's God's program listen
[39:13] friends this is God's
[39:15] program God has a program it's not of
[39:18] the world but he has a program and so as
[39:20] we study it and prayerfully look at
[39:22] these things we come back to God's way
[39:24] God's program God's B Bible Way God's
[39:27] path for our lives God's PA God's
[39:30] answers to things they're written in the
[39:32] word of God you will be surprised how
[39:35] many answers you think that there's not
[39:37] answers to if you stay prayerfully
[39:39] there's answers in the word about it
[39:40] that's right God's not going to leave
[39:42] his people hanging at the last days that
[39:44] there's a bunch of questions we don't
[39:45] know answers to God's Not that kind of
[39:47] God he's not the author of confusion he
[39:49] gave his word for his people but people
[39:52] don't take the time many times to be
[39:54] prayerful about it and take time with it
[39:57] until God speaks the answer out of the
[39:59] word of God but the answers are there
[40:02] it's written in the word of God
[40:06] Amen praise the Lord so now here's the
[40:08] first thing he says about it first man
[40:10] the first man and woman in the Garden of
[40:11] Eden was in perfect harmony with God so
[40:16] much that God could come down at any
[40:19] time he desired and talk lip to ear with
[40:22] Adam and Eve now that is perfect Oneness
[40:26] God and His
[40:28] creation God speaking lip to ear with
[40:31] Adam and Eve and they were so perfect in
[40:34] harmony with God till they were one with
[40:37] God God and his family was one that's
[40:40] the first thing he says and the first
[40:42] word he mentions is
[40:44] harmony Harmony's not here tonight is
[40:48] she Harmony what is harmony that's the
[40:51] first thing he says about Oneness is
[40:53] that God and his his son and daughter
[40:56] were in perfect harmony with one another
[40:58] and they were in perfect Oneness with
[41:00] one another so much so God could come
[41:02] down in the cool of the day and
[41:04] fellowship with them and there was no
[41:06] walls there was no hindrances there was
[41:08] no sin there was nothing there that made
[41:11] God back off from fellowship with them
[41:13] which probably which would have been sin
[41:15] right would have been condemnation would
[41:17] have been a lot of things that would it
[41:19] nothing there to cause that he couldn't
[41:20] have complete openness with them and
[41:23] there was nothing there in their hearts
[41:24] to make them afraid of God
[41:26] or that they couldn't be open with God
[41:28] there were no
[41:29] walls there was nothing between them
[41:32] there was no things to resolve it had
[41:34] all been resolved right well there
[41:36] wasn't anything to resolve yet can you
[41:39] say Amen what a perfect harmony all the
[41:41] walls were down the intimacy was there
[41:44] the closeness the Oneness was there
[41:46] that's what true intimacy is the world
[41:48] often misinterprets that but the true
[41:50] meaning to intimacy is
[41:52] Oneness and closeness where there a
[41:54] relationship without any walls without
[41:57] any I wonder oh without any guilt I
[41:59] wonder what he's thinking what he's
[42:01] thinking there was never any of that God
[42:03] came down he felt comfortable and
[42:05] brother Brandon describes it two or
[42:06] three different places you know uh he
[42:08] just at night is he kissed them good
[42:11] night he laid his hand on them is there
[42:12] any needs that you have and that the
[42:14] Lions would gather around and the Tigers
[42:16] and he just lay their head brother BR
[42:18] says on the on the tiger there let them
[42:20] use the tiger or the lion for a
[42:24] pillow and you know and and so brother
[42:27] Bram describes he just came down and
[42:29] spoke to them they could hear his voice
[42:31] uh rustling there in the in the bushes
[42:33] and the voice of the Lord came and
[42:35] communed with them and brother Bram says
[42:37] here it was perfect harmony with God so
[42:40] much God could come down at any
[42:45] time he desired Li to talk lip to ear
[42:48] with Adam and Eve now that is perfect
[42:50] Oneness God in his creation God speaking
[42:52] and so they were in this Oneness because
[42:55] of their Harmony
[42:56] Harmony means a pleasing Arrangement or
[42:59] combination of things we would first
[43:01] think of notes all right when you're
[43:03] playing notes should have Roger do this
[43:06] but you know if if you have a song uh
[43:09] you have the melody to the song but the
[43:12] harmony is what Co what colors
[43:23] it that's the melody of the song All You
[43:26] music people know that some of you
[43:27] people that are non-music people didn't
[43:30] know that and I just gave you a piano
[43:32] lesson music
[43:35] lesson but then Harmony go Harmony
[43:38] aligns itself with the melody
[43:42] okay and and you'll be able to tell and
[43:44] I can tell you that non-music people can
[43:47] tell if something's in harmony or not
[43:49] they may not be able to sing harmony my
[43:51] dad can't sing
[43:52] harmony I I don't know why he just he
[43:55] just we when we were kids we just say
[43:58] he'd try it we say dad you know just
[43:59] leave it
[44:00] alone you know stick to the
[44:03] Melody I think I can sing bass here I
[44:05] think I do no it just you know I think
[44:07] one time he got it on and that was
[44:10] it but that's the melody by itself it's
[44:13] not very colored it's nice matter of
[44:15] fact the the people in Lutheran's Day
[44:18] from the Catholic Church on that's when
[44:20] they one thing they kept probably Roger
[44:21] knows this and Isaac is that and Sharon
[44:23] as well is that they they felt Harmony
[44:26] was of the devil and so they could only
[44:28] play The Melody that's why you have the
[44:30] the chants and all those things going on
[44:31] it's just the melody was sung because
[44:33] they felt Harmony was worldly well
[44:35] Harmony is not worldly Harmony comes
[44:36] from
[44:37] God and so we then soon as you take that
[44:41] simple Melody and you start to color it
[44:43] notice now all but all there's a lot of
[44:46] keys on this but the the harmony has to
[44:49] be lined up with the melody the melody
[44:52] is the absolute in order for there to be
[44:55] Harmony it has to to line itself up with
[44:57] the
[45:11] melody now see some of you non-m music
[45:13] people knew I got off track besides my
[45:15] face turning the way it
[45:17] did but but it's it it just becomes more
[45:20] colored it just becomes but I could play
[45:23] that same song and get off like I did
[45:25] several times and it would become
[45:26] irritating to you and even non-music
[45:29] people could tell I don't know what's
[45:31] wrong but something's
[45:35] wrong right if somebody doesn't play
[45:37] something right you see somebody mess up
[45:38] on a special or something they don't
[45:39] know how to play the song and so they're
[45:41] hitting all kinds of chords that don't
[45:43] match the song at all usually most
[45:45] people can tell there's something wrong
[45:46] they don't know what's wrong but
[45:48] something is wrong and the meaning to
[45:50] this harmony thing is is an arrangement
[45:53] and a combination of things notes and
[45:54] music a pleasing in arrangement in other
[45:56] words it's pleasing to the years it's
[45:58] pleasing because it's arranged right so
[46:02] now we find there's there's Harmony has
[46:04] some other meanings here of course
[46:05] Harmony is in in agreement it
[46:07] complements the melody if not it clashes
[46:10] all right so if har if if the notes are
[46:13] not in harmony then they clash with the
[46:16] melody and that's where you have
[46:18] clashes and so now here's another mean
[46:20] an orderly an orderly or Harmony means
[46:23] an an orderly or pleasing combination of
[46:26] elements in a whole color Harmony and
[46:29] that here the the order and Harmony of
[46:30] the universe that's an example it also
[46:34] it means a relationship Harmony means a
[46:36] relationship in which various components
[46:39] exist together without destroying one
[46:43] another various
[46:47] components uh I want to read that again
[46:49] that's good it's uh a relationship in
[46:53] which various components exist together
[46:57] without destroying one
[46:58] another examples different kinds of fish
[47:01] living in
[47:04] harmony number three it means a
[47:06] relationship characterized by a lack of
[47:10] conflict or by agreement as of opinion
[47:13] or interest and that's family Harmony a
[47:16] f a relationship characterized by a lack
[47:18] of conflict or by agreement and it's
[47:20] going to be the same word brother Brown
[47:22] uses here in a minute that word
[47:23] agreement there's a lack of conflict
[47:25] there's an agreement as a point of
[47:27] interest that in their terms is family
[47:30] har Harmony so he came down in the cool
[47:33] of the day there was Fellowship there
[47:35] was no walls God felt comfortable and so
[47:37] and and all they felt comfortable and
[47:40] thus you had harmony with God you had
[47:42] Oneness Oneness with God is't that
[47:45] wonderful praise the Lord so that's the
[47:49] first thing he says there was perfect
[47:51] Oneness because there was Harmony
[47:53] between God and man in the Garden of
[47:56] Eden we should desire that we should
[47:59] desire to have that uh Harmony where it
[48:02] lines up with the melody notice there
[48:04] has to be a Melody there has to be an
[48:08] absolute there has to be something to
[48:10] agree
[48:11] with right because you got all these
[48:14] different fish you got all these
[48:15] different opinions so there has in order
[48:18] to be Oneness there has to be something
[48:20] to agree
[48:21] with and everybody comes in agreement
[48:24] with that and then you start to have the
[48:27] harmony for a Godly family his next
[48:29] comment he says is any man and his
[48:32] family I feel like I'm getting late here
[48:33] am I all right quarter after eight all
[48:36] right any man in his family a correct
[48:40] good Noble obedient family is one with
[48:43] one another any family and if there's
[48:46] something in that family that moves them
[48:47] apart then it's not right the family is
[48:50] broken somewhere they should all be one
[48:52] father with Mother Mother with father
[48:54] children with parent
[48:56] parent with children all in agreement
[48:58] and when you see that you'll see one
[49:01] lovely picture that's God's purpose so
[49:03] he's he's laying down what Oneness is
[49:05] true Oneness between God and man but you
[49:08] can't hardly talk about Oneness between
[49:09] God and man without talking about the
[49:11] Oneness of a family right a Oneness of
[49:14] father and mother a Oneness with
[49:15] children with the father children with
[49:18] the mother you have to talk about and so
[49:21] I'm glad he gave a whole paragraph to
[49:22] say a correct good Noble obedient family
[49:26] is one with one another and uh notice he
[49:29] says you I don't think you can use I
[49:32] don't think you can teach this of a good
[49:34] family without using the word obedient
[49:36] and he uses the term good Noble obedient
[49:42] family obedience has to be a part of
[49:45] it but I ask you obedience to
[49:49] what obedience to
[49:52] what all have to be
[49:56] all have to have something to be
[49:59] obedient to to have a solid family and
[50:04] I'm including the dad any dads who are
[50:07] thinking yeah that's right if they'd all
[50:09] just agree with me and be obedient to me
[50:12] that's how the family works that's not
[50:14] what he's saying right he's saying the
[50:17] whole family has to OB be obedient to
[50:20] something right and you can't have a
[50:23] family of Oneness without obedience
[50:26] don't you ever try to have a family that
[50:29] just goes and build on the foundation of
[50:30] rebellion and teach your children that
[50:32] you question all authority and you
[50:34] question your employer you question all
[50:36] decisions that were made you're going to
[50:37] have a rough life and your children are
[50:39] going to have a rough life he's saying
[50:41] that this is a correct Noble obedient
[50:43] family they have learned not by mental
[50:45] but by Spirit to be obedient to
[50:48] something
[50:49] right can't have a you cannot have a
[50:52] correct family unless you teach
[50:54] obedience unless you live obedience
[50:57] unless the daddy lives obedience can you
[50:59] say Amen it's it's obedience so none of
[51:02] it can be without obedience Disobedience
[51:05] from Daddy down will break Oneness
[51:08] Disobedience from Daddy all the way down
[51:10] will break the Oneness you can have an
[51:12] obedient family and a daddy who's
[51:14] disobedient to what to what he's just
[51:17] disobedient that's his manner you'll
[51:20] never have Oneness in that family all
[51:22] the kids and all the wife is in
[51:23] obedience but the daddy's not obedient
[51:25] OB to God the daddy's not obedient to
[51:28] Authority daddy does what he want that
[51:30] family will break up can't have true
[51:33] Oneness without
[51:34] that you can't have it without obedience
[51:37] so it's and it's we'll use another word
[51:40] submission to be submissive in spirit
[51:42] you have to have a submissive spirit in
[51:44] everybody for a family to
[51:48] work if family is taught to question and
[51:51] buck the system the Oneness will break
[51:56] and you
[51:57] can't uh teach children to Buck the
[52:01] system and expect them to obey
[52:05] you just doesn't work that
[52:08] way you can't run against the authority
[52:11] of God's word or the authorities God's
[52:14] placed in in in place and expect your
[52:17] children to follow that
[52:20] image because you got to have an image
[52:22] of disobedience in
[52:24] daddy can't have it something will have
[52:27] to break something will have to split up
[52:29] because you can't have that image and
[52:31] then he demands obedience from the
[52:32] family it doesn't work that way how many
[52:35] men sometimes Brothers have I had to
[52:37] tell that you can't demand obedience for
[52:40] you can't demand obedience from your
[52:42] family God doesn't demand it from you
[52:46] it's the spirit of obedience that starts
[52:48] with Daddy
[52:49] first and then you will see your family
[52:52] learn and catch the image of obedience
[52:56] it's the way it works and so a
[52:58] submissive family if a family is taught
[52:59] to question about the system it'll break
[53:01] Oneness we still ask what is it that
[53:04] they are first obedient to not just to
[53:06] one another it has to be by Spirit it
[53:09] has to be a reverence that family has to
[53:12] have a reverence everyone from Daddy
[53:14] down has to have a reverence for another
[53:17] being that's around or another Spirit
[53:19] they're accountable to besides their own
[53:23] spirits that whole family has to have a
[53:26] reverence of God that there's another
[53:29] being around there's another spirit that
[53:31] is welcome in the home that they are all
[53:34] obedient to can you say amen amen they
[53:38] have to be all obedient to something one
[53:40] thing can you say amen and so if that's
[53:43] not there you can't have Oneness and so
[53:45] it's not just obedience to one another
[53:47] it has to be by the spirit it has to be
[53:49] a reverence for and an accountability to
[53:52] uh something greater than themselves
[53:54] that's there Christ and I'll call it
[53:56] what it is Christ and his word because
[53:58] we establish our families upon the word
[54:00] but it's not just the written word it's
[54:02] the spirit with the word it's the spirit
[54:04] that wrote the word Christ is the spirit
[54:05] that wrote the word Christ is the
[54:07] presence we need in our lives Christ is
[54:09] the presence we need in our homes right
[54:12] Christ should be the dominant president
[54:13] that leads he should be the Shepherd
[54:15] that leads our homes amen and that's the
[54:18] reverent spirit that we offer to that
[54:20] that submissive Spirit to that
[54:22] submissive Spirit to his holy spirit
[54:25] that begins to form that obedience that
[54:28] begins to form the Oneness that we're
[54:30] talking about in the Garden of Eden
[54:32] praise the Lord so I got to move on here
[54:34] so submit yourselves and and it does say
[54:37] in Ephesians 5 to submit yourself one to
[54:39] another how many knows it says that
[54:41] husbands wives the body of Christ submit
[54:44] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[54:48] God Amen so there is a submitting to one
[54:51] another but there is no way that that
[54:53] works in a church I guarantee to you
[54:55] unless those people are submissive to
[54:58] the Holy Ghost in their
[55:00] lives it's only you have submission to
[55:03] one another true submission to one
[55:04] another when you have people that are
[55:06] submissive to the Holy Ghost and have
[55:08] the Holy Ghost in their lives you have a
[55:11] lack of the Holy Ghost and a l lack of
[55:13] submission to it don't you ever try to
[55:15] micromanage people submitting to one
[55:18] another because they in their nature I
[55:20] ain't in my nature I ain't submitting to
[55:23] nobody and you ain't going to submit to
[55:24] nobody
[55:25] especially the person sitting next to me
[55:27] they're not going to tell me what to
[55:30] do that's why I asked the question and
[55:32] if First Corinthians 1 Paul said that we
[55:35] all there to be no divisions among us
[55:37] and that we all speak the same thing I
[55:38] brought it up to the brothers a few
[55:39] months ago heard a lot of good things
[55:42] from the brothers but I I tell you I
[55:44] I'll give you my answer to it there is
[55:45] no way that you can all be on the same
[55:47] page and all speak the same thing and I
[55:50] said to somebody a few weeks ago that is
[55:51] the goal of the Holy Ghost fi church
[55:53] that we eventually all speak the same
[55:56] thing seems impossible in the world we
[55:58] live in seems impossible with people
[56:00] feeding on the internet and the wisdom
[56:02] of the world so much on now and if you
[56:04] feed on that you're headed in the other
[56:06] direction of a goal of a Holy Ghost
[56:08] Church to all speak the same thing it's
[56:11] when we all speak the same thing and
[56:12] I'll tell you it comes by one thing and
[56:14] that's by the Holy Ghost God if that's
[56:18] the goal of the Holy Ghost and that's
[56:19] the goal of the church then the Holy
[56:21] Ghost will bring it to
[56:23] pass and if you still think it's
[56:25] impossible you just need to begin to
[56:27] believe it's possible not by human
[56:29] beings putting it together but by the
[56:31] Holy Ghost bringing people and people
[56:33] submitting to the Holy Ghost under the
[56:34] fear of God that they all speak the same
[56:38] thing amen it's our
[56:41] goal
[56:45] so now here's the next thing he says I
[56:48] didn't realize this would take so long
[56:49] tonight I'm going to have to finish this
[56:50] another Wednesday here I was hoping to
[56:53] be done with the Oneness part but he
[56:55] says here now a good obedient family so
[56:57] we covered obedience you need to write
[56:59] that down you need to remember that in
[57:00] your heart we're talking about Oneness
[57:02] being the goal of a family a blessed
[57:04] family and part of that Oneness number
[57:06] one is
[57:07] obedience obedience to some to to Christ
[57:11] and the word in the home that's an
[57:13] agreement can you say amen and so then
[57:16] he says and if there's something in the
[57:19] family that moves them apart no notice
[57:22] how General that is something that comes
[57:25] in the family that moves them apart now
[57:28] I could expand on that so many
[57:34] ways because you all have learned as
[57:37] Christians the
[57:39] something that little something or big
[57:42] something whatever influence it is you
[57:46] discover it's moving the family
[57:50] apart it could be an uncle it could be
[57:54] an aunt
[57:55] it could be that the husband has been
[57:57] influenced by the things of the world
[57:59] the husband becomes addicted to
[58:01] pornography and now all of a sudden
[58:04] something has moved to move the family
[58:07] apart and the family's going what's
[58:08] going on the wife's going on what's
[58:10] going wrong what's going wrong it's
[58:11] because something has moved in to tear
[58:15] the family
[58:16] apart and that's what brother Brown's
[58:18] saying and a lot of times the rest of
[58:20] the family has to feel the guilt about
[58:22] it if a wife messes up she commits
[58:25] adultery or something like that then the
[58:26] rest of the family has to feel the feel
[58:28] the guilty feel guilty about it but a
[58:30] lot of times it's Satan that's worked on
[58:31] that one person to break up the family
[58:34] right and the rest of the family has to
[58:36] feel guilt about it what a shame that's
[58:37] that that's how the devil works but you
[58:40] see now something moves in there it may
[58:43] not be an adultery it might be just an
[58:45] addiction to pornography it might be
[58:47] somebody started to ring the read the
[58:49] wrong books and those wrong books
[58:51] brought a wrong spirit in the home you
[58:53] don't tell it for two three weeks down
[58:54] the road but all of a sudden now you're
[58:56] dealing with spirits in the homes
[58:58] yeah he says something something moves
[59:03] in to move the family
[59:06] apart and see that's if he says it that
[59:09] way then that's if we're shooting for
[59:11] Oneness we all have to stay prayed up we
[59:14] have to stay in the spirit and stay
[59:17] prayed up teenagers and parents alike
[59:20] stay in tune with God to keep the
[59:23] Oneness going right because all of us
[59:26] are susceptible to let something come
[59:29] into us that would break up the
[59:33] family if something in the family moves
[59:35] them apart then it's not right and that
[59:37] family's broken somewhere at some level
[59:40] the family unit and Oneness becomes
[59:42] broken it may be at a very very light
[59:45] level and you can't even recognize it
[59:49] but you better pray because the smallest
[59:51] little things these days it seems like
[59:54] has the agenda to break up marriages to
[59:56] break up families to break children from
[59:59] their parents children are to be one
[1:00:01] with their parents parents are to be one
[1:00:04] with their children right and anything
[1:00:07] something that comes into your life
[1:00:09] young person that breaks the Oneness I
[1:00:12] told one young girl that that was
[1:00:13] getting ready to get married I said she
[1:00:16] was kind of not as close to her mom
[1:00:18] during the last few months of the
[1:00:19] marriage and I said do you really want
[1:00:21] that I said and I I gave it to her
[1:00:23] straight I said listen
[1:00:25] how can you really come into was Oneness
[1:00:27] with your husband when you're going to
[1:00:28] leave a household when you weren't in
[1:00:30] Oneness with your parents some
[1:00:32] situations you're not able to be fully
[1:00:33] one because they're not Believers but in
[1:00:35] this it wasn't the case is that how are
[1:00:38] you going to go in to Oneness with your
[1:00:40] husband perfectly when you're not one
[1:00:42] with your mom when there's walls up
[1:00:44] between you and your mom deal with that
[1:00:46] first and take care this is your this is
[1:00:48] the best time to deal with it get as
[1:00:50] close to your mom as you can yeah
[1:00:53] because that's practice for getting
[1:00:54] close to this
[1:00:57] guy people think if I can just get away
[1:01:00] if I can just get out of this house I
[1:01:01] can just get married get married get
[1:01:02] married I'll be one with my husband and
[1:01:04] all my troubles will be all
[1:01:08] over my problem is my parents and if I
[1:01:11] can get out of the house it'll solve all
[1:01:13] the problems not if you've got a problem
[1:01:16] with obedience right and
[1:01:18] Oneness it's going to be bad oh not the
[1:01:22] first two years it'll be glorious the
[1:01:23] first two years
[1:01:25] but then all that that that's laying
[1:01:28] there dormant will come back up again
[1:01:31] and the image that you left on of your
[1:01:34] parents you'll transmit as being the
[1:01:36] image of how you look at your husband
[1:01:39] and you look at your wife because image
[1:01:40] is more powerful than what's taught you
[1:01:42] were in church all your life and knew
[1:01:43] the right way to be a wife and husband
[1:01:45] but if the image is wrong in your heart
[1:01:46] you're going to do the wrong
[1:01:48] thing so what do we do we do like Josiah
[1:01:51] said Lord let me stomp on the idols and
[1:01:53] images that are wrong in my life my life
[1:01:55] you know that's what Josiah did he went
[1:01:57] into the temple and destroyed all the
[1:01:58] false images and idols and stomped them
[1:02:00] to dust that's what Christians need to
[1:02:03] do Lord deliver me from all the false
[1:02:06] images in my mind and how I think about
[1:02:09] things that's
[1:02:10] wrong not going to get through this here
[1:02:12] tonight I'm looking for a place to end
[1:02:14] but we realize that there's something
[1:02:16] that comes in that breaks up the family
[1:02:18] somewhere something foreign to what is
[1:02:20] the standard comes in here's the
[1:02:22] standard but something foreign and
[1:02:24] sneaks its way in and that thing moves
[1:02:26] that family apart slowly but surely
[1:02:29] moves that thing I'm going to say to you
[1:02:32] as a
[1:02:33] pastor a few months ago or last year
[1:02:36] when we had some of these influences on
[1:02:38] the internet believe the sign and these
[1:02:40] different things coming on and playing
[1:02:42] into um the uh Factor here I'm going to
[1:02:46] say to you as a pastor the lord gave me
[1:02:49] instruction what to say that the CH to
[1:02:51] the church about it and what to do and
[1:02:53] how to handle it and how to keep
[1:02:54] yourself from the tents of those and
[1:02:56] those websites and that's what I gave as
[1:02:59] as uh the what God told me to tell this
[1:03:02] church on how to deal with it you of
[1:03:04] course have a choice that what what you
[1:03:06] want to do but I'm I'm here to tell you
[1:03:09] those things are more potent than what
[1:03:11] you realize right and I'm telling you if
[1:03:13] you give into those images it's starting
[1:03:16] to destroy families and Destroy
[1:03:18] marriages yes isn't that interesting
[1:03:20] something doctrinal something that
[1:03:22] that's just a a just a question could
[1:03:24] actually have that eventual effect we're
[1:03:26] starting to see
[1:03:28] that
[1:03:32] so I just encourage you that if God
[1:03:36] sends a a word through the local
[1:03:40] Ministry of how we handle it I encourage
[1:03:42] you to be obedient to it right right
[1:03:45] because that's that's no longer Paul of
[1:03:47] Fontaine that's the Lord trying to
[1:03:49] protect you from something that can
[1:03:51] destroy your marriages and
[1:03:53] Families
[1:03:55] amen didn't intend on saying that but I
[1:03:56] just wanted to encourage you in that
[1:03:59] because we're we're Ser we're anything
[1:04:01] anything foreign that comes in that
[1:04:03] doesn't end up being the word of God
[1:04:04] that's why I emphasize and brother B
[1:04:06] says he says take what I'm preaching to
[1:04:09] you take what I'm preaching and sit down
[1:04:12] and prayerfully and consider it with the
[1:04:14] Bible and prayerfully consider these
[1:04:16] things and see if it balances out with
[1:04:18] the word of God he's challenging you to
[1:04:20] do that because why in this day we
[1:04:23] better make sure it's word based we
[1:04:25] better make sure that it doesn't come
[1:04:27] from the mind of some someone that's not
[1:04:29] word-based and something that's not
[1:04:31] shooting from from that source that is
[1:04:33] for sure so we must be in agreement with
[1:04:37] it and that's the key we would think
[1:04:39] that we'd all be in agreement with one
[1:04:41] another but the only way we can be in
[1:04:43] agreement with one another in a family
[1:04:46] it's not that our minds agree on
[1:04:48] everything but there's a spirit and
[1:04:50] there's a word that we follow in the
[1:04:52] family that we all agree with there's
[1:04:55] something greater than ourselves in this
[1:04:58] family unit daddy sets up the home as to
[1:05:01] what the absolute is as being God's word
[1:05:04] and we're all in agreement that there is
[1:05:07] an absolute that we follow God's word
[1:05:09] and if there's a question that comes up
[1:05:11] we're going to pray about it we're going
[1:05:13] to we're going to find the answer we're
[1:05:15] going to we're going to follow God's
[1:05:17] precepts in the closest way that we can
[1:05:20] and we're all going to be in agreement
[1:05:22] with that approach to life
[1:05:25] that's a family that can be
[1:05:28] blessed because it's not that we agree
[1:05:30] with another one another on every every
[1:05:32] point it's not getting the minds to
[1:05:34] agree with a certain
[1:05:36] person it's getting our minds to agree
[1:05:38] that there is an absolute and we all
[1:05:39] follow that absolutely right daddy
[1:05:41] included
[1:05:43] yeah because I want to get to the next
[1:05:45] section which I I'm going to close now
[1:05:47] but the next section says the only way
[1:05:50] that they should be that they could be
[1:05:52] one with the family or with God was
[1:05:55] because God's nature was in them talking
[1:05:58] about Adam and Eve the only way they
[1:06:00] could be one with the family or with God
[1:06:01] was God's nature was in them so that
[1:06:04] made them with God's nature in them then
[1:06:06] with each other and God they became one
[1:06:09] isn't that a beautiful picture God in
[1:06:10] the family father overall Supreme no
[1:06:13] death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing
[1:06:15] just joy unspeakable never to be sick
[1:06:18] never have a heartache just one with God
[1:06:20] what a picture because the very nature
[1:06:22] of God was in these people people and
[1:06:24] therefore what they did they followed
[1:06:26] just in line with God and God with them
[1:06:30] made them one so now you see how
[1:06:32] difficult it is with just trying to have
[1:06:34] a family with no Holy Ghost
[1:06:36] there no nature of God there trying to
[1:06:39] be one with a things of the word without
[1:06:40] the nature of the word without having
[1:06:42] the same nature he said the only way
[1:06:44] they could be one is to have the same
[1:06:45] nature of God in of God in them so you
[1:06:49] can struggle all you want to try to to
[1:06:51] do things to have a family and we will
[1:06:54] talk about some other elements of the
[1:06:56] family that get lost sometimes and
[1:06:58] that's laughing together being able to
[1:07:00] have a good time connecting emotionally
[1:07:02] all those things are are very important
[1:07:05] but if you had all of that you don't
[1:07:06] have a structured Solid Rock Family unit
[1:07:10] unless you have Oneness with God and
[1:07:12] Oneness comes because you're the same
[1:07:13] nature with God you have the same Holy
[1:07:16] Spirit living in you and you're praying
[1:07:18] for that same Holy Spirit in your
[1:07:20] children because we all agree that
[1:07:22] nature Made Them agree agree with him
[1:07:25] and agree with his word can you say
[1:07:27] Amen so he's saying it's it's almost it
[1:07:31] he's saying it's not possible to have it
[1:07:33] any other way it's not possible to have
[1:07:35] a people without his nature living in
[1:07:38] them and to be able to come in full
[1:07:40] Oneness as a family in agreement with
[1:07:42] what with God's word there's no way to
[1:07:43] properly do it unless we pray and say
[1:07:45] Lord put your nature within
[1:07:48] me that's a tough thing because we got
[1:07:50] our own nature that's right there too
[1:07:52] got our own personality
[1:07:54] but when the Holy Ghost comes in there's
[1:07:56] something stronger within you that
[1:07:58] agrees with the word of God when that
[1:08:01] young person gets the whole picture
[1:08:03] changes when that young person really
[1:08:05] gets the holy spirit in their life
[1:08:06] because even though they still got their
[1:08:07] own personality and even though
[1:08:09] sometimes they're still young and might
[1:08:11] be a little immature just a
[1:08:14] tad they've got the Holy Ghost and they
[1:08:17] live by that it'll be stronger and it'll
[1:08:20] agree with God's
[1:08:21] word and you'll have more Oneness that
[1:08:23] way than trying to do it mechanically
[1:08:26] through the head it takes his nature
[1:08:28] within us that's why we pray for our
[1:08:30] children to get the Holy Ghost that's
[1:08:32] why we pray that we receive the Holy
[1:08:33] Ghost right because that's the answer to
[1:08:35] True Oneness yes never can fully have it
[1:08:39] now as I've said in the past if somebody
[1:08:41] will respect the Holy Ghost and respect
[1:08:43] God's ways even if they disagreed with
[1:08:44] it there's a blessing sometimes that
[1:08:46] goes with that I've seen families
[1:08:47] blessed just because the daddy and momy
[1:08:49] mommy or the unbeliever respects the
[1:08:52] word enough an unbeliever in uh husband
[1:08:55] can live with an unbelieving a believing
[1:08:57] husband can live with an unbelieving
[1:08:58] wife the Bible
[1:09:00] says it can happen because of his
[1:09:02] respect or her respect for the word of
[1:09:04] God it can happen but there has to be
[1:09:07] respect best Oneness is to have that
[1:09:10] whole family no matter what they are if
[1:09:12] it's a single mom raising kids whatever
[1:09:14] it is if they can come one and and their
[1:09:17] nature can be one with God and they can
[1:09:19] come in line in harmony with God's word
[1:09:21] the melody if they can come in harmony
[1:09:23] with that that even their family without
[1:09:25] all the units there they can be one with
[1:09:28] God and one with one another I do
[1:09:31] believe that with all my heart let's
[1:09:32] Stand Together God bless
[1:09:36] you a lot of young people here and I
[1:09:39] pray that these young men and young
[1:09:41] women are listening because you're going
[1:09:42] to have a family someday probably sooner
[1:09:44] than you
[1:09:45] think you're going to get married you're
[1:09:47] going to have a family you ought to pray
[1:09:49] and say Lord let me have a family that's
[1:09:51] Oneness with one with God let me have
[1:09:53] have a family that's blessed of God not
[1:09:55] just another family but someone that
[1:09:57] really reflects what true Oneness is and
[1:10:00] how how many of us that have families
[1:10:02] you want to come in Oneness with God
[1:10:03] that way amen I want to reflect in my
[1:10:06] family we're certainly not perfect not
[1:10:08] the perfect family I can tell you that
[1:10:10] right away but I'll tell you we have a
[1:10:14] token we have the Holy
[1:10:16] Spirit through that we can be the family
[1:10:20] that God wants us to be and you can be
[1:10:21] the family that God wants you to be can
[1:10:23] you say Amen praise the lord we have a
[1:10:25] family song Raj I don't think we do we
[1:10:28] need to write
[1:10:30] one amen let's pray first and he'll
[1:10:32] think of something to sing
[1:10:34] there just humble our hearts just now
[1:10:37] just bow your heads and just speak to
[1:10:38] the Lord and often when we preach these
[1:10:42] things we think of the elements that are
[1:10:44] missing in our family where it could be
[1:10:48] better and so all all we can do is Lay
[1:10:50] those things before the Throne of God
[1:10:52] tonight say Lord I I lay them before you
[1:10:55] if I'm not being the person that's
[1:10:57] agreeable with your word and I'm being
[1:11:00] the problem Lord help me not to be the
[1:11:02] problem help me not to be a part of the
[1:11:04] problem help me to be a part of the
[1:11:07] solution help me to be so submissive to
[1:11:10] your
[1:11:11] spirit that I would give my life holy to
[1:11:15] you to make my
[1:11:17] family a a a family of unity a family of
[1:11:22] Peace family of real genuine love
