[0:00] foreign
[0:09] God bless you all right I didn't have
[0:11] the blue screen of death on my computer
[0:13] but it wasn't acting up so we'll just
[0:15] give it a minute to restart
[0:16] and while we're waiting and standing
[0:19] perhaps we can just turn in our Bibles
[0:20] to the Book of Revelation
[0:23] chapter two
[0:36] just roll doing well middle of our work
[0:39] week and thank the Lord we're
[0:42] healthy and able to be here there's a
[0:44] lot of sickness going around my goodness
[0:57] so by his grace this evening I'd like to
[0:59] begin speaking about the pergamian
[1:02] church age
[1:04] and um
[1:07] I wanted to give a little bit of a
[1:08] historical background and then
[1:12] take a little thought about uh about
[1:15] faith living by his faith
[1:18] let's see here we're almost there
[1:26] yep all right
[1:28] Revelation Chapter 2 and verse 12.
[1:31] and to the angel of the church in
[1:33] pergamus right these things said he
[1:36] which hath the sharp sword with two
[1:38] edges
[1:39] he says I Know Thy works and where they
[1:41] are dwellest even where Satan's seat is
[1:44] and that's what it can emphasize uh
[1:47] that's a how how Christ is describing
[1:50] this pergamian church it's Satan's seat
[1:53] this is not this is a president talks
[1:55] about the modern day being Satan's Eden
[1:57] pilgrims has talked about being Satan's
[2:00] seat this is where these Believers had
[2:01] to live in Satan's seat
[2:04] and you and yet you hold fast my name
[2:06] and have not denied my faith even in
[2:09] those days where an antipast was my
[2:11] faithful martyr who was slain among you
[2:13] where Satan dwelleth again emphasizing
[2:16] Satan's seat where Satan's dwelling of
[2:19] the churches where um Christ wants to be
[2:21] dwelling and Satan has gotten this
[2:23] figured out so well that now he is
[2:25] dwelling in the very place where Christ
[2:27] should sit in the throne
[2:29] but I have a few so he's saying uh
[2:32] um you've got really really tough
[2:34] circumstances
[2:36] um and you're still living for me great
[2:39] that's that's wonderful because I have a
[2:40] few things still against you because you
[2:42] have there them that hold the doctrine
[2:44] of Balaam who taught balak to cast a
[2:47] stumbling block before the children of
[2:49] Israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[2:51] idols and commit fornication and you
[2:54] also have them and that hold the
[2:55] doctrine of the Nicolaitans which thing
[2:57] I hate repent or else I will come unto
[3:00] thee quickly and will fight against them
[3:01] with the sword of my mouth he that hath
[3:04] an ear let them hear what the spirit of
[3:06] sat into the churches to him that
[3:08] overcometh will I give to each of the
[3:10] Hidden Manna and will give him a white
[3:11] stone and in this Stone the new name
[3:14] written which no man knows saving he
[3:16] that receiveth it
[3:18] and not just pray
[3:20] Heavenly Father we just ask your
[3:21] blessing upon your word this evening
[3:24] lord it's been the been the busy day for
[3:26] all of us and how easy it is when we get
[3:29] relaxed in the warm building we can just
[3:31] get to get tired and Lord I pray
[3:34] nonetheless that you would just take
[3:37] control of me this evening Lord help me
[3:38] to get out of the way father but you
[3:40] might Minister something of of Grace and
[3:42] of help Lord to each one of us we are
[3:45] struggling and then battling in some way
[3:47] Satan's got a Punch coming to each one
[3:49] of us Lord and it can be difficult the
[3:51] battle can be draining I pray Lord that
[3:53] in some way that you would just give
[3:54] encouragement to each one in the name of
[3:57] the Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you
[4:00] may be seated
[4:04] so I'll just do a little bit of a little
[4:06] bit of a review a little bit of a
[4:07] historical background and then talk
[4:09] about how um
[4:11] some of a couple of things that the Lord
[4:14] speaks to the Believers of pergamus how
[4:18] they're able to live uh for God in this
[4:21] place where Satan's dwelling where
[4:23] Satan's seat is how can they live for
[4:26] God nonetheless we'll just say one thing
[4:29] that's there's no way that we can be
[4:30] Overcomers today or they could be
[4:32] Overcomers in their day living by their
[4:35] own faith or By Their Own Strength it's
[4:37] only by his faith any of them or any of
[4:40] us have a chance at overcoming
[4:42] so again the seven letters uh in
[4:46] Revelation two and three that John is
[4:48] writing
[4:50] um transcribing for uh for his for for
[4:53] Christ
[4:54] um these are written to seven different
[4:56] churches in Asia Minor and these
[4:58] churches have uh characteristics that
[5:01] are going to be coming up in future
[5:02] Church ages and chapter
[5:04] um in in the future centuries in the
[5:07] Revelation chapter 1 calls this book a
[5:10] word of Prophecy so it's it's very it's
[5:13] it's a very good interpretation you see
[5:15] that this is not just uh these letters
[5:17] not just for the time of John's writing
[5:19] it's for the future Church ages to come
[5:23] so we've talked about the Ephesus and
[5:25] Smyrna and then that they will be
[5:27] looking at pergamis or their brand name
[5:28] identified the time period being from
[5:30] 312 to 606 and he identified a man named
[5:34] Martin of Tours as being the um church
[5:38] as being the angel of the Church of
[5:40] Smyrna or the messenger to that age and
[5:43] I think it's nice to put a picture of
[5:46] these uh Brothers up I started typing it
[5:48] in there I almost put in their Saint
[5:50] Martin of tourists that no I shouldn't
[5:52] put Brother Martin of Tours because all
[5:55] of these are very catholicized images if
[5:58] we ever hear about cultural
[5:59] expropriation it's one of those nice
[6:01] woke terms today how you had to rename
[6:03] the Cleveland Indians because here we
[6:06] have all these white people I have all
[6:07] kind of be careful what I say and they
[6:09] have all kinds of people trying to
[6:11] profit off of a Native American tribe
[6:14] who was uh who uh was handled very
[6:17] unfairly by the people who are now
[6:19] profiting from them well you could look
[6:21] at whenever the Catholics are taking
[6:23] these Saints and men and women of the
[6:25] past and calling them saints I think
[6:27] it's almost cultural expropriation
[6:29] because these are brothers and sisters
[6:31] who believe the truth and they're being
[6:33] pushed into this other mold into the
[6:35] Halo behind and say these were Catholics
[6:36] so they weren't
[6:38] um but Martin of tourists I'm not going
[6:40] to read I'm not going to read anything
[6:41] about him this evening if there's a
[6:43] better Brandon shares some testimonies
[6:45] about what God accomplished in his life
[6:48] he's pictured as a soldier because
[6:50] um it said that he's as he's going
[6:53] through the city as a soldier he he
[6:55] shares his cloak with the beggar man one
[6:57] evening and that and that night Christ
[7:00] comes to him in a dream
[7:02] and uh and he um and he calls him and
[7:06] then and Martin responds and that was a
[7:08] a transforming uh moment in his life but
[7:11] the
[7:12] um his life was characterized by the by
[7:14] the supernatural
[7:15] and he and he lit um
[7:18] um the fire for for the further Church
[7:20] there and and Tours France at that time
[7:23] period
[7:25] I want to take a look this evening
[7:27] um as we look at the history how did the
[7:30] church get to be this in in the spot
[7:32] where they're called Satan's seat where
[7:35] Satan himself dwelleth because this is
[7:38] quite uh quite a slide away from the
[7:41] book of Acts where the Holy Spirit comes
[7:44] down and Pentecost and the true church
[7:46] is founded how does this happen
[7:48] and
[7:50] um if you I don't have this on this
[7:51] slide if it's at the very front page of
[7:53] the notes
[7:55] in Acts chapter 18 there is something
[7:57] referred to um Paul has leaves Athens
[8:01] and he comes to Corinth and he says he
[8:03] found a certain Jew there named Aquila
[8:05] born in pontus lately come into come
[8:09] from Italy with his wife Priscilla this
[8:11] is where Paul makes acquaintance with
[8:13] Aquila and Priscilla and he says they've
[8:15] lately come from Italy and they uh so
[8:17] they they're coming from Rome
[8:19] why did they just come from Rome why are
[8:22] they leaving Italy well um after the
[8:26] persecution in the early church there
[8:28] around Jerusalem other places Jews left
[8:31] Jerusalem believing Jews left Jerusalem
[8:33] as a scatter all over the Empire within
[8:36] a few years some of them even make it so
[8:38] far as Rome the capital city of the
[8:41] Empire and they actually establish a
[8:44] small Church there now Paul writes
[8:46] letters to them and he talks about
[8:48] um
[8:50] a genius Andrew Nyquist who Apostles
[8:53] helped found the church there in Rome so
[8:55] there was a small Church there in Rome
[8:57] that was founded however
[8:59] um in about 80 36
[9:02] um
[9:03] um that church has established and it
[9:05] goes there for several years but I think
[9:08] the Roman has one of the Roman
[9:10] historians talks about how they were
[9:11] altercations but the Roman authorities
[9:14] didn't like the the Jewish and and the
[9:16] Christians being there in the capital
[9:17] and one Emperor Claudius bans them from
[9:21] the capitol
[9:22] so who would have been the the um the
[9:25] most knowledgeable stable Christians at
[9:27] the time well it would have been the
[9:28] ones who brought the gospel who had
[9:31] probably been Jews so now this this
[9:33] church has just been around for a few
[9:35] years and Claudius bans the Jews from
[9:39] the capitol so this church is losing its
[9:42] seasoned leadership Aquila and Priscilla
[9:45] and others and brother Branham talks
[9:47] about this in the church age book in
[9:49] page 209
[9:51] it says with the Jews banished from the
[9:53] city the backbone of that little church
[9:55] was practically broken
[9:57] perhaps even the elders had been Jewish
[10:00] and so would be gone the flock would be
[10:02] unattended and since the word had not
[10:04] been written as a guide it'd be very
[10:07] easy for this little flock to drift or
[10:09] be inundated by the philosophers and
[10:11] pagans of that day and he says we find
[10:14] from history that this little church in
[10:16] Rome became hopelessly backslidden and
[10:19] began to introduce Pagan's ceremonies
[10:21] under Christian titles in this time of
[10:23] banishment lasted for 13 years
[10:26] and this was the first church of Rome
[10:29] and the devil sees us as a prime
[10:31] opportunity if I could get in here this
[10:34] is the First Church of Rome and I can
[10:36] get influence in the leadership and I
[10:39] can start blending paganism and idolatry
[10:41] together what an opportunity this is
[10:44] It's almost like a hacker comes in here
[10:47] and takes over your channel and is now
[10:50] sending out your as if you're being your
[10:53] Instagram Channel everybody expecting
[10:54] your family pictures to come hacker
[10:57] comes in and starts broadcasting
[10:58] something else
[10:59] that's a very jarring experience my wife
[11:01] had her Instagram hacked back in August
[11:03] and all of a sudden weird things just
[11:05] kind of coming out of it you've lost all
[11:07] control over your channel well that's
[11:09] kind of what the devil's hoping to
[11:11] accomplish as he takes over this first
[11:13] church in Rome but the title page is
[11:15] still first like the crook family
[11:17] Instagram all kinds of things to be
[11:19] going out of there with my picture on
[11:21] there my kids pictures on there and
[11:23] they're like we stand behind that that's
[11:24] the kind of public relations coup the
[11:28] devil hopes to accomplish by this first
[11:30] church in Rome
[11:34] so um after this time of banishment is
[11:37] is over is time of banishment lasted 13
[11:40] years just imagine a young Church been
[11:43] around for two or three years and then
[11:45] all the deacons all the Ministries gone
[11:48] what can this is the Devil's Playground
[11:51] we have some sincere young believers and
[11:54] he's just going to go in there and have
[11:56] his time or after the time of banishment
[11:58] is uh is passed Junius andronicus come
[12:02] back in 54 A.D and brother Branham has
[12:05] imagined their horror to find a church
[12:08] with a Christian title for Christian
[12:11] Church's room and he walks in there and
[12:14] he sees nothing Chris well you might see
[12:16] like imagine like a like a little
[12:18] message first you see brother Brandon's
[12:20] picture there and you see brother a
[12:22] different brother is from the West you
[12:23] might have supported it and you've got
[12:25] Brother Paul's picture there in the
[12:26] corner but different other ones and he
[12:28] comes in and he sees nothing else that's
[12:30] good but I'm associated with this
[12:33] that's what had happened
[12:34] they they see a courage with a Christian
[12:36] title that's woefully Pagan there were
[12:39] altars in the church
[12:41] but they placed incense on it celebrated
[12:43] Pagan rights the established leaders of
[12:46] the church couldn't be approached they
[12:48] had these established should just have
[12:50] something good going now this is a money
[12:52] Mill for them they're not going to be
[12:53] approached by Junius and Andrew nikus
[12:55] they don't want anything to do with the
[12:57] true gospel anymore so Andrew nycus and
[13:00] Junior start a second Church the second
[13:04] Church of Rome now when you look at two
[13:06] churches on the street you see the First
[13:07] Church of Rome the second Church of Rome
[13:09] which one probably is the better
[13:11] pedigree the one that goes back to the
[13:13] original gospel you think it would be
[13:15] the First Church of Rome and that's what
[13:17] the devil wants as well and again go to
[13:18] the First Church of Rome that's the
[13:20] original that's what we got going and
[13:22] that's what the devil still wants people
[13:24] to think today but when they establish
[13:26] this new church this second Church of
[13:29] Rome that's where God started working
[13:31] and the devil does everything he can to
[13:33] distract people from the true work and
[13:36] gets them to think this is how God this
[13:38] is where God really should be operating
[13:41] and just think how does how does God do
[13:43] things he he comes and operates by grace
[13:47] through faith these are the key words of
[13:49] how how the Holy Spirit operates in our
[13:51] lives
[13:52] what does the devil have a chance now to
[13:54] do to twist
[13:57] the way God works twist our
[13:59] understanding of how God wants to work
[14:01] because he took over God's Institute the
[14:04] devil took over Christ's Instagram
[14:05] Channel they're in the first church he's
[14:08] sending out all kinds of messages to
[14:10] twist their understanding of what the
[14:12] gospel is really like
[14:14] well this First Church of Rome grows in
[14:17] numbers it becomes
[14:20] um some big enough for the government to
[14:22] notice it and they do everything they
[14:25] can't turn the government against the
[14:27] second Church to turn the government
[14:28] against the True Believers because the
[14:30] True Believers are a thorn in their side
[14:33] and brother Branham talks about how even
[14:36] the polycarp heard that the First
[14:39] Christian Church of Rome was involved in
[14:41] the such paganism and had corrupted the
[14:43] truth of the Gospel that he went there
[14:44] to implore them to change
[14:47] but it was to uh to no avail he says he
[14:50] saw them light candles and burned
[14:52] incense on the altar he saw them
[14:54] celebrate the Passover under the name of
[14:56] Easter where they elevated this
[14:57] disc-shaped bread and honored the Sun
[15:00] God by saying this is really the body of
[15:02] Christ and they poured out the wine as
[15:05] an offering to the gods but this aged
[15:07] Saint who had traveled 1500 miles could
[15:10] not arrest their downward plunge and God
[15:12] spoke to him as he was leaving Ephraim
[15:14] as married to his idols LED them alone
[15:17] and polycarp never returned and this is
[15:20] how very gradually
[15:22] the Antichrist spirit is getting into
[15:24] the church and the false mind is just
[15:27] trying to put its tentacles out around
[15:29] the True Vine and just suffocate it
[15:33] the false finds turning its anger
[15:34] against the Living God by trying to kill
[15:36] the elect persecute it and uh all the
[15:39] while still claiming that they were the
[15:41] true representatives of the Lord Jesus
[15:43] Christ have wanted the fact that they
[15:45] were the original Church
[15:48] Etc
[15:49] if you look at that and the one of the
[15:51] descriptors descriptions of the
[15:53] pergamian church it talks about in
[15:55] Revelation 2 6 sorry this is the
[15:58] Ephesian Church
[15:59] it says this thou Hast that though
[16:01] hadest the Deeds of the Nicolaitans
[16:04] which I also hate already in the
[16:06] Ephesian Church age which has been in
[16:07] the time of Andrew nikus and Junior as
[16:10] his First Church of Rome is getting
[16:11] established Christ is commending the
[16:14] Ephesian church I I you hate the Deeds
[16:17] of the Nicolaitans which I also hate
[16:20] by the time the pergamian church comes
[16:23] around the Deeds have become Doctrine
[16:26] and that's not just changing word
[16:29] um because we can if we're doing things
[16:32] that are wrong in our lives these are
[16:33] these are wrong actions
[16:35] but we might not really want to try to
[16:37] talk about it too much because we know
[16:39] it's not quite right but we still
[16:40] tolerate it we still do it but when
[16:43] we're willing to defend ourselves with a
[16:45] well-reasoned defense why my actions are
[16:47] not just acceptable they're they're good
[16:49] that's when Deeds become Doctrine where
[16:52] I'm not I'm I'm tolerated the Deeds of
[16:54] Nicolaitans I'm tolerating something I
[16:56] know that really isn't right but I'm
[16:57] doing anyway and just don't spend too
[17:00] much time talking about it
[17:01] that's kind of how it wasn't Ephesus
[17:03] this wasn't official
[17:05] by the time pergamus rolls around the
[17:07] Deeds of the Nicolaitans they're wanted
[17:10] their official talking points this is
[17:13] Doctrine it's acceptable it's defensible
[17:15] and this has become a big part of the
[17:18] church
[17:23] and as as this rule as this goes on
[17:26] um
[17:27] you know the the programian church
[17:29] starts at the church age starts in 80
[17:32] um 3 12 I believe it was and this is the
[17:36] year that emperor Constantine
[17:39] um fights a particular battle at a place
[17:42] called the milvian bridge and
[17:43] Constantine is right there to the left
[17:46] of center there on this white horse
[17:48] before Constantine was the Roman emperor
[17:51] Diocletian and under him the Roman
[17:53] Empire kind of started splintering apart
[17:56] and I think there was a tetch rocket
[17:58] there were four different rulers and the
[18:00] Constantine and his rival makes inches
[18:02] were able to consolidate things under
[18:03] themselves so they were just two and
[18:05] then they have this big battle at the
[18:07] place called The milvian Bridge which
[18:09] you can see to the right
[18:10] Oh but before the battle it said the
[18:13] Constantine says he had to dream of a
[18:15] white cross
[18:17] and then he felt that this was an omen
[18:19] that if he could get the Christians to
[18:21] pray for him that God would be merciful
[18:24] to his army and they would have the
[18:26] victory so the next morning he says that
[18:28] he had all of the soldiers paint white
[18:30] crosses on their Shields and the next
[18:32] day they did have a victory in
[18:36] Constantine it was enough for him to
[18:37] become a Christian and he declared the
[18:40] persecution of the of the Christians to
[18:41] be ended
[18:43] I watched a when I taught world history
[18:45] a couple years ago I came across
[18:47] interesting History Channel
[18:49] um documentary about this particular
[18:51] battle and it turns out that Constantine
[18:54] tells this story he doesn't come up with
[18:56] the story about the crosses and
[18:58] everything like that until years later
[19:01] he comes up with a story about the about
[19:03] this Vision that he has
[19:04] right before the Council of nicaea 13
[19:07] years later when he has all the bishops
[19:09] from around from around the Empire
[19:11] coming because now that he's a Christian
[19:13] he's using Christianity as a way to
[19:16] unite his Empire but there's a
[19:18] dissension about the godhead and he
[19:20] doesn't like this dissension because
[19:22] it's hurting his political Unity so he
[19:24] wants to get everybody together but he's
[19:26] this pretty much a pagan emperor what
[19:30] does he have to pull out to get all
[19:31] these these Christian Bishops to listen
[19:33] to him well he pulls out this spiritual
[19:35] Ace card that I had a supernatural
[19:38] Vision this is what happened this is
[19:40] what we did and we got this Victory and
[19:43] that was enough to help increase his his
[19:45] credibility there
[19:46] and he uh and he and he
[19:49] um became a patron of the church there
[19:51] in Rome
[19:53] um
[19:54] he was he was supporting them
[19:56] politically he stops the he stopped the
[19:58] persecution
[19:59] an under Constantine the Pagan Roman
[20:02] Empire which had fall but which was
[20:04] which had already splintered under
[20:06] Constantine the Pagan Roman Empire is
[20:07] resurrected into a Papal Roman Empire
[20:12] and we see that
[20:14] this is the this is the image that the
[20:16] Nebuchadnezzar dreamed and Daniel
[20:19] interpreted and at the very bottom of
[20:21] the image we've got this is this is
[20:23] typing the four World kingdoms Babylon
[20:25] meets the Persians the Greeks and this
[20:27] fourth Kingdom be the Romans and as it's
[20:30] splitting into iron and clay
[20:32] it's going to this this Beast is going
[20:34] to be powerful but it's going to die and
[20:36] it's going to be resurrected to
[20:37] something else and for their brand he
[20:39] quotes um I think from Revelation 13 the
[20:43] Beast was killed it was not it then it
[20:47] rises up again and that is when
[20:49] pagodrome is killed papal Rome takes its
[20:52] place all this happens under Constantine
[20:55] he's he's breathing new life into this
[20:58] dying Roman Empire and this is an
[21:01] opportunity for
[21:04] um for for the devil Satan is now
[21:06] winning official access
[21:08] to the first church of Romans winning
[21:10] official access to the Church of Christ
[21:12] and he's able to enthrone himself in the
[21:16] temple of God he's able to be worshiped
[21:18] as God this is something he was dreaming
[21:21] of being able to do all the way back in
[21:23] the book of Isaiah Satan he wants to
[21:25] exalt himself above the stars of God he
[21:28] wants to be up on the sides of the north
[21:29] he wants to be like the most high and
[21:32] now he's actually accomplishing it here
[21:35] on the acreage on planet Earth here in
[21:39] the time of Constantine
[21:40] and he's he's enthroned himself in the
[21:43] temple of God to be worshiped as God
[21:45] himself and this is this is a a a huge
[21:49] victory for Satan so circus is called
[21:52] Satan's throne room because the first
[21:54] church in Rome is gradually becoming
[21:57] um
[21:59] um his church the Satan's Church yeah
[22:02] under the wrong name under the name of
[22:04] Christ church and state are being united
[22:06] under Constantine and this is what the
[22:09] Revelation 2 talks about being the
[22:11] doctrine of Balaam Balaam was able to
[22:13] try to get the midianites to unite with
[22:16] the with the Hebrews
[22:18] and they'd have these big feasts and
[22:20] everybody would come together it'd be
[22:21] it'd be political it'd be a good thing
[22:23] and this is what church and state does
[22:25] do under Constantine
[22:28] the Pagan Empire becomes the papal Roman
[22:31] Empire and then Satan wins access to the
[22:34] name of Christ sits and thrown to be
[22:36] worshiped and like I said this is
[22:39] this is a huge opportunity for Satan to
[22:42] mess with the Believers Minds what does
[22:46] Christ actually like because Satan is
[22:48] sitting enthroned in this new church and
[22:51] he's sitting in there acting like he's
[22:53] God and he said that he's changed all
[22:55] the symbolism he's got different priests
[22:57] he's got different ever when when in the
[23:00] Old Testament when when Moses raised up
[23:03] the Tabernacle all the symbolism was to
[23:05] point to God in a certain way all the
[23:08] sacrifices were were meant to be done a
[23:11] certain way as a lesson as a symbol as a
[23:14] type and all those things are being
[23:16] twisted and broken
[23:18] even the priesthood that's being twisted
[23:20] and broken to the false image of God can
[23:23] be given over to the people
[23:26] and when the talk about then how
[23:29] at that and that age how could the
[23:32] Believers live and overcome in that time
[23:34] and then thinking for ourselves how can
[23:37] we then also live and overcome in this
[23:40] time if Satan has access to the name of
[23:43] Christ if Satan were to be able to take
[23:44] over
[23:46] um The Message Church broadcast for a
[23:49] couple for a couple of weeks what damage
[23:50] could you do how would he be doing it
[23:52] and you think about how has he done it
[23:54] even today where people who have grown
[23:56] up in the message had wrong experiences
[23:58] about the message have a completely
[24:00] wrong image they think they hate the
[24:02] message but they hate something that
[24:04] really isn't the message that's the very
[24:06] thing that he was trying to accomplish
[24:08] in the age of pergamus he was he was
[24:11] given The False Image but making people
[24:13] think it was the True Image and they
[24:15] really have no they have no concept of
[24:17] who God actually is that's what he was
[24:20] trying to do then it's what he's doing
[24:22] now
[24:23] and one thing I want to talk look at
[24:26] um
[24:26] Satan wants to take us away from the
[24:29] Simplicity that is in Christ if he can
[24:31] make something complicated and confusing
[24:33] he'll have us Checkmate we won't even
[24:36] have we we won't even be battling him
[24:38] he'll be able to have a victory without
[24:40] actually getting his hands dirty and war
[24:43] with us
[24:44] I'm just going to take take a look back
[24:46] how how do we fight our battles how do
[24:49] we win
[24:51] um
[24:51] they're on the middle of Page Three
[24:55] Revelation Chapter 2
[24:57] um
[24:58] verse 13 Jesus says I know your Works
[25:01] where you dwell even where Satan seat is
[25:03] and you hold fast my name and that's not
[25:06] denied my faith
[25:09] and I just want when brother Bram talks
[25:11] about there's a about a one and a half
[25:13] page section in the church age book
[25:15] where he talks about thou has not denied
[25:17] my faith
[25:18] any any underscores the truth that there
[25:22] is no faith but God but my faith if you
[25:24] have any faith it's only because God
[25:27] gave it to you
[25:28] and that's something that we can get
[25:30] real confused about sometimes we think
[25:33] that we have to have faith to uh to to
[25:36] believe in God that our faith produces
[25:37] something it's not the case it's his
[25:40] faith completely
[25:42] so we just want to talk about in the
[25:43] wild the only way to live for Christ is
[25:46] by the Faith of Christ and when I look
[25:49] at this the first time years back I God
[25:53] used a couple couple ministers or
[25:55] priests on this topic and it just
[25:57] brought such a rest into my heart
[25:59] because we hear from in Hebrews chapter
[26:01] 11 that you unless you have faith you
[26:04] can't please God like wow I better make
[26:07] sure I have faith because if I don't
[26:08] have faith there's no way for me to
[26:10] please God and that can get our mind
[26:12] raising how could I even please God then
[26:14] and I just this this really brought rest
[26:16] I pray it will bring rest to you all
[26:18] heart as well
[26:19] the devil wants us to think you have to
[26:21] have having faith is something that's
[26:23] superhuman in order to have faith you
[26:25] have to be a superhero you just have to
[26:27] now you've got in order to have faith
[26:30] you have to go on a heroic Quest you
[26:32] have to draw your sword you have to slay
[26:34] the dragons you have to bring the damsel
[26:36] back when you come back what you've
[26:37] gotten that's faith we hear Brother Bear
[26:40] I'm talking about how faith is this big
[26:42] guy with with a hairy chest and there's
[26:45] a ripped with muscle that's faith and we
[26:48] think man if I've got to be all those
[26:50] things to have faith I look in the
[26:52] mirror and says man I'm a long way from
[26:55] that
[26:56] and the devil wants to think and you
[26:58] might already have faith but he's going
[27:00] to think you've got to have you got you
[27:02] have you have to look like faith in this
[27:04] glossy beautiful magazine if you don't
[27:06] have faith it looks like this you don't
[27:08] have it and if he can convince you that
[27:10] you don't have something that you might
[27:12] actually have then you won't be using
[27:15] what God gave you to fight the devil
[27:17] with and he's got it off easy and I
[27:19] think that's a big strategy of the devil
[27:22] Romans chapter 10 says the righteousness
[27:25] which is of Faith speaks on this wise
[27:27] don't say in your heart who shall Ascend
[27:30] into heaven to bring Christ down from
[27:32] above
[27:33] this is where I think this is like this
[27:34] heroic Quest idea of faith I want to
[27:37] pray so hard I can climb up the ramparts
[27:40] of heaven and fall Before the Throne of
[27:42] God and then I can get the holy spirit
[27:44] because I've prayed so hard I've made it
[27:46] there it's no that's not how Faith Works
[27:49] and don't say who shall descend into the
[27:52] deep that is to bring Christ up again
[27:53] for me I've just got to go so hard and
[27:56] fight so many battles to get God's
[27:58] attention then they'll do it for me no
[27:59] that's not what it is
[28:01] what is it he says the word is naivee
[28:04] even in my mouth and in my heart The
[28:07] Word of Faith with which we preach that
[28:09] if you will confess with your mouth the
[28:11] Lord Jesus and Shall Believe in your
[28:14] heart that God hath raised him from the
[28:15] dead Thou shalt be saved
[28:18] that's it
[28:22] it's not some superhuman kind of thing
[28:25] we have to be a superhero to have faith
[28:27] no that's not what it is at all
[28:31] Romans 9 16 is as uh so then it depends
[28:35] not on human will or exertion but on God
[28:38] who has Mercy
[28:41] Faith doesn't depend on you your
[28:45] spiritual victories and your spiritual
[28:46] battles don't depend upon your faith
[28:50] depends upon God's faith
[28:53] in the message interavailable brother
[28:55] Branham says Christianity is not
[28:57] something where you just have to beg and
[28:59] cry and plead and fast and starve and
[29:01] everything like that to get something
[29:03] certainly not then he goes on to say I'm
[29:06] not against fasting that's that's not it
[29:08] but we don't go with it at the motive
[29:10] where I just have to make myself starve
[29:12] so badly then Christ will finally see I
[29:15] need something he says no you don't do
[29:17] things by works it's by Grace God and
[29:21] Sovereign Grace and with that that
[29:24] mentality that Satan tried to get the
[29:25] pergamy in church to to to to accept if
[29:29] we could we just have to flagellate
[29:31] ourselves we'd have to do whatever we
[29:33] have to burn enough candle say enough
[29:35] prayers and then Christ will finally pay
[29:38] attention to us
[29:39] and that can that can get into our minds
[29:42] as well I could buy I just have to do so
[29:44] many things and then Christ will finally
[29:46] soften his heart toward me and give me
[29:49] what I'm asking for his but brother Ram
[29:50] says no that's not how Christianity
[29:52] works you don't do things by works it's
[29:54] by grace
[29:56] and sometimes we have the idea that
[29:58] um yes I'm saved by grace but I've got
[30:00] to be good enough to get the Holy Ghost
[30:03] that that that's false it's all Grace he
[30:07] calls you by Grace he forgives You by
[30:10] Grace he sanctifies You by Grace he
[30:12] fills you with the Holy Spirit by Grace
[30:13] he raptures You by Grace it's all Grace
[30:16] it's none of the things that we were to
[30:18] do if one as if God were one moment to
[30:20] take his hand from Office we'd fall flat
[30:23] on the ground it's all Grace
[30:28] amen Ephesians 2 8-9 where does faith
[30:31] come from for by grace are you saved
[30:33] through faith that not of yourselves it
[30:36] is the gift of God
[30:39] you didn't have faith God Gave You faith
[30:44] it's not a work such any man should
[30:46] boast
[30:48] Ephesians 3 12 in whom we have boldness
[30:51] and access with confidence by the faith
[30:54] of him
[30:56] so whose faith is it
[30:58] by the faith of him it's Christ's Faith
[31:02] he gives it to you it's you don't have
[31:04] it to begin with God gives it to you
[31:09] Philippians 3 9. not having mine own
[31:12] righteousness which is of the law but
[31:15] that which is through the Faith of
[31:18] Christ
[31:20] whose faith is it it's Christ's faith we
[31:24] don't have faith to begin with
[31:28] Hebrews 12 2 looking unto the author and
[31:31] finisher of our faith
[31:35] Jesus begins the faith he finishes the
[31:39] faith he writes the story all in between
[31:41] it it's his story the history isn't our
[31:44] story it's his story that he's doing in
[31:47] US
[31:48] Galatians 2 16 knowing that the man is
[31:52] not justified by The Works of the law
[31:54] but by the faith of
[31:56] Jesus Christ
[31:59] even we have believed in Jesus Christ
[32:01] that we might be justified by the Faith
[32:04] of Christ it's all his faith
[32:08] all his faith and sometimes we can I
[32:10] think we can be like Winnie the Pooh
[32:12] sometimes the Winnie the puhi he goes
[32:14] off and and he has he has a problem and
[32:17] he and if when he has a problem he just
[32:19] goes I gotta think think think
[32:22] and when we get in there probably like I
[32:23] just gotta believe believe okay I gotta
[32:26] believe I gotta get this faith become a
[32:28] faith faith faith come on faith
[32:30] it's ridiculous but that's that's how
[32:32] Winnie the that we've got Winnie the
[32:34] Pooh kind of believer sometimes he's got
[32:36] a faith faith faith faith come on faith
[32:38] but that's not how it works because
[32:39] Winnie the Pooh didn't have faith in the
[32:41] faith he had something that God gave him
[32:43] and God works that faith and it's not
[32:46] Winnie the Pooh doing anything it's not
[32:47] you or me doing anything we just kind of
[32:50] relax and let Christopher Robin save the
[32:52] day or we get the idea it's all by the
[32:56] Faith of Christ
[32:59] my brethren have not the faith
[33:02] who's faith
[33:03] of our Lord Jesus Christ you don't have
[33:07] your own faith
[33:08] any faith you have it's given to you by
[33:11] the Lord Jesus
[33:13] and what the scripture that brother bran
[33:15] uses had never seen this scripture that
[33:18] I was reading in the church age book
[33:20] that's why I recommend getting in that
[33:22] book yourselves because there's all it's
[33:25] it's we talk about we sometimes one of
[33:28] the the big barriers to entry of the
[33:29] church age book or something it's all
[33:31] these deep Mysteries I won't get
[33:32] anything out of it that's wrong there is
[33:35] some there is some stuff that can be
[33:36] hard to understand but what I've got
[33:38] here this evening about faith it's in
[33:40] there this is simple this pertains to
[33:43] Everyday living it's there and I
[33:45] encourage you put your own Roots down
[33:47] and these things make it your own book
[33:50] um that that'll it'll it'll change your
[33:53] life
[33:54] but the this is Acts 3 16 Peter is
[33:57] responding
[33:58] he's sharing about this miracle it was
[34:01] just performed I think by the gate
[34:02] beautiful and Peter is saying it's not
[34:04] me it is his name through faith in his
[34:07] name hath made this man strong whomisia
[34:10] no yea the faith which is by him
[34:13] have given him this perfect soundness in
[34:16] the presence of you all so whose faith
[34:19] is it it's not Peter says it's not my
[34:21] faith it wasn't even this man's Faith
[34:24] it's the faith which is by him it's the
[34:28] Faith of Christ that the faith that
[34:30] Christ gives that Christ quickens we
[34:33] just happen to be there Peter says I was
[34:36] I just had to front row seat at the gate
[34:38] beautiful when the Lord came down and
[34:40] quickened this brother's faith it wasn't
[34:42] me I just happened to be there it was
[34:45] the Faith of Christ because if any of us
[34:47] can claim that any of us had any kind of
[34:49] role in anything that Christ does it's
[34:51] of works and not of Grace it has nothing
[34:54] to do with us what does Satan want to do
[34:56] as he's sitting in Thrones during the
[34:58] temple he wants to put a little bit of
[35:00] poison in this beautiful pool
[35:03] this beautiful pool is the Waters of
[35:05] Grace the Waters of faith and the Satan
[35:08] just put one little drop of works
[35:12] it pollutes it
[35:14] his faith his grace we had absolutely
[35:18] nothing to do with it nothing
[35:24] brother Brandon's right right here Peter
[35:26] did not claim it was his own human faith
[35:29] and he had more than he claimed it was
[35:30] his own name he said that Jesus name
[35:33] used in the faith which is from Jesus
[35:36] performed the great work
[35:38] this faith is what the Lord was speaking
[35:40] about in Revelation 2 13. it was his
[35:43] faith it was not faith in him
[35:47] or we are just putting our will more
[35:49] strenuously toward the right thing and
[35:52] that brings direct result no it's not
[35:53] that
[35:54] it's the Faith of Christ not our not our
[35:58] Attention our strenuous attention to it
[36:01] it's not the faith in him but it was his
[36:03] own faith that he had given to the
[36:07] Believers
[36:08] I think that's a game changer that is
[36:12] what brings us into rest because as long
[36:15] as we think that we have anything to do
[36:17] about it any kind of failure of God's
[36:20] work in our lives can be a tributable to
[36:22] us to the extent that we think we have
[36:24] something to do about it but we have
[36:26] nothing to do with God's work in their
[36:28] lives
[36:29] when you say Lord have your way that's
[36:32] all that we do have your way
[36:35] and the more that I try to participate
[36:37] and help God in his work I just
[36:39] frustrate the grace of God no I'm gonna
[36:42] I'm putting my hand decide I don't want
[36:43] to mess up God's work in my life Lord
[36:45] Just Have Your Way
[36:49] and I want to take some time this
[36:52] evening I don't usually do this but I'd
[36:54] like to
[36:55] read some read multiple quotes where
[36:57] brother Branham talks about faith and
[37:00] well as I read these it just brings a
[37:02] real rest to me he says and message
[37:05] proving his word you can only have faith
[37:08] as God gives you faith
[37:11] faith is a gift of God you can only have
[37:14] it as God gives it to you so it's not
[37:16] like Winnie the Pooh faith faith faith
[37:18] bacon
[37:20] hopefully I get enough oh that we're
[37:21] doing that by on our own you can only
[37:24] have faith as God gives Faith it's a
[37:27] gift of God
[37:29] he says in the message faith is a
[37:31] substance
[37:32] it ain't what you try to make yourself
[37:34] believe
[37:36] it's simple nothing you can work
[37:39] yourself up to it's no excitement I
[37:42] notice people come in line and just get
[37:43] to shaking themselves and saying oh God
[37:45] hallelujah amen glory to God and that
[37:47] can happen sometimes
[37:48] and if you're coming in and then when
[37:50] the Holy Spirit Falls that produces that
[37:52] result but if we think I've got to do
[37:55] all these things first we're in the cart
[37:56] before the horse and then we're
[37:58] hindering the work of God so we can't
[38:00] say just because someone's shaking that
[38:02] they're hindering the work of God no
[38:03] because maybe the Holy Spirit came first
[38:05] and caused that but we can't think I
[38:08] have to do this in order to get God to
[38:10] come down and notice it that's not it
[38:12] all he says don't don't do that you
[38:16] interfere with faith there you interfere
[38:18] with God come up reverently and just lay
[38:21] your hand up and believe that's all
[38:25] all God need is an open vessel
[38:28] that's all he needs can we get empty
[38:31] enough so that God can fill us that's
[38:33] all that's our only challenge Faith you
[38:36] don't work yourself up to it
[38:39] faith is something that's already in
[38:41] your heart how did it get there God put
[38:44] it there
[38:47] you just come and believe and he says
[38:51] it's just the Simplicity of it one of
[38:53] the types of faith in the Bible is from
[38:55] the Old Testament story of The Exodus
[38:57] where the death angel was going through
[38:59] the land and Moses told the children of
[39:01] Israel put Blood on the doorpost so a
[39:04] lamb was slain typing Christ who was
[39:06] slain for us and then they had to take a
[39:08] brush of some sort and put the apply the
[39:10] apply the blood to the doorpost well
[39:13] they didn't have Sherwin-Williams paint
[39:14] brushes back then what they did have was
[39:16] a field Full Of Weeds they just went cut
[39:19] a bunch of those weeds up tied it up and
[39:21] then they'd dip all those weeds in the
[39:23] blood and wipe it up there
[39:26] all the these weeds were called hyssop
[39:28] and brother Brahm his hyssop is a type
[39:30] of Faith readily accessible free all you
[39:34] gotta do is go get it
[39:36] that's how simple faith is you have to
[39:38] go buy it somewhere just walked out
[39:40] grabbed it off the ground tied it up and
[39:42] used it that's how simple faith is
[39:46] the message works his faith expressed
[39:50] there's no faith as a revelation he's
[39:53] revealed it to you by his grace it's
[39:56] nothing you did
[39:59] it's nothing you did you didn't work
[40:02] yourself up into Faith you never had
[40:05] Faith it's given to you by the grace of
[40:07] God because you know what if we can work
[40:10] ourselves up into faith
[40:12] when we're feeling we're on the
[40:13] mountains we've got faith we're in The
[40:15] Valleys we don't got no faith and we go
[40:17] up and down up and down because a
[40:20] Christian shouldn't be tossed about like
[40:21] that we can't work ourselves up into
[40:24] faith we can't work our way into God's
[40:26] favor we can't work our way out of God's
[40:28] favor we're a son and daughter of God
[40:30] I'll love my son or daughter if they're
[40:33] a good boy or girl if they're a bad boy
[40:34] or girl if they get another home from
[40:36] the teacher they got they should get
[40:38] busted for something I still love them
[40:39] it doesn't matter
[40:42] it's nothing you did
[40:44] you think it's beautiful that faith is
[40:47] completely a gift of God the Bible says
[40:49] it and we forget it a lot of times why
[40:52] because just like in that picture me and
[40:53] age still today Satan's trying to put a
[40:55] little drop of work into the pure Waters
[40:58] of faith
[41:01] now what's neat is that God not only
[41:03] gives us his faith
[41:06] he says let me use the faith let me be
[41:09] the one who operates it we see this in
[41:12] Colossians 2 12. is buried with him in
[41:15] baptism wherein ye also are Arisen with
[41:18] him through the faith
[41:20] of the operation of God
[41:23] who uses the faith who quickens the
[41:26] faith
[41:27] God is the one who operates the faith we
[41:30] don't God gives it to us and then he'll
[41:32] use it in us we think that we've got to
[41:35] use it in some sort of way no God gives
[41:37] it to us he'll operate it because he's
[41:39] the one who really knows how to operate
[41:41] it
[41:43] our confidence is not in the strength of
[41:46] our prayer
[41:47] it's in the strength of God's promise we
[41:49] see a quote here on the bottom of page
[41:51] five brother branham's praying says God
[41:54] not with confidence in my prayer but
[41:56] confident in your promise no matter how
[41:59] little it is what it is how weak our
[42:02] prayer is you promised it Christ
[42:04] sometimes we think oh somebody could
[42:06] just pray for me this really I just have
[42:09] this nice strong sounding spiritual
[42:12] sounding prayer that that that that that
[42:14] that'll make it to Heaven no we don't
[42:16] have confidence in the strength of our
[42:18] prayer it has nothing to do with how
[42:20] strong our prayers is Satan I think with
[42:23] the brand is the weakest Saint on his
[42:25] knees causes hell to tremble it doesn't
[42:28] matter how how strong our prayer is and
[42:31] just imagine you've got this little core
[42:33] that you're trying to plug into an
[42:34] outlet this little chord Is Us
[42:37] so so weak we can't do anything but as
[42:40] soon as we get plugged into the outlet
[42:41] it doesn't matter how weak the court is
[42:43] how afraid the cord might be but once
[42:46] we're in the outlet in contact with
[42:48] Christ by faith man it's gonna work it's
[42:51] going to work so it doesn't we don't
[42:54] have confidence in our prayer anything
[42:55] that we do it's confidence in Christ and
[42:58] in his promises
[43:01] and then there's a whole series of
[43:02] quotes I want to share with you where
[43:04] brother Branham talks about how faith is
[43:07] an unconscious thing where we can have
[43:09] faith and maybe not even know it
[43:12] and the message he swore by himself he's
[43:14] saying listen
[43:15] I'm going to say something his look
[43:18] faith is unconscious you believe that
[43:21] I've learned that in years of travel
[43:23] around the world and meeting peoples of
[43:25] all different walks faith is unconscious
[43:28] you got faith and don't even know it
[43:32] that's right
[43:34] and that can blow our minds sometimes
[43:35] you think man if somebody has Faith they
[43:38] know it they'll come under expectation
[43:39] they'll come under expectation they'll
[43:41] expect their names to be called out by
[43:43] the prophet because they're coming with
[43:44] expectation if you expect something you
[43:47] you have a
[43:49] reasonable I can't avoid using the word
[43:52] expectation that it'll be fulfilled but
[43:55] he says you can Faith is unconscious you
[43:57] have it and might not even know it
[44:00] I said Jesus was unconscious of anything
[44:02] around him he says he didn't say oh I
[44:05] wonder if I prayed through I wonder if I
[44:07] fast long enough wonder if I did this he
[44:09] just walked on right unconscious and
[44:11] Jesus Is Our Lord but he's also our
[44:13] elder brother he's giving us the pattern
[44:15] for how we should walk with the Lord
[44:19] now we hear people so many people say
[44:22] well if I only had faith
[44:24] Faith doesn't mean long drawn-out prayer
[44:27] meetings we think that sometimes because
[44:30] no faith doesn't mean that it doesn't
[44:32] mean long fast faith is an unconscious
[44:34] thing your real Faith your unconscious
[44:38] of it you don't know the faith you've
[44:41] got it's an unconscious matter with you
[44:44] if we could just re once God started
[44:47] doing work on their lives we can just
[44:50] rest
[44:51] because everything brother Branham talks
[44:54] about the apple and that that seed
[44:56] everything that that seed needs to come
[44:59] and become an apple is Right within it
[45:01] everything you need to come to
[45:03] Perfection God has already put within
[45:05] you if you just get in his atmosphere
[45:07] except all the nutrients of the sun and
[45:10] the water it's going to grow into a
[45:12] beautiful apple tree and produce fruit
[45:13] it's going to all you have to do is just
[45:15] relax and that's the hardest thing in
[45:18] the world to relax the devil tries to
[45:20] get this thing I got to do something I
[45:21] gotta do something good no just relax
[45:23] let go let God have his wonderful way
[45:28] and I got to thinking about this
[45:30] particular quote
[45:32] and I got to thinking about uh
[45:34] our perception of faith
[45:36] can be the very things that brother
[45:38] Branham says isn't we think faith means
[45:41] a long drawn out for a meeting Faith me
[45:43] and that's nothing wrong I love those
[45:45] things but that doesn't mean that once
[45:47] I've done that then I've got faith
[45:49] and I got to thinking about this story
[45:51] of Elijah there on Mount Carmel
[45:55] and you know at the very beginning of
[45:56] the day the prophets of Baal come around
[45:58] there and the prophets of Baal they had
[46:02] Church
[46:03] they come in the morning all morning
[46:06] long all afternoon long they might have
[46:09] had a 12-hour church service and they
[46:12] had people doing all kinds of things in
[46:14] their church service it looked they were
[46:16] in the spirit they were caught up in the
[46:19] moment and they it was loud it was all
[46:22] kinds of things it looked like to the
[46:24] outward Observer they're having church
[46:26] and they're gonna but what are they
[46:28] doing at all by
[46:29] Elijah spoke and fight at him the whole
[46:31] time says my play a little bit louder
[46:33] get that tambourine a little louder
[46:34] maybe maybe God's fallen asleep
[46:38] maybe maybe he had to go to the John you
[46:41] just got to go go a little bit longer
[46:43] he's doing all that maybe he's on
[46:45] vacation be a little louder a little
[46:47] louder and they just and he just he just
[46:50] gets them going what he's doing he's
[46:52] poking exactly what the weaknesses you
[46:55] think you better do something to get
[46:57] your God's attention that's how all
[47:00] Antichrist systems are going to work
[47:01] you've got to do something to get your
[47:04] God's attention
[47:06] instruments we think the same thing
[47:09] what did Elijah have to do to get this
[47:11] God's attention
[47:14] I did this one time and the chapel
[47:16] server had the if you just the prophets
[47:20] of Bill were there for at least 12 hours
[47:22] and if you take a stopwatch and time his
[47:26] prayer it's just 63 words
[47:29] he just says Lord God of Abraham Isaac
[47:33] and Israel let it be known this day that
[47:36] you are God in Israel and I am your
[47:39] servant and I've done all these things
[47:41] that you were Hear Me O Lord hear me
[47:43] that this people may know that thou art
[47:46] the Lord God and you have turned their
[47:48] heart back in
[47:51] amen came right there with fire
[47:55] prayed probably less than the minute
[47:58] didn't look spiritual
[48:00] no volume no great speakers no singing
[48:03] no nothing that we associate with let's
[48:06] have church all he did he prayed
[48:10] and the fire fell like that and it just
[48:13] showed everything all human will and
[48:15] exertion was poured out in the altar of
[48:18] Baal for nothing
[48:21] all they allowed you to do
[48:23] just pray Lord
[48:25] we need you would you come just show
[48:28] your power tonight
[48:29] amen boom
[48:32] Elijah did nothing to marry God's
[48:35] attention God just goes there and shows
[48:37] what it is how do we in our mind think
[48:40] we have to approach God sometimes we
[48:42] think we've got to pray like the
[48:43] prophets of Baal did we got to pray
[48:45] along with the prophets build it be more
[48:48] sincere than the prophets of Baal have
[48:50] better this and the prophets of Bill
[48:51] better than that no
[48:53] we just got to pray that's it it's just
[48:56] that simple
[48:58] amen
[49:06] the message Queen of Sheba
[49:09] says how many's been in the meetings
[49:10] raise your hands now and seen this done
[49:12] raise your hands everywhere certainly
[49:14] certainly it's perfect it's God
[49:15] sometimes people have more faith than
[49:18] they think they have
[49:20] you try to make yourself have faith in
[49:22] God Winnie the Pooh faith faith faith no
[49:25] don't do that just humble yourself
[49:28] there's a man sitting right there the
[49:31] light still around them right there
[49:34] didn't it surprised him that he had that
[49:37] much faith
[49:40] that's right but he had it isn't that
[49:42] right sir if that's right raise up your
[49:44] hand yes the man that's healed right
[49:46] down there that's right it surprised you
[49:48] you don't think you have it
[49:51] but it's just simple just believe it
[49:54] and we think that to have faith we're
[49:56] going to come in and inspecting he's
[49:58] going to call me tonight yes I told you
[49:59] he was going to and God honored my faith
[50:02] that's not how it works
[50:05] think about when Jesus tells this
[50:07] parable of a of a public and who goes in
[50:09] to the temple to pray
[50:11] and the Publican is there praying
[50:13] praying praying and then after the
[50:15] public and comes in there's this
[50:16] Pharisee who comes and the Pharisee
[50:18] comes in they just Praises loud
[50:20] spiritual sounding prayer
[50:22] and Jesus asked the question which one
[50:24] do you think
[50:25] Was Heard by God
[50:28] which one looked like the spiritual
[50:29] prayer or the the Pharisee and the I
[50:33] think the more conscious we are of how
[50:36] spiritual we are
[50:39] the less spiritual it probably is
[50:41] because the public and he wasn't even
[50:44] aware of any kind of good thing or any
[50:47] kind of faithful thing he'd done
[50:49] he just thinks Lord help me Lord and
[50:52] that was about all the prayers he could
[50:53] get out nobody even sees it he doesn't
[50:56] even he he he despises his own prayer
[50:59] probably he thinks my prayer is not good
[51:01] enough isn't he in the back of his as
[51:03] he's praying he can hear in the back
[51:04] this public this Pharisee praying he
[51:07] said oh no he's taking up all the
[51:10] bandwidth now my prayer is not going to
[51:12] get through it's not going to make it
[51:13] that's what the public can probably
[51:15] think I don't have a chance because I
[51:17] don't pray well enough but he was
[51:19] absolutely unconscious of anything he
[51:21] could be doing that could be pleasing to
[51:22] God and that kind of faith that kind of
[51:25] prayer gets right into God's presence
[51:26] because that's God's faith working
[51:29] nothing of our own will nothing ever own
[51:32] exertion
[51:35] brother Branham says lady second lady
[51:37] from the end there elderly lady with a
[51:39] pair of glasses on look looking this way
[51:41] you've got you got low blood pressure
[51:43] you believe Jesus Christ would heal you
[51:45] sister
[51:46] you that sitting there on a pink cushion
[51:49] looking at me with a spotted dress on
[51:50] say looking up yes see how hard he has
[51:53] to work to get your attention
[51:56] you believe that Christ will make you
[51:58] well raise up your hand if you believe
[52:00] it all right accept it then amen
[52:03] see how unconscious faith is the woman
[52:07] sitting there thinking in her heart so
[52:09] much that she didn't even hear me
[52:11] talking to her that's right but you see
[52:14] God spoke to her
[52:17] she's so busy in her own thoughts yet
[52:20] she still has faith
[52:22] that got through despite herself
[52:26] because it wasn't her faith it was God's
[52:29] faith
[52:31] and the message here he him on page six
[52:33] what do you think sitting there on the
[52:35] end of the seat sir suffering with Qatar
[52:37] you believe Christ will make you well
[52:39] all right if you believe it you can have
[52:42] it
[52:43] that scared you you didn't know you had
[52:46] that much faith
[52:48] faith is an unconscious thing just have
[52:51] faith and believe and again we think if
[52:54] we someone has Faith they're not going
[52:56] to be scared of anything God does
[52:57] they're expecting it when God actually
[52:59] come to the person they didn't they
[53:02] weren't aware of how much God was
[53:04] listening to their heart the call of
[53:06] their heart when God answers their call
[53:08] it it scares them but they had Faith
[53:10] they didn't realize how much Faith they
[53:14] had
[53:16] message greater than Solomon he says
[53:19] your faith is unconscious
[53:21] don't press now or jump you jump away
[53:23] from it it's right with you just relax
[53:26] yourself and believe just believe now
[53:29] and have faith
[53:31] amen and be reverent just have faith
[53:34] just believe
[53:35] sometimes your faith is unconscious
[53:38] you have it and you don't know it that
[53:42] little woman had it and she didn't know
[53:44] it
[53:45] we underestimate
[53:47] if God started working in our heart we
[53:50] underestimate the power of that
[53:53] once God started working there that will
[53:55] change you all the way to Kingdom Come
[53:57] it starts the work he continues the work
[53:59] he finishes the work nothing you have to
[54:01] do just continue with continue walking
[54:03] with him it'll be a done work that's why
[54:06] in the Old Testament so much longer the
[54:08] New Testament the New Testament only one
[54:10] thing you have to tell they came to the
[54:12] Lord and that was it because the rest of
[54:13] the journey was assured
[54:17] he says super sign what about the
[54:19] balcony somebody believe you believe it
[54:21] that he's the same now I see a woman
[54:24] she don't even realize she's got that
[54:26] Faith it's a hidden Faith she don't even
[54:28] confess it She's suffering with a
[54:30] headache sitting here looking at me
[54:32] right up here a Mrs singer surprised you
[54:35] didn't it your headache's Gonna Leave
[54:37] You Now now you tell your critics
[54:40] to answer that
[54:42] and we've talked about how faith is a
[54:44] gift of God that is Faith of the
[54:46] operation of God these people didn't
[54:49] even realize they had the faith but God
[54:51] gave it to him and God operates the
[54:54] faith we don't operate the faith if it
[54:57] depended upon being able to operate the
[54:59] faith well enough to get to heaven we'd
[55:01] have a lot of crashes along the way it
[55:03] doesn't depend upon us operating the
[55:05] faith
[55:06] faith is a gift brother Raymond says a
[55:09] true gift is just getting yourself out
[55:11] of the way so that God gives it and he
[55:14] can operate it he uses it
[55:17] on page seven in the message blasphemy
[55:19] misnames brother Branham talks about
[55:21] mental faith
[55:23] and we can we we can hear that man I've
[55:25] got so much mental faith and but I'm
[55:27] talking you have to have a spiritual
[55:28] Faith but how can I transform my mental
[55:31] faith into a spiritual faith I I just
[55:34] can't do it
[55:35] but he says the biggest part of our
[55:38] faith is mental faith and this I hear
[55:40] Brothers
[55:42] I feel a little bit better now because
[55:43] yeah that is the biggest part of our
[55:45] faith is mental Faith but by hearing the
[55:47] word it brings us to a mental
[55:49] recognition of God yes I recognize that
[55:52] but if this coming from above if it ever
[55:55] strikes this Faith then that transforms
[55:58] it to a Godly spiritual faith
[56:01] you can't transform your mental faith
[56:03] into a spiritual faith God does that
[56:06] all you do is put yourself in the right
[56:08] place listening to the right thing and
[56:11] it'll it'll happen
[56:12] we don't have anything to do with it
[56:14] Christ does that work into US it says
[56:18] when the word is pouring itself into our
[56:19] faith our mental Faith becomes a
[56:22] spiritual revelation
[56:25] and I love this from an ordered ones at
[56:27] the end time it's in the middle of page
[56:28] seven
[56:29] because sometimes we can be be praying
[56:31] for something whether it be the baptism
[56:33] of the Holy Ghost whatever it might be
[56:35] let's say it's the Baptist of the Holy
[56:37] Ghost
[56:38] do you believe that if you've repented
[56:40] him and baptized is it God's will to
[56:42] fill you with the Holy Spirit
[56:43] yes Acts 2 38 says if you've done these
[56:46] things you've repented God's going to do
[56:48] it it is it is his will
[56:50] maybe it hasn't happened yet but if it's
[56:53] his will it's going to happen
[56:55] brother Branham says what is faith faith
[56:58] is something that's revealed to you
[57:00] that is not yet but you believe it will
[57:03] be
[57:03] faith is a revelation of the will of God
[57:07] so maybe it hasn't happened yet but you
[57:10] believe this is God's will for me I'm
[57:12] still having faith in expecting it
[57:14] because God it's God's promise
[57:17] maybe as an app dip I'm going to keep on
[57:19] waiting for it because God will provide
[57:21] God will keep his promise I'm not
[57:24] depending upon the strength of my prayer
[57:25] I'm depending upon the strength of the
[57:27] promise and God's promises you can take
[57:30] those to the bank
[57:32] true faith is getting yourself out of
[57:34] the way it's relaxing yourself getting
[57:37] yourself out of the way then God comes
[57:39] in and uses you the way he wants to
[57:43] but we've talked about this evening the
[57:46] faith being a gift of God of the
[57:48] operation of God and unconscious faith
[57:51] that it's working in us without us being
[57:53] involved in the process at all I think
[57:55] it's just such a these prayer lines such
[57:57] a good illustration of how what these
[57:59] scriptures are describing and showing
[58:00] how these scriptures work in practice
[58:03] but it's the opposite of what Paul calls
[58:06] will worship
[58:08] in Colossians chapter 2.
[58:12] here he says wherefore if you be dead
[58:14] with Christ from the rudiments of the
[58:16] world or the principles of the world
[58:18] if you're dead with Christ why as though
[58:22] living in the world are you subject to
[58:24] ordinances or laws like touch not taste
[58:27] not handle not
[58:29] all these are to perish with the using
[58:31] why are you doing this these are
[58:33] Commandments and doctrines of men which
[58:35] things happen to eat a show of wisdom
[58:37] and a will worship
[58:39] the most self-disciplined person can
[58:42] look like they're a really holy person
[58:44] because they're able to keep themselves
[58:46] from this not do this not do this it has
[58:49] a show of wisdom and a will worship
[58:51] because I've got a strong enough will
[58:53] where I'm going to keep myself I'm gonna
[58:54] I'm gonna keep myself from feeding the
[58:57] animals inside me I'm gonna keep myself
[58:59] from doing this wrong thing that wrong
[59:00] thing that that wrong thing it looks
[59:03] like
[59:04] I'm living a good Christian life but
[59:06] it's all because I've been able to
[59:08] concentrate my will and keep myself in
[59:11] check and there are some people who are
[59:13] pretty pretty strong-willed people and
[59:15] can live at what looks like a really
[59:17] holy life for a long time but remember
[59:20] it's not by human will or exertion
[59:22] and eventually things are going to
[59:24] happen even in their lives where they
[59:27] just get tired
[59:29] and all of a sudden they just stop
[59:31] because I've done it for so long I'm
[59:33] just worn out I want to break and then
[59:36] that what in the world happened all that
[59:39] time we thought they were walking with
[59:41] the Lord and had the real thing it was
[59:43] just there they were really worshiping
[59:46] their own will so I how strong they were
[59:49] they having a show of wisdom and will
[59:52] worship
[59:53] humility neglecting the body but not in
[59:57] any honor to the satisfying of the flesh
[1:00:01] that's not what it is
[1:00:03] it looks like it could be a good thing
[1:00:05] but the more aware that we are of our
[1:00:09] own spirituality the less spiritual it
[1:00:11] probably is
[1:00:12] it's a lot more rap and a lot less of
[1:00:14] Christ the more I am aware of what it is
[1:00:24] a page a page eight it's kind of
[1:00:27] wrapping things up here
[1:00:30] emphasizing that the whole thing is by
[1:00:34] Grace from repentance to Rapture it's
[1:00:36] all by Grace
[1:00:39] um let me read one more quote just just
[1:00:41] above that in the world falling apart
[1:00:43] and just kind of I read I read this
[1:00:45] quote already how we Christianity is not
[1:00:47] something we have to beg and cry and
[1:00:49] plead and fast and starve to get
[1:00:51] something from the Lord you don't do it
[1:00:52] by works by grace
[1:00:55] brother Brandon talks in world falling
[1:00:57] apart here um how it's a good prayer to
[1:01:00] pray Lord your will be done
[1:01:03] and sometimes people like man pray your
[1:01:04] lord your will be done that's a
[1:01:06] faithless prayer because we should be
[1:01:07] telling God what we need from and
[1:01:09] expecting him to do it instead of just
[1:01:11] praying Lord your will be done
[1:01:13] and he says
[1:01:15] um thy kingdom come thy will be done he
[1:01:17] says where do we find that kind of
[1:01:19] prayer being prayed
[1:01:22] we're always wanting God to run errands
[1:01:24] for us or do something for us but when
[1:01:27] we're willing to say thy will be done
[1:01:30] commit ourselves to our ways to him all
[1:01:33] that we are committed to him that's when
[1:01:35] God will move
[1:01:37] when you're willing to let him work on
[1:01:39] you not you work on him
[1:01:42] sometimes those prayers that we think
[1:01:44] are so strong and powerful
[1:01:46] they're an exertion of our will trying
[1:01:49] to get God's will to do what we want
[1:01:51] them to do
[1:01:53] but he says
[1:01:55] God moves when we're willing to let him
[1:01:57] work on us not us work on him let him
[1:02:00] tell you
[1:02:01] not you tell him and twist it around
[1:02:04] because how we can get things so messed
[1:02:07] up in our prayer lives and we pray what
[1:02:09] seems to be such a strong prayer of
[1:02:11] faith and we can say a declaration I
[1:02:14] believe the Lord is going to do this or
[1:02:16] this or this if God hasn't told you that
[1:02:20] you can get in some big trouble there
[1:02:22] because you raise expectation that
[1:02:23] that's going to happen but that is your
[1:02:25] word and not God's word and we've asked
[1:02:28] God please do but we can't tell God to
[1:02:30] do it
[1:02:31] we're twisting things around and we're
[1:02:34] putting ourselves out there's God I want
[1:02:35] you to do this work of healing now hurry
[1:02:37] up because it's they're hurting bad
[1:02:40] no God's on the throne and we can say no
[1:02:43] we we've committed this to him and trust
[1:02:45] and and we're and we're trusting
[1:02:47] ourselves to him
[1:02:48] I love I think the three Hebrew boys
[1:02:51] they have such a good Declaration of
[1:02:53] faith
[1:02:54] nebuchadne they're coming before
[1:02:56] Nebuchadnezzar and he says
[1:02:58] Nebuchadnezzar we don't know what God's
[1:03:00] going to do
[1:03:01] but even if you throw us into this
[1:03:04] furnace and he doesn't get us out of
[1:03:06] there he's going to get us out of your
[1:03:07] hand one way or the other they didn't
[1:03:09] say in the name of Jehovah we're going
[1:03:12] to come out of those Flames alive they
[1:03:13] didn't say that that would have gotten
[1:03:15] lots of amens but they didn't say that
[1:03:17] because they didn't they must not have
[1:03:19] had thus Seth Lord I don't know why they
[1:03:21] didn't say but they didn't but they give
[1:03:23] us an example we know what's going to
[1:03:25] happen but we're going to step out and
[1:03:27] trust God that he'll take care of us
[1:03:29] that is Faith because they were letting
[1:03:32] God work on them without them having to
[1:03:35] work on God
[1:03:38] so what I just see here
[1:03:40] why is Faith so important to God
[1:03:43] it's of faith that it might be by Grace
[1:03:46] there were they were through anything
[1:03:48] else than Faith it'd be because of an
[1:03:51] ounce of your will or an ounce of your
[1:03:53] exertion but it's by faith so that it
[1:03:56] can be entirely completely 100 percent
[1:03:59] by grace
[1:04:03] and um again I just want to hark back uh
[1:04:06] one thing I said this is closing here
[1:04:08] from repentance to Rapture it's all
[1:04:10] great unless we get the idea in their
[1:04:12] minds I know I'm saved by grace but I
[1:04:14] pray Lord I can be good enough that that
[1:04:17] day when you come in the Rapture I hope
[1:04:19] I'm walking with you that day because I
[1:04:21] I
[1:04:22] hi I'm not good enough we think we have
[1:04:25] to be good enough for the Rapture or
[1:04:26] something but it's all Grace how is
[1:04:29] Enoch translated
[1:04:31] Hebrews 11 says by faith Enoch was
[1:04:34] translated did he have faith none of us
[1:04:37] have faith faith is the gift of God that
[1:04:39] God uses yeah the raptures of Revelation
[1:04:42] as well you can't give yourself
[1:04:43] Revelation it's all Grace
[1:04:47] First Corinthians 15 says I show you a
[1:04:50] mystery we shall not all sleep we shall
[1:04:52] all be changed
[1:04:54] the Rapture is that last step
[1:04:57] that God is changing us so every day
[1:04:59] that we're walking with the Lord
[1:05:01] he changes a little bit today a little
[1:05:03] bit tomorrow a little bit tomorrow a
[1:05:05] little bit the next day each of those
[1:05:06] little changes are connecting us to that
[1:05:10] Monumental change that's just coming
[1:05:12] but that Monumental change is nothing
[1:05:15] without the little changes happening
[1:05:17] each and every day
[1:05:18] don't live just for the Rapture live for
[1:05:21] God today because he's changing us now
[1:05:23] he's changing us tomorrow and one day
[1:05:25] he's going to change us for the last
[1:05:27] time we're going to be in his presence
[1:05:28] it's all by grace
[1:05:32] the Rapture is the last step of our
[1:05:34] Earthly walk with God
[1:05:36] all the changes God's working out now in
[1:05:38] our lives from carnal to spiritual are
[1:05:41] our connection to that climactic change
[1:05:43] for mortality and mortality walk with
[1:05:46] God each and every day
[1:05:48] amen
[1:05:49] come on up musicians
[1:05:52] and this pergamian age brother Branham
[1:05:54] says where men were humanizing salvation
[1:05:58] and that's what's still being done today
[1:06:00] the devil has done everything he can to
[1:06:02] humanize Salvation some way to make us
[1:06:04] think you've got something to do with it
[1:06:07] and the more that we think we have to do
[1:06:09] with it the more we just get in the way
[1:06:12] but he says human Faith wasn't enough
[1:06:14] then and it's not enough now it takes
[1:06:18] the very faith of the Son of God to drop
[1:06:20] into a man's heart so he can receive the
[1:06:22] Lord Of Glory into the temple not made
[1:06:24] with hands
[1:06:26] Paul didn't say he lived by by faith in
[1:06:28] the Son of God it was the faith of the
[1:06:30] son of God
[1:06:32] is from last time the devil wants us to
[1:06:34] have this kind of cliff-hanging
[1:06:35] relationship with God for we can I can
[1:06:38] just hold on long enough I'll make it
[1:06:41] they were surviving on their own will
[1:06:43] our own exertion
[1:06:45] but here we're connected to the Faith of
[1:06:47] Christ his faith is what's holding us
[1:06:50] and we can rest in that
[1:06:53] let's pray
[1:06:56] heavenly father I thank you for your
[1:06:58] goodness and your grace to us Lord I
[1:07:00] thank you Father for all the ways that
[1:07:03] you worked in the brother Brandon's
[1:07:05] Ministry to show how Faith worked and
[1:07:08] there was just such an encouragement to
[1:07:10] me all the people there who you spoke to
[1:07:13] and he said you had faith and even
[1:07:15] realized you had faith and how often do
[1:07:17] we feel so faithless sometimes but
[1:07:21] after you've started a work in US
[1:07:23] you put your faith in us I pray Lord
[1:07:25] that you would help us to take our hands
[1:07:27] off the wheel not try to have you as our
[1:07:30] co-pilot let you operate the faith use
[1:07:34] it Quicken it Lord bring us all the way
[1:07:37] home oh God lord and I pray there are
[1:07:39] those who are just um
[1:07:41] Lord strung out and not sure
[1:07:44] um where they are with you Lord or or
[1:07:47] thinking I just hope I'm good enough
[1:07:48] Lord I pray that you might bring them
[1:07:50] into a rest a real true rest or they can
[1:07:53] just rest in your promises and stop
[1:07:56] trying to to think their way and believe
[1:07:59] their way and manufacture enough Faith
[1:08:01] they can just rest that you would do a
[1:08:03] mighty work complete that in them oh God
[1:08:05] bring us into your rest I pray
[1:08:07] in Jesus name
[1:08:09] amen
[1:08:13] could we
