[0:01] i'm glad to be free this morning
[0:04] i'm glad to be a christian i'm glad to
[0:07] walk in the message of the hour
[0:10] i'm glad to be in his presence here this
[0:12] morning glad to be amongst the body of
[0:14] christ
[0:15] and i pray that around the world the
[0:17] holy spirit would move in a special way
[0:19] not only with us here but everywhere
[0:22] where we meet under the true word of god
[0:24] and
[0:25] the presence of god i pray that lies
[0:27] would be changed
[0:28] we don't want to leave here
[0:30] the same as when we came in
[0:32] amen praise the lord hosea chapter 3
[0:35] this is the text i read last sunday
[0:37] we're going to continue
[0:38] with the subject seeking the son of
[0:40] david in the last days
[0:42] seeking the son of david in the last
[0:44] days
[0:45] it says here in verse
[0:47] 4
[0:48] for the children of israel shall abide
[0:50] many days without a king and without a
[0:53] prince and without a sacrifice
[0:56] and without an image and without an
[0:58] ephod and without a a tariff him
[1:02] those things some of those things that
[1:04] are mentioned that the children of his
[1:06] or went many days without
[1:08] are some of those things are essential
[1:10] things
[1:11] to connecting with jehovah god
[1:13] a king a prince the sacrifice if we
[1:16] remove those things they're essential
[1:19] and the people of israel had got so far
[1:21] away from them this is speaking about
[1:23] how the condition you can get in without
[1:26] a king without a sacrifice anybody can
[1:28] get in that condition if they distance
[1:31] themselves and get separated enough from
[1:33] what god sent his essentials for your
[1:35] spiritual life
[1:37] i don't care if you grew up all these
[1:39] years in church you get away from the
[1:41] right things and you're going to start
[1:42] to suffer
[1:44] but some of the things mentioned here
[1:46] are not and we'll get into this a little
[1:48] bit today it says without an image and
[1:50] without an ephod and without a terraphim
[1:54] these are actually things if you study
[1:55] it deeper that are there weren't things
[1:57] necessarily god provided because he said
[2:00] no have no graven image before you
[2:03] so these are things god didn't provide
[2:05] but they were things that the people set
[2:07] up in their homes when they were so far
[2:09] away from jehovah god they begin to set
[2:11] up images they begin to set up an ephod
[2:14] and a terraphim and these things were
[2:16] anything that they could just grab and
[2:19] put in their homes and put it in their
[2:20] lives that could somehow make them feel
[2:22] better that they were connecting with
[2:24] god
[2:24] so when we get away from god this is
[2:26] what happens and with essential things
[2:28] from god we start to develop our own
[2:31] things to make our own connection with
[2:33] god
[2:34] and that's idolatry and that's imagery
[2:36] and those are things that if you think
[2:38] that we don't have those today we still
[2:40] have those today but when redemption
[2:42] comes in verse 5 this is what the people
[2:44] did the children of israel return and
[2:47] seek the lord their god and david their
[2:50] king and shall fear the lord in his
[2:52] goodness in the latter's days and that's
[2:54] why i said seeking the son of david in
[2:57] the last days seeking the lord seeking
[2:59] the son of david and with the fear of
[3:02] god and his goodness this is what the
[3:04] people did in the last days that's my
[3:06] heart
[3:07] i don't want to be seeking any
[3:08] possession of life
[3:10] i don't want to be seeking any other
[3:12] thing of man
[3:13] i'm not seeking politics this morning
[3:16] i'm seeking the lord and i'm seeking the
[3:18] king
[3:20] and if we could have a new year's
[3:22] resolution or i call him new year's
[3:24] revelations
[3:26] this would be it for me i don't want to
[3:28] be seeking anything else except the lord
[3:30] and the king
[3:32] amen father bless the word today bless
[3:34] every soul that is here and listening
[3:37] lord jesus may you surround us lord and
[3:39] fill us with your presence
[3:41] lord jesus there's such a dependence on
[3:43] you and more and more as the days are
[3:45] approaching we see this in the scripture
[3:47] lord and in the last days the people
[3:49] coming back to seeking the right thing

[3:54] would make it a if there is a new years

[3:59] make this the greatest thing in our
[4:00] hearts lord that we seek you more and we

[4:57] that special this morning god bless you
[4:59] we appreciate all the gifts and just the
[5:02] anointed words of god and singing of god
[5:04] that brings us
[5:05] certainly into his presence
[5:07] amen do you love the lord this morning
[5:10] praise the lord we want to just
[5:13] stay
[5:14] in this channel of talking about this
[5:16] seeking the son of david in the last
[5:18] days
[5:20] and being it's this time where the world
[5:23] celebrates and our focus is on
[5:25] the
[5:27] story of when christ was born and we
[5:29] know a majority of people don't really
[5:32] completely understand what was taken
[5:33] place in that and yet the world focuses
[5:36] on it and looks at it and and we we
[5:39] certainly do that it's not about the
[5:41] tinsel and all these other things as
[5:43] much as is about recognizing god came in
[5:46] flesh
[5:47] and all of us are affected because that
[5:49] a visitation from the lord
[5:54] we we we try to watch together as a bit
[5:56] of a tradition the nativity story and
[5:59] it's a it's a special film that uh it
[6:02] makes it really real the birth of christ
[6:04] really real mary's really they make it
[6:06] real down to earth and real not covered
[6:08] over with things and maybe more of a
[6:11] catholic way about it but it's just very
[6:13] good and we always minister to with that
[6:16] but the story is that over 2 000 years
[6:19] ago the world did not know that in
[6:22] bethlehem god
[6:24] was actually bringing the world doesn't
[6:25] know this but god was actually bringing
[6:27] a completely different kingdom to the
[6:30] earth
[6:33] probably not a lot of people know that's
[6:35] what was happening but when he came
[6:38] himself in a baby what he was doing was
[6:41] bringing his kingdom to earth
[6:44] a completely different kingdom than we
[6:47] would be used to and he brought it in
[6:48] the form of a little baby
[6:50] the word made flesh
[6:53] of course is completely different than
[6:55] any politics or completely different
[6:57] than any religion
[6:59] even the jewish religion even the
[7:01] pharisees and sadducees and all that
[7:03] they knew of jehovah and all that they
[7:05] studied and the law that they knew i can
[7:08] tell you that when the word was made
[7:10] flesh and was born there god was
[7:13] bringing something completely different
[7:16] a completely different kingdom
[7:18] their law and their religion actually
[7:20] they'd turned it into
[7:22] their own kingdom they turned it into
[7:24] something god did not intend for it to
[7:27] be turned into we always do that as
[7:29] human beings we take something from the
[7:31] past and we make it a tradition and we
[7:34] turn it into a kingdom but then it's
[7:36] god's saying no that's not what i was
[7:39] looking for that's not what i was
[7:40] wanting that's not the kingdom of god
[7:43] that's become a religion that's become
[7:45] something you put on the outside and
[7:47] then because we adopt our own ways then
[7:50] it get we get into such a condition
[7:53] without god thinking we're okay with our
[7:55] religion that after so many years god
[7:59] has to say listen they've gotten
[8:01] completely away from my kingdom and so
[8:03] now i have to come again myself and
[8:07] bring the kingdom of god back to earth
[8:09] again
[8:12] he was bringing his kingdom to earth can
[8:14] you say amen
[8:16] he was bringing his kingdom
[8:18] and they didn't recognize it as that
[8:21] they didn't know
[8:23] that it was that and they didn't know
[8:24] that what god was bringing was exactly
[8:26] what they needed they didn't know that
[8:29] what god was bringing in that baby was
[8:31] exactly
[8:32] what would exactly meet the need that
[8:35] they were in the condition that they
[8:37] were in
[8:38] god had the answer for the condition
[8:40] they were in and that's true this
[8:42] morning
[8:44] don't be looking for your own thing look
[8:46] for what god has provided to meet the
[8:49] condition you're in
[8:50] because god's way is the best way god's
[8:53] way is the way that's going to really
[8:55] bring the answer to your life and bring
[8:57] the answer to what their condition you
[8:59] would be in no matter what it is so they
[9:01] didn't know what was needed they didn't
[9:02] know this is exactly what was needed and
[9:05] it's it's not now that it's not that
[9:07] they weren't fed up with the system it's
[9:09] not that they weren't fed up with uh
[9:12] what was going on they were fed up with
[9:14] it and it's not that they weren't poised
[9:16] for another kingdom to come they were
[9:18] actually ready they were anxious for
[9:20] another kingdom to come something else
[9:22] has got to happen and the jews
[9:24] particularly gravitated towards the
[9:25] messiah but they interpreted it as being
[9:28] that the messiah the king would come
[9:31] in a manner that would get rid of rome
[9:33] and deal with our problems and we would
[9:35] be in charge and so even a desire for
[9:38] something to change it wasn't
[9:40] interpreted according to the word
[9:42] because what israel needed first was not
[9:45] a king but they needed a lamb to die for
[9:48] their sins can you say man because if
[9:50] you don't take care of the sin first
[9:52] what good is a king
[9:55] if you don't take care of your problems
[9:57] and your sin what good is a king in a
[10:00] kingdom because the kingdom in god's
[10:02] kingdom it's about your soul it's about
[10:04] your heart
[10:07] why would god want to take you in the
[10:09] condition you're in and take you over
[10:11] into a millennium with a king and you
[10:14] didn't have any of the character of the
[10:15] king you didn't have any change in your
[10:17] life you didn't have the kingdom of god
[10:19] within you he has to have his kingdom
[10:22] within your soul and within your heart
[10:24] first and then you're ready for the king
[10:28] can i get an amen this morning
[10:30] i don't know if you had too much turkey
[10:32] yesterday what's going on but i'm
[10:33] intending on preaching my heart out
[10:35] whether you're going to get into it or
[10:36] not
[10:37] let me tell you something god said
[10:39] exactly what the people needed and it
[10:42] was for the heart first
[10:45] it was for the sin first
[10:48] so don't question how god's dealing with
[10:51] you
[10:52] sometimes because
[10:54] he deals with things in different ways
[10:56] and he comes to you in different ways
[10:57] but he knows what he has to deal with
[10:59] first
[11:02] they were fed up with the kingdom that
[11:04] they had they were fed up with they were
[11:06] ready for another kingdom they were but
[11:08] it's the way god brought it that made it
[11:09] difficult to see and they didn't see it
[11:12] they were in dire need of something
[11:14] different but this was not just a
[11:17] a different bent on things this was not
[11:19] just to put a bandage on their problems
[11:22] this was not another version
[11:24] of the world that god was bringing this
[11:27] was a completely different kingdom
[11:29] coming not to be compared at all with
[11:32] what they had if they had a revelation
[11:34] that it was god's answer they
[11:37] would have been seeking for it let me
[11:39] say that again if they had a revelation
[11:42] that this baby was god's answer to their
[11:44] condition then they would have been
[11:46] seeking after it
[11:50] if you have a revelation of what god has
[11:52] provided in the last days you will be
[11:55] seeking for it every day you will be
[11:57] looking this is what i want this is what
[11:59] i've i've pursued every other thing in
[12:01] my life but i have found this is god's
[12:04] provided way and i'm gonna seek for it
[12:07] with all my heart i'm gonna get closer
[12:09] to it i'm going to get closer to my lord
[12:12] can you say amen
[12:14] and it's when you have a revelation
[12:15] which that day only a few
[12:18] were seeking it out the shepherds the
[12:20] wise men only very few in that day the
[12:23] rest herod certainly wasn't seeking it
[12:24] and if he was it was to kill the messiah
[12:27] it was to kill the king but we find the
[12:29] wise men and mary and joseph and there
[12:33] was very few but they had a revelation
[12:34] and so we find something rise up in the
[12:37] hearts of the shepherds and the hearts
[12:38] of the wise men as they begin to seek
[12:41] this thing they took this journey clear
[12:43] across the desert why they were seeking
[12:45] i was going to sing a song with my mom
[12:47] today we sung for years she's sick today
[12:49] wasn't here but wise men still seek him
[12:53] today
[12:54] and not just wise in their head but a
[12:55] people with revelation what's how do i
[12:58] know they have a revelation they're
[12:59] seeking him
[13:01] the wise men took the journey they were
[13:03] willing to come many many hours drive
[13:06] many many hours with their camels
[13:10] can you say man i think of many of you
[13:12] who drove many hours this morning out of
[13:15] a hunger of god in your heart can you
[13:17] say amen it's a revelation those that
[13:19] are seeking something can you say man
[13:21] they're seeking more of god they're
[13:23] seeking i want to know the king more can
[13:25] you say amen and here's these these
[13:28] basically heathen men we don't know what
[13:30] was in complete in their hearts but they
[13:32] got a revelation of the stars coming
[13:33] together
[13:36] and god dropped in the heart that's the
[13:37] time for the king of kings
[13:40] we're going to make the journey to go
[13:42] clear across the desert and it took him
[13:44] a long many months probably two years
[13:48] and they said we're doing this thing
[13:49] we're leaving our everything comfortable
[13:50] to us why they were seeking
[13:55] because they had a revelation
[13:57] you see that's why we have to pray for
[13:59] our children and pray for those
[14:02] that we're praying for
[14:04] the greatest thing you can pray is that
[14:06] they receive a revelation
[14:09] don't try to conform them
[14:11] don't try to get them in church and just
[14:12] make them look like the message
[14:15] but pray because my god
[14:17] can do much more than any religion can
[14:20] do
[14:21] my god because why are we praying for
[14:23] life god opened their eyes because once
[14:26] their eyes are open they see this thing
[14:28] completely different
[14:31] if it took a revelation for the wise man
[14:33] it takes a revelation for our own
[14:35] children
[14:37] we're not just something different or
[14:38] we've got the messages no it still takes
[14:41] a revelation to see what this message is
[14:45] you cannot run this through the filter
[14:47] of some idea and some denomination or
[14:50] some movement or some other thing you
[14:52] can't this doesn't compare with anything
[14:54] else this is different this is the
[14:57] kingdom of god coming to us
[15:03] it didn't look like it
[15:05] but it is
[15:06] it takes a revelation the wise men run
[15:08] going in the camels completely across by
[15:11] the way you drove in a much more
[15:12] comfortable situation this morning
[15:17] you certainly did you ought to say thank
[15:19] you lord for my
[15:21] nice
[15:22] lincoln or whatever you guys got
[15:25] thank you lord a lot more comfortable
[15:27] you look on the movie and you see these
[15:29] guys on these camels and i'm thinking
[15:32] two years
[15:34] with your hips going like this
[15:37] it's pretty rough
[15:39] there's only one answer to it
[15:41] they were seeking
[15:43] the king of kings
[15:45] nothing was going to stop them
[15:48] praise the lord
[15:49] and the shepherds were seeking
[15:51] and they it should have been shepherds
[15:53] because the lamb was coming they were
[15:55] seeking the true lamb the wise men are
[15:57] seeking the true king they were seeking
[15:59] the king and when they arrived
[16:01] it was in this is what i said last
[16:02] sunday when they arrived it was in it
[16:05] was a baby it was in infant form if i
[16:07] can say it that way the king of kings
[16:09] and all that he would be and all that he
[16:11] was was in potential form in a baby but
[16:13] guess what when they arrived and got
[16:15] down on their knees they weren't
[16:17] disappointed that it was a baby because
[16:19] they had a revelation that everything
[16:21] that i need is in that baby
[16:26] see when we come to church and we're
[16:28] seeking the right way we're never
[16:30] disappointed
[16:33] if people are coming to church for the
[16:34] right reasons they're never disappointed
[16:37] but if they're coming for the wrong
[16:39] reasons they can be disappointed they
[16:41] can be critical they can be they keep
[16:42] thinking about everything what
[16:44] everybody's wearing or what whatever you
[16:45] see you got to get everything off of
[16:47] your mind can you say man and come to
[16:49] church for one reason i come because i
[16:52] want to be in the presence of the king i
[16:53] want to see the lord i want to worship
[16:55] and i want to grow and i want to change
[16:57] i want to be different than what i was
[16:59] last week
[17:01] there's a way to come to church can you
[17:02] say amen and might i say it this morning
[17:04] because we're a tad stew starchy might i
[17:07] say there's a way to come and worship
[17:08] the church too we don't come as some
[17:10] type of starchy thing but we come this
[17:13] is one place in the world we can open up
[17:15] our hearts and express ourselves to god
[17:18] freely
[17:21] if we can't do it here then where can we
[17:23] do it you should be able to do it in
[17:25] your homes but if you don't have any
[17:26] other place you ought to feel free here
[17:28] you ought to say i can bring my problems
[17:30] i can bring my burdens i can bring
[17:32] anything before god he's not afraid of
[17:35] any of it can you say man there's a way
[17:37] to come to church
[17:38] but not only can i bring my problems i
[17:41] can bring the best of my worship for the
[17:43] lord
[17:47] amen praise the lord they seen it in
[17:49] potential form but they weren't
[17:51] disappointed they started to worship
[17:52] anyway
[17:54] because everything they needed was in
[17:56] that baby she was holding
[18:00] what is it you're holding with this
[18:01] message
[18:04] amen
[18:06] what is it that we're holding
[18:09] so god once again
[18:11] now to bring it up to date god once
[18:13] again has given to us in the last days
[18:17] a virgin-born word of god
[18:22] untouched by man's hands
[18:25] you realize that right
[18:26] jesus
[18:28] was untouched by man's hands
[18:32] the religions didn't have anything to do
[18:34] with it
[18:36] mary didn't have anything to do with it
[18:38] joseph didn't have anything to do with
[18:39] it this was a virgin untouched by man's
[18:43] hands
[18:44] and that's the way god has to have it to
[18:47] bring his kingdom
[18:48] has to be pure
[18:50] has to be untouched
[18:52] it can't originate in a denomination
[18:54] and it is so similar if not the same
[18:56] thing when he births his word and brings
[18:58] it to the last days it can't be
[19:01] micromanaged by a denominational system
[19:05] it can't come through a filter of a
[19:07] board meeting to decide this or that the
[19:10] other it just comes in its simplicity
[19:12] and humility not even william branham
[19:19] this is untouched by william branham
[19:24] if you have a revelation this is this is
[19:26] his kingdom coming to us again and we
[19:28] know he always brings it through a
[19:30] vessel we understand that but it's still
[19:32] untouched by man's hands it comes pure
[19:35] can you say amen i ask you what is this
[19:37] baby that you're holding what is this
[19:39] message that you're holding i'll tell
[19:41] you it's god's kingdom coming back to
[19:43] the earth again
[19:44] and the reason we know that he had to
[19:46] come back this way is because our
[19:48] condition in the last days got away from
[19:51] him again
[19:54] what about all the conditions of
[19:56] laodicea what about all the conditions
[19:58] of our world i'm going to talk about it
[19:59] today just a little bit look at the
[20:01] condition of the world that we're in
[20:03] look where we're at even different from
[20:05] the 60s when this word was birthed back
[20:07] to us again look at where we're at today
[20:10] first of all none of us expected to be
[20:12] here but we're still here look at the
[20:13] condition that we're in
[20:16] trust politicians
[20:19] can't trust anything
[20:21] lie through their teeth
[20:26] this message
[20:27] this word
[20:28] is exactly what we needed
[20:32] praise the lord
[20:35] untouched by denominations and politics
[20:37] virgin
[20:39] i asked you this morning again what is
[20:40] it that you're holding
[20:42] or are you even holding it
[20:45] but if you're holding it
[20:47] what are you holding
[20:49] when we see the state that we're in and
[20:52] and we see the conditions of the world
[20:54] then the believers start to get to
[20:56] seeking
[20:57] and they don't stop at the son of man
[21:00] they don't stop at the son of david
[21:02] our text shows that them doing this in
[21:04] the last days they're seeking the lord
[21:06] and seeking
[21:09] david
[21:10] the king
[21:12] because
[21:13] because
[21:15] he is all three
[21:17] and we must seek all three
[21:22] i'm going to say something just to us
[21:23] this morning that i'm seeking more than
[21:26] just
[21:27] the theme
[21:28] that god sent a prophet
[21:31] son of man
[21:33] my heart i'm saying that i'm not
[21:34] intellectually doing it my heart is
[21:36] seeking more than that
[21:39] my heart is seeking more than son of god
[21:41] which the prophet said was the holy
[21:43] spirit and the people for two thousand
[21:45] years the holy ghost and the people
[21:46] invisible god invisible in the people
[21:48] but it was the spirit of god and so now
[21:51] it's a baptism in the holy ghost the
[21:53] true baptism of holy ghost and i've had
[21:55] that for years if you don't have that
[21:57] seek the lord for it can you say amen
[21:59] but my heart is seeking more than just
[22:01] having services to encourage just the
[22:04] baptism of the holy ghost my heart is
[22:06] seeking more than just a healing another
[22:09] healing line we're not here just to
[22:11] reinvent another temp meeting from the
[22:13] pentecostal days we're not here to
[22:15] repeat azusa street we're we're seeking
[22:18] something deeper there's more in this
[22:20] message than just a baptism of the holy
[22:22] ghost that is not the end
[22:26] is that okay with everybody
[22:29] we have to be seeking more because there
[22:31] is more and it's not that we're seeking
[22:33] something that's not in there it lays in
[22:35] there can you say amen and so we can
[22:37] create any kind of atmosphere we want to
[22:39] create anything but my emphasis as a
[22:42] pastor my emphasis is not just to have
[22:45] another repeat of pentecost and work up
[22:48] in motion and or try to bring an
[22:49] atmosphere just just to preach the
[22:52] baptism of the holy ghost because we
[22:54] have that but we have something more
[22:56] that god is bringing us all to
[22:59] individually
[23:04] i'm seeking for the character of the
[23:05] king
[23:11] you can preach the people under any
[23:12] expectations
[23:15] can you say amen
[23:18] but we have to really pray that we make
[23:20] sure we preach the people under the
[23:21] right expectations
[23:25] amen help me lord
[23:27] so look at the conditions again
[23:29] being without a really a revealer of
[23:33] truth let's look at the conditions back
[23:35] here again
[23:37] the israel had done meant it said went
[23:40] many days without certain things
[23:43] they had many
[23:44] went many days i think that's very
[23:46] significant they went many days without
[23:49] a king and many days without a prince
[23:51] without a sacrifice
[23:53] and so
[23:54] conditions increase to be worse when
[23:57] you're without a revealer and without
[24:00] the things that are needed and things
[24:03] that are uh you know when you're without
[24:05] something for so long
[24:07] but then god starts to show what you
[24:09] need
[24:10] then then you know it's kind of like
[24:12] when you're without something you
[24:14] appreciate
[24:16] the real thing when it comes
[24:19] so it's not so mad
[24:21] you know i don't want to beat anybody
[24:23] over the head for being through a season
[24:25] of your life when when you got distant
[24:28] or you're without things and you get
[24:30] maybe you got really distant from the
[24:32] essential things god's given us in this
[24:34] age you got real distant for there's
[24:36] there's one good thing that comes out of
[24:38] it is you see a the law of contrast
[24:43] how this morning would we ever
[24:45] appreciate a godly
[24:47] woman and many of them sitting here
[24:49] godly
[24:50] not just dress godly but just godly in
[24:53] their character and just so many things
[24:56] how would we appreciate that more if we
[24:59] didn't see the kind of women that are
[25:01] out there today every day in front of us
[25:04] brothers how many of you raise your hand
[25:05] when you see and when you've come from
[25:07] the world and you knew women and maybe
[25:09] you were with women and you've seen all
[25:11] the wrong side of it then you come
[25:13] around the body of christ and you you
[25:15] start to get a greater appreciation
[25:18] a greater value can you say amen because
[25:21] you were without being able to see a
[25:23] godly woman but now you can see it and
[25:26] now you value it more i wonder sometimes
[25:29] if we don't value that enough amongst
[25:30] our own congregation i wonder if our
[25:32] husbands we don't appreciate our godly
[25:34] wives enough to realize if you had a
[25:36] contrast you'd see she's a she has a lot
[25:39] more in her than what you realize you
[25:41] can look at her weaknesses you can look
[25:42] at all of her downsides and she can look
[25:45] at yours and you can nitpick at them but
[25:47] when we step back and look at things we
[25:50] can say praise the lord there they got
[25:53] something in them that the world didn't
[25:55] give and the world can't take away
[26:00] we have to see the value of what we got
[26:02] and some people they have to see a
[26:05] contrast to see
[26:07] what what the wisdom of this world does
[26:09] to you what the fashions of this world
[26:11] does to you
[26:12] what the friends of the world can do to
[26:15] you
[26:16] i'm just saying
[26:19] and so it's not so bad that we see
[26:22] as israel they were without things they
[26:24] were without the lamb they were without
[26:26] true worship they were without a king
[26:28] they were without leadership they were
[26:30] without and you go enough being without
[26:32] the right things
[26:35] then all of a sudden if you're of god
[26:36] you start to seek the right thing
[26:39] and that's all god needs
[26:42] i've seen that
[26:45] i've seen enough of it
[26:47] i'm seeking something different
[26:50] and that's all god needs can you say
[26:51] amen
[26:54] that can encourage you to seek when we
[26:55] see a contrast when you see a holy girl
[26:58] holy woman
[26:59] we can take it for granted sometimes
[27:01] among ourselves but when you've been
[27:03] around the wrong kind of woman your
[27:04] whole life you value a real
[27:07] woman of god
[27:09] and i'll say it again we have so many
[27:11] that's here this morning young and old
[27:14] that are holding up the banner of true
[27:17] genuine dignity of true womanhood these
[27:20] are these are not
[27:23] these are not just some
[27:26] criticism of some cultist thing
[27:28] this is what god intended for women to
[27:31] be
[27:32] and god bless every one of you sisters
[27:35] that are holding that up in this
[27:36] generation god bless you
[27:38] [Applause]
[27:43] but look how long they were without all
[27:46] their connection to god
[27:49] and
[27:51] the lamb the king and then there was
[27:52] some some bad things that they tried to
[27:55] connect with
[27:57] so let me just show you something here
[27:58] okay get your bibles
[28:00] and the days of judges is a great
[28:02] example of being without a lot of things
[28:05] they were so far away from god and
[28:07] incidentally
[28:09] i'd like to turn to judges 17 first
[28:11] incidentally
[28:12] god still blessed them during this time
[28:14] to give them judges
[28:17] not necessarily prophets or kings they
[28:19] were without a king now
[28:21] and
[28:22] god
[28:24] gave them
[28:25] when they cried out to the lord god gave
[28:27] them temporary deliverance through
[28:29] judges
[28:30] god gave them temporary deliverance
[28:33] but not major prophets
[28:35] not kings
[28:38] just ordinary people god raised up in
[28:41] joshua's judge's day judges 17 and you
[28:45] find a couple examples here
[28:48] that show that the people were without
[28:50] they were without if you go through the
[28:52] whole book of judges he temporarily
[28:54] provided judges and deliverers
[28:57] but they were basically without and and
[28:59] don't forget it's great that god
[29:01] provides temporary deliverance but we
[29:04] don't just want temporary deliverance
[29:07] the days of judges god in his grace gave
[29:09] temporary deliverers
[29:11] but no king
[29:13] no major profit
[29:16] so no matter how good the temporary
[29:18] deliverance was
[29:20] they would ultimately need
[29:23] a major profit
[29:25] and a major king leadership
[29:28] how many would admit this morning no
[29:30] matter how good a temporary deliverance
[29:32] is i'd rather have a total deliverance
[29:35] than a temporary deliverance
[29:38] because that can only go for so long and
[29:40] get the end of the judges and you look
[29:41] judges chapter 17 verse one there was a
[29:43] man of mount ephraim whose name was
[29:45] micah micah and he said unto his mother
[29:48] the eleven hundred shekels of silver
[29:49] that were taken from the about which
[29:51] thou cursed us and spake us also in thy
[29:53] ears behold the silver is with me i took
[29:55] it and his mother said blessed be thou
[29:57] this lord my son very religious here and
[30:00] when he had restored the 1100 shackles
[30:02] of his mother his mother said i have
[30:05] wholly dedicated the silver unto the
[30:07] lord from my hand for my son to make a
[30:10] graven image and a molten image now
[30:12] therefore i will restore it unto thee
[30:14] now notice
[30:15] have no graven image before thee i
[30:18] thought the commandment said
[30:20] but they are so far away from god and so
[30:23] hungry for something from god
[30:26] the mom is willing to take this money
[30:29] and make and buy and have them make a
[30:31] molten graven image within her home
[30:34] yet he restored the money unto his
[30:36] mother verse 4 and his mother took 200
[30:38] shekels of silver and gave them to the
[30:39] founder who made there of a graven image
[30:42] and a molten image and they were in the
[30:44] house of micah and the my man micah had
[30:47] a house of gods and made made in ephod
[30:50] you remember our texts
[30:52] and a terrifying remember our text and
[30:55] con consecrated one of his sons who
[30:57] became his priest
[31:01] now is this right
[31:03] no
[31:05] but it comes from this
[31:08] state that they are in
[31:10] without a prophet without a king without
[31:13] a connection to god and be careful
[31:16] friends of what you turn to or what you
[31:19] try to create on your own to try to get
[31:22] a temporary satisfaction that i'm
[31:24] connecting with god
[31:26] you don't have to do that
[31:30] this morning
[31:31] every one of you do not have to go
[31:34] through any priest or anybody
[31:37] to talk to the king
[31:41] when we in this service and you bring
[31:42] your heart before god you have a direct
[31:45] line to the king of kings you are
[31:47] speaking directly to him
[31:50] you don't need a graven image you don't
[31:52] need a
[31:53] you don't need a quote book to talk to
[31:55] god can you say man you don't even need
[31:57] your bible we love our bibles we read
[31:59] them it helps us can you say amen but a
[32:01] bible is just a helper to come to a
[32:04] revelation and to know the king
[32:06] you don't have to go through that or use
[32:08] a crutch you can come directly to him
[32:14] praise the lord so
[32:16] they made up these graven images and
[32:18] they did it in the home and boy we could
[32:20] preach a long time about how people find
[32:23] their own religious stuff online
[32:27] to make them feel better and ditch
[32:30] the message
[32:33] i know i'm being straight with you and i
[32:34] know i'm being straight i know that i'm
[32:36] doing that
[32:38] because this in the bible speaks of many
[32:40] of us sometimes
[32:42] who out of a a desire
[32:46] create our own thing
[32:50] when you don't have to
[32:52] it's just the condition you're so far
[32:54] away micah you're so far away
[32:57] that
[32:58] and look at verse six here's the problem
[33:00] here's the problem in those days
[33:03] there was no king in israel
[33:06] but every man
[33:07] did that which was right
[33:09] in his own eyes
[33:11] even though god was around to bring
[33:13] temporary deliverance
[33:15] the condition was there's no key
[33:19] they got away from the leadership
[33:21] and so they're so far away that they
[33:24] don't even know how far away they are
[33:26] so this condition they bring a graven
[33:28] image they set up their own priests i'll
[33:30] take one of my sons and make him a
[33:31] preacher
[33:35] i'll do what needs to be done
[33:37] he's not called but i'll call him
[33:39] because we just have this need
[33:42] and they didn't have to do that
[33:46] look what it says in chapter 18 and
[33:48] verse 1 in those days
[33:51] chapter 18 there was no king in israel
[33:54] and in those days the tribe of the
[33:56] danites saw them in an inheritance to
[33:58] dwell in
[34:00] so that's that's all i want just to
[34:01] catch the theme chapter 19 and verse 1
[34:04] and it came to pass in those days
[34:06] this is the days without a king
[34:09] this is days that maybe you've had in
[34:11] your life this is days without
[34:16] how many can raise your hand if not
[34:18] physically but in your heart
[34:20] i've been in these days before
[34:23] i've been
[34:24] probably from my own choices
[34:27] i've lived through the days without
[34:30] and i don't want to be there anymore
[34:34] they came to ask in those days when
[34:36] there was no king in israel that there
[34:38] was a certain levite sojourn on the side
[34:40] of the mountain and ephraim and all
[34:41] these things go into little stories at
[34:43] the end of judges of the people but the
[34:45] real issue is there was no king and so
[34:47] they were just trying to do everything
[34:48] they could with the levites and priests
[34:50] and graven images and everything they
[34:52] could do to try to try to create
[34:54] something and it just speaks sometimes
[34:56] of our nature getting in the way our old
[34:58] nature getting in the way to try to come
[35:00] up with something new or try to come up
[35:02] with something that that we just feel uh
[35:05] the thing and we've just done a message
[35:06] on on on guilt and even guilt even guilt
[35:10] satan's guilt can make us do things and
[35:12] try to create things and try to do
[35:14] things to relieve our own guilt
[35:16] and yet all the time god is saying i'll
[35:19] take care of your guilt
[35:22] don't come up with something new i'll
[35:24] take care of it i've washed your sins
[35:26] away and even the feeling of guilt if
[35:29] you'll get in my peace and in my word
[35:31] and you'll stay just in that channel you
[35:33] can rest and you don't have to live with
[35:36] the guilt from the enemy
[35:40] turn with me to second chronicles
[35:42] chapter 15. one more example of the
[35:44] people
[35:45] so far away second chronicles 15.
[35:52] ii chronicles 15 and verse 3
[35:55] now for a long season israel
[35:59] hath been without the true god and
[36:01] without a teaching priest and without
[36:05] law wow
[36:07] all the things god provided for them
[36:10] and for for a long season they had been
[36:13] without it without the true god without
[36:16] a teaching priest
[36:17] without the law
[36:20] but when they in their trouble did turn
[36:21] into the lord of israel and sought him
[36:23] he was found of them and in those times
[36:26] there was no peace to him that went out
[36:28] nor to him that came in but great
[36:31] vacations were upon all the inhabitants
[36:34] of the countries and nation was
[36:35] destroyed of nation city of city for god
[36:38] did vex them with all adversity so
[36:41] here's another element of it all right
[36:43] if you're without god and you're not
[36:46] getting anywhere where god is and you're
[36:48] without a teaching priest with
[36:51] maybe you're
[36:52] chose to be without the five full
[36:54] ministry in your life without the true
[36:56] ministers of the gospel without the law
[36:59] away from the word
[37:02] you're going to start feeling
[37:05] vexation of spirit
[37:12] so this is another thing that wow you
[37:14] know
[37:16] it's one thing to step away a little bit
[37:18] it's another thing to deal with vexation
[37:20] of spirit which is the state of being
[37:23] annoyed or frustrated
[37:25] or worried
[37:28] torment is the other word
[37:31] now friends we are not called to live in
[37:33] torment
[37:36] okay
[37:37] i have been well i i
[37:40] i know all those things annoyed
[37:42] frustrated
[37:44] worried
[37:45] tormented
[37:47] been there
[37:48] done that got the t-shirt
[37:52] been there and incidentally i might say
[37:54] to you those who experience these things
[37:56] you'd be surprised how sometimes the
[37:58] person next to you is experiencing some
[38:00] of the same things
[38:06] sometimes as the devil doesn't like us
[38:07] and he's given us a greater battle to
[38:09] make us question who we are to make us
[38:11] question our position and so he tries to
[38:13] make you overly annoyed or worried about
[38:15] things that's the devil's work but
[38:18] sometimes sometimes it's that we're not
[38:21] exposing ourselves enough to the true
[38:23] god to the true priesthood to the true
[38:26] things god has provided in the end time
[38:28] in order to drive away those torments
[38:31] can you say amen do you realize that
[38:34] while i'm preaching this morning that i
[38:35] can cast out devils while i'm preaching
[38:39] i don't have to have a big prayer line
[38:41] and i'm not knocking that sometimes we
[38:43] need to do that but i don't have to do
[38:44] it while i'm preaching the word the
[38:46] devil's afraid of this word the enemy's
[38:48] afraid can you say amen like our brother
[38:50] kyle said this morning they're afraid of
[38:52] us can you say amen they're begging for
[38:55] mercy this morning while this word it's
[38:57] not paul lafontaine but this word is all
[39:01] powerful against the demonic realm and
[39:03] whether that's depression or worry or
[39:06] fear
[39:07] this word that i'm preaching demons
[39:09] scatter from it
[39:12] you got to realize that
[39:14] they're crying for mercy right now
[39:18] the devil's whispering to you why did
[39:20] you come today why did you come i told
[39:22] you not to come there why did you come
[39:24] i'm begging for mercy get up right now
[39:26] you got to go to the bathroom or
[39:27] something get up get out of here get out
[39:29] as quick as you can they're crying for
[39:31] mercy
[39:32] not because of this fat preacher but
[39:34] because this word
[39:36] this word that i'm holding
[39:38] is god's answer for depression and fear
[39:41] it is god's answer for vexation of
[39:44] spirit he has provided all the
[39:46] atmosphere i need to be
[39:49] at peace
[39:52] and he's provided that for you this
[39:54] morning
[39:55] this is the prince of peace
[39:57] this is the king of peace
[40:01] this word that we hold had his presence
[40:03] in it and he provides the peace and when
[40:07] the people turn to the lord look what
[40:09] happens now after he says god did vex
[40:12] them with all adversity and great
[40:13] vexations we could spend a lot more time
[40:15] on that but why was it they lost their
[40:17] connection to god that's our day and the
[40:20] king becomes the answer but verse 7 says
[40:22] be strong therefore and let not your
[40:24] hands be weak for your work shall be
[40:25] rewarded and when asa
[40:28] heard these words and the prophecy of
[40:30] obed the prophet he took courage and put
[40:32] away the abominable idols out of the
[40:34] land of judah and benjamin and out of
[40:36] the cities which he had taken from mount
[40:38] rey from and renew the altar of the lord
[40:40] that was before the porch of the lord
[40:42] and he gathered all judah and benjamin
[40:44] and the strangers with them out of
[40:45] ephraim and manasseh and out of the
[40:46] simeon for they fell to him out of
[40:49] israel in abundance when they saw that
[40:51] the lord his god was with him who was
[40:53] god with a king that loved god and and
[40:57] who said let's get rid of the idols
[40:59] let's get rid of the graven images let's
[41:01] get together and create an atmosphere
[41:04] here we're all in this together
[41:06] they needed a king and they got the
[41:08] right king the answer was a king a godly
[41:11] king
[41:12] [Applause]
[41:14] yep
[41:16] so they gather themselves together
[41:18] that's why we come to church
[41:20] thank you for being here this morning
[41:22] because no matter what the devil's been
[41:24] trying to tell you
[41:25] i believe that just being in the
[41:28] presence of the licks of fire can be
[41:31] helpful to you this morning don't ever
[41:33] stop coming
[41:35] find a church of your choice find
[41:37] somewhere where the presence of god is
[41:39] moving and you're getting fed and be
[41:41] there
[41:43] be there
[41:44] they gather themselves together at
[41:45] jerusalem in the third month in the 15th
[41:46] year of the age of 8 sorry i'm finishing
[41:48] this but i just want you to see what the
[41:50] king did and they offered unto the lord
[41:51] the same time of the spoil which had
[41:53] brought 700 oxen and 7 000 sheep and
[41:56] they entered into a covenant to seek the
[41:58] lord god of their fathers with all their
[42:01] heart and with all their soul what's it
[42:03] about seeking
[42:07] that whosoever would not seek the lord
[42:08] of god should be put to death whether
[42:11] great or small whether man or woman now
[42:13] that's kind of a forced thing and i
[42:15] wouldn't go for that because it has to
[42:16] be in your heart but i will make the
[42:17] point that whosoever would not seek the
[42:20] lord
[42:21] there was death and i'll just say that
[42:23] respectfully if you don't say lord put
[42:25] something in my heart to seek more of
[42:26] you
[42:27] spiritual death happens
[42:31] this is important
[42:34] not for just me or the word pro or next
[42:36] to you but for you personally that i'm
[42:38] going to seek the lord and the bible
[42:39] says if we draw nigh to him he will draw
[42:42] nigh to us that's just it but what about
[42:44] all the stuff that i need what about
[42:45] stuff i can't figure out what about the
[42:46] stuff that i don't want to do yet it
[42:48] just says draw nigh to him
[42:50] seek him
[42:51] [Music]
[42:52] he'll figure it all out for you
[42:55] and they swear unto the lord with a loud
[42:56] voice with shouting with trumpets and
[42:59] with cornets
[43:02] i never thought of that about about that
[43:03] josiah
[43:05] we got the cornets here this morning
[43:11] good to have you
[43:12] amen
[43:14] the shouting the trumpets this is pretty
[43:17] this isn't just a
[43:19] just a formal
[43:20] confession this is seeking the lord
[43:24] bring the instruments in
[43:25] bring the very best bring the worship in
[43:28] jump right in
[43:31] why we're seeking the lord
[43:34] praise be to god i'm feeling good this
[43:37] morning
[43:38] some of you are waking up and it's great
[43:39] man i can see you woke up
[43:41] and all judah rejoiced at the oath for
[43:44] they had sworn with all their heart and
[43:45] sought him with their whole desire and
[43:47] he was found of them and the lord gave
[43:49] them rest round about and also
[43:51] concerning menika the mother of ace of
[43:53] the king he removed her from being queen
[43:55] because she was one that was messing up
[43:56] he moved removed his own mom
[43:59] because she had made an idol in the
[44:00] grove
[44:03] yeah
[44:04] sometimes family members can get in the
[44:06] way
[44:07] of you seeking the lord
[44:10] sometimes mama's not being that great of
[44:12] a blessing to you
[44:15] what a terrible thing to say after
[44:17] christmas day
[44:22] but be alert
[44:23] this is your own personal walk with god
[44:26] this guy had to remove his mom
[44:29] from being in that position because he
[44:31] was influencing the country the wrong
[44:33] way
[44:35] asa cut down her idol and stamped it and
[44:38] burned it at the brook kid run but the
[44:40] high gates were not taken out of israel
[44:41] nevertheless the heart of asa was
[44:44] perfect all of his days
[44:47] praise be to god you know what the
[44:48] answer was a godly king
[44:52] we'll stop these idols we'll go through
[44:54] our home
[44:55] we're getting rid of this stuff that
[44:57] brings vexations
[45:01] we're going to be we're going to choose
[45:02] by the holy ghost what movies to watch
[45:04] and what not to watch
[45:10] we're going to choose by the holy ghost
[45:11] and not by our own feelings
[45:15] we're going to be very choosy here
[45:17] because you know a graven image is a
[45:19] graven image and
[45:21] it's a vision and it's a television and
[45:24] that can bring the television is not the
[45:26] problem it's the images that are on the
[45:29] television graven images that our heart
[45:33] seeks after
[45:34] come on somebody this is the hour you
[45:36] live in
[45:38] and let's talk about the computer oh
[45:39] let's never mind the commuter let's talk
[45:41] about your phone
[45:43] let's talk about the graven images on
[45:45] your phone this morning
[45:49] but when aza the king came the people
[45:51] responded and said we're going to crush
[45:53] these things we're going to get them out
[45:54] of our lives the wrong images were going
[45:57] to crush the image part of it because
[45:59] why this thing has brought us to
[46:01] vexation of spirit
[46:04] this thing has not brought us closer to
[46:06] god this thing is only taking me further
[46:09] away from god so why do you keep doing
[46:12] it if it's taking you away from god i
[46:14] don't know that your neighbor doesn't
[46:16] know that nobody knows only you know
[46:17] that but if you're honest this thing's
[46:19] taken me away from my god it is time to
[46:22] crush that image because i'm seeking god
[46:26] i'm through with this thing i'm i'm done
[46:29] with this thing
[46:33] i won't read the statistics but look at
[46:35] all the science coming out now
[46:38] about social media and the effect on
[46:40] teenagers in every age but especially on
[46:42] young teens to where even some of the
[46:44] experts are saying parents you have got
[46:47] to limit this the the result of this is
[46:50] not turning out good
[46:54] and the bible's saying it all along
[46:56] have no
[46:58] other image before you
[47:03] i would say
[47:05] if you draw away from that
[47:08] social media
[47:10] and be be use the holy ghost to choose
[47:14] what's encouraging and what's right
[47:17] i say if you draw away
[47:19] you might have less and less and less
[47:23] vexation
[47:27] and depression
[47:29] i know some of you were happier without
[47:31] it when we didn't have it 20 years ago
[47:34] or whenever it was whenever it came
[47:36] you were just free or you were happier
[47:39] i'm just telling you
[47:42] something has affected us
[47:46] this is about seeking the lord
[47:49] while he may be found
[47:52] you know i like preaching this because i
[47:54] know
[47:55] that every person here i believe with
[47:57] all my heart already has the desire
[48:00] to seek more of the lord
[48:03] god put that there
[48:05] god created that in there
[48:08] lebron said to a woman in the back she
[48:09] went back to prayed for and went in the
[48:11] back she sat down
[48:14] and she's just praying beside another
[48:16] woman another woman is just praying
[48:19] about this certain need it's hidden you
[48:20] know she's praying for it
[48:22] she's just speak to the lord and the
[48:25] prophet says back to her what she's
[48:27] saying to the lord
[48:28] he says
[48:29] don't forget sister you speak it don't
[48:32] forget
[48:32] it's god that created in you
[48:36] that desire to say that and desire that
[48:41] use the word create because he's the
[48:42] creator
[48:45] he's not creating the moon and the stars
[48:48] now he's done with that
[48:50] he's creating in his people
[48:53] his kingdom
[48:55] you he's creating it
[48:59] now does this kingdom come slow or does
[49:01] it come fast
[49:02] it always comes slow
[49:05] it's never fast enough
[49:09] how long did it take jesus to get here
[49:13] how long did the
[49:14] conditions go on in egypt before god
[49:17] sent a prophet
[49:19] how long sometimes will god allow your
[49:22] situation to go and go and go and go
[49:25] until he steps on the scene
[49:30] be patient the answer's coming
[49:35] amen praise the lord
[49:38] look at our conditions here at christmas
[49:44] look at our
[49:45] fear-driven world
[49:48] no wonder we have some fears because we
[49:50] have a fear-driven
[49:52] world
[49:53] fear-driven media a fear-driven
[49:57] presidency
[49:59] all due respect friends
[50:02] the first of the year we'll probably go
[50:03] off of facebook and go off of youtube
[50:05] because i get sometimes the alert that
[50:08] we're going to be scanned more and more
[50:10] and flagged
[50:15] but i just want to let this congregation
[50:16] know
[50:17] we may do that and we'll just have our
[50:18] archives on our website but i am not
[50:21] afraid
[50:23] to continue
[50:24] to speak the truth
[50:28] i am not afraid
[50:35] i will not be intimidated
[50:37] by the condition and the fear of this
[50:39] world
[50:40] i want to say it like it is
[50:43] we have a fear-driven leadership in our
[50:45] country
[50:51] remember that's respectful to everyone's
[50:53] personal
[50:54] choice of what they do and how they
[50:57] live that's that's all but in this
[51:00] pulpit we want to have the liberty to
[51:02] speak are they going to come and scan it
[51:05] anyway someday or they come possibly and
[51:07] take me to jail
[51:09] probably
[51:11] but until they do
[51:13] i want the liberty in my heart
[51:15] to call things what they are
[51:18] through through only the spirit of the
[51:20] lord
[51:21] look at the conditions look at look at
[51:23] the alternatives to christendom to cause
[51:25] a person to to to leave truth and go to
[51:28] some alternative
[51:30] i can serve god my own way
[51:32] look at the woke the woke culture look
[51:35] at the cancel culture woke is in a way
[51:38] it started as an awareness to injustices
[51:40] in this world now it's not
[51:42] the meaning is not an awareness of the
[51:45] injustice it's an acting upon injustices
[51:48] in other words it's turned into violence
[51:51] in other words there's injustices in
[51:53] this world which they've always been
[51:56] because their people are without god
[51:58] and the people are just waking up to it
[52:00] not really not christian christians have
[52:01] all been awake to the injustice of the
[52:02] world people wake up but it's not good
[52:04] enough just to wake up to it it's to
[52:06] take things in your own hands to become
[52:08] violent about it to disagree about it
[52:10] never have we been in a time with more
[52:12] division and more disagreement and more
[52:14] disrespectful things being said to one
[52:17] another on social media and around this
[52:18] world disrespect for the president
[52:20] cussing at the president i think it's a
[52:22] shame that we've come to this but
[52:24] remember it's the spirit of our nation
[52:26] woke is not just some new movement it's
[52:29] the spirit that's on the people
[52:32] and we just have to make sure we don't
[52:34] take that spirit
[52:37] the woke culture has become council
[52:39] culture and that means now that you if
[52:41] you if somebody said something wrong 20
[52:43] years ago i can cancel you i'm canceling
[52:46] you i'm canceling this show i'm
[52:48] canceling this the problem with that
[52:50] spirit if you go with it is is as
[52:52] unbelievers will start canceling the
[52:54] word of god and start canceling if there
[52:56] was a prophet in this day and start
[52:58] canceling the message because they have
[53:00] a right to i'm just canceling there's
[53:02] been a lot of people that's just
[53:03] canceled me i'm canceling you because i
[53:05] can
[53:06] i don't have to listen to you anymore
[53:10] what do you say in this world because
[53:11] this is my heart this is a spirit in our
[53:13] nation
[53:15] we are not called to take the spirit of
[53:17] our nation
[53:19] we're called
[53:20] to a completely different kingdom
[53:24] is that okay
[53:27] if you study real hard the statistics
[53:29] will show that real change and decline
[53:32] in our country was mostly in the 1960s
[53:34] it began it was building up but a real
[53:37] change came in the 60s
[53:39] the spirit of the last days took the
[53:41] people
[53:43] but i'm happy to say
[53:44] during the same time we received
[53:46] something
[53:50] we receive a kingdom
[53:52] that cannot be removed
[53:54] we received not another reformer not a
[53:57] man but another kingdom and when we
[53:59] received it it means the king is
[54:01] speaking we receive the son of man we
[54:03] receive the son of god but we receive
[54:05] the son of david as well can you say
[54:07] amen
[54:08] and so we're just in transition i'm
[54:10] going to read a couple quotes and i'm
[54:11] going to finish just now
[54:13] i appreciate your attention this morning
[54:15] how many would want to say i want a
[54:17] greater seeking of the lord
[54:19] and the king david
[54:23] just to be in harmony here with
[54:26] the seeking the king
[54:28] the first quote he says but what we have
[54:30] today what have we got today with our
[54:32] own voting and politics and things we
[54:34] set the system that we run from and made
[54:37] a nation out of it here we've brought it
[54:39] back in here because it's the desire of
[54:41] the people and of course he's referring
[54:42] to the voting being manipulated in the
[54:45] 60s when it come to uh john f kennedy
[54:48] and these different things and friends
[54:50] if if there had proof of voting being
[54:52] manipulated back then
[54:54] then i i would say it's still happening
[54:56] today
[54:59] but now
[55:00] and then he says this right now i'm
[55:03] neither democrat or republican i'm a
[55:06] christian
[55:07] the whole thing is polluted i cast my
[55:09] vote on jesus christ amen on this rock
[55:12] i'll stand all other grounds is sinking
[55:14] sand
[55:15] yes sir friends we are not promised a
[55:18] system jesus wouldn't have nothing to do
[55:20] with the system we wasn't promised a
[55:23] system we were promised what he was he
[55:25] promised what was it he promised a
[55:27] kingdom

[56:36] has given us is separate than any system
[56:39] of this world don't ever compare it
[56:42] don't ever try to bring it together
[56:43] don't try to figure it out that way we
[56:46] received a completely different baby

[57:40] the presence of the king
[57:43] praise the lord
[57:45] the last one here says like a man and a
[57:47] woman they're both human beings but a
[57:48] woman has a different characteristic to
[57:51] a man
[57:52] i was reading here some time ago about
[57:54] solomon and the queen i've never got
[57:56] around to preaching my little text here
[57:57] to you on the queen of the south coming
[57:59] up to see solomon and seeing the gift of
[58:02] discernment i was reading about that
[58:04] here not long ago and they said
[58:06] that one of the puzzles that was put
[58:07] before solomon
[58:09] was this queen
[58:12] took a woman or a woman rather and
[58:14] dressed them like a man
[58:18] now that was foreign in that day but it
[58:20] is certainly up to date today
[58:23] this is in a history book that brother
[58:24] bran read of one of the tests that they
[58:26] gave solomon the woman of the south
[58:31] and
[58:32] i know
[58:33] he says now that was foreign in the day
[58:35] but it's certainly up to date today and
[58:36] you know that's wrong the bible said
[58:38] that a woman shouldn't do that it's
[58:39] abomination for a woman to put on a
[58:41] garment pertains to a man the
[58:43] unchangeable god said that's true so
[58:45] that is true so we find out that solomon
[58:47] no more than watched them
[58:49] he had them to walk or do something and
[58:51] immediately he says it's a woman
[58:53] he's dressed like a man
[58:56] so he could tell
[58:58] by the characteristic of that woman the
[59:00] way she handled herself that she was a
[59:04] woman
[59:05] and not a man
[59:07] well the country has certainly lost the
[59:09] discernment of solomon
[59:13] the government has lost the discernment
[59:17] of solomon common sense discernment can
[59:20] you say amen
[59:23] and they are known there by their
[59:25] characteristic one acts like a woman
[59:28] one acts like a man and if you dress
[59:31] them different hello
[59:33] wake up and smell the coffee
[59:35] they're not different
[59:37] i mean they're not you know they're not
[59:39] you can't make a man a woman or a woman
[59:40] a man
[59:42] how perverted and pitiful
[59:45] do we have efforts of
[59:48] laws being changed
[59:50] but put a man as a
[59:52] olympic swimmer
[59:55] competing with girls because he says
[59:58] he's a girl
[1:00:01] and he's beating all the other women and
[1:00:03] people are complaining in the government
[1:00:05] and all the officials say
[1:00:08] but if he says it
[1:00:10] he is
[1:00:12] what a world we live in
[1:00:15] what is shame
[1:00:16] but brother abraham's point here is that
[1:00:18] you can tell if you can't by the outside
[1:00:21] there's
[1:00:22] characteristics
[1:00:25] that make a woman a woman
[1:00:26] there's characteristics that make a man
[1:00:29] a man so we find out solomon no more
[1:00:31] than watched them he had them to walk or
[1:00:32] do something i mean he says that's a
[1:00:34] woman so he could tell by the
[1:00:35] characteristic of that woman the way she
[1:00:37] handled herself that she was woman and
[1:00:39] not man
[1:00:40] and then most anything that way it's the
[1:00:43] characteristics i might drop a little
[1:00:44] point here jesus said matthew 24. the
[1:00:46] characteristics of the spirit would be
[1:00:48] in the end time now somewhat in the last
[1:00:50] day alike in the last days so close that
[1:00:52] it would deceive the very elected if it
[1:00:54] was possible see they would just you
[1:00:56] take your hand and just hold it up see
[1:00:58] if you don't notice one of them looks
[1:01:00] like the other in another way but one of
[1:01:02] them is left and the other one is right
[1:01:03] that's the way the spirits are in the
[1:01:05] last day they are somewhat alike but
[1:01:08] they have a characteristic that
[1:01:10] identifies them one is right and the
[1:01:12] other one is wrong and it can't be it
[1:01:14] can be identified by its characteristic
[1:01:17] no matter how close the spirit of true
[1:01:19] christianity and false christianity no
[1:01:21] matter how close it looks on the outside
[1:01:24] the characteristics will tell the
[1:01:26] difference
[1:01:28] and we'll be able to tell the spirit of
[1:01:30] god can be identified by its
[1:01:32] characteristics see the spirit of god in
[1:01:34] the spirit of the church there is a
[1:01:36] church spirit and the spirit of god
[1:01:38] that's absolutely not like the church
[1:01:40] spirit at all there is a denominational
[1:01:43] spirit we don't want a church spirit can
[1:01:45] you say man we want the true spirit of
[1:01:48] god we don't want a denominational
[1:01:50] spirit we want the true spirit of god
[1:01:52] and they are different there's a
[1:01:53] national spirit there's a spirit of the
[1:01:55] nation
[1:01:57] here not long ago i was going with my
[1:01:59] wife when we still lived in indiana a
[1:02:01] couple years ago over to the little
[1:02:03] supermarket i just come home we had to
[1:02:05] get some food and on my road over there
[1:02:08] it was the summer time you might not
[1:02:09] believe it but we found a lady had a
[1:02:11] dress on and it was so strange it
[1:02:13] shocked me i said look at there that
[1:02:15] looks strange that woman is wearing a
[1:02:17] dress the rest of them was wearing
[1:02:19] clothing that not becoming to a woman
[1:02:21] and she and she said i said well that's
[1:02:23] just the american spirit see the spirit
[1:02:25] of america now the spirit of america is
[1:02:29] supposed to be a christian nation but
[1:02:31] the spirit of this nation is not
[1:02:34] christian
[1:02:35] can you take that this morning
[1:02:38] no no we're not a christian nation
[1:02:39] anymore
[1:02:41] and the spirit that motivates americans
[1:02:43] is not a christian spirit
[1:02:45] it's giving it's vanilla benevolent it's
[1:02:48] all that which is great i'm happy for
[1:02:50] giving people
[1:02:51] but
[1:02:52] that is always the spirit of america and
[1:02:55] the spirit of patriotism is not the
[1:02:57] spirit of god it's something different
[1:03:04] the spirit of america is supposed to be
[1:03:06] a christian nation but the spirit of
[1:03:07] this nation not christian might be
[1:03:08] called a christian nation but it's a
[1:03:09] million miles from it it's in 1964. so
[1:03:12] this woman said i said she said well
[1:03:15] aren't we
[1:03:16] his wife said to him next to him aren't
[1:03:18] we americans
[1:03:19] said i said no we live here this is our
[1:03:22] country we stay in it
[1:03:24] we love it it's the best nation in the
[1:03:27] world i say amen to all that
[1:03:29] but yet
[1:03:31] we're not americans
[1:03:37] i know what you'd say this morning but
[1:03:38] i'm an american i'm glad to be i'm proud
[1:03:40] to be america i'm proud to be
[1:03:45] i'm not knocking any of that i'm just
[1:03:46] saying what the prophet said by spirit
[1:03:49] by spirit
[1:03:50] we have to be something different than
[1:03:52] american
[1:03:54] you can't run it all together
[1:03:57] i think that happened a year ago when we
[1:03:58] had a different president people were so
[1:04:00] upset and all this because they thought
[1:04:02] you know trump is the answer and he's
[1:04:05] he's christian and he's all this stuff
[1:04:07] that's gonna
[1:04:09] stop judging things by politicians
[1:04:11] whether they be by nor trump
[1:04:14] look in the word of god and order your
[1:04:16] life by the word
[1:04:18] because brotherhood says it's all
[1:04:19] corrupt
[1:04:22] no trust in that
[1:04:24] the days that we have to live in peace
[1:04:26] as best we can i thank god for it every
[1:04:28] day i thank god that at night i don't
[1:04:30] hear a lot of noise around my house and
[1:04:32] stuff but i know enough to know the word
[1:04:34] that may all change someday
[1:04:37] our liberties may all change someday but
[1:04:39] i i certainly thank god for it now
[1:04:42] that we still have some liberties left
[1:04:44] to be able to serve god worship god
[1:04:47] not a lot of countries have that we are
[1:04:49] born so we we we are not americans i
[1:04:51] said we are born from above the holy
[1:04:53] spirit come down and we belong to a
[1:04:55] kingdom it's not of this world i said
[1:04:56] that's the reason that our sisters wear
[1:04:58] dresses
[1:05:00] wear long hair don't wear makeup
[1:05:04] remember he's talking to his wife about
[1:05:07] uh dress and things in this woman on the
[1:05:09] street wearing a dress he's trying to
[1:05:11] say we're from a different kingdom
[1:05:12] that's why we're expressing the image of
[1:05:13] a different kingdom that's why he says
[1:05:15] to do that but when he says we don't
[1:05:17] wear makeup we don't have we don't cut
[1:05:19] our hair we don't we wear dresses see
[1:05:22] their characteristics identifying this
[1:05:23] holiness unto the lord from above he's
[1:05:25] telling his wife that it's not just
[1:05:27] these quotes get read and all the time
[1:05:29] we think well you know that's the
[1:05:31] kingdom as ones that were wearing
[1:05:32] dresses is it's so much even more than
[1:05:34] that
[1:05:36] let's talk about the men can you say
[1:05:38] amen
[1:05:41] men who don't cheat on their taxes
[1:05:44] men who lead their ways in their homes
[1:05:46] in a godly way
[1:05:49] men who are not born to looking at other
[1:05:51] women and bound by some type of
[1:05:52] addiction
[1:05:56] we can preach about dresses all day long
[1:05:57] and it's the truth it's the reason god
[1:05:59] gave it to this thing is because we're
[1:06:01] from a different kingdom do you realize
[1:06:02] what he's saying there
[1:06:04] you realize what he's saying
[1:06:06] he's saying what i'm preaching is that
[1:06:08] when we receive this message
[1:06:11] it was god bringing another kingdom to
[1:06:13] us now we've got people walking on the
[1:06:14] face of the earth that's already
[1:06:16] expressing that kingdom god bless you
[1:06:18] for it but it's not just dresses and
[1:06:20] hair
[1:06:21] it's not just we don't wear makeup
[1:06:24] the beauty of a true godly woman
[1:06:26] doesn't need all this makeup
[1:06:32] you're too pretty to put that stuff on
[1:06:34] you're just too pretty
[1:06:36] because god made you beautiful
[1:06:38] don't question how god made you
[1:06:40] got a little blemish or something and
[1:06:42] you got to put a little something to
[1:06:43] cover your blemish
[1:06:45] go right ahead but don't paint yourself
[1:06:47] up like a barn
[1:06:48] because god's made you a lot prettier
[1:06:50] than what you're reading on the internet
[1:06:53] you're beautiful the way god made you
[1:06:55] is it okay for a pastor to say that i
[1:06:57] don't know
[1:07:00] god's eyes you're beautiful
[1:07:01] don't question it
[1:07:03] don't take your cues from the cosmos
[1:07:06] what's he saying this stuff is the
[1:07:08] kingdom of god coming back to us
[1:07:10] and it's just like men don't do this men
[1:07:13] don't do that well it's not do's and
[1:07:14] don'ts it's that we're from a different
[1:07:16] kingdom
[1:07:17] we're from a different kingdom
[1:07:19] therefore we are seeking a kingdom we
[1:07:22] are seeking a king to come and receive a
[1:07:24] subject to his kingdom and they are
[1:07:26] identified by their characteristics that
[1:07:28] their treasures
[1:07:30] everybody listening
[1:07:32] last quote and this is it they are
[1:07:34] identified
[1:07:35] but how do i tell the ones that are
[1:07:37] growing towards this millennium kingdom
[1:07:39] they're identified by their
[1:07:41] characteristics that their treasures are
[1:07:43] not of this earth or of this nation
[1:07:47] it's of above in glory
[1:07:50] your life
[1:07:53] this coming year
[1:07:55] our lives should say something
[1:08:00] not just our words but our lives say
[1:08:03] our characteristics say
[1:08:05] we're seeking
[1:08:06] another kingdom we're seeking
[1:08:09] a king
[1:08:11] the characteristics of our lives should
[1:08:13] show that he is coming and we are
[1:08:15] preparing for him and to show that he is
[1:08:17] coming we are showing the
[1:08:19] characteristics of the kingdom now it's
[1:08:22] not about young couples young men young
[1:08:26] women
[1:08:27] it's not about the treasures of this
[1:08:29] earth
[1:08:30] it's not about this nation and the
[1:08:32] politics
[1:08:33] we have a whole different kingdom
[1:08:38] praise the lord you've been quiet today
[1:08:42] and that's all right
[1:08:44] so this is a story here that i'm going
[1:08:46] to end with
[1:08:47] all the children want to be listening to
[1:08:48] this
[1:08:50] some children were in play in their
[1:08:52] playground one day
[1:08:55] when a herald rode through the town
[1:08:57] blowing a trumpet and crying aloud the
[1:08:59] king
[1:09:00] the king passes by the road today make
[1:09:03] ready for the king
[1:09:06] the children stopped their play and
[1:09:08] looked at one another
[1:09:09] did you hear that
[1:09:12] they said the king is coming
[1:09:14] he may look over the wall and see our
[1:09:15] playground
[1:09:17] who knows
[1:09:19] we must put it in order
[1:09:22] the king is coming
[1:09:24] all the kids decided
[1:09:26] to act upon the announcement that the
[1:09:29] king is coming to get our playground in
[1:09:32] order
[1:09:32] for the king
[1:09:35] the playground was sadly dirty and in
[1:09:37] the corners were scraps of paper and
[1:09:39] broken toys
[1:09:41] for these were careless children
[1:09:43] but now one brought a hole
[1:09:46] and another a rake and a third rand to
[1:09:48] fetch the wheelbarrow from behind the
[1:09:49] garden gate
[1:09:51] and they labored hard to let length all
[1:09:54] was clean and tidy
[1:09:57] now it is clean
[1:09:59] they said
[1:10:00] but we must make it pretty too
[1:10:02] for the kings are used to find things
[1:10:05] maybe he would not notice mere
[1:10:07] cleanliness
[1:10:08] for he may have it all the time
[1:10:11] maybe he will excuse me maybe he would
[1:10:13] not notice mere this for he may have it
[1:10:16] all the time then one brought sweet
[1:10:18] rushes and shrewed them in the ground
[1:10:22] and others made garlands of oak leaves
[1:10:24] and pine tassels and hung them on the
[1:10:26] walls and the littlest one pulled
[1:10:28] marigold buds and threw them all about
[1:10:30] the playground
[1:10:32] to make it look like gold for the king
[1:10:35] when all was done the playground was so
[1:10:37] beautiful that the children stood
[1:10:39] and looked at it and clapped their hands
[1:10:41] with pleasure
[1:10:44] let us keep it always
[1:10:46] like this
[1:10:49] said the littlest one
[1:10:52] and others cried yes yes that is what we
[1:10:55] will do let's keep it always
[1:10:58] like this
[1:11:00] they waited all day for the coming of
[1:11:02] the king but he never came
[1:11:04] only towards sunset a man
[1:11:06] with travel worn clothes and a kind
[1:11:09] tired face passed along the road and
[1:11:11] stopped to look over the wall
[1:11:14] what a pleasant place said the man
[1:11:16] may i come in and arrest your children
[1:11:19] the children brought him in gladly
[1:11:21] and set him on the seat that they had
[1:11:23] made out of the old cask
[1:11:25] they had covered it with old red cloak
[1:11:27] to make it look like a throne and it
[1:11:30] made a very good one
[1:11:31] let him sit there
[1:11:33] it is our playground they said we made
[1:11:35] it pretty for the king but he did not
[1:11:37] come and now we mean to keep it so for
[1:11:40] ourselves that is good said the men
[1:11:43] the man because we think
[1:11:46] they said because we
[1:11:48] because we think pretty and clean is
[1:11:50] nicer than ugly and
[1:11:52] dirty
[1:11:54] and the man said that is better
[1:11:56] and for tired people to rest in the
[1:11:58] littlest one said
[1:12:01] that is the best of all said the man
[1:12:04] he sat and rested and looked at the
[1:12:06] children with such kind eyes that they
[1:12:08] came about him
[1:12:09] told him all they knew
[1:12:12] about the five puppies in the barn
[1:12:14] and the thrush's nest and the four blue
[1:12:17] blue eggs
[1:12:18] with the four blue eggs and the shore
[1:12:20] where the gold shells grew and the man
[1:12:23] nodded and understood all about it
[1:12:26] by and by he asked for a cup of water
[1:12:28] and they brought it to him in the best
[1:12:30] cup
[1:12:31] with the gold sprigs on it
[1:12:33] then he thanked the children and rose
[1:12:35] and went on his way
[1:12:37] before but before he went he laid his
[1:12:39] hand on their heads for a moment and the
[1:12:41] touch
[1:12:42] went warm
[1:12:44] to their hearts
[1:12:46] the children stood by the wall
[1:12:48] and watched the man as he went slowly
[1:12:50] along
[1:12:51] the sun was setting and the light fell
[1:12:54] in long slanting rays across the road
[1:12:58] he looked so tired said one of the
[1:12:59] children he looked so tired
[1:13:03] but another said but he was so kind
[1:13:06] see
[1:13:07] said the littlest child see
[1:13:09] see how the sun shines
[1:13:12] on his hair
[1:13:14] it looks
[1:13:15] like a crown
[1:13:16] of gold
[1:13:20] jesus said insomuch as you've done it
[1:13:23] unto the least of my brethren
[1:13:25] you have done it unto me
[1:13:30] the word says some of entertain angels
[1:13:32] unaware
[1:13:36] so
[1:13:38] the kids
[1:13:39] prepared
[1:13:41] not only in their preparation to make it
[1:13:43] nice for the king when he comes
[1:13:46] but they also begin to work together
[1:13:48] showing the character of the king and
[1:13:51] the character of working together and
[1:13:52] the care for one another
[1:13:54] they already had that atmosphere going
[1:13:57] that the king could be comfortable with
[1:14:02] i think god has given us
[1:14:05] a wonderful message
[1:14:08] and i think it's his kingdom that has
[1:14:10] come to us
[1:14:12] and i think we should take it
[1:14:15] back to our playgrounds
[1:14:18] and use the word
[1:14:20] to prepare
[1:14:22] for the king
[1:14:26] i think we should work together
[1:14:28] i think if we say the love we love the
[1:14:30] lord i think we should love one another
[1:14:35] i think if we
[1:14:37] brother brown says it's the
[1:14:38] characteristics that we can tell the
[1:14:40] difference
[1:14:41] i think we should say lord i'm seeking
[1:14:44] the king but may the characteristics of
[1:14:46] the king
[1:14:48] be seen in me
[1:14:50] every day
[1:14:52] royalty showing itself
[1:14:55] with my family
[1:14:56] with how we treat one another on the
[1:14:58] playground
[1:15:00] i don't know how your playground looks
[1:15:01] this morning
[1:15:03] but i can tell you the king is coming
[1:15:06] and you need to go back to your
[1:15:07] playground say lord if there's anything
[1:15:09] in here that displeases you
[1:15:11] i'm preparing my playground for the king
[1:15:14] i got a throne and i've got this and
[1:15:16] i've made it nice and i'm everything in
[1:15:19] my life
[1:15:20] says to the world
[1:15:22] i'm seeking a king to come real soon
[1:15:26] how many wants that this morning
[1:15:30] amen let's stand and pray
[1:15:40] want to live
[1:15:43] the way
[1:15:45] he wants me
[1:15:48] to live
[1:15:50] i want to give
[1:15:53] until there's just
[1:15:56] no
[1:15:58] more to give
[1:16:01] i want to love

[1:16:07] there's just no
[1:16:10] more love
[1:16:12] for i could never
[1:16:16] ever
[1:16:20] the lord

[1:16:45] no more
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:59] no more
[1:17:03] [Music]
[1:17:14] just bow your heads just a minute one of
[1:17:16] the things i enjoy sometimes about
[1:17:18] studying
[1:17:22] the message it's not just all the
[1:17:23] powerful
[1:17:25] restoration of the word he's given us
[1:17:27] making the bible
[1:17:29] a new book to me but i watch a man's
[1:17:31] life grow into adoption
[1:17:34] i watch him say things and hear him say
[1:17:36] things like
[1:17:38] i want to live so that the at least
[1:17:40] little bit of grieving that i've done to
[1:17:43] the lord i would know it right away
[1:17:46] and i'd be so sensitive to i'd be able
[1:17:48] to make it right right away
[1:17:50] don't forget friends this is a prophet
[1:17:52] but he says i grieve the spirit
[1:17:54] sometimes but i at least want to know
[1:17:56] what i want to call a month i don't want
[1:17:58] to go a year
[1:18:00] i want to be sensitive to the king that
[1:18:02] as soon as i grieve his spirit i would
[1:18:05] know it and make it right whether that's
[1:18:06] a thought or
[1:18:08] i spoke too harshly to someone
[1:18:11] held bitterness on my heart
[1:18:12] [Music]
[1:18:14] these are the things that the
[1:18:15] characteristics of a kingdom people
[1:18:18] i just raised my hand to the lord say
[1:18:20] god may i surrender
[1:18:23] the inner things of my life
[1:18:26] i can express the character of the king
[1:18:29] that is soon coming
[1:18:31] [Music]
[1:18:32] it's not a sign it's a surrender i'm not
[1:18:34] looking for some sign from the lord
[1:18:37] he just asked for a surrender how many
[1:18:39] raise your hand and say i surrender
[1:18:43] i want to live the way he wants me to
[1:18:44] live god bless you
[1:18:47] say well i don't know what i have i
[1:18:48] don't know what i need and i i don't
[1:18:50] know what i'm lacking god knows what
[1:18:52] you're lacking
[1:18:53] god knows what you still need leave that
[1:18:55] in his hands just surrender yourself
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:19:00] the people in the last days sought king
[1:19:02] david and they sought the lord
[1:19:05] and they were restored and they had
[1:19:06] peace amongst themselves and in their
[1:19:08] kingdom
[1:19:09] because they began to seek the king
[1:19:12] heavenly father
[1:19:14] this is my heart lord

[1:19:37] same things but lord
