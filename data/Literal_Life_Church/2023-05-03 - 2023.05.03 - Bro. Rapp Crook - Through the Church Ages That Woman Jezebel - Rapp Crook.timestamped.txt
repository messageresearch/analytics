[0:01] um while we're still standing maybe we
[0:02] can open up our Bibles to the Book of
[0:04] Revelation chapter 2.
[0:24] and Lord willing this evening we're
[0:26] going to continue on with the thyatiran
[0:29] church age
[0:31] start this up here
[0:41] and we have liftoff very good
[0:46] um by God's grace it seems you want to
[0:48] take a look at um that woman Jezebel
[0:51] that's spoken of in the thyatiran uh
[0:54] message in Revelation chapter two and uh
[0:57] see how the Revelation is a book of
[1:00] Prophecy and how that Jezebel spirit is
[1:03] referred to back in the Old Testament
[1:05] how it manifests itself there and then
[1:08] how it was taking a hold on the church
[1:11] in the age of thyatira and then all the
[1:14] way up into the present and there's some
[1:17] prophecy that'll be trying to take a
[1:19] look at today may the Lord has helped me
[1:21] to share it clearly and uh for me I
[1:24] remember looking at the prophecy this
[1:26] way
[1:28] um what's the purpose of it for me the
[1:30] purpose the big takeaway we look at
[1:32] properly to see that God's in control
[1:36] that's that's the big that's the big
[1:38] thing we can see he's gotten all he's
[1:40] taking care of the big picture over the
[1:42] thousands of years he can take care of
[1:44] the problem in my life too that's what
[1:46] we're going to try to look at
[1:48] so Revelation Chapter 2 and verse 20
[1:52] um we'll just start here
[1:54] he says uh notwithstanding I have a few
[1:57] things against thee because thou
[2:00] suffrist that woman Jezebel which
[2:02] calleth herself a prophetess to teach
[2:05] and to seduce my servants to commit
[2:07] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[2:10] unto idols
[2:12] and I gave her space to repent of her
[2:14] fornication and she repented not
[2:17] so behold I will cast her into a bed and
[2:20] then that commit adultery with her into
[2:22] Great Tribulation except they repent of
[2:24] their deeds
[2:25] and they will kill her children with
[2:28] death and all the churches shall know
[2:30] that I am he which searcheth the Reigns
[2:33] and hearts and I will give you unto
[2:35] every one of you according to your works
[2:38] I just pray
[2:39] heavenly father I just ask your blessing
[2:42] upon our service this evening Lord I
[2:44] pray father that you would break the
[2:46] word clearly this evening Lord that we
[2:49] might see your hand both in the Old
[2:52] Testament the New Testament
[2:54] now and then even in our lives as well
[2:57] oh God I just pray that you would speak
[2:59] to each one of us tonight the name of
[3:00] the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be
[3:03] seated
[3:06] as we look back at these two scriptures
[3:08] we just read where Jezebels mentioned
[3:10] just want to highlight a couple of the
[3:12] characteristics that Christ is bringing
[3:15] out as he speaks to John through the
[3:18] angel that woman Jezebel she calls
[3:21] herself a prophetess so she's she this
[3:24] some of the the church isn't recognize
[3:27] her as one God's not recognizing her as
[3:29] one but she's claiming this for herself
[3:31] so Jezebel one of the characteristics
[3:33] she's not receiving word from God
[3:37] she wants to be giving word out herself
[3:39] and that she want she's going to do what
[3:42] she wants to do and that's just a
[3:44] characteristically she's calling herself
[3:46] a prophetess and she's teaching what is
[3:49] she teaching she's teaching God's people
[3:52] to commit fornication she's seducing
[3:55] them unto it
[3:57] she's a seductress
[4:00] teaching people to commit fornication to
[4:02] eat things sacrificed under Idols so
[4:05] here she's folk she's she's she's
[4:07] ministering if you'd call it that to
[4:10] people who are who are trying and
[4:12] sincerely wanting to serve God but she
[4:15] is corrupting their desires and teaching
[4:17] them to do the wrong things
[4:19] and we're going to look in the Old
[4:21] Testament at these characteristics of
[4:22] Jezebel and we can see this is this is
[4:25] this is spot on we're going to see how
[4:27] how Jezebel acted in the Old Testament
[4:29] because I think is amazing God is such a
[4:33] gracious God he gave Jezebel space to
[4:37] repent
[4:39] he gave Ahab space to repent and we're
[4:42] going to see the past that they took
[4:44] when they both have the opportunity to
[4:46] repent Ahab and Jezebel made different
[4:48] choices but Jezebel is hard she is not
[4:53] willing to repent even though she's
[4:55] given the opportunity she doesn't and
[4:58] we'll see tonight what happens
[5:00] when we refuse to repent
[5:03] and we'll and we'll see what happens to
[5:05] uh to Jezebel here
[5:08] um there we have it
[5:10] um and then she's going to be cast into
[5:11] a bed and then they commit adultery with
[5:13] her there's going to be judgment but
[5:15] again God is gracious except they repent
[5:18] of their deeds he's continually offering
[5:21] repentance and the messenger of this age
[5:23] was Columba and these Irish monks who
[5:26] were carrying the gospel back reseeding
[5:28] the gospel back throughout Europe it's
[5:30] there for those who want to see it and
[5:33] then other the John Wycliffe the morning
[5:35] star of the Reformation John Huss and
[5:37] others at the end of this period they're
[5:39] also there giving the chance to repent
[5:43] but the Catholic Church hardens its
[5:45] heart and refuses that
[5:47] and verse 23 is important and brother
[5:49] Brandon points out something that you
[5:51] almost would would read over
[5:53] Christ says I will kill her children
[5:55] with death
[5:57] and he says he's referring to her
[5:59] children which means Jezebel has
[6:02] children she has daughters and we'll see
[6:05] what those daughters are what those
[6:07] children are but they're going to be
[6:09] carriers of death
[6:12] and we'll and we'll see that perhaps we
[6:14] can I have I have to I'll refer to some
[6:16] scriptures but they're all in the and
[6:18] and the notes as we go
[6:20] I'm going to take a look at the Old
[6:22] Testament references to Jezebel because
[6:25] there's a very ex there's a purposeful
[6:27] reference to her here he says that woman
[6:30] Jezebel if we're going to see what how
[6:32] Jezebel acted in the Old Testament and
[6:35] that really does strengthen the message
[6:37] if I attire because we're going to see
[6:38] how just how what an evil corrupt woman
[6:41] she was
[6:43] and what she did but we'll see first in
[6:45] First Kings chapter 16.
[6:48] and uh and verse uh verse 30. it says
[6:52] Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the
[6:54] sight of the Lord above all that were
[6:55] before him
[6:57] and it came to pass as if it had been a
[6:59] light thing for him to walk in the sins
[7:01] of jeroboam the son of nibat that he
[7:04] took to wife Jezebel the daughter of f
[7:07] Bell king of those idonians and he went
[7:10] and served Baal and worshiped him
[7:13] and this is the marriage of convenience
[7:15] this is this is a political marriage
[7:18] um so that his his kingdom will be
[7:19] stronger he is not going to have to
[7:21] worry about his father-in-law attacking
[7:23] um this is this is a political marriage
[7:25] this is the very thing same thing that
[7:28] Constantine does he's bringing church
[7:30] and state together it's for political
[7:32] purposes there's no there's no love here
[7:35] um this is this is a political marriage
[7:37] but when Ahab marries Jezebel verse 32
[7:41] says it says he reared up an altar for
[7:43] Baal in the house of Baal first he's
[7:46] just marrying a jezebel but before too
[7:50] long it's not just his wife serving Baal
[7:52] that says he is also rearing up an altar
[7:56] for Baal in the temple of Baal so what
[7:58] we have and in verse 33 it says and Ahab
[8:01] made a Grove so it's not just Jezebel
[8:03] he's getting the honeydew list and he's
[8:05] doing it too he's engaging in it and we
[8:08] can see what Jezebel does here the very
[8:10] first thing that happens when Ahab
[8:12] marries Jezebel the fruit of this
[8:14] marriage is official sanction to
[8:16] idolatry
[8:18] this is becoming official act where the
[8:20] king himself is building this Grove the
[8:23] king himself is building this altar this
[8:26] is how the Jezebel spirit Works she's
[8:29] bringing official sanction to idolatry
[8:32] and then next you'll see over in the
[8:35] First Kings
[8:36] chapter 18.
[8:39] um
[8:39] Jezebel
[8:41] um
[8:42] this is when
[8:44] Elijah is being fed by the Lord there at
[8:48] the brook cherith I believe
[8:50] and there's been no rain for a couple
[8:52] years and Ahab is going out to find
[8:56] um Elijah so we can take care of this
[8:58] rain problem and he takes with them
[9:00] um his one of his ministers Obadiah and
[9:03] Obadiah
[9:04] has been he's a sincere follower of
[9:06] Jehovah and he's hidden um prophets of
[9:09] God well why was it necessary to hide
[9:13] prophets of God in the days of Ahab and
[9:16] Jezebel well first Kings 18 uh verse 4
[9:19] says it was so when Jezebel cut off the
[9:22] prophets of the Lord that Obadiah took a
[9:24] hundred of them and hid them by caves
[9:27] and verse 13 reference to this also
[9:31] Obadiah is told by Elijah Elijah appears
[9:35] to Obadiah and said I will go and appear
[9:37] to Ahab tell your servant I'm going to
[9:38] be coming tell your king I'm gonna be
[9:40] coming and Obadiah is like why don't you
[9:42] come with me because if I go and tell
[9:44] Ahab that and you don't show up it's
[9:46] gonna be off with my head I want you
[9:48] with me and I just said no just go tell
[9:50] them I'll do what I say
[9:52] because verse 13 says obadia says
[9:56] haven't you heard that when Jezebel slew
[9:59] the prophet of the Lord that I did this
[10:01] this Good Deed by hiding prophets what
[10:03] we see here
[10:05] Jezebel is doing ever she can to purge
[10:08] Believers in God's promises this is not
[10:10] purging them getting evil out of their
[10:11] lives this is the kind of purging like
[10:13] Stalin did and cutting off their heads
[10:15] he wants all the True Believers to be
[10:18] gone that's what Jezebel wants to do the
[10:21] spirit of Jezebel she can't tolerate
[10:23] true sincere belief if you're not going
[10:26] to bow to her it's going to be off
[10:28] either bow your neck or cut the neck off
[10:30] she's not going to tolerate any any
[10:32] dissent
[10:34] the next characteristic of Jezebel we
[10:36] see is that she is going to incite her
[10:39] husband to Greater wickedness
[10:42] and when I was reading this this past
[10:44] week it just it just struck me the power
[10:47] of a spouse
[10:50] Ahab marries Jezebel and what an impact
[10:53] she has on his life
[10:55] she is inciting him to do more and more
[10:59] evil
[11:00] because here
[11:02] um First Kings chapter 20
[11:06] one verses five through seven this is
[11:09] when Ahab goes walking and he sees this
[11:12] beautiful Vineyard next to his house and
[11:14] it's naboth's Vineyard he goes and asks
[11:16] neighbors can I buy it from you and they
[11:18] both says no I'm not going to sell this
[11:19] Vineyard this is part of my spiritual
[11:22] inheritance it's been in my family since
[11:24] Joshua told my tribe this is this is
[11:27] yours I can't give you even if you're
[11:29] thinking I can't give you what God gave
[11:31] to me this is this is mine I I can't
[11:33] sell it and Ahab comes home and he's
[11:37] just pouty he's just he's just all
[11:40] messed up because somebody told him no
[11:42] he's not used to that and Jezebel says
[11:45] what are you doing pouting you're the
[11:47] King this is easy to solve
[11:49] and she incites her husband
[11:53] to Greater wickedness he might have just
[11:55] gotten over it but she and says um as
[11:58] why is your spirit so sad that you eat
[12:00] no bread and he said unto her because I
[12:02] speak unto neighbor the Jezreel light
[12:04] and said to him give me your Vineyard
[12:07] for money or else I'll give you another
[12:09] Vineyard forward if you want that and he
[12:11] said I will not give you my Vineyard
[12:14] and jezebela's wife said to him Dash
[12:16] thou now govern the Kingdom of Israel
[12:19] arise eat bread let your heart be merry
[12:22] I will give you the vineyard of naboth
[12:24] adjust your light and she takes care of
[12:27] it she's inciting him to do more and
[12:29] more wrong and that's not the kind of
[12:32] spouse you want you and the spouse who
[12:35] encourages you in the Lord because
[12:36] you're going to be down sometimes even
[12:37] you want a friend who can pray with you
[12:40] who can who who can lift you up and
[12:42] doesn't tell you the easiest way to get
[12:44] your way when it's not God's will to do
[12:46] it that way but Jezebel said hey it
[12:48] doesn't matter if you want it I will
[12:50] help you get it
[12:52] and then the next characteristic that we
[12:54] see in First Kings 21 she's unrepentant
[12:58] this is after uh
[13:02] um Elijah gives the the final prophecy
[13:05] of judgment that the dogs will eat
[13:07] Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel
[13:10] and him that dieth of Ahab in the city
[13:12] of the dog shall eat
[13:14] Etc
[13:15] and then it's written there verse 25
[13:18] there was none like unto Ahab which did
[13:21] sell himself to work wickedness in the
[13:24] sight of the Lord whom Jezebel his wife
[13:27] stirred up
[13:29] so what are we stirring up our spouses
[13:31] to that's that's that's just for me a
[13:33] big a good question to think about verse
[13:36] 26 he did very abominably in following
[13:38] Idols according to all things as did the
[13:41] M writes and the Lord cast out before
[13:42] the children of Israel
[13:44] and it came to pass Earth 27 when Ahab
[13:47] heard these words of judgment
[13:50] that the rent is close
[13:52] and he put sackcloth on his flesh and
[13:55] fasted and laying sackcloth and went
[13:58] Softly
[14:00] don't write anybody off who would have
[14:03] thought that Ahab would have repented
[14:05] but he does
[14:07] God gave both Ahab and Jezebel space to
[14:11] repent and there was something in Ahab
[14:15] that laid dormant for a long time that
[14:18] had been that had been
[14:20] transgressed stepped over again and
[14:22] again and again but if you if we still
[14:24] have the slightest speaking of God's
[14:27] holy spirit in our hearts that is the
[14:30] most precious thing we have
[14:33] God heard ahab's prayer
[14:40] however
[14:41] um
[14:42] Jezebel did not repent I just think of
[14:45] verse 29 God says see is thou how Ahab
[14:49] humbles himself before me because he
[14:51] humbles himself before me I will not
[14:53] bring the evil in his days but in his
[14:55] son's days will I bring the evil upon
[14:56] this house God was merciful to Ahab
[15:00] Jezebel had the same chance
[15:03] she had space to repent but she refused
[15:09] now we know brother Brandon referred to
[15:11] the the children that uh that that
[15:14] Jezebel had in the fire Tyran age so I
[15:18] want to take a few minutes and look at
[15:19] the daughters of Jezebel and see what
[15:22] kinds of characteristics they had and
[15:24] we're going to see that the uh it's like
[15:26] mother-like daughter The Same Spirit
[15:28] that was in the mother uh the same modus
[15:31] operandi the word the way of operating
[15:33] that's where the daughter worked as well
[15:35] and second Kings chapter 8 it says in
[15:37] the fifth year of joram the son of Ahab
[15:40] king of Israel Jehoshaphat being then
[15:42] king of Judah
[15:44] johoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of
[15:46] Judah began to Reign so it's about
[15:47] johoram here and he walked in the ways
[15:50] of the Kings of Israel as did the house
[15:52] of Ahab
[15:53] why
[15:55] how could the son of Jehoshaphat a
[15:57] righteous King How could jehosha a holy
[16:00] man son like that how could he be
[16:02] walking in the ways of Ahab the
[16:04] explanation is for the daughter of Ahab
[16:08] was his wife
[16:10] and he did evil in the sight of the Lord
[16:12] and we're going to see
[16:14] that just like the mother so is her
[16:17] daughter like it says in Ezekiel 16 44
[16:20] athaliah just like Jezebel imported
[16:24] idolatry from the sidonians into Israel
[16:28] half a lie is going to import idolatry
[16:31] into Judah from Israel
[16:35] and that we'll see that
[16:37] um
[16:39] and second Chronicles chapter 22 we'll
[16:43] see again how this characteristic of of
[16:46] inciting greater wickedness in her
[16:48] spouse athaliah does this in second
[16:50] chronicles 22 it says on page three of
[16:53] the notes
[16:54] and says that
[16:56] johoram walked in the ways of the House
[16:58] of Ahab
[17:00] um this is not this is a um this is the
[17:03] Sun for his mother was his counselor to
[17:06] do wickedly so johoram passes away
[17:09] athelaya is in Queen and Judah I'm sorry
[17:13] she's not Queen it's it's their son
[17:15] who's the young boy the young man is is
[17:19] is is is the king but his mother is the
[17:21] counselor behind the throne and she is
[17:24] inciting him to do more weekly she was
[17:26] his counselor to do wickedly wherefore
[17:30] he did evil in the sight of the Lord
[17:31] like the house of Ahab for they were his
[17:33] counselors after the death of his father
[17:36] to his destruction so this this Jezebel
[17:39] spirit brings us to do more and more
[17:43] wickedness well after the sun passes
[17:45] away
[17:47] aphaliah sees his power and she goes
[17:50] about and executes a purge of all the
[17:54] House of David of all of anybody who
[17:56] would be heir to the throne anyway she
[17:59] executes a purge and kills all of them
[18:01] it sounds like the fairy stories almost
[18:02] where they kill every single person but
[18:04] one always escapes right and there's one
[18:07] little boy his name is joash he's hidden
[18:10] by the chief priest and he's he he said
[18:12] he's a young little guy
[18:14] and he's raised in the temple uh the the
[18:17] the priest raises him and teaches him
[18:19] until he finally comes I think to be
[18:20] seven years old and then then the priest
[18:23] introduces him to the people very very
[18:25] secretly
[18:26] this is a coup d'etat because athalia
[18:30] has been ruling uh for for some years
[18:32] now but we see this is just like Jezebel
[18:35] she is purging every heir to David's
[18:38] Throne she wants to have the power for
[18:40] herself and even when she's confronted
[18:42] with Wicked with with her wickedness she
[18:44] remains unrepentant
[18:47] just want to kind of show how this
[18:48] happens how this plays out in the
[18:50] genealogies you can't really read it too
[18:52] well that's not the point
[18:54] the point is on the left side you've got
[18:57] the House of David
[18:59] 's house is blessed with the promise and
[19:02] that promise goes from father to son son
[19:04] son son all the way down that's a
[19:07] straight line because there's a promise
[19:09] there that I've that that there will
[19:12] always be a man in the House of David
[19:14] upon the throne of Israel
[19:16] on the right side you have the you have
[19:18] the Kingdom of Israel this Kingdom isn't
[19:21] blessed with the same kind of Promise
[19:22] David's kingdom is so it kind of moves
[19:24] from one person there's a coup another
[19:26] person comes along a general kills that
[19:29] that King and then another and he
[19:31] becomes king on the throne just switches
[19:33] switches switches
[19:34] but I looked at this and I got to
[19:37] thinking about what brother Branham says
[19:38] about the two vines in the in the in the
[19:41] true church the false the false and True
[19:43] Vine in the church and you can see in
[19:46] the house of Israel there's idolatry
[19:48] from the beginning where is that Spirit
[19:50] of idolatry aiming that Spirit of
[19:52] idolatry is aiming right for that True
[19:55] Vine to see if he can swallow that up
[19:57] and try to try try to catch it brother
[19:59] Branham says in the days of Ahab Israel
[20:01] went into the Dark Ages it's in the days
[20:03] of Ahab or that false Jezebel spirit is
[20:07] trying to go from the house of Israel
[20:08] into the house of Judah and strangle the
[20:11] truth that was right there
[20:14] brother Branham says in the in the
[20:16] church age book is the Jezebel
[20:18] lafayatira was in no mood to give up her
[20:21] hold upon the people
[20:22] and thus we see her daughter aphalaya
[20:25] raise her head in the sardisian age with
[20:28] the hopes that she would be able to
[20:29] strangle the true seed by her schemes of
[20:33] organization and that's what she's
[20:35] trying to do she's trying to enter take
[20:37] over the uh take over the Throne of
[20:39] David so there can be no promise holder
[20:42] that that of of that of that promise
[20:44] that God gave to David she wants to take
[20:46] that she wants to be on the throne of
[20:48] promise that was her goal there and
[20:51] again she's completely
[20:54] unrepentant
[20:56] so when we look at the thyatyrian age
[20:59] it's like all the church ages Revelation
[21:02] chapter 1 says this book is a book of
[21:04] Prophecy so it's not just book of
[21:06] History what happened in the Old
[21:08] Testament when when this is spoken of
[21:10] that that woman Jezebel and the
[21:13] thyatiron church it's not just referring
[21:15] back to somebody who's like that woman
[21:17] Jezebel and this is a history lesson no
[21:19] it's that same Spirit John saying that's
[21:22] going to be coming here in the future
[21:23] it's going to be coming and she doesn't
[21:26] repent so it just keeps going and
[21:28] growing and growing throughout the ages
[21:33] this is talking about what athalia did
[21:37] and brother Branham saying look what
[21:38] Jezebel did
[21:40] she was so surrendered she took her
[21:42] daughter she had her daughter born here
[21:43] and this daughter athalia goes over here
[21:47] to this great holy man and takes and
[21:49] marries his son that's jehoshaphat's son
[21:51] and brings the same thing over in here
[21:54] from Jehoshaphat over into this part and
[21:57] that's what was trying to be done in the
[22:00] church ages as well
[22:05] and now notice the same thing they took
[22:07] Jezebel here at the Catholic church and
[22:09] down here she takes her daughter her
[22:11] organizations and marries it right into
[22:13] them down there and does the same thing
[22:15] to them killing the children killing her
[22:18] children with death and brother Brown
[22:20] says that's that's a spiritual death
[22:22] because as soon as that Spirit of
[22:23] organization comes in life is gone the
[22:27] spirit's gone
[22:29] that happened in the days of Ahab it
[22:32] happened in the days of jehoshaphat's
[22:35] son it happened in the days of thyatira
[22:38] and that Spirit still going on still
[22:41] today
[22:43] on page four he just kind of says the
[22:46] same thing
[22:47] um he's talking about um here's Jezebel
[22:51] and Israel it happened there but here's
[22:54] Judah a different type over here another
[22:56] one this was jehoshit over he was
[22:58] sincerely trying to serve God but the
[23:01] same thing comes into his house that's
[23:03] what happened with the uh just what
[23:05] happened at the uh
[23:07] um with the with the Kingdom of Israel
[23:11] so what we see have playing out in the
[23:13] Old Testament comes again the New
[23:15] Testament in the thyatar and there in
[23:17] this message of the church ages it's a
[23:19] book of Prophecy and it's going to be
[23:21] happening again in the future that's
[23:22] what it's telling about
[23:24] now the question what happens when you
[23:27] refuse repentance because that's what
[23:30] happens to Jezebel she in the thyatiron
[23:33] age she's given the space to repent but
[23:35] she doesn't repent
[23:37] what does she become
[23:40] the next time in the Book of Revelation
[23:43] that we see Jezebel
[23:46] is in Revelation chapter 17.
[23:49] and here um John is he's he he he sees a
[23:53] not sure if it's a literal Vision but
[23:55] but this is a vision we'll just call it
[23:57] that and one of the Seven Angels come
[23:59] which had the seven vowels and talked
[24:01] with me saying unto me come hither I
[24:03] will show you the Judgment of the great
[24:06] that's quite an advance from how we see
[24:08] Jezebel described in Revelation Chapter
[24:11] 2 Revelation Chapter 2 she's not a good
[24:14] woman she's teaching people to commit
[24:16] fornication she's not good but all of a
[24:18] sudden this description is is even worse
[24:21] and when you refuse repentance sin just
[24:24] goes to seed in your life and it gets
[24:25] worse and worse and worse and this is
[24:27] what we see happening to her
[24:30] I'll show you the the Judgment of the
[24:32] great that sits on many Waters
[24:34] with whom the kings of the Earth have
[24:36] committed fornication and the
[24:37] inhabitants of the Earth have been made
[24:39] drunk with the wine of her fornication
[24:41] what's in red here is what I'm seeing is
[24:44] the same characteristics we saw of
[24:45] Jezebel the Old Testament the kings of
[24:48] the earth commit fornication with her
[24:49] Ahab did
[24:51] he was led into sin with her the kings
[24:54] of Judah were led into sin with her and
[24:56] she has made everybody who drunk with
[24:58] the wine or fornication she's inciting
[25:00] people to wickedness leading them into
[25:02] sin it happened then it happened in
[25:04] thyatir and it happens what John is
[25:06] seeing even further into the future
[25:10] verse three he carried me away in this
[25:12] Spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a
[25:14] woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast
[25:17] full of Dames of blasphemy having seven
[25:20] heads and ten horns and the woman was
[25:23] arrayed in purple and Scarlet colored
[25:25] decked with gold
[25:27] and precious stones and Pearls having a
[25:29] golden cup and her hand full of
[25:30] Abominations and filthiness of her
[25:32] fornication I bet she's getting the
[25:34] desire for heart here
[25:36] she wanted a certain Throne she wanted
[25:38] that Throne of David that Throne of
[25:40] Promise the devil gives her a different
[25:42] Throne she seated upon this beast and
[25:45] she's she's Deck with everything her
[25:47] heart would desire but she didn't repent
[25:50] and because she's writing this power and
[25:53] not repenting she's going to be punished
[25:55] with Great Tribulation and with death
[25:57] because she didn't repent when it was
[25:59] given to her
[26:00] verse 5 and upon her forehead was a name
[26:04] written mystery Babylon the great the
[26:07] mother of harlots and the bomb nations
[26:09] of the earth just like the Jezebel of
[26:11] the Old Testament had a daughter who
[26:14] went and led other other kingdoms True
[26:16] Believers into a sin just like it
[26:19] happened in the thyatiron age here in
[26:21] the end there's a great with a
[26:23] mother who's a mother of harlots leading
[26:26] more into Abominations of the Earth this
[26:29] woman is drunk with the blood of the
[26:30] Saints
[26:31] Jezebel in the Old Testament purged all
[26:34] the True Believers athaliah did the same
[26:36] thing doing everything she can this
[26:38] Jezebel spirit keeps on doing it she's
[26:41] drunk with the blood of the Saints with
[26:44] the blood of the martyrs of Jesus
[26:46] and when I saw her I wondered with great
[26:50] admiration
[26:52] this is just this isn't John this is an
[26:55] impressive sight to him
[26:57] it's it's just it's it's amazing to him
[27:00] let's see what Jezebel has become and
[27:04] but if if we have space to repent take
[27:07] it because sin will take you farther
[27:09] than you want to go cost you more than
[27:12] you want to pay keep you longer than you
[27:13] want to stay it did hurt it cost her her
[27:16] life
[27:18] take that space to repent
[27:20] this uh this this Jezebel who refused
[27:24] repentance she becomes the great
[27:26] of Revelation
[27:28] 17 and we see this alarming illustration
[27:31] of the corrupting power
[27:33] of sin
[27:35] we see the also the characteristics of
[27:38] Jezebel that we've seen before here also
[27:40] displayed they want to focus for a
[27:43] little bit on this Beast that she's
[27:45] writing because this is not the first
[27:47] time that this beast on which she's
[27:50] sitting comes up in Scripture
[27:52] the first time it's referred to is in
[27:54] Daniel chapter seven perhaps we can turn
[27:56] over there
[27:58] Daniel chapter 7 verses uh
[28:01] one through seven I've got a short
[28:03] summary of bullet points on page five
[28:07] Ezekiel Daniel
[28:16] 7 verse 1. in the first year of
[28:18] belshazzar King of Babylon Daniel had a
[28:21] dream and visions of his head upon his
[28:22] bed then he wrote the dream and told the
[28:25] sum of the matters and Daniel spake and
[28:27] said I saw in my vision by night to
[28:28] Behold The Four Winds of the heaven
[28:30] strove upon the Great Sea
[28:32] and four great beasts came up from the
[28:35] sea just as in Revelation chapter 17 a
[28:37] beast comes up from the sea the first
[28:40] one was like a lion
[28:44] and had Eagle's Wings and beheld I
[28:46] beheld to the wings were plucked it was
[28:48] lifted from the Earth
[28:50] and then verse 5 he beholds another
[28:52] Beast a second like to a bear it raised
[28:55] up itself on one side three ribs in the
[28:57] mouth of it and it was told arise and
[29:00] devour much flesh
[29:02] verse 6 after this I beheld low another
[29:05] like a leopard which had upon the back
[29:07] of its four wings of a fowl the Beast
[29:09] had also four heads and Dominion was
[29:11] given to it
[29:13] and these three beasts are three
[29:15] kingdoms it's the Babylonian Kingdom the
[29:17] media Persian Kingdom The Grecian
[29:19] Kingdom if you think about the leopard
[29:21] such a fast uh animal and Alexander the
[29:24] Great leader of Greece he conquered the
[29:26] known World by the time he was 33.
[29:29] I'm not going to go into detail everyone
[29:31] to try to emphasize one point as we look
[29:33] at these different visions
[29:35] verse 7 after this I saw in the night
[29:39] visions and behold a fourth Beast
[29:41] Dreadful and terrible and strong
[29:43] exceedingly and it had great iron teeth
[29:46] it devoured and break in pieces and
[29:49] stamped the residue at the feet of it
[29:51] and it was diverse it was different from
[29:55] all the beasts that were before it and
[29:57] it had ten horns
[29:59] just like the Beast that they're in
[30:01] Revelations everything also had ten
[30:03] horns but the destruction that this
[30:04] Beast brings is just total it seems now
[30:09] the interpretation of this and we find
[30:11] in verses 15 to 26 but um
[30:15] I'll kind of Hit the hit the bullet
[30:17] points in verse 19 that's emphasizing
[30:19] the last Kingdom will be this mysterious
[30:23] Kingdom will be of a different sort than
[30:25] the first three kingdoms as also in
[30:27] verse 23 another characteristic verses
[30:30] 21 and 25 is this last kingdom is going
[30:33] to make war with the Saints
[30:35] just like the Jezebel spirit did
[30:38] what's the last Kingdom also known for
[30:40] in verse 25 this is just interesting
[30:42] verse 25 he shall speak great words
[30:45] against the most high and shall wear out
[30:47] the Saints of the most high and think to
[30:50] change times and laws and they'll be
[30:52] given unto him time times and the
[30:54] dividing of times
[30:56] and this idea of changing times and laws
[30:59] the calendar we got wasn't always the
[31:01] calendar we had
[31:03] Julius Caesar and before Christ he came
[31:06] up with a calendar it was a solar
[31:08] calendar based on 365 days a year in
[31:10] every fourth year a small correction
[31:13] that was the Julian calendar
[31:15] but the calculations were probably
[31:17] really cutting edge for that time period
[31:19] but as time went on it got off and you
[31:23] could see with the you could see with
[31:24] the solar and the uh the equinoxes of
[31:27] the spring and the in the winter it
[31:30] wasn't the summer and winter it wasn't
[31:31] quite it was changing and after a while
[31:33] it could be weeks and months different
[31:36] so over over 1600 years after Julius
[31:39] Caesar Pope Gregory the third
[31:43] comes up with a new calendar and he it's
[31:45] a minor changed how the leap year is
[31:47] calculated but that's how we got the
[31:49] grigorian calendar that we knew now now
[31:51] use got this man that comes into his
[31:54] heart to change times and laws and where
[31:57] does it come from it comes from this
[31:59] from the the head of the Catholic Church
[32:02] so this this is a this is a very
[32:04] mysterious Beast here he's coming up out
[32:07] of the sea and it's got a characteristic
[32:09] of a lion has a characteristic of a bear
[32:12] characteristic of of a leopard all
[32:15] combined into this fourth Beast with
[32:17] these ten ten horns
[32:19] very strong terrible notice also the
[32:22] references to the iron teeth
[32:25] now this is a the second time this kind
[32:27] of a vision comes up in the Book of
[32:29] Daniel where four kingdoms are
[32:31] prophesied
[32:32] the first time we see this kind of
[32:34] Prophecy coming forth is in Daniel
[32:36] chapter 2 after King nebuch and Nazar
[32:40] he wakes up in the middle of the night
[32:41] having had a terrible Nightmare and he
[32:44] uh he has all of the wise men his
[32:46] kingdom awakened as well and tells them
[32:49] if you can't interpret tell me my dream
[32:50] and interpret it it's off of all of your
[32:52] heads and all these wise men we can't do
[32:55] this it's going to be it's a bad they're
[32:57] having a bad night as well
[32:59] and Daniel gets the summons to come
[33:02] interpret this and he goes to prayer and
[33:04] says God I can't do it but my God can
[33:08] give the interpretation
[33:10] and God does
[33:12] let's see here
[33:15] up I'm off of course
[33:20] in Daniel chapter 2 and verse 40
[33:24] um beforehand this is the image that
[33:26] Nebuchadnezzar is seeing the Dream It's
[33:28] a mighty image made of different
[33:30] composed of different Metals the head of
[33:32] gold which is the Babylonian Empire the
[33:35] uh the the chest of silver which is the
[33:38] medo Persians then you've got the um the
[33:40] thighs of brass which is as grease and
[33:44] as you go down
[33:45] you have legs of iron and then feet of
[33:48] iron mixed with clay and again this is
[33:50] this mysterious fourth Kingdom and we'll
[33:53] see some characteristics in this fourth
[33:55] Kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar's dreams are
[33:56] very similar to the fourth Beast that
[33:59] Daniel sees in Daniel 7 the fourth
[34:01] Kingdom shall be strong as iron and that
[34:04] is strong iron teeth of that fourth
[34:06] Beast of Daniel 7 was was emphasized
[34:09] it as iron breaks in pieces subdues all
[34:13] things as iron breaks all these shall it
[34:15] break in pieces the destruction of this
[34:17] fourth Beast this fourth power is going
[34:19] to be of of a catastrophic scale in both
[34:23] of these visions
[34:24] and whereas you saw the feet and Toes
[34:27] part of Potter's clay and part of iron
[34:29] this Kingdom will be divided but there
[34:32] shall be in it of the strength of the
[34:34] iron that iron goes all the way through
[34:36] for as much as you saw the iron mixed
[34:38] with Miry clay
[34:40] and as the toes of the feet were part of
[34:43] iron and part of clay so the kingdom
[34:45] shall be partly strong and partly broken
[34:47] you saw the iron mixed with Mario Clay
[34:50] that will mingle themselves with the
[34:51] seed of men but they will not cleave one
[34:54] to another even as iron is not mixed
[34:56] with clay
[35:01] just wanted to take a look at the what
[35:03] those the the significance of the legs
[35:06] of of iron and the feet of iron and Clay
[35:09] because this is this is noteworthy
[35:12] the iron and Clay symbolize romanism
[35:15] Catholicism and protestantism mixed
[35:18] together
[35:19] and when brother Branham reads in verse
[35:22] 43 how they will mingle themselves to
[35:24] the seed of men he talks about
[35:26] Protestants and Catholics marrying one
[35:28] another and diluting uh their their the
[35:31] the true the the true Bible faith that
[35:34] way
[35:36] um and then at the end time the image
[35:37] that that Nebuchadnezzar sees is smitten
[35:41] in the toes
[35:43] this image there's this
[35:45] Nebuchadnezzar's dream there's a stone
[35:47] cut out of a mountain without hands and
[35:50] it goes hurtling through space and it
[35:52] doesn't strike the head it doesn't
[35:54] strike the chest doesn't strike the legs
[35:56] it strikes the feet it strikes the toes
[36:00] why is that significant
[36:02] oh it shows if you put if you were to
[36:05] lay the image on its side you'd have a
[36:07] horizontal timeline through history
[36:10] starting in Babylon ending up all the
[36:12] way until now and that destruction
[36:14] happens at the end time and they're in
[36:17] the toes as it were
[36:20] so brother Brandon underscores that that
[36:22] mixture of iron and Clay Protestant
[36:24] Catholicism being mixed together
[36:27] and then he's preaching the sermons on
[36:29] them
[36:30] the 70th week of Daniel in the early
[36:33] 1960s I think 1960 or 61.
[36:38] shortly before that
[36:40] um there's a there's a speech that takes
[36:42] place in the United Nations
[36:46] and you have
[36:48] Nikita Khrushchev from the Soviet Union
[36:50] he comes and visits the United States
[36:52] there's President Eisenhower
[36:54] um Eisenhower I think that German Bruce
[36:56] were for iron and whether Brandon points
[36:59] to these two men working together like
[37:01] this it points to where we are we're
[37:03] right in the right in the toes or the
[37:05] iron and the clay are mixed together
[37:08] and This Crew shops in the United
[37:09] Nations and he's giving a speech and to
[37:12] emphasize it he stands up and he just
[37:15] starts motion like this with his hand
[37:17] and here's the picture that that's taken
[37:19] well what does he have in his hand
[37:23] he has a shoe
[37:26] and brother Graham talks about this this
[37:28] is this is a crazy thing to do not ever
[37:30] any people get up and use their shoe as
[37:33] as their as their uh visual aid but
[37:37] Khrushchev does this and for the Ramses
[37:38] see what he's doing see what God's doing
[37:40] he's showing you we're living in the
[37:42] time of defeat we're living in a time of
[37:44] the toes pick it up this is the time
[37:45] where we're at
[37:46] and that is the time where we're at
[37:48] and but it's not everybody is looking oh
[37:52] it's communism it's communism we know
[37:54] God's using a world leader from a
[37:56] communist country to illustrate a point
[37:58] he's the communist leader people will
[38:00] listen to him but it's not communism
[38:02] brother Brandon points out in the
[38:04] talking about in the seven Church ages
[38:06] and there there was iron and clay in
[38:08] those toes and they wouldn't mix
[38:10] together
[38:12] Protestant Catholicism under the same
[38:14] Gentile domination
[38:16] and the handwriting on the wall and how
[38:19] in the Roman time they have two
[38:20] different churches among the Gentiles
[38:22] one would be Catholic one would be
[38:23] Protestant the iron of the Catholic
[38:26] church and the clay of the Protestant
[38:30] then the 70th week of Daniel this is
[38:33] about a year after uh khrushchev's
[38:35] Speech he says now notice here and here
[38:38] at the end of this age
[38:40] and Daniel 2 Daniel watched this image
[38:43] with great consideration he watched it
[38:45] until the stone was cut out of the
[38:47] mountain without hands it rolled down
[38:49] smote the image in the feet and broke
[38:51] that it never hit in the head now it was
[38:53] in their feet that was at the end time
[38:55] and then ten toes
[38:58] then in the on page five of the notes
[39:00] from the message restoration of the
[39:02] Bride tree brother Graham talks about
[39:04] those Tim ten toes run in every Kingdom
[39:07] Under the Earth he says there's an iron
[39:08] curtain communism there's a bamboo
[39:11] curtain of China and there's a purple
[39:13] curtain but don't you fear the rest of
[39:15] them but watch the purple curtain that's
[39:18] the one to to focus on
[39:21] so you see
[39:22] um we started with that that that the
[39:25] Jezebel upon the Beast and Rule and in
[39:28] Revelation 17 the Beast came up out of
[39:30] the sea it had ten horns and it was
[39:33] there was there was a description of it
[39:34] the matches very closely that Beast that
[39:37] comes up out of the water in Daniel 7
[39:39] and there are some similar
[39:41] characteristics with this with this
[39:43] Vision this dream that Nebuchadnezzar
[39:45] had in Daniel 2. so now we're going to
[39:47] pick up another place where the same
[39:49] Beast that comes up out of the water
[39:51] with the ten horns or the seven heads
[39:54] we'll see another description of that in
[39:55] Revelation chapter 13. perhaps we can
[39:58] turn there
[40:10] verse one and they stood upon the sand
[40:12] of the sea
[40:14] and I saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[40:17] having seven heads and ten horns and
[40:20] upon his horns ten crowns and upon his
[40:23] heads the name of blasphemy this is the
[40:25] same Beast we saw in Daniel 7 and we see
[40:28] again in Revelation 17. and the Beast
[40:31] which I saw was like unto a leopard his
[40:34] feet were as the feet of a bear and his
[40:36] mouth is the mouth of a lion these are
[40:38] this this is that same Beast described
[40:40] in Daniel 7.
[40:42] and the dragon gave him his power that's
[40:45] that same dragon that in Revelation 12
[40:48] is trying to kill that man child the
[40:50] Christ child this dragon is the devil
[40:53] this is that old serpent this is his all
[40:56] he's been trying to pursue Christ see
[40:58] the Promise throughout time and now you
[41:00] have this Beast coming up and the dragon
[41:02] is anointing it
[41:03] the dragon gave him his power and his
[41:06] seat and great Authority and I saw one
[41:09] of his heads as it were wounded to death
[41:11] and his deadly wound was healed and all
[41:14] the world wandered after the Beast and
[41:17] they worshiped the dragon as they
[41:19] watched the beasts wonder if they Beast
[41:21] they don't see the Dragon
[41:23] but the dragons anointing the Beast and
[41:26] they're giving wondering admiration to
[41:27] the beast but the dragon's the one
[41:29] receiving it
[41:31] they worshiped the Beast saying whose
[41:33] life unto the Beast who's able to make
[41:35] war with him it's what we see here in
[41:37] Revelation chapter 13 we see the same
[41:40] Beast coming up as the mouth of a lion
[41:42] the feet of a bear comes out of the sea
[41:44] it's like a leper the dragon's giving
[41:46] his power to receiving worship that's
[41:49] what the devil has always wanted
[41:51] to receive
[41:53] and we see the similar characteristics
[41:55] the Beast rising up the ten horns the
[41:58] same animal characteristics
[42:00] it's also interesting I saw one of its
[42:04] heads as it were wounded to death and
[42:06] this deadly wound was healed it seemed
[42:08] like it would have been a mortal wound
[42:09] this Beast would have been dead but it
[42:12] survives this symbol this description
[42:14] comes up one other time
[42:16] in Revelation 17 8 again it's the same
[42:18] Beast Revelation 13 Revelation 17 Daniel
[42:21] 7. verse 8 says the Beast that you saw
[42:25] was and it is not and shall Ascend out
[42:28] of the bottomless pit go into Perdition
[42:30] they'd dwell on the Earth shall wonder
[42:32] whose names were not written in the Book
[42:34] of Life from the foundation of the world
[42:36] when they behold the Beast that was and
[42:39] is not and the idea is and this is when
[42:42] papal Rome was destroyed by The
[42:45] Barbarians
[42:46] yet
[42:47] it was
[42:49] it was gone and it comes back into papal
[42:52] room this is the very same thing this is
[42:54] an amazing thing when such a power is
[42:56] papal whereas Pagan Rome was completely
[42:58] destroyed and then it comes back and
[43:00] this is ruling the world again
[43:02] how could that be it's anointed by a
[43:04] dragon and it's foretold so so so so so
[43:07] to happen
[43:10] so in Revelation 13 we see also um
[43:15] this is the same Beast like we said
[43:17] after
[43:19] in Revelation 13 we see two beasts the
[43:22] first Beast we just read about the one
[43:24] that comes up out of the sea that looks
[43:26] terrible Dreadful a diabolical yet still
[43:29] to be wondered at and even worshiped but
[43:33] in verse 11 of Revelation 13 John says I
[43:37] beheld another Beast this one doesn't
[43:39] come out of the sea it comes out of the
[43:40] earth and he had two horns like a lamb
[43:45] this doesn't look diabolical this looks
[43:48] like a nice little lamb looks like a
[43:50] nice creature
[43:52] but he spake as a dragon
[43:55] appearances are deceiving and he
[43:58] exercises all the power of the first
[44:00] Beast before him and causes the Earth
[44:03] and then what's dwelder into worship the
[44:05] first Beast whose deadly wound was
[44:07] healed how was it successful you did all
[44:09] the world to worship the first Beast it
[44:11] looks innocent it looks all right but it
[44:14] speaks like that Dragon
[44:17] verse 15 it says he had power to give
[44:20] life under the image of the Beast that
[44:22] the image of the Beast should both speak
[44:23] and cause as many as would not worship
[44:26] the image of the Beast should be killed
[44:28] again we have this this purging of
[44:31] someone who wants to do righteously
[44:32] that's that Jezebel spirit again it
[44:34] won't tolerate any dissent it's the it
[44:36] goes all the way through
[44:40] and then Verse 18 it says here is wisdom
[44:43] let him a hath understanding count the
[44:46] number of the Beast for it's the number
[44:48] of a man and his number is 603 score and
[44:53] six the dreaded six six six
[44:57] and it says in Revelation 13 if they uh
[45:00] won't be willing to take that Mark of
[45:03] the hand or in the forehead you won't be
[45:05] able to buy or sell anything like that
[45:07] I can remember back in the wonderful
[45:09] days of covid quarantines when you had
[45:11] to before somebody could come into the
[45:13] school I had to had to take this a thing
[45:15] look like a gun point at their head and
[45:16] take their temperature and they couldn't
[45:18] brother Wayne Lawson he comes and does
[45:19] Chapel message and he says and I I said
[45:22] brother can't take take your temperature
[45:23] real quick to assure the people say that
[45:26] this thing's checking the mark of the
[45:27] beast or something I mean people
[45:29] believed all kinds of things
[45:31] because you know we we think wow there's
[45:33] prophecy here we're going to be able to
[45:34] look out for things
[45:36] and I just want to one of the things I
[45:38] just kind of have learned from this
[45:40] particular study
[45:41] prophecy isn't given to us to function
[45:44] as a crystal ball or we look in it and
[45:47] say oh wow that's exactly how
[45:52] usually when the disciples tried to
[45:55] figure out what Jesus said is that we've
[45:57] got it they were wrong every time
[46:01] and I'd say probably when we Believers
[46:04] think I know exactly how it's going to
[46:06] come I know who's going to be the next
[46:08] president Hillary Clinton
[46:10] who as if she was running against I
[46:12] forget now
[46:13] um Hillary Clinton man brother Branson
[46:14] will be a strong woman it'll be her
[46:16] we've got all those predictions we have
[46:18] it all figured out didn't happen that
[46:20] way she's still not president and she's
[46:23] not in jail either
[46:27] but anyway
[46:28] um we prophecy isn't a crystal ball for
[46:31] us when we treat it like that we bring
[46:34] ourselves into error and create
[46:35] confusion what prophecy is it's
[46:38] interesting when people treat it that
[46:40] way
[46:40] it brings fear it brings conspiracy it
[46:44] brings anxiety that's not what prophecy
[46:46] is given for prophecy is given to give
[46:49] us rest so we can see after things have
[46:52] happened the disciples remembered oh yes
[46:54] Jesus told us about that
[46:57] prophecy brings rest we don't have to
[47:00] figure it out God interprets his own
[47:02] words by bringing it to pass and that we
[47:04] see that oh yes wonderful praise the
[47:06] Lord he was uncontrollable and I didn't
[47:07] even see it he's in control now prophecy
[47:10] helped us to learn to rest and relax at
[47:13] what God's doing
[47:17] so we have a message here
[47:19] in these three different things that
[47:21] we've seen so far we've seen
[47:23] in Daniel chapter 2 Nebuchadnezzar's
[47:26] dream is showing a mixture of
[47:28] Catholicism and protestantism as iron
[47:31] and Clay are mixed together and the feet
[47:33] and the toes of the fourth Kingdom we
[47:35] see the same thing emphasized in Daniel
[47:37] 7 Revelation 13 this beast and this
[47:40] image to the Beast and I didn't read a
[47:44] quote that I had I'm out of order
[47:47] about the image to the Beast and the
[47:50] resume of the ages
[47:53] the false Church groups will come
[47:55] together in a world Council of churches
[47:57] the World Council of churches is the
[48:00] image directed to the beast in
[48:02] Revelation chapter 13.
[48:05] what's wrong with unity
[48:07] what's wrong with churches coming
[48:08] together this is this little lamb that
[48:10] looks so innocent but when it's combined
[48:13] has this lamest two horns civil and
[48:15] ecclesiastical power when they're
[48:17] combined like that it can look so
[48:18] innocent but it can speak as a dragon
[48:20] that's this image to the Beast This
[48:22] World Council of churches
[48:26] now remember it was Imperial Pagan Rome
[48:28] that fell by the sword but she was
[48:30] healed of her Deathstroke when she
[48:32] joined to the nominal Christian Church
[48:34] of Rome and Incorporated paganism and
[48:37] Christianity and thereby came the Holy
[48:39] Roman Empire
[48:40] which was to endure until Jesus came and
[48:42] destroyed her but Rome is not going it
[48:45] alone
[48:47] her daughters are right with her and she
[48:49] will take over absolute Authority by the
[48:52] World Council of churches so that World
[48:53] Council of churches
[48:55] is the image to the Beast
[48:58] the underlying portion here
[49:01] this ecumenical move will end up with
[49:03] Rome at the head even though the people
[49:04] did not Envision it that way I've got a
[49:07] I don't have it in this presentation but
[49:11] I think four six years ago or so the
[49:13] pope met with various charismatic and
[49:15] Evangelical leaders and that this big
[49:18] picture together in the pope is talking
[49:19] about just all put our arms around us in
[49:22] Christian Brotherhood and they see that
[49:23] and he's smiling and when the pope gives
[49:25] you a hug I just feel like this is the
[49:27] false Vine tentacles trying to strangle
[49:30] us and and take all life away from us
[49:31] but that's that's the that's the spirit
[49:34] that's behind him
[49:37] even though it looks like that you're
[49:39] kind and gentle old man
[49:41] so you've got the second part the Beast
[49:43] and the image to the Beast and thirdly
[49:45] in Revelation 17 the great and the
[49:48] Harlot daughters
[49:50] the great is the Roman Catholic
[49:52] Church when the Catholic church when she
[49:54] starts having when
[49:56] um daughters come out of the mother
[49:58] they're in the birth process as people
[50:01] start leaving the Catholic church in the
[50:04] at the end of the Middle Ages in the
[50:05] Reformation there's a Lutheran Church
[50:07] that gets birthed and then there after
[50:09] the Wesleyan Church comes out different
[50:10] different with all kinds of nominee all
[50:12] kinds of little churches come out but
[50:14] they come out of the Harlem of of of of
[50:17] the great and they carry the same
[50:20] and and you don't always see it clearly
[50:22] but they carry the same spirit that
[50:25] athaliah had like mother like daughter
[50:28] and you can think about uh this is that
[50:31] this kind of boggled my mind when I when
[50:33] I thought about it but after England uh
[50:36] converted to protestantism so that Henry
[50:39] the eighth could marry again and again
[50:41] and again in hopes of getting a son that
[50:43] was the only reason he converted to
[50:45] protestantism but it had some good
[50:48] fruits there was an English Bible that
[50:49] came out of it the translations was it
[50:51] was a nice thing
[50:53] so technically the English church has
[50:55] left the Catholic Church
[50:57] but here you've got different groups
[50:59] within England the the separatists which
[51:01] we call the pilgrims the Puritans now
[51:04] you've got this Pro this so-called
[51:06] Protestant Church in England persecuting
[51:08] these people who won't tow the line of
[51:10] the king of England that's the same
[51:12] spirit that was upon the mother
[51:14] so these separatists in these Puritans
[51:16] they go over to Massachusetts
[51:19] and they establish a colony well after a
[51:21] while in Puritan Massachusetts comes a
[51:23] man named Roger Williams who doesn't
[51:25] always agree with the Puritan elders and
[51:27] they persecute him they boot him out of
[51:29] the colony and he has to go and he goes
[51:32] and found Rhode Island it's the same
[51:34] spirit that that's that that's
[51:36] persecuting Roger Williams wasn't born
[51:37] at the stake but he wasn't allowed to
[51:39] stay there in Massachusetts he wouldn't
[51:42] tow the line and there was a spirit that
[51:43] wasn't going to accept that and you can
[51:45] go along and see if you try to be in a
[51:47] Homeschool Group and won't sign a
[51:49] trinity pledge
[51:51] sorry you can be respectful as much as
[51:53] you want but you got to tell the line
[51:55] because they won't bring they want to
[51:57] accept any dissent from that
[52:01] may the Lord help us not to have that
[52:04] spirit
[52:05] gotten that order here again here I go
[52:12] just want to take a look at the some key
[52:14] pieces of the puzzle from these
[52:16] different scriptures
[52:18] this woman there are seven heads and
[52:21] seven mountains let's look at Revelation
[52:23] chapter 17 I believe this is
[52:28] yes Revelation 17 and verse 9 says it's
[52:31] the seven heads of the Beast are seven
[52:34] mountains on which the woman sitteth we
[52:36] want to find the interpretation of that
[52:38] also says
[52:40] um in the same chapter Revelation 17 the
[52:42] woman is that great city which rules
[52:44] over all the Earth all over the kings of
[52:46] the Earth
[52:47] in Revelation 13 we read Verse 18 the
[52:49] number of the Beast is number of man
[52:51] 666.
[52:54] well the seven heads are seven mountains
[52:57] um so I just kind of looked what kind of
[52:59] cities of the world are built on seven
[53:02] mountains or Seven Hills well there's a
[53:04] number of them Cincinnati Seattle
[53:06] they're all on Seven Hills or seven
[53:09] mountains
[53:10] in the Netherlands is Brussels Edinburgh
[53:13] Moscow is built on seven on seven hills
[53:16] and Rome Italy they're all there there
[53:19] are many cities who would qualify this
[53:21] but then the question is there's another
[53:23] qualification how many of these also
[53:25] rule over the kings of the Earth
[53:28] it doesn't not all of them will satisfy
[53:31] that Putin tries to make it so Moscow
[53:34] says you're the Third Rome but only Rome
[53:37] Italy can be said they do there are
[53:40] seven hills around there on Rome and
[53:43] world leaders
[53:45] try to get their picture taken with the
[53:47] Pope they they go there in the pool even
[53:49] says there's a secret mission going
[53:51] right now to Kiev to uh to to broker
[53:54] peace with the Russians I don't know if
[53:55] it'll work but here is
[53:57] a city on Seven Mountains there's
[54:00] influence over all kinds of world
[54:02] leaders it's there
[54:04] and then the number of the Beast is a
[54:07] number of a man and one of the titles of
[54:10] the pope is vicarius filiai day which
[54:14] means vicarious vicar or in the place of
[54:18] the son of God
[54:20] and I'm sure you've seen this before but
[54:21] if you take the the the the values of
[54:24] the Roman numerals vicariously the v's
[54:27] and one of five the eyes and I as C is a
[54:30] hundred this is where you when you're
[54:32] forced to learn Roman numerals kids this
[54:33] is where I kind of actually gets
[54:35] interesting Philly eye that's 50 and
[54:38] then day D is 500 you add these up
[54:42] 100 plus 1212 they have 53 you have 501
[54:48] they have their
[54:49] 666.
[54:51] and
[54:52] that's uh that's met by that that's met
[54:56] by one man here and it's he's supposed
[54:58] to have it there on this crown on his
[55:00] miter 666 vicarious phillyi day
[55:06] now there is some
[55:08] the Catholic Church
[55:10] um
[55:12] used to say and say yes one of the
[55:15] titles of the pope is vicarious phillyi
[55:17] day
[55:17] they don't claim that anymore
[55:19] conveniently
[55:22] um the this title first appears in an
[55:25] 8th Century document called the Donation
[55:27] of Constantine in which the Vatican
[55:29] draws up this document and which they
[55:32] claim that emperor Constantine donated
[55:35] all of the land of Italy to the pope of
[55:39] course all that land that's it that's
[55:40] that's huge uh profits for the Pope the
[55:43] all the rents from the people living
[55:45] there everything is power they control
[55:46] the king's there
[55:48] and one of the titles of the Pope in
[55:50] here is the vicar of the son of God
[55:53] however
[55:55] um
[55:55] this document that came out hundreds of
[55:59] years later that the Vatican forged the
[56:02] document
[56:03] the nation of Constantine it was a
[56:05] forged document the Vatican Druid up to
[56:07] convince other kings other Frankish
[56:10] kings that they they donate their lands
[56:13] to the pope as well because he is the
[56:14] vicar of the son of God
[56:16] so sometimes people will say yeah the
[56:18] doctrine was forged which this title
[56:20] first comes up so it's not really the
[56:22] title of the Pope anyway however
[56:25] it was the it was the the lie about the
[56:27] donation of the land that was the LIE of
[56:29] the document but that he was called the
[56:32] Son of God everybody accepted that that
[56:36] wasn't uh that part wasn't a forgery at
[56:39] all
[56:39] and doesn't so that it was a forgery
[56:41] doesn't negate the significance of that
[56:44] title vicarious Philly I did actually
[56:47] attests that this was common teaching of
[56:49] the church
[56:50] because people would accept what that
[56:51] document said because this was the title
[56:53] that was already being used and up until
[56:55] the 1940s
[56:58] popes would use this title and even in
[57:01] in 1914
[57:03] there is a a Catholic weekly called our
[57:06] Sunday visitor in November 15 1914
[57:10] and here conveniently enough you cannot
[57:13] find this uh the copy of this particular
[57:17] there are a few universities you might
[57:19] have it on microfilm
[57:21] but you can't find they have the the
[57:23] Sunday visitor website has copies of all
[57:26] issues but there are some of 1914-1915
[57:30] that are missing and this is one of them
[57:33] but the question here is is it true that
[57:35] the words of the Apocalypse in the 13th
[57:37] chapter uh 18 refer to the pope but here
[57:41] is wisdom 666.
[57:43] and this is what the answer was
[57:46] the Sunday visitor of the Roman Catholic
[57:48] Church is the title of the pope of Rome
[57:50] is vicarious phillyi day and this is
[57:53] inscribed on this miter and if you take
[57:55] the letters of the title which represent
[57:57] Latin numerals and add them together
[57:59] they come up to 666. the Catholic Church
[58:02] says this in 1914
[58:05] end in 1915 they get the same question
[58:08] written in and this one is also not
[58:10] available on their website but there are
[58:12] a few places that put them on the
[58:14] microfilm and they're there if you go to
[58:16] look for them
[58:18] and here the the question is what are
[58:20] the letters supposed to be in the Pope's
[58:22] Crown what do they signify if anything
[58:24] and it says the letters inscribed in the
[58:27] Pope's might or these vicarious phillyi
[58:30] day which is Latin for Vicar of the son
[58:34] of God
[58:35] and then in 1941 the same magazine said
[58:40] that's been commonly stated that this is
[58:42] one of the titles of the Pope but it's
[58:44] not because if you add up six you add up
[58:47] the numerals of somebody's name you
[58:49] could take anybody's name and add them
[58:50] up and they might equal the 666 and
[58:53] that can be true
[58:55] however there are multiple qualities
[58:58] multiple stars to be aligned City on
[59:02] Seven Hills there were many of them only
[59:04] one of them rules over Kings of the
[59:05] Earth
[59:06] and then his number is also 666. you can
[59:09] say that this person or this person this
[59:11] person you got up their names I tried
[59:13] mine and maybe that I don't know
[59:15] um but yeah I don't live in a city that
[59:17] sits on Seven Hills so even if your name
[59:18] adds up to 666 that doesn't mean
[59:20] anything you have to have all these
[59:22] stars of Prophecy aligned together and
[59:24] they do
[59:27] with this pope of Rome
[59:31] so for me just interesting
[59:34] this the spirit of Jezebel
[59:37] the church ages it's it's a book of The
[59:39] Book of Revelation is a book of Prophecy
[59:41] and you see this the spirit of Jezebel
[59:43] referred back to alluded to in the Old
[59:45] Testament seeing the church ages and it
[59:48] keeps on going and going and going until
[59:50] at the very end John is seeing this
[59:52] woman
[59:53] she refused to repent and she got what
[59:56] she wanted she got all the power but her
[59:58] end let's take a look at Revelation
[1:00:00] chapter 17 and we'll see what her her
[1:00:03] end is
[1:00:13] and traversa after 17 verse 17 you have
[1:00:17] verse chapter 18 rather after these
[1:00:19] things I saw another Angel come down
[1:00:21] from heaven having great power and the
[1:00:24] Earth was lightened with his glory and
[1:00:25] he cried mildly with a strong voice
[1:00:27] saying Babylon the great is fallen and
[1:00:31] has become the habitation of devils
[1:00:33] so Babylon this was something in chapter
[1:00:36] 17 John looked at this woman and this
[1:00:38] beast and he wonders after with a great
[1:00:41] admiration it's an impressive thing
[1:00:45] she had her time when she was at when
[1:00:48] she was uh um and she seemed powerful
[1:00:51] and admirable even the problem even the
[1:00:52] Apostle John looked at her that way but
[1:00:55] in chapter eight and you see that's of
[1:00:56] the pleasures of Sinner for a season the
[1:00:59] promises the devil gives you
[1:01:01] there for a season because in chapter 18
[1:01:03] Babylon Has Fallen
[1:01:05] and there'll be great judgment brought
[1:01:07] over her and that's the end that's the
[1:01:10] end of that of that particular spirit
[1:01:12] and then in Revelation 21 you see a new
[1:01:16] Heaven and a new Earth come down that's
[1:01:18] what's promised us that's what we have
[1:01:20] to wait upon and just like we read in at
[1:01:23] the end of last our sermon last month
[1:01:26] we've talked about thyatira it ends unto
[1:01:30] verse 24 chapter 2 under you I say unto
[1:01:32] the rest and thyatira
[1:01:35] I will not put upon you any other burden
[1:01:39] but that what you already have hold
[1:01:40] faster I come
[1:01:42] to overcome I think keepeth my Works to
[1:01:44] him will I give power over the Nations
[1:01:46] he'll rule them as the wrath of irons
[1:01:49] the vessels of Potter shall be broken
[1:01:50] the Shivers even as I've received of my
[1:01:52] father I'll give him the Morning Star
[1:01:54] there's a promise to the Overcomer even
[1:01:57] though even though this this this
[1:01:58] Powerful Beast seems to rule over all
[1:02:00] the Earth we hold on because there's a
[1:02:03] promise it'll be a morning star come and
[1:02:05] we will rule and reign with Christ
[1:02:08] but as I said what's the point
[1:02:11] we can try to figure all these details
[1:02:13] out we might have details wrong left and
[1:02:15] right but the point is God is in control
[1:02:18] he's been in control the entire time
[1:02:20] like it's not a crystal ball the
[1:02:23] disciples are told by Jesus that that
[1:02:26] they're going to Scourge the Messiah
[1:02:27] they'll put them to death and the third
[1:02:29] day he will rise again that seems to us
[1:02:31] very clear how could you not understand
[1:02:33] that but it says they understood none of
[1:02:36] these things
[1:02:38] and this saying was hid from them
[1:02:40] neither neither knew they the things
[1:02:42] which were spoken
[1:02:43] John 12 16 these things understood not
[1:02:47] as Disciples of the first but when Jesus
[1:02:49] was glorified and then remembered they
[1:02:51] these things have been written of him
[1:02:55] God interprets his word by bringing it
[1:02:57] to pass if God said will do a thing when
[1:03:00] he does it that's the interpretation of
[1:03:02] it that's how we know what he meant God
[1:03:04] interprets his own word he does his own
[1:03:06] interpretation he doesn't need any
[1:03:08] Seminary or ministers me you no one else
[1:03:11] to interpret him he promised it he turns
[1:03:13] around he does it that settles it that
[1:03:16] interprets it
[1:03:18] so an incorrect crystal ball view of
[1:03:21] Prophecy encourages us to connect all
[1:03:23] the dots and explain everything it puts
[1:03:26] a great burden upon ourselves to figure
[1:03:28] everything out and we just get
[1:03:30] conspiracies anxiety the result is fear
[1:03:34] God is not the author of confusion God
[1:03:36] is the author of Peace he's not the
[1:03:38] author of conspiracy
[1:03:40] but a correct if you have prophecy lets
[1:03:42] us rest in the sovereignty of God we can
[1:03:46] hold fast till he come because he said
[1:03:48] he's going to come we can just wait for
[1:03:51] that amen
[1:03:53] enemy positions can come and we can pray
[1:03:57] Heavenly Father we just thank you so
[1:03:59] much as we look at all these different
[1:04:02] prophecies that you made in Millennia
[1:04:05] past and Lord we're just so thankful
[1:04:07] that we have our eyes of understanding
[1:04:09] have been enlightened just by your grace
[1:04:10] Lord that we can see what you were doing
[1:04:13] then we can see that you're still
[1:04:15] working and we're and we're waiting Lord
[1:04:16] for that time the morning Stars risen
[1:04:19] over waiting for that Rapture to come oh
[1:04:21] God we can meet you in the air oh Lord
[1:04:22] and we'll be able to my we can we can
[1:04:25] reign with you for a thousand years o
[1:04:27] God and then come down on Earth in this
[1:04:30] new heaven that's completely new heaven
[1:04:31] new Earth completely purged pure oh God
[1:04:34] what a wonderful thing there won't be
[1:04:36] any phones or social media or news feeds
[1:04:39] or anything there will be just a
[1:04:41] atmosphere an environment of your word
[1:04:43] we can worship you in the truth Lord
[1:04:46] father I just pray that you would help
[1:04:48] us to rest
[1:04:50] as we we can see the end time events
[1:04:54] coming around and we can try to figure
[1:04:55] out this or that but Lord let us just
[1:04:58] rest in your promise you're going to
[1:05:00] come
[1:05:01] we're your children you're not going to
[1:05:02] let us behind you're not going to leave
[1:05:04] us behind you're going to come and get
[1:05:05] us to oh God we're going to rest in that
[1:05:08] Lord I pray that you would help us to
[1:05:10] rest in you
[1:05:12] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:05:14] a
