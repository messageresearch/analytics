you've been better better than to me you've been better better than to me youve been better you've been so good you've been real good you've been so good to me Proverbs Chapter 6 my son if thou be shity for thy friend if thou Hast stricken thy hand with a stranger thou art snared with the words of thy mouth Thou Art taken with the words of thy mouth that verse 6 verse one chapter 6 6 vers1 says shy and it has the connotation of sometimes you can apply it to co-signing for somebody or become a becoming a partner with somebody in business this is often how that is taken is that you become shity in other words you found you form an agreement you form a bond or a partnership with somebody and so now when that can be taken not only for business the scripture kind of uh leans us away from forming bonds like that and being Partnerships but if you do There's real warnings that come with it and so he says if thou be shy for thy friend if thou has stricken thy hand with a stranger because this say says with a friend this is where we form bonds and we form tightness and uh you know we we hang out together and then we start to form bonds and agreements together it has to do with agreements and forming those type of friendships and then it says Thou Art snared with thy words of thy mouth Thou Art taken with the words of thy mouth do this now my son and deliver thyself when thou art come into the hand of thy friend go humble thyself and here's the theme make sure thy friend so if there's going to be this kind of a bond you better make sure of this friend you better check him out you better check her out you better make sure you may secure the character of this person because why you're going to form an agreement a partnership you're going to form a bond with him and the scripture is warning us is that if you form the wrong bond that it says to deliver yourself but before you even get there make sure thy friend give not sleep to thine eyes nor Slumber to thine eyelids in other words Keep Your Eyes Wide Open deliver thyself as a row from the hand of the Hunter and as a bird from the hand of the foul Fowler and both places in verse three and verse 5 it says to deliver thyself this is only mentioned three times in scripture to deliver thyself these two places here and also in one of the Old Testament prophets where it says to Israel when they were mingling with B Babylon he says to deliver thyself so I want to speak on that this morning deliver thyself we often hear a person say I need deliverance from God I need Deliverance I need God to deliver me and there's not a thing wrong with that but here's a small section where it says deliver thyself the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ in this hour is being called away into the secret of his dwelling place we're called to a secret relationship in this inner room with him we're called to a place to be hidden in Christ hidden from the things of the world hidden from the being affected by the things of the world how many know we're called to a hidden place in Christ David said hide me in the Rock and so we are called to this place Song of Solomon says something he says to his love Arise My Love and come away and you know the song of the Solomon is a is a a chapter in the Bible a book in the Bible that is actually uh such an intimate close Oneness with the the woman that he loved the one woman that he found Solomon and so now we realize that's a type of the Bride In Christ at the last days and one of the things he says to her is Arise My Love and come away in other words it's an exclusive relationship it's calling the bride away to something that's personal and exclusive and to forsake any other bond that is a hindrance to this one relationship God is calling us to forsake every Bond every attachment everything that is more important than your bond with Christ God is calling us to a secret dwelling place with him if you want to know what the message has come to do that's what it's come to do it's saying Arise My Love come out of the world come out of all the things that that the pressures of this world and where do we come to a relationship with Jesus Christ personally that we have never known before and so it's arise Come Away forsake any other bond that is a hindrance and we use it in the wedding ceremony in the in The Vow forsaking all others and that's a true marriage is that now at that decision time there might be other ones that you dated or was with or whatever or you you know I don't know but at this point if it's a real commitment it's forsaking all others and cling only to him that's what's the wife says that's what the man says you forsake all others if that's true of a marriage a Christian marriage it's true of our relationship with the Lord you forsake all others that would be a hindrance to this relationship and we cling to him uh if if he is not our strongest bond in life we will be shaken up everything else in this life is being shaken every other thing that we had Security in is becoming insecure you will feel insecure if you put your trust in any other relationship because all of it seems to become disappointing all of it seems to follow that's why we have such a lack of trust today in relationships because we've been hurt before so we don't trust relationships but there is a relationship that you can trust there is a relationship and sometimes when one ends and it's a good thing that it ends it's the Lord driving you to the one relationship that will bring you Security in this hour and that's with the Lord when everything fails when he is all that we have left then he will be all that we need can I safely say that if we got got to the place in life where he was the only thing that we had left including money he was the only thing we had left if that happened to you he would be the only thing that you need we cannot form a bond we cannot form a strong bond with something that's insecure that's being shaken all the kingdoms of this Earth will be shaken including the economic system we do all we can we work we plan we invest we might what do whatever we do but don't you dare put your trust in a system that we know according to scripture is supposed to crash all this stuff is being lined up right now can you say Amen so we do what we do in this world and if God blesses it fine but don't ever don't ever as a minister of the Lord don't ever put your security in that because it can all change in one day our only security is us being driven in a bond with the Lord because when he is all we have then he's all we need we're being drawn into that kind of life and whether it's in life or death he will be all that we need whether it's in life or death the difficult part when we have the bride being called to a a close relationship with him and a exclusive relationship and coming into a secret place the difficult part with us sometimes is the separation part part of him drawing us away and freeing oursel from uh and fre freeing ourselves so we can be closer to him part of it is is that he draws us away from other unhealthy Bonds in our life he draws us away from that and when you're drawn away from those bonds and that closest and that friend when you're pulled away from that there's a pain that will go with it and we don't like that pain but we are called to cut ties with certain things we are called to separate from certain things our Father Abraham was called to separate from his Kindred and in order to move on with the promise he had to separate some may not understand that they say well come on how do you understand a God that would separate from your Kindred hey your Kindred is your Kindred your family is your family and that's probably the hardest part is when you have to separate sometimes from family not that you're not friendly with them not that you're not courteous but Abraham was called some people don't want to accept this but when he was called to more to take his PR more of God he had to separate yourself from your Kindred we don't understand that because hey family's family family will always be family stick with the family we stick together we stand for one another there are some incidences where God CS you to separate a bit from that because you have cannot have a stronger bond with your family than with the Lord so God calls it's painful and and and this is the part of we love the fact that I say that we're going to be called to a hidden place in Christ that we're being drawn away closer to him but it's painful when he begins to cut ties or we begin to be called to cut ties we tend to cling cling to our past identity cling to our friends and we're more used to that we feel safer with that these are the friends we've developed all these years we feel safer and trust me today I'm not speaking against true friends true friends true Godly friends that lead you closer to the Lord that's a wonderful thing if you have true friends they're a gift of God if you just made up a friendship sometimes it can be unhealthy and if it becomes more and more unhealthy God says deliver yourself from that Bond deliver yourself from that friendship make sure who your friend is it may become a stronghold that keeps us from what's better in our life being tied in bonds to the wrong people can limit you here I I in the scripture today is a call to deliver yourself from the wrong bond to deliver yourself from the wrong friend to make sure thy friend you know we Americans uh we quickly are emotionally attached to people and we are emotional God made us that way but we we tend to really emotionally ATT attach ourself to people and when we do that we have to take this lesson everyone does make sure thy friend because we will normally attach oursel more emotionally to somebody that will come natural and we just form a bond and now we're friends we're bodies this is it but the scripture warns us we must be so careful who we form a bond with we must be sure that this is the right kind of friend can you say Amen we must be sure if we form deals and part parterships and all these things are linked to forming an emotional bond sometimes a financial Bond sometimes a mental Bond we we are warned in the scripture that we we and and Americans take this rough sometimes because we quickly emotionally attach to something Hollywood knows this the movie industry knows this the music industry knows this that we are music itself is even used sometimes to emotionally attach people to someone or to something and the music affects us to do that and we we lean more towards emotional feelings and we'll choose to bond with something just simply on how it feels instead of checking it out music affects us emotionally it opens our hearts I've I've I've read you the lyrics of the song by Barry Manalo years ago I read it for the purpose of showing who's speaking behind the song it says I write the songs I've been alive forever ever and I wrote the very first song I Put the words and The Melodies together I am music and I write the songs I write the songs that make the whole world sing I write the songs of love and special things I write the songs that make the young girls cry I write the songs I write the songs second verse says my home lies deep within you and I've got my own place in your soul I've been alive forever I wrote the verse who's talking here not Barry Manalo there's another author of something speaking here my home lies deep within you I've got my own place in your soul now when I look out through your eyes I'm young again even though I'm very old I write the songs that make the whole world sing and then the course and then the the the bridge says and my music makes you dance it gives you Spirit to take a chance I wrote some rock and roll so you can move music fills your heart well that's a great Fine Place to Start it's for me it's for you it's from you it's from me it's a worldwide Symphony and everybody cries it becomes a an emotional thing and who's the author speaking well he's def definitely looking for a place in the soul and now he uses his music to do it movies and books make us cry and laugh and we form a friend without checking them out Bible says be careful who you form a partnership with friends can be more how many know that friends can be more than just human beings I find with the young people sometimes their phone has become their friend that's who they have there all the time that's their companion the Bible says don't be a companion of fools it says that to the young people don't have be a companion with fools well if it's not a person because everybody's so isolated then the phone becomes their friend or all the people that's on their phone how many know fear can become a friend you don't have any friends so fear the fear in your life becomes your friend that's what you're used to that's the bond that you have is fear you're afraid and so it becomes your friend can you say amen and all the the industries I was thinking of it this morning why why do they call my health insurance uh plan or my health insurance why do they call it a healthc care partner you know they're bleeding people of millions of dollars how can that be my partner that's called a partner and my insurance they want me to look at my Ins Insurance company as a good neighbor what where are all these These are insurance companies corporations and they want the corporations to be my neighbor they're using these terms my partner my health partner and and and there's a reason that they're using them is because people I guess are lonely but I can trust this Health Care system system they will be my partner they will make it as long as we pay the you know 1,500 a month to keep it going you're going to we're we're real friends what kind of friendship is that like a good neighbor and then they get in your head with a song like a good neighbor State Farm is there Nationwide is on your side all these guys just blatantly taking the place of a partner and a neighbor and a friendship in your life bleeding you for hundreds of thousands of dollars all the time which you won't ever get back and they are doing that to you and they want you to call them their friend neighbor and they're on your side as a buddy I wonder I wonder when I thought of that last night or this morning I thought I wonder if this is part of the whole breakdown of America that don't have any close friends and it's an alternative I'll be your friend and so we go back to Proverbs Chapter 6 and just break it down just a little bit before I come back around to that thought of delivering thyself Proverbs 6 if you have your Bible open it jumps to describing uh first of all it says be sure thy friend and then it jumps to the characteristics of the wrong kind of people to be around verse 12 a naughty person a wicked man walth with a forward mouth he winketh with his eyes he speaketh with his feet he teacheth with his fingers forwardness in his is in his heart he deceiveth he he deviseth Mischief continually he Seth Discord therefore shall his Calamity come suddenly suddenly shall he be broken without remedy so that's the first place he describes a forward person that's not the kind of friend to have well what is a forward person who has a forward mouth habit habitually disposed to being disobedient and being in opposition the synonyms are their headstrong self-willed willful willful Disobedience not obeying or complying with the commands of those in authority and then it uses the word perverse the Greek word used in Matthew 17 for perverse by y Yeshua which means to distort a turning so in other words a forward person has a perverse type of manner but it's not perverse in the think we think it's a pervert it's not that extreme perverse saying a person saying perverse things it it means to just distort a turning aside we see in both languages that the meaning of perverse is not some demented thing but merely a slight Distortion of or turning from the truth that's perverse so it's not this thing hey come on let's go party let's go to the world no it's what Satan was in the garden it's perverse it's a slight going off the truth it's just a distortion of events when you have a distortion of events you have a distortion of the truth cuz that's not what really happened it's a distortion of what happened when you have a distortion of the pastor or a distortion of the church that's not the full truth and so to make sure thy friend we CLE clear it up and make sure what truth is before we believe it moves on to uh Proverbs uh 16:28 and this is tied together with a forward man Proverbs 1628 in the King James a forward man Seth strife and a Whisperer separateth Chief friends what kind of spirit is that when you have Unity when you have closeness when you have a bond even in a marriage what kind of spirit would come along to cause a whisper of separating Chief friends in other words this isn't it's saying I want to be your friend but it wants to separate true friendships a forward man Seth strife and a whisper separated Chief friends it's in the other Lang in the other versions of the Bible it's mentioned a perverse Man soul Strife you know what Strife is is just tension everything they say is just to make tension to make drama there's no peace in it a perverse Man soul Strife a whisper separates the best of friends and another American Standard a p a perverse man scattereth a broad strife and a whisper scatter Chief friends and in the Berean Bible says a perverse man spreads dissension and a gossip divides close friends so now you have a relationship maybe number one with the Lord but you have decent relationships you have Unity you have you have close cless you have bonds you have the right kind of bonds this spirit is to divide those bonds your relationship with the Lord is meant to be divided by this motive to stop that and to pull you away from it so this statement that says deliver thyself three times in the scripture we always hear God I want him Del to deliver me I I need Deliverance but God can't move if you're not going to let go of things can I say it again amen God is the deliverer he came to deliver his people from all bondage he can deliver you but God cannot move if you're not willing to let go if you're not willing to deliver yourself this a pretty strong word deliver yourself you can deliver yourself he can't break a bond that you have so tight that you're not willing to break it he can't break that but you can deliver yourself from that Bond God I'm going to I'm going to break this I'm going to break this unhealthy thing this unhealthy Bond I'm going to move forward with this God will just jump right behind you and you'll feel the wind can you say Amen underneath your wings say God I'm going to break this relationship I'm going to cut this off I'm going to cut myself free of this and watch The Wind Beneath Your Wings just take you in faith further can you say Amen but it says to to free yourself and and the and the example here is to tear yourself away that's the other translations tear yourself away from the trap of a hunter or the hand of a Fowler it actually means to free yourself after you've been trapped I'm I'm going to verse um so you catch it deliver thyself from a as a row a deer from the hand of the Hunter and as a bird from the hand of the fer you're already in the hand they've caught you but it says just start fighting and get out of the hand of the fower you're already in the Trap but you know when you're in a trap you can start to wiggle around and that's what this is It's not not before you get trapped it's actually when you're trapped that God can come along and put the wind with the wings and help you but you got to start fighting to free yourself up God I'm trapped by this pornography God I'm trapped by this addiction God I'm trapped by this wrong relationship it's an unhealthy one but I'm going to start wiggling my way out of it and get out of this [Music] trap to deliver myself amen I just got to believe that when you wiggle yourself out there's another hand to receive you when you come out but we have to be willing to come out of it thank you for watching our message today if you
