[0:00] apologize for some of the babies yelling
[0:02] out in the background there doesn't make
[0:04] it as peaceful you might have put some
[0:06] of those babies on the project Henry
[0:08] because that's
[0:09] that probably fits that's normal
[0:11] you're going to hear that in your home
[0:12] too
[0:14] amen well if you can stand with me we're
[0:17] going to read in the scripture together
[0:19] James chapter 5 a portion of scripture
[0:22] there and in Matthew 13.
[0:26] yes so we have a gift for you in the
[0:29] back all the moms so make sure you pick
[0:31] that up there in the gym after the
[0:33] service
[0:38] James chapter 5
[0:42] and then we'll go back and pick up one
[0:44] verse in Matthew chapter 13.
[0:47] James chapter 5.
[0:51] and verse 7 and 8.
[0:55] be patient therefore Brethren unto the
[0:59] coming of the Lord
[1:01] behold the husband men waited for the
[1:03] precious fruit of the Earth
[1:06] the husbandman is the farmer the farmer
[1:09] waited for the precious fruit of the
[1:11] Earth in half long patience for it until
[1:15] he received the early and latter rain
[1:19] be also patient establish your hearts
[1:23] for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh
[1:28] amen Matthew Chapter 13 and verse 37.
[1:42] and he answered and said unto them
[1:45] he that soweth the good seed is the son
[1:49] of man I'm going to read that again
[1:50] verse 37 and he answered and said unto
[1:53] them he that soweth the good seed is the
[1:58] son of man
[1:59] father we ask you give us our Lord the
[2:02] the portion that you have given us for
[2:04] today and Lord you spoke in the
[2:07] scripture and says give us our day our
[2:08] daily bread and that's what we're to
[2:11] pray and so Lord you give us every day
[2:13] what we need to sustain us to
[2:15] spiritually be strengthened and so Lord
[2:18] we pray that you'll provide that for us
[2:20] today as we break bread together your
[2:22] bread your word it's your life Lord and
[2:24] so I pray father that your word will go
[2:26] out and minister to every need there's
[2:29] no way that a human being could meet
[2:30] these needs there's no way that a man
[2:33] just with a sermon Lord could meet the
[2:35] needs and these precious people but Lord
[2:38] your word has provided a place we can
[2:40] come an atmosphere we can come your
[2:43] spirit whether the anointing is upon the
[2:45] word and choosing the foolishness of
[2:48] preaching Lord to save some we pray that
[2:50] salvation would come today we pray that
[2:53] encouragement would come today and Lord
[2:55] through the channel that you've given to
[2:57] your people I pray father that each
[2:59] person would be affected in a positive
[3:01] way and come closer to you as we commit
[3:04] this service to you in the name of the
[3:06] Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you may
[3:09] be seated this morning
[3:11] I was uh inspired yesterday as I was
[3:13] last night as I was coming through the
[3:15] uh gym and I seen some of the gifts out
[3:18] there that they had prepared for the
[3:20] moms and they had a little sign by the
[3:23] gifts uh a scripture I think in another
[3:25] version but it's the scripture that says
[3:27] he that soweth to the spirit will reap
[3:30] and I just read that for a second and
[3:32] walked away and I was extremely inspired
[3:35] by that scripture and I think it's an
[3:39] appropriate scripture an appropriate
[3:41] thing to apply to mothers and that is
[3:44] that he that soweth to the spirit
[3:46] because basically that's really what
[3:49] moms do is they're in the sowing years
[3:51] and they have the ability uh to sow many
[3:55] many good things into the child can you
[3:58] say Amen she truly is that she's A sower
[4:01] mom and God must have trusted her to set
[4:06] her in life because he God set this up
[4:09] God created human beings he created the
[4:11] family and created how many years and
[4:14] all those things and then he set up
[4:16] mothers and fathers and so in his plan
[4:19] for some reason God set it up that the
[4:21] mom would have the child in its first
[4:24] formative years in other words mom would
[4:27] have the baby and the child first before
[4:30] anybody else I think God's mind was for
[4:33] that God was thinking and he must have
[4:35] trusted that if it was the right kind of
[4:37] mom that the best person that could be
[4:40] with that child in its most formable
[4:42] years is the mom right there close to
[4:45] them to the to embrace them to teach
[4:47] them to live something in front of them
[4:49] but also to speak to them and most words
[4:53] that are spoken in the early years of
[4:56] our life are spoken by the mom and how
[4:59] many know that words have a powerful
[5:00] effect on us
[5:02] how many know that words are so powerful
[5:04] that you can remember something that was
[5:06] said about you even from your childhood
[5:09] you can remember what was said about you
[5:11] and those words can have still today a
[5:14] powerful effect upon your life and we
[5:16] would raise your hand and say my mother
[5:17] had a powerful effect upon my life and
[5:20] God set it up that way and it was mostly
[5:22] not just her actions but the words that
[5:24] were because you see words are seeds
[5:27] words are something that you plant can
[5:29] you say mine and and so you could live
[5:32] the life in front of them but it's
[5:34] getting across something to that child
[5:36] to that baby and then as they come in as
[5:39] toddlers mom is the one that's with him
[5:42] the most and and those words are seeds
[5:44] being sown and when seeds are sown then
[5:48] later you look and see what results come
[5:50] from the seeds that are sown because the
[5:53] law of harvest and the law of planting
[5:55] it applies to everything in our lives
[5:58] and that is whatever is sown there's
[6:00] going to be a harvest from what's being
[6:02] don't you just don't get to see it till
[6:04] many years later but I can tell you
[6:06] whatever is sown there will be a harvest
[6:09] from that
[6:10] in our lives the principle works and
[6:13] especially with words that are spoken
[6:15] over us and moms do this uh uh in the
[6:19] early years of Our Lives those words
[6:21] from her lips wield such great power
[6:24] over our lives and that spoken word from
[6:28] mom is kind of the Original Seed the
[6:32] spoken word is the Original Seed and
[6:34] those spoken words from mom is kind of
[6:36] the original seed for our lives on Earth
[6:40] can you say Amen building who we are
[6:43] your hair is so shiny and pretty today
[6:47] you have such nice handwriting
[6:50] of course my mom never said that about
[6:52] my handwriting
[6:54] you're brave to go out there and and and
[6:56] play basketball I think you are kind I'm
[7:00] proud of you for trying harder in school
[7:02] I'm glad you're my daughter I'm glad
[7:05] you're my son I'm proud of you I love
[7:08] your dimples they're just so cute
[7:12] these are some practical things that are
[7:14] words that are spoken but guess what
[7:15] she's the first one that says those
[7:17] things and hopefully she's a mom that
[7:19] doesn't always point out to all the
[7:21] flaws in US
[7:23] you have to do correction or you're not
[7:25] a good mom either
[7:28] you have to get a hold of that will or
[7:31] that will will get a hold of you
[7:34] so you have to kind of just break it a
[7:36] little bit but if all that is there
[7:38] without some words about the good can
[7:41] you say Amen then then it's going to be
[7:44] detrimental so this is the kind of I'm
[7:45] just giving simple examples of things
[7:47] that are said that can have a lifelong
[7:50] effect upon us and uh and mothers say
[7:52] that mothers say these things and they
[7:55] give us things in those early years and
[7:57] we may not remember everything although
[7:59] some things you can remember we may not
[8:01] remember everything but there's
[8:03] something in us that and gets embedded
[8:05] in US embedded in our minds and we can
[8:08] go back to something that was said over
[8:10] us personally now Mom can compliment
[8:12] other things mom can compliment dad mom
[8:15] can speak of other things that she
[8:17] enjoys but when she brings a direct a
[8:20] direct compliment to you and your
[8:23] personality and how God made you and
[8:25] that you're fearfully in one word and I
[8:27] love you the way that you are that's a
[8:30] direct personal thing to us and let me
[8:31] say friends if that has a much that much
[8:34] effect upon us oh mother's word spoken
[8:37] to us how much does the word of God have
[8:40] power over us and what he says about us
[8:44] how much the more what he says is true
[8:47] and will have an effect on our spiritual
[8:48] life
[8:49] can you say Amen
[8:51] so having moms with her with their
[8:55] babies of course is the best thing and
[8:57] today we praise that and we praise a man
[8:59] who's able to keep her home that's where
[9:01] she should be is at home with the kids
[9:03] if you can if you can accomplish that so
[9:06] we are thankful for that because that's
[9:08] best for the kid and it's such a
[9:10] powerful impact can I say if a mom can I
[9:13] say it again if a mom could have that by
[9:16] her words in life how much more can
[9:18] God's word affect us for our lives
[9:22] Jesus said my words that I speak unto
[9:25] you they are spirit and they are alive
[9:28] my word will have an effect on you the
[9:31] most powerful thing is when he speaks
[9:34] something over our lives the most
[9:36] powerful thing is when God speaks and
[9:38] he's spoken many things but when he
[9:40] speaks personally over our lives can you
[9:43] say Amen it's such a powerful thing
[9:46] everything changed in Abraham's life
[9:48] when God spoke his word for Abraham and
[9:52] guess what when God called Abraham and
[9:54] spoke to him it was a personal word for
[9:57] Abraham
[9:58] and it changed his complete life
[10:02] he was an idolater he had a certain
[10:05] identity and probably would have been an
[10:07] idolater the rest of his life until God
[10:11] came and spoke to him and said no you're
[10:14] you're not you're not an idolater notice
[10:18] God saying a different identity you're
[10:20] not eye doctors because God's going to
[10:21] be speaking from the Lamb's Book of Life
[10:23] can I get an amen here this morning God
[10:26] will be speaking not from the identity
[10:28] you know but God will be speaking from
[10:30] the Lamb's Book of Life and he said to
[10:32] Abraham you're not an idolater I'm going
[10:35] to make you he said who are you said
[10:37] well I'm Barren my wife can't have a
[10:39] child I can't have a child I'm an
[10:42] Abraham that's my that's my name that's
[10:44] my identity I'm Barren and I'm also an
[10:47] idolater and God says no I'm going to
[10:49] change your name from Abraham Abram to
[10:52] Abraham and you're no longer a Barren
[10:55] idolater but you're going to be guess
[10:58] what look at this I'll make a bear in
[11:00] person the father of men Nations
[11:05] when God speaks over your life it
[11:09] changes everything somebody say praise
[11:12] the Lord
[11:15] the power of a mom's word over your life
[11:17] but look at the power of this
[11:20] he said I'll change your name there I'll
[11:22] take Abram and I'm going to stick
[11:23] Abraham on Mr H in there which is
[11:25] actually God which means God I'm going
[11:28] to put myself I'm not gonna I'm gonna
[11:29] identify myself in your name and guess
[11:32] what what's your wife's name Sarai
[11:34] change I'm going to change her name too
[11:36] showing us showing us there's a new name
[11:39] how many knows a revelation speaks of a
[11:41] new name
[11:42] but it's not just the Christ but it's
[11:45] the bride gets a new name as well
[11:48] Hallelujah I might change her name too
[11:50] from Sarai to Sarah I'm going to change
[11:53] your name I'm going to change your life
[11:55] by what the spoken word of God and he
[11:57] says Abraham get thee out from thy
[11:59] Kindred I want you to leave all your
[12:01] Kindred I don't know all the reasons God
[12:03] said that he says I can't bless you and
[12:05] I can't show you who you are and I can't
[12:07] let this promise come to pass unless
[12:09] you're willing to separate from your
[12:11] family members that are idolaters how
[12:13] many would raise your hand this morning
[12:14] and show the whole congregation and to
[12:16] all that are listening would raise your
[12:18] hand God did that with me I had to
[12:20] separate from everything dear to me in
[12:22] order to find what God said to me
[12:25] to come to what he said about my life oh
[12:28] I may get around some family members and
[12:30] I'm praying that they come to the Lord
[12:32] and all that but I had to separate like
[12:34] Abraham did to come to this change of
[12:36] life can you say amount the change of
[12:39] who I was
[12:40] Hallelujah so now he had a different
[12:43] future when God spoke over him and he
[12:47] came from an idolater to you're the
[12:49] possessor of Heaven and Earth Abram
[12:52] Barren to Abraham the father of many
[12:55] nations his identity changed everything
[12:58] changed that's why in the New Testament
[13:00] it says when you come into Christ you
[13:02] are a new new creature completely old
[13:06] things pass away
[13:08] All Things become new
[13:15] wouldn't God come and speak words over
[13:18] Abraham's seed in the end time as well
[13:20] if he talked to Abraham and we're Seed
[13:22] of Abraham said you'll be the father of
[13:24] Many Many Nations not only the natural
[13:27] seed of Israel millions of people come
[13:29] from Abraham he started a whole new
[13:31] nation and he says the father of many
[13:34] nations 12 tribes spread into millions
[13:37] people around the world Jews but then we
[13:40] know that Abraham had a spiritual seed
[13:42] the faith seed how many millions were
[13:44] there of those throughout the
[13:45] generations
[13:47] I believe I'm Abraham's seed this
[13:49] morning and wouldn't God just like he
[13:51] spoke to Our Father Abraham come in the
[13:53] end time and talk to the seeds of
[13:55] Abraham and tell you you are not a
[13:58] church member can you say man you are
[14:01] not a harlot you are not just some some
[14:04] person that's just looking at television
[14:06] all the time and and taking up with
[14:08] Hollywood and a drinker and a smoker and
[14:11] just all those things you're not that
[14:13] you're a child you're a son and daughter
[14:14] of God can you say amen and many this
[14:17] morning are living that way that God
[14:19] come to the sons of Abraham at the end
[14:21] time and spoke again and said you're not
[14:24] what they said reminds me of that
[14:26] service in Chicago where there's a
[14:28] prayer line and brother Branham is
[14:30] bringing them all up and there's one
[14:31] woman there in the film there's actually
[14:33] a film of this if you want to watch it
[14:35] deep cold through the deep and there's a
[14:37] woman that he's praying over and he says
[14:39] and the discernment comes to him to be
[14:42] able to tell what's in her life and what
[14:44] her problem was is that there were many
[14:46] people that was telling her that she was
[14:47] the witch she was a witch she was kind
[14:50] of seemed like a spiritual woman and
[14:52] they were calling her a witch and so she
[14:54] had come into all these physical
[14:55] problems and all this happening here
[14:58] because someone else had spoken a lie
[15:01] over her life did you realize that lies
[15:03] can be spoken as if their truth and it
[15:06] can bind you for almost your entire life
[15:09] and this woman was believing this lie
[15:11] that maybe I am a witch and come under
[15:13] physical all kinds of ailments and he
[15:16] had to pray for the physical ailment but
[15:17] he had to deal with he said they're
[15:19] telling you you're a witch and I love it
[15:21] in the film where he looks her in the
[15:23] eye and he points his finger to his head
[15:25] I want to tell you you're not a witch
[15:27] you're a daughter of God you're not a
[15:29] witch
[15:32] and in a moment's time change the whole
[15:35] lives that listen friends glory be to
[15:37] God lies have been told on your life can
[15:40] you say man don't believe the identity
[15:42] that what everything's been said about
[15:43] you but start to believe God's word and
[15:46] what he said about you can I get an amen
[15:48] this morning the moment you stop
[15:50] believing what your past life was and
[15:53] start believing what God Said your
[15:55] deliverance is there
[16:00] praise the Lord
[16:03] there's one other element oh I want to
[16:06] read a scripture I missed it Isaiah 55 8
[16:08] and this is expresses now
[16:12] we're Isaiah 55 8 for my thoughts are
[16:15] not your thoughts neither are your ways
[16:17] my way saith the Lord for as the heavens
[16:19] are higher than the earth so are my ways
[16:22] higher than your ways and my thoughts
[16:24] than your thoughts for as the rain
[16:26] cometh and the snow from heaven and
[16:28] returneth not thither but watereth the
[16:30] Earth and make it to bring forth and to
[16:33] Bud that it may give seed to the sower
[16:35] and bread to the eater so shall my word
[16:40] be that goeth forth out of my mouth so
[16:43] he's talking about the sowing he's
[16:45] talking about the former ladder rainbows
[16:47] which by the way is throughout
[16:49] prophecies and scripture of our day a
[16:51] former and a latter rain coming together
[16:54] but how is he going to bring it by the
[16:57] words spoken from his mouth and guess
[16:59] what they are it's my thoughts it's my
[17:02] words it's what I think about you
[17:04] somebody say praise the Lord
[17:07] you can believe whatever you want about
[17:09] yourself but one day God's going to come
[17:11] and say this is what I think about you
[17:13] this is my thoughts and guess what my
[17:15] thoughts are higher than your thoughts
[17:17] there's something that trumps everything
[17:19] that the devil tells about you and
[17:21] that's what God's word says about you
[17:23] you go ahead and believe your whole life
[17:25] if you want to what the devil has told
[17:27] you what your your family has told you
[17:29] you go ahead and believe it but I'm you
[17:31] want to start believing because those
[17:32] thoughts are not as high as God's
[17:34] thoughts
[17:35] and he says I'll bring the rain I'll
[17:37] bring the former latter ring and he says
[17:39] it'll begin to Bud something else so
[17:41] shall my word go forth out of my mouth
[17:43] and by the way if you know your Bible
[17:45] what is the mouth of God how does he
[17:47] speak it does everybody know what the
[17:49] mouth it's a prophet
[17:52] scripture says it the the mouthpiece of
[17:55] God is a prophet that's what he brings
[17:57] his word to sow the seed is through a
[18:00] prophet I want you to hold on to that
[18:01] because that's what we'll get to today
[18:02] so shall my word be go forth as a my
[18:05] mouth it shall not return unto me void
[18:08] but it shall accomplish that which I
[18:10] please and it shall prosper in the thing
[18:12] where unto I sent it for ye shall go out
[18:15] you know what that's saying if it's my
[18:17] thought and I spoke it and it's planting
[18:19] the seed there is nothing there is no
[18:22] devil in hell there's nothing going to
[18:24] stop that from budding and coming forth
[18:30] three
[18:32] for ye shall go out with joy and be led
[18:35] forth with peace the mountains and the
[18:37] hills shall Break Forth before you into
[18:40] singing and all the trees of the field
[18:42] shall clap their hands sounds like a
[18:45] Revival sounds like a pretty happy time
[18:47] sounds like a good thing what when God's
[18:50] thoughts are revealed to you about
[18:52] yourself and he plants that seed of his
[18:54] word and it shall not return void it
[18:57] will bring forth can you say Amen that
[19:00] uh that makes even the trees clap their
[19:02] hands that makes everything break into
[19:04] singing that's the thing that brings Joy
[19:06] that's the thing that brings peace
[19:10] nothing in this world will bring peace
[19:13] but what he said about you
[19:15] is a seed that's been sown
[19:19] now there's an element in when God
[19:21] speaks his word and I think it's with
[19:23] Mom too and I want to stress it just a
[19:25] little bit
[19:26] there comes a time when Mom has invested
[19:28] so many words
[19:30] and so many things and the father does
[19:32] as well
[19:33] but there is it comes a time when you
[19:35] have put all in and you invested so much
[19:38] teaching and training and you've said
[19:39] this what they've done wrong what
[19:41] they've done right all these other
[19:42] things there actually comes a time when
[19:44] you
[19:45] you have to it naturally happens you
[19:47] have to back off a little bit
[19:49] because they will eventually go
[19:53] it will be empty nest
[19:56] and it's kind of a
[20:00] I get mixed emotions about the kids
[20:02] leaving home
[20:03] joy and happiness no just kidding
[20:08] no it's mixed emotions because I
[20:11] remember when Solomon just went here
[20:13] recently and I told him you know he
[20:15] needed to move out before at the first
[20:17] of the year I gave him a deadline he
[20:19] said you're kicking me out
[20:21] I said well you can word it that way
[20:24] that's not really what I said I think
[20:26] you need to go out and get used to
[20:27] things before you get married and the
[20:29] expenses and get you a place of your own
[20:31] think you should do that before and not
[20:33] the day of the wedding it's just my
[20:34] advice to them and so uh I think he
[20:36] still views it as kicking him out but
[20:38] anyway uh I remember yeah we got to do
[20:41] this we had this I was very confident
[20:42] it's time for him to move on you know uh
[20:45] he's 40 years old no he's not 40 but
[20:47] he's you know it's time for him to go
[20:49] and
[20:51] so I remember the night that he was
[20:52] packing up back here first of the year
[20:55] and I was fine with I was glad the whole
[20:57] time okay this is this is good for him
[20:59] and this is good for me and uh the night
[21:02] before I went down and helped him pack
[21:04] and I started to get emotional
[21:07] so then I said okay I'm done with this
[21:09] and I went to bed and I stayed up till
[21:10] three in the morning and I'm late I'm
[21:12] over here in the bed just bawling crying
[21:14] I said to my she said would you please
[21:16] go to sleep she said you wanted him to
[21:19] go and now you're crying
[21:21] I said I don't want him to go now I I
[21:24] can't do this
[21:25] you know
[21:26] she said get out of here and go down and
[21:29] tell him so I went downstairs I woke him
[21:31] up
[21:32] just let you know I love you and you
[21:35] don't have to go you know what
[21:37] you don't want of course he's looking at
[21:38] me like I'm crazy
[21:40] you wanted this and I'm doing this but
[21:42] when it hit so it's mixed emotions but
[21:44] the day comes
[21:46] the day comes
[21:48] and so now and there's another natural
[21:50] thing that happens is that there's a
[21:52] certain backing off for several reasons
[21:54] of weighing in on all this glorious
[21:57] wisdom that you have for their life you
[21:59] think that they're going to be welcome
[22:01] to hear that
[22:02] for the rest of their life
[22:05] um but you know there's several reasons
[22:07] but there's a certain backing off to
[22:08] rest in what you've taught them what
[22:12] you've invested in them and you've done
[22:14] enough and you've said enough and and
[22:16] you give that but there's a certain
[22:18] natural okay now let's see let's see how
[22:22] all this is done instead of because
[22:24] sometimes they're they say okay you know
[22:26] you've said that already the last 20
[22:29] years of my life all right so I don't
[22:31] need to hear it again that's not really
[22:33] what they have but it's just more okay I
[22:35] got it Dad you know okay so there's a
[22:38] certain
[22:39] um after the seed's been planted and
[22:41] after you've invested there's a certain
[22:42] amount of Separation that has to happen
[22:46] and then you kind of get to see and
[22:48] watch What the Lord Has Done in their
[22:49] life but watch what you've dispensed and
[22:52] done everything you could and there's
[22:53] some things that you there's no perfect
[22:55] parent did you know that if you are
[22:57] please come and tell me I'd like to get
[22:58] your manual
[23:01] there's only one perfect parent and
[23:03] that's God
[23:04] our father he's the perfect parent but
[23:07] if I can take my image from him and and
[23:09] borrow from him and use what he used and
[23:11] learn from him then I can be a better
[23:13] parent but there is no perfect parent so
[23:15] we don't do everything right but
[23:16] hopefully we invested some things of the
[23:18] principles of life from the word of God
[23:20] and I always reminded all my kids this
[23:22] is not daddy's things and not Daddy's
[23:24] thing this says the word of God because
[23:25] that's what we've based our home on and
[23:27] we've applied the token to our home and
[23:29] we believe the word of God we believe
[23:31] the message of the last days it is the
[23:33] manual the Bible is the manual for our
[23:35] lives and the message is the light
[23:36] that's brought back the truth of them
[23:38] the manual I just it's not it's not
[23:40] dad's rules this is mostly based upon
[23:43] the word of God and so you look you step
[23:46] back and mothers kind of have to do that
[23:48] uh and it's a bit scary but if she's in
[23:51] invested the right things into her
[23:54] children then you step back and you've
[23:56] invested the right things especially the
[23:59] word of God you ought to rest in that
[24:01] say okay now let's see the Harvest that
[24:03] comes from it and guess what parents
[24:06] have a promise even how they lead their
[24:09] children if they'll set them in the
[24:10] right direction and invest those things
[24:12] you moms have a promise step back
[24:15] because if it's the right things you
[24:17] have a promise they'll it it'll never
[24:20] depart from them
[24:21] can he say Amen
[24:24] they might try to depart from it
[24:27] but what seed has been sown it'll never
[24:29] depart from that
[24:31] a lot of parents have to go through that
[24:33] when there's a season oh Lord what have
[24:35] I done wrong
[24:37] what is going on in that girl's life
[24:39] what is going on in that guy's life my
[24:42] son my daughter there are some parents
[24:44] that have to go through it but you know
[24:46] what you need to rest in you need to
[24:48] rest in the Lord
[24:51] because if it's his seed if it's his
[24:54] word it won't return void
[25:03] so this is our subject today when we
[25:04] talk as James in the Bible brings out
[25:07] about the husbandman or the farmer and
[25:10] he's expressing that first of all that
[25:12] we are in the season of the coming of
[25:14] the Lord
[25:15] and when we're in the season of the
[25:17] coming of the lord I want you to notice
[25:19] some prophecy there because if it's the
[25:21] season of the coming of the Lord he said
[25:23] the the farmer has great patience to
[25:26] wait until the crop comes now if you
[25:29] have the coming of the time of the
[25:31] coming in the Lord
[25:32] and you have that type then it says
[25:34] there that the farmer is waiting
[25:37] patiently for the fruit to come up now
[25:39] he couldn't be waiting unless God had
[25:42] come before the coming of the Lord and
[25:45] planted the right seed
[25:48] otherwise he had nothing to be patient
[25:50] over there'd be nothing to look for but
[25:53] it's because the son of man has come in
[25:56] the end time before the coming of the
[25:58] Lord and he's planted some seeds that's
[26:01] why the farmer can rest and be patient
[26:04] can you say amen that's the number one
[26:06] reason is that he can do it because
[26:08] there's been a seed planted he wouldn't
[26:10] be waiting unless but also guess what he
[26:13] knows why is he patient because the
[26:16] opposite of that is being impatient the
[26:18] opposite is being nervous being unstable
[26:20] oh I wonder what's going to happen and
[26:23] parents can be that about their kids
[26:24] wonder what's going to happen I don't
[26:25] know which direction they're going to go
[26:26] you can be nervous about it but this man
[26:28] knowing the coming of the Lord is nigh
[26:30] he knows and can rest in something that
[26:33] God has planted a seed by his word the
[26:37] son of man comes at the end time and
[26:39] speaks to a prophet and that is planting
[26:42] seed for our time now if we know that
[26:46] he's planted seed and it's him that's
[26:48] done it not the farmer the son of man
[26:51] has planted The Good Seed that's why the
[26:55] the husband men can sit back and say I'm
[26:58] not going to get impatient I'm not going
[27:00] to get nervous because he the son of man
[27:03] has come in the end time and he's
[27:05] planted his word seed and it will not
[27:08] return void
[27:10] it will accomplish
[27:13] now if I had planted the seed or a
[27:15] denomination had planted the seed
[27:19] or theology had planted a seed you
[27:22] better be nervous
[27:24] that's not the seed I'm looking for and
[27:27] if you don't think some materials that
[27:28] are out there is man seed instead of
[27:30] gods you don't have much discernment you
[27:32] better be Discerning what's God's seed
[27:34] what's God's spoken word from the
[27:36] original
[27:37] or what's man seed because if he plants
[27:39] man he plants his seed it'll just bring
[27:42] forth if a denominational system plants
[27:45] denominational seed it will bring a
[27:47] denominational crop
[27:53] but I believe that the son of man plants
[27:55] his seed by his word it brings forth
[27:57] Sons and Daughters of God
[28:00] and it won't return void that's why he
[28:01] has patience this is why the husbandman
[28:03] he's not nervous he's not he's not
[28:06] scared he has patience and then the next
[28:10] verse and so now and then it brings in
[28:12] the former latter rain which is prophecy
[28:14] for the end time the former and latter
[28:16] rain coming right close together and
[28:18] incidentally the former Reign he he
[28:19] showed in the Greek meaning or the
[28:21] Hebrew meaning was a a teaching Reign it
[28:24] is a teaching range so something comes
[28:25] forth as a teaching Reign but that's not
[28:28] the only rain right close together then
[28:30] there there is the spirit that the rain
[28:32] that comes to bring forth the our the
[28:34] Harvest these are all prophecies for the
[28:36] end time but what good would the rain do
[28:39] if he hasn't planted his word see
[28:43] and what good would the word do if he
[28:46] doesn't send the rain
[28:47] what good is it if he opens up the
[28:49] entire Bible and he doesn't send his
[28:51] spirit and pour it out upon the people
[28:54] can I get an amen this morning I can't
[28:56] get no help this morning this is what
[28:58] God is doing in the end time don't worry
[29:01] about politics don't worry about the
[29:03] economy look at what God's doing he's
[29:06] planted his seed and it will come forth
[29:09] in a harvest
[29:10] it'll bring rapturing Faith to a people
[29:14] I tell you I want to be that crop I want
[29:16] to be right there and I want to be
[29:18] patient with what God has planted
[29:21] as in you it wasn't some preacher it was
[29:23] God spoken through a prophet that
[29:25] planted the seeds for this hour I
[29:27] believe it with all my heart and so now
[29:29] James is this so much could be preached
[29:32] on this but this early and latter rain
[29:34] and break down what it is and that
[29:36] without interpreting it because whatever
[29:38] still has to come to pass I fear in
[29:41] interpreting that I just know here's
[29:43] here's where I'm settled what's coming
[29:45] what's coming and let me say something
[29:48] whatever has not come yet for the bride
[29:51] we should be very careful that we're not
[29:54] interpreting what's coming
[29:58] that's where we get in trouble God
[30:00] doesn't need you to interpret what's
[30:01] coming next and it's actually what
[30:03] creates nervousness in certain groups
[30:05] and nervousness of people and here's
[30:07] another thing that happens is that when
[30:09] you have a delay of that okay when is
[30:11] this going to climax when is it going to
[30:13] be this full swing of rapturing faith
[30:15] and get the bride out here when is it
[30:16] and when you're nervous about that the
[30:18] tendency is to try to create something
[30:20] and many men many men reach back into
[30:23] their comfort zone of their past
[30:26] experiences
[30:27] in Pentecost and say I'm comfortable
[30:30] with that God moved on me back then so
[30:32] maybe that's what's going to happen be
[30:34] careful
[30:36] let's just keep close to the word let's
[30:38] be patient let's let this word bring
[30:40] forth the way it's supposed to bring
[30:42] forth let's surrender Our Lives let's be
[30:45] dedicated Christians let's stay filled
[30:47] with the spirit but let God bring the
[30:49] final work of this of rapturing Faith
[30:51] the way he wants to bring it is that
[30:53] okay with everybody
[30:55] be careful that men don't catch you into
[30:57] some type of movement that's bringing
[30:59] back the pastor trying to interpret
[31:01] what's supposed to happen this is the
[31:02] bride's Revival I think we should let
[31:04] God interpret his word by bringing it to
[31:06] pass
[31:07] that's what he told us to do what is it
[31:09] his patience
[31:11] this husband is not nervous God's plan
[31:14] the son of man has planted his seed in
[31:16] this hour
[31:17] the son of man is planted in Sea
[31:20] so he hath long patience I'm waiting I'm
[31:24] waiting I'm waiting and while I'm
[31:26] waiting
[31:27] I'm not sitting on a chair somewhere not
[31:29] doing anything I'm waiting for this word
[31:31] but I'm I'm being a witness
[31:34] I'm being a vessel that can be used of
[31:37] God you should do that
[31:39] Lord where's the last elected sea let me
[31:42] be a vessel let it come through me can
[31:44] you say Amen
[31:46] we might have to cut this part out I
[31:47] wouldn't want them to hear this but I
[31:49] brought it up Wednesday night and I
[31:50] don't bring it as a praise to me but I
[31:52] know who I am I know he's placed his
[31:54] word in me and I know when I pray I
[31:57] believe my prayers are answered
[31:58] I prayed for that and made that works
[32:00] for us I prayed for her sister to come
[32:02] over last last Thursday I went to one of
[32:05] our homes she was cleaning it with her
[32:07] mom her mom starts to cry because it
[32:09] didn't look good that her daughter would
[32:10] be able to come from Cuba and I grabbed
[32:12] their hands and I said we're going to
[32:13] pray right now
[32:18] I said God we've been praying this but
[32:19] Lord I want to say one more time
[32:21] supernaturally open the doors for this
[32:23] sister and this daughter to come home we
[32:26] put it before God her mom just wept
[32:29] see the son and daughter they don't
[32:30] believe in God at all but the mom does
[32:33] and she believes two days later
[32:38] paperwork went through
[32:40] and she was here what night did she come
[32:42] home they flew over she's about 12 hours
[32:45] in Miami
[32:46] and going through immigration but she
[32:48] had her papers within days she's here
[32:51] that's that's Friday night she's here
[32:54] already with her family and they're
[32:56] rejoicing but I just want to add this
[32:58] and we like to take this out
[33:01] The Joy it gives me is that the dad I
[33:03] thought it was the mom but the dad
[33:04] mostly he's an atheist he doesn't
[33:07] believe in God
[33:09] and his wife told him that we prayed and
[33:12] two days later they opened and he says
[33:14] God's hearing that man's prayer I
[33:17] believe there is a God
[33:26] now that may seem very basic to all of
[33:28] us message people let me tell you
[33:30] something that's what I live for if I
[33:33] can be a vessel to take an atheist and
[33:35] say I'm starting to believe in God
[33:36] there's a real God he can answer prayer
[33:40] that's what I'm here for
[33:43] and you're a vessel too
[33:46] your prayer is important to God
[33:49] but this husband and he waits and the
[33:52] thing about the waiting is it's you know
[33:54] people who act different to when they
[33:56] have to wait for something Americans are
[33:58] not very good Waiters
[34:00] we get everything quick you know we got
[34:02] we got drive-throughs which they're not
[34:06] as quick as they used to be but we got
[34:07] drive-throughs we've got instant
[34:09] potatoes and we've got poof this and
[34:11] poof that and microwave and bang right
[34:14] Bang Bang Bang
[34:16] and it conditions us we want stuff right
[34:19] now I want that loan right now I want
[34:22] that new truck or that car right now
[34:24] we're conditioned by America and then we
[34:27] come over to God and we say God I want
[34:30] it right now
[34:33] probably shouldn't say that
[34:36] just pray with faith let God bring it
[34:39] when he wants to bring it even if it's
[34:40] 20 years later
[34:43] because you spoke it it's before a high
[34:46] priest he acknowledges what you've
[34:48] spoken let him do the work
[34:50] but we get impatient we don't and even
[34:52] though the scripture says to be still
[34:54] and know God
[34:56] you forget that when you want a prayer
[34:57] answered right now
[35:00] we forget the church says they that wait
[35:02] upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[35:05] there's a renewing of your strength by
[35:08] waiting and being patient on God
[35:11] come on people say amen
[35:13] but you know there's something that
[35:15] happens when people get impatient and
[35:17] they can do a lot of you know they can
[35:19] they can just they get sometimes they
[35:21] start doing crazy things I believe that
[35:23] some of the craziness that follows our
[35:25] movement is people waiting for the
[35:28] coming of the Lord and waiting for
[35:29] what's next and so they start kind of
[35:31] going Lulu
[35:32] with false Doctrine and interpreting
[35:35] things and going off this way and going
[35:37] off this deep end and a lot of it is the
[35:39] nervous what's coming next what's coming
[35:41] next and they get and they try to make
[35:43] something happen like Abraham and Sarah
[35:45] when Sarah said it's not happening it's
[35:48] not happening take Hagar have relations
[35:50] with her maybe that's what God meant is
[35:53] Hagar
[35:54] nothing but a mess
[35:57] every time we
[35:59] get ahead of God we produce ishmaels in
[36:04] our lives
[36:06] in the movement within our movement in
[36:08] the message there's ishmael's produced
[36:10] by people trying to produce something
[36:13] and push it
[36:16] brings in denominational seed
[36:19] you know people get nervous when they're
[36:20] waiting for something we used to have a
[36:22] brother here and instantly brother Bill
[36:23] Chandler he's passed away years ago
[36:26] he helped me start the church and he's
[36:28] actually the first one who started up
[36:29] our building fund he says we need to
[36:30] have a building fund this this building
[36:32] is some of it is result for him 35 years
[36:36] ago saying we need a building fund we
[36:37] start need to start saving money so he's
[36:39] gone but that was a lot of his
[36:41] contribution but brother Bill he was a
[36:42] uh he was a good
[36:45] very good brother helped us start the
[36:47] church and just very uh faithful love
[36:49] this message with all of his heart uh
[36:52] sister Shelley is here this morning she
[36:53] probably remembers Bill Chandler and his
[36:56] wife Phyllis and they were just
[36:57] wonderful people and he he was he was he
[37:00] had a lot of health problems he couldn't
[37:01] come to church the last couple years
[37:03] he's just so bad such in bad Health but
[37:05] brother Bill you know when I was single
[37:07] in town here he would invite me over for
[37:10] dinner and but he was a guy that some
[37:13] people are okay with people being late
[37:14] when you call him for dinner brother
[37:16] Bill wasn't good with that
[37:19] and you know some people they just okay
[37:21] we'll just wait not brother Bill it's
[37:23] like he went hysterical he went off the
[37:25] deep end and I loved him to death but
[37:27] man within 10 minutes of me being late
[37:29] he's calling me and if he wouldn't call
[37:32] me he's calling the police looking for
[37:33] me
[37:35] I'm serious he called the police looking
[37:38] for where where's brother Paul I'm
[37:40] nervous something has happened to him he
[37:42] finally get a hold me I said I'm on my
[37:44] way I'm sorry to be late and he's just
[37:46] he was going to have a heart attack just
[37:48] just because you know it's late you know
[37:50] why what is he doing and I love the man
[37:52] to death we had a lot of things
[37:55] in common he loved hamburgers
[38:00] uh mom
[38:02] got me
[38:04] suspenders for my birthday
[38:07] so
[38:10] thank you
[38:16] it's probably the last time I'll wear
[38:17] them for Mom for his mother's day
[38:20] but I'm trying them
[38:23] they're holding everything up
[38:26] hopefully
[38:30] um what's that talking about
[38:33] oh brother bill so I mean you know he
[38:36] just you know and and to me you know
[38:38] it's like when people when you ask
[38:40] somebody to come to dinner and they're
[38:42] late you know I don't really care I
[38:45] usually just go ahead and eat
[38:49] it's their problem their loss you know
[38:51] if they're 10 min okay I'll give them 10
[38:53] minutes but no but in this this shows
[38:56] how people in the delay how many knows
[38:58] there's a delay after God speaks
[39:01] something then there's a delay there's a
[39:03] there's a seventh seal with silence
[39:05] doesn't look like God's doing very much
[39:09] and it's in the delay that people get
[39:11] nervous and start going crazy and making
[39:13] up things and they're waiting they're
[39:15] waiting but this scripture for the
[39:16] coming Lord tells us that we are to be
[39:19] patient unto the coming of the Lord none
[39:21] of us thought we would be here till now
[39:23] by the way none of us thought we'd be
[39:25] past 77. none of us thought we'd raise
[39:27] children none of us I never thought my
[39:28] my kids would graduate high school none
[39:31] of us we thought we would be out of here
[39:32] but it's not up to us it's when his seed
[39:36] that he planted is going to bring forth
[39:38] a crop can you say man and bring
[39:40] rapturing Faith by a lot of rain for the
[39:43] people when that is coming to its full
[39:45] fruition then we'll see God finish his
[39:49] work but we never believe we'd be here
[39:50] to 2023 but people get nervous they try
[39:53] to make up things they try to oh we got
[39:55] to do this no he wants us to say be
[39:57] patient unto the coming of the Lord
[40:00] for he hath planted the seed and if he's
[40:05] planted it we're waiting till the crop
[40:07] comes up the way that he wants it
[40:10] he has sold the seed can you say Amen
[40:13] so this farmer it's confidence in the
[40:17] seed and who sowed the seed it's the
[40:20] good seed because the son of man has
[40:22] planted his good seed in the end time
[40:25] through his mouth and through his
[40:27] Prophet so shall it be in the coming of
[40:29] the son man Jesus himself said it he
[40:32] said so shall it be in the coming of the
[40:35] son of man so in other words when Jesus
[40:37] said in Matthew here about the parable
[40:40] of the sowing when he says the son of
[40:43] man is the one who plants and sows The
[40:46] Good Seed and then the same Jesus you're
[40:49] listening the same Jesus said so shall
[40:52] it be in the coming of the son of man
[40:57] as in the days of Sodom
[40:59] as in the days of Noah so shall it be in
[41:02] the coming of the son of man
[41:04] he would come and say well yeah he's
[41:06] going to come and meet us in the sky no
[41:07] no first of all what's he do he comes
[41:10] with The Good Seed
[41:13] places it
[41:15] in the generation
[41:16] and now the bride just says Lord
[41:21] I'm having long patience for this
[41:24] because it's not my own righteousness
[41:27] it's not me trying to put something on
[41:29] I'm not going to try to make something
[41:31] work I'm going to enjoy worship and
[41:33] enjoy what you give me in the word
[41:34] because I know you're continued to mold
[41:36] me into an adopted son and daughter of
[41:38] God I'm going to continue that but the
[41:40] final result in the climax did all this
[41:42] I cannot make this happen you've planted
[41:46] the seed you're sending the former
[41:48] latter rain I don't want to touch it and
[41:50] produce an Ishmael I don't want to do
[41:53] anything to it and I'm certainly not
[41:55] bailing out
[41:56] does anybody see in the scripture where
[41:59] the farmer is saying I've waited long
[42:01] enough I'm out of here I'm leaving this
[42:03] message
[42:05] you can't find it in the elect in the
[42:07] end time the elector's saying he's
[42:10] planted the seed the son of man has come
[42:12] indented in the end time and I'm staying
[42:15] until I see this good seed bring forth
[42:19] what God said it would bring forth
[42:21] I'm here to stay can you say Amen
[42:23] can't find that farmer running off
[42:25] because he know it's the good seed and
[42:27] he knows who's planted it he didn't
[42:29] plant it himself but it's good seed and
[42:31] it's going to bring this Harvest
[42:33] oh hasten that day Lord
[42:36] but he said the son of man so the son of
[42:38] man is going to repeat himself again if
[42:39] anybody doesn't understand the repeat
[42:41] process of scriptures you're not going
[42:43] to understand the Bible because you're
[42:45] what you're going to say I believe
[42:46] everything here but I don't believe God
[42:47] can do it again in our day you don't
[42:49] understand the repeat process
[42:52] because what he did in the past he can
[42:53] repeat it again
[42:55] if he raised the dead in the past he can
[42:57] raise the dead this morning
[42:59] if he opened up blind eyes back then he
[43:01] can do it this morning
[43:03] don't you dare interpret God's word and
[43:05] if he sent a prophet in the past he can
[43:07] send a prophet in our day
[43:09] if he said that the son of man will
[43:12] repeat again and what he'll be doing is
[43:14] planting The Good Seed then if Jesus
[43:16] said that I believe it
[43:18] and that settles it no matter how long
[43:21] it takes for each elect to find it he
[43:25] has long patience for it it's a and
[43:28] that's my title this morning faith in
[43:30] the seed sown by the son of man Faith
[43:33] what we need is faith we don't need in
[43:35] faith in something from a message from
[43:37] the past we need faith in the seed
[43:39] that's been sown now
[43:42] how many believe that we need faith in
[43:44] that
[43:46] faith that he has faith that he has sent
[43:48] the former Reign the teaching Reign it's
[43:51] already out there in the field something
[43:53] should be said about this impatience and
[43:56] this nervousness further because even
[44:00] John the Baptist himself who was the
[44:03] Forerunner of the first coming of Christ
[44:05] once he spoke it once he said Behold the
[44:09] Lamb of God who takes away the sin of
[44:12] the world and then he says when he
[44:14] proclaimed here he is then he said I
[44:18] must decrease he must increase the
[44:21] office of John with the spirit of Elijah
[44:24] was fulfilled at that day and he stepped
[44:27] back you can no longer just follow his
[44:29] office you had to follow Christ
[44:33] a transition
[44:36] and so he said Behold the Lamb of God
[44:38] but look what happened to John he gets
[44:40] in prison he gets depressed
[44:42] sends his disciples he's wondering
[44:45] is he the one
[44:47] got his eagle eyes filmed over
[44:49] what can happen during the delay Satan
[44:52] can bring you a bunch of doubts
[44:56] so we're not talking just see Jesus said
[44:59] there's not a man risen greater than
[45:01] John the Baptist and the greatest one of
[45:03] the greatest prophets to initiate this
[45:04] this Covenant with Christ coming in one
[45:06] of the greatest prophets sat in the
[45:08] prison and doubted
[45:10] he had already said this is the Lamb
[45:13] so our human minds and the nervousness
[45:15] is it's not happening quick enough
[45:19] when's he going to set up his kingdom
[45:21] this is the Messiah this is the Lamb of
[45:23] God when's it all going to happen and it
[45:24] wasn't happening quick enough and he
[45:26] began to wonder
[45:27] is this the one
[45:31] but he didn't have this principle I'm
[45:32] preaching to you this morning and that
[45:34] is that if you know who's planted the
[45:36] seed and you know you've spoken the word
[45:38] of God by saying behold this is the Lamb
[45:39] of God then you see you you rest in the
[45:43] word of God
[45:44] G the logos
[45:48] was a word of God and why did God Rest
[45:51] the seventh day
[45:53] does anybody know
[45:55] because the other six days he had spoken
[45:57] the spoken word of God and spoke all
[45:59] things in existence even his own son
[46:02] creative power and on the seventh day
[46:05] after he created it all he stepped back
[46:07] and rested and what did he rest in he
[46:10] rested in his spoken word
[46:13] now that this is spoken there isn't any
[46:15] devil in hell that's going to stop it
[46:17] can I get an amen if God spoke it no
[46:21] devil in hell is going to stop it if
[46:22] God's got a hold of your wayward child
[46:24] there's nothing going to stop and
[46:26] there's no devil in hell that's going to
[46:27] keep them from coming back to God
[46:31] if God's got their number and their
[46:33] predestinated seat of God they're going
[46:34] to come back
[46:36] no matter how long it takes if God's
[46:38] involved he doesn't say something in the
[46:40] oh I shouldn't have said that we do that
[46:42] sometimes we say it was I shouldn't have
[46:44] said that God's never said I shouldn't
[46:46] have said
[46:47] God has never said I should have said
[46:49] that when he speaks it the first time
[46:52] it's done it'll go out it'll bring a
[46:55] crop
[46:55] and it will not return without a
[46:59] prospering can you say man a harvest
[47:01] everything he said and it would happen
[47:03] it's going to come back just the same
[47:07] praise be to God and the next verse he
[47:10] says and hath long patience for it and
[47:13] then he says again be patient unto the
[47:15] coming of the Lord
[47:17] ah be patient unto the coming of the
[47:21] Lord
[47:22] and I like how he words it I'm going to
[47:23] have to go back and word it just the way
[47:25] he said it here Hebrews excuse me James
[47:28] 5
[47:29] be patient he says it again be patient
[47:32] unto the coming of the Lord
[47:35] please find it brother Paul please
[47:40] uh
[47:44] establish your hearts
[47:47] so where does our stability come from
[47:52] not from trusting in a screen
[47:56] because that can work sometimes and it
[47:58] don't work other times 99 of the time it
[48:01] works because those guys make it work
[48:02] way to go
[48:04] uh this is be patient I already said be
[48:07] patient the former latter rain come
[48:09] he's put in the crop
[48:11] be patient establish your heart for the
[48:13] coming of the Lord joth night does
[48:15] anybody see instability nervousness
[48:18] that's what the world's in right now
[48:20] because they don't know where we're at
[48:23] they can feel brother Branham says that
[48:26] animals if you look at them out that
[48:28] little that little sheep out there there
[48:30] was a lion he said he watched a lion
[48:32] over in the bushes and he's trying to
[48:34] figure out why this sheep is nervous he
[48:36] senses that line he couldn't see that
[48:37] line then he could see it see why the
[48:38] Sheep was nervous
[48:40] you see Nature has a sense of what's
[48:42] coming this world is scared to death
[48:45] and they have no trust in government
[48:47] they have no trust even in Donald Trump
[48:49] there's nobody going to fix this
[48:52] so but we're not a part of the
[48:54] nervousness
[48:55] we're not a part of the instability and
[48:58] why is that because God has planted his
[49:02] word in this generation
[49:05] God sends the rain to bring forth
[49:08] rapturing faith
[49:10] that's why you can't find instability or
[49:13] hearts that are failing for fear not in
[49:16] the elect be patient first time he says
[49:19] be patient to the coming of the Lord
[49:20] because we know he's planted the seed
[49:22] now be patient establish your heart for
[49:24] the coming of the Lord drawth nigh I
[49:27] find my stability in establishing my
[49:29] heart
[49:30] right here
[49:32] right here can you find it this morning
[49:36] I'll go right to the simplest question
[49:38] to you all of you here
[49:41] if the Lord comes tomorrow where is your
[49:43] heart right now
[49:45] are you saved
[49:48] have you received the Lord
[49:51] and for those who are going to rapture
[49:53] we know that it will be the ones that go
[49:56] in because Jesus said there'll be wise
[49:58] virgins and foolish virgins some who are
[50:01] left behind they're virgins they're very
[50:04] dedicated Christians but Jesus separated
[50:07] two crowds and said the one who have oil
[50:09] oil is the Holy Spirit the ones who go
[50:11] in the Rapture are the ones who have
[50:14] this Holy Spirit
[50:16] so what Jesus said it's what Jesus said
[50:18] I didn't separate him he separated him
[50:20] I'll tell you I ask you are you ready to
[50:23] go
[50:25] do you have the true Holy Spirit in your
[50:27] life and the identification of the
[50:29] response and obedience to the word of
[50:31] God
[50:33] praise the Lord amen
[50:38] so
[50:40] I'm going to bring this down here with
[50:42] just a quote
[50:45] so this in this time of the coming lord
[50:48] it's strange times
[50:50] during the former and latter rain and
[50:52] these close together the sowing time and
[50:54] then waiting time it does not look like
[50:57] God is doing anything although he is
[50:59] doing things but what we're hungry for
[51:01] for him to do
[51:03] um because whatever God's going to do
[51:05] we're hungry for it that's what gets
[51:07] people in Troublesome they're hungry or
[51:08] something they try to produce something
[51:09] but if you have the hunger for God to
[51:13] manifest himself the way he wants to in
[51:15] the last days before the Rapture if you
[51:17] have that hunger I read the quote
[51:18] Wednesday night why do you hunger thirst
[51:20] he said why do you hunger Church why do
[51:23] you thirst Church why are you hungering
[51:25] for it he said it's the father trying to
[51:27] get this hidden Mystery to you but you
[51:29] let so many things get in the way let me
[51:31] remember that quote from Wednesday night
[51:32] it's a powerful quote friends because
[51:34] it's the father he's not given up he's
[51:36] trying to get something to you but we
[51:38] let the cares of life will everything
[51:40] distract us from it we ought to be
[51:42] reaching back to the Lord just as much
[51:44] as he's reaching to us show me this Lord
[51:47] open my eyes
[51:49] let me see where I'm at right now that's
[51:51] where my stability is
[51:53] but in this time it's a strange time
[51:56] it doesn't look like God is doing
[51:58] anything or you know
[52:02] doesn't look like God's doing things so
[52:03] let's make some noise and make it look
[52:05] like God's doing something
[52:09] but the real work of God that he's doing
[52:12] is a crop coming up
[52:15] and there's really no noise to any of
[52:18] that
[52:20] now I I know friends what the what it
[52:23] says that wherever God's working there's
[52:25] going to be some noise where the a birth
[52:27] is a mess
[52:30] we know that by Nature
[52:31] you know I doubt a dry-eyed repentance
[52:34] if somebody's broken they're repenting
[52:36] then there's going to be a mess they're
[52:38] going to be messed up I used to watch
[52:39] women and they repent and the true
[52:41] repentance and alter and the mascara is
[52:44] going down and they look pretty ugly
[52:46] when it's all over with
[52:48] but they got a hold of God
[52:51] and so I know the birth is a mess and I
[52:55] know just like we heard this morning
[52:56] when there's the stimulation of
[52:58] Revelation and God's work in our hearts
[52:59] we want to come and worship freely if
[53:01] you worship quietly to raise your hands
[53:03] and weep or if you if you want to dance
[53:05] around the whole room praise Lord we
[53:07] have that sometimes I say praise God
[53:09] we're not afraid of any of it
[53:11] but the complete evidence that God is
[53:13] Among Us is not noise
[53:16] and we should never use it as the
[53:18] evidence that God is Among Us because
[53:21] the deepest things in God don't have any
[53:24] noise to them
[53:30] this crop that's coming up the farmer is
[53:33] not out there listening for the noise
[53:36] in the crop
[53:41] the prophet said the son is the most
[53:44] probably the most powerful force he said
[53:46] when the sun comes up and Rises it's so
[53:49] powerful and if you get up early enough
[53:50] to see the sunrise it's coming up but
[53:53] you can't hear it
[53:55] it's the most powerful thing arising on
[53:57] the Earth
[53:59] but there's no noise to it
[54:01] but is it powerful is it going to pull
[54:03] the crops up is it going to work can you
[54:05] say man is it going to give us daylight
[54:07] can you say man it's ever been powerful
[54:10] and the Son of God is ever been powerful
[54:12] to do his work
[54:14] but it isn't always with a lot of noise
[54:18] but is it a work of God yes the crop is
[54:21] coming up can you say amen he grows it
[54:23] quietly and he brings it to a harvest
[54:25] remember the Rapture will be a secret
[54:28] it's not going to be a public show
[54:30] the Final Phase of all this is not some
[54:33] public show that's all over the news
[54:36] God
[54:38] like a thief in the night takes his
[54:40] bride away
[54:41] she feels that sweep in that wave and
[54:43] she goes in another body and change and
[54:46] most of the world won't even know that
[54:48] it's went on
[54:49] can you say Amen
[54:51] be a secret just like your relationship
[54:53] with the lord it's a secret it's a
[54:55] secret communication it's a secret
[54:57] relationship with him it's deeper than
[55:00] just a shouting
[55:04] but the real work he's doing is a crop
[55:06] came coming up and when it's mature when
[55:09] this Harvest is mature the former Reign
[55:12] the teaching the sowing and then the
[55:13] latter rain bringing on that rapturing
[55:15] faith so that we can get out of here and
[55:18] I'm going to read one thing through here
[55:19] and I want you to know something very as
[55:21] I use this word strange he's going to
[55:23] use it here strange strange time when
[55:26] it's in the delay waiting for something
[55:28] else waiting for the next thing to come
[55:31] strange times
[55:33] I found this last night I was so
[55:35] inspired it's what I built based the
[55:36] sermon on this morning and it won't be
[55:38] much longer but let's just read this
[55:40] together let's read this together and
[55:42] this is in the pick up your pen and
[55:43] write inside of the programmers Church
[55:46] age when brother Branham refers to uh
[55:49] pick up your pen and write and this is
[55:51] the things he said and it is related to
[55:52] the seed as well now I want to be
[55:54] careful here
[55:55] and and see this God has promised that
[55:58] at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be
[56:00] fulfilled it has to be for it is the
[56:02] spirit quickened the word of God spoken
[56:04] by the prophet Malachi Jesus referred to
[56:07] it is just before Christ comes the
[56:09] second time Jesus referred to it so
[56:12] there was a forerunner to the first for
[56:14] those of you don't know
[56:15] there was a forerunner to the first
[56:17] coming of Christ a man with the spirit
[56:19] of Elijah who was that John the Baptist
[56:22] and then Jesus said Elijah truly shall
[56:24] first come and restore all things so
[56:25] before the second coming of Christ he'll
[56:28] use a man with the spirit of Elijah it's
[56:30] not about the man but if he did it
[56:31] before he can do it again and Jesus said
[56:34] that he would
[56:35] now he is not Christ but he will be used
[56:38] in order in this generation to begin the
[56:41] process of planting the seed and
[56:43] bringing it on to the coming of the Lord
[56:44] he said now is though it has to be for
[56:47] the spirit quick and word of God spoken
[56:49] by the prophet of God Jesus referred to
[56:51] it it is just before Christ comes the
[56:53] second time by the time Jesus comes all
[56:56] scripture must be fulfilled the Gentile
[56:58] dispensation will be in the last Church
[57:00] age when that messenger of Malachi comes
[57:04] he will be right with the word he will
[57:06] take the whole Bible from Genesis to
[57:08] Revelation he will start at the serpent
[57:10] seed and carry on to the messenger in
[57:12] the latter rain but he will be rejected
[57:14] by denominations now there's a principle
[57:17] throughout the Bible true prophets of
[57:19] God from Moses to Elijah to to uh uh to
[57:23] Noah were rejected the world rejected
[57:26] their message
[57:29] what are the distinctions in God's true
[57:31] prophets is they will be rejected
[57:34] but he will be resurrected by
[57:36] denominations he has to be for this is
[57:38] history repeating itself from the time
[57:40] of Abraham Ahab Israel's history under
[57:42] Hab is happening right here in America
[57:44] where the prophet of Malachi appears so
[57:47] here's Israel's history as Israel left
[57:49] Egypt to Worship in Freedom pushed out
[57:51] the natives raised up a nation with
[57:53] great leaders like David
[57:54] Etc and then put on Abe Ahab on the
[57:57] throne he married Jezebel with the
[57:59] Jezebel behind him to direct so have we
[58:01] done the very same thing in America our
[58:04] forefathers left for this land to
[58:06] worship and live in Freedom they pushed
[58:08] back the natives and took over the land
[58:11] he is bringing our day with back in
[58:14] Israel's day when they had all the good
[58:16] men of God and then and then they got an
[58:19] Ahab who was a backslider married the
[58:22] wrong woman and during that time is the
[58:24] same time he sent Elijah
[58:26] history repeats itself he's saying that
[58:29] our nation if you don't understand what
[58:30] he's saying Kennedy was the first
[58:32] Catholic President we left Europe to
[58:35] come to this country to get away from
[58:37] the oppression of religious
[58:39] organizations like
[58:41] Catholic and like brother rap brought up
[58:43] the other night in our Wednesday night
[58:44] studies of the church ages it wasn't
[58:46] just it wasn't just the Cox system but
[58:49] it was actually the Church of England
[58:50] started to put pressure as well on the
[58:52] pilgrims
[58:54] so anytime you have religious
[58:56] organizations like that they're putting
[58:58] pressure on there's no freedom of the
[59:01] spirit
[59:03] it's not the people but it's the systems
[59:05] that start to bind people it's Babylon
[59:08] it's in the book of Revelations by the
[59:09] way and so now we leave there to get
[59:12] away from that system and in 1963 I
[59:16] think it was or 64. we elect our first
[59:18] Catholic President bringing that system
[59:22] back in again
[59:25] that's a big change and all of a sudden
[59:27] you have to wait a minute
[59:29] Ahab
[59:32] Book of Revelations attaches that system
[59:34] to The Jezebel as brother rap did the
[59:37] other night clearly in the Book of
[59:38] Revelations
[59:40] Jezebel types in the Bible that
[59:43] religious system
[59:45] Ahab marries Jezebel so our president is
[59:48] married to that system
[59:50] comes into the presidency
[59:52] he's a fine man I'm not talking about
[59:54] the man he's a fine man but it's just
[59:56] the whole symbolism of what's happened
[59:58] right at that time I'll send Elijah he
[1:00:01] has to send Elijah if the type's true
[1:00:05] our forefathers left for this land of
[1:00:07] worship and live in the freedom they
[1:00:08] pushed back the natives and took over
[1:00:10] the land mighty men like Washington and
[1:00:12] Lincoln were raised up after a while
[1:00:14] other men of such poor calibers
[1:00:16] succeeded these worthy men that soon in
[1:00:18] Ahab was set up in the presidential
[1:00:20] chair with a jezebel behind him to
[1:00:22] direct him it is at such a time as this
[1:00:24] that the message of Malachi must come
[1:00:26] then in the latter rain will come in
[1:00:29] Mount Carmel Showdown watch this
[1:00:31] carefully now to see it in the word
[1:00:33] John was the Foreigner of Malachi 3 he
[1:00:36] planted the former Reign and was
[1:00:37] rejected by the organizations of his day
[1:00:39] Jesus came and had a mount
[1:00:41] Transfiguration Showdown the second
[1:00:42] Forerunner of Christ was so for the
[1:00:44] latter Reign Jesus will be the showdown
[1:00:47] between the denominations and Creeds for
[1:00:49] he will come to back up his word and
[1:00:51] take his bride in the rapture
[1:00:53] so that's the ultimate this is what's
[1:00:54] going in the rapture
[1:00:56] but what brings about that faith and
[1:00:58] that sweep to bring us into Rapture
[1:01:00] first God sends through the mouth of a
[1:01:02] prophet to plant the seed
[1:01:05] for rapturing faith and that's already
[1:01:08] happened
[1:01:09] now has it happened individually for you
[1:01:12] I can't answer that question he's done
[1:01:15] it dispensationally he's sent his word
[1:01:16] and sowed his word seed but you have to
[1:01:19] have that happen to you individually
[1:01:23] the first Showdown was Mount Carmel the
[1:01:25] second was about Transfiguration and the
[1:01:26] third will be Mount Zion the strange
[1:01:28] behavior of Moses now here's where I
[1:01:30] want you this is the quote I want you to
[1:01:31] read as I'm closing right the strange
[1:01:34] behavior of Moses Elijah and John
[1:01:37] withdrawing from the people into
[1:01:40] seclusion left many confused
[1:01:45] now I read that isn't that interesting
[1:01:50] it happened in all three of these men
[1:01:52] Moses Elijah and John and he says when
[1:01:56] they when there was a withdrawing from
[1:01:58] the people into seclusion which you
[1:02:00] watch in their lives at different
[1:02:02] intervals or specific times I should say
[1:02:05] we watch that happen
[1:02:07] and when they do it when they withdraw
[1:02:10] just like John he comes out there I just
[1:02:12] said Behold the Lamb of God then he goes
[1:02:14] into prison where's John what's going on
[1:02:16] and that creates that creates
[1:02:20] left many confused as time goes on it's
[1:02:23] like what's what's going on next
[1:02:27] what's happening next
[1:02:29] confusion matter of fact some people say
[1:02:31] well man there's nothing to this I'm out
[1:02:33] I'm bailing out I read to the scripture
[1:02:35] last Sunday
[1:02:37] Jesus had 5 000 followers at the
[1:02:39] beginning of John chapter six at the end
[1:02:41] he's got 12 followers and one's a devil
[1:02:44] how did that happen many of his
[1:02:46] disciples just left him after that there
[1:02:48] they exited I'm done because they don't
[1:02:50] understand the completeness of the word
[1:02:53] and what God has put he's saying it
[1:02:55] right in John 6. my words that I speak
[1:02:57] unto you why was 5 000 people following
[1:03:00] Jesus because he multiplied the fishes
[1:03:02] and lows and they were fed of that and
[1:03:04] they're they're all hyped up about the
[1:03:06] Miracles and signs and wonders they were
[1:03:08] going to make him a king but very few
[1:03:11] want the word can you say Amen to see
[1:03:14] the word planted in their lives
[1:03:16] they all leave and he says the strange
[1:03:19] Behavior Moses Elijah and John withdrawn
[1:03:21] from the people in seclusion left many
[1:03:22] confused they did not realize that it
[1:03:26] was because their messages had been
[1:03:29] rejected Bible patterned
[1:03:31] as a whole their message was rejected
[1:03:34] but this is the part that I wanted to
[1:03:36] close on and Shout
[1:03:39] but the seed
[1:03:42] had been sown
[1:03:44] the planting was over
[1:03:47] that's where you find this husbandman
[1:03:50] with great patience to the coming of the
[1:03:52] Lord
[1:03:53] because guess what the seed has been
[1:03:56] sown
[1:03:57] by the son of man
[1:03:59] and these Godly men these prophets you
[1:04:02] know why they just backed off because
[1:04:03] even I've been preaching about
[1:04:07] Elijah in the cave third part of his
[1:04:10] ministry
[1:04:11] Mount Carmel
[1:04:12] Jupiter tree depression thought
[1:04:15] everybody rejected him Jezebel's running
[1:04:16] after him but then the cave God shows
[1:04:19] him I'm not in the earthquake I'm not in
[1:04:21] the wind I'm not in the fire
[1:04:23] I'm in the still Small Voice taking them
[1:04:25] on to that third mystery of the third
[1:04:26] pole
[1:04:28] you see and so now when when we speak of
[1:04:30] Elijah coming into that he withdraws
[1:04:33] himself into conclusion but guess what
[1:04:35] the word has already been planted
[1:04:37] that's why they would they withdrawal
[1:04:40] because I'm Lord I brought your word and
[1:04:42] the whole world seems to be rejecting it
[1:04:44] that's what Elijah felt in that cave and
[1:04:46] Jupiter he said nobody's believing me
[1:04:48] Jezebel's nipping at my heels here
[1:04:50] what's going on and they go into that
[1:04:52] they'll go into hiding what's going on
[1:04:54] where you at Elijah because they the
[1:04:57] whole world is rejected and then God had
[1:04:59] to tell Elijah wait a minute wait a
[1:05:00] minute There's 7 000 out there you don't
[1:05:02] know them if you could just meet them
[1:05:04] they'll believe in your message
[1:05:09] but they went into seclusion because
[1:05:11] their message was rejected but guess
[1:05:13] what guess what the message was have
[1:05:15] been rejected but this is the parliament
[1:05:18] the seed has already been planted and if
[1:05:22] the seeds been planted
[1:05:24] if that work is done all we need to do
[1:05:27] is stay filled with the spirit say God
[1:05:30] let this word bring forth Christ in my
[1:05:33] life
[1:05:34] it'll do the work you don't have to help
[1:05:36] it you yield to him and let him do this
[1:05:39] work in our life have patience to the
[1:05:40] coming of the Lord
[1:05:42] the word seed has been planted the son
[1:05:44] of man is planted it
[1:05:47] that's why
[1:05:48] message is nothing else to me but the
[1:05:50] revealing of Jesus Christ
[1:05:53] I can't see anything else but Christ in
[1:05:55] it in the last days it's Christ revealed
[1:05:57] in the last days it's his work everybody
[1:05:59] see that
[1:06:01] he sent another Elijah again but it's
[1:06:02] not about Elijah he goes off the scene
[1:06:04] Elijah went off the scene
[1:06:06] Moses set up for Joshua what's the type
[1:06:08] of the Holy Spirit to take the people in
[1:06:09] the promised land Moses office was over
[1:06:11] Moses was done don't glorify Moses
[1:06:14] anymore
[1:06:16] and then the other one when Moses does
[1:06:18] that he brings it on to Elijah Moses
[1:06:20] couldn't even go into the promised land
[1:06:21] and then you have the next one Elijah he
[1:06:23] goes out but Elisha comes in Elijah
[1:06:26] Fades out Elijah comes it's a type of
[1:06:28] the Bride
[1:06:31] John phases out his office is over you
[1:06:34] were willing to for a season to rejoice
[1:06:36] in John's light but don't rejoice in
[1:06:38] that light anymore I don't want to just
[1:06:40] sit in services and hear stories about
[1:06:42] William Branham his office has been
[1:06:45] fulfilled
[1:06:48] he is the one who said listen I must
[1:06:51] decrease
[1:06:52] he's here now he must increase
[1:06:55] the seed has been planted and now
[1:06:57] there's going to be a harvest and if he
[1:06:59] can do it that way in the past he can do
[1:07:02] it that way again I'm here to tell you
[1:07:03] if you're a visitor if you're listening
[1:07:04] he's done it again the son of man has
[1:07:07] planted his word seed in this generation
[1:07:11] and we are praying Our Lives we're just
[1:07:13] like you we're hungry for more of God
[1:07:15] and we're praying God let this word be
[1:07:19] born in me
[1:07:21] let this word
[1:07:24] be born in me let this word bring forth
[1:07:27] so quiet It's So Silent it's just like
[1:07:30] but you see I like to encourage your
[1:07:31] friends because you don't know
[1:07:34] see I've been coming around this word
[1:07:36] for many years and sometimes if you look
[1:07:38] at these eyes and the other people's
[1:07:40] lives you say doesn't look like much is
[1:07:43] going on
[1:07:45] that's where we become critical of other
[1:07:47] people that's where we become critical
[1:07:49] here everybody else I said to it
[1:07:50] Wednesday I said Wednesday night or
[1:07:51] Sunday I can't remember anymore when I
[1:07:53] say things but I said something about we
[1:07:55] always have expectations of people
[1:07:57] especially pastors they should be way up
[1:07:59] here by now they've been sitting in my
[1:08:01] church 20 years they should be way up
[1:08:02] here I but I don't decide and you don't
[1:08:05] decide when God chooses
[1:08:08] to bring somebody to repentance
[1:08:10] please keep coming I love having you and
[1:08:12] I'm going to keep preaching I'm going to
[1:08:14] be in your face
[1:08:15] the same way every service and I know
[1:08:18] why some people keep coming but I'm not
[1:08:20] going to change I'm going to preach this
[1:08:21] word God has sown and seen and I'm going
[1:08:23] to preach it to you this is the son of
[1:08:25] man this isn't Paulo Fontaine this isn't
[1:08:28] Paul lafontaine's Church
[1:08:31] I'm just echoing what the seed has been
[1:08:33] sold in this generation by the message
[1:08:35] of the last days but keep coming I'm
[1:08:37] going to keep bringing it to you but
[1:08:38] listen I don't decide when somebody's
[1:08:40] going to really truly repent the Bible
[1:08:42] says it's God that leads you to
[1:08:44] repentance
[1:08:46] so he might lead you in this service
[1:08:47] today repent I'm wrong God I lay
[1:08:50] everything else down I'm a Seed of
[1:08:52] Abraham and I'm leaving my Kindred and
[1:08:54] everything dear to me to come to this
[1:08:55] word
[1:08:58] with others that don't come that easy
[1:09:00] and I've always said if you're a Son of
[1:09:01] God you'll come hard you'll come easy
[1:09:03] but you're coming
[1:09:07] but don't delay if you're feeling a pull
[1:09:08] towards God don't delay
[1:09:10] come to him but I don't decide who it's
[1:09:14] all different times when people feel
[1:09:17] all right I I God's pulling me too much
[1:09:20] I can't deny it God's pulling me too
[1:09:23] much I just can't
[1:09:24] diet
[1:09:26] I must respond to him I can only tell
[1:09:28] you and I don't say this as a threat to
[1:09:30] put you over hell
[1:09:32] I can only tell you if if the Holy
[1:09:34] Spirit In Me Is Right and some of the
[1:09:36] other Christians that I'm talking to
[1:09:37] we are very close to the final stages of
[1:09:41] this
[1:09:43] anybody knows their Bible knows the
[1:09:45] message and those things and look at the
[1:09:46] events in the news and everything where
[1:09:48] we're at right now and I can talk about
[1:09:50] it but just you just if you get into the
[1:09:52] word and you have the Holy Spirit we are
[1:09:55] not we are here
[1:09:58] so I wouldn't delay in repenting
[1:10:01] saying God I'm not I'm going to quit
[1:10:03] messing with this thing if you have
[1:10:04] religion if you have religion
[1:10:07] it's nice but religion won't get you in
[1:10:11] a Rapture in the coming of the Lord
[1:10:13] thank you
[1:10:15] if you have books and tapes of this
[1:10:16] message and you believe God sent a
[1:10:17] prophet thank you that won't get you in
[1:10:20] a Rapture that will not coming to Paula
[1:10:23] fontaine's church or any church
[1:10:25] does not get you in a rapture
[1:10:28] you need to repent you need to say God
[1:10:31] fill my life the things of the world
[1:10:33] become strangely dim and may I die to
[1:10:35] the things of the world I'm ready right
[1:10:37] now to give it to you
[1:10:40] that's when God has you as a candidate
[1:10:42] he can really begin to do something in
[1:10:45] your life
[1:10:46] how many believe the seed has been sown
[1:10:48] by the son of man
[1:10:49] it's already been sown so we can rest it
[1:10:52] in
[1:10:53] let your word
[1:10:55] be born
[1:10:57] in the main let's stand together if you
[1:11:00] would and pray
[1:11:01] just pray let it live in me
[1:11:06] let it start
[1:11:10] oh live inside this house of clay
[1:11:16] and Lord it every day
[1:11:23] [Music]
[1:11:29] singing again now we're gonna pray just
[1:11:32] prepare your heart to pray let your word
[1:11:36] be born
[1:11:39] yes Lord
[1:11:41] oh God
[1:11:44] let it live in me let it start
[1:11:49] let it start
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:12:05] with the manger
[1:12:11] we should pray together now we should
[1:12:14] bow our heads and
[1:12:15] speak to him
[1:12:19] [Music]
[1:12:22] I try to put out of my mind lately and I
[1:12:26] wish you would all of my history and
[1:12:30] all the sermons and all the work of the
[1:12:32] Lord that we've done I try to put on
[1:12:35] mine because I don't want to depend on
[1:12:38] successes that I really can't call mine
[1:12:40] they're actually gods
[1:12:43] but sometimes I won't have a Brokenness
[1:12:45] and a closeness with the Lord because
[1:12:46] I'm living on that I'm okay and I've
[1:12:49] done enough good things in the past I'm
[1:12:52] all right
[1:12:54] I want to be one with the Lord in
[1:12:57] Brokenness before him every day
[1:13:00] I don't know more than any other pastors
[1:13:02] I'm not a very deep preacher I mean that
[1:13:05] sincerely I
[1:13:07] I just have my
[1:13:08] contribution God gave me to give to the
[1:13:10] bride but I don't want to live on a
[1:13:13] pride that I'm okay I want his word to
[1:13:15] be established in my life I want this
[1:13:18] seed to be planted and bring forth his
[1:13:20] crop his Christ manifesting in my life
[1:13:23] that's what I that's what I want
[1:13:26] no longer concerned about who
[1:13:29] but the position is or
[1:13:31] how I measure with
[1:13:35] the whole message
[1:13:37] the movement
[1:13:40] I just want to be close to him
[1:13:42] I want to love his people I want to love
[1:13:44] him more
[1:13:48] when they picked up Stones against Jesus
[1:13:53] Jesus said I've done these works they
[1:13:56] said it's not for a good work that we
[1:13:57] Stone thee we like when you do good
[1:14:00] things it's not for a good work you do
[1:14:03] but being a man you call yourself God I
[1:14:06] am my father one that's why we pick up
[1:14:08] Stones against you and the devil's
[1:14:10] always the same way he'll be upset at me
[1:14:13] not because I was a preacher or preached
[1:14:16] in conventions
[1:14:20] the devil will be mad when I come in
[1:14:22] complete Oneness with Jesus Christ and
[1:14:24] manifest you that's what makes him angry
[1:14:29] so today I ask you if your heart is
[1:14:32] there repent before him and say Lord
[1:14:35] forgive me of my sins
[1:14:37] forgive me of my pride
[1:14:41] forgive me for knowing it all and
[1:14:43] thinking I know more than everybody Lord
[1:14:46] I don't know nothing I need to be
[1:14:48] re-taught I need a new Foundation
[1:14:51] I want to be that wise part of that
[1:14:54] group it has oil in my lamp
[1:14:58] oh God would you receive this people
