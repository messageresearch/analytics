[30:06] They're still breathing. They made it.
[30:07] They're still here. Still believing. I
[30:10] say, "Praise God."
[30:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:14] It's a blessing, girls. Thank you.
[30:16] Through it all. A little bit higher.
[30:19] Through it [singing] all.
[30:23] Through it all, [singing]
[30:27] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[30:31] I've learned to trust in God. [singing]
[30:35] Oh, through it all. [music]
[30:40] Through [singing] it all.
[30:44] I've learned [music]
[30:46] to [singing] depend upon you. So, let's
[30:49] stand together. Oh,
[30:52] through it [singing] all. [music]
[30:57] Through it all,
[31:00] I've learned to trust in you. [music]
[31:04] Hallelujah.
[31:06] Trust in God
[31:09] through it all. [music]
[31:12] Oh, through it all
[31:15] [music]
[31:16] I've learned to depend upon. [music]
[31:21] I thank God for the mountain. I thank
[31:25] God for the [music] mountain.
[31:28] And I thank God for the valleys.
[31:33] I thank [music] him for the storms he's
[31:37] brought me through. Oh, hallelujah.
[31:39] Hallelujah.
[31:41] For if I never had a problem, I'd never
[31:46] [music] know that God could solve it.
[31:49] I'd never know what faith in God could
[31:53] do. [music] That's the reason I say
[31:57] through it all.
[32:01] [music] Through it all, [singing]
[32:04] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[32:08] I've learned to trust in God.
[32:12] [music] Through it all,
[32:17] through it all,
[32:20] I've learned to depend
[32:22] [music and singing]
[32:24] upon his word.
[32:28] Hallelujah. Amen. Genesis chapter 18.
[32:35] And we look forward to hearing brother
[32:36] Eli Ortiz this Wednesday night. So we
[32:39] look forward to hearing him in the
[32:40] service. It's our my wife and I's
[32:42] anniversary. We will be here. But I
[32:44] thought I'd take that off and let
[32:45] brother Eli speak for us. So we're
[32:47] looking forward to that. Genesis 18 and
[32:49] verse one. And the Lord appeared unto
[32:52] him in the plains of Mamry. And he sat
[32:55] in the tent door in the heat of the day.
[32:58] And he lift up his eyes and looked and
[33:00] lo, three men stood by him. And when he
[33:03] saw them, he ran to meet them from the
[33:05] tent door, and bowed himself toward the
[33:07] ground, and said, "My Lord, if now I
[33:10] have found favor in thy sight, pass not
[33:13] away, I pray thee, from thy servant." So
[33:17] Abraham is seeing that this is not just
[33:20] ordinary men. It's not just an ordinary
[33:23] visitation. His eyes have already been
[33:25] open to who's who these men are and
[33:28] these angels are to visit him. So he has
[33:30] a revelation. He sees it and this is his
[33:32] reaction. He calls him Lord. Calls one
[33:35] of them Lord. If now I have found favor
[33:37] in thy sight passed on away I pray thee
[33:39] from thy servant. Let a little water I
[33:42] pray you be fetched and watch and wash
[33:45] your feet and rest yourselves under the
[33:47] tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread
[33:50] and comfort ye your hearts. After that
[33:53] you pass on. For therefore are ye come
[33:56] to your servant. And they said, "So do
[33:59] as thou had said." And Abraham hastened
[34:02] into the tent unto Sarah, and said,
[34:05] "Make ready quickly three measures of
[34:08] fine meal. Knead it, and make cakes upon
[34:11] the earth." Isn't this like a a husband
[34:14] would do to his wife,
[34:17] uh, invites them all in and says, "We're
[34:20] going to make you a meal here." And then
[34:22] he goes back and says, "We got company.
[34:25] Make a meal right away." I told him. And
[34:27] he said, "We would make the meal." And
[34:29] his wife's probably going, "What you
[34:30] mean we
[34:33] just springs in on them. We're having
[34:34] people over. They're here already. I
[34:36] need you to make a meal." And Abraham
[34:39] ran into the herd and fetched the calf
[34:41] tender and good, and gave it unto a
[34:43] young man, and he hasted to dress it.
[34:45] And he took butter and milk, and the
[34:47] calf which he had dressed, and set it
[34:48] before them, and he stood by them under
[34:50] the tree, and they did it did eat. And
[34:53] they said unto him, "Where is Sarah, thy
[34:55] wife?" And he said, "Behold, in the
[34:57] tent," and he said, "I will certainly
[35:00] return unto thee according to the time
[35:02] of life." And lo, Sarah thy wife shall
[35:05] have a son, and Sarah heard it in the
[35:08] tent door which was behind him. Now
[35:10] Abraham and Sarah were old and well
[35:12] strucken in age, and it ceased to be
[35:14] with Sarah after the manner of women.
[35:16] Therefore Sarah laughed within herself,
[35:19] saying, After I am waxed old, shall I
[35:22] have pleasure with my lord, being old
[35:24] also? And the Lord said unto Abraham,
[35:26] "Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying,
[35:29] Shall I of surely bear a child which am
[35:31] old?" And before you're seated, I just
[35:33] make a comment here. A couple things
[35:35] that stick out to me in this. And that
[35:37] is Sarah has not seen uh what she needs
[35:42] to see yet. Abraham sees it all. And
[35:44] that's why he's reacting that this is
[35:46] the Lord visiting us. He's coming to
[35:48] confirm his promise from years ago.
[35:51] Sarah knew the promises as well, but
[35:54] she's not where Abraham is yet
[35:57] &gt;&gt; in her believing obviously. And
[35:58] actually, I'll say this, she's become a
[36:00] bit sarcastic about the promise.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; And this is what happens when you go for
[36:05] many years and you're slow to believe.
[36:07] You can actually become a bit bitter.
[36:10] You become sarcastic. And she's laughing
[36:12] in her heart.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; And uh Abraham sees something, but Sarah
[36:18] don't see it
[36:19] &gt;&gt; yet. That's right.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; How many know she sees it later?
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Well, obviously she did.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; But she don't see it right here. Even
[36:27] while the Lord's visiting,
[36:29] &gt;&gt; she don't see what And she's sarcastic.
[36:31] She's bitter. She's probably went
[36:33] through depression. She heard the
[36:34] promise because she's probably went
[36:36] through being depressed about the
[36:37] promise not coming after all these
[36:39] years. And now she can't even believe
[36:41] when the Lord is present, when he's
[36:43] confirming it. It's just where she's at.
[36:46] Abraham sees it. She don't. And the Lord
[36:49] said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah
[36:51] laugh, saying, Shall I have assurityity
[36:52] bear of a child which I'm old, is
[36:55] anything too hard for the Lord? At the
[36:57] time appointed, I will return unto thee
[37:00] according to the time of life, and Sarah
[37:02] shall have a son, not Hagar, not anyone
[37:05] else. Sarah, it will be you.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Then Sarah denied, saying, I laugh not
[37:13] [snorts]
[37:16] &gt;&gt; to the Lord.
[37:19] Most of us would write her off,
[37:22] &gt;&gt; but brother Bram says God couldn't.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; She was a part of the promise.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad when God can see beyond
[37:32] how we're acting sometimes?
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Cuz she's slow to believe this, but
[37:37] she's a part of the promise nonetheless.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Sarah denied said, "I laugh not." So
[37:41] here she is lying to the Lord for she
[37:43] was afraid and he said nay but thou did
[37:47] laugh and so you know the rest of the
[37:49] story there but just wanted to go over
[37:50] and confirm um if that's the end of the
[37:54] story it doesn't look good for Sarah but
[37:57] she actually made it over here into the
[38:00] hall of fame or the hall of faith Sarah
[38:03] made it into the hall of faith her name
[38:05] is mentioned in Hebrews 11 and verse 11
[38:10] through faith Also Sarah herself
[38:13] received strength
[38:15] &gt;&gt; to conceive seed. She made it to the
[38:18] hall of faith
[38:21] &gt;&gt; through faith. Sarah herself received
[38:23] strength to conceive seed and was
[38:26] delivered of a child when she was past
[38:28] age because she judged him faithful who
[38:34] had promised.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Guess what? She didn't have it back
[38:37] there,
[38:38] &gt;&gt; but she got it.
[38:41] She got it
[38:42] &gt;&gt; and she received strength to make the
[38:45] promise happen. How many would say
[38:47] that's what we need? We need his
[38:49] strength cuz she didn't have it but she
[38:52] received strength to bring forth the
[38:54] promise.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, bless your word
[38:57] today as we humbly submit to it, Lord,
[38:59] and submit our gift to you. May you
[39:02] bless every life that's here. You you
[39:04] you have every one of them. no matter
[39:06] what age they are, no matter where
[39:08] they're at, you have every one of them
[39:10] in mind today. And you you are watching
[39:12] over their lives so you know just what
[39:16] to speak to them, Father. And we pray
[39:18] that they'll see it in Jesus name. Amen.
[39:21] God bless you. You may be seated.
[39:26] I want to speak this morning a little
[39:28] bit on grace for Sarah until she sees.
[39:31] Grace for Sarah until she sees. Or maybe
[39:36] grace for all the Sarah. Because there's
[39:39] more Sarah than just the Sarah of the
[39:41] Bible.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Grace for Sarah until she sees. Um
[39:45] there's a scripture I'll add in in 2
[39:47] Corinthians 4:18, if they want to pull
[39:49] it up there. 2 Corinthians 4:18 says,
[39:52] "While we look not at the things which
[39:54] are seen, but at the things which are
[39:58] not seen, for the things 2 Corinthians
[40:01] 4:18, for the things which are seen are
[40:05] temporal, but the things which are not
[40:08] seen are eternal." Telling believers
[40:10] that we are not to look towards the
[40:13] things that are seen, but the things
[40:15] that are not seen. We're actually to
[40:17] look at things unseen. Now, that's very
[40:19] strange to the world. If you don't
[40:21] understand faith, you're not you're not
[40:23] going to understand this. But the Lord
[40:25] actually as Christians, we are not to
[40:27] look at what we see with these eyes.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Faith looks at what we can't see.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; And that's faith. And if if anyone knows
[40:36] here, if you didn't know, I'll tell you.
[40:38] The Christian life of serving the Lord
[40:40] is a life of faith. And it's a life of
[40:43] looking to the unseen.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Not necessarily blind faith. It's not
[40:48] necessarily that, but you actually see
[40:51] something in faith, but it's not with
[40:53] these eyes.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; You actually see something in faith, but
[40:59] it's not with these eyes. It's faith is
[41:02] the evidence of things not seen. So,
[41:05] it's it's things that you can't see with
[41:07] these eyes, but yet it's an evidence of
[41:09] things not seen. It's something it's a
[41:12] substance. You actually see it, but you
[41:14] don't see it with these eyes. And we are
[41:16] called to live a life that's deeper than
[41:18] the world that tends to only view things
[41:21] with these eyes. They live by their
[41:24] emotions. They live by what their eyes
[41:26] see. Uh if you I what's the saying that
[41:29] uh if you can we we say if you believe
[41:32] it that you can see it. But you see now
[41:34] they I have to see it before I believe
[41:36] it. That's opposite of Christianity. I'm
[41:39] not going to believe it until I see it
[41:41] with these eyes. But you see, God asks
[41:43] us to have faith because then we see it
[41:45] by faith. And these eyes don't declare
[41:48] it.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; There's nothing to declare that this is
[41:51] the truth. But yet in the inside, we're
[41:53] saying, "But I see it. I see it by
[41:55] revelation. God has showed me." And this
[41:57] is what Abraham's seen. He's seen that
[41:59] the promise was as good as in the bag.
[42:01] And the Lord's coming to confirm it.
[42:03] Because he see it, seen it. He invited
[42:06] the Lord in his tent, in his home, and
[42:08] begin to serve him because why? He's
[42:10] seen it. Amen.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; That's our father Abraham. He's the
[42:14] first one who initiated this walk of
[42:16] faith. Can you say amen?
[42:18] &gt;&gt; That's why we call him the father of
[42:20] faith. Abraham began this walk of faith.
[42:23] And we are children of Abraham when we
[42:25] believe by faith. I'm laying some
[42:27] foundational things here. So that means
[42:30] that we look to the unseen. We don't
[42:33] base our life on what the five senses
[42:35] declare.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; We don't base our life on what the 10
[42:38] senses declare. There's actually 10.
[42:40] There's five outward of see, taste,
[42:42] feel, smell, and hear. Then there's
[42:44] inward of memory, imagination,
[42:46] conscious, affections, and reasoning. So
[42:48] we have 10 senses there of our emotions
[42:51] and our outward uh uh senses. And we
[42:54] don't base our life scripturally. And as
[42:57] a Christian, we don't base our life on
[43:00] what our senses declare.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; Often what our senses declare, it would
[43:05] be opposite of what God has already
[43:07] declared. SO UNLESS WE GET PAST what we
[43:11] see with these eyes, we'll never never
[43:13] understand the Lord, understand his
[43:16] kingdom, understand healing, understand
[43:18] why he wants us to serve him, understand
[43:21] why he asks us to wear certain things.
[43:24] We'll never understand it until we see
[43:27] something beyond this world, beyond
[43:30] these eyes, beyond what OUR CONSCIENCE.
[43:33] IT'S BEYOND ALL OF THAT. IT'S SOMETHING
[43:35] that we see spiritual and God has to
[43:39] show us. And God has to show the person
[43:41] sitting next to you, too. And guess
[43:43] what? We've got to have grace until the
[43:46] person sitting next to you can see it.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; But when they see it, it's over.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Everything opens up. Can you say amen?
[43:57] So, we love them and we have grace for
[43:59] the Sarah's because the scripture should
[44:01] have read that Abraham caught it and
[44:04] Sarah caught it, but Sarah didn't catch
[44:06] it right away. Abraham caught it early
[44:08] on. Sarah didn't catch it early on.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; And Jesus, I REMEMBER HIM SAYING, "OH,
[44:13] FOOLS." To the men on the road to Emmas,
[44:15] oh fools and slow of heart to believe.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; I know none of you are in that category
[44:22] this morning. I wouldn't put you there,
[44:24] but there are people that are very slow
[44:27] to get it.
[44:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, what the senses
[44:32] show can be a whole different world than
[44:34] what God sees and what and and what God
[44:37] has already seen and what God has
[44:40] already spoken, what he's seen ahead of
[44:42] time. He speaks that through prophets.
[44:45] And so, but then what our senses show
[44:47] can be a completely different world than
[44:49] what God has already seen. and what God
[44:52] has already spoken. I think a good
[44:54] example is Jonah. And he was the one
[44:58] Jonah was the one who called all the
[45:00] things he seen on the outside. He
[45:02] actually is the one who called them
[45:04] lying vanities. Did you know Jonah is
[45:07] the one that and boy, he had some
[45:09] outward things to look at that he would
[45:10] never be delivered. He was in the in the
[45:13] belly of a fish and uh tied up in
[45:16] seaweed and at the bottom of the ocean,
[45:19] the Bible says, and he was all I mean,
[45:22] he was a mess. And he was in a terrible
[45:25] spot. And he was the one, if you if you
[45:29] guys want to pull it up, Jonah 2, he's
[45:32] the one who said, "Then Jonah prayed
[45:33] unto the Lord his God out of the fish's
[45:35] belly and said, I cried by reason of my
[45:37] affliction unto the Lord, and he heard
[45:39] me out of the belly of hell. Cried I,
[45:42] and thou heardest my voice. For thou
[45:44] hast cast me into the deep in the midst
[45:46] of the seas, and the floods compass me
[45:49] about, all my billows, and thy waves
[45:51] passed over me." Then I said, I am cast
[45:53] out of thy sight. Yet will I look again
[45:56] toward thy holy temple. The waters
[45:58] compass me about even to the soul. The
[46:00] depth closed me round about. The weeds
[46:03] were wrapped around my head. I went down
[46:05] to the bottoms of the mountains. The
[46:07] earth with the bars was about me
[46:10] forever. Yet hast thou brought my life
[46:12] from corruption. Oh Lord my God, when my
[46:15] soul fainted within me, I remembered the
[46:17] Lord and my prayer came unto thee into
[46:20] thy holy temple. They that observe lying
[46:22] vanities forsake their own mercy. He's
[46:25] the guy that called all of these outward
[46:27] things that he seen with these eyes, all
[46:30] the seaweed, all the condition he was
[46:32] in. He said, "This is just lying
[46:34] vanities." NOW, HOW COULD HE CALL ALL OF
[46:37] THAT LYING VANITIES? BECAUSE HE'S
[46:39] looking at something else BY FAITH. MY
[46:42] GOD IS ABLE TO DELIVER ME out of this
[46:45] fish.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; And he called it all lying vanities. In
[46:49] other words, I can't I'm not trusting
[46:51] any of this for my deliverance.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; But I will sacrifice unto thee with a
[46:56] voice of thanksgiving. I will pay that I
[46:57] vow salvation as to the Lord. And the
[47:00] Lord spake unto the fish. Now it's
[47:02] getting weird because God's speaking to
[47:04] the fish.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; I just caught that. You know, this is
[47:10] when we have to live a life of faith.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Because when God's speaking to a fish,
[47:16] &gt;&gt; the world goes, "What? Hello. You're
[47:20] going to accept that? You're going to
[47:21] believe that? Well, not by these eyes,
[47:23] but in the kingdom of God, God can speak
[47:26] to a fish. God can speak to a donkey.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; And if GOD CAN SPEAK TO A FISH AND GOD
[47:33] CAN SPEAK TO A DONKEY, HE CAN SPEAK TO
[47:36] YOU THIS MORNING.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; SO, when following THE LORD, THE FIVE
[47:43] SENSES can't be trusted and relied on.
[47:46] We have to pray to see the way God sees
[47:49] everything. Can I say that again? We
[47:51] have to pray, Lord, let me see the way
[47:54] you see things.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; We can't judge matters matters by the
[47:59] flesh and then act too quickly by the
[48:02] flesh. And we certainly can't view this
[48:05] message that God has sent us in the last
[48:06] days from a human standpoint. If we view
[48:10] it from a human standpoint, we won't see
[48:13] it right. We won't see the message
[48:15] right. if we view it from a human
[48:17] standpoint or through our senses. Most
[48:20] of the trouble within our groups, in our
[48:23] ranks, is not seeing the message right
[48:26] and not seeing God's people from God's
[48:28] viewpoint. I'm going to say that again.
[48:31] Most of our problems in our own ranks is
[48:33] because people are not seeing the
[48:35] message right.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; You're looking at it the wrong way.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; And you're looking at God's people the
[48:43] wrong way.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; You have to see God's people from his
[48:49] standpoint, from his viewpoint.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; And I remember a couple Sundays ago when
[48:54] brother Jeremy Shriner was here and and
[48:56] you know, uh, he helped us understand
[48:58] something there. And this is what it was
[49:01] is that if the ark is a type of the word
[49:04] and just because that you have the ark,
[49:06] the word, and it's with us does not mean
[49:09] that it's being handled right. I love
[49:10] that. I I got so much out of that
[49:13] because they shouting. They were
[49:14] rejoicing. The word's coming back and
[49:16] everybody's dancing. They're having a
[49:18] big emotional time and they should
[49:20] because the word was coming back, right?
[49:22] But it because it wasn't how they did it
[49:24] was not handled right. And so just
[49:26] because we have the word does not mean
[49:28] there's enough reverence and respect uh
[49:31] for what we have. Just because there's
[49:33] shouting and loud worship over the ark,
[49:36] the word has come back to us and it's
[49:37] with us. It doesn't mean that it's
[49:40] acceptable to God yet.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; GLORY. WE'VE GOT THE WORD. GLORY,
[49:44] BROTHER. AND NOBODY ELSE HAS IT EITHER.
[49:46] WE'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE IT. WHAT?
[49:50] &gt;&gt; But because they didn't do things God's
[49:53] way, Israel, an innocent law, life was
[49:56] lost.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Had the word, had the ark,
[50:01] &gt;&gt; and because they did not handle it
[50:03] properly, an innocent life was lost.
[50:06] When I was fellowshipping with some
[50:07] brothers, I said, "How many innocent
[50:10] lives have walked away from this message
[50:14] &gt;&gt; because of how the message was handled?
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen?"
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Israel did it.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE WORD. WE GOT THE ARK. PRAISE
[50:23] THE LORD. LET'S HAVE A BIG EMOTIONAL
[50:25] TIME. BUT AN INNOCENT LIFE of a man who
[50:27] touched that ark was not supposed to
[50:29] touch it. An innocent. And I believe
[50:31] INNOCENT LIVES GET LOST IN THE PROCESS.
[50:34] NOT BECAUSE OF GOD, NOT BECAUSE OF THE
[50:36] WORD, NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE
[50:38] MESSAGE, the greatest thing that's ever
[50:40] HIT PLANET EARTH, NOT BECAUSE OF ANY
[50:42] OTHER ELEMENT EXCEPT FOR OUR ATTITUDE
[50:44] AND SPIRIT IS NOT HANDLING THE MESSAGE,
[50:48] and we don't see the message right.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; So, I'm just going to uh uh uh say this.
[50:55] It's interesting to me that people view
[50:58] others outside because I just was
[51:00] mentioning to you that you know when
[51:02] when somebody says, "Yeah, we've got the
[51:04] ark. We've got the word. Nobody else has
[51:07] it. We're we're the in crowd. We are
[51:09] we've got it." And when that develops
[51:11] into a pride that we've got it, and we
[51:14] have an exclusive thing, it just turns
[51:17] into too too much pride. And it's
[51:20] interesting to me that people can view
[51:21] others outside of what what they believe
[51:24] very critical towards those people.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well,
[51:31] &gt;&gt; there's not a lot of amens this morning,
[51:32] but
[51:33] &gt;&gt; let me just take a drink and freshen up
[51:35] here and we'll see if everything turns
[51:38] around.
[51:41] It's interesting that pe people view
[51:44] others outside of what we believe. Very
[51:45] critical.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; And yet I don't see that in the
[51:50] prophet's attitude.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; In fact, there are many attitudes
[51:55] expressed of pride that I just don't see
[51:57] it in God's prophet.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because they're not looking
[52:02] at the message the way that he was
[52:04] looking at it.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; They're not after all THESE YEARS,
[52:07] THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THIS CORRECTLY.
[52:08] THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THIS, RIGHT?
[52:10] BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN COME OUT
[52:12] WITH AN EXCLUSIVE ATTITUDE, WITH AN
[52:14] ATTITUDE TO SOMEBODY WHO DISBELIEVES,
[52:16] YOU QUICKLY MARK THEM OFF. OH, THEY MUST
[52:19] BE SERPENT SEED. AND IF SOMEBODY would
[52:21] have did that with Sarah, it would have
[52:22] been a TERRIBLE THING. WE DON'T HAVE A
[52:24] RIGHT TO WRITE SOMEBODY OFF EVEN WHEN
[52:27] THEY COMPLETELY DISBELIEVE.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO TAKE THIS
[52:32] MESSAGE AND DO THAT. AND I DON'T FIND
[52:34] THAT ATTITUDE IN THE PROPHET. I DON'T
[52:36] REALLY FIND I DON'T FIND IT IN CHRIST.
[52:38] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? IT'S NOT THE MATTER.
[52:40] SO WHAT'S WRONG? IT'S NOT THE MESSAGE.
[52:42] IT'S IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE PROPHET GOD
[52:45] SENT. BUT IT'S A PROBLEM WITH HOW WE SEE
[52:48] THIS MESSAGE.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Can I get an amen?
[52:53] &gt;&gt; It's how we see it. That's why it's
[52:54] important we must see it right. And so
[52:57] uh we we we want to be able to look at
[53:00] we're not not seeing the message the way
[53:02] that he sees it. There's a song and I
[53:04] might quote the lyrics at the end here
[53:06] that came to my mind last night and the
[53:08] song says by the Macamis, "Things look
[53:11] different on the mountain from the
[53:13] shepherd's point of view."
[53:15] &gt;&gt; It's just moved me. It's just I'll I'll
[53:16] read it in a minute, but the shepherd
[53:18] will always look at his sheep different
[53:22] than the way that we look at them.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; The shepherd is looking from a different
[53:28] vantage point. Our
[53:30] God is looking was looking at Sarah from
[53:33] a different vantage point.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; And there was a measure of grace for
[53:37] Sarah. Can you say amen?
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Because she she she not only sassed she
[53:42] not ONLY SHOWED A SARCASM, SHE LAUGHED
[53:46] IN HER HEART, THEN SHE LIED THAT SHE
[53:48] LAUGHED. AND SO ANY OF US would have
[53:50] said that's PROBABLY EVIDENCE THAT SHE'S
[53:52] not going to believe. But aren't YOU
[53:53] GLAD THE GREAT SHEPHERD FROM HIS
[53:55] VIEWPOINT, HE'S LOOKING PAST THE WAY
[53:58] SARAH IS ACTING. HE'S LOOKING PAST THE
[54:00] REBELLION, HE'S LOOKING PAST YOUR
[54:03] UNBELIEF.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Things look different from the mountain,
[54:11] from the shepherd's point of view.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; So, just to bring this a another way for
[54:16] a couple minutes, uh I I go to Ephesians
[54:18] 6:12. I think I mentioned this Wednesday
[54:19] night how we have to look to the unseen.
[54:22] Even when we're fighting spiritual
[54:23] devils in life, we have to realize
[54:26] Ephesians 6:12, we wrestle not against
[54:29] flesh and blood, but against
[54:32] principalities, against powers, against
[54:34] the rulers of darkness of this world,
[54:36] against spiritual wickedness in high
[54:37] places. So when we talk about looking to
[54:40] the unseen, we as Christians not only
[54:42] need to look at his promise and catch it
[54:44] by revelation, but we also must realize
[54:47] THAT OUR BATTLE IS NOT WITH FLESH AND
[54:50] BLOOD.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; OUR BATTLE IS NOT THE EMPLOYEE OR the
[54:54] employer. Our battle is not with our
[54:56] brother and sister. Our battle is not
[54:58] really with our wife or our husband.
[54:59] Even though it looks like it sometimes
[55:02] because we do have disagreements. We do
[55:04] have mo I I don't call them battles or
[55:07] but moments of intense fellowship with
[55:09] your husband and wife. There are times
[55:11] when it's just uh tense. But we HAVE TO
[55:13] AS A CHRISTIAN, YOU CAN'T MAKE THE
[55:16] BATTLE flesh and blood.
[55:19] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THERE'S SOMETHING IN
[55:22] YOUR LIFE THAT'S FIGHTING YOU THAT'S NOT
[55:25] FLESH AND BLOOD. IT'S THE ENEMY IN
[55:27] ANOTHER dimension that's fighting
[55:29] against your oneness, that's fighting
[55:31] against your family, that hates HATES
[55:34] WHEN A SON OF GOD ESTABLISHES his home
[55:37] in the word of God and a daughter of God
[55:39] is doing that and loves THIS MESSAGE AND
[55:41] APPLIES THE TOKEN AND WE'RE GOING TO DO
[55:43] THIS BY THE GRACE OF GOD. SATAN HATES
[55:46] IT.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; And all the principalities, spiritual
[55:51] wickedness in high places, which to me
[55:53] is religious spirits as well. It all
[55:55] gathers around. But we think the problem
[55:58] was with your pro person that hurt you.
[56:01] We think the problem was with that
[56:02] pastor who hurt you years ago.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; And you need to grow to realize your
[56:07] battle is not with flesh and blood.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Your battle is, was, and will always be
[56:15] with the demonic forces that's against
[56:17] you.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; So we could say maybe it wasn't your
[56:21] brother as much as you hated him. Maybe
[56:24] it wasn't that sister as much as you
[56:26] still hold bitterness towards them.
[56:29] Maybe it wasn't. Maybe you didn't see
[56:32] what happened to you AS ALL THE TOXIC
[56:35] PEOPLE in your life. Maybe you didn't
[56:37] see it right.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Maybe it was the enemy making those
[56:48] people act in a certain way to test you.
[56:53] Paul's teaching here that if you make
[56:55] the battle with a person, you're not
[56:57] seeing it right. The [snorts] the the
[56:59] world's battle is with flesh and blood.
[57:01] That's why they'll sue one another. And
[57:02] that's why I'm going after that person
[57:04] and I'm going to do everything to get
[57:06] that person out of their job. And I'm
[57:08] because their battle is flesh and blood.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; That person's the problem. I'm going
[57:13] after them. I'm going to court with
[57:14] them. And there are certain cases that
[57:16] you have to use the law to do things. I
[57:18] understand that. But for the most part,
[57:21] remember it's not the person.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; True.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; It's the enemy.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; We cannot live once again this thought
[57:29] of looking to the unseen. We can't look
[57:31] at what's here today. EVEN AS A PASTOR,
[57:33] I can't look at just what's here. And
[57:35] physically, I have to be saying, "Lord,
[57:37] help me to get the word because I'm
[57:39] dealing not with just people here. I'm
[57:41] dealing with principalities and powers.
[57:43] I'm doing deal dealing with sometimes
[57:45] unbelieving spirits. I'm dealing with
[57:47] people that come from A LOT OF STUFF. I
[57:49] mean, a lot of stuff, abuse and abusive
[57:52] situations in churches and physical
[57:54] abuse. I'm dealing with a lot of things.
[57:56] And you know what that does? It makes a
[57:58] person's heart locked up that they don't
[58:00] trust and they hold back. They love the
[58:02] Lord. They want to come to church, but
[58:04] they can have their heart locked up for
[58:05] many years. And so, do I look down on
[58:08] that person? No. I look at what the
[58:09] devil has done TO HAVE A STRONGHOLD in
[58:12] their life. I need the power of this
[58:15] WORD TO BREAK THROUGH THAT thing so the
[58:17] person can be free. So when I preach, it
[58:20] has nothing to do with personality and
[58:22] who's here and how well dressed you are.
[58:24] I appreciate you dressing well and I try
[58:27] to wear a suit to look nice, but this
[58:29] has nothing to do with flesh and blood.
[58:31] We're fighting an enemy in this land.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; And we need something better than just
[58:38] our personalities and our clothes to
[58:39] fight demons. We need a faith in God's
[58:42] word. Young person, you're going to need
[58:45] MORE IN THIS LIFE than just a strong
[58:47] personality to make it through. There
[58:49] are demons against your life. And you
[58:51] need the FAITH IN GOD'S WORD TO stand
[58:54] against the ws of the enemy, to be a
[58:56] daughter of God, to be a son of God, and
[58:58] stand with your armor on.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So now people that look
[59:05] at it with just people who have hurt me.
[59:07] I don't trust people. They become
[59:09] bitter. they become hateful. But that's
[59:12] not the full picture. It's only the
[59:13] surface of what we see. We can make a
[59:16] battle with people and we can also
[59:18] conclude about people. We bring
[59:19] conclusions about people. You know what
[59:21] else we do based on our past hurts? We
[59:24] conclude about the new people in our
[59:26] life and we associate them and profile
[59:28] them with the last person that hurt me.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, they're way too similar to the last
[59:34] guy. So, you don't get a chance. They
[59:36] don't ever get a chance. And you don't
[59:38] get a chance. I know you're the new
[59:39] pastor in my life, but listen, uh,
[59:42] you're starting to sound like that other
[59:43] pastor. I would say, "Give me a break.
[59:45] You know, I'm the new kid on the block
[59:47] here. Give me a chance." But people
[59:49] because of their hurt and pain by
[59:51] association, they'll put you in that
[59:53] same thing. That's
[59:54] &gt;&gt; right.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; You see, and you have to be careful. You
[59:56] don't profile, you don't put somebody in
[59:58] the and make conclusions about somebody
[1:00:02] that you don't really have a right to
[1:00:04] make. And it's not fair because you'll
[1:00:06] have a lack of grace of God for them.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; But when we grow, WE LOOK PAST WHAT is
[1:00:12] being said and done outwardly.
[1:00:15] How many want to grow past what you see
[1:00:17] outwardly, what's being said outwardly,
[1:00:20] what's being done outwardly. You want to
[1:00:22] have that calm spirit that if this
[1:00:24] person's spitting in your face like they
[1:00:26] did Jesus, you got that calm spirit to
[1:00:28] say, "Now I know, isn't this a person
[1:00:30] that's crying for help here? They're
[1:00:32] spitting and my flesh says I'm going to
[1:00:34] spit back or I'm going to do something
[1:00:36] even worse than spitting. But somewhere
[1:00:38] WE GOT TO LOOK PAST WHAT WE SEE THEY'RE
[1:00:41] DOING
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; and see past what's causing it.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; And know there's a demonic realm that
[1:00:49] hates us using anything to discourage
[1:00:51] us. You know with people they can't
[1:00:53] stand people. They can't stand being
[1:00:55] around people. I just wanted to say as a
[1:00:58] pastor, sometimes we have people that
[1:01:00] come through the years. I've had people
[1:01:01] come and say, "I just want to come to
[1:01:03] church and I want I I like the message
[1:01:06] and I like uh your sometimes they say
[1:01:08] they like your preaching sometimes and I
[1:01:11] just want to come and I I I just but I
[1:01:14] don't like people. I don't want to be
[1:01:15] around people." And so depending on how
[1:01:18] I feel hurt, how hurt they are, I
[1:01:21] understand where they're coming from.
[1:01:22] But God's going to have to open their
[1:01:24] eyes because you you can't you can't
[1:01:28] disassociate completely,
[1:01:30] especially with the people of God,
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; And say, you know, I I I just want a
[1:01:37] portion of this because what you're
[1:01:39] doing is you're playing it safe. I've
[1:01:40] been hurt too much. And what you're
[1:01:42] doing is lumping the rest of us in with
[1:01:43] the past people in your life or your
[1:01:45] past church. I don't think it's fair.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to say a little rebuke
[1:01:49] from the pastor here. Put your seatelt
[1:01:50] on. You can't take one Sunday in the
[1:01:53] year to stay over and have fellowship
[1:01:56] and get to know the people you go to
[1:01:58] church with.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Not one Sunday a year.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; You can't have fellowship. You can't you
[1:02:09] live your life in your own island
[1:02:10] because you think it's safe. Well, it's
[1:02:13] not really safe because there's one
[1:02:15] place that our Lord is
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; and he's not just in this building. The
[1:02:20] revelation said is he is in his body.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; So how can you say YOU WANT TO BE CLOSE
[1:02:29] to him and not be close to his body?
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; All right, that's it. The rebuke's over.
[1:02:35] On to other things. You think about that
[1:02:38] and you pray about that because there's
[1:02:41] something wrong with your revelation.
[1:02:42] Say, "I don't need anybody. I just need
[1:02:44] the preaching, but I don't need anybody
[1:02:46] else." I would really examine that and
[1:02:48] pray about it. Praise the Lord. So you
[1:02:50] let me move along here because we got a
[1:02:52] lot of hay on our fork. So Satan brings
[1:02:54] tensions and he does all this stuff and
[1:02:56] contentious with your spouse or your
[1:02:58] family, your kids and brothers and
[1:03:00] sisters and pastors and employees, even
[1:03:03] close family members and there's tension
[1:03:04] sometimes. But we must remember our
[1:03:06] battle is not with flesh and blood.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; There's a bigger picture that we have to
[1:03:12] see to the unseen. And if we conclude
[1:03:14] it's them and we are only battling them,
[1:03:17] then we are not growing to look to the
[1:03:20] unseen. As I said Wednesday night,
[1:03:22] forces in the other dimension, they're
[1:03:24] not I don't believe they're out there
[1:03:26] just just yelling at us to say, "I'm
[1:03:28] going to GET YOU. YOU'RE NOT A
[1:03:29] BELIEVER." NO, I DON'T THINK THEY'RE OUT
[1:03:31] THERE JUST YELLING. I THINK they're
[1:03:33] right here next to our ears whispering
[1:03:36] things in our ears constantly. THE
[1:03:38] DEMONIC REALM IS JUST IN THE OTHER
[1:03:40] DIMENSION AND IT'S RIGHT HERE FULL OF
[1:03:43] PRINCIPALITIES AND POWERS and spiritual
[1:03:45] wickedness in high places. That's why
[1:03:47] even in a service like that, your soul
[1:03:49] may say, "He's telling me the truth."
[1:03:51] But you have so much past and so much of
[1:03:53] those demons speaking that it's going to
[1:03:54] it's going to make you lack have a lack
[1:03:56] of trust to give your full heart to God
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; because you haven't learned that that
[1:04:02] those voices there, they got to be dealt
[1:04:04] with
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; by faith. Can you say amen?
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; So, we have it right next to us in high
[1:04:10] places and powerful prayer and faith in
[1:04:13] God. How many believe we have power to
[1:04:14] cast out devils
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; with love and in the name of the Lord?
[1:04:19] We have power to cast out devils.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you take a person, they don't
[1:04:23] see it. That's why we have to have
[1:04:25] grace. They don't see it yet.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; They don't believe yet because they
[1:04:28] don't see it yet.
[1:04:30] You take a person who feeds on trash
[1:04:33] privately or openly on the internet,
[1:04:36] just trash and vile things. Maybe they
[1:04:39] still even come to church. What's wrong?
[1:04:41] They need to really meet God. Why?
[1:04:44] Because they don't see the spirits
[1:04:46] behind all that. Right?
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; They see it as a naked woman or they see
[1:04:50] it as a a jokes, bad, dirty jokes, and
[1:04:54] they see it that makes you laugh, but
[1:04:56] they have no vision of the demonic
[1:04:59] spirit that's there. They tell me
[1:05:02] there's a place Brother Bram says, "If
[1:05:04] God could only show that man what that
[1:05:06] spirit looks like be behind that
[1:05:08] immodestly dressed woman. If God can
[1:05:11] only show you the spirit that's just
[1:05:13] right there behind her." And you'll see
[1:05:15] this in in uh you'll see this in
[1:05:18] commercials now where they have like a
[1:05:20] person under depression. And brother
[1:05:24] Bram described that when he's seated in
[1:05:26] the other dimension, it was like a cloud
[1:05:28] hanging over them of depression. Kept
[1:05:30] them down. And and let me just say
[1:05:32] something about this winter. Some of us
[1:05:34] older people, when winter sets in,
[1:05:36] depression can set in.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; So I want to encourage all of us today.
[1:05:40] God is still God.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; His presence is still available in the
[1:05:44] winter.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He still loves you. You
[1:05:49] still have a place in his kingdom. We
[1:05:51] need to refresh ourselves. Can you say
[1:05:53] amen? Cuz winter can get depressing.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; What was I? Where was I going with? Oh,
[1:05:58] the cloud. And so you're seeing this
[1:06:00] person that's depressed in this
[1:06:01] commercial walking around trying to
[1:06:04] enjoy their children in the backyard and
[1:06:06] everywhere they go is this cloud that's
[1:06:09] following them of depression. They're
[1:06:10] selling depression medicine and and and
[1:06:12] and that's fine if it helps. But you see
[1:06:15] now, isn't it amazing that back in the
[1:06:17] 1950s when Brother Brand seen in the
[1:06:19] other mention, he said, "I see you got
[1:06:21] that oppression over you. It's like a
[1:06:23] cloud following you."
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; So, they're able to tap into of all the
[1:06:28] symbolism they put a cloud
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; catching on to what's happening in the
[1:06:33] other dimension. But the prophet said,
[1:06:35] "If if man, if God could ever open your
[1:06:39] eyes and you see the demonic spirit
[1:06:42] behind that woman that's dressed and
[1:06:44] modest, you'd never look at her again."
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; I believe we're under the worst demonic
[1:06:55] pressure ever. And it's not out there
[1:06:57] somewhere. I believe it's close to us.
[1:06:59] Can you say amen?
[1:07:01] And we can be blinded by sometimes what
[1:07:05] a person has in their unbelief and what
[1:07:07] they're going through and where their
[1:07:09] heart is. We have to be careful how
[1:07:11] quickly we judge cuz you don't know
[1:07:13] really know where that person's heart
[1:07:16] is.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say we can quickly put someone
[1:07:19] under? So,
[1:07:22] uh, let me just settle down here, give
[1:07:24] an example. So, I have in the big at at
[1:07:27] the front of my driveway, I have a
[1:07:29] couple real big lions for decoration for
[1:07:32] landscape.
[1:07:35] Stevie, you stay right there. I got your
[1:07:36] number, buddy.
[1:07:38] So, a few weeks ago, mysteriously, and
[1:07:41] they're pointed straight, you know,
[1:07:43] that's where they're supposed to point.
[1:07:44] I come I woke up in the morning. I drove
[1:07:46] out my driveway and the lions were
[1:07:49] turned backwards coming back the other
[1:07:51] way.
[1:07:52] So I said, "Who did that? Who in the
[1:07:55] world would have the audacity [laughter]
[1:07:59] to change my lions
[1:08:02] and make them all backwards?" It's such
[1:08:04] a desecration of the the holy place of
[1:08:08] trying to make it with a symbolism of
[1:08:11] the line of tribe of Judah. somebody
[1:08:13] with such an irreverent
[1:08:18] I you know
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; but I I found out who it who it was
[1:08:23] because they confessed and I won't tell
[1:08:27] who it is but the initials are Stevie
[1:08:29] Lefontaine
[1:08:33] and and he's laughing about it still to
[1:08:35] today he's still laughing about it but
[1:08:37] you see now I want to use this example
[1:08:39] because what happened from that was you
[1:08:41] know I got on him about it. It was a
[1:08:43] good laugh, all that. And so I had my
[1:08:45] son-in-law move them back into the right
[1:08:47] place cuz I can't move them. They're too
[1:08:49] heavy. So he moved them back and I was
[1:08:50] all happy and everything and that was
[1:08:52] over. And so you know then just about a
[1:08:55] week later then they were turned again
[1:08:59] this way.
[1:09:01] So you know who my first phone call was
[1:09:04] and he uh denied it up and down. I don't
[1:09:08] know who that was. [crying]
[1:09:11] Uncle Paul, but that was not me. I said,
[1:09:13] "Yeah, right. Okay, sure." You know, and
[1:09:16] so now under my subject today, if if I
[1:09:20] was to really go with this, I would not
[1:09:22] only label Stevie a landscape vandalizer
[1:09:27] and put that title on him. I'm still
[1:09:31] thinking about keeping it on him for a
[1:09:32] while. A landscape vandalizer.
[1:09:35] But then, and that's it. You, you know,
[1:09:38] that's the category I put you in. You
[1:09:40] can try all you want to, but it's going
[1:09:42] to be a while. That's what I put you in
[1:09:43] that category because of what you did.
[1:09:45] So now he's made a mistake and he had
[1:09:48] thankfully he did confess that. But you
[1:09:49] see now when it happened again,
[1:09:52] my tendency as a human being to say,
[1:09:54] well there's nobody else in this world
[1:09:56] that would be that bad of a landscape
[1:09:58] vandalizer in my church or any nobody
[1:10:01] else is that irreverent. It has to be
[1:10:04] Stevie again. And he has denied. So I
[1:10:06] have a choice to make. I either believe
[1:10:08] what he's saying. And it's hard to
[1:10:10] believe because he's already made the
[1:10:11] mistake.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Do you see how human flesh can get in?
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to believe you, Stevie,
[1:10:20] because listen, you did it before.
[1:10:23] You're a landscape vandalizer. And once
[1:10:27] a LANDSCAPE VANDALIZER, ALWAYS A
[1:10:29] landscape vandalizer.
[1:10:32] And you just That's it. You're doomed
[1:10:34] for life. That's what you do for a
[1:10:36] living, Stevie. [laughter]
[1:10:40] But then I begin to realize that he's
[1:10:43] being real and he's saying, "But Uncle
[1:10:46] Paul, I just I didn't I don't know who
[1:10:49] did." He still thinks it's funny, but he
[1:10:50] didn't do it and somebody else did it.
[1:10:53] He's he's begun a pro. He's begun a
[1:10:57] whole campaign here.
[1:11:00] You see, you see what we do?
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; And I still don't know who it is, but I
[1:11:04] moved him back. Somebody moved him
[1:11:06] again. So, somebody is doing this. So,
[1:11:09] I'm going to have an altar call right
[1:11:10] now if anybody wants to come up and
[1:11:18] we must be careful how we judge someone.
[1:11:21] Amen.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Even if they have made a mistake,
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; we must be careful that we don't label
[1:11:30] them for life.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; That once they've done this, they're
[1:11:34] always going to be this.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; Now, I know there's patterns in people's
[1:11:39] lives, some pretty vile people. And
[1:11:42] thankfully we have the laws of the land
[1:11:44] that keep people in check because we've
[1:11:46] had a lot of government systems and
[1:11:47] judges that have let a lot of people off
[1:11:50] and they've went out and killed again
[1:11:51] and things like that. So I understand
[1:11:53] and a lot of that is because that God
[1:11:55] hasn't dealt with that person's heart.
[1:11:57] There has no place for a deliverance for
[1:11:59] them.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; But and I think the law should should
[1:12:02] should still make them accountable.
[1:12:04] Thankfully we have a president right now
[1:12:06] and different ones is trying to crack
[1:12:07] down a little bit so it's not as
[1:12:09] lawless. But remember the Bible says
[1:12:10] they will become lawless. That's the
[1:12:12] word
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; and that's what they were used in the
[1:12:14] media is that it's become a lawless
[1:12:16] nature and it's become a lawless world
[1:12:18] and it's a lawless uh the spirit of
[1:12:21] lawlessness is in our land. And so we
[1:12:23] try to correct it and say, "Hey, come
[1:12:25] back to the law." But we realize that.
[1:12:27] But we realize when we're in the kingdom
[1:12:29] of God, WHEN WE'VE GOT GOD'S POWER
[1:12:31] available to people to follow, we must
[1:12:34] be careful because that person, we can't
[1:12:37] be judging them and doing them because
[1:12:39] they may be a Sarah.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; They may be a Sarah. In fact, I'm
[1:12:46] convinced my my nephew Stevie, he's a
[1:12:49] Sarah or an Abraham.
[1:12:54] We must not judge somebody because they
[1:12:56] might be a Sarah and we and they can't
[1:12:58] see it yet.
[1:13:02] Maybe they're under a spirit for a
[1:13:03] while.
[1:13:05] There's still a lot of spirits that's
[1:13:07] driving people to do things. Maybe it's
[1:13:09] not them so much as the spirit driving
[1:13:11] them to do it. And so we must look
[1:13:14] beyond the person
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; and beyond what they look like,
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; beyond their mistakes. Amen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Is anybody on board with this this
[1:13:23] morning? I'm actually trying to train us
[1:13:25] and and teach us a bit of how we handle
[1:13:28] this message correctly and how we open
[1:13:30] the door and have a settleness to
[1:13:33] welcome people who don't look like us,
[1:13:36] who don't act like us initially,
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; and they come in, they're rebellious.
[1:13:41] They don't believe. We must have the
[1:13:43] spirit of Christ, not to compromise the
[1:13:46] truth, but the spirit of Christ to say,
[1:13:49] "Listen, I'm looking past all that
[1:13:51] because you may be a daughter of God.
[1:13:53] You may be a son of God." Can you say,
[1:13:55] "Amen." If we could have message
[1:13:57] churches THAT HOLD ON TO THAT GRACE, I
[1:13:59] believe they would grow because it's an
[1:14:01] ATMOSPHERE TO LET THAT PERSON SEE THE
[1:14:04] LORD. LET THAT PERSON GET IN THE
[1:14:06] PRESENCE OF GOD.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:14:10] WE FISH, BUT WE DON'T DO THE CLEANING.
[1:14:13] WE FISH,
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; BROTHER MICHAEL. WE CAN CATCH THE FISH.
[1:14:16] WE CATCH THE FISH, BUT GOD DOES the
[1:14:19] cleaning.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; And I like that part of it. I don't even
[1:14:24] like to clean fish with Michael or
[1:14:26] anybody else. I say, "Praise the Lord.
[1:14:28] We'll catch them and God will clean
[1:14:29] them."
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I want you to notice
[1:14:32] something here in the message that opens
[1:14:34] the seven seals. God in simplicity.
[1:14:37] That's the title of the message coming
[1:14:38] into the seven seals. And brother Brham
[1:14:40] says, "Today we have tried we have tried
[1:14:42] organization. We've tried denomination.
[1:14:45] We've tried education. We've tried
[1:14:47] scientific achievements and everything
[1:14:49] to try to bring man to a unity for
[1:14:51] fellowship. And it's failed. Every one
[1:14:52] of them. THERE'S ONE PLACE that man can
[1:14:55] meet AND FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD AND
[1:14:58] FELLOWSHIP WITH EACH OTHER. THAT'S under
[1:15:00] the cross.
[1:15:02] WHEN EACH MAN ACCEPTS the blood of Jesus
[1:15:06] Christ.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Hello. This is the opening of the seals.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; And guess what? I don't think that
[1:15:15] changed after the seals.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; There's one place. There's one place
[1:15:20] that's under the cross. When each man
[1:15:22] accepts the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:15:24] listen. He says, "I don't care in all of
[1:15:27] his peculiarity.
[1:15:30] He can still reach over and put his hand
[1:15:33] in the next man's hand and call him
[1:15:36] brother
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; when we meet at the cross where Jesus
[1:15:41] died.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; What's the effect of this? We're meeting
[1:15:48] in the same place. We're depending on
[1:15:49] the cross to transform our lives.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Not some symbolism that you got from a
[1:15:55] former church. No, no. I mean the power
[1:15:57] of the cross of what he did in your life
[1:16:00] to change you.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; And if you need it to change you, you
[1:16:04] can reach your hand across it and call a
[1:16:06] man a brother. Even in his peculiarity,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; that means some people will be peculiar.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; He might be talking about you.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; But see, if somebody's peculiar from the
[1:16:20] way we look, we back off.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; We can't shake our hands. We can't have
[1:16:25] fellowship with that man. Here he says
[1:16:28] in all of his peculiarity, he can still
[1:16:31] reach over and put his hand in the next
[1:16:32] man and call him brother when we meet at
[1:16:34] the cross where Jesus died. We are
[1:16:35] becoming a scientific age. And more we
[1:16:38] the and more we progue into science or
[1:16:41] probe into science I guess he meant
[1:16:43] further we get away from God. The more
[1:16:44] we probe into science the further we get
[1:16:46] from God.
[1:16:48] Uh I'd like to go back to that
[1:16:50] statement. Now everything we are living
[1:16:53] in a scientific age everything must be
[1:16:55] proven scientifically. You see when
[1:16:58] you're in that mode you're looking for
[1:17:00] the five senses and science to prove
[1:17:03] something.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; You see and when you're in that mode
[1:17:06] religiously you're looking for a certain
[1:17:08] proof
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; before you can shake hands and be
[1:17:11] brother
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; because you're in a realm that uh man
[1:17:16] wants to prove something. and we probe
[1:17:19] into science the further we get away
[1:17:22] from God. You never you're never able to
[1:17:24] scientifically prove God. And the whole
[1:17:26] Christian armor is absolutely
[1:17:27] supernatural. There's nothing natural.
[1:17:29] If you can prove God, then there's no
[1:17:30] need of there's no more need of faith.
[1:17:33] But he that cometh to God must believe
[1:17:35] that he is. It's by faith. The whole
[1:17:38] Christian armor is in faith. Brother FF
[1:17:40] Bosworth, one of my first managers,
[1:17:42] wrote a book called Looking to the
[1:17:43] Unseen. And many of you has read it. No
[1:17:45] doubt. It is a very fine book of looking
[1:17:47] at the unseen. Here's a statement. The
[1:17:49] Christian looks at things he does not
[1:17:52] see.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; So this is the simplicity of where the
[1:17:56] fellowship is, where we find fellowship
[1:17:58] under the cross. And I don't believe
[1:18:00] that changed after the seven seal was
[1:18:02] was preached. It's still under the shed
[1:18:04] blood of Jesus Christ. The bleeding
[1:18:07] word. The word brings the benefits of
[1:18:09] that blood. BUT THAT'S THE PLACE OF
[1:18:11] FELLOWSHIP. What he is saying is we can
[1:18:14] complicate this too much. We try to
[1:18:16] judge things by what is seen and by what
[1:18:18] is proven, but we are to look at what we
[1:18:21] don't see and never complicate what God
[1:18:24] HAS GIVEN US. DON'T COMPLICATE THE seven
[1:18:27] seals in making it into something that's
[1:18:30] other than the FELLOWSHIP BY HIS BLOOD.
[1:18:33] The revelation of the seal should never
[1:18:35] change that, only enhance it.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; It's interesting. Those that claim the
[1:18:41] word in the seals can write people off
[1:18:44] pretty quickly if they don't see it
[1:18:46] their way.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Unless they see this, we have no basis
[1:18:50] for fellowship.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; This is the bride's exclusive
[1:18:53] revelation. Really? How did you get that
[1:18:56] out of this fellowship under the blood?
[1:18:58] How did you conclude that? Why?
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; You're not looking at the message,
[1:19:03] right?
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; There's an unseen part that you don't
[1:19:06] see. You're blinded by pride. If he's a
[1:19:09] peculiar one,
[1:19:12] I can reach over and shake his hand and
[1:19:15] call him brother.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Paul, you're going to
[1:19:18] open the door to all kinds of stuff. I'm
[1:19:21] not afraid at all.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; I have men that doesn't have the same
[1:19:25] understanding that I do and been blessed
[1:19:27] with. And if they purely are looking at
[1:19:31] the blood of Jesus Christ, if they're
[1:19:32] purely believing in what they know, I
[1:19:34] can shake hands with them
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; and call them brother.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Is anybody listening to what I'm saying?
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; But what about this and what about that?
[1:19:46] What? And they, you know, they need to
[1:19:48] receive this and that's not up to you.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; That's not up to you.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; They need the same thing you needed and
[1:19:54] that's the shed blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:56] Amen. That's right.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Same thing that brought you in and
[1:19:59] changed you today the way you are, they
[1:20:01] need the same thing. Can I get an amen?
[1:20:03] They need the same simplicity. They need
[1:20:05] to find it. AND AND PEOPLE FIND IT ALL
[1:20:07] DIFFERENT WAYS.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; BUT AS LONG as they find it,
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; there are ones who we ride off way too
[1:20:14] quickly. Like we were speaking Wednesday
[1:20:15] night of Saul, how he changed the Paul.
[1:20:18] I was mentioning that uh sermon of
[1:20:20] brother John Andy's and how saw he was
[1:20:23] breathing out threatenings and against
[1:20:24] the church and and and and you know he
[1:20:27] was voted least likely to be a message
[1:20:29] believer. He was completely get against
[1:20:32] it and taking people to jail and and and
[1:20:35] and then come to the brothers in
[1:20:37] Jerusalem and say who's next to take
[1:20:39] Judas's place who's going to do it.
[1:20:41] Well, what about Saul? Saul? Are you
[1:20:43] kidding me? But you see now what
[1:20:45] happened is that even when when Saul,
[1:20:48] it's interesting when he got struck down
[1:20:50] at the horse and he seen that light and
[1:20:52] that light spoke and said this is Jesus
[1:20:54] which there's more manifestations in the
[1:20:56] Bible of Jesus showing himself in light
[1:21:01] than there is in his flesh body.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus is light. Amen.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; So he was represented in a pillar of
[1:21:10] fire in light throughout the Bible and
[1:21:12] he did it to Paul and he said, "Who are
[1:21:14] you? I'm Jesus who you're persecuting
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; in the pillar of fire."
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; And what happened? He was struck with
[1:21:20] blindness. And it wasn't until a
[1:21:22] brother, which is a no-name brother, was
[1:21:24] led of the Lord, "You need to go pray
[1:21:26] for this guy called Saul." And he
[1:21:28] questioned the Lord said, "But are you
[1:21:31] sure this is the one?
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Do you know? Have you read the free
[1:21:36] press? Have you read the press on this
[1:21:39] guy?
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; He's He's got an agenda. He's lashing
[1:21:43] out against this message. He's on social
[1:21:46] media everywhere. He's got an agenda to
[1:21:49] call this thing a sect, a cult. He's
[1:21:52] He's a mess. Are you sure this is the
[1:21:55] one?
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; Don't you ever underestimate who God can
[1:21:59] get a hold of.
[1:22:02] Hallelujah.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; But they're breathing out threatenings
[1:22:04] and all kinds of venom and bitterness
[1:22:06] coming out. Don't write him off
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; cuz Paul was pretty bad.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "Go talk to him. Go
[1:22:14] pray for him. God will open his eyes." I
[1:22:17] want you to catch that. He was blinded.
[1:22:19] But when a a no-name believer was called
[1:22:21] and he obeyed the Lord, went in there,
[1:22:24] prayed for him, his eyes were opened
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; because he just needed to see.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; He just needed to see.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Breathing out threatenings, breathing
[1:22:35] out all this hatred and bitterness. And
[1:22:38] somehow God's asking Ananas to look past
[1:22:42] all of that. That's what I'm preaching
[1:22:44] this morning to you. Ananas was asked to
[1:22:48] look past what he seen.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Past what he'd heard.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "You go pray for him because I
[1:22:58] have chosen him to take the message to
[1:23:02] the Gentiles." Are you sure you got the
[1:23:04] right guy? I've got the right guy. I
[1:23:06] chose him to do it.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; All he needs is his eyes opened
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; and it's over.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Did he do it? He did it.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Did Sarah make it in the Hall of Fame?
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; She made it.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Don't write off anybody.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; They might be a deacon in this church
[1:23:27] next year.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; I'll watch them for about a year, but
[1:23:32] let them get baptized with the Holy
[1:23:33] Ghost and filled.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; You're going to PUT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT
[1:23:39] HIM IN.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DONE? YEAH. BUT THE
[1:23:42] BLOOD of the lamb has washed it all
[1:23:43] away. Praise [applause] the Lord.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Faith looks beyond grace is always there
[1:23:53] to take the person to the purpose of God
[1:23:55] for them. We must see grace like that
[1:23:58] and not put restrictions on his grace.
[1:24:01] Martin Luther said this. Martin Luther
[1:24:04] said this grace of God if you guys have
[1:24:07] that quote. This grace of God, I love
[1:24:09] this, is a very great, strong, mighty,
[1:24:14] and active thing.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; It does not lie asleep in the soul.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Grace hears, leads, drives, draws,
[1:24:26] changes, works all in man, and lets
[1:24:30] itself be distinctly felt and
[1:24:33] experienced.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It is hidden,
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; but its works are evident.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; What's he saying? We don't limit the
[1:24:43] grace of God.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; It's a moving thing. His presence is a
[1:24:47] moving thing.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the quote that for a week or
[1:24:51] so since a brother gave it to me, I've
[1:24:52] been wanting to get to and I'm going to
[1:24:53] start wrapping up and closing after
[1:24:54] this. This blows me away how brother
[1:24:57] Bram says this. A wonderful quote to sum
[1:24:59] up what I'm saying that we must be able
[1:25:01] to see how God sees. Abraham seen the
[1:25:04] unseen. How many believe that Abraham
[1:25:06] seen the unseen? It was settled for him.
[1:25:09] But not Sarah. How do we treat the Sarah
[1:25:12] who are slow to live in this unseen
[1:25:15] realm?
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brham says they're in a
[1:25:18] service. He says, "Now listen, church, I
[1:25:21] want to drop, if I don't end up shouting
[1:25:23] or running the aisles after this one,
[1:25:26] I'll be surprised. Listen, church, I
[1:25:28] want to drop this in here because I
[1:25:29] believe the Holy Spirit told me to do
[1:25:31] it. You may be sitting here.
[1:25:35] You may be sitting there, which some of
[1:25:37] you are. I know you disagreeing with me
[1:25:40] right now.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; NOW, I CAN CALL YOUR name if you want me
[1:25:44] to.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Well, who who knows that.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Not brother Brandham. God knows your
[1:25:51] name.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; I could call your name. You're sitting
[1:25:54] there disagreeing with me. I can call
[1:25:55] your name if you want me to. So, I know
[1:25:57] that. But I also can see farther than
[1:26:00] that. Glory. Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:10] [applause]
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; I see that unbelief. I SEE I COULD CALL
[1:26:14] YOUR NAME. I SEE. BUT I ALSO CAN SEE
[1:26:16] FARTHER THAN YOUR UNBELIEF.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GLAD THIS MORNING THAT GOD
[1:26:21] CAN SEE FARTHER than our unbelief?
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GLAD HE SINNED FARTHER THAN
[1:26:26] YOUR REBELLION when you were in the
[1:26:28] world SITTING AT A BAR? ALL KINDS OF SIN
[1:26:30] AND DEBAUCHERY. AREN'T YOU GLAD? HE'S
[1:26:33] SEEN FARTHER THAN ALL OF THAT. SOMEBODY
[1:26:36] PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:26:38] HE SEEN FARTHER THAN THAT. [applause]
[1:26:40] HE SEEN FARTHER THAN YOUR HESITANCE AND
[1:26:42] YOUR REBELLION and your disbelief. HE
[1:26:45] SAID, "I CAN SEE FARTHER THAN THAT THAT
[1:26:47] YOU'RE going to believe it one of these
[1:26:50] days."
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE LOOKING IN THE FUTURE,
[1:26:53] LOOKING AT A STUBBORN INDIVIDUAL AND
[1:26:55] SAYING, "BUT I CAN SEE IN A VISION
[1:26:57] THEY'RE GOING TO BELIEVE IT WITH ALL
[1:26:58] THEIR HEART. THEY'RE GOING TO BE ALLIN.
[1:27:00] THEY'RE GOING TO SELL OUT LOCK, STOCK,
[1:27:02] AND BARREL.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; You think you know your life? God knows
[1:27:07] your life better than you do.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; YOU THINK YOU OWN YOURSELF. I'LL DO WHAT
[1:27:11] I WANT. I DO WHATEVER. NO. NO. God's got
[1:27:13] your number.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; And he's going to love you to himself
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; if you're his daughter and his son. So,
[1:27:19] I'm just going to put this in so you
[1:27:22] understand. So, I can give you a little
[1:27:24] spot of grace here. He's talking to the
[1:27:26] rebellious, unbelieving people.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to put a little spot of
[1:27:30] grace here. I wonder if we need to put a
[1:27:32] little spot of grace in people's lives.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to put a little spot of
[1:27:37] grace here. When ain't going to be too
[1:27:38] long, too. You're going to change your
[1:27:40] mind. Some of you, some of you won't.
[1:27:43] But remember, when Sarah first heard
[1:27:45] that man, which she's a type of the
[1:27:48] church, when she heard that, seen that
[1:27:51] sign take place to Abraham, she actually
[1:27:55] laughed about it in her heart,
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; and she disbelieved and doubted it ever
[1:28:01] being so. Is that right? At that time,
[1:28:05] God would have rubbed her name off.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; That right?
[1:28:12] But he couldn't. She's part of Abraham.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; They are one.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; And if you really not been excited, not
[1:28:23] worked up in emotion, not got some
[1:28:25] church creed.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; But really receive the Holy Ghost
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; and you're really part of Christ
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; and still a little skeptic in your mind.
[1:28:35] Now, can you imagine what he's saying
[1:28:36] here, friends? really receive the Holy
[1:28:38] Ghost and you're really part of Christ
[1:28:40] and still a little skeptic in your mind,
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; God will not shove you off from that
[1:28:49] because he can't. You're a part of
[1:28:51] Christ.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; He'll bring you to truth. [applause]
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; GLORY BE TO GOD.
[1:29:02] How many this morning want to see
[1:29:04] farther than what you can see with these
[1:29:06] eyes?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; If there's a sarah there, you want to
[1:29:09] see farther.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; You know, there's people in the Bible
[1:29:16] that caught the vision quickly.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; David, and he's ready to go after
[1:29:23] Goliath, but there's people in the Bible
[1:29:25] that got it real slow. I don't know if
[1:29:27] it was their complexes or their
[1:29:28] personality and they lean too much
[1:29:30] towards their shyness, but you got other
[1:29:33] people that they didn't jump right onto
[1:29:34] it. Gideon was real stubborn.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Gideon had complexes.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; And the angel saying, you know, you're a
[1:29:41] mighty man of valor and he's saying, you
[1:29:42] got the wrong guy.
[1:29:45] I don't know why people, but people were
[1:29:46] slow. Thomas, look at doubting Thomas.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; That's the label we've given him.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Doubting Thomas. If I could, I've got to
[1:29:56] see and put my hands in it.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Said Lord said, "All right, Thomas, come
[1:30:02] on over here. Stick your hand in here."
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; If you need that, that's fine. But
[1:30:06] blessed is he who's not seen
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; and yet'll believe. Give their heart to
[1:30:10] the Lord this morning. I'm ready to
[1:30:12] trust the Lord. I'm tired of my life. I
[1:30:15] want to trust him right now.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; He's finding me. I want to find him. I
[1:30:19] want to put that together. A lot of
[1:30:20] people in the Bible didn't catch it
[1:30:22] quickly, but I'll tell you when they
[1:30:24] caught it, no matter how far down the
[1:30:26] road it was, when they when their eyes
[1:30:27] were open and they seen it,
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; then they become the heart a part of the
[1:30:32] Hall of Fame.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; I just have to read you the lyrics to
[1:30:36] this song. And we don't even know how to
[1:30:39] sing it here. And if somebody knows how
[1:30:40] to sing it, they can come and sing it.
[1:30:43] If I can get through this without
[1:30:45] breaking down.
[1:30:48] To look back at our lives, brothers and
[1:30:51] sisters, and to be able to see it from
[1:30:54] the shepherd's point of view.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Our lives look all together different.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; And he they sister uh Sandy Ble from the
[1:31:07] BLE family wrote this. The Macami sang
[1:31:09] it. Sandy Blle, Holiness Lady,
[1:31:12] tremendous lyric, you are standing on
[1:31:15] the mountain, holding to the shepherd's
[1:31:18] hand. The valley you just came through
[1:31:21] was hard to understand.
[1:31:24] The shepherd draws you closer. There's
[1:31:27] something he wants you to see,
[1:31:29] and he points back to the valley and
[1:31:32] unfolds its mysteries.
[1:31:36] As the eagles soar around you and you
[1:31:38] look back where you've been, one by one,
[1:31:41] he answers questions that he did not
[1:31:44] answer then.
[1:31:47] He now shows you the danger of going
[1:31:50] your own way.
[1:31:52] All those roads you thought were better
[1:31:55] would have led your soul astray. That's
[1:31:57] right.
[1:31:59] He reminds you of that moment when you
[1:32:01] could not make it through and now you
[1:32:04] see one set of footprints where he
[1:32:07] reached down and carried you. That's
[1:32:08] right.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; As your tears fall on his shoulder
[1:32:14] and you thank him for his love, he said,
[1:32:17] "Child,
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; I knew that one day you'd see this
[1:32:21] valley from above."
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; The course says things look different on
[1:32:27] the mountain from the shepherd's point
[1:32:29] of view.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Standing high above the trial that he
[1:32:32] brought you safely through.
[1:32:35] All the valley's disappointments
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; will never look the same to you
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; cuz things look different on the
[1:32:43] mountain from the shepherd's point of
[1:32:45] view.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you have a great
[1:32:52] shepherd? Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; He's watching over your life when you
[1:32:56] can't even watch it over yourself. He's
[1:32:58] just guiding. And
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; aren't you glad that someday
[1:33:03] the shepherd's going to give us all the
[1:33:04] answers?
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; I tell this to people that are grieving,
[1:33:09] are not understanding,
[1:33:12] and I don't even have answers for them.
[1:33:16] And the only encouragement I get is
[1:33:17] someday the shepherd
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; will stand there and look back at
[1:33:22] everything.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; And I always tell them, we're going to
[1:33:25] get all the answers.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; And guess what? They're going to be good
[1:33:30] answers
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; because God only had something good in
[1:33:34] mind.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; We don't get all the answers here,
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; but we'll get all the answers there.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; And it will be good that he stands
[1:33:44] there. I just I love the part where you
[1:33:47] lean over and you just weep on his
[1:33:48] shoulder. I read that this morning. I
[1:33:50] said, "God, hasten the day and give me
[1:33:53] some time because I just want to embrace
[1:33:55] you and weep on your shoulder.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; I want to embrace my shepherd."
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; I want to embrace him
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; and and think about this. He'll look
[1:34:07] back through and he'll show you and give
[1:34:10] you all the answers why that you didn't
[1:34:13] know why.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; I can trust a God like that.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; And if he has that kind of grace for us,
[1:34:20] friends, can we have that grace for
[1:34:22] others?
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Can we have that vision? Not as a
[1:34:26] prophet has a vision, but can we be like
[1:34:28] the prophet in the sense that that he
[1:34:30] said, "I see you're being stubborn. I
[1:34:33] see I could call your name, but he says,
[1:34:35] I'm looking beyond that, and you're
[1:34:36] going to believe someday.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; You're gonna get past all your
[1:34:40] bitterness someday.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; You're gonna get past your teenage
[1:34:43] rebellion someday.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; I've got you. I've got your name. I'm
[1:34:47] going to call your name someday. And
[1:34:48] like brother John Andy said, Norah, in
[1:34:50] that message that you guys are out there
[1:34:52] enjoyed so much, he says he's he's got a
[1:34:54] date circled on the calendar for that
[1:34:57] person's life. Amen.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; And because we don't know that date, we
[1:35:02] get frustrated.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; But if you're a son and daughter of God,
[1:35:06] no matter if you're a 13-year-old, 16y
[1:35:08] old, 60 year old, if God is in your
[1:35:12] mind, there's a date circled on the
[1:35:14] calendar
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; that he's going to give you a life
[1:35:17] experience, a lifechanging
[1:35:20] experience,
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; and you're going to see this all
[1:35:23] together different.
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; I love the grace of God.
[1:35:29] God's grace. Grace that will pardon and
[1:35:32] cleanse
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; within. Let's stand. Grace,
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; oh God's
[1:35:44] grace,
[1:35:47] grace that
[1:35:49] is greater
[1:35:52] than all
[1:35:54] our
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; We had the first verse. Marvelous grace
[1:36:00] of our [singing] loveing
[1:36:03] Lord.
[1:36:05] Grace that exceeds [music]
[1:36:09] our sin and our guilt
[1:36:13] beyond
[1:36:15] on [singing] capt
[1:36:21] [singing]
[1:36:22] there where the blood of [singing] the
[1:36:27] lamb
[1:36:28] was spilled. Oh grace,
[1:36:33] [music] grace,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; God's
[1:36:38] grace,
[1:36:41] grace that
[1:36:43] pardon [singing]
[1:36:45] and cleans
[1:36:47] within
[1:36:50] grace.
[1:36:55] God's
[1:36:57] grace. [music]
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Grace that
[1:37:02] gater. [singing]
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; I've been catching myself lately in my
[1:37:10] attitude as I see someone that looks so
[1:37:12] different than what I believe.
[1:37:15] maybe outwardly and they got pierced
[1:37:19] things all through their body and
[1:37:20] tattoos and I've been catching myself
[1:37:23] because the first reactions that oh God
[1:37:25] have mercy.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; But then
[1:37:30] [snorts] if I don't pray for them, I
[1:37:32] might be their only hope.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; If I have something greater than all of
[1:37:38] that, then I ought to represent it and
[1:37:40] they might not talk to me, but I can
[1:37:42] pray for that person.
[1:37:45] Check your motive. Check your attitude.
[1:37:47] Check if you got too much pride to
[1:37:49] connect with that person because one
[1:37:51] word inspired of the grace of God
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; could change their life.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Check our attitudes. How many raise your
[1:37:58] hand said, "Check my attitude, Lord.
[1:38:00] Don't let me put somebody in a certain
[1:38:02] profile. Don't let me do that. Nobody
[1:38:05] likes that. I'm glad somebody didn't do
[1:38:06] that with me.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; They handed me a book. They handed me
[1:38:09] something, a track. They talked to me.
[1:38:12] They, you know, they
[1:38:14] Somebody did it for you. Lord, help us
[1:38:16] to not have a message pride. And this
[1:38:19] morning, if you haven't fully
[1:38:21] surrendered to our precious shepherd,
[1:38:23] our Lord, I just ask you if he's
[1:38:26] speaking to your heart, then that's a
[1:38:28] voice you need to respond to and say,
[1:38:30] I'm ready to talk to him. Heavenly
[1:38:34] Father,
[1:38:38] marvelous grace of God,
[1:38:41] things look different from the mountain
[1:38:43] from the shepherd's point of view.
[1:38:46] I long for that day when I'll [music]
[1:38:48] lean over on your shoulder and cry on
[1:38:50] your shoulder and weep as you go through
[1:38:52] and show me all the trials and things
[1:38:55] that I went through and I didn't
[1:38:56] understand. And you show me the reasons
[1:38:58] why. You show me there was a there's a
[1:39:00] good reason for that. and you were
[1:39:02] [music] you were watching over me the
[1:39:04] whole time.
[1:39:06] I look forward to that day, Lord, when
[1:39:08] we'll talk it over in the buy and buy.
[1:39:10] I'll ask the reason and you'll tell me
[1:39:12] why. [music]
[1:39:14] Lord, I pray for those hearts this
[1:39:15] morning, Lord, that that might still
[1:39:18] have that locking up, that that
[1:39:20] hesitance. Lord, would you love them so
[1:39:23] much that they they just fall down
[1:39:26] before you and say, "He loves me so
[1:39:29] much. I can't get away from this loving
[1:39:32] savior.
[1:39:33] May they come to you, Lord, because
[1:39:35] [music]
[1:39:36] they desired you. Change their desires
[1:39:40] so that they desire you with all their
[1:39:42] heart. Granted, Father, and us
[1:39:44] Christians who have been in the way for
[1:39:46] many years, may we be corrected and
[1:39:48] admonished this morning. May we lose our
[1:39:52] judgmental
[1:39:53] putting people in a certain category.
[1:39:55] May we lose that, Lord. [music] We don't
[1:39:57] lose the truth. We don't lose the
[1:39:59] judgment of the word, but we lose our
[1:40:01] personal judgment on someone because
[1:40:04] Lord, if that's a Sarah,
[1:40:07] she may come later, but Lord, if she's
[1:40:09] your daughter, she's coming someday.
[1:40:14] May we trust in that, Father, and trust
[1:40:16] in your grace. May we give everyone that
[1:40:19] little spot of grace that brother
[1:40:20] Brandon was giving at that moment. We
[1:40:23] ask it in your precious name. Amen.
[1:40:26] Second verse.
[1:40:29] God bless you saints. Second [music]
[1:40:30] verse. Do we have that one? Grace, sin,
[1:40:35] and despair
[1:40:37] like the sea
[1:40:39] waves. Think about this. Threaten
[1:40:44] the [singing] soul
[1:40:46] with infinite
[1:40:50] loss.
[1:40:52] Grace that is greater.
[1:40:56] Yes, grace

[1:41:39] God's grace,
[1:41:42] grace that is greater
[1:41:46] than all
[1:41:49] my sin.
[1:41:52] Dark is the stain that we cannot
[1:41:59] [singing] hide.
[1:42:02] What can aail [singing]
[1:42:07] to wash it over
[1:42:11] Jesus? [music]

[1:42:17] a cream. [music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:42:21] Yes.
[1:42:23] Wider [music] than [singing] snow you
[1:42:27] may be

[1:42:37] Oh, God's
[1:42:40] grace.
[1:42:43] Grace that [singing]
[1:42:45] will pardon

[1:42:49] with it. [music]
