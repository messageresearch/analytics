[0:00] just take
[0:01] our scriptures tonight
[0:04] to Joshua
[0:06] chapter 1.
[0:14] as we please be on our feet
[0:17] we are reading Joshua
[0:20] chapter one
[0:22] and verse 8 and 9.
[0:29] and then we'll read the first
[0:31] Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16. first
[0:34] let's take
[0:36] Joshua chapter
[0:38] 1 verse 8 and 9.
[0:41] this book of the law shall not depart
[0:43] out of thy mouth
[0:45] but thou shall meditate during day and
[0:48] night
[0:48] that thou mayest observe to do according
[0:52] to all that is written the ring
[0:54] for then thou shall make thy way
[0:57] prosperous
[0:58] and then thou shall have good sources
[1:03] have not I commanded thee be strong and
[1:07] of good courage
[1:08] be not afraid
[1:10] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[1:13] thy God is with thee with us forever
[1:16] thou goes
[1:19] now First Corinthians
[1:25] First Corinthians chapter 2
[1:30] and verse 16.
[1:39] First Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16.
[1:42] for who have known the mind of the Lord
[1:44] that he may instruct him
[1:47] but we have the mind of Christ
[1:50] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[1:52] of his word amen beloved let's take our
[1:54] seed
[1:56] tonight
[2:02] we are speaking on a topic
[2:05] a short topic of course
[2:07] taking God's way
[2:10] Hallelujah
[2:12] taking God's way
[2:14] the Bible have already made us to
[2:16] understand
[2:20] that there is a way that cement right
[2:22] unto a man
[2:24] but at the end of the that Journey or
[2:27] that way is a way of Destruction
[2:31] Hallelujah
[2:33] so man
[2:34] uses his mind to take away which
[2:38] sometimes is not the will of God
[2:42] one time
[2:44] when Jesus Christ asks the disciples
[2:49] a question
[2:52] and it infiltrated them
[2:56] the Bible said that most of the
[2:58] disciples went back
[3:00] and they didn't work with Christ again
[3:05] that was the time that God was breaking
[3:07] in
[3:10] and you know always
[3:13] the last minute is in which in the third
[3:14] Ministry always separates the believer
[3:16] from the unbeliever
[3:19] it become a junction
[3:21] that the unbeliever don't cross to where
[3:24] the believer is and the believer don't
[3:26] cross also to wear their believer the
[3:28] believer the believer don't cross to the
[3:31] unbeliever and the believer also don't
[3:32] close to the unbeliever
[3:34] because it breaks a barrier a boundary
[3:39] Jesus said
[3:41] where we have reached now in the
[3:43] ministry
[3:44] unless you eat my flesh
[3:48] and drink my blood
[3:50] you won't have any life in you
[3:53] some said wow
[3:55] how can we eat your flesh and drink your
[3:57] blood
[3:58] this is the heart saying
[4:01] and return the Bible said that they turn
[4:03] away
[4:04] they did not walk with Christ again
[4:08] and when Jesus try to look around and he
[4:10] saw the twelve that he chose
[4:12] he asked them a question
[4:15] will you also go
[4:17] Hallelujah
[4:19] will you also make your own way
[4:23] will you live my way and create your own
[4:27] Peter look at Jesus
[4:30] it's a master to whom should we go
[4:34] where at all can be better
[4:37] which way should we take
[4:40] you are the only one
[4:42] that have the words of eternal life
[4:46] and Peter stood by saying and he chose
[4:51] God's way
[4:53] oh brother sister you and I agree
[4:56] that we have reached a Time
[4:59] that the spirit that is governing this
[5:03] world now has created so many channels
[5:07] and people many people have found
[5:09] themselves on that way which of course
[5:11] is taking them to destruction
[5:15] Hallelujah
[5:17] loudisha have created a way of indecency
[5:23] La audition of created a way of
[5:26] immorality
[5:28] laodicia have created a way of laziness
[5:34] Hallelujah until until sometimes it want
[5:37] to swallow up some even Christians
[5:42] but brother sister
[5:43] tonight without seriousness
[5:46] I am telling you that the Holy Ghost is
[5:48] not lazy
[5:51] the Holy Ghost cannot be lazy and the
[5:54] Holy Ghost is not lazy
[5:56] therefore if we're Christian and you see
[5:59] Sentiments of laziness in you please
[6:02] check the spirit that is really
[6:06] Hallelujah
[6:07] because we have reached a Time beloved
[6:10] brothers and sisters
[6:11] does something must Shake us
[6:15] something that keep us on the way of God
[6:18] something must bring us back to the
[6:20] channel that God pay for us
[6:23] praise be in the name of our God
[6:26] Hallelujah
[6:28] you take your way by inspiration
[6:31] and by revelation
[6:34] there was one time
[6:36] when Ruth
[6:39] was with Naomi if you remember that
[6:42] story carefully
[6:44] it came to a point now when we realized
[6:46] that
[6:48] he has wasted all his Resources by going
[6:52] to be with them moabites
[6:56] so she need to go back home
[6:59] but then the sons
[7:02] and the husband were all dead
[7:06] this
[7:07] two women
[7:09] decided to go with Naomi
[7:12] now what we said no woman
[7:14] you were my in-laws correct all right I
[7:17] know the way you have loved me I know
[7:19] the way you have cared for me I know the
[7:21] way you have served me
[7:23] but why will you choose to go with me
[7:27] I am old
[7:29] and even if God
[7:31] will be so gracious
[7:34] and giving children again
[7:37] will it be possible for you to wait
[7:40] till they are grown
[7:42] it's impossible
[7:44] so why don't you go back to your people
[7:47] now there were two ways before these two
[7:50] women
[7:52] their way to go back to
[7:54] Moab to worship kamash
[7:57] or the way to go with Naomi to worship
[8:00] the god of the Israelites
[8:03] two weeks
[8:04] Hallelujah which one are you choosing
[8:07] tonight
[8:09] brother Braum said
[8:11] about represented the denomination
[8:15] you know the denomination always behave
[8:17] as if they love Jesus Christ
[8:19] But when reality comes they deny Jesus
[8:22] Christ
[8:24] Hallelujah so when the bible say that
[8:27] oppa reach up to Naomi and he kissed the
[8:31] woman
[8:32] and she went back to worship the idol
[8:36] commercial
[8:37] but look at the woman called Ruth
[8:41] she didn't know Bethlehem
[8:43] she didn't know Israel
[8:45] but by what she had
[8:49] she made a decision to take God's way
[8:53] and she looked at Naomi I said madam
[8:57] and treat me not to return from
[8:59] following thee
[9:00] for where you are going I will go
[9:03] your God will be my God
[9:07] your people shall be my people
[9:10] when you sleep there I will sleep
[9:13] Hallelujah
[9:15] why you die there I will die
[9:17] and where you are buried there I will be
[9:20] buried
[9:22] what kind of inspiration was that
[9:24] what kind of Revelation was that
[9:27] because the woman determined to go God's
[9:29] way
[9:30] she knew that indeed she came up from
[9:33] Ideal Home
[9:34] and now when we have to introduce to her
[9:37] the god of the Israelites which was the
[9:40] only true God
[9:41] so she was determined to go and embrace
[9:44] that God
[9:45] but will she take her own way
[9:48] or she should take God's way
[9:51] that woman took God's way
[9:53] Hallelujah
[9:55] and when they got back
[9:57] to battle him
[9:58] look at what happened
[10:00] they didn't have anything
[10:02] no food to eat
[10:04] no water to drink
[10:06] but God made the way
[10:09] God made the way
[10:11] when they got up in the morning and
[10:14] Naomi told her why don't you go and see
[10:17] if you can get some fields that they are
[10:20] harvesting
[10:21] go and follow the Harvesters the Reapers
[10:24] you get something for us
[10:27] and this woman went on the field
[10:30] beloved
[10:32] if you go God's way God will always
[10:35] guide you
[10:37] God guided Ruth
[10:40] and she found herself
[10:42] on the field of the kinsman redeemer of
[10:45] Naomi
[10:47] unknowingly
[10:49] Hallelujah unknowingly
[10:51] and she started learning from the
[10:54] Harvesters you know she was following
[10:55] them it was not quite long when the man
[10:57] Boaz came
[10:59] and Boaz saw this woman
[11:02] and he asked the workers who is that
[11:05] woman
[11:06] they introduced and we say yeah this is
[11:08] the lady the woman that Naomi brought
[11:11] from MOA say oh is that so
[11:14] is that that woman
[11:16] okay now let me give you instructions
[11:19] concerning her
[11:20] repairs for the sake of that woman
[11:24] whilst you are ripping deliberately
[11:29] leave some of their belly or whatsoever
[11:32] the wheat behind you so that she can get
[11:36] them what was that it was special Grace
[11:40] it was special Grace beloved if you
[11:43] follow God God will always exhibit his
[11:46] grace abundantly on your way
[11:49] and you pick up things you have not even
[11:52] thought of
[11:53] Hallelujah great to put you at the
[11:56] position that you don't have any idea
[11:58] because you have taken God's way
[12:01] amen and amen
[12:03] she went home
[12:05] then the mother said wow why are you so
[12:08] early to come back home he said it was a
[12:11] favor of God
[12:13] another time
[12:15] she went back
[12:17] now bua said woman don't go after the
[12:21] Reapers but come straight to the
[12:23] warehouse
[12:25] [Music]
[12:27] God elevated her
[12:29] amen God promoted her now she was not
[12:34] going to follow their Reapers but she
[12:36] went straight to the warehouse and Boaz
[12:39] measured six
[12:42] measures of belly or wheat and give to
[12:45] this woman oh brother there is a
[12:48] revelation there
[12:49] why sex and not seven
[12:52] Hallelujah we believe that the number
[12:55] six is always the number of man
[12:57] but when you're talking about the number
[12:59] seven is the revelation of God
[13:03] hallelujah God always be in a servant
[13:07] but was became the seventh belly for the
[13:11] roots
[13:14] Hallelujah brother
[13:17] if you take God's way God knows how to
[13:21] deal with you
[13:22] now let's read back Joshua the chapter
[13:26] one
[13:28] amen
[13:39] now listen
[13:42] if God wants you to take his way
[13:45] he prepare himself for you
[13:47] and he makes sure that you go by his
[13:50] weight
[13:51] now that's why he said now after the
[13:54] death of Moses the servant of the Lord
[13:56] it came to pass that the Lord spoke unto
[13:59] Joshua
[14:00] the son of none Moses
[14:05] Moses Minister saying Moses my servant
[14:09] is dead now therefore arise
[14:11] go over this Jordan
[14:13] thou and all these people
[14:17] unto the land which I do give to them
[14:19] even to the children of Israel
[14:22] every place that the soul of your foot
[14:25] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[14:29] you as I said unto Moses
[14:31] from the Wilderness and this Lebanon
[14:35] even onto the Great River the river who
[14:38] frites all the land of the Hittites and
[14:41] unto the great sea toward the going down
[14:44] of the Sun
[14:46] shall be your Coast
[14:48] that shall not any man be able to stand
[14:51] before thee all the days of thy life
[14:55] and that is where the Blessed Assurance
[14:57] is
[14:58] there shall not any man be able to stand
[15:01] before thee all the days of thy life as
[15:04] I was with Moses so I will be with thee
[15:07] I will not fail thee not forsake thee
[15:11] be strong and of good courage
[15:14] For unto these people who shall thou
[15:16] divide for an inheritance the land which
[15:18] I swear unto their fathers to give them
[15:22] verse 7. only be down strong and very
[15:26] courageous that thou Mayors observe to
[15:28] do according to all the law which Moses
[15:31] my servant commanded thee then not from
[15:35] it to the right hand or to the left that
[15:38] thou mayest Prosper with us over thou
[15:41] goest so it means if you take God's way
[15:44] there's Prosperity ahead of you
[15:48] if you take God's way there's liberty
[15:50] ahead of you
[15:51] if you take God's word there is healing
[15:54] and there's everything that you can
[15:56] think of Hallelujah
[15:58] they're saying detect this book of the
[16:00] law shall not depart out of thy mouth
[16:02] but thou shall meditate therein day and
[16:05] night that thou mayest observe to do
[16:08] according to all that is written therein
[16:11] not some but all that is written therein
[16:16] for then thou shall make thy way
[16:18] prosperous
[16:21] and then Thou shalt have good sources
[16:25] have not I commanded thee be strong and
[16:28] of good courage Be not Afraid neither be
[16:32] thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is
[16:35] with thee with the surviva thou goes
[16:40] Hallelujah without server thou goeth
[16:43] meaning if you take God's way you are
[16:46] not going to go alone
[16:48] if you take God's way there's no danger
[16:51] if you take God's way there's not going
[16:53] to be any hindrance and obstacle on your
[16:55] way if you take God's way everything is
[16:58] going to be well with you
[17:00] praise the name of our God and when root
[17:02] took that we all know what happened to
[17:04] her
[17:05] Hallelujah eventually
[17:09] when Naomi was redeemed
[17:12] Ruth got the opportunity
[17:15] to marry Boaz
[17:18] isn't it wonderful
[17:20] if he chose her own way
[17:22] and go back to the moabites and worship
[17:26] what do you think would have happened to
[17:28] her
[17:29] but because she took us away Hallelujah
[17:32] and we don't just take God's way and
[17:35] think that we can use our own thinking
[17:38] or our own minds to do whatever we want
[17:41] to do no brother no sister the Bible
[17:45] said that we should let the mind of
[17:47] Christ be in US and when we have the
[17:51] mind of Christ within us then we can pay
[17:53] God's way and do according to his word
[17:57] he told Joshua he said meditate upon the
[18:00] word
[18:01] now you when you say you were a message
[18:03] believer that is not enough
[18:05] Hallelujah you cannot just say you are
[18:08] just a message believer and thus ends no
[18:11] what makes you a message believer
[18:14] because you know the message and you
[18:16] feed on the message
[18:18] you abide by the message and you act
[18:20] upon the message what the message say
[18:22] you should do that is what you do
[18:25] he said meditate upon it day and night
[18:29] Hallelujah do we do that
[18:33] oh brother
[18:35] let's equate this scripture with
[18:37] Deuteronomy chapter 11 quickly
[18:42] Deuteronomy
[18:45] chapter 11.
[18:56] Deuteronomy 11
[18:59] let me tackle from verse 13.
[19:03] oh sorry yeah
[19:11] verse 30 and it shall come to pass if ye
[19:15] shall hear can diligently unto my
[19:17] commandment which I command you this day
[19:19] to love the Lord your God and to serve
[19:22] him with all your heart and with all
[19:25] your soul ah that I will give you the
[19:28] reign of your land in his dual season
[19:33] the first rain and the latter rain that
[19:36] thou mayest Gather in thy con and thy
[19:39] wine and thine oil
[19:42] and I will send grass in the fields for
[19:45] thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be
[19:48] full
[19:49] take heed to yourself that your heart be
[19:52] not deceived and yet turned aside and
[19:56] serve other gods and worship them
[19:59] and then the Lord's Rock be kindled
[20:01] against you and he shut up the heaven
[20:04] that there be no rain and that the land
[20:07] yield not a fruit unless he perish
[20:10] quickly from off
[20:13] the good land which the Lord gaveth you
[20:16] therefore shall ye lay up this my words
[20:20] in your hearts and this is why I wanted
[20:23] to take a very big note therefore shall
[20:26] you lay up this my words in your heart
[20:29] and in your soul and bind them for a
[20:33] sign upon your hand that there may be as
[20:38] frontless between your eyes
[20:41] verse 19 and here shall teach them your
[20:45] children
[20:47] speaking of them when thou seated in thy
[20:51] house and when thou worketh by the way
[20:54] when thou lies down and when thou Rises
[20:58] up
[20:59] Hallelujah
[21:01] the prophet said that when you read the
[21:04] scriptures when you read the Bible you
[21:06] say wherever you read it put yourself in
[21:09] there
[21:12] so now we don't have Old Testament and
[21:14] we don't have New Testament
[21:17] we have our current Testament
[21:20] Hallelujah every part of the Bible is
[21:23] working in our lives
[21:26] amen we have current Testament
[21:29] there is no expiry date of the word of
[21:31] God
[21:33] he says we should abide by the word and
[21:37] we should teach them our children
[21:39] speaking of them when thou seated in thy
[21:43] house
[21:44] and when thou workers by the way and
[21:47] when thou Liars down and when thou Rises
[21:50] up
[21:51] see ourselves and teach our children
[21:56] Hallelujah
[21:58] we have to teach our children and teach
[22:00] our children thank God that we have the
[22:02] Sunday School in the church
[22:04] and we are doing exactly what the Bible
[22:06] tells us
[22:09] but today what do we see
[22:12] most of the time
[22:13] we don't even have time to take the
[22:16] Bible we don't even have time to take
[22:20] the message books and check certain
[22:22] things and read certain things
[22:25] but rather we take ah what do we call it
[22:30] ah YouTube
[22:32] and we take uh uh Twitter
[22:36] and we take uh Instagram
[22:39] and we take which is the other one
[22:41] you can name them
[22:43] alone that is what we take and rather we
[22:47] waste time so much on it oh yes say
[22:51] brother we do business on yes I know
[22:54] that you do business on it
[22:57] is that all
[22:59] is that all you can do on it there are a
[23:01] lot of things people are doing on the
[23:03] internet
[23:06] Hallelujah but what about the others
[23:09] that waste your time
[23:12] the time of you taking the word of God
[23:14] into your heart
[23:16] the time that you have to tell the word
[23:18] of God and teach somebody
[23:21] you don't have time for that
[23:23] but you have all that time
[23:25] on the media
[23:27] which does not help you in any way
[23:31] that doesn't help you in any way
[23:35] praise be the name of our God my brother
[23:38] my sister the business that we are doing
[23:41] with God is very serious business
[23:45] that nobody should joke with that
[23:48] brother we are living in a very
[23:50] deceptive age
[23:51] that people are thinking that is just a
[23:55] matter of saying oh I am a Christian no
[23:57] there is more to that there is more than
[24:00] that brother sister and the more that
[24:02] you have to do is to make sure that you
[24:05] are in the word of God you are on God's
[24:08] way you are meditating upon the word of
[24:10] God day and night he said when you sit
[24:13] you must talk about it when you sleep
[24:15] you must talk about it when you get up
[24:17] you must talk about it teach your
[24:19] children
[24:24] Hallelujah
[24:27] amen
[24:28] wrote stood as a firm woman
[24:31] she did not care about the condition she
[24:34] did not care about whatever was
[24:36] surrounding her she said no I am taking
[24:39] God's way
[24:40] I am taking God's way and cannot imagine
[24:43] a woman and a a gentle woman talking
[24:46] about where Naomi will die and where
[24:50] she'll be buried do you know why she
[24:52] caught the revelation of the burial of
[24:55] Jesus Christ and the resurrection of
[24:57] Jesus Christ
[24:59] she knew
[25:00] by Revelation that there is going to be
[25:03] Resurrection
[25:05] and we're down from that time she was
[25:08] prophesying about that
[25:11] yes because
[25:14] Abraham
[25:16] bought machipella
[25:18] and buried his wife
[25:21] Sarah
[25:22] he himself was buried there
[25:25] the Patricks were buried there
[25:27] Hallelujah why because they know that
[25:30] there is going to be Resurrection
[25:32] and today our machipella is Jesus Christ
[25:37] but look at that time
[25:39] the distance
[25:40] this woman called the revelation
[25:43] that there will be Resurrection
[25:45] so she was thinking about when a woman
[25:47] is going to be buried she wants to be
[25:49] buried there
[25:51] oh brother sister
[25:53] it was because she took God's way and
[25:56] tonight if you take God's way brother
[25:58] you will never regret
[26:01] if you take God's way you will see the
[26:03] power and the hand of God in your life
[26:05] if you take God's way you see what God
[26:08] has prepared for you
[26:10] you will not take God's way and regret
[26:13] when Joshua took God's way
[26:15] and that then when he was going to fight
[26:17] a malachite remember on his way he met a
[26:21] man standing in the way with their son
[26:24] drawn and God the Bible have already
[26:26] told Joshua God I've already told you to
[26:28] be bold and of good courage
[26:31] he was not scared but Joshua was so bold
[26:34] and he asked the man are you for us or
[26:37] you were against us
[26:40] and the man said
[26:42] I am the captain of the host of Israel
[26:45] then Joshua understood that he has met
[26:47] the angel of the Lord and he bowed down
[26:50] and worshiped my own brother
[26:53] he took God's way
[26:55] and God must be with him
[26:57] as you take God's way God will also be
[27:00] with you
[27:01] amen
[27:04] now listen to what prophet said here
[27:07] he said
[27:09] footsteps
[27:11] is a victory
[27:12] as he told Joshua
[27:14] everywhere the soul of your food will
[27:16] Trot I will give it to you
[27:19] footsteps becomes your Victory brother
[27:22] and sister
[27:24] and I tell you today
[27:26] let us throat on the lungs that God gave
[27:28] to us
[27:29] Divine healing powers of God everything
[27:33] now coming into Christ is like going
[27:36] down into a big arcade down here
[27:38] there are variety stores just think
[27:42] in a variety store the size of this
[27:45] Tabernacle yes sir
[27:48] I look all around
[27:50] there is everything in there
[27:53] the shelves are full of nice pretty
[27:56] things
[27:57] and everything that I like they are all
[27:59] mine oh brother
[28:02] every one of them belongs to me
[28:04] I can go over and take what I want to
[28:08] why because you have taken God's way
[28:12] and every precious thing in Jesus
[28:15] belongs to you
[28:17] that is what the prophet was referring
[28:19] to Hallelujah he said everything belongs
[28:22] to me I can go over and take whatever I
[28:24] want
[28:26] and people did the same thing in the
[28:29] Bible because they believe on the Lord
[28:31] Jesus Christ they were able to go to
[28:34] Jesus and take what belongs to them
[28:38] remember the Centurion
[28:41] when he went to see Jesus he said Master
[28:43] will you come and pray for my servant
[28:47] and when Jesus decided to go
[28:49] he said no master there is not even no
[28:51] need to for you to come under my roof
[28:54] I'm a I'm a man of authority
[28:57] I have servants under me I command them
[29:00] go and they go come and they come so
[29:03] just speak the word
[29:05] Hallelujah Jesus look at the man he said
[29:08] wow what a fake
[29:11] whatever let it be according to what you
[29:13] have said and immediately a servant was
[29:16] healed
[29:18] what about the other woman the woman
[29:20] with the infirmity for 12 years
[29:23] ah they have been told not to go to the
[29:25] crusade of Jesus Christ
[29:27] therefore I see the disease have
[29:29] polluted their minds
[29:31] they have discouraged everyone to go for
[29:34] Jesus
[29:35] but my brother
[29:37] will you go that way
[29:39] will you allow somebody to pollute your
[29:41] mind concerning the word of God the
[29:44] woman said no
[29:46] she got to the Crusade grounds
[29:49] and he said
[29:51] let me take this man
[29:54] and touches him
[29:56] when I touch his hand I am sure I will
[29:59] make whole
[30:01] and can we imagine
[30:04] she took that way
[30:06] and touched him
[30:08] of the Garment of Jesus
[30:10] and for the first time
[30:12] Jesus complained that somebody have
[30:15] touched him
[30:17] he said Peter somebody have touched me
[30:19] Peter said oh Master when we're coming
[30:21] by the way there have been a lot of
[30:23] people that have touched you why do you
[30:25] say this
[30:28] Jesus said well I know Peter a lot of
[30:31] people have touched me but all those
[30:33] touches were touches of ordinary touches
[30:35] but this particular touch is a touch of
[30:38] Revelation
[30:39] it was a touch of Faith because virtue
[30:42] has gone out of me
[30:45] when Jesus Christ was complaining then
[30:47] the woman owner
[30:49] the master is I it's a woman
[30:52] your faith has made you free
[30:57] and today
[30:59] he's the same yesterday today and
[31:00] forever
[31:02] that power has not changed
[31:05] if only we can reach him and touch His
[31:08] Garment everything will be made possible
[31:10] in our lives
[31:13] We Don't Preach Jesus of History
[31:15] we don't pray Jesus our future but we
[31:18] pray Jesus of current
[31:20] Jesus of today is what we are preaching
[31:23] he is the same yesterday today and
[31:25] forever beloved brothers and sisters
[31:27] Hallelujah and Christ is of the right to
[31:31] store but our spirit we are all baptized
[31:34] into one big variety storm amen anything
[31:38] you have need of he will supply it
[31:41] if I need healing I will take it
[31:45] if you need joy you must take it
[31:48] if you need Victory you must take it
[31:50] hallelujah it's all hanging around in
[31:54] God's big shop
[31:57] when you go to Walmart right now there
[32:00] are a lot of things is it
[32:02] do you go and take all
[32:04] do you go and buy all you have something
[32:06] that you need
[32:08] and when you go you pick them
[32:10] you pick them you pick them when you are
[32:13] satisfied you go to the cashier and then
[32:16] you go and pay
[32:17] but with this shop we are talking about
[32:20] the shop that is Jesus Christ everything
[32:24] is already paid you only go and take
[32:27] what you want
[32:28] Hallelujah you only play God's play
[32:32] God's way and take what you want
[32:34] oh brother I can't imagine I can't
[32:37] imagine that even an animal a creature
[32:40] like opossum
[32:43] think of itself
[32:45] that she needed healing when it was
[32:48] wounded oh what made that creature to
[32:51] crawl and cross all the highways
[32:56] and lay down at the doorstep of the
[32:58] prophet
[33:00] what made that
[33:02] Hallelujah think about it brother if a
[33:05] creature like the opposal can even do
[33:07] that how much more you and I
[33:10] that Christ have died and shed his blood
[33:14] and washes from our sins and has made
[33:17] the sense of his what can't he do for us
[33:22] the prophet said
[33:24] there are a lot of things in there
[33:27] let's go get what belongs to us
[33:29] let's go and take what belongs to us
[33:32] because if you take God's way brother
[33:34] says that there is no nothing like
[33:37] Danger
[33:38] there's nothing like Danger
[33:41] there's nothing like like disappointment
[33:43] there can never be something like like
[33:46] frustration no
[33:49] because you have taken God's way
[33:51] the prophet look at the creature
[33:54] he did not understand himself
[33:57] and he was even talking to the creature
[33:59] that if you don't live here I will kill
[34:01] you and eat you
[34:02] Hallelujah
[34:04] but then
[34:05] after going back to his room and come
[34:07] back he realized that there's something
[34:10] wrong
[34:11] the spirit of God told him that that
[34:13] creature need your help
[34:15] and when you look around it was full of
[34:17] wounds
[34:19] and he removed his heart and nails and
[34:21] prayed
[34:22] oh Lord if this is the reason why this
[34:24] creature is here do it for it
[34:27] immediately
[34:29] this scripture God is healing
[34:32] and look at the way it even thank God
[34:35] for the healing
[34:37] bowing his head down three times before
[34:40] the prophet and then slip back to the
[34:43] bush
[34:44] it is God
[34:46] that made it possible
[34:47] and if God made it possible for the mama
[34:50] opposom he can make it possible for you
[34:52] also tonight he can make it possible in
[34:55] your life if only you continue to go

[36:56] troubles Hallelujah problems are no
[37:00] longer problems

[37:04] like the prophet was saying that when
[37:06] Joseph
[37:07] was told by the angel
[37:09] to take Mary and the child and go back
[37:13] to Egypt
[37:14] on a little donkey
[37:16] he said there were robbers on the way
[37:19] but because God was with them there was
[37:21] no danger
[37:23] Hallelujah
[37:24] and tonight
[37:26] just be reminded I am reminding you that
[37:29] if you take God's way also oh brother
[37:32] sister there is no danger on the way for
[37:34] you
[37:35] amen like David said the Lord is my
[37:39] shepherd I shall not want he maketh me
[37:42] to like to lie down in Green's Patches
[37:44] he leaded me beside Still Waters
[37:49] God leads me so is God's leadership not
[37:53] mass leadership
[37:54] Hallelujah don't let man create aware
[37:58] channel for you let God create a channel
[38:00] for you and pass it on and you will
[38:03] succeed in all that you do
[38:05] if you go God's way he will never leave
[38:08] you he will be with you he said behold I
[38:11] am with you all day so even the end of
[38:15] time
[38:17] what a Blessed assurance
[38:19] brother
[38:21] and sister
[38:23] it is time
[38:24] for us to assess ourselves
[38:27] are we on God's way
[38:30] are we going according to God's plan
[38:34] or the system
[38:36] have sway us
[38:40] are we living in complacency
[38:44] amen
[38:45] like those virgins
[38:47] they have the man to go and meet the
[38:49] bridegroom
[38:50] but they were living complacency
[38:54] Hallelujah
[38:56] when the blood group the day he signed
[38:58] they all slept
[39:00] but when the time came and they heard
[39:03] the sound the bridegroom is coming the
[39:05] bridegroom is coming
[39:07] those
[39:09] who were not complacency
[39:12] but they were serious about their
[39:14] confession
[39:16] they pick up the alarms
[39:18] they trim it
[39:20] and they moved Hallelujah to meet their
[39:23] bridegroom but those who live with
[39:26] complex they thought that everything was
[39:28] okay oh that is all right I'm a virgin
[39:31] I'm eating the bridegroom
[39:33] they realize that not knowing they
[39:36] didn't even have oil in the alarms
[39:39] they have to go
[39:41] and ask
[39:42] for those who have
[39:44] but I like the answer they give to them
[39:46] he said no
[39:48] my Holy Ghost
[39:50] is for me alone
[39:51] I cannot share my Holy Ghost with you
[39:54] if you want the Holy Ghost go to those
[39:57] who sell and the one that's not the Holy
[39:59] Ghost is Jesus Christ
[40:01] it doesn't even sell it to give it free
[40:03] if only you can come
[40:09] who were having the oil in the alarms
[40:12] the bridegroom came and they went with
[40:14] him
[40:16] I don't want you to live in complacency
[40:20] I don't want you to live
[40:22] and think that you are okay
[40:26] no other
[40:28] let's stream our alarms
[40:30] let's trim our arms again let us make
[40:33] sure that our lumps are burning
[40:36] on the way that God has paid for us
[40:38] because beloved this world has nothing
[40:41] to offer
[40:42] the problems are going to be problems
[40:45] and are going to be problems and more
[40:47] are going to come
[40:48] the only thing we need to do is to make
[40:51] sure that we are working on God's way
[40:56] brother
[40:58] let me give you a testimony before
[41:00] perhaps I close this evening
[41:03] to give way for the next program
[41:05] there's a sister in the church
[41:09] uh on the 28th if uh February
[41:13] I was not around
[41:15] I travel for Missions
[41:18] and their sister left home
[41:22] but
[41:23] when she came by the roadside there was
[41:25] one
[41:26] taxi person so he has to stop this car
[41:30] and when she stopped the car
[41:33] there is he she realized that there were
[41:35] three men sitting at the back seat
[41:38] so the front was empty
[41:43] so she sat at the front
[41:46] now the moment she banged the door
[41:49] then one of the men at the back said
[41:53] we've got one meat
[41:56] I don't know which meat she was
[41:58] referring to whether goat or cattle or I
[42:01] don't know
[42:03] but what happened was that the system
[42:06] realized that they were kidnappers
[42:10] that is why that man made that statement
[42:13] we've got one meat
[42:16] so immediately the sister said driver
[42:19] please I'll get down
[42:22] the driver didn't budge
[42:25] and the sister said again brother
[42:27] I want to get that place
[42:30] the driver still drove the car away
[42:34] and she said the touch High and the
[42:36] driver said you just boarded the car why
[42:39] do you want to get down
[42:41] and the sister said no ah I have left
[42:43] something at home I want to go and get
[42:46] it
[42:46] he said no I'm not going to stop
[42:49] so the driver drove the car
[42:53] beloved
[42:55] after a distance
[42:58] they came to meet three men
[43:00] standing by the roadside
[43:03] and one of the men stopped the car
[43:05] and dead at rubber storm
[43:09] then the man asked the driver
[43:13] I have heard the voice of this lady
[43:17] from far
[43:18] that she want to get down why are you
[43:22] not stopping the car
[43:25] so at that time the sister got
[43:28] opportunity to open the door
[43:30] and she got down
[43:32] and she banged the door
[43:35] after banking the door she was telling
[43:37] to say thank you to the man and there
[43:40] was nobody behind her
[43:44] so the sister came and told me he said
[43:46] pastor this what ah I said sister go to
[43:49] the church and go and tell the church
[43:50] what God have done for you
[43:53] Hallelujah and brother this took me
[43:56] straight to the time of Abraham
[43:59] when Abraham was looking for a child and
[44:03] the Lord God came down with two angels
[44:07] Hallelujah remember that they were three
[44:10] but in the tree it was one that spoke
[44:15] and when he spoke he didn't say that we
[44:19] he said I
[44:21] according through the time of life a
[44:24] year by this time I will visit you
[44:27] and your wife Sarah
[44:29] will bring forth I personal pronoun
[44:34] and that is exactly that happened in the
[44:37] life of sister Dorcas these were three
[44:40] men standing but one spoke he said I
[44:43] have heard the voice of this lady from
[44:46] afar she want to get down from your car
[44:49] why are you not stopping
[44:52] brother
[44:54] God is not far from us
[44:57] sister I am assuring you that God is not
[45:00] far from you he is always with us he is
[45:03] closer than we can even think of the
[45:05] only thing we need to do is to make sure
[45:07] that we are always working on God's way
[45:10] he will never leave us
[45:13] if you see things that things are not
[45:16] going the way you think things are not
[45:18] coming the way you expect do not be
[45:21] discouraged I always say that the time
[45:24] that you see that there are problems
[45:26] here and there coming your way that is
[45:29] the time that God is talking about you
[45:31] that is the time that God is thinking
[45:33] about you remember it was the same thing
[45:35] in the life of job job was living a
[45:38] perfect life I mean a holy life a
[45:40] glorious life that was no problem by the
[45:43] time that God spoke about job
[45:47] then something happened
[45:51] but job
[45:53] did not leave his faith
[45:55] job did not denounce God
[45:59] job kept working on God's way
[46:03] so anything that comes your way brother
[46:05] sister remember God is talking about you
[46:11] have you seen my servant Tom
[46:14] have you seen my servant
[46:16] Josiah have you seen my seven Boaz
[46:20] have you seen my my lady Sherry
[46:24] oh have you seen my lady Sharon
[46:26] Hallelujah have you seen myself
[46:30] yes that is the time that perhaps
[46:34] I'm not saying always I said perhaps
[46:37] God have decided
[46:39] to testify about your faith
[46:43] why then will you disgrace God no
[46:46] brother anything that will go through
[46:47] let us stand firm
[46:50] let us stand firm and know that he knows
[46:53] everything about us
[46:54] let us always go God's way
[46:57] God bless all of you
[47:00] I pray that the Lord will shine his
[47:02] glorious message upon you
[47:04] he will lift you up in the faith that
[47:07] that day when all the saints will be
[47:10] changed your body also will be changed
[47:12] as you walk on his way God bless all of
[47:16] us
[47:16] let's bow down our heads
[47:21] oh Lord
[47:24] these few words oh God that you lay upon
[47:27] my heart
[47:28] is what I've shared with your children
[47:32] now you pitch us with your blood before
[47:34] the foundation of the world
[47:37] father you always want
[47:40] that everyone should be careful
[47:43] the way he treats this little ones
[47:46] because their annuals are beholding your
[47:49] face all the time
[47:52] father
[47:53] I pray
[47:55] perhaps I didn't put it the way you
[47:57] wanted me to do
[47:58] but you know to do it best
[48:01] therefore ask your word have comfort
[48:03] let it have way in the life of your
[48:05] people

[48:09] it day and night

[48:13] also as we sleep as we walk wherever we
[48:18] find ourselves we pray that your
[48:21] presence will go with us may we be on
[48:24] your way oh Lord
