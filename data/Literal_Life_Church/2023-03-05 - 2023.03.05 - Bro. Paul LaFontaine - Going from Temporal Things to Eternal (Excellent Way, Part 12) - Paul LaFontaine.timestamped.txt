[0:00] second Corinthians 4 18 in our
[0:05] Holy Bible while we look not at the
[0:08] things which are seen But at the things
[0:10] which are not seen
[0:12] for the things which are seen are
[0:15] temporal
[0:16] but the things which are not seen are
[0:20] eternal
[0:21] so as Christians we we cannot look at
[0:25] just temporal things we cannot live
[0:28] with our eyes on just seeing things see
[0:31] what we see in front of us because the
[0:34] temple how many know that
[0:35] it's faith that makes us see the Unseen
[0:39] we have to live by faith can you say
[0:41] amen and Faith sees what is unseen Faith
[0:44] sees God's will God's plan we cannot be
[0:48] Christians that look at temporal things
[0:49] or the same things because they're
[0:51] temporal they'll end they'll fade away
[0:54] but we must look at things that won't
[0:56] fade away we must live on things that
[0:59] won't fade away
[1:00] amen I find people live in the past a
[1:03] lot they live in a rear view mirror they
[1:05] live their hearts are all locked up
[1:07] because every day they live in a
[1:09] rearview mirror while they're driving
[1:10] that's very dangerous driving you know
[1:13] very dangerous to drive looking trying
[1:15] to drive looking always looking at
[1:17] something that happened in the past to
[1:18] you but to drive forward we must forget
[1:21] the past ask God to forgive us and
[1:24] forgive others and not look in the river
[1:26] but look ahead another reason that
[1:29] people don't look ahead with a positive
[1:31] attitude and a and a strength and by
[1:33] faith look into the Unseen is because
[1:35] they're looking at temporal things
[1:38] temporal things will pass away amen
[1:40] prison so I want to speak this morning
[1:42] on from going from the temporal things
[1:44] to the Eternal things from temporal
[1:47] things to Eternal things and Lord we ask
[1:48] you to bless
[1:50] we thank you Lord we've got a reason
[1:51] father to Rejoice we got a reason to
[1:54] lift our hands we got a reason to praise
[1:56] the Lord this morning because you've
[1:58] given us so many reasons thank you
[2:00] Father and we commit the service to you
[2:02] in Jesus name amen God bless you may be
[2:05] seated
[2:11] transition from temporal things to
[2:13] eternal is what Paul was saying back in
[2:17] our study in First Corinthians 13 and I
[2:20] would just have you go back because I'm
[2:22] trying to finish the whole chapter of
[2:24] First Corinthians 13. this is what he
[2:27] was saying here too in our chapter on
[2:29] Divine love and chapter on the more
[2:31] excellent way and there's there's a
[2:34] scripture I read a couple Sundays ago
[2:36] that said charity verse 8 13 8 charity
[2:39] never faileth First Corinthians 13 8
[2:42] charity never failed but whether there
[2:44] be prophecies they shall fail whether
[2:47] they pre-tongues they shall cease
[2:49] whether there be knowledge it shall
[2:51] vanish away for we know in part we
[2:54] prophesy in part but when that which is
[2:56] perfect has come then that which is in
[2:59] part shall be done away so what is this
[3:01] speaking of it's speaking of a
[3:03] transition that Christians make from
[3:06] temporal things even prophecies are
[3:08] temporal things
[3:10] transitioning from Temple things to
[3:13] Eternal things and one of the things
[3:15] that's Eternal is the love of God it'll
[3:17] never fail you
[3:18] so that's why we want to be living more
[3:20] by the love of God than temporal things
[3:23] that we see we we may we are healing for
[3:27] our bodies we may be completely
[3:29] miraculously healed or a miracle take
[3:31] place but in some cases because in these
[3:33] bodies you'll get sick of something
[3:35] again so that that means that our
[3:37] healing is only for this life it's a
[3:39] temporal thing so in other words we
[3:42] believe in healing and we go to God for
[3:44] healing but we don't have our emphasis
[3:46] always on even those things that are
[3:48] temporal we must have it on the love of
[3:50] God we must have run something
[3:52] Eternal something that lasts and so he's
[3:55] teaching this and notice the next
[3:56] scripture in verse 11 when I was a child
[3:59] I spake as a child I understood as a
[4:02] child I thought as a child now he's
[4:04] getting ready to really bring a
[4:06] correction to the baby Corinthian Church
[4:09] spiritual babies
[4:12] and what did they do when I was a child
[4:14] I speak as a child I understood the
[4:15] child I thought as a child but when I
[4:17] became a man I put away childish things
[4:20] he's talking about maturity he's talking
[4:23] about growing from temporal things to
[4:26] Eternal things and he's saying the
[4:28] Corinthians chose to emphasize and stay
[4:31] as children spiritually that when they
[4:34] came to church all they wanted to see is
[4:37] just a prophecy or a tongue or something
[4:40] like that which is not a problem it's
[4:42] that should be that's that's a wonderful
[4:44] thing but if you only came to church
[4:47] just to see those things that won't last
[4:50] that won't keep you we should come to
[4:53] church to say I want to connect with the
[4:56] Eternal God through Jesus Christ the
[4:58] word there has to be a connection with
[5:01] something eternal is that okay with
[5:03] everybody
[5:04] because we could come even to church and
[5:06] get a good feeling the service could be
[5:09] just explosive and we could feel good
[5:11] and what I find in my Christian walk is
[5:14] that feeling that gives me goosebumps
[5:16] from the presence of the Lord only lasts
[5:18] to about Tuesday
[5:22] so then if I want to keep that feeling I
[5:25] would get all these videos and watch
[5:26] them every day instead of anything else
[5:28] because I've been having a Revival just
[5:30] watching these things the anointing
[5:31] Autumn and then we should do that can
[5:33] you say Amen
[5:36] I forgot a huge birthday I just realized
[5:39] it brother Tony ajirabessa's birthday
[5:41] was Friday and because of the ice storm
[5:43] I couldn't take him out for a steak
[5:44] dinner stand up brother Tony happy
[5:47] birthday to you my friend
[5:48] [Applause]
[5:49] brother Michael's dad from Nigeria
[5:54] faithful to the ministry for years
[5:55] Pastor in Nigeria and we love having him
[5:57] around here we prosely them all the time
[6:02] God bless you buddy we love you
[6:04] and then brother John and sister Joy
[6:06] he's saying has been I went to school
[6:08] with Brother John in Tucson and sister
[6:11] joy and so we're not given our ages
[6:13] either
[6:15] but it's sure great to have you this
[6:16] morning and uh in in our cold white
[6:19] North but it's been a great friendship
[6:21] through the years haven't seen each
[6:22] other a lot but it's good to have you
[6:23] praise the Lord so now that I did that I
[6:25] don't know where I'm at here now
[6:28] but we we must we must move we when we
[6:31] come to church
[6:33] we should be praying say God I love the
[6:36] feeling I love the emotion I love to
[6:37] feel your presence do whatever you can
[6:40] do whether it's a prayer line or whether
[6:42] it's in my seat but most of all change
[6:45] me and connect me with the Eternal you
[6:47] do realize that our Father Abraham
[6:49] that's when a change happened in uh in
[6:52] his life is that he connected with the
[6:56] Eternal the whole mystery of Melchizedek
[6:58] that was revealed in the end time nobody
[7:00] understood even the Jews the great
[7:02] rabbis didn't understand who is this
[7:04] Melchizedek king of Salem that had no
[7:07] beginning of days or ending of life and
[7:10] nobody touched on it Harley they
[7:12] speculated and then until at the end
[7:14] time that had to be revealed who is this
[7:16] Melchizedek God breaks that mystery to
[7:18] us which was a mystery of our theophanes
[7:21] is that that isn't just this body and
[7:24] this life Our Father Abraham sat down
[7:27] and somebody in flesh and it was a
[7:29] theophany that came a flesh man and and
[7:31] he he served Abraham his son communion
[7:36] after Abraham in battle he served him
[7:38] communion and they had a a a discussion
[7:41] and then when he goes away from him he
[7:44] never seen him again nobody knows where
[7:46] he come from where I'm telling the
[7:48] Eternal God met with his son Abraham and
[7:51] connected with him and told them you
[7:54] read your Bible now what do you tell
[7:55] them he told Abraham who he was
[7:58] can you say you're the possessor of
[8:00] Heaven and Earth
[8:02] it should have been it should have been
[8:03] Abraham saying to this Christ this
[8:06] theophany can you say Amen sure that
[8:09] you're the perseverance but it's the
[8:10] Christ that's often he's saying to his
[8:12] son you're the possessor of Heaven and
[8:15] Earth
[8:16] what a mystery
[8:19] so then Jesus Christ comes some 2000
[8:22] years later 3000 and now he says I only
[8:25] do that which I see the father show me
[8:27] do he's connected with the eternal
[8:31] skip ahead two thousand years and God
[8:34] has to connect with the sons of Abraham
[8:36] again and reveals himself again this is
[8:40] more than just a Pentecostal blessing
[8:42] that the message has given us
[8:47] this is deeper than just a feeling this
[8:49] is not just a repeat of the Azusa Street
[8:52] Pentecost
[8:55] in the end time God come down and
[8:57] connected with the son and is still
[8:59] doing it to where a prophet could say
[9:02] this term he said he said it this way
[9:04] and no other historical preacher nobody
[9:08] has ever dealt with the theophanese
[9:10] nobody has dealt with his turning around
[9:13] Eternal realm and now at the end time he
[9:15] says to you Sons God says to his sons it
[9:19] says when you come and you recognize ego
[9:22] food for this age and your body turns
[9:25] Heavenly this body turns heavenly
[9:28] and he's he's saying these terms like
[9:30] your body terms Heavenly under the
[9:33] mystery of Melchizedek you come in
[9:35] contact with the Eternal as well and
[9:37] it's not Jesus Jesus just Jesus Christ
[9:40] theophany you come in contact with your
[9:43] theophany
[9:47] and he says when you recognize this word
[9:50] as Eagle food and your body comes under
[9:53] subjection this sin born body who
[9:56] doesn't want to serve the Lord it
[9:58] doesn't want to line up doesn't want to
[10:00] do what the word says to do but somehow
[10:02] something happens to this body
[10:04] that'll never be born again this body
[10:06] will never be born again you're so well
[10:08] but this body will never be born again
[10:09] but you take a sinborne body and you
[10:12] connect with the Eternal that the soul
[10:14] you connected he says when this body
[10:16] recognizes the evil food he said you've
[10:18] turned Heavenly and you have heard from
[10:20] from your theophany
[10:23] so the reason this morning I have a
[10:26] reason to praise the reason I can lift
[10:27] my hands and be free and Worship the
[10:30] Lord no matter what's going on in my
[10:31] life no matter what criticism I'm
[10:33] receiving no matter what attitudes I can
[10:36] rejoice and praise the Lord because I've
[10:38] connected with something deeper than you
[10:41] and my problems I've connected with
[10:44] Melchizedek can you say Amen
[10:47] I've heard from my theophany why am I
[10:50] lifting my hands because my word body
[10:52] has no problem lifting its hands my word
[10:55] body has no problem with the word my
[10:58] word body is is eternal
[11:02] I have to bring up the scriptures for
[11:03] those critics who might say you're not
[11:05] getting that from the Bible yeah I am
[11:07] Paul said in First Corinthians he said
[11:09] when this Earthly Tabernacle be
[11:11] dissolved this body I have one aeonian
[11:14] in the heavens and aeonian means eternal
[11:18] I have another body
[11:21] aeonian in Heavens
[11:23] that was all out of my notes I better
[11:25] get back up here in my notes
[11:28] wow what a powerful mystery he's
[11:30] unfolded to us
[11:33] so Paul says that we are moving
[11:35] we have to live and he's speaking to
[11:37] Christians here in First Corinthians you
[11:38] have to know he's speaking to the
[11:39] Corinthians we must not put our trust or
[11:42] live only on things that will fade and
[11:45] it's surprising to find him say that we
[11:49] didn't we didn't expect we know about
[11:51] things that fade in our life friendships
[11:53] fade governments fade the world's
[11:56] falling apart
[11:57] we see everything fading away nothing
[12:00] lasts I'm going to talk about that in a
[12:02] minute and that's why we can't put our
[12:04] trust in something that don't last we
[12:07] can't teach our children to make their
[12:09] priority in life something that won't
[12:12] last
[12:13] can I get an amen
[12:15] I'll get to your parents in just a
[12:16] minute I want to give you some
[12:17] encouragement that we can't do that to
[12:19] our children but we are surprised to
[12:21] hear some other things that fade because
[12:23] these are things from the kingdom of God
[12:24] prophecies will fade tongues will fade
[12:27] knowledge will fade away
[12:30] so even things that are in the kingdom
[12:33] of God we take them we enjoy them but we
[12:35] can't put all of our dependents on these
[12:38] things because they will fade away
[12:39] someday but there's something that will
[12:41] never fade away that's the elective love
[12:44] of God over your life he loved you
[12:46] before the foundation of the world his
[12:48] love never changes for you
[12:50] blessed be his name love never had at a
[12:53] beginning so love will never have an end
[12:56] I like serving a God and I like serving
[12:59] him every day knowing that I am
[13:00] unconditionally loved from before the
[13:02] foundation of the world and nothing that
[13:04] I do will ever change that
[13:10] it is spiritual immaturity for
[13:12] Christians to live every day consumed
[13:14] with temporal things
[13:18] foreign
[13:21] blessings even blessings from God caught
[13:24] up in temporal even little children when
[13:27] Paul says when I was a child I speak
[13:29] he's typing a young child their child
[13:31] their child they think is that child
[13:33] they act like a child and that's normal
[13:35] for a child but we can't stay children
[13:37] spiritually and he says and that's the
[13:39] thing when he types that even children
[13:42] in the natural choose quick pleasures
[13:45] and what feels good
[13:47] that's in our children they'll choose
[13:50] the the sucker over good food for them
[13:55] they'll choose temporal things they'll
[13:58] choose the the quick pleasure
[14:01] um they'll they'll pull out all the a
[14:03] young baby or child like my
[14:06] granddaughter will pull all the toys out
[14:08] of in the entire room and spread them
[14:11] all over with no thought of the
[14:14] dastardly thing of mom and dad saying go
[14:17] clean it up later they never think about
[14:19] that part
[14:20] they don't think long term they think of
[14:23] the temporal pleasure and they bring it
[14:25] all out and they pull up and they forget
[14:28] they have to clean it up and then you
[14:29] teach them that song clean up clean up
[14:32] clean and you try to get the joy out of
[14:34] cleaning up in them
[14:38] for because they forget and they don't
[14:41] want to work hard and they don't want
[14:43] disciplined teenagers teenagers most
[14:46] mostly don't like the discipline of
[14:48] school they like the fun they like the
[14:51] parties they like to go be with the
[14:53] youth they like to go out to Starbucks
[14:55] and spend all kinds of money there on a
[14:58] drink that should cost 20 cents is eight
[15:01] dollars
[15:03] but it's fun they never think about the
[15:05] budget
[15:07] they want the fun but not work or school
[15:10] and and and they don't see that the
[15:13] teaching and training we give them for
[15:15] school what they learn in school what
[15:16] they learn at church what they learn in
[15:18] the youth meetings what they learn from
[15:19] the pastor and from the parents that's
[15:21] the stuff that's long lasting for life
[15:23] can you say Amen but they don't want
[15:26] those things most of the time they kind
[15:27] of most kids buck up against that and
[15:30] but the fun will be temporal and they
[15:32] haven't learned yet fun will be temporal
[15:34] but there are principles that you get in
[15:36] here that are not just for life but some
[15:38] of them are Eternal principles
[15:42] Eternal principles you know the old
[15:45] saying if you give a man a fish you'll
[15:47] feed him for a day but if you teach them
[15:50] how to fish you'll feed them for a
[15:51] lifetime
[15:53] so but we tend to be people we must not
[15:56] laugh at the children because we tend to
[15:58] be people who look at temporal things
[16:01] and gravitate to temporal things just
[16:04] like the teenagers let's not laugh at
[16:06] the teenagers that's just their age
[16:08] sometimes but we all as adults can stay
[16:10] teenagers spiritually that we live every
[16:13] day on temporal things
[16:15] come on now if you can't say Amen say
[16:18] ouch
[16:20] I want everybody listen I want my
[16:22] teenage boys teenage girls everyone
[16:23] young and old to listen because these
[16:25] are important things we must say God I I
[16:29] love certain things in life but I must
[16:31] connect with you the Eternal God through
[16:33] Jesus Christ the word
[16:35] and nobody else can connect like that
[16:37] nobody else can can bring that to you
[16:40] nobody else can it's you saying Lord I
[16:43] need Christ in my life I need to find
[16:46] the Eternal God I need to eternal life
[16:50] you have to say Lord I need eternal life
[16:54] the Rich Young Ruler has I need eternal
[16:56] life and guess what he had all the
[16:59] blessings coming to him from following
[17:01] the Commandments
[17:02] I did what my mom and dad said I did it
[17:04] I've done all the Commandments Jesus
[17:06] said have you done the commands he said
[17:07] I've done all the Commandments from my
[17:09] youth I don't know and guess what his
[17:11] life was blessed his life was blessed
[17:14] prosperous a lot of money because he
[17:17] followed the principles of God and yet
[17:20] the whole time
[17:22] he's hungry for eternal life
[17:26] so now you have the blessings of
[17:27] following the Commandments and still a
[17:29] yearning for the Eternal on the inside
[17:31] and he came to Jesus he said I've done
[17:33] all these things but he said what do I
[17:34] got to buy how can I get eternal life
[17:36] he's still lacking the person well he's
[17:39] standing in front of the right person
[17:42] your young people you're in front of the
[17:45] right preachers you're in front of the
[17:47] right people they're Christ in flesh
[17:48] presenting eternal life to you every
[17:51] service
[17:52] the rich singers was in front of the
[17:54] right person he was the person of
[17:55] eternal life he could give it right
[17:57] there
[17:58] and he turned it down and you know why
[18:01] nobody can make that decision for you
[18:04] young brother young sister nobody can
[18:07] make that decision for you it's you
[18:09] starting to say I've got a hunger for
[18:11] something more than just doing the
[18:13] Commandments
[18:14] God bless you for doing them thank you
[18:16] for being obedient thank you for not
[18:17] being rebellious God will have certain
[18:19] blessings for you if you how many knows
[18:22] there's a great blessing of even longer
[18:23] days on Earth by honoring and re obeying
[18:25] your parents
[18:27] it's a principle of Life honor obey your
[18:29] parents and you you have long days upon
[18:32] the Earth can you say mine but eternal
[18:34] life and the person of eternal life is
[18:36] something different
[18:38] and the person is presented to you all
[18:40] the time through the preachers I'm
[18:42] standing before you not as just a
[18:44] oversized preacher I present eternal
[18:47] life to you every service but you will
[18:50] not go into eternal life or have it
[18:52] until you accept it for yourself and say
[18:55] I and you'll never accept and say I need
[18:57] this
[18:59] if everybody else fails and my friends
[19:01] in the church go the way of the world I
[19:05] need God I need the eternal life in me
[19:08] can anybody give me an amen this morning
[19:11] every young man every young woman every
[19:13] person no matter how many years you grow
[19:15] up even in the message has to come to
[19:17] that person to say do I have this person
[19:20] of eternal life in my life
[19:23] every person must answer that respond to
[19:25] it
[19:27] so it is spiritual immaturity and so
[19:30] what God does for you temporaril is a
[19:33] wonderful thing but what he puts in you
[19:36] is the Eternal I'm going to say that
[19:37] again what God does for you is temporal
[19:41] what he puts in you is eternal
[19:45] many Christians that puts hopes and
[19:47] things that fade away they tend to fade
[19:50] away themselves
[19:52] many Christians who put their hopes only
[19:54] in things that fade away tend to fade
[19:56] away themselves I got some friends that
[19:58] are not here this morning not in
[20:00] believing the same that they did even
[20:02] out in the world and and you wonder oh
[20:05] God what in the world happened what's
[20:06] going on it's because they put their
[20:08] whole life while they were in the
[20:10] message and going to a message Church
[20:11] they put their whole life
[20:13] swallowed up with temporal things
[20:17] that fade away and they got disappointed
[20:20] too much
[20:21] this life will disappoint you people
[20:23] will disappoint you there's nothing
[20:25] that's trustworthy in this world except
[20:27] the love of God
[20:30] it'll disappoint you all the time this
[20:32] life is full of more disappointments now
[20:34] than I've ever had in my life I can't
[20:36] look to the what I see I have to look at
[20:40] the Unseen that my God will never
[20:42] disappoint me can I get an amen God will
[20:45] never disappoint me
[20:48] it reminds me of a man we stood across
[20:50] from uh brother Barry and I across the
[20:52] in a restaurant across the table and
[20:55] just just laboring in the word and
[20:56] trying to to talk about the word as he
[20:58] was exiting the things that we believe
[21:00] and he went on and on about the troubles
[21:02] and the fanaticism that follow this and
[21:05] everything and I remember the wisdom
[21:07] from Brother Barry that looked him in
[21:08] the eye and said listen all of your
[21:10] troubles all the people that you hurt
[21:12] you all the things that's went on all
[21:14] the fanaticism he said the message is
[21:17] not to blame for your problems the
[21:20] message is not to blame for your
[21:21] problems
[21:23] I thought it was great wisdom
[21:26] be careful who we blame be careful we
[21:29] don't become a victim for life
[21:33] one who's been victimized
[21:35] they have a choice to make whether they
[21:37] can be healed from being victimized
[21:42] or whether they go on with life looking
[21:45] for the next person to victimize them
[21:52] our country is full of victims
[21:58] black people some black people they want
[22:01] reparations they want payback they want
[22:04] money
[22:05] they're considering in California they
[22:07] got they're going to put funds to people
[22:09] from the slavery in our country which is
[22:11] a stain on our country it was bad it was
[22:13] wrong
[22:15] they want payback because now they're
[22:17] the victims
[22:18] they've been victimized you heard our
[22:21] ancestors so no we want to be paid back
[22:22] because they're they're constantly a
[22:25] victim the black people aren't the only
[22:27] ones our country lives with victims that
[22:29] have been victimized
[22:31] but you see now God has a place for us
[22:34] to bring all that to be healed
[22:36] and to to leave it in the past this is
[22:41] the past
[22:42] that's the future
[22:45] our past binds us from the blessings and
[22:49] the positiveness of the future is
[22:52] anybody listening this morning we can't
[22:55] live life in a rear view mirror and
[22:57] looking and trying to drive in a
[22:58] rearview mirror and we look in the back
[23:00] and we have accidents back there and how
[23:02] many has ever went by and you're trying
[23:04] to help me know what a Gawker is
[23:11] we're all done it haven't we and so the
[23:14] traffic's moving very slow because
[23:15] gawkers because an accident happened we
[23:17] want to see who is it what well first of
[23:20] all is it a family or something had
[23:21] happened to our family my wife you know
[23:23] she always calls when she hears the
[23:24] sirens out front or out there she's
[23:26] calling all the kids where are you
[23:30] but we do we drive by an accident oh
[23:34] Lord that happened to him the car is all
[23:35] messed up and they're looking around and
[23:37] it slows the traffic down so we're but
[23:39] sometimes people drive they're not
[23:40] looking where they're going you know
[23:41] there's been incidents where they crash
[23:44] because they're watching another crash
[23:47] does anybody know what I'm preaching
[23:48] this morning
[23:49] and then there's the rear view driving
[23:51] as you're looking oh going going going
[23:58] we laugh
[24:01] but we have many Christians who live
[24:04] their constant Christian Life in the
[24:08] rear view mirror
[24:10] their hearts are locked and stuck
[24:14] and what happened in the past
[24:17] nothing can be viewed right in the
[24:19] future at all because they're they're
[24:21] looking back there
[24:24] at the accidents at the thing oh maybe
[24:27] it's some pretty scenery maybe it's a
[24:28] good thing but most of it is something
[24:30] that happened and you're looking back
[24:31] there trying to constantly drive and we
[24:34] know any decent driver can't do that you
[24:36] can't
[24:37] properly be alert for the future of
[24:40] where you're going when you're looking
[24:42] in the past Paul deals with it in
[24:44] Philippians when he says forget those
[24:47] things which are behind
[24:48] pressed toward the mark of the high
[24:50] calling in Christ
[24:52] and the only way you can press toward
[24:54] the mark of what God has for you in the
[24:56] future is that if you forget all of your
[25:00] past
[25:02] how do I do that brother Paul first of
[25:04] all you ask forgiveness for what you've
[25:07] done wrong
[25:08] and you bring it under the blood of
[25:10] Jesus Christ no matter how dastardly it
[25:12] was some of you have done some pretty
[25:14] dastardly things
[25:17] but you could ask God forgiveness and
[25:18] still not get past it God could forgive
[25:21] it and you haven't forgiven your past
[25:25] and you haven't forgiven yourself
[25:31] God's forgiven it because you sincerely
[25:34] ask but but you haven't forgiven
[25:36] yourself
[25:38] so you're still living back there with
[25:40] it hanging on you and Paul so you you
[25:42] may even forgive yourself but you don't
[25:44] forget and Paul gives us permission
[25:46] forget
[25:48] now I know how our brain works because
[25:50] Satan has access to our brain and he's
[25:53] going to bring up our past to defeat us
[25:55] but you can quickly dump that out wait a
[25:58] minute that's under the bud
[26:00] wait what are you doing
[26:02] I don't have to think about that anymore
[26:04] that's under the blood
[26:05] but most the time we
[26:07] we linger and it comes back and then we
[26:10] get angry and then can you imagine
[26:13] somebody's just dwelling on something
[26:14] that something was done dastardly to you
[26:16] you're dwelling on it and dwelling on it
[26:18] and then then you how many has ever got
[26:22] angry at your kids or angry at somebody
[26:25] in the house
[26:26] and you realize later you got to
[26:28] apologize because you weren't really
[26:29] angry at what they're doing you were
[26:31] just irritated at everything they're
[26:32] doing
[26:33] because you're mad at something from the
[26:35] past or something somebody else did to
[26:37] you
[26:38] people are smiling right now
[26:42] and you're taking it out on the kids
[26:43] you're taking it out in your wife you're
[26:46] taking it out on your husband
[26:47] it's nothing worse than living with
[26:49] somebody who a mate that lives
[26:51] constantly in the bitterness of the past
[26:55] because husbands get a lot taken out on
[26:57] them
[26:58] wives get a lot taken out on them
[27:01] even worse than it's rough it's like sit
[27:04] down this is under the blood forgive God
[27:07] forgives us forgive ourselves accept
[27:10] God's pardon accept his forgiveness and
[27:13] then forget it let's forget it and move
[27:16] on
[27:17] and then we forgive ourselves for what
[27:19] we've done wrong
[27:20] and then we forgive others who have done
[27:23] us wrong
[27:27] you can't have faith
[27:30] unless you forgive
[27:35] Jesus said that a Son of God has faith
[27:38] that if you say to this mountain be
[27:40] removed and cast in the say See it'll be
[27:43] done that's the kind of Faith that's in
[27:45] the potential of the son and daughter of
[27:47] God you can move mountains
[27:50] the next verse says and when you pray
[27:52] that you want to pray a prayer of faith
[27:54] when you stand praying
[27:56] forgive
[27:59] and in perfect Faith the prophet's first
[28:01] comment as he reads the scripture first
[28:04] comment before he goes into this great
[28:05] subject of perfect Faith he said now you
[28:08] can see faith is based on forgiveness
[28:14] how many you want more faith
[28:16] those other scriptures Faith cometh by
[28:18] hearing hearing by the word of God it's
[28:19] good to stay in the word of God that's
[28:21] that builds it as well Faith cometh by
[28:23] testimonies people give them testimonies
[28:25] that raises our faith my God can cancer
[28:27] God can raise the dead and there's some
[28:29] Faith preachers that tell testimonies
[28:31] and we rise in our faith to believe
[28:32] anything's possible God can use those
[28:34] things but if you had all of that and
[28:36] you had an unforgiving Spirit you cannot
[28:39] come into perfect faith without
[28:41] forgiveness you can't grow you can't go
[28:44] beyond it can you say Amen
[28:47] you lack and if you really say I want
[28:49] faith I want faith I'm a teenager I want
[28:51] more faith that I can move mountains
[28:53] that I can do exploits and I can do
[28:55] better things that I could that I could
[28:57] live a closer life to the Lord without
[28:59] forgiveness you can't move into greater
[29:01] Faith forgiveness is the power that
[29:04] comes in our lives to release the past
[29:07] and relief things so that you can be
[29:09] locked in the past not blocked and
[29:12] locked here in the past but it releases
[29:14] you from the past and now you can pursue
[29:16] reconciliation and the future and what's
[29:19] next for you you can't go there without
[29:22] true forgiveness and releasing it and
[29:26] washing it away
[29:28] and there are some situations in my life
[29:30] that the person hasn't even asked for
[29:33] forgiveness but I can forgive them and
[29:36] release it it's released in Jesus name I
[29:39] will not let it bind me anymore
[29:46] I'm not angry at you I'm angry at the
[29:48] Devil
[29:49] because I have some in my congregation
[29:51] they're just locked up and they've been
[29:52] locked up for years it's because they
[29:54] live in the rearview mirror
[29:56] and everything sometimes even I'm saying
[29:58] here gets comes to the filter of their
[30:00] past
[30:02] what a tragedy I love you enough to tell
[30:04] you that until you forgive and let God
[30:07] forgive you and forgive others
[30:10] can't have more faith
[30:15] you might not even feel worthy that you
[30:17] can move mountains I'm not on that level
[30:19] at all what God's word says you are
[30:22] God's word says you are
[30:25] you can't get there you can't build
[30:26] faith if you live in the past you can't
[30:28] get there with an unforgiving spirit
[30:30] people limit this forgiveness thing in
[30:33] the the make it mechanical and they make
[30:36] it complicated and we got to figure it
[30:38] all out and God never asks us to do that
[30:40] there's a flood of his blood and his
[30:43] forgiveness flowing from Calvary and it
[30:46] flows right down to his sons and
[30:48] daughters right into their soul and when
[30:50] it floods through us then it spreads and
[30:53] we release it to everyone in our lives
[30:56] don't explain it don't try to complicate
[31:00] it I forgive and I release it in Jesus
[31:04] name because I want to go on with the
[31:06] Lord somebody say praise the Lord this
[31:08] morning
[31:10] from the temporal from the temporal that
[31:13] see that's the past the past is the
[31:15] temporal but he said we're looking to
[31:16] the Eternal can you say man
[31:18] and sons of God need to move from
[31:21] temporal things to Eternal things
[31:26] many Christians put their hopes and
[31:28] things that fade away
[31:30] but a truly born-again
[31:31] person
[31:34] uh can start fading out because they're
[31:36] putting in trust in temporal things
[31:39] this isn't the Holy Ghost is not a
[31:41] temporal feeling
[31:43] that last until Monday afternoon the
[31:45] Bible says it's a seal
[31:47] until the day of redemption
[31:52] we can make the Holy Ghost so temporal
[31:54] but you see it's a seal
[31:56] and it doesn't last to the next
[31:58] special meeting
[32:02] come on let's grow up friends
[32:04] who if I could just make it from last
[32:06] year it was such a blessing oh I felt
[32:08] the pouring out of the spirit of God but
[32:10] I said well I've got to make it to March
[32:12] to our special meetings that's temporal
[32:15] how about if we worshiped now
[32:19] how about if we didn't live on special
[32:21] meetings how about in our homes sisters
[32:24] when you're washing the dishes and
[32:25] you're listening to that profit or
[32:28] listening to the word and something
[32:30] strikes your heart and nobody is around
[32:31] to say God I just I've got a reason to
[32:34] praise the Lord right now and you have
[32:36] your own kitchen revival can you say
[32:38] Amen how about if we didn't depend on
[32:41] temporal cat meetings but we're
[32:43] worshiping and serving him with fervor
[32:45] and passion and love in our hearts every
[32:47] day of the week
[32:51] hallelujah it's Eternal it's a seal can
[32:54] you say Amen in fact it's a connection
[32:56] with the eternal life the Holy Ghost is
[32:58] eternal life that comes in us it is
[33:01] eternal life
[33:03] but see now let me just elaborate just a
[33:05] little bit this morning even good things
[33:07] of this life will pass do you know that
[33:09] even good things that we have here
[33:12] they'll pass because this that's a
[33:14] different life
[33:15] we know bad things pass and Fade Away we
[33:18] know that but the let me say it this way
[33:20] and this may surprise you I don't know
[33:22] but the very best things that this life
[33:24] can offer is still temporal
[33:30] is that true
[33:31] the very best that this life could offer
[33:33] is still temporal
[33:36] we must receive the person of eternal
[33:38] life we must live looking beyond what we
[33:41] see why first why why do we look beyond
[33:44] what we see and not be caught up in the
[33:47] temporal things of the world well
[33:48] because number one this world is
[33:51] scheduled
[33:52] for Destruction
[33:56] it's on the schedule
[33:59] judgment and destruction are coming
[34:02] and fire is coming
[34:04] and brother Mike Wallace last weekend
[34:06] said that God gave a covenant which is
[34:08] the most powerful thing he can give his
[34:10] people but one of the things when he
[34:12] destroyed this Earth with water one of
[34:13] the reasons two things we look at when
[34:16] we look at a rainbow is that we knew we
[34:18] know not by reading the Bible but we
[34:20] know that he destroyed the Earth by
[34:22] water because he gave this rainbow for
[34:24] the first time so we can look at a
[34:26] rainbow how many's ever seen a rainbow
[34:29] we can look at that and see two things
[34:30] when God said it was going to rain to
[34:32] Noah it did and destroyed the Earth by
[34:35] water it happened even science proves
[34:38] that the whole earth was covered with
[34:40] water
[34:42] but the other thing we see in the
[34:43] rainbow is the grace of God because he
[34:46] said when you see that rainbow I'll
[34:48] never destroy the Earth again with water
[34:49] that's his promise he made it and he's
[34:52] never done it again and he never will do
[34:54] it
[34:55] because God keeps his promises well we
[34:58] got a lot another little prophecy in
[35:00] there says I will destroy the Earth with
[35:01] fire now if he did it with water then if
[35:04] he did it that time he's going to do it
[35:06] again this Earth don't get caught up in
[35:08] this earth and the businesses and
[35:10] everything else and that's your whole
[35:11] thing because it's all going to be gone
[35:14] someday this Earth is fitted for
[35:16] Destruction if you get your mind too
[35:19] caught up in what you're doing in
[35:20] business and not an eternal perspective
[35:23] then you'll be caught in this thing and
[35:25] worried about this all the time and down
[35:27] by this all the time you have to
[35:28] remember this is all going to fade
[35:30] someday it's all going to be gone
[35:32] someday I was sitting in my living room
[35:34] last night and able to study in my
[35:36] living room because my granddaughter
[35:37] wasn't there and my two kids weren't
[35:39] there and the house was empty we got a
[35:40] little feel what it was empty nest gobby
[35:43] and getting are gone because gobby
[35:44] getting have all their friends there
[35:46] Saturday you know usually and so it's
[35:48] anyway it was quiet in the house praise
[35:52] be to God
[35:56] but I was sitting in the living room
[35:57] brother John and I was looking around at
[36:00] this living room some of you been to my
[36:02] house and I'm looking at the woodwork
[36:03] and I'm looking at this and I'm looking
[36:05] at the scenery outside and I'm looking
[36:07] at the beautiful birds come and I'm
[36:09] looking at all that God I wouldn't ever
[36:11] dream that God would give this boy these
[36:15] nice things would have never dreamed I
[36:17] thank God for every time I every time I
[36:19] walk in this church I'm awed by what God
[36:21] has given us I never take it for granted
[36:23] I would have never dreamed we had
[36:24] something this nice
[36:26] I'm a blessed boy this is a blessed
[36:28] church I'm sitting there looking all
[36:29] around it I got the I got the truck that
[36:32] I want I've got the piano that I've
[36:34] always wanted I said God how did I ever
[36:36] get that out
[36:37] but then the next talking but I'm
[36:39] studying here for tomorrow and I'm
[36:42] saying God please
[36:43] I'm laboring there's something more
[36:46] precious than any of this these are
[36:48] these precious lives and Families
[36:51] that somehow you you allowed for me to
[36:54] speak to eternal life
[36:56] and I realize I know deep within here
[36:59] I could leave this service and go home
[37:01] and not know about it and that could all
[37:04] be burnt to the ground
[37:08] you too
[37:11] my truck the house you too you could go
[37:15] back home and get and drive up and it's
[37:18] all to the ground completely leveled
[37:20] it's gone and if that happened to me
[37:22] today and I go five minutes down the
[37:24] road and my wife she calls me you better
[37:26] get home she's crying I'm gonna shed a
[37:29] few tears but I can tell you this
[37:30] there's something deeper in me I ain't
[37:32] gonna cry for very long because I'm
[37:34] about what's Eternal not what's the
[37:35] temporal and I'm not boasting I'm just
[37:37] saying that's within me when I sat there
[37:39] and looked I said God I appreciate this
[37:41] so much but if I know someday this is
[37:44] all going to be gone this all Burns this
[37:47] is going to be finished if I go in the
[37:49] Rapture I'm going to leave it to someone
[37:51] else that comes and where did he go I
[37:53] don't know well we'll put it up on the
[37:55] market we'll sell it and I guess
[37:56] somebody else and they can go on all
[37:58] they want to with that house I don't
[38:00] care about it laboring in the word and
[38:02] crying all night and praying for your
[38:04] family's lives that's what's eternal
[38:11] that's the love of God that's what
[38:13] counts in this life can you say Amen
[38:16] that's I love you I love Cosby I never
[38:19] do this unless there was a love that
[38:20] come through me to you just labor find
[38:22] the Eternal thing for them find the
[38:24] Eternal thing for those people
[38:27] not the temporal things but find the
[38:30] Eternal things
[38:31] give your heart to them give your heart
[38:33] to something while we look at the things
[38:34] that are unseen because the things that
[38:36] are unseen are temporal what God does
[38:39] through me to you today is eternal
[38:42] things if you'll receive it it's an
[38:44] eternal thing
[38:49] praise the Lord
[38:53] it's eternal
[38:54] this is what counts can you say Amen if
[38:57] it all fades away
[38:59] this Earth is fitted for Destruction
[39:01] first Peter 3 10.
[39:03] but the day of the Lord will come as a
[39:05] thief in the night in the which the
[39:07] heaven shall pass away with great noise
[39:08] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[39:10] Heat
[39:12] the Earth also on the works that are
[39:14] therein shall be burned up the prophet
[39:16] makes a comment it says the Earth will
[39:18] be swallowed up with fire with him but
[39:19] the works are in which means the
[39:21] atmospheres will will be burnt as well
[39:23] all the evil demonic atmospheres will be
[39:26] burnt by the Holy Fire of God never be
[39:28] around again
[39:30] seeing then
[39:31] I don't know if you have got that guys I
[39:33] wanted the people to see it first Peter
[39:35] chapter 3 and verse 10.
[39:37] it'll melt with fervent heat it's
[39:39] prophesied this this world is scheduled
[39:42] for destruction of fire
[39:43] why are you saying that to us just in
[39:45] case you didn't know
[39:47] your job your house everything you see
[39:50] here even this church
[39:52] will come under that fire
[39:58] and he says this will be burnt up and
[39:59] then he comes to verse 11 and says
[40:01] seeing then that all these things shall
[40:04] be dissolved all things will be
[40:07] dissolved that pretty much covers
[40:10] you know
[40:12] if we know that they'll be dissolved
[40:14] what manner of persons are e to be in
[40:17] all holy conversation and godliness how
[40:21] should we be living Bound by the
[40:24] depression of temporal things of people
[40:27] of our past of our trials
[40:31] is that how we should live no we live
[40:34] with our eyes on the eternal
[40:37] now don't get me wrong you have to use
[40:39] your brain God gave it to you and you
[40:41] pray but you still pray say God lead me
[40:43] in business and lead me to do what I
[40:44] need to do what do I need to do for my
[40:46] career even you young people I'm praying
[40:48] about my career you better bring God in
[40:50] that career and say God what's the
[40:52] career for me that I can serve you the
[40:54] best
[40:55] how can I do Eternal things through my
[40:58] career
[41:00] but these days we teach our kids it's
[41:02] all about that the carnal the you know
[41:05] it's like this life this life we can't
[41:07] just have that perspective
[41:13] seeing then all these things about what
[41:15] matter here's some more here's a couple
[41:16] more let you know the Earth is verse
[41:18] John 2 17 first John 2 17 and the world
[41:22] passeth away and the lust thereof but he
[41:26] that doeth the will of God abideth
[41:29] forever the world passeth away so you
[41:32] want to look at things that fade away
[41:33] the world's going to pass away young
[41:36] people you want to be caught up in the
[41:37] things of the world on social media and
[41:39] caught up in what they're doing
[41:40] news flash it's going to pass away
[41:43] someday
[41:45] and the lust will pass away someday but
[41:47] he that doeth the will of God abideth
[41:49] forever and then and they here's another
[41:51] one of First Corinthians 7 31. First
[41:53] Corinthians 7 31.
[41:56] just just for the people who are caught
[41:58] up in the Fashions of this world sisters
[42:00] sometimes too caught up in the van and
[42:02] they that use this world not as not
[42:04] abusing it for the fashion of this world
[42:07] passive away
[42:11] you're gonna jump onto that little
[42:13] fashion I'm gonna do that push the
[42:15] envelope I'm gonna wear this and okay I
[42:19] better stop
[42:22] it's not about just what you wear set
[42:24] you're caught up and watching the
[42:26] magazines and watching whether it's it
[42:28] so you're gonna just integrate that
[42:29] because you get if you get if you get
[42:31] caught up in the fashion of the world
[42:34] I want to let you young girls know any
[42:36] sisters it's gonna all pass away someday
[42:40] it's not a good thing to get caught up
[42:42] in
[42:43] the prophet says in 1960 this is a great
[42:45] quote
[42:46] and here's a window into things I said
[42:49] hatred had a beginning
[42:52] so it has to have an end
[42:54] love had no beginning so it has no end
[43:01] hatred is forever love is eternal hatred
[43:04] begins and hatred will end love never
[43:08] did begin it never will end you see it
[43:10] was eternal and When a Man Loves a Woman
[43:13] now here he goes to our marriages
[43:14] Brothers When a Man Loves a Woman and
[43:17] marries her because she's just pretty
[43:19] there'll be an end to that
[43:22] you young boys that's going to choose a
[43:24] wife he's teaching us that even when you
[43:27] choose a wife there has to be an eternal
[43:30] Divine love for that woman
[43:33] because if you're attracted only to the
[43:35] beauty and there's nothing wrong with
[43:37] being attracted to the beauty God made
[43:39] you that way I married the most
[43:41] beautiful woman in the world I'm still
[43:43] married to her
[43:45] of course
[43:48] there's a natural attraction you have to
[43:50] marry the most beautiful woman but I
[43:51] want to let you know if that's the only
[43:52] reason you do it if you only married
[43:54] because she's beautiful if you only
[43:56] married to have sexual relations with
[43:58] her that all fades
[44:00] that all fades
[44:02] but when you have a Divine love for that
[44:04] woman when all that Fades away and all
[44:06] that's done there's still something look
[44:08] how he says I'll let him say it he says
[44:10] and When a Man Loves a Woman and marries
[44:11] her because she's just pretty they'll be
[44:13] an end to that but when a man finds a
[44:14] woman that he loves he don't know why
[44:16] but he loves her
[44:18] and she finds a man that she loves no
[44:20] matter what he looks like see that's
[44:22] turned around the other way no matter
[44:23] what that guy looks it's not about what
[44:25] the guy looks like right
[44:27] it's not supposed to be anyway
[44:29] I mean he's you want a handsome guy I
[44:31] understand that but Love Goes deeper
[44:35] than that because he definitely ain't
[44:37] gonna look like he did before you were
[44:38] married
[44:41] I mean
[44:42] there's certain characteristics that are
[44:44] just going to push out
[44:52] she finds a man she loves no matter what
[44:54] he looks like he loves her she loves him
[44:56] that's an eternal mate in glory he's
[45:00] taken our marriages and tying it to the
[45:03] Eternal why because if it's the right
[45:05] love it's tied the Eternal it doesn't
[45:07] matter all that happens down here if
[45:09] you've got that love you'll tie back to
[45:11] that eternal
[45:15] that's why there's so much divorce
[45:16] that's why is there separation that's
[45:18] why the devil attacks marriages with
[45:19] pornography and all the other things
[45:21] because he works on the temporal I'm
[45:22] going to split this up but when there is
[45:24] a love there then you'll come back to
[45:27] that love it is eternal this is who I'll
[45:29] be with in the Millennium I want to be
[45:32] with them in the Millennium no matter
[45:33] what has happened here
[45:36] death nor nothing else can ever separate
[45:38] them because they are from eternity and
[45:40] they stepped out in the space of time
[45:41] and will return back to Eternity
[45:44] eternity look with this now they stepped
[45:46] they got married death death nor nothing
[45:49] that's what we say in the marriage vow
[45:52] did you remember you said that in your
[45:54] marriage vow
[45:56] you know I'll be stay with him in
[45:59] sickness and in health
[46:02] and this I don't even know all of them
[46:04] you said that in your marriage vow don't
[46:07] forget
[46:08] sickness Health what's the other ones
[46:12] better for worse fat skinny I think it's
[46:15] all in there
[46:17] pledge you my trough
[46:20] nobody knows what that means
[46:24] pledging my trough
[46:27] I don't know what it meant but I pledged
[46:29] it
[46:31] still got it
[46:33] it's probably up in the attic I don't
[46:34] know I don't know what the trough is
[46:40] I pledged it I don't know what it was
[46:41] but I pledged it
[46:43] and they stepped out in this space of
[46:45] time
[46:46] so listen now
[46:49] marriage
[46:51] God's seen you before the foundation of
[46:53] the world with somebody
[47:02] then he says sometimes if you don't get
[47:04] that right one here you'll have the
[47:06] right one over there
[47:08] but if you're serving the lord then you
[47:10] fight you find the right one over here
[47:12] something in eternity happened before
[47:14] you met each other and come together in
[47:16] life so now if that is there if that
[47:19] love is there then you were there in
[47:22] God's mind and then you stepped into
[47:24] time and got married
[47:28] and then a lot of pressures come in life
[47:30] and a lot of things happen and a lot of
[47:33] dastardly things and a lot of rough
[47:35] things because why you're in time
[47:39] and time's going to challenge that love
[47:43] but if it was before you step into time
[47:46] you were up here in eternity and you
[47:49] stepped down into time but if that
[47:52] eternal love is there you when your time
[47:54] is over you step back into eternity
[47:56] again standing beside one another
[48:03] I can't help but think when we got that
[48:04] perspective it brings such a strong bond
[48:08] and love in a husband and wife
[48:11] that nothing no devil can separate them
[48:14] or fighting for this thing we're not
[48:17] letting the devil when that love is
[48:19] overwhelming
[48:21] it brings all these things to say we're
[48:23] so bonded there ain't anybody
[48:26] that'll separate us from the love of God
[48:31] I'm way off my notes today but I'm
[48:36] I believe the Lord wanted me to say
[48:37] these things
[48:40] they stepped out in the space of time
[48:42] we'll return back to Eternity eternity
[48:43] has dropped down in a body called time
[48:45] then goes back up into eternity again it
[48:47] cannot perish and a woman that's
[48:49] beautiful that beauty will fade just as
[48:51] sure you give it a few years maybe today
[48:53] she's twisting around the street some
[48:55] little half-dressed woman sending more
[48:56] souls to Hell than all the borrowings in
[48:58] the country but she'll twist herself
[49:00] down the street thinking she's something
[49:01] and the Bible says they'd have stretched
[49:03] out next and wanted mincing that's the
[49:05] high heels in the Bible if you didn't
[49:07] know they were in there she minces that
[49:09] she she walks a certain way because
[49:10] she's got the highs heels on one there's
[49:13] all this in the Bible that means
[49:14] twisting and they go and in the last day
[49:17] fulfilling the scriptures and doesn't
[49:18] know it they stand in the yard with
[49:20] immoral clothes on men looking at her
[49:22] and don't know she may be as virtuous to
[49:24] her husband or boyfriend as she can be
[49:25] but at the day of Judges she'll answer
[49:27] for committing adultery with hundreds of
[49:29] men
[49:32] you don't get a lot of amens on that
[49:33] anymore but it's still the truth
[49:36] a spirit on them and they don't know the
[49:38] Bible said naked blind and don't know
[49:40] what the miserable part is they don't
[49:42] know it
[49:43] that's why I have Grace for people
[49:44] because if they don't know this truth a
[49:46] woman doesn't know what modesty is then
[49:48] you have Grace and share truth with them
[49:51] my problem is people who know these
[49:53] things and and don't follow
[49:56] I have Grace for them too though
[49:58] but did you know that well-formed little
[50:00] figure that God has given that girl
[50:03] wow
[50:05] that well-formed little figure that God
[50:08] has given that girl because God Made You
[50:10] you're fearfully and wonderful remain he
[50:12] made you give you the vessel you had
[50:14] most of us didn't get the vessel we
[50:15] wanted but God formed it we would have
[50:18] chosen to look different you know
[50:21] I wish I looked a little bit more like
[50:23] Tom Cruise
[50:26] and I won't tell you why
[50:28] but did you know that well-formed little
[50:30] figure that God has given that girl that
[50:31] may be rotten by this time next Sunday
[50:37] if there was an accident and she died
[50:38] and that well-formed body
[50:40] that all the men looked at and she may
[50:43] be using it for the wrong reason
[50:44] bringing the skirt up and put the tight
[50:47] skirt on and
[50:49] Bringing Down the thing to show a little
[50:51] bit of the breast
[50:52] and
[50:53] she did a little bit so but but you see
[50:55] now she's using that
[50:58] and she could have an accident and it's
[50:59] rotting in the grave a week later
[51:03] he's trying to teach us we can't put our
[51:05] trust in these things
[51:08] they're temporal
[51:10] how many hours we spend in front of the
[51:12] mirror
[51:14] and how many hours do we spend in our
[51:16] Bible
[51:20] I'm in trouble anyway so I might as well
[51:22] keep going
[51:25] how much time did you spend prepping
[51:27] yourself
[51:28] in your looks this morning and how much
[51:30] time did you spend
[51:32] praying for the preacher
[51:34] and in the word
[51:36] how late did you stay up and watch a
[51:37] movie last night
[51:39] when you could have been saying Lord I'm
[51:41] going to spend some time in prayer for
[51:43] the service today
[51:48] you say is this convicting to you it's
[51:50] convicting to me because if we live by
[51:53] our carnal Minds we choose the temporal
[51:57] gratification all the time
[52:00] but there are things that have eternal
[52:02] Merit
[52:06] we got to grow up and start choosing
[52:09] the things of Eternity
[52:12] the things that are important
[52:15] did you know the well-formed little
[52:17] figure God's given or maybe rotten by
[52:18] the next Sunday that that tall dark and
[52:20] handsome
[52:22] man maybe no nothing but just a pile of
[52:24] rubbish by next Sunday that all perishes
[52:27] but that all on the inside God love
[52:29] lives for Eternal so it's how I want I
[52:32] want to see how he ends it so watch the
[52:35] inside keep your eyes on the goal
[52:39] amen I say Amen
[52:42] it's teaching us it's this these things
[52:45] the message is not to hurt us it's to
[52:48] teach us to look to Eternal things
[52:54] it's a connection
[52:56] people are speaking so bad against the
[52:59] message and people have put a
[53:01] taintedness in their mind about it but
[53:03] it's what God sent us to teach us
[53:06] to get our eyes on the Eternal things
[53:12] it's to help us not have eternal focus
[53:14] in life especially Christians
[53:17] young men and young women in choosing a
[53:20] wife in money in life in choosing a
[53:23] career in relationships
[53:26] in how we spend so much time on our
[53:28] looks and not our soul
[53:30] the Bible says this life is a Mist it's
[53:32] a vapor
[53:34] if I had a a hairspray can here this
[53:36] morning that's what the scripture speaks
[53:39] about if I sprayed that a Mist would
[53:42] come out
[53:44] and a vapor would come out and you'd see
[53:46] sometimes you see it and then and then
[53:49] within seconds it all fades away that's
[53:51] what the Bible describes as your life
[53:54] our life is a vapor it's a mist
[53:59] why would you put confidence in
[54:01] something that's just a vapor that will
[54:02] pass away
[54:07] but what we will lay up on the other
[54:09] side what will we lay up on the other
[54:11] side if we get caught up in these things
[54:14] you ever think about will he say Well
[54:15] done to me young man
[54:18] young man
[54:20] it's going to be not about your dad and
[54:22] mom anymore someday
[54:28] when you step into the other dimension
[54:30] will he say Well done
[54:33] or will he turn us away
[54:36] these are realities that a preacher has
[54:38] to speak about because the Bible says is
[54:39] that if if you say I'm going to live to
[54:42] 60 70. you don't know young man
[54:44] 14 years old you don't know you're going
[54:46] to live till 70 years old
[54:49] you can get your license and have an
[54:50] accident and that the end of your days
[54:52] because God chooses how many days we
[54:53] have you could be done
[54:57] and then when you step into that and
[54:59] that accident happens and I'm praying
[55:01] none of this happens I'm not trying to
[55:03] pronounce Doom I'm talking about the
[55:04] reality you have no guarantee that
[55:06] you're going to live next year
[55:08] and when you quickly go and you pass
[55:10] away and you give your last breath in
[55:12] that car or I'll watch my dad give his
[55:14] last breath the question you need to ask
[55:17] yourself is that when you step into that
[55:19] will it be well done from Christ or will
[55:22] it be depart from me I never knew you
[55:26] and now you can wiggle with that there's
[55:28] a lot of versions of Heaven I did good
[55:30] works and I did things and I did I was a
[55:32] good boy the Rich Young Ruler was a good
[55:34] boy and he lifted up his eyes in hell
[55:40] you have to ask yourself a question if I
[55:42] were to pass right now right now what
[55:45] would I hear
[55:47] there's only two places you'd go to the
[55:49] dimensions of the Lost quickly
[55:52] Within half a second or less a moment or
[55:57] you step into something that we've heard
[55:59] people go into it and they're smiling in
[56:01] their face in their deathbed in the
[56:03] hospital
[56:06] I know where my dad went
[56:09] because in his life at about 14 years
[56:11] old he was connected with eternal life
[56:14] at 14. serve the Lord the rest of his
[56:18] life I know where he went he stepped
[56:19] into the angels and the saints of God he
[56:22] stepped into it
[56:26] Margaret I know where your husband
[56:28] stepped into
[56:30] I can see by their life I know where he
[56:33] stepped into
[56:36] Amanda I know where your dad stepped
[56:38] into
[56:39] there's not a doubt in my mind
[56:43] but I'm not though they're gone I'm
[56:45] asking our young people and I'm asking
[56:47] every one of you do you know when that
[56:50] moment happens whether it's tonight or
[56:53] 10 years from now where will you step
[56:55] into because my Bible says that's a
[56:58] reality for everybody sitting here
[57:00] no matter how good they are
[57:04] where you spend eternity where will you
[57:07] spend I shouldn't say where you spend
[57:08] eternity because there's no eternal hell
[57:09] but where where will that transition be
[57:13] every person has got to ask themselves
[57:15] that question
[57:18] and when you choose a life about career
[57:20] and relationships and a wife
[57:22] this life is a vapor
[57:26] he said to a people he's going to say to
[57:28] a group of people who cast out Devils
[57:30] who healed the sick
[57:34] apart from me I never knew you
[57:37] young man where do you stand if you were
[57:39] to die this week
[57:42] our Focus must not be all carried away
[57:44] with here we must look to the Unseen
[57:55] I'm feeling really LED in my spirit to
[57:57] bring this to a close right now
[58:01] I have just a small section here about
[58:03] parents parents must have an eternal
[58:04] focus when they're raising their
[58:06] children
[58:08] you must connect them with atmospheres
[58:10] that guide their soul to eternal life
[58:13] when they're little when they're little
[58:15] babies if you let them watch all the
[58:17] cartoons and all the new kids stuff and
[58:20] it has no teaching of Jesus or none of
[58:21] the word of God
[58:23] you don't have a long-term Eternal Focus
[58:25] for your kids
[58:28] and as they get older as teenagers if
[58:29] you're only seeking them to be
[58:31] successful in this world
[58:32] and not teaching him that it's all
[58:34] temporary you do a disservice to them
[58:38] my greatest thrill
[58:40] was not when my boys finished their
[58:42] college in December both of them this
[58:44] last December I was thrilled I took a
[58:47] lot of pictures
[58:49] I hate to admit this but I I kissed
[58:51] their degree that was in their hand I
[58:53] kissed it
[58:58] so happy you know I was really happy
[59:00] not because I didn't think they could
[59:02] finish it
[59:03] but I was happy to be done with all
[59:05] those College bills
[59:15] that's that wasn't my greatest thrill
[59:20] ER it was been my sons and daughters
[59:22] would call me from camp
[59:29] foreign
[59:32] and God without me
[59:35] had connected with them
[59:39] one of my sons called me said Dad
[59:43] nothing's happened Dad you don't
[59:45] understand
[59:46] something
[59:48] that was baptized
[59:50] dad I got baptized something something
[59:52] when I was 16 years old that happened I
[59:55] connected with the Eternal and it wasn't
[59:57] about my parents anymore it wasn't about
[59:59] what they taught me I appreciated it but
[1:00:01] God contacted me and I accepted it
[1:00:07] that was my greatest thrill in life for
[1:00:10] my children
[1:00:11] can you imagine and taking them to the
[1:00:13] airport Friday morning and he's going
[1:00:15] off to to serve in the kingdom of God
[1:00:18] I never produced that but all I can say
[1:00:21] is thank you God and parents need an
[1:00:24] eternal perspective for their children
[1:00:33] my boys were good at sports
[1:00:37] so you're not going there I'm going
[1:00:38] there
[1:00:39] my go my boys could have went on to a
[1:00:41] lot of sports I do believe that runs in
[1:00:44] the genes in our family
[1:00:47] baseball
[1:00:49] but they were involved in football they
[1:00:51] did excellent
[1:00:53] and I just tell you I don't want to make
[1:00:55] anybody angry here because I know
[1:00:56] there's a lot of different views on it
[1:00:59] they played they played they played when
[1:01:01] that coach would say our our practices
[1:01:04] are Wednesday nights
[1:01:06] we say we're sorry
[1:01:08] and our boys heard us tell them that
[1:01:11] and somehow they survived those mean
[1:01:14] parents
[1:01:15] that said we won't be there
[1:01:17] I had numerous coaches because they were
[1:01:19] so good switch it from Wednesday night
[1:01:21] to Thursday night
[1:01:26] I'm teaching my kids priorities I'm
[1:01:28] teaching them the Eternal things are
[1:01:30] more important than temporal things
[1:01:32] please don't get offended at me I'm a
[1:01:34] pastor this is what I'm supposed to do
[1:01:40] there's priorities
[1:01:42] they can enjoy all these things in life
[1:01:44] can you say Amen
[1:01:46] and then later they as they got better
[1:01:47] and things then we make decisions and
[1:01:49] right at that time in my life I had a a
[1:01:51] man in this message that was ready to go
[1:01:54] to the NFL he was chosen headed to the
[1:01:56] NFL and another guy that was going to
[1:01:58] play for the Cincinnati Reds he was
[1:02:00] actually already on the team
[1:02:01] and these are brothers that believe this
[1:02:03] word and they have families now they've
[1:02:05] grown up but they both told me in
[1:02:07] testimony that once they got into the
[1:02:10] atmospheres of the NFL and professional
[1:02:12] baseball once they got there
[1:02:15] they just realized
[1:02:18] and one of them was before they even
[1:02:20] came to the Lord
[1:02:21] but but they were coming to the Lord and
[1:02:24] with God what God was doing in them and
[1:02:26] those atmospheres now if someone does
[1:02:28] that you know
[1:02:29] I'm not be critical of them praise the
[1:02:32] Lord but they said when they were in
[1:02:34] those atmospheres nobody knows what kind
[1:02:36] of atmospheres those are and they felt
[1:02:39] like it'd be very difficult
[1:02:41] for a Christian
[1:02:43] to be in that and they said they turned
[1:02:45] down the contract
[1:02:47] both brothers turned down the contract
[1:02:50] and from what I understand both of them
[1:02:52] are blessed in business today and
[1:02:54] blessed in what they're doing
[1:03:01] yeah
[1:03:04] and so
[1:03:06] no you know we're not going to do it
[1:03:08] this way we're not going to direct you
[1:03:10] this way because there has to be with
[1:03:12] all the things like there has to be an
[1:03:14] eternal element in parents to teach them
[1:03:18] that this life Fades this life will be
[1:03:20] over money will fade careers will fade
[1:03:23] all the money we can make will be gone
[1:03:25] we can't take it with us
[1:03:27] but there is a there is an atmosphere
[1:03:29] there is a a place
[1:03:33] there's a connection
[1:03:36] and if we expose ourselves and keep
[1:03:38] exposing ourselves to that Melchizedek
[1:03:41] can connect with us
[1:03:43] connect with our children
[1:03:47] and how important is it it's everything
[1:03:51] it's everything
[1:03:59] yeah
[1:04:00] so
[1:04:02] there was opportunities that come up
[1:04:07] there was opportunities for me in music
[1:04:09] there were some opportunities that came
[1:04:10] up
[1:04:11] and I just hit that spot in my life I
[1:04:13] just I connected with God and I just
[1:04:16] said this is a great opportunity but
[1:04:18] which direction I had to pray and say
[1:04:20] God is this direction you want me to
[1:04:21] take I was in an atmosphere and
[1:04:23] musically in a group and
[1:04:25] it was a good group and it was a good
[1:04:28] start for me and they asked me to join
[1:04:29] the group and I just
[1:04:31] can't answer from anybody else but I
[1:04:33] just said for me God had done enough
[1:04:35] there that I said I was around them they
[1:04:37] were some fine Baptist people but there
[1:04:39] was cussing going on and there was
[1:04:41] smoking going on before they would go up
[1:04:44] and perform
[1:04:48] and as a young man I just said I'm sorry
[1:04:50] you know I wouldn't sang with them a few
[1:04:51] times and I said I don't want to be
[1:04:53] drawn into that type of hypocritical
[1:04:56] life
[1:04:57] I think a Christian if you decide to do
[1:04:59] I think you should be a Christian
[1:05:03] there's such a blending of wines today
[1:05:05] did you see Maverick City the group that
[1:05:09] a lot of young people are listening to
[1:05:10] and they actually have some anointed
[1:05:12] songs good songs we sing some of them
[1:05:14] here and did you see him on the Grammys
[1:05:18] they decided to sing on the Grammys they
[1:05:20] decided to sing back up choir for a rap
[1:05:22] singer who has the most vile the most
[1:05:25] vile music that you could put out in rap
[1:05:28] music of both bio lyrics and Maverick
[1:05:31] City these guys that are anointed to
[1:05:33] bring these songs they chose to sing
[1:05:35] back up for them at the Grammys
[1:05:39] did you know that one of the singers at
[1:05:41] the Grammys performed a demonic
[1:05:44] ritual
[1:05:46] in the middle of all the tables right in
[1:05:48] the middle of the concert you can watch
[1:05:50] it but if you're Christian it won't take
[1:05:52] you long to turn it off it's it's it's
[1:05:54] hell right in front of you
[1:05:58] in Maverick City somehow feels
[1:06:00] comfortable to be around that they said
[1:06:02] in the interview thank you you know
[1:06:04] they're up there and thank you for the
[1:06:05] awards God's done this God we give God
[1:06:08] glory all these other things and one of
[1:06:10] the girls that's the main singer I
[1:06:11] forget her name she said in an interview
[1:06:13] she said we thank God
[1:06:16] we thank God for the crossover success
[1:06:20] that God has given us
[1:06:23] I said Lord God touch that young girl
[1:06:27] because somebody has deceived her that
[1:06:30] success is being accepted by all of
[1:06:34] those animals
[1:06:36] the most vile people are movie stars and
[1:06:40] music stars idols
[1:06:43] and to call that God made us successful
[1:06:45] that we're accepted and get awards from
[1:06:48] them that's crossover success
[1:06:51] I can tell you
[1:06:53] that's not God's success
[1:06:56] that's not the place God intended for
[1:06:58] you to use your gift of God
[1:07:05] trying to Bear my heart
[1:07:09] these Eternal things there's these are
[1:07:11] true there are Eternal things that God
[1:07:13] has given you access to and then there
[1:07:15] are temporal things
[1:07:17] temporal praise
[1:07:18] temporal
[1:07:20] if you read the book of Joshua chapter 1
[1:07:25] he said Moses my servant is dead take up
[1:07:27] take the people into the land follow the
[1:07:30] word go forward and you shall have
[1:07:32] good success
[1:07:38] not success
[1:07:40] good success
[1:07:44] I tell you brother John
[1:07:46] we're getting a little older I'll speak
[1:07:49] for myself
[1:07:52] when I end this life I want to have good
[1:07:54] success
[1:07:56] good success God has prospered many
[1:07:58] things in our lives naturally but it
[1:08:01] could all be gone tomorrow I want to
[1:08:03] have good success I want my children to
[1:08:05] respect me
[1:08:06] I want to have relationship with my sons
[1:08:09] and daughters
[1:08:16] while we're teaching them that we have
[1:08:17] to live in this world and have goals in
[1:08:20] this life why not teach
[1:08:22] that we're not of this world
[1:08:24] we're only here temporary
[1:08:26] when this is done we leave it all
[1:08:32] and all the trophies on the wall that
[1:08:34] you have from your successes and my kids
[1:08:36] have some
[1:08:37] all those trophies will be gone
[1:08:40] and won't even be acknowledged on the
[1:08:42] other side
[1:08:44] I don't think Christ is going to say how
[1:08:46] many trophies do you have on your wall
[1:08:48] in your room
[1:08:49] it's all going to burn
[1:08:52] won't even be acknowledged on the other
[1:08:54] side
[1:08:58] but I want to hear him say
[1:09:01] well done
[1:09:03] Rodney Griffith has a new song I don't
[1:09:05] know if some of you heard it but it's
[1:09:06] called when I step in the other side I
[1:09:08] only want to hear two words
[1:09:11] well
[1:09:13] done
[1:09:14] thou good and faithful servant
[1:09:21] let's pray
[1:09:27] yes I remember that
[1:09:30] those calls that I got remember my
[1:09:32] daughter
[1:09:33] Gabriella it's about four years ago when
[1:09:36] she come home from camp
[1:09:39] just weeping to her daddy's Dad I know
[1:09:43] that I received the Holy Spirit
[1:09:45] in the service
[1:09:50] I just wept with her I said God
[1:09:53] this is what really matters
[1:09:55] you know the thing is when they receive
[1:09:57] something from the Lord that young
[1:09:58] they're still going to be young they're
[1:09:59] still going to be immature
[1:10:01] but I rejoice in the thing that I need
[1:10:03] to Rejoice over
[1:10:05] as there's connections being made
[1:10:08] with their heart that Daddy can't make
[1:10:10] we can point them to the way we can
[1:10:12] guide them we can we can instruct we can
[1:10:15] but but the connection with Melchizedek
[1:10:17] the Eternal that is the most important
[1:10:21] thing for their lives
