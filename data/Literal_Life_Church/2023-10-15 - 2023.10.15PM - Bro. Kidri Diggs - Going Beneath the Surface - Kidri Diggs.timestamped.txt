[52:58] amen I won't keep
[53:00] quiet my God is
[53:03] alive how can I keep it
[53:07] inside praise the Lord hallelujah first
[53:11] Samuel chapter
[53:12] 16
[53:15] and let's start reading that
[53:19] um start at
[53:22] verse
[53:24] seven
[53:26] let's let's back up to six verse
[53:29] 6 1st Samuel 16 and 6 if you have a say
[53:33] man the Bible says and it came to pass
[53:36] when they were come that he looked on
[53:39] elab and said surely the Lord's anointed
[53:43] is before him but the Lord said unto
[53:46] Samuel look not on his cence or on
[53:51] height of his stature because I have
[53:54] refused him
[53:55] for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for
[53:59] man lookth on the outward appearance but
[54:02] the Lord lookth on the
[54:04] heart then Jesse called ainad and made
[54:07] him pass before Samuel and he said
[54:10] neither have the Lord chosen this and
[54:13] Jesse made shama to pass by and he said
[54:17] neither have the Lord chosen this again
[54:19] Jesse made Seven Sons seven of his sons
[54:23] to pass before Samuel
[54:26] and Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord hath
[54:28] not chosen these and Samuel said unto
[54:31] Jesse are here all thy children and he
[54:34] said There remaineth Yet the youngest
[54:37] and behold he keepeth the sheep and
[54:40] Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch
[54:43] him for we will not sit down till he
[54:47] come
[54:49] hither amen let's go to um Matthew
[54:53] chapter 19
[54:57] Matthew
[55:13] 19 let's
[55:16] um start at verse 16 Matthew 19 and
[55:19] 16 and behold one came and said unto him
[55:23] good Master what good things shall I do
[55:25] that I may have eternal life and he said
[55:29] unto him why callest thou me good there
[55:31] is none good
[55:33] but there there is none good but one
[55:38] that is God but if thou will enter into
[55:41] life keep the Commandments he said unto
[55:43] him which Jesus said thou shallal do no
[55:47] murder thou shallal not commit adultery
[55:49] thou shall not steal thou shall not bear
[55:51] false witness honor thy father and thy
[55:55] mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor
[55:57] as thyself the young man saith unto
[56:00] young man saith unto him all these
[56:02] things have I kept from my youth up what
[56:06] lack I yet Jesus said unto him if thou
[56:09] will be perfect go and sell that thou H
[56:12] has and give to the poor and thou shalt
[56:15] have treasure in heaven and come and
[56:17] follow me but when the young man heard
[56:20] that saying he went away sorrowful for
[56:23] he had great possession may the Lord had
[56:26] a blessing to the reading of his word
[56:27] you can have your
[56:29] seats
[56:32] amen you know tonight by the grace of
[56:35] God I want to deal with something I
[56:37] believe that we all as young people and
[56:39] even some of us as adults we we we we
[56:43] have to make sure that it's you know uh
[56:45] God is uh uh has the preeminence and
[56:49] tonight my subject is um going beneath
[56:53] the surface going beneath the
[56:57] surface you know if we take um if we
[57:01] take the the the calling of David and
[57:04] you know um God just making a transition
[57:08] from Saul to David Saul was chosen by
[57:12] the people and you know and they wanted
[57:15] a king and they wanted somebody upright
[57:17] and somebody they could see somebody
[57:19] they could confide in and all these
[57:21] natural things that they felt like they
[57:23] were missing but God had all these
[57:26] things already in place before they
[57:28] desired a king you know the King was
[57:31] already there Hallelujah represented
[57:34] through a prophet and you know the the
[57:36] people said we want we want a king we
[57:38] want somebody we can see and all these
[57:40] things but they didn't know hallelujah
[57:43] what was going to happen beneath the
[57:45] surface in Saul's life you know he
[57:48] looked Head and Shoulders he looked like
[57:49] a good King he probably looked like he
[57:51] was anointed but on the inside he had a
[57:54] lot going on on the inside Saul was a
[57:58] man that could hear the word of God and
[58:00] not obey it Hallelujah Saul was a man
[58:04] that could even surrender his gift to
[58:06] God hallelujah and still not obey the
[58:09] word of God so Saul he had issues
[58:12] beneath the surface Hallelujah on the
[58:14] top he looked Mighty on the top he
[58:17] looked like a king but beneath
[58:19] Hallelujah he was very disobedient
[58:22] Hallelujah and you know God got tired of
[58:25] Saul's
[58:26] disobedient and God say hey I'mma get me
[58:29] a new king and the choosing of the new
[58:32] king Hallelujah was the inside man it
[58:36] was who he was in his heart but when it
[58:39] comes down to choosing this King you had
[58:43] to look beneath the
[58:44] surface because when when when Samuel
[58:48] came to Jesse's house no doubt he was
[58:51] caught up in how Saul was chose and he
[58:55] came with the anointing he came with the
[58:57] Horn of all now I want you to realize
[58:59] something Samuel was the prophet for
[59:02] that
[59:03] day and the false anointed and the true
[59:06] anointed were anointed by the same
[59:10] message Hallelujah and you know he came
[59:13] and he said hey God told me that there
[59:16] is a a a king in your house so Samuel so
[59:21] so Jesse gathers all his boys did he
[59:23] gather all his
[59:25] voice no so what I want to start out the
[59:28] same church Samuel Hallelujah he was
[59:33] there under God's Direction but look at
[59:37] Jesse Jesse didn't even believe that
[59:40] David could be
[59:42] king Jesse Hallelujah looking on the
[59:45] surface looking on the top of Who David
[59:48] is looking at his stature and maybe his
[59:50] mannerisms and how he look and maybe
[59:53] dealing with the Sheep he couldn't
[59:54] didn't see that David was a king so he
[59:57] let everything that was above the
[59:59] service surface Hallelujah dictate
[1:00:03] whether he would call David or not
[1:00:05] Hallelujah and sometimes we look at
[1:00:08] what's on the surface and can't really
[1:00:10] see that you're chosen of God Amen we
[1:00:14] can't see the gifts of God we can't see
[1:00:16] amen that you may be the one that's a
[1:00:18] prayer Warrior Hallelujah you may be the
[1:00:21] one that get us here through worship
[1:00:22] that changes the whole anointing the
[1:00:24] church because we're looking at what's
[1:00:26] going on on the surface and you know
[1:00:30] David had to overcome listen to me good
[1:00:33] David had to overcome how his own
[1:00:35] parents felt about
[1:00:41] him oh
[1:00:43] my isn't that
[1:00:46] something I've been in prayer services
[1:00:49] and prayer lines where young people have
[1:00:52] come up and and they in service and they
[1:00:55] appreciate what God is doing and when
[1:00:58] they get in the prayer line their
[1:01:00] struggle is the relationship that their
[1:01:03] mother and father
[1:01:05] has how Mama's treating daddy how
[1:01:08] Daddy's treating Mama they're carrying
[1:01:10] the burden Hallelujah something that
[1:01:13] they shouldn't be carrying they're
[1:01:15] carrying it everywhere they go so you
[1:01:17] may look at your children and you may
[1:01:19] think they're good on the service but on
[1:01:21] the inside they're feeling your hurt
[1:01:24] they're feeling your pain they're
[1:01:26] feeling the things that you are going
[1:01:27] through so church we have to be mindful
[1:01:30] amen that there's always a deeper level
[1:01:33] in
[1:01:34] God and he calls elab and and and
[1:01:38] abinadab and all the different ones who
[1:01:40] maybe will look like kings and then he
[1:01:43] told him he said I refused them and then
[1:01:47] he said don't look on the countenance
[1:01:49] don't even look on the stature of that
[1:01:51] man but what I'm looking for is somebody
[1:01:53] after my very own
[1:01:56] heart now who are you beneath all the
[1:02:00] singing we just
[1:02:02] had who are you when we leave this this
[1:02:06] Tri State meeting who are you when you
[1:02:08] get back home and you're in your own
[1:02:11] house Hallelujah and all the things that
[1:02:14] you're fighting beneath the service are
[1:02:16] right there in your face again
[1:02:18] Hallelujah your social status and and
[1:02:21] who you are on IG and who you are on
[1:02:23] Facebook and Twitter who you are
[1:02:26] Hallelujah on that one that
[1:02:29] disappears see parents don't know what
[1:02:31] I'm talking about but the young people
[1:02:33] do it's called
[1:02:35] Snapchat take a picture and the filth
[1:02:38] disappears it just like that but is it
[1:02:42] still really
[1:02:44] there Hallelujah I've heard young people
[1:02:47] stream shot things and save it and you
[1:02:50] thought nobody else would see it but
[1:02:52] they got it hidden in their archives
[1:02:55] and the dirt you've done hallelujah is
[1:02:58] beneath the surface in somebody else's
[1:03:00] life Hallelujah and you know church when
[1:03:03] we look at David Hallelujah David was a
[1:03:06] young man Hallelujah that who was
[1:03:09] anointed to be king but he still went
[1:03:11] back to raise
[1:03:13] sheep let's understand something he knew
[1:03:17] that anointing was all about he knew
[1:03:19] what he was standing there Hallelujah
[1:03:22] and what was the next stage of his life
[1:03:24] but he was willing to wait on God he was
[1:03:27] willing to let God put him into
[1:03:29] Hallelujah the kingdom he although he
[1:03:33] was already anointed he didn't try to
[1:03:35] force it he let God lead his life now
[1:03:39] I'm wondering how many of you young
[1:03:40] people are in a place right now that you
[1:03:43] can let God lead your life see one thing
[1:03:46] I don't believe I don't believe every
[1:03:48] young person in here is
[1:03:50] struggling there are some young people
[1:03:52] filled with the spirit yes sir but God
[1:03:55] wants you to go on H amen some of us are
[1:03:58] waiting on person and waiting on that
[1:04:00] person God wants you to go on Hallelujah
[1:04:04] because beneath the surface you may be a
[1:04:06] David
[1:04:07] hallelujah hallelujah before that time
[1:04:10] David had no identity hallelujah amen he
[1:04:14] was just a sheep raiser Hallelujah but
[1:04:17] that Hallelujah was the contrast of who
[1:04:19] he really was he was become a leader of
[1:04:22] men yes sir
[1:04:25] which his brothers couldn't
[1:04:27] do now we going to come back to David
[1:04:29] but I just want the later scene beneath
[1:04:32] the
[1:04:33] surface you know if we go out here y'all
[1:04:35] have some very rough rough Winters amen
[1:04:39] sometimes and you know what do they do
[1:04:43] when there's a forecast of
[1:04:45] snow they start to put down salt and all
[1:04:49] these other things where do they put it
[1:04:51] on the
[1:04:53] surface
[1:04:54] so then when the snow starts to fall
[1:04:57] there's something beneath the surface
[1:05:00] that beneath the snow Hallelujah that's
[1:05:03] going to eat away at it as it begins to
[1:05:08] fall are you with
[1:05:10] me it's already there it's prepared to
[1:05:13] be there before the storm and I want to
[1:05:16] say some of you may have some things
[1:05:18] that are already placed in your life
[1:05:21] that when the anointing of God Falls
[1:05:23] Hallelujah you can't even enjoy what's
[1:05:26] happening because that thing that's
[1:05:27] under the surface is eating away at what
[1:05:31] God is
[1:05:32] doing and sometimes it's unconfessed
[1:05:35] sins Hallelujah sometimes it's hurts and
[1:05:38] pains that we carry from service to
[1:05:40] service Hallelujah from church to church
[1:05:42] and from experience to experience
[1:05:44] Hallelujah and those things begin to eat
[1:05:47] at your experience Hallelujah and that
[1:05:50] salt is there to do a job to eat up on
[1:05:53] the ice
[1:05:55] to eat up on the snow now what they're
[1:05:58] not considering is that the salt is also
[1:06:01] going to eat up what is laid
[1:06:06] on see that's what these Wise Wise
[1:06:11] Engineers they should have thought about
[1:06:13] that they they they make up this
[1:06:16] concoction they put it down on the road
[1:06:18] for the ice and the snow but not
[1:06:20] realizing everything that travels on
[1:06:23] that conc they made is going to be
[1:06:26] damaged Hallelujah and if you have
[1:06:29] things hidden things in your life no
[1:06:32] matter where you go or what path you
[1:06:33] travel if it's dead is going to eat up
[1:06:36] on what's falling and it's going to eat
[1:06:38] up on what's already
[1:06:41] there and sometimes it takes years and
[1:06:44] years of that same thing traveling and
[1:06:46] it eats and it eats to what you got a
[1:06:49] hole ins the
[1:06:53] side and the parts of the car has to be
[1:06:55] greased every year and some people
[1:06:57] neglect the
[1:06:59] greasing if you neglect the greasing
[1:07:01] Hallelujah boats and different things
[1:07:03] begin to drop off Hallelujah and some of
[1:07:07] us forget amen how important it is to
[1:07:10] spend time with
[1:07:12] God spend time with God young people
[1:07:15] hallelujah there's a purpose in your
[1:07:17] life amen yeah we could get up here and
[1:07:20] we could talk about a lot of things but
[1:07:22] I love preaching reality
[1:07:24] Hallelujah I love to put it in your lap
[1:07:27] and you ask the question where am I in
[1:07:30] Christ who am I beneath the
[1:07:34] surface now we go through the scripture
[1:07:37] Hallelujah there was a young man in the
[1:07:40] Bible they called him the rich ruler
[1:07:43] Hallelujah one thing about the rich
[1:07:46] ruler the scripture says he came running
[1:07:50] to Jesus saying good Master what what
[1:07:54] can I do to inherit eternal life
[1:07:57] Hallelujah now on the surface he was a
[1:08:00] good church
[1:08:02] member on the surface he knew his
[1:08:05] message backward and forward h on the
[1:08:08] surface he knew brother Brand's dog
[1:08:11] name he knew the name of the horse he
[1:08:15] knew about sunset Mountain and subo cane
[1:08:18] and all the things that we've been told
[1:08:20] from our youth he had all these things
[1:08:23] locked down
[1:08:24] but in reality he's running after Jesus
[1:08:27] because he knows that something he's
[1:08:32] missing on the surface everything is
[1:08:35] good I believe in the message I'm in
[1:08:37] church I dress right I love going to Tri
[1:08:40] State but beneath the surface he said
[1:08:42] what can I do to have eternal
[1:08:48] life in plain
[1:08:51] terms what the young ruler was saying
[1:08:53] say to Jesus is I know I'm
[1:09:00] lost if you don't have eternal life
[1:09:03] where are you
[1:09:05] going so even though this young man was
[1:09:07] in church Hallelujah let's let's let's
[1:09:10] let's let's let's go back to it
[1:09:12] Hallelujah Matthew
[1:09:18] 19 don't get nervous I'm about to
[1:09:22] close
[1:09:27] Matthew 19
[1:09:32] and uh let's start at Verse
[1:09:38] 18 now Verse 18 he
[1:09:42] says he said unto him which now this is
[1:09:47] the question he asked Jesus said keep
[1:09:49] the
[1:09:51] Commandments now he's confident in where
[1:09:54] he is as a young
[1:09:56] believer so his response unto Christ is
[1:10:01] which I've been around this a long time
[1:10:04] Hallelujah I can even quote you what the
[1:10:06] prophet said my pastor
[1:10:10] says let's understand something when we
[1:10:13] get there Hallelujah when we get to the
[1:10:15] other side whichever way you go your
[1:10:17] pastor ain't going to be able to help
[1:10:20] you your mother your father ain't going
[1:10:23] to be able to help you it's your
[1:10:26] individual Journey that's going to have
[1:10:27] to stand there before God hallelujah and
[1:10:31] like I like to say Amen oh my like I
[1:10:34] like to say when we stand before God
[1:10:37] hallelujah we're not going to stand
[1:10:39] there as a
[1:10:42] family what's your name Buddy dson
[1:10:44] Dawson is your mother and father here
[1:10:47] Dad your dad come on stand up here
[1:10:50] Dawson where's your dad Dawson raise
[1:10:54] your hand Dad okay there's Dad what's
[1:10:56] your name
[1:10:58] Dad Andrew when you in dsing get to
[1:11:03] heaven Hallelujah God's not going to
[1:11:06] look at your father and say hey what
[1:11:09] have you done with my son and you can't
[1:11:12] look at your father and say father what
[1:11:14] have you done with me when you guys are
[1:11:17] standing side by side God's going to
[1:11:19] look at you Dawson as a Son of God he's
[1:11:23] going to look at your father Andrew not
[1:11:25] as your dad as a Son of God so what am I
[1:11:28] saying to you Dawson you have every
[1:11:31] right to have the same Revelation he
[1:11:36] got
[1:11:38] Hallelujah you got every right to
[1:11:40] experience God just like Andrew you got
[1:11:44] every right to be filled with the power
[1:11:46] and Holy Ghost just like your father
[1:11:48] Hallelujah because God's going to judge
[1:11:51] you Dawson by your old experience
[1:11:55] [Applause]
[1:11:57] and that goes for every daughter every
[1:12:00] son when we stand before God you ain't
[1:12:03] going to be able to blame it on Mom and
[1:12:06] Daddy you're going to have to stand with
[1:12:09] your own
[1:12:13] conviction and whatever you are
[1:12:15] Hallelujah beneath the surface is what
[1:12:19] God's going to deal
[1:12:21] with because on the
[1:12:24] Dawson may look like he he's so innocent
[1:12:26] come on back up here one more time
[1:12:27] Dawson forgive me Andrew Dawson may look
[1:12:31] like he's just so innocent just don't he
[1:12:33] look like a nice handsome young
[1:12:35] boy but one thing y'all got to realize H
[1:12:39] how old are you Dawson 12 Dawson is 12
[1:12:42] and at the age of 12 he got paror Andrew
[1:12:46] in him go ahead and sit down
[1:12:49] brother he got
[1:12:51] habits of Andrew in
[1:12:54] him he got
[1:12:56] desires of Andrew in him Hallelujah he
[1:12:59] got Cravings of Andrew in him Hallelujah
[1:13:03] and if those things are not channeled by
[1:13:04] the Holy Ghost Hallelujah it'll lead him
[1:13:07] into another life but the Holy Ghost
[1:13:10] will cut off unwanted and unmar desires
[1:13:14] that happens beneath the
[1:13:16] surface we hear it all the time amen you
[1:13:19] look at how Spirits pass through the
[1:13:21] generations and you say what this young
[1:13:23] man drinks alcohol because his father
[1:13:26] did or this young girl is per
[1:13:29] promiscuous cuz her mother was see
[1:13:31] generational spirits that follow beneath
[1:13:34] the surface and sometimes a child
[1:13:36] doesn't even know why they're doing what
[1:13:38] they're doing they're doing it because
[1:13:40] of you mama and
[1:13:45] daddy and sometimes it's
[1:13:48] unmar and sometimes it just
[1:13:50] happens look Abraham I give a prime
[1:13:54] example Abraham looked at Sarah and he
[1:13:57] said W girl W man you looking
[1:14:03] good my girl you don't look 90 years old
[1:14:08] girl you look like you're 26 36 2
[1:14:13] W he looked at her and something had
[1:14:17] happened but while he was looking
[1:14:19] Hallelujah he wasn't
[1:14:21] realizing he wasn't paying attention at
[1:14:25] what took place beneath the surface
[1:14:27] Hallelujah he was looking at on the
[1:14:29] outside and saying man you look good but
[1:14:31] down deep down beneath the surface God
[1:14:34] had produced a
[1:14:36] restoration and the promise of God was
[1:14:39] right there if he was able to catch it
[1:14:43] but because he wasn't where he was
[1:14:45] supposed to be spiritually he looked at
[1:14:47] her and fear came in his
[1:14:51] life he said hey you my sister just
[1:14:55] start lying for no
[1:14:58] reason hadn't God always been with
[1:15:01] him so why does he feel like he have to
[1:15:04] lie
[1:15:05] now so he just starts to lie and say you
[1:15:08] my sister and when they come they might
[1:15:10] going to come now he's prophesying over
[1:15:11] his own
[1:15:12] life and the very thing he's speaking
[1:15:15] over his own life it starts to
[1:15:18] happen young people I don't care what
[1:15:21] you into I'm going give you a little
[1:15:22] insight into my life when I was in the
[1:15:24] world and I was doing things I wasn't
[1:15:26] supposed to be I doing I was still
[1:15:28] coming to church Hallelujah but you know
[1:15:30] what I used to do to my friends I used
[1:15:32] to tell them I used to tell them we'd be
[1:15:34] out doing something I say y'all know
[1:15:35] what one day I'm going be
[1:15:42] saved one day I'mma get right with
[1:15:48] God I'm doing all the stuff I a't
[1:15:50] supposed to be doing but in my heart
[1:15:53] something was going on beneath the
[1:15:54] surface Hallelujah and don't you let
[1:15:57] hallelujah what we all could see going
[1:16:00] on on top of the surface stop you from
[1:16:03] believing that God could fulfill that
[1:16:05] desire on the
[1:16:08] inside Hallelujah you know so I will
[1:16:11] confess one day I'm going be serving God
[1:16:14] one day I'm going give God all my heart
[1:16:17] and I would always confess that and then
[1:16:19] one day it
[1:16:22] happened how did it happen I don't know
[1:16:25] all I know is I started to lose my
[1:16:27] desire for the things of the
[1:16:29] world and it became easy hallelujah what
[1:16:33] was happening God was dealing with the
[1:16:35] inner
[1:16:37] man we got two many surface
[1:16:41] Christians we got too many surface young
[1:16:43] people hallelujah they didn't come to
[1:16:46] the Tri State some of you come just to
[1:16:47] get away from
[1:16:48] home school is tomorrow and you don't
[1:16:50] want to go to bed
[1:16:52] early

[1:17:08] how do you go deeper by having a honest
[1:17:12] confession Hallelujah coming before God
[1:17:15] and say Lord I got this in my life and I
[1:17:16] don't want it to be there Lord I'm I'm
[1:17:19] struggling in this area and Lord I'm
[1:17:21] tired of it I know you're a God of
[1:17:22] deliver
[1:17:24] Hallelujah Lord and I want Deliverance
[1:17:26] right now Hallelujah we've gathered
[1:17:28] we're here amen the presence of God is
[1:17:30] here and I know Lord you can touch my
[1:17:34] life but see the Rich Young Ruler
[1:17:36] Hallelujah when he responded to God he
[1:17:39] said which Lord which
[1:17:42] Commandments and Jesus said unto him
[1:17:46] Thou shalt do no murder most of us are
[1:17:48] not
[1:17:49] guilty talk to me young people we got
[1:17:52] some killers in here you need
[1:17:56] to we need to call tpd on
[1:18:02] you hide in here
[1:18:05] murderers but Jesus came to magnify that
[1:18:09] Hallelujah beneath the surface some of
[1:18:11] you are killing people with your
[1:18:15] mouth some of you are killing your
[1:18:17] friends with your mouth some of you are
[1:18:20] killing their influence because you're
[1:18:22] jealous

[1:18:27] the surface I don't like the way she
[1:18:30] wear her hair I don't like the way she
[1:18:31] wear her clothes let's not talk to her

[1:18:52] a man look at upon a woman and lust
[1:18:54] after her he has committed
[1:18:57] adultery I wonder how many young people
[1:19:00] are guilty of
[1:19:01] that vice versa Brothers sometimes we
[1:19:05] think we get a pass cuz that scripture
[1:19:07] is just for the women
[1:19:11] uhuh if I can be if I can talk natural
[1:19:14] for a second how many times sisters are
[1:19:18] out and they see a young man coming from
[1:19:19] the gym and they say Oho he got some
[1:19:21] nice legs
[1:19:25] oh his Cal's
[1:19:30] out that same scripture
[1:19:32] applies young man if a woman lookth
[1:19:35] after you and lust she also commits
[1:19:43] adulty that's why we're not fans of
[1:19:45] short
[1:19:49] pants can I keep

[1:20:13] father or is that a
[1:20:15] challenge mama don't understand me Daddy

[1:20:50] surface beneath the surface hallah I'm
[1:20:53] sick of being a Christian I want to be
[1:20:55] bad cuz ain't nobody fishing in my pond

[1:21:19] consistent with something that they have
[1:21:21] to go deep for to get your heart
[1:21:24] Hallelujah to get everything don't make
[1:21:27] it

[1:25:49] are you now I know I'm saying a lot of
[1:25:52] of natural stuff but I want you to catch
[1:25:53] the spiritual application amen this
[1:25:56] young man beneath beneath the surface he
[1:25:59] was a good Christian he was so confident
[1:26:03] in who he was Hallelujah he come to
[1:26:06] Jesus and he said which Commandments and
[1:26:08] Jesus repeats the Commandments that that
[1:26:11] he laid out and this young man says I've
[1:26:14] done this from my
[1:26:16] youth I'm good I've been in church all
[1:26:20] my life can I get an amen
[1:26:22] amen amen my father's even a
[1:26:27] pastor I'm on the
[1:26:29] choir I sing Hallelujah we
[1:26:33] anointed that don't mean a hill of
[1:26:38] beans that's a southern expression but I
[1:26:40] think you know what I'm talking
[1:26:42] about and just to show you let me tell
[1:26:45] you a testimony I know a young girl
[1:26:47] who's from North Carolina they she would
[1:26:50] travel with the church and they would
[1:26:51] get up and sing as a group as a church
[1:26:53] group at the meetings and one year down
[1:26:56] at uh Tim Hughes they called The Church
[1:26:59] up and she was walking up with the
[1:27:00] church and when they got almost there
[1:27:02] she dropped dead right there in
[1:27:04] church 18 years
[1:27:08] old I ain't going to ask how many 18
[1:27:10] year olds we got in
[1:27:11] here hallelujah but death is not a
[1:27:15] respect a
[1:27:17] person that's why you got to make sure
[1:27:19] you ready and this young girl she drops
[1:27:23] dead right there in surface in in in in
[1:27:26] service now I wonder if that was to
[1:27:28] happen in here tonight what would take
[1:27:30] place beneath the
[1:27:34] surface if it was your daughter your son
[1:27:37] that dropped dead right here in the
[1:27:38] congregation how would you
[1:27:41] respond how would your friends respond
[1:27:44] Hallelujah to that happening right here
[1:27:45] in church and everybody was like oh my
[1:27:48] God and then some people started
[1:27:50] whispering what's happening to oh my oh
[1:27:53] my God she she di oh my
[1:27:56] god when we have an example for things
[1:27:59] like that remember when brother wayy
[1:28:01] died Hallelujah and everybody was going
[1:28:04] crazy and just brother BR say sit down
[1:28:06] you've been taught better than that we
[1:28:09] don't know what God will do Hallelujah
[1:28:12] and sometimes things happen in young
[1:28:13] people's life that shock us but what we
[1:28:16] need to do is sit down and gather
[1:28:17] ourselves and say God is still God God
[1:28:21] is still able
[1:28:22] God is still able to bring them out of
[1:28:24] us H let's be confident in our
[1:28:30] God a brother mov everybody out of the
[1:28:33] way got down on his knee so y'all be
[1:28:36] quiet everybody bow your head got down
[1:28:38] and started praying for
[1:28:40] her and she
[1:28:42] Rose came back from the dead but what I
[1:28:46] love about it she didn't go sit down she
[1:28:49] got right on up there with the Choir
[1:28:50] Hallelujah and some s her
[1:28:56] song even after death she was still able
[1:28:58] to give God praise
[1:29:02] Hallelujah I wonder if there are things
[1:29:04] in your life hallelujah amen was God
[1:29:07] help you to overcome it can you still
[1:29:10] give God
[1:29:13] praise but that's not the end of the
[1:29:15] story they went back to their home
[1:29:17] church and what we normally what they
[1:29:19] normally do is after youth meetings they
[1:29:22] have a testimony service and this is
[1:29:24] Tuesday from Saturday to Tuesday Tuesday
[1:29:27] all the young people going around
[1:29:29] talking about what God did for them
[1:29:31] don't we have services like that we talk
[1:29:34] about what God did for us in the meeting
[1:29:37] when it got to this young girl everybody
[1:29:39] else was testifying when it got to her
[1:29:41] it say she stood on her feet she smiled
[1:29:44] and she said I thank God for being here
[1:29:47] and she dropped dead in
[1:29:50] church this time not to get
[1:29:55] up what
[1:29:58] happened it was the grace of
[1:30:01] God she was supposed to go that Saturday
[1:30:04] but she wasn't ready so God gave her
[1:30:06] four days to get her heart right
[1:30:08] Hallelujah and she took full advantage
[1:30:10] of it because she knew who she was
[1:30:12] beneath the surface everybody else saw
[1:30:15] on the choir singing but she knew she
[1:30:17] wasn't converted she knew she didn't
[1:30:19] have the Holy Ghost so after death she
[1:30:22] made haste Hallelujah after death she
[1:30:24] got right with God after death she got
[1:30:26] in her prayer closet and she said I
[1:30:28] thank the Lord for being here that meant
[1:30:30] I'm
[1:30:32] ready and God came and took his daughter
[1:30:36] home but nobody really knew who she was
[1:30:40] beneath the surface until that time
[1:30:43] happened and it's just like the Rich
[1:30:45] Young Ruler Hallelujah he seemed like he
[1:30:48] had everything wrapped up everything
[1:30:50] good but then Jes Jesus says to him if
[1:30:53] you will be
[1:30:56] perfect what if God was to say that to
[1:30:58] you
[1:30:59] tonight now one thing I want you to keep
[1:31:02] in mind God's not going to say that to
[1:31:05] you just randomly he's going to deal
[1:31:07] with the thing that's holding you
[1:31:10] back Hallelujah he said to the rich
[1:31:13] ruler if you be perfect go sell
[1:31:16] everything you have see that was his
[1:31:19] challenge that was his God that was who
[1:31:22] he is beneath everything else he was a
[1:31:25] man that loved his riches he was a man
[1:31:28] who loved his status so when Jesus deal
[1:31:30] with you he's going to deal with what's
[1:31:32] in your
[1:31:35] heart
[1:31:37] Hallelujah and in his heart he loved his
[1:31:40] riches he loved everything that made his
[1:31:43] image to be a rich ruler and our God's
[1:31:46] going to deal with his image do you love
[1:31:48] your image more than eternal
[1:31:50] life
[1:31:54] he said but why are you preaching on
[1:31:56] these terms cuz I want you to be honest
[1:31:58] with yourself
[1:32:00] tonight they stop trying to fake one
[1:32:03] another
[1:32:07] out I give you a secret if you chasing
[1:32:11] somebody you know how you can tag them
[1:32:14] if you playing tag or whatever you know
[1:32:16] how you can tag them they can make all
[1:32:18] the head f it but this part of their
[1:32:21] body ain't going
[1:32:23] nowhere so you focus on the center and
[1:32:26] you will always be able to put your
[1:32:28] hands on it Hallelujah if you focus on
[1:32:31] the center you will always be able to
[1:32:33] touch Jesus no matter how the enemy
[1:32:36] tries to fake you out no matter how many
[1:32:38] head moves he got no matter how much he
[1:32:39] goes to the left or to the right keep
[1:32:41] your eyes on the center and you'll be
[1:32:44] able to touch Christ Hallelujah and you
[1:32:48] know church this young man the Bible
[1:32:50] says he walked way
[1:32:52] sad he should have rejoiced because God
[1:32:55] was dealing with his
[1:32:58] heart God was dealing with the whole
[1:33:00] issue of why he was running after him he
[1:33:04] was running after him to receive eternal
[1:33:06] life Hallelujah but the only thing that
[1:33:09] was stopping him from receiving eternal
[1:33:11] life was his secret I love
[1:33:16] money he says go sell everything and
[1:33:19] come follow me there's so much in the
[1:33:23] story Hallelujah in the story he says go
[1:33:27] sell everything you got come follow me
[1:33:30] there's only a certain group of people
[1:33:32] Jesus spoke those words
[1:33:34] to come follow
[1:33:37] me the last time he said that it was to
[1:33:40] who his
[1:33:41] disciples this young man was supposed to
[1:33:44] be a
[1:33:49] disciple but he had so much going on
[1:33:52] beneath the surface he couldn't even
[1:33:54] fulfill the calling that God put in his
[1:33:58] life the gift of God was
[1:34:01] suppressed in his own
[1:34:05] desires go back and read
[1:34:08] it the Bible says hallelujah he was
[1:34:11] supposed to be a fisherman of men Jesus
[1:34:13] said come follow me go sell everything
[1:34:15] you got come follow me he told to Peter
[1:34:17] James and John and the rest of
[1:34:19] them leave your nets leave that come
[1:34:22] follow me so he's saying the same thing
[1:34:24] to this Rich Young Ruler go sell
[1:34:26] everything and come follow me Jesus had
[1:34:28] a purpose but he couldn't overcome who
[1:34:31] he was on the
[1:34:33] inside but let me tell you something
[1:34:36] you're going to recognize what you
[1:34:38] rejected one
[1:34:41] day and now the Bible says that this
[1:34:43] young man he got more and more riches he
[1:34:45] got more and more popularity he got
[1:34:48] bigger and bigger and bigger in Fame His
[1:34:50] Image was so big
[1:34:52] Hallelujah but then the Bible says one
[1:34:54] day it says thy soul is required of
[1:34:58] thee and the Bible says he lifted up his
[1:35:01] eyes in
[1:35:07] hell I want you to look at it everybody
[1:35:10] all
[1:35:12] right he lifted up in his
[1:35:14] eyes in Hell keeping the
[1:35:20] Commandments
[1:35:23] he kept the Commandments for his
[1:35:26] day he didn't steal he didn't commit
[1:35:30] adultery he didn't bear false witness he
[1:35:31] honored his mother and father his
[1:35:33] response to Jesus was I've done these
[1:35:35] things from my youth Hallelujah but
[1:35:38] keeping the Commandments still couldn't
[1:35:41] stop him from being in
[1:35:44] hell and I'll take it a step further
[1:35:47] Hallelujah the Bible says when Jesus
[1:35:50] looked at him and he walked away the
[1:35:52] Bible says Jesus loved him even the love
[1:35:55] of God couldn't stop him from going to
[1:36:03] hell it could but he made his decision
[1:36:07] not to let
[1:36:09] it that's what the grace of God was all
[1:36:12] about Hallelujah the prophet of God say
[1:36:14] God put barricades in our way and we
[1:36:17] climb over the
[1:36:19] barricades God put road blocks in our
[1:36:22] way we bust through the roadblocks he
[1:36:24] says nobody God don't want nobody to go
[1:36:26] to hell he said but we choose
[1:36:30] it because of our own desires because of
[1:36:33] the things that's in our life beneath
[1:36:35] the
[1:36:37] surface and now in Hell everybody all
[1:36:41] right now in
[1:36:43] hell what was beneath the
[1:36:46] surface Hallelujah the real mystery of
[1:36:49] who he was starts to come come
[1:36:53] alive now he's in hell and he says hey
[1:36:56] let me go back and warn my brothers now
[1:36:59] he's an
[1:37:00] [Music]
[1:37:02] evangelist the gift has come alive in
[1:37:05] Hell let me go warn my brothers that
[1:37:07] they don't go the path I go don't that
[1:37:10] sound like a
[1:37:13] disciple so one way another you going to
[1:37:16] recognize what you rejected or what you
[1:37:18] left
[1:37:19] behind that's right
[1:37:24] but the key is we don't want it to come
[1:37:27] alive in
[1:37:28] Hell amen I'd rather Hallelujah let God
[1:37:32] use me on this
[1:37:35] side and the young man start to cry out
[1:37:39] he's in torment and all these things and
[1:37:41] he says hey let me go warn my brothers
[1:37:43] so they don't go down the same path and
[1:37:44] then the angel H Abraham or or the one
[1:37:47] that was talking to me say no they got
[1:37:49] Moses and the prophets just like you got
[1:37:52] I'm not going to allow you to go warn
[1:37:54] them they have to make a choice just
[1:37:55] like
[1:37:57] you and then he says I know I know how
[1:38:01] they are they're not going to listen to
[1:38:03] nobody else but they'll listen to
[1:38:05] me it was too late so let me say this I
[1:38:09] hope you're not following your unsaved
[1:38:15] siblings I hope you're not following
[1:38:17] that older brother that older sister
[1:38:20] that you love and respect back if their
[1:38:22] life is not
[1:38:23] right don't you let that love for them
[1:38:26] Hallelujah allow you to follow them to
[1:38:31] Hell stand your
[1:38:34] ground and say I want to be a
[1:38:38] Christian before I close beneath the
[1:38:41] surface I know a brother Hallelujah who
[1:38:45] was an only child he was like a miracle
[1:38:47] baby and his mom and dad couldn't have
[1:38:50] children and one day they had a child

[1:39:11] act the fool I'mma get
[1:39:13] it cuz I'm

[1:39:18] way that's why when you see kids in the
[1:39:20] store were like no Billy you can't have
[1:39:29] that today is a new
[1:39:34] day because in my
[1:39:40] day if you wanted to show people how
[1:39:43] small you was the parents in my day

[1:39:50] whipping in the mall in the grocery
[1:39:52] store in church wherever you went

[1:40:00] hallelujah how we raise our
[1:40:03] kids and you know we have all the stuff

[1:40:08] for himself Hallelujah back in my day my

[1:40:52] it'll make you
[1:40:56] [Music]
[1:41:02] say you knew not to play with her
[1:41:05] because she had a certain
[1:41:07] Authority Hallelujah and if I could if I
[1:41:10] could take you into the rim of how I was
[1:41:12] raised Hallelujah she was we talking
[1:41:14] about beneath the surface now above the
[1:41:16] surface she was just as sweet and kind
[1:41:18] as could be but when you get out of line
[1:41:21] you get out of line mama was
[1:41:25] rough they say boy you we just love your
[1:41:28] mama boy we love Miss Z I'll be

[1:42:14] something going on beneath the surface
[1:42:17] Hallelujah and my mom used to go to work
[1:42:19] she she worked at a nuclear plant and
[1:42:21] she used to come home with a gun a night
[1:42:24] stick a can of Mace and

[1:42:34] would take her thief from target
[1:42:36] practice that she put all them holes in
[1:42:38] the head and holes in the heart and take
[1:42:41] it and put it on the laundry door so we

[1:43:03] stick now I say this I'll be honest now
[1:43:07] I never thought my mom would beat me
[1:43:09] with a night stick or spray me with ma
[1:43:11] although she said one time if you try me
[1:43:13] I'll spray you with this mace and I go
[1:43:16] to work on you
[1:43:18] boy now I know there some of y'all
[1:43:20] that's
[1:43:24] abuse hallelujah amen and no get me
[1:43:29] wrong I've reminded her of
[1:43:33] that you can ask my daughter I tell her
[1:43:36] to this day boy you better be glad we a
[1:43:38] grew up in this day you'll be in
[1:43:41] jail but it took those kinds of things
[1:43:44] Hallelujah because we were going against
[1:43:46] so many other things beneath the surface
[1:43:49] so we had to have a line a level of
[1:43:52] respect now I didn't believe that she
[1:43:55] would hit me with the gun or hit me with
[1:43:57] the night stick spray me with maze put
[1:43:58] handcuffs on me but I wasn't willing to
[1:44:01] try
[1:44:02] either H cuz there was a reverence for
[1:44:05] the life Hallelujah and then can you
[1:44:08] imagine seeing all that and then seeing
[1:44:11] that woman get
[1:44:13] saved
[1:44:15] hallelujah oh my when she would once
[1:44:18] come in with the force now she comes in
[1:44:20] with great
[1:44:22] he says okay son don't don't do that
[1:44:24] again I be like
[1:44:29] huh we ain't get no
[1:44:33] what this what Mercy look
[1:44:37] like I think I like this kind of
[1:44:43] God but then God start to deal God start
[1:44:46] to do things beneath the surface and she
[1:44:48] start to change on top
[1:44:51] Hallelujah to where it all begin to draw
[1:44:54] all of us in because we knew who she was
[1:44:56] without the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and
[1:44:58] when the Holy Spirit came in her life
[1:45:01] from the inside out started to
[1:45:03] change and when God deals with you
[1:45:06] beneath the surface your life from the
[1:45:08] inside out will change Hallelujah there
[1:45:11] too often we put on a good show for the
[1:45:14] outside and on the inside you're still
[1:45:19] dirty don't get nervous I'm about to
[1:45:26] close but this young man
[1:45:30] Hallelujah even though he knew he wasn't
[1:45:33] where he was supposed to
[1:45:35] be and God showed him his
[1:45:38] error he still wasn't willing to give it
[1:45:43] up I hope we young people we don't fall
[1:45:45] in that category
[1:45:48] tonight some of us got struggles some of
[1:45:50] us got things in our life some of us
[1:45:53] have even had an experience with God but
[1:45:55] we're
[1:45:56] stagnated we're not going any further
[1:45:59] than just a good church
[1:46:01] service
[1:46:03] Hallelujah God wants a complete and
[1:46:06] total
[1:46:08] surrender and that's what he got with
[1:46:10] David Hallelujah with David all his
[1:46:13] false all his failures all his mistakes
[1:46:16] he still had a complete surrender
[1:46:18] Hallelujah where he can look at wrongs
[1:46:21] and he wouldn't make Hallelujah he
[1:46:23] wouldn't make it somebody else's problem
[1:46:25] he would go to God and say Lord I have
[1:46:29] sinned that was the difference between
[1:46:32] David and Saul David would hold himself
[1:46:36] accountable H David could self-reflect
[1:46:40] Saul would not
[1:46:41] self-reflect David would say God I did
[1:46:44] does God I did that I'm so sorry s would
[1:46:47] say it was the people you gave
[1:46:49] me it's my mama I look like this because
[1:46:52] of my
[1:46:53] mama I don't have a job and I'm lazy
[1:46:56] because I didn't have no father in my
[1:46:58] life always blaming it on somebody else
[1:47:01] no hold yourself
[1:47:04] [Applause]
[1:47:10] accountable because beneath the
[1:47:15] surface I'm going to get into the just
[1:47:18] of my message tonight
[1:47:22] always beneath the
[1:47:24] surface there's always
[1:47:26] more if we go out to a
[1:47:29] virgin area that hasn't been cultivated
[1:47:34] there's a lot of things going on in that
[1:47:36] area beneath the
[1:47:37] surface although the grass might be
[1:47:39] green and pretty there's all kind of
[1:47:42] animals out there in that grass there's
[1:47:45] worms out there there's bugs out there
[1:47:47] beetles out there moldes out there all
[1:47:49] kind of stuff stuff that are out there
[1:47:51] in that uncultivated land beneath the
[1:47:54] surface on the top you you can imagine
[1:47:57] say man I could build a nice house out
[1:48:00] here but the only way to build that
[1:48:02] house you got to deal with the land
[1:48:05] Hallelujah and first of all you got to
[1:48:07] do you got to dig it up Hallelujah you
[1:48:10] got to dig it up and make it fit to
[1:48:11] build on hallelujah amen cuz nobody
[1:48:15] wants to build a house on top of a snake
[1:48:19] pit Hallelujah nobody wants to build a
[1:48:22] house surrounded by hornest
[1:48:25] nests amen so what do you do you
[1:48:27] cultivate the land and some areas you
[1:48:29] have to tear down things and pull out
[1:48:32] Hallelujah and what God does sometimes
[1:48:34] he allows storms to come to shake loose
[1:48:37] things that are already loose in your
[1:48:39] life Hallelujah to break off branches
[1:48:42] that are not producing Hallelujah so
[1:48:45] that tree Hallelujah could be cultivated
[1:48:47] so that tree could be pruned amen so it
[1:48:50] could push out some new life so what God
[1:48:52] would allow trials and tribulation as
[1:48:55] young people just to get the best you to
[1:48:57] come
[1:48:59] out but if you look beneath the surface
[1:49:02] you know the prophet preach the message
[1:49:03] broken system Hallelujah he says the
[1:49:07] water falls off the roof and in that
[1:49:10] system Hallelujah he said in that
[1:49:12] man-made system there are bugs in that
[1:49:16] system but there's something eating the
[1:49:19] bugs frogs may be eating the bugs but
[1:49:22] then there's something eating the frogs
[1:49:25] snakes may be eating the frogs and then
[1:49:28] there's a cycle of Filth in that system
[1:49:31] Hallelujah a life that continues to live
[1:49:34] but not only live it's getting bigger
[1:49:36] and bigger more bugs more frogs more
[1:49:39] snakes all of that is in that system
[1:49:42] Hallelujah and if you don't deal with
[1:49:44] the things that are beneath the surface
[1:49:47] in your life it's just going to invite
[1:49:49] more spirits
[1:49:51] and before you know it your land is
[1:50:00] contaminated but at the same
[1:50:03] time
[1:50:05] Hallelujah if you go to a gold
[1:50:08] mind the atmosphere in that mind is
[1:50:11] sometimes
[1:50:13] muggy it's
[1:50:14] dark it has a certain feeling about it
[1:50:18] gloomy but as they begin to work in that
[1:50:21] mind and they begin to dig and dig
[1:50:24] because somebody know there's gold in
[1:50:26] there so they have to push through all
[1:50:28] the darkness they to push through all
[1:50:31] that muggy atmosphere that's to push
[1:50:33] through nobody else wanting to go in
[1:50:34] there and they push through and push
[1:50:36] through just to come out with
[1:50:38] gold Hallelujah and I want to say
[1:50:41] tonight that some of you are
[1:50:43] gold and you got to push through see I
[1:50:46] got myself on a
[1:50:49] timer
[1:50:54] Hallelujah I was in South I was in South
[1:50:56] Africa preaching I had my larm
[1:50:58] set and the service was so powerful we
[1:51:02] were so caught up in God and I was
[1:51:04] preaching and running around and and
[1:51:06] then I wondered after service why my
[1:51:08] alarm didn't go
[1:51:09] off and I was talking to brother Bry
[1:51:11] brother Bryan I had my alarm said I
[1:51:13] didn't tend to go on at lawence I don't
[1:51:15] know what happened he said I saw it
[1:51:17] ringing and I cut it off
[1:51:23] sneaky
[1:51:26] preacher I'm down here preaching he on
[1:51:28] the pull pit looking at my phone and
[1:51:30] stops IT and keeps like Amen brother

[1:51:44] close ask
[1:51:47] yourself what's going on with you

[1:51:53] y'all
[1:51:54] come come musicians come beneath the
[1:51:59] surface God can either be dealing with
[1:52:02] you or the enemy can be
[1:52:05] suppressing how God wants to deal with
[1:52:08] you how by the things you have in
[1:52:12] secret by the things you haven't
[1:52:15] confessed Hallelujah by the things you
[1:52:18] are afraid of like I said this morning
[1:52:21] the greatest problem we have in the
[1:52:23] church is people living by
[1:52:27] fear young people living by fear they're
[1:52:30] afraid you know I can't get saved CU I
[1:52:32] won't have no more
[1:52:33] friends that's a
[1:52:37] lie it's not until you get saved the
[1:52:39] real friends come in your
[1:52:41] [Music]
[1:52:45] life cuz the people in the world They
[1:52:48] Don't Love You
[1:52:51] they want what they can get out of
[1:52:53] you they want to use you
[1:52:56] up but a real friend will go to church
[1:52:58] with you and pray with you and talk
[1:53:00] about the things of God and encourage
[1:53:02] you encourage you to lay before God and
[1:53:05] say hey get that right don't worry I'll
[1:53:07] be praying with you that's what real
[1:53:09] friends do and if you don't have those
[1:53:12] kind of people in your life you don't
[1:53:14] have
[1:53:15] friends Hallelujah real friends will
[1:53:18] encourage you to spend time with God

[1:53:37] you're
[1:53:41] down but when you don't know who
[1:53:43] somebody is beneath the
[1:53:45] surface they can flip on you at any
[1:53:48] moment
[1:53:51] now you ask yourself
[1:53:53] tonight what's going
[1:53:55] on beneath that nice beautiful posterior
[1:53:59] your nice long hair your pretty dress
[1:54:02] your nice

[1:54:27] you put it on and you just good and
[1:54:29] you're going to
[1:54:30] church but then you got depression

[1:54:35] surface you got on your right shoes and
[1:54:38] you got your little necklace on and all
[1:54:40] these things your hair is curled and and
[1:54:42] you got clear gloth on your
[1:54:46] nails but on the
[1:54:48] inside
[1:54:50] you're not
[1:54:51] happy all of that is just a
[1:54:56] mirage who are you right now while God
[1:55:01] is
[1:55:04] calling because we all know right now in
[1:55:07] this moment if we have eternal life or
[1:55:11] not you know if your eyes closed right
[1:55:14] now whether you're going to
[1:55:17] heaven or you're going to be stuck in
[1:55:19] the tribul
[1:55:20] ation if God will have mercy on you to
[1:55:22] make it to
[1:55:24] Heaven why take that
[1:55:27] chance I've been there I've been there
[1:55:30] going to church and not where I supposed
[1:55:33] to be in Christ and Mama spent too long
[1:55:35] at church and I'm thinking oh my God I'm
[1:55:37] in
[1:55:39] Tribulation I'm lost she ain't got home
[1:55:43] yet she's normally here by 9:30 it's
[1:55:45] 10:00 and she still ain't here it's
[1:55:48] 10:30 she still ain't here now I'm
[1:55:51] afraid you know why I'm afraid cuz I
[1:55:54] really believe what she's been
[1:55:59] teaching and I'm not making any of you
[1:56:03] unbelievers but what I'm saying is why
[1:56:05] play with
[1:56:07] God because we don't know what's going
[1:56:09] to happen when we leave out of
[1:56:12] here why play with God why try to hide
[1:56:16] these things beneath the surface you say
[1:56:18] brother why you dealing with cuz I'm I
[1:56:20] want to provoke the
[1:56:22] devil I want to provoke the one who's
[1:56:24] been hiding come right in our churches
[1:56:27] and sit still and look in here enjoy the
[1:56:29] word and worship and all these things
[1:56:31] and leave you locked up and bound and go
[1:56:33] back to the same old
[1:56:39] stuff why not come clean with
[1:56:43] God beneath the
[1:56:45] surface nobody knew David was a king
[1:56:49] beneath the surface nobody knew that he
[1:56:51] was a giant
[1:56:53] killer beneath the surface nobody knew
[1:56:56] that he was going to encourage other
[1:56:58] believers to
[1:56:59] believe to fight alongside him
[1:57:02] Hallelujah beneath the surface they
[1:57:05] believe that Esther was too plain to be
[1:57:10] Queen but she had the character
[1:57:12] Hallelujah to grant that wish in that
[1:57:15] moment H it wasn't her makeup it wasn't
[1:57:18] her clothes it was her own plain
[1:57:22] personalities and that's what Rose up
[1:57:25] Hallelujah above the surface and that's
[1:57:27] what the king fell in love with he fell
[1:57:29] in love with somebody that was what
[1:57:35] real Hallelujah on top Rahab was a
[1:57:39] prostitute but beneath beneath the
[1:57:41] surface she was a child of
[1:57:45] God beneath the surface she could say
[1:57:48] Lord hallelujah I've been guing to y'all
[1:57:51] now I need a true token her desire look
[1:57:53] at the token was the Holy
[1:57:57] Ghost that's who she was beneath the
[1:58:02] surface who are
[1:58:05] you beneath the
[1:58:09] surface Hallelujah let's not play with
[1:58:12] god let's come clean Hallelujah because
[1:58:16] one thing about the enemy and one thing
[1:58:18] about re rejecting God once you hear his
[1:58:21] voice where you are spiritually you're
[1:58:24] either going to get stronger or
[1:58:26] weaker if you hear a message like this
[1:58:30] either the enemy is going to get
[1:58:31] stronger or
[1:58:32] weaker and that's based upon your
[1:58:34] reaction to What Was
[1:58:37] Heard either you can react to expose the
[1:58:40] enemy and you get
[1:58:42] stronger or either you can react to
[1:58:45] continue to hide and the devil will get
[1:58:48] stronger
