house in her first Glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing so now the temple was destroyed and there were some there that not just heard about but maybe even were there when the original Glory came into Solomon's Temple and he's asking who among you that are left that were there and who has heard of it and now look at how it's been destroyed and there is no glory in it it has been destroyed and then in this restoration he says yet now be strong o zerubabel sayeth the Lord and be strong o Joshua son of Jo josec the high priest and be strong all ye people of the land sayeth the Lord and work for I Am With You sayith the Lord of hosts according to the word that I covenanted with you uh covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear ye not isn't it a joy to know that we those that come out of Egypt under a prophet's message and now many years later the Lord's saying I am still with you I will be with you I will be with you in this full restoration I was with you in Egypt I brought you out I was with you in the temple when the glory came down and I'm still with you today notice the prophecy now for thus say the Lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land and I will shake All Nations and the desire of all Nations shall come and I will fill this house with Glory saith the Lord of hosts all of us that are Bible readers know this is a prophecy literally for Israel as well when the temple is restored to them then God promises that not only will they rebuild it but he said I'll fill it with my glory again but it's not just a prophecy physically it's a spiritual prophecy for the Bride of Jesus Christ I filled it 2,000 years ago with my glory and I'm I'm going to come now and fill it again Hallelujah so he says and it doesn't stop there he says he says I will fill this house with glory sayith the lord the silver is mine and the gold is mine sayeth the Lord of hosts the glory look how it goes further now the glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former glory saith the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace saith the Lord of hosts the first house of the Lord was filled with his glory it wasn't just that it was a building but when you read your Bibles you see that that day of dedication it was filled with his glory and then in hegi he says the last house the glory in the last house will be even greater I want to speak on the greater glory of the last house this prophecy can't just apply to the literal Temple for Israel but it must speak of the filling of the true temples that happened on the day of Pentecost when God did just that in human beings and an unexpected moment when they were praying and they were emptying out and they were giving themselves and they knew there was a promise laying there and they talked about it for 10 days and they Fellowship together and then they begin to just pray and empty out and something unique happened that the the Bible said would happen and that is now the true Temple would be filled with the glory of God filled with the Holy Ghost and it was a powerful moment friends until they actually drunk in the spirit and come down and speaking things that were they were glorifying God and every nation was hearing it is in their own language it was a very unique moment of the the glory of God coming and filling the true temples of God they seen it in Jesus Christ they said how could God be fill his glory with so much in a vessel like Jesus Christ but now Jesus was not sin born but now sin born vessels could actually have this Glory living in their temples praise the Lord and so now uh that's when he filled the true House of God the glory of the Lord himself the glory is the beauty of himself the Majesty of himself it's his own life filling on that day 120 Believers in the upper room it was his own character his own Beauty the very uh I hate to said the best of his of himself but because he's all the best but the but the His True Glory was coming in its beauty its majesty and it was not in a church and it was not in in in in in in a scroll it was not in now now that Glory was being filled and put in the temples of the Living God it was being put in people can you say am man something must have happened at Calvary for God to be able to say now there's opened a way that I can do what what I wanted from the beginning and that's I can bring my glory down and fill the human beings fill the Believers [Music] am and let me just say to you and those that are listening on the broadcast If You Preach Christianity any other way or anything less than what I'm saying today you're not preaching the full Council of God because what Christianity really is is God's glory filling the temples of human beings that's what he did that's what he went to Calvary before that's why he gave us his word that's why we have the Old and New Testament that's why we have our Bibles it's not just to say on that the ultimate goal of Christianity is that human beings be filled with the glory of God and if you're not preaching that or anything less than that you're not given the whole counsel because this is what Christianity is all about maybe I need to tell some of you today that you might have Christianity as just some dos and don'ts or some law to live by let me tell you it's not that friends that's religion can you say Amen this has to do with the glory of almighty God coming and descending into your life and if we stop short of that then we just have a religion how is that possible well because of the enemy making it a religion stopping short of the glory of God Bible says all of us have come short of the glory of God remember that scripture yeah all men all of us have sto short well that's a pretty big thing to stop short of because man can be full of religion they can live right they can wear the right clothes do everything to try to to try to do something for God in their own will but the ultimate thing is not that you try to do it on your own but that you don't and that you don't stop short of the glory of God he wants to fill you with his glory and today I'm teaching that it's not just filling you initially but we're to move from glory to glory to glory to glory until it becomes greater in your life that's a you know that's a scripture I'm going to read it in a minute but that's a journey to me that's not an instant moment at the altar that you completely get full of the glory of God your soul does but I can tell you this is a journey going from glory to glory to glory praise the Lord and so now we have to preach true Christianity it was after the early church church and I just say this as well it was after the early church that God filled his temples with the glory that the Antichrist Spirit replaced the glory coming in for a formula or a ritual it was the Antichrist spirit that did that but it's a transforming of You by God's power his life descends upon the individual you are changed don't ever forget this that this is one one of the main characteristics even today in preaching this one of the main charactera characteristics of the glory of God is change we sing the song from glory to glory he's changing me and if there's no change if you're staying then then it's less of the glory of God but when he moves in it's not just that you get a feeling and shout all over the room no no it's change it's changing you it's changing your mind it's changing your heart it's changing the way you thought of things before it's changing all the time this morning morning in the service if you will surrender God can change what you thought of God before he can change you this morning when the glory of God comes it doesn't come just to give us a feeling it comes to change us every time it came in the Bible it came to change things amen the characteristics is to change and it changes everything it never leaves anything the same the glory of God never leaves anything the same there's more glory and when there's more more Glory there's more change and that is why last Sunday in the many Sundays in the past I've labored uh last few Sundays on the subject of our heart when the heart lines up with the word that's in the soul it opens the way for more of the glory of God to come in why is that that our whole vessel can be more filled and not just our souls that our whole vessel could be filled with the glory of God Amen that he could take over our minds that he could take over our bodies that he could take over our will that he could take over every part of us that he could take over our memory you're so bound sometimes by your memory in the past memories that he could take that over and the glory of God could change it and so now then every once in a while when a memory comes back from the past the glory of God refills it and it ditches that past memory and now you only got the memories that God has given you he FS the memory he feels the conscience can you say man he fills your spirit Hallelujah testimonies are happening in the church now from since we've been preaching on the heart the the testimonies are coming in of the hearts becoming Unshackled by the years of things that held them back they were Christians they were Believers but what I've been preaching is yet your heart has to be clean and clear and lined up with what's in your soul and we're hearing testimonies coming in of Unshackled people being Unshackled for years of things what happened they moved to a greater glory they moved to a greater glory more things are opening up to me in this subject and I just like to explore some of it this morning there's a there's a difference here's one thing there's a difference in seeing the manifestation of God's glory and then it filling you we can observe God's glory how many believe we can observe God's glory in nature yeah and but you can do that that the world can do that if they got a little bit of belief in them then they believe and this is the crazy thing people can enjoy the creation and not believe in a Creator try to figure that one out oh what's such a beautiful creation well who created it and His glory was so manifested and we can see it all in the woods and in the mountains and whatever the glory of God you see it in there had to be a Creator to create that and so they look at that glory and they're just kind of AED by it and yet they won't they won't uh uh they enjoy the glory of its manifestation and yet they don't seek the god of that glory for what his purpose was his his his Bibles he wrote the first Bible in the heavens the the the constellation the beauty the Stars we see God's glory in it and we see God's uh his Supernatural power in it it had to be a Creator to create it and we can observe listen now we can observe the glory of God but not seek to be filled with it there's this there's this funny little story joke I don't mean to tell jokes but there's an atheist out in the woods and enjoying the woods he didn't believe in God and so comes Upon A bear and the bear starts chasing him and he's running for his life I'm telling you and finally the bear caught up with him and he got down and the bear was right on top of him just about ready to devour him and the guy The Atheist cries out to God God save me from this save me God responds and says hey you know what you haven't served me your whole life you haven't repented you haven't asked me to come into your heart at all and now at this moment where you're getting ready to get devoured by the spirit now you call out to me you don't believe in me remember he said I know I know I know and God says would you give me your heart no no no I I don't think I'm going to become a Christian but look could I just ask for this could you make the bear a Christian at this moment can you change it they don't want God's glory fors but they want want to see it in nature they want to see God move in their situations that are getting ready to die come on now can I preach a little bit people only want the glory of God when they're in an emergency people only want the glory of God when they're having somebody die God I need you right now and they never address God in other areas of their life I don't care what God says about what I wear I don't care what God says about what I do every day I don't care about all that but in this moment of an emergency see I really need his glory to come down right and in a moment's time God changed the bear to a Christian and the bear got off the side of the man he he put his paws together to pray he said Lord I Thank you you've made me a Christian and now I pray you'll bless this meal that you've given me to [Laughter] eat that's the end of the story and of course not a true story but I'm using it to show the example people they don't want to come to to all the glory of God they just want to pick and choose like a buffet can you say Amen this is not a buffet that you pick and choose of the message what you want God wants surrender Hearts to say I take all of this word into my life because when I take all of the word his glory will fill my life more for more of his glory more of his power more of his love you can cap out if you want to because a lot of times people do because they want to pick and choose choose we shouldn't pick and choose like that can I get an amen this morning there there's there's more glory in here there's more of you there's more of God for you it's moving on but we can hold him back and our hearts being restricted because we said we we we we we don't want to identify him and come closer to him and say Lord some of these things that I have in my life you want to get in that too and fill it with your glory there's a scripture in numbers and this brings this example numbers 14:22 says I'm moving along now because all those men which have seen my glory and my Miracles this is in the Old Testament with Moses all those men which have seen my glory and my Miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these 10 times and have not hearkened unto my voice now we have a whole generation that come out under a prophet two million of them they come out and God says you've seen my glory you've seen my miracles you you you you you've you've come out of Egypt by a mighty hand now you've been in the wilderness you've seen my glory and my Miracles but they observe it I'm just going to say now and look what his glory was his glory was in the cloud his glory was in the pillar of fire these were signs in the Heaven A Cloud by day a pillar of Fire by Night a sign in the heavens I'm not anchored to the sign but God sent a sign and that was his glory in that and in in Egypt when they look in Egypt and also in the wilderness when they looked up and seen a cloud a cloud that was leading them and a pillar of Fire by Night the glory of God was in that but seeing that Glory did not change their hearts just because they seen the cloud and the pillar of Fire doesn't mean their hearts have been changed because when he sends that glory and he gives a sign of it and he shows it around the world he does it because he's headed somewhere and he's headed to fill his temples with more of his glory and he said you have seen my glory and my Miracles but seeing all that Glory did not change them they stayed the same for 40 years they did not mature at all into more of God's glory just because they seen that glory and then later now notice now I'm taking you along later on the glory of the Lord came when the word came to Moses on the mountain the Ten Commandments and the glory of the Lord came and it came in just a little greater way because when the mount when the they carved the Ten Commandments in the mountain and Moses brings it down and I don't know how many days he was up there and the people were waiting for him but you see now this is God's Prophet bringing the word to his people such a significant thing and there was so much glory in God bringing his word to his people that now we see just a little window of what it would do because what happened was is when he came out of the mountain in that presence with the word coming to the people because my uh I I must just say this all all the glories of God come out of his word that's true it's when we're becoming one with this word and in the word let me just say in the word do you read your Bibles do you listen to it if you if you're not then listen you're not interested in more of the glory of God all the glories come out of his word and so now here's one little window that shows us the change now because he's been in nature he's he's uh given them water when they need water he's done all these things you understand all the Miracles in the waters he's created flies and the creative Powers working what great Glory was working on moses' lips what kind of power and Glory was this but now after all that Glory they seen it didn't come to them and so now when he comes from the mountain with this word coming from the mountain there was so much Glory over Moses and his vessel that they had to Veil Moses face because it what did it do it changed his countenance and the glory of the Lord so filled him now this is not the temple this is not the Tabernacle yet this is foretelling of this Glory coming on a human being now I always make the point the glory of the Lord could not come in the so level of Moses or anyone yet it could not come in the soul level because Calvary couldn't come yet so it could not change the desire from a serpent nature to God's nature it didn't it couldn't get there because he hadn't went to Calvary yet to to die for our sins and take care of the sin problem but I can tell you now that the sin problem was taken care of after Calvary Now That Glory now it could come to a soul level amen but look at it so powerful that he had to Veil his face they couldn't even look at his face there was so much Glory upon him yes sir it so changed his countenance and it just speaks of this Glory with a power to change things that you don't think can be changed to change you to change and uh here is his countenance changed so much and it was when the word came came and it starts to have the glory in it that can change men change not the soul yet but can begin to change men not just their countenance so go with me to 2 Corinthians 3 and we'll take this to the next step but if the ministration of death written and engraven in Stones that's Moses was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away and so he goes on to say how shall the not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for the ministration of condemnation if the ministration of condemnation be glory and condemnation is the law without the spirit is condemnation it tells you what you did wrong but and it stops there so it's condemnation and there was still glory in it much more do the ministration of the righteousness exceed in glory for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this Respect by reason of the glory that excelth the glory that excelth for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech in other words there's an openness to this there's a there's a transparency to this I'm not holding anything back Paul says under this Glory nothing's hidden from us and so we just say it plainly we speak the word plainly and not Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look at the end of that which is abolished look what he says here in verse 14 but their minds which uh their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ but even unto this day when Moses has read the veil is upon where where their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away it's just that simple you need to turn to the Lord and then you'll read your Bible right now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty but we all with open face beholding as in the glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from say it with me Glory to Glory even as by the spirit of God how is this happening we're moving and exceeding from glory to glory to glory to glory to glory thank you for watching our message today if you would like
